The bar street area was extremely lively. Groups of people passed by one after another. In the midst of the fun and laughter, a tall and slender figure appeared particularly prominent.Lin Yan\u2019s steps were wobbly and a bit unstable. He held the wall and gasped slightly, his narrow eyes full of the confusion of alcohol. People passed by. Occasionally, someone couldn\u2019t help taking a look at this face a few more times but no one went up to ask. In this neighborhood, there were countless young people like Lin Yan who were drunk every day. People had long been used to it.At this time, Lin Yan felt heat surging in his head again and again. He felt very uncomfortable. He took a few breaths and swayed as he tried to get up. Just as he turned around, he happened to bump into the person coming out of the bar next door.Under the influence of alcohol, Lin Yan\u2019s temper had been magnified by several times. He abruptly raised his head and pointed his hand at the tip of the other person\u2019s nose. \u201cI say, you\u2026\u201dHis words stopped abruptly when he saw the other person\u2019s face.The man was dressed in black and the neon lights and shadows seemed to condense around him. Right now, his brow was slightly furrowed but it didn\u2019t destroy the visual sense of the perfect facial proportions.The person walking behind him had originally followed him out. Now they stopped and were looking between the two people with interest.The man didn\u2019t seem accustomed to being pointed at like this. His eyes slightly lowered as he asked, \u201cIs there something?\u201dEven his voice had a unique texture. Lin Yan lost his voice after hearing the question. He stared at this dreamy face and suddenly reached out to grab the man\u2019s sleeve. \u201cTell me, why did you reject me?\u201dIt was the live questioning of a heartless man.The man, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe person behind him couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cWhat is this situation?\u201dIf anyone in their circle saw it, they would probably all recognize this face. BK\u2019s captain Jing Yuanzhou and a phenomenal player in the Burning Hot League, Titans.He was a presence who just needed to show his face in front of the camera to make the fans scream.Ku Tianlu looked surprised. \u201cCaptain, since when did you have such a love debt?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s thin lips pressed together tightly. He was too lazy to explain but he quickly took two steps forward, wanting to keep a distance from the drunk stranger. However, Lin Yan\u2019s eyes were always focused on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s body. The moment Jing Yuanzhou made a move, Lin Yan unknowingly took two steps forward. As a result, his feet were soft and he staggered directly forward.There was a sudden impact and Jing Yuanzhou was abruptly pressed against the wall.The other person\u2019s breath was filled with the extremely light smell of alcohol and long and narrow eyes stared at Jing Yuanzhou. Lin Yan suddenly reached out his hand and gently squeezed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s chin, his tone like a cat. \u201cBe obedient and come back with me.\u201dBefore this, who would\u2019ve thought there would be a day when the dignified God Jing would have liberties taken with him on the side of the road by a drunkard. Taking into account his own safety, Ku Tianlu covered his mouth tightly and didn\u2019t laugh.At this time, Jing Yuanzhou was still very polite. He lowered his eyes as he silently watched this person who \u2018threw himself\u2019 into Jing Yangzhou\u2019s arms. Jing Yuanzhou had to say that this pair of long and narrow phoenix eyes were seductive. If it wasn\u2019t for the drunk look, this bright and beautiful appearance would be his favourite type.Jing Yuanzhou slowly leaned against the wall and asked, \u201cDo you know me?\u201dLin Yan nodded. \u201cOf course I do.\u201dSure enough, he mistook Jing Yuanzhou for a lost lover. Jing Yuanzhou thought this and suddenly felt a lack of interest for some reason. He was ready to get up when he heard Lin Yan say, \u201cAren\u2019t you\u2026 Jing Yuanzhou?\u201d\u201cCaptain, he really knows you!\u201d Ku Tianlu was shocked and couldn\u2019t help asking Jing Yuanzhou again, \u201cAre you sure this isn\u2019t a rotten peach blossom you left behind?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou might be surprised but his answer was very firm. \u201cI would never forget his face if I had seen it before.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ku Tianlu glanced at Lin Yan\u2019s unforgettable appearance and deeply agreed. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cI can only say that you are worthy of being the captain of our BK. You came out and actually met such a fanatical fan, tsk tsk.\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t answer. He straightened and wanted to leave. However, he hadn\u2019t even taken a step forward when his arm was hugged. Lin Yan hugged the arm and muttered, \u201cBelieve me, let\u2019s talk. I will definitely make you change your mind\u2026\u201dKu Tianlu watched Jing Yuanzhou and suddenly felt some sympathy. \u201cCaptain, what do we do now?\u201dHow was this a fanatic? This was clearly a boyfriend fan, an imaginative fan, a delusional fan!Jing Yuanzhou was silent for a moment. Then he took out the car key with the hand that could still move and threw it at Ku Tianlu. \u201cI will find him a hotel. You go back first.\u201dThis was truly pampering a fan but\u2026Ku Tianlu seemed hesitant. \u201cThis\u2026 or should I go with you?\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at him. \u201cWhy? Do you think I will eat him?\u201dKu Tianlu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2018No, just look at this drunk shrimp that is like a wolf. I\u2019m afraid that you will be eaten by him!\u2019However, Ku Tianlu knew that Jing Yuanzhou never liked to talk to people too much. He could only say, \u201cCaptain, you should pay attention to safety.\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t say much. He grabbed Lin Yan who was holding onto his arm and walked to the near Qitian chain hotel. As he was registering the information, Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the ID card in the other person\u2019s wallet.Oh, his name was Lin Yan.Perhaps it was because the arm he was holding had an inexplicable sense of security. Lin Yan didn\u2019t say a word along the way and was very well-behaved. It wasn\u2019t until the room was opened and Jing Yuanzhou threw him on the bed that he started again.\u201dDon\u2019t go. Trust me, I am definitely the one who knows you the best.\u201dDue to the bad things in the club, Jing Yuanzhou had indeed been in a bad mood these days. In normal times, he would have absolutely no interest in this type of lovelorn syndrome. However, now he sat down on the bed and asked with interest, \u201cOh? Then tell me, how do you understand me?\u201dLin Yan was half sitting on the bed with his collar slightly open, revealing the sexy outline of his collarbone. The long and narrow phoenix eyes stared at Jing Yuanzhou in a straightforward manner, the gaze sticky and ambiguous. Obviously, he hadn\u2019t drunk that much alcohol. He didn\u2019t know how he became so drunk like this.At this moment, he slightly moved forward so that the two people were closer together and his lips opened slightly. \u201cIt is like this. I have been paying attention to you\u2026\u201dPerhaps it was due to the excessive atmosphere but under this gaze, Jing Yuanzhou felt an inexplicable burning in his body.Then he heard Lin Yan gasp and finish the second half of the sentence, \u201c\u2026matches.\u201dJing Yuanzhou who was ready to be confessed to, \u201c?\u201dLin Yan continued, \u201cI watched this year\u2019s WTG finals. BK\u2019s internal coaching team had problems with the lineup configuration. This is why such a big coordination error occurred in the final game.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was silent and the surrounding area became quiet in an instant.During Lin Yan\u2019s speech, his head hung down and his unfocused eyes were on the white bedding, but the content of his words seemed to have been deduced countless times previously. His mind might be dull under the influence of alcohol but he was still methodical and logical.It ranged from small things like details of the specific cooperation to large things like the overall BP (ban and pick) decision-making error. The key point for every detail and case was mentioned.The look on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s face couldn\u2019t be read.This year, the BK team lost in the WTG finals. How many people regretted it and how many people questioned his performance as the captain on the field? However, there were no more than three people in the league who could see the real problem and this included the coaching staff of the top, powerful teams.Jing Yuanzhou had never been a person who liked to argue with people and he cared even less about the comments on the Internet. Now a person appeared in front of him and told him clearly: The loss wasn\u2019t your fault.During the one-man show that lasted for half an hour, only Lin Yan\u2019s voice was heard in the room. He completed all the deductions about the finals without missing a word. It was like a replay without video feedback and even included many fatal problems that their BK coaching staff hadn\u2019t discovered. It was terribly sharp.Lin Yan finally sighed with relief once he finished talking. He raised his head in a daze, stared straight at the silent Jing Yuanzhou and smiled. \u201cLook, don\u2019t I know you very much?\u201dJing Yuanzhou met this gaze and didn\u2019t speak. He waited for this person to continue.Lin Yan\u2019s mouth curved up and he suddenly approached, his breath gently blowing on Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cSince I know you so well, can you consider me\u2026\u201dThe drawn-out tone was full of an ambiguous atmosphere. It seemed that his emotions were in place. Lin Yan\u2019s body slightly shook and he suddenly pulled at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s sleeve. \u201cCan you consider me\u2026\u2014!\u201dVomit!Jing Yuanzhou, \u201c!\u201dThe originally ambiguous atmosphere in this room became filled with a more unique scent.***The next morning, Lin Yan sat on the soft bed with an indifferent expression. The aftermath of the hangover made his head feel a bit painful. In fact, he also knew that \u2018his\u2019 drinking capacity was poor but he hadn\u2019t expected it to be so bad.He thought back on last night\u2019s scene and felt it was a bit too much. How much did he drink to become so drunk? It seemed to be\u2026 half a cup?Lin Yan wanted to recall what happened last night but the fragmented images were completely broken after he stepped out of the bar door, no matter how much he tried to put them together.His dream in his dazed state wasn\u2019t bad. In his dream, he actually caught Jing Yuanzhou by the side of the road. He moved Jing Yuanzhou with emotion and reason so that he finally got this god-level player to sign the transfer contract after three cold and ruthless rejections.Wonderful! It was a pity that it was just a dream.The feeling of his body being so weak was really uncomfortable. Lin Yan rubbed his hair and was about to get out of bed. Then the moment he opened the quilt, his movements completely froze. He only just discovered that his upper body was naked. If it wasn\u2019t for the pants that were still neatly worn, he would\u2019ve thought he experienced spring.Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWait. It wasn\u2019t a dream! Yesterday, he seemed to have casually grabbed a man on the side of the road?!Lin Yan\u2019s gaze slowly moved and finally landed on the bedside table. The white note was particularly striking against the dark brown furniture and he could see the words on it: service fee. On top of the note was a coin with a value of 1 jiaoIt was full of mockery.Lin Yan pressed hard against his knuckles until there was a cracking sound. He didn\u2019t remember the man\u2019s appearance at all but it was best for the man not to be caught by him in the future! Otherwise, Lin Yan would press the person on the bed and make it so that he couldn\u2019t even cry!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHis assistant Luo Mo hurried over after receiving the call. He arrived at the hotel and found Lin Yan lying lazily on the sofa, rubbing his temples with slender fingers and looking tired.Luo Mo poured a glass of cold water, handed it over and blamed himself. \u201cIt is my fault. I wouldn\u2019t have left yesterday if I knew it would be like this.\u201dYesterday, the group of young masters in the east of the city gathered in the bar street and called Lin Yan on a whim.It was just that Lin Yan was used to participating in social gatherings and knew he was poor in drinking. He would often be able to avoid drinking. It was for this reason that Lin Yan had left without worrying after receiving a temporary notice.He never thought that the young master would be carried away by a whim to drink. The fire of gossip might be burning in Luo Mo\u2019s heart but he didn\u2019t ask much about what happened last night. He didn\u2019t dare ask.Lin Yan read many emotions from the assistant\u2019s extremely complicated gaze. Then he remembered what happened last night and he felt the vein on his forehead to bulge. He really hadn\u2019t expected \u2018his\u2019 drinking capacity to be so poor or he wouldn\u2019t have drunk half a glass of wine to give Cheng Lexin some face.Luo Mo paid attention to Lin Yan\u2019s mental state and suggested, \u201cYou aren\u2019t busy today. Why don\u2019t you go back and rest first?\u201d\u201cHow can I do that?\u201d Lin Yan didn\u2019t think much and shook his head in refusal. \u201cWhy do you think I dealt with Cheng Lexin\u2019s group for so long yesterday if it wasn\u2019t for their resources? Once the club is established, there will be no need to worry about a publicity channel with their help. How can I be worthy of my sacrifice if I rest instead of getting things done in a hurry?\u201dLuo Mo was stunned. He obviously hadn\u2019t expected last night\u2019s drinking party to have such intentions. \u201cSo we have to go to BK again?\u201dAdding the feedback they received two days ago, the BK Club had rejected the transfer of Jing Yuanzhou three times already.To be honest, most people in this situation would\u2019ve given up but Lin Yan wasn\u2019t affected in the slightest. \u201cOF course! Have you ever heard of the saying \u2018a good woman is afraid of a pestering man\u2019? As long as we work hard, I don\u2019t believe that Jing Yuanzhou will be able to keep resisting.\u201dLuo Mo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis was the truth. So why didn\u2019t it sound right? Luo Mo had been with Lin Yan for three years. To be honest, he hadn\u2019t figured out how this young master had suddenly become interested in the field of e-sports.Anyone who had been in contact with the e-sports circle knew that Ying Yangzhou was the core existence of the powerful BK team. Many clubs had been greedy for influence that could be brought by the name \u2018Titans\u2019 alone but none of them had been able to pry him away from BK.Even the well-established giant clubs hadn\u2019t been able to catch God Jing\u2019s eye. The empty club like Lin Yan\u2019s that just completed the registration obviously wasn\u2019t enough. Forget agreeing to the transfer. BK being patient enough to politely refuse was enough to give face to the Lin family.However, Lin Yan didn\u2019t pay attention to the triple refusal.His fingers tapped on the tap as he told his assistant the key point. \u201cIn short, I must get my hands on the man I like.\u201dLuo Mo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe recalled how Lin Yan spent three days and three nights sitting in front of a computer to watch Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s matches and almost suspected that his boss was greedy for the other person\u2019s body.Lin Yan saw that Luo Mo wasn\u2019t responding and looked up at him. \u201cWhat are you still doing here? Continue to contact BK and find a way to test their bottom line.\u201dLuo Mo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d In the end, was this to sign someone or was it to propose marriage?Luo Mo always implemented the things that Lin Yan ordered so he immediately went to contact BK. Lin Yan rubbed his hair and got up from the sofa. He opened the refrigerator and took out a can of Coke.The moment he opened it, he heard a fizzing sound as the bubbles inside instantly became agitated. The coolness that poured into his body made Lin Yan let out a long sigh. Looking up, he saw the person reflected on the wall-mounted TV screen.He had to admit that this body was incomparably beautiful no matter the point of view. In particular, there was the pair of long and narrow phoenix eyes from where it was easy to see his original shadow.Even after all this, Lin Yan still had an unrealistic feeling.The world\u2019s hottest MOBA game \u2018Burn the War (BTW). The Chinese translation was \u2018Burning Hot\u2019. Unwittingly, it had become the mainstream game in today\u2019s e-sports field.A month ago, he was still the famous chief tactical analyst of the Burning Hot e-sports league. He didn\u2019t expect that he would actually get stuck in an official derivative novel of this game and become a character with the same name, who had never appeared.It was now a full year away from the timeline of the novel.Lin Yan didn\u2019t struggle over this unbelievable event for too long. He took a month to accept his current identity and then made the decision to re-enter the e-sports circle.The Coke can in his hand was empty in the blink of an eye. He tossed it and it flew in a sharp arc through the air and accurately fell into the trash can.One thing was certain. God Jing in the league wasn\u2019t a man who could be coaxed casually with a few words. A lot of effort was needed if he wanted this person to willingly follow him.***The WTG finals were officially over and the heat hadn\u2019t dissipated. Most of the industry\u2019s attention had shifted to the upcoming transfer period.BK might\u2019ve failed to win the championship but they were still a top giant in China. Any player inside it could be a signboard existence. Since they knew the importance of Jing Yuanzhou to the BK team, other clubs hadn\u2019t come to inquire about signing him over the past few years. However, this year, it was unknown where they got the news but in just a few days, the senior management had received several transfer offers.Of these probing clubs, GH was the most unexpected.It had to be admitted that the price given by the other party was indeed high. However, Manager Wang of the BK Club saw the information where it said the number of team members was \u20180\u2019 and felt a pain in his head. \u201cWhat do you think the rich second generation are going now? Do they really think that e-sports is easy to spend money in to play around? This is really persistent. They contacted me again today and said that if we aren\u2019t satisfied with the price, we can fill it in at will. What is this wealthy look? Do they really think you will be willing to go to their third-rate team? A new club with no members and no ratings? Dignified God Jing, do you want to go and help them in a few Internet cafe challengers?\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised the coffee cup to his lips and took a sip. \u201cIn fact, it isn\u2019t impossible if the price is in place.\u201dManager Wang\u2019s endless words suddenly stopped and his gaze that fell on Jing Yuanzhou was a bit complicated. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. I know that the club wronged you but you can\u2019t abandon yourself!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think this is abandoning myself.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cAt my age, it is almost time to retire. What\u2019s wrong with making a final profit before leaving? At least, compared to other clubs, GH\u2019s attitude is quite conscientious.\u201dThe mention of the other clubs made Manager Wang feel more and more like he was going to have a heart attack.As a competitor in the circle, Jing Yuanzhou was recognized for his strength. However, from the perspective of his age, he was likely to retire in one or two years.Obviously, these clubs were eager to improve their team\u2019s ability. On the other hand, they were reluctant to spend too many unnecessary funds on such a \u2018short-term\u2019 player. They were basically stuck with a one or two year contract. The offers made by them really weren\u2019t high compared to the rich and generous GH.Manager Wang had to say that the sincerity of the GH Club was indeed very high but the qualifications weren\u2019t there at all. Forget the Titans fans, even Manager Wang couldn\u2019t help feeling aggrieved the moment he thought of Jing Yuanzhou leaving the professional league to participate in these untrustworthy Internet cafe competitions.In addition, if he had to say something without a conscience, the seniors of the BK Club might feel sorry for Jing Yuanzhou but out of selfishness, they didn\u2019t want Titans to transfer to another club.The awkward situation at this time gave them room to maneuver.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t expose Manager Wang\u2019s calculations and continued to stab a knife in this person\u2019s chest. \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the Internet cafe competitions. It is really interesting. In the beginning, wasn\u2019t BK also playing from an Internet cafe? Perhaps if I bring GH to the professional league, I might be able to meet my old teammates from BK on the field in the future?\u201dManager Wang almost cried. \u201cCaptain Jing, don\u2019t say that!\u201dThe grand occasion where Jing Yuanzhou led the team from a third-rate league all the way to the league was still talked about until now. As a result, for the development of the team, the club management wanted him to give way to a new player in advance. It was due to Manager Wang\u2019s guilty conscience that he felt more stressed when he heard about the past.\u201cOkay, I\u2019m just teasing you.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou put the coffee down on the table and looked disinterested. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that I was ready to be listed. The matter about transferring, let\u2019s talk about it again.\u201dManager Wang sighed with relief. \u201cYes, then I won\u2019t reply immediately to GH\u2019s side. After all, it is the prince of the Lin Group. I should leave him some face.\u201dJing Yuanzhou slightly raised an eyebrow. \u201cLin?\u201dManager Wang saw Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s interest and spoke casually. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you before? The owner of this GH Club is the Lin Group\u2019s prince, Lin Yan. Otherwise, how could an ordinary rich second generation family member stand to splurge like this?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was silent for a moment after hearing the name. \u201cDo you have the contact information? Please send me a copy.\u201dManager Wang\u2019s words stopped abruptly. He had finally calmed down only to feel his blood pressure shoot up to the top of his head in an instant.What did this mean? Was he really planning to sign to GH?***This was the fourth contact with BK but there was no response from the other side for a long time.Lin Yan didn\u2019t receive any news all day. He lay on the bed in his bedroom and looked at his phone. He clicked randomly on an online shopping website Bao and was a bit absent-minded.How great would it be if he could buy Jing Yuanzhou directly on the Internet. Unfortunately, there was no such \u2018if.\u2019 Putting aside other things, bad luck was really bad luck when it came to the matter of establishing the GH Club.Things had progressed to the present. Not only did he fail to get the man he admired, but he also accidentally got drunk and asked another wild man to take advantage.The one jiao coin on the bedside table of the hotel suddenly came to his mind, shining brightly. Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help cursing in his heart. He was in a frustrated mood and was about to place his phone to the side when he received a short video push from a video software.His actions paused and his gaze fell on the title of the push: Virtual Boyfriend. What is the experience of blushing because of a virtual boyfriend?Lin Yan was suffering from having nowhere to vent his black mood. Now his eyes lit up. Oh? This was a little interesting! Lin Yan had heard a bit about the recently popular \u2018virtual boyfriend\u2019 service. He hadn\u2019t paid attention but in this situation, it seemed tailor-made for him.Some things were inconvenient to say to people like Luo Mo. It seemed like a pretty good choice to find a stranger on the Internet to change his mood.Lin Yan spent a few minutes watching the video and was suddenly intrigued. He quickly found a virtual shop on a certain online shopping website and didn\u2019t hesitate to order the most expensive one from \u2018Zhendian Bao.\u2019The order was completed and the customer service sister sent him a message. [Thank you for your patronage. Our store assistant little brother is busy right now. Please wait a moment and we will soon add you on WeChat!\u201dLin Yan glanced at it and wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He casually lay on the bed and waited to enjoy the service. After a few moments, the phone screen lit up again.[\u2019Z\u2019 has applied to add friends. Note: Chat.]Lin Yan passed the application without hesitation. Then he sent a message. [Little brother, you made me wait so anxiously! (Shy.jpg).]At the same time, BK Club\u2019s player dormitory.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze fell on the very shy little person in the expression pack and Lin Yan\u2019s face appeared in his mind. Such an opening statement was worthy of this person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yan waited a while and didn\u2019t see a response from the other person, so he sent a message again. [Little brother, do you still want to chat?\u201dThe opposite person finally replied. [Chat.]Lin Yan stared at this overly concise reply and couldn\u2019t help being silent for a moment. Nowadays, did the treasure of the virtual boyfriend store cherish words like gold? He thought about how he ordered the conversation package and didn\u2019t want to waste time. He asked in a straightforward manner, \u201cVoice call?\u201dThere was no reply from the other side. Then a moment later, a voice call request was sent cooperatively. Lin Yan was satisfied and connected the call. He was just fiddling with his headphones when a man\u2019s voice came from the earpiece. \u201cHello?\u201dThe voice was deep and magnetic. The slightly lazy feeling added an indescribable charm.Lin Yan: \u201c!\u201dHe wasn\u2019t a pure voice control but the voice at the other end still made his heart thump. Fuck, this sound was too nice! It was worthy of the treasure of this store. The money spent was worth it!Lin Yan had never been stingy with praise. In any case, he watched the video of the virtual boyfriends. He was meant to be coquettish and spend his own money. He simply let go of any scruples. \u201cLittle brother, my vision is okay. Your voice almost made me pregnant.\u201dIn the BK player\u2019s dormitory, the water glass that Jing Yuanzhou just picked up slightly tilted. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan once again heard no sound and couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Were you scared by my gender?\u201dThe business of virtual boyfriends might\u2019ve become hot lately but most of those placing orders were women. A man\u2019s voice suddenly appeared and it was understandable to be scared.A moment later, the other person spoke again. \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI know your gender.\u201dIt was clearly a tone with no fluctuations but for some reason, a scene appeared in his mind of the person smiling slightly. Lin Yan\u2019s earlobes burned uncontrollably due to the voice.\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d He praised the store assistant\u2019s professional and cleared his throat to disguise himself. \u201cIt\u2019s like this. Some things have happened recently and it isn\u2019t comfortable to talk to the people around me. However, I feel uncomfortable if I don\u2019t say it. Thus, I thought of trying a new service. Little brother, can you chat with me?\u201dHearing this, Jing Yuanzhou knew that Lin Yan got the wrong person. It was reasonable to say that he should tell the other person. However, the demons and gods were at work and he just let out a low hum. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dAfter all, this was a matter related to his innocence. Lin Yan thought for a moment before finding a relatively appropriate entry point. \u201cThat is, I have a friend\u2026\u201dJing Yuanzhou leaned back in his chair and listened while calmly drinking tea.\u201cThat friend accidentally drank too much one night and met a man while he was outside.\u201dJing Yuanzhou paused slightly as he held the cup.\u201cUnexpectedly, this scumbag coveted my friend\u2019s beauty! He actually devised a plan. He took advantage of my friend\u2019s disoriented mind and tricked him into a hotel, opening a room!\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe more Lin Yan spoke, the angrier he became. \u201cThat isn\u2019t the most abominable thing. Do you know what the most hateful thing was?\u201d\u201c\u2026What was it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe had to say that this plot was really damn familiar.Lin Yan noticed there was no sound coming from the other end and asked tentatively, \u201cLittle brother, are you still there?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTell me, do you think this scumbag is a special scumbag?\u201d\u201cYes, he is a scumbag.\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t we teach this type of scumbag a lesson?Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s interest was hooked. \u201cSo how do you want to teach him a lesson?\u201dLin Yan had already imagined the answer to this question countless times and his answer flowed out quickly like a stream. \u201cOf course, it is to find him, strip him naked and throw him on the bed. Torture him, destroy him, trample him, humiliate him and let him kneel down before me, cough, before my friend, crying and begging for forgiveness!\u2019He just finished speaking when he heard the other person give a low chuckle. \u201cVery good, I\u2019m cheering for you.\u201dHe might not be able to see the person but such a voice was too seductive. Lin Yan heard this laugh and felt a bit out of control. He recalled the content seen before in the video and didn\u2019t want to waste his money. He eagerly reminded this person, \u201cLittle brother, after talking for so long, shouldn\u2019t you change the way you call me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou slightly raised his eyebrow. \u201cChange it to what?\u201d\u201cSince it is between boyfriends, what do you think of \u2018Baby\u2019?\u201dA strange silence appeared. Lin Yan waited a while with anticipation but never heard from the other side. He was the gold master and was preparing to urge this person when he heard faint movements from the headphones.A moment later, the magnetic voice was heard close to his ears. \u201cOkay, Baby.\u201dLin Yan: \u201c!\u201dThis overly seductive tone made him feel a bit dizzy. It took a long time before he came back to his senses. Lin Yan was about to say something when he inadvertently glanced at his phone and saw the frantic message notifications that were popping up at the top of the screen.[Customer Service: Hello, are you there?][Customer Service: Hello, the store assistant has already applied to be your friend. Please accept it as soon as possible.][Customer Service: Do you still need to continue the virtual boyfriend service?][Customer Service: If there is no reply within five minutes, I will cancel the order. Please understand.][Customer Service: Hello, your virtual boyfriend order has been canceled. Your patronage next time is welcome.]Lin Yan read these messages several times and then clicked on the friends interface of WeChat to see a friend message that was pending review.Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWait a minute! If this was the virtual store assistant he placed the order with in the store, who was he chatting with now? It seemed he was silent for too long. The man on the other end of the call asked in a low voice, \u201cBaby, why aren\u2019t you talking anymore?\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck this baby!Lin Yan stared at the other party\u2019s WeChat profile picture of SpongeBob SquarePants for a long time and tentatively asked, \u201cLittle brother, can I ask for your name.\u201dThe man in the BK club smiled slightly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forgot to introduce myself. This is Jing Yuanzhou.\u201dLin Yan, who was lying on the bed, closed his eyes and fell into a strange silence.For this type of thing, it was better to close himself off.Jing Yuanzhou thought the conversation would end here. He didn\u2019t expect that after a while, Lin Yan\u2019s official voice was heard as if he had amnesia. \u201cAh, Captain Jing. Are you finally willing to contact us? I\u2019m glad that you finally feel the sincerity of our GH. How about it? When do you plan to sign the contract? If it is convenient, I can ask the assistant to send you the transfer contract in an hour. The specific fee can be discussed freely to ensure your satisfaction!\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at the time that was approaching 9 o\u2019clock and cooperatively didn\u2019t mention the previous topic. \u201cForget it today. It is too late.\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t too late. This time is more suitable for us to cultivate our feelings.\u201dThis was really the first time Jing Yuanzhou met someone outside the arena who could say flirty things so well. His lips curved up slightly. \u201cTomorrow afternoon, I\u2019ll be waiting for you at the BK Club.\u201dLin Yan naturally had no reason to refuse. \u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll see you there.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s set. I\u2019m waiting for you, Baby.\u201dBefore the last \u2018by\u2019 was heard, the voice cut had been cut off by the expressionless Lin Yan. He fell back heavily on the bed and his eyes stared at the dazzling ceiling above him for a long time. In the end, he couldn\u2019t bear it and secretly cursed. \u201cFuck?\u201d***At three in the afternoon the next door, a Maserati parked at the entrance of the club as scheduled.The girl at the front desk was stunned for a moment. Then she saw the person getting out of the car and her face became hot.Luo Mo wasn\u2019t surprised by this. Once Lin Yan got out of the car, Luo Mo calmly closed the door for him.Lin Yan\u2019s face was famous in the circle for attracting bees and butterflies. There might be no shortage of handsome men in the e-sports circle but those children couldn\u2019t compare to this temperament. The \u2018walking hormone\u2019 recognized in the upper-class circles wasn\u2019t a false nickname.Lin Yan walked over and leaned forward with a smile. \u201cLittle sister, were you waiting here for me?\u201dThis face entered her vision and the front desk girl felt a burst of heat in her head. She stuttered, \u201cY-Yes! Please follow me!\u201dThen she turned around and started walking.Lin Yan had originally wanted to inquire about Jing Yuanzhou. At this time, he was completely blank and he glanced at Luo Mo suspiciously. \u201cAre the reception staff so scatterbrained these days?\u201dLuo Mo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know about being scatterbrained but at Lin Yan\u2019s distance just now, if it was changed to a man then he would also be impatient!The BK Club was a well-deserved giant in the league. This entire complex belonged to the base. Lin Yan observed it as he walked. \u201cAh Mo, remember the scale on this side and then look back at our base decorations. We can\u2019t let others compare.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe reception room was at the end of the first floor corridor of Building B. After pointing the way, the front desk girl hurriedly ran to the office area to find the team manager. Lin Yan walked to the reception room and looked up at the promotional photos on the walls.The BK Club had existed since the league was just established and there were countless top players. At this time, the wall had photos of active players. Since there had been many changes in the past two years, there were many young, new faces.Lin Yan took two more steps forward and stopped near the end. In the photo on the wall, the man had deep eyes. He knew he was shooting a publicity photo but he still had a light and indifferent expression. Just this face was enough to make thousands of fans scream. Titans Jing Yuanzhou was top-notch when it came to personal strength and commercial value.Lin Yan stood quietly in place for a while. He was in the early stages of his business so looking at this gleaming human-shaped sign, he felt itchy. He couldn\u2019t help reach out a hand to lightly touch this angry face. \u201cAh, what to do? The more I look, the more I want him.\u201dHe didn\u2019t notice the two men coming down from the stairs in the corner. One of them staggered when he heard the words and almost rolled down the stairs. Ku Tianlu had been gossiping with Jing Yuanzhou about the incident from last time. Due to this sentence, he almost died young.Once he finally stood firmly, he glanced at the face of the man next to him and his body shook slightly. Where did this guy come from? First, someone took liberties with their captain and now someone else came to the BK base to take liberties?!Ku Tianlu looked up in a daze, wanting to see who was so bad. As a result, this memorable face entered his vision and he was stunned. \u201cCaptain, isn\u2019t this person\u2026\u201dHe felt the temperature around him drop and he fell silent out of a desperate desire to live. However, his mind was full of whistling alpacas. This\u2026 the captain\u2019s romantic debt came to the door?!Jing Yuanzhou wore loose, casual clothing and it made him look a bit lazy. At this moment, he leaned slightly on the railings and wasn\u2019t in a hurry to go downstairs. His eyes fell on the back not far away and his expression was quite intrigued.Ku Tianlu stood next to him and didn\u2019t dare open his mouth in this atmosphere. He could only wait for Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s order to go and catch the person. As a result, the corners of the cold mouth curved up slightly.Ku Tianlu was instantly stupefied. Was this a smile? Wasn\u2019t this the most inhumane man in the league? Wtf, what was this situation? Was their captain really not clean?Ku Tianlu vaguely felt that his brain wasn\u2019t sufficient. Just then, he saw Manager Wang rushing over and leading Lin Yan, who never moved from in front of the promotional photo, into the reception room.Jing Yuanzhou also finally moved slowly. He walked to the door of the reception room with a calm expression, leaned against the wall and took out a cigarette to start smoking.Ku Tianlu, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, there was a day when he would follow his captain to eavesdrop. In addition, what he heard was, um, fairly open.The window was open so the conversation in the reception room could be heard.Manager Wang obviously hadn\u2019t expected that Jing Yuanzhou would actually invite these people to the base. He felt panicked when he thought that this great god might really intend to transfer.He deliberately suppressed the other said and after a few useless, polite sentences, he put on the attitude of a senior in the field talking to the younger generation. \u201cChief Lin, speaking of your GH Club, it means \u2018Go Home\u2019? Go home? This name sounds unlucky.\u201d\u201cAh, that meaning is right but it isn\u2019t unlucky. It is because GH means\u2026\u201d Lin Yan raised his eyelashes as he spoke, his mouth curved up in an amused arc.\u201cIt means to make all the opponents go home.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKe Tianlu was a bit confused. He had never heard of the GH team but they suddenly visited the base at this time. There must be only one purpose. He instinctively looked at Jing Yuanzhou and was confused by the thoughts in his mind.In the end, there was only one thought left in his muddled head. \u2018This person is really worthy of being a fan of our Captain Jing! He pursued his star all this way! This state was too extravagant!\u2019Ku Tianlu finally recovered from his shock but before he could say anything, Jing Yuanzhou had put out the cigarette butt and pushed open the door to walk in. Ku Tianlu instinctively followed quickly.The people in the reception room heard the movement and looked up simultaneously. Lin Yan saw Jing Yuanzhou and his eyes visibly lit up. It was hard to miss him day and night. Now he finally saw the living person!Manager Wang obviously hadn\u2019t wanted to see Jing Yuanzhou appear here but he could only flatten his lips in a straight line. \u201cTitans, why did you come here?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I just came to take a look.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou said and calmly glanced at Lin Yan. He made a simple greeting. \u201cChief Lin.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t have the same drunken manner as he did on that night at the bar street. There was a shallow smile in his long and narrow phoenix eyes. His simple suit was in contrast with the formally dressed Manager Wang.He had such a young face and it was difficult to connect him with the boss behind a club. As Manager Wang had staged before, the GH team looked like it was formed due to the young master of the Lin Group playing around.Lin Yan stood up and politely held out his hand. \u201cGod Jing, this is our first meeting.\u201dKu Tianlu stared at the two of them shaking hands. This wasn\u2019t the first time they met! Before he could inwardly finish his complaints, Jing Yuanzhou had taken back his hand and looked at Lin Yan with great interest. \u201cCompared to God Jing, I still prefer to hear you call me \u2018little brother\u2019.\u201dKu Tianlu, \u201c???\u201dLin Yan met Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes directly and he smiled sharply. \u201cWhat a coincidence. I also prefer \u2018Baby\u2019 over \u2018Chief Lin\u2019.\u201dThe two people stared at each other for a few seconds. Then they smiled and sat down on the sofa. Ku Tianlu didn\u2019t dare to even lift his head. Their captain called someone \u2018baby\u2019? Don\u2019t ask. If he asked then his world view would collapse at an irreparable rate.The atmosphere in the room became very subtle because of a simple dialogue. After a long time, Manager Wang cleared his throat and tried to make himself ignore the shocking words just now. \u201cSince everyone is here\u2026 let\u2019s talk about business.\u201dWhat else could be done now? The GH Club was the one who invited Jing Yuanzhou to transfer. Before this, Luo Mo had contacted the BK Club three times on behalf of GH and was rejected. Now that Jing Yuanzhou had directly invited them to the base, the content of the conversation couldn\u2019t be avoided.\u201cWe have previously talked to each other about Titans. Chief Lin, you should know that a transfer isn\u2019t something that can be decided casually.\u201d Manager Wang spoke while frantically glancing at Ku Tianlu next to him.However, Ku Tianlu had a thick skin and still remembered Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s matter in his heart. Manager Wang\u2019s eyes were shaking like the wind but Ku Tianlu pretended he hadn\u2019t received the signal and stayed where he was.Manager Wang had no choice but to continue. \u201cAfter all, God Jing has always been the signboard of our BK Club. The moment BK is mentioned, fans will immediately think of Titans. It might not be uncommon for professional players to transfer but GH\u2026 after all, you don\u2019t have the qualification for the professional league. If you rashly sign Titans and the fans make trouble, it might not necessarily bring about a positive value.\u201dIt might be implicit but the implication could be summed up with one sentence: Your small GH temple can\u2019t afford such a big god like Titans. Be careful when acting not to be completely crushed.Jing Yuanzhou already knew that the club\u2019s senior management didn\u2019t actually want him to go. He wasn\u2019t surprised by Manager Wang\u2019s remarks and just watched Lin Yan with interest, wondering what this person would say.Manager Wang desperately hoped that the other person would give up on the idea of digging this person away. As a result, he spoke so many words and the other person threw \u2018it\u2019s none of your business\u2019 in his face. His body swayed slightly and he almost fell off the sofa as his expression turned ugly. \u201cSo what does Chief Lin mean?\u201dLin Yan steadily watched Jing Yuanzhou and asked instead, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I ask the intention of the little brother first?\u201dJing Yuanzhou heard this name and his eyelashes trembled slightly before he opened his mouth. \u201cThe other things aren\u2019t urgent. We can discuss the transfer fee first.\u201dThe other things weren\u2019t urgent? Opening up with the transfer fee, did he really want to sign with them?! Manager Wang almost jumped up from the sofa. Then he took a deep breath and strengthened his heart. \u201cYes, let\u2019s talk about the transfer fee first.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t have an opinion. \u201cIt is easy to say. My assistant should\u2019ve already talked to you in advance. If you aren\u2019t satisfied with the price previously offered, your club can make a direct offer.\u201dManager Wang knew very well that the management didn\u2019t really want Jing Yuanzhou to transfer. He gritted his teeth and directly stated a number. \u201c25 million!\u201dJing Yuanzhou heard this and looked over at his manager with a smile.He was well aware of the offers made to him by other clubs some time ago. Apart from the 18 million that GH offered last time, the highest was UYY\u2019s 15 million.This was the result of UYY\u2019s management tightening the belt and squeezing out this much. Now 25 million was just the opening price. If it was a few years ago then the ID of Titans was certainly worth this number.However, Jing Yuanzhou was now 23 years old. Everyone knew what this age meant in the gaming circle. No one was willing to spend too much money on a player destined for a short career. Sure enough, Lin Yan shook his head without hesitation after hearing it. \u201cNo.\u201dManager Wang heard the expected reply and controlled his mouth that wanted to smile. He forced out a regretful expression. \u201cThen I can only say sorry. According to the thinking of our BK management, we have agreed that\u2026\u201dLin Yan interrupted him. \u201cI mean, the price is too low.\u201dJing Yuanzhou slightly frowned.Manager Wang thought he had misheard. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t mind repeating it. \u201cThe price of 25 million yuan is too low for the man I want.\u201dHe didn\u2019t seem to feel Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze as he reported a number without delay. \u201c35 million, I can\u2019t go below this price.\u201dManager tilted to the side and almost fell off the sofa. He had helped several ace players come and go but this was the first time he had seen this type of reverse bargaining. It was inevitable that he would stutter. \u201c3-35 million?\u201dThe current league\u2019s record was 28 million for Luni and this price was still a lot higher.Lin Yan took out the bag of documents prepared early in the morning by Luo Mo and gave it to the other party. \u201cThis is the contract we have drawn up in advance and the transfer fee has clearly been filled out. Manager Wang, you can take a look at it. If you feel there are any problems with the specific regulations before the start of the transfer period, you can contact my assistant at any time.\u201dManager Wang unthinkingly reached out to take it. It obviously hadn\u2019t been finalized yet but this type of dialogue made him feel the transaction had been completed.Lin Yan glanced at the time and stood up from the sofa. \u201cLet\u2019s end it here today. I will go back first.\u201dHe knew very well that his actions today seemed a bit whimsical but he had no intention of answering the other person\u2019s shock. Compared with this extra investment of more than 10 million, the additional benefits brought by the words \u2018maximum transfer fee\u2019 were far greater for his newly established club.Promotion and word-of-mouth, he was betting on this.An imperceptible smile appeared on Lin Yan\u2019s face at the thought. Moreover, he hoped the BK Club\u2019s management could still laugh after reading the terms of his contract.Jing Yuanzhou saw that Lin Yan was about to leave and stood up immediately. \u201cI\u2019ll send you.\u201dKu Tianlu had been acting as an invisible person to the side and he had been shocked by the stunning offer just now.At this time, he instinctively wanted to follow. Before he could stand up, he was blocked by the look in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere is still a training match today. It is time to prepare.\u201dKu Tianlu suddenly froze in place. \u201cHuh?\u201d***On the way out, no one spoke for a while. Luo Mo smartly followed them from 10 steps away, maintaining a certain distance.Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou walked in tandem like this and the shadows of the two people stretched out in the empty corridor. It wasn\u2019t until the entrance was approaching that Jing Yuanzhou suddenly opened his mouth. \u201cWhy me?\u201d35 million wasn\u2019t a small number. It could be imagined the type of uproar it would cause once this came out.There was no doubt about his strength but there were far more gods than just him in the league. Compared to him, an \u2018old player\u2019 who was about to retire, the younger generation in high spirits would obviously be a better choice.Lin Yan stopped and looked over with a puzzled expression. \u201cDoes this still need to be asked?\u201dHis back was to the light so Lin Yan seemed to be coated with layers of soft light. On his shadowed face, the curve of his mouth could clearly be seen and he took a half true and half false attitude. \u201cOf course, it is because you are expensive!\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEven God Jing never expected such an answer.However, Lin Yan was obviously very satisfied with his business strategy. \u201cAs the saying goes, you get what you pay for. There isn\u2019t a good end for those who are greedy and cheap. In any case, the value of God Jing is there. As the most expensive man in the league, almost every cell in my body has awakened its desire.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was silent.What desire? The desire to spend money?Lin Yan felt there was still something left to do. In the end, he didn\u2019t forget to praise his wisdom in his heart. Tsk, he was really a logical and clever individual! He glanced over at Jing Yuanzhou and gradually controlled his smile. \u201cGod Jing, I know you actually don\u2019t want to transfer but I still hope you will seriously consider GH\u2019s invitation.\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised his eyebrow. \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t want to transfer?\u201d\u201cEveryone knows what you mean to BK but few people have thought about what BK means to you.\u201d Lin Yan spoke indifferently. \u201cStill, listen to my words. As a human, sometimes you shouldn\u2019t be so wronged. The newcomer in your team is indeed very strong. In two years, he might be able to take your place. However, right now, he really isn\u2019t qualified. BK\u2019s management aren\u2019t human and want to wrong you to escort the newcomer as a substitute. Are you really willing to sacrifice the last years of your career to be the man behind the glory of the entire team?\u201dJing Yuanzhou had to admit that Lin Yan knew far more about the inside story than he had imagined.The content just mentioned couldn\u2019t be ignored and his lips curved up with great interest. \u201cWhat about GH? Chief Lin, as the boss behind GH, what can you give to me beside the signing bonus?\u201d\u201cIs it enough if I give myself to you?\u201d Lin Yan didn\u2019t blink and his tone was serious. \u201cI can guarantee that GH is definitely different from BK. As long as you want. I will stand behind you, supporting you in fulfilling your ideals on the field. Doesn\u2019t it sound particularly touching?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was silent for a moment. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say this.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t answer in a hurry. Trust me, you will need it.\u201d Lin Yan didn\u2019t mind such a straightforward refusal and he even understood it. \u201cOf course, I know what you are worried about. After all, GH is just a newly established team. It has no members and no league quota. We aren\u2019t eligible to participate even if we want to play in the secondary league. From any point of view, we are indeed not worthy of the identity Titans.\u201dJing Yuanzhou listened calmly as this person disparaged his team as worthless. Sure enough, the conversation changed.\u201cHowever, I can assure you that GH will obtain the team qualification issued by the league in the shortest possible time and you will stand on the professional league field again. It is estimated that in the next two days, you will know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201dLin Yan\u2019s mouth curved up and he held Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s shoulders like a brother. \u201cIn any case, God Jing, the door of our GH is open to you at any time. Let that shit newcomer go to hell! Creating a brand-new team, isn\u2019t such a condition exciting? You are obviously a tiger. Why shrink and pretend to be a good person in a place like BK? During the transfer period, I am waiting for you!\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze fell into the hand on his shoulder. The slender fingers were beautiful and delicate.He lowered his eyes slightly. \u201cIf it is as you say then I will think about it carefully.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the last two days of training games, Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t play. He sat on the sofa next to the training room, his eyes on the big screen of the match. The thing that came to mind were the words Lin Yan had said in the hotel.In recent years, the BK team had performed well in the league. The addition of several new members made the new battle mode seem to operate very smoothly. Even the media said that if it wasn\u2019t for the team battle error in the final round of the finals, it might be possible to win another championship trophy. Many people regretted it but few people knew that this seemingly accidental mistake was the huge danger hidden inside BK.The rapid growth of young players meant the current BK coaching staff gradually couldn\u2019t keep up. In fact, there were already huge mistakes in the BP link of that game. First was the failure to pre-empt the core hero that would restrict the opponent\u2019s tactical system and second was the key hero taken by the other side in the middle of the selection. It was destined to be a very tough game before the game even started.Everyone only saw the glowing players in front of the stage but often overlooked the importance of the coaching staff. Once the balance between the light in front of the stage and the shadow behind the scenes was completely broken, it was tantamount to pushing a team to the edge of a steep and crumbling cliff.It was precisely due to this that the originally hesitant BK management finally made a decision after the match. They would promote the second team player Lan Min to the first time and he would jointly take the side lane position with Jing Yuanzhou.Lan Min was promoted from the youth training team by Jing Yuanzhou himself. In nominal terms, it was a mentor-student relationship. The teenager who just turned 18 was at the peak of his career and it was the best age to become famous in one fell swoop.Jing Yuanzhou was a professional side lane player with a reputation in the league. His personal strength was naturally beyond doubt but at the age of 23, he was destined to be unable to fight too long in this arena.One was the near-retired god of war and the other was a rising star. After repeated calculations, BK\u2019s management decided to put their bargaining chip on Lan Min to fight for a bright future for the club.As for Jing Yuanzhou, these were the original words of Manager Wang. \u201cTitans, you have obtained the highest glory that all professional players envy. You should consider your future. After all, the physical consumption of a professional career on the body is huge. Appropriately reducing the number of appearances is also conducive to maintaining the best condition. Now there are so many sunspots on the Internet and an occasional mistake in the game can be amplified in various ways. It isn\u2019t worth it if it leaves a stain on your career. Now Lan Min has been promoted as a main candidate and it is just to share more of the burden with you. In this way, once the time comes to officially bid farewell to the game, you can leave the fans with a perfect Titans. It is good for everyone.\u201dThe words were very euphemistic and the implicit meaning was also clear.Obviously, the club\u2019s executives were determined to raise Lan Min up. On the other hand, they didn\u2019t want to list Jing Yuanzhou for a transfer. The best result was for him to stay and escort Lan Min\u2019s road to fame while continuing to be a strong backing for BK at the critical moment. This would consume the rest of his career.To put it bluntly, it was to play on the side bench.BK\u2019s management had started the countdown ahead of time for his retirement. Jing Yuanzhou knew how much of a disturbance he would cause if he was listed to be transferred but there was one thing BK got really wrong about him.The glory and fame accumulated over the years were worthless to him. The thing he really loved was the bloody, competitive battlefield.Jing Yuanzhou leaned against the sofa for a while and felt an uncomfortable feeling in his mouth. He saw that the first training match was officially over so he pulled out a cigarette from his trouser pocket, opened the door and walked out.Lan Min\u2019s eyes were a bit red. He stared at Jing Yuanzhou and looked like he wanted to speak but didn\u2019t know where to start. Jing Yuanzhou glanced at him and sighed in his heart. \u201cDo you know?\u201dSuch words entered his eyes and Lan Min instantly tensed. \u201cMaster, tell me that what they said isn\u2019t true!\u201dJing Yuanzhou had reminded him many times not to call himself \u2018Master\u2019 but the teenager attached great importance to the person who recognized his worth and taught him. Lan Min always looked to follow behind Jing Yuanzhou like a tail and this title couldn\u2019t be changed.For Lan Min, the existence of Titans was faith and the only light on his career path. The moment he learned he would be promoted to an official player, he was so excited that he couldn\u2019t sleep for several days. Even though there was a high probability that he would continue to be a substitute for Jing Yuanzhou when entering the team, this was a matter of supreme honor for Lan Min.However, just now, someone actually told him that they wanted to make him the starting side lane player of BK in the next game If he became the starter then what about Titans? Would he be on the bench?Lan Min felt it was completely unacceptable. He knew his strength very well. He wasn\u2019t worthy nor was he qualified.Jing Yuanzhou looked down at the young man who might cry at any time and felt a bit of a headache. There was silence for a moment and he quietly extinguished the cigarette butt.Seeing that Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t deny it, Lan Min\u2019s eyes became completely wet. \u201cSomething must be wrong! How can Master be my substitute? I\u2019ll go to Manager Wang and tell him that I don\u2019t have this strength. I\u2019ll be transferred back to the second team! I know very well my value. You can\u2019t because of me\u2026\u201dHe was too anxious to speak and turned around in a daze, only to be pulled back by the collar.Jing Yuanzhou directly brought the teenager back like he was a chicken and watched this boy speechlessly. \u201cWhen will you change this temperament? How can you fight in the side lane if you hold back so much?\u201dLan Min pressed his lips together tightly and controlled his sobbing. \u201cH-However, I really can\u2019t accept it!\u201dHe reached out and wiped his face. Then he stared at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cMaster, you are so strong. Being in a substitute position is simply\u2026 like a flower stuck in cow dung!\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth twitched slightly.He didn\u2019t correct this lame metaphor. He just raised his fingers to signal for Lan Min to stand still and leaned back against the wall. \u201cIn short, you should do whatever the club arranges. You don\u2019t need to care about other things. It isn\u2019t something that you can control. Get rid of your bad emotions. You are the one I picked out from the youth training team. Showing such a bad appearance to others is shameful.\u201dLan Min\u2019s face completely twisted and screwed up as he tried to control his mood. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t like to coax children and he frowned slightly. \u201cIn addition, when did I say I would be a substitute for you?\u201dLan Min suddenly looked up, a complicated emotion flashing in his eyes. He vaguely captured the deep meaning of this sentence but he couldn\u2019t ask. He couldn\u2019t say that he had never thought of the possibility of Jing Yuanzhou transferring. However, once he heard it personally, it gave off an entirely different feeling.It was undeniable that transferring to another club to continue sweeping through the league was better than staying as a substitute for this yellow-haired teenager. Then Lan Min thought about how he was \u2018squeezing away\u2019 Jing Yuanzhou and his mentality instantly collapsed. \u201cOr should I go back to the second team? In fact, I really don\u2019t want to be a starter at all!\u201dIt had to be said that this young man\u2019s lie was really too clumsy. Jing Yuanzhou heard it and couldn\u2019t help chuckling. Soldiers who said they didn\u2019t want to go to the battlefield weren\u2019t good soldiers. Similarly, what professional player didn\u2019t want to start?BK\u2019s management might be a bit unkind but there was one thing that was true. If he continued to occupy this starting position, wouldn\u2019t Lan Min have to wait until he retired? The career of a professional player might not be able to withstand these two years.He had seen Lan Min come up from the youth training time with his own eyes. Lan Min was skilled enough for the management to take such a big risk to promote him to the first time. This was enough to show that the potential of this teenager was unlimited.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that I was strong and wherever I go is just dealing out abuse?\u201d Jing Yuanzhou reached out to touch the golden hair and joked. \u201cYou are different. You finally got such a good opportunity. There is no store if you don\u2019t pass this village. Don\u2019t cry if you regret it in the future.\u201dLan Min\u2019s mouth was stiff. \u201cI won\u2019t regret it and I won\u2019t cry!\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled without saying anything.After such a conversation, the heart knot in Lan Min was loosened a lot. He was still reluctant but after a moment of silence, he hesitantly asked, \u201cSo Master, are you\u2026 have you already figured out where you are going?\u201dA figure emerged in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mind and his mouth curved up higher. \u201cProbably.\u201dBefore Lan Min could say anything, he straightened up slowly. \u201cOkay, the training match isn\u2019t over yet. Don\u2019t pester me outside and go back in.\u201dLan Min immediately stood in a military posture. \u201cYes, Master!\u201dThe two of them returned to the training room and found the other players gathered around a table and looking at something. Just now, Lan Min ran out with red eyes. Everyone knew it was because of what was happening. They were relieved to see him come back a lot calmer and tacitly didn\u2019t mention it.Ku Tianlu beckoned to them, \u201cCaptain, Mini, come and see. Our e-sports league actually wants to do a variety show! Do you think the official people of the league are crazy? They dare to do anything. Are they ready to drive e-sports into the entertainment industry?\u201dLan Min had already jumped over and he was stunned when he clearly saw the content on the page. \u201cE-sports show? What is this?\u201dKu Tianlu replied, \u201cWho knows?\u201dThe support laughed. \u201cDidn\u2019t you read the comments below? It is said that the league wants to form an e-sports team. When it comes to the game, there is no need to play. Instead, they will rely on their face to dominate the league fans.\u201dThe marksman looked disapproving. \u201cE-sports should always speak with strength. Isn\u2019t it funny to choose a team of fancy vases?\u201dLan Min retorted, \u201cNo one stipulates that you can\u2019t look good and be strong? Look at Master! He is a handsome and talented man standing at the top of the e-sports field!\u201dEveryone was used to Lan Min\u2019s exaggerated praise of Titans and after a moment of silence, they all clapped cooperatively. \u201cThis wave of speech is brilliant!\u201dKu Tianlu smiled as he watched the kids playing around. Then he noticed that Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t spoken and asked half-jokingly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you interested in this type of variety show?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting.\u201dKu Tianlu had been following Jing Yuanzhou for so long, causing him to choke after hearing this sentence. \u201c?\u201dThis wasn\u2019t like the Titans he knew. Fuck, there was definitely a situation!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Burning Hot official Weibo published the official announcement of the \u2018Burning Hot Assembly\u2019 show, it was instantly topped by fans in the hot search. In a short period of time, the official Weibo comments area was completely occupied.[Is there a mistake? There aren\u2019t many world champions and some of them belong to the first group\u2014?][Doing a variety show where the winning team is directly qualified to enter the professional league? Then why work hard in the secondary league?][Tell a joke: A group of pretty boys playing e-sports. Hehehe.][Looking at the meaning of the official announcement, what type of messy teams will participate? Is it a group of chickens pecking at each other?][Pecking and pecking, who is better than everyone else?][Evil capitalism. Sure enough, the e-sports circle can\u2019t avoid being corrupted.][I will put it here. This variety show that dabbles in the circle will become paste.][Top person, black-boned chicken and Japanese Spanish mackerel!]Lin Yan picked a comfortable posture and lay on the couch. He almost sank into it as he read the comments on the official Weibo with great interest. Just look at this heat. This variety show would definitely be popular.He faintly heard the sound of the door opening. He looked up and caught a glimpse of Luo Mo hurrying in. \u201cHow about it? What did the program team say?\u201dLuo Mo had just made a trip to the League Headquarters and his entire body was surrounded by the heat of the sun.At this time, he couldn\u2019t even drink a mouthful of water. He immediately handed over the information in his hands. \u201cI asked them. As long as our sponsorship funds are in place, there is no big problem with the quota. The main thing is that we should have the list of team players as soon as possible. It must be done before the show starts to build momentum at the latest.\u201dThe variety show was different from the professional league. It was still in the capital market and as long as enough money was invested, it wasn\u2019t surprising that a place could be successfully obtained.Lin Yan raised his eyebrow when he heard the second part. \u201cWhy? Are you afraid that we can\u2019t get together a team?\u201dLuo Mo cleared his throat and didn\u2019t answer. They were currently located in the GH Club base that had just been constructed. According to Lin Yan\u2019s requirements, the decorations and furnishings all showed off a wealthy style. It was just a pity that it was empty and not popular.The two of them stood here and gazed at each other speechlessly. Lin Yan was more like a commander who was just talk.Lin Yan read Luo Mo\u2019s complicated mood from the sudden silence and cleared his throat. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. The transfer period hasn\u2019t started yet. Once the transfer window opens, won\u2019t a lot of bigshots pick us?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Luo Mo felt a little deaf and quickly changed the topic. \u201cThere is no need to hurry with other people but you have to urge God Jing. If you can\u2019t dig him over then you have to quickly consider other candidates. The people of the program team said that each team needs to have a coach and a captain as the team leader. These two places needed to be determined as soon as possible and submitted.\u201dLin Yan casually said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just fill in my name as the coach and the captain will be Jing Yuanzhou. As for the other procedures, wait until the transfer window is over.\u201d\u201cHowever, God Jing\u2019s side\u2026\u201d doesn\u2019t seem to have agreed?His gaze lingered on the yelled head for a moment before he typed: [God Jing, if you have time, do you want to visit the base of your future club?]Perhaps Jing Yuanzhou was holding his phone at the time but the reply was received instantly. [Yes, send me the address.]Oh, he promised so readily! Lin Yan smiled with satisfaction. His fingertips tapped out some words as he skillfully completed the input and sent it.After a while, Jing Yuanzhou asked him: [You brought the BOD base?]Lin Yan had nothing to do so he simply chatted with the other person. [Yes, it is too troublesome to re-select a site. In any case, there is a ready-made one. It is more convenient to buy and redecorate.]The development of e-sports meant there were more and more products of survival of the fittest every year. Everyone knew how difficult it was for a team in the secondary league to enter the top professional league. However, in fact, there were teams that were eliminated even after officially entering the professional league.For example, the BOD Club that officially announced its disbandment this year.Lin Yan thought this great god was caring about his future living environment and added: [Are you dissatisfied with BOD\u2019s previous old-fashioned style? Don\u2019t worry, we have redecorated. It is definitely more stylish than BK.]In saying so, he leaned back in an exaggerated posture, took a photo and sent it to the other person.In the BK lounge, Jing Yuanzhou opened the photo that was just sent but his mind wasn\u2019t on the decorating style with a strong sense of technology. His eyes stayed on the face in the photo for a moment. He didn\u2019t reply and directly sent a voice call invitation.Lin Yan hadn\u2019t expected Jing Yuanzhou to be so \u2018active.\u2019 The man\u2019s excessively seductive voice appeared in Lin Yan\u2019s mind and the hand holding the mobile phone shook uncomfortably.Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck, this homosexual man was mistaking people!Jing Yuanzhou waited a while but the call wasn\u2019t connected. He frowned and was about to hang up when the other side finally pressed the confirmation button.Lin Yan\u2019s voice came through the communication device and it sounded lazy and casual. \u201cGod Jing, what\u2019s the matter? Is there any problem with the transfer contract I gave?\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed. \u201cThere are such good conditions. How can there be any problems?\u201dHe had already seen the transfer contract left on that day. No matter the conditions, this was the highest treatment that could be given in the league.On behalf of the BK Club, Manager Wang had wanted to keep him. He originally went to see the contact but came out with his chest covered. There was no other reason. The focus was the only special clause that required no modification.Since the Burning Hot League had started, the transfer fee had soared from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions. The rising currency couldn\u2019t be ruled out but it was enough to see the development prospects of e-sports.This was followed by several adjustments to specific rules. According to the current official regulations of the league, after the listing transaction was completed during the transfer period, a part of the transfer fee would be given to the original club and the other part would be regarded as the basic signing fee for the professional player.As for the specific ratio, most of the time it defaulted to the 7:3 split. Of course, some clubs had a special conscience when dealing with old players who decisively played for the team and occasionally a 6:4 situation occurred.The terms would clearly be marked in the three way transfer contract but the specific division ratio was usually a matter of negotiation between the old team and the player. There was no need for the new boss who acquired the player to worry too much about it.However, in the contract that GH provided to the BK Club this time, the sharing ratio had clearly been filled out. It wasn\u2019t 7:3 or 6:4 but an unprecedented 3:7. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s basic signing fee accounted for 70% of the transfer fee.What was this concept? It meant that despite the sky high price of 35 million yuan, the profit obtained by the BK Club wouldn\u2019t even offset the initial 18 million yuan income commission under normal circumstances.It was right that Lin Yan didn\u2019t ask Manager Wang to look at the transfer contract in person at that time. Jing Yuanzhou suspected that if it was put forward, Manager Wang might really choose to fight hard.Now that the people of GH had already left, Manager Wang was faced with this horrifying contract and the only person he could negotiate with was Jing Yuanzhou. If it was said to Lin Yan then Manager Wang could use the excuse of fighting for the best treatment for his player. However, in front of Jing Yuanzhou, he wouldn\u2019t be able to speak.The team\u2019s sudden promotion of a new player would undoubtedly offend Titans\u2019 huge fanbase. At this time, if the matter of the team forcing a modification of the transfer fee sharing clause was disclosed, the blame of harsh treatment would undoubtedly be placed on the team. Once their reputation fell, the series of consequences would be hard to estimate.BK couldn\u2019t take this risk. Therefore, unless Jing Yuanzhou himself clearly stated that he wouldn\u2019t go to GH, BK\u2019s management could only accept this loss no matter their resentment. No matter how one looked at it, GH\u2019s approach had the meaning of \u2018buying people\u2019s hearts.\u2019Previously, Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t quite understood why Lin Yan wanted him so much. Then he saw the news about the league\u2019s e-sports variety show and he understood it instantly. GH wanted to get the qualification for the professional league from this variety show and the best candidate for captain was indeed Jing Yuanzhou.A phenomenon-level player like Jing Yuanzhou, who had accumulated a reputation over the years, had a public opinion effect that was far beyond the young players just starting out. Once the variety show started, the name Titans alone would make this controversial show attract attention.Combined with the follow-up gimmick of \u2018highest transfer fee in the league\u2019 to build momentum, it was basically foreseeable the bloody storm that would be caused after the list was published.Jing Yuanzhou thought up to here and chuckled.The operation of reverse bargaining might indeed seem crazy but it was actually paving the way for all the roads behind it in one fell swoop. This could be called an extremely shrewd business decision.Based on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s attitude, Lin Yan guessed that the other side had received this \u2018great gift\u2019 from him. He smiled lazily and tacitly changed the subject. \u201cIf it has nothing to do with the contract, does Captain Jing want to cultivate our feelings in advance?\u201dJing Yuanzhou had become used to this person\u2019s uninhibited manner of speaking and got straight to the point. \u201cSince you bought the BOD base, didn\u2019t you think of taking over their players as well?\u2019According to his understanding of Lin Yan after several encounters, Lin Yan would definitely give him a thorough understanding of other players, if there were any, in order to fight to get him to join. Since there had been no mention until now, it was obvious that he hadn\u2019t accepted any of the BOD players.The star players of BOD had transferred as early as two years ago but the remaining players were also professional players. For a club that was just starting out like GH, the opportunity to buy a team could be called a golden opportunity.However, Lin Yan seemed completely unmoved. This was something that most people wouldn\u2019t understand. As a result, Lin Yan\u2019s simple and rude sentence directly solved all of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s doubts. \u201cOf course, it is because they are too weak!\u201dJing Yuanzhou was taken aback for a moment and then he almost laughed out loud. He didn\u2019t know how a club that didn\u2019t have any players could have such confidence to call professional players weak. Still, he had to admit that the rest of the people left in BOD were\u2026 pretty weak.Lin Yan\u2019s logic was still full. \u201cIf they could play a little bit then their club wouldn\u2019t have shut down. Why would I buy them? I can\u2019t let them kill my house again, right? Then won\u2019t I cry?\u201dJing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t control his mouth. \u201cYes, you are right.\u201dFor some reason, the low voice coming from the phone combined with a lazy of pampering and ambiguity made the eloquent Lin Yan suddenly fall silent.Jing Yuanzhou walked to the window and cast his gaze to the distant sky. \u201cWhat about me? BK replaced me because I am declining. Aren\u2019t you afraid?\u201dLin Yan chuckled. \u201cDon\u2019t joke around. If Titans is declining then I will eat all the keyboards in the club.\u201d\u201cAre you so certain?\u201dLin Yan changed to a comfortable position and buried himself in the sofa, his face full of willful confidence. \u201cLet me tell you this. The failure of BK\u2019s management to find your position at the peak of this club is their own problem. It has nothing to do with the player\u2019s state. Many things need to be done by the coach instead of assigning all the responsibility to the players. The worst thing is that BK isn\u2019t willing to take responsibility. Of course, some responsibilities really can\u2019t be afforded by people who are incapable. To put it bluntly, they can\u2019t do it themselves.\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised his eyebrow. \u201cOh? And you can do it?\u201dLin Yan smiled. \u201cCan I do it? Won\u2019t you know if you try it yourself?\u201dThe surroundings became quiet after he spoke. Lin Yan became conscious and scratched his face with his fingers. It seemed like he accidentally said something bad again?Then Jing Yuanzhou replied, \u201cProbably. I have tried it.\u201dLin Yan heard this and couldn\u2019t react for a while. \u201cHuh?\u2019\u201cNothing.\u201d Someone seemed to be coming to JIng Yuanzhou. There were some intermittent conversations and then his voice was heard again. \u201cI have something here. I will contact you this afternoon.\u201dLin Yan followed this person\u2019s direction very nimbly. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m waiting for you~!\u201dThe voice call was suddenly cut off.In the BK lounge, Ku Tianlu maintained the posture where he poked his head in and hesitated. \u201cIn fact, it isn\u2019t anything important. Or\u2026 Captain, you can talk a bit more?\u201dJing Yuanzhou put his phone back in his pocket. \u201cNo, let\u2019s go.\u201dKu Tianlu\u2019s gaze stayed on the suspicious blush that was faintly visible at the base of this man\u2019s ear and couldn\u2019t calm down for a long time.Who was the person on the other side of the phone? It was a pity that the captain had never spoken to him and his other teammates so tenderly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was like stepping into an independent e-sports country.It was no wonder that Lin Yan was satisfied with such a masterpiece. Such a base was indeed full of charm.After visiting the training hall and conference room one after another, they left Area A through the corridor and walked across the boulevard to the dormitory building reserved for players.Jing Yuanzhou was walking up the stairs when he passed by one of the rooms and suddenly stopped to look inside. \u201cYou\u2019ve been living here these few days?\u201dIt was unlike the other empty rooms that only had a few simple pieces of furniture. At first glance, he could see the laptop in standby mode and half a cup of coffee that probably wouldn\u2019t be finished in the future.\u201cYes, this room has a good view so I stayed in it first.\u201d Then Lin Yan\u2019s eyes curved meaningfully. \u201cOf course, as long as God Jing is willing to come then you can live wherever you want. All the rooms here are available for you to choose from. If you fancy this once, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll leave the room immediately and make a place for you on the spot.\u201dHe noticed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze on the messy bed and cleared his throat. \u201cI\u2019ve already slept there before. If you really want things clean, I can have Ah Mo change to another bed.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cIt is definitely better if we don\u2019t need to change the bed! In fact, there is no need to change it. I\u2019ve only slept there for a few days and I\u2019m not dirty, right?\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at Lin Yan and his lips curved upward. \u201cThis, I probably don\u2019t really know.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDid he take advantage of this person?\u201cHowever, I meant that you don\u2019t need to make room for me.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou glanced at Lin Yan\u2019s rare appearance of being choked up and was in a good mood. He shifted his gaze to the room on the opposite side. \u201cThe decorations here are good and it is just opposite here. This one is fine.\u201dLin Yan poked his head into the room behind Jing Yuanzhou and smiled brightly. \u201cIndeed, it is good to be neighbours. Remember to tell me when you\u2019re going to move and I will let Ah Mo pick you up. The bag check-in will be convenient and worry-free.\u201dNo one explicitly said it but it was obvious that such words showed a tacit acquiesce to the transfer.Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the time. \u201cWhat is the next arrangement?\u201dLin Yan smiled mysteriously. \u201cCome with me.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had taken a half-day leave for the afternoon and there was nothing to do, so he followed Lin Yan back to Area A. Lin Yan walked all the way to the training room and casually turned on a computer.The number of viewers was 8,723 and it wasn\u2019t even 10,000. This was apparently a newcomer who had just recently started.Currently, the interface was shocking the Burning Hot Ladder Ranking Tournament. A ranking beyond 100 might not be a big deal in the eyes of professional players but it was a good result for a passerby.Jing Yuanzhou knew that Lin Yan wouldn\u2019t pull him to watch a live broadcast for no reason. He chose a leisurely posture and leaned on the gaming chair as he watched Lin Yan\u2019s movements with interest.Lin Yan completed the account recharge very quickly. He moved his fingers a bit and then rows of shining worlds popped up on the interface.[Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Gloy Who is Trying to Become Stronger.][Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Gloy Who is Trying to Become Stronger.][Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Gloy Who is Trying to Become Stronger.]According to the platform\u2019s reward system, one deep-water fish mine was worth 100R. It was 10 with each throw so it was 1,000 each time.The originally peaceful comments of the live broadcast room was suddenly completely filled by these rewards.[Fuck, who is this? A local tyrant!][Watching a gold master tyrant, is this to support our little GG?][I seem to see a golden light on my screen.][If this isn\u2019t love~][After watching the live broadcast for so long, I suddenly feel like all my actions have been in vain?][Isn\u2019t this ID a female?

He was slightly surprised for a moment but it didn\u2019t affect the operation of his hand at all. He neatly completed a wave of three kills before opening his mouth with a bit of excitement. \u201cThank you Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess for the deep-water fish mine.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t quite used to encountering this situation during the live broadcast. A bit of time passed before he added in a low voice, \u201cThank you for your support.\u201dLin Yan saw this shy expression and couldn\u2019t help laughing.He continued to throw the deep-water mines for a while before leaning back and looking at Jing Yuanzhou behind him. \u201cHey, this is the new child I\u2019ve taken a fancy to. Help me advise him?\u201dJing Yuanzhou had already guessed it. He reviewed the operation just now and objectively said, \u201cBased on the wave of three kills, he is really good at seizing opportunities. However, this type of passerby game ranked outside the 100s can\u2019t have too many problems.\u201dLin Yan naturally knew what Jing Yuanzhou meant.In this 5V5 team battle game, personal strength was indeed very important but teamwork was even more fundamental. It was the reason why many passerby kings in the ranking ladder couldn\u2019t play professionally. In terms of Gloy\u2019s current ladder rankings, he couldn\u2019t even be called a passerby king. The information that could be seen from half a game was indeed very limited.Lin Yan also deeply agreed with this and was prepared. Seeing that Gloy had just finished a match, he grabbed the keyboard beside him and told Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cWait, let\u2019s change the method.\u201dOn the screen, the ID \u2018Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess\u2019 sent several messages in a row with a gleaming gold ID of a local rich tyrant.\u201d [Little brother, do you play doubles? Can you choose to bring me. I\u2019m super sweet~ cute.JPG.]Jing Yuanzhou saw the words \u2018little brother\u2019 and stared deeply at Lin Yan\u2019s back. Gloy had just been about to continue after a round of qualifying. Then he saw the financial backer\u2019s words and hesitated for a moment. \u201cI can take you but I haven\u2019t made another account yet\u2026\u201dThe Burning Hot ranking mechanism had a rank limit. If the level difference between two accounts was too big then they weren\u2019t allowed to form a team together. Gloy\u2019s current ranking was 145. Anyone who wanted to team up with him needed to be at least 200.He thought about it and tentatively suggested, \u201cOr do you want to play a matching battle?\u201dAfter all, this was his female financial backer. He had to meet reasonable requirements.However, Lin Yan had no interest in matching and quickly posted a barrage. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I have an account. Wait for me. I\u2019ll add you straight away!]Gloy didn\u2019t have time to react to what was happening when he saw a friend request pop up on the game interface. The game ID was Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess and the ladder ranking was 198. He was surprised for a moment before clicking on the confirmation button. The two people completed a team and entered the queue.The barrage in the live broadcast room was frantically scrolling because of the dazzling rank of the financial backer. Lin Yan had no interest in the barrage after completing his goal. He was too lazy to look at it and closed the web page.He took advantage of the time when both sides were choosing a hero to take out a mint from the drawer next to him. He stuffed one in his mouth and casually handed it to Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cTry it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou took it and glanced at the ban and pick interface on the game screen. \u201cDid you play the rankings yourself?\u201dLin Yan looked over. \u201cWhy? It doesn\u2019t look like it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou opened the packaging of the mint candy and smiled. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge a person by their appearance.\u201dLin Yan smiled with unprecedented modesty. \u201cThank you, God Jing for the praise. You\u2019re laughing at me, laughing at me.\u201dHe saw that he had entered the map and took his attention back. Sometimes, being part of the game together allowed one to observe their teammates more intuitively. When it came time to choose a hero, Lin Yan had just \u2018fill in the empty position\u2019 without any desire for victory.His teammates weren\u2019t polite. They grabbed the hero they wanted to take and finally left him with the support position. After buying support equipment at the beginning of the game, Lin Yan walked slowly behind Gloy\u2019s ass toward the middle lane. Every time there was a version change, the game play was also adjusted accordingly.Lin Yan was currently using the most popular quick-raising the middle lane method. He helped Gloy eat at the soldiers and assisted with a frontal \u2018battle\u2019 against the opponent.Gloy had been worried about the gaming experience of this financial backer sister so he didn\u2019t let Lin Yan work too hard. The moment he got to level 3 and his third skill lit up, his suddenly showed off.The four major skills hadn\u2019t been activated yet but he took the lead to actively take the head of the opponent\u2019s mid-laner.The first drop of blood in every game gave an additional economic bonus and a gap formed in the middle lane. Gloy took advantage of this early stage to open the snowball mode and crushed the entire field to win.There was no double about the MVP of this game. Presumably, he found it was quite easy to rank with this financial backer. The moment he came out of the game, he took the initiative to send a message to Lin Yan: [Little sister, do you still want to play?]Oh? Little sister? Lin Yan saw that the other side actually identified him as a sister. He smiled and thought about it, but he didn\u2019t deny it. He thought that he needed to collect more game information so there was naturally no reason to refuse. He continued to join the queue.Lin Yan was eating his mint while worrying that Jing Yuanzhou would be bored. He asked very intimately, \u201cGod Jing, do you want to play?\u201d\u201c\u2026You feel free.\u201dIt was rare to have half a day free. He didn\u2019t have the self-abuse habit of extra training. They lined up, completed the matching, entered the game, won\u2026 and lined up again. Before they knew it, the two of them had spent an afternoon playing doubles.Since they were matched to different teammates in every game, Lin Yan was a supplementing position professional and played a supporter, side-laner, shooter and even jungler. Finally, Gloy finished the live broadcast and Lin Yan closed the client without any attachment.He carefully sorted out all the video materials and tilted his head back. \u201cHow is this kid?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t known what Jing Yuanzhou was thinking but he seemed a bit distracted. After a moment, he asked, \u201cWhy not play professionally?\u201dLin Yan thought seriously about the question. \u201cProbably because he hasn\u2019t met a good judge of talent like me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about you.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dJing Yuanzhou stared at him. \u201cLin Yan, haven\u2019t you ever thought about playing professionally?\u201dHe said Lin Yan, not Chief Lin.Lin Yan was leaning back while talking to Jing Yuanzhou. He was stunned when he heard this sentence and slowly turned around the gaming chair. \u201cGuess?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHis attitude made it seem that he wasn\u2019t surprised by Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s suggestion. Jing Yuanzhou watched Lin Yan and could only think of one possibility. \u201cHave other clubs invited you?\u201dLin Yan cocked his head to look at the other person. \u201cLittle brother, look at the mess I played just now. Besides you, who else would invite me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou took out a cigarette, directly placed it in his mouth and didn\u2019t answer.Was it messy? Indeed, for the entire afternoon, Lin Yan had played in a different position almost every game and seemed to be a pure hoodlum. However, someone who paid close attention would find that each hero\u2019s choice could always quietly make up for the biggest flaw in the team\u2019s lineup.Every time Lin Yan entered the game, he took the place of filling in the missing position. He gave priority to his teammates to choose the heroes and was often the last one to make a choice. This meant that every time a hero was taken, a decision was made in a few seconds after determining the lineup of both sides.After every game, it seemed like he never had the chance to get the MVP but thinking about it carefully, this teammate who seemed to have no sense of existence in the entire game would often make a quick decision in a crucial moment of the team battle to determine victory or defeat.Even Jing Yuanzhou wouldn\u2019t have found this if he hadn\u2019t been constantly observing from Lin Yan\u2019s perspective. Still, even without looking at these details, just being able to maintain the unsuccessful existence in every round was already a scary thing to think about.You know, players doing the ranking ladder often chose their best heroes. Lin Yan\u2019s ability to \u2018peacefully develop\u2019 with the opponent\u2019s players in any position while passively filling out this position proved that he had sufficient insight into the attributes of these heroes.There were no more than 10 people in the Burning Hot League, including Jing Yuanzhou, who could do this. This was already a very surprising number.Jing Yuanzhou was suddenly curious about Lin Yan\u2019s serious attitude. If he really chose the position he was best at and the most skilled hero, what would he be like?He knew very well that Lin Yan wasn\u2019t short of money but how many people really entered the professional league purely for money? The willingness to spend so much money to establish a club was enough to show his yearning for the field of e-sports. On the premise of having sufficient strength, why didn\u2019t he become a professional player?Lin Yan faced such a straightforward and explicit gaze. He originally wanted to flirt but ended up changing it to a low cough. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. I will feel sorry.\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought it was a bit novel. \u201cThere is actually a time when Chief Lin feels embarrassed?\u201dLin Yan stared at this face for a while and smiled. \u201cIn the face of a man like Captain Jing, how many people can maintain absolute calm?\u201d\u201cThen can you impulsively satisfy my curiosity?\u201dLin Yan blinked. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s nothing. I simply feel that it is better for me to be a coach behind the scenes than a professional player.\u201dJing Yuanzhou wondered, \u201cYou want to be the coach?\u201dHe obviously hadn\u2019t expected Lin Yan to think so. You know, most coaches often made this choice because they weren\u2019t strong enough to meet professional standards or they were professional players about to retire.\u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t it good to be a coach.\u201d Lin Yan\u2019s lips curved up lazily. \u201cThe glory on the stage is certainly attractive but there must always be someone standing behind it, isn\u2019t that right God Jing?\u201dNaturally, no one had a deeper understanding of a coach\u2019s importance to the club than Jing Yuanzhou. After all, the beginning of BK\u2019s collapse began quietly from the moment when the coaching staff couldn\u2019t keep up with the rhythm.He casually tapped on the mouse a few times and played a video. Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t continue the topic. He glanced at the computer screen and evaluated, \u201cHe is very strong but is a bit too independent.\u201dThe word \u2018independent\u2019 wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing in the professional league.It could mean that the individual strength was outstanding and this was enough to complete the carry in the field without the support of teammates. On the other hand, it could also be understood as being too selfish, easily disconnected from the team and too low in team integration.Once, Jing Yuanzhou was ridiculed by the e-sports media as an excessively \u2018independent\u2019 man. The BK team had just been reorganized that year and the other newcomers in the team were unable to keep up with his pace. The team was out of touch with each other during the match.Anyone with a little knowledge of this period of history knew that for Jing Yuanzhou, the word \u2018independent\u2019 had a special meaning.However, Lin Yan nodded in satisfaction after hearing the words. He took out a pen and wrote something down in his notebook. \u201cTitans has the same opinion as me. I am very happy.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was silent for a moment. \u201cSuch a player isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing for a team.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Lin Yan gently tapped against the table with the tip of his pen and smiled at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cSometimes it is more difficult to make someone slow down and wait for his teammates to catch up then it is to improve and break through. Such sacrifices aren\u2019t something that everyone can do.\u201dJing Yuanzhou froze for a moment under such a soft and calm gaze.Then Lin Yan continued slowly. \u201cSince it is too difficult, why not let his teammates catch up with him?\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed. \u201cThat isn\u2019t an easy task.\u201dHe still remembered when he had just entered the league and was pushed to the top of the altar. Still, it was impossible for all the members of the team to be geniuses. They entered the semi-finals as a dark horse but the shortcomings in their lack of strength were completely revealed. During the team battle, the other teammates were unable to keep up with his rhythm. BK looked like loose sand on the field. After the match, the fans came to the official Weibo to say goodbye and stop being fans. The media reported that it was the most tragic turnover scene of the season.After that, the other members of BK actively tried to run in but the gap in their strength was like a deep ditch in front of them. The balance point was unable to be found and the coaching staff eventually decided that Jing Yuanzhou would change part of his style to match the rhythm of the team.Since then, the Titans on the field was no longer as sharp as he was in the beginning. On the other hand, it was precisely due to this reason that Jing Yuanzhou became the strongest pillar behind BK and the dynasty belonging to BK officially opened. This type of personal experience made Jing Yuanzhou aware of the difficulty of Lin Yan\u2019s understated words.However, Lin Yan obviously didn\u2019t think so.\u201cHow can I know if I don\u2019t try it?\u201d Lin Yan took out a form to fill in Gloy\u2019s name and once again looked at Jing Yuanzhou with a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t you think this kid\u2019s laning style is very similar to someone?\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought about it for a moment. \u201cIt is like me.\u201dHe might walk on the side lanes and this Gloy played the mid-lane but there was still a trace of his playing style. To be precise, it was his style when he first joined the league, unpolished edges and a biting cold wind.\u201cAs expected of TItans, your vision is really accurate. Gloy is your number one fan!\u201d Lin Yan flipped through his notebook and showed a page to Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cSince his strength has been recognized by God Jing, I\u2019ll consider him qualified for the interview. This is the child\u2019s WeChat. I\u2019m asking God Jing to issue a professional invitation on behalf of the club.\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter going around in such a big circle, this was originally what he wanted?\u201dHis lips slowly curved in a smile. \u201cChief Lin is really doing good business. Taking me from BK can also solve the recruitment problem of the other players?\u201dLin Yan showed a cheeky smile. \u201cYou came here so I can\u2019t waste it. I must make the best use of it!\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t say much and finally confirmed it again. \u201cYou\u2019ve decided?\u201dLin Yan pulled out a new mobile phone. \u201cUse the club\u2019s mobile phone.\u201d\u201cNo, use my own.\u201dLin Yan smiled and calmly took back his phone.Gloy\u2019s WeChat was added smoothly. The note \u2018I am Titans\u2019 attached to the application meant it was passed in seconds.As for the invitation to join GH, he agreed without hesitation.Jing Yuanzhou saw the sentence \u2018I\u2019m willing\u2019 sent by the other person and frowned slightly. He replied: [It isn\u2019t the BK team. Do you want to consider it carefully?\u201dGloy: [What about you, God Jing? Will you be there?]Jing Yuanzhou: [En.]Gloy: [There are no problems as long as you are there!]He seemed to be a diehard fan who was only a loyal fan of the player, not the specific team. Lin Yan happened to see such a sentence when he came over and he sighed emotionally. \u201cThe children these days are so cute!\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at him. \u201cChief Lin, don\u2019t you think this is like consuming my character to abduct a child?\u201dLin Yan raised an index finger. \u201cHow can you say it is like consuming your character? Being able to come to GH is clearly an accumulation of blessings.\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised his eyebrow noncommittally and reluctantly agreed with this statement. He lowered his head and fiddled with the phone before putting it back in his pocket. \u201cPlease contact Gloy for the specific signing of the contract.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cBy the way, I talked to him about this afternoon\u2019s live broadcast and there are some words he wants to convey to you.\u201dLin Yan took a cup and raised it to his lips. \u201cHmm?\u201dJing Yuanzhou told him, \u201cFinancial backer little sister, you are really super soft and cute. I look forward to the next time we formally meet!\u201dLin Yan spat out the mouthful of water he just drank and Jing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cThat is it.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe might\u2019ve followed Gloy around and given him exaggerated compliments all afternoon but how was this acting soft?!Jing Yuanzhou inexplicably felt that Lin Yan\u2019s deflated appearance was particularly cute and couldn\u2019t help taking another look. The cigarette hanging from his mouth swayed slightly as he got up from his chair. \u201cIt\u2019s late. I\u2019ll go back first.\u201dLin Yan also got up. \u201cThe transfer period will open in a few days. I will go to the BK Club to pick you up.\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought about it and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dLin Yan sent Jing Yuanzhou to the door and watched him leave before turning back around. He made a call to Luo Mo to arrange the signing procedures before rubbing his temples and sitting down on the sofa. He wasn\u2019t needed to carry anyone but an afternoon of ranking was really tiring.Lin Yan lay down and his eyes stared at the ceiling.In fact, according to the plot of the original novel, the time in which Gloy entered the professional league should be soon. A boy made of gold was always glowing and hot. It was just that he didn\u2019t sign with GH, a non-existent club, but BK\u2019s rival team LW.In the original novel, the BK Club had serious internal disagreements due to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s staying or leaving. By the time Gloy finally received an invitation from a professional team, Jing Yuanzhou had made the choice to retire early for the sake of the BK team\u2019s harmony.It was precisely this that made Gloy even more dissatisfied with BK.The once young teenager was polished and grew in the professional league, finally becoming the demon king of the mid-lane that made the world frightened. However, the teammates who couldn\u2019t keep up with him inevitably became a burden to Gloy. This made him repeat the mistake of Titans and he gradually dimmed under the aura of the original novel\u2019s protagonist.The lights at the top were faintly dazzling.Lin Yan glanced at the headphones that had been thrown aside since the start of the afternoon and reached out a hand to cover his eyes. However, his mouth curved up arrogantly.Indeed, who wouldn\u2019t want to enjoy the glory in front of the stage if possible? However, since he was destined to be unable to become a professional player, he would focus on this behind-the-scenes role and support everyone to become the most shining presence on the field.Jing Yuanzhou was right. Some things weren\u2019t so easy to achieve. But how would he know if he didn\u2019t try? It was when all the \u2018impossible\u2019 became \u2018possible\u2019 that it truly made people feel excited\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA few days later, the official Weibo of Burning Hot Assembly Show was officially created. At the same time, the list of all teams participating in the first episode of the program was released. It could be seen from this list that they were basically second-tier teams of the secondary league.Since QU, IBB and the other teams had repeatedly made it to the professional league as well as the newly relegated WAG and other powerful teams were listed, there was slightly less scolding than when news of the variety show was first released.For the club\u2019s fans, it was good that there was an extra chance to enter the professional league. In this list, there was one team that attracted a lot of attention for its uniqueness.[Where did GH come from? Has anyone heard of it?][I don\u2019t know! I checked and there doesn\u2019t seem to be relevant information at all.][What\u2019s the situation? There are so many sub-league teams. Isn\u2019t it good to give them a chance?][I don\u2019t know where this unregistered team came from. Are they related?][The people upstairs have less knowledge. For variety shows, one or two cannon fodder must be prepared. Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t be suitable to eliminate some teams in the first round.][Damn, upstairs brother made things clear!]Such discussions didn\u2019t last long.After all, no one was too interested in providing heat to an unknown small team. After strolling around in the comments area, most of the e-sports fans went to their own team\u2019s Weibo accounts to leave a message: [Brothers, you have lost your chance in the previous promotion. This variety show is simply an extra ticket. You must win it!]There was an uproar on the Internet for a while and fans of the sub-league were enthusiastic. Relatively speaking, fans of the major professional teams were calm. It was just a variety show of weak chickens pecking at each other. Why should they pay attention to it? It didn\u2019t matter to them anyway. It was better to look forward to the next transfer period.This determined if their team could get a good place in the professional league next season. In a way, this was also a fight!Finally, in the midst of the fans\u2019 expectations, the Burning Hot League officially opened the transfer period. The comments area under the official Weibos of major clubs were basically occupied.[Please UI, quickly dig up a reliable jungler and come back. Every time, the wild area is raising pigs for others!][NNN really isn\u2019t going to add new blood to the bottom lane this year?][Wow, there are many players listed this year. Hurry up and choose quickly!][BOD is being sold as a whole package? Congratulations, this old club has finally gone bankrupt!][Forget the useless BOD, do you want to buy a water dispenser by buying them? GIve TU a strong mid-laner!]It was already noisy but the third day after the transfer period opened, breaking news was disclosed and the entire gaming circle suddenly exploded. It was because the BK Club finally announced this year\u2019s listening and TItans\u2019 ID was shining.Everyone stared at the page on the computer screen and rubbed their eyes. Then they rubbed it again and it was only after repeated confirmations that they were sure it wasn\u2019t an illusion. Titans wanted to transfer?! All the BK fans felt that the sky was falling in their own home.The fans of other teams also made shocked faces but they were a bit calmer. They quickly ran to the official Weibo of their club and frantically wrote messages: BK listed Titans. Ahhhh, management should wake up quickly. Hurry up and grab God Jing ahhhhhh!]However, regardless of the fans\u2019 excitement, all the clubs are at all. How could they not know about a good opportunity like Titans being listed? Who wouldn\u2019t want to win him if they could? The problem was the price offered\u202635 million! Buying a player for one or two years of effectiveness at this price? Forget it, they couldn\u2019t afford it!Just as everyone was eagerly waiting to see where Titans would go, they finally received the news. The topic of #Titans official transfer to the GH Club# rushed to the top of the hot search list in minutes.Everyone was a bit confused when they first saw it. GH Club? Where did this come from? Why hadn\u2019t they heard of it before? It was only after a long time that some people finally reacted. For this name, they always felt there was a trace of\u2026 familiarity?Finally, someone inadvertently glanced at the team roster on the official Weibo of Burning Hot Assembly Show and felt bad.Damn? What the fuck???[Titans is bought by a third-rate team that came out of nowhere? What ghost story is this?!][Where did this club come from? They haven\u2019t participated in the secondary league right? They bought Titans to participate in the variety show?][Shy show! How do you feel about interviewing the teams of other talent shows?][Damn, what is going on? I suddenly have some expectations for this variety show?][I am an unshakeable Titans fan. I\u2019m crying. My God Jing went to a third-rate show. How can he be reduced to a comedian?!!][Hahaha, the upstairs brother is laughing at me. Comedians are fine.][I say, perhaps Titans is declining and BK\u2019s management took advantage of this to make a fortune?][I\u2019ll be straightforward. BK\u2019s management should collectively die! What is this? Squeezing out God Jing before using his residual heat? Is he a money making tool?][Why do the Jing fans have to suffer this grievance?]Some people were gossiping about the new team, some were questioning Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s transfer motives and some were greeting the BK management team\u2019s ancestral graves. The Internet had become completely noisy overnight.Lin Yan didn\u2019t bother paying attention to this. He had Luo Mo handle the transfer contract and picked a lucky day to happily go to the BK base and pick up the person. He didn\u2019t know where news had leaked from but fans of Titans and the BK team were waiting at the gate of the base, blocking the road around the gate.Everyone was holding support cards and waiting with red eyes for Jing Yuanzhou to come out and give an explanation. Since there were too many people, all the security guards of the club were dispatched to maintain order and avoid a stampede.In such a noisy and solemn atmosphere, no one noticed the slender figure dragging a suitcase that appeared at the side door of BK\u2019s base. Jing Yuanzhou might\u2019ve played for the BK Club for many years but there wasn\u2019t much luggage to be taken away. He only had one suitcase.He looked back at the familiar building behind him before walking to the small door that the club didn\u2019t often use. Far away, he could see a figure lazily waiting beside the car. The sunlight today was a bit dazzling. Lin Yan wore a black cap and big sunglasses that covered most of his face.He noticed Jing Yuanzhou and lowered his sunglasses slightly with his fingertips, revealing a pair of smiling eyes. \u201cAs expected of God Jing, moving houses isn\u2019t easy. In order to cooperate with you, I made myself look low-key on purpose.\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze swept over the pink Lamborghini behind this person and his lips curved up slightly. \u201cIt is quite low-key.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t hear the teasing in the tone and helped put Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s luggage in the car.His gaze moved behind Jing Yuanzhou and he whistled softly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with this kid? Doesn\u2019t he know that you will be gone forever.\u201dThe other teammates wanted to come and see him off but they were all stopped by Jing Yuanzhou. There was only Lan MIn left. Since learning that Jing Yuanzhou was going to such an unknown club, he always felt a bit out of balance. He had followed to see the person who cheated his master away.Lan Min\u2019s eyes were already red from the parting. He heard this sentence and angrily cried out, \u201cYou should be gone forever!\u201dLin Yan wondered, \u201cThe BK Club has nothing to do with me. Why would I come back after taking Titans away?\u201dLan Min was choked by the words and his eyes became redder with anger and annoyance.Jing Yuanzhou was helpless. \u201cDon\u2019t tease him.\u201dLin Yan smiled and turned to open the door for Jing Yuanzhou in a gentlemanly manner. Then he made a \u2018please\u2019 gesture.Jing Yuanzhou looked back at Lan Min. \u201cGo back to training. I\u2019m leaving.\u201dLan Min had been trying his best but at this moment, tears fell uncontrollably. He sobbed and shouted, \u201cMaster, if you don\u2019t have a good time there, I\u2019ll go to Manager Wang and ask him to find a way to get you back! Wu wu wu, after\u2026 in a few days, I will go to your side to see\u2026 to look at you!\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes shook slightly but before he could say anything, Lin Yan had pushed him inside and closed the door.Lin Yan sat in the driver\u2019s seat and shrugged when he noticed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s inquiring gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just afraid that his howling voice is too loud and will attract your fans. At that time, there will be more than a few people trying to tear me apart.\u201dJing Yuanzhou slightly raised his eyebrow. \u201cYou are still afraid?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid, why wouldn\u2019t I be afraid?\u201d Lin Yan replied thoughtlessly without any burden. \u201cYou don\u2019t know but I just walked around to the front to take a look. This battle, tut, it is too amazing. I can only say that it is worthy of Titans!\u201dJing Yuanzhou chuckled and looked out the window. All the surroundings here that were so familiar were rapidly retreating, finally drifting away from him.Goodbye, BK.Titans.For a while, the car was silent. Then the play button was pressed and the sound of music was heard: the birds on the trees are in pairs, the green water is clear and the mountain range is smiling. From now on, they wouldn\u2019t suffer from enslavement again. The husband and wife both return home\u2026 You and I are like mandarin ducks, flying with each other together in the world.Lin Yan was very satisfied with his taste and tilted his head as he asked, \u201cIs it good to listen to?\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWasn\u2019t this song \u2018Husband and Wife Return Home?\u2019Lin Yan understood how Jing Yuanzhou would feel leaving his old club. The silence was due to feeling alone and he didn\u2019t mention it.Then Lin Yan remembered something. \u201cBy the way, Gloy is also coming to the club today. The time we arrive should almost the same.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yan guessed right. Gloy had indeed arrived at the GH base one step ahead of them. Luo Mo had sent him a WeChat message but he didn\u2019t receive it because he was driving. Once Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou opened the door to the hall, they happened to see a teenager sitting on the sofa in a somewhat restrained manner.He had a white and beautiful appearance. He wore ear studs in his ears and his curls were dyed a grandma grey colour in a rebellious manner that didn\u2019t fit his demeanor.Gloy\u2019s gaze lingered on Lin Yan for a while and then once it fell on Jing Yuanzhou, it couldn\u2019t move away. It took him a long time to stutter out. \u201cChief Lin, G-God Jing.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t seen Lin Yan before but Luo Mo had said the boss had gone to pick up Titans. It wasn\u2019t hard to guess.Lin Yan knew that Luo Mo must\u2019ve gone to the league headquarters again so he greeted Gloy and took over the reception work. He led the two people to the dormitory building to choose their rooms.Gloy had far more luggage than Jing Yuanzhou. There was a long line of large and small suitcases. Jing Yuanzhou lightly lifted his suitcase and was about to go upstairs. Then he looked back and asked, \u201cShall I help you lift one?\u201dGloy was taken aback for a moment before hurriedly pulling the front suitcase behind him, blocking it tightly. \u201cNo need, I\u2019ll do it myself!\u201dJing Yuanzhou nodded. He wasn\u2019t polite and headed upstairs. Lin Yan walked over slowly from behind. He glanced at the pile of suitcases and asked with interest, \u201cDo you need help?\u2019Gloy\u2019s eyes lit up and he replied without hesitation, \u201cOkay, thank you Chief Lin!\u201dThe kind smile in Lin Yan\u2019s eyes froze slightly. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Fuck?Jing Yuanzhou put away his suitcase and just walked out into the corridor when he saw two people carrying up the suitcases. He noticed Lin Yan\u2019s gloomy face and held back his smile as he went to help.In the end, Jing Yuanzhou chose the room directly opposite Lin Yan\u2019s room. Their doors were facing each other and were only separated by a corridor. After all, one was the captain and the other was the coach. It was convenient if they needed to communicate with each other in the future.Gloy lingered between restraint and temptation for a long time. Finally, he couldn\u2019t resist his idol\u2019s charm and dragged all his suitcases into the room next to Jing Yuanzhou.Lin Yan leaned against the wall of the corridor and waited for them to organize their rooms. He wasn\u2019t in a rush and once they came out again, he raised his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all done?\u201dJing Yuanzhou told him, \u201cYes, there wasn\u2019t much.\u201dNext to him, Gloy was silent. He had many things to unpack but this was his first time meeting Titans. He had to firmly keep up!Lin Yan smiled as he looked at the teenager\u2019s rather eye-catching grey hair. \u201cLet\u2019s go and sign the contract first.\u201dThe group went to the conference room.Lin Yan took out a thick contract from the documents bag and handed it to them. He said half-jokingly, \u201cAll the information related to the live broadcast of the platform is here. You must read it carefully before signing it, so as to not regret it. Don\u2019t say that your black-hearted boss entrapped you in your precious youth.\u201dGloy heard Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s words and didn\u2019t hesitate to grab the pen and sign his name: Gu Luo.Lin Yan was very satisfied with the cooperation of his two players. He took back the contracts and noticed that Gu Luo seemed a bit absent-minded. He casually wondered, \u201cWhy? Is there a question?\u201dGu Luo looked around and finally expressed the question in his mind. \u201cChief Lin, why didn\u2019t that financial backer little sister come?\u201dLin Yan raised his eyebrow slightly. \u201cYou say it again. Who?Jing Yuanzhou had been sitting beside him and looking at an e-sports magazine. He heard this and looked up.Gu Luo didn\u2019t notice the subtle atmosphere. He thought Lin Yan didn\u2019t know who he was talking about and explained, \u201cThe young lady who gave me deep-water fish mines in my live broadcast room. She was really super gentle. It is thanks to her that I got to know God Jing. However, I didn\u2019t see her in the base today. Did something happen?\u201dHe seemed to feel a bit regretful. \u201cWhen will I have the chance to meet her? I just want to thank her in person.\u201dHe finished speaking and there was silence.After a while, Lin Yan spoke with a numb expression. \u201cYour heart has been received.\u201dGu Luo blinked blankly. \u201cHuh?\u201dJing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cWhat are you doing? Your \u2018little sister\u2019 has already accepted your gratitude.\u201dGu Luo instinctively looked around but didn\u2019t see anyone else. Then his eyes moved back, skimming over Jing Yuanzhou before falling on Lin Yan cautiously and curiously. \u201cChief Lin, you\u2026\u201dLin Yan sneered. Gu Luo understood it and vaguely felt like something was broken. Yes, this was the sound of disillusionment.Lin Yan smiled coldly at this expression. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I don\u2019t deserve to use that ID or am I not gentle enough?\u2019Gu Luo was obviously still in shock from the disintegration of the little sister image. Then this cold gaze fell on him and his cheeks became hot. He reached out to cover his face without thinking. \u201cI\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean that.\u201dLin Yan picked up the documents bag and casually changed the topic. \u201cOkay, sit down first. I have already received your words of thanks. Today is the first day you have come to GH and I have prepared a meeting gift. Come take a look.\u201dGu Luo just wanted to find a hole in the ground to hide in. His face became even redder when he heard these words. \u201cThank you, Chief Lin.\u201dLin Yan gently hit him on the head with the notebook in his hand and corrected him. \u201cCall me Coach Lin from now on.\u201dGu Luo was stunned for a moment. \u201cYes, Coach Lin.\u201dLin Yan took out the multimedia remote control from the drawer beside him. He fiddled with it a few times before the familiar game screen was placed on the big screen. It was recognizable easily. This was the group battle map used in 5V5, the Abyss Canyon.Gu Luo saw the game ID on top of the character\u2019s head and was slightly taken aback. He hadn\u2019t expected Lin Yan\u2019s so-called meeting gift to be a video replay of his match.Time passed and a lazy and familiar voice was heard from the speakers. \u201cAt 1 minute and 22 seconds, your walking position was half a body behind. This resulted in the skill range of two skills to be insufficient and one less armored soldier to be cleared. If there wasn\u2019t a wave of mistakes, at 1 minute and 45 seconds, the opponent would be able to clear the field before the jungler came to the mid-lane to gank. This means the head of the mid-laner would be lost due to the insufficient cooldown time of one skill.\u201dLin Yan had found a chair to sit on. At this time, he slowly added, \u201cIf this was Titans playing, there would never be such a low level mistake.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked over at him with a strange expression. The replay continued.\u201cAt seven minutes, the team battle cut-in time was too early. This caused the enemy to retreat vigilantly and you failed to achieve a team destruction.\u201dLin Yan added, \u201cIf this was Titans playing, there would never be such a low level mistake.\u201d\u201c9 minutes and 2 seconds\u2026\u201d\u201cIf this was Titans playing, there would never be such a low level mistake.\u201d\u201c10 minutes and 23 seconds\u2026\u201d\u201cIf this was Titans\u2026\u201dTime passed minute by minute.In fact, there were only five or six double matches that day. Yet even with various editing, the reply still lasted for two hours. It could be said that all the details of Gu Luo\u2019s mistakes that afternoon were listed.This was the result presented. It could be imagined how much time and energy Lin Yan had spent in the production process.As the former captain of BK, Jing Yuanzhou certainly knew that professional teams often taught newcomers who had just entered the league a lesson. He just hadn\u2019t expected Lin Yan to give such a big dose as soon as Gu Luo arrived.He was also present at the doubles matches that afternoon. Gu Luo\u2019s operations were remarkable throughout the game. There was a winning streak and he was also MVP. Many professional players might not be able to ensure such a stable performance in a passerby game.However, Lin Yan found nearly a hundred operational gaps in all these matches. The average of approximately 20 mistakes per match was basically enough to criticize all the performances as worthless. Not to mention, after the analysis of each error point, he would stimulate Gu Luo with the Titans Gu Luo worshipped.There was suspicion of revenge. In addition, such straightforward criticism was received in front of Jing Yuanzhou. If Gu Luo\u2019s psychological endurance was weak then he might directly shut down.The thing that made Jing Yuanzhou care more was that if Lin Yan hadn\u2019t mentioned many of the details in this video, he might not have noticed them. This person\u2019s vision was terrifying. If it was Titans playing, would such a low level mistake be made? Perhaps it really wouldn\u2019t.As the replay video continued, Gu Luo\u2019s head became lower and lower. Meanwhile, Lin Yan sitting next to him seemed a bit sleepy and kept yawning. Finally, the video playback ended and the entire big screen darkened.There was a long silence in the conference room.Lin Yan stretched his body and got up from the chair. He pulled out the USB disk and handed it to Gu Luo with a calm expression. \u201cI put a lot of thought into this meeting gift so remember to cherish it.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s fingers shook as he reached for it. \u201c\u2026Thank you, Coach.\u201dLin Yan smiled with satisfaction. \u201cI knew you would like it.\u201dHe lightly patted Gu Luo\u2019s shoulder as he spoke. His tone was extremely gentle and affectionate. \u201cThe official training hasn\u2019t started but remember to watch it a few more times when you are free.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s back shook instantly and the top of his grey head seemed to have experienced the vicissitudes of life in an instant. \u201cI\u2026 I will.\u201dLin Yan watched the teenager leaving in a daze and his smile grew wider. He turned around and met the stare of the man sitting not far away.He was taken aback. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dJing Yuanzhou leaned back against the chair and looked at him, voice calm and indifferent. \u201cIf I remember correctly, today is the first day I officially came to GH, Coach Lin?\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis man had the words \u2018meeting gift\u2019 directly written on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yan hugged his body and slowly leaned against the wall. \u201cIs there any gift that God Jing wants?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled at him and slowly released a word. \u201cGuess?\u201d Needless to say, this attitude was really damn familiar.Lin Yan met this gaze and was quite frank. \u201cLast time, I promised myself to you and you said no. I really don\u2019t know what else I can give that is more sincere.\u201dJing Yuanzhou suggested, \u201cSend it again. What if I want it?\u201dTheir eyes met and then Lin Yan laughed. \u201cForget it. If I am rejected twice then I\u2019m afraid my glass heart will break and I will cry. It is too late.\u201dHe didn\u2019t wait for Jing Yuanzhou to respond as he continued, \u201cThen I can only treat you to a meal. It can be regarded as your meeting gift.\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at him and asked in a light voice, \u201cThat is fine but\u2026 Gloy?\u201d\u201cThere is a housekeeper aunt at the base and she will come over to cook when it is time. It will take him a long time to digest today\u2019s replay. It will be a waste of time to take him out to eat.\u201d Lin Yan looked down at the time. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you at the door at 5:30.\u201dJing Yuanzhou nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll see you then.\u201dThe BOD Club might not be very strong but it knew how to enjoy itself. The management had taken into account the nearby supporting facilities when choosing the base. The road outside was a luxurious commercial area that had everything they wanted to eat.Lin Yan had come to live at the base a few days in advance but he was so busy he had no time to reward himself. Now he took advantage of inviting Jing Yuanzhou for a meal to happily go out. He parked the car in the underground garage and used his phone to search for the public\u2019s comments. He asked for the other person\u2019s opinion. \u201cThe barbecue here seems good. Do you want to eat it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was at ease. \u201cAnything is fine.\u201dThe two people went to the barbecue restaurant and got a box. The cold air from the air conditioner quietly calmed the heat brought in from the outside world. Lin Yan wasn\u2019t sure about Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s tastes so he ordered while inquiring. After that, he handed the menu to the waiter nearby. \u201cThat will be all for now, thank you.\u201dJing Yuanzhou sat opposite Lin Yan and drank tea while looking up from time to time. The surrounding area became quiet the moment the waiter left.Seeing that Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t have any intention to speak, the impatient Lin Yan first provoked the topic. \u201cGloy officially signed today and there are finally two people in the team. However, the shooter, support and jungler positions are still empty. Captain Jing, aren\u2019t you curious about the candidates for the other three positions?\u201dJing Yuanzhou replied indifferently, \u201cThere is no curiosity. I\u2019m just a member of the team and will follow the team\u2019s strategy.\u201dLin Yan slowly leaned back and looked sideways at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cYou\u2019re so at ease with me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou gave a smile that wasn\u2019t a smile. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t at ease then how could I be willing to sign with you?\u201dLin Yan hadn\u2019t expected such a sentence. He was slightly stunned before nodding earnestly. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t worry, I will be responsible.\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s lips curved up. \u201cI will wait for you to be responsible.\u201dLin Yan finally couldn\u2019t hold back. \u201cI think that as the future captain, you still need to be more concerned about the situation of the players.\u201dJing Yuanzhou suppressed his smile and nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dWhy did he hear a bit of reluctance from this tone?Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan had long wanted to talk to Jing Yuanzhou about the other candidate. Now he finally had this great opportunity and he didn\u2019t waste any words.During this year\u2019s transfer period, the unknown club GH actually signed Jing Yuanzhou. This was already regarded as the biggest winner. However, the team\u2019s list of personnel still needed to be filled urgently. The transfer period was such a good opportunity that it naturally wasn\u2019t enough to just get Jing Yuanzhou.In the past two days, Luo Mo had been frequently running to the league headquarters to arrange the transfer of another player. A person who wasn\u2019t even on the roster of the professional league and was still sitting on the bench of a third-rate team as a\u2026 substitute support.Gun. If this ID was released, all the fans of Burning Hot would probably ask blankly, \u2018Who is this person?\u2019This type of person had no reputation at all. No matter the perspective, putting him on the same team as a god-level player like Jing Yuanzhou could be regarded as an insult to Jing Yuanzhou. It was due to this that Lin Yan wondered if Jing Yuanzhou would turn his face away without waiting for him to finish. Thus, he paid attention to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s reaction while speaking.Unexpectedly, Jing Yuanzhou continued to cook the meat as if nothing had happened. He turned to this side and thoughtfully took a piece of meat and sent it to Lin Yan\u2019s bowl. Then he asked lightly, \u201cIs this person strong?\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t hesitate on this question. \u201cVery strong.\u201d\u201cOh, then it\u2019s fine.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou nodded before wondering, \u201cWhere did you get the information on these players? You are more informed than me.\u201dLin Yan observed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s demeanor and determined there really was no dissatisfaction. Then he laughed and placed the meat in the bowl into his mouth. \u201cIt is a secret.\u201dThey eat intermittently for more than an hour while also chatting about the club\u2019s development plan. Jing Yuanzhou had guessed that Lin Yan was going to win the league qualification from the variety show and wasn\u2019t surprised.He picked up his cup to take a sip of tea and asked with interest, \u201cThen what if we fail to win the variety show? You promised me that you would allow me to participate in the professional league. If this happens, how do you plan to compensate me for not qualifying for the league? You know that I can only play professionally for a few more years. If I miss this year then I might really have to retire.\u201dLin Yan raised his head and rejected the assumption. \u201cThe victory is definitely ours.\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed. \u201cThere are no absolutes in anything. What if we really fail?\u201dIf this man was asking seriously then Lin Yan might give him some words of comfort. However, seeing this smirk, it was obviously that he was arguing for the sake of arguing.Lin Yan blinked and revealed a smile that could be called a gentle smile. \u201cWell, if I really force God Jing to retire bitterly because of my blind self-confidence then I will compensate you for your loss by buying a live broadcast platform to support you and exhaust all the resources of the platform to serve you. Are you satisfied with this, Titans?\u201dJing Yuanzhou mused, \u201cA live broadcast platform?\u201dLin Yan gritted his teeth. \u201cIf one isn\u2019t enough then I\u2019ll buy two.\u201dA faint smile flashed in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes. \u201cThen I will count it. I will be taken care of by Chief Lin.\u201dLin Yan brought the last piece of meat to his mouth and gritted his teeth. Then he forced a smile. \u201cI certainly have no opinion as long as Captain Jing is willing.\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised his eyebrows, his noncommittal attitude seeming like real acquiescence. Since the meal was over, he took the coat hanging next to him and stood up. Lin Yan went to the front to pay the bill.On the way to the underground garage, the two people were silent for a while. It wasn\u2019t until they got out of the elevator that Jing Yuanzhou seemed to think of something. \u201cBy the way, did you find the person your friend was looking for?\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t respond for a while. \u201cWho is that?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled lightly at him. \u201cThat man, the one jiao scumbag.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNo one had mentioned it again so he almost forgot about the unexpected mishap caused by the virtual boyfriend. Lin Yan hadn\u2019t expected Jing Yuanzhou to remember this incident. He couldn\u2019t help admiring his impeccable rhetoric even more. Fortunately, he was witty at the time and hadn\u2019t revealed the identity of the friend.Lin Yan\u2019s mouth pursed slightly before he cleared his throat. \u201cHe, ah\u2026 should still be looking for it.\u201dJing Yuanzhou nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s good. I\u2019m cheering for him.\u201dThen he opened the car door and got in, leaving Lin Yan standing by the car alone.Lin Yan, \u201c?\u201dWhy suddenly ask about this? Too poisonous.***After the transfer period opened, there was news that listed players had completed their transaction. However, most people\u2019s attention was still focused on Jing Yuanzhou and the GH Club they had never heard of.You know, Jing Yuanzhou had been with the BK Club since he entered the league. Almost everyone assumed he would play in BK until he retired. Now news of his transfer suddenly broke out and it was hard to accept.In addition, the new home after the transfer wasn\u2019t any known giant team but an 18th tier team that didn\u2019t even qualify for the professional league. What was going on? The truth became more and more confusing.In the meantime, the BK Club played a good game. They took advantage of the news of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s transfer to announce Lan Min as the starter. The subtle time difference before and after naturally made netizens think that the emergence of this new player was a choice BK was forced to make in order to fill Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s vacancy.As a result, the new club with no foundation and no reputation, GH was completely pushed to the forefront.Under the netizens\u2019 painstaking investigation, someone finally discovered the relationship between this club and the commercial powerhouse, the Lin Group. However, this caused even greater doubts.Since Chief Lin was interested in entering the field of e-sports, shouldn\u2019t he spend money to form an all-star team. Yet several days had passed in the transfer period and the top players found new homes one after another. GH still hadn\u2019t moved for a long time.What did this mean? They weren\u2019t planning to buy any more players? Was it possible that TItans had to play as five people on the field?Fans of Titans became more and more anxious. Then even started sending private messages to the official Weibo of the GH Club, making various suggestions and providing a list of possible new team members.A rough glance revealed that all the top players listed during this year\u2019s transfer period were included.Lin Yan looked through the private messages and laughed with joy. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. Your fans really feel sorry for you. If I take all these players then the amount of money will probably be enough to buy another Titans?\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked up when he heard the words and commented objectively, \u201cIf Old V and the others knew they were so valuable then they would definitely be touched.\u201dLin Yan shrugged. \u201cUnfortunately, you are the only man I like.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was taken aback for a moment before smiling. \u201cIt is my honor.\u201dLin Yan closed the private message notifications that were still emerging one after another. The players listed were indeed very good but unfortunately, they didn\u2019t match the team configuration he wanted. In comparison, Xiao Gun suited him better.In the current version of the game, the hard-control support was more in line with the mainstream tactic. However, Gun was the league\u2019s future number one healer. Even if he wasn\u2019t the core of the team\u2019s tactics, he was an indispensable existence for creating Lin Yan\u2019s ideal team.Compared to Jing Yuanzhou, it was naturally much simpler to dig a person from sub-league teams without any publicity. Luo Mo had been going through the formalities in the past two days. If there were no surprises, he would be able to see the little cuties he dreamed of soon.Lin Yan tapped his fingers on the table and a satisfied smile appeared on his face. The team formation progress was now three-fifths.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe teams in the sub-league had long been accustomed to players flowing in and out, not to mention that Gun was only a substitute player in the support position. They were happy to release him as long as the price given by GH was sufficient.Lin Yan took Gloy (Gu Luo) to the door of the base to welcome the new member. In the distance, a tall figure dragging his suitcase could be seen. His hair was a crew cut, he had slightly dark skin and there was a faint cross scar on his left cheek, making his angular face look colder. It was really difficult to associate such a cool boy with the support position known was the \u2018team angel.\u2019Lin Yan noticed that Gu Luo was frozen in place and gently patted him on the shoulder before leading him to greet his new teammate. Gun\u2019s real name was Jian Ye. He might only be a substitute on his original team but his murderous temperament meant everyone in the team habitually called him \u2018Brother Gun.\u2019 Such a nickname might be okay for Gu Luo but it didn\u2019t seem too appropriate for Lin Yan.Lin Yan wasn\u2019t a person to treat others as outsiders and his first sentence was very enthusiastic. \u201cGun Bao, you are finally here!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Jian Ye\u2019s mouth twitched and he was silent for a moment. \u201cCan you change the name?\u201dLin Yan thought about it. \u201cThen Gun Zai?\u201d\u201c\u2026That is fine.\u201d It was better than Gun Bao.Seeing that a consensus was reached, Lin Yan smiled happily. He walked forward to help pull the suitcase to the base. On the way, he requested of Gu Luo, \u201cGo to the training room and open two machines.\u201dGu Luo asked suspiciously, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we go to the dormitory first?\u201dLin Yan placed Jian Ye\u2019s suitcase at the door, patted off the non-existence dust and made an impatient face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about going to the dormitory. There is plenty of time. The two of you should first let me take a look at a solo match.\u201dGu Luo and Jian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dA solo match, namely a 1V1 single player duel. The person who completed a certain number of kills or the corresponding conditions would win. The two of them were certainly no strangers to solo matches. The key problem was that Gu Luo was good at mid-lane heroes while Jian Ye was a support player. What was the difference between letting a support player fight a mid-laner and delivering food to the door?Gu Luo couldn\u2019t help thinking about the meeting gift he received on his first day at the base and firmly felt that he couldn\u2019t bully others. \u201cCoach Lin, isn\u2019t this too\u2026\u201dHowever, Lin Yan had already taken out his mobile phone and called a number. \u201cTitans, are you awake? The new member has arrived and is ready to play a solo match. Come and see?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice was faintly heard from the other end. \u201cOkay.\u201dLin Yan hung up and looked back at Gu Luo. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dGu Luo paused for a moment and his expression gradually became serious. \u201cI will take it seriously!\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Lin Yan smiled with satisfaction and turned to look at Jian Ye. \u201cGun Zai, what about you?\u201dObviously, Jian Ye didn\u2019t expect that the first thing he would do after coming to the new club was to solo with someone. He casually rubbed his head and didn\u2019t care. \u201cI can do it.\u201dBy the time Jing Yuanzhou entered the training room, the two of them were already sitting in front of the computer and a custom room was displayed on their screens. Lin Yan sat at the table with a notebook in his hand while looking quite cheerful. He noticed that Jing Yuanzhou had arrived and beckoned. \u201cCome, sit down.\u201dJing Yuanzhou took a seat next to Lin Yan and glanced over casually. He could see that the strength index analysis map had been drawn in advance. Lin Yan noticed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze and smiled. \u201cJust wait, there will be a good show to see.\u201dThen he turned to look at Jian Ye. \u201cCorrespondingly, as long as you can complete 30 soldier replenishments, you will win. Remember, you must use your best hero!\u201dJian Ye replied, \u201c\u2026Understood.\u201dAnyone could hear it from the moment the rules came out. This was obviously forcing Jian Ye to escape from the protection of the defense tower to collide head-on in the line.Gu Luo was silent for a moment before glancing at Jian Ye. \u201cWhat is your best hero?\u201dJian Ye thought about it. \u201cShaman Elf, Linley Witch, Cocoa Immortal?\u201dGu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThese three heroes, one after another, had big breasts. Together, the milk received from them could pierce the sky.There was one thing to say. This really didn\u2019t match your image at all, this brother!Lin Yan clapped his hands in anticipation. \u201cIf there are no comments then let\u2019s not waste time. Start.\u201dThe two people didn\u2019t say anything and directly started the custom game.Since Lin Yan repeatedly emphasized the need to use their good heroes and Jing Yuanzhou was there watching, Gu Luo didn\u2019t hesitate to lock onto the assassin-type mid-laner hero Scarlet Dancer FusangOn the other side, Jian Ye chose Cocoa Immortal.It had to be admitted that in the current version of the game, support heroes of the healing type had become an almost trash existence. They had no strong hard control skills and there was no way to help the team resist too much damage. Combined with the need to chant the treatment skill, their teammates often died before their health could be restored.It was precisely due to this embarrassing situation that the healers completely faded out of everyone\u2019s vision. In a ranking section with high points, if someone locked onto Cocoa Immortal then it was likely they would be chased by their teammates and accused of being an \u2018actor\u2019.Therefore, Gu Luo instinctively believed that the solo match would soon end with his Fusang. He never expected that a match that should be quickly decided was actually dragged out to 15 minutes.What was the concept of 15 minutes? Sometimes it was enough for a 5V5 crushing match. During the solo match, Jian Ye might have difficulty replenishing his troops due to Fusang\u2019s suppression but he had already gained 28 artillery soldiers by the time he was killed by Gu Luo. In other words, he was likely to win if he had been a bit more steady.The moment Gu Luo removed his hand from the keyboard and recalled the details of the match, he couldn\u2019t help letting out a sigh. So strong! During the match, he clearly had several chances to complete the kill but in the last few tenths of a second, Jian Ye was always able to raise his health again from the bottom and escape.It might be a coincidence if it was only once but this history repeated itself again and again. It showed that everything wasn\u2019t a coincidence. It should be known that these healing type support heroes were different from assassins. If they wanted to complete such operations under the premise when skill casting was required, they had to rely on absolute advance judgment.Gu Luo had only one thought come to mind. Fortunately, they were teammates and not opponents. This type of situation where he should\u2019ve been able to kill casually but couldn\u2019t had too much of an impact on human mentalityLin Yan had already collected the information he wanted and was satisfied. He saw this teenager with grey hair still sitting with a blank expression and gently tapped his notebook against the grey hair. \u201cWhat are you still doing here? Is it so great to abuse your teammate? Why don\u2019t you send someone to rest in the dormitory?\u201dGu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was really \u2018great\u2019. So \u2018great\u2019 that he didn\u2019t want to experience this a second time. His mouth tensed but he didn\u2019t say much. He just stood up. \u201cLet\u2019s go, Brother Gun, I will take you to the dormitory.\u201dJian Ye had lost the solo match but there wasn\u2019t too much expression on his face as he followed.Lin Yan watched them leave until their backs completely disappeared. Then he nodded with pleasure. \u201cIt seems they will get along well in the future.\u201dJing Yuanzhou wondered, \u201cHow can you tell?\u201dLin Yan glanced at the settlement screen still on the computers and became more convinced. \u201cA man\u2019s intuition.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJing Yuanzhou tried to endure it but he still laughed. \u201cThis is really convincing.\u201dLin Yan skillfully ignored the teasing in the words and calmly shifted the topic back. \u201cBy the way, is the captain satisfied with my newly recruited support?\u201d\u201cVery satisfied.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou raised his head to meet Lin Yan\u2019s eyes and his smile became bigger. \u201cYou always have a discerning eye.\u201dLin Yan inexplicably choked on his saliva at this gaze and he coughed. \u201cDon\u2019t praise me so much.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it good to praise you?\u201dLin Yan sent him an angry look. \u201cI will be shy.\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe opened his mouth. \u201cThen let\u2019s talk about a topic that you won\u2019t be shy about.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dJing Yuanzhou leaned back in his chair. \u201cSo when will the other two teammates arrive?\u201dThe people selected by Lin Yan just kept becoming more interesting. This inevitably made him interested.Lin Yan blinked mysteriously. \u201cYou\u2019ll see soon.\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised an eyebrow. \u201cSoon?\u201dLin Yan opened the app on his phone and took a look. \u201cYes, I have placed an order with him for a week. You can play as you like.\u201dLuo Mo had just sorted out Jian Ye\u2019s contract. Now he heard such a sentence as he was walking in from outside and he paused slightly. It was unknown what Jing Yuanzhou was thinking but he suddenly gave a chuckle and asked in a low voice, \u201cFor a week, I can play as I like?\u201dLin Yan thought about it. \u201cIt is fine if you call a few more people to play together. Activities that need more people will be more exciting.\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cYou are right.\u201dLuo Mo\u2019s hands holding the contract shook slightly as he listened to their conversation. Wait, what the hell were they talking about? What were these cruel and ruthless words?***Gu Luo had come to the club a few days earlier so he took Jian Ye to the dormitory building and Jian Ye selected a room. Gu Luo helped clean up and glanced at his new teammate from time to time.If it hadn\u2019t been for the meticulous and divine operation he had just experienced, he would\u2019ve never associated this person\u2019s image with the soft and cute Cocoa Immortal. Thinking up to here, Gu Luo was reminded of the soft and gentle financial backer sister and was silent for a moment.Forget it, everything was fake.Jian Ye finished cleaning up his closet and saw Gu Luo\u2019s strange expression. He thought for a moment and said, \u201cGloy, don\u2019t worry. You don\u2019t have to pay attention to killing me just now. Brother Gun isn\u2019t such a person and I didn\u2019t take it to heart at all.\u201dIt would\u2019ve been fine if he hadn\u2019t said it. Now that he did say it, Gu Luo remembered his vicious style on the map just now and instinctively glanced at the scar on the other person\u2019s face.Jian Ye patted him on the shoulder and showed a smile that he thought was kind. \u201cDon\u2019t look at Brother Gun like this. I\u2019m actually very gentle. Relax. I will definitely love you well later on the field!\u201dGu Luo was shocked by these two shots. \u201c\u2026You are too kind, Brother.\u201dJian Ye laughed and the scar on his face stretched a bit, making him look fierce. \u201cIt should be.\u201dGu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBy the time the two of them had unpacked the things in the dormitory, the chef aunt had already prepared a table of hearty dishes. Jian Ye completed the contract signing and everyone had lunch together.Lin Yan glanced at the time and took them to the computers in the training room. Gu Luo sat in front of the computer and couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit awkward. \u201cCoach Lin, this\u2026 should we continue the solo match?\u201dLin Yan had already turned on the computer on the other side and he didn\u2019t raise his head after hearing such words. \u201cWhy? Are you addicted to the solo matches? If you like to play with Gun Zai so much, I\u2019ll leave more time for you to play together.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s eyelids twitched. \u201cNo, no need!\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t think much. He opened the Burning Hot client and looked around in a circle. \u201cAre you all on your accounts?\u201dJian Ye responded cooperatively. \u201cI\u2019m on!\u201d\u201cThen add me first.\u201d Lin Yan reported his ID without changing his expression. \u201cWho Isn\u2019t a Little Princess.\u201dJian Ye, \u201c?\u201dGu Luo was silent for a moment. He felt complicated as he explained, \u201cCoach Lin\u2019s ID is Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess.\u201dHe saw the team invitation pop up on the interface and closed his eyes, completely laying down. Then the next second, another person entered the team and his back suddenly straightened. He sat upright in front of the computer and didn\u2019t forget to organize the headphones on his head. The operations record could clearly be seen on the team page.[Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has invited \u2018Jing\u2019 to join the team.]Gu Luo stared at the picture attached to the name and couldn\u2019t help glancing again. By the time he saw it the fifth time, Lin Yan had pulled Jian Ye into the group and reminded, \u201cYou haven\u2019t added each other as friends yet. Hurry and add each other.\u201dThen he took out his phone and said, \u201cWait a minute, I\u2019ll pull another person.\u201dGu Luo controlled his excitement, moved his mouth carefully and sent Jing Yuanzhou a friends request. The moment he saw the newly added ID on his friends list, he smiled uncontrollably. Even if this was just a side account, he felt that his world had instantly become bright.At this time, Lin Yan finally pulled the last person into their team. This person didn\u2019t prepare anything and typed in the chat box.[King of Hell Takes You to Fly: Line up as five?][King of Hell Takes You To Fly: Previously, you didn\u2019t say it was to line up as five. It wasn\u2019t in the price.]Lin Yan slightly raised his eyebrow but slowly typed.[Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess: Rest assured, you won\u2019t suffer a loss. Play one match and it will be counted as four matches.]]King of Hell Takes You To Fly: Deal. Let\u2019s line up now.]Jian Ye saw them talking about price and felt some doubts. \u201cCoach Lin, where did you pull this person from?\u201dLin Yan pressed the matching button to enter the queue and casually replied, \u201cOh, I found someone to play with you. A game worth 100 yuan is precious. You should enjoy it and don\u2019t waste it.]At present, there were four people in their team. Three were GH contracted players and one was the team coach. In a formal match to see how the team played, who would\u2019ve thought that Lin Yan would actually find someone to accompany them and make up their numbers?Gu Luo squirmed before coughing gently. \u201cIn fact\u2026 if you are short of people then I have many friends online. I can try and call them.\u201dBased on the accompanying player\u2019s words, one game was four times the price. Wasn\u2019t this stealing money?Jian Ye also suggested, \u201cI have a few teammates here as well. What position do you want? I can ask.\u201dLin Yan refused without thinking about it. \u201cNo, this person is fine.\u201dSeeing that the matching had been completed and they were entering the BP interface, Lin Yan typed: [King of Hell: you play the wild.]Jian Ye instinctively looked at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cThat lane\u2026\u201dJing Yuanzhou had just finished debugging the keyboard. \u201cI\u2019ll push through myself.\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t ask any further and nodded. \u201cThen Gloy, you can rest assured with me. As long as there is Brother Gun\u2019s milk, the mid-laner will never fall down!\u201dGu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis mouth twitched slightly. He wanted to say something but the scene of the previous solo match was still vivid. In the end, he wasn\u2019t willing to reject it. Okay, he admitted it. He was greedy for Brother Gun\u2019s milk.The BP process was over and the match officially began. The map had just been loaded when a sentence appeared in the chat dialog.[King of Hell Takes You To Fly: Be careful on the lanes. I am taking you to fly but I can guarantee victory.][Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess: Little brother is great. I am optimistic about you! Shy.JPG.]Gu Luo was buying equipment. His hand shook when he caught a glimpse of this conversation and a good mage mid-laner almost bought physical equipment.Gu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t feel the slightest burden. He leaned against the chair with his legs up while hearing the sound of the game from the headphones hanging around his neck. He arrived in the bottom lane and started filling up his soldiers without delay. For a while, apart from the occasional exchange between Gu Luo and Jian Ye in the training room, there was only the sound of the keyboard and mouse.Less than one minute after the start, the first head appeared. Jing Yuanzhou quietly completed a single kill. The opposite side was trying to ambush in the jungle to seduce a wave of mobs. As a result, he just gave away his head.At this time, King of Hell Takes You To Fly had wanted to go to the opposite wild area to find trouble. He hadn\u2019t expected his teammate to take the head first. He was stunned for a moment and could only search the wild area for some mobs before reluctantly leaving.Lin Yan glanced at his soldiers steadily filling the road and raised his eyebrow with a smile.He didn\u2019t allow Jian Ye to follow him and was ready to be a tool man shooter. Now he and Jing Yuanzhou were on the bottom and top lanes. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to call it the furthest distance.The game continued. Perhaps he was inspired by Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s first blood but Gloy became fierce. Within half a minute, a head also broke out on the middle lane. Then a battle broke out violently.In the mid-lane, heads broke out one after another. Meanwhile, King of Hell Takes You To Fly was killing mobs alone in the wild area. The situation soon showed a lopsided trend.Lin Yan, the tool man shooter, was killing the soldiers on the bottom line while occasionally shouting a few cheers in the chat box. Unknowingly, the top, mid and bottom lanes were breaking through at the same time.The enemy\u2019s crystal broke and the word \u2018Victory\u2019 appeared on the screen. Lin Yan exited from the settlement interface and sent everyone a team invitation again.At the start of the second match, King of Hell Takes You To Fly no longer mentioned anything about taking them to fly in the chat box. Lin Yan noticed this detail and smiled slightly. He clicked on the mouse and locked onto a shooter hero who was more suitable for a mixed field.Thanks to Jing Yuanzhou crushing on his lane and the cooperation between Gu Luo and Jian Ye becoming more proficient, the match ended more quickly. Forget the MVP position. In the two matches, King of Hell Takes You To Fly KDA score data was only third in the team. He was completely silent. (KDA = kills, deaths, assists)He was obviously the one who was paid to take them to play but based on the statistics of the first two rounds, he seemed to be the one led by others. King of Hell Takes You To Fly had been an accompanying player for a long time and this was an unprecedented failure.In a dilapidated warehouse, the faint light of the computer screen illuminated the figure sitting at the table. Since he rarely went out in the sun, the boy\u2019s skin was sickly pale and the originally unmotivated eyes gained a strange light. He slowly stretched and his indifferent expression gradually became a bit more serious.At the same time, Jian Ye received an order from Lin Yan. \u201cGloy will be fine in this match. You can follow the jungler at the beginning.\u201dGu Luo heard this and looked up with an expression full of nostalgia. He had to admire that as soon as Brother Gun was on the field, he truly was very gentle.The next game began again.Previously, the support had always been glued to the mid-laner and they were inseparable from each other. Now he suddenly abandoned the mid-lane and followed King of Hell Takes You To Fly to the wild. It really surprised King of Hell Takes You To Fly.In fact, in the two rounds just now, he had noticed this support\u2019s excellent healing technique. As a strong output, it was true that no one could withstand the tenderness from a healer. The \u2018poor\u2019 performance in the previous two games had made him inwardly sigh. Now that he had the healer\u2019s support, he could play more strongly.Starting at level 1, King of Hell Takes You To Fly directly invaded the opposite wild area. He faced the opponent jungler directly and beat him mercilessly. Seeing the other party flee, he didn\u2019t hesitate and took the first blood buff.The movement here had undoubtedly attracted the attention of others.Seeing that the opponent mid-laner had been outflanked in the direction of the wild area, King of Hell Takes You To Fly gave a signal. Jian Ye knew this signal and the two people turned around to crouch in the grass for the ambush.There was the first drop of blood combined with the double kill meant there was a rich economy. The jungler became a tyrant from the start.Lin Yan saw everything and smiled knowingly.By the time five minutes had passed, King of Hell Takes You To Fly ambushed the vanguard guards in the canyon and harvested the heads while the opponent was clearing the wild. He won a team buff again. Immediately afterwards, he detoured around the enemy\u2019s wild area, giving the opponent a time difference in the middle lane. Then he completed the kill again and pushed to the opponent\u2019s outer defense tower with Gloy. This didn\u2019t allow even a cloud to pass by.At 25 minutes, the game was over. Jian Ye had been following the entire process. He took the headphones off his head and exclaimed, \u201cThis jungler\u2019s rhythm is okay!\u201dNot a single second of the match was wasted. Even if Jian Ye wanted to take the time to return to the city to restore his state, he couldn\u2019t find the opportunity at all.Lin Yan smiled. \u201cOtherwise, why else would I call him?\u201dJing Yuanzhou had guessed Lin Yan\u2019s intentions as early as the formation of the team. He raised his head, caught Lin Yan\u2019s eyes and smiled. \u201cWhy? Do you want me to pull the person over again?\u201dThe word \u2018you\u2019 had a subtle emphasis on it. Gu Luo instinctively straightened and raised his head.Lin Yan didn\u2019t continue to send out the team invitation and stretched his body. \u201cI can\u2019t bother God Jing with this type of trivial matter.\u201dJing Yuanzhou made it clear. \u201cOh, it seems he isn\u2019t my fan.\u201d\u201cThere is no need to feel sad. Titans has so many fans it doesn\u2019t matter if he isn\u2019t one of them.\u201dThe words of comfort were too insincere as Lin Yan looked down at the statistics interface on the screen. The opponents weren\u2019t too strong but the few matches just now were enough to give him the information he wanted. At the very least, the integration with the team wasn\u2019t bad.Lin Yan grabbed his phone and stood up, walking to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll end it here for the day. I want to understand the situation. You can play as you like.\u201dThe training room was quiet for a moment. Gu Luo actually wanted to invite Jing Yuanzhou. He had only hesitated for a moment when he saw that the profile picture in the friends list was completely dark. He went offline so fast\u2026He sighed with regret and asked, \u201cBrother Gun, do you want to line up as a pair with me?\u201dJian Ye was very cheerful. \u201cYou invite me.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had just turned off the computer when his phone rang. The incoming call was from his former teammate, Ku Tianlu. Since Jing Yuanzhou left, the vice-captain Ku Tianlu had naturally taken over the position of BK\u2019s captain.Jing Yuanzhou went to the corridor outside and pressed to answer it. \u201cWhat is it, Captain Ku?\u201dKu Tianlu\u2019s voice came from the other end of the phone. \u201cBoss, don\u2019t tease me okay? How can I call myself captain in front of you?\u201dJing Yuanzhou chuckled. \u201cDid you call here just to arrange your position?\u201d\u201cOf course not!\u201d Ku Tianlu\u2019s tone became serious as he spoke of business. \u201cI wanted to ask what\u2019s going on with the GH team over there. Were all your teammates lined up in a team of five just now?\u201dJing Yuanzhou slowly leaned against the wall and instantly guessed the cause. \u201cWe just ran into an anchor?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, not many people know your side account. I wouldn\u2019t have noticed if it wasn\u2019t for Mini seeing it.\u201d At this point, Ku Tianlu paused slightly before speaking hesitantly. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question yet. The ones in the match with you just now, are they your future teammates?\u201d\u201cNot all of them. What\u2019s wrong?\u201dKu Tianlu was silent for a moment. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the others so I won\u2019t say much. It is just best to pay attention to that jungler.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cYou are usually focused on the game and don\u2019t pay attention to many things. However, the violent incident that took place in the youth training camp two years ago made a big noise. You should have an impression of it, right?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was silent for a moment. \u201cI remember.\u201dThere was a big event in the youth training camp two years ago.At that time, a teenager in the camp clashed with another group of people. In the process, both sides fought and several people were sent to hospital. The ambulance was called and it was said that the scene was very tragic at the time. If other people had arrived sooner than someone would\u2019ve surely died.The youth training camp that year truly wasn\u2019t peaceful. First, someone committed suicide by jumping off the building and then the violent incident happened. The media reported on it for a whole month so that even Jing Yuanzhou heard about it when he normally didn\u2019t pay attention to such gossip.Later, he didn\u2019t know what happened but these things were suppressed and there was no more news about it.\u201cI remember this ID, plus the operation. I can be sure it was the genius newcomer who almost killed someone!\u201d Ku Tianlu\u2019s voice came from the receiver. \u201cHey, this kid is very interesting. It has been a long time since he showed up and I thought he had given up on e-sports. As a result, he didn\u2019t even change his ID. Isn\u2019t he afraid that others will remember him?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was a bit surprised. \u201cIt turned out to be him\u2026\u201dHe remembered the genius jungler of the youth training camp who received all the attention. Even the management of BK was eager to acquire him until such a big thing happened.Ku Tianlu had a headache and couldn\u2019t help scolding. \u201cSpeaking of which, if you really wanted to transfer then there are so many giants to pick from. Yet you went to a team like GH who hasn\u2019t even qualified for a formal league. Look at the teammates arranged for you. None of them are familiar! Forget the others but this jungler really isn\u2019t good. If you can persuade the team then it is best to persuade them. If it doesn\u2019t work then pay attention. Don\u2019t grab a dangerous player and let him drag the whole team into the water! Ouch. My heart is really breaking for you\u2026\u201dThe e-sports circle had always been very strict about the management of dangerous players. If one wasn\u2019t careful, they might lead the entire team to sink.Jing Yuanzhou had maintained his good reputation in the circle for many years and Ku Tianlu was worried that his reputation would be compromised. It was the normal reaction of an ordinary, concerned person.It was just that he liked to nag when he was worried and this was really unbearable. It was too noisy.Jing Yuanzhou quietly held the phone away from him and listened to Ku Tianlu nag as usual. From this long distance, he barely heard any of the content. He was immersed in a thoughtful silence when he looked up and happened to see a familiar figure walking around the corner of the corridor.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes slowly lowered and he stood up straight. \u201cThere is something here. I\u2019m hanging up first.\u201dHe didn\u2019t wait for Ku Tianlu to respond and casually cut off the call.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yan had just finished talking on the phone and looked up when he seemed to notice the gaze. Jing Yuanzhou vaguely guessed something from the unhappy expression. \u201cWere you rejected?\u201dLin Yan stared at Jing Yuanzhou with a strange expression and quickly understood. \u201cDo you know the origin of this kid?\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t conceal it. \u201cWe met an anchor just now in the team battle. Ku Tianlu called me after seeing it. I know a bit.\u201dLin Yan sighed somewhat helplessly and pinched his eyebrows as he got a rare headache. \u201cIt was a big situation at the time. The league only removed Abyss from the youth training camp to calm the situation down but this cut off his recruitment to other professional clubs. It is even impossible to do live broadcasts. He can only do this type of accompanying business that isn\u2019t streamed. It is distressing. Who can stand it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed. \u201cI think he can bear it. I heard from Ku Tianlu that it has been two years and he hasn\u2019t even changed the ID?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than that! All his accompanying accounts have the same name except for changes in individual symbols!\u201d Lin Yan sincerely admired it. \u201cThis young man, he probably feels from the bottom of his heart that he hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. He is using this way to protest against the world. The style looks pretty cool but it is really stubborn. If he changes his name and blocks his face, who on the Internet will know who he is? After all, he was recognized as a talented rookie from the beginning. Based on his strength, it would be better to find a platform to be a streamer.\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at Lin Yan. \u201cYou feel sorry for him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m distressed but not that distressed.\u201d Lin Yan spoke calmly. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to see talents being ruined.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had listened to Ku Tianlu\u2019s \u2018warning\u2019 and had a bit of doubt about this genius jungler. However, looking at Lin Yan\u2019s current attitude, he thought there was something hidden and he let go of all his considerations. He asked with great interest, \u201cHasn\u2019t he already rejected you? What do you plan to do next?\u201dLin Yan had a good understanding of himself. \u201cWhat else can I do? I will naturally play to my advantage of pestering people.\u201dJing Yuanzhou chuckled. \u201cThat is true. You are the best at pestering people.\u201dThen he stared deeply at Lin Yan. \u201cIt is a pity.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a pity?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I\u2019m not the only man you\u2019ve pestered.\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help coughing. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it like you\u2019re being abandoned by me. I am indeed a bit \u2018fickle\u2019 but I\u2019m not \u2018scum\u2019.\u201d\u201cIt will take time to prove it.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou gave him a meaningful look and changed the topic. \u201cSo how are you going to use this advantage?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s eyes stayed on Jing Yuanzhou for a while before he showed an incomparably pure smile. \u201cAre you interested in a home visit?\u201dJing Yuanzhou saw this expression and clearly realized. \u201cThen you are ready to make the best use of me?\u201d***As for Chen Yushen, he never expected that the other party would run all the way here even after he expressed a clear rejection.Then he saw Jing Yuanzhou and something shook slightly in his numb eyes. Anyone who paid the smallest bit of attention to the Burning Hot professional league would know Titans. In addition, talk about Titans transfer to GH had been raging on the Internet lately. It was really hard to forget this memorable face.The name Titans was full of glory even if he switched from a powerful club to a third-rate club. It was unlike Chen Yushen, who became low and dirty two years ago.The dilapidated warehouse was filled with all types of clutter and the remaining space was very narrow. The bed and desk with the computer already occupied most of it. Chen Yushen stood at the door and didn\u2019t move. He hesitated over whether or not to invite the two people here.Lin Yan noticed the young man\u2019s flustered expression and smiled. Then he naturally poked his head in. \u201cYou live here? It is a really unexpected e-sports atmosphere!\u201dChen Yushen stared at him deeply before turning sideways. \u201cGo in and talk.\u201dThe warehouse was extremely crowded once it was filled with the three of them. Chen Yushen usually lived alone so he naturally didn\u2019t prepare anything to entertain guests. Currently, Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou were sitting on the bed while he was sitting on the gaming chair. There was a weird silence.Chen Yushen obviously disliked the feeling of his private space being spied on. He frowned slightly and opened his mouth first. \u201cI already said it on the phone. I have no more interest in playing professionally. If there is nothing else, we don\u2019t need to waste our time with each other.\u201d\u201cYou said it on the phone but we haven\u2019t talked face to face.\u201d Lin Yan spoke while looking at Chen Yushen\u2019s expression. He saw it wasn\u2019t as repulsed as he had thought and Lin Yan lowered his eyelashes slightly. \u201cAfter all, there are so many duplicitous people in the world. You said it on the phone but who knows if you really want to play professionally or not?\u201dChen Yushen watched him with a deep gaze and the corners of his mouth lowered slightly. \u201cThere is nothing false. I really\u2026\u201dHe paused for a moment to take a breath before continuing. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to play professionally anymore.\u201dLogically speaking, the attitude here was very clear. Normal people should leave wisely but Lin Yan was more wear-resistant than anyone else. At this time, instead of unhappiness, his lips were raised with interest. \u201cYou really aren\u2019t going to fight anymore? In other words, you were prepared to fight before? You had such high passion previously. Why give up?\u201dChen Yushen frowned at the deep questioning. It wasn\u2019t known what he was thinking but something gloomy flashed in his eyes. Then he squeezed out in a low voice, \u201cI feel disgusted.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had been silent the whole time. Now he heard this and thoughtfully looked up.Lin Yan didn\u2019t seem surprised by such an answer. He just gave a clear \u2018oh\u2019 and smiled coldly. \u201cSo is it the people who are disgusting or the dream of becoming a professional player?\u201dThe expression on Chen Yushen\u2019s face slightly froze.Lin Yan leaned down slowly, crossing his fingers under his chin as he brought the two of them closer. He stared firmly at Chen Yushen. \u201cYou had so many options in the two years since leaving the youth training camp. If you really let it go as you say, why do you still have to play in this shabby place as an accompanying player?\u201dAfter the incident that year, all the professional clubs avoided him and Chen Yushen had long been accustomed to this situation. Therefore, when Lin Yan extended an invitation to him, he instinctively thought the young boss had no knowledge of his past and did such a ridiculous thing.Chen Yushen heard this and couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cYou\u2026 why did you come to me when you know what happened?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s tone was slow and calm. \u201cIt is because those people aren\u2019t worthy to ruin your future.\u201dSuch words entered his ears and caused Chen Yushen\u2019s body to tremble uncontrollably. He was lost in thought for a while.Lin Yan saw the teenager\u2019s head hanging down and his tone slowed down a bit. \u201cI know that some things were indeed very unfair to you but in this way, there has never been any permanent fairness. These injustices shouldn\u2019t be the reason for giving up. Since you feel wronged and unwilling, you should hit those people in the face. Compared to your present state, won\u2019t you be happy trampling on them on the field?\u201dChen Yushen didn\u2019t speak. He just blinked hard to try to suppress the sore feelings in his eyes. It had been two years. He locked himself up in such a small space for two years. During this period, people called him names numerous times but no one had ever asked him \u2018why.\u2019 Why did he hysterically try to kill those animals?!Chen Yushen\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved and he opened his mouth. \u201cYou don\u2019t know anything\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I really don\u2019t know anything.\u201d Lin Yan\u2019s attitude was particularly frank. \u201cSo let\u2019s put aside the past and talk about other things.\u201dHe looked at Chen Yushen kindly. \u201cCan the ideal of becoming a professional player really be given up when you want? There are so many people in the world who want to take this road but they\u2019re stuck at the door due to a lack of talent. There are also some people who have the ability to stand on the field but are forced to give up due to various unchangeable reasons. Do you know how lucky you are compared to their regrets!\u201cDo you really want to personally block such a road in front of you because of your own anger?\u201d He paused for a moment and sighed softly. \u201cThe strongest newcomer jungler, Abyss.\u201dAbyss.Even Chen Yushen couldn\u2019t remember how long it had been since someone called him by this name. These words were gentle but they felt like a heavy punch, hitting the most vulnerable part of his heart.Next to him, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s fingers holding his phone trembled slightly. He instinctively looked at Lin Yan, observing the face where not many emotions could be seen. A person who had the ability to stand on the field but was forced to regretfully give up due to unchangeable reasons.Who was it?In the restored calm, Chen Yushen\u2019s lips trembled slightly and unknowingly, his eyes completely turned red. He lowered his head and buried his face in his arms, his dull voice coming out intermittently. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me\u2026 I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dIn this enclosed space, every second had habitually made him even more disappointed in the field of e-sports. It had accumulated for months and then years. He thought his active heart would\u2019ve been completely numb to the overwhelming scolding but he didn\u2019t expect the pain could still be so severe.He was once full of longing for his dream of becoming a pro. Could he really just give up?In the narrow sobs, gradually only the teenager\u2019s depressed sobs were heard.Lin Yan calmly watched him and slowly stood up after a long silence. \u201cThink about it. If you change your mind then call me at any time. Don\u2019t worry, I promise you in the name of Titans that our GH will definitely be your best choice.\u201dThe tool man Jing Yuanzhou who had been ready to get up, \u201c?\u201d***Outside the warehouse, faint starlight was already visible. Up to when they left, the stubborn boy still had his face buried in his arms in order to not expose his embarrassment.Sitting in the driver\u2019s seat, Lin Yan recalled the last scene he saw. Then he shook his head emotionally. \u201cThis age is good. He can still feel such shame.\u201dHis tone of voice made it seem like it wasn\u2019t him who had just made a person\u2019s emotions go out of control.Lin Yan waited a while and finally noticed that Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t spoken since leaving Chen Yushen\u2019s place. He glanced over doubtfully. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with God Jing? Did my ideological guidance move you? Someone in your position?\u201dJing Yuanzhou opened his mouth. \u201cThere are also some people who have the ability to stand on the field but are forced to give up due to various unchangeable reasons.\u201dThe arc of Lin Yan\u2019s mouth slightly lowered.Jing Yuanzhou still watched him with a slightly raised eyebrow. \u201cI don\u2019t know why but I always feel that Coach Lin understands this feeling very well?\u201dThere was a moment of silence in the car.Lin Yan\u2019s eyes shook slightly. A moment later, he chuckled. \u201cIt seems that the mood of my speech just now was in place? Thank you to Titans for recognizing my acting skills.\u201dJing Yuanzhou and Lin Yan watched each other for a moment before Jing Yuanzhou lowered his eyes slightly, withdrawing his gaze. \u201cYou are welcome.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJing Yuanzhou originally thought that Lin Yan would show Chen Yushen the persistence Lin Yan used to tirelessly chase after Jing Yuanzhou previously. He didn\u2019t expect that since returning to the base on that day, Lin Yan would never mention the name again. It was as if he had completely forgotten this person.Since not all members of the team had been organized, the training activities with the team didn\u2019t officially start. There were several figures sitting sporadically through the training room. Gu Luo had tasted the sweetness and completely fell in love with partnering up with Jian Ye. Right now, the two people had joined together to score passionately.Jing Yuanzhou had just returned from a run outside. He planned to go back to the dormitory to take a bath when he glanced inside the training and caught a glimpse of the person lying in front of the computer. He paused slightly.He changed directions and stepped inside. The computer screen in front of Lin Yan was showing a live broadcast interface. In the video screen in the lower left corner, the short hair with varying colours was particularly eye-catching. If it wasn\u2019t for the beautiful face that could support such a hair colour, it would really be like a peacock with its tail spread open.As for Lin Yan, he was supporting his face with one hand as he stared in a motionless manner at the man\u2019s face. A faint smile that made people think easily was floating on his face.\u201cOh, so you like this shamate style.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t until the man\u2019s voice was heard from behind him that Lin Yan\u2019s senses came back. He blinked slowly under Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze and then pulled a chair from the side. \u201cYou came just right. Take a look.\u201dJing Yuanzhou silently watched such an extremely calm attitude and walked over to sit down on the gaming chair. Since he had just finished running, he was shrouded with a shallow smell of sunlight. It seemed to have a different type of warmth compared to the indifferent appearance in the past.Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help taking a sniff. Then he took the earphone out of his left ear and naturally sent it to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s ear. \u201cLook at this.\u201dThere was a soft touch when his fingers touched the base of the ear and Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s movements stopped for a moment. Before he could continue to feel it, Lin Yan took his hand back and the sensation of touch on his ear had already drifted away.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes slightly lowered.Lin Yan returned to his position and gently tapped on the table with his fingertips. \u201cI have to say that this person is really interesting.\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at one of the live rooms and couldn\u2019t ignore such an evaluation. In fact, even without Lin Yan\u2019s introduction, he would\u2019ve recognized this peacock.It was the former shooter of the QOG team, Bi Yaohua. His ID was BB and he had the face of an e-sports\u2019 Mr Perfect. It was just that he was a real trash-talk king.At first, he was a game streamer and he never put a handle on his mouth. Every time he did a live broadcast, he could talk from beginning to end. As long as a player made a mistake in the game, ridicule was inevitable.However, who could guarantee that there would be no mistakes during the entire process? Looking at the entire Burning Hot League, there were no players that Bi Yaohua hadn\u2019t scolded. It was so much that within one year of his debut, he had offended almost the entire circle.Since then, the title of \u2018Trash Talk King\u2019 had spread like wildfire. As an ordinary game streamer, Bi Yaohua had a large group of girlfriend fans who paid for his appearance. He might like to trash talk but his skills as a shooter were extremely high.He trash talked all the shooters in the professional league and then turned around and threw out a few videos. The videos showed the right response to the opponent\u2019s mistakes and the double face-slap was evident.This hatred value was too much but he was so strong that it made people speechless. They could only swallow down their grievances. After all, e-sports relied on strength to speak. The QOG Club was attracted by Bi Yaohua\u2019s top skills in the beginning. They resisted the resentful eyes of the entire league and signed him.After becoming a professional player and being bound by the rules of the league, Bi Yaohua\u2019s behaviour did converge a lot. He occasionally couldn\u2019t control his mouth but he was safe as long as he paid the fine. A period of time passed steadily.This lasted until the knockout match of the Spring Competition. QOG was brutally abused by the opponents in the second game of the BO3 (best of three). Bi Yaohua played extra hard but his teammates were sleepwalking and he couldn\u2019t support it alone. Seeing that their crystal was going to be broken, he couldn\u2019t bear it and filled the entire chat window with swear words.The incident happened too suddenly and it was broadcasted live, so the director didn\u2019t have time to react. This classic scene spread to all corners of the world. The entire e-sports circle was shocked.There were differing opinions about this matter. After all, it was incredible that someone like Bi Yaohua didn\u2019t hesitate to leave the club despite the liquidated damages. Still, one thing was certain. It was that a serious disagreement had occurred in the QOG Club.More people thought that Bi Yaohua, who claimed to be strong and thought highly of himself, was toxic to the team in itself. His eyes grew on the top of his head every day while he played with the average players of QOG. It was only a matter of time before he broke up with them.The matter of the suspension caused a lot of noise. Combined with the resolute withdrawal from the claw, the e-sports media released many announcements at the same time. which brought a wave of rhythm. There were more than 10 versions alone and this allowed Bi Yaohua to enjoy the treatment of becoming a resident of the hot searchHowever, the Trash Talk King was still the Trash Talk King. Without the bondage of the club, he didn\u2019t care about the background of the media. Anyone who mentioned his name was directly greeted by him one by one. There was no disadvantage even if it was one against 10.In the end, the major media were so angry that they joined together and wildly released all his previous black spots. The scene was very spectacular. He was the man who unified the entire media network!In this regard, some sunspots deliberately collected a lot of information and submitted it to the Burning Hot officials, wanting to get him into trouble. However, Bi Yaohua was already suspended and he hadn\u2019t signed with other teams after ending his contract with QOG. In a sense, he was a free man outside their jurisdiction and they couldn\u2019t stop him.Due to Ku Tianlu, the gossipy former vice-captain, Jing Yuanzhou had seen the entire process. Apart from being amazed by Bi Yaohua\u2019s ability to talk, he reserved his opinion on the truth behind this matter.Don\u2019t mention the fact that Bi Yaohua could scold the mass media. This didn\u2019t seem like a person who would blow up just from playing a game. The timing of the media\u2019s rush was also a bit too subtle. He had probably offended someone.Jing Yuanzhou wasn\u2019t a person who liked to be nosy. He forgot about it after watching the liveliness. In addition, he had no regular contact with weak teams like QOG. Therefore, it was thanks to Lin Yan that he got to know this Trash Talk King for the first time.Among other things, Bi Yaohua\u2019s face was really worthy of being the \u2018e-sports\u2019 Mr Perfect.\u2019 The premise was if people could ignore his mouth that was always making people go crazy.Through one of the earphones, the man\u2019s languid voice was somewhat contemptuous. \u201cYes, the shooter on the opposite side is Brother Monkey. If nothing goes wrong, he might be able to hold on for six minutes. Hmm, don\u2019t say anything. If I play against Brother Monkey, I win 91% of the time and lost 10% of the time\u2026 if I accidentally sell all my equipment in the store, I might have a chance of being killed by him.\u201dThe barrage was flying due to his words.[The Trash Talk King really dares to say this? Has QOG been forgotten by others?][In any case, you are a shooter of a top 8 team. What type of courage do you have for someone who was eliminated in the knockouts?][My husband\u2019s face and mouth makes me blush as always.][Forget BB. It is only during the live broadcast that BB is blind. Otherwise, why not go to the World Championship if he is so good?][Hahaha, he is in the suspension period! This type of Young Master B wants his teammates to serve him. Which team would dare to ask for him?][The Trash Talk King playing in the World Championship\u2026. in his dreams?]Bi Yaohua leisurely looked at the barrage while buying equipment. \u201cTo tell the truth, is it that amazing to play in the World Championship? Take a look at the teams participating in the global competition this year. Are they going to play? Obviously, they are just travelling at public expense!\u201dAt this point, he gave a low laugh. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t mention BK. The finals were so bad that even Titans transferred. Relying on the little boy whose hair hasn\u2019t even grown yet? How can he be expected to win? It would be good if he doesn\u2019t pee his pants on the field.\u201dLin Yan heard this and smiled at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cGod Jing, is there a strong sense of presence?\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe barrage exploded the moment Titans was mentioned.[Do you think Titans is you? Blaming teammates after losing the match?][Low strength is low strength. QOG shouldn\u2019t have signed you at the beginning.][Titans must have his own considerations for transferring. Do you think you can go to heaven if you play well in the Spring Competition? The first person to curse in the professional arena, awesome!][Damn, forget about the others. You even pulled Titans into the water to cushion your back. This is really unbearable!]The line of soldiers arrived at this time. Bi Yaohua cleaned up a few soldiers and sneered. \u201cYes, Titans is naturally different from me. If he met the same teammates as me, what would he do? I am seriously quite curious about this?\u201dHis mouth lowered while speaking and his character took two steps forward under his control. Before he finished speaking, a kill prompt appeared on the interface.[If you can BB, you can kill. Hold!]Single kil!The entire barrage was quiet for a moment.Bi Yaohua glanced at the time and laughed. \u201cLook, six minutes. It is just right.\u201dHe finished speaking and the live broadcast room was covered with \u2018666\u2019. This immediately pushed down all the scolding of the sunspots.In any case, the Trash Talk King\u2019s strength as a shooter was well recognized.Lin Yan couldn\u2019t hold back his laugh. He turned to the side slightly and almost leaned on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s body. \u201cAs expected of Titans. You might no longer be in Jianghu but there are legends about you everywhere.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked at as he felt the soft hair touching his cheeks. \u201cThank you Chief Lin for giving me the opportunity to become a legend.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Lin Yan answered slightly. His slender fingers touched the face of the man on the screen and he cocked his head to look at Jing Yuanzhou. He asked strangely, \u201cIs it possible?\u201dIt was a question without a beginning and end. Such a fluttering voice entered his ears and Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s answer was also subtle. \u201cHis strength is okay.\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help raising his eyebrow with a smile. Then he turned the chair around and slid back to the computer. A row of golden letters flashed across the live broadcast room.[Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Nothing to Do with BB.][Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Nothing to Do with BB.][Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Nothing to Do with BB.]Such big movements quickly attracted Bi Yaohua\u2019s attention.His live broadcast room might seem overwhelmingly popular but 90% of them came to see his jokes. Apart from an occasional girlfriend fan who gave money for his face, it was really rare to see this type of big spender.He was stunned for a moment before saying in a dedicated manner, \u201cThank you Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess for the deep-water fish mine. Do you have anything to say?\u201dSuch a sentence that was normal in other live broadcast rooms caused a frenzy of scolding on the barrage. Bi Yaohua was accustomed to it and was unmoved. He saw the brightly shining letters of the big spender and spoke slowly. \u201cOh, the big spender and overlord wants me to join\u2026\u201dThere was a slight pause here. Bi Yaohua was originally just looking casually but now his entire body froze. \u201cYou want me to join\u2026 the GH Club?\u201dThe moment he spoke, the frantically taunting barrage slowly down instantly. Lin Yan had never been a person to consider the psychological endurance of others and he continued to send a barrage.[Yes, the brand new GH Club is waiting for you. Are you willing to sign?][It is the one that is enough to make Titans abandon a giant club like BK. I believe you won\u2019t refuse it ~^_^~]Bi Yaohua\u2019s mouth that was always full of words became quiet for a moment. After a while, he said word by word, \u201cOf course, I, will, not, refuse!\u201dThe barrage went crazy.[BB and Titans will be in the same frame in the future? Did Titans agree?][What devil configuration is this?][Ahhhh, am I dreaming? My two male gods are going to be together?][The Trash Talk King is a male god? Is the brain of the GH management flooded with water? Is the team ready to disband before it is even formed?][I said that Titans shouldn\u2019t have transferred. Now he is pitted!][Is this fake? I was just taunting him and not my face hurts.][Daring to accept a player like BB. Is GH unable to recruit people?]Lin Yan heard a satisfactory reply and didn\u2019t care about the comments. His narrow eyes curved in a smile as he turned to look at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cLook, it is so simple.\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t hesitate to give praise. \u201cYes, it is great.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn Lin Yan\u2019s words, Bi Yaohua was a person who knew what he wanted. He made a high evaluation of such excellent quality. So the next day, the player who knew how to pursue his dream appeared at the entrance of the GH base with a suitcase. A pair of sunglasses was covering most of his face but the colourful peacock hair and unstoppable arrogance was obvious at first glance.The thing that surprised Lin Yan the most was that Chen Yushen also arrived at the base despite not being heard from after the home visit. He didn\u2019t say any greetings in advance. He just carried a backpack and appeared in front of everyone without any warning. The boy\u2019s face still contained an indifference to human feelings. His lips were pressed tightly together in the face of the enthusiasm he was met with and he said nothing.As the team manager appointed by Lin Yan, Luo Mo immediately prepared for the contract signing of the two people.Lin Yan hugged his body and leaned against the wall as he watched the busy figures in the meeting room with satisfaction. He couldn\u2019t stop smiling once he saw that all the members of the team were finally here.Bi Yaohua glanced at his signing contract and signed his name with flamboyant characters. It had to be said that he was a very clear person. He knew exactly what he wanted and never refused the opportunities presented to him. This was the case when he previously signed with QOG. Now he joined GH for no other reason. It was purely himself.In contrast with this Trash Talk King, it was Chen Yushen who was seriously studying the conditions. He sat quietly at the conference table while frowning slightly. The sunlight leaking in from the surrounding area coated him with a shallow edge, making him look pale and pure.Lin Yan\u2019s eyes fell on such a figure. He recalled the boy\u2019s previous experience and his eyes shook slightly. Unlike others, he had a god\u2019s perspective and he knew very well what happened in the youth training camp. Due to this, he felt more distressed after seeing Chen Yushen.Chen Yushen was such a thin young man and he experienced so much hardships when facing those people. Chen Yushen vaguely felt Lin Yan\u2019s gaze and raised his head to look over. He mistakenly believed that his future boss was dissatisfied with his hesitant attitude. The corners of his lips lowered slightly and he raised his pen to sign his name.The contract signing was completed and the last two spots on the team were officially confirmed.Lin Yan clapped his hands and announced with a smile, \u201cTeam GH, all the members are assembled!\u201dLuo Mo carefully closed the last two contracts and secretly sighed with relief. Recently, the officials of Burning Hot Assembly were urging him to hand over the list of players. They almost arranged a staff member to directly squat in front of the club door.Now the clouds opened to reveal the moon. He could finally do business and he couldn\u2019t help but have tears forming in his eyes!The last two players were in place and the whole team finally showed its first appearance.Although many clubs arranged substitute players, Lin Yan currently had no plans in this regard.After all, they weren\u2019t a veteran club with a deep history. If he set up a substitute position just after the team was completed, it might bring a sense of distrust and cause the players to think they might be replaced. This would be counterproductive.Lin Yan gave a day for Chen Yushen and Bi Yaohua to get used to the environment. The next day, he summoned everyone to the training room and briefly explained the next plan and arrangement. \u201cEveryone should know about Burning Hot Assembly so I won\u2019t go into details. If nothing goes wrong, this show will officially start recording in two weeks. In the next few days, I will take everyone to make the team uniforms and also take some promotional photos. Remember to set aside some time in advance. Don\u2019t go wandering outside on those days.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a secret that GH wanted to participate in the recording of this e-sports variety show. However, when he heard Lin Yan\u2019s suggestion, Gu Luo had the thinnest skin and was a bit nervous. \u201cThis type of variety show\u2026 is it a reality show? Then we will be on TV?\u201dLin Yan sent him a funny glance. \u201cThe specific situation will be explained in detail after Manager Luo understands the specific situation. TV might not be available but it will definitely be on the major online TV platforms. If you feel that your idol burden is heavy, take advantage of these days. The general standard is\u2026\u201dHe glanced around and his gaze finally fell on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s body. He smiled slightly as he said, \u201cIt is enough to look almost as good as Titans.\u201dJing Yuanzhou met this gaze and smiled. \u201cI think I also need to work harder.\u201d\u201cThis type of positive attitude is very desirable. Everyone, you should learn from the captain.\u201d Lin Yan clapped his hands and looked around. \u201cHowever, I think our team has absolutely no problems in terms of appearance. Even a random shooting will make it an idol promotional film. You don\u2019t have to be too nervous.\u201dLin Yan patted the documents in his hands. \u201cThe team\u2019s secondary coaches and data analysts will be on duty in the next two days. Apart from the tasks related to the variety show, I will send a training schedule to everyone\u2019s emails. The specific content is different for each person so remember to pay attention to it. The club\u2019s salary for everyone isn\u2019t low but the penalties are also severe. To avoid the situation of selling yourself to compensate for the fines in the future, I advise you to pay more attention.\u201dHe turned to Bi Yaohua with a smile. \u201cIn particular, BB. Your mouth might be the club\u2019s main source of income. You should work hard.\u201dBi Yaohua was suddenly named and he gathered the colourful bangs touching his forehead. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll try my best and try to converge when I\u2019m live broadcasting. Scolding people without swearing is a technical job but I think I can do it.\u201dTry his best, converge, live broadcasting and\u2026 scolding people without swearing?! The team manager Luo Mo heard this and almost couldn\u2019t breathe. He always felt that he could foresee the dark future of running around for the team\u2026Lin Yan didn\u2019t continue to say anything else about the specific arrangements. He just lowered his head and glanced at the time. \u201cThe formal training will begin the day after tomorrow when the assistant coaches and analysts leave. Before I start training, I want to better understand everyone\u2019s fighting styles. I have briefly discussed it with the captain. Titans and I will lead one team each in a 3v3. It is two wins out of three games. Then let\u2019s divide into groups. Uh\u2026\u201dHe raised his head when speaking and happened to meet Gu Luo\u2019s expectant gaze. His words paused slightly. \u201cThen Gloy, you should go with Titans.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThank you, Coach!\u201dBi Yaohua stood behind and raised his hand. \u201cBrother Yan, let me go with you. As long as I\u2019m here, I can definitely help you stabilize the field.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t even lift his eyelids. \u201cNo, you also follow Titans.\u201dBi Yaohua froze. \u201cThe side lanes and mid-laner are all over here. Combined with me as a shooter, aren\u2019t you afraid of a direct output explosion?!\u201dLin Yan looked indifferent. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d\u201cGive me a reason for not wanting me?\u201dLin Yan spoke with a blank expression. \u201cYou\u2019re too noisy.\u201dBi Yaohua struggled hard. \u201c\u2026I can try to control my mouth.\u201dLin Yan used an affirmative sentence. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t control it.\u201dBi Yaohua, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t give Bi Yaohua any more chances to force it. He clapped in a business-like manner. \u201cOkay, go pick your commonly used spot and prepare to fight.\u201dThe GH team\u2019s first civil war grouping was decided just like that. Lin Yan saw that the spot opposite Jing Yuanzhou was empty and walked over. He pulled out the chair and sat down. Jing Yuanzhou glanced at him. \u201cDo you really want to fight like this?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s mouth curved up casually. \u201cFight. It is BO3 and the loser will make today\u2019s dinner.\u201dHe smiled and added, \u201cMake, it, your, self!\u201dJing Yuanzhou agreed. \u201cOkay.\u201dBased on the lineup alone, Jing Yuanzhou had the most important output of the top, middle and bottom lanes. No matter what angle it was analyzed from, Lin Yan didn\u2019t have any advantage with a jungler and support. In addition, Chen Yushen might be a genius jungle but he had been an accompanying player for two years. It was unclear to what extent his strength had fallen.On the other hand, in addition to Jing Yuanzhou, Bi Yaohua had just retired from the professional league. He was much more experienced when it came to technique.Even so, Lin Yan\u2019s attitude at this moment was so calm. Jing Yuanzhou was very curious as he wondered what medicine this person was selling.Lin Yan sighed with relief after pulling everyone into a custom room and arranging the groupings. \u201cGet ready.\u201dThen he put the headphones around his neck and pressed the start button. Since it was 3V3, they used Frozen Canyon, a map that was narrower than the team terrain. There was no BP link in this mode. The two sides communicated in their respective team voice channels and started to choose heroes.Lin Yan announced the names of two heroes, and Jian Ye in the support position and Chen Yushen in the jungler position were slightly taken aback. Still, they locked onto it cooperatively.The moment the character import interface was seen, both sides saw the opponent\u2019s lineup. Bi Yaohua glanced at the heroes on the opposite side and didn\u2019t feel very good. \u201cWhat lineup is this? Crazy! How do we fight against this lineup?!\u201dGu Luo silently lowered his head, looked at the hero he had locked onto and spoke sincerely. \u201cWhy do I feel like I can\u2019t kill one by myself?\u201dJing Yuanzhou finally understood Lin Yan\u2019s thoughts at this time and couldn\u2019t help smiling without speaking. Compared to the three strong lane fighters on the blue side, the three heroes on Lin Yan\u2019s red side were more biased.Jian Ye unsurprisingly took his best big breasted healer. Chen Yushen used Eddie, a barbarian who was mocked as a cold bench professional in the league. As for Lin Yan, he used the number one steel tank, Harris the lava demon.After this game, a very esoteric question could probably be discussed during the replay. Which side was stronger? The sharpest spear or the strongest shield?In fact, before pushing to the second defensive tower, the strong output blue team wanted to vomit. Forget anything else. This lineup alone was really disgusting!The barbarian Eddie and lava demon were already hard to beat up. Then there was the big breasted healer like Jian Ye behind them to give them life. On the field, these assassin heroes could be seen advancing and retreating like ghosts. It might look extremely pleasing to the eye but their set of moves barely lowered the opponent\u2019s blood before the opponents received love from Jian Ye and were full of health.Bi Yaohua finally saw his own crystal being broken by the opponent. No matter how good his mentality, he couldn\u2019t help wanting to throw the keyboard. \u201cWow, this routine is so dirty! It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve met someone dirtier than me!\u201dGu Luo silently glanced at him, mouth twitching slightly. He didn\u2019t expect that the Trash Talk King would even scold himself.After the game, Lin Yan took off his headphones and touched the thin sweat on his cheeks. \u201cIf you\u2019re ready then continue.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had lost to such a routine but he was in a surprisingly good mood. He leaned away from his computer to take a look. \u201cCoach Lin, are you still planning to use this lineup in the next game?\u201dHe thought that Lin Yan would reply with \u2018guess\u2019 but there was only a brief silence. It was unknown what Lin Yan was thinking but his face didn\u2019t show any joy from winning. Rather, he seemed a bit absent-minded. He only reacted after a long time by casually replying, \u201cYou will know when you see it.\u201dSuch a state obviously wasn\u2019t like him. Jing Yuanzhou had a vaguely strange feeling. He frowned and was about to say something when Bi Yaohua next to him called out. \u201cTitans, we\u2019ve chosen the heroes.\u201dLin Yan lowered his head and entered the team voice channel to do the lineup arrangement for this round. Jian Ye glanced at it and couldn\u2019t help praising. \u201cWonderful!\u201dThen he noticed that Lin Yan hadn\u2019t put on his headphones. He was surprised for a moment before realizing. Then he started typing. [Brother Yan is witty. We can communicate like this and they won\u2019t hear our lineup arrangement!]Lin Yan\u2019s mouth curved slightly and he didn\u2019t deny it. He just sent a smiling expression to the chat channel.It was only when the two sides finished importing the map and the characters refreshed that he picked up the headphones and put them on. He pulled the microphone over and spoke in a calm tone. \u201cIf we win this game then our dinner will be stable. If someone makes a mistake and we have to play the third game\u2026 hehe\u2026\u201dThe low laughter that came from the voice channel sent chills down Jian Ye and Chen Yushen\u2019s spines.On the blue side, Jing Yuanzhou had discovered the obvious restraint relationship between the two sides\u2019 lineup at first glance.Apart from anything else, Lin Yan always seemed able to predict the tactical arrangement. It might only be a fight between team members with an entertainment nature but the two short games could capture the weakness of their lineup very accurately.It was also in the case of a completely blind selection. This was terribly sharp. The only problem was that in this game, Abyss didn\u2019t use the jungler he was good at. He used the blood singer Sherian who was often used on the side lanes.Meanwhile, Jing Yuanzhou was the strongest side lane player in the league. The lineup might be perfectly suppressed but this game was more anxious than the previous one. The two sides took turns to destroy each other. Once it reached 18 minutes, the last wave of kills was over and only two figures remained on the map.Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou were sitting in opposite positions while the two figures on the screen were also facing each other. Without warning, the dark blue figure suddenly moved forward and officially launched an attack.Lin Yan frowned slightly and he started tapping on his keyboard.The health bars on both sides were falling rapidly.Jian Ye stared at the interface nervously and subconsciously glanced at the time. His instinct as a support made him give a reminder, \u201cSix seconds! Brother Yan, be careful! His flash will be available in six seconds!\u201dSuch a voice was particularly abrupt in the silent background. There was a thin layer of sweat on Lin Yan\u2019s back and a tingling sensation spread over his body, causing Lin Yan\u2019s control of the Menya elf to pause for a moment.This was an extremely small detail but at such an overly critical moment, it was a mistake that couldn\u2019t be ignored. By the time Lin Yan\u2019s mind returned, the flaws had inevitably been exposed. There might be a chance to recover if the person in front of him was Gu Luo or Bi Yaohua. However, the person facing him on the battlefield was Jing Yuanzhou.The outcome had probably been decided.Lin Yan sighed inwardly but didn\u2019t give up the chance to try and save it. He quickly had his character complete an S-shaped walk. Just as he was preparing to meet the opponent\u2019s pursuit, he found that Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t seemed to notice this mistake. He still kept the same operation and rushed up.The moment the two characters collided, a health bar was completely emptied. The dark blue figure fell heavily in the canyon.Bi Yaohua sighed with regret. \u201cOh, what a pity. Almost!\u201dGu Luo seemed a bit unwilling. \u201cAre we going to cook\u2026\u201dLin Yan pulled off the headphones and threw it aside. He silently operated the character to smash the crystal.Lin Yan stared at the victory sign on his screen for a few seconds before slowly exhaling. He stood up and said, \u201cYou can tell Luo Mo in advance the ingredients needed for tonight and have him prepare them. I\u2026 will go and smoke a cigarette.\u201dThen he turned and walked out without looking back.Jing Yuanzhou stood up at almost the same time. \u201cI\u2019ll go out too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJing Yuanzhou found Lin Yan leaning against the wall beside the balcony. There was a cigarette between his fingers. In the midst of the curling smoke, his eyes were slightly narrowed as he looked at the distant scenery. Occasionally, a gust of wind blew and the fire at the tail of the smoke flickered faintly. It was clearly a very faint light but it was inexplicably dazzling.Perhaps Lin Yan heard the sound of footsteps because he glanced sideways. He didn\u2019t show a surprised expression when he saw Jing Yuanzhou. He just skillfully blew out the cigarette smoke and slowly straightened. \u201cSmoke one?\u201dJing Yuanzhou took the cigarette he handed over and placed it in his mouth. \u201cLet me borrow your fire.\u201dLin Yan took out the lighter and Jing Yuanzhou leaned forward. He looked down and could see the man\u2019s eyelashes up close. The smooth, angular lines were indescribably perfect.After lighting up the cigarette, Jing Yuanzhou leaned against the railing of the balcony and watched Lin Yan quietly for a while. Then he asked for no reason. \u201cHow are you?\u201dLin Yan shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dThe mistake just now was so obvious that the other person must\u2019ve noticed it. He wasn\u2019t surprised at all. Lin Yan didn\u2019t know why Jing Yuanzhou gave up the opportunity to kill him but he was still grateful. After all, this meant he would no longer have to continue the third game. In the end, he was too blind and self-confident. He thought that the 3V3 wouldn\u2019t have much impact. Yet he was affected in less than an hour.The feeling of coldness that shrouded him was so clear that even though his composure had gradually been restored, he still felt a trace of a cold back when the wind blew.Lin Yan sighed gently and raised his head to meet Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me previously why I don\u2019t play professionally?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes shook slightly and he didn\u2019t speak.Lin Yan\u2019s voice entered his ears. The flat and straightforward words seemed to be talking about someone else\u2019s matter. \u201cPTSD, which is a very common traumatic stress disorder. There is nothing wrong with my ears so normal work won\u2019t be affected. However, as long as I listen to the team voice channel in a closed environment for a long time, there will be tinnitus, auditory hallucinations and general numbness. It is like this.\u201dAs if to prove it, he lifted the hand that was inside his pocket and extended it to Jing Yuanzhou. It was noticeably smoother but he could still see the uncontrollable, slight shaking of the fingertips.Lin Yan noticed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me like this. It isn\u2019t a big deal. It is caused by something psychological and there is no cure. So\u2026 I just can\u2019t play professionally. In fact, it is good to be a coach although I occasionally have itchy hands.\u201dThen he laughed like it was no concern. \u201cThe situation is much better when lining up as a pair. However, the more voices there are in the voice channel, the more likely I am to be affected. I\u2019ve never tried 3V3 before. Regarding today\u2019s situation, I can only say that I overestimated myself. In short, thank you God Jing for sparing me. It is estimated that I really would kneel down if I had to fight the third match. Thank you for not killing me!\u201dHe was obviously understating it but Jing Yuanzhou felt a bitter pain in his heart. He couldn\u2019t help remembering the words Lin Yan said to Abyss and his eyes slowly lowered. This was obviously a person who was too distressing but he was always thinking about others in distress.Before Jing Yuanzhou knew it, the cigarette in his hand was about to burn out.Jing Yuanzhou put out the cigarette butt and threw it into the trash can next to him. He didn\u2019t continue the topic as he grabbed Lin Yan\u2019s hand and started walking. \u201cLet\u2019s go. I was willing to lose the bet so I\u2019ll cook for you.\u201dThe slightly trembling fingertips gradually calmed down in this man\u2019s generous and gentle palm.Lin Yan was slightly taken aback by this behaviour and the corners of his lips slowly rose. \u201cOh, Titans is cooking himself. This really isn\u2019t the treatment of ordinary people.\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought about it. \u201cIt is indeed your honour.\u201dFreestarLin Yan chuckled lightly and didn\u2019t say anything. The past that was circling in his mind gradually dissipated at the gentleness that came to his fingertips.That year, Lin Yan hadn\u2019t come to this world yet and had just joined the league. He was just a newcomer who had been selected into the professional team from the youth training camp. The one who wanted him was WP\u2019s captain, Zhang Anning.Their former shooter retired and WP\u2019s output position had been vacant for a long time. Lin Yan\u2019s arrival brought new blood to the team. Captain Zhang really valued him and personally looked after him since he joined the team.Lin Yan wasn\u2019t a shooter when he was in the youth training camp so Zhang Anning had asked his thoughts about this. Lin Yan didn\u2019t care too much. \u201cI can be any position as long as I can play professionally.\u201dZhang Anning\u2019s attention to Lin Yan was well known to the entire team but Lin Yan\u2019s strength was indeed top-notch. After playing several training matches, he was quickly acknowledged by the team.As a veteran team, WP had a very strange attribute. Every time they were a step away from the championship, all types of things happened. That\u2019s why the entire e-sports circle gave them the title of \u2018always second place.\u2019Zhang Anning was naturally unconvinced about this. After winning a fierce player like Lin Yan, he was full of hope for the next game. Lin Yan was driven by the emotions of his captain and combined with the joy of participating in the professional league for the first time, he played on the field with passion.After a wave of back-to-back victories, the sluggish WP finally made it to the finals again. During the team\u2019s motivation meeting on the eve of the final, Zhang Anning patted Lin Yan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cEternal, let\u2019s rush to the top glory together!\u201dZhang Anning never expected such a sentence to leave a trace that couldn\u2019t be erased from the young man\u2019s heart. Lin Yan respected Zhang Anning. Only he knew how much he wanted to stand on the championship podium with the captain.The finals were scheduled in the afternoon. The sponsor\u2019s side went crazy in the morning so Zhang Anning had to go and shoot an video. The venue and the sponsor\u2019s location happened to be in the same city. Zhang Anning had to cooperate with the team manager.Before leaving, he rubbed Lin Yan\u2019s hair and told him, \u201cYou have to warm up while I\u2019m away. This year\u2019s champion must be our WP. Obediently wait for me to come back, you know?\u201dLin Yan was playing a game to raise his hand speed at this time. He didn\u2019t even raise his head when he heard it and just laughed. \u201cI know, Captain. You are so long-winded.\u201dZhang also seemed to think he was acting like a mother. He smiled and turned to board the club-arranged car. Many years later, if Lin Yan was asked about the thing he regretted most in this life, it was probably that he didn\u2019t say goodbye to Zhang Anning.The players were preparing in the lounge when they received the bad news. A second ago, they had been talking about why the captain hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Everyone was stunned when they heard that Zhang Anning\u2019s car was in an accident on the elevated highway.Lin Yan reacted to the news and instinctively spoke first. \u201cDon\u2019t joke around\u2026\u201dThe team coach who came to convey the news didn\u2019t reply to this. Instead, he turned to the substitute and said. \u201cAh Min, you take the place of Captain Zhang.\u201d He finished speaking and the entire lounge blew up.The jungler couldn\u2019t hold back. \u201cWe are still fighting? The captain is currently in hospital and we don\u2019t know his situation yet you still want us to play the game?\u201dThe coach\u2019s eyes were also red but he stared at the jungler. \u201cYou just said that the situation is unknown! What can we do if we go there? Can we go in and do the operation for Captain Zhang? The team has finally reached the finals. What do you want to do? Abandon the match and go to the hospital? If you do this, do you think Zhang Anning will agree to it?!\u201dEveryone knew the truth but once it came to it, no one could guarantee that reason would overcome impulse. In the blink of an eye, the entire lounge was a mess. The jungler went mad and wanted to rush out. The coach asked someone to stop him and refused to let him out.The jungler\u2019s hysterical shouts could be heard from a distance. \u201cLin Yan, what is this stinky kid thinking? The captain is usually the best to you. How can you not say anything at this time?!\u201dCompared with the others, Lin Yan seemed a bit too quiet. He seemed to come back to his senses after hearing the words. He looked down and saw that his deeply embedded nails had caused a deep wound in his palms.His lips were an unusual white and his Adam\u2019s apple moved before he finally managed to say in a low voice. \u201cThis match, we must play.\u201dHis clear voice fell in such an environment, causing everyone to be stunned. Immediately afterwards, they saw Lin Yan slowly stand up. \u201cIt isn\u2019t early. It is time to warm up\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, his figure swayed slightly. The person beside him was frightened and hurriedly held him up. The team doctor quickly took a look. The stimulation had probably been too big and caused some disorder of the hormones in his body.The jungler stood beside him in a complicated manner. The jungler wanted to speak but finally, he could only rub his hair fiercely and curse in a low voice. \u201cFight! We must fight! Fuck!\u201dNo one knew what was going on but there wasn\u2019t too much time to think. A staff member carefully knocked on the lounge door and urged them.The substitute Ah Ming was a newcomer who had just been promoted from the second team. He never thought his first appearance would be in the finals. Before taking a few steps, he felt his legs were a bit weak. \u201cWhat to do\u2026 c-can I do it?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s expression was still a bit uncomfortable at this time and his face was sickly pale. Hearing this, he glanced back and said, \u201cEven if you can\u2019t do it, you have to do it.\u201dIn the finals, Lin Yan played with an unprecedented ferocity. The weakness of the substitute was obvious but he was forced to use his own effort to make up for the vacancy in teammates. The first four games of the BO5 were dragged to 2-2.Before the tiebreaker, everyone returned to the lounge to rest. There wasn\u2019t any more news about Captain Zhang so the atmosphere was inevitably depressed.Lin Yan couldn\u2019t stand the atmosphere and got up to go to the bathroom. On the way back, he happened to see the coach standing in a corner of the corridor and talking quietly. He couldn\u2019t hear the specific content clearly until the sentence \u2018couldn\u2019t be saved\u2019 entered his ears, causing him to instantly stiffen.Lin Yan\u2019s entire body was cold. When he looked again, the coach had finished the call and was crying while holding onto the railing. Lin Yan couldn\u2019t remember how he went back to the lounge or why he didn\u2019t shed a tear. Seeing that the game was about to begin, he followed the team to the arena again. The shouts seemed unusually different.The others didn\u2019t know the specific situation and completed the preparations with a serious face. They were under absolute pressure and no one spoke. However, as soon as the game started, a one-sided trend was shown.10 minutes into the game, WP had fallen into a complete disadvantage.Ah Min was pushed to do something beyond his ability. After the last four games, his nerves had already been strained to the extreme. At this time, the opponent\u2019s back-to-back killing caused him to completely collapse.The jungler was holding his breath and the cry of the substitute stimulated his nerves even more. Seeing that there was no hope of winning, he didn\u2019t hit his keyboard but he couldn\u2019t help releasing his feelings into the team voice channel. After a while, the mid-laner and support also joined in.The voice channel was full of cursing, crying, persuasion and arguments mixed together. It formed a nightmare of ignorance and endless repetition. The tearing of reason and emotion pushed Lin Yan to a critical point where he could be overturned at any time.He could feel himself surrounded and destroyed by so many sounds. Then a variety of more sounds emerged.At the end of all of this, only the man\u2019s gentle words were left. \u2018This year\u2019s champion must be our WP. Obediently wait for me to come back, you know?\u2019\u2018So if I do win this year\u2019s championship, will you come back as agreed?\u2019FreestarIn the last wave of team battle, WP was beaten four to one by the opponent. The other side pushed aggressively to the defensive tower while WP\u2019s base only had a thin figure left. The four opponents were low in health after the team battle but it was a 1V4 situation. Everyone felt the outcome was a foregone conclusion. However, Lin Yan\u2019s operations still didn\u2019t stop.[Eternal killed Uky!]He became unstoppable after the first message appeared.[Double kill!][Triple kill!][Quadra kill!][Ace!]It was over! The shooter with only a trace of health left faced opponents in different states. Then he completed a fantastic massacre in front of the audiences from all over the world! The ultimate champion was WP!The entire venue was boiling over and so was the circle. However, as officials prepared for the awards ceremony, it was discovered that all members of WP had left the arena. It was only at this time that everyone knew why WP chose a substitute to play.Unfortunately, Captain Zhang finally failed to keep his promise. Lin Yan, who brought back the championship trophy, rushed to the hospital only to see the peaceful figure with an endless pallor.The various voices on the field suddenly filled his mind and he slowly curled up, covering his head in the midst of the crowd\u2019s exclamations. How amazing was the operations in the final game and how regretful was the rest of the results?Just as the entire Burning Hot League thought there would be a new generation of god-level players in China, the ID Eternal completely disappeared from public view. This was his first and his final year.A year later, Lin Yan re-emerged but as a tactical analyst. Thanks to him, WP started their winning streak.The reason for the sudden change of the talented former player divided the outside world. Only Lin Yan knew that the people standing on the stage naturally needed someone to stand behind the scenes.It didn\u2019t matter if he felt regretful or unwilling, everyone had their own way. At least he had fulfilled his promise to his captain. It was actually quite good.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe two people came back and found the others discussing the menu for tonight.As the winner, Jian Ye ordered several dishes one after another, all of which were unceremoniously rejected by Bi Yaohua. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are saying. If I could make these things, would I be a professional player? The position of chef of a five-star hotel would be beckoning to me.\u201dIt was the first time since Jian Ye was born that he had seen such a shameless existence. The scar on his face trembled with shock. \u201cHave you ever been to a fast food restaurant? Do you dare to say that you haven\u2019t seen these dishes in a fast food restaurant?\u201dBi Yaohua had no ideological burden. \u201cI haven\u2019t been there. I\u2019ve only ordered takeaway.\u201dJian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dGu Luo was standing anxiously next to them, afraid that the two men would fight. He looked up and saw the two people walking in. Then he hurriedly greeted them. \u201cCoach, Captain, you\u2019re back!\u201dJing Yuanzhou asked about the result of the current discussion and nodded. \u201cList the ingredients. I couldn\u2019t hold on at the end and lost, so I\u2019ll make it for you tonight.\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help glancing at him.Gu Luo asked, \u201cCaptain, can you cook?\u201dJing Yuanzhou replied, \u201cI\u2019ve learned a bit.\u201dOnce Luo Mo got the list, he quickly put all the ingredients in place and sent them to the kitchen. Originally, Bi Yaohua and Gu Luo were going to help but within five minutes, they were \u2018sent out\u2019 by the expressionless Jing Yuanzhou.Bi Yaohua recalled the process of being rejected today and couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cYou dislike me so much. You will never know what you have lost because of this.\u201dJing Yuanzhou gave him an extremely indifferent look. \u201cNo matter what I lost, at least I have gained quiet.\u201dBi Yaohua, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck, even the reason for the dislike was exactly the same! Before he could speak again, Gu Luo told him, \u201cBrother, let\u2019s go. We shouldn\u2019t mess up the captain.\u201dBi Yaohua glanced at the messy battlefield caused by his struggle just now and eventually said nothing.Lin Yan leaned against the wall and couldn\u2019t help laughing as he watched the two men being pushed away. There was still the faint, dry taste of cigarettes in his mouth. He pursed his lips and looked back into the kitchen.Before this, it was hard to imagine what Jing Yuanzhou looked like wearing an apron. Now after seeing it, he felt like there was an indescribable harmony. The smoke and fire at this time revealed an indescribable warmth.After Bi Yaohua and Gu Luo left, the kitchen was instantly empty. However, this made the busy scene instantly become orderly.Lin Yan glanced at it casually. Looking at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s cooking posture, it didn\u2019t seem like he had just learned a bit. Rather, it was more like that of a chef\u2019s.There were still things being cooked in the pots on both sides. Seeing Jing Yuanzhou turn around to wash the vegetables in the sink, Lin Yan walked over quickly and took them. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was curious. \u201cCan you cook?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Lin Yan replied calmly. \u201cHowever, I can wash vegetables.\u201dJing Yuanzhou saw him carefully washing the vegetable leaves and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s very professional.\u201dThere was a table full of hot dishes and everyone ate until they were satisfied. Gu Luo couldn\u2019t help pulling out his phone to take a few photos of the table. This was Titans\u2019 cooking! He had no regrets in this life!Lin Yan didn\u2019t have as many thoughts as the little fan. He took a bowl of soup and drank it slowly. There was a warm feeling in his stomach that completely suppressed the uncomfortable chill from the afternoon. His entire stomach felt warm.The large table of dishes quickly emptied out. Everyone arranged the dishes and chopsticks together and placed them in the sink to be cleaned.Luo Mo saw the group of people preparing to go back to the dormitory to rest and suddenly remembered something. \u201cBy the way, the Burning Hot Assembly show contacted us today and said they are going to make an official announcement. Our team uniforms haven\u2019t arrived yet so the promotional photos can be released first. However, we have to confirm the ID to be used in the future. Come here to register it and then I will formally submit it.\u201dThe moment he spoke, Jing Yuanzhou had already picked up the pen and wrote down his ID: GH.Titans.Bi Yaohua took the pen from him and wrote: GH.BB.Jian Ye temporarily put aside the fruit he was eating after they came and came over to write: GH.Gun.Gu Luo wrote very seriously: GH.Gloy.Finally, there was only Chen Yushen left. His gaze stayed on the registration form for a long time and as if he had finally made a decision, he picked up the pen and wrote down the ID that hadn\u2019t been mentioned for a long time: GH.Abyss.Burning Hot Assembly officially published the list of participants in the program.The strength of the teams in the secondary league weren\u2019t comparable to the professional league but in the process of trying to get to the professional league, they had accumulated many inseparable old fans.In particular, the supporters of QU and IBB have always felt distressed about their teams\u2019 multiple defeats in the finals. Now there was an extra chance to compete for the qualification of the Autumn Competition and this was almost universally celebrated.[Although I feel that this type of variety show is completely for business, I can\u2019t refuse such temptation as a five year old fan of IBB.][Don\u2019t you know how IBB has played for the past two years? The final winner must be QU. 2B team, don\u2019t even think about it.][Hehe, don\u2019t be too beautiful. There are more than two teams in this variety show.][Passersby should shut their mouths. The only ones worthy to be seen in the secondary league are QU and IBB. The other teams will only burn your eyes.][Aren\u2019t you forgetting something? The GH that Titans transferred to also seems to be participating in this show? What do you think of God Jing\u2019s one against five?][Forget about it! What about GH\u2019s list? Why hasn\u2019t GH\u2019s list been shown yet?]Perhaps they heard the expectations of many netizens. Burning Hot Assembly soon released another Weibo post showing the list of players participating in the show.@Burning Hot Assembly V: #Burning Hot Assembly# @GH Club V.Brand new, setting sail. The first show in the industry.The list of all participating members is announced:Side lane: @GH.TitansJungle: @GH.AbyssMid-lane: @GH.GloyShooter: @GH.BBSupport: @GH.Gun\u2026\u2026]The difference with other clubs involved in the show was that GH\u2019s promotional photos were missing from the message. In a way, it made the brand new team even more mysterious. All fans had been severely abused by the news that Jing Yuanzhou moved to a third-rate club like GH. Now they saw the list and inevitably felt a crit once again.However, Titans had been fighting in the league for so long and had always spoken with strength. Compared to many players with unstable foundations, his fans were relatively mature. Apart from the BK fans who stopped being fans or turned black, most of the diehard fans saw that everything was a foregone conclusion and expressed their expectations and blessings for the future under this Weibo post.Then everyone\u2019s attention gradually moved down the list and found BB.Lin Yan had been too blatant about recruiting people in the live broadcast that day. Some of the sunspots squatting at the scene had already heard the news and spread it to each other in private. They had been waiting for the program\u2019s official publicity to make a wave.So in a series of comments with Titans\u2019 name, some of the discussion inevitably ran away in a different direction.[BB and Titans in the same frame? It is a lifetime series!][GH\u2019s management really doesn\u2019t understand. I admire it.][I\u2019m laughing. He is on the same team as Titans. How can he shift the blame after losing the game? It is too embarrassing as the Trash Talk King!][What can\u2019t BB do? There is no one to blame so he will blame himself? Is it hard to blacken himself?][The others are all new faces never seen before. There is this toxic BB in the team. Won\u2019t they really roll over?][Let me tell everyone a joke. BB is still suspended.][The suspension period doesn\u2019t affect participation in the show. Maybe GH looked for him for this reason. Signing him is a discount!][6666, the discount is okay.]GH Club\u2019s base.People were sitting in the lounge and holding their phones in their hands. They all looked different. The team uniforms were delivered this morning. According to the plan, they were supposed to take publicity photos today. However, it suddenly rained and the pick-up car was stuck in the middle of the road.Everyone was idle. They knew the program would make the announcement today and were naturally curious. They just hadn\u2019t known until they saw it. This sight\u2026 their mood was really complicated.Chen Yushen repeatedly refreshed the comments several times. It was only after confirming that no one had mentioned his name on Weibo that he was a bit relieved. He had still been in the youth training camp when things broke out. No one paid much attention to it apart from those in the circle. He wasn\u2019t well-known compared to Bi Yaohua.Chen Yushen knew that once his own affairs were dug up, it would have a negative impact on the club\u2019s reputation. Still, he couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit relieved right now. Then he looked at Bi Yaohua who was scrolling through the comments.BB truly deserved to be BB.Not only was a displeased expression missing, Bi Yaohua actually chose a comfortable position on the sofa, his legs lifted leisurely and his expression very satisfied. \u201cLook, this is the arena of a king. Have you counted the comments? Look at this battle! My fans are no less than Titans\u2019 fans?\u201dGu Luo was silent for a moment before reminding him. \u201cThey are all your black fans\u2026\u201dBi Yaohua glanced at him strangely. \u201cI say, what is wrong with you young people? Are black fans not fans? The black fans are also true to me. If they have no feelings for me, how can they chase after me every day and blacken me? There is one thing to say. This is all deep love!\u201dThen he read a few comments about himself and smiled with satisfaction.\u201dForget it, you won\u2019t understand even if I tell you. Do you know what Brother is called? Ostentatious!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only Lin Yan clapped his hands carelessly. \u201cThank you, Brother Bi. It really helped save us a lot of publicity expenses. Do you see how moved Manager Luo looked?\u201dLuo Mo was very busy because of public relations matters. He suddenly heard such a sentence and his mouth twitched slightly. \u201cYes, the publicity effect is really\u2026 very amazing.\u201dHe was so moved that he was almost crying!Bi Yaohua waved his hand very modestly. \u201cDon\u2019t be too polite. We are all from the same club. In the future, Brother Bi\u2019s traffic is everyone\u2019s traffic. Resources should be shared.\u201dFuck this awesome resource sharing! Luo Mo leaned back on the sofa and endured the urge to beat someone up. He took a deep breath and had a headache as he reconfirmed the edited content. Then he sent it nervously. It was just a matter of suppressing the Trash Talk King\u2019s \u2018top traffic\u2019 with this one move!GH\u2019s official Weibo was gaining popularity at a speed visible to the naked eye. At this time, under the attention of the public, they released their first post.[@GH Club V:Thank you, Titans for your trust in the club. You are worth the 35 million yuan transfer fee! #Fresh flowers #Fresh flowers@GH.Titans@BK Club V\u2026]Fuck, Titans\u2019 transfer fee was actually 35 million?! They knew about Titans\u2019 transfer but the specific amount hadn\u2019t been revealed. The moment this news came out, no one cared about Bi Yaohua anymore. The entire network exploded again. After all, before this, the highest record for a transfer fee was Luni\u2019s 28 million three years ago.Now it had jumped up a level. GH was backed by the Lin Group. It was well-known to have abundant funds but they never expected it to have this much money! What was the concept of 35 million? It was enough to buy an independent club! If someone else\u2019s family was a big club then GH was undoubtedly a \u2018rich\u2019 club!The original dissatisfaction of the old Titans fans disappeared in an instant. At this moment, they couldn\u2019t help crying silently. He might\u2019ve reached the age of 23 and he might be destined for a short career but it was 35 million! Their Titans was always worth it!Jing Yuanzhou saw the entry of #Titans 35 million# go on the hot search in minutes and he glanced at Lin Yan with a smile.In fact, he had already guessed it previously. Xiao Lin was already ready to use the signing fee to make a fuss after Jing Yuanzhou was signed. Otherwise, how could the response speed of the various public media be so fast? The articles that popped up in an instant were obviously all prepared in advance. Such a transfer fee might seem like a sky-high price but in terms of the team\u2019s promotional effect alone, the 35 million was completely worth the money.The transfer amount not only exploded the attention of ordinary netizens who paid attention to the field of e-sports, it also spread quickly among professional players. The top players appeared one after another to repost this Weibo and the scene was very spectacular.In this situation where there was heated discussion across the entire network, the management of the BK Club saw the frequent forwarding notifications and almost fainted on the spot with their hands covering their chests.This bandit club GH. Not only did it abduct their pillar player, it also dragged them down into the water for publicity. It was really making them deranged, deranged! At this time, every repost was like a knife stabbed in their chests. Medicine, medicine! Where was their quick-acting heart relief pill?In any case, everyone\u2019s attention was attracted by Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s transfer fee and the number of sunspots jumping up and down in the comments finally decreased.Luo Mo had just sighed with relief when he heard Bi Yaohua complaining next to him. \u201cThese people are too superficial. How can they be attracted to money like this? Is my BB not talented enough? Am I unworthy to be the Trash Talk King?\u201d\u201cBah\u2026 deserve it! You deserve it!\u201d Luo Mo endured his urges and squeezed out a smile. Then he glanced at the WeChat message that he had just received and changed the subject very quickly. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t keep looking at it. The car has arrived and is waiting for us at the door. Go quickly! The studio has an appointment time and can\u2019t keep waiting for us.\u201dIn the distance, they could see the business car parked at the door. Taking publicity photos had nothing to do with Coach Lin Yan but after all, he still had the identity of the boss behind the scenes. He also went to take a look.He got in the car and looked around inside. Chen Yushen was sitting in the front row next to Bi Yaohua, who was still looking at his mobile phone. Jian Ye and Gu Luo sat behind him, leaving only the last row with empty seats. Jing Yuanzhou was sitting by the window and looking at him.Lin Yan got into the car and sat down. The car started very quickly. There was the patter of rain outside and the air in the car inevitably became a bit sticky. At first, Lin Yan looked down at his phone without paying attention. Then he vaguely noticed something and turned his head to meet Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze.He didn\u2019t shy away and directly handed the phone to Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cTake a look, how is my content?\u201dJing Yuanzhou took a look at the contents of the comment.[I think that GH\u2019s management is crazy. Spending 35 million to buy Titans? Isn\u2019t it good to use this money to directly buy a club in the professional league? How old is Titans this year? He is a 23 year old veteran player. By the time he enters the professional league, won\u2019t he retire without winning the championship?]Further down, Lin Yan had sent a reply with a side account.[I don\u2019t know if Titans will retire but people like you obviously don\u2019t understand life. Does GH care about the professional league performance? They obviously enjoy the process of creating brilliance from the bottom! How good do you think a professional league club is? How many teams will be remembered a few years after disbanding? GH is different. On the field, they will send all their opponents home safely. A team that has never played in the secondary league will go all the way and win the championship of the world finals. Tsk, an existence that will be recorded in history. A strong force, the pen!]The moment this reply came out, it was immediately followed by cynical comments.FreestarHowever, Lin Yan didn\u2019t seem to see it. He huddled up close to Jing Yuanzhou and read his reply several times. It seemed the more he looked at his reply, the most satisfied he became. \u201cAccording to me, people these days are too short of pursuit. They don\u2019t understand the fun of nurturing at all.\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed the moment he heard the words.Lin Yan raised his eyebrow. \u201cWhat are you laughing at? Did I say something wrong?\u201d\u201cThe words are right. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth twitched unnoticeably. \u201cIt is just that I haven\u2019t felt the feeling of being nurtured and I suddenly feel a bit shy. What should I do?\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThis person had never been nurtured. As for shyness, it was really hard to see.The two men looked at each other and didn\u2019t even notice that the car had reached the destination.The others had long gotten off the car. Luo Mo waited a long time without seeing anyone and peeked his head inside the car in a confused manner. \u201cThe two people inside, won\u2019t you come down? It is almost too late to shoot. If it is about cultivating feelings, can you leave it to later?\u201dFreestarLin Yan felt that his assistant\u2019s temper was really becoming bigger after taking over the club.He muttered as he walked outside, \u201cWhat are you urging about? Even if I want to cultivate a relationship with Titans, it is still contributing to the internal harmony of the club. Ah Mo, as team manager, you can\u2019t just focus on the appearance in front of you. You have to look a bit further, you know?\u201dLuo Mo was speechless. \u201c\u2026I was wrong. I was too superficial. Even so, hurry up.\u201dLin Yan wanted to say something but Jing Yuanzhou had already left the car. The big umbrella opened and blocked the light rain falling on his head. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with Manager Luo. There is time later if you want to cultivate our feelings.\u201dIt sounded like something was wrong. Still, Lin Yan pondered on it and felt the same so he nodded. \u201cYes, there is a lot of time in the future. Let\u2019s take photos first.\u201dHe had taken a few steps toward the studio when he reacted. \u201cNo, when was I angry?\u201dJing Yuanzhou gave a low laugh. \u201cYes, you weren\u2019t angry. I got it wrong.\u201dThe studio had long been waiting for their group. There was a professional styling team plus photographers. Added together, there were more than 20. Seeing the GH group finally arrive, they all swarmed up and started ferociously.Lin Yan had nothing to do so he grabbed a fashion magazine and sat down on a sofa, flipping through it absently. It didn\u2019t take long for the team members to finish the styling and makeup. Lin Yan heard the movement and looked up. Then he gave a thumbs up without hesitation. \u201cYes, the GH idol group will debut!\u201dAfter speaking, his eyes fell on Jing Yuanzhou and he sincerely praised, \u201cCaptain Jing is the most handsome.\u201dAmong these people, Bi Yaohua had a colourful hair style and was the showiest one. He originally wanted to stroke his hair flirtatiously and pose. Then he heard Lin Yan praising Jing Yuanzhou and silently opened his mouth. Finally, he turned to Chen Yushen next to him. \u201cAbyss, tell me the truth, am I handsome?\u201dChen Yushen had gone to sleep late last night and was forcibly woken up to take the promotional photos today. At this time, he was holding back his sleepiness. He heard this and glanced at Bi Yaohua with blurred vision. \u201cHandsome\u2026\u201dBi Yaohua smiled. \u201cSo out of all the brothers in the team, who is the most handsome?\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s face was expressionless as he tried to support his eyelids that wanted to fall. His mind was sleepy and he didn\u2019t want to think at all. \u201cYou\u2026\u201dBi Yaohua was satisfied. \u201cYes Abyss, don\u2019t look at your stinky face normally! You still have vision when it comes to looking at men!\u201dChen Yushen watched this person silently, a question mark slowly forming on his face. Why did he seem to be so highly praised for no reason?On the other side, the photographer had set up the shooting scenes and called them over. The entire shooting process went smoothly. First, everyone took a single photo, a posed photo and finally the group photo. Even so, it was three hours later when the last photo was taken.Most of the players who played e-sports were night owls. They might not stay up as late as Chen Yushen but they didn\u2019t fall asleep early. After all of this suffering, all the GH players yawned.The cameraman finally said it was fine and everyone sighed with relief. They were about to retreat when Jing Yuanzhou suddenly called out. \u201cWait a moment.\u201dThe other four people instinctively looked over. Jing Yuanzhou noticed their inquiring gazes but didn\u2019t speak. He turned around and spoke to the man on the sofa next to him. \u201cLin Yan, come here.\u201dLin Yan had watched the entire shooting process and was considering whether to stay to supervise the selection. Now he stood up from the sofa doubtfully. The moment he approached, Jing Yuanzhou reached out a hand and pulled him over. Before Lin Yan could react, the wide GH uniform fell on him, covering his shoulders.Due to his daily habit of exercising, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s figure was better than Lin Yan\u2019s body. At this time, the team uniform with a man\u2019s unique scent on it quietly caged him in.A low voice gently entered one ear. \u201cMake a pose?\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help raising his head at such a tone and happened to see the camera of the photographer facing him. He was surprised for a moment before soon understanding. The corners of his lips curved up slightly. He cocked his head in the direction of Jing Yuanzhou and made a victory sign with a bright smile. Behind them, the other members of GH also gathered.The photographer captured this scene and pressed the button quickly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The sunspots who had been criticizing the GH Club for acting mysteriously were temporarily blocked. There was no other reason. They could only say that they had never seen such a pure and unpretentious official club post.[@GH Club V: Sorry for keeping everyone waiting. It is because we only completed the signing of all the players a few days ago. This morning, we took the players to take promotional photos the moment the team uniforms arrived. Here are the beautiful photos that had been freshly released for less than an hour. I\u2019ve picked a few photos that haven\u2019t been touched up. Take a look. #Photo #Photo #Photo\u2026]The netizens laughed at the content of the official post. Only signed all the players a few days ago? If they remembered correctly, the lineup for Burning Hot Assembly was just released? This meant that when the club signed up for the show, it was still an empty shell. What gave them the courage?The sunspots might be late but they were never absent.[A rough team is a rough team. I suddenly doubt the origin of these players.[They can even sign BB. Can\u2019t you see the management style?][Is it okay for me to hug the Buddha? I seem to be frantic before the exam.][What to do if I feel a bit grounded? Hurry up, come and wake me up!][Just signed the players, ordered team uniforms and took promotional photos. I don\u2019t know what to say except 666.][What is the full name of GH? Go Home? Won\u2019t this cannon fodder team really be hammered? Is this preparing for a round trip home for the variety show?][How can it be cannon fodder? They have Titans. One against five is completely stress free. GH aims to be the champion of the World Competition, okay!][Hahaha, the yin and yang people upstairs.]GH\u2019s second official Weibo post was released and there were thousands of comments per minute. Most of the traffic was brought by Titans and BB. However, as the number of comments increased, the details quietly changed.[Wuuuuuu, my husband is still as handsome as ever.][Fuck, I didn\u2019t notice it until now. All the photos that have been sent out haven\u2019t been retouched? The beauty of this time is too strong!][This person with the close-cropped hair and the scar is a bit handsome. Is he the jungler? His blind sniping style must be fierce.][That grandma grey boy seems to have slightly red ears. Hahaha, he is blushing after taking a promotional photo. Isn\u2019t he cute?][Titans is really the captain. This face, these legs, I love it.][Is the player second on the left really a trainee who was picked up to make up the numbers? This stinky face is truly sensational!][What is with all the love-struck fools popping up upstairs? E-sports relies on strength. What can be eaten with just the face?][I can\u2019t see that the GH team is playing games. Isn\u2019t this preparing an e-sports men\u2019s idol group?][Will it be freestyle?

Please make your debut!]In just a few hours, the black fans were desperately blackening the comments area. On the other hand, a new group of fans were wildly praising them.After all, the strength of Titans and BB were well known but not much was known about the other three. After a long period of time, publicity of an e-sports team was released and it gave people the impression that a men\u2019s idol group was making their debut.Luo Mo saw everything and inevitably fell silent. He had obviously asked many colleagues for experience in advance in order to manage the team well. So why was the style still completely wrong? At what step was the problem? Or did he have more potential to be an entertainment agent?Lin Yan seemed to be very satisfied with the effect of this publicity. \u201cIn any case, our team has absorbed a stable fan base. So in the next show, we must perform well and not disappoint everyone\u2019s expectations of us, you know?!\u201dBi Yaohua raised his hand. \u201cYes Coach, I have a problem.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201dBi Yaohua pointed to the discussion content of the official Weibo and asked sincerely, \u201cHow do you feel any expectations from these comments?\u201dLin Yan reached out a finger and swiped on the screen. Then he lightly tapped on a new entry at the end of the hot search list. \u201cIsn\u2019t this obvious enough.\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s gaze shifted a bit.#GH idol boy group, please debut#His mouth moved and he finally squeezed out a few words in an amazed manner. \u201c\u2026Is this okay?\u201dLin Yan patted Bi Yaohua on the shoulder. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say it yourself? Black fans are also fans. They follow you step by step and keep blackening you! In that case, can\u2019t they be regarded as fans? Be confident. Regardless of girlfriend fans or boyfriend fans, they really like your face, okay?\u201dBi Yaohua, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was the first time he had been encouraged to be confident.FreestarLin Yan\u2019s chicken soup continued. \u201cSo it doesn\u2019t matter if they are after your flesh, body or technique. Don\u2019t doubt that it is all love!\u201dBi Yaohua was silent for a moment as he was completely persuaded. \u201cCoach, your words\u2026 really make sense!\u201dLin Yan was satisfied with this education of love and clapped his hands. \u201cSo what are you doing? In order to meet the love of GH\u2019s fans, hurry up and go practice!\u201dThe assistant coaches and data analysts had been on duty these days. The recording time of Burning Hot Assembly was approaching and there wasn\u2019t much time left for them to train.Everyone had received their training schedule previously but they didn\u2019t have time to get together for group training. At this time, they logged into their accounts and quickly lined up as five. Everyone\u2019s ID had been uniformly and neatly changed to the team format and it seemed they had finally gained a sense of formality. They gave this practice team a very grounded name: Home Team.Headphones hung around Lin Yan\u2019s neck as he watched the game. He grabbed the headset from time to time to say something. He was always holding a notebook in his hand so he could record at any time and anywhere.It usually took a lot of time for a team to get used to each other but GH\u2019s training in the afternoon went very smoothly. After all, everyone had strength. The team was just established and the opponents they could be ranked against were low. They won several games in the blink of an eye.By the time Lin Yan announced that the group training was over, it was already 10 o\u2019clock in the evening. Looking out the window, only a patch of dappled light was left.Bi Yaohua sat down and relaxed his muscles and bones. He looked at the eight game winning streak and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIt is comfortable with strong teammates. The entire process is like cutting vegetables. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve enjoyed every game like this. I punched through the bottom road.\u201dGu Luo added from next to him, \u201cI also punched through the middle lane.\u201dJian Ye couldn\u2019t help reminding him. \u201cThat\u2019s because you have Brother Gun to safeguard you. You can release your crazy output under my watch.\u201dJust now, it had been a complete crushing. Chen Yushen didn\u2019t have a chance to play as a jungler or even gank. He almost drifted aimlessly like a ghost in the jungle. At this time, he listened to their conversation and didn\u2019t say anything. He just sighed quietly.Lin Yan had sorted out the previous records in the blink of an eye. He saw them sitting there chatting and quickly made a decision. \u201cI know that it\u2019s still early from your bedtime. Since you have nothing to do now, I\u2019ll give you a project.\u201dThe team members looked up. \u201cWhat project?\u201dLin Yan took a look at the time. \u201cFrom now on, last hitting training will last for two hours. It will be disbanded on time at midnight.\u201dAmong all the training projects, the practice of last hitting soldiers was undoubtedly the most boring. The thought of lingering with these soldiers for two hours caused everyone\u2019s faces to collapse.\u201cOur team was established late and there isn\u2019t much training time left. Therefore, we have to start from the beginning.\u201d Lin Yan was never vague when arranging tasks and he didn\u2019t forget to remind them with a smile, \u201cRemember to start the video. I will check them one by one. If I find that someone is missing one second then they will have to make up for it with three more hours tomorrow.\u201dThe moment he spoke, everyone quickly sat back in front of their computers.Jian Ye thought about it and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cBrother Yan, as a support, do I also have to practice it?\u201dFreestarLin Yan didn\u2019t raise his eyelids. \u201cPractice, of course practice. What if one day, you encounter a strong opponent and our shooter is tortured to death by them and is waiting for resurrection or on his way back from resurrection? The output is dead 80-90% of the time. Who will the economy be left to? Should it be given to the opponent\u2019s soldiers?\u201dFreestarBi Yaohua, \u201c\u2026Why use the example of a shooter? As a senior shooter, I feel offended.\u201dLin Yan smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s my problem. Let\u2019s assume the dead person is a mid-laner.\u201dGu Luo who was suddenly shot by a gun while lying down, \u201c?\u201d\u201cHum hum, okay, hurry and train.\u201d Lin Yan turned to look at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cCaptain Jing, you don\u2019t need to practice. Follow me to the meeting room.\u201dThe other four heard this and couldn\u2019t help looking up enviously. This gaze was like looking at a special student receive preferential treatment.Lin Yan glanced at them. \u201cDon\u2019t look. Wait until the day you have several world championships and I will also give you these privileges.\u201dEveryone, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dStill taking such a personal attack? They were going to train and practice last hitting the soldiers, goodbye!Proofreader: NaoPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They watched the videos of the first few rounds at a high speed before Lin Yan asked, \u201cDid you find anything?\u201dJing Yuanzhou replied without hesitation, \u201cThey are very strong.\u201dThis was a high rating from Titans but his expression didn\u2019t look at ease. He frowned slightly. \u201cIt is hard to arrange.\u201dIn the public\u2019s impression, it was natural to hope that the team they supported would have absolutely strong players. However, there had never been a team that achieved a configuration of full top players.The reason wasn\u2019t a lack of funds. The main problem was the allocation of resources.Depending on the core of each team\u2019s combat style, the allocation of resources would naturally be different. For example, the BK team that Jing Yuanzhou played for previously was completely based on his lane.It was normal for weaker players to give the top players money. However, if all players were strong then this balance was obviously difficult to grasp. After all, no player with absolute ability was willing to be a background board for others. During the transfer period every year, many players chose to be listed because they weren\u2019t satisfied with their treatment in the team.In GH\u2019s current situation, all the teams encountered just now were weak and could be crushed uniformly. However, what if they encountered slightly stronger teams? If the entire economy was evenly distributed then problems would easily be exposed. At this time, the existence of a core became crucial.Both Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou knew this but they also knew it was a cruel thing for talented players to sacrifice one\u2019s economy to satisfy the team. These young players were carefully selected by them so they were less willing to deprive these players of the opportunity to show their talents.Lin Yan was a person who cherished talent so he had been thinking seriously about this issue all night. Now he obviously had an idea.He heard Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s words and his mouth twitched. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t difficult to arrange, why would I need to do this as a coach?\u201dHe took out his notebook, turned to a page and pushed it to Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cLook at this.\u201dJing Yuanzhou saw the ten or so densely listed plans instantly and was slightly taken aback. \u201cThese are all your thoughts from tonight?\u201d\u201cYes, it is just a part of it. I have to go back and carefully set it out.\u201d Lin Yan took out a pen and made a few quick circles in the book. \u201cI think that in the present situation, these three options will be a bit more appropriate.\u201dHis hair fell slightly and his smile became more wanton. \u201cWho stipulates that a team must have someone sacrifice themselves? Since everyone has the strength to be a core, it is okay to let everyone become GH\u2019s core. Captain Jing, what do you think?\u201dHis tone slowly stretched out and the expression in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes shook slightly. He had to say that such an ideal was like reaching for the sky but if it was truly realized, it would undoubtedly make people realize true invincibility. It was crazy but enough to make people excited.There was a brief silence before Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s lips curved up slightly. \u201cYes, you are right.\u201dIt was unknown why but Lin Yan always found the coaxing attitude in this low voice particularly useful. He bowed his head seriously and wrote a few more remarks. \u201cThen it\u2019s decided. I\u2019ll work out a specific training plan when I go back tonight. I have to ask them to at least familiarize themselves with these routines before the show starts recording.\u201dJing Yuanzhou reminded him. \u201cIt is only a few days away.\u201dLin Yan waved his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, time can always be squeezed out. They are young, full of energy and have good physical strength. I will ask Luo Mo to pay more attention to nutrition. It won\u2019t be so easy for them to collapse.\u201dFreestarJing Yuanzhou thought about it before nodding. \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Then I will try to satisfy you\u2026\u201dLin Yan raised his eyebrow.FreestarJing Yuanzhou gave a low chuckle. \u201c\u2026Arrangements.\u201dNo one thought that GH\u2019s first closed training would begin without warning. It was a week after receiving the notice from the Burning Hot Assembly show that the closed gate of the GH base was opened again.In the morning, the arranged official staff member was waiting early at the door of the GH Club. After a while, a few figures could be seen in the distance.Jian Ye looked up at the sky in a confused manner. \u201cAh, this is sunshine\u2026\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s face was even stinkier than normal. \u201cSleepy.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s body shook with every step. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m currently a balloon\u2026 do you feel that way?\u201dBi Yaohua cursed in a low voice. \u201cFuck, I feel like I\u2019ve become 10 years older in the past few days.\u201dThe cameraman brother had set up the camera in the blink of an eye. Once the lenses were focused, he was shocked by the deep circles under the eyes of the GH members.His mind hadn\u2019t returned when Bi Yaohua, who was in the front, gave him a big hug. \u201cThank you program group for saving us from our misery. You are really our saviours!\u201dThen after the hug, he entered the car and directly fell asleep. Immediately afterwards, the others also squeezed into the car with empty eyes. In just a few seconds, snoring could be faintly heard.The cameraman was frozen by this strange scene and wasn\u2019t sure whether to continue shooting or not. By this time, Jing Yuanzhou had come to him and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard. Our team members have just finished closed training and they are a bit tired. Let\u2019s make up for it later.\u201dFreestarThe cameraman, \u201cEh? Ah\u2026 okay.\u201dHe slowly put the camera away and couldn\u2019t help glancing at the sleeping people in the car. This was the end of training? What type of devil training could make people like this?Lin Yan was the last one to get on the vehicle. The moment the door closed, the business car officially set off. He sat in the front passenger\u2019s seat and glanced at the \u2018sea of corpses\u2019 through the rearview mirror, shaking his head helplessly. \u201cStill too weak! This physical strength isn\u2019t good. It is such a good age. How can they be so weak?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was the only one in the car who was still in a good condition and he laughed. \u201cThis is the first time it has lasted so long. They probably aren\u2019t used to it. They will get used to it after a few more times.\u201dLin Yan accepted it with some difficulty. Then he glanced sideways at Jing Yuanzhou and spoke sincerely. \u201cI have to say Titans, after trying it, you still have the best physical strength.\u201d\u201cYes, as long as you\u2019re satisfied.\u201dThe driver in the driver\u2019s seat felt his foot shaking and he almost stepped on the accelerator. GH was actually so exciting? Were they really prepared to let this be recorded?FreestarThe program group had arranged a five-star hotel for them. This treatment could be called very good.GH got out of the car with sleepy eyes and saw a staff member running over to look at them. \u201cHello, can I get someone to come with me to check in?\u201dLin Yan glanced at them and sighed. \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dHearing his words, the others took out their ID cards. Once it was Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s turn, he thought about it before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201dFreestarLin Yan had no opinion on this and nodded. He let Luo Mo take the players to the lounge first while he went with Jing Yuanzhou to the lobby to check in. Today happened to be the day when all the teams participating in the show were gathered. Along the way, they saw many players in various uniforms.Lin Yan was an outsider and no one knew him, but Jing Yuanzhou was like a mobile signboard that attracted a lot of attention. Players in the sub-leagues were looking forward to an opportunity every day. Many people naturally regarded the top players in the professional league as their idols and always paid great attention to them.Now they actually saw Jing Yuanzhou. They didn\u2019t dare rush up to talk to him but they talked excitedly amongst themselves. From time to time, a few words would pierce their ears and someone would inevitably feel sour.Lin Yan frowned and couldn\u2019t help glancing at Jing Yuanzhou. After a while, he glanced over again.Jing Yuanzhou saw his movements and was amused. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201dLin Yan smiled. \u201cLooking at your good appearance.\u201dJing Yuanzhou followed his words with a smile as he responded calmly, \u201cYes, you look good too.\u201dThe two of them got their room cards from the front desk and went to the lounge where the GH people were waiting.Since they had just finished the devilish closed training a while ago, Lin Yan considered the team\u2019s mental state when recording the show and wondered, \u201cTell me, was I a bit too cruel? Should I take them out tonight to relax?\u201dJing Yuanzhou told him, \u201cI think they would be more willing to sleep in their rooms.\u201dLin Yan smiled. \u201cIt seems so.\u201dFreestarAs they spoke, they passed around a corner. Lin Yan inadvertently raised his head and paused slightly when he saw something. \u201cGun Zai and Abyss? What are they doing here?\u201dJing Yuanzhou followed his gaze. \u201cThe opposite team uniform seems to belong to the ZX Team.\u201dBased on this angle, the two sides could be standing on opposite sides of the corridor. It should be an accidental meeting. It might seem like a meeting of old acquaintances but the atmosphere at the scene was obviously tense.Just then, someone on the ZX Team laughed softly. \u201cAbyss? What a coincidence. I didn\u2019t expect to meet you here. Calculating it carefully, we haven\u2019t seen each other for two years, right?\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s expression sank to the bottom in an instant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saw Chen Yushen ignoring him and gave a gloomy smile. \u201cYou are still the same.\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t know the opposite person but he still felt there was something wrong with the atmosphere. He saw the little person getting ready to step forward so he took one step in front and slightly raised his tone, \u201cWho are you? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dJian Ye\u2019s appearance actually wasn\u2019t fierce. He just had a unique coolness. However, at this time as his eyes were slightly narrowed, the scar on his face was elongated and his aura opened up.The little man only reached up to his shoulders. This person looked up and flinched instinctively. He gulped and backed away. Then his gaze swept over Chen Yushen behind Jian Ye. \u201cAbyss, I saw your ID on the team roster. I thought it was just a coincidence. I didn\u2019t expect it to actually be true. You have returned to the e-sports circle? It is really enviable to have teammates guarding you like this!\u201dThe other members of ZX obviously didn\u2019t understand the relationship between the two and asked at this time, \u201cLAN, is this your friend?\u201dLAN\u2019s mouth twitched in a smile that wasn\u2019t a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t dare have a friend like this but I am quite familiar with him. I still remember when we were at the youth training camp together. We also played on the same team. Who knew\u2026\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s body shook slightly and he interrupted without any expression. \u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201dLAN looked at him strangely. \u201cWhat can I do? I am just reminding everyone since we are participating in the same show. In particular, shouldn\u2019t your teammates pay attention? You also know what you look like when you become aggressive. What if you start a conflict? You won\u2019t always be as lucky as last time. If you really kill someone\u2026\u201dHis mouth curved in a ridiculing manner as he pulled down his collar to reveal a hideous wound on his neck. The expression on his face suddenly became cold. \u201cHow did this injury come about? I will never forget it in my life.\u201dThe moment this was heard, ZX\u2019s gazes toward Chen Yushen didn\u2019t seem quite right. Obviously, they were teammates and knew about the wound on LAN\u2019s neck. They just hadn\u2019t expected to encounter the culprit here. After all, it was a teammate\u2019s instinct to support LAN.In the silence, the captain of the ZX team spoke solemnly. \u201cDoes GH\u2019s management know that they have recruited a dangerous player into the club?\u201dDid the management know? Jian Ye didn\u2019t know but this was indeed the first time he was hearing that something happened with Chen Yushen previously. He instinctively looked back at Chen Yushen.Chen Yushen was currently in a state of unprecedented calm. This calm was like the darkness after the entire world had withered. He didn\u2019t give an explanation regarding this matter. He just slightly lowered his eyes. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSuch eyes had gone through too much and were therefore numb.Just as Chen Yushen was about to start walking, the ZX team stood in a row and blocked his way.LAN looked at Chen Yushen mockingly but he spoke to Jian Ye. \u201cThis friend, after you go back, you should tell everyone to be careful of Abyss. Who knows when he will be cruel to even his teammates?!\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s hands were tightly clenched into fists and he stared at LAN fiercely. His eyes were bloodshot due to his suppressed anger and his tone was vaguely unstable. \u201cGet out of the way!\u201dLAN relied on the members of the ZX team supporting him and gloomily smiled. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t? Do you think it will be okay after hiding for two years? What if I bring out this matter? Do you think that GH\u2019s management will still keep you?\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s chest faintly rose up and down and his clenched fists couldn\u2019t stop trembling. Still, he forcibly endured it and didn\u2019t shout at this disgusting face. He had almost ruined his career for this garbage. It wasn\u2019t worth ruining it again!Chen Yushen took a deep breath and finally controlled his emotions. He was looking up coldly when someone pulled him from behind. The great force made him take a few steps back. By the time he looked up again, Jian Ye had already taken a few steps forward and his chest struck LAN\u2019s chest hard.There was a huge gap in the size of the two people. Jian Ye almost caused LAN to fly back. Finally, he fell to the ground in an extremely embarrassed manner. This surprise action made LAN feel a bit flustered. Once he finally reacted, he became angry. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Do you and GH collectively want to touch the bottom line?\u201dJian Ye casually touched his head and showed a harmless smile. \u201cWhat bottom line? I don\u2019t know anything. I was just anxious to go back. Ah, sorry. You are too short and I wasn\u2019t looking when I was walking. I didn\u2019t hurt you, did I?\u201dLAN didn\u2019t expect that this person could talk such nonsense. Under this shameless action, his face was almost completely green. \u201cYou, you\u2026\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t want for the \u2018you\u2019 to finish. He acted like something suddenly came to his mind. \u201cBy the way, I have forgotten to introduce myself. I am Gun. You can call me Brother Gun. I am GH\u2019s support position. If you want a team battle then remember to find me.\u201d\u2019Then he casually scratched the scar on his face. \u201cNo matter what, I am a professional in a team battle.\u2019Was this indicating that he was ready to start a \u2018team battle\u2019 right now? Forget the people of the ZX Team. Even Chen Yushen was shocked by Jian Ye\u2019s attitude. Prior to this, he had been prepared to be questioned and excluded. He never expected that this teammate he had just met would actually stand in front of him without hesitation. Chen Yushen\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved and he opened his mouth, only to find that he couldn\u2019t say a word.Jian Ye\u2019s approach undoubtedly made the confrontation between the two sides even tenser. They were at a stalemate when they heard someone clap their hands. \u201cYo, this place is quite lively.\u201dThe familiar voice made Jian Ye look back and he was overjoyed when he saw the two people. \u201cCoach, captain!\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s eyelids lowered, hiding the mood in his eyes.Lin Yan wasn\u2019t polite. He casually placed the room cards into Jian Ye\u2019s hands and looked around with a smile. \u201cWhat are you going to do? Take me to play as well?\u201dThe moment this was said, the already subtle atmosphere became even stranger. The two people had been standing aside and had a rough idea of the situation.FreestarJing Yuanzhou was amazed by Lin Yan\u2019s talent to stir up the water with just two or three sentences. At this time, he stood beside Lin Yan with interest while waiting for the development.ZX\u2019s captain saw the two people who appeared and his face changed slightly. He looked at Lin Yan and then Jing Yuanzhou before gulping. \u201cWe just met on the way\u2026 we aren\u2019t playing anything.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s it.\u201d Lin Yan looked a bit disappointed. \u201cI thought your team was blocking our players in the corridor and ready to give some advice.\u201dIt was an understated sentence but it made ZX\u2019s captain sweat. \u201cHow can that be? It was simply a story between old team members.\u201d\u201cReminiscing about the old days?\u201d Lin Yan glanced over at Chen Yushen\u2019s expression and smiled. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know the situation just now, I almost thought your team was here to seek revenge?\u201d\u201cHow can there be any hatred? It was just a joke.\u201d ZX\u2019s captain couldn\u2019t help glancing at Jing Yuanzhou and he smiled. \u201cWe happened to meet each other today. Captain Jing, please take care of us during the next show.\u201dHe might not know much about the other people in GH but Titans\u2019 influence in the industry was real. He had to show some respect.Jing Yuanzhou raised his eyelashes when he heard these words and gave a non-committal hum.Lin Yan glanced at the time and spoke lightly. \u201cSince there is nothing wrong, we will leave first.\u201dChen Yushen didn\u2019t say anything. He just took slow breaths and followed Lin Yan.LAN had been helped up from the ground by his teammates. Seeing that they were really going to leave, he blurted out, \u201cWait a minute!\u201dChen Yushen had no deep feelings for such entanglement and numbly looked back.He felt the gaze of other people on him and LAN couldn\u2019t help gulping. He spoke to Lin Yan. \u201cYou are GH\u2019s coach, right? Does your club know\u2026\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Lin Yan didn\u2019t wait for this person to finish and simply interrupted. \u201cOur club has a very deep understanding about all of our players.\u201dLAN was blocked off and his pupils shrank with disbelief. Then his eyes became wide. \u201cYou know yet you still\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is our freedom to choose the players.\u201d Lin Yan stared at LAN with a smile that wasn\u2019t a smile. Then his eyes curved kindly. \u201cMoreover, it is because I clearly know that I dug Abyss into the team. As for what I know in detail, do I need to report it to you one by one here?\u201dLAN had wanted to say something but he felt something cold shoot down his neck at this gaze and all his words became choked up.Lin Yan lowered his eyes and looked at this person with indifferent contempt. \u201cTherefore, I advise the players of your club not to do anything to discredit GH. If I hear any bad news from the outside world and my life becomes unhappy, you probably won\u2019t feel any better. The identity of a professional player isn\u2019t easy to come by. You should cherish it while you have it.\u201dLAN\u2019s body shook slightly and he instinctively avoided such an explicit gaze. The next second, Lin Yan turned to look at ZX\u2019s captain.At this point, Lin Yan had put away his usual casual smile and something seemed to occur to him. \u201cBy the way, the show hasn\u2019t started recording yet. For the sake of our two teams, how about holding a friendly match in the evening?\u201dZX\u2019s captain, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShould he agree? His sense of reason told him that he should decisively refuse but he couldn\u2019t help looking at Jing Yuanzhou. You know, teams like them in the sub-league had almost no chance to compete with the top players. This opportunity was rare.Finally, ZX\u2019s captain fell for the temptation of Titans and nodded seriously. \u201cOkay, set a time.\u201dOn the way back to the lounge, Jing Yuanzhou recalled what just happened and wondered, \u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019ve unknowingly been used again?\u201dLin Yan disagreed. \u201cI just used it once. Why are you so stingy?\u201dJing Yuanzhou told him, \u201cI\u2019ll forget it this time. The next time I\u2019m used, you will be charged.\u201dLin Yan laughed. \u201cOkay. Do you feel wronged? Once I go back, I\u2019ll write you an IOU for the service fee so that you won\u2019t say I\u2019m exploiting you again.\u201dFreestarJing Yuanzhou thought about it. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201dJian Ye was still thinking about what happened just now and he became even angrier. \u201cI say, how come you\u2019re so good this time? According to me, they shouldn\u2019t be let go so easily.\u201d\u201cWhy? Do you really want to start an actual fight?\u201d Lin Yan glanced at him and repeated the tone. \u201cI am a professional at a team battle. Oh, so awesome. I\u2019m afraid there is no evidence to accuse our team players of breaking the rules, right?\u201dJian Ye gave a low cough. \u201cIn Jianghu, isn\u2019t \u2018righteousness\u2019 important?\u201dLin Yan replied without any emotions. \u201cIf you have so much time to read those wuxia fantasy novels, why don\u2019t I arrange more hours of last hitting the soldiers for you every day?\u201dJian Ye was particularly flexible. \u201c\u2026Coach, I was wrong!\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t really want to train this person so he just laughed. Then he glanced sideways at the boy next to him. Since earlier, Chen Yushen hadn\u2019t spoken any words. He had walked silently all the way up to the present. Although he tried his best to restrain it, his body was trembling slightly.He thought he might explode again at any time when facing LAN yet he was much calmer than expected. It was only with Lin Yan\u2019s appearance that his heart completely shattered from the soft blow.He knew who the friendly match with the ZX Team was for better than anyone else. This was the first time he really felt warmth during the two years he was shut up.Lin Yan saw Chen Yushen\u2019s appearance and gave a low and helpless sigh. He took off his jacket and covered the boy\u2019s body with it. In addition, he didn\u2019t forget to rub the boy\u2019s hair. \u201cOkay, don\u2019t feel wronged. Isn\u2019t this friendly match for you? Tonight, there will be revenge for your grievances, do you know?\u201dAs he spoke, he felt Chen Yushen\u2019s shaking become more severe.Lin Yan really wasn\u2019t good at coaxing people and he had a headache. He could only listen to the choked up teenager take two deep breaths before stubbornly squeezing out a few words. \u201cI don\u2019t feel wronged.\u201dLin Yan said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re not wronged. You\u2019re just moved.\u201dChen Yushen didn\u2019t refute this time and was silent. It was just that they arrived at the door of the lounge by this time. Lin Yan didn\u2019t say anything and pushed open the door.The members had slept in the car for a while so they hadn\u2019t collapsed in the lounge. They were lying on the sofa while waiting for their room keys to be delivered. Gu Luo saw the four people walking in together and was slightly surprised. \u201cHow did you come back together?\u201dBi Yaohua saw Chen Yushen, whose head was covered by the coat. He thought about it and asked modestly, \u201cWhat is this cosplay? Masked man?\u201dJian Ye couldn\u2019t help laughing when he heard this. Chen Yushen buried his head lower.Lin Yan assigned the room cards to each person while downplaying what just happened.Gu Luo asked, \u201cSo tonight\u2019s training session is a friendly match with ZX?\u201dJian Ye complained, \u201cThem? What fucking friendship?\u201dLin Yan raised his eyebrow. \u201cIf everyone feels too tired then we don\u2019t have to play. I\u2019ll go and talk to ZX.\u201d\u201cFight. Why not?\u201d Bi Yaohua glanced at the still silent Chen Yushen and hit the table hard. \u201cDoes ZX think that GH is nothing? How can we stand still while this child is being bullied!\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s originally complex mood was long gone after this series of \u2018stimulation.\u2019 At this time, he couldn\u2019t help pulling Lin Yan\u2019s coat off his head, revealing faint red eyes that stared at Bi Yaohua blankly. The eyes seemed to be full of the warning: I, was, not, bullied.However, Bi Yaohua\u2019s focus had always been crooked. He saw this \u2018wronged\u2019 expression and felt even more distressed. \u201cYou are even crying like this?\u201dChen Yushen, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan was already laughing to the side. He clapped his hands lightly and concluded, \u201cThen the game is set. There are computers in the hotel rooms so you just need to turn on the computer in time. We just ended closed training so you should take this opportunity to practice against ZX. In any case, it is like this. It might be a \u2018friendly\u2019 game but I believe that everyone should know the slogan for tonight?\u201dTheir faces were bewildered. \u201cWhat slogan?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s lips curved up. \u201cCompetition first, friendship is dead.\u201dLin Yan smiled and snapped his fingers. \u201cPrecisely!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In particular, there was a flower such as Jing Yuanzhou in the team. This was simply a great event in life. After soliciting the opinions of the players, the friendly match against the ZX team was set at 8 o\u2019clock that night. It was the BO3 mode, which meant two wins out of three games.They rested in their rooms for an afternoon before going to the dining room for dinner. By the time they returned to their rooms, there was still some time before the match. Everyone gathered in the WeChat group for a pre-match tactical meeting.In view of the time issue, during the group training a while ago, the team mainly practiced three sets of plans. However, considering that ZX was too weak of a team, Lin Yan thought it wasn\u2019t worth exposing their tactics early. He slowly started typing.[Lin Breeder]: Everyone is spirited so I will start straight away. I won\u2019t say much. We will use Plan X tonight.[Gun \u2013 Jian Ye]: ??? No, Coach. Did we ever have a Plan X?[Lin Breeder]: Can\u2019t you understand? X plan is the cross plan. In other words, there is no plan.[Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo]: \u2026\u2026[BB \u2013 Bi Yaohua]: A pure, loose play? I like it! If we don\u2019t beat them all three ways tonight then no one should think about sleeping![Gun \u2013 Jian Ye]: Brother Trash Talk, do you need to be so cruel to yourself?[Lin Breeder]: What are you doing? Today, you aren\u2019t allowed to push all the way through. Whoever pushes through their lane, don\u2019t even think about sleeping tonight![Gun \u2013 Jian Ye]: ??? What method is this?[Lin Breeder]: There is only one training event for the match tonight. In other words, only heads are accepted. Don\u2019t push to the towers.[Lin Breeder]: By the way, remember to feed Abyss. I require him to have at least 20 heads in each game.[BB \u2013 Bi Yaohua]: Wow, such mindless force feeding the duck? I like it![Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo]: This\u2026 who is the duck?[Abyss \u2013 Chen Yushen]: \u2026\u2026[BB \u2013 Bi Yaohua]: A, don\u2019t worry. Brother is here. You will be fattened![Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo]: I will do it too.[Gun \u2013 Jian Ye]: And me![Titans \u2013 Jing Yuanzhou]: +1[Abyss \u2013 Chen Yushen]: \u2026\u2026\u2026Even the captain followed suit?The program group had arranged three rooms for each team. The shooter and support, Bi Yaohua and Jian Ye lived in one room. Gu Luo and Chen Yushen lived in another room and Jing Yuanzhou naturally lived together with Lin Yan, the coach.At this time, Jing Yuanzhou was sitting on the sofa by the window. He saw Lin Yan lying on the bed, typing skillfully and couldn\u2019t help giving this person a funny look. \u201cAre you planning to completely collapse ZX\u2019s mentality?\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t even raise his head when he heard the words. He just admitted it very calmly. \u201cOtherwise, why else play a friendly match with them? GH isn\u2019t doing charity.\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought about it and asked, \u201cThen should I also give my heads to Abyss?\u201dLin Yan replied negatively. \u201cNo, those words are for the children. You can fight as you please. How can I make Titans give heads to other people? It is wronging God Jing!\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cNot really, I\u2019m not wronged.\u201dLin Yan finally looked up.Jing Yuanzhou met this gaze and the smile on his face widened. \u201cI will help the team complete tonight\u2019s KPIs. If they fail to meet the indicators, it won\u2019t matter as much because they won\u2019t be in the same room as you. However, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to suffer until I can\u2019t sleep.\u201dLin Yan was stunned for a moment. \u201cWhy do I feel like the one who will suffer isn\u2019t necessarily you?\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised an eyebrow. \u201cHuh?\u201dLin Yan wanted to say something but then he inadvertently glanced at the time on the phone. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later. It\u2019s about to start. Prepare to go online.\u201dAt 7:30, everyone in GH logged onto their accounts using the computers in the hotel room. They were here to record a variety show so everyone didn\u2019t bring their own gaming equipment. They should get familiar with the keyboard and mouse here a bit earlier.Bi Yaohua tested the keyboard while pulling at his headset. \u201cHey, can you hear me? Tell me, why am I so excited playing a weak team like ZX? Do you think it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been away from the professional area for so long that I\u2019m a bit excited to see food?\u201dJian Ye adjusted the sensitivity of the mouse. \u201cI don\u2019t blame you. I have been devoted to Buddha for so long since becoming a support. This is the first time I want to kill in the game. How about Brother Gun will show you a violent support today? Should I use the Tree Spirit I just practiced?\u201dGu Luo thought of the previous crazy experience of losing points and his eyelids twitched fiercely. He hurriedly said, \u201c\u2026Brother, don\u2019t!\u201dJian Ye felt a bit of regret. \u201cIn fact, my Tree Spirit is actually quite good?\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s chicken soup was delivered as scheduled. \u201cIn fact, the character you play doesn\u2019t matter. The most important thing is having a heart for output. As long as you have output in your heart then it will be everywhere. This friendly match is simply an entertainment one. If you are really bored then you can find time to chat to the other side!\u201dJian Ye was speechless. \u201cWhy should I talk with the people from ZX?\u201dBi Yaohua sighed. \u201cOf course, there is no chatting under normal circumstances. However, isn\u2019t there a teammate from the underworld in their team? Let\u2019s interview him a bit and ask him how to achieve the perfect communication between yin and yang. He is too anti-social!\u201dJian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe shouldn\u2019t have asked!Chen Yushen had been listening to the team\u2019s voice chat and he couldn\u2019t hold back. The corners of his cold mouth rose up slightly.Jing Yuanzhou suddenly opened his mouth. \u201cAre you ready? It\u2019s almost starting.\u201dThe moment he spoke, they could see a string of IDs with the ZX prefix entering the custom room one after another.Lin Yan was busy pulling people into the room just now. At this time, he was sure that everyone had come in and reminded them in the voice channel, \u201cI will take a video of tonight\u2019s match. If I find that Abyss hasn\u2019t been fattened enough, hehe\u2026\u201dThe \u2018hehe\u2019 made everyone\u2019s hairs stand up.Bi Yaohua\u2019s face became solemn and he spoke very seriously. \u201cAbyss, remember to come to my lane more often. You don\u2019t need to treat me as a person when you see people\u2019s heads.\u201dThe others echoed him. \u201cAgree! Don\u2019t treat us like people!\u201dChen Yushen, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAt this time, ZX\u2019s captain inquired in the public chat window. [Can we start?][GH.Titans: Start.]The first game officially started and both sides entered the BP segment. Lin Yan reported a hero and the players followed suit. In the blink of an eye, GH successfully banned six off-bench heroes who were almost never used. This approach made it clear that ZX could choose the heroes they wanted. The taunting was extreme even before the game started.As for the lineup selection on this side, Lin Yan didn\u2019t intervene since he already talked about using the \u2018X\u2019 plan. Players could play whatever they wanted. The choice was up to them. Once it was Chen Yushen\u2019s turn, he hesitated for a moment. Finally, his eyes fixed on the Wilderness Swordsman and he pressed the lock button.This was a jungler hero who was quite unpopular in the current game version. However, even if it had been in the dust for a long time, it wasn\u2019t completely annihilated along with the bleak memories. It was just unknown if the blade in the scabbard was still sharp.Gu Luo was a bit surprised. \u201cAbyss, do you actually use the Wilderness Swordsman? I haven\u2019t seen you use it before.\u201dChen Yushen was silent for a moment before replying. \u201cYes.\u201dGH\u2019s previous closed training was mainly aimed at the three sets of tactics but the core improvement point was actually everyone\u2019s degree of team understanding. A time like this was the best test of their tacit understanding.FreestarZX was already irritated by the BP session. Now they saw GH\u2019s messy lineup and almost couldn\u2019t breathe. There had to be a limit to looking down on people. This was too bullying!LAN gritted his teeth with anger as he stared at Chen Yushen\u2019s Wilderness Swordsman on the screen, his face cold. After entering the game, he couldn\u2019t help typing on the public channel: [Abyss, it has been a long time since I\u2019ve seen your Wilderness Swordsman. Daring to take it out in this version? Do you want to come to the wild area to practice?]Chen Yushen stared at the eye-catching words on the public channel and was prepared to respond when someone stepped in first.[GH.BB: Is our Abyss your father? Are you playing with tadpoles to find your mother before the game starts?]Chen Yushen was taken aback. Then he heard Bi Yaohua laugh in the voice channel. \u201cAbyss, why should you go out? Leave it to your brother. I\u2019m also laughing. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone dare to taunt my teammates in front of me. I really want to let him continue to jump. Shall I force him into Jianghu?\u201dThere was a sense of mission in his voice.Chen Yushen, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was a moment of silence and he didn\u2019t say anything. He quickly bought the jungler equipment and dived into the jungle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He never expected that Bi Yaohua would suddenly interfere and it took him a long time to react.[ZX.LAN: What does the matter between Abyss and me have to do with you?][GH.BB: Oh, filial piety, your filial piety. I didn\u2019t name who I was speaking to. You are so eager to come out and recognize your father?]This type of public provocation was forbidden in both the professional and secondary leagues. However, this was a private discussion and it was the industry\u2019s default rule that the content of training matches wasn\u2019t allowed to be leaked to the outside. It was precisely because of this that LAN wasn\u2019t worried about his plan to stimulate Chen Yushen at the start of the game. He just hadn\u2019t expected to be directly bombed by Bi Yaohua in a few words.LAN\u2019s temper rose and he originally wanted to continue the fight. Then ZX\u2019s captain sternly stopped him. \u201cDon\u2019t you know who BB is? Why are you trying to compete against him in trash talk? Are you looking for abuse?\u201dLAN\u2019s mouth twitched. Finally, he could only swallow down his anger. His line of soldiers arrived. He last hit the soldiers while staring at the figure of the archer in front of him. He endured and endured it. Finally, he felt he couldn\u2019t swallow down this anger. He was about to tell their jungle to help him when a kill prompt popped up on the interface.[GH.Abyss killed ZX.Pu.][First Blood]The jungler Pu gave away a blood and ZX\u2019s captain reminded him. \u201cThe support should go with the jungler. Be careful in the wild area.\u201dPu was miserable and could only give an aggrieved hum of agreement. Thanks to the protection of the support, the development process of the jungler in the wild was much smoother. Just as ZX was ready to stabilize the situation and start looking for opportunities, a fight broke out in the bottom lane.Chen Yushen, who had disappeared for a long time, suddenly appeared in the bottom lane. He had the assistance of Jian Ye and completed a wave of strong kills by cooperating with Bi Yaohua. Three people could be seen forcibly trampling on LAN\u2019s body under ZX\u2019s defense tower. Then they threw the body into the wild and walked away.In this process, all the chat channels were filled up thoroughly by Bi Yaohua.[GH.BB: Did you say how much your father loves you? He knew that you couldn\u2019t find him so he came to find you by himself.][GH.BB: Sometimes I envy you. I will never experience the feeling of being forcibly killed under the tower.][GH.BB: Listen to Brother\u2019s advice. A shooter really can\u2019t wave in front of me. You see, you just waved and something happened.][GH.BB: I brought a novice kid to play the game a few days ago. Your method of death is exactly the same as him.][GH.BB: Come, pay attention to Brother Trash Talk\u2019s graceful and elegant positioning. It will be free teaching.][GH.BB: Although I know that you like to recognize your father, I won\u2019t charge you for tuition this time. After all, I don\u2019t want a son like you.][GH.BB: Aiya! Why do I like a team who knows how to lose and takes the initiative to ask for trouble? Chatting on the public screen is so pleasant!]The members of the ZX team didn\u2019t know how happy Bi Yaohua was at the moment. They only knew that they were collectively going crazy. The captain of ZX was silent for a moment before saying in the team voice channel, \u201cRelax, don\u2019t let your mentality be affected.\u201dThe ZX people, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was one thing to say it but it was very hard to put into action. There were several successive kills and GH\u2019s rhythm had completely risen.The first few heads were all harvested by Chen Yushen. Therefore, his Wilderness Swordsman was like a super boss walking in the canyon. It was barren everywhere he walked. In comparison, Jing Yuanzhou should\u2019ve been the core of GH yet he was calmly last-hitting his soldiers on the road with ZX\u2019s captain.Despite the turmoil below, he stood still and showed no tendencies to push to the defensive tower at all.ZX\u2019s captain had been holding his breath and paying attention to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s every move. He didn\u2019t know why but the more peacefully he pushed the lane, the worse his bad feeling became.By the 15th minute of the match, Chen Yushen\u2019s Wilderness Swordsman had smoothly developed in sharp contrast to the ZX team\u2019s shooter, LAN. During the entire game, LAN almost always died the moment he revived.He died in the bottom lane, died while trying to go to the wild area to steal, was double killed if the support was with him, was ganked in the middle road by the opposing jungler and support\u2026As time passed and it reached the 30th minute, LAN had successfully given away 15 heads. His statistics were 0-15-0. It was difficult to encounter this type of \u2018weak becomes a dog\u2019 shooter data even in a normal matching game.After being targeted for the entire game, LAN\u2019s eyes were slightly blank as he stared at the screen. Wasn\u2019t the opposite GH a team who hadn\u2019t even participated in the secondary league? Why did the game become like this?The next time he was resurrected at the spring, he hesitated for a moment. He wondered if he should walk out of the base. At this time, the other members of ZX had made new discoveries.The head gap was widening endlessly. Under such an economic gap, there was only one soldier that was successfully pushed down by the small soldiers. Otherwise, the upper, middle and lower towers on their red side were still intact.At this point in the game, even the dull ZX could see it. GH didn\u2019t mean to push through the towers at all. They just wanted to kill!ZX\u2019s captain looked at Jing Yuanzhou, whose online data had been steadily kept at 0 kills. He recalled the previous few times when Jing Yuanzhou had smoothly given the heads to Chen Yushen and the last trace of fighting intent in his eyes completely dimmed.He didn\u2019t want to admit it but was GH already strong enough to completely defeat them even without Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s participation? It was too scary.In the 45th minute of the game, everyone in GH finally followed their soldiers and formally set foot on ZX\u2019s high ground. Even so, they weren\u2019t in a hurry to push to the crystal. They destroyed the two front base towers and let out a wave of soldiers.Then they stood in a row in front of the spring. As the team representative, Bi Yaohua still spoke energetically.[GH.BB: ZX team, I declare that you have been surrounded!][GH.BB: Still, don\u2019t worry. We are reasonable people. We aren\u2019t aiming at everyone here. We are only targeting LAN!][GH.BB: As long as the others don\u2019t do anything, we will never touch you!][GH.BB: Simply put, we just want to help Abyss teach his unfilial son a lesson~]FreestarSo far, LAN had died a total of 20 times. The reason he hadn\u2019t died so fiercely like the beginning was thanks to the delay in time and him prolonging the resurrection time. This allowed him to lie on the ground and spent a period of time quietly and safely.At this time, LAN\u2019s hands on the keyboard were slightly shaking. His eyes fell on the people in front of him and only one sentence appeared in his head. \u2018How can this be\u2026\u2019However, there was no time to continue thinking. A chain was suddenly thrown over. It passed by everyone in ZX and tied up the shooter hero operated by LAN. The next second, there was a strong tug and he was pulled out of the spring.The Wilderness Swordsman raised his sword and lowered it. Another head was harvested. Under all eyes, the corpse was abused at the spring.The captain of ZX looked at the GH people waiting for LAN\u2019s resurrection and sighed. Finally, he opened the system interface. On the interface of the ZX team, a voting box for surrender appeared.LAN saw it and his trembling fingers pressed the mouse without any hesitation. He chose to confirm it. The rest of the ZX team looked at the two red votes in front of them for a moment. Then they also silently chose to surrender.As the base\u2019s crystal self-exploded, they could see Bi Yaohua\u2019s regretful last sentence in the chat window. [Oh, why are you in such a hurry to surrender? Let\u2019s play more!]However, there was no doubt that he didn\u2019t need to wait for the other party\u2019s response. Everyone retired the moment the game ended. On the settlement interface, the number of deaths for the shooter hero operated by LAN was shocking. It was in sharp contrast to the MVP, Chen Yushen.A super ghost and a super god.On the one hand, everyone in GH was relieved that they had completed the indicator requested by Lin Yan. On the other hand, they couldn\u2019t wait to see the expressions of the ZX team. Yet before Bi Yaohua could say anything, the players on the opposite side had left the room one by one. They all withdrew in the blink of an eye.Lin Yan read the message sent by the other side, moved the headset around his neck to his mouth and smiled. \u201cSomeone on the ZX team has a stomachache. I\u2019m afraid they can\u2019t play a second game\u2026\u201dBi Yaohua laughed. \u201cCoach, can you help us inquire. Is the one with a stomachache called LAN?\u201dThe others laughed when they heard it.ZX\u2019s people were gone so they also quit the game.After all, the side effects of the closed training were still there. The fight just now was really fierce and their sleepiness became too much. Now they had just finished abusing the weak, so they felt refreshed and could sleep well.ZX was completely destroyed by them. This result was very satisfying. Hey, didn\u2019t they make a lot of noise before? Let\u2019s see if they stand up after meeting again during the recording of the show!Jing Yuanzhou also turned off the computer. He saw Lin Yan going to WeChat to express \u2018condolences\u2019 to someone and couldn\u2019t help smiling. He waited until the chat was over before asking slowly, \u201cDo you feel cool now?\u2019Lin Yan had just talked to the captain of ZX until the captain shut up. Then he put his phone back in his pocket. \u201cIt\u2019s cool but it isn\u2019t enough. It was obviously a good BO3 but they ran away after playing a game. How can it be good?\u201dJing Yuanzhou followed along with his words and wondered, \u201cSo?\u201dLin Yan showed a wild smile. \u201cAren\u2019t we going to record the program? Of course, we will continue tomorrow!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This had never been interrupted even during the closed training process. This showed his self-discipline and today was no exception.Lin Yan woke up in a dazed manner. He glanced at the bed next to him and wasn\u2019t surprised to see only a stack of neatly folded quilts. The man was long gone.Today was the first day of recording the Burning Hot Assembly. The recording time was scheduled at one in the afternoon. However, so many people needed to do their styling that they needed to report in advance at 11 o\u2019clock.Lin Yan glanced at his phone and determined that the time was still early. He rubbed his fluffy hair and went into the bathroom with sleepy eyes. He came out after washing up and was thinking about going downstairs to eat breakfast. Then he glanced around inadvertently and found a note on his bedside table. The confused Lin Yan walked over and picked it up to take a look.It was obviously from Jing Yuanzhou. He had probably been afraid that sending a message would wake up Lin Yan so he chose this method. [You don\u2019t need to go to the dining room for breakfast. I\u2019ll bring it back on the way. If someone knocks on the door, remember to open it. It is the room service I called.]There was obviously no problem with the contents of the note but Lin Yan repeatedly read it. He always felt that something was wrong. However, before he could think about it, there was a knock on the door.Jing Yuanzhou had left a note so Lin Yan\u2019s first reaction was that the employee had arrived. He opened the door and was slightly surprised to see Chen Yushen standing in the doorway. \u201cWhy are you awake so early today?\u201dAccording to his knowledge of e-sports players, he knew that these people would definitely stay in bed every possible second and not waste this precious time. The current time of 8:30 didn\u2019t match their normal biological clock.However, judging from the faint dark circles under Chen Yushen\u2019s eyes, he obviously hadn\u2019t slept well last night. Lin Yan saw the young man standing at the door without moving. He instantly understood why this person had come and turned to the side. \u201cTitans isn\u2019t here now. You can come in first.\u201dChen Yushen walked to the sofa and sat down. Lin Yan poured tea for himself and also for Chen Yushen. Chen Yushen held the tea cup. He rubbed the cup with his fingers and his eyes stared at the table as he remained silent for a long time.Lin Yan wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He leaned against the sofa and drank the tea. It was unknown how much time passed before Chen Yushen raised his head and looked over. He spoke in a slightly hoarse voice. \u201cCoach, I want to talk to you about\u2026 two years ago.\u201dIt was undoubtedly very difficult to make such a decision. It was just that Chen Yushen had been thinking about it all night after yesterday. The past that he thought would be rotting in his memory forever had gradually loosened thanks to all the killing on the field.Lin Yan had already guessed Chen Yushen\u2019s intentions and his mouth slightly curved up when he heard the words. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to say it. I know.\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s back shook slightly and he looked up in an astonished manner. \u201cYou know\u2026 all of it?\u201dLin Yan tilted his head and smiled slightly. \u201cI meant all the words I told LAN yesterday. It wasn\u2019t just to scare him casually.\u201dChen Yushen opened his mouth but found he couldn\u2019t make a sound for a while. This was like plucking up the courage only to become completely empty the next moment. His entire body slightly lost strength and he slumped on the sofa.Lin Yan gave a low sigh. \u201cRelax. Drink some hot water first.\u201dIn fact, the story about Abyss wasn\u2019t mentioned too much in the original book. He just knew a basic outline of the whole incident. To understand more details, Chen Yushen naturally needed to say it himself.However, this incident had left too deep a mark on the young man\u2019s mind. He knew how difficult it was to speak after experiencing many things and couldn\u2019t bear to let such an enduring young man expose the previous scars in front of him. Some things were the past. For the living, it was necessary to continue looking forward.Lin Yan\u2019s gaze stayed on Chen Yushen\u2019s somewhat absent-minded face. He silently cursed those things who weren\u2019t human.FreestarMost people in the circle had heard of the two major events that happened in the youth training camp two years ago. One was a player jumping off a building and the other was the incidence of violence.However, only a handful knew the specific connection between the two incidents. This was why Lin Yan\u2019s knowledge made Chen Yushen very surprised.Chen Yushen took a few sips of hot water and felt his tight nerves relax slightly. Then he slowly let out a few breaths. He never thought that he had done anything wrong and he had no regrets. However, in a way, he did do these things.That year, Chen Yushen had just joined the youth training camp. He was already a well-known passerby king and a genius jungler. Therefore, his starting point was very high when he entered the camp.It was just that due to his natural stinky expression, it always gave people a misconception and he was inevitably excluded due to jealousy. The only friend in the camp at the time was Ah Mu, who was in the same dormitory as him. This person was also a top mid-laner in the camp. He was a gentle boy who loved to smile.Originally, like the other training players, they only needed to complete all the tasks in the training camp and then they could wait for invitations from various clubs to shine on the field. However, Ah Mu accidentally provoked a new group.Ah Mu\u2019s personality was a bit soft. Put badly, he was a bit cowardly. At first, it was just a bit of trouble and he could endure it. He just didn\u2019t expect that these people would become more and more excessive. They gradually rose from verbal bullying to physical violence.At that time, Chen Yushen was receiving in-depth training from the coaches. He happened to be in a team with a few people from that small group and he was exhausted. Every time, he would fall asleep the moment he got back to the dormitory. He often failed to talk to Ah Mu for several days so he didn\u2019t notice the strangeness in his friend.By the time he discovered that something was wrong, it was too late. Ah Mu left without warning. The promising young man fell like a meteor, completely dimming the light.During the time when the entire youth training camp was in chaos because of a player jumping from a building, Chen Yushen was the one holding his friend\u2019s diary and weeping. In addition to anger, there was probably more self-blame. If he had found out earlier then everything would probably be completely different.The thing that made Chen Yushen feel deeply unacceptable was the attitude of the abusers.Once he found those people, they only showed a brief astonishment before laughing. \u201cThat soft bun Ah Mu? What is the use of you asking us about this? Who would\u2019ve thought that he had such a poor psychological quality? We just said a few casual things and he couldn\u2019t stand it. I have to say, with his endurance, he wouldn\u2019t be able to play professionally even if he graduated from the training camp. Whoever signed him would\u2019ve been unlucky!\u201dThe ridiculing words were like a sharp knife in Chen Yushen\u2019s heart. At that time, Chen Yushen\u2019s fist struck out heavily. These people obviously hadn\u2019t expected Chen Yushen to start fighting. They were surprised for a moment before surrounding him.The specific situation couldn\u2019t be remembered. Chen Yushen only remembered that his mouth was full of blood at the time.The guy who took the lead was standing behind the crowd. He didn\u2019t say a word from beginning to end. He tried to rush over several times but was stopped again and again.LAN was one of those people at the time. He seemed to be very active for the sake of his image. Under the stimulus of repeated words, Chen Yushen inadvertently grabbed a knife from the side table and waved it at everyone.Blood splashed out strongly and shocked all the teenagers present. Their faces became pale. It wasn\u2019t until this time that these people finally felt scared.The rest of the matter was just as the outside world knew. LAN was rushed to the hospital and Chen Yushen was watched over by the people who rushed over after hearing about it. This matter had ended and it should\u2019ve been serious enough to be a criminal case. It was unknown why but the people in the small group expressed their opinion not to pursue the investigation.Afterwards, the entire violence incident ended with Chen Yushen forced to withdraw from the youth training camp.Now two years later, the people involved were basically eliminated due to the cruelty of e-sports. LAN was fortunate enough to be selected by a secondary league team while the others had retired from the circle or played in the Internet cafe games. Only the guy who led the group could become a professional player and have a place in a professional club.The bullied person was helplessly annihilated in the dust while the instigator stood on the glorious arena. It was probably because of this that Chen Yushen felt it was deeply ironic.No one in the room spoke for a while.Chen Yushen was surprised that Lin Yan knew the truth but he didn\u2019t ask much. His chest was moving up and down and the fingers holding the cup became tighter. \u201cNo matter what, it must be admitted that I did break the most important rule at the time\u2026 that day, the one who acted first was me.\u201dThis attitude was like a bad student who was uneasy facing the teaching director. Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help laughing slightly. He reached out a hand and gently touched Chen Yushen\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just don\u2019t do it in the future.\u201dChen Yushen hung his head and pressed his lips together tightly. He tried to control his emotions. \u201cEn\u2026\u201dLin Yan smiled. \u201cI believe in my own eyes. You are a good boy.\u201dHe thought about it and probably felt that what he said wasn\u2019t convincing enough. He added, \u201cYou might always have a stinky face, you aren\u2019t good at controlling your emotions, you used to fight and broke the rules but in my eyes, you are really a good boy.\u201dChen Yushen, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was no need to emphasize it.At this point in the conversation, the previously depressing atmosphere had disappeared. Before he knew it, the hot water in Chen Yushen\u2019s hand had been completely finished. Lin Yan asked in the manner of a host, \u201cShall I pour you another glass?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Chen Yushen shook his head deeply and looked up. He seemed to want to say something but hesitated.\u201cWhy? Is there something else?\u201dChen Yushen was silent for a moment before whispering, \u201cCoach, you are really gentle.\u201dLin Yan was caught off guard by being issued a \u2018gentle\u2019 card and was stunned. \u201cHuh?\u201dChen Yushen was probably embarrassed. His face was blanker than ever but his ears were suspiciously red.\u201cNo one has spoken to me like this for a long time.\u201d At this point, he lowered his head to avoid Lin Yan\u2019s gaze, his voice becoming softer. \u201cThis type of gentleness, it feels\u2026 like a mother.\u201dLin Yan\u2019s smile slightly froze, \u201c???\u201dIf he said like a father then Lin Yan would probably be a bit happier?Chen Yushen had untied his heart knot and he obviously had a much more relaxed expression when he left. \u201cThank you, Coach. I will be leaving first.\u201dLin Yan found his voice. \u201cGo back and get rid of the dark circles. Be careful not to stay up too late when recording.\u201dChen Yushen couldn\u2019t help touching his eyes. \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dAfter sending him away, it wasn\u2019t long before the employee knocked on the door. Lin Yan\u2019s mind was full of Chen Yushen\u2019s last magical metaphor. He left room for the person to clean while he stood at the window, smoking a cigarette in a complicated mood. Thinking back to the situation after the club had been established, was it possible that he had been too kind to these children?\u201cSir, excuse me.\u201d The employee\u2019s voice drew Lin Yan back from his thoughts. At this time, the cleaning was basically completed. She held a piece of paper from the table in her hand as she asked, \u201cExcuse me, do you need me to throw this away for you?\u201d\u201cThrow\u2026\u201d Lin Yan wanted to answer when his gaze swept over the note. Something flashed in his mind and he swallowed back the rest of words. \u201cGive it to me to take a look.\u201dHe walked over and after taking it, his gaze stayed on two words of the note for a long time. The hotel employee left the room and he silently took out his phone to find a photo in the gallery.The words in the image were incredibly clear: [Service fee.]Then he compared it to the note: [Room service]No wonder he felt a strange sense of familiarity just now. After comparing the two identical handwritings, Lin Yan fell into a long silence. Then strength was inserted into his hands as he blankly put out the cigarette that was about to burn out.The author has something to say:Calm down, the cigarette is innocent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then he paused for a moment before taking two sips from the water glass next to him. He started to think about what happened previously. The handwriting of the word \u2018service\u2019 was too consistent. It was almost certain that it was written by the same person.So he wasn\u2019t dreaming at the time. The man he grabbed at the entrance of the bar after becoming drunk was really Jing Yuanzhou? That night, they went to the hotel and opened a room together.Although his handling of Titans in his dream had yet to be verified, it was absolutely impossible for nothing to have happened based on the service fee of one jiao. The most important thing was that after adding him as a friend the next day, he actually regarded Jing Yuanzhou as a virtual boyfriend and complained severely about the previous incident.Thinking up to here, Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help lowering his head and burying his face in his hands. \u201cFuck?\u201dWhat did he say at the time? He had a friend! However, Jing Yuanzhou actually saw through it and didn\u2019t say anything. Looking back now, he could almost imagine the man smiling at his phone. Then afterwards, he asked about the one jiao scumbag again. It seemed to be full of provocation.Lin Yan was in a really bad mood at this time. He probably felt that he had really fed the dog.Jing Yuanzhou came back with breakfast. He found that the door of the room was open. He pushed it open wider to enter and found Lin Yan sitting on the sofa with an unclear expression. A bit of consternation flashed in his eyes. He changed to slippers and walked in. He placed the breakfast on the table in front of him and made a guess. \u201cDid you argue with the housekeeper?\u201dLin Yan watched him silently. Then he opened the bag, took a bun and took a bite. After that, he blankly unlocked the phone on the table.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze followed these movements and he instantly saw the familiar writing on the lit up phone screen. He looked at the paper next to it and suddenly understood. He was slightly taken aback by the fall of his identity.Lin Yan ate the bun and his tongue gently licked the corners of his lips, his tone light. \u201cI remember that Captain Jing was quite concerned about my progress in finding the one jiao scumbag?\u201dThen before Jing Yuanzhou could reply, he raised his eyes and gave a smile that wasn\u2019t a smile. \u201cI think that I have now found him.\u201dThere was a long silence. The breeze blowing in from the window made the curtains shake slightly. Jing Yuanzhou cleared his throat under this scrutinizing gaze. \u201cYes, that\u2019s great.\u201dHe opened a bottle of milk, took a sip and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about how I should tell you. This is better.\u201dHe quickly admitted it with a few words. If Lin Yan didn\u2019t understand this man too much, he would\u2019ve heard the relief in the tone and really believed such nonsense. Lin Yan supported his chin with his hand and watched Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cThen can you finally talk about what happened that night?\u201dJing Yuanzhou met his gaze and thought for a moment. \u201cIn fact, it is actually difficult to speak about this matter.\u201dLin Yan\u2019s movements paused slightly and he inexplicably had a bad feeling.\u201cThat night, my teammate took me to the bar street to relax. I didn\u2019t expect that Coach Lin would suddenly come out and pester me on the way back.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou talked slowly. He remembered that time and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know each other at the time and I wasn\u2019t interested in meddling with other people\u2019s affairs. However, you pestered me and kept saying\u2026 you really want me. Thinking about it carefully, it is probably the predestined relationship from the legends.\u201dHe paused for a moment and looked at Lin Yan with a smile. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why but looking at Coach Lin\u2019s face at the time, I suddenly felt soft-hearted.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAccording to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s description, if he wasn\u2019t exaggerating then Lin Yan had basically molested him. However, the focus of Lin Yan\u2019s attention was that he really took the initiative to pester Jing Yuanzhou? Then could everything that happened in the dream be true?In a rare moment, Lin Yan felt his ears burning hot. He reached out to rub his aching forehead and avoided Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze by covering half his face with his other hand. \u201cI should thank you for sending me to the hotel but\u2026 what is with the one jiao service fee?\u201dJing Yuanzhou gave a low laugh. \u201cDo you really want to know?\u201dLin Yan grabbed a steamed bun, took a fierce bite and replied numbly. \u201cYes.\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought about it. \u201cIn fact, I just did it on a whim. After all, Coach Lin did please me all night. I didn\u2019t want to leave directly. I always felt it was a bit immoral.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNot to mention that the act of leaving one jiao was immoral but\u2026 please him? What the hell was this?\u201cYou know about those things in the club. My mood at the time was very bad or else Ku Tianlu wouldn\u2019t have tried his best to take me out to relax. \u201c Jing Yuanzhou spoke emotionally before laughing. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t meet you that night, perhaps I truly would\u2019ve wasted time on that insignificant problem.\u201dLin Yan raised his eyebrow at the words. He wanted to tease this person with a few sentences but Jing Yuanzhou suddenly stared at him and spoke sincerely. \u201cSo I have to say something. Thank you.\u201dThe last words fell on his ears and seemed to slightly scratch at his heart. Lin Yan was stunned for a moment and words flowed out of his mouth after a pause. \u201c\u2026There is no need.\u201dAfter all, even he didn\u2019t know how he had \u2018pleased\u2019 this top god. In the final analysis, drinking was a mistake.Lin Yan was silent for a moment but he didn\u2019t let Jing Yuanzhou deviate from the topic. He casually rubbed his hair and returned to the topic. \u201cHowever, if you really want to thank me then why didn\u2019t you say anything when you added me on WeChat that day? Or do you think it is fun to play with me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou really had no reason to hide it. It might seem on the surface that he had given Lin Yan a lot of face by joining GH but he knew that he was actually the one who enjoyed great luck. Whether it was joining this brand new club or meeting Lin Yan, it was a lifetime of luck.Now Jing Yuanzhou saw Lin Yan\u2019s expression and lowered his voice to explain, \u201cIn fact, I was a bit scared when I heard your gritted teeth.\u201dLin Yan heard this sentence and smiled. \u201cTitans will also be scared?\u201d\u201cI was terrified at the time.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou chuckled. \u201cAfter all, I hadn\u2019t joined the team. If I suddenly came out to claim my identity and you thought I was asking for responsibility for that matter then it would be uncomfortable.\u201dLin Yan\u2019s eyebrows twitched slightly and he asked tentatively, \u201c\u2026What matter?\u201dJing Yuanzhou sent him a meaningful look. \u201cIn fact, it isn\u2019t a big deal. You just dirtied my body that night.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c???\u201dHe wanted to ask but there was a loud noise as something fell to the ground by the door. The two of them instinctively looked back and saw Gu Luo standing at the door with a dull expression. Documents were scattered on the ground by his feet.Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was a strange silence in the room.Gu Luo had been entrusted by the crew to send over today\u2019s program schedule. Just now, he saw the door wasn\u2019t closed and gently opened it to take a look. He was caught off guard after hearing such words and his body was petrified in place.Dirtied Titans\u2019 body? Who did it\u2026 Coach Lin?!In the end, Jing Yuanzhou cleared his throat and broke the silence. \u201cGloy, what is it?\u201dFreestarGu Luo came back to his senses. He hurriedly picked up the information and placed it down carefully and cautiously. \u201cI-It is nothing serious. This is what the director of the program sent. I didn\u2019t hear anything. Captain, Coach, you\u2026 continue. I will go first!\u201dHe finished speaking and turned around to leave immediately. Then Lin Yan called out to him with a blank expression. \u201cWait a minute.\u201dGu Luo turned around stiffly and was even shaking. \u201cIs\u2026 is there something else?\u201dSurely it wasn\u2019t to kill him?\u201dLin Yan slowly let out a sigh before uttering in a calm tone, \u201cCould I trouble you to close the door.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dJing Yuanzhou waited until Gu Luo closed the door before smiling and turning back. He stared at Lin Yan and continued with the topic like nothing happened. \u201cNow that Coach Lin has discovered me, what do you plan to do next? Do you intend to strip me naked, throw me on the bed, torture me, destroy me, trample on me, humiliate me and let me kneel down in front of you, crying and begging for forgiveness?\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck, had this person been thinking about it for a long time? How else could he remember it exactly?Jing Yuanzhou tilted his head and watched this person with a smile. \u201cCome on, I\u2019m ready.\u201dTheir eyes met in mid-air. Lin Yan instinctively looked at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s slightly open neckline and his throat moved slightly. However, he just said, \u201cYou are sweaty from your run. Go and take a shower first.\u201dJing Yuanzhou stood up obediently. \u201cOkay.\u201dBy the time the GH team gathered in the business car, Gu Luo had been sitting in it for a long time. He stared up at the distant sky and it was unknown what he was thinking. Jian Ye noticed his strangeness straight away. He walked over and lovingly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you feel uncomfortable?\u201dGu Luo sent him a look. \u201cNo.\u201dBi Yaohua had just sat down behind him. Then Bi Yaohua looked up and whistled when he saw the two figures coming in the distance. \u201cThe captain and coach are here too! However, why do I feel that the atmosphere between them is a bit different?\u201dGu Luo recalled his previous experience. He pressed his mouth tighter together under the desire to survive.Jing Yuanzhou sat in the back seat but Lin Yan didn\u2019t follow. He arbitrarily opened the door of the front passenger seat and took a seat. The cameraman following him was too late to stop it. He said hesitantly, \u201cThat\u2026 is my position.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t raise his head. \u201cBig brother, sit at the back. Close-up shots are also good since the effect is unexpected. After all, there are so many dramas in our team. Every minute and every second is important. Don\u2019t miss it.\u201dThe innocent GH team, \u201c?\u201dSo this was what the coach thought of them? However, were they that playful?Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help raising his head and looking in front with faint joy in his eyes. Lin Yan saw the expression through the rearview mirror and the corners of his mouth lowered even further.The moment he heard Jing Yuanzhou say those words, he could understand Gloy\u2019s shock. After all, he hadn\u2019t expected that he would be so \u2018wild\u2019 after he became drunk. For a moment, he even sincerely wondered if he should take responsibility for this matter.Yet what was the result? Jing Yuanzhou later told him that Lin Yan just had to buy a new set of clothes to pay him back? After teasing Lin Yan for so long, it was actually because Lin Yan vomited on him and dirtied his clothes?That was it? That was it???The business car started driving but the atmosphere today was extremely depressed due to the low air pressure around someone.Lin Yan had read the schedule submitted by the program group and summed it up concisely. \u201cThe first part has no elimination system. It is just entertainment events. You don\u2019t have to feel pressured and can play whatever you want. This is our team\u2019s first public appearance. If there is any disharmony during the recording process, once the shooting is over, I will go back and do a good, good review with everyone. Do you understand?\u201dThe GH members, \u201c\u2026We understand.\u201dLin Yan hummed. \u201cThere is nothing else to say. That\u2019s it.\u201dThe entire car became silent.Sitting in the crowd, the cameraman couldn\u2019t help secretly wiping the sweat on his hands. What was it about \u2018every minute and every second was of essence?\u2019Bi Yaohua leaned against the window to watch the scenery. Finally, he couldn\u2019t endure it. He quietly pulled Gu Luo over and whispered, \u201cDidn\u2019t you send the information over this morning? Did you find anything wrong? What is going on with the coach and the captain? Did they argue?\u201dIt had to be said that the Trash Talk King\u2019s intuition was really sharp. Unfortunately, it was sharp in the wrong direction.Gu Luo was originally playing with his mobile phone. He wanted to be an invisible person and didn\u2019t want to mention this topic at all. At this time, he trembled when he heard the question and almost cried out. \u201cBrother, don\u2019t ask me. I really don\u2019t know anything!\u201dBi Yaohua looked strangely at Gu Luo\u2019s face that said \u2018If you force me, I will commit suicide.\u2019 Then he let out a meaningful \u2018oh.\u2019He patted Gu Luo sympathetically on the shoulder. \u201cIt turned out to be this! Don\u2019t worry, I understand!\u201dGu Luo, \u201c!\u201dFreestarWhat did he understand???The author has something to say:Gloy: Don\u2019t ask me, I didn\u2019t hear anything, I don\u2019t know anything!(Weak, helpless, shivering)6th Anniversary Event PageProofreader: NaoMOBA Terms PagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before the official recording, all participating teams were in their respective lounges to finish up their styling. According to the requirements of the program, each team consisted of five official players and one coach. For a team like GH that had no substitutes, all the players would participate.Jian Ye\u2019s short hair was the most convenient to take care of. He finished the styling first and went to the bathroom. Once he came back, he didn\u2019t even enter through the door when his voice was heard. \u201cFuck, you won\u2019t guess who I just saw outside?\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s fancy coloured hair almost drove the stylist crazy. At this time, he was forcibly pressed to the chair and didn\u2019t dare to move. He raised his eyes and guessed sincerely, \u201cUltraman?\u2019Gu Luo listened to the side and laughed. Then he followed with a guess. \u201cOr could it be a little monster?\u201dJian Ye had a headache. \u201cGloy, stay away from BB. Don\u2019t be led astray by him.\u201dBi Yaohua casually picked up a book next to him and threw it over without looking. He said with a smile. \u201cI am a fine young man who likes to see people blossoming. How can I lead people astray? Don\u2019t damage my reputation.\u201d\u201cFirst of all, you need to have a reputation\u2026\u201d Jian Ye replied casually while avoiding the sneak attack. He continued to ask Chen Yushen next to him, \u201cAbyss, guess.\u201dChen Yushen thought deeply. \u201cIs it a professional player?\u201dAfter all, this was an official e-sports show organized by the Burning Hot League. It was now in the offseason and the mid-season competition hadn\u2019t officially started. It was reasonable to invite a professional player.He finally met a normal teammate. Jian Ye smiled mysteriously and lowered his voice, \u201cYou might not believe me but I saw Luni from LDF on the way to the bathroom!\u201dBi Yaohua and Gu Luo, \u201cOh\u2026\u201dJian Ye exclaimed, \u201cWhat the hell? You are only reacting like this?\u201dBi Yaohua told him, \u201cHow should I react? A shooter like me will never have any true feelings for a mid-laner professional player.\u201dGu Luo gently scratched his face. \u201cI\u2019m a mid-laner but\u2026 Luni isn\u2019t my style. I still prefer our captain.\u201dJian Ye muttered, \u201c\u2026Okay, then pretend I didn\u2019t say it.\u201dLin Yan was sitting on the sofa and he suddenly opened his mouth. \u201cThey actually invited Luni? This is good. I don\u2019t know if we will be able to play an entertainment game together. The media previously said that it was regrettable Titans and Luni didn\u2019t have an opportunity to play each other. Now it is just right. There is an opportunity to realize my dream.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked up and smiled. \u201cWhy do I feel that Coach Lin seems to expect me to be beaten on the field.\u201dLin Yan told him, \u201cBe more confident and remove the \u2018seems\u2019.\u201dThe two of them hadn\u2019t spoken for a while. At this time, they exchanged a few words and the atmosphere in the lounge was finally lively. Jian Ye fell silent for a moment. He returned to his position and told the makeup artist, \u201cExcuse me, please give me more powder.\u201dLin Yan looked at Jing Yuanzhou with a smile. Then he returned his attention to his phone and didn\u2019t speak any further. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s styling was finished and he stood up.Gu Luo saw that he was going and instinctively gave a reminder. \u201cCaptain, the recording is about to begin.\u201dJing Yuanzhou silently glanced in Lin Yan\u2019s direction before smiling. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m just going to check with Luni about the details of the beating. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dLin Yan raised his eyebrow slightly and ignored it. After Jing Yuanzhou pushed open the door and went out, he quickly found Luni who was discussing the process with the staff. The little tail behind the head was as eye-catching as ever.Everyone knew that the LDF and BK teams had always been rivals on the field. In private, they didn\u2019t have much interaction but they didn\u2019t have any personal grievances. On the contrary, players at their level sympathized with each other. Luni had always been concerned about Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s sudden transfer and helped come up with ideas in private.Previously, they didn\u2019t have a chance to meet. At this time, it wasn\u2019t easy to meet so Jing Yuanzhou should at least greet him for the sake of emotions and reason. Luni was obviously still worried about the transfer. \u201cIf it was me, I would choose to transfer. However, there are so many strong teams who want you. Why did you go to GH? Your price might be high but you don\u2019t look like someone who needs the transfer fee. If you let BK relax a bit then we might be teammates in LDF now.\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at him. \u201cAre you serious about me going to LDF?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cI have just one question. If we really become teammates, do you think LDF will continue with the mid-lane core system or will they shift the focus to my side?\u201dThis simple sentence stopped Luni from talking any further. He was well aware that LDF\u2019s current set of tactics had been used proficiently for a long time and it was impossible to make changes overnight.\u201cTherefore, many clubs might be good choices but they actually don\u2019t fit me.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou stopped here and didn\u2019t continue. He changed the subject. \u201cSpeaking of which, is LDF short of money? Why did they let you out to show your face and start doing this type of business?\u201d\u201cCan you talk well? What type of business is this? It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re implying that I\u2019m selling myself.\u201d Luni glanced at him irritably before laughing. \u201cWhy do I feel like a good and serious variety show has changed after being mentioned by you? This is an official show hosted by the league. Someone went to the club to invite me and we have to give them some face. In any case, there is still some time before the mid-season competition. I came to relax.\u201dJing Yuanzhou just said \u2018oh\u2019 before asking with interest, \u201cSo you should\u2019ve seen the program for the entire season?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen it. Why?\u201d\u201cIn the follow-up recordings, will they arrange for you professional players to play with our unofficial team?\u201dLuni, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2018You professional players\u2019 and \u2018our unofficial team\u2019. Was this really giving up on himself after transferring?Luni couldn\u2019t accept Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s easy-going attitude. However, they were usually opponents and he still maintained some vigilance. \u201cThere is indeed such an event in the next few episodes but what do you want to do? Don\u2019t tell me that you want me to choose you to face? Haha, don\u2019t even think about it. Do you think I will give you this opportunity to abuse me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed. \u201cWhat if I want to be abused?\u201dLuni, \u201c?\u201dA figure flashed in his mind and Jing Yuanzhou smiled slightly. \u201cPreviously, I accidentally upset someone and I don\u2019t know how to coax him. If I am too pitiful on stage, perhaps he will soften up and forgive me. Do you think so?\u201dFreestarSuch words plunged Luni into extreme shock for a long time. It took him ages before he could say a sentence. \u201cFuck, what is your situation. Is this\u2026 love?\u201dJing Yuanzhou returned to the lounge and a few staff members arrived to hurriedly take them to the waiting area.Lin Yan was walking in front when Jing Yuanzhou suddenly called out to him. \u201cLin Yan.\u201dHe turned around and looked over. \u201cHuh?\u201dHe hadn\u2019t asked anything when he found that Jing Yuanzhou had already approached. The man\u2019s arm reached out and carefully adjusted the neckline for Lin Yan. \u201cYour collar wasn\u2019t adjusted properly.\u201dAt such a close distance, a faint breath vaguely touched his cheeks.Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help being stunned. He raised his head to look at this person who was clearly showing a good performance, but held back his smile. After finishing the preparations, he hadn\u2019t said anything when he saw the incoming ZX team. A meaningful smile flashed in Lin Yan\u2019s eyes.Everyone in the ZX team didn\u2019t look very energetic. They were covered by makeup but the dark circles under their eyes could still be seen. Once they saw GH, they instinctively wanted to avoid GH but they were stopped first.Lin Yan naturally wouldn\u2019t waste the opportunity to say hello. He stood in the middle of the path calmly and inserted as much caring as possible into his tone. \u201cHello everyone, how are you doing? How was your rest yesterday? There shouldn\u2019t be any stomach troubles anymore, right?\u201dEveryone in GH tried not to laugh.The expression of ZX\u2019s captain was a bit ugly at these words. \u201cCoach Lin doesn\u2019t have to worry. We are fine.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Lin Yan nodded with satisfaction and glanced at the sullen LAN in the rear, his tone stretching out a bit. \u201cI am looking forward to the recording of the program in a while.\u201dThe moment such a gaze fell on LAN, he instinctively felt his back becoming cold.In the distance, they could hear loud background sounds. It wasn\u2019t difficult to tell that it was an audio clip from various Burning Hot games. After it was played, there were warm cheers. The recording of the first episode had officially started.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They didn\u2019t simultaneously broadcast the scenes on all major platforms. Even so, the huge audience group invited to the scene was enough to stir the atmosphere to the peak.The host finished the simple opening remarks. Then Luni appeared on stage and there were more loud screams. The entire audience was boiling over and the noise almost overturned the roof of the studio.Bi Yaohua couldn\u2019t help digging at his ears. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with young people these days? Is Luni\u2019s popularity that high?\u201dGu Luo muttered, \u201cOne of the five phenomenal players who can be as famous as Titans is naturally popular.\u201dBi Yaohua gave him a disgusted look. \u201cIf you want to praise the captain then just praise him. Why do it in such a roundabout way? LDF will be our opponent in the future. Have you started to raise their morale early to destroy their prestige?\u201dThe innocent Gu Luo had a huge pot of blame placed on him. \u201c\u2026I was wrong, Brother.\u201dIn the blink of an eye, the audience had been warmed up and it was time for the teams to take to the stage.There were a total of eight teams participating in the show. Apart from GH, they were basically all common teams in the secondary league. Among them, the two teams QU and IBB had the highest popularity. The teams would appear in the order arranged by the staff.Once it was the turn of the IBB team, Bi Yaohua couldn\u2019t help muttering, \u201cPreviously, fans always asked me about my relationship with this club. It might be annoying but IBB, IBB\u2026 I love BB. I always suspect that the boss has a crush on me.\u201dJian Ye couldn\u2019t help interrupting him. \u201c\u2026Brother Trash Talk, please wake up. It is still daytime.\u201dAccording to the order, it was their GH team after IBB. Being arranged last was also considered a key treatment.They might only be a newly formed team but Jing Yuanzhou and Bi Yaohua had both been professional players in the official league. Combined with the massive hype some time ago, the specific strength of the other players might be unknown but the popularity of the team was unexpectedly high. The shouts on the scene weren\u2019t inferior to the two popular teams, QU and IBB.Everyone stood on the stage and the host gave a brief introduction before starting the interview session. \u201cYou are different from the other teams. This is the first time that GH has made a public appearance since its establishment. The program has collected the opinions of many netizens. Some of them think that GH can\u2019t go far on this stage. Others think that as long as Titans is on the field, he can play five at a time.\u201dAt this point, the host smiled softly and habitually dug a pit. \u201cWhat does Coach Lin think about this?\u201dThe audience\u2019s eyes instantly fell on him. Lin Yan didn\u2019t show any nervousness. He heard these words and his mouth twitched slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t mention anything else. I really believe that Titans can hit five at a time.\u201dThe host, \u201c?\u201dHe just asked casually but this person actually dared to answer?Lin Yan continued unhurriedly. \u201cThus, the championship is destined to be ours. The other teams should pack up and go home as soon as possible.\u201dThe host\u2019s expression froze slightly. He was silent for a moment before he found his voice. \u201cHehe, Coach Lin is quite humorous.\u201dHe no longer dared to let Lin Yan speak. He hurriedly changed to Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cSo what does Titans think?\u201dAfter all, he was a veteran of the professional league. He should always be aware of his words in a public place. The host saw Jing Yuanzhou chuckle lightly. \u201cDon\u2019t say five. The coach has spoken. If he lets me play against 10 then I must be able to do so.\u201dThe host, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe players of the other teams present, \u201c???\u201dThe host finally controlled his emotions and bluntly put an end to this part. \u201cIn short, let us welcome the arrival of the GH team. Finally, let\u2019s listen to the contestants\u2019 determination in this show!\u201dIn e-sports, the pre-match trash talk was an indispensable part. In this entertainment variety show, the program was willing to do this to enhance the fire on the field.Bi Yaohua obviously liked this part a lot. He immediately took the microphone. \u201cI have to apologize for one thing. I haven\u2019t had the chance to get to know everyone present before today. However, it doesn\u2019t matter. I believe that by the end of this show, this problem will be solved.\u201dHe smiled and concluded. \u201cAfter all, I am the Trash Talk King. I never care about the weak.\u201dEveryone at the scene, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe still had to trash talk!Next was Gu Luo. He cleared his throat in the uproar and spoke very modestly. \u201cNo matter how weak, I will try my best to understand them.\u201dThen Jian Ye took the microphone, his mouth curved up wildly. \u201cI will stand there and not fight back. If someone can kill me then I will remember him.\u201dChen Yushen thought about it before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to understand. Forget it.\u201dJing Yuanzhou took the microphone and smiled slightly, his tone sincere. \u201cAnyway, jiayou.\u201dThe audience, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe other participating teams, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWhy did God Jing cheer for them?!!!The host stuttered, \u201c\u2026Thank\u2026 thank you for your words. Coach Lin, do you have anything to say?\u201dLin Yan slightly cleared his throat and spoke in a relaxed tone. \u201cEveryone has worked hard to participate in the program recording. You can rest assured that GH will give the tickets home to everyone.\u201dThe entire scene was completely silent. The other teams had completed the trash talk in turn but considering the fact that the program would be broadcasted on major platforms sooner or later, they still restrained themselves. Meanwhile, the GH team completely used its own strength to firmly pull all the hatred on themselves. They simply weren\u2019t afraid of being attacked by the crowd!Seeing that LIn Yan still wanted to continue, the host instinctively jumped out and raised his tone. \u201cWelcome to Burning Hot Assembly everyone. Please take a seat!\u201dLin Yan still had some unfinished thoughts but he was easy-going. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe handed the microphone to the staff member next to him and took the team to the seats with the GH logo on them. There was a simple link and they quickly entered the first part of the first episode. The entertainment solo game.Bi Yaohua eagerly rubbed his hands together. \u201cIt is coming right? This is it.\u201d\u201cSolo is a 1v1 matchup. Each team has three places and ZX should send their shooter LAN right?\u201d Jian Ye\u2019s gaze swept eagerly over the ZX team. \u201cWhat should we do later? Let Abyss go to get revenge?\u201dLin Yan sent him a disgusted look. \u201cDoes this type of weak person need Abyss to do it? He can cut LAN seven or eight hundred times without any sense of accomplishment.\u201dJian Ye frowned. \u201cHowever, if the others go then isn\u2019t it still abuse?\u201d\u201cAbusing the weak is a science too. If you want to abuse them, you should do it deeply. You are still young. I don\u2019t blame you for not understanding.\u201d Lin Yan glanced at the rule on the big screen. In this once in a lifetime opportunity, I\u2019ve thought about it. Gun Zai, you will go.\u201dChen Yushen originally wanted to take the initiative to volunteer but he silently swallowed back his words. It was a shame that he couldn\u2019t play and hammer LAN but imagining Jian Ye playing solo as a healer, it was indeed a bit exciting?Bi Yaohua exclaimed, \u201cFuck, Coach, your plan is simple\u2026 devilish, cough, I mean wonderful!\u201dGu Luo couldn\u2019t help remembering his bad memories of Jian Ye\u2019s first day at the base and his spirit silently stirred. He didn\u2019t want to experience this nauseous feeling a second time.Jian Ye himself held malice toward LAN and he naturally had no objection to such an arrangement. He rolled up his sleeves eagerly. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, leave it to Brother Gun. I will burst his milk!\u201dFreestarLin Yan shook his index finger and spoke in a kind tone. \u201cWe are all civilized people. Remember not to be too fierce. You should\u2026 play slowly.\u201dJian Ye smiled heartily. \u201cUnderstood!\u201dGu Luo raised his hand. \u201cHowever, what if we don\u2019t get the qualification to play against ZX?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s tone was calm. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we will get it.\u201dThe host was currently introducing the rules of the next event. A few staff members ran over and handed a handwriting board to each team. All the teams wrote down the opponent they wanted to face. According to the rules, the team with the most votes would be given priority to select their opponent. Soon, the teams showed the name they had written.Apart from ZX, all teams had two letters \u2018GH\u2019 written neatly and uniformly.Lin Yan leaned on the writing board with a smile and raised his eyebrow slightly. \u201cOh, it seems that our trash talk link was very popular! I am very at ease with your ability to pull hatred!\u201dThe author has something to say:We are first class when it comes to pulling hatred! [By the GH Team]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 25.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayObviously, the results of this voting stunned the host. However, combined with the previous pre-match trash talk, it was natural for GH to receive this honor.In a way, it was also amazing that they could let the other teams unite like this.After a few simple jokes, the host started the process very professionally. \u201cLet\u2019s congratulate the GH team for winning the first round of selection. I must say that everyone is really looking forward to this brand new team. So, I would like to ask the team leader of GH, which team do you want to invite in this round?\u201dThe host glanced at the board in front of Lin Yan and was almost ready to cue in IBB. IBB\u2019s side had already seen the name of their team on the board. They had an urgent internal discussion and quickly formulated a set of battle plans. Their preferred opponent to play against was GH. After all, they had spoken such arrogant words. The secondary league players wanted to see what this team was capable of in the end.However, from a certain point of view, the rules for this event were quite favourable to the GH team. After all, Titans and BB were two former professional players. who weren\u2019t easy to face. They would have to work hard to score a point from them and from the third rookie player. All in all, it was three solo games and it was right to fight to win two.It was just that when all the parties were ready, they saw Lin Yan take the microphone and say concisely, \u201cWe choose ZX.\u201dEveryone in the IBB team, \u201c???\u201dThe ZX team had a bad feeling just now. Then they heard Lin Yan\u2019s words and all the team members paled in an instant. If it wasn\u2019t for the program being recorded, LAN almost turned around and left after remembering what happened the night before.The host was also slightly surprised. \u201cYou choose\u2026 ZX?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s expression was even stranger. \u201cIs there any problem?\u201dThe host took another look at the writing board in front of Lin Yan and reminded this person, \u201cYou wrote IBB just now?\u201dLin Yan made an \u2018oh\u2019 sound and replied very honestly, \u201cThis is casually written. Don\u2019t care about the details.\u201dEveryone in IBB, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan noticed the silence around him and asked in a confused manner, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? This isn\u2019t possible?\u201dThe host was choked up for a moment. \u201cOf course\u2026 it is fine! Okay, let\u2019s look at the lineup of both teams.\u201dThe big screen quickly lit up. Not surprisingly, LAN was on the ZX team\u2019s roster. Lin Yan exchanged glances with the players with a smile in his eyes. On the other hand, there was a stir at the scene the moment GH\u2019s players were announced. To everyone\u2019s surprise, the most popular players in the team, Jing Yuanzhou and Bi Yaohua weren\u2019t arranged to appear.Behind the GH team logo on the screen, three eye-catching IDs stood out. Who would\u2019ve imagined that despite the rules that were extremely beneficial to GH, this team would take the initiative to give up all its advantages and send its newcomers into battle?Reckless, aggressive and too arrogant. They seemed to be silently saying that no matter which GH player came out, they had the ability to absolutely crush their opponents. After all, this was a new team. It was understandable to use this unique method to prove themselves. The key issue was\u2026Everyone knew that Jing Yuanzhou and Bi Yaohua were the two side lane players, with one being the shooter. If they weren\u2019t playing, did it mean the team\u2019s support was also mixed into the GH team\u2019s solo list?FreestarIt wasn\u2019t that support players couldn\u2019t play output heroes. It was just that after praying to Buddha for so long, there were no professional support players who could be fierce on the field. This wasn\u2019t a question of self-confidence. It wasn\u2019t known if GH wasn\u2019t watching this show at all or if they were simply looking down on their opponents.In the relaxed GH team, there was one person who couldn\u2019t help talking because of this lineup.Due to Lin Yan, Bi Yaohua didn\u2019t dare make too much trouble. He just whispered, \u201cWhat a good chance to start the game. Why not let me go? At the level of the secondary league, I can play against two people with one head, let alone a team like ZX. Isn\u2019t it good to directly kill with the first wave of soldiers? Moreover, it can save recording time. Going home early to rest can be considered a benefit to society!\u201dAs another \u2018refrigerated\u2019 player, Jing Yuanzhou spoke lightly. \u201cWe will have many opportunities like this in the future.\u201dBi Yaohua naturally understood the meaning of these words and fell silent instantly. He originally wanted to force out a few more sentences but now he changed the shape of his lips. \u201cThis is true. Let this opportunity be given to the younger generation.\u201dBi Yaohua might seem not well received but he had played in the professional league after all. He wasn\u2019t as good as Jing Yuanzhou but he had never lacked an opportunity to show his face. In comparison, their three other teammates were different. They were new stars who were just beginning to shine. Lin Yan made such a lineup because he wanted to use this opportunity to let everyone remember the names that were destined to shine in the very first episode of the program.After such a lineup was announced, some people were disappointed but others looked forward to it. As the opponent of the GH team, ZX were a bit confused. Unlike other teams, ZX had fully felt the strength of the GH team in the previous friendly match.The matter of who the other side sent wasn\u2019t the issue they needed to pay attention to most. The key point now was how to retain their last dignity in front of the camera. At the very least, it would be nice to die a bit more peacefully.The host inquired about it and the first pairing to appear was selected by GH. LAN wasn\u2019t surprised to hear his name. He took a deep breath and walked to the field under the leadership of the staff.It was almost certain that his opponent would be Abyss. The jungler might be the nemesis of the fragile shooter but if he was a bit wretched, he could forcibly drag back the rhythm and develop enough to possess equipment. It wasn\u2019t impossible to win.LAN took a breath to adjust his mentality. He inadvertently raised his head and saw the tall figure standing up from the GH player seats. It was too unbelievable and he was stunned. Rather than sitting back like LAN expected, he went all the way to the opposite battle zone and started debugging his equipment with the assistance of the staff.LAN\u2019s gaze fell on Jian Ye\u2019s scar and his mind was dull for a moment. If he remembered correctly, this scarred man seemed to be GH\u2019s support? What about Abyss? What did they mean by arranging a support to fight against him?!Perhaps LAN\u2019s gaze was too hot. Jian Ye was slightly taken aback when their eyes met. Then he smiled playfully. \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. Trust me, Brother Gun will be sure to let you play coolly!\u201dLAN heard the words and his lips twitched fiercely. The originally depressed emotions changed to a bit of anger. Fuck, this person was just a support yet he was so arrogant!The others quickly noticed Jian Ye\u2019s position in the GH team. The other teams spoke a few words in low voices while the first solo game officially began. All their attention was directed at the big screen in the centre of the field.It was the selection section.LAN quickly locked onto his best shooter hero. Everyone was looking forward to which output Jian Ye would choose but he didn\u2019t hesitate to lock onto the super-healing support hero, Linley Witch.In this instant, the whole scene fell into a strange silence.Let\u2019s not talk about how such a sexy beauty didn\u2019t match with the crew-cut cool guy on the field. The most incomprehensible thing was that he was currently playing a 1v1 solo game. Although the healing heroes in the current version weren\u2019t very popular, he could choose to play a big-breasted healer in the team match. Why play a healer now in a solo game?!Everyone was shocked and then felt admiration. After all, not everyone could make the opponent feel ridiculed just by choosing a hero. Taking a healer against a shooter, it was clearly looking down on the opponent.Sure enough, the hostility in LAN\u2019s eyes became harder to suppress. Once his character refreshed at the resurrection point, he quickly came to the lane with his soldiers.FreestarJian Ye was relatively more conservative. The level one hero might have an output skill but the Linley Witch didn\u2019t deal much damage after all. He didn\u2019t clear soldiers as fast as the opponent and was quickly pressed under the tower.Such a scene relieved a lot of the anger in LAN\u2019s heart and he pushed even harder. Oh, was it so easy for a confident healer to hit a shooter?As time passed, both sides soon reached level three. There was a flash of light and Jian Ye\u2019s Linley Witch finally took action. A new wave of soldiers had just arrived. She twisted her small waist and took a few steps forward.Seeing the opposing support dare to step out of the defense tower, LAN couldn\u2019t help the ridicule flashing in his eyes. He took advantage of this opportunity and didn\u2019t continue eating at the soldiers. He quickly went to deal some damage.At the same time, the Linley Witch\u2019s lone whip hit the shooter hero twice. It was just that the damage of the support hero wasn\u2019t enough compared to the high-intensity output of the shooter.Seeing the Linley Witch retreat with after losing blood, LAN contentedly began to kill the line of soldiers again. However, after a while, the opposite support appeared in front of him again with full health.Fuck, it was disgusting to be able to add health! LAN frowned and hit the opponent again. The Linley Witch retreated again before soon coming back to dance enchantingly in front of him.LAN, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he knew it, this scene repeated itself over and over again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The other party would always be in a state of full energy and blood, apart from the rise and fall in mana. From the equipment column, it could be seen that Jian Ye\u2019s equipment was one that kept restoring mana. It was like a full battery life.Under such repetition, LAN was almost numb. It wasn\u2019t until he returned to his senses that he discovered that his health bar had been half consumed by the opposite Linley Witch. It was actually a bit dangerous.LAN gritted his teeth angrily but he could only watch the sexy figure keep jumping forward and retreating. He felt there was no way. At this stage, his output situation could be called very embarrassing. Unless both of Jian Ye\u2019s hands left the keyboard, there was no possibility of completing the kill.On the contrary, he was being consumed while wanting to take the head of the healer. There was nothing to do. LAN could only choose to quickly push at the opposing line of soldiers and return to the base to restore his status.This time, he returned to the city and Jian Ye quickly acted. He killed some of the soldiers in LAN\u2019s line and returned to the city to fill up his blue and equipment. It wasn\u2019t until a brief intermission that someone discovered this game was too long. It had gone on for eight minutes. A game that was supposed to end quickly had actually dragged out to eight minutes and there was still the trend of it continuing.In fact, after watching, the audience couldn\u2019t say that LAN was too weak. He could only blame GH\u2019s healer for being too detailed! Every time, the healing skill was used at the correct rhythm and completely prevented the opponent from having a chance to kill him.Jian Ye took advantage of returning to the base to update his equipment. Once the Linley Witch returned to the lane again, Jian Ye was bolder than he was originally. Linley Witch was a shy beauty but now she had become an unrestrained hot rose.Previously, Jian Ye had just circled LAN a few times but now he entered directly into the line of soldiers. The smile on LAN\u2019s face had finally disappeared. He found that he had no way to kill the support.Jian Ye\u2019s current state inevitably reminded people of his trash talk before the game. \u2018I will stand in place and not fight back. If someone can kill me then I will remember them.\u2019Judging from the current rhythm, he really\u2026 couldn\u2019t be killed.FreestarBy the time the game had lasted 15 minutes, the host almost went crazy. According to the original plan, the third game should\u2019ve started by now. If every subsequent game was like this then could they still record today\u2019s show?Under the stage, in addition to the ZX team, the players of the other teams were discussing it.The captain of IBB said, \u201cIs this support from GH called Gun? His healing as support is decent!\u201dThe shooter said, \u201cIt is more than decent. He is simply a mobile spring! Why do I feel like this solo game can\u2019t be finished?\u201dThe captain of IBB glanced in Jian Ye\u2019s direction and frowned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter when the game is over. We aren\u2019t playing anyway and can just rest. I just don\u2019t know why but I feel like I\u2019ve seen this support before.\u201dThe support was speechless. \u201cCaptain, don\u2019t you recognize him?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dThe assistant said, \u201cDidn\u2019t we go communicate with JH offline before? Gun was the team\u2019s support substitute and I talked to him. This is why I was so surprised to see the player list announced by GH. I didn\u2019t expect him to actually transfer.\u201d\u201cJH\u2019s substitute support?\u201d A hint of surprise flashed in the IBB captain\u2019s eyes. He looked at the field again and his lips pressed together. \u201cJH actually gave the GH team such a big gift!\u201dHe was somewhat thankful that it wasn\u2019t his team playing against GH. Otherwise, it was\u2026 too disgusting!On the field, the game progressed to 20 minutes and LAN\u2019s mental state had basically collapsed. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to output even if Linley Witch stood in front of him. At this time, any offense seemed to lose value. His output hitting Linley Witch was just like a small tickling. He was scratching someone else\u2019s body while it was him who felt disgusted.Another wave of soldiers arrived and LAN finally gave up on the idea of killing the opponent. He chose to forcibly push to the opponent\u2019s defense tower. After all, there was more than one way to win a solo match.LAN took a deep breath and forcibly cheered himself up. He followed the rapidly advancing soldiers to the opponent\u2019s defense tower. Thanks to this action, the outcome was determined in 20 seconds.LAN stared at the dark screen in front of him for a long time without regaining his senses until a staff member came to remind him. The first drop of blood appeared and the killing was completed, but it was done by GH\u2019s Jian Ye.In the solo game, he worked hard for over 20 minutes but he still lost to a healing support? His health and mana might not be good at the time but LAN was very clear about the reason for his defeat. It was because he didn\u2019t notice how the other party had \u2018cheated\u2019 the output aggro!He was trying to clear the soldiers quickly and he only used long-ranged shooting skills. He didn\u2019t expect that the Linley Witch would deliberately receive the injury instead of the soldier at the most extreme distance. This overly detailed operation led to the shooter being the output target of the defense tower.The defense tower attacked him again and again and his blood gauge emptied in the blink of an eye. The last damage came from the lone whip thrown by Linley Witch. His character fell and LAN felt like he had been hit in the face. It was only the recording process but he could foresee the disgust and contempt of the barrage once the show was officially broadcasted.Jian Ye was the winner. He cheerfully walked over to LAN, took his hand and shook it heartily. Then he spoke in a particularly modest tone, \u201cHow about it? Didn\u2019t I say I could do it? Didn\u2019t Brother Gun make you cool?\u201dLAN, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dCool? He wanted to throw up! LAN gritted his teeth with anger. He wanted to say something but his vision suddenly became black. Fortunately, the staff next to him quickly supported him or he would\u2019ve fallen to the ground.The captain of ZX quickly ran over. He arranged for the team members to help LAN back to the player seats and apologized to the on-site director. \u201cSorry, he ate something bad last night and didn\u2019t rest well. Today he is a bit anemic. It is nothing and you can continue recording.\u201dJian Ye heard the words and sighed. \u201cThis is why things shouldn\u2019t be eaten indiscriminately.\u201dLAN was leaning on his teammates but he couldn\u2019t help rolling his eyes even more.Once the confusion calmed down, the host received the director\u2019s prompt and changed the topic. \u201cThen let us congratulate GH for winning the first game. We will invite the second group of individual players to play!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help glancing at the GH seats as he spoke. He saw Gu Luo standing up and was slightly relieved. An output player was finally dispatched.No one expected that after the first game took so long, the second one would end surprisingly quickly. Compared with Jian Ye\u2019s exaggerated solo duration, the time spent in the game by Gu Luo and Chen Yushen didn\u2019t even exceed three minutes. They forcibly rushed over as soon as they met the opponent and killed the opponent immediately!Under the stage, IBB\u2019s captain and QU\u2019s captain couldn\u2019t help exchanging glances. They saw the deep meaning in each other\u2019s eyes. It could only be said that it was fortunate GH wasn\u2019t participating in this year\u2019s secondary league. Otherwise, they would be a terrible opponent.Aside from the recognized strength of Jing Yuanzhou and Bi Yaohua, the remaining three had the capital to be arrogant. In the field of e-sports, \u2018crazy\u2019 was never a negative word as long as one had enough strength.The rapid pace of advancement caused the host to sigh with relief and he finally recovered his hosting rhythm.Chen Yushen came off the field and the other teams started playing. Lin Yan leaned back lazily. He saw Chen Yushen returning to the seats and reached out a hand toward him. \u201cYou played beautifully.\u201dChen Yushen was taken aback for a moment before reaching for the hand. Their palms met in the air with a clear sound.All the teams completed the solo games and the first phase of the recording officially ended. According to the rules of the program, the current results wouldn\u2019t affect the first elimination but the winner would have a special priority when recording the next episode.As for what it was, they weren\u2019t told. No one in GH cared. They were drowsy at the end of recording and went to the parking lot from the studio\u2019s safe corridor. In the distance, they could see the fans of other teams waiting outside with support cards. Colourful logos entered their field of view. A passing glance showed there was no GH, unsurprisingly.However, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s private fans alone were enough to match the teams from the secondary league. There was also no shortage of Bi Yaohua\u2019s black fans. Seeing Bi Yaohua passing by, they greeted their ancestors very politely.The group finally got in the car thanks to the escort of the security guards and sighed with relief. The moment Gu Luo sat down, he noticed there was one person missing in the car. \u201cWhere is Abyss?\u201dBi Yaohua stopped drinking water. \u201cUh\u2026 he was just walking behind me?\u201dThe moment he spoke, the car door opened. Chen Yushen appeared at the door in a somewhat embarrassed manner. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t paid attention when walking just now and found that he had gotten lost. He somehow followed the crowd and was pushed into the IBB team\u2019s fan circle. Even his hat was knocked askew a bit.He finally managed to break out of the encirclement and return to his team\u2019s car. Chen Yushen got into the car and couldn\u2019t help looking back. At the end of his vision, the flashing team logos were eye-catching and mixed with the passionate shouts of the fans. It made people excited. It was what he hoped for.Lin Yan noticed Chen Yushen\u2019s expression from where he was sitting in the front passenger\u2019s seat. He reached over and grabbed the crooked hat with one hand. Then he rubbed the teenager\u2019s hair.Chen Yushen regained his senses and looked up to meet a pair of smiling eyes.He heard the coach laugh in a low voice. \u201cDon\u2019t look. In any case, we will have that in the future.\u201dChen Yushen was slightly surprised when he heard the words. Gradually, the corners of his lips lifted up in a faint smile. \u201cEn.\u201dYes, whether it was starlight or glory, they would have it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then on the way back to the club, the members of the team didn\u2019t stay close to one another and slept in the car.Jing Yuanzhou wasn\u2019t too sleepy. He sat in the back row and watched Lin Yan in the passenger seat through the rearview mirror. The latter inadvertently raised his head to meet Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze before glancing away.Jian Ye was obviously tired from playing the solo game. The car soon filled with his snoring sounds. It rose and fell and was quite rhythmic. Chen Yushen frowned deeply and had sleepy eyes as he lowered the cap on his head even further.The journey passed in such a lively yet quiet atmosphere. By the time they returned to the base\u2019s dormitory, it was late at night. The group of people rubbed their messy hair and drifted back to their rooms like ghosts.Jing Yuanzhou took a shower when he came back. He came out of the bathroom and took a look at the time on his phone. Then he opened the door and saw light still leaking from the crack in the door on the opposite side.Sure enough, he guessed right. Someone was still doing the replay overnight while everyone else was sleeping at ease. Lin Yan\u2019s temperament meant he wasn\u2019t willing to miss any tactical information that could be used by the team, even if they were opponents from the secondary league. His words were obviously more arrogant than anyone else\u2019s, but in fact, no one took it more seriously than him.The hard work of e-sports players was well known. After all, they were in front of the stage and they never lacked the distress and concern of the fans. In contrast, the coaches supporting them behind the scenes were always ignored. They might be unknown but the sweat of the existences behind the scenes were no less than that of professional players. Sometimes it was even more.Jing Yuanzhou wiped the drops of water on his hair. He poured himself a cup of coffee downstairs and knocked on the door opposite his. After a moment, the door opened and Lin Yan looked at him. \u201cIs there something?\u201dPerhaps it was because his falling bangs kept getting in the way. At this time, he had tied it up in front of his forehead with a hair tie and there was an inexplicable cuteness. Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help but take several looks before he remembered to pass over the coffee. \u201cAre you replaying it?\u201dHe had just finished taking a shower so there was the faint smell of shower gel around him.Lin Yan looked down at the cup in his hand. \u201cYes, I\u2019m taking advantage of when my memory is still good to sort it out.\u201d\u201cDiscuss it?\u201dLin Yan looked at the expression on his face before turning to the side. \u201cCome in.\u201dThe corners of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth curved up in an imperceptible arc.After entering the room, Lin Yan casually pulled out a chair for Jing Yuanzhou to sit down. Then he sat back at the table.He clocked the mouse a few times and opened several documents on the computer desktop. \u201cI have watched all the solo games today. It isn\u2019t surprising that many of them have hidden their true skills in many ways. However, I have gone through it frame by frame and carefully dug out the details. It is obvious that these teams have improved a lot after the end of the secondary league, especially IBB and QU. They might be secondary league teams but several players have definitely reached the level of the professional league\u2026\u201dHis attitude when speaking like this was completely different from his casual tone during the day. His business-like manner and the look on his face added an indescribable feeling. It was like\u2026A sentence suddenly came to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mind. \u2018It is like there is a light on his body.\u2019Lin Yan\u2019s words became the only background sound in the room.\u201cStill, it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s only a matter of time before they are knocked out and sent home. It isn\u2019t a difficult task to fight them with the current strength of our team. I\u2019ll replay it, sort out my ideas and then I can formally formulate the tactical arrangements for the next elimination section.\u201dLin Yan spoke up to here before casually asking, \u201cAt present, these are my current results of the replay. What else can be added?\u201d\u201cIt is very detailed. I have nothing to say.\u201dLin Yan nodded and started to chase out the guest. \u201cOkay, if there is nothing else, go back early and rest. I need to watch the last few videos.\u201dHowever, there was no sound for a long time. Lin Yan looked back. In this way, he happened to meet Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s straightforward gaze. He was stunned for a moment before Lin Yan gradually made a playful look. \u201cCaptain Jing, what\u2019s the matter. You are looking at me this way. Is there something on my face?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled faintly. \u201cNothing. I just feel that a man who works hard is really the most attractive.\u201dLin Yan changed to a comfortable posture and leaned back in the chair. \u201cSuch words are so smooth and natural. Can I understand that you are deliberately pleasing me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was calm and honest. \u201cIf you think so then it doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem.\u201dLin Yan teased. \u201cDon\u2019t you think these words sound like quotes from a scumbag?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled from where he was sitting on his chair. \u201cOtherwise, how can I be worthy of the title of a \u2018one jiao scumbag\u2019 from you?\u201dThere was a small silence the moment the words were heard.Jing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOriginally, it was estimated that this matter was about to be forgotten. As a result, the pot was opened. Jing Yuanzhou also realized that the timing was wrong. He wanted to say something to restore the atmosphere of the conversation but Lin Yan was already chasing him out. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Good night.\u201dA few seconds later, Jing Yuanzhou was \u2018invited\u2019 out of the room. He stared at the closed door in front of him and was silent for a moment. Then he leaned against the wall and pulled out a pack of cigarettes from the pocket of his coat. Blame him for saying the wrong thing again.It was night and the surroundings were silent until the faint sound of footsteps came from the stairs.Bi Yaohua had slept in the car previously. After returning to his room, he woke up in a daze. At this time, he went downstairs to grab a bottle of Coke from the refrigerator and came up. He passed by the corner of the stairs when he saw a figure shrouded by smoke in the corridor.Combined with the dim lights, he couldn\u2019t help waking up completely. \u201cFuck, Captain, why aren\u2019t you sleeping in the middle of the night? What are you doing here?\u201d\u2019Jing Yuanzhou had just finished smoking a cigarette when he saw Bi Yaohua. He was silent for a moment before beckoning to him. \u201cBB, come here.\u201dBi Yaohua walked over with a puzzled face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked at him and couldn\u2019t help thinking of Lin Yan\u2019s opening remark on that day. \u201cIt is like this. I have a friend.\u201dBi Yaohua raised his eyebrow. \u201cEh?\u201d\u201cHe\u2026 accidentally upset someone.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou coughed and continued. \u201cI have no experience in this area so I can\u2019t help much. If it were you, how would you coax the person?\u201dBi Yaohua saw his captain\u2019s serious expression and thought about it seriously. \u201cIt is really hard to say. After all, I provoke many people. I have to know what the relationship is with the other person.\u201d\u201cA colleague?\u201dBi Yaohua smiled. \u201cIt is just this relationship so why coax him? Can you be colleagues for a lifetime? If he doesn\u2019t like me then he doesn\u2019t like me. Why coax him? I won\u2019t lose anything.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was silent for a moment before changing to another example. \u201cIf so, what if it is a girlfriend?\u201dBi Yaohua was taken aback and the expression on his face became serious. \u201cIn that case, this is really serious.\u201dThen he smiled again. \u201cHowever, I have a method that you can try.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked at Bi Yaohua. \u201cWhat method?\u201dBi Yaohua also stared back and declared seriously, \u201cKneel down.\u201dJing Yuanzhou paused while holding the cigarette butt. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFreestarThe more Bi Yaohua thought about it, the more he felt it was feasible. \u201cI might\u2019ve been single for 20 years but I have never missed out on watching TV dramas. Believe me, all explanations and arguments won\u2019t work. The simplest and roughest way is to kneel. Don\u2019t always think that there is gold under a man\u2019s knees. After you kneel, I promise that you will experience another world. I\u2019m really not lying\u2026\u201dJing Yuanzhou had a headache as he interrupted this person. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I asked the wrong person.\u201dHe didn\u2019t hear Bi Yaohua\u2019s reply as he turned to push open his door. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Good night.\u201dBi Yaohua watched the door close without any reluctance. He squeezed the Coke in his hand and took another sip. He scratched his face with some doubts and muttered softly, \u201cSpeaking of which\u2026 since when did Captain Jing have a girlfriend?\u201dAfter two days of editing, the first episode finally reached the official broadcasting time.There might\u2019ve been the live broadcast of the competition but it was the first time they were on TV like this. Everyone came to the huge screen in the lounge early in order to watch the show. The moment Gu Luo entered the door, he saw Bi Yaohua buried in the sofa and typing something. He asked curiously, \u201cBrother Trash Talk, what are you doing?\u201dBi Yaohua raised his eyes slightly. \u201cI\u2019m seeing how the fans are scolding me.\u201dGu Luo, \u201c???\u201dPutting aside everything else, he was really convinced this person was taking black fans as fans.Bi Yaohua had personally just finished a wave of combat. At this time, he enthusiastically waved to Gu Luo. \u201cLook at it, these people are really interesting.\u201dGu Luo was curious and immediately got closer. The contents of the phone screen immediately entered his eyes.[66666, this type of program is actually airing. BB, tell me the truth, is this program team empathizing with us and providing us with a new platform to scold you?][GH round trip preparation! I thought that a rich second generation could set up a decent team by throwing money. This was the result???]Freestar[I\u2019ve thought about the lines for you. If you win, you\u2019ll be the Awesome Trash Talk King. If you lose, you will be the strongest of a weak team. Apart from Titans, the rest can be scolded casually.][Speak directly. Titans was given 35 million. How much did you take?][I have been particularly confused recently. Do rich second generation people have the habit of throwing money to pick up trash?][The biggest trash king, BB ranks second. No one dares to rank first.][Isn\u2019t it time yet? Hurry up. Dad is already hungry and thirsty to see you being abused.]Gu Luo opened his mouth with difficulty. \u201c\u2026Where is it interesting?\u201dBi Yaohua shook his head. \u201cForget it. A little white rabbit like you wouldn\u2019t understand the fun of scolding.\u201dGu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2018I don\u2019t want to understand, thank you.\u2019Next to him, Jian Ye understood Gu Luo\u2019s feelings and patted him sympathetically on the shoulder. \u201cLeave him alone. Come into my arms, you\u2019ll be safe.\u201dGu Luo didn\u2019t hesitate. He turned around and sat next to Jian Ye. The others came in one after another. The last one was Lin Yan. The moment he walked in, the first episode of Burning Hot Assembly was updated on the video software.Luo Mo quickly selected it.The show started airing and the barrage frantically appeared. In the blink of an eye, the screen was dominated by the fans of each time. Among them, there was no doubt that GH\u2019s \u2018support method\u2019 was the most peculiar.In the midst of the full screen cheers, there was the controversial and unified slogan: [Did the Go Home team go home today?]Luo Mo saw this and frowned. He took into account the feelings of the players and couldn\u2019t help asking Lin Yan, \u201cShould I turn off the barrage?\u201dLin Yan raised an eyebrow slightly. \u201cNo need.\u201dFreestarThis was nothing. If their mentality was broken just because of this, how could they stand on the world stage in the future? Luo Mo opened his mouth like he wanted to speak but he didn\u2019t say anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then the first wave of twists and turns occurred.[Fuck fuck fuck, looking at these faces, why do I feel like I can\u2019t scold them?][You are scolding the soul and licking the beauty. There is nothing wrong. There isn\u2019t much to say.

Who would\u2019ve thought that in my lifetime, I would be stunned by an e-sports show\u2026]Gu Luo caught a glimpse of some messages praising his cuteness and his face was slightly red.Bi Yaohua saw himself on the TV screen and couldn\u2019t help fluffing up his hair a bit. \u201cHey, why do I feel that my look on that day is a bit too low-key? Remember to remind me to communicate more with the stylist the next time we record.\u201dChen Yushen stared silently.Jian Ye couldn\u2019t help complaining. \u201cYou are also catching up to the peacocks who spread open their tails? Yet you think you\u2019re low-key?\u201dBi Yaohua shook his head. \u201cI am the king of trash talk in Jianghu.

Sisters, wake up. Do you suddenly smell a CP?][Person above, you\u2019re not alone.]Lin Yan raised his eyebrow slightly when he saw the last line. Although it was soon overwhelmed by other barrage messages, he instinctively turned his head and happened to meet Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze. Lin Yan was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cLuo Mo, close the barrage.\u201d\u201cEh? Ah\u2026 yes!\u201dThe barrage was closed and the whole world became quiet. Only Bi Yaohua found it enjoyable to be scolded. As he watched the show, he used his mobile phone to scan online comments. From time to time, he would broadcast them live to his teammates.\u201cGloy, not bad. You\u2019ve gained a lot of mother fans!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t understand the aesthetics of the netizens now. Abyss\u2019 stinky face is so popular? Then should I take the indifferent route in the future?\u201d\u201cI know that many people are sorry that Titans and I didn\u2019t play. However, how can they infer that I\u2019m in a state of decline? How can I be an old player? I am only 20 years old. Is this old? That isn\u2019t what I\u2019ve said. This netizen really isn\u2019t good!\u201d\u201cGun Gun, do you know what they\u2019re saying about you? You are a King Kong male mommy. Hahahaha, so good and fitting!\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t want to talk to this person but he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cGet lost.\u201dBi Yaohua raised his eyes. \u201cIt is perfectly fine. Why are you scolding yourself?\u201dJian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dForget it. However, couldn\u2019t he hide?!FreestarAt this time, the classic scene of the first solo game was being played on the screen. Bi Yaohua didn\u2019t bother Jian Ye anymore and continued to happily give feedback, his entire body feeling comfortable. \u201cOh, this LAN has become very famous. A shooter vs. a sexy nanny. Today\u2019s blockbuster scene is booked!\u201dIn fact, it was more than famous. The response was far more enthusiastic than what Bi Yaohua said. Not long after this was aired, the netizens with fast hands quickly cut a video of this solo game. In the video, the sexy and enchanting healer support combined with the standard cool male appearance of Jian Ye made the video instantly become popular.This wave of operations made GH inexplicably hot. Many of the e-sports players who originally disdained to watch the show entered the pit and almost all of them laughed so much they had to support themselves using the wall.This was really magical!The sunspots were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the onlookers and had nowhere to vent so they went to the Weibo pages of the ZX club and LAN\u2019s private Weibo. They started to crazily show their fighting power.[WTG! Why is a shooter who can\u2019t beat the support still in the team? Is there too much rice stored at the ZX base?][ZX might be a sub-league team but did it pick up this type of shooter from the garbage heap?][Upstairs, don\u2019t insult the garbage heap. You are also a garbage collector. It is only after comparing with GH that I realized garbage can be divided into different categories.][Although the use of waste is now advocated, it is recyclable waste. Shouldn\u2019t you decompose this type of shooter?][Don\u2019t speak secretly. LAN has blown up!][No wonder why they can\u2019t even score in the secondary league. With this type of shooter, the base should be transformed into a vegetable garden!] (If they\u2019re calling someone a vegetable, it means they\u2019re calling them weak)By the time the first episode finished, everyone knew the situation on the Internet thanks to Bi Yaohua\u2019s retelling. They had to say, it was very exciting. Luo Mo turned off the playback software and quickly looked at Weibo. He saw that the popularity of several entries was rising.The first echelon was: #BB sitting on the bench#, #supportSOLO#, #support beasts shooter#, #GH shows its strength# and so on.The second echelon was: #GH coach\u2019s beauty#, #full face team#, #how many good CPS do you have#, #GH cult collection# and so on.There might be no shortage of sunspots jumping up and down in an attempt to drive the rhythm but it didn\u2019t affect the number of fans on the club\u2019s official Weibo page. The broadcast of the show and the popularity of the video caused the number of fans to soar.Luo Mo promptly contacted the person in charge of the Weibo page to take advantage of this opportunity to create a wave of popularity.\u201cThere is no need to push the entry about my appearance. Those of us behind the scenes don\u2019t need to be so high-profile. Traffic will be attracted to the players themselves.\u201d Lin Yan retreated very generously. He glanced at his phone and stood up from the sofa. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time. Prepare to continue training.\u201dThere were wails of mourning the moment his words were heard.Luo Mo took the opportunity to remind them. \u201cFrom tomorrow on, the program will arrange people to livestream you. Don\u2019t forget to cooperate and try to get up early.\u201dFreestarLin Yan raised his eyes and felt the expectant gazes around him. \u201cOkay, then I won\u2019t work you too hard today. I\u2019ll leave you some strength to perform tomorrow, okay?\u201dThe group cheered. \u201cCoach is the best!\u201dLin Yan let out a low laugh, opened the door and walked out. There was no one else in the corridor. He had only taken two steps when he heard the faint sound of footsteps behind him. The expression in Lin Yan\u2019s eyes changed slightly when he looked back and saw the person behind him.In the past two days, he and Jing Yuanzhou had rarely seen each other privately. If it was training then they trained. If it was time for the replay then they watched the replay. If it was a tactical discussion then they discussed tactics. They didn\u2019t mention the previous matters. It was presumably a false harmony.Lin Yan could feel that Jing Yuanzhou deliberately wanted to explain but on closer examination, no explanation was really needed. At that time, they didn\u2019t know each other. It was absolutely kind that Jing Yuanzhou would send him to the hotel when he was so drunk instead of throwing him to the side of the road. He couldn\u2019t say why he was so upset but he wasn\u2019t a person to care about such things. He would at most feel awkward for a few days and then he would probably be fine.In fact, he had even planned on buying Jing Yuanzhou a second-hand coat in a few days to pay him back. Now that he faced the other person\u2019s gaze, Lin Yan felt he had to be generous and he cleared his throat. \u201cIn fact, you don\u2019t need to\u2026\u201dHe hadn\u2019t finished when Jing Yuanzhou interrupted him. \u201cLend me your hand?\u201dLin Yan looked at this person suspiciously. He didn\u2019t know what medicine Jing Yuanzhou was selling but he still reached out and opened his palm. The next second, he saw Jing Yuanzhou put something in his hand. It was icy and cool. He looked down and saw that his hand was full of jiao coins. This type of currency had long gone out of use. It was unknown from where this person had obtained so many coins.Jing Yuanzhou noticed Lin Yan\u2019s inquiring gaze and said calmly, \u201cI hid it from you before. I was wrong. However, I really didn\u2019t mean to fool you. In any case, I am already a one jiao scumbag. I should take it to the end. Take these coins as my apology.\u201dLin Yan wondered, \u201cDo I look like someone who is short of money?\u201d\u201cYou definitely aren\u2019t lacking money but this money isn\u2019t for you to spend.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou stared directly at Lin Yan, the corners of his lips curved up in a smile. \u201cSince it is an apology, the money naturally has its proper usage. This is my promise to you. You can make a request using one of these coins and exchange it with me whenever you need it. There is no time limit.\u201dIt had to be said that this was a really \u2018conscience\u2019 usage. Lin Yan hadn\u2019t expected Jing Yuanzhou to play such a hand. He was a bit stunned and felt that his palm was burning up.He lowered his head and looked at his palm that was full of coins. He wanted to control it but the curve of his mouth went up uncontrollably. \u201cYou really want to play like this? Don\u2019t you know that you\u2019re making so many promises at once? Aren\u2019t you afraid of being squeezed dry by me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cI have already said it. I acknowledge it even if you squeeze me dry.\u201d\u201cSince you have done this, I won\u2019t be polite.\u201d Lin Yan wasn\u2019t a man who wouldn\u2019t take advantage. He placed the coins in his pocket and his mood was bright when he heard the clear clinking sounds.He couldn\u2019t help smiling at Jing Yuanzhou and let out a \u2018tut\u2019. \u201cCaptain Jing, you\u2019re so romantic. If I was a young girl, I might even have the desire to marry you. Holding back so many days to show off this coaxing trick, did you go online to search for tips to pick up girls?\u201dJing Yuanzhou cleared his throat under this gaze. \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dLin Yan raised his eyebrow without saying anything else. He said goodbye and turned to the training room to prepare for today\u2019s content.Jing Yuanzhou stood in place and didn\u2019t move. It wasn\u2019t until the figure disappeared around the corner that he silently took out his phone and emptied all the search records in the last two days without changing his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 27.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt had to be said that the response from the first episode of Burning Hot Assembly was more enthusiastic than expected. In just one day, it swept up almost the entire Weibo hot search. So when Jing Yuanzhou woke up the next day, he saw that the message notifications on his phone were about to be maxed out.Some people in the professional players chat group had pinged him. This old group who chatted and gossiped all year round rarely talked about topics related to e-sports. The players in this group were all active players of the league. Some had a good relationship while others barely said a few words to each other. Some occasionally grumbled and others stayed quiet.However, the transfer period had just ended and topics in the circle were somewhat sensitive during this time. Therefore, most people chose to be tactful and to lurk. The moment the avant-garde popular variety show was broadcast, someone took the lead to bring up the topic and the players who had been holding back for a long time naturally came out.Jing Yuanzhou took his phone and walked into the bathroom. He brushed his teeth while reading through the chat history in front of him.[The variety show that the league is doing this time is really good. At first, it was damaged but now it has blown up. It turned against the wind!][So did everyone see it?][Is this nonsense? Now if I don\u2019t watch the e-sports variety show then I won\u2019t understand the trends.][I watched it, I watched it yesterday! I have to say that the two of them are really outstanding @Luni @Titans.]Luni was suddenly cued and he also came out.Luni: [I just showed my face. What was so good about it?]Everyone responded: [As the official player representative, your face is our face!]Luni: [\u2026\u2026]Luni: [I\u2019m nothing. At best, it was just a personal signboard. It is better to ask the former pro directly. How bad is it to say trash on this occasion? @Titans]Jing Yuanzhou glanced casually and found that he had been @ many times. He couldn\u2019t help chuckling.The matter of his transfer had previously been circulated in the professional circle but no one had mentioned it in this group. They were all people who had been in the circle for many years and knew that some things were heartbreaking. They tacitly didn\u2019t come to sprinkle salt on the wound. Now that the matter of his transfer to GH had been settled and they saw he was in a good mood on the variety show, they took advantage of this time to tease him.Jing Yuanzhou read through the chat history and got a general idea. The mid-season hadn\u2019t started yet and the pros were clearly idle. No, there was so much leisure and good taste that they were starting to watch variety shows. However, this also showed how popular the e-sports variety show Burning Hot Assembly had become.Jing Yuanzhou wiped his face with a towel, casually picked up his phone and replied.Titans: [@Luni, I said it with feelings. It wasn\u2019t trash talk. Thank you.]Titans: [In addition, this seems to be a group for professional players? As a former professional player, I don\u2019t seem suitable for this group. I will leave first.]The group chat that was in full swing just now fell silent. The next second, it was completely covered with question marks.[It\u2019s over. Titans is angry. Luni, you\u2019re in trouble!][Why leave? If the annual best play isn\u2019t suitable to stay, how can these weaklings be mixed in?]Luni: [???]Before Luni could say anything else, he watched the chat group decrease by one person. At the same time, he was the administrator so he received notification that someone left the group. Damn, he really left? For a time, Luni couldn\u2019t pay attention to the player group that completely exploded. He quickly chased Jing Yuanzhou by sending a message.Luni: [What\u2019s wrong with you? I was just kidding!]Jing Yuanzhou had just walked out of his room. He took a look at it and replied: [It has nothing to do with you. This is originally a fact. I\u2019m not a professional player anymore.]Luni had a headache. [It doesn\u2019t need to be so simple! Didn\u2019t you say that GH will enter the professional league soon or later? Is it fun to join and leave?]Jing Yuanzhou: [It is fun. I will be GH.Titans when I\u2019m added again.]Luni wanted to say something so Jing Yuanzhou sent another one: [What do you want to do in the group? Inquire about our GH\u2019s tactical layout? I\u2019m not going to give you this opportunity before we even enter the professional league so you can develop coping strategies in advance.]Luni: [\u2026You\u2019re thinking too much.]The two newcomers of GH did perform well in the first episode of the show but this was just compared to a third-rate team like ZX in the secondary league. In the eyes of professional players like them, it wasn\u2019t enough to pay attention to.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t agree. [You will know later if I\u2019m thinking too much.]Luni saw that Jing Yuanzhou was determined and didn\u2019t say anything else about it. He casually exchanged a few words before ending the conversation. Jing Yuanzhou put his mobile phone in his pocket, went downstairs and through the corridor to Area A. He saw Lin Yan commanding a group of people as they busily arranged something.In order to better increase the popularity of the variety show, the program specifically arranged for staff to install cameras at the base. The major live broadcast platforms had opened live broadcast areas for all eight clubs, ready to show the daily live broadcasts at fixed times.Lin Yan asked the staff to arrange the cameras in the training room. They were set at all angles and there were no dead ends in 360 degrees, allowing the audience to switch at will. Lin Yan had just finished making arrangements when he turned around and saw Jing Yuanzhou standing not far away. He blinked before beckoning. \u201cTitans, come here.\u201dThe moment Jing Yuanzhou walked over, Lin Yan grabbed him with one hand and placed him upright in front of the camera. Then he gave a reminder. \u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dAfter that, Lin Yan turned around and ran to the staff not far away. He looked at the displayed picture up and down and was satisfied. \u201cThe quality of the image is good. The shot of our Titans is very handsome. It is okay.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was caught off guard and became a tool man again. He was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cI\u2019m going for a run first.\u201dLin Yan waved his hand without looking up. \u201cI won\u2019t bother to see you out.\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at this indifferent figure and couldn\u2019t help laughing slightly. He turned and walked out the door. Noon approached and the other members of the GH team woke up one after another. They were slightly surprised when they saw the newly decorated training room.FreestarBi Yaohua sighed. \u201cThis is a bit powerful\u2026\u2019Even the Trash Talk King thought so, let alone the others. Gu Luo had the thinnest skin. He saw these cameras and inevitably felt his entire body stiffen. This\u2026 how many people would be watching their daily training?Luo Mo flipped through the schedule next to him. \u201cI have confirmed it with the program. These cameras will be on three days a week and the time is in the afternoon from 1 o\u2019clock to 5 o\u2019clock. Therefore, everyone has some time to prepare for it.\u201dLin Yan added, \u201cIn order to match the program\u2019s effects, I will push all the training content originally scheduled for the afternoon to the evening. The afternoon time will be free. Once the time arrives, everyone will start a live broadcast by themselves. Lining up alone or as a pair is fine. It will also be included as the live broadcast duration that is included in the contract you signed.\u201dThen he noticed the state of several of them and clapped his hands. \u201cI know it will be a bit uncomfortable at first but this is something that must be overcome if you want to be a professional. Now it is just cameras arranged by the program. If it is hard to bear, what about the tens of thousands of people in the stadium in the future? Then it will be real spectators. You can\u2019t let it affect the performance of the match, right?\u201dGu Luo heard this and the expression on his face gradually became firmer. \u201cCoach, I will work hard!\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help smiling and rubbing this grandma grey hair. \u201cUhuh, Gloy is the best.\u201dJian Ye couldn\u2019t help coming up to him. \u201cCoach, am I good too?\u201dLin Yan placed a hand on his head and pushed him away a bit. \u201cYes, all the children in our family are good!\u201dThe club\u2019s auntie had prepared lunch at this time.FreestarEveryone gathered in the dining room to eat. Then they ran to the training room to make final preparations before the camera was officially activated.Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help showing a satisfied smile when he saw the players\u2019 enthusiastic attitudes. Suddenly, he felt someone patting him on the shoulder. He looked back and saw Jing Yuanzhou giving him a look and beckoning silently.Currently, Jing Yuanzhou was holding a mobile phone in his hand and it wasn\u2019t known who he was talking to. He led Lin Yan into the corridor while continuing to talk to the other person on the phone. \u201cAre you sure the team really has no training arrangements? Um\u2026 it\u2019s fine but I still need to ask the leader about this matter in advance.\u201dAt this point, the curve of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth was clear. He pulled the phone away and looked at Lin Yan. \u201cMini said he wants to come see our club. What do you think?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s thoughts were still stuck on the previous \u2018ask the leader\u2019. Then his mind returned. \u201cMini? The crybaby when I picked you up from the club?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s phone was still connected in a call and it wasn\u2019t very far away. Perhaps Lan Min heard this comment because a vague \u2018fuck\u2019 could be heard from the other end of the phone.Jing Yuanzhou laughed. \u201cYes, it\u2019s him. However, recently the base has either been training or live broadcasting. I can tell him to come next month if it is inconvenient.\u201dLin Yan\u2019s answer was extremely simple. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for next month! I think it is very convenient! It is better to choose a day than to delay. Otherwise, this afternoon will be fine.\u201dAfter all, Lan Min was the new side lane player who replaced Titans for BK. Now he wanted to come to GH Club\u2019s base as a guest?It could be imagined how big a storm it would cause. Don\u2019t say this. This type of thing could really only be done by Lin Yan. As for the intentions, it went without saying. Jing Yuanzhou instantly understood Lin Yan\u2019s thoughts. He pondered on it for a moment before relaying Lin Yan\u2019s original words.Lan Min had discovered Jing Yuanzhou leaving the group after he woke up and immediately called to ask about the situation. As for wanting to come to the GH Club, it was just a whim. However, just now, he clearly heard Lin Yan\u2019s evaluation. He blurted out, \u201cGood. Master, I will leave now. Wait for me!\u201d\u201cYes, see you later.\u201d\u2019He hung up the phone and looked back with a smile. \u201cTaking someone from the BK team to attract traffic. Coach Lin\u2019s calculations are really good.\u201dLin Yan raised his eyebrow but he also smiled. \u201cUsing the GH team to teach your little apprentice. Captain Jing\u2019s calculations are also really good.\u201dThe two of them stayed silently and tacitly smiled at each other. There was no reason for them to refuse the mutual benefits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 27.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHalf an hour later, everyone in GH was ready. At one point, all the cameras were officially turned on and the first daily live broadcast of Burning Hot Assembly officially began. Since each team had an independent live broadcast room, traffic was inevitably scattered. However, Titans\u2019s fans alone were enough to support the GH Club.In the fast-moving barrage, there were also many new variety show fans.[This is the first time I\u2019m watching a live broadcast like this. It feels quite interesting.][Ahhhh, I saw my husband! Ahh, this is simply making the program hot! I can happily watch it all afternoon!][None of these cameras have any filters, right? I just came to see the beauty. I\u2019m satisfied and licking the screen.][Hey, why play e-sports? You will just be scolded if you are weak. Isn\u2019t it good to change to a boy\u2019s group and debut?][Where is BBBBB. Let Dad see how you curse your teammates every day!][Wait, the Trash Talk King is on the computer interface\u2026 is this looking at us?]Perhaps Bi Yaohua had seen the last barrage. Bi Yaohua, who was facing the computer, suddenly turned around and looked at the camera behind him with a smile. \u201cYes, I just want to see how many people are chasing after me. I will try my best to be filial.\u201dThe live broadcast audience, \u201c???\u201dCalling out fans on the spot! The barrage was quickly filled with a series of ellipses and 666.Lin Yan was originally sitting on the sofa and watching the live broadcast room. He raised his eyebrows slightly behind the scenes. Then he walked behind Bi Yaohua with a magazine and hit him on the head. \u201cWhat are you playing at? Aren\u2019t you going to start the live broadcast soon?\u201dBi Yaohua sighed. \u201cAlas, yes\u2026\u201d[Hahahahaha, my god, did I see the Trash Talk King deflated?][Fuck, I know this person. He is GH\u2019s coach!][The coach looks good! Coach, don\u2019t leave. Let me take another look.]Lin Yan glanced down at the phone and happened to see the last message. His lips curved up slightly. He turned around and ruthlessly sat back down on the sofa next to the blind spot.Due to Lin Yan\u2019s reminder, everyone in GH opened the live broadcast room one after another. Only Jing Yuanzhou was still lining up alone with an indifferent look, causing the fans to be heartbroken. Still, in view of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s past where he never showed his face easily, the humble fans were already very content at seeing such a person in a non-competitive environment.After opening the client, Gu Luo skillfully invited Jian Ye and lined up as a pair. He still used his original live broadcast account. Before coming to GH, he had never shown his face during the live broadcast. Old fans only saw him again after he \u2018disappeared\u2019 for a while and it was also after the broadcast of Burning Hot Assembly.At this time, facing such a harmless face, the group of mother fans could only scream with love. After all, their cub was so cute!Unlike Bi Yaohua, Gu Luo didn\u2019t dare read the crazy fan comments. In the end, the fans made a fuss in the live broadcast room. After glancing at the scrolling content on the interface, he turned off the barrage in an embarrassed manner and focused on scoring with Jian Ye.On the other side, Chen Yushen didn\u2019t speak from beginning to end. However, as long as someone paid a bit of attention, they would find that his stinky face was tense and this made his expression look more depressed than ever.FreestarLin Yan saw everything and couldn\u2019t help shaking his head secretly. Hey, this wouldn\u2019t work. They were still too tender! Apart from the old hand BB, everyone else had to work harder. They still lacked the shameless values that e-sports players should have.He thought of this and clicked on the memo in his mobile phone. He added one more note carefully: strengthen expression management.Everyone\u2019s live broadcast progressed. Apart from the keyboard and mouse clicking sounds in the training room, only Bi Yaohua\u2019s lazy voice was heard. He kept interacting with the fans in the live broadcast room and became the only background sound.\u201cYes, I\u2019m going to play the Flame Witch. Why does a shooter play a mid-lane hero? So if you work in a funeral home, will you never go to the hospital in your life?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with playing a side account? Do you think a side account is easy to play? A good situation is at least 5V5. If my side account accidentally plays 1V9 then the difficulty will increase.\u201d\u201cForget lining up as a pair. As the Trash Talk King, I love freedom. Lining up as a pair restricts my play.\u201d\u201cYes, I like to trash talk. How else do you think I got my name? If you didn\u2019t take the lead when going out then you should go back and look for it. If you have taken it then it is my fault. I was wrong. I can\u2019t expect sunspots to have brains.\u201d\u201cI won again. The invincible life is really as lonely as water. Tut.\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s mouth deservedly made him the owner of the most popular live broadcast room in GH.Many viewers originally saw the program\u2019s promotion and entered. Then they discovered that the team members had started live broadcasts and jumped back and forth between several live broadcast rooms.It had to be said that compared to their initial guess that staring at a screen would be boring, it was indeed extremely happy.Obviously, the outside world\u2019s overall impression of GH was better than the beginning thanks to the broadcast of the first episode. The barrage on the public screen was actually harmonious for a time.After all, most of the fans were still rushing for the faces of the players. They didn\u2019t expect the live streaming to be exciting. They just wanted to lick the beauty on the camera. Then gradually, someone started to notice more details. As the players started to do the ranking matches one after another, they found that the winning percentage of the GH team seemed a bit too high.After realizing it, they came back to their senses. The people who were interested reviewed the results one by one and discovered that it didn\u2019t matter if it was as a single or a pair. These people had actually won several games in a row. Putting aside Bi Yaohua\u2019s side account, these other young people were actually within the top 100 of the ranking competition![It is possible that the Burning Hot game has opened a channel for GH? Is there such an easy way to play in the rankings?][The person who spoke of the channel must be blind. Is it possible to get the MVP from this method?][Wasn\u2019t this a vase team? This is a bit strong\u2026.][Where did GH\u2019s management get these people? Amazing!]Freestar[Don\u2019t boast. The strength is okay at best. Is it weird for professional players to get this type of winning streak in the rankings?][Hehe, at best, it is the quasi-professional level. You have never seen the market.][The person above has no brains, right? If you can speak so well then you do it!]The barrage was constantly refreshing. Compared to the number of viewers in the live broadcast rooms of other teams, the number of fans in the GH team\u2019s live broadcast room was increasing at a speed visible to the naked eye.FreestarLin Yan looked at the content on the barrage with satisfaction and raised his eyebrow. This was why he was never worried about how the team would be accepted. After all, in the field of e-sports, strength was always the most convincing existence. In addition, this was just the beginning.Lin Yan raised his head to watch the people who were seriously playing the rankings. A smile flashed in his eyes. Then he glanced over just in time to see Jing Yuanzhou standing up and walking outside the lounge.He looked down at the time on the phone and understood it instantly. Their channel to attract attention had arrived.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s sudden departure caused the already quick barrage to surge again in an instant. As everyone was speculating about his whereabouts, Jing Yuanzhou came back again. This time, there was a tall figure behind him.Barrage: [???]The cap on his head was largely blocking his face but the more they looked, the more familiar he felt. At this moment, Lan Min took off the huge hat on his head, revealing a complicated expression.Jing Yuanzhou had already told him on the way into the base about the live broadcast arrangement of the program. At that moment, he finally understood why the person who abducted his master wanted him here today.He had some complaints. He always felt that Master was particularly partial to that person. Master knew what was going on but didn\u2019t say anything in advance. He let Lan Min come over.Lan Min didn\u2019t need to look to know that the barrage in the live broadcast room was probably completely crazy. After all, it was well known that he had replaced Titans in the BK team. During this period, there was no shortage of people who pushed Titans\u2019 departure on his head. Now he appeared in the GH base that Titans transferred to and the topic exploded in minutes.He thought up to here and couldn\u2019t help having a small headache. He would\u2019ve come another day if he had known. He did get the approval of Captain Ku to come here today but if he made too much noise, it was estimated that he would inevitably suffer from training after going back.Lan Min became more annoyed as he thought about it. He received the cup of tea from Lin Yan and inevitably looked hostile. \u201cThank you.\u201dFreestarLin Yan was very enthusiastic. \u201cMini, welcome to GH. Everyone is a bit busy now. Why don\u2019t you wait a minute and I\u2019ll let someone come over to play with you?\u201d\u201cPlay?\u201d Lan Min looked up and finally showed a smile. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe was indeed quite looking forward to the strength of Master\u2019s current teammates.Lin Yan nodded. \u201cYes, who do you want to play with? Gun? Don\u2019t think of him as just a support. He played a solo game before and the effect was very good.\u201dThe corners of Lan Min\u2019s mouth shook slightly.FreestarDon\u2019t bully him just because he was young and wouldn\u2019t understand!Like other professional players, he had watched the first episode of the show and naturally happened to see Gun playing in the solo game. The sexy and enchanting figure flashed through his mind. He immediately replied without hesitation. \u201cI won\u2019t fight with the support.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like the support, how about the mid-laner?\u201d Lin Yan thought about it and didn\u2019t wait for Lan Min to agree before refusing it. \u201cForget it, Gloy is livestreaming as a pair and it isn\u2019t good to interrupt it suddenly. In any case, there will be many opportunities for you to learn from them in the future. Today is a special situation. If you don\u2019t dislike it, would you like to practice with me?\u201dUpon hearing the last sentence, Jing Yuanzhou looked up in surprise. He met Lin Yan\u2019s smiling gaze and his face cleared up when he understood the situation.Lan Min just wanted to express his disgust when he heard Jing Yuanzhou speak. \u201cI think it is good.\u201dLan Min looked back. \u201cMaster, isn\u2019t he the coach?\u201d\u201cIt is fine for the coach to train with you.\u201dLin Yan had already opened a computer for Lan Min in the blink of an eye. He pulled a chair over to sit down and casually asked, \u201cMini, what hero are you best at? We will use the same hero to face each other. This way, the entertainment factor will be stronger.\u201dIf both parties used the same hero then this tested the person\u2019s understanding of the hero. Now Lin Yan asked Lan Min to choose the hero he was best at. There was an arrogant tone of \u2018I will beat you even if you use the hero you are best at.\u2019Lan Min was young and energetic. He heard this and cursed in his heart. He didn\u2019t hesitate and sat down in front of the computer. \u201cDon\u2019t regret it!\u201dHe was a professional player. Who was this person looking down on?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 28.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe entire live broadcast room had already exploded from the moment Lan Min appeared in the camera. Lan Min was a player of the BK Club after all. Given the special relationship between Jing Yuanzhou and the BK Club in the past, it was obvious who invited him to the club today.Before this, many Titans fans actually had a poor impression of Lan Min who had replaced their player.However, the news of Lan Min\u2019s promotion to an official player was announced after Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s transfer and it was hard for them to say anything. It was only after netizens dug up the fact that Jing Yuanzhou had no public interaction with BK-related personnel after his transfer that people speculated on the truth behind this sudden transfer.It was inevitable that they would think in the direction of a conflict within the club.Judging by Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s attitude of personally inviting Lan Min to the GH Club today, the relationship between the new and old side lane player of the BK Club didn\u2019t seem as bad as outsiders imagined.[Hey, this is BK\u2019s Mini, right? I saw him in the promotional photos.][I thought Titans and the people from BK would die of old age before contacting each other. Looking at this, it seems that their relationship is good.][A Titans fan is in tears. Originally, they were supposed to be teammates.][Isn\u2019t this show too much? Is it a script arrangement for hype?][Wait, why is Mini sitting in front of the computer? Did he come all the way to GH to play the game?][Or did he come here to ask Titans for guidance? After all, the BK team\u2019s tactics have always been around the side lane. How many newcomers would find it hard when they just arrived?][However, Titans didn\u2019t sit down\u2026 looking at the other side, isn\u2019t it GH\u2019s coach who turned on the computer?]Everyone\u2019s attention was drawn by the words in the barrage.On the other side, Lin Yan had already adjusted the operating equipment. He turned his head to the side and he asked Lan Min over the two computer screens. \u201cHow is your preparation? Is the equipment at our base easy to use?\u201dLan Min had arrived empty-handed and hadn\u2019t brought his own peripherals. He could only use GH\u2019s equipment. He heard the words and responded with a sullen expression. \u201cYes, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\u2019Lin Yan smiled silently. \u201cThat\u2019s good. If you log in and go to your friends list, I just added you.\u201dLan Min lowered his head. Sure enough, a friend request had popped up. He clicked on it and the ID \u2018Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess\u2019 appeared in the centre of the screen.Lan Min, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter becoming friends, Lin Yan created a custom solo room and sent an invitation. Once the two sides were ready, they would officially enter the selection process.Lin Yan didn\u2019t forget to remind him, \u201cChoose it. I am the same as you.\u201dLan Min couldn\u2019t help gritting his teeth when he heard this and he directly locked onto the abyss shadow, Griffin. Lin Yan raised his eyebrow and locked onto the same hero. Then he looked at Jing Yuanzhou next to him with a smile.Everyone knew that Abyss Shadow Griffin was one of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s many famous heroes. Lan Min had always been a loyal fan of Jing Yuanzhou. It wasn\u2019t surprising that he liked to use the same hero. Taking it out at this time was also declaring his orthodox apprentice status.Neither of them were broadcasting live and the audience could only see through the rear camera lens. They struggled to make out the outline on the computer screen.][These two people, are they playing solo?][Fuck, I really want to watch it. Asking for one of them to broadcast live ahhhhh!][Mini selected Griffin right from the start? Laughing to death. Titans is still next to him. Isn\u2019t this displaying one\u2019s slight skill before an expert?][The coach opposite him seems to have taken Griffin as well.][What\u2019s the situation? Once you enter the GH door, Titans per capita?]Lin Yan could guess the general content of the barrage without looking. He adjusted his talents and lazily put on the headphones that had been hanging around his neck. He actually felt good about wearing headphones as long as he wasn\u2019t in the team voice channel. It was just that in most cases, he still didn\u2019t like to use it often.Although Lan Min on the opposite side hadn\u2019t formally experienced a severe beating in the professional league, he was the person who was taught by Jing Yuanzhou after all. Putting on the headphones could be considered a sign of Lin Yan\u2019s serious attitude.Jing Yuanzhou noticed Lin Yan\u2019s actions and something deep flashed in his eyes. He didn\u2019t say anything else and gently patted Lan Min on the shoulder. \u201cCommunicate with Coach Lin.\u201dAfter that, he didn\u2019t choose to stay and watch their game. He returned to his original position. Lan Min sent a wronged look to his back and pursed his lips. He took out Griffin in this game when the idea of blowing up Lin Yan.The game started and he immediately withdrew his other thoughts. He quickly bought an outfit and came online. First, he killed a few soldiers. Then he glanced at Lin Yan\u2019s position and suddenly rushed up.It had to be said that Lan Min\u2019s Griffin really contained the essence of Jing Yuanzhou. He was decisive when he should be decisive. His direct operation didn\u2019t give the other person a chance. Unfortunately, the man opposite him was Lin Yan.After a short wave of confrontation, it was Lan Min\u2019s Griffin who had low blood. He had to hide under the defensive tower in an embarrassed manner. On the other side, Lin Yan had comfortably eaten into the soldiers line. At this time, he was like an overbearing barrier in the middle of the road. He completely cut off all opportunities for Lan Min to kill the soldiers.Lan Min couldn\u2019t understand it. Obviously, he had taken the lead in grasping the initiative. Why did reality and his expectations have such opposite endings? However, their current state was too far apart. Lin Yan deliberately cut off his development paths and he had no way.Lan Min couldn\u2019t do anything. He could only unwillingly go back to the city to recover. It was just that Lin Yan was left alone with the soldiers. After such an operation, a large distance opened up between both sides.Lan Min no longer had any opportunities when he came back to fight. He soon discovered that no matter what he did, Lin Yan always seemed to be able to make judgments in advance. In this way, he was played on this person\u2019s palms and was completely crushed to death.[Defeat!]Four minutes later, Lan Min looked at the failure subtitle on the screen and was obviously a bit confused.FreestarAt present, he was indeed not a top player in the professional league but based on strength alone, he was definitely in the upper ladder. Yet he was easily rubbed into the ground by the coach of a small club?Lin Yan took off his headphones and looked over with a smile. Lan Min presumably felt this gaze and his lips pressed together tightly. He quickly returned to the custom room again. \u201cCome again!\u201dLin Yan smiled again and entered the next game. This time, Lan Min chose Moon Shadow Guardian Horace, another one of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s famous heroes. Unlike the previous game, he didn\u2019t choose to take action rashly. He carefully killed the soldiers and tried to find opportunities after entering a period of high economy.He didn\u2019t expect that Lin Yan, who moved cautiously in the last round, would play very aggressively in this round.The moment they met, Lin Yan forced him back to the resurrection spring within a minute and a half. By the time he was resurrected, he had already been crushed when it came to hero level. Later, history repeated and he was completely crushed\u2026Lan Min\u2019s voice was hoarse. \u201cCome again!\u201dBefore he knew it, half an hour had passed. One by one, the side-lane heroes went out on the field like lanterns and were violently beaten, entering the corpse canyon.Defeat, defeat, defeat\u2026The cold and ruthless system sound entered Lan Min\u2019s ears again and again. Even the audience of the live broadcast stared at the computer screen and couldn\u2019t recover for a long time.[So Mini hasn\u2019t won a game?][No way! Isn\u2019t his opponent the coach of GH? Why can\u2019t he win?][Based on this strength, can he really replace Titans?][I\u2019ve seen him play before. He\u2019s pretty strong. He isn\u2019t so weak!][Or is it that GH\u2019s coach is too strong, not that Mini is too weak?][Come on, if he was really strong then he would be a player long ago. Who would like to be a coach?]Freestar[No matter what, I just want to say that GH\u2019s coach is reaaaaaally handsome!!!]Lan Min couldn\u2019t see the barrage. He just saw the repeated defeats and his hand on the mouse couldn\u2019t help shaking. This man was so strong! It was different from the opponents he encountered in previous training games. This person was so powerful it instinctively made him feel he couldn\u2019t win. The last time he felt this way was when he faced his master Jing Yuanzhou not long after entering BK.Lan Min thought up to here and couldn\u2019t help blinking in order to control the tears welling in his eyes. To be honest, he had never been so cruelly beaten since he grew up. He even used the heroes he was most proud of! This strong sense of despair and shame simply destroyed his self-esteem.Lin Yan waited a while but Lan Min didn\u2019t enter the preparation stage again. Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help looking over. He saw the teenager\u2019s head drooping. The scattered hair covered the expression on his face. Although he tried his best to restrain it, Lin Yan could see the faint shaking of his shoulders.Lin Yan glanced at the camera behind him and thoughtfully lowered his voice. \u201cAre you crying from the abuse?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t good to mention it. Lan Min angrily raised a pair of vaguely red eyes. \u201cWho said I was crying?!\u201dLin Yan looked at the teenager whose ears were drooping like a rabbit\u2019s and could only make a sound. \u201cOh\u2026\u201dThis person wasn\u2019t crying but it was coming soon. It had to be admitted that this child\u2019s tear glands were indeed somewhat developed. In a certain way, he had some face and self-esteem. He just didn\u2019t know if this talent was a good thing in e-sports. For example, every time he lost a game, he could cry to the interview camera. It was actually pretty good to sell misery. Unfortunately, their GH didn\u2019t have this talent.Lin Yan thought up to here and felt a bit embarrassed. He glanced at the phone and felt it was almost time. He suddenly suggested to Lan Min, \u201cI was using the heroes you were good at. Now shouldn\u2019t you use my heroes?\u201dLan Min\u2019s mentality had experienced a series of blows and it had basically collapsed. His first reaction was to turn and leave. Then he thought about how Jing Yuanzhou was here and stubbornly sniffed. He hummed with a slightly nasal sound. \u201cOkay, you choose.\u201dThis behaviour of fighting while crying fell into Lin Yan\u2019s eyes and made him a bit happy. A smile appeared on his face. \u201cThen let\u2019s use the plague revolutionary? Can you do it?\u201dLan Min had no thoughts at all and just instinctively replied, \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026\u201dThen once the game officially started, he managed to recover his fighting spirit. This was the first lesson that Jing Yuanzhou taught him in e-sports. It wasn\u2019t terrible to lose. The terrible thing was to forget that he was still standing on the field.As a professional player, he had to stand and fight even if he died!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 28.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLan Min repeatedly recited \u2018I am a professional player\u2019 in his heart several times. He held back his tears and the operation of his hands became sharper. Lin Yan noticed the other person\u2019s adjusted state and approval imperceptibly flashed in his eyes.Before he knew it, three minutes had passed since the game started. The two sides have several waves of fights but their health was basically maintained. Lan Min thought he would be even more miserable when using the hero that Lin Yan was good at. He didn\u2019t expect for the feeling in his hand to be good. As time progressed, his frustrated expression somewhat brightened.Unfortunately, he still failed to beat Lin Yan.[Defeat!]The two of them returned to the room again and Lin Yan chose another side lane hero. \u201cThis time, use doomsday guard.\u201dLan Min lasted longer this time against Lin Yan. In the blink of an eye, he had played several more games in a row. Later, Lin Yan didn\u2019t even bother to change heroes. He directly used the same hero to repeatedly fight with Lan MinSeveral consecutive games passed and Lan Min gradually improved. It went from being completely suppressed at the beginning to a slight improvement. Then at the end, it was very difficult but he managed to gain victories against Lin Yan.[Ohhh, I feel bittersweet. Mini is finally winning.][Is this rapid growth? He seems to have played in a more awesome manner later.][Who knows? At such a long distance, I can\u2019t see how they are playing.][In any case, there must be something extraordinary if BK let him take over from Titans. From now on, I will watch BK\u2019s performance on the field.][Hahaha, I think he has been abused so many times in the beginning that he finally overcame it later on. Why do I feel the gratification of an old mother?][What else can I say? Just\u2026 I will cheer for him in the future.]Lin Yan saw the barrage on his phone. Then he noticed Lan Min returning to the custom room but he didn\u2019t continue. \u201cIt is almost time. We will end it here today.\u201dIt was exactly 5 o\u2019clock. The moment he spoke, the program\u2019s staff outside the training room poured in and turned off the live broadcast equipment. The first day of GH\u2019s daily live broadcast special program came to a successful conclusion.Among the busy figures, Lan Min was still sitting there without getting up. A long time passed before he raised his head and stared at Lin Yan. \u201cI-I have something to say to you.\u201dHe had clearly won a few times in the end but the boy\u2019s eyes were redder than they were during the previous kneeling period.Lin Yan looked around and waved to him. \u201cGo outside and say it.\u201dLan Min followed Lin Yan out into the corridor. The moment they got away from the busy crowd, he asked while emphasizing every syllable. \u201cTell me the truth\u2026 the last few games, did you deliberately let me win?\u201dHe had a strange feeling during the game just now. Due to this, the subsequent victory didn\u2019t bring much joy. He had sat there alone and became more and more frustrated. He originally thought Lin Yan would be tactful about this type of thing. He didn\u2019t expect Lin Yan to cleanly confess it after hearing the question. \u201cOh, I thought I acted well but you discovered it?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLan Min\u2019s red eyes became a bit wet but he still endured the feeling of grievance in his heart. He asked stubbornly, \u201cWhy?\u201dLin Yan looked at him strangely. \u201cWhy? We are broadcasting live today! I greeted you as a guest. How can I completely smash you at our base? You have been a hot topic recently. Aren\u2019t you going to mix in the e-sports circle? The moment your BK people receive the news, I\u2019m afraid they will collectively come to kill me!\u201dThis was a fact. The first reason he called Lan Min here was to grab some traffic. Second, it was to ease the hatred value that had risen due to him taking Jing Yuanzhou. It wasn\u2019t to let the netizens scold him more ruthlessly.Lan Min, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt might be true but the thought that his hard-earned victory was actually his opponent deliberately throwing the game made his shaky self-esteem finally shatter. In the end, Lan Min couldn\u2019t control his expression. his face was blank but sorrow surged in his chest and the tears finally fell.Unfortunately, Lin Yan had never been sympathetic.He sighed at the sight of the tearful person in front of him and told Lan Min in an expressionless manner, \u201cI said you were a crybaby previously. You still don\u2019t acknowledge it? In fact, it is normal that you can\u2019t beat me with your current ability. You should remember how you lost just now. To be honest, you shouldn\u2019t play the side lane like this. As far as your style of play is concerned, you will be hammered the moment you meet a real master.\u201dLan Min didn\u2019t bother to care about the ridicule in Lin Yan\u2019s words. He cried and vented a bit. Then he wiped the tears off his face and gritted his teeth. \u201cWho said\u2026 who said that the side lane isn\u2019t played like this? I\u2026 I used\u2026 obviously, obviously Titans\u2019 style of play!\u201dLin Yan glanced at this little boy\u2019s pitiful appearance and sneered. \u201cOh, so you know that this isn\u2019t your own style of play?\u201dThe words entered his ears and stunned Lan Min.He heard Lin Yan say without hesitation, \u201cYou should\u2019ve discovered it just now. The heroes I chose later on are actually more suitable for you. Players who can gain a high status in the field of e-sports, how can they be easily replaced? The formation of personal style is slowly honed through thousands of games. Therefore, Titans can be your idol but he can\u2019t be the future you. Is it hard to understand this type of truth?\u201dLan Min suddenly realized something and didn\u2019t speak for a long time. Was it intentional that this person repeatedly used the same hero to fight against him in the end? Did he really choose the wrong direction previously?Lan Min\u2019s tears burst out and he kept wiping at them with his sleeves. His sleeves were almost completely soaked and he couldn\u2019t help asking a final question. \u201cIn other words, the heroes you took out later aren\u2019t what you are good at?\u201dLin Yan blinked when he heard these words and smiled. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dLan Min, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan saw a new wave of tears gushing out and suddenly remembered something. \u201cRight, can you go back and help me ask the current BK captain something?Lan Min\u2019s voice was choked up. \u201cAsk\u2026 ask what?\u201d\u201cAsk him if we can make an appointment for a training match or something.\u201dThis sentence made the last trace of Lan Min\u2019s self-esteem that had been built up through self-deception to shatter. Sure enough, this person only cared about his seniors. As for himself, there was no sense of existence at all! It was just like the words of the outside world. With his current strength, he was indeed not qualified to take his Master\u2019s place at all!All the pressure accumulated in his heart during this period of time seemed to be touched by something and he completely collapsed.Lin Yan didn\u2019t get the answer he wanted. Before he could repeat the question, he saw Lan Min crouching directly on the ground and crying. He could only scratch the side of his face innocently.\u201cJust cry but don\u2019t forget to ask for me.\u201d His tone was calm like he wasn\u2019t the one who broke down this person. \u201cI am going to work now so I won\u2019t send you off. You can cry here first. Later, once you finish crying, go to the door and find the driver for our club. He will drive you back to BK.\u201dAll that was left was the sobbing sound of the teenager filled with great grievances. Lin Yan ignored the sobbing teenager and immediately turned to the lounge. The moment he passed the corner, he saw the man leaning against the door. Jing Yuanzhou had listened to the content of the conversation between the two people. At this time, he sincerely told Lin Yan, \u201cThank you.\u201dLin Yan smiled faintly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dLan Min crouched in the corner and cried for a long time until he was almost breathless.In fact, he was a person who could stand abuse. It was just that during this period of time, the topic of BK\u2019s future had always pressed on his body like an invisible hand locked around his throat. It brought a tight feeling of suffocation to his originally ordinary life. He didn\u2019t tell anyone about this feeling and just digested it silently. Even so, it inevitably left deep traces in his heart.Lin Yan\u2019s beating had actually tore a hole in his heart. Now these grievances were completely vented out here. He wasn\u2019t aware it would burst out like this. Even Lan Min was shocked when it burst out. He had never cried like this before!His eyes were almost swollen into walnuts when he raised his head after he finished crying. He took out his phone and looked at himself with the camera. The person in the lens was like an aggrieved, red-eyed rabbit.Lan Min felt a bit ashamed and couldn\u2019t help holding his forehead. He was about to leave while no one was paying attention to him. Then he turned around and happened to meet the eyes of the person behind him.Both of them were stunned. Gu Luo had previously noticed the movements here. As the lucky person who had received the \u2018meeting gift\u2019 from his coach, it could be said that he really understood this uncomfortable feeling of wanting to cry. At this time, he was holding a tissue in his hand. He froze for a moment before handing it over. \u201cWipe your tears?\u201dLan Min hadn\u2019t felt it when he was crying previously but now his face turned red. He immediately grabbed it and wiped his face. \u201cThank you\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you want to go back to BK? I know where the base\u2019s car is. Shall I take you there?\u201dLan Min couldn\u2019t wait to disappear and the expression on his face became even more strained. \u201cNo, I can go by himself.\u201dGu Luo noticed the other person\u2019s embarrassment and the first reaction was to be surprised that he actually met someone with a thinner skin than him. Then he thought about it and copied the tone that Lin Yan usually used to encourage them. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be embarrassed. In fact, you look\u2026 very cute.\u201dLan Min, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dDamn?!Lan Min\u2019s face was still a bit red when he got in the car to return to the BK Club. Fortunately, the cap on his head was big enough. If he pressed down the brim then it almost completely covered his red eyes.His phone vibrated. It was a message from Ku Tianlu: [I say, what\u2019s going on with you? Didn\u2019t you go to GH to see the scenery? Why are you on the hot search (Photo)]In the photo, there were entries such as #Mini appears at GH#, #Relationship between Titans and BK#, #GH\u2019s coach teaching BK\u2019s player# and #Mini was abused and cried# that were particularly eye-catching.FreestarLan Min rubbed his temples. [Captain, I was wrong\u2026 These things, I will explain to you when I return.]Ku Tianlu also seemed to have a headache. [Don\u2019t explain to me, you should explain to the public relations department! I think they\u2019re about to kill with swords!]Lan Min couldn\u2019t help laughing at such a description. Then he remembered the words that Lin Yan repeatedly emphasized. [Oh yes, Captain.

This time, you suddenly thought of asking Mini to go to the GH base. I should\u2019ve been told about it, right?\u201d\u201cOh, there have been many rumours about your transfer. The old fans don\u2019t know about management so they could only scold Mini, the newcomer who replaced you. That kid Mini is the real deal too. It might be annoying when he keeps crying but after all, he is the one you chose. The stubbornness in his bones is the same. He didn\u2019t cry from beginning to end from the heavy pressure.\u201d\u201cYou know he is under a lot of pressure yet you didn\u2019t think of a way to handle it?\u201d\u201cI thought about it! How do you know I didn\u2019t think about it!\u201d Ku Tianlu was wronged for a moment. \u201cIn fact, I thought about asking you to go back to BK\u2019s base and then pretending to pass by someone\u2019s live broadcast camera accidentally. This can be regarded as letting the outside world know about the relationship between you and the team members. In other words, simply let Mini pair up with you for a few games when the live broadcast is on and won\u2019t public opinion on the Internet be more moderate towards him?\u201dKu Tianlu sighed. \u201cThe problem is that Mini, the person involved, is reluctant! He said that you have left the club and we shouldn\u2019t continue to bother you about BK\u2019s affairs. Look at what a filial little apprentice you have. I\u2019m so mad\u2026 cough, moved to tears by him!\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled silently. \u201cI\u2019ve always been moved by him.\u201d\u201cYou will be moved? Moved to let an outsider abuse him like this?\u201d On the other end, Ku Tianlu rolled his eyes. \u201cHe went to the GH base to see his Master in the afternoon. He was so happy. Then he was hammered on the live broadcast and cried until his eyes were swollen. Oh, this little pitiful look, don\u2019t you want to coax him a bit? I always get a feeling similar to \u2018my father abandoned me when he found a stepmother for me.\u2019\u201dJing Yuanzhou was unmoved. \u201cI wanted to take this opportunity to let him step out of my influence. It would be really counterproductive if I come forward at this time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true! I heard Mini say that he is finally willing to try a different style of play. The coaches of the club tried hard to persuade him for so long yet he didn\u2019t listen to them at all. Now seeing him wake up, they thought the heavens were moved from seeing them fast and pray to Buddha. They were so happy they almost cried!\u201dKu Tianlu spoke up to here. He thought of Lan Min\u2019s experience at the GH base in the afternoon and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cBy the way, is the coach of GH really that strong?\u201dJing Yuanzhou nodded. \u201cYes, he is very strong.\u201dKu Tianlu never doubted Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes but he found it strange. \u201cIf he is so strong then why\u2026\u201dJing Yuanzhou knew what Ku Tianlu was asking and interrupted him. \u201cEveryone has their own choices.\u201dKu Tianlu keenly sensed that the content of this conversation was unpleasant so he cleared his throat and brought the topic back to the key part of today\u2019s call. \u201cSpeaking of which, if you want to make an appointment for a training match then why not ask me directly? Do you still need Mini to pass it on? Don\u2019t tell me that you can\u2019t open your mouth. Captain Jing, we have known each other for so many years. Surely our relationship won\u2019t become stiff because of the stupid management, right?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think about it. I just found out about the training game. It\u2019s Coach Lin\u2019s meaning.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou replied while unknowingly glancing in the direction of the door. It felt like his gaze was passing through the door into the room on the opposite side of the corridor.In fact, he could probably guess why Lin Yan didn\u2019t let him make an appointment with BK.He might have no grievances with his old comrades but after all, there was something wrong with the BK management team. As long as he opened his mouth, Ku Tianlu certainly wouldn\u2019t refuse. It might be called brotherhood but in a way, he was still accepting the other person\u2019s affection. Lin Yan didn\u2019t want Jing Yuanzhou to owe the BK Club anything.Jing Yuanzhou thought up to here and couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly. Once this person was considerate then he was really considerate.Ku Tianlu couldn\u2019t see Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s expression on the other side of the phone and he asked, \u201cSo what do you mean? Do you want to play? We are currently in the offseason and have a lot of time, but the GH team is just established. Aren\u2019t you afraid it will be counterproductive if you use such a ruthless start?\u201dJing Yuanzhou certainly understood Ku Tianlu\u2019s meaning.E-sports had always been cruel. There were countless new teams that were completely overwhelmed every year because of the overwhelming burden. Judging by the current situation, GH was still a long distance from BK.However, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s answer wasn\u2019t hesitant. \u201cSince he wants to fight, there must be a reason.\u201dKu Tianlu heard a touch of unprecedented trust in such plain words and was choked up for a moment. Then he couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cThat\u2026 Captain Jing, tell me the truth. Do you really like that rich second generation?\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t speak for a while. It was such a rare silence that Ku Tianlu couldn\u2019t help scratching his head. There weren\u2019t many people who knew Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s sexual orientation but the former vice-captain happened to be one of them.It was precisely because he knew the difficulty of this type of relationship that he couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cI originally thought that you chose to go to GH because you could play for at least several more years compared to other clubs. It was inevitable to feel a bit of pity. Now it seems\u2026 what career? You are actually chasing after your partner!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help expressing his extreme affirmation, \u201cI understand it after saying this. A career is important but if you can take off your single status then it is worth it! It is really worth it!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get excited there. First of all, I\u2019m not sure it is really that type of thinking for him.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou controlled his abrupt urge to smoke and rubbed his fingertips together as he spoke quietly. \u201cSecondly, even if I like him, he might not have the same preferences as me.\u201dKu Tianlu was taken aback. \u201cIs that possible? The day we met in the bar street, he was wrapped around you like that. How can it not be the same?\u201dIt was okay not to mention it. The moment the incident where they met for the first time was mentioned, Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help thinking of the scene where Lin Yan spent all night giving him a replay of the finals and had a headache. \u201cIn any case, you can handle the training match arrangements. If you think it will work then you can arrange it. If it doesn\u2019t work then you can just refuse it. You decide by yourself without considering me.\u201dKu Tianlu heard the other person\u2019s meaning and didn\u2019t worry too much anymore. \u201cI know. I\u2019ll go discuss it with the coaching staff.\u201dJing Yuanzhou hung up the phone and lay in bed, staring calmly at the ceiling for a while. Until now, he still remembered the slight tremor in his heart when he heard Lin Yan talk about PTSD. It was deep, like a thorn in his heart.In fact, sometimes appreciation and feelings were only separated by a very thin layer of paper. Originally, he hadn\u2019t thought deeply from this angle but today\u2019s call with Ku Tianlu inadvertently broke through it.Someone\u2019s figure flashed in his mind and Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth gradually curved down.The world might now be more tolerant of people who liked the same sex but it was still a small group after all. It was precisely because there were too many uncertain factors that he was always used to not thinking too much about these things.At least, until he met Lin Yan.Jing Yuanzhou instinctively glanced in the direction of the door before exhaling and closing his eyes.Forget it, let it be.Lin Yan received feedback from the BK Club. Then the next day at lunch, he told the members about the training match.Gu Luo suddenly felt that the food delivered to his mouth wasn\u2019t fragrant. \u201cWe are playing a training match with BK tonight?\u201dYesterday afternoon\u2019s live broadcast was very smooth. The emergence of Lan Min at the BK Club once again ushered in a huge wave of traffic.At the same time, there were countless more versions about the relationship between GH and BK. It changed from the original speculation that they didn\u2019t want to see each other to a bridge of love and killing.In short, apart from the fact that they had no results, the popularity of the GH team had soared and was almost on par with the professional teams in the serious professional league.Bi Yaohua had scanned Weibo as soon as he saw it. He thought of how some netizens took screenshots of Mini crying to turn into an emoticon and couldn\u2019t help guessing, \u201cIs it that rabbit who went back and cried to his team? BK is trying to give their newbie early revenge?\u201dLin Yan interrupted before their guesses could become more outrageous. \u201cIt was my appointment. We have been practicing for so long. Shouldn\u2019t we find a team to practice again? At this time, abusing the weak doesn\u2019t make sense. It is naturally more interesting to find a strong team. You are still too tender. Look, Titans isn\u2019t surprised at all.\u201dJing Yuanzhou noticed their gazes and told them, \u201cYesterday, the captain of BK already called me.\u201dJian Ye saw how calm these two people were and couldn\u2019t help asking with some expectation, \u201cSo Coach, do you think our team is capable of contending with BK now?\u201dLin Yan nodded. \u201cWell, it\u2019s almost the same.\u201dBefore the team members could be thrilled, he added slowly, \u201cThe winning rate is around 20%.\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to kill our prestige like this. Coach, GH has me and Titans at any rate. Shouldn\u2019t we be at least 50% against BK?\u201d\u201cHow long has BK been established and how long have we been established? Burning Hot is a team game and requires tacit understanding. This needs to be practiced in a game. With your current strength, it is enough to strive to win a game from BK. After playing a few games, you want a 50% chance of winning against a professional team. Or should I let you go and try one against five?\u201dLin Yan spat out a few ruthless words with a cold smile. \u201cDo you want to eat farts?\u201dBi Yaohua, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe Trash Talk King was actually forced to be speechless.Just then, Chen Yushen who didn\u2019t talk much opened his mouth. \u201cProtect one and fight for two.\u201dLin Yan gave Chen Yushen a surprised look and finally smiled slightly. \u201cThen work hard and do your best. Jiayou.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 29.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat afternoon, it was still the official daily broadcasting time of Burning Hot Assembly. The group of people broadcasted live as before. After all, there was a contract and they needed to meet the specified length of the live broadcast every month. They couldn\u2019t waste this time.Meanwhile, Jing Yuanzhou was still sitting by himself. It was the same scene as before but the audience always felt that there was a subtle sense of urgency in the training room of the GH team.Even BB had a lot less interactions during the live broadcast. This rare silence made him look more and more like he was pretending. It caused a group of fans and black fans to lick the screen or speak sarcastically. This made the live broadcast room of the Trash Talk King still lively.Lin Yan was sitting on the sofa with his laptop, discussing online with the data analysts and at the same time, formulating a strategy to fight against BK tonight. It wasn\u2019t until 5 o\u2019clock when he answered the phone that he got up and walked out of the lounge.At 5 o\u2019clock, the day\u2019s daily live broadcast officially ended. Everyone stretched their bodies and stood up. They looked up and saw Lin Yan walking in with a package. It was neatly opened on the table and a piggy bank was taken out.Bi Yaohua rubbed his sore neck and walked over. He saw this Q version of a little person wearing a pink tutu skirt and couldn\u2019t help falling silent. The others also looked over. Jing Yuanzhou was pouring a glass of water in the back and saw such a scene from far away.Gu Luo liked this type of cute stuff but felt it was a bit strange. \u201cCoach, how old are you? Why are you still buying a piggy bank?\u201dLin Yan played with the little person in a good mood. He made sure that the pink tutu could indeed be removed and shook his fingers with satisfaction. \u201cWhat do you know? Diligence and thriftiness have always been the traditional values of China. Don\u2019t forget your roots, understood?\u201dEveryone who suddenly received a bad label, \u201c???\u201dNot far away, Jing Yuanzhou smiled silently.Then he saw Lin Yan showing off the naked piggy bank and turning it around. \u201cSpeaking of which, this store is really good. If you need it then feel free to ask me for a link. Look, it is custom made and can be engraved at will.\u201dPreviously, it was hidden by the clothes and they hadn\u2019t noticed. Now they found that there was a small, delicate sign hanging around the person\u2019s neck. The words \u2018one jiao scumbag\u2019 was written on it in flamboyant and bold calligraphy.The members of GH. \u201cWow, it turns out you like playing with female clothing!\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThat evening, the people of GH logged into their accounts on time.In fact, Burning Hot had a custom server that was used by some teams for training games etc. to protect their combat data from leaking. However, GH wasn\u2019t yet eligible for this account. The BK team had simply agreed to the training match to see the strength of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s current team so they cooperatively chose to use the players\u2019 private accounts.Before the start of the training game, Lin Yan gave Bi Yaohua a wake-up call. \u201cToday we are playing a friendly team. Remember to close your microphone.\u201dBi Yaohua was helpless. \u201cI know\u2026 is it okay to talk in the team voice chat?\u201dLin Yan thought that it wasn\u2019t himself being tortured and agreed without any burden. \u201cCommunication within the team is a necessary factor for winning. Rest assured and communicate.\u201dThe other players, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFreestarBK was also very restrained. After entering the custom room, they greeted Jing Yuanzhou before greeting the other members in a friendly manner. In such a harmonious atmosphere, the first game of the training match began. It was a BO3 training match so if they wanted to defend one and fight for two as Chen Yushen mentioned, they needed at least one victory in the first two games.Lin Yan stood behind them and guided them through the BP session. After each side had banned a few heroes, BK\u2019s side quickly found the key point. GH might\u2019ve banned the strong heroes in the league but there were a few specific choices that actually blocked their usual lineup. This made BK\u2019s coach feel very uncomfortable.Ku Tianlu couldn\u2019t help glancing at the opposite IDs and sighing emotionally. \u201cThe coach on the other side\u2026 is very familiar with our routines.\u201dThe moment the words came out, he shut up. He remembered how this Coach Lin had been very enthusiastic toward Captain Jing on the bar street. It was the so-called \u2018love me then you have to love my dog\u2019. Wasn\u2019t it normal to be familiar with BK?Next to him, Lan Min had changed from yesterday\u2019s frustration and looked particularly motivated. \u201cSo what if they are familiar with it. We will get the final victory!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help being itchy at the thought of victory after the other person threw the games yesterday. He decisively locked onto the doomsday guard. Such a choice stunned Lin Yan on the other side for a moment. He instinctively looked back and happened to meet Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze. The two of them couldn\u2019t help smiling at each other.Great. The love-filled beating wasn\u2019t in vain.The lineup of both sides was quickly decided.Lin Yan looked at their heroes and gave a simple and final reminder. \u201cToday\u2019s command will be given to Titans. This round has less significance placed on the side lanes. You can just focus on BB\u2019s bottom lane.\u201dIn the devil training period, there were several sets of tactics formulated by Lin Yan for GH and there was a set of plans with this lane at the core. Today, he took it out in the first game against BK and this made Bi Yaohua very happy. \u201cDon\u2019t be stingy about spoiling me!\u201dJian Ye replied casually, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there is Brother Gun. There is enough milk!\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s usual morals were completely absent. \u201cDad loves you more!\u201dChen Yushen and Gu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan finally said \u2018jiayou\u2019 and closed his microphone. The game officially began and he entered data recording mode.BK\u2019s usual style was centred on their top lane. Yesterday, he had tested out Lan Min\u2019s strength. Lan Min might not be as good as Jing Yuanzhou but he was definitely at the top. Unfortunately, he had always followed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s path because of his blind worship. Now he finally understood that he should use heroes more suitable for himself and Lin Yan believed he would soon find a brand new world.Lin Yan was quite sure that after the establishment of BK\u2019s new side lane system, a new storm would inevitably be set off in the professional league. However, now before BK had enough time to grow, the original pillar of their team was on GH\u2019s side! Sometimes, the person who knew you best was always the scariest.Lin Yan wasn\u2019t worried. There was Jing Yuanzhou in the lane and he was as stable as Mount Tai. Lan Min\u2019s new hero might be more suitable for him but he hadn\u2019t yet undergone targeted systematic training. He ended up in a state of suppression throughout the game. Such a state undoubtedly limited BK\u2019s play system.Moreover, Jing Yuanzhou was too familiar with BK\u2019s routines. He could always react accurately every time the opponent came to catch him. It was like he could cross the fog of the map and accurately see the position of the five BK players. If the jungler came to him then they could finish a wave of double kills. If he attacked three people, then he would kill at least one person. If surrounded by four people, he could withdraw according to the original retreat route.The BK team quickly realized the problematic nature of their strategy but by the time they made adjustments, Bi Yaohua had the protection of Jian Ye and almost broke through the bottom lane. So far, the first game looked smooth. This continued to the mid-phase.GH was a newly formed team and they finally exposed their weaknesses in cooperation after successive small-scale team battles. Both Gu Luo and Bi Yaohua were very aggressive types of players. Although Jian Ye and Jing Yuanzhou cooperated, there were still flaws in the frequent team battles.FreestarThese mistakes were actually very small but a veteran team like BK naturally wouldn\u2019t miss every opportunity to counterattack.In the last wave of team battle, Chen Yushen went deep behind the enemy and killed the opposite mid-laner in one fell swoop. However, BK\u2019s shooter still found the best output position and cleared the field.Everyone fell into a brief silence when they saw their base crystal destroyed by the other side and the bleak computer screen. The game was over and Lin Yan had already obtained the information he wanted. He wrote the last stroke with satisfaction and closed the notebook.Jian Ye leaned against his gaming chair and sighed. \u201cIs this originally the strength of a professional team?\u201dGu Luo whispered, \u201cTheir team battle is so perfect\u2026\u201dLin Yan raised an eyebrow. He was about to say something when he heard Bi Yaohua speak first. \u201cIt is a pity to lose this one. I was wrong in the previous wave just now. I took it too lightly. A while ago, I was still abusing weaklings. Now I am playing professional players and I still want to take them as my sons. It is my problem. I forgot that I don\u2019t have such big sons. It is my blame, my blame.\u201dJian Ye added, \u201cI also have a problem. I didn\u2019t expect that they would give priority to killing Captain. I didn\u2019t choose my position well and was too far away. If I remembered to give the captain milk then it wouldn\u2019t be like this.\u201dGu Luo was silent for a moment. \u201cNo, I should be blamed. I was the one who took the lead and confidently thought that the opponent\u2019s mid-laner could be ambushed. Instead, I ended up encountering their ambush and we were forced to open a team battle.\u201dChen Yushen, \u201cI\u2026\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help laughing and interrupted his words. \u201cOkay. Abyss, you played very well in the game just now. The rhythm of the early stage was good and you stared very steadily at the shooter on the other side. These bad guys who dragged you back are to blame.\u201dThe bad guys he mentioned, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBi Yaohua was embarrassed and turned to look at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cCaptain, you don\u2019t have anything to say?\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t answer but turned to Lin Yan. \u201cCoach, how do you think I played?\u201dLin Yan sincerely praised him. \u201cFull MVP!\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for Jing Yuanzhou alone containing BK on the road in the early stages, perhaps their collapse would\u2019ve happened a lot earlier. However, their early advantage wasn\u2019t maintained to the end. This fully illustrated a very serious problem within the team.Lin Yan thought for a moment and felt that the model just now was very good. Thus, he picked up a pen and wrote it down in the notebook. \u201cOh yes, I think everyone\u2019s attitude this time is very good and it can be retained. In the future, we can add one more process every time we finish a training match. After losing a game, there will be a group meeting where you can scold yourself. Your words at this time will definitely be the most sincere. For example, just like your few sentences of reflection just now. I think it is particularly good but it isn\u2019t ruthless enough. It is better to swear and make yourself cry in two or three sentences.\u201dAt this point, he looked up at the group and asked, \u201cCan you get the feeling I mentioned?\u201dThe members of GH, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOkay, they didn\u2019t want to get it? Lin Yan turned a blind eye to such a sad sight and unilaterally added this process to the traditions of the team in the future. Seeing that the team members weren\u2019t ready yet, he clapped his hands. \u201cOkay, wait until it is time to start again. Didn\u2019t you want to fight for two? There are still two games left. Jiayou?\u201dAt first glance, they were very encouraging words but for some reason, they were filled with a type of disdain when they entered the members\u2019 ears. Did he think they couldn\u2019t win a game from the BK team?FreestarJing Yuanzhou looked down. He saw that the others were all excited, as if they were writing a few words in big letters: Fuck, jiayou, jiayou!The author has something to say:A long time later.Jing Yuanzhou smiled: I heard that you like playing with female clothing?Lin Yan: \u2026In fact, it is also okay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No wonder why people on the Internet say he is like a mad dog. It isn\u2019t just his mouth that is crazy. His operation is crazy as well.\u201dThe mid-laner spoke coldly, \u201cIs it only their shooter that is crazy? Did you see that mid-laner? His stabs are so fast and he was almost flying! I went to the granny grey-haired person\u2019s live broadcast room last time. Wasn\u2019t he soft and well-behaved? Why does his style change so much when playing?\u201dLan Min heard these words and couldn\u2019t help thinking of what he had suffered at the GH base. He muttered in a low voice, \u201cHow is he good? Nonsense!\u201dKu Tianlu\u2019s road in the jungle wasn\u2019t smooth. Every time he returned to his own wild area from ganking, it wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to describe it as \u2018not a single grass is growing\u2019 as all the mobs were gone. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. The jungle also isn\u2019t easy to fight. It is worthy of being the genius rookie from the training camp! At that time, the opportunity was grasped, tut! Thanks to Captain Jing dragging out the rhythm, he almost took our jungle as his home!\u201dThe support felt doubtful. \u201cWhat genius rookie?\u201dKu Tianlu cleared his throat. \u201cNothing. After this round, you must\u2019ve found that GH\u2019s strength isn\u2019t something that you can handle casually. Raise your energy and prepare for the next round!\u201dSome of their strategies weren\u2019t intended to be used in this type of training match but it was obvious that they must play with the serious attitude of dealing with professional league teams.Lan Min stretched his body for a while and asked objectively, \u201cI still struggle to face Master. Captain, do you think\u2026\u201dKu Tianlu knew what this person wanted to ask. He nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201dThey officially entered the BP link for the second game.Lin Yan glanced at the other team\u2019s row of IDs and his tone was calm and firm. \u201cThey are ready to switch lanes.\u201dThe so-called change in lanes meant switching the side lane player and the shooter\u2019s positions.After all, the person currently playing the side lane was the former captain of BK, Jing Yuanzhou. In a situation where all their routines were already known, changing lanes was indeed a wise choice. In this way, it meant Bi Yaohua would face Lan Min while Jing Yuanzhou would deal with BK\u2019s shooter and support combination.This statement was entirely based on personal inference but the GH members trusted the coach and had no doubts.Bi Yaohua smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s switched and I will meet that Lan rabbit?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was very clear about what BK would be like after the lane switch and declared, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a good thing. It will definitely affect your economy.\u201dThe shooter was the main output of the team. If the early development was lagging then it would have a great impact on the entire team. Lin Yan pondered on it for a bit. He felt it wasn\u2019t very cost-effective for them and made a quick decision. \u201cWe will switch it.\u201dHe had this in mind while guiding everyone to make hero changes. He adjusted the strategy in response to the problems in the previous game.Among the several plans that had been prepared, the BB system with the shooter as the core lane had been tried. Now he needed to collect data feedback on the other tactics. \u201cFor this one, Gun Zai will go with Abyss to invade the opposite side\u2019s jungle. Harvest a wave of mobs and then start to preserve Gloy\u2019s development.\u201dJian Ye replied, \u201cOkay, got it!\u201dIn the current version of Burning Hot, the support profession was a building block. It could be moved wherever it was needed. In this regard, Jian Ye had always been very professional.Lin Yan glanced at the lineup on both sides and finally added with a smile, \u201cRemember, we won\u2019t play team battles in this round.\u201dThe second training game officially began.Lan Min refreshed at the resurrection point and bought the equipment. Then he went out and ran down the road. As he ran, he said, \u201cRest assured and leave the shooter on the opposite side to me. I will surely hold him down. When that happens\u2026 fuck!\u201dThe moment Titans\u2019 ID appeared in his field of view, his hand on the keyboard trembled slightly and he almost used up his flash on the spot.Ku Tianlu had come to the wild area. He saw the two side laners meet each other and instantly understood. \u201cGH guessed that we switched lanes.\u201dThe shooter asked while killing the soldiers, \u201cWhat should I do? Do you want to switch the lanes back when returning to the city for supplies?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see at that time.\u201d Ku Tianlu was preparing to kill the monster in front of him when he suddenly saw two figures emerge from the grass and his heart jumped. \u201cThey have come to the jungle. Mid-laner, come here to help!\u201dBK\u2019s mid-laner reacted quickly but Gu Luo was obviously prepared. He directly threw out a continuous damage skill that blocked the way. Chen Yushen was backed by Jian Ye\u2019s milk and his actions were more radical than the previous game. He stole Ku Tianlu\u2019s monsters and immediately learned two skills after leveling up. A set of skills directly emptied Ku Tianlu\u2019s remaining health and he harvested the first head.[First Blood!]Ku Tianlu watched the two bandit-like figures running around on the dark screen and gritted his teeth. He gave a reminder, \u201cThe shooter on the road should be careful. The support is coming back.\u201dBK\u2019s shooter replied, \u201cNoted.\u201d15 seconds later, the second head appeared in the middle lane. The slain mid-laner laid on the ground and cursed \u2018fuck\u2019 one after another. Ku Tianlu stared at the two people occupying the middle lane and was stunned. Based on the first training game, wasn\u2019t GH taking the route with the bottom lane as the core? Then how did this one suddenly become the main force?However, there wasn\u2019t much time for him to think too much. The moment Gu Luo had free reign of the middle, he used a set of skills to quickly clear the line of soldiers. This freed up enough time for him to provide support to others.In the top and bottom lanes, Jing Yuanzhou and Bi Yaohua were originally professional players with sufficient strength and BK couldn\u2019t take advantage of them. Combined with the frequent loss of vision in the middle, BK\u2019s mid-laner would quickly signal to his teammates on both sides whenever Gu Luo and Jian Ye disappeared. This inevitably disrupted their original rhythm.During this period, Ku Tianlu also tried to carry out the double teaming tactics. It was just that due to Lin Yan\u2019s warning not to fight a team battle, GH avoided it to the end. Every time the number of enemies exceeded three, GH\u2019s team members would turn around and leave without looking back.They were full of desires when they came here but there was no nostalgia when they left.There might be occasions when someone slowed down. The teammates didn\u2019t hesitate to throw the person into the location of the BK team battle, selling their teammate. It was said that there was no burden at all. It was cruel and ruthless.The BK team tried several times to start a team battle but completely failed. They could only occasionally pick a few people who were alone to vent their anger. It felt like they would cough up blood at any time.FreestarHowever, the heroes chosen by the GH team in this round had high flowing movements and none of them were easy to catch. The Gu Luo mid-laner and Chen Yushen jungle duo even directly played the double assassins linkage and carried out guerrilla warfare.After some time, everyone in BK sighed with relief. In the middle and later stages of the game, there were difficulties and danger but they had finally grabbed an opportunity. However, they only saw one Jing Yuanzhou within their field of vision. There was the sexy healer Jian Ye escorting him in the rear. BK wasted most of their strength to kill him and also lost their support.It wasn\u2019t over yet. BK immediately enjoyed the treatment of their backyard being on fire. Gu Luo and Chen Yushen appeared on both sides and BK\u2019s mid-laner and shooter were killed.In this wave of team battle, four of the BK team were killed in exchange for two hands. Finally, only Ku Tianlu remained with a small amount of health left. He killed Bi Yaohua and evacuated hastily.Based on the overall situation, the BK team clearly had a long way to go. Currently, there were only three people with residual health on GH\u201ds side. Returning to the spring to restore their status was obviously the safest approach. However, looking at their line of soldiers that had already reached BK\u2019s high ground\u2026Gu Luo asked, \u201cCaptain, forcefully push it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t answer directly. \u201cLook at it yourself.\u201dGu Luo hadn\u2019t expected the decision to be placed in their own hands. Before he had time to think, his body had manipulated his character to run to BK\u2019s base. He was stunned for a moment before reacting. \u201cThen\u2026 push it?\u201dChen Yushen was more concise. \u201cPush!\u201dJian Ye\u2019s mana was already low. He directly used his last few skills to restore their state and followed them all the way to BK\u2019s base. He stepped in front of them with a sacrificial spirit, acting as the last protective barrier for his teammates.FreestarThere was only Ku Tianlu alive on BK\u2019s side. The others still had some time remaining until they could resurrect. At this time, Ku Tianlu faced three opponents who were in poor condition but didn\u2019t choose to passively defend the tower.Jian Ye\u2019s health and mana were depleted and he fell first under Ku Tianlu\u2019s sudden attack. Gu Luo and Chen Yushen reacted very quickly and rushed forward.Ku Tianlu had obviously calculated all the offensive processes and retreats. He didn\u2019t linger after taking a head and didn\u2019t give the two of them a chance to besiege him. He simply returned to the defense tower.The one against three situation turned into two against one in an instant. However, before anyone in the BK team had time to shout \u2018666\u2019 at their captain, they saw a flash on the screen. Chen Yushen had been maintaining a certain distance but now he unexpectedly used flash to close the distance. After a flying kick, he released a burst of damage to reduce Ku Tianlu\u2019s health to the lowest level. Then he detonated all of his health value. As his health gauge on the screen lowered, Ku Tianlu\u2019s health was emptied.Chen Yushen self-detonated and only had one drop of blood remaining. It was also too late to retreat from his current position. In this way, the defense tower took away his life. The kill was undoubtedly counted as Ku Tianlu\u2019s kill and a double kill prompt appeared on the screen.However, BK\u2019s members couldn\u2019t laugh. At this time, Gu Luo was still standing! Chen Yushen\u2019s decisive and neat set of suicide actions successfully made Gu Luo the only survivor on the field! Then a new wave of soldiers arrived. Gu Luo didn\u2019t have time to think about it. He took the soldiers with him and crushed the crystal of the BK team\u2019s base.In the last wave, Bi Yaohua was completely convinced. \u201cI didn\u2019t see it. Abyss, you are usually dull and silent but you are actually the more ruthless one! This wave of killing is 666. Brother Trash Talk will unilaterally announce that this MVP will be awarded to you!\u201dChen Yushen shook his head. \u201cThe previous rhythm was basically due to Gloy. I couldn\u2019t win without him.\u201dGu Luo just finished pushing to the crystal and there was a thin layer of sweat on his hands. He heard these words and said, \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t be so relieved without Brother Gun following me as support.\u201dJian Ye followed the trend and expressed humility. \u201cI am just a blood filling tool that has no feelings. Just ignore me. Still, I have to say that Captain\u2019s overall control is absolutely perfect. He stopped on this road and the jungler on the opposite side didn\u2019t dare leave this lane\u2019s field area.\u201dFreestarJing Yuanzhou gently moved the joints of his fingers. \u201cOkay, you are all MVPs.\u201dThey finally won a game from BK. Although tactical reasons and luck couldn\u2019t be ruled out, it was still enough to boost morale.Lin Yan finished writing the last stroke and when he raised his head, he happened to meet a row of expectant eyes. \u201c\u2026Why? Do you want praise?\u201dNo one answered but it was basically the default. Lin Yan thought for a moment and felt it was something necessary to give some encouragement. As a result, his tone became a bit sincere. \u201cThe \u2018one\u2019 in the slogan has been secured. Try to win the second game. I believe you can do it! Um\u2026 probably.\u201dThe members of GH, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis expression didn\u2019t look like he thought they could do it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 30.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJust then, Jing Yuanzhou typed a line in the custom room.[GH.Titans: The strategies for the mid-season game should\u2019ve been practiced? Take it out for a try?][Luuu: This\u2026 are you sure?][GH.Titans: Yes, it is the third game. It is worth trying.][Luuu: Okay!]The others originally wanted to complain about Lin Yan\u2019s attitude of attacking their enthusiasm. Then they saw this and exchanged looks. They might feel a bit unwilling but they had to admit that BK did hide some things when playing with them in the first two games.In fact, it could be understood. After all, they weren\u2019t a professional league team yet. The fact that BK promised to accompany them to play a few rounds was already caring for them. Now BK was about to usher in the mid-season of the league and it was normal not to expose too many tactics during a training game.The GH members thought of this and the playful atmosphere became serious again. Lin Yan noticed the change and smiled silently.By the time the BP process for the third game was over, it wasn\u2019t difficult to see from the lineup selected by BK that the opposing coach had discovered the key to their loss in the previous game. Lin Yan liked this type of pulling back and forth.The battle began again. Unsurprisingly, this time BK didn\u2019t give GH any more chances. Ku Tianlu targeted them from the start and directly invaded GH\u2019s jungle. In fact, anyone who had seen the previous professional league matches knew that this was Ku Tianlu\u2019s most normal way of fighting.Previously, Ku Tianlu considered the capacity of a new time to hold on and still held back. Now that he had heard Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s words, he finally let go. Ku Tianlu did have to admit that the GH team\u2019s guerrilla system was indeed a headache.Therefore, in this round, the BK team simply held back Captain Jing and pushed the lanes from the beginning, not leaving the other side any chance at all.FreestarLin Yan stood behind the team members and wrote frantically. He was satisfied with the increasingly disadvantageous situation.In the early days of the team\u2019s establishment, it wasn\u2019t a bad thing to have these problems exposed. The more it was exposed, the more growth they could have. Judging from the excited expressions of the current players, it was clear that they were extremely satisfied with such a strong opponent. No fear of strength and no fear of failure. This was e-sports!The players fully engaged in the game didn\u2019t notice the training room\u2019s door being pushed open. Lin Yan looked up and saw Luo Mo sticking his head in. He moved his mouth and asked silently, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLuo Mo\u2019s expression was a bit subtle. He glanced at the people who were still fighting and beckoned to Lin Yan to come out. Lin Yan set up the video system and walked out. He closed the door of the training room and the corridor was quiet.Lin Yan watched Luo Mo suspiciously. \u201cWhat is it that you\u2019re acting so mysteriously?\u201dLuo Mo didn\u2019t say it directly and instead glanced at the phone in his hand. \u201cYou will know by looking at Weibo.\u201dLin Yan logged into his account in a puzzled manner only to discover that GH\u2019s original super topic with a limited number of fans had completely exploded. At the same time, there were several related topics.Today\u2019s training match between their team and BK was conducted on an ordinary server. The mode set didn\u2019t allow spectators to watch but netizens could check the game records through official assistants.FreestarFor a giant veteran team like BK, the players\u2019 several side accounts were discovered early. So at this time, they might be using private accounts but netizens could still match their accounts. He didn\u2019t know which team\u2019s fans found out that the players were online and went to look at the game records on a whim.The identities of both sides were discovered and it naturally exploded. Just now, the game that the GH team won was clearly shown there!Lin Yan glanced at the hot topic. The discussion area under the BK Club\u2019s super topic was basically like this:[What is the situation? Am I blind? BK actually played a training match with a team like GH?][Who knows if they happened to be playing together? Why must it be a training match?][Oh, your family is playing BO3? In the second game, GH won. BK, this really isn\u2019t good!][Ding! One round-trip mid season ticket is booked!][Placing a bet. I think BK will be able to make it through to the second round.][Hehe, it is just the second round. I said it for a long time that BK can\u2019t do without Titans.][What a joke. The favourite team to win the World Championship lost to a third-rate variety team.][Why do I feel like BK is doing charity today? During the offseason, they sold some human feelings for Titans and threw the game to raise GH\u2019s self-confidence!]Next door, GH\u2019s super topic wasn\u2019t much better:[They actually won against BK. Great. This is worthy of the team I just became a fan of!][Fuck, why aren\u2019t I allowed to watch the game? Gloy\u2019s mother fan is the first to express dissatisfaction!][Hahaha, are you making trouble? Didn\u2019t you see that the super topic next door has completely blown up?][I just came back from next door. Fucking dog, why do you my BB dog son can\u2019t win against the opposite side? No matter how terrible my son is, his strength is recognized, okay!]Freestar[Ha, I came here to stop by. Do you GH fans really feel that they won the training game?][66666, telling a joke. How can GH\u2019s strength beat BK?][The few upstairs people, roll back to where you came from. Those who appear out of nowhere will have broken legs, understood?][Yo yo yo, GH is a third-rate team that has no professional experience yet has the professional disease. GH\u2019s fans really have a big temper!]Freestar[BK stinks and his fans\u2019 mouths are even more stinky. Have you come all this way to ask for fatherly love? If you want to talk then Dad will reward you with a few slaps.][Hahaha, it is the old black fans of the Trash Talk King.]Luo Mo waited a while but he didn\u2019t hear Lin Yan respond. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cBoss, looking at this\u2026 do we need to respond?\u201dAt present, it was just a heated discussion after fans discovered it. If the club chose to show up then it was obviously another situation. Lin Yan didn\u2019t expect that such a big scene would happen after a training match. In his personal opinion, he was naturally willing to use this opportunity to catch a wave of heat from the BK team.However, he might have some opinions on BK\u2019s management due to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s matter but the players of the team were innocent. They kindly accompanied the GH team to play a training match. It was a bit embarrassing to get them involved in such a dispute.Lin Yan was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cWait until the last game is over.\u201dThen he opened the door and returned to the training room. The first thing he saw when he entered through the door was the base\u2019s crystal being smashed on the computer screen. In the first BO3 match against BK, it wasn\u2019t a surprise that they lost to BK.FreestarDespite being abused, everyone seemed to be in a good mood.Bi Yaohua let out a long sigh. \u201cThe strength of the BK team is okay! Previously, they always seemed to have an unstable rhythm but now it is tightened! They are different from my teammates. This is a professional team!\u201dChen Yushen stared at him blankly.Bi Yaohua noticed his gaze and cleared his throat. \u201cAh, I mean my former teammates. I wasn\u2019t talking about you!\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled silently before looking back at Lin Yan. \u201cDo you have something to say?\u201dIt might\u2019ve been during the game but he still noticed Lin Yan\u2019s departure.Lin Yan told him, \u201cYes, you better talk to the BK team as well.\u201dHe quickly gave a brief explanation of the current situation.After listening, everyone including Bi Yaohua fell silent. They all knew the level of the BK team. In normal times, a secondary league team might not have the opportunity to play a training match against BK even if they kneeled down three times. As a result, such a team didn\u2019t hesitate to come and practice with them. Everyone knew exactly who they were caring about.It was absolutely very affectionate and meaningful. Now they actually pitted the BK team because of this training match. Jing Yuanzhou picked up his phone and walked outside. \u201cI\u2019ll call Ku Tianlu.\u201dLin Yan told him, \u201cGo.\u201dThe rest of the team waited quietly in the training room with expressions more solemn than when they lost the training match. Lin Yan was amused by the sight and was about to say a few words when Jing Yuanzhou came back.FreestarJing Yuanzhou felt the gazes of the others and smiled. \u201cWhat type of expression is this? You care that much?\u201dFreestarBi Yaohua looked solemn. \u201cNo one understands the importance of reputation better than me!\u201dJian Ye was also very worried but he couldn\u2019t help complaining.There was still the word \u2018reputation\u2019 in the Trash Talk King\u2019s dictionary?!\u201cCaptain Ku said it isn\u2019t a big deal so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou knew what everyone was waiting for and didn\u2019t drag it out. As he spoke, he fiddled with the phone in his hand. His eyes glanced over it and his lips curved up in a smile. \u201cIn addition, his side is already dealing with it.\u201dOn Ku Tianlu\u2019s private Weibo, they could see the latest post: [I just learned about what happened online after the training match. Thank you for your concern. The training match was very good and I won\u2019t give an explanation for the lost game. The new routine is still being practiced. It still isn\u2019t sufficient but we are working hard to improve it. I hope to give you a perfect answer in the midseason. In addition, thank you to everyone in the GH team. You are very strong and I\u2019m looking forward to an official match in the professional league! #pay one\u2019s respect #pay one\u2019s respect]Then other members of the BK team also logged into Weibo.BK\u2019s shooter: [Apart from the Trash Talk King\u2019s mouth, his hand speed is also very powerful. It is so cool, I admire it #pay one\u2019s respect #pay one\u2019s respect]Netizen\u2019s comment: ??? I suspect you\u2019re telling a dirty joke but there is no evidence?BK\u2019s mid-laner: [Sure enough, it is the world of young people now, sob #pay one\u2019s respect #pay one\u2019s respect]Netizen\u2019s comment: No, you will always be 18 in my mind!BK\u2019s support: [Should I try playing with a healer? #pay one\u2019s respect #pay one\u2019s respect]Netizen\u2019s comment: Playing with a healer sister in this version? I\u2019ll directly be your mother, okay!The last one to post on Weibo was Lan Min. [Thank you to @GH.Titans for your careful guidance. You will always be my master! #pay one\u2019s respect #pay one\u2019s respect!]Before the comments area was filled with netizens, Lan Min quickly posted another one.[@BK.Mini: @GH Club V, I am waiting for you in the professional league!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 31.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment the Weibo posts of the BK team were released, it wasn\u2019t a surprise that another bloody storm was created on the Internet. Not surprisingly, this incident also attracted the attention of other professional teams.However, in comparison, the eyes of insiders were far more discerning than those of ordinary people.After all, there was the relationship between Jing Yuanzhou and the BK team. Professional players could certainly guess the intention of this training game. As for GH winning against BK, it was only one game out of three. No one could ensure that they played normally in every game. Without knowing the specific situation, there was no need to question the overall strength of the BK team too much.Once Jing Yuanzhou received Luni\u2019s message, he knew that the group chat of the professional players was probably very lively.It was strange to say but when both of them were still in the professional league, they were friendly but there wasn\u2019t too much overlap. As a result, after temporarily leaving the professional circle, they had the opportunity for a deep friendship.Luni asked very directly, \u201cSo you really won the training match?\u201dJing Yuanzhou corrected him. \u201cOne game.\u201d\u201cIt is all the same.\u201d Luni lamented. \u201cA new team is already very strong if they can win a game from BK.\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed. \u201cWhat is it? You\u2019re speaking in such a roundabout way. Does your LDF also want to make an appointment with us?\u201dThen he continued before the other person could respond. \u201cHowever, our team\u2019s schedule is quite busy lately. You will have to schedule an appointment.\u201dLuni laughed angrily. \u201cAren\u2019t you thinking too much? Making an appointment with you? We aren\u2019t so free! The midseason is about to start. Even if the coaching staff wants to arrange a training match for us, it must be against other professional teams.\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t agree. \u201cThe strength of a professional team is naturally higher but does this type of training match have any significance? In order not to expose it, new tactics and routines can\u2019t be tried out. No matter how intense the game, none of the things you want to test can be tested. It\u2019s just acting on both sides and it depends on who has better acting skills.\u201dHis words were straightforward and also true.Luni was choked up for a while and found he couldn\u2019t refute it. After a moment of silence, he cleared his voice. \u201cThat\u2026 a training match isn\u2019t impossible to consider. In fact, it is for the sake of your face. I can give you an opportunity if you want it. In short\u2026 well, let\u2019s see later! I was just asking casually. I called you today for something else.\u201dJing Yuanzhou wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cDo you know that the program plans to record two episodes directly this time? There is no way. Our team will start training soon and we can only ask the program to compress the recording time as much as possible,\u201d Luni said. \u201cThe second episode will be recorded tomorrow afternoon. At that time, the first round of elimination will occur. Then the day after tomorrow, the third episode will be recorded.\u201dAt this point, he laughed pointedly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me last time that you wanted me to beat you up on the show? Now the opportunity is here. Do you want me to fulfill your wish?\u201dJing Yuanzhou had just made coffee and came out of the tea room when he heard these words. His footsteps didn\u2019t stop. \u201cNo need.\u201dLuni sounded a bit regretful. \u201cYou don\u2019t need it? You coaxed them so soon?\u201dJing Yuanzhou walked slowly up the stairs and his eyes fell on the faint light leaking through the door not far away. The corners of his mouth hooked up. \u201cYes, coaxed well.\u201d\u201cJust coaxed them well, coaxed them well.\u201d Luni was somewhat disappointed about not being able to hammer Titans in public and said goodbye with a lack of interest. \u201cThen I won\u2019t bother you. Good night.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked down at the call that had hung up and smiled silently. Then he turned and knocked on the door.There was the faint sound of footsteps from inside the room. A moment later, the door opened. Lin Yan had his bangs tied up above his head as usual. He saw Jing Yuanzhou and was taken aback. \u201cAren\u2019t you sleeping yet?\u201dTomorrow was a recording day again. It was as Luni said. In order to squeeze the time for recording two episodes, the shooting schedule was quite tight. Therefore, in order to avoid a poor performance on the scene, Lin Yan urged all the players to go back to their rooms and rest after the evening training match.Jing Yuanzhou handed over the coffee and spoke a half-truth. \u201cThe training match attracted too much attention. Many friends ran to me to express their sympathies. I couldn\u2019t stop it.\u201dLin Yan took the coffee. \u201cYes, there was such a big noise that the professional players probably know about it.\u201dHe suddenly raised his head and glanced at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cSo are there any other teams that want a practice match with us?\u201dJing Yuanzhou replied, \u201cThe midseason competition is about to start. They are very busy and it is estimated that they will only face each other.\u201dLin Yan sighed with disgust. \u201cHow many levels can they improve by playing with another professional team? They will be opponents sooner or later so tactics will be hidden. It isn\u2019t easy to expose them. What is the use of this type of training match? Isn\u2019t it lonely? It\u2019s better to play with us. Our strength is excellent and it won\u2019t affect their midseason competition.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I said.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s lips curved up slightly. \u201cSo there are probably some teams that have started to consider it.\u201dLin Yan was taken aback for a moment before his eyebrows flew up happily. \u201cAh Titans, our two hearts are linked as one!\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze lowered and swept across the other person\u2019s face. Then he murmured in a low voice, \u201cAs long as you are satisfied.\u201dThe low-pitched and magnetic male voice swept over Lin Yan\u2019s ears, making the surrounding atmosphere somewhat ambiguous for a moment.\u201cYou always think about such things. Of course I am satisfied.\u201d Lin Yan took a sip of the coffee made by Jing Yuanzhou. Then he glanced at the time and urged, \u201cIt is really late. Go back and rest.\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at the bright computer screen in the room and gave a reminder. \u201cAren\u2019t you also participating in tomorrow\u2019s recording?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have to play the game. I\u2019ll just sleep in the car for awhile after we set off.\u201d Lin Yan pinched the area between his eyes and looked tired. \u201cEveryone played well tonight. I have to quickly get the replay video while I haven\u2019t forgotten a lot of the details. I will finish it now and explore the details with everyone once the recording is over. Sure enough, it is necessary to play with strong teams to find problems! There are many things I haven\u2019t paid attention to previously. Now I know there are so many loopholes in our team battles. Before the fall competition season starts, I need to grab a hold of all of them and straighten them out!\u201dThe midseason competition hadn\u2019t even started yet and the professional league qualification of the variety show hadn\u2019t been obtained. As a result, Lin Yan was already considering the fall competition.FreestarJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t know if this person was unnecessarily worried or far-sighted. Jing Yuanzhou knew he couldn\u2019t persuade Lin Yan and didn\u2019t insist. \u201cThen I will go to bed first. Don\u2019t stay up late.\u201dLin Yan waved his hand. \u201cGo ahead. I will continue to struggle.\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced over and didn\u2019t say anything else.Everyone only knew the hard work of professional players but in fact, there were many times when the word done by the coaches was more cumbersome, complicated and extremely exhausting.The time he spent staying up late was never any less than the time they did.Early the next morning, the GH members gathered in the business car arranged by the program. Due to the previous lesson, this time the cameraman took the front passenger seat first and firmly defended his work territory.Lin Yan had stopped arguing with Jing Yuanzhou a long time ago and he didn\u2019t care about this. He got in the car and saw that only the place next to Jing Yuanzhou was empty. He just yawned and sat down.It was obvious at first glance that he didn\u2019t get enough rest. It wasn\u2019t known how late he stayed up but the dark circles under his eyes could be seen. There was an extremely decadent feeling of laziness.Lin Yan sat down and grabbed a pillow. He was feeling a bit drowsy when he felt something cover his body. He took a look and found it was a pink plush blanket. He was surprised for a moment and turned to see where the blanket came from.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t seem to feel this gaze and asked casually, \u201cWhat time did you go to sleep?\u201dLin Yan thought numbly. \u201cIt seems to be\u2026 4 o\u2019clock?\u201d\u201cGo to sleep.\u201dAs he spoke, Jing Yuanzhou noticed Lin Yan\u2019s gaze on the blanket. \u201cThe air conditioner is on in the car and it is easy to get cold when you fall asleep. I\u2019m not sleepy. You can use it first.\u201dLin Yan had no opinion on this. He pulled the blanket up comfortably and fell asleep with the pillow in his arms.Just as he was falling asleep, a vague thought came to his mind. \u2018This is Titans\u2019 blanket but\u2026 why is it pink?\u2019Such a thought floated through his mind before he gradually sank into a dark silence. Jing Yuanzhou felt the gradually smooth breathing of the person around him and looked over silently. In sharp contrast to the usual brazenness, Lin Yan\u2019s expression was calm when he was asleep.The hair that fell over his forehead swayed gently with the cool air from the air conditioner in the car. The slender legs fell open and he was so relaxed that he seemed incompatible with the pink blanket.This blanket was bought by Jing Yuanzhou at a small stall when he was running in the morning. He didn\u2019t know what he was thinking at the time. It was probably because he suddenly remembered the pink tutu for the scumbag piggy bank that had left a deep impression. He brought it back to the base before he could react.Jing Yuanzhou thought of this and his lips slightly curved up. Just then, the car passed through a bend and Lin Yan\u2019s body swayed. Jing Yuanzhou quickly supported his head. Then he gently lowered it so Lin Yan was leaning against his shoulder. The gentle breathing rubbed against his sensitive neck. From this angle, Lin Yan\u2019s eyelashes were fine and slender. The colour that filled Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes was deep.It wasn\u2019t until they arrived at the hotel arranged by the program that Lin Yan woke up. He slept well along the way and got rid of a lot of the exhaustion from staying up late. Then he opened his eyes and saw Jing Yuanzhou, who was just a short distance awayJing Yuanzhou\u2019s attitude was very calm and he just gave a reminder. \u201cWhen you sleep in the future, try and pay attention to your image.\u201dLin Yan lowered his head slightly. He could see the obviously soaked part of someone\u2019s shoulder and one of his cheeks still felt a strange warmth from the residual touch.There was a moment of silence. He wasn\u2019t very embarrassed but he still instinctively insisted, \u201cIn fact, don\u2019t pay too much attention to the details. After all, saliva\u2026 cough, is sterilization.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They saw Lin Yan follow Jing Yuanzhou down with a subtle expression before going to the front desk to check in. It was only at this time that they realized how full their itinerary was.They went to their rooms to place their luggage and had just filled their stomachs when a staff member ran over to urge them to prepare for the styling. In the afternoon, they would directly enter the recording stage.In the lounge, Jian Ye sighed as the stylist tried to flatten his hair. \u201cThis world still speaks for the strong. In order to consider Luni\u2019s schedule, the program tossed us so desperately. In the final analysis, the weak have no human rights!\u201dLin Yan had slept for a while and was now more energetic. He glanced over after hearing these words. \u201cIf you want human rights then you have to work hard to earn them.\u201dBi Yaohua remembered the scene he saw on the road just now. \u201cSpeaking of which, did you see the signs that the fans are holding? Is it my illusion? I always feel that the audience today is much more enthusiastic than the first episode!\u201d\u201cThere really is a lot of enthusiasm.\u201d Gu Luo was embarrassed as he said this. \u201cThere were several people holding our sign just now!\u201dBi Yaohua laughed. \u201cWeren\u2019t there already signs last time? In the last episode, your Brother Trash Talk had a good reputation, okay!\u201dChen Yushen sent him a deep, silent look. \u201c\u2026Yes, you did indeed have a lot of reputation.\u201dHe also saw it just now. There was an area full of cheering cards like \u2018BB, this dog thing\u2019 and it was particularly eye-catching.Luo Mo had just walked in front outside. He heard their conversation and showed the data in his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s true. The staff told me that the fans of our team have indeed increased by a lot today.\u201dThese words made everyone in GH a bit excited. They knew how difficult it was to gain approval. This was clearly a very good start. Lin Yan clapped with satisfaction. \u201cThis isn\u2019t bad. Keep going and try to blow away the opposite side this afternoon!\u201dBi Yaohua swung his multi-coloured peacock hair. \u201cBlow them up! This is necessary!\u201dThe stylist watched as the hairstyle he worked so hard on was ruined and couldn\u2019t help knocking on Bi Yaohua\u2019s head with the comb. \u201cDon\u2019t move, your hairstyle is being ruined!\u201dBi Yaohua immediately sat up straight. Once the styling was done, a staff member came to explain the recording process today. Then he took everyone to the player seats to wait for the recording to begin.At 2 o\u2019clock exactly, the familiar opening music was played on time. Unlike the small fights in the first episode, the second episode finally ushered in the first elimination round of Burning Hot Assembly.After the host introduced the rules, he explained the privileges that the winners of the previous round received. A total of eight teams participated in this season\u2019s variety show. After the first episode\u2019s solo games, the winning team would naturally enter the position of defender. In this episode, they would accept the challenge of the four losing teams.The elimination process adopted the 5v5 team battle of the official league. It was the BO3 format and the final winner would smoothly enter the next round. The loser would be eliminated directly and bid farewell to the subsequent program recording.After listening to the rules, everyone on the GH team looked a bit disappointed. There was no need to guess. The ZX team definitely wouldn\u2019t choose them. In this way, there was no way to care for LAN on the show. There were some regrets.The list of defenders were displayed on the big screen. There were four winning teams in the first episode. In addition to GH, the QU and IBB were undoubtedly strong teams. For the ZX team, the remaining KON naturally became the best choice.Unfortunately, by the time it was the turn of the ZX team, KON had already been selected. Out of the remaining three teams, they finally chose IBB. Only QU and GH were left. The third losing team chose GH without hesitation.In the host\u2019s interview, the captain didn\u2019t forget the polite pre-match trash talk. \u201cI heard the GH team won a training game against BK. We also want to take the opportunity to see how much of a gap we have with a professional team.\u201dWho didn\u2019t know that \u2018GH won a training game against Bk\u2019 had become a hot topic on the Internet? Mentioning it now could be said to increase sarcasm to the max. Bi Yaohua was an old man at trash talk and he didn\u2019t care too much. His lips just curved in a smile. \u201cOh, what should I do? I always feel underestimated?\u201dChen Yushen moved his fingers and slightly raised his head. \u201cThen it\u2019s okay to make them go home.\u201dThe official battle began.ZX was eventually beaten 2-0 by IBB. It could be seen that the state of the ZX team was a bit bad. Almost all of them seemed to be sleepwalking. In particular, LAN seriously played the role of a cash machine for the opponent. These two games didn\u2019t have any hot spots so even the GH team members who were happy to see LAN being abused didn\u2019t show much interest.Finally, it was GH\u2019s turn.Lin Yan patted his butt and stood up. He thought for a moment before deciding to add more difficulty to this unofficial entertainment match. \u201cI won\u2019t put too much pressure on you. I will just set a small goal. You just need to resolve the game faster than IBB.\u201dIt was easy to say but in fact, IBB had won against ZX with a crushing record. The time was astonishingly short. Even so, the players didn\u2019t care about Lin Yan\u2019s approach of adding difficulty on the spot. \u201cYes, no problem.\u201dThere was a simple check of the equipment and the match officially started. Lin Yan had already planned out the lineup in his mind. He completed the selection of heroes with a few words and returned to the player seats. The moment the five members of GH refreshed at the resurrection point, they bought their equipment and rushed out.If someone had watched the training match against BK last night then it wasn\u2019t difficult to find that today\u2019s GH used the same lineup that was defeated in the first game against BK. It was just that the opponents were different so the feel of the game was obviously very different.Bi Yaohua was worried after being suppressed by BK in the later stages. Therefore, he held his breath and wanted to act carefully. Then after several contacts with the opposite shooter, he couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cThe difference between the secondary league and the professional league is this much? It\u2019s too ridiculous! I thought that ZX\u2019s strength was just an accident. I didn\u2019t expect it to be normal!\u201dThe moment he finished speaking, a kill prompt appeared on the screen. Bi Yaohua completed a wave of double kills thanks to the assistance of Jian Ye. Gu Luo happened to be chasing the opposite mid-laner and unleashing a crazy output. He moved his hands and went over to the tower to kill the opponent. Then he returned to the soldier line to receive a wave of experience. He laughed when he heard these words. \u201cEveryone is asking for too much.\u201dChen Yushen was already blocking the opposite jungler in the highlands and sighed. He agreed with Bi Yaohua on this matter. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t difficult.\u201dJian Ye originally wanted to say something. He inadvertently glanced at the situation on the road and froze for a moment. \u201cFuck, Captain, you are silent but why are you about to push to the opponent\u2019s high ground?\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at the time. \u201cIsn\u2019t it a time limited mission? Everyone should hurry up so you don\u2019t make the coach angry.\u201dThe moment the other four people heard this, Lin Yan\u2019s angry expression flashed in their minds. They thought about the consequences they might enjoy after returning to the base and their backs became cold. The expressions on their faces suddenly became serious. \u201cYes, I see. Everyone push to the tower!\u201dSoon, they took the first game with a crushing victory. The time was 18 minutes. It was two minutes faster than IBB\u2019s match against ZX. Originally, this was already a shocking time. No one expected the second game to end even faster.15 minutes! A game that ended in 15 minutes occurred on such an occasion. For a short time, even the host didn\u2019t know what to say.Just then, the camera switched to GH\u2019s combat zone and he could see the team looking completely relieved. The host was slightly taken aback. Could it be that these two games weren\u2019t as easy as they seemed? In other words, GH actually felt a lot of pressure during the battle?The host had this in mind and quickly brought the microphone over, cutting to interview mode. \u201cCongratulations to GH for qualifying for the next round. I want to ask you, is there anything you want to say in front of the camera?\u201dFreestarTo people\u2019s amazement, Bi Yaohua wasn\u2019t in a hurry to speak. This time, Jian Ye was the first one to speak. Jian Ye smiled at the camera, the scar on his face flashing slightly, his entire expression cool. \u201cI don\u2019t know what other people think but you should now see how far the gap is between a secondary league team and a professional team.\u201dSuch a sentence made the opponents cleaning up their peripherals stiffen.At this time, Gu Luo took over. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of yesterday\u2019s training match but my hand feel hasn\u2019t been adjusted. I fought a bit too aggressively, sorry.\u201dChen Yushen thought for a moment before saying, \u201cThis type of opponent has no rhythm and isn\u2019t easy to play.\u201dThe team who just lost the match, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2018We are too weak, I\u2019m sorry!!!\u2019The microphone moved around and finally landed in Bi Yaohua\u2019s hand. He brushed the bangs away from his forehead and gave a low sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201dJust as everyone was feeling shocked that the Trash Talk King would have nothing to say, Bi Yaohua looked up at the camera in a melancholy manner and uttered sincere words, \u201cIf I really have to say something, I can only say\u2026 abusing vegetables is really boring!\u201dEveryone at the scene, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u2018You guys played a training match with BK, right? Is it because you ate too much fish and meat that you look down on clear soup? You only ate a small meal. After one game, you are picky with food?!\u2019The host didn\u2019t dare wait for Bi Yaohua to say anything else and had already transferred the microphone to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s hand. \u201cCaptain Jing, do you\u2026 have anything to say?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled at the camera. \u201cSorry, it was Coach Lin and I who spoiled them.\u201dLin Yan sitting in the contestant\u2019s seats and who was suddenly named, \u201c?\u201d\u2018Talk about yourself, don\u2019t pull me in!\u2019The camera cut the images of the two men on the big screen at the same time. One side showed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s faintly smiling gaze while the other side was Lin Yan\u2019s slightly dissatisfied expression. They looked at each other in this way across the distance.The scene that was full of whispers suddenly fell into a state of silence. Wait, what was this feeling of a weird dating show?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 43": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe four sets of matches were played and the elimination list for the first round of Burning Hot Assembly was officially formed. At the end of the recording, the program arranged a farewell ceremony for the defeated teams. They stood in the middle of the venue and gave their goodbye speeches one after another. The atmosphere was very tragic.Lin Yan squinted toward the middle of the centre of the field as he sat on the GH player seats but he spoke to Jing Yuanzhou next to him. \u201cYour words just now were serious?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s lips curved and he knowingly asked, \u201cWhich sentence do you mean?\u201dThe host had conducted the interview for a while and they did have a lot of exchanges. Lin Yan turned his head without a smile, not falling for this at all. \u201cYou said we spoiled them, right? So does Captain Jing feel that our team\u2019s usual training volume is still too little?\u201dThe person sitting next to them had no intention of inserting himself in the invisible wall between the two people. However, he heard such a sentence and had a bad premonition. Bi Yaohua instinctively blurted out, \u201cCoach, I think the amount of training is enough! It is good, really good!\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t seem to hear Bi Yaohua\u2019s words and didn\u2019t even give this person a look. He watched Jing Yuanzhou and continued to speak. \u201cIt just so happens that after going back this time, I am prepared to customize a brand new training plan for everyone to make sure you feel very sa,tis,fied.\u201dThe four people who experienced no love, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBy the time the recording ended, it was completely dark outside. The eliminated teams had gone back ahead of time. The staff took into account promotional materials and had the winning teams stay back to shoot a few promotional videos. Such a crowded itinerary was undoubtedly very inhumane. The even more inhumane thing was that the program hadn\u2019t arranged dinner for them. By the time everything was over and they were ready to go back to the hotel, everyone was basically starving.\u201cDon\u2019t go back to the room. Let\u2019s go eat first.\u201d Sitting in the car on the way back to the hotel, Bi Yaohua felt an unspeakable fatigue. \u201cFor the first time, I feel that even talking is a burden.\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or scold this person. \u201cThen can\u2019t you just shut up?\u201dBi Yaohua collapsed in his seat. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I have no physical vitality but I can\u2019t just shut up because I will lose my proud soul.\u201dChen Yushen rubbed his aching temple and felt a bit deaf.In the back row, Lin Yan curled up with the pink blanket. The physical strength he had gained from sleeping in the car this morning had been used up and he was basically empty.Jing Yuanzhou glanced back and saw that he was about to fall asleep at any time. He suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to your room to rest first. I will pack dinner for you.\u201dLin Yan\u2019s eyes swept over the car. The players looked sluggish but the atmosphere was still lively because they won the match. He also didn\u2019t want to ruin everyone\u2019s fun so he suggested as he yawned, \u201cCome on, eat together.\u201dThe restaurant on the third floor of the hotel was basically contracted by the teams that participated in the recording today. Looking around, there were all types of team uniforms. The teams that came back early had finished eating and were ready to go back to their rooms to rest.The group had just walked out of the elevator when a familiar team was encountered. During today\u2019s recording, the ZX team chose the strong team IBB as their opponent in order to avoid GH. They had been eliminated and would check out tomorrow morning to return to their club\u2019s base. The defeated teams had come back early so they already finished their last meal at the hotel. It was a bit sad when thinking about it.Even ZX hadn\u2019t expected that before they left, they would encounter the GH team who just returned from shooting footage. It was truly like the saying \u2018enemies on a narrow road.\u2019In fact, it seemed that since the end of the last recording, ZX\u2019s state hadn\u2019t been very good. In addition, the team was hit hard by IBB in the afternoon and the atmosphere of the entire team was a bit low. This made LAN\u2019s face, which was originally sharp like a monkey, look even more unlucky.The captain of ZX saw GH and his first reaction was to pretend not to see anything and directly pass by them. However, Lin Yan greeted them with a smile. \u201cWhat a coincidence. Are you ready to go back?\u201dThis warm tone sounded very kind at first but the words \u2018go back\u2019 were used subtly. The faces of the ZX members sank when they heard it.Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help glancing to the side. He saw that the someone who was still drowsy when getting out of the car had changed his state. At this time, Lin Yan\u2019s face was bright and his smile blossomed like a flower.Jing Yuanzhou smiled silently and nodded at the captain of ZX from a distance. Such an attitude meant the captain of ZX had to stop the team and chat. The pleasant atmosphere entered the ears of passersby. Those who didn\u2019t know anything would think the two teams were good friends.Chen Yushen stood in the rear and never said a word. He looked blankly at LAN, who was also standing in the rear of ZX. The other person was staring at him with an ugly expression.Lin Yan looked back and noticed the hostile gazes of the two men. The corners of his mouth curved up in a smile and he changed the subject without warning. \u201cBy the way, the base of ZX is in Pingcheng?\u201dThe captain of ZX hadn\u2019t expected this to be mentioned. He was puzzled but he instinctively replied, \u201cYes, it is in PIngcheng.\u201dLin Yan smiled and glanced at LAN in the rear. \u201cYour teammate is half an acquaintance with my Abyss. Those of us in GH always say that we can do it. We still have to fulfill the friendly match from before. Pingcheng is really far away. Have you bought a return trip for tomorrow?\u201dThen he pointed behind him, \u201cThis is Manager Luo of our team. You can ask him to deal with the reimbursement of travel expenses.\u201dLuo Mo took the captain of ZX\u2019s hand and shook it in a timely manner. He had long experience in the business world and was calm. \u201cYou can look for me at any time.\u201dThe captain of ZX was taken aback. Then his senses returned and his expression became dark. \u201cThere is no need\u2026\u201dLin Yan was very polite. \u201cHow can that be? If I talk about reimbursement then it should be reimbursed!\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to eat? We won\u2019t bother you.\u201d The captain of ZX finished speaking and turned to leave.\u201cThen don\u2019t stay! Go slowly!\u201d Lin Yan turned sideways in an understanding manner and gave them a path.LAN had always been following behind the team silently. The moment the team walked forward, he also followed them. His mental state didn\u2019t look very good. The dark circles under his eyes showed an indescribable depression and he was constantly staring at Chen Yushen with an ugly expression.During this period of time, he had tried very hard to adjust his state but he couldn\u2019t do so under GH\u2019s straightforward targeting. Now the team had discovered he wasn\u2019t in good condition and talked to him privately, ready to make other arrangements for him.The expression in LAN\u2019s eyes became darker and he gritted his teeth unwillingly. He saw that he was about to pass by Chen Yushen and suddenly stopped. He turned back and happened to meet Chen Yushen\u2019s indifferent gaze, which made him feel a bit angry. \u201cAbyss, you won\u2019t be proud for long!\u201dHowever, Chen Yushen just watched him calmly without saying a word.Lin Yan had returned to his sleepy state after finishing. He was about to take everyone to dinner when he heard such a sentence and looked back. The others in ZX wanted to leave quickly. They didn\u2019t expect LAN to suddenly do something and were obviously a bit stunned.They were hesitating over whether to drag him away or not when LAN sneered and continued. \u201cSo what if I lose to you and don\u2019t have a chance to play professionally? Do you think you can be fine after I\u2019m completely destroyed? So what if your team enters the professional league? Don\u2019t forget, there is still someone waiting for you. He\u2026 might\u2019ve let you go the first time but that might not be the case the second time!\u201dSuch words entered his ears and caused Chen Yushen to tremble slightly. That man\u2026He couldn\u2019t help pressing his lips together. He saw that LAN was moving forward hatefully and was frowning when a figure suddenly stopped in front of him. Gu Luo didn\u2019t dare to come out but he grabbed Chen Yushen\u2019s arm tightly from the side.Chen Yushen looked up and could see Jian Ye\u2019s tall back in front of him. On the other side, Bi Yaohua had grabbed LAN\u2019s hands. There was no smile in his eyes but he sincerely expressed his gratitude. \u201cThank you! Thank you ZX for your recognition of us!\u201dLAN thought about how he was going to be transferred to the second team of ZX and how his future was almost certainly ruined. He was full of resentment that he wanted to vent. Now he heard Bi Yaohua\u2019s words and almost didn\u2019t control his emotions. \u201cAre you sick? You don\u2019t understand people? Should I tell you again? Who acknowledged you?\u201dBi Yaohua was indifferent like the person being scolded wasn\u2019t him at all. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say it yourself just now that our team will enter the professional league? I never knew this. So in your ZX\u2019s mind, our GH is actually the well-deserved champions of this variety show? Let\u2019s not talk about your skills in the game. In fact, your vision is just right!\u201dHe didn\u2019t control his voice when speaking. There were players of other teams passing by and they stopped and looked over when they heard the words.The rest of the ZX team, \u201c???\u201dFreestar\u2018We didn\u2019t say that, no! Don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u2019Bi Yaohua looked touched. \u201cI have to say, LAN. You might be technically weak, have a bad personality and you are psychologically frail but you are still very accurate when looking at people. I must thank you for this blessing! Thank you!\u201dDue to his words, LAN almost directly went crazy. His chest moved up and down as he anxiously tried to explain. However, he didn\u2019t know where to start. The more anxious he was, the harder it was to breathe. Finally, his body suddenly shook. The ZX team member behind him jumped forward and hurriedly held him.Bi Yaohua felt relieved after letting go of his mouth. He saw the chaos inside the ZX team and sounded especially concerned. \u201cWell, it is understandable that you are a bit excited after praising us. Still, it doesn\u2019t need to be this way. Right! Speaking of which, I always think that LAN here has a serious anemia problem. Would you like me to help you contact the nearest hospital?\u201dChen Yushen was originally a bit distracted. Now he saw LAN who was so angry that he couldn\u2019t speak and involuntarily smiled. Chen Yushen saw LAN being pulled away by his other teammates and his eyelashes lowered slightly. He had to admit that LAN didn\u2019t say anything wrong just now. The road he had to take had just begun.A hand gently touched his shoulder, pulling Chen Yushen back from his deep thoughts. Lin Yan took him to the restaurant, voice entering his ears. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m starving to death. Let\u2019s hurry and eat.\u201dThe other people cheered. After entering the private room, everyone quickly ordered dishes and ate unceremoniously when the dishes were placed on the table. Everyone had filled their stomach before filming. By this time, they were already starving. They ate like bandits entering a village, leaving nothing behind.Everyone was tired and there was the trouble with the ZX team. They were in no mood for chatting. After eating, they held their phones and briefly took a break.The program\u2019s staff had already informed them. The first episode had a good broadcast effect. Even though the recording had just ended, they wanted to have a better effect this time. Therefore, some shooting highlights would be released to the audience before the official broadcast to continue the popularity of the show.Sure enough, the follow-up photos of when the teams set off to the hotel were released one after another.The headquarters of the Burning Hot League was in Ningcheng. For convenience, most of the professional league bases were also arranged near the outskirts of this city. However, land in this developed city was expensive after all. Many teams in the sub-league could only choose other nearby cities and some were even further away. Therefore, the departure time for each team participating in the program was different.For teams that set off a day earlier, the highlights could be edited more completely. GH\u2019s base was at a distance that could be reached with a short drive so only a few screenshots had been selected so far to satisfy the curiosity of the audience.After all, time was limited and this type of operation was understandable. Then once Gu Luo turned to the photo of his team, he couldn\u2019t help freezing. He stared at one of them and slowly rubbed his eyes.Judging from the background of the photo, it was apparent they were in the car on the way to the hotel. The captain was sitting in the back row. The man next to him was holding a pink, fluffy blanket that didn\u2019t match his image. He leaned his head on the captain\u2019s broad shoulder and slept peacefully. His scattered hair floated in a static arc in the air. It was unknown what he was seeing in his sleep but his mouth was curved in a very shallow and gentle arc.FreestarAt this time, Jing Yuanzhou was looking down slightly. He clearly had a blank expression but due to the warm sunlight leaking through the car window, there was an unprecedented softness.Above the photo was a sentence from the show\u2019s official Weibo: [GH] Captain and coach, journeying together with you.Gu Luo instinctively looked down at the comments area. It wasn\u2019t a surprise to find that it had blown up.6th Anniversary Event Page (Final Submission Date: 15th November)Proofreader: NaoMOBA Terms PagePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was that the beauty of the official photo was too beautiful. Along with the perfect light and shadow processing in the later stages, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s expression inevitably seemed a bit too affectionate.[Who is this? Who is leaning on my husband\u2019s shoulder? GH\u2019s coach?][Fuck fuck fuck, Coach Lin\u2019s looks are really great! The program\u2019s staff is so good. They can do this type of photo!][This inexplicable period of quiet and good feelings\u2026 what is going on?][Why do I have a sudden sense of matching? Please wake up\u2026][I had always thought that Titans was a noble and cold man. Now it seems that he is warm in private!][What does it matter if he is warm or not? Bright people shouldn\u2019t talk secret words. It is ridiculous to me.][This look\u2026 I\u2019m going to melt! When did my male god become like this?][Hey, the coach looks good when asleep. I want to rub my hand along him.][???? Who is that wolf upstairs?][Don\u2019t talk about anything else. I really am convinced about the appearance of the GH team. Regardless of strength, they deserve the name of the e-sport\u2019s boy group.][Damn, look at the multistory building rising up. This is the CP for me!][Sister upstairs, so wet, so wet!]There was an influx of more netizens and some people started thinking about further questions.[So what should this combination be called. The coach\u2019s last name is Lin, right? Yuan Lin CP?][Hey, a CP name isn\u2019t that simple. Let\u2019s have a look at the Parents CP.][Wait?? Why parents?][Hahahaha, I suddenly get it? Isn\u2019t it because the coach and captain of GH are parents of a group of children?][Fuck, this CP is amazing! Everyone always told me that Mom and Dad loves me the most?][Hahahahahahahahah, the beautiful parents are in love? Thank you, here it is!]Gu Luo read over the increasingly enthusiastic comments and couldn\u2019t help pursing his mouth. He glanced back quietly and hesitated for a moment. He wondered if he should look at the expressions of his \u2018parents.\u2019 Originally, this CP combination was okay if it was just superficial business. However, based on what he accidentally heard last time, the coach and captain were obviously already in a relationship.The public\u2019s acceptance of coming out was quite good but in the final analysis, a certain amount of public opinion pressure was inevitable. If the relationship between the two people was really exposed, it was destined to be more stressful for the coach based on the captain\u2019s absolute popularity. Moreover, this was an assumption made on the premise that both parties were ready to expose it.If they didn\u2019t intend to make it public only for it to be shaken out by the program at this time, then the situation\u2026 was obviously a bit more serious.Gu Luo felt a pressure that shouldn\u2019t be put on him at his age and he inevitably thought a lot for his two seniors. Finally, his small eyes firmed up. His fingertips moved across his phone in a sharp manner as he quickly logged into a side account and started to reply to the messages on Weibo one by one.Netizen\u2019s comment: [I didn\u2019t pay attention before but the more I look at the comments, the more I feel they match.]G is Very Powerful: [What nonsense!]Netizen\u2019s comment: [Parents love is real! KSWL!]G is Very Powerful: [You are a ghost!]Netizen\u2019s comment: [Is there anymore sugar?]G is Very Powerful: [No, you want to be beautiful.]Gu Luo was fighting passionately when he heard Lin Yan suddenly ask with some confusion from where he was looking at his phone. \u201cNo, I came all this way. wasn\u2019t I low-key enough?\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked over and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLin Yan leaned to the side and handed his phone to Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cSpeaking of which, the official CP of the two of us shouldn\u2019t interfere with others. Then who is this? What\u2019s the name? Oh, G is Very Powerful\u2026 what a bad name. He is chasing after the comments on Weibo one by one. It is so black. Why do I feel that he seems to have opinions on me rather than the club?\u201dThe moment he heard the ID, Gu Luo\u2019s hand shook. His fingers that were about to press the reply button stopped.He turned his head and saw Lin Yan leaning lazily on Jing Yuanzhou while sighing. \u201cHowever, no matter how back, it can\u2019t stop the fact that my CP is rising. Unexpectedly, the first CP in the club is actually us! The Parents CP? Hah, they can\u2019t figure it out! This thing really needs to be reasonable. How is our dignified Titans like a mother?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was especially easygoing about the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to look at the match.\u201dAs he spoke, he zoomed in on the photo on Weibo. He took a look and clicked to save it. Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help smiling at this person\u2019s actions. He obviously agreed with the sentence. \u201cIt really does look like a good match.\u201dGu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was silent for a moment as he grabbed his hair with his hands. Then he silently quit his Weibo account. At the same time, he made a very firm decision in his heart: this account is abandoned. Go back and register another one!Fortunately, Lin Yan didn\u2019t have much interest in an \u2018ordinary black fan\u2019. After a few casual complaints, he focused on other comments. He watched for a while before assigning tasks to Luo Mo in a satisfied manner. \u201cAh Mo, you are basically in charge of the club\u2019s management now. After going back this time, you should follow up on the operations. The requirements aren\u2019t high. The plan must be given to me within three days. At that time, the business that we haven\u2019t had time to start should be opened\u2026\u201dThen his eyes swept over the other people in the box and he smiled. \u201cWell, it is time to start preparing for business.\u201dNow the overall momentum of the club was just right, especially with the heat of Burning Hot Assembly. Putting aside his identity as a coach, Lin Yan was the owner of the club and couldn\u2019t let go of such a golden opportunity. It was ironic to say that the current e-sports field was no longer enough to survive just based on the game.Strength was a must and exposure was also necessary. Team marketing should start from him leading by example.In the second half of the meal, the style in the box inexplicably turned into Lin Yan\u2019s business class. The team didn\u2019t find it easy to get through to the end. They heard they could go and immediately left for their hotel rooms without looking back. Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou also returned to their room.\u201cI\u2019ll take a shower first,\u201d Jing Yuanzhou said as he opened his suitcase and took out a set of clothes.The moment he turned around, he saw Lin Yan\u2019s slender arm stretching out and blocking his way. He couldn\u2019t help being confused. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dLin Yan slightly raised his eyebrow. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Shouldn\u2019t I be asking you this?\u201dAs he spoke, his eyes skimmed over Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s blank face. \u201cIf Captain Jing is unwilling to engage in such false business then it doesn\u2019t matter if you tell me directly. Remember, we signed a contract and I promised that I wouldn\u2019t force you to do anything. So if you feel uncomfortable, there is really no need to do anything against your will.\u201dLin Yan had already noticed it in the box. Jing Yuanzhou might not have said anything but the change in his expression precisely entered Lin Yan\u2019s eyes. Most of the people in the e-sports field were men. For many teams, this type of business between men was inevitable to satisfy the team\u2019s fans.Lin Yan was familiar with all the operations in the industry. He was accustomed to it even if this type of thing fell on himself. However, he had forgotten to ask for Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s opinion.Looking back now, during his time in the BK team, Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t have any scandals. Perhaps this person really didn\u2019t like to get involved in this aspect of things. It might also play a large role in BK\u2019s desire for him to retire and get a new recruit.If the captain didn\u2019t take the lead in business then the degree of momentum would definitely be much lower. However, this wasn\u2019t a point that Lin Yan was firm on. Such operations were inevitable but in the final analysis, it wasn\u2019t everything. In his mind, in front of absolute strength, all other factors could be compromised.Lin Yan took advantage of the fact that no follow-up plans had been arranged yet and waited for a statement. The moment Jing Yuanzhou said he didn\u2019t want to get involved, Lin Yan would definitely kill the \u2018Parents CP\u2019 in the cradle without hesitation.Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t expected Lin Yan to suddenly say this at this time. The even more surprising thing was that it was really terrifying when this person\u2019s air suddenly became sharp. His gaze lowered slightly. The face that was close at hand was still as bright and beautiful as when he first saw it.The emotions in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes changed slightly and he couldn\u2019t help sighing inwardly. This person was really keen but it was a pity that the point he understood was thousands of kilometres away. Why was he unwilling to carry out a false business with Lin Yan? If possible, it would be better to just delete the word \u2018business.\u2019Neither of them spoke for a while.Then Jing Yuanzhou suddenly asked, \u201cYou only asked for my thoughts. What about yourself?\u201dLin Yan was slightly taken aback by such a sentence. \u201cWhat about me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou stared at him. Then after a pause, he inquired, \u201cWhat do you think about operating a CP with a man?\u201dLin Yan thought about it. \u201cIt\u2019s just the normal team\u2019s official business. What else can I think? Now fans can take this set and it is a reasonable use of their conditions. Since it can promote the development of the club, why not conform to the market?\u201dSo the reason why he was willing to open business wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t exclude the same sex. It was because he only considered it a market factor. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mood was complicated as he replied, \u201cI see. I will cooperate with all the business contents. Just do what you want.\u201dLin Yan glanced at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s expression. \u201cIf you can\u2019t accept a male CP then there is no need to force it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not reluctant. I am also very happy to be with you in this \u2018male\u2019 CP.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou started into the other person\u2019s eyes and his deep eyes seemed to swallow up Lin Yan completely. His tone was as calm as always. \u201cLet Manager Luo do the business plan and I will unconditionally cooperate with all his work.\u201dHe took two steps closer as he spoke. In this atmosphere, Lin Yan instinctively retreated. The space was narrow and he was pushed against the wall with these two steps.TL Note: So submissions for my celebration event are now closed!!For now, voting isn\u2019t open yet.

    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 33.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJing Yuanzhou lowered his eyes slightly. \u201cThe only requirement is that if the fake play is really done, it can be regarded as a work injury. Lin Yan, shouldn\u2019t you be responsible for me?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s mind didn\u2019t return for a while and his head was blank. He instinctively replied, \u201cWork injury\u2026 of course\u2026 I must be responsible.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. I have no other problems.\u201d The corners of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth finally rose a bit and his breath rubbed against the tip of Lin Yan\u2019s nose. \u201cThen Lin Yan, if there is nothing else, can I go take a shower?\u201dLin Yan paused. \u201c\u2026Of course.\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed silently and his hand skimmed over Lin Yan\u2019s shoulder. He opened the bathroom door and walked in like this without saying anything. After a while, there was the faint sound of water from the bathroom.Lin Yan leaned against the wall for a long time without moving. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s playful expression from just now flashed through his mind. Then after realizing what he was responsible for, his ears turned red. The sound of his fast heartbeat mixed with the sound of water and he couldn\u2019t help inwardly cursing, \u2018Fuck, it really isn\u2019t a loss!\u2019Lin Yan gradually straightened up, went to the bed and fell down on it. At this moment, he seriously suspected that this person\u2019s unhappy appearance was deliberately shown to him. At least, Jing Yuanzhou was obviously quite happy on the last move.Lin Yan lay on the bed and stared up at the ceiling for a while. It wasn\u2019t until the phone rang that his thoughts were interrupted. He pulled out his phone to take a look and his eyes flickered. He restrained the lazy expression on his face. \u201cHey Brother Wei, I was waiting for you to call. How is the matter I asked you to investigate before?\u201dOn the other end of the phone, a man\u2019s outspoken voice was heard. \u201cIt is something that Xiao Lin requested. How can I not do my best? Since I have contacted you, there will naturally be results!\u201dThe speaker was called Xie Wei. Soon after Chen Yushen entered the team, Lin Yan contacted this Brother Wei to help him investigate the things in the training camp. Lin Yan heard there was finally news and his eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cOh? So what happened?\u201dXie Wei replied, \u201cI have been investigating for a long time. In fact, there were clues about the jumping off the building case back then but it was suppressed at the time. Finally, it ended this way. If you want to force it then it isn\u2019t difficult to bring these things up again. It depends on the results you want in the end. If you really want to be at ease, it isn\u2019t a problem to catch these people and make them spend a few years in prison.\u201dLin Yan gave a low laugh. \u201cI said that the matter was really noisy so why did nothing happen in the end? Sure enough, there was someone behind the scenes?\u201dXie Wei was silent for a moment. \u201cThe specific situation should be more complicated. I only heard that it was the Peng family from Huaicheng. However, based on the information available so far, there is no evidence to prove that the younger son of the Peng family also participated in it. This is the only place that I feel strange.\u201dLin Yan frowned. \u201cDid someone destroy the evidence?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like that.\u201dLin Yan thought about it. \u201cThank you for your hard work, Brother Wei. I understand the general situation. I will discuss it with the team members and decide what to do. Then I will contact you.\u201d\u201cOkay, no problem.\u201d Xie Wei had investigated the events of that year and naturally understood the violence committed by Chen Yushen was related to the incident. \u201cThis decision really requires careful consideration from the person involved. As far as I know, the e-sports field is relatively strict about violent incidents. The reason the one in your team wasn\u2019t held accountable that year was also due to the Peng family. Otherwise, in accordance with the rules of your circle, it wouldn\u2019t have ended with just being expelled from the youth training camp. If you really want to dig this matter up then it might be inevitable for him to be involved again.\u201dAt this point, Lin Yan fell into thought again.The strangest thing about this case was that on one hand, the Peng family suppressed the investigation into the cause of the suicide. On the other hand, they also mediated the investigation into the violence. The Peng family was both the good guys and the bad guys and it was unknown what their purpose was.Lin Yan expressed his sincere gratitude to Xie Wei. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will discuss it carefully. I also believe that he will make a choice he won\u2019t regret. In short, thank you for this matter!\u201dXie Wei laughed openly. \u201cYou are welcome!\u201dJust then, the bathroom door was opened from the inside. The slight movement made Lin Yan raise his head and he just happened to see Jing Yuanzhou coming out from inside. He had just finished taking a shower and the man was shrouded by faint water vapor. A few drops of water dripped from his hair and fell along the distinct arc of his neck before finally landing on the towel hanging around his neck.Jing Yuanzhou noticed that Lin Yan was on the phone and didn\u2019t say a word. He just picked up a towel and wiped his still wet hair. Such an action seemed careless but the faint fragrance of the shower gel was unknowingly scattered around every corner of the room.Lin Yan\u2019s gaze stopped for a moment and his Adam\u2019s apple moved silently.On the other side of the phone, Xie Wei didn\u2019t hear any words and he spoke angrily, \u201cSpeaking of which, how long has it been since you\u2019ve met us! The brothers miss you! Since our last gathering in the bar street, Chang Lexin keeps talking about you. That playboy isn\u2019t even in the mood to find a small boyfriend. We almost thought he is lovesick.\u201dHis voice wasn\u2019t loud but in such a quiet room, it was unusually clear. Jing Yuanzhou heard the words bar street and some memories emerged, causing Jing Yuanzhou to look back.Lin Yan felt his scalp tingling slightly from such a gaze. He cleared his throat and shifted things in another direction. \u201cBrother Wei, don\u2019t tease me. Who is Chang Lexin? He is a bisexual who loves all men and women. If you tell me that humanity is going extinct then I would believe it more than him being lovesick.\u201dThe gaze on his back was so clear that he inwardly shrank back.Xie Wei was amused by Lin Yan\u2019s words. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t joke with you anymore. Say hello to me when you are free. I will bring everyone together for a gathering.\u201d\u201cYes, I will contact you when my side is done.\u201dBrother Wei laughed and didn\u2019t say anything else as he hung up the phone. Lin Yan looked down at the dark phone screen before glancing back. He saw that Jing Yuanzhou was sitting on the sofa not far away and their eyes happened to meet. \u201cThe chat is over?\u201d\u201c\u2026Hmm.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t know why but he inexplicably had a guilty conscience. Then thinking about it carefully, something didn\u2019t feel right. Why was he guilty?Lin Yan frowned. Jing Yuanzhou sneered at the change in expression and didn\u2019t bring up the bar street he heard in the conversation just now. Instead, he said indifferently, \u201cIf you want to open up business with me then you shouldn\u2019t be too busy with other people.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWait, he and Brother Wei didn\u2019t seem to say anything just now, right? What was with these waves?!The next day was another day of program recording.Compared to the just concluded second episode, there was no elimination process in the third episode. The overall process was mainly entertainment interactions so relatively speaking, it seemed much easier. Yes, from the perspective of most people, it was \u2018easy.\u2019However, once everyone in GH got into the car to head to the venue, they saw Lin Yan sitting in the back and their drowsiness instantly disappeared. They immediately looked awake. Bi Yaohua wasn\u2019t afraid. He even dared to lean back in his chair to get closer. Then he cautiously asked in a voice he thought Lin Yan couldn\u2019t hear, \u201cCaptain Jing, what\u2019s wrong with the coach??\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t look too happy. His face didn\u2019t have much expression as he handed over the information. \u201cTake a look at this. It\u2019s today\u2019s recording process.\u201dBi Yaohua originally wanted to ask further when he saw Lin Yan\u2019s cold gaze. He didn\u2019t dare say anything else and immediately took the information. The others were curious about today and came over. The content arrangements in the first section were all normal. It was as they guessed previously. A representative from each team would get to interact with the representative of the professional players.Jian Ye patted with Gu Luo on the shoulder. \u201cPlaying with Luni is a rare opportunity! You are both mid-laners. Do you want to go up and compare?\u201dGu Luo was also a bit eager to try it and he glanced at the back row. \u201cWait for Coach to arrange it.\u201dLin Yan answered indifferently, \u201cDon\u2019t wait. I was going to let you play anyway. Luni might mainly take the team battle route but there is no need to talk about his strength. There is no harm in letting you try it against him.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s eyes lit up slightly. \u201cThank you, Coach.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t continue to talk. He leaned back and closed his eyes. In fact, he had been in a good mood when he got up this morning. After all, he just got the news from Brother Wei that the mess that happened in the youth training camp two years ago could finally have a result. Originally, as long as he went back to the base after today\u2019s recording and had a good chat with Chen Yushen, then he could start to arrange the follow-up matters with peace of mind.After dealing with this incident, he would contact Chang Lexin again to squeeze out some media resources. Then the Parents combination with Jing Yuanzhou could be properly implemented. No matter how he looked at it, everything could be called extremely beautiful.Then the program\u2019s staff sent him the program schedule. The several people in the front row finally discovered another highlight of today\u2019s recording.Bi Yaohua murmured, \u201cWait\u2026 the latter event is a mixed team fight with the coach and the players?\u201dThen he looked at the back row with amazement. \u201cCoach, does this mean you will play as well?\u201dJian Ye exclaimed, \u201cThe coach will play! Coach, what position do you want to play? Do you want to play support? I can let go!\u201dGu Luo also joined in. \u201cCoach, you can play the mid-laner. The mid-lane is convenient for output!\u201dChen Yushen suggested, \u201cJungler is better with rhythm.\u201dHowever, Lin Yan heard these words and his mouth tightened. He squeezed out a few annoyed words. \u201cShut up!\u201dThe four of them fell silent and instinctively looked at Jing Yuanzhou. Jing Yuanzhou noticed their gazes and his tone was light. \u201cBe quiet. Don\u2019t make your coach angry.\u201dThe humble players of GH, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSo they said something wrong again. Wronged.Voting is now open. You can see all the details at the voting information page and vote using the two forms provided below.

    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe recording of the show had progressed this far and the remaining four teams were QU, IBB, KON and GH.Among them, QU and IBB were both top teams in the secondary league and were basically just one step away from the professional league. In terms of strength, they weren\u2019t on the same level as the other four teams that had been eliminated.In contrast, KON was a bit weaker but the performance of this middle-ranked team was often linked to their state on the day. It wasn\u2019t guaranteed that they wouldn\u2019t suddenly perform abnormally on the spot. This unknown factor was why they became a dark horse in the season.Generally speaking, the second half of the variety show was much more serious than the previous episodes. It was precisely in consideration of the fierce battles that would occur in the next phase that the program had arranged a special event between the two phases of elimination. They would use an entertainment game to relieve the tension.There was nothing wrong with this arrangement. The key problem lay in the coach mixing in with the players. This was obviously very unfriendly to Lin Yan\u2019s special situation.After getting out of the car, the GH team followed the staff to the lounge to do styling. Lin Yan let the stylist casually fiddle with him. Then he took a pack of cigarettes, stuffed it into his pocket and turned to walk out.After a while, Jing Yuanzhou also stood up. Once the door of the lounge shook and closed again, the people who were left behind couldn\u2019t help exchanging looks.\u201cI say, do you think the appearance of the captain and the coach is a bit strange?\u201d Jian Ye might have the appearance of a tough guy but his mind was extremely sharp. He raised his eyebrow and wondered, \u201cIs it so serious? Is there a problem with the funds of our club?\u201dLuo Mo was the manager of the team and had stayed to monitor the styling situation. Now he couldn\u2019t help spitting out, \u201cDon\u2019t say unlucky things!\u201dHow could it be so easily broken when backed by the capital chain of the Lin Group?Gu Luo instinctively made a connection with an emotional problem but he considered his own survival and didn\u2019t dare say anything. He lowered his head and just fiddled with his phone.Bi Yaohua glanced around and sighed quietly. \u201cIn short, the captain said it before. Today, we will be quiet and won\u2019t make the coach angry.\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s lips twitched. \u201c\u2026Brother Trash Talk, you can be quiet first.\u201dThe conversation in the lounge was blocked by the closed door. The corridor outside was quiet. Lin Yan leaned against a corner wall with a cigarette in his mouth. He raised his head when he heard the sound of footsteps and saw Jing Yuanzhou who had followed him. He couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cWhy are you chasing me so tightly? Are you afraid I can\u2019t do it?\u201dHe might have been a bit upset but his expression was casual. It was obvious that his mentality adjustment wasn\u2019t bad.Jing Yuanzhou saw this expression and guessed the final decision. \u201cAre you ready to play?\u201d\u201cOr should I tell the program\u2019s staff that we won\u2019t participate in the entertainment game?\u201d The smoke blew out as he spoke. \u201cThe liquidated damages and other things are trivial but this variety show is originally the best shot for GH to gain attention. If we participate in one less event then it is unknown how many shots we will lose. The loss is too big!\u201dThen he sighed emotionally. \u201cIf someone tells me to let go like this then I am really reluctant.\u201dJing Yuanzhou asked, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dLin Yan told the truth. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHowever, I should have confidence in myself. I will see when the time comes. Perhaps I can really endure it?\u201d He looked up at the ceiling and half-joked, \u201cHowever, if I really can\u2019t hold it then you will have to work harder as four.\u201dRegarding his PTSD, Jing Yuanzhou was the only person in the world who knew the details. Therefore, Lin Yan was prepared for Jing Yuanzhou trying to persuade him. Unexpectedly, Jing Yuanzhou just lowered his eyes slightly and asked, \u201cHow much time?\u201dLin Yan slowly blew out the cigarette smoke and his entire body was covered in smoke. He was slightly stunned when he heard this. \u201cHow much time for what?\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked up. \u201cHow much time can you play in a five person team battle?\u201dFreestar\u201cThis\u2026 I haven\u2019t tested it precisely.\u201d Lin Yan spoke after some time. He pondered on it carefully. \u201cAside from the influence of some on-the-spot factors, the first 20 minutes is definitely okay. If I force myself, I can probably hold on for 30 minutes. If you arrange some intermission time between the two games then I can probably extend it for another 10 minutes?\u201dJing Yuanzhou nodded. \u201cThat is 40 minutes. We have to win two games within 40 minutes.\u201dLin Yan\u2019s eyes slightly shook before he leaned against the wall and looked at Jing Yuanzhou with a playful expression. \u201cTitans, Jing Yuanzhou, do you think you are cutting cabbage? The remaining three teams aren\u2019t like the third-rate teams encountered before. Even the weakest KON isn\u2019t a fuel-efficient lamp. You say that we can win two games in 40 minutes. Is this because you have been with me for too long that you are becoming more arrogant?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it good to be arrogant?\u201d Jing Yuanzhou smiled. He ignored Lin Yan\u2019s ridicule and threw the question back. \u201cWhy? Does Coach Lin think it can\u2019t be done?\u201dLin Yan put out the cigarette and gave a low laugh.He finally spoke humble words. \u201cIt is easy to talk. In any case, I have to do it so let\u2019s try it.\u201dThere was a short pre-match preparation before the staff came to the lounge to remind everyone that it was the start of the recording. The audience at the recording site was already ready a long time ago. It would officially start when the members of the four teams arrived.The first part of this episode was the challenge of the professional players. After all, Luni was the top mid-laner in the professional league. Not surprisingly, the four teams all sent their mid-laners. The challengers entered the field one by one and Gu Luo couldn\u2019t help sweating as he waited in his seat.Next to him, Jian Ye noticed his behaviour and looked over. \u201cWhy, are you nervous?\u201dGu Luo nodded. \u201cYes, a little bit.\u201dJian Ye placed a hand on the small shoulder. His strength was high and it almost directly crushed Gu Luo. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, go to the end! Brother Gun will always be with you!\u201dGu Luo\u2019s small body couldn\u2019t help shaking slightly. \u201cThank you, Brother.\u201dFreestarThe current challenger was IBB\u2019s mid-laner. After a moment of confrontation, he lost to Luni without any surprises. There was polite applause from the audience and then it was GH\u2019s turn. Gu Luo took a deep breath and stood up. He subconsciously glanced at Lin Yan before leaving.Lin Yan looked up. He knew what Gu Luo wanted to ask and slightly raised his eyebrow. \u201cPlay as you like and do your best.\u201dGu Luo went to the field to prepare. During the debugging of his equipment, the host interviewed Luni. \u201cAs of now, players from three teams have challenged you. Luni, based on your own subjective feelings, which team has the stronger mid-laner?\u201dSince his debut, Luni had always been known for his steady style of playing and he was ridiculed by some sunspots for it.This type of interview naturally wasn\u2019t difficult for the experienced Luni to deal with and he didn\u2019t show anything from his official tone. \u201cThere is no special standard definition for the position of mid-laner. Each player has a certain style and they follow the team\u2019s style. Some teams are conservative and some are aggressive. There is no good or bad.\u201dThen he gently lifted his bangs and the small ponytail behind him also shook. \u201cWhat we did just now was an ordinary solo game. Victory or defeat doesn\u2019t say anything. It is irresponsible to define players just based on this. After all, Burning Hot is a 5v5 team battle. A player\u2019s existence doesn\u2019t depend on his ability to clear the lane. It should be his contribution to the team.\u201dIt sounded like a lot of words but in fact, there was no real content.The host kept a professional smile on his face. \u201cYou are worthy of being one of the top 10 professional players of the year. Luni, you have your own opinion on the position of mid-laner.\u201dIn the player seats, Bi Yaohua heard this and spoke in a straightforward manner, \u201cSometimes, I am really convinced by the level of these professional players to speak. Obviously, they think that the opponents are weak but they still talk in such a high-sound manner. Is it interesting? Solo doesn\u2019t mean anything but who doesn\u2019t know Luni\u2019s combat style? The old jack of all trades in the team! He makes up for any shortcomings and is indeed the key in team battles. However, when it comes to laning, his record for single kills in the professional league is very low. They can\u2019t even beat this type of tortoise-style mid-laner in a solo match and are obviously too weak. Does it need to be so exaggerated?\u201dJian Ye had actually wanted to say something a long time ago and he finally couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cBB, tell me honestly, have you been secretly in love with Luni for a long time? Why do I feel like you are a black fan?\u201dBi Yaohua gave a smile that wasn\u2019t a smile. \u201cI have many people I\u2019ve blackened. Do you want to hear about the others? The list I have is guaranteed to be a sumptuous banquet.\u201dJian Ye, \u201c\u2026You are still the awesome one.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had been listening to the side and he suddenly spoke, \u201cYou are taking Luni too lightly.\u201dBi Yaohua disagreed. \u201cCaptain, I know the two of you have a good relationship but Luni\u2019s inaction during the laning period is recognized by the entire league. Can you deny this?\u201d\u201cYes, it is true but\u2026\u201d Jing Yuanzhou raised his head and glanced at the big screen. \u201cOn the contrary, this proves his terrible laning ability even more.\u201dBi Yaohua was stunned when he heard the words. He didn\u2019t understand at first but then there was a flash of light in his mind. It was true that Luni rarely completed single kills on the field but likewise, he almost never lost his head or fell behind in economy.Bi Yaohua\u2019s eyes flashed as he thought up to here. He looked up and the expression on his face finally became a bit serious.At this time, Gu Luo was finally ready to play. The last solo entertainment game officially began!Jian Ye was nervous. \u201cWho do you think will win?\u201dJing Yuanzhou might\u2019ve said those words just now but Bi Yaohua still chose to stand firm. \u201cI bet on Gloy!\u201dNo one knew better than them how fierce Gu Luo was when it came to laning. What if Luni was the top mid-laner in the league? Bi Yaohua had absolute trust in Gu Luo when it came to laning ability.Eight minutes later, the game ended and Luni won.Gu Luo was obviously still immersed in the game just now when he returned to the player seats. His face wasn\u2019t frustrated due to defeat. Rather, the light in his eyes had become brighter. \u201cCaptain, Coach, Luni is really good!\u201dThe final result of this solo game was the low health Luni\u2019s reverse kill.It might seem like a bitter struggle to onlookers but only he, as the player, could better understand the situation. It might seem like a slight difference to onlookers but there were actually huge gaps in the handling of countless details.Bi Yaohua was still thinking about the confrontation just now.Jing Yuanzhou noticed his rare silence and spoke calmly, \u201cThe players who can play in the professional league often make some compromises for the team. These compromises allow them to stand at the top and see better but they never lose sight of their original edge. It isn\u2019t just Luni. Remember every name that appears in the professional area. They are very strong.\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved slightly.Jing Yuanzhou said, \u201cHowever, I can\u2019t completely blame you for being confused by Luni\u2019s appearance. He is an old man. He hides his strength well and pretends to be weak. He has cheated many people in the circle and poisoned them.\u201dBi Yaohua was silent for a moment and reflected on himself very simply. \u201c\u2026Captain, don\u2019t say it. I was blind before.\u201dThe Trash Talk King was always straightforward when scolding, regardless of whether it was the enemy or himself.Lin Yan hadn\u2019t paid attention to the solo games just now. He used this time to make a new meeting schedule for today. He heard their conversation and slightly raised his eyes.Luni was indeed the top mid-laner in the league. He used good tricks to hide but in terms of strength, he was no different from Jing Yuanzhou. Lin Yan still remembered that in the original text, it took Gloy a whole year to drag Luni down from the altar. From then on, he opened the \u2018legend of the great demon king\u2019 that made everyone feel frightened.He wrote the last stroke on the paper and slowly sighed with relief. The initial lineup for the fast flow had basically been completed.The first entertainment event had ended. The host interviewed with Luni with a few more words before switching to a cosplay performance. After the performance, the important team match with the coach and players would begin.This time, the matches were decided based on the voting results of the netizens \u2018two teams I want to see fight.\u2019 The GH team\u2019s fans had strong beliefs and chose IBB, one of the two strong teams. Lin Yan sincerely thanked the netizens while making tactical arrangements with the players. \u201cAbyss, you take a break. I will play.\u201dPlaying jungler was really the best choice to drive the rhythm of the entire field.Chen Yushen certainly had no problem. \u201cOkay.\u201dLin Yan continued, \u201cGun Zai, you go with me the entire time. Gloy, clear the soldiers quickly and prepare to invade the opponent\u2019s field of view with me at any time.\u201dJian Ye and Gu Luo exclaimed, \u201cUnderstood!\u201dBi Yaohua waited but didn\u2019t hear Lin Yan mentioning him. He couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cCoach, what about me?\u201dLin Yan was silent for a moment. \u201cBB, I will give you a task.\u201d\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cIt is simple.\u201dFreestarAt this seemingly stern expression, Bi Yaohua became rarely serious. \u201cCoach, just give me a command!\u201dLin Yan\u2019s words were extremely cautious like the final entrustment before a long journey. \u201cDuring, the, game, play, more, and, don\u2019t, talk.\u201dBi Yaohua, \u201c???\u201dAfter a moment of silence, the others reacted. \u201cPfft\u2014!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 47": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 35.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere were four teams and a total of two matches. GH and IBB were scheduled to play second.Lin Yan considered it twice and just in case, he took advantage of the time when the first two teams were going on stage to talk to the staff next to him. He said in advance that he might disappear after the match.The director team\u2019s attitude toward him was quite polite.After all, Lin Yan wasn\u2019t only GH\u2019s coach. He was also the owner of the GH Club and the sponsor of the variety show. The director\u2019s team might not know what he was doing later but they didn\u2019t ask anything specific. There was just a brief discussion and they said they would make the corresponding arrangements.Everything was done properly. Lin Yan returned to the player seats and continued to watch the match on the field. The two teams currently playing were QU and KON. The coaches of the two teams had chosen to replace the support position.After all, there was specialization in the industry. If the coach\u2019s operation wasn\u2019t as detailed as a serious player then using the support that was more focused on the overall situation was indeed the best choice.It might only be an entertainment game but according to the previous performance of the staff, today\u2019s victory or defeat would have a high probability of affecting the grouping for the next elimination.This BO3 was very tense. It wasn\u2019t until the third game that QU won against KON with a narrow margin of 2:1.The host invited the players from the two teams to the centre of the field for the post-match interviews while the staff led the players of the other two teams to prepare for the match. Lin Yan sat down and familiarised himself with the keyboard. He picked up the headphones and placed it to his ear. After adjusting the volume briefly, he hung it back around his neck.There was an unprecedented silence in GH\u2019s team voice chat. This situation made Gu Luo a bit uncomfortable. \u201cI don\u2019t know why but I always feel there is a lack of competitive atmosphere today.\u201dFreestarJian Ye glanced at the dying Bi Yaohua next to him and couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s because Brother Trash Talk has lost his soul.\u201dJing Yuanzhou tried out the microphone and was unmoved. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be quiet.\u201dBi Yaohua looked up and opened his mouth to say something. Then he glanced at Lin Yan who had an unknown expression and closed his mouth. Finally, he silently opened a document on the computer desktop and started typing. [End the afternoon match early, please.][I don\u2019t know what will happen to IBB after the game but BB will really be closed off.][Having said that, the coach on the other side isn\u2019t on the same level as our Brother Yan at first glance. It is hard to justify it if we don\u2019t crush them.][Today, I must fight with IBB to see who is the copycat.][Oh, I typed so many words. Can you react a little bit? Have you seen it?]Jian Ye and Luo Mo were shoulder to shoulder and shaking with laughter.Lin Yan also read the words and then looked at Bi Yaohua like he was a fool. \u201cI just told you not to talk during the match. You don\u2019t have to shut your microphone before the match.\u201dFreestarBi Yaohua, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe sighed for a long time and didn\u2019t bother with this problem anymore. He just felt that his soul had been released for a short time. \u201cI was really suffocating to death! I\u2019m telling you, I actually wanted to fight IBB for a long time. The origins can be traced back to a long time ago. I still remember when I was just a fledgling little streamer. From time to time, a wave of people would flood my live broadcast room and scold me severely. Initially, I didn\u2019t understand the reason. Later, I found out they were angry because IBB lost the match! Those broken people said that the team is called IBB and I named myself BB. If I wanted to steal some of IBB\u2019s attention then I have to bear with the aftermath. Listen, are these the words of a human?\u201dHe recalled the spectacular scene at the time and the others couldn\u2019t help laughing.Gu Luo asked curiously, \u201cWhat happened then?\u201d\u201cLater?\u201d Bi Yaohua laughed. \u201cThey were naturally all scolded by me! How can they jump in front of this BB? I taught them how to lie down.\u201dJian Ye sincerely admired it. \u201cThe Trash Talk King is too amazing!\u201dBi Yaohua originally wanted to say something else but he heard the referee next to them signal that the match was about to start. It was as if silent mode was instantly switched on. There was no more sound. They didn\u2019t know from when but his switching between these two extreme states was so smooth, it made people feel distressed.There was the host\u2019s announcement and the first game officially began.Lin Yan put on the headphones at the referee\u2019s reminder and started to arrange the lineup. In order to heat up the recording of the upcoming semi-finals, the program had specifically invited two official commentators from the professional league, Brother Rabbit Hat and Cry Cry. They would give a live explanation for the entertainment match along with Luni.FreestarSeeing the BP section start, the commentator Brother Rabbit Hat discovered the difference from the previous match. \u201cIt seems the coaches of GH and IBB are very confident in their own strength! The GH replacement is actually responsible for the jungler position that drives the rhythm of the game while IBB\u2019s coach has chosen the position of shooter.\u201d\u201cI feel that both sides are risky.\u201d Commentator Cry Cry said. \u201cThe jungler position is very important. If GH\u2019s coach fails to drive the rhythm then it is very easy for the team to fall into a passive situation. On IBB\u2019s side, GH\u2019s bottom lane shooter is BB after all. The coach will have to withstand the pressure and not have his line of soldiers collapse or the development of the output position is limited. This isn\u2019t a good thing for team battles.\u201dHere, Cry Cry threw the conversation over to someone else. \u201cLuni, you have participated in this show several times. According to your current understanding, which of the two teams are you more optimistic about?\u201dShe originally thought that Luni would continue his usual way of evasive answering. Unexpectedly, Luni smiled slightly and replied, \u201cIt is naturally GH. After all, that side has Titans. Anyone who has faced him knows how difficult that person is.\u201dBrother Rabbit Hat wanted to make fun of Luni\u2019s reply when he saw that the lineup of the two sides had been selected and he immediately returned his attention to the field. \u201cOkay, the first game is getting started. Let\u2019s take a look at the lineup arrangements of both sides. Oh, IBB is using their most common tactical system.\u201dThe commentator Cry Cry continued, \u201cIt seems the new team GH still isn\u2019t familiar with this opponent. They actually gave IBB such a complete hero system. This is destined to be a hard fight. As for the lineup selected by GH, uh\u2026\u201dBrother Rabbit Hat was silent for a moment after seeing GH\u2019s lineup allocation. Eventually, he made a final evaluation with some hesitation. \u201cThis lineup is too\u2026 too early?!\u201dUsually, a team would make such a strong lineup if they had absolute confidence in their own strength. However, the situation on the field was always changing rapidly. Even if a team wanted to gain an absolute advantage in the early stages of the game, they still needed one or two mid or late stage heroes in case of forced delays.Now, aside from the healing support chosen by Jian Ye, the other four members of GH chose pure early, strong suppression output heroes. Such a lineup let everyone know that GH was ready to live or die within 20 minutes.FreestarOnce IBB dragged the timeout for 20 minutes, there would be no chance of a comeback for GH unless they had already achieved a complete crushing. It was precisely due to this reason that after discovering such a wonderful lineup, the official commentators launched a tactical discussion. They didn\u2019t say it explicitly but the audience could understand more or less. They all felt that GH\u2019s tactics were a bit overconfident.IBB\u2019s fans were somewhat unhappy after hearing this. They felt that their own team was being taken too lightly and bursts of cheers were once again heard. They could only hope that IBB would teach this unfathomable new team a lesson.In the beginning of the game, the jungle was an indispensable point of conflict and this game was no exception. No one thought that just after the game started, GH would use practical actions to silence everyone.[First Blood!][Double kill!]By the time the audience regained their minds, they saw two figures leaping away after completing the kill. All the heads had fallen on Lin Yan and his economy rose by a lot in an instant.He returned to his own territory to clean up the wave of monsters in the jungle and didn\u2019t worry about going to help others clear the line. He directly entered the grass of the river and went around to the opponent\u2019s jungle with the support.The jungler on the opposite side happened to be resurrected again. Before he had time to enjoy the experience given by the monsters, he looked up and saw two people emerging from the grass. He couldn\u2019t help letting out a loud curse.Lin Yan\u2019s route could be called very tricky. He perfectly avoided the eyes of IBB. There were no precautions and it was too late for others to come to support. IBB\u2019s jungler was killed twice in a row and the entire jungle area had collapsed completely.FreestarLin Yan glanced at the statistics on the economic panel and simply declared, \u201cTheir jungler has been abandoned.\u201dThen he signaled to the next lane, \u201cBB, pay attention. They will probably go to you with the next resurrection.\u201dBi Yaohua paused as he was opening his mouth. Finally, he made an exclamation mark on the map to indicate he understood. Lin Yan gave the reminder but didn\u2019t mean to stay and help. He walked on the road in a very assured manner. Calculating the time, the mobs in the jungle area on the upper half of IBB\u2019s map should\u2019ve been refreshed.The commentator Brother Rabbit Hat had been amazed since the game started. \u201cThe overall vision of GH\u2019s coach is simply amazing! This is treating IBB\u2019s jungle area as his own home!\u201dCommentator Cry Cry could see both sides from a god\u2019s perspective. He saw IBB\u2019s jungler resurrecting and heading straight to the bottom lane with his support, causing him to sigh regretfully. \u201cIBB\u2019s mid-laner is in danger.\u201dThe moment he spoke, Lin Yan cleared the wild area and suddenly emerged from the rear with his own support. He directly blocked the retreat of IBB\u2019s mid-laner. The IBB single player ran away in a hurry but it was too late. His head was taken.At the same time, due to Lin Yan\u2019s advance warning, Bi Yaohua was prepared and escaped from the three person team while also killing the support. The continuous killings made the audience a bit bewildered. Then new good news appeared from GH\u2019s top lane.[The enemy tower is destroyed!]The distracted Lin Yan finally looked away from the road and wasn\u2019t stingy with his praise. \u201cTitans, so handsome!\u201dDriven by the rhythm of the jungler, it could be said that GH was blossoming all over the map. Everyone was so reassured about Jing Yuanzhou that they forgot to pay attention to the relatively stable road. No one thought that the defense tower would be directly destroyed with so little effort.It was only now that the director remembered to do the replay. He found that although there were no heads, IBB\u2019s top lane player had been forced back to the city three times. Meanwhile, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s health was still maintained above the safety line.This was already an absolute crushing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have never seen him play so fiercely in the professional league matches!\u201dIt had to be said that from the start to the present time, Jing Yuanzhou really did feel different from his fundamentally stable style in the BK period. Luni\u2019s eyes fell on the figure on the road and he slightly frowned.However, if someone was to ask him about the specific difference then he couldn\u2019t say. It was like he was completely unleashing some unknown power.Lin Yan saw everything and a faint smile flashed in his eyes. He glanced at the game duration and took a deep breath. \u201cGloy, get ready to follow me.\u201dGu Luo quickly took away a wave of soldiers that had just arrived. Then he responded and hurried to complete the meeting. Lin Yan led his teammate along an S-shaped route without looking back. They had just emerged from the grass when they happened to run into the jungler and mid-laner attacking the elemental monster in the jungle.Brother Rabbit Hat was shocked. \u201cHow did he know IBB would come to get the buff?\u201dLuni shook his head. \u201cIBB has exploded, completely exploded.\u201dThey had previously analyzed it. GH had taken an early stage lineup. If they didn\u2019t get the advantage as soon as possible then they were destined to be weak in the middle and late stages. Now the game time hadn\u2019t reached 15 minutes yet GH actually pulled the economic gap to an irreversible height. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that the two official commentators were slapped in the face.GH had such an absolute advantage that as long as they could stay stable, it would be possible to win this game without any suspense. Unexpectedly, instead of converging, GH became even more brutal under Lin Yan\u2019s leadership.In the top lane, Jing Yuanzhou pushed to IBB\u2019s base. GH directly gave up on the advancement of the middle and bottom lanes. All the members assembled on the top lane, ready to breakthrough to the high ground. Such a decision made the commentator Cry Cry frown. \u201cThis\u2026 isn\u2019t GH a bit too anxious?\u201dAfter all, it was an entertainment game. In contrast, Brother Rabbit Hat was happy. \u201cA quick fight is good. I like GH\u2019s violent temper! It seems this wave is going to be the key to the game. It depends on whether IBB can hold on.\u201dLuni saw Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s equipment on the big screen and shook his head. \u201cThey can\u2019t hold on.\u201dDon\u2019t look at the number of heads. In fact, Jing Yuanzhou had harvested all the economy on the lane and was the biggest winner. Under Lin Yan\u2019s crazy, driven rhythm, IBB had no spare capacity to contain him. Therefore, as the game progressed up to now, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s equipment had developed too well.As an opponent who had countless encounters with the former BK team, Luni knew better than anyone what a strong existence Jing Yuanzhou would be at this time. In addition, GH\u2019s coach was too strong!As Luni expected, IBB was defeated in this frontal team battle.Initially, Lin Yan entered the field first and opened the group battle. He successfully completed the first kill under the limits of Jian Ye\u2019s healing. IBB\u2019s shooter tried to take away his remaining health but as Lin Yan retreated, Jian Ye took a few steps forward. It was a perfect time difference. He took the damage of two defense towers for Lin Yan and successfully covered Lin Yan, letting him escape.The other IBB players instantly focused their firepower on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s body. As a result, Gu Luo flashed to the rear and the entire lineup was dispersed.IBB lost two people in a flash. They saw the enemy was invincible and were preparing to retreat when they discovered that Bi Yaohua had already taken advantage of the new wave of troops to push toward the high tower.On the other side, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s long sword completely blocked their retreat from the side. Jian Ye stood at the furthest position and quickly restored the health of his teammates. His hand speed and heartbeat almost flew together.There was the ACE system prompt and IBB\u2019s team was completely wiped out. Meanwhile, all the members on GH\u2019s side survived! By the time the next wave of troops arrived, the base crystal in the middle of the screen had completely shattered.[Victory!]The moment the words of victory appeared on the screen, the audience was still a bit overwhelmed and it took them a long time to applaud.\u201cThe GH team is really\u2026\u201d Brother Rabbit Hat realized he couldn\u2019t find an appropriate description. This was precisely what Lin Yan heard when he took off his headphones. The sound of the venue entered his arms and the real atmosphere instantly enveloped him.At this time, Lin Yan found that a layer of sweat was covering his back. He took a deep breath and moved his stiff fingertips. He could clearly feel that the time limit for his complete loss of control had been shortened a lot. In the last wave of team battles, it was fortunate that Jing Yuanzhou blocked a mistake in positioning for him or he might\u2019ve become the only player who died on the field in GH.Lin Yan\u2019s eyes shook slightly at the thought and he instinctively looked sideways. He just happened to meet Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes. Lin Yan noticed the inquiry in the gaze and shook his head slightly, indicating that he was fine for the time being. The feeling of his clothes being soaked in sweat wasn\u2019t so good, especially when the air conditioner was turned on. He couldn\u2019t help feeling cold as the cool wind blew.He retracted his gaze and took a look at the duration of the game. 25 minutes. It was a short game but it wasn\u2019t enough for him.Lin Yan saw the referee remind them to prepare for the next game and he forcibly controlled his emotions. He was wondering if he should use the BP link to say his \u2018dying will\u2019 to his teammates when he suddenly heard Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice from the side. \u201cHello, there is something wrong with my equipment. Can I ask someone for help?\u201dThe referee was taken aback when he heard the words and hurriedly called the staff over for an inspection. The director team saw this and temporarily called off the recording.Jing Yuanzhou sat in his gaming chair and used a bit of force in his feet to push the chair back, making room for the maintenance personnel. Lin Yan had been reluctantly putting on his headphones. Then he saw this scene and couldn\u2019t help wanting to laugh. Even public equipment could be broken. This trick was a great way to delay time, God Jing!Just looking at the appearance of this old god Jing Yuanzhou, it was really hard to tell that it was done by him. At this time, he turned sideways and asked the person next to him indifferently, \u201cLooking at this situation, it will probably take a while to fix. Can I drink some water?\u201dThe staff member immediately picked up the bottle of mineral water. Jing Yuanzhou took it and thanked the person. Then he got up and walked to Lin Yan. He held the back of the chair with one hand and extended the mineral water in the other hand. \u201cThank you for the command. Moisten your throat.\u201dLin Yan wasn\u2019t sure how his face looked like right now but he wasn\u2019t polite. He took the bottle, opened the lid and took a sip. In fact, he was a bit curious about how Jing Yuanzhou broke his equipment but it was difficult to ask in front of so many people. In the end, he could only clear his throat. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou replied in a low voice. His eyes fell on the time statistics on the big screen and he abruptly suggested, \u201cIn the next game, shall we start the crushing from the beginning?\u201dIt might not be recording but the microphone was still on. The words entered the ears of the director and he looked over in shock. Hadn\u2019t he played enough in the game just now? Then Lin Yan let out a hum of agreement. \u201cI think so too.\u201dThe staff thoroughly checked Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s equipment. It took nearly 20 minutes to completely repair it and make sure there were no more malfunctions. The second game of the BO3 finally began.The director team was worried about the dialogue between Jing Yuanzhou and Lin Yan during the break just now. The moment the game started, the camera perspective was locked on the jungler and the top lane.Then they found out what the \u2018direct crushing from the beginning\u2019 meant. If Jing Yuanzhou had been able to get through the lane by himself in the previous game, this game he had Lin Yan\u2019s help and the speed of clearance was almost doubled.The even more frustrating thing was that after Lin Yan completed a gank, he still had enough power to perfectly control the jungle in the upper half of the map. This made the other members of IBB feel helpless even if they wanted to come to support. As long as there were less than two people, they were completely useless under Lin Yan\u2019s defense. If they came to him in groups of three or four then Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou could still deal with it thanks to Jian Ye\u2019s strong assistance. In this way, not only did IBB not gain any advantage, they allowed Gu Luo and Bi Yaohua to take down two defense towers one after another.The commentator Brother Rabbit Hat shook his head as he watched. \u201cThe shooter having insufficient strength is a bad disadvantage. I\u2019m afraid IBB are a long way from winning in this round\u2026\u201dThe game ended in the 20th minute. IBB suffered a series of defeats due to Lin Yan and were wiped out in the last team battle. GH successfully won the second game. It might just be an entertainment match but the entire crushing performance ignited the audience. A burst of applause swept through the studio and the shouts almost broke through the roof at one point.At the end of the match, the host invited the players from both sides to the centre of the field for the post-match interviews.The host had already heard about Lin Yan\u2019s early exit in advance but he never expected for Jing Yuanzhou to be gone as well. He was stunned for a moment and instinctively looked over. He determined that GH really left only three people to deal with the post-match interview and had to take a deep breath to control his emotions.Originally, he had prepared a lot of questions about the match but now he could only swallow them down. The host took a bit of time to adjust his mentality before resuming his polite and professional smile. \u201cCongratulations to GH for winning two games in a row. Excuse me, do you have anything to say to the audience about the match just now?\u201dJian Ye and Gu Luo weren\u2019t interested in speaking. They left space for Bi Yaohua who had his microphone closed all afternoon. The hungry and thirsty Trash Talk King picked up the microphone and cleared his throat. \u201cI have a lot to say. Let me think about it. Where should I start?\u201dThe smile on the host\u2019s face froze and he suddenly had a bad feeling. However, it was already too late. Bi Yaohua had been patient the whole afternoon and he was finally released. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I talk first about IBB\u2019s coach taking the bottom lane? I think this is looking down on me too much. It\u2019s a pity that most people don\u2019t know themselves. First of all\u2026\u201dIn the safety passage at the back of the studio, the endless voice could be heard from far away. There were no people around so Lin Yan placed a hand on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s shoulder while his pale lips were slightly curved up.\u201cIt looks like\u2026 I really suffocated BB this afternoon.\u201d The bangs on his forehead were soaked with sweat. He lowered his head, glanced at his slightly trembling fingertips, and sighed. \u201cStill, it\u2019s fortunate that he held back or\u2026 I would probably be dead now.\u201dHe paused before speaking sincerely. \u201cSince I am here, today\u2019s MVP must be BB\u2026 Apart from anything else, the Trash Talk King is really amazing!\u201dHis self-ridiculing attitude might seem calm but in fact, the time spent in these two games today had exceeded the initial threshold of expectations.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze flickered across this face that was obviously in poor condition. He took this person who still wanted to talk despite having no energy toward the exit. \u201cGo back.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 49": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDon\u2019t look at the words Lin Yan could still manage after the match. The moment he returned to his hotel room, he lay \u2018dead\u2019 on the bed. Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the man\u2019s lifeless look and turned to the bathroom to soak a towel in hot water. He wrung it out, walked to the bed and handed it over.Lin Yan raised his eyelashes slightly, not meaning to move at all. Then he saw Jing Yuanzhou suddenly leaning down with calm eyes. Lin Yan\u2019s heart jumped a bit and he spoke vigilantly, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cYou just sweated and it isn\u2019t good to sleep like this.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou looked down with an indifferent expression. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to move then I will help you wipe it. Don\u2019t worry, there is no service fee this time.\u201dLin Yan\u2019s eyes skimmed the falling hair just a short distance away and he was stunned. It wasn\u2019t until the wet towel touched his forehead that he hurriedly reached out to grab it. \u201cI will wipe it myself.\u201dHe didn\u2019t have much strength left in his body. Fortunately, the moment he touched the towel, Jing Yuanzhou let go of his hand. Jing Yuanzhou watched Lin Yan wiping his face in a perfunctory manner and lowered his eyes. He made a small gesture. \u201cWipe your neck as well?\u201dLin Yan inexplicably got a burning sensation from his neck where the eyes passed over. Lin Yan was startled for a moment before wiping it swiftly. Then he threw the towel back at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s head and wailed, \u201cCaptain Jing, let me go. I want to sleep for a while.\u201dJing Yuanzhou saw this face and didn\u2019t continue to make him struggle. \u201cGo to sleep. I\u2019ll boil some hot water for you so drink a little bit when you wake up.\u201dLin Yan made a vague hum and rolled into the messy bedding, burying his entire body inside it. He rarely showed a state of exhaustion in front of others. At this time, he was obviously really tired. He no longer cared about Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes on him and closed his eyes.In fact, he had already been a bit dizzy on the field before. Today\u2019s team voice channel might\u2019ve been kept as quiet as possible but in the course of the game, communication within the team was indispensable and the suffocation brought about by the atmosphere was inevitable. He was in such an environment for too long and every minute and every second was a test of will.Even an extremely tenacious person like Lin Yan felt that he had almost reached the tipping point of losing control.Jing Yuanzhou went to the bathroom to clean the towel and hung it up. Then he put on a pot of water. Once he came out again, he found that the man on the bed had fallen asleep.Lin Yan was lying on the bed, half his face buried in the pillow. Only the smooth and distinct outline of half his face was exposed. His eyelashes were very long and fell quietly like butterfly wings at rest. The quilt was crumpled together and held tightly in his arms, as if this was the only way to get enough security while sleeping.Jing Yuanzhou stood by the bed and watched for a while. He made sure that Lin Yan was sleeping soundly before pulling out a chair from the side to sit down. Then he started playing with his phone casually.The latest message received was from Gu Luo, who said the recording of the show had ended and they were on the way back to the hotel. GH\u2019s base wasn\u2019t too far from here so they should\u2019ve set off back directly. However, considering Lin Yan\u2019s situation, they still chose to stay one more night.Jing Yuanzhou replied with \u2018I know\u2019 and couldn\u2019t help glancing at the person on the bed.It could be seen that Lin Yan was obviously unwilling to think about his past based on the way he hadn\u2019t told the other players about his PTSD. Even if he left early, he used the excuse of being busy. If it wasn\u2019t for Jing Yuanzhou knowing about it, Lin Yan would\u2019ve been prepared to fight everything silently.No matter how casual this man was normally, in fact, he was actually the one most concerned about the club\u2019s development. Jing Yuanzhou felt a slight tugging in his heart at this thought.He had spent so long in the e-sports circle and was accustomed to seeing all types of people. He had also seen many hurried exits due to injuries and other reasons. He already felt accustomed to regrets and deficiencies. He was even ready to give his final speech at his retirement at any time. He didn\u2019t expect for his self-proclaimed iron heart to feel some inexplicable pain when he saw this sleeping face.The performance might be casual but in today\u2019s arena, the wanton flying figure couldn\u2019t be hidden. Lin Yan obviously also had a light he wanted to chase.Jing Yuanzhou was silent for a moment before opening the browser on his mobile phone. He slowly entered the search term: PTSD treatment.FreestarA faint light leaked through the hanging curtains and just happened to fall between the two people. The curtains shook slightly in the wind and became the only dynamic. By the time Lin Yan woke up, the sky was completely dark. He frowned slightly and rolled around with the quilt in his arms. Then he opened his eyes in a daze.He reached out and rubbed lightly. He didn\u2019t know the time so his first reaction was to grab for his phone. Then he looked up and was stunned when he saw the faint outline beside the bed. \u201cYou scared me. What are you doing sitting here?\u201dJing Yuanzhou replied, \u201cJust checking. This location has good feng shui.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dUsually, he would\u2019ve teased with a few sentences but he felt that Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s tone was different from usual.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you turn on the lights?\u201d Lin Yan didn\u2019t ask much. He just changed the topic in a dazed manner. He was about to get up to find the switch but Jing Yuanzhou already stood up first and turned on the bedside lamp. The eyes of the two men finally met.Jing Yuanzhou asked, \u201cAre you hungry? First order something to eat?\u201dLin Yan only felt a bit hungry after hearing this. \u201cYes, you haven\u2019t eaten yet? Then order something.\u201dJing Yuanzhou responded positively. He poured a cup of hot water for Lin Yan before calling the hotel\u2019s restaurant. After a while, the waiter who delivered the meal rang the doorbell of the room. Lin Yan filled his stomach and felt that he had recovered some strength. He glanced at the time and wasn\u2019t greedy for his warm bed. Instead, he turned and opened the suitcase next to him.Jing Yuanzhou finished sorting out the garbage and paused slightly when he saw Lin Yan putting the laptop on the table. \u201cYou aren\u2019t sleeping?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve had enough sleep for the moment.\u201d Lin Yan answered casually. He held his mobile phone in one hand and skillfully operated the mouse in his other hand to open a document. \u201cI played against IBB in the afternoon and it made me discover a lot of problems, not just with the other team but in our team. Sure enough, I have to experience it on the spot to discover it. I think I have found a jungler rhythm that suits our time. I will write it down first and then tell Abyss about it later. It should be a great improvement.\u201dJing Yuanzhou knew that Lin Yan was a workaholic but he hadn\u2019t expected it to be crazy to this point. He had just been lying in bed like a salted fish and now he was working hard to improve the team.Jing Yuanzhou lowered his eyebrows and the corners of his mouth also went down. However, he didn\u2019t say much. He just took the empty water cup and poured more hot water. He put it in Lin Yan\u2019s hand and sat on the sofa next to him with a phone.No one spoke during the whole process but Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help looking over. Seeing Jing Yuanzhou calmly playing with his phone, Lin Yan gently patted his forehead and started to organize the newly collected information.Time passed minute by minute. Lin Yan had always been immersed while working. It wasn\u2019t until he heard Jing Yuanzhou get up from the sofa that he realized how much time passed.It was followed by a pause.Then this guy had sat on the sofa and played with his phone for hours?This thought flashed through his mind. The more Lin Yan thought about it, the more he felt there was something wrong with Jing Yuanzhou today. He was about to ask something when his phone screen lit up and a voice call notification was heard.Lin Yan glanced down at the \u2018Titans\u2019 note on the voice call and instinctively looked over. He saw Jing Yuanzhou sitting on the bed, the interface for initiating the voice call illuminated on the phone screen.They were obviously at such a close distance and they didn\u2019t even need to talk to shout. Why did he need to use his mobile phone? Lin Yan was stunned for a moment before pressing to answer. His eyes watched the other person as he asked with a smile, \u201cWhat are you playing at, Captain Jing?\u201dThe room was only a certain size. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice through the air combined with the voice coming from the phone. \u201cIn fact, I have been thinking about this afternoon\u2019s match.\u201dIt was a bit strange but Lin Yan thought this communication method was fine. He smiled and asked, \u201cIs there any discovery?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Jing Yuanzhou answered softly. \u201cI found something and it seems I can only use your help. I want to ask you for a favor.\u201dSomething that only he could help with was somewhat rare.Lin Yan raised his eyebrow slightly. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it?\u201d\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been studying a way to work with the team lately but after all, I am older. I am used to the stable, old method of the BK team. I feel a bit unable to keep up with the rhythm of these young people.\u201dLin Yan laughed. BK used the old and stable method, this was true. However, Titans was unable to keep up with the rhythm of the team? What was this lie? There was simply no truth to the words apart from the fact that Jing Yuanzhou had been researching how to fit the team better.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s expression remained unchanged in front of Lin Yan\u2019s doubts. \u201cHowever, I found that after the match with IBB this afternoon, I can instinctively play more ferociously as long as you are in the same team. Coach Lin, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s amazing?\u201dLin Yan, \u201c???\u201dHe turned his chair in half a circle with his toes and smiled. \u201cWhy do I feel like this isn\u2019t a good thing? You can release your ferocity when I\u2019m in the team? Captain Jing, this makes me wonder if you have wanted to beat me up for a long time?\u201dFreestarJing Yuanzhou raised his gaze slightly. \u201cHow is this possible? The reason for this special effect is obviously that your presence makes me feel particularly relieved.\u201dLin Yan smiled and waited for this person to keep talking.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s expression was still calm. \u201cIt is true. I have never felt as relieved as this afternoon on the field. It is like as long as you are by my side, I can definitely get a perfect response no matter what operations I do. I think this is the type of resonance with the team that I am looking for.\u201d\u201c\u2026You might as well say that I am the destiny you want to find.\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised his eyebrow. \u201cIt seems there is no problem if you want to understand it this way.\u201dThe room was quiet for a moment before Lin Yan let out a low laugh. \u201cOkay, you went in such a big circle and you\u2019re getting away from the main point. Tell me, how do you want me to help you?\u201d\u201cIn fact, it is very simple.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou looked up and paused for a moment. \u201cI just hope that when you\u2019re free, Coach Lin can accompany me to play a few rounds of a doubles match just to find the same feeling. Maybe I can really be liberated from the old pace. Don\u2019t you think?\u201dLin Yan froze. \u201cPractice with you?\u201d\u201cIf my observation from this afternoon\u2019s match is correct, you should have a fairly high acceptance of my voice. According to your previous statement, the voice channel in a doubles match should be better than a team match. It is a lot easier at times. Occasionally playing doubles together shouldn\u2019t be much of a problem.\u201dHis mouth intentionally curved upward. \u201cThe feeling of two people connecting through the microphone is probably similar to the way we are communicating now. You see, we\u2019ve been talking for so long. Doesn\u2019t this mean that my voice is still\u2026 within your acceptable range?\u201dThe last word emerged and Lin Yan was silent for a while. He raised his eyes and watched Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s expression. It wasn\u2019t known what he was thinking but the expression in his eyes changed slightly.At this time, it was impossible for him to not know why this person had deliberately talked in such a roundabout manner for so long.Lin Yan laughed playfully. \u201cCaptain Jing, do you really want me to practice with you? Or are you selling yourself to me for relief treatment?\u201dJing Yuanzhou had spoken as tactfully as possible but Lin Yan was too smart. Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t pretend to be confused. He had been exposed but he didn\u2019t give an explanation at all. \u201cYou can think of it any way you want.\u201dLin Yan was silent for a moment in the face of such a frank attitude. He didn\u2019t say anything and directly hung up. The voice call had lost the meaning of its purpose. He sat back in front of the laptop and started to check the game data he just finished organizing.It was just that he was slightly absent-minded. The document stayed on the first page and he didn\u2019t scroll down for a long time. There was a strange silence in the room.Just as Jing Yuanzhou thought there would be no answer, Lin Yan suddenly rubbed his messy hair and spoke in a slightly annoyed voice, \u201cThis matter\u2026 if you aren\u2019t in a hurry then I will think about it.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was startled for a moment before the curve of his mouth became clearer.\u201cYes, I\u2019m not in a hurry.\u201dLin Yan could clearly feel the gaze on him and was unable to work any longer. He simply closed the laptop. \u201cWe will go back to the base tomorrow morning. Go to sleep early.\u201dThe author has something to say:Jing Yuanzhou: Take the initiative to sell myself.Lin Yan: I\u2019ll think about it ~\u25bc-\u25bcPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 50": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEarly the next morning, the GH team collectively went downstairs to the hotel lobby and took the business car back to the base.After lunch, Lin Yan didn\u2019t give them extra time to rest and gathered everyone in the meeting room. He knew very well that such things needed to be carried out eagerly before all the details were forgotten. Due to the recording of the show, it had been delayed for several days. If it continued to be delayed then he was afraid that the training would be cold.Now he would take advantage of the fact that the live broadcast hadn\u2019t begun to hurry up and give the key points. There was too much content to review so Lin Yan didn\u2019t talk nonsense. He went straight to the subject very decisively and opened the first video material.This was the video recorded during the training match between them and BK and it also exposed the most problems. It could be seen that all the advantages in the early stage fell short in the team battles. Obviously, there were great problems with coordination in team battles.The entire meeting room was quiet and only Lin Yan\u2019s voice clearly entered the ears of the team members. From Gu Luo\u2019s mid-laner to Jian Ye\u2019s support, Chen Yushen\u2019s jungler, Bi Yaohua\u2019s shooter and even Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s slight mistake in the laning process\u2026 he listed them one by one without any mistakes.Apart from Gu Luo, the players had been in the youth training camp or previous teams so they had experience with replays. There had just never been a coach\u2019s reply as detailed as Lin Yan\u2019s. It felt like he couldn\u2019t wait to enlarge every second of the operation details.The game was originally less than half an hour but two hours already passed before they knew it. This was just the time it took to explain a game. Just seeing Lin Yan analyze everything so clearly, it was obvious that he had watched this video more than 10 times in public. The time and energy spent behind the seemingly simple replay could be imagined.Seeing that Lin Yan didn\u2019t stop and was about to open the video of the second game, Jing Yuanzhou handed over a bottle of water with a calm expression. \u201cMoisten your throat first?\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Lin Yan grabbed it, took a few mouthfuls and glanced at the others. He slightly changed his harsh tone. \u201cThere are indeed many problems found in the replay but we are a new team after all. These things are all understandable. So you don\u2019t have to pay too much attention to it. If you have any problems then you can start to correct them. I will supplement some training content in a targeted manner to prevent it next time. Do you understand?\u201dThe team members responded, \u201cWe know.\u201dThey all saw the effort the coach put into the team and naturally remembered it in their hearts.Lin Yan nodded with satisfaction. \u201cEveryone should\u2019ve noticed that the situation of our team is different from other teams. In fact, I know it is difficult to perfect one core system while you still have many core systems to practice in. It is very hard but everything depends on one premise. I am certain that each of you has the strength to become the core of the team and I believe you won\u2019t fail to live up to my expectations. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dSuch words were so loud and bold that people were stunned.The players in the meeting room instinctively straightened their backs. \u201cWe must live up to the coach\u2019s hopes!\u201dThen Bi Yaohua couldn\u2019t help exclaiming, \u201cCoach, I don\u2019t mean to go against you but the more I listen, the more I feel like this is a MLM tactic.\u201dIt had to be said that the Trash Talk King was really good at destroying the atmosphere. There was a burst of laughter and the excited atmosphere just created suddenly disappeared.Lin Yan had already drunk the bottle of mineral water. He glanced at the time and didn\u2019t let them continue to mess around. He opened the video of the second game against BK. \u201cOkay, the next game!\u201dThere truly had been a lot of replays accumulated in the past few days. After analyzing the three training games against BK, Lin Yan led everyone to briefly watch the two knockout games in the program.During this period, even the dinner cooked by the aunt was sent to the meeting room. They ate while analyzing it. By the time the replays were over, the sky outside was already dark.It was fortunate that Lin Yan hadn\u2019t completed the replays of the two entertainment games with IBB yesterday due to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s entanglement. Otherwise, he could probably drag the entire team with him overnight.The time that the replay ended was exactly 10:30 in the evening. Lin Yan had the members go to the training room to practice last hitting soldiers while Gu Luo stayed behind to go over the details of his solo game against Luni.Half an hour later, everyone in the training room saw Gu Luo walk in emotionally.Bi Yaohua glanced over. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Gloy, is it so nice to be given preferential treatment? Look at how satisfied your face is.\u201dGu Luo came back to his senses and his eyes were bright. \u201cBrother Trash Talk, the coach is too strong! Tell me, how can he be so strong?!\u201dThe meeting room had several computers. Seeing Gu Luo like this, Bi Yaohua knew he had probably been caught and \u2018tortured.\u2019 He couldn\u2019t help ridiculing. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about how strong the coach is. This is the first time I realized that you have the attribute of becoming excited the more you are abused.\u201dGu Luo was stunned for a moment before his face turned red. \u201cBrother Trash Talk, can\u2019t you speak well?!\u201dBi Yaohua smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not talking well? I\u2019m afraid you haven\u2019t seen me when I talk badly.\u201dGu Luo was sullen and wanted to argue a bit more when he remembered something. He stopped talking to Bi Yaohua and turned to Chen Yushen next to him. \u201cBy the way, the coach told me to let you go to the meeting room.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t known why but these words sounded like he was being called by the school teacher in charge of the grade. Jian Ye had been suffering while hitting the soldiers and he couldn\u2019t help looking over. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Will we receive preferential treatment in turn?\u201dChen Yushen was caught off guard and shook slightly. He saw himself miss a few soldiers. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe corners of his mouth lowered slightly. He took away the life of the remaining soldiers in the line and stood up.Lin Yan had Gu Luo stay back and now he called for Chen Yushen. It was natural for others to feel they would receive separate guidance. However, Chen Yushen knew it wasn\u2019t that simple. The thing he had been waiting for the past few days had finally come.Lin Yan hadn\u2019t mentioned this matter since the small conflict with the ZX team at the hotel. Chen Yushen had a premonition in his heart that Lin Yan was finally ready to have a good talk with him.He walked all the way to the meeting room in an anxious mood. The moment he entered through the door, he saw Lin Yan sitting at the computer and playing minesweeper. The mouse was tapped quickly and the slender fingers were dazzling. The game ended in the blink of an eye.Lin Yan obviously heard the door opening and didn\u2019t choose to continue. Instead, he gently touched the ground with his feet and turned the gaming chair around. \u201cCome and sit down.\u201dChen Yushen pulled out a nearby chair and sat at a relatively comfortable distance. Lin Yan noticed Chen Yushen\u2019s nervousness and the corners of his mouth twitched. \u201cI called you today because I wanted to talk to you about the previous matter.\u201dSure enough.Chen Yushen closed his eyes silently.Lin Yan told him, \u201cI know I seem to be nosy but I have to admit that the incident has really affected you too much. This is just when facing a sub-league team like ZX. What about your opponent in the professional league? If you can\u2019t completely resolve this matter in your mind then you can\u2019t allow your mood to be affected by these messy things during important matches.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t stated clearly but Chen Yushen knew which team Lin Yan was referring to in the professional league and his lips pressed tighter together.He was ready to accept admonitions but Lin Yan didn\u2019t ask questions as expected. He just sighed emotionally. \u201cSo what happened back then should be handled as soon as possible! If you can gain a satisfactory result then won\u2019t you be able to face the road in the future?\u201dChen Yushen looked up with astonishment. \u201cResult?\u201dLin Yan pulled out a document and handed it over. \u201cLook at this.\u201dChen Yushen took it doubtfully. Once he opened it to see the contents, his entire body froze in place.Previously, he had been willing to confess to Lin Yan to show respect for the coach and boss. Apart from that, he didn\u2019t have any excessive thoughts. He never expected that Lin Yan would actually do this for him.Chen Yushen could feel the heavy weight of the file in his hands.The words on the paper were clear and referred to the investigation results of that year. A lot of the confidential content had been coded but it basically restored the complete process of the suicide case in the youth training camp. It was as he thought. After the violence incident, someone had investigated this matter in depth but then it was silently suppressed.It wasn\u2019t too thick but it was enough to imagine how much effort was spent to re-open the file.His fingers tightened slightly. Then gradually, as he looked down, Chen Yushen could feel the hands holding the document trembling slightly.He had only made some guesses after the fact from the related diary about his friend\u2019s experiences. Now he read it and the truth he sought for so many years turned out to be far more unbearable than he thought.A strange feeling enveloped his body as he realized so many things happened under his eyelids back then. Under the slight coldness, it felt like all the blood in his body was trembling slightly. Originally, Ah Mu should\u2019ve stood in the same dazzling arena as those players. Now\u2026 those people, how could they!Lin Yan looked down silently and wasn\u2019t in a hurry to speak. There were many things and many decisions. In the end, only the party involved was eligible to make them. It wasn\u2019t until a long time later that Chen Yushen restrained his emotions with great forbearance. He asked in a slightly hoarse tone, \u201cCan I\u2026 sue them? If I sue them now\u2026 is it too late?\u201d\u201cYou can sue them. I called you today just to confirm the follow-up operation.\u201d Lin Yan explained. \u201cThe story of that year is roughly as you can see. As for why the case wasn\u2019t resolved at the beginning, I won\u2019t say any more about the specifics. Based on the current situation, I can provide you with two solutions.\u201dChen Yushen controlled his reddish eyes. \u201cCoach, you say it.\u201d\u201cFirst, under the premise of controlling the influence, report the relevant information. The management of the league will handle the matter accordingly within the league. The final result is probably that the few people involved with LAN will be completely driven out of the e-sports field and won\u2019t be able to engage in any industry-related work.\u201dLin Yan saw Chen Yushen\u2019s deep expression. \u201cThe punishment is indeed relatively light compared to what they did but it can be considered a heavy lesson. From a rational point of view, if the handling is done properly then it won\u2019t have much impact on your future career path. It can be considered a more favorable option for you.\u201dChen Yushen asked with almost no hesitation, \u201cWhat about the second?\u201dAccording to Lin Yan\u2019s deep understanding of Chen Yushen, he already knew that Chen Yushen wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with such light punishment. He rubbed his temple and continued, \u201cThe second method is to directly hand it over to the criminal department. It might be a case from two years ago but the evidence in my hand is enough to lock up all those people behind bars.\u201dChen Yushen heard this and spoke decisively. \u201cI choose the second one!\u201dLin Yan stared deeply at him and reminded him, \u201cThere is one thing you must be clear about. If it is handled using the criminal process, there is a high probability that your actions will be exposed. Based on the current level of the league\u2019s control over dangerous actions, the pressure of public opinion will be huge even though you weren\u2019t a formal professional player at the time. This situation will be much more serious than in the past.\u201dChen Yushen\u2019s eyes fell on the documents. \u201cI am thinking very clearly. I want those people to be punished, even if the league completely removes me and I can no longer be a professional player.\u201dIt was the expected answer but Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cYou won\u2019t be completely removed. Do I look like the type of idiot to put so much effort into obtaining my jungler only to have him removed?\u201dChen Yushen was stunned for a moment. \u201cCoach, I\u2026\u201d\u201cIn any case, you have decided it yourself. You can ask me for help but you must be sure to resist all the pressure that will come afterwards. You need to be completely focused on the game and not be affected by anything strange.\u201dLin Yan stared at Chen Yushen. \u201cAbyss, you have signed a contract. If you run away then it is a breach of contract. Then I\u2019ll send you away and find a new jungler. Do you understand?\u201dIt might have been a threat, but once it entered Chen Yushen\u2019s ears, he felt a flow of warmth to his heart. His Adam\u2019s apple moved out of control. \u201cCoach, as long as I can still play the game, I will be yours for the rest of my life!\u201d\u201cGo, stop disgusting me.\u201d Lin Yan gave a low laugh. \u201cWhat do I want with the rest of your life? Once you are too old to play, you should go where you should go. Wanting to stick to me even after retiring? These calculations are too shrewd. There is no chance if you want to take this opportunity to ruin me!\u201dThen he stopped up and called a number in front of Chen Yushen. \u201cHello, Brother Wei? Yes, it is about what we discussed last time. Um\u2026 yes, there is a decision. Other things don\u2019t need to be considered. I can arrange it myself. Then you just handle it directly. I\u2019m sorry to trouble you. Yes? How long do I want those people to stay locked up?\u201dHe felt the attention from the side as his lips curved in a cold smile. \u201cOf course\u2026 it is as long as possible within the scope of the law!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 51": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChen Yushen\u2019s red eyes when he returned to the training room couldn\u2019t be hidden. The other team members were startled for a while. They were puzzled about how Lin Yan bullied him that the unsmiling boy would actually cry like this.Chen Yushen felt his teammates\u2019 concern and his mood was very complicated for a while. After a moment of silence, he could only say in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019ll know in a few days.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say anything and the others didn\u2019t ask too much. Meanwhile, Lin Yan talked to the manager Luo Mo in advance so he could prepare for public relations and contact other media to deal with the pressure of public opinion.Coincidentally, the day when the incident was revealed happened to be the day when the second episode of Burning Hot Assembly was broadcasted.At the same time, the Burning Hot League officially revealed the internal bullying that occurred in the youth training camp in the past and the victim who eventually committed suicide. The plot could be described as very bad.Then the league\u2019s official Weibo publicly displayed a list of the people involved and explained that the matter had been handed over to the relevant criminal departments for handling. They would strictly follow the handling process to ensure that the criminals bore the corresponding legal punishment.The announcement didn\u2019t specify the entire bullying process but it wasn\u2019t difficult for netizens to perceive the seriousness of this matter. After all, if there was still a glimmer of hope then who would be willing to give up on the dream of e-sports in this way and end his life so easily?Anyone who paid attention to the e-sports circle knew that the youth training camp was the main source for many teams to select players. Who would\u2019ve expected for such a thing to happen and that it had taken two years to be dealt with? Naturally, the entire Internet exploded.[What does it mean they\u2019ll announce the ID of the people in the youth training camp? According to me, all the information should be fully exposed!][Has the professional league been eating farts for the past two years? It has been so long and they\u2019re only dealing with it now?][I remember that LAN. I saw him previously on Burning Hot Assembly. ZX\u2019s shooter?][Fuck, he played the game as rotten as a dog. I thought he had a fierce look at the time. Sure enough!][Reporting! ZX was eliminated by IBB and went home in the second episode of the show. So happy!][In the future when the club chooses players, they should wipe their eyes. Don\u2019t collect any rubbish for their team.]The scolding was endless. Then someone ran out and broke the news that these people had been arrested this morning and were awaiting the final verdict to see how many years they were sentenced to.The little justice netizens on the Internet finally sighed with relief but there were still many people who ran to the Weibo pages of these people in indignation.Several of the people involved were working behind the scenes in the e-sports field while only LAN was on the list of official players. Therefore, his ZX official Weibo undoubtedly became the angriest battlefield.The comments area had completely collapsed and all the comments were of netizens greeting the blind management. Even the other innocent members of ZX were affected. In this way, the fact that ZX went home directly during the first elimination was a good thing. At least this way, they avoided the miserable treatment of their team being chased and scolded in later episodes.Lin Yan stayed in the meeting room all morning. He witnessed the detonation of the entire incident and there wasn\u2019t much expression on his face. At this moment, he looked up at the time and guessed it was almost here.Sure enough, as the heat of the incident fermented, some people started to think about the violence incident that took place two years ago.The violence incident that year only involved unknown youth training team members. The official announcement had given the results of the investigation but it only caused a small splash. The person who caused it was expelled from the youth training camp and everyone gradually forgot about it.Thinking about it again, the timing seemed a bit too coincidental. As a result, netizens discovered the disciplinary notice of that year. They couldn\u2019t help being stunned when they saw the familiar ID. Abyss? Wasn\u2019t he the jungler in the GH team right now?One stone caused thousands of waves. The already messed up Internet exploded again. The video of the first episode where GH sent out a support against LAN was dug up again.In fact, when the episode first aired, there was controversy that GH had been too much to arrange such a humiliating solo game. Looking back now, there was probably private enmity between the two teams?Two years ago, Abyss withdrew from the e-sports field due to the violence incident while LAN was unpunished and became a professional player. The two of them received different treatments and reunited on a variety show. They were obviously as incompatible as fire and water.Netizens made up a good play in minutes.Jing Yuanzhou only learned about this after receiving an inquiry from Ku Tianlu. Then he recalled the details of when Lin Yan recruited Chen Yushen and immediately understood. \u201cYou already knew about this?\u201dLin Yan nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dJing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help glancing at him deeply. \u201cSo what else do you know?\u201dLin Yan raised his head and smiled.\u201cCan you guess?\u201d\u201cCan you guess?\u201dThe two spoke almost in unison and they couldn\u2019t help smiling at each other. Jing Yuanzhou was already used to this person\u2019s attitude. He read through the comments area of GH\u2019s official Weibo and asked, \u201cWhat do you plan to do next?\u201dLin Yan was very calm. \u201cI have handed it over to Ah Mo. He is more professional than me when it comes to this.\u201dLuo Mo was originally Lin Yan\u2019s personal assistant. He might\u2019ve never been in contact with the e-sports field before but some links in various industries were the same. He was naturally good at handling public opinion. After receiving the boss\u2019 instructions, he contacted the PR department and sent the prepared drafts to the major media.It was completely different from the official statement made by the league. The articles that Luo Mo asked someone to write were very affectionate. On the one hand, they criticized the evil deeds of LAN\u2019s group while also singing praises for the deep friendship between Chen Yushen and his friend. This provided an excellent guide for the violence incident.Netizens were originally speculating about the connection between these two things and it now became clear under the \u2018revelations\u2019 of the major media.Later, someone dug out countless details from an unknown place: For example, Abyss was teammates with the bullies during training. For example, he and the person who committed suicide were roommates. Someone in the youth training camp saw that Abyss and those bullies had frequent disputes before the violence happened. Another example was that during a fight, Abyss cut someone\u2019s neck with a knife he grabbed on the spot and that person was lying in the hospital for several days. That person turned out to be LAN of the ZX team\u2026Grievances tangled up together and it seemed more unclear two years after the incident happened.In just half a day, the voices on the Internet became chaotic.Naturally, some people thought that LAN\u2019s group of people were to blame. They caused such a serious bullying incident in the youth training camp and it was understandable for Abyss to avenge his friend. However, a large number of people thought that villains should be punished by law. No matter how impulsive, Abyss should\u2019ve gone to the relevant department for prosecution. Instead, he spontaneously reacted to violence with violence. There was a serious problem with his method of handling it.The two sides argued for a long time and it was inevitable that the comments area of GH\u2019s official Weibo and Chen Yushen\u2019s personal Weibo completely collapsed.This was the situation after Luo Mo deliberately arranged for people to guide public opinion. If they had been unprepared then the consequences would\u2019ve been even more disastrous.Lin Yan had deliberately organized all-night training for the team the night before. So by the time the other members of GH woke up and learned about this matter, it was already evening. Public opinion on the Internet had completely fermented and trouble would no longer happen. Both sides held to their own opinions and there were no more results from arguing.Gu Luo frowned as he looked at his phone, glancing quietly at Chen Yushen from time to time. They knew that Chen Yushen and LAN of the ZX team had grievances but they didn\u2019t know how serious it was until now.Today was originally the day to watch the latest episode of Burning Hot Assembly. However, the meeting room was silent despite the episode playing on the big screen.It wasn\u2019t until the game between the ZX team and IBB team occurred and LAN appeared on the screen that Jian Ye finally couldn\u2019t help cursing in a low voice. He abruptly grabbed the remote control and turned off the screen. Lin Yan had been sitting there and watching so he looked over.Chen Yushen could feel the eyes on him. There weren\u2019t too many inquiries and it was more distinct concern. This moved his heart. In the silence, he calmly told them, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m really fine. The words on the Internet don\u2019t matter. It isn\u2019t a big deal as long as everyone is willing to be teammates with me.\u201dThere were many extra words but everyone could hear an indifference and calmness that had never been there before.Bi Yaohua couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit contemptuous when he heard such polite words. \u201cWe still have to go to the World Competition together. Why wouldn\u2019t we want to be your teammates? Some people are individuals when they don\u2019t open their mouths and dogs when they open them. You can\u2019t stop them from wanting to be beasts so don\u2019t take it to heart. It\u2019s fine.\u201dGu Luo hurriedly agreed. \u201cBrother Trash Talk is right!\u201dChen Yushen was stunned for a moment before his lips curved in a rare, gentle arc. \u201cThank you.\u201dIn the past two years, he had completely lost his way because of the things he experienced. He once wanted to retreat due to the previous criticisms. Now GH gave him a safe harbor he could completely rely on.Now that everything was settled, he felt that it was no longer important. Those who made Ah Mu lose his future had also lost their futures. The iron bars of prison would be their only company for many years.As for him, regardless of his reputation or the bad voices behind him, he was willing to stand on this arena that was full of his lifelong dreams and continue to fight firmly as long as the coach wanted him to continue playing!The meeting room was silent for a long time and the atmosphere was very moving.Lin Yan saw the group of excited youngsters and couldn\u2019t help clapping his hands to draw their attention. \u201cGroup soul building belongs to group soul building. Don\u2019t forget the daily live broadcast tomorrow afternoon, got it?\u201dThe atmosphere was destroyed with these words.Everyone who was stunned to hear it, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck, they had almost forgotten about it. According to the arrangement with the program, their daily training broadcast that took place three times a week was indeed about to start again. The only difference was that this was the first time GH would be broadcasting after the reveal of this incident. The bloody and tragic scene at the time could almost be predicted in advance.The following afternoon, in the preparatory stage before the live broadcast, the staff of the program arranged multiple bypass data lines in advance in order to prevent a situation where the live broadcast room completely froze.In fact, it would\u2019ve been fine if Lin Yan hadn\u2019t reminded them yesterday. Thanks to this reminder, the dark circles on everyone\u2019s faces when they went downstairs were very distinct. On the contrary, Chen Yushen was the only one who looked normal apart from Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou.Seeing this situation, Lin Yan shook his head and couldn\u2019t help complaining to Jing Yuanzhou again. \u201cNo! This mental quality really isn\u2019t good! How can they be so easily affected? Abyss has finally let go of some of his worries. Captain, shouldn\u2019t you find time to train them well?\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t have any comments and smiled slightly. \u201cNo problem, I will train them as you wish.\u201dLin Yan looked at his attitude and felt there was nothing good from it. He frowned suspiciously but said nothing. \u201cOkay, go and tidy up your styling. The live broadcast will start soon.\u201dJing Yuanzhou told him, \u201cYes, you also remember to do it a little bit.\u201dLin Yan was startled and finally remembered after meeting Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes. \u201cOh yes, it\u2019s going to open today!\u201dHe had been focused on Chen Yushen\u2019s matter for the past two days and almost forgot about it.The live broadcast started. As other people came to the training room, they found that Chen Yushen was already sitting in front of the computer and the interface of the live broadcast room was on his computer screen.The first wave of traffic poured in and almost blew up the entire room. Soon, the barrage scrolled frantically.[I used to think that he always had a mourning face. I didn\u2019t expect him to really be mourning.][I can understand your original intention but I can\u2019t understand how you handled it.][GH really dares to accept anyone. First BB and now Abyss. Aren\u2019t you afraid that the inside will be overturned before the match?][He is so tall and thin. I can\u2019t see him hitting people hard.][E-sports refuses any violence. Can the people who have stepped on this forbidden area really learn thoroughly? I don\u2019t believe it.][Haven\u2019t you already avenged your friend and achieved your wish? Why don\u2019t you leave the circle?][You people are sick. Would you let your good friend be bullied like this?][Don\u2019t say anything else. Is it difficult to believe in the law?][The GH toxic team has a real hammer, right? When will it be disbanded? Hehehe.]It was clear that the sunspots were fighting more aggressively than the normal audience. If someone tried to speak up for Chen Yushen then they were quickly buried under a bombardment.At the same time, the content on the barrage gradually became unbearable.[Oh, I was going to help you speak. What does this silence mean?][Look at this stinky face. Others aren\u2019t allowed to talk about your action?][It\u2019s really funny. What is going on with the GH team? They are too arrogant.][So what happened back then? Would you like to take advantage of this opportunity to explain?][Bullying isn\u2019t good but violence also isn\u2019t good.][What type of goods is this? GH\u2019s style is really different from other teams. I\u2019m convinced.][First, let me say that you\u2019re not at fault but it is still better for you to apologize publicly for what happened back then.][What a joke. If he was so smart then he should\u2019ve called the police instead of committing violence.][Hehe, the law is for destroying this type of people.][Abyss, get out of the game!][Abyss, get out of the game +1!][Abyss, get out of the game +2!]\u2026\u2026[Abyss, get out of the game +ID number!]At first, the network administrators in the live broadcast room tried to control the barrage with banned words. Later, they found they couldn\u2019t ban it all and were confused. However, Chen Yushen seemed to have seen nothing. He calmly logged into his account, ignored all the friend applications that were popping up and started the ranking. He didn\u2019t even block the content of the barrage in the live broadcast room. He allowed it to scroll wildly as if it had nothing to do with him.The queue was quickly completed. He entered the game and a few queries popped up from his teammates in the chat channel. Chen Yushen turned a blind eye to it and selected his hero. Once inside the game, he went straight to the jungle.He played very silently regardless of the news in the channel. He cleared the jungle area silently, proceeding with ganking without being affected, played in the team battle and pushed at the opposite side\u2019s crystal.Then he moved onto the next game and continued to repeat the same thing. Gradually, the sunspots felt his unresponsive attitude was a bit boring and the barrage slowed down. Just as Chen Yushen completed another ranking and was about to continue, an invitation popped up on the interface.][GH.BB has invited you to join the doubles ranking. Are you willing?]Chen Yushen couldn\u2019t help freezing for a moment. He looked away from his computer screen and saw Bi Yaohua waving to him. \u201cHurry up, hurry up, accept it!\u201dHe agreed after a bit of hesitation.The moment he joined the team, Bi Yaohua\u2019s voice came from his headphones. \u201cFuck, I was waiting for you. I almost suffocated!\u201dChen Yushen, \u201c?\u201dThe author has something to say:Trash Talk King: It\u2019s time to show real technique~ \uff1a\uff09Chen Yushen: ?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He saw that the team had been formed and they had already entered the queue so he didn\u2019t ask much. Then he heard Bi Yaohua asking in the voice chat, \u201cDo you mind if I go to your live broadcast room?\u201dChen Yushen was even more bewildered and blurted out, \u201cI don\u2019t mind.\u201dTherefore, the sunspots in Chen Yushen\u2019s live broadcast room looked up between the scolding to see a golden system prompt.In order to make it more convenient for the GH team members to visit each other, Lin Yan used the team money to raise their gift rankings in the respective live broadcast rooms. This gave them extremely striking appearance banners.The sunspots were still slandering Bi Yaohua and Chen Yushen for teaming up. They saw that the other person actually took the initiative to send himself to the door and there was no need for them to go to the next-door live broadcast room. They quickly sent barrage messages and it wasn\u2019t surprising that there was another burst of cynicism.In addition, the black fans on Bi Yaohua\u2019s side discovered the situation of them teaming up. The barrage in the two live broadcast rooms directly opened the linkage mode and the scene was very spectacular.Just then, Bi Yaohua fiddled with the headset with a blank expression before asking, \u201cHow is it? Can you hear me?\u201dThe two of them were now grouped together in a voice communication. Chen Yushen\u2019s live broadcast room also heard his voice.Chen Yushen replied, \u201cI hear you.\u201dBi Yaohua gave a low laugh. \u201cI wasn\u2019t asking you.\u201dChen Yushen, \u201c?\u201dAt this time, the queue was successful and the two people entered the BP link. Once it was Bi Yaohua\u2019s turn, he directly locked onto a shooter and smiled while looking up. \u201cI was asking those people cursing if they could hear me.\u201dChen Yushen, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe glanced at his live broadcast room and saw that all of the barrage had paused for a moment. Then it was completely agitated by the extremely arrogant tone.[Damn, is this a blatant provocation?][Why pretend to trash talk day and night. Do you really think you are the Trash Talk King?][Two toxic people are together, 666666.][Hey, let me call you my son. Do you dare to agree?]Bi Yaohua was unmoved in the face of such a huge battle.At the beginning of the first round of the doubles match, he bought his outfit and walked in his lane while manipulating his character, his tone calm as if he were talking about everyday life. \u201cI just heard that you asked someone to get out of the gaming circle? Are you eligible to say this? Why don\u2019t you think about getting out of the live broadcast room first? You just need to touch your upper and lower lips together to speak. It\u2019s better to show you how to roll and get lost. After all, normal people use walking which is too difficult to learn. Of course, some people speak too much and their legs get broken. They can\u2019t walk and can only roll.\u201dHe easily took away the first wave of soldiers while dealing a few attacks to the other shooter, forcing them directly back under the tower.Then he glanced at Chen Yushen\u2019s position and started walking to the opposite jungle in an extremely calm manner. \u201cThe housekeepers on both sides are here right? You can block those who are violent and curse. In addition, remember to submit a report. The mute package is for a week so you\u2019re welcome.\u201dThe two men met in the jungle and took away the head of the opposite jungler.Bi Yaohua gave all the economy to Chen Yushen and continued to return to his bottom lane to develop, not forgetting to continue interacting with the barrage. \u201cI\u2019m not qualified to say that others have a bad mouth? Oh, I like to scold people but I\u2019m also civilized. For example, I never curse other people\u2019s parents as soon as I go out. I don\u2019t have parents at home. If you really lack love then you can tell me directly. I can\u2019t give you maternal love but I can barely work hard to give you a father\u2019s laugh. Although I have never easily recognized a fool as a son, it is the responsibility of everyone to call the mentally disabled. If you squeeze then love will still be lost.\u201dThe other side\u2019s shooter noticed that Bi Yaohua wasn\u2019t easy to fight and called the jungler and support for help.Bi Yaohua glimpsed the figure sneaking around and signaled to Chen Yushen. \u201cAbyss, come here for a while.\u201dThen he glanced at the barrage on the live broadcast room. \u201cOh, you are shameless enough to say you are a passerby? Thank you, I was laughed at. How old are you? Let\u2019s not mention the passersby who aren\u2019t passersby. These days, the average person on the Internet is a sunspot. Brother Trash Talk will send you a sentence. The front leads the way while the back goes straight to the grave. Is this enough rhyme? Is it freestyle, please look.\u201dSeeing the enemy jungler and support rushing out from the grass beside him, Bi Yaohua decisively used Flash and withdrew under the defense tower.Chen Yushen arrived and directly won a wave of double kills. Bi Yaohua returned to the city to update his equipment and the corners of his mouth rose contemptuously. \u201cOkay, Brother Trash Talk feels good today so I will give you more guidance.\u201d\u201cHey, you feel sick listening to me? You feel sick yet you are rushing forward. Are you afraid the entire world doesn\u2019t know you are cheap? Leave your ID number here. I can help publicize it for you at no charge. After all, there are many similar stenches in this live broadcast room. I can understand the feeling of taking a breath after being underground for so long. I just have to bother you to close your bad mouth for a bit. Those who have stayed underground in the underworld for too long have bad breath.\u201d\u201cYou want to force the officials to ban me? Okay, if you can really make the officials obey you then that is your ability. Otherwise, your mouth isn\u2019t as good as mine. At least I do what I say. For example, if you say forbidden words\u2026 housekeeper, ban all the slippery ones.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m giving heads to Abyss. You can see it. Should I praise you for finally developing a brain? Just because I\u2019m speaking so arrogantly doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m bullying people. Then why come to my live broadcast room if I\u2019m so arrogant? Don\u2019t talk about me. I can make a son cry if they come out. Do you believe it or not?\u201d\u201cAbyss is an impressive person. He isn\u2019t lowering himself to your level but I\u2019m not as good. After all, you know that the Internet is too developed now. No one knows if there is a man or a dog sitting on the opposite screen. If you are a person then I can still talk politely. However, I can\u2019t ask animals to understand the human language. Right?\u201d\u201cIt is justified to commit violence? I didn\u2019t say that. If there is evidence then upload the image. If there is no evidence then it is called slander. Don\u2019t think we can\u2019t find you across the Internet. Our GH team has its own information department that can check IPs. Do you dare come to the base for a face to face confrontation? Come and say things a few more times. The judicial process of taking screenshots and keeping evidence will start?\u201cDon\u2019t say I\u2019m threatening you. Society is ruled by laws and you need evidence for everything you say. Who told you to say such things? I didn\u2019t tell you to speak such nonsense.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re an adult or not. For the time being, all those present are people. This is something people shouldn\u2019t do. Don\u2019t stand on the high moral ground and pretend to be generous when speaking.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the entire thing clear? If you\u2019re not sure then it\u2019s better to go back and ask your mother about the reason for your lack of IQ. For example, did she drink too much when she was pregnant? I don\u2019t blame you if this is the case. After all, a brain is a good thing but unfortunately, not everyone has one.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been dragging everyone. Do you know? I\u2019m doing this because I have the capital. Abyss can stay in our team because of his strength. At least it\u2019s all based on ability. What? There are still many people dissatisfied with the current result. Sorry, if you\u2019re dissatisfied then hold it back. Oh, don\u2019t mention it. I like the way you are looking at me but can\u2019t kill me. Don\u2019t talk about anything else. Just ask how many people are being frugal and went to an Internet cafe to scold me. It is really moving that they\u2019re so determined despite being physically disabled.\u201dBi Yaohua talked endlessly. In the blink of an eye, those cursing and scolding on the barrage were completely driven crazy. The Trash Talk King\u2019s mouth had been through a hundred battles. There was a madness on his side while on the other side, his ranking didn\u2019t fall in the slightest.The first doubles game ended with the crushing of the enemy\u2019s crystal. After exiting, Bi Yaohua continued to pull Chen Yushen with a calm expression to line up.By this time, it was impossible for Chen Yushen not to know that Bi Yaohua was coming out for him. He glanced at the barrage that was about to be blown up and finally couldn\u2019t control his mouth from curving up. He knew that this wasn\u2019t very appropriate from his position but to be honest, watching those keyboard warriors jumping wildly while about to vomit up blood was really\u2026 great.Just then, two more striking banners popped up in the center of the screen. Gu Luo and Jian Ye had just finished a doubles game and also entered his live broadcast room one after another.Chen Yushen was taken aback for a moment and looked up to see the two of them smiling and gesturing at him. Then they didn\u2019t continue to play the rankings at all. They switched directly to the online broadcast perspective and started to show Bi Yaohua\u2019s talk show special.Due to their relatively pleasing attributes, Gu Luo and Jian Ye had accumulated a lot of supporters during this period of time. Now these fans were watching them rank. Seeing the sudden change in the style of the live broadcast room and then hearing Bi Yaohua\u2019s voice, they instantly understood what was going on.In fact, for most people, the violence incident was undesirable. However, there were reasons for it and they could still be sympathetic. It was just that due to the law of the \u2018silent majority\u2019, these people didn\u2019t have the aggressiveness of those scolding and often chose to be onlookers. They might have disagreed with those views but their combat effectiveness wasn\u2019t equal. After being buried several times, those who spoke objectively would no longer speak. It wasn\u2019t until Bi Yaohua took the lead in fighting that they came out again and showed their faces, expressing their positions.Soon, the number of viewers in the live broadcast room soared and the original one-sided wind was no longer there. Due to the arguments of different opinions, the barrage completely collapsed.In fact, some people were so embarrassed that they long sought out the platform to report Bi Yaohua privately. Unfortunately for them, the Trash Talk King had survived for many years in this field and was too clear about the rules of live broadcasting. He knew what could be said and what couldn\u2019t be said. His popularity was overwhelming but he hadn\u2019t said anything that had crossed the line. Therefore, the senior manager sat in the room for a long time and found that there was no way to deal with it. He had to retreat without a word.As a result, those scolding Bi Yaohua were even angrier. Things were becoming bigger and bigger and a method was needed to end it. The live broadcast platform\u2019s staff member and the staff of the program couldn\u2019t control the netizens and eventually had to find Lin Yan in great anxiety.Bi Yaohua was extremely confident today. A large part of the reason was that he had already sought Lin Yan\u2019s consent. However, Lin Yan definitely couldn\u2019t show any knowledge of this when facing the partners who were about to cry.He made a slightly distressed expression and fell into contemplation. \u201cAs you know, BB himself isn\u2019t a person easy to control. This time, our team member was being bullied and now they are all angry. I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t listen to me.\u201dThe live broadcasting platform staff saw the popularity of the live broadcast room soaring in a straight line and exclaimed, \u201cQuickly think of a way!\u201dThe program\u2019s staff obviously hadn\u2019t expected the daily live broadcast to turn into an online scolding war and wanted to cry. \u201cIf this continues then I\u2019m afraid it will be on the hot search soon!\u201dFrom the perspective of a variety show, positive traffic was naturally extremely welcome. However, if they got this type of reverse hot search then they were afraid they would really have to fight again.Lin Yan was actually waiting for this moment. He tried to suppress his smile and pretended to nod cautiously. \u201cWait a minute, I\u2019ll ask Captain Jing if he is willing to help.\u201dThen he lowered his head and opened WeChat. He sent a message to Jing Yuanzhou: [It\u2019s almost time. Be ready to open it.]Before long, the partners were pleasantly surprised to find that the popularity of Bi Yaohua and Chen Yushen\u2019s live broadcast rooms were starting to decline rapidly. Then they finally realized\u2014Titans had started broadcasting!This was the first public broadcast by Jing Yuanzhou since his move. Originally, many people had paid attention to the GH Club because of him. God Jing finally showed his face so they naturally jumped over without any hesitation.In just a few minutes, the popularity of Titans\u2019 live broadcast room broke through tens of millions. After a few minutes, they could see Jing Yuanzhou turning on the camera. The fans of Titans felt an unprecedented satisfaction. [Ahhhhh, you are finally broadcasting!]Of course, there were some irritated sunspots who tried to stir up things about Chen Yushen. [You can actually stay with the toxic GH team. Aren\u2019t you ashamed when speaking? Haha.]However, everyone here were diehard fans who had been with Jing Yuanzhou for many years. They could remain silent when it had nothing to do with their own player but seeing these people actually jump to Titans\u2019 live broadcast room, the barrage suddenly went crazy.The sunspots were scolded until they were bleeding and they could only desperately close it.Jing Yuanzhou opened his microphone and glanced at the quiet live broadcast room. \u201cHey, can you hear me?\u201d[Ahhh, I was waiting for you! I can finally see you!][Why are you only broadcasting live now, you black-hearted man!][Every time I can only look at you secretly from other rooms. It is so bitter.][The GH team seems to be in a mess recently. Be careful not to be affected.][Wu wu wu, it is the voice of my long-lost husband.]There were thousands of scrolling barrages. Jing Yuanzhou smiled faintly and opened his mouth to respond to the internal situation of the GH team. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, everything is fine with the team. Children are easily impulsive when they are young. He accidentally made a mistake and already received the punishment he deserves. I hope everyone can be more tolerant. He is a good boy and knows he was wrong. I believe he won\u2019t do it again in the future.\u201dThis was the first time Jing Yuanzhou had spoken out about Chen Yushen\u2019s incident. It was naturally after careful consideration that he chose this time to express his position. Fans had been worried that their player would encounter problems in the team and were completely relieved after hearing this. They could disbelieve what others said but if Titans called him a good boy then Abyss must be a good boy.Many fans had been silently watching the scolding war in the other live broadcasts. At this time, they also expressed their opinions.[Ignore those people. They are just little cyber policemen standing on the moral high ground.][Okay, we will take care of him.][A keyboard warrior has no brains. Rest assured, we have a sense of measure and won\u2019t be affected.][Uhuh, your child is our child and we must protect him.][The team isn\u2019t simple but you have to promise us to live broadcast more in the future.][Hurry up, hurry up. I haven\u2019t seen you in so long. What are you doing today?]\u201cWait a minute, it will be ready soon.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou might\u2019ve turned on the live broadcast but he didn\u2019t queue up alone. At this time, his screen was stuck on the lobby interface. Then he suddenly turned around and asked, \u201cDo you really want to do doubles together?\u201dA man\u2019s voice passed gently through the headset. \u201cYes, I want to increase my ranking. Take me with you. I\u2019m logging in so don\u2019t rush it.\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not in a hurry. Take your time.\u201dThere was a faint pause on the livestream\u2019s barrage: ???Who could get Titans to help take him in the game?At this time, the audience with the live broadcast perspective of the program group had already seen the figure sitting next to Jing Yuanzhou.He wore a simple white shirt with the neckline opened a bit casually. One hand was raising a coffee cup to his mouth to take a sip while the other hand was operating the mouse to adjust his equipment.It was Lin Yan, the head coach of the GH team.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just started to organize his desktop slowly.He took advantage of his first broadcast in the GH team to control the rhythm regarding Chen Yushen\u2019s matter. Now the barrage was scrolling but he didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. After finishing tidying up the desktop icons, he glanced at it and found that the content of the discussion had changed.[Titans, are you going to do a doubles game with the person sitting next to you?][Does GH\u2019s coach usually have to train?][Ahh, the parent combination is online for business! AWSL!][What parent combination?][Didn\u2019t you pay attention to the Burning Hot Assembly\u2019s official Weibo? The photos will show you a whole new world.[Taking someone in a doubles game as soon as the broadcast starts? Can\u2019t you give priority to the feelings of the technique fans?][Even if he shows it, can you learn Titans\u2019 technique?][Is it really appropriate for the coach to drag players to gain points? GH is worthy of being GH. They don\u2019t bother hiding the unspoken rules at all.][Fuck, the mention of unspoken rules killed me! Why did I suddenly make up all types of forced play scenes?]Jing Yuanzhou usually shielded the barrage during the live broadcasts. However, after seeing it for a while today, he suddenly felt it was a bit pleasing to the eye. He didn\u2019t shield it.Meanwhile, Lin Yan had finished preparing his equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s fine now.\u201dJing Yuanzhou sent a team invitation and spoke casually. \u201cYou can sit in this position in the future or you will need to re-adjust every time. It\u2019s troublesome.\u201dThe position of the official players in the training room was always fixed. Since Lin Yan was a coach, he always used any computer and had never been concerned about where to sit. Now he heard this sentence and felt that it was true. He nodded. \u201cOkay, I will sit next to you.\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cVery good.\u201dThe entered the queue and the matching was soon completed. The two of them entered the game.Jing Yuanzhou was wearing soundproof headphones. In order to make it easier for him to hear, Lin Yan moved the microphone hanging around his neck to his mouth when speaking. \u201cWhat position am I playing?\u201dJing Yuanzhou casually banned a hero. \u201cAnything is fine.\u201dLin Yan let out a sound of agreement and started typing in the chat box.[Hot Summoner Three: I will fill in any position.]Once the words \u2018Hot Summoner\u2019 appeared in the chat channel, those in the live broadcast room found that the IDs of the two sides were all hidden, leaving only the unified system name.This was obviously the display method of the Ladder Glory tournament.The so-called \u2018Ladder Glory Tournament\u2019 was a mode that distinguished itself from ordinary rankings because it didn\u2019t display the game ID. It was especially popular with professional players and well-known anchors.In addition, only the top 200 accounts in the rankings were eligible to participate in the Ladder Glory Tournament so compared to ranking mode, the Ladder Glory Tournament could be called a must for players in the national server. The final ranking would often be used to assess personal strength and it was one of the most hard-core indicators.Even many professional players didn\u2019t dare be so blindly confident in this tournament. Therefore, as soon as Lin Yan\u2019s words came out, the fans instinctively felt that he was ready to lie down completely and the barrage scrolled.[Is he ready to lie down and win using Titans?][Taking someone to gain points in the glory tournament? It has been a long time!][Did the coach come to pit Titans? Sisters, do any of you remember if Titans was using his main account or side account just now?][The upstairs person, the one displayed on the game lobby just now seemed to be\u2026 his main account.][Fuck! Don\u2019t drop the ranking of the main account. Titans, blink if you\u2019ve been kidnapped!][How can you play any position? If you are finding someone to help you then shouldn\u2019t you be obedient and play support? Then the danger can be minimized.][Oh my god, don\u2019t pit our Titans for glory. Please, other big brothers and sisters, leave him the support position.][Spirit of heaven and earth, spirit of all gods!]As if hearing the prayers of the fans, the other teammates marked the positions they were good at and finally left Lin Yan as the jungler. There was a series of ellipsis in the live broadcast room.Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the barrage and remembered that the third episode of the variety show wouldn\u2019t be shown until next week. Fans hadn\u2019t yet seen Lin Yan\u2019s jungler skills. He couldn\u2019t help smiling as he comforted them, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we can carry.\u201dLin Yan wasn\u2019t watching Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s live broadcast room and didn\u2019t know the situation of the barrage.The BP section ended and the game officially started. He finally put on the headphones hanging around his neck and spoke casually when he heard those words. \u201cYes, jiayou.\u201dThe fans subjectively ignored the \u2018we\u2019 in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s words and vomited up blood again.[5555. Of course I know that you can carry. I am mainly afraid that your teammate is too bad!][I\u2019m closed up. What about the most ruthless man? Titans, are you so good-tempered when taking people with you?][I didn\u2019t take it seriously when people mentioned the parent combination previously but why do I feel like it is true now? Whatever my partner says is correct?][I also want to be taken by Titans. I want to lie down and score points.][Person above, I think you want to eat more farts.][I want to scold people but when hearing Titans tone, why is there such affection? I want to cry.][Yes, jiayou. Why do I feel so irritated when hearing this? It is as if Titans is responsible for all the scores. Don\u2019t deliver your head to the other side!]Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the barrage but no longer spoke. He bought the equipment and followed Lin Yan out of the highlands. He headed directly to the lane while Lin Yan circled the map and quietly entered the other side\u2019s jungle. The nickname on the other side was also a system nickname and the specific identity was unknown.However, the fact that they could be matched in this tournament meant they obviously weren\u2019t weak. After a simple test, the opponent knew Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s depth. They kept their half-remaining health and started to develop in a wretched manner behind the soldiers.Due to the words at the beginning of the game, the fans thought that Jing Yuanzhou would be very cruel to carry the whole game. Unexpectedly, he actually developed peacefully with the other person.Time passed in the blink of an eye. Two minutes later, fans thought about the teammate dragging things down and were anxious. Then they abruptly saw a kill prompt on the screen.[First Blood!]The first head in the game appeared and it was done by Lin Yan who the fans thought would \u2018drag\u2019 the team down.All the fans worried about Titans on the barrage were instantly: !!!Just then, the silent Jing Yuanzhou opened his mouth. \u201cCome to the lane and help me?\u201dLin Yan hummed with agreement. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201dHalf a minute later, the opposite player died under the siege of the two men. In fact, the opponent\u2019s reaction speed was already fast but Lin Yan\u2019s ganking angle was really tricky. The back road was completely blocked and there was no chance of escape.Jing Yuanzhou also deliberately paused with the last skill and quietly gave the head to Lin Yan. Just then, the shadow black dragon refreshed on the map. Lin Yan ran to the canyon without hesitation after taking away the head. He saw that Jing Yuanzhou also followed him to fight the dragon and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cAren\u2019t you going back to the city to restore your state?\u201dThere might still be a small amount of health remaining but the opposite side had resurrected in a full state. Jing Yuanzhou would inevitably suffer when the health volume was uneven.Jing Yuanzhou replied, \u201cYou helped me kill someone so I should help you fight the dragon.\u201dHe paused before continuing, \u201cIf I can\u2019t beat the opponent later, I will call you. Come and help me catch another wave.\u201dIt seemed reasonable but Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help wanting to laugh. He directly asked, \u201cTitans, can you really not fight them or do you simply want to squeeze out my labor?\u201dIn the wave when he caught the opponent just now, he could see that the other person truly wasn\u2019t weak. It was just that they weren\u2019t on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s level.He really didn\u2019t believe that Jing Yuanzhou was a person who couldn\u2019t complete a single kill.Jing Yuanzhou helped Lin Yan fight the dragon and returned to his lane. He cleared the line of soldiers and spoke without any psychological burden. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that I couldn\u2019t fight. I just feel more secure when you are there.\u201dThere was a moment of silence in the voice channel before all the fans heard a low laugh from someone. The sound might be heard across the screen but it felt like a hand was touching their hearts. The barrage went crazy.[Ahhhhh, these two people are real!!!][Fuck fuck fuck. Coach Lin killed me! I really can\u2019t stand it!][No, I was clearly watching a doubles game before. What is this weird teasing sensation?][I was wrong. The coach is mighty. Coach, protect Titans!][This damn old husband and wife have a sense of vision\u2026][Why isn\u2019t there the coach\u2019s perspective? The laugh just now made me feel a bit weak.][Fuck, this is just the beginning. I doubt I can carry it until the end of the live broadcast.][Titans: I\u2019m weak, I\u2019m helpless, I need protection.][??? Why can you say such a thing?]Of course, there were occasional technique fans who focused on other issues.[Did GH\u2019s coach use to be a jungler? This rhythm is very slippery!][Why become a coach with this strength?][This awareness is really great. I would be completely shut down if I was the opposite jungler.][He doesn\u2019t give a chance at all.][Hahaha, why do I think that Coach Lin is the one taking Titans to gain points?]Lin Yan had a really good rhythm. His long-term behind the scenes analysis experience let him control the entire field to the point of perfection.After helping Jing Yuanzhou, he ruled the jungle on the opposite side of the map. In addition, every time he passed the middle lane, he would assist the mid-laner in gaining a head. The development of the opposite side was squeezed to such a great extent and the shooter in the bottom lane also won a lot of room to develop.At the end of the game, the MVP undoubtedly went to Lin Yan. He took off the headphones and let out a sigh. It was as he said before. He really felt good about Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice. At least, there was no obvious rejection after one round. He had to admit that the man\u2019s voice simply satisfied all his preferences.The game just now completely aroused the emotions of the fans. They obviously hadn\u2019t expected the coach of the team to be so strong. They were waiting for it to continue only to see Jing Yuanzhou suddenly stand up.After a while, a figure holding a cup passed by the camera. His distant voice was heard through the microphone that wasn\u2019t closed. \u201cThank you. Take me to play two more games?\u201dThen they heard Lin Yan laugh. \u201cOkay, I will satisfy you.\u201dThe live broadcast: Cough cough cough\u2026Satisfy what? Who was he satisfying? Tell them clearly! They were afraid the two people were going the wrong way!Jing Yuanzhou sat back in position and the double games continued. In the second game, everyone expected Lin Yan to continue playing the jungler but he instead got the position of support. The barrage was once again filled with a series of ellipses. Don\u2019t ask, asking was just wanting to be hit with the truth.As a support, Lin Yan chose the safest method and ran to follow the shooter in the bottom lane. In this way, there was no one to care about Jing Yuanzhou and he had to take on the heavy responsibility of the carry. He quickly pushed the lane and led the team to win another round.In the third game, Lin Yan played as the shooter. This time, the top and bottom lanes were both pushed. After the two lanes blossomed, the middle lane also rose to the sky. Three games in a row and three different positions. Just as the fans were waiting to see more surprises, they found that Lin Yan didn\u2019t continue and instead quit the team channel.On the camera, Jing Yuanzhou glanced sideways. \u201cTired?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s lazy voice came through the headset with a slightly sleepy, nasal tone. \u201cYes, I don\u2019t want to play anymore.\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t have to ask to know that this person must\u2019ve stayed up late yesterday. \u201cThen don\u2019t play.\u201dThe fans were thrilled when they heard it. They felt these words were full of pampering.Screams filled the barrage until\u2026 after Jing Yuanzhou finished speaking, he didn\u2019t hesitate to quit the game. \u201cI will end the live broadcast here. See you next time.\u201dHis operation was so skillful that it was too late to catch him. The screen instantly went dark.There was only the barrage that didn\u2019t have time to react and was still filled with countless screams. Many people were still on the topic of guessing the next position that Coach Lin would play in the game.They had only watched a few games but they somehow got the feeling that Coach Lin had the label of an all-rounder. Of course, the most important thing was that the atmosphere between the two men in the doubles game was really great.There might have only been a few interactions but there had always been the feeling of something unclear, making people\u2019s hearts itch. All the enthusiasm of the fans was mobilized but once the screen of the live broadcast room turned dark, only question marks remained.It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to call it a bolt from the blue. Who would\u2019ve thought Titans would really be so callous! Had he considered the feelings of his fans???The author has something to say:Jing Yuanzhou: You don\u2019t understand. This is called following Coach Lin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They could only flow into the live broadcast rooms of the other GH members in batches.Bi Yaohua didn\u2019t care about the identity of the audience. Give him a stage and he would be able to talk. The audience who left discovered what it was like in Trash Talk King\u2019s live broadcast room when they came back.There were still some people talking but the scolding on the barrage had lessened obviously. It wasn\u2019t because they had been persuaded. These people finally realized that the legends of the world were real. \u2018Don\u2019t compete with the king. You will be killed if you commit a lot of injustices.\u2019Due to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s words during the live broadcast, Titans\u2019s fans, who had been on the sidelines, didn\u2019t watch idly anymore. They listened to their player and entered the field one after another, helping fight against the GH team\u2019s brainless black fans. There was the influx of new traffic and the entire situation was gradually controlled.Lin Yan lay down on the sofa in the blind spot and held the glass of water that Jing Yuanzhou had poured him. He moved around the live broadcast rooms and showed a satisfied smile. Sometimes, blind justification would just make one passive. It was the appropriate inducement of positive public opinion that opened up a new path.Lin Yan exited the live broadcast rooms and opened the calendar to glance at the date. He knew that the netizens\u2019 attention on the youth training camp events should pass soon.Two days later was the start of the mid-season.According to the rules of the Burning Hot League, the annual spring and autumn championship teams would be ranked according to their total points and would appear as the first and second seeds respectively. In contrast, the two runner-up teams would compete with two other teams with the highest ranking points in the mid-season to participate in the global qualifying rounds, competing for the remaining two places.For this reason, the mid-season might not be as important as the spring and autumn competitions but it still attracted attention as one of the official competitions to qualify for the World Finals.The GH team had no qualifications to participate in professional events and could only wait to win the variety show to participate in the next autumn competition. They had no chance with the mid-season. Still, this didn\u2019t affect their interest in official events.On the first day of the mid-season, everyone gathered in the meeting room to watch the match live.In the opening match in the morning, Luni\u2019s veteran LDF team played against the new MEN team that had just been promoted from the secondary league.At present, the strength of every team in the league was actually relatively average. There might indeed be a slight level of difference but even the top team LDF with Luni could lose to MEN if they made a mistake on the field.In any case, it was the opening match and both teams were in very good condition. There were collisions as soon as the game started and this brought the atmosphere at the scene to the highest point.Bi Yaohua hadn\u2019t dared to look down on Luni since hearing Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s analysis.He watched the fierce situation on the field and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about anything else, a mid-laner like Luni is really stable. Every time there is a team battle, he can always do something. If he wants to advance or retreat then he will. There is a person with such a steady rhythm, tut\u2026 it is a pity that LDF\u2019s shooter really isn\u2019t good. They have created such a good output environment for him. Even if there aren\u2019t any five kills, why can\u2019t he do a three against one fight? At this standard, I don\u2019t know how he joined LDF in the first place.\u201dNext to him, Gu Luo couldn\u2019t help glancing over like he wanted to say something.Bi Yaohua noticed this gaze and cleared his throat. \u201cCough, Gloy, I don\u2019t mean that you are bad\u2026 everyone has their own fighting style. I think you have a special sense of self. Just keep it regardless of how Luni fights! After all, it is up to you to carry when I can\u2019t!\u201dGu Luo, \u201c\u2026Thank you for your approval.\u201dUnknowingly, it was already halfway through the second game of the BO3. After LDF won the first game, their momentum was extremely high and there was another wave of destruction. Lin Yan saw Luni standing alone on the field and announced, \u201cCongratulations to LDF for advancing. It is already stable.\u201dMEN lost but they played wonderfully. Despite being a new team, they didn\u2019t show any timidity when facing LDF. This was already very valuable. The two sides shook hands after the match and the audience applauded warmly.Lin Yan saved the video of the two games in his archive and turned to the match schedule. Then he assigned tasks to the others. \u201cEveryone\u2019s training schedule has been very full recently but if you have time, I hope you can spare some to watch all the games in the mid-season. Each game must be seen no less than three times. I will occasionally check and ask questions.\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy three times?\u201d\u201cI want you to thoroughly get to know them in the shortest time and remember them.\u201d Lin Yan glanced around indifferently. His tone might be slow but his words hit their hearts. \u201cEvery team here might become your most difficult opponent on the field in the future.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked over.Lin Yan smiled meaningfully when he said this. \u201cDon\u2019t think that everything about the professional league has nothing to do with us because we are still recording a variety show. The mid-season has already begun. How long is it until the autumn competition? Two months. The time left for us is two months. Do you think you are really ready?\u201dEveryone couldn\u2019t help their backs stiffening as an unprecedented sense of urgency fell over them. In the silence, a low voice was heard. \u201cCoach, I promise I will work hard!\u201dNo one thought that the most taciturn Chen Yushen would be the only one speaking at this time.The other members were somewhat taken aback before their expressions gradually became firm. \u201cCoach, we will be prepared!\u201dA bright smile flashed on Lin Yan\u2019s face. \u201cYes, you are the best.\u201dFreestarThe opening match finished and the entire e-sports circle was plunged into a tense atmosphere. Even the sunspots no longer concentrated their energy on the GH team. The eight teams were vying for tickets for the World Qualifying Tournament. Which fans didn\u2019t want the team they supported to stand on the fierce battlefield of the World Finals?A full day of training passed. Jing Yuanzhou was returning to his room when the opposite door opened. He looked up and saw Lin Yan leaning against the door with a smile. Lin Yan had obviously just taken a shower. The towel was hung around his neck and his wet hair draped docilely against the side of his face. A faint fragrance came from the water vapor.Jing Yuanzhou looked down at this person for a moment before asking, \u201cWhat is this? Do you want room service?\u201d\u201cForget it today. I will consider it another day.\u201d Lin Yan answered casually. He calmly watched Jing Yuanzhou before suddenly asking, \u201cDo you have time tomorrow to accompany me to watch a match in person?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was startled for a moment. \u201cTomorrow afternoon?\u201dIt was BK\u2019s first match of the season.Lin Yan shook his mobile phone. \u201cI\u2019ve already spoken to the program and said you won\u2019t participate in this live broadcast. In fact, I planned to watch the match online but I felt that it has been a long time since I\u2019ve experienced the atmosphere at the scene. Therefore, I asked Luo Mo to help me get two tickets. It\u2019s the inner area in a good location. Do you want to go?\u201dJing Yuanzhou remembered the call from Ku Tianlu during the training period that night and couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly. \u201cOf course.\u201dDuring the call, Ku Tianlu had said that Lan Min\u2019s condition had been maintained very well since the last time he visited the GH base. Still, this was the first time fighting for the BK team. Ku Tianlu hoped the former god would come to watch to bless the team\u2019s stable performance.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t think he had this type of blessing function but previously, he had never imagined that there would be a time when he felt worried like an old father. He received the call from Ku Tianlu and the two of them unknowingly chatted a bit longer.In the process, Lin Yan had gone out twice to the corridor to smoke. Now it seemed he had overheard. Not only did he hear it but he also took it to heart. Thinking of this, Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help glancing at the person in front of him who had just come out of the shower.Lin Yan got the answer he had wanted and was obviously satisfied. \u201cThen I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Go to bed early.\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze crossed the gap beside him and landed on the open laptop screen on the desk. He gave a reminder. \u201cYou should also go to bed early.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They boarded the club\u2019s van and set off for the match, ignoring the envious looks.Some of the other players wanted to complain about the two people\u2019s behavior of going to watch alone. However, Lin Yan had said it was an official invitation and they could only silently swallow down the tears of jealousy and wish the two people a smooth journey.It was around an hour\u2019s drive to the venue. Lin Yan had stayed up late again last night and fell asleep after getting into the car. Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the sleeping face with amusement. Then he thought of Lin Yan coming to watch the match with him despite a lack of sleep and his heart was vaguely moved.He asked the driver to turn down the background music and took out his phone to send a message to Ku Tianlu, stating that he was on the road.He soon received a reply from Ku Tianlu who was apparently shocked after receiving the message: [Are you really coming to watch the match? I just spoke casually yesterday. There is no need to be nervous. Mini has been in good condition recently and the team is fine. Isn\u2019t it just playing in the first round? Don\u2019t worry, nothing will go wrong.]Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help smiling. [I\u2019m not here to see you.]Ku Tianlu: [??? Stop making trouble. If you aren\u2019t watching us when going to see the match, what are you watching? Don\u2019t tell me you are here to see the opponent PILL?]Jing Yuanzhou: [I was invited by someone, privately invited.]Ku Tianlu: [\u2026\u2026]Jing Yuanzhou: [You can think of it as a date.]Ku Tianlu: [\u2026\u2026\u2026]Who wanted to pay attention to his dates?!Jing Yuanzhou glanced sideways at the person sleeping next to him and adjusted the falling blanket. Then he continued to type: [I\u2019m not going to see the BK team. I just want to take the opportunity to get the feeling of being an audience member. Don\u2019t worry about telling Mini about my arrival. Now BK\u2019s battlefield is his stage. I will give him a surprise.]Ku Tianlu: [Understood.]Then he couldn\u2019t help asking: [The person with you, is it\u2026 the coach?]Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t directly answer: [The match is just around the corner. Is it really appropriate to gossip here, Captain Ku?]Ku Tianlu was stunned by the sudden business talk and found that he really couldn\u2019t speak to this person. [Fuck, I\u2019m going to arrange the final tactics. Goodbye!]Jing Yuanzhou smiled and glanced contentedly to the side. One thing had to be admitted. From the very first meeting, he felt that Lin Yan\u2019s face was the type he liked. Even now, he felt like he would never get tired of it.Lin Yan woke up and found the car parked in the parking lot. There was still some time before the match started so Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t been in a hurry to wake him up. Lin Yan opened his eyes and stared at the car roof for a while before remembering where he was. He stretched his body and tidied up his messy hair.The driver looked back from the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cShould I drive the car to the inner area?\u201dGenerally during a match, the league officials would arrange an independent venue to facilitate the parking of players from major clubs who came to watch the match. There was also a dedicated passage for entering the stadium. The purpose was to prevent players from being recognized by fans and causing unnecessary agitation.Lin Yan was arranging the tickets. He heard this and nodded while taking out the passes. \u201cGo in.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter where his ticket was checked. After all, his current status wasn\u2019t much different from an amateur\u2019s. However, Jing Yuanzhou was different. He was a top player in the league, not to mention that this afternoon was the BK team\u2019s match. His identity was undoubtedly more special.Lin Yan thought of this and glanced at Jing Yuanzhou, \u201cShould we greet the director in advance?\u201dEveryone needed to pass the ticket check when entering the stadium and professional players were no surprise. The league\u2019s staff naturally became familiar with everyone\u2019s positions. There wouldn\u2019t be a situation where the spectators area was overwhelmed by the crowd but it was normal to create some gimmicks with close-up shots during the match. In addition, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s identity as the former captain of BK was still hot. If they didn\u2019t greet the camera director in advance then once the audience saw Jing Yuanzhou appearing at the site of BK\u2019s match, it would definitely cause great agitation. It might be a fatal bomb for the diehard fans of the BK team.To put it another way, it was possible that just showing his face would accidentally take away all the headlines of today\u2019s e-sports magazines. It was naturally safest to greet the director in advance and keep a low profile.However, Jing Yuanzhou replied lightly, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cReally no?\u201dJing Yuanzhou met his gaze and inexplicably smiled. \u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you want the attention?\u201d\u201cWell, of course I want it but\u2026\u201d Lin Yan cleared his throat. \u201cOur club\u2019s popularity is currently sufficient and there is no shortage of attention.\u201dThe expression in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes changed slightly and he glanced at the BK support cards that were faintly flashing from the distant ticket gate. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m missing some.\u201dLin Yan paused a bit before understanding Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s meaning. It was to make a thorough farewell to the connection between Titans and BK.Lin Yan was silent for a moment before smiling. \u201cThank you God Jing for the free traffic.\u201dJing Yuanzhou lowered his eyes slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dIt was almost time for the driver to stop the car in the inner field. The two people put on caps and masks before getting out of the car. They completed the ticket check-in, headed through the dedicated passage, and entered the inner field.Jing Yuanzhou was looking for the location of their seats when he found another detail. It might be the inner field but the tickets LIn Yan bought weren\u2019t in the area where professional players gathered. It was all the way on the other side where Internet celebrity streamers and other people in the circle sat. This was obviously to avoid embarrassment when seeing his old opponents.Jing Yuanzhou had this thought and couldn\u2019t help silently watching the back of the person leading the way.Since the two of them were almost late, the pre-match preparations were in full swing. The commentators at the scene were working hard to liven up the atmosphere. As usual, the director repeatedly switched the camera to the audience on the big screen.Occasionally, a few familiar faces would be seen. Every time the professional players greeted the audience through the camera, a wave of restlessness occurred and the screams became even louder.Lin Yan found that Luni, who just finished the match yesterday, also appeared on the camera. He couldn\u2019t help whispering into Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s ear, \u201cGuess when the director is going to show you?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s ears were slightly itchy because of this behavior and he moved close. \u201cMy guess is that it should be the finale.\u201dLin Yan looked up and saw that Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s bangs were slightly messy after taking off the cap. He reached out and carefully said, \u201cYou mentioned you want to give me free traffic. Pay more attention to the club\u2019s appearance and remember\u2026\u201dBefore he finished his words, he suddenly felt that the originally restless scene had fallen quiet. Lin Yan had a bad feeling and looked up to see the man in the center of the big screen also raising his head in confusion.Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dBefore he could take back the hand placed on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s head, the short silence ended and there was an eruption of screams that completely overturned the roof.The two of them wore casual clothing today and masks that basically covered most of their faces. There were no other players around so when the director first cut the camera over, their affectionate actions caused the official commentators to consider them a same-sex couple watching the match together.Fortunately, their professional instincts meant the commentators didn\u2019t tease the men. After a short pause, they recognized Jing Yuanzhou through the mask.Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the camera that was always focused on his body and took off the mask with a calm expression. Then he raised the support card he bought before entering the venue. On the flashing sign, the words \u2018Bk jiayou, Mini jiayou\u2019 shone again and again.The official commentator couldn\u2019t help being slightly stunned by Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s actions. A bit of time passed before he managed to find his voice and he joked in as relaxed a manner as possible, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect for even TItans to come. The one sitting next to him seems to be Coach Lin of the GH team? He is holding the BK team\u2019s support card. I don\u2019t know how GH feels about Titans\u2019s move of \u2018longing to be somewhere else\u2019?\u201dLin Yan gestured to the camera in a timely manner, silently expressing his firm support of his player. However, it was clear that no one cared about such a lively interaction.The scene that lasted a few seconds had already stirred up a thousand waves with a single stone. It made the already boiling match venue completely become a turbulent ocean. The desired effect was received and the director moved the camera away in a timely manner.A large part of the audience were supporters of BK. Their biggest worry for the mid-season was whether the new player Mini could take over Titans\u2019s position.They all knew that Lan Min was Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s only apprentice but his previous matches were always in situations where Jing Yuanzhou was present. Now he was completely alone and some of the BK fans were anxious.Titans\u2019s sudden transfer was always like a thorn in their hearts. The emptiness after the sudden poaching was even more disturbing. Fans had new expectations about BK\u2019s future results but there was a trace of uncertainty that couldn\u2019t be erased.They didn\u2019t know how far the team could go without Titans but they were careful not to let the players feel more pressure because of their worry. These emotions finally collapsed completely when they saw Jing Yuanzhou at the scene.They were once perplexed, confused and even angry due to Titans\u2019s departure. However, the fans who supported BK had a voice in their hearts telling them that no player would easily leave the team he had been loyal to for many years and the teammates he had fought with. In fact, they were very clear that the so-called complaints and doubts could only be attributed to their reluctance and regret. Even so, they couldn\u2019t help wanting to complain.No one thought that Titans would appear in their vision again in such a way. It was in the stadium of the BK team with the name of the BK team written on a support card. Even if he no longer played for BK, the Titans that once belonged to BK was like the fans. He hoped the BK team could go up step by step, becoming better.Inexplicable feelings poured into their hearts and sorrow instantly made their hearts a mess. It wasn\u2019t known who choked it out first but the BK fans learned from Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s support card and started shouting, \u201cBK jiayou, Mini jiayou! BK jiayou, Mini jiayou! BK jiayou, Mini jiayou!\u2014!\u201dThe entire venue was completely filled with such a sound. Among the voices of the audience, some hysterical shouts could be heard from time to time, \u201cTitans, we are waiting for you to come back!\u201dLin Yan was moved by such an atmosphere. \u201cThis support card is really worth 35 yuan. Remember to transfer it to me when we get back.\u201dFreestarJing Yuanzhou had been silent the whole time. Now he looked back and his expressionless face finally showed a slight smile. He leaned over to whisper into Lin Yan\u2019s ear, \u201cI listened to you and paid attention to the appearance of our club. Do you think my performance just now was good enough?\u201dThe low voice was instantly swallowed by the shouts, leaving nothing but the residual heat on his ear. Lin Yan felt like something was burning on his skin and cleared his throat. \u201cForget it, I will report the 35 yuan to the team\u2019s expenses.\u201dThis could probably be understood as approval of his performance just now.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s lips silently curved up. \u201cThank you Boss.\u201dResults of the voting for my celebration event are out.

    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJust before the match, Jing Yuanzhou received a WeChat message from Lan Min. [Master, I will definitely do my best!]Obviously, he already knew that Jing Yuanzhou was there. Jing Yuanzhou smiled and placed his phone back in his pocket.The members of BK and PILL came to the stage to check their equipment. They had obviously been covered up by makeup but on the big screen, Lan Min\u2019s reddish eyes could still be still. It seemed even that he felt a bit embarrassed. He instinctively lowered his head the moment the camera moved to him.Lin Yan saw this with interest and couldn\u2019t help touching Jing Yuanzhou gently with his elbow. \u201cWhere did you find this baby apprentice? His tear glands are so talented!\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought of the night he met Lan Min for the first time. Lan Min had indeed cried bitterly so Lin Yan guessed it. He couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cI didn\u2019t find him. He found me.\u201dAlthough it had to be admitted that in some ways, his attention really was first attracted because of the crying appearance. Nervous and helpless yet with a firmness that was rarely seen.The crowd cheered warmly and the match officially began. Lan Min might often cry at normal times but once he stood on the field, he seemed a lot more stable. Perhaps it was to prove himself in front of the person he respected most. The moment Lan Min was online, he firmly pressed PILL\u2019s player under the tower and played with full momentum.It was well-known that the tactics of the BK team always had the side lane player as the core. After Lan Min took over Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s position, they didn\u2019t make any additional adjustments. The jungler Ku Tianlu still moved around the upper half of the map waiting for opportunities while firmly controlling the surrounding vision.BK\u2019s early rhythm was very stable. Even the commentators made it clear that the team had digested the change in members fairly well. In the end, Lan Min lived up to everyone\u2019s expectations. In the first game of the BO3 match, BK smoothly pushed the lane.They grasped the initiative and won the final victory. Applause thundered through the venue.The second game started and it was evident that their opponents PILL had made targeted adjustments. It could be seen that they changed their previous routine and started madly targeting Lan Min\u2019s top lane. This meant that Ku Tianlu and the mid-laner of the BK team had to start frequenting this lane. Yet even with their protection, this fast rhythm put unprecedented pressure on Lan Min.The top half of the map was completely shrouded in gunpowder smoke. Excessive care not only restricted Lan Min\u2019s development but it also made the overall rhythm of BK quite chaotic.At 15 minutes, Lin Yan analyzed the situation on the field. \u201cYour little apprentice is a bit miserable this round. PILL\u2019s tactic to target the top lane is really too bad. They are putting so much energy into the top half of the map. Aren\u2019t they afraid of creating an imbalance in the later rhythm?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze fell on the score. \u201cJust see if Mini can hold on.\u201dLin Yan nodded. \u201cIndeed, it is enough to hold on. I think BK is already making adjustments.\u201dAnyone who paid a bit of attention to the situation on the field could see that Ku Tianlu\u2019s range of activity had completely switched to the bottom half of the map. Apart from BK\u2019s mid-laner who would occasionally go to protect Lan Min who was caught by three or four players, it was basically a situation of letting Lan Min fend for himself.It could be seen from a god\u2019s perspective on the big screen then when four people from PILL attacked the tower on the top level, the other members of BK were quickly pushing the defensive towers on the bottom lane and advancing like crazy. PILL\u2019s support noticed the situation was wrong and quickly returned to the city to support the bottom shooter.Lan Min guarded the tower alone. The situation had changed from one against four to one against three but it was still very difficult.Lin Yan shook his head emotionally. \u201cIt is only the first round. Do both sides need to play so hard? Is this seeing who can best resist pressure?\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t speak and just watched quietly.The pressure resistance of the top and bottom lanes became the most important thing. The director frantically switched the perspective back and forth and the voices of the official commentators were also passionate.It might be a situation of one against many enemies but Lan Min was using a melee hero after all. It was more difficult to fight than the shooter\u2019s long-range output. The pressure was undoubtedly huge if he wanted to hold on against the three members of PILL.Fortunately, he finally carried the heavy burden. By this time, the game had been going on for 35 minutes. The two teams advanced separately but it was the BK team who broke through the defense line of PILL\u2019s bottom lane first and pressed to the high ground. Meanwhile, BK\u2019s defense tower under Lan Min\u2019s protection still had one-third of its health remaining.PILL had no way and had to temporarily withdraw to defend. However, in the process of returning to the city, Lan Min suddenly rushed out from the defense tower. The grass blocked his vision so he blindly used the collision skill based on instinct, interrupting the two people\u2019s transmission and forcing them to stay behind.His residual health meant he died under their concentrated fire. However, at the same time, the other members of BK pushed all the way and smashed the crystal of the opponent\u2019s base. BK won the first match of the season with a score of 2:0!Lin Yan smiled when he heard the cheers on the field. \u201cCongratulations, your little apprentice is the MVP.\u201dIn this game, he showed his stability and his identity as the new side lane player of the BK team. Putting aside other factors, the management of BK weren\u2019t fools. They were willing to take a big risk to promote Lan Min in advance because he had the potential to be a new star!As the winning team, BK went to shake hands with the losing team. The director cut the camera there and it could be seen that Lan Min\u2019s eyes were red.He was teary as he shook hands with the PILL players one by one. As the winning MVP, he stood in front of the camera, his shoulders trembling and his words coming out intermittently. \u201cThank you for your support\u2026 and I want to thank my teammates for their company and encouragement. I-I will continue to work hard to make myself stronger. In addition\u2026\u201dHe wiped his tears with the back of his hand and stared at the camera with red eyes but a firm expression. \u201cMaster, I am waiting for you to come back. I\u2019m waiting for you!\u201dJing Yuanzhou watched the big screen and smiled slightly when he heard the shouts of \u2018Don\u2019t cry Mini\u2019 in his ears.Suddenly, his vision dimmed and there was only a faint light. It was Lin Yan who placed the cap back on his head.In the blink of an eye, Lin Yan was completely covered and stood up from his seat. He noticed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze and raised his eyebrow. \u201cWhat? Aren\u2019t you going back? It isn\u2019t enough to watch the match. Are you planning to stay and celebrate with BK?\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed and lowered the edge of his hat, covering most of his face. \u201cYes, let\u2019s go back.\u201dThe two of them were already back in the car when he got the call from Lan Min.Lin Yan was sitting by the window and listened to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s words. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t intentional. I had time today and came to see the match. You played well and made great progress\u2026 Don\u2019t worry, strength is the best proof. If I have to make a suggestion, it\u2019s better to cry less in front of the camera. There\u2019s nothing else for the time being.\u201dThere was a slight pause before a low laugh was heard. \u201cI am in the car already. I still have training tonight\u2026 Yes, I won\u2019t stay for dinner. Let\u2019s get together when I have time. You can listen more to Captain Ku.\u201dLin Yan felt that he couldn\u2019t listen anymore. He suddenly leaned forward and spoke into the phone, \u201cI say, crybaby kid, Titans is now a member of our GH team. You should be conscious of your identity as a player of the BK team. Isn\u2019t it a bit bad to always pester people?\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked down at Lin Yan and a smile flashed on his face. He casually turned on speaker mode and sent it over. This attitude showed he wasn\u2019t afraid of chaos in the world.The word \u2018crybaby\u2019 was enough for Lan Min to judge Lin Yan\u2019s identity. He instantly exclaimed, \u201cWho is the crybaby! Today was just because I was too excited about Master. I didn\u2019t mean to cry! In addition, I\u2019m just having a phone call with Master! Why is it bad?\u201dThe phone was held by Jing Yuanzhou while Lin Yan spoke half-truths and half-lies. \u201cWho is the Master? Now you aren\u2019t players in the same club. Isn\u2019t it good for everyone to be so reserved? I\u2019m warning you, it wasn\u2019t easy for Titans to completely break off his relationship with your BK today. Avoid the horrible idea of having a celebration together. Before fans forget the previous relationship, keep as far away from him as possible, understood?\u201dIn fact, after Lan Min was ravaged by the solo games that day, he went back and thought about it. Then he understood Lin Yan\u2019s good intentions. He was now very grateful from the bottom of his heart. He wanted to find an opportunity to say thank you but he was interrupted like this and became completely dizzy. \u201cCoach Lin, do you know what these words sound like?\u201dLin Yan asked casually, \u201cHmm? What do they sound like?\u201dLan Min gritted his teeth. \u201cIt is like a second wife watching her husband closely to prevent him from getting involved with his previous wife!\u201dLin Yan was stunned by such a shocking description.Jing Yuanzhou let out a low cough before laughing.Lin Yan turned his head and glared at Jing Yuanzhou. Then his lips curved up in a smile and on a whim, he continued to fight with Lan Min. \u201cYes, your master is now mine. I like to watch him closely and don\u2019t want him to have an unclear relationship with his old love. Is there any problem? I just don\u2019t want him involved with you or any other teams. Titans is mine for the rest of his life and it can only be me. How about it? Aren\u2019t you angry? It is a pity that it is useless to be angry. Your master didn\u2019t stay to celebrate with you and chose to take the car back with me to eat dinner. Are you even angrier?\u201dLan Min had racked his brains to think of words to choke Lin Yan. He didn\u2019t expect this person to answer with no burden. A long time passed before he finally choked out some words. \u201cYou\u2026 are stinky and shameless!\u201dLin Yan sighed. \u201cWhat can I do? Your master likes this stinky and shameless me.\u201dThere was no sound on the other end of the phone. Then Ku Tianlu\u2019s voice was heard from a distance. \u201cMini, what are you doing? Be careful, this bag contains your equipment. You can\u2019t drop it!\u201dThe child was obviously angry.Lin Yan liked to poke at people\u2019s sore spots and was even happier after hearing these words. \u201cWhy? You don\u2019t believe it? If you don\u2019t believe me then ask your master!\u201dAt this point, Lan Min was crying again and his tone was very wronged, \u201cMaster\u2026\u201dLin Yan glanced at Jing Yuanzhou. Jing Yuanzhou met this gaze and smiled slightly. \u201cIndeed, I like all the appearances of my wife.\u201dLan Min, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan, \u201c?\u201dLan Min obviously couldn\u2019t accept the reality of his teacher. He finally hung up the phone in a crying manner after Ku Tianlu urged him several times. The moment the call ended, Lin Yan stared coldly at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cHow come I\u2019m a wife? Shouldn\u2019t you explain this?\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked at him innocently. \u201cDidn\u2019t you want me to support you?\u201dLin Yan was speechless for a moment. He tried to refute it but he found that it seemed to be the case.Due to the faintly smiling eyes, Lin Yan inexplicably felt a faint heat rise to his face. His heart thumped as Lin Yan turned to open the car window. He let the cold wind blow and no longer cared about this man\u2019s sophistry.FreestarHalf an hour later, he still couldn\u2019t help cursing in his heart, \u201cFuck!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 57": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThree days later, the third pre-recorded episode was officially broadcasted.Since it was entertainment content with no elimination and the mid-season was currently in full swing, the attention for this episode was significantly lower than the previous two episodes. Still, this didn\u2019t affect the fierce momentum of the coach who took advantage of it to become popular.Apart from everything else, it might have been an entertainment game but it was a match-up against the veteran IBB of the secondary league. The GH team played a bit too fiercely. The barrage of the playback was crazy and various popular clips appeared on video websites.Netizens combined this with Titans\u2019s previous doubles match live broadcast, the ambiguous moments when watching BK\u2019s match, and the tacit and exquisite cooperation on the variety show\u2026 The CP fans of the parent combination felt almost overwhelmed with happiness.Every second of every frame was sweet sugar. It could only be said that the parental love was real!For a team like GH that didn\u2019t have any results, most of the fans were face fans or CP fans. Relatively speaking, there were much less technique fans but the old fans who paid attention to Titans were a bit surprised.The diehard Titans fans naturally weren\u2019t like the girlfriend fans who thought about the emotional world of the players every day. Sometimes, they thought that bringing the fan culture into the field of e-sports was a deformity in itself. Even so, they felt a burst of enthusiasm after watching the two entertainment games.Anyone who followed Titans from his early days knew that originally, this player was extremely radiant on the field. At the same time, he was labelled as \u2018too unique\u2019 and this created controversy. Later, Titans changed a large part of his playing style after the internal reorganization of the NK team. Since then, he completely concealed his sharp edge. He played the role of the pillar of the team and steadily led the team to the peak step by step.No one said the changes made by Titans were bad but as long as they thought of the boy in the past, the old fans would feel deep regret.Now Titans had temporarily withdrawn from the professional league and went to an unknown team like GH but the old fans seemed to vaguely see the Titans who flew freely on the field in that first year. They were in a trance and were filled with expectations, especially after the two entertainment games. Due to the frequent linkage between the side lane and the jungle area, the overwhelming and sharp force seemed to make the dignified color on the Titans ID recede quietly.This feeling was like a dust-covered blade suddenly emerging, still pointing directly at the sky.The old fans were touched. They saw this figure in the video and couldn\u2019t help leaving messages. Thanks to the CP fans and loyal fans, the comments area of GH\u2019s official Weibo was very lively. Of course, many sunspots took the opportunity to fish in troubled waters and stepped on Chen Yushen\u2019s foot in secret.[Is Lin Yan really just the coach of your club? He is so strong. Why doesn\u2019t he consider directly replacing the jungler position?][It isn\u2019t meant for Abyss. The reputation of a player has a great influence on the club. I hope the club seriously considers it.][Ahhh, the parent combination is real, the parent combination is real! KSWL! Asking the officials to keep sending sugar!][I\u2019m a bit moved. I haven\u2019t seen Titans like this on the field for so long. Asking the coach to become a player!][Fuck, I can\u2019t help but get a nosebleed at the sight of Coach Lin and Titans fighting together on the battlefield.][Seriously, if your jungler isn\u2019t good then change it as soon as possible. I think this coach plays much better as has a strong sense of rhythm. There is a ready-made player? You really won\u2019t consider it?][I can\u2019t help thinking of the barrage when Coach Lin first played jungler that day during the doubles game. Those who were laughing so much, doesn\u2019t your face hurt?][Upstairs, don\u2019t say it\u2026 I was so shocked that day. Now I am looking for a good hospital for plastic surgery.][Sincerely begging the two people to team up again. I would exchange ten years of the sunspots\u2019 lives in order to see such an event.]Weibo was boiling. Lin Yan didn\u2019t care but this aroused the attention of all the parties in this circle. Jing Yuanzhou was closest to the professional circle and was naturally the most affected. Unsurprisingly, in the past few days he had received many greetings with ulterior motives. They all beat around the bush but there was no need to ask who they were after.In the beginning, Jing Yuanzhou thought about how they were acquaintances and politely replied. In the end, he simply summed it up in one sentence. \u201cCoach Lin? Our entire GH Club is under his name. If you are interested then ask him. Maybe he will buy you to GH.\u201dIt was really polite but translated, it meant: Coach Lin is the boss behind the GH Club. If he wants to play professionally then he can do so at any time. Don\u2019t think about digging him. If you really want to dig him over then you have to consider buying the entire club.Lin Yan was sitting in front of the computer watching the video materials. He turned around and saw Jing Yuanzhou typing on his phone indifferently and couldn\u2019t help frowning. \u201cWe are so busy. Are they still fishing here?\u201dToday, neither of them participated in the training. They stayed in Lin Yan\u2019s room to sort out the combat data of the QU team for the past few years. Unlike others, the most important task for the GH team was to win the second elimination round instead of the current mid-season.The program had revealed the schedule to them. Due to their win in the entertainment game, they would face the other winners in the next episode, the QU team. At this point, Lin Yan felt that he had been pitted by the program.According to the normal process, shouldn\u2019t it be the winner versus the loser? It meant the workload on him increased in an instant.QU and IBB were both veteran teams of the secondary league. When fighting seriously, the strength of the two teams might not meet professional standards but they couldn\u2019t be treated as third-rate teams like the previous opponents.Lin Yan never liked to fight unprepared battles. He wanted to work out a complete lineup system targeting QU before the next recording. Therefore, he compiled all of QU\u2019s previous game videos. He asked Jing Yuanzhou for help but couldn\u2019t help frowning when he saw that his person was almost always on WeChat.Jing Yuanzhou saw this frown and smiled. He showed Lin Yan the content of the screen and spoke in an innocent tone. \u201cDo you think I want to talk to them? The problem is that your personal charm is too great. These people have nowhere else to ask and can only find me.\u201dLin Yan looked up and caught a glimpse of the other person\u2019s name: PILL\u2019s manager.He couldn\u2019t help his lips twitching. \u201cPILL lost to BK at the start of the mid-season and still have time to pay attention to our team? Even if they are free, don\u2019t pull you to chat. Shouldn\u2019t you charge to chat with Titans? Let him die!\u201dJing Yuanzhou nodded. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe started typing: [My leader said to let you die.]PILL\u2019s manager: [\u2026\u2026.]Jing Yuanzhou solved the conversation with everyone else in the same way and directly turned off his phone.Then he handed the tablet to Lin Yan. \u201cI have watched all the matches from last year\u2019s secondary league and listed the useful video content here. You can see if there is anything worth playing for reference.\u201dLin Yan saw that Jing Yuanzhou wasn\u2019t just chatting on WeChat and not working. His expression became slightly awkward as he took the tablet and put it aside. \u201cYes, I\u2019ll take a look later.\u201dHe rubbed his sore shoulders, glanced at the time and couldn\u2019t help cursing. \u201cFuck, I didn\u2019t pay attention and it is already this late!\u201dThere was the problem of sorting out the video materials and unknowingly, time passed quickly. Due to this, he often stayed up all night without realizing it.Lin Yan had been staring at the computer screen all night. He placed two drops of eyedrops into his dry eyes and gently rubbed his fingers together. \u201cThank you for your hard work. Go back and rest. Tomorrow afternoon is the program\u2019s daily live broadcast. Don\u2019t lose your energy when the time comes.\u201dJing Yuanzhou sat by the bedside and didn\u2019t move. \u201cI\u2019m not sleepy yet. I said I will finish it with you today so I\u2019m not in a hurry to sleep.\u201dLin Yan blinked. \u201cAre you sure you want to stay with me? Captain Jing, I\u2019m afraid I will be up all night!\u201d\u201cThen I will stay up with you all night.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou saw Lin Yan\u2019s sleepy expression and his eyes moved slightly. He stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll make you a cup of coffee.\u201dOne of most amazing things about the GH team was that despite using the same coffee beans, the coffee made by Jing Yuanzhou always had an indescribable charm. Lin Yan was greedy after drinking it a few times. The moment he heard there was coffee to drink, he didn\u2019t continue to struggle over the problem of staying up all night. \u201cGo go.\u201dOnce Jing Yuanzhou got back from making coffee, he saw that Lin Yan was sitting in front of the computer and watching the game videos again. The soft light shrouded his body in a layer of light and the night lights outside the window were also hazy. Such a scene entered Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes and caused him to pause a bit as he entered the room.His gaze fell on the table. Jing Yuanzhou walked over to place the coffee cup in Lin Yan\u2019s hand. Then he gently covered this person\u2019s eyes with his palm. \u201cHave a proper rest during coffee time.\u201dLin Yan saw darkness in front of him and only recovered after hearing the words. He reached out to push away the big hand in front of him and couldn\u2019t help laughing and swearing. \u201cYou\u2019re too controlling.\u201dHe said this but after taking the coffee cup with one hand, the other hand moved the mouse and pressed the pause button on the video.A shallow smile flashed on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s face as he raised the coffee cup to his mouth. His gaze shifted slightly and fell on the man in the pink tutu piggy bank that was next to the laptop.The faint smell of coffee gradually enveloped every corner of the room. The steam rose and the entire atmosphere seemed to have an inexplicable hazy feeling. Neither of them talked for a while and the space suddenly quieted down. On the other hand, it made their breathing seem strangely ambiguous. The coffee moistened their throats with a different type of warmth.Lin Yan wanted to find a topic but when he looked up, he found that Jing Yuanzhou was staring in his direction. He couldn\u2019t help being slightly stunned. It was only after he recovered that he discovered this gaze seemed to fall behind him. Lin Yan instinctively turned back and saw the piggy bank on the table. He blinked before his mouth slowly curved up. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Do you miss your service fee?\u201dJing Yuanzhou gazed at Lin Yan and also smiled slightly. \u201cI was just thinking when you are going to use me.\u201dThe dim light, the aroma of coffee, the light gaze. Everything blended together so that Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help his heart jumping.A thought flashed through his mind without warning. An unexplained reason made him blurt out, \u201cOr how about now?\u201dUm\u2026 I have to take a one week break for CAMP because I\u2019m busy with some family events this week. I have enough of a stockpile for all the novels I\u2019m translating except for CAMP, so it will just be this novel affected. Sorry for the cliffhanger?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 58": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJing Yuanzhou looked down at Lin Yan. \u201cOkay, how do you want to use it?\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t speak for a while as his gaze stayed on Jing Yuanzhou. First, it landed on the high bridge of the nose and then fell bit by bit. It moved across the distinct contours of the face to the sexy Adam\u2019s apple, slowly falling over the collarbones and then down to the tall and slender figure covered by clothes.He quietly moved to the side and his attention finally fell on the hand exposed by the cuffs. The ten fingers were slender with distinct joints. There was a unique sensibility. It was those two hands that operated the heroes on the field, creating a peak that no one else could reach.Lin Yan\u2019s eyes flickered slightly and his Adam\u2019s apple moved as a faint feeling swept over his heart.Jing Yuanzhou noticed Lin Yan\u2019s gaze and smiled softly. \u201cAre you looking at my hands?\u201dLin Yan glanced at him. \u201cCan they be used?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou held back his smile and asked again, \u201cHow do you plan to use it?\u201dSuch words inevitably sounded a bit ambiguous. Lin Yan coughed and wondered, \u201cHow can I use it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou gently rubbed the coffee cup with his fingers. \u201cIt mainly depends on how Coach Lin wants to use it.\u201dLin Yan stared at Jing Yuanzhou and gave a low chuckle after a long time. \u201cYou are really so cooperative? If I say that I want you to help me solve it\u2026 Titans\u2019 hands are so precious. Are you really willing to condescend to accept it?\u201dIt was such an ambiguous atmosphere and Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help wanting to tease Lin Yan. He didn\u2019t expect that instead of teasing this person, he would be stunned by such a question. Help solve\u2026The sentence had too many meanings. So could he understand it as this man not minding physical contact with the same sex?Originally, Lin Yan just blurted out these words because of the atmosphere. Then he saw Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s stunned manner and realized how his words could be interpreted. He felt his ears burning as he rubbed his hair. Then he took out one jiao from the piggy bank. He threw it to Jing Yuanzhou and without waiting for a response, he turned over on the bed and buried his face deeply into the pillow.His muffled voice was heard. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m sore from sitting all night. My neck, shoulders, back and waist are all areas that need to be solved urgently. You have received the service fee so do it quickly.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked down and saw the slender figure motionless on the bed. Lin Yan was completely buried in the pillow and his expression couldn\u2019t be seen at all. Perhaps it was the light but there seemed to be a strange reddish color at the base of his ears.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes shook slightly. \u201cOkay, boss.\u201dLin Yan lay on the bed for a while before he felt the man\u2019s hands pinching his neck. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s fingers were faintly cold but the moment they touched the skin, it seemed like a fire was burning.Inch by inch, blood flowed throughout his body.The massage posture was restrained yet ambiguous.No one spoke for a while. In the silent environment, every action seemed to be infinitely expanded into a slow-motion replay. Lin Yan could feel the exhaustion in his body dissipating while at the same time, there was another strange feeling.Jing Yuanzhou massaged very seriously while his gaze stayed on the person in front of him. He kneaded carefully on a specific place with force. Then he asked in a low voice, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201dToo delicate and too gentle. If he didn\u2019t know this person, the dazed Lin Yan would think he had wandered into a massage place and ordered the top worker. He clearly did nothing but it was provocative to the extreme.He originally wanted to take this opportunity to relax but before he knew it, his body tensed even more under the massage. Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help cursing in his heart as he regretted his choice. Sure enough, he lost his head over lust!Why on earth did he provoke a man like Jing Yuanzhou? It was fine now. The man was very serious about the service but as the boss enjoying the service, he felt that it was a bit unbearable. It was really unbearable.Lin Yan\u2019s entire face was buried in the pillow and the hands that had fallen to his side couldn\u2019t help gripping the sheets under him. A wave of heat he never experienced before surged and a thin layer of sweat appeared on his forehead.It wasn\u2019t that Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s technique wasn\u2019t good enough. It was that it was too good. It was so good\u2026 he had an unwanted reaction!The touch behind him shifted from the neck to the shoulders and then inched along his back. Just as it reached the sensitive part of his back, Jing Yuanzhou suddenly applied a bit of strength without warning.Lin Yan was already overwhelmed by the heat gradually rising in his body and couldn\u2019t help letting out a low groan. Such a sound was made in this silence and Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s massage stopped slightly.There was a strange silence around them.Lin Yan didn\u2019t wait for Jing Yuanzhou to say anything and pushed away the hands on his body. He rolled over, got out of bed and rushed straight to the bathroom without looking back. Before the door was closed, a low and hoarse voice was heard. \u201cI will take a shower first and we will continue to work after.\u201dA few moments later, the sound of water could be heard. In the entire process, Jing Yuanzhou never moved from his position by the bed. His gaze settled on the closed door for a while before he buried his face in his hands and chuckled.At this time, his fingertips still seemed to contain residual heat.If Lin Yan had glanced back, he would\u2019ve seen that this normally indifferent and proud man had a suspicious blush that didn\u2019t fit his image occupying his entire neck. It didn\u2019t disappear for a long time.During this massage, Jing Yuanzhou was far less calm and indifferent than he seemed. It was precisely due to the fire ignited in his body that he never made a sound, for fear that he would accidentally set a prairie fire and go completely out of control.Now the sound of water in the water gradually splashed on his heart.The smile on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s face became more and more uncontrolled. Lin Yan might\u2019ve been silent just now but from Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s perspective, how could he not detect the subtle changes in the other person\u2019s body?So they were the same in terms of sexual orientation. What other discovery could make him happier than his?The next day, Titans started the live broadcast again.Fans didn\u2019t know what a good day it was and waited in the live broadcast room early after receiving the advance notice. At 3 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Jing Yuanzhou logged into the platform exactly on time. He was sorting out the equipment while the barrage scrolled.[Ahhh, Titans finally came. I was dying waiting!][What will the content be today? Is it the glory tournament?][The glory tournament is good. Is it singles or doubles? Call Coach Lin to join you!][I\u2019m kneeling down and begging Coach Lin to show his face.][Wow, is there a doubles game, doubles game?]Almost every two or three sentences mentioned Lin Yan. Jing Yuanzhou saw the contents of the barrage and couldn\u2019t help smiling. He turned his head and looked at someone who was napping on the sofa. \u201cCoach Lin, the fans say they want to see you.\u2019Lin Yan yawned before lazily lifting his eyelids and wondering, \u201cIsn\u2019t it your live broadcast? Why do they want to see me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou turned sideways. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me then look for yourself. I\u2019m not lying to you.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t bother to open the live broadcast room. He went straight to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s computer and glanced at it. Such a face appeared in the camera of the live broadcast room. The two people were in the same frame and there was a burst of screams.Jing Yuanzhou gently pushed against the floor so the gaming chair moved back a bit, giving Lin Yan some space.Lin Yan glanced at the contents of the barrage and laughed. \u201cI won\u2019t play the doubles game today. I am tired from last night and need to rest.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t easy to catch such an interactive opportunity and the barrage scrolled frantically.[You really aren\u2019t going to play doubles? Would you like to think about it again?][I want to see the coach play a jungler, I want to see the coach take Titans to score points.][Wow, did something happen last night?][A big night. So exciting?][Just now my mother asked me why my color suddenly changed.][Who did you toss with and to what extent? Ahhh a letter written in blood showing my determination to get the details!][A letter written in blood showing my determination to get the details +2][A letter written in blood showing my determination to get the details +3]\u2026\u2026[A letter written in blood showing my determination to get the details + ID number.]Lin Yan saw the barrage like this and could only continue to answer. \u201cWho did I toss with? Do you still need to ask? It was naturally Titans.\u201dThe barrage screen was completely covered with \u2018ahhhhhhhhhhh.\u2019[Is the GH team so open? The coach and the captain took the lead to stay up so late?][Just say that the relationship between the two of you isn\u2019t ordinary! Isn\u2019t this a direct confession?][Talk a bit more, talk a bit more, talk about life\u2019s ideals if possible.][What is all this stuff inside GH?][The previous sunspot, get lost!][Stop tossing and play a doubles game please.][What did you do? We just want to know what you did?][A big night! Is it so exciting?!!!]\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Lin Yan admired the association ability of these netizens. \u201cWhat do you think? We naturally engaged in videos.\u201d[!!! There is still a video? You are so good at playing?!][Ahhhhh it\u2019s okay to make a video together!][Don\u2019t speak secret words. I want to see.][Fuck, the parents love out of print treasure CD? There is an inside taste!][Your relationship is like this. You really won\u2019t consider being teammates?]Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe had only slept in the early hours of the morning and was very sleepy. Therefore, he completely didn\u2019t want to talk right now. He was silent and stared blankly at Jing Yuanzhou.Jing Yuanzhou was controlling the curve of his mouth. After being stared at like this, he couldn\u2019t help laughing. Still, he came out and helped clarify it. \u201cOkay, Coach Lin is talking about watching the game replay videos.\u201dThere was only one piece of content left on the barrage: [Oh\u2026]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 59": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 45.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe final result of Lin Yan\u2019s round-the-clock replays was that the GH team ushered in another wave of devil training. They normally trained but under Lin Yan\u2019s command, there was a complete training plan compared to temporary and whimsical training. It was two completely different extreme experiences.The reason why the members of the GH team, including Bi Yaohua, loved and feared their coach was that he always used training techniques that could drive them crazy to make them forever remember the training content experienced.In Lin Yan\u2019s words, it was muscle memory. A professional was likely to experience all types of unexpected situations on the field. Under these circumstances, the only thing that could be trusted most was the existence of muscle memory.Coach Lin\u2019s confident expression when talking made it seem like he was talking about his own personal experience and it was irrefutable.They lived like this for several days. By the time everyone came out of the training room in a muddle-headed manner, the second elimination round of Burning Hot Assembly was finally ushered in.In this episode, they would face the top team QU in the secondary league. If they won, they would go to the finals to compete for the championship. If they failed, they would leave miserably. It was either life or death.Before the program was recorded, Lin Yan gave the final speech for everyone in the lounge. \u201cYou all must remember that winning the final championship is our goal. Before we get the qualification to enter the professional league, we don\u2019t have the right to say we worked hard. In this field, all unrequited efforts have no value. You must understand that only results can prove everything! E-sports is so cruel!\u201d\u201cOur team is just getting started. Since the strength of the previous teams we faced wasn\u2019t high, netizens still find us controversial. There might be some problems with the arrangement of the program but it isn\u2019t bad for us to face a team with a certain strength like QU. In the last five secondary leagues, the QU team has been qualified to participate in the finals three times. Due to their continuous \u2018escort\u2019 of many teams who have stood on the field of the professional league, they were once nicknamed the surveyor of those qualified to be professional teams. Now we are going to fight for our future against such a surveyor team.\u201dHaving said this, he looked around the lounge. \u201cAs long as we can defeat QU in a fair manner today, it will prove to the entire e-sports circle that the GH team itself has the strength and qualification to stand in the professional league. Now I want you to formally issue a warning to the professional league and tell everyone that we, GH, are really here!\u201dThe members of GH listened to this and their blood was boiling. \u201cDefeat QU, fuck them!\u201dJing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help looking up at Lin Yan while hiding the faint smile in his eyes. If this person retired from e-sports, he would probably show an amazing effect if he went to do MLM sales.FreestarLin Yan finished mobilizing this side and turned to the cameraman brother next to him. \u201cDid you record everything just now?\u201dHaving been with the GH team for so long, the cameraman brother was used to Lin Yan\u2019s rapid expression change. He calmly responded, \u201cIt\u2019s all recorded.\u201dLin Yan looked over at the replay of the moment just now and reminded, \u201cThe last sentence of \u2018fuck them\u2019 should be cut out later. The impact isn\u2019t very good. We\u2019ll record another one now.\u201dThe cameraman brother, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe would like to say that this sentence better reflected GH\u2019s current public image but he met Lin Yan\u2019s gaze and couldn\u2019t help drawing up the corner of his mouth. \u201cOkay.\u201dThe GH team quickly set up their positions under Lin Yan\u2019s command. They might be reluctant but they could only do business in a serious manner. They faced the camera and reappeared with serious and firm expressions on their faces. \u201cWe will definitely win!\u201dOf course, some of them were too distracted.Jing Yuanzhou gave a rare laugh.Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help staring at him. He went close to the cameraman brother to watch the re-shoot and barely agreed with it. \u201cOkay, that\u2019s it. Don\u2019t include Titan\u2019s scene and everything else is good.\u201dThe shooting task ended here and he finally remembered one thing. \u201cBy the way, I didn\u2019t say it before in fear of affecting your emotions. Starting today, the show has officially been changed to a live broadcast. If you don\u2019t play well then you will get the treatment of being scolded simultaneously. Are you excited? Do you feel any excitement and stimulation?\u201dProbably taking into account the factors of the mid-season, the program\u2019s staff decided to adjust the broadcast time. They directly adopted the same live broadcast format as the official competition.The people in the GH team previously didn\u2019t know the news. They had indeed found the recording time strange. Now that they knew the reason, they froze for a while.Bi Yaohua turned and looked at the stylist behind him. \u201cBrother, do you think I need to adjust my hairstyle again?\u201dThe stylist murmured, \u201c\u2026It is very handsome.\u201d\u201cMaybe it can be a bit more handsome?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026This is handsome enough.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t mind being more handsome.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThe stylist couldn\u2019t bear it and grabbed a handful of hair gel, applying it to the colorful hair. Everyone else laughed.Gu Luo actually had a question but didn\u2019t dare to ask. Jian Ye was more straightforward and wondered, \u201cCoach, aren\u2019t you afraid of affecting our mood if you tell us about the live broadcast now?\u201dLin Yan glanced at him disapprovingly. \u201cIf it is so easy to get affected by emotions then what do I want from you?\u201dJian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt might sound cold and heartless but it was so reasonable that people couldn\u2019t refute it? Just then, the door of the lounge opened and a staff member looked in to remind them to be prepared to play. Lin Yan clapped his hands. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dSince this was an elimination round, the three games had been replaced by BO5.Three games had been increased to five games. It not only had higher requirements for the players\u2019 physical fitness but it also added more uncertain factors. This was the ultimate test of mentality.The barrage of the live broadcast had long been filling the screen.[Come on, place a bet. Guess who can win this game.][GH also got all the way here. Are the competitors they met before really that weak?][Please give QU a chance to qualify for the professional league. QU\u2019s old fans are in tears.][Meeting QU, the going home team is finally going home today, right?][QU has been unable to enter the professional league for so many years. There is a reason why. Weak is weak. I predict that GH will win.][In the last episode, GH won against IBB. Why can\u2019t they win against QU?][I\u2019m laughing to death. The last episode was just an entertainment game! Do GH fans really think their team is very strong?][Wake up, IBB lost because they didn\u2019t send their shooter. The core of the team itself is the shooter system, okay!][Don\u2019t make noise, don\u2019t make noise, it is time to start!]The match officially started. Lin Yan took his folder and stood behind the player seats to guide the team through the BP process. He couldn\u2019t help showing a faint smile when he saw the first hero QU banned.It wasn\u2019t in vain that he spent a few days studying all the game data of the GH team. Obviously, he had completely guessed the BP lineup designed by QU\u2019s coaching staff. Unlike the players fighting on the field, the game of the professional coaches was in the lineup changes.[Wow, Coach Lin is smiling. I don\u2019t think it is easy.][GH, let\u2019s rest the bragging here. Coach Lin, Coach Lin all the time. If your coach is so awesome then why doesn\u2019t he go to Heaven?][I see you are all QU\u2019s brainless fans. I can\u2019t wait for you to be hit in the face!][I just want to ask. Is the going home team going home today?][Oh, the go home team will send QU home today!]QU\u2019s fans were concerned about their team\u2019s quota and confronted the supporters of the GH team on the barrage, not giving way. The thing they didn\u2019t know was that the coach of their team had long been bitterly twisted up into a ball. The saddest thing was that the opponent guessed their tactical arrangements in advance.At the end of the BP session, coaches from both sides arrived in the center and shook hands. QU\u2019s coach looked at Lin Yan in a complicated manner but he could only helplessly say, \u201cThis system is very familiar\u2026\u201dLin Yan smiled calmly. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201dThis attitude was humble enough and so modest that it made the coach of QU more upset. After shaking hands and controlling the impulse to cover his chest, the coach of QU hurried back to his seat and had to make subsequent tactical adjustments temporarily.Due to his tactical arrangements being restrained, the players on the field became passive. This was the biggest negligence of the coaching staff.Lin Yan also returned to his position. In contrast to the completely pressured coach of QU, Lin Yan leaned back lazily in his chair, slender legs crossed casually in front of him as he started to pay attention to the game on the field.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 45.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first game officially started. Since QU\u2019s core player was their mid-laner, Lin Yan specifically reminded Jian Ye to pay special attention to Gu Luo\u2019s development in the middle. Lin Yan had successfully destroyed QU\u2019s ideal lineup in the BP session. As the coach, he had done his duty. The rest was up to the players.Judging from the current lineup on the field, the support of the QU team was undoubtedly very passive. This made QU lack a better means of protection when invading the jungle. In response to this, Jing Yuanzhou greeted Chen Yushen in advance. The two of them waited and received the first drop of blood from QU\u2019s jungler within one minute of the start.Jian Ye\u2019s healing support wasn\u2019t suitable for starting a group battle but his protection was particularly strong. In the early stages, he went to the middle lane. No matter how hard QU\u2019s mid-laner tried, even with the assistance of the jungler, he still failed to get any benefits.Since the opponent didn\u2019t have the advantage, Gu Luo\u2019s fighting style meant it was up to him to occupy the advantage. He madly and ferociously pushed down the lane. There was a suspicion that he was relying on Jian Ye but he did quickly widen the economic gap between both sides in the middle. The core of the QU team, the mid-laner was a bit miserable for a while.However, Lin Yan was quite satisfied. This was the effect he wanted.Don\u2019t pay attention to Gu Luo\u2019s usual obedient appearance. He played more fiercely than anyone else when he was on the field. The usual control heroes couldn\u2019t keep up with his rhythm but Jian Ye\u2019s type of healing support seemed tailor-made for him.Brother Gun\u2019s milk had always been plentiful and delicious. The most important thing was that it always appeared at the most critical time, making people unable to stop. There was Jian Ye protecting him and Gu Luo naturally had no more scruples. Seeing that QU\u2019s mid-laner was alone under the defensive tower, he didn\u2019t hesitate to start the mode of attacking the tower the moment his big skill was upgraded.This wave of attacks came so quickly that QU\u2019s mid-laner didn\u2019t have time to react. The moment he looked up, he could only see the dark computer screen.On the screen, Gu Luo took the head and never looked at the corpse lying on the ground. He walked away without any attachment. This back figure was simply arrogant.The damage from the defense tower hit Gu Luo again and again. Jian Ye\u2019s reaction was quick and he took two steps forward decisively. He took the last damage from the tower for his mid-laner and a green light flashed on his weapon at the same time. This instantly lifted Gu Luo\u2019s small amount of health back to a healthy state.Anyone who had seen GH\u2019s live broadcast knew that the team\u2019s mid-laner and support liked to play doubles together. At this time, their tacit understanding was shown. This set of cooperation was so successful that the entire barrage was instantly covered with a string of \u2018666.\u2019Meanwhile, QU\u2019s jungler wanted to make trouble on the road. Yet instead of getting any benefits from Jing Yuanzhou, he was instead pressured back and lost some health. There was nothing to do but hatefully withdraw.Jing Yuanzhou continued to clear the line of soldiers while also going to the opponent\u2019s jungle to collect two mobs. He glanced in the direction where two figures had disappeared and signaled to the middle road, warning them. \u201cThey have gone down the side lane and the jungle.\u201dAt the same time, Chen Yushen also gave a signal. \u201cWait for me.\u201dGu Luo understood. He pretended to be inattentive and kept clearing the line of soldiers without slowing down. On the other side, Jian Ye found the best healing distance in advance. Five seconds later, two figures rushed out of the grass by the river and went straight to Gu Luo.First, a displacement narrowed the distance and then a strong control held Gu Luo in place. Finally, there was a set of combos. Anyone seeing it would think Gu Luo would be killed instantly. The moment that Gu Luo\u2019s health was going to empty, a green light flashed around his body. The health bar that had bottomed out was pulled back by more than half a bar in an instant.It was the big move that Jian Ye had been holding in his hands. He had been waiting for such a critical moment. After the control effect ended, Gu Luo used flash and decisively pulled away. At almost the same moment, the waiting Chen Yushen leaped out like a wolf staring at his prey.QU\u2019s side lane player and jungler tried to withdraw but it was completely too late. Chen Yushen\u2019s jungler rhythm could be called very good. The time he entered the field happened to be when the opponents\u2019 skills were on cooldown. There was almost no resistance and he successfully accepted a wave of double kills.As the bait who escaped from death, Gu Luo retreated under the tower and started to return to the city. He didn\u2019t forget to praise his teammates in the voice channel. \u201c666 Abyss! Brother Gun, awesome! I probably would\u2019ve kneeled down without your milk!\u201dChen Yushen replied in a low voice and returned to the jungle.Jian Ye chuckled when he heard the words. \u201cYes, I will be there whenever you need it. Brother Gun is your mobile blood bank.\u201dThe listening Bi Yaohua couldn\u2019t help wailing, \u201cFuck, move your mobile blood bank and look at me too! Come on, what are they doing here? They can\u2019t stay in the middle lane so they want to go to the bot lane and collapse along with it. QU\u2019s team culture is okay. It is too tragic to die together!\u201dAs the team\u2019s strong backing and the top tool man, Jian Ye ran down the road without hesitation. \u201cBrother Trash Talk, just wait. I will give you a mouthful straight away. You will have enough milk!\u201dIn this game, GH\u2019s rhythm could be called very good. After grasping the advantage at the beginning, it snowballed and the gap continued to widen. The QU team quickly discovered that their movement route seemed to have been grasped by the other side. Their rhythm was a mess and they could no longer control it. In addition, their lineup itself was restrained in this round. GH managed to push to the high ground in 35 minutes.The crystal at the QU team\u2019s base was shattered and the word \u2018victory\u2019 appeared on the computer screens of the GH players.[Victory!]The first game of the BO5 was won! Moreover, it could be called quite a beautiful victory. From the alignment to the rhythm, it was almost perfect and impeccable. The barrage was instantly lively. The MVP of this game was finally given to Gloy\u2019s outstanding performance. He had 6 kills, 0 deaths and 8 assists. He was only one step away from a super god.In addition, the focus of the audience was on another person, the GH team\u2019s support Gun. It had to be admitted that GH\u2019s Gloy was really elegant and fierce but anyone who paid attention to the game would find that without Gun, the top healer escorting him, Gloy wouldn\u2019t have been able to penetrate into the enemy line like this.The director promptly called up the healing data on the spot. Once they saw the overwhelming total amount of healing, the audience couldn\u2019t help letting out exclamations.In the current professional league, healing heroes were almost always on the bench. The long casting time made them a bit too useless compared to the various control skills of other support heroes.Now this game caused a wave of heated discussions. The healing support could still be played like this? After seeing this, who would dare claim that they were useless? Since the previous teams that GH faced were too weak, the support position was easily overlooked and lacked attention. It wasn\u2019t until this game\u2026Lin Yan greeted the players who returned to the players\u2019 bench and gently patted Jian Ye\u2019s shoulder. \u201cCongratulations Gun Zai. This can be regarded as you becoming famous! If you really create a new era of healing supports with your own power then today will be regarded as the official starting point of the Milk God!\u201dJian Ye also knew that the tactic in the first game was based on trust in his healing capacity so it wasn\u2019t surprising that his healing total value would be so high. Now he heard Lin Yan\u2019s words and the fierce scar on his face twitched slightly. \u201cI don\u2019t have any opinion about being on the road to a god but Coach, can you change the name of Milk God? Do you think this name is suitable for me?\u201dLin Yan looked up and saw the angular face. He was silent for a moment before replying sincerely, \u201cI think it is very suitable! Believe in yourself, you can add milk, you are the Milk God!\u201dJian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMilk God?!QU lost a game in the beginning. This made the QU fans who had been extremely active on the barrage shut up slightly. In sharp contrast, the supporters of the GH team were celebrating.After all, it was a new team. Compared to old teams, the number of fans for the GH team still wasn\u2019t enough. In addition, most of them were CP fans and face fans. Apart from Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s own fans who had a stronger fighting power, the others were relatively Buddhist. This led to an extremely different strength when competing with QU fans.Still, no matter how Buddhist these GH fans, the barrage was still their battlefield. Naturally, no one wanted to lose the battle! GH\u2019s victory in the first game made the female fans focused on CP and appearance start to appear.[Yo yo yo, didn\u2019t QU fans clamor a lot just now? Come on, come on, try jumping out again?][Kneeling so miserably in the first game. I want to ask if your face hurts?][GH used to play against weak teams? Oh, I think your QU is the weakest.][It is a crushing. So miserable. With our Brother Gun, it is impossible to get a head!][Fuck, GH fans shouldn\u2019t be too arrogant. Isn\u2019t it just one game? Can you live for a year just by winning one game?][Let\u2019s rest, it\u2019s cold. It is time to send QU home. Our coach Lin said that the opponent\u2019s air tickets are all inclusive. Do you want to hurry and book it?]Don\u2019t say it. No matter the situation later, at least in this moment, they relieved a lot of their anger!In such a tense atmosphere, the second game officially started. As always, the BP process was a game between the coaches of the two teams. Lin Yan saw that QU had banned the shaman elf used by Jian Ye in the last game and raised his eyebrow.The entire audience was also in a frenzy. Before this, who would\u2019ve thought that in this version of the game, they could still see a healing hero being banned? From this point of view, GH was simply leading a new trend in the game!The ban section ended and it was time to start choosing heroes. Lin Yan asked the players to take cocoa immortal, who was also a healing hero. Then he took a look at QU\u2019s bench. Not surprisingly, it could be seen that all the players in the QU zone looked like they were eating shit. He couldn\u2019t help laughing.Jing Yuanzhou noticed Lin Yan\u2019s actions at this time and leaned closer. \u201cYou are laughing. Aren\u2019t you afraid that the QU coaching team will fight against you desperately?\u201dLin Yan was calm. \u201cThere are so many machines arranged here. I really respect him if he dares to start a PK with real people.\u201dThe lineup was all set in the blink of an eye. Before leaving, Lin Yan didn\u2019t forget to say one more sentence. \u201cTitans, this game depends on you.\u201dJing Yuanzhou said, \u201cGive it to me.\u201dThis time during the handshake session, QU\u2019s coach obviously had nothing to say and just shook hands. Since their lineup selection was clearly targeted in the first game, they temporarily adjusted a set of new tactics for this game.The system they were using was originally prepared to face the IBB in the final spring for the professional league quota. They never expected that they would be forced to use it when facing GH. It was obviously not a wise choice to expose new tactics in advance but QU also knew that if they stopped here today, everything later would be meaningless.Lin Yan naturally also noticed the changes in the opposite lineup. He sat in the players area and cast his gaze to the center of the field. He watched the indifferent man in the center of the field with a slight smile on his face.A new tactic was really easy to catch the opponent off guard. It was just a pity that in order to prevent such a situation from happening, he had placed the tactical core in this game on Jing Yuanzhou.There was one thing Lin Yan always believed. As long as this man was standing on the field, the brand new team of GH would be invincible!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe second game opened in a regular manner. After a wave of testing in their respective areas, the two sides didn\u2019t break out in attacking. Instead, they went back and developed steadily.Jing Yuanzhou pushed a bit hard in the lane, basically squeezing the opposite player directly under the tower without giving him room to breathe. If this style was placed on other players then it would probably be too aggressive. It was because Titans was on the field that everyone calmly thought it was a routine operation. Everyone knew that once Titans was on the road, it was basically hopeless to double team up. The success or failure of a three against one siege needed to be seen.At the same time, QU\u2019s mid-laner had suffered a big loss in the last game. This time, he saw Jian Ye\u2019s healer in his field of view and instantly lost any aggressive thoughts. The conservativeness of QU\u2019s mid-laner caused dissatisfaction in the barrage.The audience in the live broadcast room could see from a god\u2019s perspective that Jian Ye didn\u2019t stay in the middle after helping Gu Luo collect a wave of soldiers. Instead, he made a fake move and started walking directly to the upper half of the map.He met with Jing Yuanzhou and the two of them started to invade the jungle area. Such a prediction was terrifyingly accurate. After a while, QU\u2019s jungler appeared on the screen with the support.A series of ellipses started to appear on the barrage. The watching crowd was silent for a moment. They all wanted to sing a song \u2018Have a good journey.\u2019Moments later, an incident broke out in the jungle. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s actions had always been simple and neat without giving the opponent the slightest chance to react. Thanks to Jian Ye\u2019s assistance, he received a double kill.From then on, it meant GH had directly declared the absolute right to occupy the upper half of the map. QU had no choice but to avoid the steel plate that was Jing Yuanzhou. Fortunately, their tactical deployment in this game wasn\u2019t aimed at the top lane. After regaining their heart, they started to make trouble in the bottom lane.Lin Yan was sitting in the players\u2019 seats and had seen clues to QU\u2019s system. He slightly frowned. Originally, if QU had won today then there was a high probability they would face their old rival IBB in the finals. Therefore, QU specifically tailored a specific set of tactics in response to IBB, a team with the shooter as the core.Judging from the current lineup on the field, QU\u2019s mid-laner and jungler had a very explosive mid-field linkage. It might not be enough facing Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s half-tanker hero but it was more than enough for dealing with the low defense shooter.While QU\u2019s upper half of the map had almost completely fallen, the bottom half of the map started to blossom due to a steady wave of ganks.Chen Yushen might\u2019ve fortified the bottom lane ahead of time but the cooperation of QU\u2019s mid-field was too fierce. In the end, he couldn\u2019t save the besieged Bi Yaohua from the super high burst of damage but almost handed over a double kill.Fortunately, Chen Yushen had always been calm on the field and retreated decisively. Otherwise, it would\u2019ve been a buy one, get one free. Bi Yaohua was killed three times in a row. He saw that this couldn\u2019t continue and started to call out, \u201cSupport daddy, look at me! I\u2019m going to really blow up if you don\u2019t come!\u201dJing Yuanzhou agreed. \u201cGun, go protect the bottom lane.\u201dJian Ye replied, \u201cI\u2019m going!\u201dThe QU team was still eager to do things but Brother Gun\u2019s milk supply was too sufficient. After a few tests, they weren\u2019t able to take advantage. They could only choose to temporarily withdraw. Thanks to Jian Ye acting as a big escort, the scene of the bottom lane finally stabilized. It was a pity that due to the previous harassment, Bi Yaohua\u2019s economy was affected too much and his equipment was miserable.There was no way. Bi Yaohua could only work hard at this time to collect equipment but he was determined not to let go of Brother Gun\u2019s thigh. \u201cGun Gun, you must not go too far away from me. Sure enough, I feel more secure when you are here! You don\u2019t know, the beasts on the other side are really special. They aren\u2019t human! It is like they have never seen a human head before. It is crazy! It doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m bullied but I am your shooter. Bully me means slapping you in the face. You can\u2019t bear it, right!\u201dJian Ye lifted Bi Yaohua\u2019s health while calmly comforting him. \u201cOkay, once people come then hide behind me. I\u2019ll block you in front and ensure they can\u2019t move against you.\u201dBi Yaohua praised him. \u201cThe manliest Gun Gun!\u201dQU had spent a long time training in this strategy of sniping the shooter. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t expect there to be such a professional support this year. Since then, all their routines were messy and they felt extremely depressed.Fortunately, the early harassment strategy was fairly thorough. Bi Yaohua\u2019s output was in a semi-disabled state in the short-term, giving them a lot of room to play.The QU team\u2019s first reaction was to look for Gu Luo, the mid-laner. However, GH\u2019s mid-laner took an unusual path. Apart from occasionally clearing the soldiers, he basically wandered around the jungle area. He ran more diligently in the jungle than the jungler.In this way, it was obviously more difficult to block him. No traces of him could be found so QU could only focus on Jing Yuanzhou who was on the road again. They were filled with killing intent. Looking at the fog of the GH team\u2019s map, it could be found that all the members of QU were gone.Jing Yuanzhou just glanced at it and understood immediately. \u201cBB, develop quickly. I will try to drag out this place a bit longer. Abyss and Gloy, come and wait here.\u201dThen he placed a simple signal on a grassy area of the map. The QU team didn\u2019t know their whereabouts had been seen through. They saw that Jing Yuanzhou was still present and pushing the lane. This was a chance so they came forward.However, before they could get close, two more figures appeared in the grass behind them. It was the GH duo who had disappeared for a long time.The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind it. The wave of gank that QU thought was the winner finally turned into an anti-gank. However, it was clear that it was too late for QU to pull back. They could only bite the bullet and try to carry out a wave of kills.Jing Yuanzhou was set in place and received a wave of damage. It was followed up by the next few skills and he saw his health bar was about to be emptied. He used a flash to the extreme limit to avoid it and then used a series of skills to deal explosive damage.Thanks to the cooperation of Chen Yushen and Gu Luo, the harvest was completed.[Quadra kill!][Legendary (Super God)!]The QU team had only one person left who hurriedly fled. A three against five battle produced a wave of destruction. The entire venue was overturned by loud shouts.The director immediately did a close-up. On the screen, they could see Titans pushing to the tower with only 43 drops of health left. Just looking at the nearly empty health bar was enough to show how fierce the previous situation was.However, this was the absolute control that belonged to top players! It was precisely because there was Jing Yuanzhou to control the damage to the maximum extent that induced the QU team to act against him. Finally, this allowed QU to receive the full set of damage from the GH duo.At almost the same time, Bi Yaohua and Jian Ye on the bottom lane had already pushed all the way to the high ground. In this game, the QU team played well enough. It was a pity that Jing Yuanzhou stabilized the top lane with absolute strength, thus stabilizing the entire situation.This was the absolute strength of an ace player! It was precisely because Jing Yuanzhou created more room for his teammates to act that it balanced out the entire field and filled in the breakthrough that QU had almost opened.The upper and lower roads met and Jian Ye quickly filled up Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s health. Everyone in GH followed the line of soldiers to the tower and pushed at the crystal of the QU team\u2019s base.[Victory!]Two straight wins! The game ended and the atmosphere was finally out of control. In the midst of the thunderous applause, Jing Yuanzhou walked straight to Lin Yan and looked down. \u201cWas I okay?\u201dLin Yan was smiling. \u201cWhy do I feel like you are asking for praise?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it okay to understand it like that?\u201d Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t deny it. \u201cDo I deserve some praise?\u201dLin Yan tried to endure it but the corners of his mouth still flew up. \u201cYou deserve it. You played very beautifully.\u201dThey won two consecutive games in the BO5 and directly entered the match point belonging to the GH team.Lin Yan glanced over at the QU players\u2019 seats. He could see that everyone in QU was looking solemn. They couldn\u2019t smile anymore. His eyes couldn\u2019t help shaking slightly.Perhaps for many viewers, Burning Hot Assembly was just an entertainment variety game but in fact, for all participating teams, every match was an important opportunity for them to change their future. Especially for a veteran of the secondary league like QU.Time and time again, they tried to reach the professional league only to be turned away. Some people ridiculed them as surveyors of those qualified to be professional teams but for the team itself, this name contained too much irony.Lin Yan was well aware of how precious this rare extra chance for promotion was for teams like QU and IBB. He also knew how hard the players standing on the field had put in these days. It was a pity that their GH team was bound to win the promotion place as the final champions of the season!Even if all the pursuits and sweat of QU could be understood, this was the battlefield of e-sports. There were winners and losers. Only the final glory couldn\u2019t be given! Now, losing two games in a row had obviously had a great impact on the QU team.In the BP section of the third game, the coach of QU actually banned three healing heroes in a row. This might be to make Jian Ye passive but it was too unwise.Lin Yan sighed silently. He was in a complicated mood as he locked onto a group control support and arranged for the other players to take several powerful heroes. Jian Ye was really good at the healing support but that didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t play other heroes. As a result of such a line-up, QU was destined to have nothing to do with victory.In the beginning of the game, the GH team directly grasped a huge advantage. Bi Yaohua, who was \u2018bullied\u2019 in the last game, had full firepower. After several waves of small-scale team battles, he took a few heads, made a lot of money and finally won the MVP of the third game.The score was 3:0! GH had won this BO5 knockout match with an absolutely crushing record! Lin Yan listened to the deafening cheers in his ears while his eyes fell calmly on the game statistics on the big screen.On the field, the team\u2019s players huddled together excitedly. Although they still needed to make it through the finals to officially enter the professional league, it was like Lin Yan said before the game. Today\u2019s victory was their first step to proving themselves and they did it! The GH team used absolute strength to sound the alarm for the professional teams in the league!On the stage, Bi Yaohua immediately hugged his teammates. Then he looked up at Jing Yuanzhou and heard the captain\u2019s faint hint, \u201cIt\u2019s time to shake hands.\u201dAlong with the live broadcast, the program had changed all other aspects to the league system. After the match, as the winner, the GH team went to the QU team to shake hands one by one. Having lost another chance to enter the professional league, some players on the QU team couldn\u2019t help secretly shedding tears.The two captains firmly shook hands. The QU captain concealed the loss in his eyes and said sincerely, \u201cYou are very strong. You have to come back!\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dLin Yan stood in the players\u2019 seats and watched the scene on the field from a distance. On the screen, he could see Jing Yuanzhou looking at him after turning around. Then Jing Yuanzhou walked straight over.They stood in front of each other and were silent for a while. There were still cheers but it seemed to have become distant background sounds. A moment later, Lin Yan smiled first. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s hands curled up slowly as he looked at the person in front of him. Then he naturally opened his hands. \u201cHug once to celebrate?\u201dEveryone was very excited after winning the game. Bi Yaohua, who had just been refused a hug by the captain, looked back. Jian Ye was still immersed in the joy of victory and he blurted out, \u201cI want to hug the coach too!\u201dBefore he could step forward, Gu Luo firmly held a corner of his clothes. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want to!\u201dSeeing Jian Ye look back suspiciously, Gu Luo\u2019s mouth twitched slightly but he didn\u2019t know how to explain it. Finally, he considered the safety of Brother Gun\u2019s life and sent himself up as a great sacrifice. \u201cIf you want to hug then just\u2026 hug me.\u201dLin Yan was a bit stunned by Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s suggestion. It was only when he saw the few people next to him that he reacted. He stared at JIng Yuanzhou who was still holding this posture and walked over, giving a gentle hug. \u201cThere is one more match. Keep going!\u201dThe director captured this scene and placed it on the big screen. The audience was quiet for a moment at the two embracing figures. Then the scene was completely overturned by screams.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t seem to notice the restlessness at the venue. He glanced at the image on the screen and slightly smiled as his warm breath grazed Lin Yan\u2019s ear. \u201cYes, let\u2019s work hard together.\u201dIt was obviously a very light sentence but it caused Lin Yan\u2019s ears to turn red. Accompanied by the shouts on the field, a prairie fire was started.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the end, it wasn\u2019t surprising that IBB became the second team to compete for the championship. For this reason, there was inevitably a wave of comments on the barrage as people started to speculate about the winners of the finals.[GH has already played IBB. What is there to guess? GH must be the dark horse!][Are the fans of the go home team so optimistic? Can a win in an entertainment match count as a win? IBB has the shooter system. In that game, the coach replaced the player and the shooter didn\u2019t play!][I agree with this point. IBB without a shooter has no soul.][I\u2019m laughing to death. It is like you can definitely win if you put back your team\u2019s soul.][The strength of IBB and QU are half equal. It makes sense that they can\u2019t enter the professional league every year.][I will also bet on the Go Home team. After all, it is a 3:0 crushing. If they can send QU home then they can definitely send IBB home.][GH fans shouldn\u2019t be too arrogant. Be careful when your face cracks.][Oh, a small team is a small team. It can become arrogant like this after winning a match. A dark horse? Take a break!]The supporters of both sides were arguing online but no matter what, the final elimination round had officially ended.They returned to the base on the business car. Lin Yan sat in the back row. His slender legs were crossed loosely in front of him and he was lowering his head to play with his phone.Since the program was in the form of a live broadcast, the staff also worked very hard. It was estimated that they were rushing to work backstage while the program was being broadcasted. Just after it was over, many video highlights had been released.Since GH\u2019s three games were really beautiful today, many relevant clips were updated one after another. In the blink of an eye, there were more than 20 posts on the official Weibo page of the program.Lin Yan didn\u2019t know how the eliminated QU team felt. He just knew that he was distressed for them. Still, GH couldn\u2019t be blamed for their ruthlessness. Blame the program\u2019s poor schedule that didn\u2019t leave QU a chance to enter the finals.Lin Yan thought of QU and couldn\u2019t help sighing in sympathy. He inadvertently looked down and paused slightly when he saw the official video just released. At first glance, it was obviously him and Jing Yuanzhou hugging and celebrating after the match. It was accompanied by a line of words: The very touching emotions of the team.Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was silent for a moment before opening the video. His phone was currently in silent mode and there was no external sound, but it wasn\u2019t difficult to feel the overly warm atmosphere at the scene from the silhouettes surging in the background.Lin Yan slightly raised his eyebrow. The venue was originally so lively when he hugged Jing Yuanzhou? Why hadn\u2019t he noticed it?The video wasn\u2019t long. It lasted less than a minute. After watching it, Lin Yan\u2019s fingers paused for a while before he finally clicked to bookmark it. After closing the video, he looked at the content in the comments area below.[Forget everything else, the relationship between the players and coach within GH is really good.][Can it be bad? Have you ever seen someone else on Titans\u2019 live broadcast? In BK, he basically lined up alone!][What do you know? I used to be a fan of when Titans played singles and now I\u2019m a fan of when Titans plays doubles.][The upstairs person is brilliant. I will give you a thumbs up!][I can\u2019t watch this video. What is going on with all the pink bubbles in the sky?][Previously, I felt that the relationship between these two people might just be business. Now I have confirmed that the parental love is real!][Indeed, this atmosphere really can\u2019t be faked.][Parental love KSWL! Look at Titans\u2019s expression!][The parental love CP fans are moved to tears.][I will only say one thing. They might really be together.]Almost all the comments that followed revolved around the theme of parental love. Lin Yan\u2019s gaze paused for a moment on the word \u2018together\u2019 and he inexplicably felt his mouth becoming dry. He instinctively wanted to touch the cigarettes in his pocket. Then he thought about how he was still in the car and held back.This feeling was really a bit strange. At first, he had thought about opening business with Jing Yuanzhou occasionally from the perspective of the team. However, the outside reaction was too good and he felt vaguely confused when he thought about how these things were just the effects of business.Lin Yan didn\u2019t go any further. He just clicked the save button before exiting the video. He turned around and was about to say something to Jing Yuanzhou sitting next to him. Then he inadvertently saw two familiar figures hugging each other on the other person\u2019s phone screen. He was obviously just looking at it a few seconds ago.Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t have the habit of muting his phone like Lin Yan. He was watching the video with earphones plugged in while he leaned against the seat. He still had a casual expression and it couldn\u2019t be seen what he was thinking in his heart.Lin Yan thought of the comments of the netizens below. He paused for a moment but eventually stayed silent. He withdrew his gaze and started to watch the e-sports media\u2019s comments on the performance of the GH team today.A few minutes later, he turned his head and saw that the video was still on the screen of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s phone. Just as they were about to arrive at the base, he turned his head but the screen remained unchanged.Lin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWasn\u2019t this an infinite loop? Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help feeling dumbfounded. He finally reached out to pull the earphone from Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s right ear and joked, \u201cAre you asleep?\u201dJing Yuanzhou turned around and looked over, obviously very sober. \u201cHmm?\u201dLin Yan glanced at the bright mobile phone screen again and paused a few seconds before saying, \u201cIf you have time to watch this boring video, it\u2019s better to watch the game replay a few times.\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth curved imperceptibly. For a few minutes, he just stared silently at Lin Yan. It wasn\u2019t until he noticed that Lin Yan couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and retracted his gaze that Jing Yuanzhou responded. \u201cOkay Coach.\u201dLin Yan finally saw Jing Yuanzhou close the interface of the short video. In the end, he saw that the man didn\u2019t forget to slowly press the save button. Then he started to scroll down to the IBB highlights.It was as if nothing had happened.It had to be said that the GH team reaching the finals of Burning Hot Assembly was indeed somewhat unexpected. After this match, they became a dark horse that crashed into public view. Since then, all previous videos of their matches had been unearthed by curious netizens.There was immediately an uproar.It was known that for a professional team, the core system was the key to all tactics. The first time the GH team came out, everyone defaulted to the thought that the team would revolve around the top player Titans. Now after paying attention to the previous game videos, they discovered that the top lane where Titans was located wasn\u2019t the core of the GH team!However, if they had to clearly state what lineup system the GH team was running\u2026 even professional netizens who claimed to be tactical experts couldn\u2019t sum it up for a while.In the several games played by GH, there were games that focused on protecting the mid-laner, games that relied on the jungler\u2019s movements, games with the core as the shooter, games where the support assisted the full field and naturally games where the side-laner pushed forward with strength\u2026 in just a few episodes of the show, all of GH\u2019s players were used as the core and there was no repetition at all!People were dumbfounded. What type of routine was this? There was always no shortage of \u2018tactical analysts\u2019 on the Internet but after the in-depth analysis of all of GH\u2019s video data, these people were completely confused by the chaotic tactics.Then after being dizzy, the netizens discovered a very scary point. If GH\u2019s tactical system always maintained such an unpredictable change then it really wasn\u2019t good news for the opponent.\u2018Did the Go Home team go home today?\u2019 This sentence could no longer be a joke. After being adapted by the gradually increasing GH fans, it even became a brand new slogan: Did the Go Home team send you home today?A team with characteristics had always easily attracted more supporters. After the match with the QU team, the tepid GH team finally started to have career fans. There was the official establishment of the fan club. Considering the various competitions that would occur in the future, the fans started to painstakingly consider the team\u2019s image packaging.GH\u2019s official Weibo was usually managed by the team manager Luo Mo. In recent days, he started receiving some strange private messages that he never received before. The contents were clearly very serious but it made people feel a bit speechless.For example, the content of the private message in front of him asked what the GH team\u2019s officials thought about the support club song. As one of the first batch of fans attracted to the support club, it was natural that they were extremely active and wanted to do a good job. They considered the momentum of the song in a very practical manner and sincerely asked questions in the private message.[Hello, GH official. We have three proposals here for the song. Among the three theme songs \u2018A Thousand Miles Away\u2019 and \u2018Unforgivable\u2019, which one do you think is relatively more suitable for the GH team\u2019s temperament? If there is no specific idea then we can adopt the public voting event to let the fans make their own choice.]In the spirit of a professional manager, Luo Mo went online to search for these three seconds. He finally ignored his desire to go crazy and replied: [You can vote yourself.] The fans were satisfied and immediately posted the vote online. The new and old fans of the GH team, including the black fans, participated very enthusiastically.Luo Mo quietly logged onto his side account and voted for the \u2018none of them are good\u2019 option.Unfortunately, his opinion was alone. In the end, the song of the GH Support Club was officially set as \u2018Unforgivable\u2019 due to its wide spread, its catchiness and the fact that it contained enough ridicule.The manager Luo Mo had mixed feelings when he saw that the team had so many active and enthusiastic fans all of a sudden. In the end, he resisted the urge to hit the wall with his head and contacted the PR department to start the next stage of the publicity plan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Some people even feared the world wasn\u2019t chaotic enough and asked the professional league teams what they thought about the GH team, the new team that suddenly emerged.In fact, raising this type of question showed the intention of muddying the water. It wasn\u2019t enough for GH to offend the fans of the secondary league. They even wanted to force another wave of hatred from the professional league fans.As a result, a quarrel soon began.[This year\u2019s dark horse team GH has a mysterious tactical system. Is the professional league circle ready to be reshuffled?][Every year, a dark horse is predicted. What happens to them in the end? It seems the last dark horse has been smashed into the ground!][A veteran team is a veteran team. Titans might\u2019ve transferred there but I still feel it is BK and LDF this year!][Did the person upstairs forget SUU? The two foreign players introduced are both ruthless people. They played fiercely in the mid-season!][You should peck at each other in the mid-season. it is up to the Go Home team to play in the autumn competition.][Excuse me, what is the Go Home team? I\u2019m at a loss seeing it.][I\u2019m laughing to death. Let\u2019s talk about it after GH wins against IBB first. The torture of the secondary league isn\u2019t over yet you\u2019re already thinking about the autumn competition?][I know, isn\u2019t the Go Home team GH? Those who are from a reality show really think they are so awesome. Stop making trouble and watch the mid-season matches!]In the end, it gradually became a battle between variety fans and professional fans. However, no matter how noisy the outside world, it didn\u2019t set off too many waves within the professional circle. It was for a simple reason. These professional teams currently had more important things to pay attention to than the final team of a variety show.The mid-season was in full swing. These teams were clearly focusing all their attention on the opponents they would face at this stage. QU might be at the top of the secondary league but it was only the level of the secondary league after all. There was always a huge gap with the peak strength of the professional league teams.It didn\u2019t matter how much attention Burning Hot Assembly received or whether the final championship team absorbed more fans through this variety show. For the top teams in the professional league, the team that finally stood out was still just a group of people with relative strength who were grandstanding.Therefore, the professional circle devoted all their attention to the mid-season. As for the disturbance caused by the variety show, it was quietly isolated to the outermost periphery.In terms of cycles, the mid-season was obviously much shorter than the spring and autumn competitions.After the first round, the 12 participating teams had formed a certain ranking. Once the second round of the competition was over, the lowest ranked team would enter the relegation list. Then they would compete for the professional quota for the autumn competition with the championship team from the variety show Burning Hot Assembly next week.It had to be said that the staff of Burning Hot Assembly was really capable of doing things. Seeing that the relegation list of the mid-season was about to be finalized, on the last day of the second round, they directly invited GH and IBB to the scene to watch the two last-ranked professional teams competing in the final match.On the much-anticipated arena, there was a team that would fall into the dust while off-court, there were teams eyeing them and trying to replace them. This whole gimmick in itself was exciting.There was still some time before the start of the match. The GH team members waited in an independent lounge arranged by the program\u2019s staff.Bi Yaohua thought of the heated situation that might occur at any time in the future and couldn\u2019t help sighing emotionally. \u201cThe two teams LARK and AIR are a bit too miserable. They are destined to miss the next quarter-finals. If today\u2019s game is lost, they face the risk of being relegated to the secondary league. The official\u2019s actions in the past few years have been getting tougher every year.Jian Ye also sighed. \u201cWho is saying no\u2026 without the program, the professional teams only face the crisis of relegation at the end of the autumn season every year. Doing this is equivalent to downgrading two teams in a year! Not only do the professional teams feel more pressure, it will be a lot harder for the teams in the secondary league to upgrade to the professional league. This is simply driving people to death!\u201dBefore Jian Ye came to the GH team, he was a substitute in the secondary league. He naturally felt a lot of emotions when he thought of this.It wasn\u2019t until he noticed the gazes of other people that he cleared his throat and clarified. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m not saying that this show isn\u2019t good. After all, it allowed our team to attract more people. I just think\u2026\u201dHe scratched his head, not knowing where to start explaining.Gu Luo came out in a friendly manner to help him and sighed. \u201cBrother Gun, we know what you mean. In short, life is cruel and difficult.\u201dJian Ye thought about the severe test his old teammates were about to face and didn\u2019t want to continue this topic.Then he remembered something and the topic suddenly changed. \u201cSpeaking of which, did you see a lot of professional teams when we came in today? Isn\u2019t it the last two matches in the afternoon? These teams have already missed the quarter-finals. Why is everyone here?\u201d\u201cIt should be to investigate the enemy\u2019s situation.\u201d Lin Yan, who had been silent, kept his head down and fiddled with his phone while declaring, \u201cLARK and AIR definitely won\u2019t make it to the quarter-finals according to the current ranking. Apart from the top five stable teams, there are four other teams who want to spring to the quarter-finals but are still short of that final step. It depends on the team who wins today.\u201dIn this way, everyone felt more troubled.Jian Ye shook his head. \u201cHere they are trying to survive while the other side regards them as the next bite of meat to swallow! It is miserable, too miserable!\u201dLin Yan just smiled and finally couldn\u2019t help looking over. \u201cAs expected, you are a healer. No matter how cruel the scar on your face, you still have the heart of Buddha. It\u2019s okay Gun Zai. You shouldn\u2019t worry about their difficulties. The whole thing is to care about the world!\u201dJian Ye looked helpless. \u201cIn fact, I don\u2019t want to be like this. It is just that in order to play a support, I fasted and read Buddhist scriptures for a long time. Now I think that I have recited too many sutras at the time and I can\u2019t adjust my mentality for a while.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t expect there to be such a show. He felt joy for a moment before coming to a conclusion. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. Our team is too murderous. We need your kind heart.\u201dIt was precisely because of this that he first looked at Jian Ye. After all, the other players in GH were more vicious than others when playing. If they didn\u2019t have the powerful backing of a Buddha then it would be difficult to control the entire field.The group of people chatted but Bi Yaohua never said anything. Just then, he suddenly stood up from his position. \u201cI\u2019m going to the bathroom.\u201dLin Yan glanced at the time and reminded him. \u201cThe match will start in a while. We might just be watching but we need to help record the show. Remember not to be late.\u201dBi Yaohua waved his hand. \u201cI know.\u201dThe lounge door closed and Chen Yushen looked up. \u201cDo you feel that Brother Trash Talk wasn\u2019t as talkative today?\u201dGu Luo didn\u2019t think much. He just lowered his head to look at his phone. \u201cMaybe he stayed up all night again yesterday.\u201dIt was common for e-sports teenagers to stay up all night and lose energy the next day. Chen Yushen nodded deeply and didn\u2019t ask any further.Jian Ye talked a bit after Lin Yan mentioned it. He simply pulled a chair over to really talk about Dharma. Jing Yuanzhou had been playing with his phone and didn\u2019t participate in the conversation. At this time, he heard the conversation and couldn\u2019t help looking up. \u201cDo you still understand this?\u201dLin Yan glanced at him in an unfathomable manner. \u201cI know many things. Do you want to try them all?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. Let\u2019s find a day to have a good chat.\u201d\u201cAnytime.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou replied. \u201cDo you want to come to me or will I go to your place?\u201dJian Ye stared at the two of them.Lin Yan gave Jing Yuanzhou a speechless look. \u201cOur rooms are separated by a corridor. Does it make a difference what room we go to?\u201dJing Yuanzhou replied with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dJian Ye looked between Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou and felt that a certain lightbulb in his heart was lit up. He managed with difficulty to open his mouth only for someone to knock on the door.A staff member opened the door and reminded them, \u201cThe match is about to start. Get ready.\u201dSuddenly, everyone found that Bi Yaohua hadn\u2019t come back. Jian Ye\u2019s attention was immediately attracted to this. \u201cWhy is Brother Trash Talk so slow? Does he have constipation?\u201dChen Yushen touched his phone. \u201cI\u2019ll give him a call.\u201dIt rang twice before Bi Yaohua answered. There were no emotions in his voice. \u201cI know, I will come over as soon as possible. You go directly to the auditorium and wait for me. We\u2019ll talk later.\u201dThen he hung up without waiting for a reply from Chen Yushen. Everyone glanced at each other and saw consternation in their eyes. Finally, they stared in an inquiring manner at their coach. Lin Yan frowned slightly and turned to ask Jian Ye. \u201cYou just said that there are several professional teams here today. Do you know which ones they are?\u201dJian Ye thought about it before replying hesitantly, \u201cI saw MEN before and there seemed to be\u2026 QOG?\u201dHis words stopped abruptly. Everyone\u2019s expressions became subtle. QOG was the professional team that Bi Yaohua played for before being officially suspended by the league. If they remembered correctly, Bi Yaohua had an unpleasant relationship with this old club. He directly paid the liquidated damages with his own money and forcibly terminated his contract with them.In the silence, Lin Yan turned around with a blank face and walked out the door. The others rolled up their sleeves and hurried to keep up.Jing Yuanzhou was walking at the end. He noticed the staff member still standing in place in a stunned manner and stopped for a moment. \u201cPlease help tell the director that we have a team member lost in the toilet. We are going to pick him up before going to report in. Don\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t be late.\u201dIt took a long time for the staff member to return to his senses. \u201cAh\u2026 okay.\u201dFreestarHe answered like this but once he saw the backs hurrying to leave, he couldn\u2019t help his mouth twitching. Wasn\u2019t this going to find someone to fight? He would believe it if everyone was going to fight as a group!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If the people outside the bathroom listened carefully in the silence then they would hear faint dialogue coming from inside.Bi Yaohua leaned against the door to block the way out. He hung up the phone and gazed at the people in front of him without a smile. \u201cWhy are you so nervous? Are you afraid I will call someone over? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll settle accounts with you alone. There is no need to trouble others.\u201dThe people in front of him wore casual clothes but it wasn\u2019t difficult to tell the identity of the QOG team from the logo on their backpacks.QOG\u2019s captain Roser frowned. \u201cWe don\u2019t have old accounts with you. BB, you have already retired from the professional team and you can play well in a new team. Is it so interesting to linger on such things? Aren\u2019t you afraid of extending the suspension period?\u201dBi Yaohua sneered sarcastically. \u201cThere is no need for you to worry about this. In short, I find it very interesting.\u201dHe turned to the side slightly and looked at the only familiar figure in the rear with a raised eyebrow. \u201cThis is your new shooter right? Tsk tsk tsk, it is really hard for such a good kid. He worked hard to become a professional player but happened to meet such trash teammates. You should seriously listen to my advice. If there is a chance then it is better to leave QOG as soon as possible. You should be careful of your life when playing with such people!\u201dThe new shooter had only heard rumors about the Trash Talk King\u2019s deeds. He was originally a bit uneasy in such a tense atmosphere and now he was even more stunned. \u201cHuh?\u201dBefore Bi Yaohua could say anything else, Roser had already stepped forward and stopped between the two of them. There was clearly an impatient expression on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s almost there. BB, don\u2019t overdo it.\u201dBi Yaohua felt like he had heard the funniest joke in his life. \u201cNo, Roser, if I am overdoing it then what did you do before? Do I have to thank you for leaving such a thick and colorful stain in my life? I am really curious. How can QOG maintain such a waste mentality? This really makes me sigh! What is that saying? Persisting in doing evil will bring about self-destruction. You are so confident. Aren\u2019t you afraid that sooner or later, the entire circle will know the nature of your smelly garbage?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to argue with you.\u201d Roser took a few deep breaths to try and control himself. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it. What do we need to do for you to let us out?\u201dBi Yaohua was leaning against the door, blocking the only exit of the bathroom. Hearing this, his lips slightly curved up. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple. Apologize.\u201dHis eyes narrowed slightly and there wasn\u2019t too much pleasure in his eyes. His colorful head of hair contained an indescribable arrogance that was just like his contemptuous tone. \u201cKneel down and kowtow a few times in front of Brother Trash Talk. Perhaps I can barely change a bit of my bad mood after seeing you garbage.\u201dQOG\u2019s jungler couldn\u2019t bear it and cursed. \u201cWhat do you want to do when you are still in the suspension period? You are just a bereaved dog. The captain is discussing with you because he still cares about the friendship from when you were on the team. Don\u2019t be shameless!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention being on the same team to me. I feel disgusted when I think about how I played with you.\u201d Bi Yaohua was amused and deliberately raised his head to look around. \u201cTalking about shame, have you ever had it?\u201dQOG\u2019s jungler almost went crazy from anger. He knew it wouldn\u2019t be good for him to argue with words so he impulsively rolled up his sleeves. \u201cCaptain, don\u2019t be polite with this person! We have so many people. Why are we just talking with him? Can\u2019t we go straight through?\u201dBi Yaohua casually touched the broom next to him and tapped it against the ground. \u201cOh? Come on, don\u2019t be polite to me? I have already said it. If you don\u2019t kowtow and admit your mistakes then no one can think about getting out this door!\u201dHis overly arrogant attitude made even the QOG shooter curse in a low voice. \u201cCaptain, fuck him! There is no surveillance here. Let\u2019s show him who is the grandson!\u201dThe atmosphere was extremely tense and seemed like it would be completely ignited.A cold light flashed in Bi Yaohua\u2019s eyes. He was about to say something else when he heard shouting from outside the door. \u201cEveryone inside, get out of the way!\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s eyebrows twitched slightly at the familiar voice. Due to his tacit understanding with his team, he instinctively retreated a few steps back. At almost the same time, there was a violent kick and the locked bathroom door was kicked in from the outside. It hit the wall behind it and made a huge noise. It swayed a lot and almost fell directly to the ground.Bi Yaohua, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFortunately, he had reacted quickly enough. Otherwise he really suspected that he would\u2019ve been crushed by the door just now.Jian Ye had kicked open the door just now. He still maintained his posture and twisted the ankle that was still in the air twice before lowering his leg. He saw Bi Yaohua the moment he looked up and examined him with concern. \u201cBrother Trash Talk, are you okay?\u201dBi Yaohua saw the other people rushing in behind Jian Ye. How could he not understand what was going on? The expression in his eyes changed slightly and he finally couldn\u2019t help letting out a low laugh. \u201cWhat can I do?\u201dAt this sudden change, everyone in QOG was frozen in place. The tense atmosphere disappeared instantly under Jian Ye\u2019s foot. A long time passed before QOG\u2019s jungler managed to choke out a sentence. \u201cBB, you tricked us! You said you didn\u2019t call people over!\u201dBi Yaohua stared at him like he was an idiot. \u201cI just answered the phone. Didn\u2019t you all hear me? Did I say anything? My teammates came over to cover me because they are righteous and were afraid I would be bullied. What\u2019s wrong? Why can\u2019t I have people?\u201dJian Ye saw that these people really were from QOG and his tone became bad. \u201cBrother Trash Talk, don\u2019t talk to them. Now you have a few brothers and I can guarantee that QOG can\u2019t take you!\u201dChen Yushen had already walked in. He stared at the other people in the bathroom with an indifferent expression. \u201cAre they blocking you?\u201dListening to this tone, it seemed he would start directly as long as Bi Yaohua said \u2018yes.\u2019QOG\u2019s players were shocked. Was this the legendary villain complaining first? To make it clear, who was blocking whom? They didn\u2019t want to be near this person. Who would want to block him in the bathroom? Clearly, they were the victims. It was the Trash Talk King finding fault with them and blocking them, okay!Lin Yan saw the situation inside and sighed with relief when he found they hadn\u2019t fought. His eyes swept over the broom in Bi Yaohua\u2019s hand and he asked, \u201cAre you very idle? You came to the public bathroom to clean up?\u201dBi Yaohua was rarely silent. The coach hindered his brazenness so he eventually put the broom back. The QOG players saw that Bi Yaohua had lost the broom in his hand and were a bit relieved. At the same time, they were watching Jian Ye vigilantly.Let\u2019s not mention the excessive scar on his face. Just based on the way he fought on the field, they knew this person was definitely experienced in fighting. He was a ruthless man! The existence of Jian Ye made the atmosphere very subtle for a while.Lin Yan\u2019s gaze fell on Roser, the captain of QOG, and he spoke in a seemingly laughing tone. \u201cThe location where your team reminisces is quite special.\u201dAt this attitude, Roser didn\u2019t know what to say for a while. He couldn\u2019t help glancing at Bi Yaohua next to him and said, \u201cThere is nothing to reminisce about.\u201dBi Yaohua sneered. Perhaps the meaning of the sneer was too heavy. Roser saw it and his face involuntarily became paler.Lin Yan thought about the truth behind Bi Yaohua\u2019s suspension but he had never remembered it. Therefore, he was a bit surprised by the subtle atmosphere of the two men. He originally wanted to come over to support the Trash Talk King. Now it seemed that the captain of QOG was more afraid of private contact than Bi Yaohua.Lin Yan didn\u2019t ask and hummed noncommittally. \u201cThe match is about to start. Since there is nothing wrong, I will take this person away first.\u201dQOG naturally wouldn\u2019t refuse and Roser blurted out, \u201cWe won\u2019t send you off.\u201dLin Yan remained silent as he turned around and left.Bi Yaohua originally just bumped into the QOG team and became angry. He really didn\u2019t want to touch that forbidden line. He lowered his eyes slightly, put his hands into his pant pockets and followed like nothing happened.Jian Ye stood there and didn\u2019t move. He stared at the QOG people and made sure that his teammates had left safely before following them. A moment later, silence returned to the bathroom, leaving the kicked door as the only trace of what happened.It wasn\u2019t until GH disappeared around the corner that QOG were a bit relieved. Then they thought about it and felt a bit unwilling.QOG\u2019s mid-laner glanced at the position of the new shooter, leaned closer to Roser and lowered his voice. \u201cCaptain, why are we so afraid of BB? He has no evidence of what happened back then, not to mention he has withdrawn from the professional circle for so long. It is impossible for him to do anything to us. Look at that arrogant appearance just now. It\u2019s like we really are afraid of him. I said that we should just\u2026\u201dHe abruptly swallowed the rest of his words as the captain\u2019s eyes swept over him.Roser\u2019s eyebrows were tightly gathered together and his tone was a bit low. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that BB is a mad dog? Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t directly scold people in the professional league. Remember my advice, don\u2019t provoke him too much! Otherwise, he really will go crazy and you will suffer!\u201dFreestarQOG\u2019s mid-laner was choked up and he could only curl his lips with disdain. \u201cI say, the entire GH team is very arrogant. It is all because of Titans. They think they\u2019re so awesome just because of a few variety show games? If they really get a place for the autumn competition then we will teach them a lesson on the field!\u201dRoser\u2019s tone was cold. \u201cThen you better pray that they can become the champions of that broken variety show first!\u201dOn the way back, no one spoke. They got closer to the stadium and could hear the loud noises outside.They were about to reach the exit when Lin Yan suddenly stopped. The people behind him were unprepared and almost crashed into a ball if they didn\u2019t put on the brakes on time. Lin Yan ignored the chaos of the team and turned around, taking a few steps without warning.Before Bi Yaohua had time to react, he saw a figure in front of him. He instinctively stepped back. By the time he returned to his senses, Lin Yan had already backed him into the wall.Lin Yan\u2019s voice came from a faint distance and it made people feel a bit cold. \u201cBrother Trask Talk, you can actually block people in the bathroom?\u201dThe turn of events was so sudden that Jian Ye couldn\u2019t recover for a long time. \u201cWhat is the situation? Wasn\u2019t Brother Trask talk blocked by QOG?\u201dLin Yan smiled and said nothing. Under this gaze, Bi Yaohua felt rare embarrassment and finally cleared his throat. \u201cIt\u2019s correct that I blocked them.\u201dThe truth was the truth. He just hadn\u2019t expected the support of his teammates to be so fast. He paused before speaking again. \u201cStill, thank you for coming to me rescue.\u201dHowever, Jian Ye\u2019s sense of accomplishment had completely collapsed. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. I\u2019m now doubting who I just saved!\u201dBi Yaohua\u2019s mouth curved up slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t doubt it. You really saved me.\u201dHe was well aware of his temper. He could be indifferent to many things but once he encountered something that mattered, the consequences of his impulses were immeasurable. If his teammates hadn\u2019t arrived at the right now, it was hard to imagine how the entire situation would have developed if he faced the trash of QOG alone. Perhaps a fight would\u2019ve already started.It didn\u2019t matter if he vented his emotions or not. It was never a good thing for professional players to touch that forbidden line.Lin Yan saw that Bi Yaohua was somewhat aware of the problem with his handling method and released this person. He asked quietly, \u201cSo how did you get to this step?\u201dBi Yaohua knew that Lin Yan was asking about the trouble in that year but for a while, he didn\u2019t know where to start.Just then, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice was heard from behind Lin Yan. \u201cIt should be a fake game.\u201dLin Yan had some speculations about this previously and there wasn\u2019t much change in his expression. The other members couldn\u2019t help sucking in a breath. They naturally knew how bad this type of thing was.A hint of surprise flashed in Bi Yaohua\u2019s eyes and he looked up.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s tone was as objective as ever. \u201cIt was a coincidence that I was watching the QOG match that day due to the Trash Talk King\u2019s fame. The rhythm of the match was indeed a bit strange but it was just my personal guess. There was no evidence and it wasn\u2019t easy to speak. The parties involved should be clearer about the specific situation.\u201dBi Yaohua was silent for a moment before declaring coldly, \u201cYes, it was playing a fake match and deliberately losing!\u201dEven a person like him was reluctant to think back on such things. It showed how big the impact was. He had always been clear about what he wanted. He was willing to join the QOG team because he sincerely believed this club would be the starting point of his dream. He never expected that these two games almost became the last straw to crush him.The pure and dazzling dream of a youth, how many times could it bear such trampling?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Today, all members of the GH team seemed very cooperative. It was precisely because they were so cooperative that the show\u2019s staff weren\u2019t used to it.It might sound a bit mean but if existences who were usually too noisy suddenly fell quiet then it indeed made people feel an unprecedented panic. Just like now.The match ended and AIR eventually defeated LARK with a weak 2:1 advantage, keeping their place in the professional league\u2019s autumn competition. It was officially determined that LARK would miss the next autumn competition and entered the official relegation list.The program\u2019s crew acted in a timely manner and gave a close-up of the LARK team leaving the stage. Then they turned around and placed the close-up on the two teams, GH and IBB. It was the same background but a completely different atmosphere. After comparing the old and new, all the contents of today\u2019s shooting were officially completed.On the way back, today\u2019s experience inevitably made people feel a bit uncomfortable. They might be in the same circle but they didn\u2019t really feel much when it didn\u2019t involve them. It was only when they were in such a situation that they felt the e-sports industry was really cruel. The peak period for every professional player was only a few years. The end of each match meant the beginning of something and also the end of something.It was unknown how many players made some achievements as newcomers only to retire due to various factors such as age, physical condition, etc. However, there were more people like today\u2019s LARK who didn\u2019t have time to show their prominence before being forced to sadly leave the field. Still, even a team full of unwillingness like LARK was already the envy of many secondary league teams. For these secondary league teams, at least the LARK team already stood in the professional league.In contrast, it wasn\u2019t known if it was lucky or unlucky to have this type of regret.Before today, no one had thought about it so deeply. Now in the dull atmosphere, Jian Ye couldn\u2019t help pinching his eyebrows. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t think about these things anymore! I really can\u2019t stand it!\u201dChen Yushen spoke in a low voice, \u201cWill you feel better if you think that we will be the team that replaces LARK?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Jian Ye was silent as he thought about it. \u201cFuck, my conscience seems to hurt more.\u201dLin Yan heard up to here and lazily raised his eyes. \u201cHurry up and take away your cheap sympathy. Poor LARK? The last thing you need on the battlefield is sympathy. E-sports has always been a matter of strength. If you want to become a professional player then don\u2019t care about these things. Today, you sympathize with LARK. Tomorrow, will you sympathize with AIR? Young masters, are you here to play the game or do charity? Huh? According to me, if you have time to feel such meaningless sympathy then it is better to think about how many people are waiting to see our team as a joke. If you really dare to lose to IBB in the finals then I will see how many people will come to sympathize with you.\u201dThe overly realistic words made everyone\u2019s hearts hurt and the car suddenly fell quiet.Lin Yan didn\u2019t want to hurt the enthusiasm of the players too much. Instead of stimulating them, he chose to use the power of their idol. \u201cHaven\u2019t I always said that you should learn from Titans? A phenomenal top player in the Burning Hot League has maintained the same expression from the LARK match to now. He didn\u2019t even blink and has no sympathy. Look, this is what a serious professional player should look like. Do you understand?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was sitting next to Lin Yan and playing with his mobile phone. He felt the gazes that fell on him and couldn\u2019t help glancing silently at Lin Yan. Nevertheless, Lin Yan was anxious to drag him into the water. \u201cGod Jing, Captain, Titans, shouldn\u2019t you say a few words at this time?\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed a bit. Then he thought about it and opened his mouth very cooperatively. \u201cWe are all thinking too much. It isn\u2019t bad for LARK to enter the relegation list. They have been in a sluggish state and will only face greater pressure staying in the professional league. During this period, the LARK fans have been scolding them for a long time. It isn\u2019t bad to take this opportunity to go to the secondary league and calm down. Then it might not be impossible to make a comeback.\u201dThis attitude was indeed too cold and ruthless but the words were objective enough.Gu Luo couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cI always feel that no matter what field it is, the taste will change once the fan circle gets involved.\u201dJian Ye had many feelings but he was amused by this sentence. He extended his hand and patted Gu Luo\u2019s back. \u201cOkay, how can you be so sad at such a young age?!\u201dThe atmosphere in the car was noisy for a while but Bi Yaohua didn\u2019t say anything during this period. The others knew he was in a bad mood due to the QOG team and didn\u2019t mean to disturb him at all. It was like this all the way back to the base.It was precisely time for dinner when they got back. The cooking aunt had already prepared the meal and the group gathered in the dining room to eat together. According to the original plan, the team still had a lot of training content tonight. However, Lin Yan took into account their emotional impact and kindly called it off.After dinner, everyone went back to their rooms and the entire base instantly fell quiet. The first floor was empty and silent. It wasn\u2019t until 9 o\u2019clock in the evening that the faint sound of footsteps was heard in the corridor. Gu Luo wore slippers and crept into the training room.It might not be too late but he thought that everyone else should be resting in their rooms due to the rare absence of training. He didn\u2019t expect to see a faint light in the darkness as soon as he opened the door.The bright computer screen was the only light source in the training room and it gave the face of the person in front of it a strange whiteness. Such a scene late at night caused Gu Luo\u2019s heart to jump a few times.He screamed and instinctively retreated, only to crash into broad arms. Everything happened in the silence which made him feel that he was no good.Jian Ye, who was hit, grabbed Gu Luo quickly so that the mid-laner didn\u2019t fall to the ground. He was speechless. \u201cWhat are you doing Gloy? Why so surprised?\u2019Hearing the familiar voice, Gu Luo\u2019s mouth twitched and he tried to recover from the fright. \u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing. Brother Gun, why are you here?\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t answer and instead glanced into the training room. \u201cAbyss, what are you doing in the training room alone?\u201dChen Yushen, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIn fact, he wanted to ask this.The three men fell silent at the same time. Even if no one answered, they all actually knew why they were here.It was obvious that after going back to their room, they couldn\u2019t help searching for videos of the two QOG games that year. They naturally saw the extremely grand occasion where Bi Yaohua scolded his teammates in front of the global live broadcast.At that time, the entire channel was completely filled with the endless scolding that was refreshing crazily. Piece by piece, the text almost covered the entire canyon. How terribly did QOG play in those two games and how fierce was the Trash Talk King\u2019s final wave of output.Similarly, the negative comments on the barrage were also overwhelming. They might not be the person involved but they couldn\u2019t help trembling with anger when they put themselves in Bi Yaohua\u2019s situation.As he was doing his best for his dream, his teammates completely lost their dignity as professional players for dirty, illegal money. How disgusting. Yet there was nothing he could do with no evidence despite knowing his teammates were playing a fake game. The penalty for slandering players wasn\u2019t much lighter than other forbidden areas.It could be imagined what mood Bi Yaohua was in at the time. Even though he was furious, all he could do was a wave of mockery on the field before asking QOG to terminate the contract, returning to his old land of the live broadcast room.Perhaps it was because they just watched the LARK match today and then saw the QOG game videos. They just had to think about how so many players were still working hard to pursue their dreams while there was still a group of people who trampled on the sacred identity of a professional player and the anger of Gu Luo and the others became even more uncontrollable.Jian Ye gritted his teeth and spoke in a deep voice. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep so I wanted to play a few games to practice.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cMe too.\u201dIt was no wonder that Bi Yaohua was so passionate back then. They just reviewed the video of the games and when they thought about Brother Trash Talk being bullied by those guys, they felt itchy and unbearable. They were afraid they would really go crazy if they didn\u2019t find a place to vent.Chen Yushen\u2019s screen was stuck on the game settlement interface. The MVP data after a slaughter was very eye-catching. He heard these words and said in a low voice, \u201cLet\u2019s go together.\u201dJian Ye and Gu Luo looked at each other. They didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at this tacit understanding. In the end, no one said anything. They went to their positions and turned on the computer.In fact, they didn\u2019t have too many thoughts at this time. They just fucking wanted to do it! It was only after they vented everything that they found they had unknowingly played a few games.Gu Luo rubbed his somewhat sore eyes and asked in a daze, \u201cBrother, what time is it now?\u201dJian Ye glanced at the lower right corner and reacted. \u201cI didn\u2019t pay much attention. It\u2019s past midnight.\u201dThe entire training room was plunged into darkness and only three computer screens were faintly lit. Gu Luo hummed. He planned to say something only to hear a click and the lights above his head turned on. His words choked in his throat.He looked back and was stunned when he saw two people at the door. \u201cCaptain, Coach, why are you here too?\u201dLin Yan leaned against the door, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly as he spoke to the person next to him. \u201cI said they would be here. Didn\u2019t I guess right? You were willing to gamble. Are you willing to admit defeat?\u201dJing Yuanzhou obediently lost. \u201cYes, you won.\u201dLin Yan was in a good mood after winning the bet. He glanced at the three stunned people and joked, \u201cWhy are you running to the training room at night? The lights aren\u2019t turned on and the door isn\u2019t closed. If I didn\u2019t know anything, I would really think there was a thief in the base. What\u2019s the matter? I was good enough to give you a break yet you came here to train yourself. I didn\u2019t know you were so active. Should I think about increasing the intensity of the training?\u201dJian Ye\u2019s eyebrow jumped when he heard this and he hurriedly said, \u201cNo Coach, we didn\u2019t mean it! The amount of training now is definitely enough!\u201dLin Yan laughed silently. \u201cOh?\u201dOf course, he had guessed the reason why these people ran to the training room at night and didn\u2019t continue to tease them. He looked around and asked, \u201cSo what is the situation now? Are you finished? If you are almost done, do you want to go out for a late night snack?\u201dGu Luo had just played a few rounds in a rage. Once his spirit relaxed, he really did feel a bit hungry. Hearing this, he smiled and exclaimed, \u201cYes! I will go and call Brother Trash Talk!\u201dLin Yan certainly had no opinion on this. \u201cCome back quickly.\u201dTwo minutes later, there was a knock on Bi Yaohua\u2019s door.Unlike the others, as the party involved, he didn\u2019t need nor was he interested in looking back on his heroic past. Due to his bad mood from meeting the QOG players today, he lay motionless in bed when he returned to the room and stared up at the ceiling all night.When he opened the door, he hadn\u2019t even changed his clothes. He was slightly stunned when he saw Gu Luo at the door. \u201cGloy, what\u2019s wrong? Why come at this time?\u201dGu Luo might\u2019ve killed in the game all night but he still failed to calm the restlessness in his heart.At this time, he saw Bi Yaohua and he couldn\u2019t help feeling distressed. This made him show an unprecedented enthusiasm. \u201cBrother Trash Talk, you haven\u2019t taken a shower? That\u2019s just right! The Coach has invited us for a late night supper. Let\u2019s go together!\u201dBi Yaohua really wasn\u2019t in the mood today and he refused without hesitation. \u201cNo, you guys have fun. I won\u2019t\u2026\u201dHe hadn\u2019t finished his words when Gu Luo pulled him toward the top of the stairs without looking back. \u201cHurry up, everyone is downstairs and they\u2019re waiting for you!\u201dBi Yaohua couldn\u2019t recover for a while. He was actually dragged by this little guy a few steps. He had just opened his mouth to say something when he glanced up inadvertently and paused for a moment. If he remembered correctly, Gu Luo was now wearing the same clothes as when he went to watch the match this afternoon. He obviously hadn\u2019t changed his clothes. It seemed that the others were the same as him. They didn\u2019t have the thought of taking a shower and resting\u2026Bi Yaohua\u2019s eyes instantly shook. The corners of his mouth rose slightly before he regained his usual indifferent tone. \u201cHowever, now that you say this, I do seem a bit hungry.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 66": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 50Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBusiness was booming at a barbecue stall on the side of the road. In the thick smoke, a colorful figure could be seen sitting at a table. Such eye-catching hair wasn\u2019t common and it attracted the attention of people passing by late at night.The host Lin Yan was very polite. He basically ordered each of the skewers sold at the stall and placed them on the table one by one in a quite imposing manner. He saw the barbecue stall owner enthusiastically bringing over another pot and picked up a shiitake mushrooms skewer, placing it in his mouth. He had just taken a bite when he noticed the gazes around him. He wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe expressions of the GH members were somewhat regretful. They exchanged looks with each other before Jian Ye expressed their feelings as a representative of the team. \u201cCoach, why did you think about bringing us here to eat?\u201dOutsiders regarded Lin Yan as an ordinary coach hired by the GH club. It didn\u2019t matter if they didn\u2019t know his true identity but the people in the GH team knew the golden background of the prince of the Lin Group.They originally thought that even if Lin Yan didn\u2019t pick a five star hotel, at the very least it should be a high-end restaurant. After all, in many people\u2019s mind, this type of person who was born with a golden spoon in his mouth should be particular about his daily diet. They never expected him to take them to such a grounded place.Bi Yaohua bit on the chicken drumstick while deliberately joking, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Coach, it is okay for us to eat at this roadside stall. However, if you set the venue here, doesn\u2019t it go against your identity?\u201dLin Yan smiled when he heard the words. \u201cHow does it go against my identity? In the e-sports field, how many people haven\u2019t eaten barbecue on the side of the road at night? Let me tell you, there used to be a team that ate barbecue every night. When they went abroad for a game, they went outside to look for food. They couldn\u2019t find a barbecue stall and almost starved to death on the street.\u201dBi Yaohua was amused. \u201cWhat team is so 250 (idiot)? Why haven\u2019t I heard of it?\u201dLin Yan was blowing hot air and just blinked with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret.\u201dThen he calmly changed the subject. \u201cI said it\u2019s my treat today but it\u2019s your captain paying the bill. Thank Titans if you want. You can eat whatever you want. There is money and it is enough to take care of you!\u201dThe others heard the words and stared at Jing Yuanzhou. Jing Yuanzhou shrugged slightly. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I just learned about it.\u201dLin Yan glanced at him. \u201cYou were willing to make a bet and you lost. You have to do whatever I choose. Don\u2019t try to cheat me.\u201dJian Ye remembered the two people\u2019s conversation in the training room and understood. He couldn\u2019t help sighing, \u201cCoach, the average price here is like this. We can\u2019t spend so much no matter what we order. I don\u2019t know if you chose this place to give us some leeway to play but isn\u2019t this saving too much money for the captain?\u201dLin Yan laughed. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with saving money? Being thrifty is a virtue.\u201dThere was a sudden silence in the area. In the end, Gu Luo sighed softly. \u201cBrother Gun, you don\u2019t understand. The captain\u2019s money is also the coach\u2019s money.\u201dThe deep meaning behind the words obviously wasn\u2019t understood by the others. They just thought Gu Luo was referring to the coach\u2019s salary. They laughed together a few times and didn\u2019t comment any further.Putting aside everything else, this barbecue was really cheap and delicious. The smell was good. The group of people were eating in a very lively manner. Jian Ye was in the mood and couldn\u2019t help asking for some beer from the stall owner.Lin Yan thought it was hard for everyone to go out so he didn\u2019t stop it.Several people in the team were adults but only Jian Ye and Bi Yaohua were interested in drinking. One of them was bold and unrestrained in nature while the other had something hidden in his heart today. Even Chen Yushen filled up half his cup. Only Gu Luo insisted on holding a can of Wangzai milk alone.Jian Ye naturally felt it wasn\u2019t happy enough. He saw that the glass in front of Lin Yan was empty and held up a beer can, prepared to come over and help pour some. \u201cCoach, would you like some?\u201dLin Yan glanced at his glass. He was about to say something but there was already a hand blocking in front of him. Jing Yuanzhou had been playing with his mobile phone but now he suddenly spoke. \u201cThe coach doesn\u2019t drink.\u201dIt was a good opportunity to drink to your heart\u2019s content. This made Jian Ye feel a bit pained. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019re having a meal outside. Isn\u2019t it okay to have a few drinks?\u201d\u201cTitans is right. I really can\u2019t drink.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s reaction reminded Lin Yan of the situation in the bar street at the time. He didn\u2019t look at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s expression and just gave a low cough. \u201cThen I\u2019ll replace beer with tea.\u201dThen he picked up the wintermelon tea and poured a small cup. He shook the cup slightly and couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit amused. \u201cI have to say this color looks a lot like beer.\u201dJian Ye\u2019s mouth twitched. He wanted to say something when he heard Gu Luo add, \u201cThen I will use milk instead of beer.\u201dJian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dOne was worse than the other. He didn\u2019t want to talk anymore.Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help smiling at Lin Yan\u2019s cooperative attitude before handing his empty cup to Jian Ye. \u201cI\u2019ll accompany you.\u201dThis finally made Jian Ye feel a bit relieved. Next to him, Bi Yaohua had already opened a can of beer and drank it with his head up. Then he opened another can and found that the others were still. He eagerly asked them, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dThe group stood up and raised their cups. They collided in one place in mid-air and there was a clear sound. \u201cJiayou for the finals!\u201dThey finished this cup and couldn\u2019t help looking forward to the future together while eating.In the environment of the roadside stall, these heroic youths were free and at ease. By the end of the meal, most of them were somewhat emotional.Tonight, Bi Yaohua was undoubtedly the most talkative. His endless chatter didn\u2019t even hinder the rhythm of his drink. He drank one can after another and a large number of empty cans was piled up at his feet in the blink of an eye.No one stopped him. They had actually discussed it in private. Today they would let Brother Trash Talk do whatever he wanted. What was the big deal about getting drunk? They just needed to carry him back together. Therefore, Chen Yushen quietly accompanied him to drink. Bi Yaohua wasn\u2019t too drunk. His white skin just gradually developed an unusual red color.Lin Yan saw that the children were in high spirits and didn\u2019t bother them. He lit a cigarette and placed it in his mouth while holding one out to Jing Yuanzhou as well. \u201cDo you want to smoke?\u201dJing Yuanzhou shook his head. \u201cNo, only one of smoking or drinking can be done a day.\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help laughing. He didn\u2019t know if he should ridicule the weird health regimen of these elderly players. Jing Yuanzhou looked at the time and stood up. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time. I\u2019ll pay the bill.\u201dLin Yan responded positively and lowered his head to look at Weibo. As he saw the online comments about the afternoon match, he gave a noncommittal smile and picked up the cup on the table.Chen Yushen looked back to see such a scene. After blinking, he paused dully for a few seconds before reacting. \u201cCoach, that is my\u2026\u201dBefore he finished, Lin Yan had already emptied it. The taste that was different from what he expected made him stunned for a moment. He choked a few times but he had already swallowed it all down his throat. The taste of beer instantly filled his mouth.Chen Yushen finally finished his words. \u201cThat is\u2026 my cup.\u201dLin Yan silently stared at the empty cup. After returning it to Chen Yushen, he lowered his head and stared at the phone screen. The speed at which he scrolled down Weibo became slower and it finally stayed on the same interface for a long time.Since everyone drank a lot today, the stall owner spent a bit more time checking the alcohol list. After paying, Jing Yuanzhou came back and saw that people were still making noise. He asked, \u201cAre you ready to go back?\u201dBefore the others could respond, Lin Yan stood up with a cough. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dEveryone had become accustomed to following Lin Yan\u2019s order.Now that the coach had spoken, they all stood up without commenting. This evening, in addition to Jian Ye, Bi Yaohua was the one who drank the most. He inevitably shook when he got up and was quickly caught by Chen Yushen\u2019s fast hands and eyes. However, he wasn\u2019t caught and the two of them just changed directions together. They fell like dominoes onto Jian Ye.Jian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dJian Ye was still standing upright but it was a bit hard for him to carry two people by himself. He could only ask Gu Luo, the only one who hadn\u2019t touched alcohol tonight to come and help. Gu Luo had only drank milk all night and he was naturally the most sober among them.It wasn\u2019t easy but he managed to pull Chen Yushen to him. He raised his head to ask for help but unknowingly, the remaining two people had already walked away together. He opened his mouth but finally gave up shouting over such a long distance. However, the direction the coach and captain were walking in\u2026 wasn\u2019t to where they parked the car?In fact, Jing Yuanzhou had noticed the anomaly in Lin Yan\u2019s actions when he came back and he followed in order to see the situation. He might\u2019ve drank a bit tonight but he was still fairly sober.At this time, the surrounding night breeze blew so that he was enveloped with the faint smell of alcohol. His gaze was firmly attached to the back of the person in front of him and he frowned as he felt more doubts. He naturally knew that this direction was away from the parking space. He had thought there was something wrong with Lin Yan but he finally determined that it wasn\u2019t right.He was just about to call out to the person in front of him when he saw Lin Yan\u2019s steps become slightly crooked and he hit the street light pole nearby. Then Lin Yan took advantage of the situation and firmly hugged the pole.Jing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe vaguely realized something and quickly stepped forward to hold this person. He lowered his head and looked at the face that wasn\u2019t different from usual in a slightly speechless manner. \u201cDid you drink?\u201dLin Yan raised his head after hearing the voice. His gaze fixed on the face close by and he blinked slowly. A long time passed before he understood the question. The corners of his lips lowered and he shook his head. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t intentional but\u2026 I did drink a little bit.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was very sure that Lin Yan had been drinking wintermelon tea all night. Then it must\u2019ve happened during the time when he went to pay the bill. He just didn\u2019t know how it happened.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t say much. He raised Lin Yan\u2019s hand and placed it around his shoulder. \u201cGo back first.\u201dHowever, he couldn\u2019t take a step forward. Lin Yan just changed his posture from hanging on the street light to hanging on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s body. He was motionless as if rooted in place.His eyes were stuck on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s face. Then after a while, he gave a low laugh as if only then recognizing the person in front of him. \u201cAh\u2026 it\u2019s you!\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes shook slightly. The dark surroundings and the low laughter made it hard for him not to think about the scene when they first met. At that time, this man was also drunkenly wrapped around him like a cat with teeth and claws.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s first impression of Lin Yan was a drunken maniac. Now it seemed the maniac part was real but it wasn\u2019t because he drank too much. It was simply because of a poor alcohol tolerance.Lin Yan\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t look drunk, they looked bright. Jing Yuanzhou saw him like this and the voice that usually didn\u2019t show much emotions slightly softened. \u201cYes, it\u2019s me. Do you want to go back with me now?\u201dLin Yan seemed to think about it seriously. Then his entire body relaxed and softened as he muttered in a low voice, \u201cYou are mine. You should go back with me.\u201dJing Yuanzhou coaxed him. \u201cYes, I am yours. I will go back with you.\u201dHe took advantage of this to pull Lin Yan so that this person didn\u2019t fall to the ground. Lin Yan seemed to react to such a move. Almost instinctively, he held onto Jing Yuanzhou. His lightly blank eyes stared at the face in front of him. \u201cYes, follow me. I\u2019ll go back.\u201dA hand touched his chest and Jing Yuanzhou could feel the alcohol that was originally silent in his body. It seemed ready to come out. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s lips slightly tightened and he grabbed the restless hand, warning in a low voice, \u201cStop it.\u201dLin Yan currently didn\u2019t have much strength and he was grabbed like this. He was completely imprisoned and unable to move. He could only glare in a dissatisfied manner. The expression in his eyes was more dazed than usual. The street lights shone in the night. This was obviously a simple action but it was easy to make people addicted.Jing Yuanzhou had always felt that his drinking capacity was good. Yet tonight, he only had a few drinks and everything around him seemed drunk and blurred. Suddenly, the ringing of a mobile phone broke the silence. Seeing that Lin Yan was really ready to take an unsteady step to lead him, Jing Yuanzhou quickly grabbed this person and pressed him hard into his arms. In this position, their bodies were close to each other and their quick heartbeats could be felt.He took a deep breath and made sure that Lin Yan had settled down temporarily before answering the call. The call was from Gu Luo.Bi Yaohua and Chen Yushen were already asleep in the car. He and Jian Ye had been waiting but the two people hadn\u2019t returned. Therefore, Gu Luo chose to call and ask about the situation.Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the man in his arms but this person still wasn\u2019t quite right. He could feel the hands that Lin Yan unknowingly pressed to his waist and he couldn\u2019t help his eyes darkening. He had to admit that bringing Lin Yan back to the car in this state was too much of a test on his patience.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s efforts to maintain his sanity made him feel that it was more convenient to take a taxi. He tried to ensure that his voice wasn\u2019t too tense as he replied, \u201cI have something to do with the coach. Let the driver take you back first. There is no need to wait for us.\u201dGu Luo felt some doubts and asked with concern, \u201cThe coach\u2026 is he okay?\u201dLin Yan had walked too unsteadily that it was indeed easy to make people think something else.Jing Yuanzhou took a deep breath. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll take care of him.\u201dJing Yuanzhou hung up and looked down at the person still wrapped around him. \u201cDo you still want me?\u201dLin Yan was confused and instinctively replied, \u201cI want you.\u201dJing Yuanzhou found it hard to control the impulse to keep this person in place and pressed the restless guy tighter into his arms. \u201cThen cooperate a little bit.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He leaned his entire body quietly on Jing Yuanzhou like a pendant.It had to be said that such a scene was too familiar. Jing Yuanzhou still remembered the first time they met. This man was obediently led by him to the hotel. Then\u2026He didn\u2019t want to continue thinking about the rest of those memories.He called a car with the mobile phone app and dragged Lin Yan to wait by the side of the road. It was 1 o\u2019clock in the morning and the surroundings were covered in darkness. Before they knew it, summer had passed. The evening wind seemed to bring a slight coolness that entered their neckline from time to time, scratching bitterly at the skin.Jing Yuanzhou might be an e-sports player but he had the habit of getting up and running every morning. He didn\u2019t have the professional-specific night owl attribute and he didn\u2019t remember who long it had been since he was awake so late.Now, the man hanging from his body seemed to light a fire and he felt no sleepiness at all. Lin Yan just leaned quietly against him. The slender eyelashes were hanging down obediently and his expression was blank. His eyes were blurred and there was an unspeakable charm. It made people want to take a bite.Jing Yuanzhou looked down, his eyes fixed on such a face.A long time passed before he used one hand to pull this person up as much as possible. His other hand struggled for a bit before dragging down the coat to cover Lin Yan\u2019s body. He unceremoniously covered the entire person like this.Lin Yan\u2019s eyebrows came together slightly. Perhaps he was thinking about the previous agreement but he was very restrained and allowed Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s actions. Jing Yuanzhou saw this person\u2019s eyes and couldn\u2019t help reaching out a hand to rub Lin Yan\u2019s head lightly. Then he inevitably laughed. Seeing Lin Yan\u2019s current appearance, he couldn\u2019t say if this person\u2019s drinking tolerance was good or not.The car called by the app was nearby. It made a few turns before soon arriving at the intersection where they were located.Jing Yuanzhou helped Lin Yan into the car. He adjusted Lin Yan into a comfortable posture, pressing this person\u2019s head against his shoulder before reporting the address of the team\u2019s base to the driver.The driver was quite talkative. He glanced at the rearview mirror while waiting for a red light and asked with a smile, \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201dLin Yan was originally half squinting. Once he heard such a sentence, he suddenly opened them very aggressively and declared sovereignty. \u201cHe is mine!\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. He pushed Lin Yan back down into his arms and told the driver, \u201cIt isn\u2019t that type of relationship for the time being.\u201dSuch an answer fully reflected the art of speaking. It wasn\u2019t now but it didn\u2019t mean it wouldn\u2019t be in the future.There was a green light and the car started driving again. The driver turned his attention to the front and nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019m not mistaken. You like him.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was lowering the car window next to Lin Yan to give him some air. He paused in his actions before smiling slightly. \u201cYes, I like him.\u201dHe looked down at the man in his arms as he spoke. Perhaps he had pressed a bit too hard just now. Lin Yan was buried deep in his arms and didn\u2019t say anything again. He was breathing peacefully and Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t tell if he was asleep or not.Jing Yuanzhou smiled. He saw Lin Yan\u2019s hand falling to the side and reached out to grab it. Currently, the posture of the two people was somewhat ambiguous. Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t know where to put the hand so he simply held it directly. The fingers were rubbed lightly and silently interlocked. In the quiet atmosphere, he could hear the other person\u2019s heartbeat.Jing Yuanzhou slowly exhaled and looked sideways out the window. The place where they ate the barbecue wasn\u2019t far from the base. After a few intersections, they reached the gate. Jing Yuanzhou wanted to pull back his hand only to find that Lin Yan had unconsciously held it back.There was no way. He could only take out his mobile phone with his other hand to complete the payment. Then he carried the groggy guy out of the car with difficulty. The driver\u2019s business was probably quite slow in the middle of the night. As they closed the door, he rolled down the window and teased before leaving, \u201cYour future boyfriend will be very clingy.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was taken aback when he heard the words. He looked down at the person pulling on him and the corners of his mouth curved up even more. He watched for a while before finally giving up on the idea of taking photos as commemoration. If it was discovered then Lin Yan would be angry. He didn\u2019t have so many coins to coax Lin Yan.At this point, the entire GH base was silent. The others had come back first and apparently went to their rooms to sleep.Jing Yuanzhou had to maintain this weird posture to take Lin Yan all the way back to the dormitory. He found the key from his trouser pocket with difficulty, opened the door and finally put the drunken man safely on the bed. He was about to pull out his hand when Lin Yan suddenly shot up from the bed and grabbed him. \u201cWhere do you want to go?\u201dJing Yuanzhou, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan was staring at him in this way. He was clearly confused but his eyes were amazingly bright. He grabbed Jing Yuanzhou with one hand and gently patted his bed with the other. He was soft and warm as he said, \u201cSleep together.\u201dThe languid tone was like an invisible hand grabbing at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s heart. There was an unbearable taste that was ready to move, quietly emerging from somewhere in his body.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mouth pressed together tightly.Lin Yan saw this person standing still and frowned with dissatisfaction. Then he used a bit of force to pull Jing Yuanzhou to the bed. Jing Yuanzhou could only choose to sit down on the bed temporarily but his voice and eyes were a bit heavy from impatient desire. \u201cYou should rest. I\u2019m going back to sleep.\u201dLin Yan obviously didn\u2019t intend to accept his suggestion. \u201cNo, we are both here. Of course we will sleep together!\u201dHe frowned for a bit before suddenly remembering something. \u201cBy the way\u2026 I have many coins here. How much money do you want to accompany me to sleep? I\u2019ll go\u2026 get it for you. I have a lot!\u201dAs if to prove his wealth, he turned around to get out of bed. He wanted to go to the table with the piggy bank on it. However, his body was so soft that he barely walked two steps before he weakened.Fortunately, Jing Yuanzhou had been paying attention to Lin Yan\u2019s movements and quickly pulled him. Under the effect of the sudden force, the two people collided in this manner. They fell back down onto the bed.Don\u2019t look at Lin Yan\u2019s tall and slender figure. He was 1.8 meters tall after all so this impact could be considered huge. Even so, Jing Yuanzhou had no time to care about the pain. He could feel the man\u2019s body pressed against him.Lin Yan\u2019s entire face was buried in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s neck. Lin Yan was drunk and confused and it seemed he hadn\u2019t reacted to what happened yet. His alcohol filled breath gently touched Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s neck.It was probably because this hit was a bit hard. He instinctively reached out and touched indiscriminately, muttering in a low voice, \u201cUm\u2026 it hurts.\u201dThe fingertips wandering Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s chest stimulated his skin and he burst into flames in an instant. Jing Yuanzhou took two deep breaths and held the restless hands firmly, his neck uncontrollably tense. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll accompany you. I don\u2019t need money.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t known how much Lin Yan had heard. Perhaps he only heard the last sentence \u2018I don\u2019t need money\u2019. In any case, he nodded in satisfaction and finally stopped moving. Quiet was quiet but this posture was a bit too much of a test on one\u2019s endurance.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze stayed on the ceiling for a while. He took a few deep breaths before reaching out to the person pressing on him. He pushed slightly and finally sent Lin Yan to the pillow next to him.Perhaps it was due to the familiar environment but this drunk person instinctively relaxed. However, the two of them only changed direction. Lin Yan\u2019s hands were still tightly wrapped around Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s waist and his entire body was buried in his broad embrace.The surroundings calmed down completely and Jing Yuanzhou could feel the breathing next to him casually quiet down. However, Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t sleep. In this posture, the two of them clung to each other without almost any gaps.Lin Yan\u2019s soft hair stroked his skin from time and time and his breath rubbed lightly across the skin. This made the flames in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s body ready to move and his blood boiled. Jing Yuanzhou wondered if this person was deliberately doing it. Then he looked down and only saw a peaceful, sleeping face.He really was asleep.After a moment of silence, Jing Yuanzhou struggled to turn off the bedside light. He closed his eyes in the darkness, completely suppressing the impulse tearing at his sense of reason. Before this, Jing Yuanzhou never thought that someone like him would fall into such an embarrassing situation one day.In the darkness, he could feel the other person squeezing into his arms restlessly. Jing Yuanzhou took a deep breath, let out a slightly heavy breath and pulled the other person into his arms before Lin Yan could do any more aggressive actions.It was late at night but he was more sober than ever. He didn\u2019t sleep all night.Bi Yaohua had a hangover and woke up unusually early the next day. He held his aching head and prepared to go downstairs for breakfast in a faze. As he was walking through the corridor, he happened to see the door diagonally opposite him open.Bi Yaohua remembered whose room this belonged to and was about to go up to say hello. He didn\u2019t even have time to say the word \u2018Coach\u2019 when he saw the person who came out and his entire body was firmly nailed in place.Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t expected to meet anyone at this time. The exhaustion from staying up all night made him too lazy to say anything. He was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cGood morning. I\u2019m going to make up some sleep.\u201dHe didn\u2019t look at Bi Yaohua\u2019s expression any further. He just opened the door of the opposite room and entered without any expression on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The computer interface was still and no game was being played. It wasn\u2019t known what he was thinking.Jian Ye poked his head into the training room and was somewhat astonished when he didn\u2019t see Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cThe captain isn\u2019t here? Did he go out for some reason?\u201dBi Yaohua glanced at the time and couldn\u2019t help rubbing his temple from the excessive stimulation. \u201cHe should still be sleeping.\u201d\u201cSleeping?\u201d Gu Luo also looked over. As the little cutie who cared the most about Titans, he couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cDid he catch a cold after going out last night?\u201dThey had been with the team for so long that everyone was aware of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s work and rest habits. The fact that he wasn\u2019t awake yet was indeed a very abnormal phenomenon.Bi Yaohua was asked this and felt more pain from his head. Even though he usually talked a lot, he didn\u2019t have the habit of exposing people\u2019s privacy. He might be puzzled about the matter of \u2018when did the coach and captain get together?\u2019 but he didn\u2019t say anything. He paused before replying, \u201cHe should be pure, ly, sleep, ing, alone in his room.\u201dThe others found it strange but didn\u2019t ask much. They went to their respective positions to turn on the computers.Bi Yaohua noticed that Chen Yushen\u2019s face was darker than usual and investigated it. \u201cDid you not sleep well yesterday?\u201dChen Yushen replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay but I have a bit of a headache.\u201dBi Yaohua recalled the scene last night and laughed. \u201cIt seems that the amount of alcohol you can drink is really bad. Next time, I won\u2019t pull you when I\u2019m drinking.\u201dHearing this sentence, Chen Yushen stopped moving the mouse for a moment and looked up. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I can practice.\u201dBi Yaohua was stunned for a moment. He looked over the computer screen at Chen Yushen\u2019s expression. Then he couldn\u2019t help laughing, his colorful hair shaking. \u201cWhat is so good about practicing? It\u2019s better to practice your heroes. Want to line up as a pair?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dSoon, only the clicks of the mouse and the tapping of the keyboard were heard in the entire training room, mixed with some conversation from time to time. This was what Lin Yan saw when he pushed open the door.He looked at the backs that seemed to be training hard and didn\u2019t say anything. He walked to the side with his notebook and sat down blankly. He didn\u2019t hurry to turn on his phone or light a cigarette in his mouth. He just sank into the soft sofa and stared into the distance.He didn\u2019t drink much yesterday. Therefore, even though he was drunk, he didn\u2019t have much of a headache after waking up. The only problem was that he didn\u2019t remember much about the specifics, including how he came back last night.After waking up, Lin Yan tried hard to remember and finally had a few fragmented scenes in his mind. Still, just linking these incomplete scenes together was tragic enough. Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help cursing in his heart and almost snapped the cigarette in his mouth.He remembered that he forcibly grabbed Jing Yuanzhou in order to accompany him to sleep\u2026Lin Yan was silent for a moment before closing his eyes due to the pain from his head. Perhaps it was due to the sleeping posture he maintained last night but he felt like his whole body was twisted together. He cursed in his heart and couldn\u2019t help changing his sitting position.Bi Yaohua had just come out of a rankings game. He looked back and happened to see Lin Yan massaging his waist with both hands. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dSorry, he didn\u2019t want to imagine too much. The problem was that this scene really made it hard not to associate it with other things. Seeing that Lin Yan was about to look up, Bi Yaohua swiftly turned his head back and desperately started the next ranking game.Lin Yan didn\u2019t have any intention of starting training. After raising his head, he just stared at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s empty spot for a while. Then he lowered his head and opened the laptop he carried with him.The next match was the finals. Their opponent was the IBB team, a strong team in the secondary league. Unlike QU who was relatively steady, IBB\u2019s tactics had always been aggressive. The match might not have started yet but he could foresee the fierce collisions that would happen.Lin Yan had personal contact with this team in the previous entertainment match and this gave him more intuitive insights when it came to formulating strategies. Naturally, it was more comfortable.However, his attention was always on the empty space and he glanced up at the door from time to time. It was around 3 in the afternoon when Jing Yuanzhou came downstairs. Since he went back and had a good sleep, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s mental state was obviously much better than it was in the morning. He entered the door and happened to meet Lin Yan\u2019s gaze. He paused for a moment before wondering, \u201cYou woke up?\u201dLin Yan glanced at the time and gave a low cough. \u201cWhat time do you think it is?\u201dJing Yuanzhou replied quite sincerely, \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t sleep well last night and only woke up now.\u201dLin Yan guessed it was due to his own virtue last night. Now the candid tone entered his eyes and it seemed to be full of ridicule. He had to resist the urge to cover his face. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. In any case, today\u2019s training won\u2019t start until the evening.\u201dJing Yuanzhou observed Lin Yan\u2019s expression after entering the door. As he passed by the sofa, he abruptly stopped and his mouth twitched slightly. \u201cSpeaking of which, did you sleep well last night?\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help lowering his mouth at this knowing attitude. He controlled his guilty conscience and deliberately replied, \u201cI woke up and felt like my waist was about to break. Do you think it was comfortable?\u201dClatter.Bi Yaohua was playing a small-scale team battle when he heard this sentence. The hand holding the mouse slid uncontrollably to the side and directly knocked the water cup on the table to the ground.The cup rolled a few times before stopping against a chair. The ground was instantly wet.Bi Yaohua noticed the gazes of the two people as his screen turned dark because he was killed. He cleared his throat and said, \u201cSorry, my hand slid, my hand slid. Continue, continue!\u201dAfter this interruption, the conversation between the two of them didn\u2019t continue.For Jing Yuanzhou, last night was truly full of memories but they weren\u2019t necessarily wonderful memories. Apart from thinking about it a few times, it didn\u2019t have any special significance apart from wanting to catch this man to make him have a hard time.Jing Yuanzhou walked to his seat and sat down. His mouth slightly tightened before he opened it again. \u201cBy the way, don\u2019t order any more alcohol at team dinners in the future.\u201dLin Yan had originally lowered his head to continue watching the game video that was halfway through the analysis. He heard this and couldn\u2019t help lowering his head even further. He was silent for a moment before responding with a casual attitude, \u201cYes, no problem. This suggestion is good.\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze fell on the back of the man who seemed to be working hard and under the disguise of business. He couldn\u2019t control the expression on his face and smiled silently. Both of them had spoken and the other players of GH naturally couldn\u2019t express their opinions any further. Even Jian Ye could only bitterly agree.The afternoon was basically spent inside the training room. After dinner, the players officially started the targeted training against the IBB team.Lin Yan spent the afternoon completing the training schedule for the next few days. Now that it reached the final stage, the program\u2019s staff had cancelled all the daily live broadcast sections and this gave them more training time.Under Lin Yan\u2019s arrangement, all the time that could be squeezed out was squeezed to death. The plan was presented and it was obviously a devil\u2019s schedule. This training program lasted three days and continued until the afternoon before the live broadcast of the finals.Everyone still remembered the fact that the LARK team had entered the relegation list and missed the autumn competition. They sighed and completed all the training beautifully. During the training, there wasn\u2019t a single complete and all the members maintained the attitude of wanting to win the championship.Opportunities would never wait for people. If they missed this chance, no one knew what would be waiting for them later. The days of not seeing the sky passed in the blink of an eye.Everyone fell asleep early the day before the finals. Then the next morning, they set off early for the recording of the fateful finals. It was still the familiar lounge and the familiar stylist was doing the styling for them.All the GH players were forced to sit straight in the chair and couldn\u2019t move. This didn\u2019t affect the tapping of their fingertips on their phone screens.Based on what they experienced during this period of time, they had long been accustomed to the program who liked to do things from time to time. After they received the notice of today\u2019s recording process, they didn\u2019t need to look to know that there was a commotion on the Internet.Burning Hot Assembly was really serious when it came to doing things.No one imagined that the program would directly invite the LARK team who had just been eliminated after the mid-season competition. They even arranged a gimmicky warm-up match for the two teams about to go into the finals.It was good to have a warm-up against the game but it was completely different if the target of the warm-up was LARK. The Internet has long been full of smoke.[I\u2019m laughing. The program\u2019s staff is still awesome. Whose face are they trying to hit by doing this?][It is interesting. If LARK crushes the final two teams on the field, can the subsequent match be played?][I think LARK will definitely fight to the death today. It is revenge for seizing their spot!][Seriously, if the previous warm-up match is lost then the talent show itself has to be a joke!][Is this right? Isn\u2019t it funny if the promoted team can\u2019t beat the relegation team?][This variety show is probably the most ruthless one I have ever seen. It is ok to push yourself.][I want to know the psychological shadow of the Go Home team and IBB.][As I said, just have a good time. It is a variety show team. I really hope they can play well after entering the professional league.][Upstairs +1. This is indeed a matter of fun. It is boring if it is too real.][It doesn\u2019t matter if GH or IBB wins. It is just a variety show. Although it really would be embarrassing if they lose to LARK today.]\u201cI have to confess, just now, I want to thank the entire family of the director\u2019s group!\u201d In consideration of his hairstyle, Bi Yaohua was sitting upright like a statue but his hand was swiftly looking through the Weibo comments. \u201cNow the Internet is really looking forward to our two teams playing a good game with LARK? What are these things? Their imagination is really flourishing. We haven\u2019t played yet but they are all acting so high and mighty! What are they saying with their mouths? If the two teams lose today, it doesn\u2019t matter who loses or who wins the championship? It is bound to be the most unworthy relegation team in history? Bah, this group of people. Every time I do something, they are livelier than anyone else!\u201dLin Yan placed the schedule in front of him and seemed quite calm and he spoke in a quiet voice, \u201cIt\u2019s normal. Netizens don\u2019t care if we play BO5, BO3 or BO1. If we lose then we lose. After all, the winning team will take LARK\u2019s quota in the fall season. If we can\u2019t beat them then our skills aren\u2019t as good and we really have nothing to say. The only good news is that IBB is also facing this difficult test like us. If we lose and they win before we win the finals, the credibility of the promotion place can be slightly improved. Thinking about it this way, we have one extra chance. Can you be happy?\u201dChen Yushen had been silent. Now he whispered with an unhappy expression, \u201cNo.\u201dGu Luo also didn\u2019t want to play this match against LARK. He couldn\u2019t help asking tentatively, \u201cCoach, what do you think our chances of winning against LARK is based on our current strength?\u201dLin Yan thought about it for a while. \u201cIf you play normally, it is around 3:7?\u201dBi Yaohua was surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty good!\u201dLin Yan looked at him. \u201cI\u2019m talking about us 3, LARK 7.\u201dJian Ye coughed. He couldn\u2019t accept it. \u201cIs it so bad?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t bad. How long has LARK been established and how long have we been established? If we are given more time then it wouldn\u2019t be a problem to crush them. Unfortunately, the situation is like this.\u201d Then LIn Yan laughed. \u201cStill, I said that this is under normal playing conditions. Today isn\u2019t a BO3. One game will determine the outcome. I will make some arrangements for you on the field. If some tricks are used then I can probably increase the winning rate a bit. It will become us 7, them 3!\u201dBi Yaohua opened his mouth and wanted to complain.3:7 turned to 7:3. This difference could be called raising the winning rate a little bit?!Jing Yuanzhou opened a mineral water bottle and handed it to Lin Yan. Then he opened another bottle for himself and took a sip before calmly interrupting everyone\u2019s thoughts. \u201cIn any case, just win.\u201dLin Yan nodded and was very calm. \u201cYes, the championship is ours anyway.\u201dThe atmosphere in the lounge heated up.Meanwhile, the staff stylist beside them had just finished their work. The stylist managed to control the twitching and silently retreated. \u2018I have seen many teams in the industry over the years but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen someone so arrogant before the match even starts!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the way, they saw the members of the LARK team in the distance. Their poor performance during the mid-season meant there weren\u2019t too many smiles on their faces. The players might have received makeup but their tiredness was still visible to the naked eye. The GH players saw them and couldn\u2019t help sighing inwardly.Jing Yuanzhou wasn\u2019t familiar with the LARK members but there had been a few occasional meetings. Before the game started, he went over alone to greet them. The others went to the player seats that belonged to their team and waited for the show to start.They saw Jing Yuanzhou talking to the captain of the LARK team and their expressions were complicated. In fact, they really sympathized with the LARK team\u2019s experience. Then they thought about warming up against a relegation team of the professional league and immediately discounted this sympathy.Gu Luo couldn\u2019t help looking at the time again. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we started yet? If we don\u2019t start soon\u2026 I want to go to the bathroom again.\u201dChen Yushen told him, \u201cDon\u2019t run around. Just stay here.\u201dJian Ye also looked back at Gu Luo\u2019s face. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just go to the bathroom? You want to go again? I haven\u2019t seen you like this before. Why are you so nervous today?\u201dGu Luo replied in a dull voice, \u201cI\u2019m fine. In addition, Brother Gun, I don\u2019t believe you aren\u2019t nervous at all.\u201dJian Ye cleared his throat. \u201cAfter all, it is the finals. There is a bit of nervousness but it can be adjusted.\u201dGu Luo secretly rubbed his sweaty palms together before finally expressing his worries, \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s nothing. The main reason I\u2019m afraid is that what will the captain do if I don\u2019t play well? There is also Brother Trash Talk who is also from the professional league. It is bad enough that they have to accompany us to play this type of variety show competition. If we fail to win the championship\u2026 or even if we win the championship, if we lose to LARK and cause them to be ridiculed\u2026\u201dHe probably didn\u2019t dare think about it anymore and fell silent.Bi Yaohua, the incomparably wronged existence in Gu Luo\u2019s mouth was quite calm in contrast. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about it. It is fine as long as I have a place to play the game. If we can win then we will win. If we lose then I will find an opportunity to play in the secondary league. What is the big deal? This isn\u2019t to comfort you. It is just not as tragic as you said. It isn\u2019t as if there is no way out, Gloy.\u201dLin Yan was originally sitting to the side and finishing the tactics. He heard this and felt a bit unwilling to listen. \u201cWho is making trouble again? Where is the fighting spirit I gave you just now? Why are you thinking more and more when coming to the field? It is all the same. Just hit them hard. The idea of retreating isn\u2019t something you need to consider at all.\u201dHe gently tapped on the page with his fingers and laughed. \u201cIn addition, there is really nothing to consider. If you lose then you can do whatever you want. I\u2019m different! I am losing money. You don\u2019t know how expensive Titans is. It isn\u2019t as if there is no way out? What nonsense! I will make it so there is no way out! You better fight well or else\u2026 hehe, if I really lose my money then I will pack all of you one by one and sell you to the live broadcast platform.\u201dJing Yuanzhou heard his name without warning the moment he came back to the player seats. He looked down at Lin Yan and wondered, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me? Where are you going to sell me to?\u201dLin Yan hadn\u2019t expected this person to come back so quickly and couldn\u2019t help choking on the water he just delivered to his mouth. He quickly waved his hand. \u201cNo\u2026 cough, I didn\u2019t mean to sell you! I can afford your worth! Be quiet for me and don\u2019t think about going anywhere!\u201dGu Luo felt his worries disappearing and he finally laughed. \u201cYes! How can the coach be willing to sell you, Captain?\u201dBi Yaohua also joked, \u201cIt isn\u2019t like that. Captain is the coach\u2019s person. He isn\u2019t willing to sell you even if he sells all of us!\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t have the thoughts of these two people and simply agreed with the literal meaning. \u201cYes, Captain isn\u2019t the same as us!\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cI am no different. The contract is in the coach\u2019s hands. To sell or not sell depends on him.\u201dLin Yan ignored the words of these people. He saw Jing Yuanzhou sitting down next to him and abruptly changed the subject. \u201cYou chatter for a bit. How is LARK\u2019s state today?\u201d\u201cTheir state is pretty good.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou responded as he recalled the content of the conversation. \u201cAfter all, they suddenly fell to the relegation match and they are a bit unwilling. According to their words, they are prepared for a big fight in today\u2019s warm-up matches.\u201d\u201cOh, is the program effect going to explode?\u201d Lin Yan raised his eyebrow slightly. \u201cI thought that after your greeting, they would be much gentler to us on the field. I didn\u2019t expect them not to care about Titans\u2019s face?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cIt really isn\u2019t easy on the field.\u201dBi Yaohua listened to the conversation between the two of them and his mouth twitched. Then he snapped his fingers. \u201cYes, this warm-up match will probably be thoroughly heated. The program team looking for LARK is a really beautiful move!\u201dIn the distance, the players of IBB and LARK stepped into their respective zones under the guidance of the staff and started the final preparations for the warm-up match. GH was scheduled for the second match.Seeing that the two sides were ready, the GH members stopped talking and paid attention to the game. In any case, today was the finals and the scene of the recording was much better than before. Many of the fans present today were fans of the LARK team. As the commentators heated up the venue, the cheers of the supporters took over and they shouted the names of the players they supported.Gu Luo was amazed. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I would think this was LARK\u2019s home game!\u201dBi Yaohua smiled. \u201cThis is normal. Their team is coming here to help in warm-up matches. The fans feel unbalanced in their hearts and want to get back a bit of the momentum on the field. It is natural.\u201dLin Yan never said a word. His eyes were focused on the big screen.The BP section was underway. Once the lineup of both sides was confirmed, the expression in his eyes flickered and he made a meaningful \u2018oh\u2019 sound. \u201cSure enough\u2026\u201dThe warm-up match arranged by the program was really messy, especially the timing.IBB was in the same situation as GH. They naturally had reasons to win the warm-up match against LARK. However, LARK might be weak but it was still a professional league team. Without advance preparations, a secondary league team like IBB would find it really hard to deal with LARK. If they really wanted to go all out, they would expose their tactics before the official finals. Just as GH had been preparing for today, IBB must\u2019ve made sufficient preparations.LARK\u2019s emergence became the uncertainty that broke their rhythm. If they exposed their tactics in order to win the warm-up match, the losses would naturally outweigh the gains. However, if they simply abandoned the warm-up match, they would likely suffer ridicule even if they entered the professional league.They couldn\u2019t have both at the same time. The dilemma was if they should retreat first and bear it or fight unscrupulously.Lin Yan was curious about what decision IBB would make. Then once the lineup came out, he knew he had guessed correctly. Compared to a vague reputation, IBB chose to hold back their tactics and endure the humiliation.The first warm-up match officially began. The overall lineup for IBB was very regular and there didn\u2019t appear to be any bright spots.Meanwhile, the LARK team actively created various collisions on several lanes at the start of the game. They dared to fight. They didn\u2019t wait for the mid-stage and directly disrupted the rhythm of IBB. The economic gap started to widen hugely. However, IBB\u2019s lineup was stable. If they dragged it out to the later stages then there were some chances to reverse things.Brother Rabbit Hat was a commentator and he analyzed the pros and cons of the situation on the field to the audience.The atmosphere at the scene was tense. However, LARK didn\u2019t give IBB the opportunity to delay and survive. The game ended with a push to the high ground in the 30th minute. Seeing IBB\u2019s base crystal being smashed, Bi Yaohua covered his chest with sympathy. \u201cThis is a loss\u2026 I was counting on IBB but as expected, we have to rely on ourselves.\u201dLin Yan got up from his chair and clapped. \u201cIt\u2019s our turn. Let\u2019s go.\u201dLARK won the first warm-up match and the venue was a celebration of the fans. One after another, the shouts became higher than a wave. They called out the names of the LARK team neatly and uniformly, hitting the heart again and again. The venue was so exciting that it could be guessed how hot the discussion on the Internet was.It was only when they came to their zone and put on the soundproof headphones that the GH members finally felt the world was a bit quieter. Chen Yushen slowly breathed out and calmed his mood. \u201cIt\u2019s too noisy.\u201dIt was louder than Brother Trash Talk.Jing Yuanzhou adjusted the volume of the headphones and reminded them, \u201cDon\u2019t be affected by the environment. It will be noisier than this after entering the professional league.\u201dBi Yaohua tried the sensitivity of the mouse and sighed. \u201cStill, when we were playing, there were fans of both sides. What about today? Our team and IBB are clearly the protagonists? Isn\u2019t LARK being a bit too noisy?\u201dGu Luo nodded. \u201cIt is really unpleasant.\u201dJian Ye was relatively indifferent but once he heard his teammates\u2019 words, he followed up with a comforting sentence. \u201cSince you are unhappy, just pay them back on the field.\u201dLin Yan stood behind them with his notebook in hand. At this time, he connected to the voice channel and he naturally heard their words. He couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cForget everything else, your sense of territory is quite strong. Remember what you said and get it back later, you know?\u201d\u2019Everyone in GH responded in unison. \u201cYes!\u201dThe equipment check was complete and the second match started. It soon entered the BP section. The two sides quickly completed the ban selection under the guidance of their respective coaches. Looking around, it could be seen that they were all powerful heroes often banned in this version of the game.In the commentary area, the old friends of the show, Brother Rabbit Hat and Cry Cry were enthusiastically analyzing the situation of both parties.They were old professional commentators in this field. In the previous match, IBB finished the lineup selection and both of them saw that IBB was holding back. Therefore, they became curious about GH.\u201cI already said that IBB held back its tactics in a strategic move. Although they lost to the LARK team, it is making me look forward to their performance in the finals.\u201d Brother Rabbit Hat kindly helped explain for IBB before returning the field. \u201cAfter the last match, GH should have a lot less psychological pressure. I don\u2019t know if they will follow the same idea of holding back as IBB.\u201d\u201cIt can be seen that GH first chose Bi Yaohua\u2019s best assaulter, Jack. How do I feel that GH is ready for a big fight in the warm up match?\u201d Cry Cry looked at the information in her hands. \u201cAfter all, judging from the previous matches of the GH team, it seems no one can figure out the specific routines of their team. Oh yes, you can see that the coach of GH is standing behind the team on the screen. I am very much looking forward to whether GH can bring us any surprises today.\u201dBrother Rabbit Hat also agreed with this. \u201cI am also looking forward to it.\u201dAs they spoke, it could be seen that the two sides had locked onto their final lineup.\u201cThen let\u2019s look at the final arrangements made by the teams.\u201d Brother Rabbit Hat moved the topic back. \u201cOh? The LARK team actually got their best lineup? They might\u2019ve missed the autumn competition but anyone watching the mid-season can find that LARK played well in a few games with this lineup. GH actually let LARK use this set of tactics. It seems the coach is very confident in his team! So let\u2019s look at GH\u2019s countermeasures\u2026 er\u2026\u201dThe moment his eyes fell on the final pick of the GH team, the original torrent of words stopped.After so many years of professional commentary experience, it was the first time Brother Rabbit Hat was in a trance because he couldn\u2019t understand the situation. \u201c???\u201dWhat type of strange lineup was this?FreestarHis partner Cry Cry barely recovered her senses. \u201cHow can I say it? GH\u2019s lineup is really very\u2026\u201dAfter a pause, she finally found a relatively appropriate adjective. \u201cVery\u2026 original!\u201dLin Yan had just come back to the seats after finishing the lineup arrangement and he heard this sentence. He couldn\u2019t help raising his head and glancing in the direction of the commentary platform, his mouth curved in a subtle arc.Original? It was exactly what he wanted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 70": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 54Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment the lineups of both sides were locked, the audience more or less already had a subtle feeling that couldn\u2019t be said. Now that the commentators mentioned it, they immediately reacted.Under normal circumstances, the main outputs of the team should be the middle and bottom lanes, the two Cs. There weren\u2019t many teams like GH who played a melee killing style all year round. In addition, the support was good at safety. Basically, in order to ensure some safety during team battles, Titans on the side lane would often take a front row tank type when choosing heroes.In this round, forget the fact that the mid-laner Gloy maintained the same as before. Titans actually chose a semi-assassin type hero and even the assaulter Jack used by BB was an instant burst type. Add in the jungler and based on calculations, there were four assassins in the team.What would it be like to have four assassins on one side in a game? The answer was naturally: kill or be killed.The game had just started. The audience saw that the LARK team had chosen two fragile C-positions and their eyes were full of sympathy. Farewell. May there be no killing in Heaven.As the line of soldiers attacked, the opponents rushed out of the highlands. LARK couldn\u2019t see GH\u2019s movements but the audience could see it clearly. Apart from Bi Yaohua who arrived in his lane and started to gain economy, the other four rushed directly to LARK\u2019s jungle, silently like cats in the grass.After a few seconds, LARK\u2019s side-laner could be seen passing by, completely unaware of the opponents.In fact, it wasn\u2019t that LARK\u2019s side-laner wasn\u2019t careful enough. If the GH team wanted to invade the jungle then it would inevitably collide with LARK\u2019s side lane under such a route. It was just that there was an unprecedented time difference. The main reason was that Jian Ye didn\u2019t choose to learn healing skills at level 1 as before. Rather, he directly upgraded a group acceleration skill.It wasn\u2019t until LARK\u2019s side-laner finished killing the first wave of soldiers without seeing Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s figure that he had a bad feeling. This choice to retreat was sharp and simple but the four GH players who cleared the entire field had already rushed out of the blind spot behind him.Chen Yushen simply took away the first head on the field.[First Blood!]The sudden outburst of the first kills stunned the other LARK players.LARK\u2019s mid-laner glanced at the top lane and saw the four of them killing the soldiers there. He took advantage of the time when the mid-laner wasn\u2019t present to knock down some of the health of the defense tower. A professional player\u2019s grasp of the timing was fairly meticulous. He didn\u2019t mean to be too greedy and was planning to withdraw after a few hits.Unexpectedly, as soon as he turned his head, he collided with four figures emerging from the grass. The heart of LARK\u2019s mid-laner jumped. Then the skills of three assassins were used at the same time. The LARK player couldn\u2019t react at all and his health was instantly emptied. As for the ownership of the head, it was such a chaotic situation that it was almost like a lucky draw. It ended up with Gu Luo who had better luck.Looking at the darkened screen, LARK\u2019s mid-laner couldn\u2019t return to his senses for a long time. He clicked on the opposing lineup in a daze and looked again. Only then did he figure it out.The main reason for his time estimation just now was mainly because he ignored the displacement skills of the assassin heroes. These skills were usually normal but once combined with the acceleration of the support, the effect was simply like \u2018flying\u2019 once they started to wander around the map.LARK\u2019s mid-laner touched on the essence of GH\u2019s lineup and couldn\u2019t help feeling disgusted. He looked at his jungler who had half the jungle taken from the start and sighed in his heart. This start was a bit difficult\u2026Viewers with the god\u2019s perspective were fortunate enough to see GH \u2018fly\u2019 through the canyon.The second successful kill caused the audience to explode completely while the live broadcast channel was covered by a barrage of \u2018666.\u2019Commentator Brother Rabbit Hat was still amazed by the wonderful lineup for four assassins in GH but now he started to feel distressed for the LARK team. \u201cGH, this is just the start of the game and they have already broken up the deployment of the LARK team! The jungler\u2019s economy is a bit miserable now. He has lost half his jungle in the beginning and it is unrealistic for him to go to GH\u2019s jungle area. The biggest problem right now is how to get back their own rhythm. After all, the early outbreak of GH is too high. If they let the ganking continue like this, LARK will probably collapse soon.\u201dSuch a simple truth was naturally also known to the LARK team. However, the hardest thing was being able to do anything even if they knew. GH\u2019s full displacement lineup combined with the group acceleration meant they were simply like a gust of wind.In addition, Jian Ye directly abandoned increasing the amount of healing and at the beginning of the game, he used all his economy to synthesize a support acceleration device. This made the configuration even more insane.There were the acceleration skills combined with the equipment active skills bonuses\u2014what was the concept of acceleration after both were used simultaneously? The most accurate way to express it was that GH directly cleared the soldiers in the top lane and then ganked in the bottom lane. The time spent during this period was only around 5 seconds.Such mobility could no longer be described as \u2018flying\u2019. It was more like a group teleportation. It was almost impossible to guard against.By the time 10 minutes passed, the LARK team had been ganked four times in the top lane, three times in the middle lane and three times in the bottom lane. As for the jungler, he was even more tragic\u2026 GH seemed to like detouring down the side today so after he entered his own jungle, he had the experience of encountering their affection at the corner from time to time.The lethality of the assassins meant not a single move could be made. Even the tank type heroes with support equipment couldn\u2019t escape the fate of being killed in seconds, let alone the weak defense heroes.Lin Yan sat in the player seats and listened to the exclamations of the audience behind him. The corners of his mouth gradually rose with the complete collapse of the LARK team. As he said before, their odds of winning a BO3 might not be great but it wasn\u2019t difficult to win by surprise if it was just one game.This type of weird lineup was actually easy to be targeted. Their biggest advantage was that this system didn\u2019t leave enough room for LARK to react.Lin Yan didn\u2019t watch the gradually increasing gap on the big screen anymore. His eyes were fixed on a figure in the combat zone. Despite the surprising turn of events all around him, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s attitude was still calm. However, it was due to this person\u2019s precise command that this extreme operation could be done.From a bystander\u2019s point of view, the rhythm of LARK was already completely lost under the crazy gank that wandered the map. Only Lin Yan, the tactical strategist knew the drawbacks of this lineup better than anyone. If the commander himself lacked a field control ability then they would probably lose control first before the LARK team.He was willing to come up with this plan at this time precisely due to his trust in the captain\u2019s strength. It was clear that Jing Yuanzhou was almost perfect.The fragmented LARK team had lost its ability to group up and advance. In the end, it was crushed by GH. GH pushed to the high ground and to the base crystal.The outcome was decided.Lin Yan smiled slightly as he heard the cries of the audience. How should he put it\u2026 it was worthy of being the man he took a fancy to?The members of GH came back after finishing the game and the LARK fans in the venue were no longer as excited as they were in the beginning.Bi Yaohua was very satisfied with this. After raising his head and pouring some water into his mouth, he smiled and said, \u201cSure enough, e-sports still depends on strength. No matter what, this scene has returned to us. The feeling of the world being quiet is really great.\u201dGu Luo was also drinking water. He almost choked when he heard these words and raised his head in shock. \u201cIs it appropriate for you to say this?\u201dBi Yaohua reached out and shook his finger gently in front of Gu Luo. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand. People who make noise will never think they are noisy. If you don\u2019t believe it then you can try it.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. \u201cThank you, I don\u2019t want to try it.\u201dChen Yushen had been playing quite freely and now he whispered, \u201cNo matter what, we have blocked the mouths of those cursing us.\u201dHe finished speaking and the surroundings were quiet for a moment.Everyone clenched their fists and felt the desire to fight. Now there was only the match with IBB left.In any case, Jian Ye rarely used a healing support as a team accelerator like he had done just now. Everyone was happy but only he felt a bit uncomfortable. He sighed and couldn\u2019t help looking at the field in a curious manner, ready to move. \u201cThe warm-up games are over. When will the finals be played?\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at the two commentators who were standing on the stage and answered, \u201cIt should be after the LARK team leaves.\u201dLARK didn\u2019t leave after the match but was arranged by the staff to go to the center of the stage. The audience were presumably aware of what was going to happen and suddenly fell quiet. In particular, the fans of the LARK team couldn\u2019t help covering their eyes.LARK hadn\u2019t performed well in the mid-season competition and inevitably suffered a lot of attacks online. It was precisely due to this that they worked hard to show their strength in the two warm-up matches, wanting to win both.FreestarUnfortunately, they were caught off guard by GH\u2019s strange trick and lost a game. They were indeed a bit regretful but if they lost then they lost. There were no excuses, just like their unsatisfactory performance in the mid-season.AT this time, the captain of the LARK team took the microphone that Cry Cry handed over and the entire venue fell silent. There were a few minutes of silence before he spoke. He used this platform to express his guilt to all the fans who supported them.Throughout the speech, everyone listened carefully. At the end of all his words, the focus was the last sentence. \u201c\u2026LARK has let down your expectations this year. We are very sorry.\u201dThen all the LARK players stood in a row and faced the camera, bowing deeply. They maintained this 90 degree bow for a long time. The name of the LARK team started to be shouted. This time, no one complained about anything.After waiting a long time for the LARK team to leave the field, Jian Ye couldn\u2019t help sniffing. \u201cFuck, isn\u2019t the program\u2019s staff too poisonous? Doing this before the game\u2026 I am sad enough to cry!\u201dBi Yaohua glanced at him with disbelief. \u201cNo, why are you so emotionally delicate?\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t answer. His mouth twitched and he raised a leg to give this person an unreserved kick.Lin Yan watched the team arguing in an amused manner. Then he noticed that Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze was still on the passage backstage. He leaned over and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you infected by this kid?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou heard his question and smiled faintly. \u201cI was thinking what my retirement scene will be like.\u201dLin Yan hadn\u2019t expected to hear such a sentence and couldn\u2019t help freezing for a moment.Then he slowly elongated his tone. \u201cI really don\u2019t know this but one thing is for certain. It won\u2019t be as tragic as it is now. At least when you retire, it will definitely be with the trophy of the world championship.The look in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes slightly froze. He turned his head and met Lin Yan\u2019s eyes. After a pause, he laughed in a good mood. \u201cListening to your words, it suddenly feels quite good?\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help handing over a bottle of water to block this person\u2019s no good words. \u201cForget this first! I spent so much money to buy you and you want to retire now? The finals will be coming soon. Quickly moisten your throat and don\u2019t think about anything else.\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled and took a sip. \u201cYes, this water is good.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Staff members indicated for the two sides to enter their areas to make final preparations. Since the GH team won the previous warm-up match, the original smell of gunpowder in the venue had somewhat lightened.After all, it didn\u2019t matter which of the two teams won the finals. At least they didn\u2019t have to bear the infamy of being unfit for the professional league. It was a happy ending for all.The two teams had previously played against each other in the entertainment game. The people of GH were slightly less in awe of IBB being the opponents in the finals. From their current state of mind, it seemed to be easier than playing the previous warm-up game.The commentator Brother Rabbit Hat was obviously still immersed in the previous game against LARK. \u201cI have to say that the routine used by GH just now was exquisite and other teams should learn from it. Forget LARK, even if another professional team faced it then they might not be able to find a good response in a short period of time.\u201dCommentator Cry Cry added, \u201cI am now more curious about what the IBB coaching staff is thinking after watching the game just now. I suddenly look forward to GH using the lineup just now again. It always feels quite interesting.\u201d\u201cThen it depends on whether IBB lets it go or not.\u201d Brother Rabbit Hat smiled and brought the content of the dialogue back to the field very professionally. \u201cOkay, the BP process for the first game has officially started. Let me take a look at the BAN selection for both sides. Wait a minute! Why did I feel that the banned lineup of heroes on the GH team\u2019s side looks a bit\u2026 familiar?\u201dThe audience hadn\u2019t noticed it and were immediately happy when they heard these words. It was more than deja vu. This was obviously the same banned lineup from the last game against LARK! A lot of people couldn\u2019t help discussing it.\u201cThey are banned in every game. Do these heroes restrain GH\u2019s tactics so much?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m more concerned about whether GH is going to use the same routine again?\u201d\u201cTwo games in a row is easy to target, right? I actually want to see how this lineup can be targeted.\u201d\u201cGH exposed it too early! If I was IBB\u2019s coach, I would directly ban the core of this lineup!\u201d\u201cI wonder if GH hasn\u2019t prepared any other tactics? They used it directly when playing against LARK. Now won\u2019t the effect be reduced against IBB?\u201d\u201cIt is either the Go Home team sending others home or they go home on their own. The early exposure of tactics was done by GH itself. Look!\u201d\u201cStill, this lineup is very cool to play. My blood was boiling from the game just now.\u201d\u201cI agree. It doesn\u2019t matter if they do it again. In any case, it looks good!\u201dAt this time, IBB hadn\u2019t used its last banned position and IBB\u2019s coach seemed very hesitant. Time passed and he still didn\u2019t take any action. Bi Yaohua was eager for a big fight so he couldn\u2019t help frowning when he saw this. \u201cWhat is the coach of IBB doing? Is he constipated on the spot?\u201dGu Luo groaned in pain. \u201cBrother Trash Talk, stop talking. I drank a lot of water just now and I\u2019m afraid I will really need to go to the bathroom.\u201dBi Yaohua was choked up. \u201cHow many times have you been to the bathroom today?\u201dGu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLin Yan\u2019s gaze skimmed over the huge field and stayed on the frowning eyebrows of IBB\u2019s coach. Then the corners of his mouth curved up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I dug a hole here. They are just hesitating over whether to jump in or not! I don\u2019t blame them. It is really difficult to choose so be patient.\u201dThe moment he spoke, IBB made their choice in the last few seconds. Lin Yan saw the banned hero that appeared on the screen and almost laughed. \u201cThey jumped beautifully!\u201dEveryone in GH was stunned when they saw IBB\u2019s last banned hero. Jian Ye was the one who was most at a loss. \u201cWhy are they banning my support hero?\u201dJing Yuanzhou gave a low laugh. \u201cMainly because the coach has excellent chess skills.\u201dThe others momentarily had minds full of questions. What did this have to do with chess? It wasn\u2019t until they saw the banned lineups on both sides several times that they reacted and gave a thumbs up to Lin Yan. \u201cCoach, your heart is still the dirtiest!\u201dIt was really superb chess skills. Their coach played a big game of chess!Originally, the lineup against LARK in the previous game was entirely based on Lin Yan\u2019s temporary intentions. Although the BP tactics used against different teams couldn\u2019t always be interlinked, Lin Yan had full confidence in his set of tactics. He didn\u2019t deeply study LARK\u2019s system so he simply applied the banning strategy he had prepared to fight IBB.At that time, the GH players hadn\u2019t thought too much about it. They thought their coach was just lazy. It was only at this moment that they found the coach had dug a hole in advance and was waiting for IBB to jump in on their own.After all, the game just now with LARK was too thrilling. IBB had watched the entire process. Then the exact same banned lineup appeared suddenly, reminding that the GH was preparing to follow the same tactics. It was hard not to think too much.There was LARK\u2019s terrible ending and IBB\u2019s coach naturally couldn\u2019t take it lightly. As a result, the original layout they prepared for GH was completely disrupted. It could only be said that it was worthy of engaging in tactics. The psychological games were simple one after another. Who would\u2019ve thought that starting from the BP process in the previous game that Coach Lin had already started to work step by step?Now IBB\u2019s coach was caught. A banned position was wasted on a support hero that Jian Ye wasn\u2019t planning to choose. At the same time, they naturally had to release another hero.Lin Yan successfully set up IBB. Regardless of the cheers of the team members, he took Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s famous hero first\u2014the death wanderer.At this point, the image on the big screen locked onto IBB\u2019s zone. The moment Lin Yan locked onto the hero, the coach\u2019s face turned completely green. Originally, if this banned position hadn\u2019t been wasted on the healing support then the death wanderer would be the last banned hero.Anyone who paid attention to the professional league knew how scary two specific heroes were after being taken by Jing Yuanzhou. One of the heroes was the side lank tank with damage. The death wanderer had now fallen into GH\u2019s hands.Once this hero was selected, it wasn\u2019t just the venue. Even the barrage of the live broadcast room was completely crazy.[Fuck, I want to know what IBB is thinking. Don\u2019t they want to win? They actually released Titans\u2019 death wanderer?][Putting everything else aside, IBB\u2019s courage is something I admire.][It\u2019s time to play the war song. Just~ for the pain of love and attachment~ for the hurt of hate and persistence~][Haha, the sister in front, why do you make such sounds? Continue~ my shaking hands can\u2019t stop~ I can\u2019t forgive~][Didn\u2019t IBB do their homework ahead of time? Isn\u2019t it common knowledge to ban Titans\u2019 death wanderer?][I feel like the coach has become completely dizzy from the previous warm-up match.][It is cold, cold as soon as the game starts.][Isn\u2019t this bragging too much? Isn\u2019t it just letting out a hero? Is Titans strong enough to beat five?][At first glance, the previous person is too young. Haven\u2019t you seen the previous world games? It is really one-against-five.][Really one-against-five\u2026 there are also highlights on the website. It isn\u2019t ordinary one-against-five but one-against-five in the World Competition.][Don\u2019t mention it, I will cry when mentioning the past. The best Titans in the world is actually playing this type of game here.][Oh, what do you mean by playing this type of game? Your Titans is so noble that he doesn\u2019t want tickets to the professional league?]At this point, the entire BP process had been completed. Lin Yan gently patted Jing Yuanzhou on the shoulder before leaving. \u201cThis is all I can do for you. It is up to you.\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t look back and just raised his hand in an \u2018ok\u2019 gesture. \u201cDon\u2019t worry and leave it to me.\u201dHis tone was very calm. Once the first game officially began, he still maintained this calm attitude and opened the slaughter that belonged to Titans.Unknowingly, all the disputes and ridicule on the Internet finally fell completely quiet in the face of this excessively cruel killing figure. Only the opponents who came into contact with it on the field knew how terrifying Titans\u2019 death wanderer was.In addition to this hero, there was another one called titan. Therefore, all the teams that played against BK wouldn\u2019t be stingy with two banning positions. They used them on this man without exception. Such an approach naturally had a reason. It was because he was too strong so they were afraid.However, it was precisely because they were banned by the opponent in every game that Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t used the two heroes on the field in a long time. As a result, some people gradually forgot the fear of being dominated by the death wanderer.Now, the figure standing on the big screen was once again sounding the alarm to everyone. The death wanderer who was once equated with Titans\u2019 ID, once it attacked, the corpses were all over the place.In the game, Jing Yuanzhou got 15 heads and 8 assists. He was undoubtedly the MVP. At this time, regardless of whether it was the commentators or the audience, everyone saw the shocking statistics on the big screen and couldn\u2019t recover for a long time.One game of the finals was over and GH had won with a complete crushing.From a distance, they could see the figure standing up in the GH zone. On the screen, they saw Jing Yuanzhou smile softly before saying something quietly.By this time, everyone had already taken off their soundproof headphones. Naturally, this sentence wasn\u2019t broadcasted but it clearly fell into the ears of Chen Yushen sitting next to him. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice sounded somewhat emotional. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve used the death wanderer. As expected, it is still a bit out of practice.\u201dTL Note: I made a small change to the last chapter since I feel that my original words could be a bit misleading. The line \u2018it was worthy of being the man he liked?\u2019 has been changed to \u2018it was worthy of being the man he took a fancy to?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The entire scene was filled with the shouts of the audience.Back at the bench, Bi Yaohua let out a long sigh. \u201cYes, this is the feeling of the home field! Do you hear that? There are so many people calling my name BB. As expected, my popularity is as high as ever!\u201dChen Yushen was originally shocked by the captain\u2019s last words. He only came back to his senses after hearing this and he couldn\u2019t help giving a reminder. \u201cBut Brother Trash Talk, they are shouting\u2026 BB dog son.\u201dBi Yaohua glanced at him in a puzzled manner. \u201cIsn\u2019t it all me? Is there a difference?\u201d\u201c\u2026No difference.\u201dAmong everything else, Bi Yaohua\u2019s black fans were indeed quite excited. These people\u2019s fighting power was very high compared to other normal fans. Wave by wave, they gradually started a big chorus.In desperation, the director could only control the live sound effect and switch the camera to the two commentators. The two commentators took advantage of the rest time to review the highlights of the previous game. Unsurprisingly, all the bright moments were of Jing Yuanzhou.Gu Luo took advantage of this pause to go to the bathroom. Lin Yan didn\u2019t stop him and instead reminded him to \u2018go early and return early\u2019. Then he focused all his attention on his notebook again.Jing Yuanzhou sat down to drink water. He glanced sideways at this serious expression and leaned over slightly. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201dThe players played the game on the field while the initial BP process was the coach\u2019s battlefield. These few short minutes determined if he could fight for the most beneficial environment for his team.Lin Yan didn\u2019t even raise his head as he replied, \u201cNo, I just feel that I am forcing IBB\u2019s coach to be a bit anxious.\u201dHearing this, people might think this person had a rare sense of compassion. Then he paused and continued, \u201cSo I want to see if I can continue playing his mentality in the next game.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had just taken a sip of water and hadn\u2019t swallowed it. At this time, he was careless and suddenly choked. He coughed a few times before giving a low laugh. He held back his last laughter at Lin Yan\u2019s stareOnce Gu Luo came back from the bathroom, he was greeted by the staff to go and make preparations. The short rest time was over and everyone was ready to start the second game.Due to the obvious mistakes made by IBB\u2019s coach in the first game, the BP process for this game attracted attention. Soon, all of IBB\u2019s bans were officially locked in. Two ban positions were undoubtedly given to Jing Yuanzhou and the last one was still reserved for the healing support GH had used in the game against LARK.The commentator Brother Rabbit Hat laughed. \u201cIt seems that GH\u2019s warm-up match really left a deep impression on the IBB team. They have obviously made up their minds not to let GH use the same lineup today.\u201dCommentator Cry Cry nodded. \u201cIn fact, it is understandable. Before they are able to find a better coping strategy, the best way is to cut off the possibility of the lineup appearing. IBB\u2019s ban positions are within my expectations. On the contrary, it is unexpected that GH would give two bans to a shooter.\u201dThis time, the big screen cut to Lin Yan. There was his usual smile on his face as he opened his lips to talk. It was unknown what he was saying. The lineup selection of the two sides proceeded in an ordinary manner until GH locked onto their third and fourth heroes. Then IBB paused on the final two choices.\u201cIBB\u2019s coach has constipation every time\u2026\u201d Bi Yaohua complained. He couldn\u2019t help tilting his head and asking curiously, \u201cCoach, what do you think IBB will take?\u201dLin Yan replied without hesitation, \u201cForest witch and holy light elk.\u201dHe just finished speaking when IBB officially locked onto the heroes. It was indeed the two heroes Lin Yan mentioned, the forest witch and holy light elk. So far, from IBB\u2019s first hero to their last one, the lineup was exactly the same as Lin Yan predicted.Jian Ye couldn\u2019t help admiring him. \u201cCoach, it\u2019s crazy. You actually guessed the entire lineup. Are you a prophet?\u201dEven the referee who was listening to their voice chat couldn\u2019t help being amazed.Lin Yan\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. \u201cIt isn\u2019t surprising.\u201dNo matter whether it was the banning or selection, every step he made was to drive a wedge in the most uncomfortable position of the IBB lineup. The coach of IBB had to consider the team members in the layout so he had no choice but to follow Lin Yan\u2019s guidance.Lin Yan raised his head to look at IBB\u2019s zone. He could see that the coach had a somewhat \u2018nothing left to live for\u2019 expression. Yes, this was a familiar look.The BP process was over and the second game officially began. Everyone recovered from their shock at Lin Yan, the immortal of the BP process, and seriously devoted their attention to the game. They might have been crushed in the last game but it could be seen that the mentality of IBB\u2019s players had indeed been adjusted well.The moment the game started, the two sides started a very active battle in the jungle. There was a wave of testing without any heads given. Then they returned to their own areas to develop separately.Five minutes into the game, the two sides collided head-on in the canyon monster area. Obviously, no one wanted to miss the team experience and buff given from killing the buff. There was a long standoff but no team chose to give in early.In the end, GH took away three of the opponent\u2019s heads and lost two. Fortunately, the most powerful boss buff fell on their heads and it was a small profit. As one of the ones who had tragically died, Bi Yaohua lay on the ground waiting for the resurrection time and couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cIBB\u2019s state has been adjusted very quickly. They are so active in this round. Look at them just now. That brutal and violent appearance is like they really want to win.\u201d\u201cBrother Trash Talk, who doesn\u2019t want to win?\u201d Jian Ye was preparing to follow Chen Yushen to the other side\u2019s jungle. He casually restored some health while not forgetting to give a signal to Gu Luo on the lane. \u201cThe people from IBB didn\u2019t come to the jungle. I think that they are ready to go to your lane. Pay attention.\u201dAfter hearing Gu Luo\u2019s response, Jian Ye continued to appease Bi Yaohua. \u201cStill, don\u2019t worry. Didn\u2019t the coach remind us to endure the pressure in the early stage? Put up with it and it will be over. After 20 minutes, everything will be fine.\u201dBi Yaohua glanced at the current game time and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cGod, everything will be fine? Wait 20 minutes? It isn\u2019t even 10 minutes right now!\u201dHowever, he was just using words to feel refreshed. The moment he resurrected, he hurried down to the lane quickly. He saw a wave of soldiers arriving at the tower and quickly used his transmission skill to directly fly over. For every shooter, wasting a soldier\u2019s economy was a real sin.JIng Yuanzhou glanced at the current economic situation of the two sides and spoke quietly, \u201cGloy and Abyss should go to the bottom lane to support more. I can handle this place myself.\u201dThey had been training together for so long that the others in GH immediately understood. \u201cReceived!\u201dObviously, their captain was ready to block the economic line in the upper half of the field. From the audience\u2019s perspective, it could be found that GH\u2019s main area of activity was compressed to the lower half of the map.IBB\u2019s shooter was able to enjoy VIP treatment and receive the opponent\u2019s special care.The bottom laner first received GH\u2019s jungler. After the jungler came, he saw the mid-laner. Soon after the mid-laner came, he saw the jungler again\u2026 sometimes GH even gathered four people directly to form a mahjong table.During this period, those who could cross the tower would definitely be killed. However, if they saw the other IBB team members waiting, then GH would definitely turn around and leave without hesitation. No matter how turbulent, their retreat was straightforward.This was what Lin Yan had taught them during the training period. The main point during the weak period of their lineup wasn\u2019t to complete more kills. It was to disrupt the opponent\u2019s rhythm as much as possible. It was clear that under such frequent harassment, the original stable development rhythm of IBB had unknowingly fallen into chaos.During this whole process, Jing Yuanzhou had been in his lane without saying a word and had knocked down half the health of one of IBB\u2019s towers.Commentator Brother Rabbit Hat saw it and shook his head. \u201cThe impact of the first game on IBB is too great. I can understand their fear of Titans but by deliberately avoiding contact with the top lane, they allowed such an ace player to develop alone. It really isn\u2019t a good choice.\u201d\u201cThere is always the feeling that IBB\u2019s coach was confused by GH\u2019s continuous tricks and there is a problem with the layout itself.\u201d Commentator Cry Cry sighed. \u201cThe first 20 minutes of the game should\u2019ve been the strong period of IBB\u2019s lineup. If they were tough then it would probably have a good effect. However, 20 minutes have passed and the advantage of the lineup is about to gradually weaken.\u201d\u201cThe important thing is that Titans is really too well developed.\u201d Commentator Brother Rabbit Hat looked at the current economy on the field. \u201cWhile the bottom half is all tangled up, Titans has basically controlled the top half of the map from the economy, the soldiers and the entire jungle of IBB. Based on the current equipment situation, the moment he joins a team battle then IBB\u2019s lineup will probably explode instantly.\u201dCommentator Cry Cry thought about it. \u201cThen what if IBB tries to avoid team battles\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is difficult.\u201d Brother Rabbit Hat analyzed it objectively. \u201cGH\u2019s harassment tactics are very effective. IBB\u2019s shooter is at the core of their tactics and the current development is a bit miserable, not to mention that GH doesn\u2019t give them a chance to catch them. In other words, IBB needs to protect their shooter in order for him to develop as soon as possible. This is a very serious problem.\u201dHe paused slightly before continuing, \u201cWe can only see if IBB can take advantage of the last moment before the strongest period of GH\u2019s lineup.\u201dIt was clear that although he didn\u2019t express his position, he didn\u2019t quite understand IBB\u2019s performance today. Based on the situation of several episodes, he thought that both teams had a chance to become the final champions today. He didn\u2019t expect it to be such a crushing situation on the field. Most critically, no one knew where the problem lay.By the end of the second game, IBB failed to find a chance to counterattack and GH destroyed their base crystal.2:0!The match point belonged to the GH team! It was an instant sea of cheers for GH\u2019s supporters regardless of whether it was live at the venue or in the live broadcast room.[Ahhh, the Go Home team send them home!][Zero seal! Give me a zero seal! Win the championship in one go!][I seem to see the hope of 3:0.][Fuck, it\u2019s strong, really strong!][Don\u2019t say anything else, the rhythm of this game was really good.][Titans is too strong. There is no doubt he is a pillar of the team!][I\u2019m in tears. They\u2019re coming. They\u2019re really going to enter the professional league.][Titans, we will always wait for you to come back!][Go Home team, rush! Send IBB home!!!]On the other side, the long-time IBB fans fell silent. They saw on the screen the IBB players returning to the bench to rest with frustrated expression and couldn\u2019t help being in a trance. Were they really too confident before?However, IBB was clearly a team that had reached the top of the secondary league\u2026Was it true that GH, a new team, was actually strong enough to stand in the professional league?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When our Coach Lin plays tactics, he also plays with others\u2019 mentality. I really admire it.\u201dLin Yan glanced at him with a smile. \u201cI will tell you in advance. The post-match announcements that I asked Luo Mo to prepare are all arranged according to 3:0. There might be backup plans but regardless of the momentum or fighting, it is obviously not comparable with a zero seal. So give me a good third game! I\u2019ve done so much with IBB\u2019s mentality previously. If you lose a game at this critical moment then hehe, after you go back, I will make your mentality explode.\u201dBi Yaohua cried towards Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cCaptain, the coach is threatening us.\u201dJing Yuanzhou responded quietly, \u201cI think the coach is right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Bi Yaohua\u2019s mouth twitched and he almost blurted out the words \u2018villains colluding together\u2019. Finally, he could only let out a low sigh. \u201cWe will be sure to play well. The celebration party must\u2019ve been arranged, right?\u201dLin Yan had always been generous about such things. \u201cLuo Mo has arranged it a long time ago. It is a high-end club near the base. I guarantee you won\u2019t want to come out after you enter.\u201dJian Ye originally had his eyes closed to keep sharp. He heard these words and suddenly felt energetic. \u201cWhat are you waiting for? Hurry up!\u201dGu Luo noticed the gazes cast at them from the audience in the back and cleared his throat in a low manner. \u201c\u2026Brother Gun, should we be more reserved?\u201dThe 10 minute break soon passed and everyone returned to their zone.Lin Yan put on his headphones and suddenly brought the mike to his mouth. \u201cIt is the third game of the BO5.\u201dThe others didn\u2019t know why he was suddenly bringing this up.Before anyone could ask, Lin Yan continued speaking. \u201cEveryone knows that our team hasn\u2019t experienced any competitions in Internet cafes or the secondary league before participating in the show. As early as a few episodes ago, almost all online and offline voices were questioning us. Although these voices have dissipated a lot under everyone\u2019s excellent performance, the label of third-rate team is still firmly on us.\u201dThere was silence in the voice channel, leaving only Lin Yan\u2019s voice. \u201cGH\u2019s name is Go Home. From the very beginning, it is to send the opponent home. The current game depends on whether you can successfully send IBB back. If you succeed, the 3:0 record will make your ticket to the professional league shine. If you fail\u2026 cough, there is one more game! In short, this road is yours. Use your strength to make the entire e-sports league notice the GH team!\u201dAt this point, a smile appeared on his face. \u201cOne hour! One hour later, I hope that when everyone talks about it, they can put extra words in front of our club\u2014professional team, GH.\u201dEveryone\u2019s expressions were different. Some were moved while others had fighting spirit in their eyes.The referee who heard everything couldn\u2019t help his mouth twitching. Encouragement was encouragement but they were now confidently planning a zero seal match. Did the IBB team members know this? Too arrogant!Soon, the BP process officially began. It could be seen that IBB\u2019s lineup was much firmer than it was in the first two games. Lin Yan raised his eyes in surprise. \u201cOh, it seems that the coach of IBB has finally turned the corner. This team is okay. Their mentality adjustment is fast!\u201dThe battle lineup of both sides was displayed on the big screen in the blink of an eye. This time, there weren\u2019t as many twists as before. Both sides came up with the best configuration that could be taken out on the field according to the situation of their teams. IBB had lost two games in a row and ceased to be as timid as before. Once a strong lineup was presented, they were obviously ready to fight.FreestarLin Yan left the competition zone without being greatly affected by IBB\u2019s fighting spirit. In his opinion, this game was just a return to the real competition between players after the tactical match. If it came to personal strength, every player on the GH team didn\u2019t lose to anyone, whether it was a god-level player like Jing Yuanzhou to an inexperienced rookie like Gu Luo. The coach could only give technical support tactically. After that, everything was given to the captain Jing Yuanzhou.The third game officially started as everyone felt expectant. In the beginning, Jian Ye went to the middle to help Gu Luo clear the soldiers quickly while Chen Yushen went to IBB\u2019s jungle to cause trouble.However, after waiting in the grass for a while, he didn\u2019t see the player on the other side for a long time and felt it was a bit strange. He frowned slightly and was about to remind his team members to pay attention when he saw several figures suddenly rushing out of the grass.It was completely different from their previous fear. The target of their ambush this time was Jing Yuanzhou who was clearing the line of soldiers on the lane. No one thought that IBB would suddenly let go of themselves in the third game.He didn\u2019t have time to clean up the first wave of soldiers and had only upgraded one skill. It had just been used to kill soldiers and was on cooldown. Facing the three people who suddenly appeared, he could only use his displacement keenly to avoid a few control skills. Even so, he inevitably suffered a wave of damage.Finally, he used flash to escape back to the defense tower with some health left. This was already regarded as the result of an extreme operation.Even if he did his best, he wasn\u2019t able to defend the second wave of soldiers from the efforts of several people to suppress the tower. He saw that Chen Yushen and Jian Ye had completed the encirclement and confidently handed over the battlefield to his teammates, choosing to return to the city.His development was inevitably suppressed.Bi Yaohua looked up and saw the scene at the top of the map. He was taken back for a while. \u201cWhat is the matter with IBB? They were so miserable in the first two games. After suffering on the bottom lane, have they started to retaliate against the top lane?\u201dIn the beginning when they were level one, three people worked together in a group and went directly to the tower to kill. No one would believe it wasn\u2019t intentional. Jing Yuanzhou returned to the city to recover his health before continuing to clear the lane.He looked at the current economic situation of both sides and made a simple decision. \u201cBB, hurry up and develop. This game depends on who is tougher between you and the opposite side\u2019s shooter.\u201dThe GH players were long used to taking turns to be the C. Bi Yaohua liked being viewed as the core figure and was immediately happy. \u201cRest assured and give it to Brother Trash Talk!\u201dDue to this gank that came without warning, Jing Yuanzhou was affected as soon as the game started. The economic gap with the opposite player widened greatly.It was estimated that any other side lane player would\u2019ve probably started to collapse but Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s personal strength was really tough. He used the existing equipment gap and gradually reduced the disadvantageSeeing that he showed signs of developing again, IBB\u2019s jungler and support started to wander frequently again. They went to the top lane from time to time to take the head of a soldier, showing a lot of meaning.The situation was like a scene from the last game except that the identities of both sides were replaced at one point. The few people from IBB were harassing the lane like this but they turned and ran without hesitation when Chen Yushen brought Jian Ye over. Perhaps they suffered too much from this during the last game and wanted to return it to GH.Jian Ye saw it and gritted his teeth. \u201cForget anything else, they are really quick to steal from the teacher!\u201dChen Yushen had a lot of patience as a jungler. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We will ambush them a few more times.\u201dSoon, the situation on the field had developed into a game of guerrilla and counter-guerilla. It had to be said that IBB\u2019s style was both aggressive and conservative. The jungler\u2019s pace was surprisingly good.After several small waves of friction in the canyon, GH couldn\u2019t gain an advantage. There was another wave of small-scale team battles and both sides exchanged two heads.Bi Yaohua lay on the ground after being killed again and sighed. \u201cGloy, come quicker next time! In the last few waves, I always feel that you have been a step slower. Have you forgotten to save your displacement skills? Remember to leave one in advance. Look at those who ran away. They were all supposed to be yours! Don\u2019t waste it!\u201dIt was quiet for a moment before Gu Luo replied in a low voice. \u201cYes, I know Brother Trash Talk.\u201dThis voice fell into his ears and he felt strange. Bi Yaohua instinctively wanted to turn his head when he saw that he had resurrected again. He immediately operated his character to return to the lane. As he walked, he didn\u2019t forget to remind his teammates. \u201cAbyss, in the next team battle, I have to trouble you to help me cut the opposite mid-laner first. He is too annoying to control!\u201dChen Yushen replied, \u201cReceived.\u201dThe first few waves of team battles were a test. IBB obviously gained more confidence. They changed from their fearful state in the first two games and became vigorous. The overlord of the canyon refreshed and the two sides quickly started fighting around the river. At this point, the final ownership of the team buff was likely to be a crucial turning point.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s economy might\u2019ve somewhat been affected during this period but fortunately for GH, their shooter Bi Yaohua was well-equipped and had high output. Absolute output was a crucial factor in team battles so even if there was a head-on conflict, everyone in GH didn\u2019t have much worry. They just needed to protect their C, the shooter, and they would have a great chance of winning.Jian Ye needed to watch the health from the front row so the important task of protecting the back row was handed over to Gu Luo. After repeated tests by both sides, the team battle finally exploded.IBB\u2019s performance was as positive as before and they were very decisive in finding an opportunity to take the lead. Jian Ye quickly restored health and continued to ensure that Jing Yuanzhou in the front row survived.Minutes later, it was possible to see Jing Yuanzhou avoiding a series of skill damage due to this movement position. Then he flashed to the rear and directly hit the surrounding three people. It was a perfect entry.\u201cPretty!\u201d Chen Yushen couldn\u2019t help praising. He saw the opportunity to cut into the battle to instantly kill the opponent\u2019s mid-laner. It was just a pity that it was a 0.1 second difference and the group control skill was cast before the mid-laner died. Flames fell, cutting off the retreat of the two people in front.IBB\u2019s side-laner was also entangled and the support quickly followed up. In the back, the shooter took advantage of this to restore the distance and took away Chen Yushen\u2019s head. The remaining people continued to act to try and keep Jing Yuanzhou behind.Jian Ye controlled it to the limit and restored Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s health and mana at high speed. At the same time, Bi Yaohua and Gu Luo were frantically outputting from the rear. The amount of health being lost was extremely shocking.In such a fierce situation, the audience couldn\u2019t help holding their breaths and they didn\u2019t dare look away for a moment.IBB\u2019s support tried hard to block the output of the two C positions of GH. By the time Jing Yuanzhou was finally killed, there was only a weak defense hero with a bit of health left in IBB\u2019s front row.Bi Yaohua kept outputting and he saw that the final harvest was about to be completed when a figure appeared on the grass diagonally behind him without warning. The timing of IBB\u2019s jungler was so clever that Bi Yaohua\u2019s heart jumped and he shouted, \u201cGloy!\u201dUnfortunately, he was a step slower. IBB\u2019s jungler completed the assassination before Gu Luo\u2019s move was completed. Although he paid for it with his life, IBB\u2019s shooter survived and unsurprisingly cleaned up the field. At the same time, the IBB accepted the vital overlord buff.The moment the message about the group destruction popped up, GH\u2019s voice channel was quiet for a moment.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s calm voice was heard. \u201cGloy, are you not feeling well?\u201dEverything had happened too fast just now but he died early and watched the entire process. It was obvious that Gu Luo\u2019s reaction was indeed slow by 0.5 seconds. Jing Yuanzhou was sitting on the far side and couldn\u2019t see Gu Luo\u2019s specific situation. He could only choose to ask.The moment he spoke, the others recalled what happened just now and finally realized something was wrong. \u201cGloy, are you okay?\u201dThe lighting at the scene wasn\u2019t too clear but even so, it couldn\u2019t hide Gu Luo\u2019s slightly white face. Unlike when he first came to the field, there was sweat dripping from his hair and his lips were tight.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I couldn\u2019t maintain the best condition\u2026\u201d Gu Luo took a deep breath before speaking slowly. \u201cIf you want to criticize me then wait until the game is over. You can scold me however you like but please finish the game first!\u201dThe teenager\u2019s voice was soft but full of unparalleled determination. Chen Yushen lowered his eyes and didn\u2019t say anything.Bi Yaohua had thought that Gu Luo\u2019s frequent use of the bathroom was a bit strange. He wanted to ask a few more questions but he paused after hearing these words. Then he started to operate his character to walk toward the lane. \u201cStay steady in the back and don\u2019t worry about me. Gloy, follow the captain to output! I can pay attention to the position of the opposite jungler.\u201dJing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t see the situation over there but based on everyone\u2019s reaction, he somewhat knew the answer. Rather than calling to end the game, he whispered, \u201cYes, don\u2019t drag it out. Fight quickly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Previously, he just had to run to the bathroom a few more times so he didn\u2019t think much of it. As a result, he never expected that he would start to feel uncomfortable in such a crucial deciding game.He had never said it but he was actually really nervous about today\u2019s finals. He had been stretched to a tight string in the past few days. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he had been stretched for too long but it seemed to have adverse effects. He felt a chill all over his body and unknowingly, his back had layers of sweat.Just now, he failed to protect Bi Yaohua due to his lack of concentration. It led to mistakes in this key team battle and Gu Luo felt severe self-blame. Now he put his attention back on the field. He controlled the feeling of dizziness and his face was pale as he gritted his teeth.However, the mistake just now was really too big. After a wave of annihilation and gaining the buff of the canyon overlord, the IBB had already gained enough of an advantage in one fell swoop. In this regard, the GH team wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to back down. Even so, IBB had taken the lead and was unwilling to miss such an opportunity. They took advantage of the situation to clear the lane.As IBB\u2019s primary target, Bi Yaohua using positioning to avoid the overwhelming skills while cursing, \u201cFuck, I said that the IBB team secretly loves me but you didn\u2019t believe it. I have retreated to this point and they are still chasing me! There is a saying that the girls who chased me before aren\u2019t as persistent as them!\u201dJian Ye was maintaining a distance and watching Bi Yaohua\u2019s state. It was almost personal protection and this kept him from being killed by IBB. He secretly wiped at his sweat and couldn\u2019t help complaining, \u201cIsn\u2019t that nonsense? It would be really scary if a girl chases you like this.\u201dThis wave of a small battle ended and finally exchanged two heads. In the case where the other side had a significant advantage, GH showed an extreme operation. Gu Luo\u2019s screen was dark and he pressed his lips tightly together as he listened to the conversation in the voice channel.He could clearly feel the obvious case of his teammates in the last few team battles. It was because they tried their best to fill the loopholes caused by him that he felt more uncomfortable. The deciding game originally didn\u2019t need to be like this. Just for him\u2026The fingertips holding the mouse tightened.Gu Luo slowly closed his eyes and once he opened them again, his eyes were firm. He couldn\u2019t drag the team down any longer. They had to win this game!The time had reached 35 minutes. After another 5 minutes, the strong period of GH\u2019s lineup would end.Jing Yuanzhou saw that the overlord buff time on IBB was over and arranged things in the voice channel. \u201cThe guardian will be refreshed soon and IBB will definitely do something over there. Have you seen the few dots I marked? Abyss and Gun will intercept over there. BB, watch the time and enter the field appropriately. Gloy, go with me. Once I start the team battle, kill the opposite side\u2019s shooter. Can you do it?\u201dThis inquiring tone was too natural like it was the numerous previous actual combat exercises.Gu Luo naturally knew that this was likely to be the last team battle in the game and whoever could kill the enemy shooter first would determine the final success or failure. He didn\u2019t expect that despite his chaotic performance, Captain Jing was still willing to leave this heavy task in his hand. He was stunned.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice came again from the headphones. \u201cSince you\u2019re not feeling well, end the match early and don\u2019t delay it to the fourth game. Tell me, can it be done?\u201dGu Luo woke up and firmly gritted his teeth. \u201cGive it to me, Captain!\u201dFreestarJing Yuanzhou smiled with satisfaction. \u201cYes, let\u2019s go.\u201dFrom a god\u2019s perspective, it could be seen that after the resurrection of all members of IBB and GH, they started to approach the canyon in the upper half of the map. The atmosphere before the outbreak of the battle caused the audience to fall silent.There were no heads on either side but the keen intuition on the field was enough to make the players of the two teams feel the other side\u2019s eagerness. They constantly switched the position of the ambush and adjusted the best entry point.Both sides were looking for the best opportunity.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze was locked onto the fog with no clear vision and the entire voice channel was silent. The entire atmosphere was tense to the extreme. Everyone held their breaths and their fingertips on the keyboard and mouse were tense.Such a wait was undoubtedly a bit difficult but Jing Yuanzhou had experienced countless games and was still calm. In the silence, he saw a strand of clothing slightly swaying at the edge of the grass in the corner.It was just a short moment.In the light of the electric flint, Jing Yuanzhou already manipulated his character to rush out. \u201cGo!\u201dThe moment his voice fell, there was a group collision due to the use of flash,. The four IBB players who were undergoing a tactical transfer were hit directly.Commentator Brother Rabbit Hat couldn\u2019t help shouting, \u201cVery beautiful!\u201dOn the map, they saw Chen Yushen rushing out of the grass like a tiger and heading straight to IBB\u201ds mid-laner. IBB\u2019s support had an extremely rapid reaction and held the mid-laner firmly in the air before hitting the ground.Once the other members of IBB reacted, a wave of skills exploded. Jian Ye saw Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s health bar drop in a shocking manner and finished casting the spell. He lifted the health bar up in one breath.Bi Yaohua entered the field as well. He controlled the distance and outputted wildly. In a competition of output intensity, any reduction in players was fatal. The battle was fierce for a time.On the screen, it could be seen that Gu Luo\u2019s character remained in the grass. He was the only tranquility on the fierce scene. He never revealed his whereabouts and continued to wait!Wait until the moment IBB\u2019s shooter fell into his output range! Wait until a shot to kill and change the overall situation!IBB\u2019s shooter couldn\u2019t determine Gu Luo\u2019s location so he didn\u2019t show up for a long time. However, seeing his team falling to a disadvantage in the exchange of fire and the number was reduced by two, he finally couldn\u2019t help it. He had to join in the battle. Yet almost the moment when he appeared, a figure with a black dagger rushed out from the side without warning.The heart of IBB\u2019s shooter was stunned. He knew it was bad and instinctively tried to call for help on the voice channel, but it was clearly too late.Gu Luo had been waiting in ambush for so long for this moment! The sharp dagger cut through the throat of IBB\u2019s shooter and brought a bloody end to this wave of team battle. In just two seconds, the thin body of the shooter was the prey of dazzling skills and his health was completely emptied.At almost the same time, Jing Yuanzhou was killed by IBB after completing his mission. The health of the IBB mid-laner was also emptied by Chen Yushen, who entered and retreated several times. Chen Yushen received a head and was buried in the same place. The moment his teammates died in succession, he stepped forward and took over the heavy task of the front row. With his protection, Bi Yaohua went crazy in the back row, firing shot after shot and completing the final clearance![ACE (team extinction)!]IBB was destroyed in one wave and GH still had three people alive. The soldiers arrived and GH quickly pushed to the high ground, taking victory.Three games in a row!GH showed absolute strength in the finals and won the final championship of Burning Hot Assembly!Commentator Brother Rabbit Hat looked a bit dumbfounded. \u201cTitans\u2019s opening of the team battle this time was too great! In addition, the operation on both sides was very extreme! It is regrettable that IBB failed to win back a game but I have to say that in this game, they showed an absolute professional qualification level! Still, at this time I have to say\u2026 the championship of this season has been officially decided. Congratulations to the GH team on winning the qualification to the autumn competition of the professional league!\u201dCommentator Cry Cry clapped vigorously along with the cheers of the audience. \u201cYes, there will be a new dark horse team in the autumn competition. Let us congratulate GH!\u201dIn the players\u2019 area, both sides had taken off their headphones. This was when GH finally had time to see Gu Luo\u2019s situation. It was only a short time for the game but Gu Luo\u2019s white face was truly scary.Jian Ye saw he was going to stand up and hurriedly helped him. \u201cHow are you feeling? What is going on? Do you want to hurry to the hospital?\u201dGu Luo took a deep breath and waved his hand with a bit of effort. \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2026 let\u2019s go pay tribute to the IBB team first.\u201dThe formal process was that the winner needed to shake hands with the loser after the game.Everyone understood this type of thing but they weren\u2019t at ease due to Gu Luo\u2019s poor state. In the end, at Gu Luo\u2019s insistence, the group of people surrounded him and escorted him all the way to the IBB team.The players at IBB were frustrated that they missed the chance to advance again. Then they saw GH\u2019s big actions and were shocked. After asking what was going on, they saw Gu Luo\u2019s face and hurriedly shook hands so Gu Luo could rush to the hospital.The audience didn\u2019t know what was going on. They only watched from a distance. They saw the people from both sides huddled together and inexplicably thought that there was going to be a group fight.The director was shocked when he saw the query on the barrage and quickly switched the camera to the venue host to maintain order. In addition, he called several staff members to ask what happened.The staff looked bitter at this question. Originally, after the game, the champion team had many processes to do. It was obvious no one thought there would be such an emergency situation and hesitated over how to deal with it.Lin Yan had naturally noticed that Gu Luo played abnormally in the game. At this time, he came on stage and asked what happened. He glanced at Gu Luo\u2019s face and thought about it. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll take Gloy to the hospital. The rest of you can stay and follow the process\u201dGu Luo was surrounded by many people and the feeling of a lack of oxygen only increased. He was concerned about his bad performance and at this time, he felt dizzy as he spoke lightly, \u201cYes, just let the coach send me. I\u2019m sorry everybody\u2026 I caused you trouble.\u201dThe others were hesitant but Jing Yuanzhou directly decided. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it.\u201dThe staff sighed with relief. The entire scene was busy and after a while, it split into two. On one side, they were busy with the follow-up interview section while on the other side, it could be seen that Lin Yan and Gu Luo left through the security passage under the guidance of the staff.Soon, the post-match processes were finally launched officially. The attentive audience discovered that GH\u2019s lineup was obviously missing two people. In addition, regardless of the awards, interviews and follow up press interviews, all the members looked impatient and frequently gave reminders to hurry up. None of the joy of winning could be seen.In particular, Bi Yaohua was really impatient to deal with the questions from the e-sports media. Before the question was asked, he talked about a long psychological journey in one breath and frowned. \u201cSo is there anything else you need to ask?\u201dThe reporters were directly choked up by him. \u201c\u2026No, nothing else.\u201dThe interviews ended and the last episode of Burning Hot Assembly came to a successful conclusion. The members of GH didn\u2019t stay at the recording site for long. They got in the car and headed straight to the nearest hospital.Half an hour later, they finally saw Gu Luo receiving an IV. Lin Yan was sitting next to him, playing casually with his phone. Feeling the light dim in front of him, he raised his head. Then he saw the people who came in and asked lightly, \u201cYou\u2019re all here?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Bi Yaohua was rarely silent for a moment before asking, \u201cCoach, what do you mean by that? What did the doctor say? What is the situation with Gloy?\u201d\u201cAsk him yourself.\u201d Lin Yan finished speaking and returned his gaze to the phone. The phone was displaying the official Weibo of the show after they just announced the championship team.Gu Luo noticed the eyes that focused on him and buried his head even lower in self-blame. \u201cSorry, I made everyone worried\u2026 the doctor said I am fine. I was just too nervous recently. Combined with my irregular work and rest, it resulted in a bit of weakness. I eventually got a temporary problem with my stomach. However, I have taken medicine just now and I\u2019m receiving an IV. It should be fine after a few days.\u201dThen he scratched the back of his head with the hand that didn\u2019t have the needle in it and bowed to everyone apologetically. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this is the first time I participated in such an important event. I was\u2026 unable to adjust my state for a while and dragged back the team. I\u2019m sorry!\u201dNext to him, Lin Yan spoke without raising his head. \u201cTherefore, I already told him that if such a thing happens again in the future, you should all pay attention to it. It is normal to be nervous when encountering key matches. However, if you have insomnia then you must tell Luo Mo. The team has a lot of money and can give you some psychological counselors. If you can\u2019t sleep then don\u2019t get up and train all night. The pressure is high and I\u2019m sure you want to play well, but the main thing is how you play on the field. You can\u2019t always be as lucky as today, you know?\u201dHearing this, everyone understood what was going on and finally sighed with relief. \u201cWe know.\u201dNow thinking about it again, Gu Luo was indeed the only pure rookie on the so-called new GH team.Needless to say, Jing Yuanzhou and Bi Yaohua were professional players who had played in the league. Jian Ye might\u2019ve been the substitute of a secondary league team but he could still be considered a person in the e-sports circle. As for Chen Yushen, he had come out of the youth academy and the pressure he needed to endure there wasn\u2019t small. Only Gu Luo was a novice anchor and Titans fan who was dug up by the GH team. He didn\u2019t have much experience and it was understandable that he didn\u2019t know how to deal with such an important event.Speaking of which, failing to pay attention to the child\u2019s psychological condition in time could be regarded as the negligence of the coach Lin Yan.Lin Yan thought up to here and somewhat blamed himself, so he didn\u2019t continue the topic. He looked at the others strangely. \u201cSpeaking of which, why are you here so soon? The interview session is over? We didn\u2019t prepare any manuscripts in advance for the media interviews but BB\u2019s performance on the spot should be good. What questions did they ask? Did you give a good impression of the club?\u201dThe moment he asked this, everyone instinctively pressed their lips together and were silent.Lin Yan had accompanied Gu Luo to register for a blood test and didn\u2019t have time to watch the live broadcast. He didn\u2019t know the specific situation and could only look at Jing Yuanzhou for an answer.Jing Yuanzhou met this gaze and gave a low laugh. \u201cHow should I put it\u2026 the spirit of our team was quite ignited. Your side went to their hospital and their minds came together. There were too many procedures arranged by the show and we were a bit anxious, so we dealt with it casually. In fact, I think there is nothing wrong with this. Isn\u2019t it good that the team is harmonious?\u201dLin Yan was silent and couldn\u2019t help rubbing his eyebrows in a tired manner. \u201cI say, do you know why we fought all this way? It is for today\u2019s finals! Even those teams in the professional league don\u2019t have many opportunities for this type of large-scale media reception! We were so arrogant before the match. Now that the match is over, shouldn\u2019t we take advantage of this opportunity? Aren\u2019t you the best at pretending to be pretentious, let alone the fact that this is the treatment you should enjoy after winning the championship. Why? Don\u2019t you want to save on publicity expenses before the autumn competition?\u201dHis words ended and the surroundings were quieter than ever.The moment the match ended, everyone was focused on Gu Luo. During the following processes, they were anxious to go to the hospital so they didn\u2019t react until now. They seemed to have neglected another important mood.After a long time, Jian Ye seemed to return to his senses. He looked down at the trophy in his hand and expressed what everyone was thinking. \u201cFuck, are we really a professional team?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThey were all here so everyone simply stayed at the hospital to accompany Gu Luo while he received an IV. People came and went from the infusion room in an endless stream but their colorful hair and team uniform were really eye-catching. Unsurprisingly, the people around them often glanced at them.Gu Luo\u2019s two bottles of IV were too slow. By the time they were finished, the sky outside was completely dark. Obviously, they all had no more interest in going to the celebration party previously scheduled. Therefore, they boarded the business car and directly returned to the base.Even so, celebrating was still necessary. After thinking about it, Lin Yan called Luo Mo on the way back and asked him to order some takeout in advance to be sent to the team base. Gu Luo was unwell and fell asleep after getting in the car. The others were afraid of being noisy and simply quietly played with their phones.Unsurprisingly, the result of the finals of Burning Hot Assembly had been uploaded on the Internet. It accounted for three entries on the top hot search alone. This popularity was comparable to the mid-season that had just finished its first elimination. Putting aside everything else, the program was quite willing to spend money on publicity.Lin Yan casually looked through it and found that the number of sunspots under the hot search was much less than expected. It wasn\u2019t difficult to guess that these people were likely reserving their energy and waiting for their team to fall down after being defeated. He couldn\u2019t help letting out a low laugh.Just then, the man sitting next to him gently touched him with an elbow. Lin Yan looked up and saw Jing Yuanzhou silently mouthing \u2018look at this\u2019 to him before handing over the phone. He didn\u2019t know what Jing Yuanzhou had up his sleeve. Lin Yan suspiciously lowered his eyes and clearly saw the chat record displayed on the screen.Luni: You\u2019ve finally returned to the professional league! Congratulations!Jing Yuanzhou: Thank you.Luni: We are going to face each other in the autumn competition soon. Are you nervous?Jing Yuanzhou: Would you believe it if I said I was nervous?Luni: It is impossible to believe it but\u2026 I just asked this casually yet you really answered so casually?Jing Yuanzhou: The teams will soon be reduced from eight to four. Shouldn\u2019t you be adjusting your state? Why run to me? Just say it if there is something.Luni: Well, it\u2019s nothing. I just want to make an appointment with you for a training match in advance.Jing Yuanzhou: The mid-season isn\u2019t over yet. Aren\u2019t you getting ahead of yourself?Luni: Who told GH to be the dark horse team? I have to make an appointment early to rest assured.Jing Yuanzhou: Oh, I see.Luni: Is that a yes?Jing Yuanzhou: Let\u2019s talk about it later. It depends on the mood of my boss.Luni: \u2026\u2026.Lin Yan quickly read all of it and slightly raised his eyebrow.If nothing else, he really had to find a way to re-adjust the state of the team before the autumn season. In this way, formal training matches naturally needed to be arranged in advance. In the original plan, once the matches to enter the semi-finals were played tomorrow, he could try to contact all teams except for the two teams in the finals.Even though they had obtained a professional qualification, they were a new team from a variety show in its first season after all. The so-called program\u2019s champion didn\u2019t have much value in the eyes of the teams in the professional league.It would be best if they got four or five training games. If their luck wasn\u2019t good and only one or two teams were willing, he could consider teams from the secondary league.Yet the top team LDF was so active. Their qualification for the professional league was just determined this afternoon yet Luni took the initiative to contact Jing Yuanzhou in the evening. This had not been expected by Lin Yan.He looked at the back of the seat in front of him before opening WeChat and quickly tapping on the screen. A few moments later, Jing Yuanzhou received a new message: Aside from anything else, Luni is indeed a top player with excellent vision.Jing Yuanzhou looked at this message that seemed to praise others but was in fact bragging about himself in disguise and couldn\u2019t help smiling as he replied: Don\u2019t worry about answering him. First look at the interest of the other teams. If we can\u2019t find anything then we can use LDF.Lin Yan worked hard to suppress his laugh. He probably had a guess. Luni was invited as a guest of the show. After watching them all the way, he noticed the endless potential of the GH team and eagerly sold himself for a training match in order to test them.Of course, there was no problem with this. It was just a pity that he estimated the blackness of the team. It was natural to contact LDF for a training match but now that LDF was directly sent to them, it made them feel not anxious at all. This was probably the so-called \u2018the one who is favored is fearless.\u2019If Luni knew that he had turned the huge LDF team into a training match spare tire, would he be so angry that he would commit suicide on the spot?Of course, Lin Yan had been planning on doing this even if Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t suggested it. No matter what, he always coincided with his captain when it came to cheating people. It could only be said that they might both be phenomenal top players but compared with Jing Yuanzhou, Luni was still too pure.The car stopped at the gate of the base and the members of GH got off one by one.Luo Mo had ordered takeout from a nearby restaurant and it had already been delivered. A round table was set up directly in the center of the hall and when they entered through the door, it seemed quite powerful at first glance.Gu Luo had slept in the car and his spirit had recovered well. He also sat at the table with the group and ate a meal. However, drinks definitely weren\u2019t allowed. In the end, he could only hold the hot water prepared in advance to drink.Due to the rules set after the barbecue last time, there wasn\u2019t a single can of beer on the table. Nevertheless, they couldn\u2019t resist the joy of winning the championship of the show. They happily toasted with cups of Coke and were still burping when they finally returned to the dormitory to rest.By the time Lin Yan and Luo Mo confirmed all the details of the publicity and came back, the lively voices had already disappeared. For a few days, everyone had been holding their strength for today\u2019s finals. Now that all their efforts had finally been rewarded, they felt relieved and could get a good night\u2019s sleep.Lin Yan didn\u2019t hurry back to his room and went to the training room on the second floor for a check as usual. After closing the door, he was about to go back and rest. He turned around and inadvertently saw the person leaning against the balcony railing. It was a familiar back view. Since the light wasn\u2019t turned on, he could only see the faint moonlight falling down and creating a long shadow on the ground. This person seemed to be surrounded by a faint halo.In the silence, Jing Yuanzhou leaned against the railing and smoked a cigarette. The hazy smoke floated around him for a long time without dispersing.Lin Yan unknowingly stopped as he was about to leave. For some reason, he suddenly remembered Luni\u2019s chat history. At that time, the other person\u2019s first sentence in greeting was: You\u2019ve finally returned to the professional league! Congratulations!For the GH Club and most of the players, winning the qualification for the autumn competition was indeed the best recognition of strength. However, for the man who once stood at the top, it had a different meaning. It was a return after a brief departure.Although it was true that he actively sought after Jing Yuanzhou from the beginning, Lin Yan always knew that his team obviously wasn\u2019t the best choice after leaving the BK team. He knew how hard it was for a top player to decide to let go of his previous glory and start again from scratch. He was always aware that Jing Yuanzhou was far less indifferent than he seemed. There were many things that Lin Yan didn\u2019t ask about and in some ways, he knew that Jing Yuanzhou wasn\u2019t willing to mention it.Jing Yuanzhou perhaps heard the footsteps behind him and turned around.Lin Yan walked into the balcony calmly. He leaned against the railing next to this person and smiled. \u201cDo you still have a cigarette?\u201dJing Yuanzhou took out a box of cigarettes from his pants pocket and handed it over.Lin Yan put one in his mouth. \u201cBorrow a light?\u2019Then he leaned slightly toward the lighter in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s hand. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes shook slightly. Between the curls of smoke, he could feel the soft hair gently rubbing against the skin of his face.The outline of this side profile entered his vision and it was enough to make people stunned.This scene was familiar. It was the same balcony but the person borrowing the fire had changed places.Once the cigarette was lit, Lin Yan leaned back against the railing, tilting his head up slightly to look at the bright lights not far away. \u201cEveryone played well today. There was the small situation with Gloy in the third game but the overall rhythm wasn\u2019t chaotic and your cooperation is becoming more tacit. Later, I will think of a way to strengthen their personal strength so that Gun Zai can take over the position of commander as soon as possible. At that time, you can let go completely.\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze was always on this person. Now his narrow eyes squinted slightly and he slowly blew out a mouthful of smoke. \u201cDon\u2019t push them too hard. Just go with the flow. I think the current rhythm is quite good. Don\u2019t care too much about the team rhythm. Don\u2019t worry, I can cooperate.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you ever questioned it?\u2019 Lin Yan\u2019s voice was light. \u201cYou are all in the same team. Why do you always have to cooperate with others instead of letting them cooperate with you?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes slightly lowered and remained silent.Lin Yan had already assessed the peak strength of all the players earlier and had a lot of thoughts about Jing Yuanzhou. This time, he expressed it directly. \u201cI said just now that I will try to adjust their state to the best to liberate you completely. The GH team isn\u2019t the previous BK. It doesn\u2019t require sacrifice or accommodation. Every team member can complement each other. This is the most desirable form of a team. The first time we watched Gloy, you said that he is good at everything but too independent. Now you have seen that he has fully adapted to the team\u2019s pace and this aggressive style of play. This isn\u2019t a big problem.\u201dHe said this and smiled lightly at Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cSince the team can perfectly adapt to Gloy, why not make the same effort to adapt to you?\u201dJing Yuanzhou stared at Lin Yan. Then after a moment of silence, he couldn\u2019t help laughing slightly. \u201cDo you like to create all types of problems for yourself?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to have a challenge.\u201d Lin Yan blinked in a noncommittal manner before smiling. \u201cStill, what can I do? I just don\u2019t like to wrong any player in the team, let along\u2026 wrong you.\u201dThe night breeze blew in and Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s hair slowly floated in the air.After so many years as a professional player, the young man who had first unknowingly joined the league had already faded away. In his years in the BK team, he had gradually learned to polish his edges and corners to blend in perfectly with the rhythm of the team. Everything was natural and smooth. Due to this, no one mentioned it anymore or wanted him to go back to the time when he was reckless and brash.This was originally a team game and Jing Yuanzhou naturally knew that there was no problem with this concept. In addition, his glorious achievements again and again proved that his choice of abandoning his original style to cooperate with the team was indeed correct.In fact, only Jing Yuanzhou knew that the tiger hiding in his heart might be sleeping but this didn\u2019t mean there were no regrets. It was just that this personal regret wasn\u2019t worth mentioning when placed in front of the glory of the team.In fact, he had always thought that he would finish his last one or two years plainly before bidding farewell to this battlefield that he had struggled on for many years with the blessing of fans, just like all retired players.Originally, everything was indeed proceeding step by step to this end. The only change was probably the sudden choice made by BK\u2019s management that allowed him to meet Lin Yan before he officially retired. As a result, there were some different expectations.Jing Yuanzhou was immersed in his thoughts as he leaned against the railing. The cigarette butt that was about to burn out had only a weak flame left, just like the light flashing in his eyes. \u201cCan I understand it as you feeling distressed for me?\u201dLin Yan was taken aback for a moment. He wanted to answer \u2018yes\u2019 but under such a gaze, a strange feeling arose in his heart for some reason. After a pause, the words on his lips became, \u201cI have an obligation to be responsible for all players.\u201dJing Yuanzhou squeezed out the cigarette butt and threw it into the trash can next to him. Then he smiled slightly and said nothing.Suddenly, a long silence hung over the two men.Lin Yan inexplicably avoided Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze. He didn\u2019t continue the topic from just now. He stared at the neon lights in the distance and started to search for other topics. \u201cSpeaking of which, why are you using SpongeBob SquarePants as your WeChat profile picture?\u201dIn fact, the first night they added each other\u2019s WeChat, he noticed that this avatar was completely inconsistent with a professional player. Today he saw the chat history with Luni and remembered it again. This opportunity caused him to casually ask the question in his heart.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t answer and instead asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it cute?\u201dIn the end, Lin Yan told the truth. \u201c\u2026It is pretty cute.\u201dJing Yuanzhou raised his eyes to look at this person. His mouth slightly twitched as he wondered, \u201cIf you think it is cute, I have an image of Patrick Star here. Do you need me to send it to you?\u201dRainbow Turtle: Hmm, I\u2019ve been pondering on something. The author has just recently changed the name of this novel. New title would be something like The E-sports\u2019 Circle Demon Kings Assembly Camp. Should I keep this title or change it to the new one?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They heard the message notifications in the team group chat and sleepily clicked it casually. Then they became stunned without warning.Lin Breeder: Are you awake?Titans \u2013 Jing Yuanzhou: Perhaps not yet.Lin Breeder: It seems they are really tired these days. They actually haven\u2019t gotten up at this time.Lin Breeder: @Titans \u2013 Jing Yuanzhou are you hungry? Come down to eat first if you\u2019re hungry.Titans \u2013 Jing Yuanzhou: Not bad.Lin Breeder: Wait a minute. I asked the auntie to keep the lunch warm. Once they wake up then we\u2019ll eat together.Titans \u2013 Jing Yuanzhou: Yes.It was obviously a very ordinary conversation and the content was even common. However, since these two people had a yellow and a pink head, a different taste inexplicably emerged.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s WeChat profile picture had been SpongeBob SquarePants from the beginning. They could naturally recognize it with one glance. The key lay mainly in Lin Yan\u2019s new profile picture. It was soft and pink. At first glance, they thought a girl\u2019s heart was overflowing. This was P-Patrick Star?Jian Ye was still lying in bed when he clicked on the team group chat. Once he saw it, his first reaction was, \u2018Have I not woken up yet?\u2019He stared at the ceiling for a while before his phone vibrated twice. He opened it to take a look. It was obvious that others had the same questions as him.Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo: Coach, why did you change your profile picture?Lin Breeder: Huh? One person woke up?Lin Breeder: This was sent to me by Titans yesterday. Isn\u2019t it cute?Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo: Yes.Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo: Cute.Lin Breeder: I saw you weren\u2019t awake just now and even went to look for it specially.Lin Breeder: What do you think of these profile pictures? Are they cute? I\u2019ll send them to you.After speaking, Lin Yan posted several images in the group in the blink of an eye.Jian Ye stared intently and saw Brother Octopus, Snail, Sandy and Karen in turn.Jian Ye, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help appearing in the group.Gun \u2013 Jian Ye: Coach, you have a good eye.Lin Breeder: You woke up as well. See which one you like and change it too?Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo: Huh? Us too?Titans \u2013 Jing Yuanzhou: Do you want to change?

It\u2019s good for you and the captain. We won\u2019t join in on the fun.Gun \u2013 Jian Ye: Oh, is everyone up? I\u2019m so hungry. Let\u2019s eat, eat!Lin Breeder: Okay, let\u2019s go down to eat first.Judging from the tone of Lin Yan\u2019s last sentence, there was a lack of interest in everyone\u2019s attitude. After a while, everyone came downstairs and sat in the dining room one by one. Today, the aunt had cooked a very rich meal. Lin Yan ate with everyone for a while but was still unwilling to give up. He asked again, \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to change your profile picture?\u201dJing Yuanzhou also smiled slightly as he looked at everyone. \u201cYes, do you want to change it?\u201dThis expression was exactly the same as the smile he had just posted in the WeChat group. They were obviously mild and gentle words but why did Gu Luo and Bi Yaohua feel a deeper meaning? Their backs became slightly cold.Gu Luo couldn\u2019t help lowering his head.Bi Yaohua coughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be polite. Coach, it\u2019s particularly suitable for you to use with the captain.\u201dJian Ye didn\u2019t think much. He pondered on it while eating before replying, \u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, Gu Luo next to him secretly stepped on his foot. Due to the pain, he choked back the second half of the sentence. \u201cHiss\u2014! Gloy, what are you doing?\u201dGu Luo still had his head obediently lowered to eat his meal. He didn\u2019t raise his head as he responded harmlessly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Brother, my body is still a bit uncomfortable and I can\u2019t control my feet.\u201dJian Ye, \u201c???\u201d\u2018I remember that you just have a little discomfort regarding your stomach. Now you have epilepsy?\u2019Lin Yan saw that his suggestion was rejected twice in a row and couldn\u2019t help pouting as he sighed. \u201cThey are really cute\u2026\u201dJing Yuanzhou comforted him in a timely manner. \u201cYes, they are cute but these people don\u2019t know how to appreciate it.\u201dBi Yaohua and Gu Luo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d \u2018Captain, doesn\u2019t your conscience hurt speaking like this?\u2019They were silent for a moment but controlled their twitching mouths. They buried their heads and ate their meal. The moment the meal was over, Lin Yan finally gave up on changing the profile pictures and brought the topic back to business. \u201cRight, you just woke up. Have you seen Weibo yet?\u201dThe members of GH, \u201c???\u201dLin Yan knew the answer as soon as he looked at their expressions and explained without any surprise. \u201cThe Burning Hot official side has officially announced our team\u2019s professional qualification and the club\u2019s publicity department has cooperated with the official Weibo to promote it. Later, remember to log into Weibo and forward it. As for the comments, you don\u2019t need to read them. They aren\u2019t important and it is just wasting time on those idlers.\u201dListening to Lin Yan\u2019s words, everyone knew that the sunspots must\u2019ve started commenting again. Therefore, they all took out their mobile phones without hesitation. They completed the forwarding one by one before immediately\u2026 clicking into the comments area below. The series of movements was natural and unforced and showed how skilled they were.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Lin Yan sincerely told them, \u201cIf you can maintain this type of execution in every game then it really won\u2019t be difficult to win.\u201dJing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t help smiling.Regardless of whether it was Burning Hot\u2019s official Weibo or GH\u2019s official Weibo, the two contents used the official business format. It was nothing more than congratulating the successful conclusion of the first season of Burning Hot Assembly. Then it congratulated GH for being the first team to advance to the professional league through this format and it announced the list of all teams participating in the autumn competition. Lastly, it wished all teams to strive for success in the final official competition of the season.Since the news had been released this morning, there were already tens of thousands of comments below and it was continuing to rise. Now that the GH players forwarded it, the comments area that was originally filled with demons creating chaos became filled with gunpowder instantly.The style under Burning Hot\u2019s official Weibo post was probably like this:[Previously, I thought the officials merely started a variety show with a hot head yet a team actually entered the professional league?][This is playing too much.][Isn\u2019t this a variety show team? Is defeating secondary league teams like IBB considered great?][What one of the teams in the professional league hasn\u2019t come up using hard work? Why can a team like GH directly occupy a spot?][Hey hey hey, did the people above watch the show? Don\u2019t act pretentious when you didn\u2019t watch.][Let me teach science to the brainless black fans. GH won the game with LARK, okay? Why are they unworthy?][What is so good about this type of trash show?][Just wait. I\u2019ll laugh to death once they enter the professional league.][The official promotion channel is formal. If you aren\u2019t convinced then find the officials to make trouble!][E-sports is a place where the powerful have the right to speak. Why can\u2019t I ridicule an opportunistic team?]Meanwhile, GH\u2019s official Weibo post became a battlefield between the fans and sunspots.[I\u2019m laughing to death. I sprayed water the first time I saw the official announcement about the promotion quota.][A team without strength definitely won\u2019t be recognized. I guessed it early.][Do you really think you have the strength of a professional team just because you won against a few secondary league teams?][Arrogant GH Club. Buying a hot search and marketing accounts everywhere. Aren\u2019t you afraid of becoming a joke after spending so much money?][Objectively speaking, the GH team does have strength. If it was done step by step then I guess not so many people would be mocking them now.][The above are all speaking nonsense. Why can\u2019t GH win the professional qualifications using skill?][Just wait! I\u2019m looking forward to the fall when GH sends all of you home.][Additionally, Coach Lin said previously that the air tickets will be reimbursed collectively!][GH fans are really good at talking. What team in the professional league is easy to bully? Be careful not to cry on the field after being abused!][There is a saying that the problems with the GH players are worse one after another. They step on the forbidden line so smoothly. Don\u2019t get a penalty before the game starts.][That reminds me of a joke. BB seems to still have half a month left for his suspension.][Hahahahahaha, the Trash Talk King seems to be in a hurry. Will he renew his suspension package?]Bi Yaohua was reading the comments and he slightly raised an eyebrow when he saw this last sentence. Before his fingers could touch the screen, he felt the gazes of his teammates fall on him. He looked up at his teammates and couldn\u2019t help blinking in confusion. \u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u2019Jian Ye wondered with a serious face, \u201cWe\u2019re wondering when you\u2019re going to start showing your real skills.\u201dBi Yaohua, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe lowered his head and glanced at the Weibo comment area again. Then he snorted disdainfully. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not so idle that I will talk to these guys on Weibo. What is the meaning? It\u2019s better to start a live broadcast. At least that can be positive.\u201dThe others had been angry seeing the comments area. They were taken aback when they heard this before their eyes lit up. \u201cYes, we should start a live broadcast!\u201dThere was no point in arguing with these brainless sunspots on Weibo. It was better to start a live broadcast and directly show their skill level. A superb show of strength was the best way to block these people\u2019s dirty mouths!They thought this and all turned to stare at Lin Yan.Lin Yan looked at them strangely but there was a faint smile on his face. \u201cThere is no training scheduled for today. If you want to do the live broadcast then can I stop you? There is nothing else to see. It\u2019s your free time. Just remember to prepare the fine money in advance. This won\u2019t be reimbursed by the club.\u201dBi Yaohua grinned. \u201cOf course!\u201dJian Ye twisted his wrists. \u201cOkay, what are we doing here? If you\u2019re full then go to the training room to fuck them!\u201dThe sunspots saw the GH players repost the official Weibo and were enjoying themselves in the comment area. As a result, they hadn\u2019t had enough when they saw the live broadcast platform notification popping up on their mobile phones.Previously, to make it more convenient, the sunspots set a special attention for everyone in GH. Now all five players, including Titans, started a live broadcast!It was GH\u2019s first public appearance since they officially qualified for the professional league. The moment Jing Yuanzhou started broadcasting, the popularity of his room rose by several million in minutes. He didn\u2019t turn on the camera and there was just the sound of him checking his equipment. Then Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice was faintly heard. \u201cShall we line up as a pair today?\u201dMoments later, a voice passed through the headset and entered the live broadcast room. \u201cWait for me to turn it on.\u201dBarrage: [!!!]The author has something to say:Lin Yan: Why are you so reluctant to change your profile pictures? Aren\u2019t the profile pictures chosen by me cute enough?Jing Yuanzhou: It isn\u2019t your problem. They just have bad vision \ud83d\ude42Rainbow Turtle: Decided to keep the original title but will leave a note on TOC with the new title as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 61Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFans had been looking forward to it for a long time but since the last live broadcast, Lin Yan had never played doubles with Jing Yuanzhou. They never imagined there would be such good treatment today so they immediately filled the screen with the barrage.[Wow, is this a benefit after entering the professional league?][The Parent combination is open again. I love it!][Since the day of the finals, TItans\u2019 death wanderer has left me dreaming about it. Will I be lucky enough to watch it today?][Right, I want to see the death wanderer too! Titans, show off a good hero and protect your coach.][Taking someone to gain points is to let them experience the feeling of lying down and winning. I\u2019m not doing it for myself, it\u2019s for the coach.]Jing Yuanzhou just finished adjusting his equipment when he glanced at the barrage and corrected it. \u201cI\u2019m not bringing him with me. He is taking me to score points.\u201dLin Yan had just started the game and he heard such a sentence when he entered the voice chat channel. He couldn\u2019t help glancing sideways at this person. \u201cDoesn\u2019t your conscience hurt?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was unmoved. \u201cI\u2019m just telling the truth.\u201dLin Yan raised his eyes and didn\u2019t continue to talk. He accepted the invitation to form a team. Then he thought about it and took advantage of the queue to open Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s live broadcasts room.The barrage was still scrolling on the screen.[Hahaha, that\u2019s right. Doesn\u2019t your conscience hurt?][So Titans is originally like this.][Sure enough, the mouths of all professional players are deceptive ghosts.][You aren\u2019t bringing him? Be careful that the coach won\u2019t team up with you next time!]It might seem harmonious overall but it was inevitable that some people would come out from time to time to say strange things. However, they were soon banned by the housekeepers.Even Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s live broadcast had so many demons making trouble despite the large number of fans protecting him. It was enough to imagine what was happening in the other live broadcast rooms.Lin Yan had this thought and scanned the training room. He looked around and found that the others\u2019 expressions weren\u2019t filled with righteous indignation. He was relieved and retracted his gaze.Then Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice was heard in his ear. \u201cWhat are you playing?\u201dLin Yan discovered that the queue had ended. He banned a hero and replied casually, \u201cI\u2019ll fill any spot.\u201dEverything seemed very logical except for the new avatar in the banned area. Once the audience clearly saw the hero that Lin Yan had banned, the entire barrage was covered with overwhelming question marks. [???][No\u2026 Coach Lin, if you are kidnapped then please blink?][Wake up, Titans is your teammate! Why are you banning the death wanderer? Let him take you to lie down!][Did the coach\u2019s hand slip? Shouldn\u2019t this hero be left to the opposite side to ban?][You are stupid. How can the other side know that Titans is here? It is impossible to ban it!][Titans, when did you offend Coach Lin? Love each other to death?]Jing Yuanzhou lit up the side lane sign on the BP interface and glanced at the content on the barrage. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to coax him. How can I offend him?\u201dLin Yan saw the barrage had turned into a sea of \u2018ahhhh\u2019 and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIf you want to see Titans\u2019 death wanderer then you can see it on the field next time. There is no need to watch it during the live broadcast. There might be a chance for it to appear on the field. If we go too far in the live broadcast then it might really sit in the banned position the whole season.\u201d[Coach, aren\u2019t you thinking too much? This grave of this hero in the banned position is already more than 10 meters higher.][A team that dares to release death wanderer for Titans in the professional league hasn\u2019t been born yet.][Wanting to see Titans\u2019 death wanderer in the professional league? You might as well bring a bouquet of flowers directly to the grave of this hero.]\u201cThere should always be a bit of hope in life.\u201d Lin Yan spoke noncommittally. \u201cPerhaps we will be lucky and encounter a team where a player has shaking hands?\u201dBarrage: [Hahahaha.]Some fans still didn\u2019t give up. [Titans, you should control the coach.]Jing Yuanzhou replied, \u201cI can\u2019t control him. He usually controls me.\u201dThe barrage was completely choked up.[Titans, you\u2019ve changed.][Titans, you\u2019ve changed +1.][Titans, you\u2019ve changed +2.]During the conversation, the first game officially began.In this game, Lin Yan was in the support position. He looked at the side lane player walking to the front of the line with his sickle and also slowly and leisurely made his way to the middle lane. He helped clear a line of soldiers before moving to the bottom lane to protect the shooter.A game with passersby didn\u2019t have too many twists and turns and it saved a lot of brain cells.Lin Yan crouched in the grass to help the shooter look at the field while glancing at the top lane from time to time. Not surprisingly, there was a very efficient harvest of heads. Within minutes, Jing Yuanzhou had completely suppressed the other player so that he didn\u2019t dare go out of the tower.Putting aside everything else, it was very easy to team up with Jing Yuanzhou. After all, no matter what type of teammate he was matched with, Jing Yuanzhou could always steadily clear the lane. Pushing the lane was more important than anything in a game with passersby.It had really been a long time since Lin Yan paired up with someone in the voice chat. However, he recently tried it with Jing Yuanzhou and found that his adaptation to this man\u2019s voice was better than expected.It was also in a closed voice environment. In the past, he had unwillingly tried it with other people but the result wasn\u2019t too optimistic. Now the voice in his ears was changed to Jing Yuanzhou. It was very strange but he didn\u2019t have the same uncomfortable feeling as before. This man\u2019s voice was deep and magnetic. When it was transmitted through the headphones, it was like temptation amplified by countless times.It was precisely because he hadn\u2019t played such a comfortable game for so long that before he knew it, he was immersed in the process. Based on the current situation, he wouldn\u2019t feel repulsed even if he played for an hour.Thinking of this, Lin Yan who was squatting in the grass had a strange thought in his mind. \u2018If there are four Jing Yuanzhous then perhaps it is no longer impossible to play a team match.\u2019In this round, Jing Yuanzhou directly won the lane by himself and the shooter also developed well under Lin Yan\u2019s protection. In the end, they won without any suspense. The two of them quickly re-entered the queue.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cDon\u2019t fill the position this game. How about playing jungler?\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t understand what he meant. \u201chuh?\u201d\u201cYour support stays on the bottom lane all the time and it is too far from the top road.\u201d[Wow???][Is it my illusion? What is this unexpected dog food?][Can it be understood as the furthest distance in the world is that between the top and bottom lanes?][I\u2019m good, I\u201dm really good. This is indeed the CP I\u2019ve been waiting so long for!]Just then, the queue ended. After entering, they saw that Lin Yan once again banned the death wanderer without hesitation.Barrage: [\u2026][I suspect the coach is suggesting we shut up but I have no evidence.][I don\u2019t blame you. I\u2019m also suspicious.][What hatred and grievances? We just want to see Titans\u2019s death wanderer!]Lin Yan scanned the content of the barrage and gave a low laugh. \u201cLook at the head of the death wanderer in the banned position? The entire grave is here. If you want to see it then look. There is no charge.\u201dThen he continued to talk to Jing Yuanzhou. \u201cI can play support without staying at the bottom. I can follow the jungler to gank.\u201dJing Yuanzhou hummed before asking, \u201cWon\u2019t you feel tired following the jungler around the map?\u201dLin Yan thought about it and felt it was a bit reasonable. \u201cThat\u2019s true. If I have to run around the map anyway then it is better to hold the knife in my hands.\u201dHe showed the jungler mark on the BP interface to show what he wanted to play.The two of them had good luck. The players they teamed up with for two consecutive games were reasonable players. There was no position grabbing. The desired positions were successfully taken and the game officially started.There was nothing special at the start. Lin Yan was usually easy-going when he played jungler. At the beginning of the game, he was generally too lazy to invade the opposite side\u2019s jungle. After confirming that the other jungler had no intention of invading, he scanned the monsters regularly.On the map, he could see Jing Yuanzhou opressing the opposite player as usual. Usually, there would be an outbreak of blood decreasing by now. However, it could be seen that the blood of the other player was still in a relatively healthy state.Lin Yan felt it was weird. Then he heard Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice in the headphones. \u201cBe careful of the opposite jungler. We should be matched up with people from PAY.\u201d\u201cPAY?\u201d Lin Yan heard these words and quickly came up with two names in his mind. \u201cDeMen and AI?\u201d\u201cYes, I am pretty sure it is DeMen on this side road.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t stop his operation as he paid attention to every detail of the opponent. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, he should be lining up as a pair with AI.\u201dHe paused before adding, \u201cThey should\u2019ve recognized me as well.\u201dThe conversation was passed through the headphones to the live broadcast room without any omissions. The originally lively barrage paused for a moment before exploding.[Fuck, matching with DeMen and AI? Are the ranking points of these two people already so high?!][This isn\u2019t the point! The coach is just playing jungler for fun in this game. What should he do when he encounters an emotionless machine like AI?][Wuuuu, I regretted not seeing the peak match between Titans and DeMen. Is God helping me realize my dream now?][What peak match? DeMen can\u2019t beat Titans, okay?][That was previously but it isn\u2019t necessarily the case now. Titans was willing to play in the secondary league for so long. Who knows if his strength has deteriorated or not?][Deteriorate? You are the paralyzed one!][The key point is wrong! Clearly the key point is that AI is the opposite jungler! Dangerous! Big danger!][It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just a casual game. If you lose then you lose.][In other words, Titans and the coach don\u2019t need to feel too much pressure. Just play casually.]The sunspots who had been afraid to speak up previously finally came out.[Hey, what type of warmth is being sent? Didn\u2019t you say that GH is capable of rivaling professional teams? Now you are counseling them?][That\u2019s right. Your Titans is so godly. So what about the people of PAY? Isn\u2019t the goal of the GH team the world championship?][I think Titans really isn\u2019t capable anymore so he looked for the secondary league to act pretentiously. Why else would BK not want him?][The entire Internet ridiculed GH as not having enough strength for a reason. Lie down and let AI abuse you.][I just wanted to say, you bragged about weak people and now you can\u2019t pretend to be pretentious, haha.][Titans is now weak. It\u2019s you brainless fans who haven\u2019t realized it.]The people came to say a few words and were soon banned by the housekeepers. However, Lin Yan had a hunch and had been paying special attention to the barrage. He had already seen everything.\u201cIsn\u2019t it normal to match against professional players in the Glory competition? There is nothing to be nervous about.\u201d He smiled slightly and spoke slowly. \u201cEveryone, do you think it is strange that our team broadcasted collectively today? The reason is to respond to certain comments on the Internet. GH is indeed the first team to be promoted through a variety show but this shouldn\u2019t be why we are questioned. I won\u2019t mention the strength of my players here. As long as you have seen our live broadcasts then I believe you will intuitively experience it. As for Titans\u2026\u201dAt this point, he paused and his eyes narrowed slightly. \u201cAs everyone knows, our club spent 35 million to bring him over. It\u2019s really hard to say that BK doesn\u2019t want him. Still, since some people are questioning it, they should watch this game closely. I believe you will soon know if Titans has become stronger or weaker.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had long been accustomed to the contents of the barrage but he hadn\u2019t expected Lin Yan to suddenly say this. He instinctively glanced sideways and saw this person\u2019s eyes shining with a rare fighting spirit. His mouth uncontrollably curved up as if infected by this person.Then he would win this game.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe PAY team\u2019s base.DeMen sat upright at the computer table and spoke to AI in the team voice chat. \u201cThe opposite side is Titans.\u201dHis voice was calm and sophisticated. Although it was a reminder, it didn\u2019t disrupt the rhythm of the operation at hand. AI had just cleaned up the monsters in the lower half of the jungle. He heard these words and his hand on the mouse slightly paused. \u201cIs he alone or lined up as a pair?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know this.\u201d DeMen glanced at the heroes used by the other players and frowned. \u201cI haven\u2019t been paying attention to GH and I can\u2019t see it.\u201dAI hummed. \u201cIsn\u2019t this good. You said that after BK changed their top laner, you felt that the match was lacking some interest. Now that you\u2019ve met Titans in the game, take the opportunity to enjoy it.\u201dThen he asked symbolically, \u201cDo I need to stay away from the road and leave the space to you?\u201dDeMen didn\u2019t answer directly and instead marked the map with a sign. \u201cGet ready to catch him.\u201dAI wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201dIt was well-known that PAY\u2019s top laner DeMen entered the league in the same year as Jing Yuanzhou. However, the two men\u2019s experiences were very different.When Jing Yuanzhou was a newcomer who was criticized by the media for being too independent, DeMen had already perfectly integrated into the team and accompanied PAY to one victory after another. They were both new players so they would inevitably be compared.Looking back now, how outstanding was Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s personal strength and how eye-catching was DeMen\u2019s team play?However, Burning Hot was a team game after all. At that time, the entire circle was more optimistic about DeMen who was a team player. No one thought that after BK\u2019s defeat, Jing Yuanzhou would choose without hesitation to transform. Then he reached the top of the world in one fell swoop.Against such an overly bright light, DeMen naturally appeared a lot bleaker. In fact, there was no shortage of people who felt that DeMen was born in the wrong era. If he had been staggered with Jing Yuanzhou for a year or two then his name wouldn\u2019t be in such an embarrassing situation between silence and glory as it was now.Currently, there were five phenomenal demon king players in the Burning Hot League: side lane player Titans, jungler AI, mid-laner Luni, shooter Wuhoo and support Come.Originally, perhaps there should\u2019ve been a place for DeMen.Lin Yan already understood all the top players in depth from the moment he prepared to start the club and he naturally knew that the god-level side laner player of PAY was absolutely powerful. However, now it was a passerby game and his side lane player was Jing Yuanzhou.n The two of them had already fought countless times in the league and this was just adding one more to the sum.He felt reassured about Titans facing DeMen. Currently, Lin Yan was more concerned about the opposite jungler, AI. This phenomenal-level jungler was the same as his ID and had the ability to absolutely co-ordinate the entire field. It was rumored that AI was as precise as an artificial intelligence, whether it was choosing the jungle route or ganking.The live broadcast room was still discussing what he just said but Lin Yan didn\u2019t get distracted any longer. Instead, he recalled where AI last appeared and made a signal on the map. His tone was plain and flat. \u201cThe opposite side is ready to target you.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201dLin Yan told him, \u201cDon\u2019t retreat and fight with them. I\u2019ll ambush back.\u201dJing Yuanzhou agreed. \u201cOkay.\u201dThe scene in the live broadcast room showed two side laner players facing each other and ready to fight. They were too familiar with each other but since there had been no contact in the mid-season, there was a sense of tentativeness in the laning process.Looking at previous matches, it wasn\u2019t difficult to find that Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s style of play during laning was often radical. It was due to the team\u2019s cooperation that he would always maintain a strong pressure while remembering to leave an absolute retreat for himself.Yet at this moment, DeMen had an indescribable strange feeling and his eyebrows slightly twisted. It was obviously still the familiar style of play, but he didn\u2019t know why he felt that it was a bit different from Titans who used to play for BK.DeMen lowered his head, glanced at AI\u2019s location and temporarily put away his doubts to scan the distance between the two of them. Jing Yuanzhou was pressing him very tightly and he had a bit of a loss when it came to health, but this gave the jungler a very good ganking opportunity.\u201cFight!\u201dSeeing Jing Yuanzhou take a step to the right, AI hiding in the grass jumped forward without warning like a wolf feeding on prey. The moment they met, he used a set of skill combos and damage exploded. It could be seen that Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s health was rapidly declining.The sudden change didn\u2019t disrupt his rhythm. He retreated while using skills to cut the health of AI, the weak defense jungler hero, by nearly half. Seeing that Jing Yuanzhou had plans to retreat, DeMen quickly followed and the two people were tangled up again.Under the fierce confrontation, the first head was about to occur. Just then, the three people fighting and retreating passed by the grass in the left rear. Before the big knife in DeMen\u2019s hand fell, a thin figure suddenly flashed out and stopped right in front of him.This brief dizziness provided an opportunity for Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s escape.DeMen obviously hadn\u2019t expected the opposite side\u2019s jungle would actually ambush in such a tricky position. It happened that at this time, his big move was just upgraded and he used an extreme operation the moment the dizziness ended.After a single accumulation of energy, the roaring energy blade headed toward Jing Yuanzhou whose health was almost at the bottom. Once hit then he must die on the spot. However, the Lin Yan who was close to him used a short displacement skill at the same time.He moved a short distance and his landing point just narrowly passed by the energy blade. After touching the first target, there was unsurprisingly a huge amount of damage. However, the damage of this ranged skill was weakened.This block gave DeMen an ominous feeling. Sure enough, once the blade hit the second target Jing Yuanzhou, the output wasn\u2019t enough to take away the last amount of Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s health. AI\u2019s skill was evaded with Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s fine movements. He smashed the ground to help Lin Yan complete the deceleration and returned to the tower with only 8 points of health left.On the other hand, Lin Yan had triggered his character\u2019s red blood state after taking the damage from the big move just now. His attack speed increased and he entered the final harvest mode. DeMen only had a bit of health left and was the first to hand over his head.[First Blood!]The remaining two assassin junglers fought each other and finally died together.[Double Kill!]Lin Yan looked at the computer screen in front of him with some approval. As expected of the top players, they were really talented. The confrontation on the road just now looked thrilling but in fact, it only took half a minute. However, it was enough to make the live broadcast room boil over.[Fuck, I knew that the coach\u2019s jungler was good but I didn\u2019t expect it to be so good?!][Isn\u2019t the jungler on the opposite AI? Is it definitely AI? Is it real or fake?][It is said that the side laner is DeMen. The moment Titans\u2019s identity was found, he found the jungler to catch Titans. It must be lining up as a pair!][My mother, you really showed me some face! In particular, the one that helped Titans\u2019 block the skill just now, it was too detailed!][This is why I said that the coach and Titans are true love.][I have one thing to say. If you meet someone willing to help you block a big move then you should marry him.][I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re excited about. He just luckily happened to wait there and fought a wave. It isn\u2019t like they won.][Don\u2019t you know what AI\u2019s jungler level is like? Now watch him be played and cry in the jungle, haha.][That\u2019s right, Coach. Are you still watching the barrage? It is really true that dogs can\u2019t spit out ivory from their mouths.][Yes, be careful in the jungle. AI can really do anything!]Lin Yan glimpsed the barrage while waiting for his resurrection and replied, \u201cYes, I know. Let him come.\u201dHis tone was lazy and didn\u2019t have much ups and downs. It was because his tone was so calm that the arrogance instantly became heavier.The entire live broadcast room was instantly covered with [666].There were also sunspots who came out. [You are still pretending to be awesome. You will cry later!]On the other side, the two newly resurrected men walked out of the high grounds again. DeMen asked as he rushed to his lane, \u201cThat jungler just now\u2026 is it a GH player?\u201dAI thought about it. \u201cI remember that GH\u2019s jungler is a newcomer. This jungler has a strong awareness and feels like a veteran.\u201dDeMen frowned. \u201cThen which team is that jungler from?\u201dAI was silent for a moment because he didn\u2019t know how to answer. \u201cAt present, I can\u2019t see who the style looks like. In short, be careful. I will try it again.\u201dIf it were just a simple anti-gank then it could just be a coincidence. However, the position of the grass where the other side ambushed was really too great. It was obviously the result of careful consideration. It was as if the other jungler had long guessed there would be such an ambush.It was this point that made AI uncertain about the identity of the opponent for a while. He could only temporarily narrow the scope to a few professional players. However, the collisions that followed caused all his assumptions to be overturned one by one.AI looked at the avatar on the statistics list with a deep look, in his eyes. This jungler was probably not any player he knew. His consciousness was much stronger than all those people.As everyone knew, the jungler was the only existence that didn\u2019t need to be tied to a lane and it played a vital role in controlling the team\u2019s rhythm. As the current league\u2019s well-deserved top jungler, AI had won the title of \u2018jungle area artificial intelligence\u2019 due to his perfect gank layout every time.However, in this game, there were some problems with passerby teammates who couldn\u2019t keep up with the rhythm but the opposite jungler seemed to see through AI\u2019s planned route and could always accurately obstruct his perfect gank.It wasn\u2019t just that. He usually liked to classify his own territory as the opposite jungle area but he never once caught sight of the figure he wanted to catch no matter where he waited. From investigation to anti-reconnaissance, everything was first-class. His ganks failed one after another. This useless work was undoubtedly very scary for a jungler.The game was continuing but AI couldn\u2019t wait for it to end. He wanted to go out and see who the opposite jungler was.Lin Yan had been a tactical analyst for two generations and naturally reached the pinnacle in terms of combat awareness. He might not have studied this god-level jungler in advance but he quickly inferred movement route predictions through the gank rhythm of the early stage of the game and the positions of the passerby to show the perfect anti-gank play.However, it wasn\u2019t just AI who was sighing at Lin Yan\u2019s keen judgment. Lin Yan was actually somewhat cursing in his heart. It was worthy of someone who was called a phenomenal player along with Jing Yuanzhou. The entire rhythm of this AI jungler was really too fast!Almost every minute and every second continued the follow-up layout, putting Lin Yan under a tight rhythm throughout the entire process. In order to avoid being led by the rhythm of the other side, he didn\u2019t dare relax for a moment.There was almost no opportunity to breathe throughout the entire game. All this was still under his unilateral defense. He wasn\u2019t ready to actively organize an offense. The rhythm was too tight and the pressure it brought was obviously huge. This was just an ordinary glory game and the sense of oppression was so strong. If it was changed to officially meeting PAY in the arena\u2026Lin Yan\u2019s lips couldn\u2019t help tightening and he had two thoughts. First, he never wanted to meet this jungler AI again. Secondly, the subsequent training plan had to be arranged as soon as possible. He needed to prepare more.He complained in his heart while saying, \u201cHurry up.\u201dJing Yuanzhou paused slightly before replying, \u201cOkay.\u201d10 minutes later, the game ended. The total time was 45 minutes and it had gone into the late stages.Fortunately, the team members didn\u2019t fail Lin Yan\u2019s strict defense. In addition, Jing Yuanzhou gradually opened the gap with DeMen and this allowed them to trade three for five before finally reaching the high ground.[Victory!]It had been a long time since Lin Yan had carried out so many sophisticated calculations in the game. He let out a long exhale and couldn\u2019t help reaching out a hand to rub his temple. \u201cI\u2019ve only heard about it before. Now I know that AI being called an artificial intelligence is really not for nothing. Does he usually play games like this? I am so tired after such a game. Doesn\u2019t he feel tired at all?\u201d[Hahaha, you have to feel the machine jungler to understand.][Ai still hasn\u2019t taken off in this game. Coach, if you have time then go and see how he flies around the entire field!][The five great demon kings are called that for a reason. This question has been asked in an interview before. According to AI, he belongs to the stream of consciousness jungler and isn\u2019t tired at all.][Look at the coach struggle. Titans, aren\u2019t you going to comfort him?][Ahhhh, the opposite jungler is really AI! He suppressed AI\u2019s jungler!][What nonsense about suppressing! Running around the map and avoiding the other side\u2019s ganks, is this called suppression?][Hey, if the above person is so capable then go and try! Why act pretentiously here?][Aren\u2019t I telling the truth? What do you want to infer from a passerby game? Won\u2019t it be PAY abusing them once it is on the field?]Lin Yan\u2019s eyes fell on this sentence and he remembered something. \u201cRight Titans, open the data of this game.\u201dJing Yuanzhou knew what this person wanted to do without asking and directly clicked on the statistics interface in a cooperative manner.The game was over so they could see the game IDs of both sides. As previously speculated, the opposite side was indeed PAY\u2019s DeMen and AI, At this point, under each ID was the total data in the game clearly listed. In the data comparison, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s output and economy were obviously much higher than DeMen.Lin Yan glanced at it with satisfaction. \u201cAre those people who jumped out still here? Now that the data is released, shall we take a look? The two side lane heroes in this game don\u2019t have a suppressing relationship. The comparison is very objective. Forget the question of who is stronger between Titans and DeMen. From the performance just now, I will say that Titans is undoubtedly the top side-laner player. It shouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration?\u201dThen he laughed. \u201cOf course, if people insist on being blind and can\u2019t see such big data then I understand. After all, it isn\u2019t easy to be a brainless sunspot.\u201dThe sunspots lurking in the live broadcast room and waiting for an opportunity to move, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dFuck, why was this man still thinking about them?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Under normal circumstances, Lin Yan should indeed be ready to rest. Yet at this time, he just slightly frowned as he felt his overall mental state. He felt that his ability to bear it had indeed improved a lot and decided to try forcing himself again.Therefore, after thinking for a while, he replied, \u201cQueue!\u201dJing Yuanzhou paused slightly. Then there was slight consternation and some questioning in his eyes. Lin Yan knew what this person wanted to ask and raised the corners of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not tired. I want to queue up with you a bit more. Two more games.\u201dThe barrage in the live broadcast room was suddenly attracted.[Fuck, Coach, are you really so direct?][I can read this sentence as: I like to be with you\u2026 while ranking?][I admire it. I also want to have a boyfriend who can play games.][It is okay to queue for a while. I haven\u2019t seen it for a long time!][Coach, you really aren\u2019t thinking about opening a live broadcast room? I\u2019ve almost become your technique fan.][Raise my hand. I\u2019m not like you. I\u2019ve always been a loyal face fan!][The Parents CP is such a fairy love. I\u2019m a fan of the two of you. I can not only support my CP but also learn technique, perfect!]Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze swept over the barrage and he quietly hid the smile in his eyes. In the blink of an eye, he entered the queue again. In the next two games, there were no passerby kings or professional players. The two of them played the side laner and jungler and there was basically no pressure to win.Seeing the enemy crystal that was crushed again, Lin Yan took a deep breath. He was just wondering if he should play another game when the mobile phone on the computer desk vibrated twice. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to accept the team invitation from Jing Yuanzhou and picked up the phone to take a look.It was a WeChat message from Luo Mo. [Boss, are you at the base? Can you take a look at BB\u2019s live broadcast room?]The team had just won the championship of the variety show and Luo Mo was currently registering the team\u2019s professional qualification at the Burning Hot headquarters. However, the event of GH collectively live broadcasting had spread. The staff of the league paid a bit of attention and happened to see a certain Trash Talk King beating frantically on the edge of the line. As a result, the eyes of the staff helping with the registering became a bit wronged towards Luo Mo.There was a feeling of vigilance in the scrutiny. There was no way. Luo Mo had to send a message to Lin Yan for help.Lin Yan naturally knew the manager\u2019s important itinerary this afternoon and didn\u2019t dare ignore the reminder. He frowned slightly as lowered the headphones to around his neck and looked around. From his perspective, Bi Yaohua\u2019s entire face was blocked by the screen. He could only see half of the colorful peacock head, ostentatious and eye-catching.In the training room, apart from the sound of the keyboard, only a few people occasionally communicated. In the midst of this, Bi Yaohua\u2019s cold remarks one after another were particularly prominent. The current Bi Yaohua could be said to be trying his best to endure, but he looked like he might explode at any time.This somewhat surprised Lin Yan. Bi Yaohua might usually not control his mouth but in fact, there were few times when he showed his emotions excessively.Jing Yuanzhou noticed Lin Yan\u2019s movements and looked over. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThere was still a voice connection and Lin Yan didn\u2019t want to say anything during the live broadcast. He saw that Jing Yuanzhou was still wearing headphones and brought the microphone closer to his mouth, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m just a bit tired. Let\u2019s stop here for today. I have to go do something else.\u201dJing Yuanzhou nodded. \u201cYes, go ahead. I\u2019ll queue up a bit longer.\u201dAfter Jing Yuanzhou re-entered the queue, Lin Yan sent a message to Luo Mo that said: [I will go now.]Then he exited from the current live broadcast page. He switched between a few interfaces and directly entered the live broadcast room of Bi Yaohua. He removed the soundproof headphones around his neck and put on light earbuds.As stated before, everyone in GH was going to show their strengths in the live broadcast this afternoon. Presently, Jian Ye and Gu Luo were a team and Bi Yaohua and Chen Yushen were a team.Lin Yan had just entered the live broadcast room when Bi Yaohua\u2019s disdainful voice entered his ears. \u201cIsn\u2019t it like I said? Roser is really weak on the side lane. There is a reason that QOG barely made it into the quarterfinals this year. It is just these few players and he can\u2019t even play well in the rankings. How can you expect him to achieve good results in the professional league? Every year, he is content to qualify for the quarterfinals. It is a shame to call him a professional player.\u201dLin Yan originally wondered how Bi Yaohua could make Luo Mo nervous to this moment. Then he heard the words \u2018Roser\u2019 and \u2018QOG\u2019 and instantly understood. It turned out that he ran into QOG. No wonder. He could only say that enemies really met on a narrow road.Bi Yaohua and Chen Yushen were in the ordinary ladder mode and the game IDs of both sides were clearly displayed in the panel. At this time, the side laner and jungler on the other side were QOG\u2019s captain Rose and jungler Puga. The game had been going on for over 10 minutes. It wasn\u2019t difficult to guess that Bi Yaohua\u2019s cynicism had also lasted for over 10 minutes.Lin Yan just glanced at it while the barrage scrolled quickly.On the screen, Bi Yaohua and Chen Yushen made a special trip to the jungle to ambush the QOG jungler. Puga had just finished fighting the element monster when his head was taken away. Afterwards, Bi Yaohua didn\u2019t forget to stand on his corpse and perform a mocking laugh. Then he took the red buff and happily went back to clear the line of soldiers.At this time, Roser was still waiting to be resurrected and Bi Yaohua was leisurely interacting with the barrage.[Oh, my husband is so fierce but handsome today.][Is the Trash Talk King funny? Seeing Roser on the other side, he took the initiative to change lanes. He is ridiculing people when he can\u2019t beat them unless it is two against one?]\u201cI don\u2019t acknowledge a relationship without receiving the certificate thank you.\u201d Bi Yaohua spoke casually. \u201cHave those who are helping QOG speak seen our GH captain\u2019s games? Who is afraid and changing lanes? Roser is a third-tier disabled side laner and weak is weak. Two against one is lying down and making fun of him, okay?\u201d[I\u2019ve always been curious about how QOG offended BB. It is just because last year\u2019s game wasn\u2019t played well?][At that time, they were all scolded like this by the Trash Talk King and it has continued after so long. The miserable are really miserable.]Bi Yaohua sneered. \u201cIt is miserable after just two sentences? If you are so full of sympathy then why don\u2019t you spare me your scolding? Take a look at yourself before you talk about others. Who is more noble than anyone else?\u201d[Oh, don\u2019t quibble. This incident only shows that the Trash Talk King has no distinction between friends and enemies. His teammates might become exes at any time.][BB is a proper scumbag in a romance drama.][Currently it is GH\u2019s jungler teaming up with him. Be careful! Once BB retires, QOG\u2019s today is your tomorrow hehe.]\u201cI\u2019m sorry, don\u2019t compare people of the underworld to my current teammates. I advise you, the entire QOG team has too much yin energy. Don\u2019t waste your previous yang energy. It really isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d[Hahaha, can this be understood as this idiot caring about us?][Why aren\u2019t you scolding GH\u2019s jungler? This jungler is not a good bird.][Speaking of which, GH really isn\u2019t picky when recruiting people. There are all types of goods. It is really convincing.][It is seriously the toxic team, haha.]Bi Yaohua smiled coldly. \u201cIt is as if your bird is a peerless treasure. You are speaking in such a lofty manner, do you go to the bathroom with those things that grow in your mouth? Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t smell so bad the moment it opens and closes.\u201d[Hehe, do you think you are so awesome just because you won in a variety show?][Since QOG isn\u2019t good, I would like to see how many rounds GH can survive in the fall season.][You say that QOG isn\u2019t good but can GH do it? What are you laughing at?]Bi Yaohua wasn\u2019t in a hurry to respond. He glanced at the map and gave Chen Yushen a signal. The two people left the lane and ran from the top lane to the bottom lane. The moment they arrived, they happened to encounter Roser who was trying to change lanes to avoid them. Unsurprisingly, they released their output the moment they saw him and once again took a head.Apart from anything else, if Bi Yaohua wanted to vent his anger then he could really cause damage. After disrupting the opposite rhythm, he abused them badly. This also made the data of the two people from QOG extremely ugly.Bi Yaohua completed another killing and slightly pulled up the corners of his mouth. \u201cRegardless of whether we can do it or not, we will still be better than QOG. Do you see this 0-8 statistic with the top lane? Nothing else? Your courage is really admirable. However, I suggest you go to the hospital for an appointment with the ophthalmology department. If the ophthalmology department isn\u2019t good, you should go and check your brain. I\u2019m afraid you will have trouble if you are late.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the first time that Bi Yaohua fought with everyone in the live broadcast room. Not only did it not affect his gameplay, it also made all the black fans in the live broadcast room angry. The barrage became even crazier in an instant and some people threatened to report him.Lin Yan saw up to here and naturally knew why Luo Mo had come to him.Bi Yaohua might\u2019ve perfectly avoided swear words during the live broadcast but almost every sentence stepped on the illegal line. It wasn\u2019t serious enough to be severely punished but a fine was unavoidable.Lin Yan\u2019s eyes fell on the men on both sides of the battle. Looking at the QOG duo who died so many times that they almost become super ghosts, Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help smiling. Rather than coming forward to stop it, he watched on with interest.He had to say that Luo Mo\u2019s sincerity was wrong.Lin Yan might not support the players testing the league\u2019s bottom line but he didn\u2019t recognize QOG, a scumbag team with no professional ethics. In any case, Luo Mo was in charge of the subsequent public relations matters and Lin Yan was happy to let Bi Yaohua fly. After all, from his subjective point of view, it was really refreshing to let the Trash Talk King fight.The QOG duo were quite calm at first until Chen Yushen completed his sixth solo kill in the jungle. The jungler Puga finally couldn\u2019t stand it and started typing on the public chat. [GH, don\u2019t be too arrogant! You just got the qualification for the competition. Why act so crazy. Don\u2019t run to the autumn competition if you have the ability!]Lin Yan burst out laughing. It was no wonder why the two people of QOG didn\u2019t dare shout despite dying like dogs. It could only be said that compared with Bi Yaohua, their speaking skills were simply at the level of a primary school chicken.It was right not to open their mouths. They would probably have to suffer double the crushing the moment they opened it. Sure enough, Bi Yaohua\u2019s reply appeared on the public chat. [There is no need to run. This autumn competition isn\u2019t so lucky. I will send you home before the quarterfinals.]Puga: [It is just a careless start that made us lose our rhythm. I grabbed a new hero to practice as jungler. This gave you the chance to pretend.]Roser: [That\u2019s right. Don\u2019t brag too much! A variety show team should first worry about how to keep the position!]Bi Yaohua: [Haha, aren\u2019t you guaranteed to fall to the relegation list?]The QOG team were still worried about being punished by the league. On the other hand, they really couldn\u2019t beat Bi Yaohua when it came to scolding. After a few words, they completely fell silent.Five minutes later, the game was over and the MVP was undoubtedly Bi Yaohua. However, the attention of the live broadcast room was on his \u2018crazy words\u2019 just now.[BB is so confident after entering GH? He wants to take QOG out of the quarterfinals?][Don\u2019t say anything else. QOG might not be strong but every season, they can survive until the quarterfinals.][A player is acting so arrogantly. Isn\u2019t GH\u2019s management going to come out to shut him down?][I used to see online that GH has really swelled up. Now I find that they are really inflated.][QOG is right. It is almost certain that they will be relegated in their first season of the professional league. Is it necessary to act like this?][One can brag better than the other. Making QOG fall to the relegation? Why don\u2019t you just say that GH will be the champion this year?!][Wait, I\u2019ve already taken a screenshot of what he just said.][They recruited a player who can do things like this. I wonder if the management can smile after seeing today\u2019s live broadcast.]Bi Yaohua was happy with himself and never worried about the words of the black fans on the live broadcast. He only hesitated a bit when he saw the last barrage. Previously, he was just a personal anchor and didn\u2019t need to think too much. However, he had promised the coach to control himself today. As a result, he met QOG and forgot everything. He didn\u2019t know if he would\u2026The moment when Bi Yaohua fell silent, a row of flashing golden sentences suddenly appeared among the barrage.[Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Nothing to Do with BB.][Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Nothing to Do with BB.][Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess has thrown 10 deep-water fish mines in the live broadcast room of Nothing to Do with BB.]In front of these too overbearing messages, the frequency of the black fans\u2019 messages paused. Even Bi Yaohua\u2019s first reaction to this ID was shock. He hadn\u2019t felt this way in a long time. It was like he was preparing to touch the cheat sheet when he encountered the invigilator passing by\u2026Bi Yaohua tried to hide it by clearing his throat. Before he could say a few words to save himself, he saw Lin Yan\u2019s ID \u2018Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess\u2019 issue a high-profile message: [GH\u2019s management does feel ashamed of BB\u2019s behavior just now. How can he say that QOG will fall to the relegation? This is indeed not careful.]Someone on the barrage was excited and gloated: [Hahaha, BB is done. Your leader is here.]The next second, Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess continued: [If you want to fight then just fight to disband them.]The barrage paused strangely before it was covered in question marks. Was the manager of GH sure there was nothing wrong with this style? What did he say?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe live broadcast rooms in the afternoon were unusually lively and the main hero was Lin Yan, the club\u2019s management. After successfully blowing up the sunspots in Bi Yaohua\u2019s live broadcast room, he seemed to fall in love with this feeling. He went to the other players\u2019 rooms to send a bunch of deep-water fish mines.Finally, he didn\u2019t forget to return to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s room and stroll around there in a high-profile manner.[6666, the coach is here to send pocket money!][Titans, come and see. It turns out this is the feeling of being kept!][Fuck, Coach Lin is actually so rich?]Jing Yuanzhou had just come out of playing a game. He noticed the notification banner and a smile flashed in his eyes. He usually didn\u2019t have the habit of thanking people for rewards but this time he spoke out loud, \u201cThank you Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess for the deep-water fish mine.\u201dSuch details made the CP fans quickly send messages on the barrage. At the same time, they saw Jing Yuanzhou skillfully adding Lin Yan as the room management.[Is there the sense of welcoming his boyfriend to come do the rounds at any time?][Above person, how do you know what\u2019s in my mind?!][Don\u2019t say anything else. I feel like Titans has no more passion after Coach Lin left.][Yes, the regular ranking game was only 10-1-3.][This isn\u2019t a normal play.][By the way, I want to make a small report. Coach, look at me. Just now, an anchor tried to hook up with TItans.][I want to help clarify. Later Titans didn\u2019t accept the friends request!][Hahaha do you know what the coach did just now? He went to the live broadcast rooms of the other GH players and blew them up!][??? Let me go and see it?][I have become back. Titans really has vision! I\u2019m afraid that Coach Lin is a wolf!]Jing Yuanzhou noticed the content of the barrage so he turned off the microphone and looked sideways. \u201cWhere did you go just now?\u201dLin Yan answered very casually. \u201cNowhere. Just sending some pocket money in advance as comfort.\u201dThe members broadcasted until nearly 5 o\u2019clock.The rise of the live broadcasting industry meant players in each club had signed contracts with live broadcast platforms. Every month, they had to live broadcast for a certain amount of hours. This meant that at the end of the month, players who didn\u2019t like to live broadcast would come out to make up for the time. Procrastination was something that even top players like Jing Yuanzhou couldn\u2019t avoid.Fortunately, the length of the contract that Lin Yan helped Jing Yuanzhou negotiate wasn\u2019t that demanding. It should be done quickly with a bit of extra effort in the next two days.In the afternoon, everyone was very happy, especially with Lin Yan\u2019s assist. After the broadcast, the state of righteous indignation was swept away and they were elated. It was a pity that this happy mood belonged to others and Luo Mo had nothing.He returned from the league headquarters and placed a stack of documents on the table, his voice was business-like as possible. \u201cI have registered the professional qualification of the club here, including the certificate registration of the players. Boss, look at it to see if anything is missing. If there are no problems, I will take them back and archive them with the other information.\u201dLin Yan glanced over them. \u201cArchive them. There should be no problem.\u201dLuo Mo nodded in response. Then he paused strangely for a moment before handing the other thin envelope in his hand to Bi Yaohua. \u201cBB, this is yours.\u201dEveryone was excited at officially completing the registration to be a professional player. Now they heard these words and looked back.Bi Yaohua also looked puzzled as he reached out to take it. \u201cWhat is this? I remember that my ban is almost up. Surely the league isn\u2019t preventing me from playing in the autumn competition, right?\u201dThe moment he spoke, the surrounding atmosphere instantly became tense.\u201cIt has nothing to do with the autumn competition.\u201d Luo Mo took a deep breath, controlled his emotions and continued with a blank expression. \u201cWe have completed the formal registration in the afternoon. In view of everyone\u2019s excellent performance during the live broadcast, especially player BB\u2019s overly prominent words and deeds, the Union Notary Office has decided to formally issue a fine notice. Originally, this notice should be sent directly to the club\u2019s base. Coincidentally, I was present this afternoon. The head office saved on the postage fee and directly asked me to bring it back.\u201dLuo Mo might be speaking with an official attitude but his blank face inevitably let them see what it meant to be loveless. In the short term, Luo Mo really didn\u2019t want to go back to the league headquarters again.From the time he first entered through the door and no one knew his identity as the manager of the GH team to the thorny gazes on him when he finished the registration and went out, the ghosts knew what he had experienced!After hearing these words, everyone was quiet for a moment before bursting into laughter. Bi Yaohua\u2019s expression was also subtle for a while. His gaze swept over the envelope in his hand and he cleared his throat. \u201cDo you know what I have in my hand?\u201dGu Luo had given up trying to control the expression on his face but he still followed the show. \u201cI know! It is the glorious proof of your fight against the sunspots!\u201dJian Ye laughed hard and his bold laughter rang all over the room.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Bi Yaohua controlled the urge to rub Gu Luo\u2019s head hard and he coughed twice again to cover it up. \u201cGloy, you can see me so thoroughly. I\u2019m very pleased.\u201dThis time, even Chen Yushen couldn\u2019t help it and he gave a rare laugh. Bi Yaohua saw these gloating guys and gave up on his plan to instill the value of team friendship. He didn\u2019t say anything else and directly opened the envelope. He read the content of the fine and frowned slightly. \u201cWhat happened to the league this time? Did QOG run to fan the flames? They actually fined me so much money?!\u201dLin Yan looked at him. \u201cWhy? Didn\u2019t I give you enough rewards to pay the fine?\u201dBi Yaohua was taken aback when he heard these words before instantly smiling. \u201cIt is definitely enough! Sure enough, Coach really loves us!\u201dGu Luo hesitated. \u201cHowever, the rest of us weren\u2019t fined. We don\u2019t need the money\u2026\u201d\u201cThere is no need to return it to me. Those rewards weren\u2019t for the fine.\u201d Lin Yan waved his hand. \u201cI said earlier that you should control the scale of the afternoon live broadcast. If anything happens and you are targeted by the league then you will be responsible for the fines. The club won\u2019t care about it.\u201dBi Yaohua was confused. \u201cEh? If it isn\u2019t for the fine then why give us those rewards?\u201dJing Yuanzhou had been silent and only opened his mouth at this time. \u201cCoach Lin is sending you money for condolences.\u201dEveryone looked at Lin Yan in unison. \u201c?\u201dLin Yan met their gazes and slowly showed them a very kind smile. \u201cYes, it is money for condolences. After today, your free time is almost over. I will work out a targeted training content for the next stage as soon as possible. You probably won\u2019t have time to go out before the start of the autumn competition. Make some good adjustments tonight and jiayou!\u201dThe gentle expression, the kind words, the compassionate gaze\u2026The moment the last word was heard, the team members felt a chill go down their backs and the smiles on their faces instantly disappeared. Was he sure this was\u2026 condolences?Why did it feel more like the coach was giving them an advanced funeral fee?As a last celebration, after dinner, a few people made an appointment to go to the nearby commercial square. Lin Yan had no opinions on this. \u201cLet the driver take you there. The training will officially start tomorrow. It\u2019s fine if you come back later but don\u2019t stay out all night.\u201dThe members of GH wondered, \u201cCoach, aren\u2019t you coming with us?\u201dLin Yan took a last bite of the meal and glanced at the time. \u201cI need to make your training plan in the evening lest it be too late.\u201dJing Yuanzhou slightly raised his eyes but didn\u2019t speak.Lin Yan headed straight back to his room after dinner. He opened the laptop on the table and started work. He might\u2019ve considered it before but he had never been so eager to improve the team\u2019s strength as soon as possible.Lin Yan was well aware that it was AI he met in the afternoon who made him feel this sense of urgency. Still, this recognition obviously wasn\u2019t a bad thing.After all, the professional league teams weren\u2019t like the secondary league teams they previously contacted in the variety show. There are many strong players like AI. In addition, the autumn competition wasn\u2019t the end he wanted the team to reach. It was just one of the stops leading to the world arena. The e-sports arena had always been like sailing against the currents.During his work, Lin Yan habitually tied up the bangs on his forehead. He held a cigarette in his hand but didn\u2019t light it up. He just fiddled with it while frowning.In this short period of time, the parts that needed to be approved as soon as possible were what everyone lacked the most. For example, Jian Ye\u2019s commanding ability, Chen Yushen\u2019s jungle invasion success rate being significantly lower than AI, etc. Every time Lin Yan thought of something, he recorded it in his file.Unknowingly, time passed minute by minute. It wasn\u2019t until he heard a knock on the door that he realized it was almost 9 o\u2019clock in the evening. However, hadn\u2019t everyone gone out to play? How could they come back so quickly?Lin Yan opened the door suspiciously and saw Jing Yuanzhou standing there. He soon discovered that the others hadn\u2019t returned and couldn\u2019t help being slightly stunned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go with them to play?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m old and can\u2019t play with them, so I went out for a run.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze moved to the side and landed on the laptop screen lit in the room. \u201cHow is the training plan going?\u201dLin Yan casually rubbed his head. \u201cThat\u2019s it! I\u2019ve just determined the short-term improvement goals and I\u2019m going to determine the specific training plan later. I haven\u2019t done such an in-depth analysis of the team before. As a result, I\u2019ve found that there are many problems. The mid-season will soon be coming to an end. I don\u2019t know if there is enough time to adjust it to the best condition before the start of the autumn competition.\u201d\u201cTime is tight?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t impossible. I will look again and see if I can minimize the training cycle.\u201dJing Yuanzhou handed over the coffee in his hands and asked, \u201cSo is there anything I can do for you?\u201dThe question was decent and gentlemanly but the gaze stuck to his body had an indescribable sense of ambiguity. The moment it entered Lin Yan\u2019s ears, there was an unexplainable special meaning. It felt like the heat of the coffee was faintly burning at his fingertips and he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cYou asked this but for those who don\u2019t know anything, they might think it implies special services.\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes lowered slightly and passed over the face in front of him as he smiled. \u201cIf you want then it isn\u2019t impossible.\u201dThe lights of the corridor covered him heavily. Since he had taken a shower after returning from a run, there was still a faint wetness around his neck. The arc of the collarbone was exquisite.Lin Yan\u2019s gaze inadvertently skimmed over it and couldn\u2019t stop. His Adam\u2019s apple moved quietly. \u201cThen I\u2026 you\u2019re welcome to do so?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was just teasing with the last sentence and hadn\u2019t expected to get such an answer. His heartbeat stopped for a moment without warning.Lin Yan\u2019s fingertips holding the coffee cup tightened slightly and his tone was gone. \u201cThe team probably needs many training games in the next few days. I\u2019m not familiar with the professional teams so I have to trouble you to help ask and see which teams have the intention of making an appointment.\u201dThe surroundings became quiet the moment he spoke.Jing Yuanzhou stared fixedly at Lin Yan,. Just as Lin Yan thought this person was unwilling, he slowly opened his mouth. \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Lin Yan avoided his gaze and looked down at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Go and rest. I will go back and continue.\u201dHe paused slightly. \u201cAlso\u2026 thank you for the coffee.\u201dWithout waiting for Jing Yuanzhou to say anything, he turned around and entered his room. Behind the closed door, the sound of the opposite door being closed could faintly be heard. Lin Yan let out a slow sigh of relief. He leaned against the door and looked at the coffee in his hand in a distracted manner. Obviously, the freshly ground coffee beans had an indulgent aroma.It seemed that after the massage that night, the atmosphere between him and Jing Yuanzhou whenever they were alone would be covered with a layer of unbearable dark fire from time to time.In a brief moment of distraction, the man\u2019s sexy collarbone flashed in front of his eyes. The heat of the coffee burned his fingertips.Lin Yan raised his head and tapped on the door. Then his broad palm covered half his face. After a long time, he cursed in a low voice. \u201cFuck!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJing Yuanzhou returned to his room and stood by the bed for a while. Then he lay straight down. He had clearly just finished bathing but there was a vague heat that made him restless. He sighed slowly and grabbed his phone on the bedside table.He was considering which team to ask about a training game first when he saw an invitation to join a group pop up on the WeChat interface. The person inviting him was Luni and he was invited to join the professional player group he had withdrawn from a while ago.Luni: [Now that GH is a professional team, can\u2019t you join again? Everyone is waiting for you. Don\u2019t be shy.]Jing Yuanzhou stared at the message for a moment before finally clicking to confirm. The moment he joined the group, the chat messages that were originally beating stopped for a moment under the flexible operation of the professional players. Then words of welcome filled it.[Wow, welcome Titans back!][Welcome welcome! Since God Jing left the group, I always felt that there was something missing in the group. Now I finally feel that our group is complete again!][This wave of flattery is 666. Does your captain ignore you when you talk like this?][Hey, Titans is Titans. you say you will quit the league and you quit the league. You say you will come back and you came back. I\u2019m really convinced.][This chicken side laner is coming online humbly. I finally got a break in the mid-season but I feel like I\u2019ll be calling someone Dad again in the autumn competition.][What will happen to DeMen if you speak like this?][The variety show is really good-looking. I went to watch replays later. It is really good.][Don\u2019t you have to train tonight? Why are you all chatting here?][Shh\u2014! I\u2019m taking advantage of the captain\u2019s absence to play a bit.]Jing Yuanzhou casually watched it and sent a smiling emoji in the group. Then he stopped paying attention. He opened the group list and started to look through it.This group of professional players had been created relatively early and several of the more established teams in the league were in it. Some people had proposed to add new teams in the league in recent years but promotions and relegation were too frequent every year. In order to avoid the embarrassment of someone being relegated to the secondary league in the future, they just kept it undisturbed like this. The main theme was naturally internal harmony. After all, these teams could be considered friendly teams with a good relationship. It saved a lot of constraints when playing around in private.Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t cared much about this decision previously but now that he thought about it, this deed indeed avoided the participation of teams like QOG. He looked around and found it a bit troublesome to ask them one by one. Therefore, he simply messaged Luni who was the group\u2019s management. [Help me @all members.]Luni sent a question mark. He didn\u2019t know what was going on but he did it obediently. Before long, everyone bubbled up again.Seeing the question marks issued by the bigshots in each team fill the screen one after another, all the players who just talked shut up one after another out of fear that the waves in the group were too much and they would be caught by their captains during this crucial period of the mid-season.For a while, the chat became a communication area only for the team captains. Jing Yuanzhou was very straightforward.GH \u2013 Titans: [You are all here so it is just right. I want to ask, is there any team that would like to make an appointment with us for a training match after the mid-season?]LDF \u2013 Luni: [???]Rather than asking directly in the group, he quickly followed up with a private message. [Titans, what do you mean? Don\u2019t you want to fight us?]Jing Yuanzhou comforted him. [Does your LDL want to monopolize GH? If not, I will ask a few more teams to take turns. Will it affect you in any way?]Luni: [\u2026I hate it!]Jing Yuanzhou laughed but didn\u2019t intend to say anything else to comfort this person. He cut back to the other group. At this time, the members of various professional teams had already expressed their opinions.BK \u2013 Luuu: [BK can do it. Just call us whenever you want to fight.]BK \u2013 Mini: [Master, I have become a lot stronger recently. I will show you my performance when the time comes!]UL \u2013 Ball: [This is just right. God Jing, we haven\u2019t started the arrangement for the training matches yet. We can discuss it.]Three \u2013 Wuhoo: [Is this true? Wait for me to ask the coach later.]Three \u2013 Come: [I am also interested in GH.]Three \u2013 Wuhoo: [Let\u2019s make an appointment anyway. It is just a training match anyway. It is the same with anyone.]LDF \u2013 Luni: [#smile.jpg]UL \u2013 BALL: [Luni, why are you smiling in such an irritating manner?]LDF \u2013 Luni: [Those who understand will understand #smile.jpg]Jing Yuanzhou ignored Luni\u2019s apparently resentful smile and returned the messages of the others one by one. Just then, someone pinged him in the group.PAY \u2013 AI: [The one who teamed up with you this afternoon is your team\u2019s jungler? @GH \u2013 Titans]The moment this ID came out, people appeared to take a screenshot.[Wow, God A has appeared. I\u2019ve received a vision from heaven tonight!][What team up? Did Titans and AI meet today?][What is the situation? AI is paying attention to another jungler?][The first wonder is AI appearing in the group chat. The second wonder is AI actually being interested in other junglers?][Isn\u2019t any jungler a corpse in the eyes of artificial intelligence?][Oh my god, I can actually see God AI chatting in my lifetime! I have been in this group for two years and I thought this WeChat account was cancelled!][Two years? I haven\u2019t seen it in three years\u2026]Don\u2019t blame these players for being so surprised and finding it strange. After all, it wasn\u2019t just the jungler gameplay. AI was like an artificial intelligence in day to day life as well. He didn\u2019t show much interest in anything except daily training. Forget chatting in the group. Since joining this group, the number of times his profile pic was seen could barely be counted. Even Jing Yuanzhou retiring from the group last time failed to bring this cold man out.It was also because AI was barely involved in social communication. He might be a top player in the league but the captain of the PAY team had always been DeMen. It was just that DeMen was already at the age of retirement. It wasn\u2019t known what type of weather PAY would usher in after the identity of captain fell on AI.Jing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t expected AI to look for him. He was astonished but then he thought about it. In the afternoon, Lin Yan had played so well. It wasn\u2019t surprising that he would attract the attention of this jungler king.GH \u2013 Titans: [No.]PAY \u2013 AI: [?]GH \u2013 Titans: [It was our coach.]PAY \u2013 AI: [???]PAY \u2013 DeMen: [His awareness is so strong yet he isn\u2019t a player?]GH \u2013 Titans: [I know what you want to say. In fact, he can play professionally any time if he wants. He just has no plans to do so now.]GH \u2013 Titans: [So is PAY considering playing a training match with us?]PAY \u2013 AI: [Will the coach play?]PAY \u2013 DeMen: [\u2026\u2026]GH \u2013 Titans: [What do you think?]PAY \u2013 AI: [Yes.]PAY \u2013 AI: [Okay, there is nothing wrong with playing.]PAY \u2013 DeMen: [\u2026\u2026\u2026]GH \u2013 Titans: [What does DeMen say? You are the captain.]PAY \u2013 DeMen: [AI said to fight so fight.]Jing Yuanzhou got a satisfactory answer. He was ready to end the conversation when he saw Luni suddenly send a message in the group. [Titans, GH currently has only one person in the group, right? Why don\u2019t you bring in your coach? Won\u2019t it be more convenient to schedule a training match?]As a senior manager of the group, Luni naturally had a certain right to speak. Although this group was initially all professional players, some people retired and moved behind the scenes. Therefore, there were indeed some people who were now members of the coaching staff of various teams.The suggestion was largely because Luni was curious in Coach Lin but overall, it was indeed not inappropriate.Jing Yuanzhou replied: [Wait a minute, I\u2019ll ask.]Luni was happy. [How come I didn\u2019t see you listen so obediently to the coaching staff when you were in BK?]Jing Yuanzhou was noncommittal. He found the pink star on the WeChat list and sent a message.Lin Yan was quick to reply. [Professional player group? What teams are in there? If QOG and SUU are there, I won\u2019t join.]Jing Yuanzhou raised his eyebrow slightly.He naturally knew why Lin Yan had a hostile attitude toward QOG but SUU was a team that just emerged in the past two years. The biggest impression was that the boss was super rich and recruited a lot of foreign players. When did such a team offend Coach Lin?Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t ask much and his fingers tapped the screen. [No, it\u2019s just the old teams you have been thinking about for a long time. I have already mentioned the training matches. You can make an appointment with them at any time if you join.]Lin Yan heard him say so and answered very simply: [No problem, pull me in.]Jing Yuanzhou sent the group chat invitation. Moments later, the people in the WeChat group saw a new member joining. The newcomer quickly changed his nickname and made a chat bubble on the screen.GH \u2013 Coach: [Hello everyone, a newcomer asking for protection~ #smile,jpg.]GH \u2013 Titans: [Welcome #fresh flowers.jpg]For a long time, the hand speed of the professional players seemed to fail completely. The entire chat channel seemed like time was frozen, focused on the two sentences of these people. The eyes of the professional players were fixed on the pink starfish profile picture and then moved down a bit to see SpongeBob\u2019s wretched smile.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t have the habit of changing his information. The people in the group naturally recognized this yellow and eye-catching profile picture that was completely inconsistent with his personality.Suddenly, there was a matching picture. Since when did Titans use a matching set with others? What was this? Was it the legendary love brain?!After a few seconds of silence, the screen turned into a baptism of ellipses. They were shocked, dazed and more puzzled. At the same time, they felt the struggle of discovering an earth-shattering secret but not daring to say anything.Someone really couldn\u2019t hold back. In the blink of an eye, he pulled a few people and opened a new discussion group.[What is the situation? Is this why Titans went to GH?][I said at the time that how could such a great god run away. Look look, this is the truth!][Career is precious but love is more valuable? I\u2019m in tears. This is worthy of Titans. So bold!][When did Titans start using this profile picture? Have they been together for so long?!][Shh\u2014! After all, it hasn\u2019t been made public yet. Just know it by yourself and don\u2019t say anything.][Don\u2019t worry, public and private matters will stay where they belong. We are professional players and must have this quality.]Jing Yuanzhou received a private chat message from Luni at the same time. [Last time, you said you wanted me to beat you up on the show. The person you wanted to coax at the time\u2026 is it your coach?]Jing Yuanzhou answered with great honesty. [Yes, are you jealous?]Luni covered his chest. [\u2026Get lost.]The author has something to say:The e-sports circle: A sudden earthquake?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 66.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe mid-season was in full swing. After the fierce competition from eight to four, the four teams of LDF, SUU, Three and PAY successfully entered the semi-finals. Apart from the three veteran and powerful teams, the SUU team that introduced foreign aid this year became the strongest dark horse of the season.The most regrettable one was the BK team. Due to their poor state in a crucial game, they finally lost to LDF and became the only veteran giant team to miss out on the semi-finals.This premature elimination inevitably made fans on the Internet explode. The biggest target was undoubtedly the newly promoted player, Lan Min. The bad comments on the Internet were overwhelming but there were still many rational voices mixed in.In the mid-season, some people had already found that it was Lan Min\u2019s transition period. They also saw BK\u2019s increasing tacit cooperation and found that everything was developing in a good direction. Despite the temporary loss, many BK fans were full of anticipation for the autumn competition.Jing Yuanzhou called Ku Tianlu and the other person didn\u2019t sound too depressed. \u201cThere was no way. LDF just hit too hard. I really wonder if you have offended Luni. He kept catching your apprentice on the field and beating him up. I couldn\u2019t bear to see it.\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought about it. \u201cWhat could I do to offend Luni?\u201d\u201cHow would I know that? Captain Jing, shouldn\u2019t I be asking you?\u201d Ku Tianlu sighed before comforting himself. \u201cStill, it is okay to be eliminated at this time. In any case, we are already the runner-up of the spring competition and the ticket for the global qualifiers is in our hands. The mid-season is just an extra event without a recommended place for the World Championship and it is really of little significance to us. This is just an early liberation. The team still needs more cooperation and we can use this extra time to actively prepare for the autumn competition.\u201dJing Yuanzhou wondered, \u201cHave you figured out how to prepare?\u201dKu Tianlu just wanted to answer when he paused and remembered something. \u201cHave you been waiting for me to say this? Just talk directly. We have no matches anyway so there is a lot of time.\u201dJing Yuanzhou was polite and conveyed the wishes of the coach. \u201cIf you have no arrangements later, please make an appointment for a training match.\u201dKu Tianlu had already guessed it and answered very simply. \u201cNo problem. You set the time.\u201dLin Yan had formulated targeted training plans for the players, most of which were training content to strengthen their individual strengths. Only Jian Ye\u2019s team command ability needed to be accompanied by all the members to improve.In the past few days, in addition to special training, everyone in GH had been teaming up day and night. Seeing that the BK team was eliminated, Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help his eyes lighting up and he eyed them directly. There was nothing better for improving global awareness than a training match against a professional team.At 2 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, the two teams went online for the scheduled training match. Before entering the professional league, GH players didn\u2019t have an official server account so the training match information was leaked in the normal custom mode. Such a mistake naturally wouldn\u2019t happen again.The club was registered and the official accounts had already been applied for. Everyone in GH finally logged into their team account. Jian Ye was thinking about the previous leakage of their training match results and he repeatedly confirmed it as he entered the room. \u201cThe login is correct and the server is definitely correct, right?\u201dBi Yaohua held back his smile. \u201cGo away! Why do I feel like you\u2019ve prematurely aged? Old people like you nag so much.\u201dJian Ye\u2019s reply was impolite. \u201cGet lost.\u201dThe opposing BK team also entered the custom room one after another. Seeing that everyone was here, the training match officially began. Lin Yan stood behind them with his notebook. He pressed the record button and walked back and forth, observing the team\u2019s battle.The focus of today\u2019s training match was naturally the rhythm of Jian Ye\u2019s command. In the past few days, Lin Yan had been trying to instill a view of the overall situation into Jian Ye whenever he had time and it could be seen that the results were indeed remarkable.The moment the game started, everyone in GH had a series of clashes with BK. Jian Ye\u2019s methodical details didn\u2019t allow BK to get the slightest benefit. Once Jian Ye was in charge of commanding, Jing Yuanzhou was completely released on the road.Lan Min might\u2019ve grown a lot during the mid-season but the master was the master after all. In the process of leaning, he was unavoidably beaten up. He finally had to hide under the defense tower and didn\u2019t dare come out.Unlike other side lane players who were motivated, Lan Min was convinced by Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s skills and this meant he didn\u2019t do stupid things. Jing Yuanzhou still had spare strength to invade the wild area after pushing the lane. He caught Ku Tianlu several times with Chen Yushen and the rhythm of the GH team was completely up.In the first training game, GH won. Back in the custom room after the game, Ku Tianlu couldn\u2019t help feeling admiration.BK \u2013 Luuu: [It\u2019s amazing. I haven\u2019t seen you in a while. How did your team improve so fast?]GH \u2013 BB: [It is a long story but I can make it short.]BK \u2013 Luuu: [I\u2019m listening?]GH \u2013 BB: [In a word, it is the credit of our coach.]BK \u2013 Luuu: [\u2026]GH -Titans: [There are two more games. Let\u2019s get started.]The training match had three games. Since the two sides were friendly teams, the purpose of today\u2019s training match wasn\u2019t for victory or defeat so according to the previous agreement, three games would be played regardless of the score.In the second game, Ku Tianlu suddenly exerted his strength and carried out various ganks in the middle lane and bottom lanes. Finally, he took BK to victory. In the third game, the situation was reversed again.Chen Yushen deeply observed Ku Tianlu\u2019s jungler habits in the first two games. Rather than relying on his own positioning, he tried to ambush in the opponent\u2019s jungle area based on his own understanding.Jian Ye\u2019s command ideas had been instilled by Lin Yan these days and the lesson of the last game was learned quickly. In the middle of the game, he keenly seized an opportunity for a team battle. After the BK team was annihilated, the economic gap between the two teams immediately opened up.At the end of the three games, the GH team became the winner with a score of 2:1. On the whole, Lin Yan was quite satisfied with the players\u2019 performance today. At the very least, the training conducted in the recent period had achieved significant results.The only drawback was that many details were still a bit inadequate compared to professional players. Although compared to the past, the general rhythm of the team had been mobilized after they gradually adapted to the habits of their teammates and their tacit understanding in team battles had improved a lot, but there was still more room for improvement.Moreover, the players of BK were still affected by their loss in the mid-season. Today\u2019s overall state actually wasn\u2019t good. Their team should win more simply if it went according to Lin Yan\u2019s ideal situation.After the training match, neither side exited the custom room. Lan Min hadn\u2019t spoken to Jing Yuanzhou and he obviously couldn\u2019t hold back anymore.BK \u2013 Mini: [Master, can we have a voice chat?]Jing Yuanzhou had no problems with this. In the course of the games just now, he found that his little apprentice had grown a lot but there were still many problems. He could use this opportunity to have a good chat.He was just about to agree when he felt a slight pull on his collar. He looked up and saw Lin Yan looking at him with a smile. Then Lin Yan gave a sly wink and reminded him. \u201cIf you help teach them, shouldn\u2019t there be a polite exchange?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s fingers paused on the keyboard and he immediately understood. \u201cOkay.\u201dGH \u2013 Titans: [Captain Ku, let the players in other positions also have their own voice chat?]GH \u2013 Titans: [We just finished the match and it is just right to communicate.]BK \u2013 Luuu: [O\u2026 kay?]He didn\u2019t clearly say so but Ku Tianlu naturally understood Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s meaning. He also knew that they were no longer in the same team. If he wanted a great god like Jing Yuanzhou to help guide Lan Min then the BK team should provide corresponding feedback as well.He arranged it with the other players without any dissatisfaction and added Chen Yushen as a friend. Then a voice chat room was opened alone.After knowing Chen Yushen\u2019s identity, Ku Tianlu had worried that Jing Yuanzhou would be implicated by this player. Then once the truth broke out later, he actually admired this teenager. In addition, after today\u2019s training match, he appreciated the rapid progress in the last game. The moment he entered the voice chat, he asked, \u201cCommunicate about playing jungler?\u201dChen Yushen agreed. \u201cYes.\u201dKu Tianlu wondered, \u201cIs there anything you want to ask me?\u201dChen Yushen felt a bit hesitant. \u201cAnything can be asked?\u201dKu Tianlu took out the kind tone of a senior. \u201cYes, ask anything.\u201dChen Yushen thought about the problem that Lin Yan pointed out to him and asked, \u201cThen\u2026 can you tell me how to improve the success rate of ganking in the jungle? The coach said that the gap between me and AI is still very large. I hope to raise it to at least 80% of God A\u2019s accuracy.\u201dKu Tianlu never expected that the first question when giving advice as a senior would be so far beyond his strength. His mouth twitched slightly and he almost failed to maintain his smile.Increase to 80% of AI\u2019s strength? This newcomer really dared to think about it! Every time BK bumped into PAY, it was good if he could stabilize the jungle area and not collapse!Ku Tianlu took a deep breath and answered the question as objectively as possible. \u201cJust\u2026 keep your original heart full of expectations.\u201dA question mark slowly appeared in Chen Yushen\u2019s mind. The silence in the voice channel seemed strange for a while.In the end, Ku Tianlu couldn\u2019t control his stiff mouth. He cleared his throat and changed the subject. \u201cRegarding AI, you should ask him when you are playing the training match with PAY. I have found some of your problems during the games just now. Would you like to hear them?\u201dChen Yushen answered without hesitation. \u201cYes.\u201dKu Tianlu heard this modest attitude and was a bit relieved. This year, coaching new people really wasn\u2019t easy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He waited a long time and didn\u2019t see BK\u2019s shooter. Therefore, he took the lead in opening the microphone. \u201cEh? Why aren\u2019t you talking? We said that we would discuss harmoniously after the match. Hey hey, can you hear my voice?\u201dA long time passed before a weak voice was heard on the other side. \u201cI can hear\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, you can hear me. I thought something was wrong with my device.\u201d Bi Yaohua put down his worries. He looked through the video of the game that was just recorded and sincerely asked, \u201cThen where do you think we should start the discussion?\u201dThere was the Trash Talk King\u2019s reputation and BK\u2019s shooter really didn\u2019t dare say anything. His attitude was much more docile than when he was in front of his new captain, Ku Tianlu. \u201cYou\u2026 cough, you have the final say.\u201dBi Yaohua fell into deep thought. \u201cI mainly want to know what you want to discuss. However, it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t know. I still have lots of options. So let\u2019s talk about that big move you unleashed on the soldiers at the 12th minute gank or talk about the time you confidently turned back as you crossed the tower and was killed by me? In fact, we are both professional players and have a good grasp of the details. I just think you need to work on your psychological quality. The line of soldiers was sent almost right to your face. If I didn\u2019t know better, I would think you were playing melee.\u201dBK\u2019s shooter, \u201c\u2026\u201dBi Yaohua found that he wasn\u2019t rigorous enough and didn\u2019t forget to correct himself. \u201cOh no, at least a melee has some skills. You were so scared that you were almost like a chuuni with broken hands.\u201dBK\u2019s shooter, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough he had been ready for this when Ku Tianlu said to communicate, he didn\u2019t expect that the Trash Talk King\u2019s friendly fire could be so terrible.BK\u2019s shooter inwardly thought, \u2018Wuu, Captain, is your side almost done? I want to go home!\u2019This side was bitter while the exchange between the remaining two positions was much more harmonious.One of Gu Luo\u2019s big problems was that he tended to be too aggressive in the game. Sometimes it was easy for him to treat the game as his personal stage and he frequently needed his teammates to help him out. He asked BK\u2019s mid-lander for advice on this problem.BK\u2019s mid-laner envied a talented player like GU Luo and was happy to share his experience with team battles. After the talk, he couldn\u2019t control his curiosity and asked about the secret of the GH team\u2019s rapid progress. Gu Luo didn\u2019t hide it. He simply handed over the team\u2019s internal work and rest schedule.BK\u2019s mid-laner heard it and was silent for a moment. \u201cYou deserve your progress!\u201dThis type of inhuman training intensity\u2026 survival mattered! Goodbye!As the support, Jian Ye had recently been working hard to improve his commanding ability and gained some initial success. It was rare to have such a good opportunity so he naturally asked the senior of the BK team for advice.There were actually many people in the BK team who could serve as commander. In addition to the jungler Ku Tianlu who was occasionally responsible for driving the rhythm, the command usually fell on the senior support.Previously, Ku Tianlu had specifically told the BK members to help the newcomers. At this time, he followed what happened in the training games and patiently helped Jian Ye analyze it from start to finish. It was clear how patient the support professional players were.Jian Ye listened and noted it down. In the blink of an eye, there was a densely filled document.Then he heard BK\u2019s support suddenly lower his voice. \u201cThis is the basic rhythm of the games today. Go back and take a look. By the way\u2026 I have a more personal question. I don\u2019t know if it is convenient to ask.\u201d\u201cYou say it.\u201dThe voice of BK\u2019s support lowered even more and there was a mysterious air. \u201cWhen playing this type of big-breasted healer, the visual feeling\u2026 is it cool?\u201dJian Ye, \u201c?\u201dLin Yan stood behind them. He heard the positive exchange and felt very satisfied.He would naturally conduct replays of all the training games but there were times when the opportunity to communicate with opponents was better. After all, in a game, the person who could intuitively feel the advantages and disadvantages was the person against you. Many of the details easily overlooked had long been seen by the opponents.Such targeted discussions weren\u2019t only beneficial for GH. It also helped BK, who weren\u2019t in a good state due to their mid-season loss. At least for players like Lan Min, the guidance of Jing Yuanzhou was enough to give him a lot of insights he couldn\u2019t get in normal training.Thinking of this, Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help glancing in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s direction. After Lan Min was abused by him, Lan Min officially changed his combat style. There was no denying that his style wasn\u2019t yet fully mature but his performance in the mid-season was very prominent. He and the other players of BK gradually formed a new system.This system was completely different from Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s and belonged only to Lan Min. It was precisely due to this that despite the cynicism about failing to make the semi-finals of the mid-season, many fans of BK still had expectations. They could see Lan Min\u2019s rapid growth on the field.The label of \u2018Titans\u2019 had formerly brought a heavy pressure on Lan Min\u2019s body. Once he walked out of it, the teenager started glowing and heating up uncontrollably.In today\u2019s training match, Lin Yan had already discovered it. While the other players of BK were depressed, Lan Min\u2019s play had always been extremely tenacious. No matter how much he was suppressed by Jing Yuanzhou, he always actively sought opportunities. This alone was sufficient evidence that this young player had toughness and strength despite his developed tear glands.In the future, he would grow into an opponent worthy of the attention of all professional teams.Lin Yan thought this way and was about to write in his notebook when he heard a voice enter his ears. \u201cYour master\u2019s wife? Yes, he is here.\u201dThe pen paused and he immediately looked over. The others were wearing soundproof headphones and couldn\u2019t hear Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s words. However, Lin Yan was standing behind and could hear them clearly.Jing Yuanzhou seemed to feel the gaze on his back and looked back. Judging from the expression on his face, he didn\u2019t care that he was caught talking about others. Instead, there was a faint smile on his face as he beckoned nonchalantly to Lin Yan.Lin Yan raised an eyebrow slightly. He didn\u2019t want to come over but it was such a mysterious act that he couldn\u2019t help walking over.Jing Yuanzhou silently mouthed, \u201cGet closer.\u201dLin Yan took another step forward with increased doubts. Before he could react, Jing Yuanzhou reached out a hand without warning. It touched the back of his neck and brought him closer. The arm suddenly pulled him closer and he lightly hit his wide chest. The man\u2019s sudden close breath made it inevitable for his heart to thump for a moment. Then the hair that brushed against his cheeks instantly aroused a fire.Lin Yan instinctively wanted to retreat but Jing Yuanzhou had already pulled one side of the soundproof headphones and placed it by his right ear. The sound entered his ear through this short distance.Lan Min obviously didn\u2019t know that he had been sold by his master like this and was still considering his words. \u201cI didn\u2019t know it before but now I\u2019ve found that Master\u2019s wife\u2026 I mean, Coach Lin is really good. Thanks to his last guidance, I feel that my thinking has become completely smooth. I really want to find a chance to thank him. However, every time, I become so angry that I forget about it\u2026\u201dThe young man\u2019s voice was low and he seemed to think that such words were a bit sentimental. He was embarrassed after speaking and was silent for a moment before continuing, \u201cWould it be weird to come over just to say thank you? Master, can you find time to convey it for me?\u201dLin Yan clearly heard the whole thing and was taken aback. He looked sideways right into those smiling eyes. Jing Yuanzhou pulled the microphone to his mouth with a slight laugh in his tone. \u201cThere is no need for me to convey it. My wife has already received your gratitude.\u201dLan Min obviously didn\u2019t understand. \u201cHuh?\u201dLin Yan glared angrily after hearing Jing Yuanzhou say \u2018my wife\u2019 so smoothly. He slowly moved closer, brought the microphone in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s hand to his lips and said, \u201cIf you really want to thank me, the base is almost running out of coffee beans. Pick a few flavors that your Master likes and send then to the base.\u201dSuch a move was so natural that it was only after he finished speaking that Lin Yan found the distance between the two of them was too close. At first glance, it looked like they were close together. He just had to breathe lightly and it would rub against Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s face.The moment he finished speaking, the eyes of the two people met. Without warning, different thoughts seemed to flash in the eyes of both sides and the suddenly messy heartbeats could clearly be felt through the thin clothes.Lin Yan felt like his heart was going to pop out of his chest. He didn\u2019t clearly hear Lan Min\u2019s reply. He instinctively got up and as a result, he pulled on the cable of the mouse\u2026BK\u2019s base.Lan Min was completely petrified when he heard Lin Yan\u2019s voice. Then he grabbed his messy hair. He controlled his desire to dig a hole to hide in and responded, \u201c\u2026O-Okay.\u201dHe seldom said such words of thanks and even felt numb himself. He thought that this man would make fun of him when he heard the loud sound of an object falling through the headphones. Immediately afterward, it was silent. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice was completely cut off due to this sudden change.Lan Min couldn\u2019t help freezing for a moment. \u201c?\u201dWasn\u2019t it just a promise to buy coffee beans? So excited? He sat motionless at the computer table, gently scratching the side of his face. Finally, he silently made a decision in his heart. If that person really liked it that much then\u2026 well, buy more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe GH team\u2019s training room.The excessive noise caused even the people wearing soundproof headphones to be alarmed. They looked up and saw Lin Yan stumbling over a headphone cable due to his sudden backward movement. He instinctively reached out and grabbed. As a result, he grabbed the mouse on the desktop and pulled the entire cable.As his body lost its sense of balance, Lin Yan only felt the world spin. At the critical moment, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes and hands quickly supported him but in a situation where his heartbeat was already speeding up, such a distinct skin touch made the flames burn even fiercer. He had no time to think at all. By the time he returned to his senses, he had pulled his arm away from Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s hand like he received an electric shock.In the chaos, in full view of everyone, he directly hit the armrest of the gaming chair. Bang! There was a loud sound and his forehead turned visibly red.The members of GH, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe entire process was thrilling with ups and downs. They didn\u2019t know what type of world-class action blockbuster was playing just now. Lin Yan\u2019s body was still tangled up with a few wires. The soundproof headphones that were torn off were hanging at his feet and looked somewhat funny.He lowered his head and didn\u2019t look at Jing Yuanzhou. In a hurry, he finally extricated himself and rubbed his forehead. \u201cYou go on, don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll go\u2026 find a band-aid.\u201dThen he ignored some of the subtle gazes in the training room and turned away without looking back. There was silence as his figure disappeared around the corner.Jing Yuanzhou was still maintaining the posture of reaching out to help. He glanced at his palm that was completely empty and then toward the door, complex emotions in his face. The sudden ambiguity the moment their eyes had met was hard to ignore. Some answers vaguely seemed ready.If Jing Yuanzhou wasn\u2019t completely sure previously, he could finally be sure at this time that Lin Yan obviously had feelings for him. Many small details and careful thoughts couldn\u2019t be hidden under certain circumstances. Such a discovery was exactly what Jing Yuanzhou wanted the most. He should\u2019ve been delighted but Lin Yan\u2019s response to it just now made him unable to smile.He didn\u2019t know the reason but it was obvious that Lin Yan himself seemed to be deliberately avoiding this tempting mood.Love between the same sex might\u2019ve gradually become recognized in this society but for professional players who were in the public eye, coming out would inevitably cause a lot of trouble. Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t know exactly what Lin Yan was thinking now but it would be better to deal with it if he was just worried about a public image problem in the future. He was afraid that this man was worried about other issues that had no place to go.A person who was usually so casual and spontaneous was too sensible. Sometimes this made the struggle worse. Still, thinking about it, wasn\u2019t he at least qualified to struggle now?Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t expect that he would actually have such troubles one day.Just then, Bi Yaohua turned off the sound of his headset and moved slightly closer to Jing Yuanzhou. Then in a voice only the two of them could hear, he asked cautiously, \u201cCaptain, you\u2026 did you have a fight with the coach?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t have much of an expression on his face when he answered. After a moment of silence, he slightly frowned. \u201cHowever, I really need to find a way to coax him.\u201dHe spoke very softly like he was answering the previous question, but it was more like speaking to himself.Bi Yaohua\u2019s brain circuit obviously wasn\u2019t online and he murmured, \u201cYou really quarreled\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help when it came to this type of emotional matter. Apart from silently wishing the captain good luck, he didn\u2019t forget to praise Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s attitude of \u2018no matter what the problem, it is my fault anyway.\u2019As others weren\u2019t paying attention, he secretly raised his thumb. \u201cCaptain, what a good man!\u201dLin Yan found the medicine box in the storage room, tore a band-aid and stuck it on his red and swollen forehead. It seemed like a hard hit but it wasn\u2019t that serious. He put the medicine box back and stayed a while instead of going back to the training room. He directly took out a cigarette in such a narrow space and lit it.Of course, Lin Yan had found that he felt gradual and uncontrollable emotions when facing Jing Yuanzhou recently and he also knew the reason for these emotions. It was because he was aware that his biggest thought after realizing was to go back and strangle the himself who had offered to do CP business in the past.Due to his sexual orientation, he had never rejected same-sex relationships. Jing Yuanzhou wasn\u2019t too repulsive so he naturally thought of a partner business. He just didn\u2019t expect that this would end up giving him this result.He had to say that Jing Yuanzhou was really perfect, perfect enough to almost satisfy all his daydreams of a boyfriend. Most importantly, Jing Yuanzhou was likely to be the same as him. If placed in another time and place then everything would be like Heaven. It was a pity that such a feeling of liking shouldn\u2019t appear now.Lin Yan knew himself too well. He didn\u2019t usually care much about emotions but once he was concerned about one thing, he would be completely absorbed in it. It was the case for running a team and it must be the same when managing a relationship. It could be called overly self-disciplined but it could also be called unrestrained.Lin Yan wasn\u2019t one to pretend to be shy. If he wanted to confess then he could say it at any time. It was okay if he was rejected but if Jing Yuanzhou felt the same as him, Lin Yan didn\u2019t think he could do two important things at the same time.It was hard for him to imagine how messy the distribution of his focus in life would be once he started to fall in love. The biggest fear was that in the end, one of the things wouldn\u2019t be done well.It was the beginning of the autumn competition. This was obviously too irresponsible for both the club and Jing Yuanzhou.Lin Yan leaned against the wall and slowly let out a puff of smoke. He took out the phone with one hand, habitually entered the Parents Group super topic, and looked through it. Compared with before, there were a lot more images of the two of them in the super topic. The details were very good and the unstoppable sweetness could be felt from the screen just by looking.He clicked on a few pictures at random and then pressed save. Then his gaze inadvertently moved down and fell on the latest message from a loyal fan of the super topic: [Wuwuwu, I really like the Parents love! Tell me, when will they really be together?]Lin Yan paused, bit the cigarette in his mouth with a bit of strength and murmured to himself in a low voice, \u201cJust\u2026 let\u2019s see.\u201dFor a time, the band-aid on Lin Yan\u2019s forehead became one of his unique symbols of this stage. For the GH players, they always felt that their coach exploded with great power since getting this band-aid.The original training plan already pushed them to the verge of collapse and now it was getting worse. There was almost no breathing time at all. Everyone was forced to become an emotionless training machine under such extreme pressure. It wasn\u2019t until the band-air on Lin Yan\u2019s forehead was removed that they belatedly realized it was already the finals of the mid-season.On the day of the finals, Lin Yan mercifully didn\u2019t continue to make them train. He gave GH a holiday and everyone gathered in the meeting room to watch the live broadcast. The finals of the mid-season was between Three and PAY.Since the two team\u2019s main combat cores were completely different, the result of this game was even more confusing. Three hours later, PAY won the finals with a score of 3-1. Only the cheers of the fans filled the venue.Lin Yan didn\u2019t show much interest in the following interview session. He picked up the remote control and turned off the projection. \u201cAI seems to be getting better.\u201dJing Yuanzhou told him, \u201cIt isn\u2019t surprising. PAY didn\u2019t perform well in the spring competition. They must\u2019ve released their restraint in one breath.\u201dLin Yan frowned slightly, lost in thought. Bi Yaohua was afraid he would say \u2018continue to increase training\u2019 and hurriedly interjected. \u201cIt isn\u2019t too late. I\u2019m so hungry! Should we go to eat first?\u201dLuo Mo happened to enter through the door at this time. \u201cI forgot to tell you. The cooking aunt had something at home today and didn\u2019t come. Would you like to eat out or order takeout?\u201dGu Luo blurted out, \u201cLet\u2019s eat out!\u201dLuo Mo paused and reminded him, \u201cIt is raining so badly outside. Are you sure you want to go out? Personally, it is better to order takeout and save the trouble of going.\u201dChen Yushen added in the silence, \u201cGo outside to eat.\u201dLuo Mo was stunned. \u201c\u2026If you really want to eat outside, I will call the driver to bring the car over.\u201dJian Ye stood up. \u201cNo, there are many good restaurants nearby. You don\u2019t need to drive the car. We can just walk!\u201dLuo Mo obviously couldn\u2019t understand their troublesome actions.Jian Ye couldn\u2019t help sighing deeply. \u201cManager Luo, you\u2019ve been running outside all day long. You obviously can\u2019t understand our mood of not seeing outside.\u201dBi Yaohua had already grabbed a few umbrellas in the corner in an instant and agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Don\u2019t talk about the sun. We almost forgot what color the sky is! So what if it is raining outside? It is nature\u2019s tears, the sweet dew of freedom.\u201dLin Yan looked up and glanced around indifferently. \u201cIt seems everyone has a lot of resentment about the recent training?\u201d\u201cNo, we are happy!\u201d Bi Yaohua immediately shut up and handed the umbrellas to his teammates. The umbrellas were soon handed out and it was found that one was missing.Luo Mo wondered, \u201cThere is none left? Should I go to the storeroom and look for one?\u201dAt this moment, Jing Yuanzhou stood up, took the umbrella from Lin Yan\u2019s hand and spoke calmly. \u201cNo trouble. Lin Yan and I can use this one.\u201dThe deep, magnetic voice entered his ears from behind.Lin Yan paused for a moment when he heard his name. Then he replied. \u201c\u2026That\u2019s fine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was raining heavily outside as Luo Mo said. There were many puddles on the ground that caused a lot of water stains after stepping in them. Near the traffic lights, there was an endless stream of vehicles coming and going. They could see the lights in the distance under the dim sky.Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou squeezed under an umbrella. In order to take care of him, Jing Yuanzhou obviously leaned the umbrella over to his side intentionally. Lin Yan looked sideways and could see that half of his shoulder was soon wet. Lin Yan took a glance and then withdrew his gaze. After a moment of silence, he started to stare at his toe.Despite the patter of the rain, he could still hear the shallow breathing by his side. It was obviously light enough to be ignored but it was clear as if it were extremely close. His Adam\u2019s apple moved silently.Lin Yan slowly closed his eyes and couldn\u2019t help scolding himself in his heart. He recently spent so much energy on team training just to warn himself not to be so greedy for this man. He didn\u2019t expect that a small detail like sharing an umbrella would cause him to want to relapse. The so-called male friend was just a source of disaster!Due to the rainy day, there were actually empty seats in the originally crowded restaurant. Everyone entered a box and sat down. Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou were walking at the back. By the time they entered, there were only two adjacent positions left.Lin Yan\u2019s gaze paused. He scanned back and forth several times before casually pulling out a chair and sitting down. It could be seen that the training for the past few days had really tormented everyone.As the waiters started to serve the dishes one after another, every time a bowl was served, it was like a gust of wind blew and the bottom of the bowl was seen in an instant. If someone saw this, they would think that these people hadn\u2019t been allowed to eat for several days.Jing Yuanzhou originally wasn\u2019t prepared to join the battlefield. Then he inadvertently turned back and found that the Lin Yan sitting next to him had been holding a glass of boiled water for a long time.Once the next dish was placed on the table, he suddenly picked up his chopsticks and grabbed a few pieces of meat. Bi Yaohua watched all the meat being put into Lin Yan\u2019s bowl and smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s still hard to beat the captain when it comes to hand speed!\u201dLin Yan was indeed hungry and he hadn\u2019t thought much of putting the pieces of meat that Jing Yuanzhou gave him into his mouth. Then he heard these words and choked. Once it was better, he stared at Bi Yaohua in an expressionless manner. \u201cIf you can\u2019t beat him, you can practice.\u201dBi Yaohua was silent in an instant. Perhaps he was really shocked by this sentence. The Trash Talk King was quieter than ever when eating.After 30 minutes, everyone\u2019s fighting power was finally exhausted. Lin Yan started looking at Weibo once he had eaten enough. Not surprisingly, everyone in the circle was now discussing the match between PAY and Three that had just ended.Three might\u2019ve failed to continue their glory after the spring championship but the confrontation between the two teams was too intense. Therefore, even if they lost to the PAY team in the end, normal fans expressed their support for the Three team. Only the occasional sunspots were still jumping up and down.As for PAY, there was nothing to say. In today\u2019s games, AI took the title of \u2018jungle area artificial intelligence\u2019 to the extreme. His gank success rate was as high as 78%. This not only refreshed the highest record in the league but he also achieved the record of three MVPs. He became the unquestionable best player in this match.Lin Yan continued to look through Weibo and saw the gank collection made by netizens. He watched very intently. It wasn\u2019t known what he was thinking when he saw AI\u2019s various entry angles but he frowned unknowingly.Jing Yuanzhou noticed Lin Yan\u2019s silence and slowly leaned over. \u201cWhat is it? Do you have a new idea?\u201dThe familiar voice pulled Lin Yan back from his thoughts. He looked sideways to meet Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze. Then he raised his eyebrow slightly and responded, \u201cYes, a little bit.\u201dJing Yuanzhou hummed, picked up the thin coat on the back of the chair and handed it over. \u201cWe came out to eat so don\u2019t think about official business. If you have any ideas then wait until we go back and you can continue to study.\u201dLin Yan noticed that the others were standing up and reached out to take the coat with a positive hum of agreement. As they headed back, the rain was heavier than when they came. In the distance, their entire field of view seemed covered by a water curtain. Beside him, Bi Yaohua was cursing at the ghostly weather.Lin Yan was still thinking about the idea that came to mind just now. It was just a momentary enlightenment so the entire idea seemed a bit illusory. This made him somewhat absent-minded as he walked.He was so busy thinking about things that he didn\u2019t turn around on the way back. Naturally, he didn\u2019t see Jing Yuanzhou being careful not to let him get wet. The two of them walked side by side. No matter who looked, there was a type of indescribable gentleness in this scene.The rest of GH was holding one umbrella and it was natural for them to go back faster. Seeing that the red streetlights at the intersection were starting to flicker, they hurriedly sped up and ran over quickly in the last few seconds.Lin Yan was repeatedly demonstrating the scene of the simulation battle in his mind. He didn\u2019t notice the figures in front of him who suddenly disappeared or the flashing yellow lights. He was about to move forward when he heard an abrupt cry from behind him. \u201cBe careful!\u201dBefore the voice finished speaking, he felt someone pulling him hard from behind. Immediately afterwards, his field of view spun. By the time he came back to his senses, he found he had slammed into a broad embrace. Not far away, a vehicle whizzed past. As the wheels drove past, there were large splashes of water.It could be seen that the driver was still a bit frightened. As he gradually drove away, he didn\u2019t forget to open the window of his car to shout at them from a distance, \u201cLook at the road or else you are looking for death!\u201dLin Yan saw the eye-catching streetlights and soon realized. Then he noticed their current posture. Due to the need to hold the umbrella, Jing Yuanzhou could only use one hand to wrap around Lin Yan\u2019s waist. Lin Yan was now completely trapped in this embrace.There was a moment of panic, causing him to instinctively tighten his grip on this person\u2019s clothes. At such a close distance, there was an ambiguous atmosphere despite the wetness of the rainy day.He didn\u2019t know what expression Jing Yuanzhou was making now but Lin Yan knew that his current expression must be very wonderful. Even the rain wasn\u2019t enough to wash away the dryness he felt.Time seemed to pause in this moment. After a long period of silence, Lin Yan didn\u2019t move and his grip on the man\u2019s clothes became tighter.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice came from above his head. \u201cAren\u2019t you moving?\u201dLin Yan could feel the laughter in this voice and he closed his eyes, acknowledging his fate.He took a deep breath, adjusted his mood and squeezed out a sentence. \u201cIt seems like\u2026 I\u2019ve twisted my foot.\u201dLin Yan was eventually escorted back to the base by the players. At that time, everyone in GH had already walked some distance forward. It wasn\u2019t until they received a call from Jing Yuanzhou that they found the two people were missing. They hurriedly returned only to see two figures snuggled together on the opposite side of the road. Apart from everything else, everyone\u2019s expression in that moment was really wonderful.Lin Yan returned to his room like this. The twisted foot was inevitably a bit painful but at least it didn\u2019t seem very serious. He took a slow breath, hopped into the bathroom on one foot and washed briefly. He was about to place a cushion on his chair to start work when he heard someone knock on the door.Jing Yuanzhou had obviously gone out in a hurry again. His coat was wet, not to mention his dripping paints. Even his hair had clear drops of water hanging from them, as if he had just washed in the rain. This inevitably made Lin Yan stunned.Jing Yuanzhou glanced inside. \u201cYou are still going to work like this?\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t know why but he had a guilty conscience. He cleared his throat. \u201cIn any case, I don\u2019t need to use my foot for work\u2026\u201dHe hadn\u2019t finished speaking when Jing Yuanzhou suddenly reached for his arm and helped him to the bed. \u201cBefore anything else, I will help you apply medicine.\u201dIt was only then that Lin Yan noticed Jing Yuanzhou was holding a box of ointment. He realized where this man had gone and couldn\u2019t say anything even if he wanted to refuse.Jing Yuanzhou felt Lin Yan\u2019s default agreement and was silent. He crouched down beside the bed, gently lifted the twisted foot, squeezed out some ointment and gently rubbed the ankle.Lin Yan had previously experienced Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s massage techniques. Now it was much more gentle, probably due to his injury. It was just that this made the atmosphere become more and more ambiguous. As his skin was rhythmically stroked, the ointment that should be cold felt like fire when it touched him.Jing Yuanzhou was half kneeling in front of him. From Lin Yan\u2019s perspective, he could see the extremely sexy outline of the collarbone from the slightly open neckline. His gaze moved further up and he saw the raindrops hanging from the hair slowly slide down the curve of the face and finally gather at the lower jaw to become a seductive point.This entire scene made Lin Yan a bit lost for a while. He stared at Jing Yuanzhou steadily like this until he felt the uncontrollable heat intensify in his body. His Adam\u2019s apple moved violently and he finally had to reach out to stop this person.Before this, even Lin Yan hadn\u2019t expected that one day he would be directly aroused by a man\u2019s simple touch. However, before he had time to push away Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s hand, he was grasped around by the wrist by the other person. Just like his fingertips, the man\u2019s palm was amazingly hot.The moment it touched his skin, all the scorching heat was completely transferred to Lin Yan\u2019s hand. Before Lin Yan could speak, Jing Yuanzhou had already raised his head and met his gaze. \u201cLin Yan, I think we should probably talk.\u201dHis voice was a bit different from usual. Perhaps it was due to the tension but it was tight and a little hoarse.Lin Yan\u2019s eyes flickered when he heard the words. Although they hadn\u2019t said anything yet, Lin Yan knew it the moment Jing Yuanzhou spoke\u2014this thin layer of window paper was going to be broken.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A long time passed before he sighed. \u201cLooking at your attitude, it seems you don\u2019t want to talk?\u201dLin Yan felt like Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s breath was blowing against his heart. He had still been thinking about how to guard against this person but now he inexplicably felt that there was nothing wrong with confessing to each other.\u201cNo, it is fine to talk.\u201d Lin Yan glanced at his wrist that was still being held by Jing Yuanzhou and muttered, \u201cLet go first.\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled softly and obediently took back his hand. However, the hand that was retracted was placed back on his ankle. It resumed the ambiguous movements just now and continued to massage the ointment.In this way, the evil fire that had just been suppressed started to run rampant again. The atmosphere that had already calmed down became filled with ambiguity in an instant.Lin Yan was sure that Jing Yuanzhou was absolutely doing this deliberately. He gritted his teeth and asked without a smile, \u201cJing Yuanzhou, can I understand that you are nervous? Deliberately using this behavior to make me happy\u2026 have you ever thought about what if I don\u2019t appreciate it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked up at him. \u201cYou will appreciate it.\u201dLin Yan was choked up by such a sentence and finally couldn\u2019t help clicking his tongue. \u201cThis type of overconfidence is indeed your style of doing things.\u201dJing Yuanzhou heard these words and paused his massage for a moment. There was a moment of silence before he said, \u201cIn fact, I\u2019m not that confident.\u201dHe thought about it and added, \u201cAt least, I\u2019ve never been able to figure out what you are thinking in your heart.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t answer. He instinctively wanted to grab for a cigarette, only to find that there was nothing in his pocket. Jing Yuanzhou noticed Lin Yan\u2019s movements and took out a box of cigarettes, handing it to him. \u201cDo you want to smoke?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s gaze paused for a moment. Then he reached out and pulled one out. Rather than lighting it up, he rubbed it repeatedly in the palm of his hand. \u201cI won\u2019t smoke.\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t ask much and took back the cigarette box. The surroundings became quiet again. In such an atmosphere, Lin Yan pinched the cigarette butt in his hand and changed its shape. It seemed that this action wasn\u2019t enough to vent the emotions currently surging inside him. He sent it to his mouth and it shook up and down as he spoke. \u201cThen what do you think?\u201dThe moment he asked this, the undercurrents that had been surging between them for a while was brought into the light. For these tacit things, it was too hypocritical to continue hiding them. It was better to be direct and honest.Lin Yan didn\u2019t say it but he couldn\u2019t help muttering secretly in his heart, \u2018We are both adults. There is no need to learn from children and play some silly confession game.\u2019The heartbeat itself was a physiological reaction. The only certainty now was that the two of them were indeed aware of each other. According to Lin Yan\u2019s meaning, even the sentimental confession sections could be completely omitted.After all, if he and Jing Yuanzhou really wanted to get together then they might explode on the spot. The thing they were originally lacking wasn\u2019t \u2018you and me\u2019 but how to properly arrange things in the next period of time. The real problems were always more difficult to deal with than the emotional part.Lin Yan thought that Jing Yuanzhou was a senior god approaching the age of retirement and should have the same worries about the team\u2019s development. He didn\u2019t expect that after staying silent for a moment, Jing Yuanzhou also pinched a cigarette in his mouth and spoke in an extremely serious voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t considered anything apart from the fact that I definitely like you.\u201dI definitely like you.Just these words made Lin Yan almost smash his cigarette. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt was really hard for him to connect such excessive love with a man who was so self-controlled. At first he was a bit stunned. Then the words started to replay in his mind like they were on an infinite loop. His heartbeat was out of control.Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help swearing in his heart. \u2018Fuck, I thought we could skip the sentimental confession stage. He suddenly played with me like this!\u2019The most important thing was that Lin Yan discovered he actually really liked this\u2026Under the indoor lighting, Jing Yuanzhou noticed the unusual blush on Lin Yan\u2019s face. A smile flashed in his eyes and he deliberately made his voice a bit lost. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking anymore? Don\u2019t you like me? Is everything just my wishful thinking?\u201dLin Yan saw all the changes in this person\u2019s eyes but he jumped straight into the trap despite seeing through it. He took a deep breath and didn\u2019t avoid the question. He simply and concisely replied, \u201cI like you. There is no wishful thinking.\u201dThe moment he spoke, he felt Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s fingertips on his ankle squeeze slightly. Then it quickly loosened as if afraid of accidentally causing him pain. Such a small detail made Lin Yan\u2019s mouth uncontrollably curve up in a smile as he saw Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s forced calm expression.In the past few days, apart from the usual training time, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s attention had always been on Lin Yan. Originally, he had prepared many things in advance for today\u2019s conversation. He never expected that Lin Yan would express his feelings so directly.The thin window paper that was one-sidedly broken was torn open all at once. It was too unexpected and all his preparations seemed useless.Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s Adam\u2019s apple moved and he controlled the impulse to push this person onto the bed. One thousand words were restrained to a few sentences. \u201cYet you\u2019ve been hiding from me like this. What are you worried about?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t your problem. It\u2019s me.\u201d Lin Yan was silent for a moment before grabbing at his hair. \u201cThis team was formed by me and I have to be responsible for all of you. When there is no way to deal with two important things at the same time, I think normal people will choose to deal with the ongoing thing first.\u201dIt was very concise and made Jing Yuanzhou instantly understand. From the moment Lin Yan intentionally avoided contact with him, he had actually guessed this was a possibility. Still, he couldn\u2019t help being a bit dumbfounded once he heard it directly. \u201cThis is why you are sacrificing me?\u201d\u201cHow can you say I am sacrificing you? It is obviously for you.\u201d Lin Yan glanced at him and every word was clear. \u201cHow many years can a player have a professional career? Jing Yuanzhou, how many years do you have left?\u201dThe expression on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s face gradually became restrained after this sentence. A complex emotion hit his heart. This was accompanied by a gradually warming heartbeat that made him want to pull this person into his arms.Lin Yan\u2019s words were extremely sensible and objective. Perhaps from the identity of the team owner and coach, all these considerations were understandable. However, Lin Yan didn\u2019t realize that in his view of the situation, every final point was a consideration for Jing Yuanzhou.23 years old, it was an age where one might retire at any time. Compared to dreams, whether you liked a person or not was something that could be temporarily endured. However, could a person really stand it?Lin Yan saw Jing Yuanzhou remain silent and felt a sharp pain in his heart. He was about to say something when he saw Jing Yuanzhou suddenly stand up and throw the cigarette aside. Then without warning, he leaned forward.Lin Yan\u2019s heart jumped and he instinctively retreated. In such a position, he naturally had to fall straight on the bed. The light in front of him suddenly dimmed and Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s figure was above him. His back was to the light and his face was in the shadows, so Lin Yan couldn\u2019t really see it. Two hands were on both sides of Lin Yan and a hoarse voice was hard. \u201cYou haven\u2019t tried it. How do you know there is no way to deal with it?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s eyes shook slightly. Jing Yuanzhou stared into Lin Yan\u2019s eyes and tried to control his emotions so they didn\u2019t leak out too much. \u201cOf course, if you are really worried then it doesn\u2019t matter if we don\u2019t fall in love.\u201dHe paused before adding, \u201cHowever, we can always confirm the relationship first right?\u201dLin Yan was already very parched. Then he couldn\u2019t help being stunned by the last sentence.He was shocked that someone could have such shameless logic and met Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes. \u201cDetermine the relationship first and then fall in love? Jing Yuanzhou, are you inviting me to get onto the bus first and then buy the ticket?\u201d\u201cAs long as you remember to buy the ticket, I can do it.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou answered calmly. Then he thought of a new term that sounded quite academic for their future mode of getting along. \u201cFor two months, let\u2019s treat it as a \u2018pre-association\u2019. Now that we know each other\u2019s hearts, it is absolutely impossible to pretend that nothing has happened, at least in my opinion. Instead of meeting each other awkwardly, it is better to adapt to this mode of getting along before we officially fall in love. At that time, you will find that everything isn\u2019t as complicated as you think. Do you agree?\u201dHis tone was so gentle it was almost coaxing. In particular, the tone of the last three words were low and gentle and they stroked at his hot earlobes. The words of refusal were stuck in Lin Yan\u2019s throat and could no longer come out. In the end, he couldn\u2019t resist avoiding Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s deep gaze and gritted his teeth. \u201cSo why is it two months?\u201dThe attitude of not refusing directly made the joy in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes more intense. He leaned toward Lin Yan\u2019s ear. \u201cBecause this is the maximum I can endure.\u201dThe words seemed like crazy talk and he laughed. \u201cOnce the time comes, whether you want to continue or not, I will make you admit it!\u201dThe sudden action made Lin Yan unable to react for a while. It wasn\u2019t until the hot breath touched his earlobe that his body shook instinctively. He lay flat and his feet instinctively wanted to curl up. However, he was forced to stay where he was due to Jing Yuanzhou pressing against his body.The man\u2019s low voice entered his ears. His face suddenly burned red.Lin Yan\u2019s mouth slowly tightened upon discovering such embarrassing details. He lowered his eyes in an expressionless manner and narrowed then when he saw Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s smile. Seeing that Jing Yuanzhou was about to get up, he suddenly reached out a hand without warning.Jing Yuanzhou obviously didn\u2019t expect Lin Yan to abruptly act and he was directly pulled down without any precautions. Their lips hit each other hard in an instant.The fierce and dazzling kiss was full of revenge for that \u2018ridicule.\u2019 They completely fell and the two people rolled around on the bed.After the deep kiss, their breathing was disordered like the messy clothes on their bodies. Residual heat surrounded them.Noting Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s deeper gaze than before, Lin Yan endured the pain from his hurt ankle and wiped the aftermath of the kiss from his lips with his thumb. \u201cWhat are you looking at? Isn\u2019t it a pre-association?\u201dHe worked hard not to make his voice too hoarse. \u201cThis is the interest for the next month or so.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The mid-season had officially ended. They all knew that they would soon be engaged in training day and night. Everyone was resigned to their fate.Gu Luo saw Lin Yan limping and asked in a concerned manner, \u201cCoach, is your foot okay?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d As Lin Yan spoke, Jing Yuanzhou next to him had already pulled out a chair and he sat down nonchalantly.Bi Yaohua was directly opposite him. After hearing the movement, he raised his head. From this angle, he glanced at Lin Yan\u2019s cracked lip and couldn\u2019t help pausing in the act of delivering food to his mouth. Immediately afterward, he glanced at Jing Yuanzhou in a meaningful manner.He moved the corners of his lips but eventually held back the words that reached his lips and silently retracted his gaze. He still cherished life more than satisfying his overflowing curiosity.However, it was clear that he wasn\u2019t the only one who discovered this detail on Lin Yan\u2019s face. Jian Ye had been frantically looking at the overall situation in training lately. At this time, the control of the key points was almost accurate.Jian Ye didn\u2019t think as much as Bi Yaohua. He looked at Lin Yan doubtfully and asked a question. \u201cCoach, what\u2019s wrong with your mouth? Didn\u2019t you twist your foot yesterday? Did you hit other places at that time?\u201dHis way of caring was also very practical. \u201cIf you really feel uncomfortable then you must tell me. I have learned a bit about falling and can help you take a look at any time.\u201dThe others were obviously a bit surprised that Jian Ye had learned how to fall but their bigger focus was the content of his words. No matter how you fell, you wouldn\u2019t crack your lip, right? As their eyes fell on the area, Lin Yan happened to hear Jing Yuanzhou let out a slight laugh beside him.He coldly glared sideways and pressed his lips together tightly. \u201cNo need.\u201dJing Yuanzhou smartly controlled the expression on his face and intimately handed a bowl of soup to Lin Yan. He didn\u2019t forget to help explain very kindly, \u201cDon\u2019t think too much, your coach is okay. It\u2019s just that he finally got a good rest yesterday. He was a bit excited when he went to bed and couldn\u2019t control his posture, so he knocked into the table beside the bed.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe really believed too much in this man. How could he think that Jing Yuanzhou would kindly explain? Knocking his lips against the bedside table? What type of special posture was so amazing? However, Jian Ye never doubted the captain\u2019s words. He was shocked and a bit guilty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry Coach. I always thought that we were the most tortured ones during the training pressure. I didn\u2019t expect that your pressure was so great?\u201dLin Yan\u2019s mouth twitched slightly.The more Jian Ye thought about it, the more he blamed himself. \u201cDon\u2019t be too excited when you go to bed later in the future. Take it slowly or it won\u2019t be great if an accident happens again. Don\u2019t worry, we will work hard to complete the training in the future, so you can set aside more time to sleep and have a good rest.\u201dLin Yan squeezed the chopsticks in his hand tightly so he didn\u2019t stab this person to death.Throughout the entire process, Bi Yaohua had been burying his head and eating silently. Now he heard this and his entire body trembled uncontrollably. It was obviously hard for him to bear it.Gu Luo was a bit stunned at first but he finally reacted after Jian Ye showed his heart. He caught a glimpse of the smile on Lin Yan\u2019s face and instinctively felt cold. Before Jian Ye could continue to challenge the coach\u2019s bottom line, he hurriedly pulled at Jian Ye. \u201cBrother Gun, stop talking so much and eat quickly. We can start training after we finish eating!\u201dJian Ye thought for a while and found that he was right. Therefore, he took his attention away from Lin Yan, not knowing he had just turned around in front of the gate to hell. Lin Yan\u2019s mouth twitched and he was ready to rearrange the training plan for the afternoon when a pair of chopsticks suddenly appeared in front of him.Jing Yuanzhou placed a piece of meat in Lin Yan\u2019s bowl and silently blocked his mouth. \u201cTry it, this meat is good.\u201dLin Yan stared at this man who acted like it had nothing to do with him. Finally, he picked up the piece of meat and took a bite angrily. Jing Yuanzhou suspected that Lin Yan was taking this piece of meat as himself and a smile flashed in his eyes.Jian Ye happened to be sitting in the outermost position. From the moment he sat down, he had coveted the meat in the corner for a long time. At this time, he was taken aback by Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s intimate action and couldn\u2019t help glancing at this side over and over.Jing Yuanzhou noticed his gaze. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dJian Ye seemed a bit embarrassed. After a moment of silence, he hinted very directly, \u201cCaptain, I also want to eat that meat.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou replied. \u201cIf you want to eat it then take it yourself.\u201dJian Ye, \u201c?\u201dBi Yaohua really didn\u2019t want to enter this invisible battlefield. However, he saw Jian Ye in such a hurry to get humiliated and couldn\u2019t help laughing.Gu Luo felt that he couldn\u2019t just watch. He didn\u2019t wait for Jian Ye to continue stepping on the mine so he took his bowl. \u201cBrother, do you want to eat meat? How much do you want? I\u2019ll grab it for you.\u201dOnly Chen Yushen didn\u2019t know what was going on. His gaze shifted between everyone and he frowned in a puzzled manner.In the blink of an eye, Lin Yan ate a whole piece of meat. He filled his stomach and finally felt like a lot of the anger was gone. He took a paper towel to wipe his mouth and announced today\u2019s schedule. \u201cHave a full lunch. Then we will continue the training in the afternoon. This stage will end around 4:30 p.m. Then adjust your state and prepare for the training match in the evening. Later, I will go and see which team is suitable. If LDF has time then we can try playing a few games with them.\u201d\u201cFight with LDF at night?\u201d Gu Luo gulped at the thought of playing against Luni but there was eager excitement in his eyes. \u201cCan you make an appointment?\u201dLin Yan smiled. \u201cIt depends on whether LDF is willing to accept my terms or not.\u201d\u201cLet them accept\u2026 our terms?\u201d Gu Luo thought he heard it wrong. \u201cCoach, are you sure you didn\u2019t mean the opposite?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t the opposite.\u201d Lin Yan looked at him. \u201cHow many teams do you think are waiting to play training matches with us right now? It isn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that there are more teams looking for us to play a training match than those looking for LDF.\u201dChen Yushen didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cSo many teams are looking for us?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Lin Yan smiled. \u201cIf you really want to say something, thank AI.\u201dThe mid-season was officially over and the focus of all professional teams was transferred to the autumn competition.For the teams in the professional league, GH started from a variety show and they were indeed suspected of taking a shortcut. There was no record to prove their strength so they weren\u2019t the best choice for a professional team training match, just like the MEN team that had been promoted to the professional league previously. They could only find their old opponents in the secondary league to make an appointment for a training match.Therefore, Lin Yan needed to thank AI the most. He had previously thought it would be good to get two or three professional teams. As a result, AI\u2019s sudden appearance in the group chat and his words caused the other captains to feel curiosity about their team.After all, it was a new team and there was too little information about GH online. So none of these clubs knew if GH was really strong or how strong they could be. In addition, there was Titans. After leaving BK, he relied on such a variety show team to make a comeback. It was unknown if he would completely fall from the altar or enter a higher peak.Once these professional clubs started paying attention, the training match was undoubtedly the best choice for them to explore GH. Other teams thought this way, not to mention LDF.It was precisely because Luni had witnessed the rapid progress of the GH team during the show that he couldn\u2019t wait to contact Jing Yuanzhou early to make an appointment for a training match in advance.In the league, no one knew better than Luni about the terrifying growth rate of the GH team. Obviously, when other teams hadn\u2019t paid attention to the GH team, LDF had already noticed due to Luni\u2019s keen intuition that this new force could disrupt the internal balance of the league.Lin Yan actually admired the eyes of the top players. Whether it was Luni or AI, they made such a keen judgment after a simple contact. This was the reason why GH had become a sweet pastry in the eyes of various clubs when it should\u2019ve been difficult for them.Lin Yan was naturally happy to see this result. He might be grateful to the tool man Luni but this was a separate matter. Based on Lin Yan\u2019s personality, he would never miss any opportunity to gain more benefits.For example, now.During the call that afternoon, Luni listened to Lin Yan and his first reaction was exactly the same as Gu Luo\u2019s before. He almost thought he had heard incorrectly. \u201c\u2026Are you sure that in order for our two teams to play a training match, we first need to agree to your conditions?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 70.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cVery sure.\u201d Lin Yan smiled. \u201cYou should know that it is only half a month before the start of the autumn competition. However, there are too many teams in the league who want to make an appointment with us and the training match is something that can only be done with energy. It is hard to agree to everyone. So in such a limited time, I naturally have to make the best consideration for the GH team and choose the team that can bring us maximum benefits, don\u2019t you think?\u201dIt was too realistic and there was no evasiveness. Most importantly, he was very reasonable. This tone was almost like he was afraid the other side wouldn\u2019t know how popular GH was at present. He directly stuck the words \u2018league upstart\u2019 on his face.Luni almost couldn\u2019t breathe after hearing it. He could only stare at the starfish profile picture on the screen and secretly grit his teeth. Fuck, no wonder why he could get along with a man like Jing Yuanzhou! Sure enough, people married because they shared common traits. They had the same heart when playing tricks!LDF was a well-deserved giant team in the league and it had always been someone else begging them for training matches. In particular, their limelight had risen in recent years since Luni took over as captain. Since when had he been so wronged?If it was any other team then Luni would\u2019ve refused without hesitation a long time ago. However, the person calling this time was Lin Yan and he had been really looking forward to the opportunity to have a positive confrontation with GH.Luni grabbed the small ponytail tied behind his head and forced himself to calm down. He opened his mouth and made his voice as calm as possible. \u201cSo you mean that after three training games, you hope that I can play three 1V1 games against your team\u2019s mid-laner?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Lin Yan was very composed. \u201cThe exchange between the two teams is mutual and you can\u2019t say that we are taking advantage. My team\u2019s Gloy might be a newcomer but there is absolutely no problem with his strength. I believe you have felt it during the solo game during the show. Regardless of personal strength, the quality gap between top players mainly lies in experience. It is this flaw that causes him to mishandle some details.\u201dThen Lin Yan let out a low laugh. \u201cIt isn\u2019t an exaggeration to say that Gloy is now better than that time. If you really try to learn from each other, I believe you will also benefit a lot.\u201dA newcomer could benefit the demon king mid-laner. This was probably something that only Lin Yan had the audacity to say.After listening to him, even Luni, the famous good-tempered gentleman of the league, couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about who will benefit. Even if I really agree to the additional condition of the solo games, aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll just choose a few heroes to deal with it quickly?\u201d\u201cI am afraid, so the sequence of tonight\u2019s training match should be determined first.\u201d Lin Yan had apparently already thought of a countermeasure. \u201cYes, we can do it so every solo game will be followed by a training game. At that time, if you play casually then we will also play casually in the team training game. In any case, it doesn\u2019t matter if we win or lose in this type of private competition. It\u2019s just a question of whether to harm each other or not! The decision is up to you. We can do anything.\u201dLuni, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWho fucking had the right to decide?He took a deep breath. \u201cOkay, wait for me to discuss it with the team members and then I\u2019ll reply to you.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t care much about this. \u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll be waiting for your reply.\u201dBefore the last word finished, Luni hung up with a blank face.Jing Yuanzhou had been listening to the whole process and he couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t know why but if Luni had a knife in his hand right now, I suspect he would directly come to our base in a car.\u201dLin Yan shrugged. \u201cCan you blame me for this? Blame Luni for being a big god who is truly attractive. If I don\u2019t find a way to make the most of it, I will always feel sorry for myself.\u201dJing Yuanzhou heard this and he couldn\u2019t hide his smile. Then he thought about it and asked the question in his heart. \u201cYou racked your brains to give Gloy a chance to fight solo. Do you really think his personal strength is comparable to Luni?\u201dLin Yan mused for a moment. \u201cIf limited to 1V1, Gloy\u2019s personal ability is indeed sufficient in my opinion. Therefore, this solo match with Luni is a test for him. If he can win all games with a score of 3:0, it means the latest training hasn\u2019t been in vain. He has handed in the perfect answer sheet for the latest training.\u201d\u201cI remember the thing you asked him to practice recently is\u2026\u201dLin Yan replied, \u201cAbsolute body muscle memory. It is a type of gameplay awareness that is detached from thinking. This will speed up the pace of all his gameplay.\u201dJing Yuanzhou laughed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Gloy will think if he knows you have such high expectations for him.\u201d\u201cDo you think 3:0 is a bit too much?\u201d Lin Yan laughed. \u201cHowever, if we want to defeat LDF in the future, Gloy is very important. Don\u2019t forget, Luni is a real team player. When it comes to the heroes both people are good at or the one-sided solo mode, this is obviously better for Gloy. If Gloy is still unable to kill Luni under such conditions, how can he respond to Luni in a team-dominated field?Lin Yan spread out his hands as he talked about this. \u201cI know that the difficulty of the recent training is indeed a bit high but I can\u2019t help forcing them. After all, it\u2019s the autumn competition soon. It is time to get ready to hand in their report cards, whether it is Gloy or someone else.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked at him. \u201cIf Luni knows you are using him as an exam question, forget cutting people. He will probably go crazy on the spot.\u201dLin Yan leaned back lazily against his chair, his mouth raised in a smile. \u201cThere is no way. The players fight on the field. The rest of the battlefield is up to the coaching staff. It\u2019s no use considering tactics only in the BP section. I have to consider all possible situations for you in advance. Otherwise, how can I be the man standing behind you as I promised, Titans?\u201dJing Yuanzhou paused for a moment before correcting it. \u201cYou can just call my name directly at this time.\u201dLin Yan was taken aback before chuckling. \u201cYes, Jing Yuanzhou.\u201dLuni had been in the LDF training room when he talked to Lin Yan. Since it was on speaker, the conversation was naturally heard by the team members.Luni noticed that gazes on him and felt like he was getting a headache. \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. The coach of GH has made it clear that he is even more a fox than Titans. He has more than one set of ideas. The most important thing is that he really dares to think such things!\u201d\u201cHe really dares to think! Who in the entire league isn\u2019t begging to make an appointment with us?\u201d The support was speechless. \u201cEven the giant teams don\u2019t dare ask Luni to sell his body for a training match.\u201d\u201cRight, why do we have to beg them to play? They are just a new team. If it doesn\u2019t work, we can change to another one! It is already giving them face that we are willing to play with them. Just look at SUU, PAY and Three. Which one isn\u2019t stronger than them?\u201dLuni frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to tell you but\u2026 it isn\u2019t a question of who is stronger now.\u201dThe vice-captain ROMM played the role of the shooter in the team and he couldn\u2019t help asking a bit curiously, \u201cAre you so persistent because of Titans? Or do you really think GH can make waves in the autumn competition?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t say specifically.\u201d Luni pondered on it for a moment. \u201cHonestly, GH had indeed won quite beautifully in Burning Hot Assembly but the level of the opponent was the secondary league. There\u2019s still a big difference in strength from the professional league. Even if they can win, they are just a bit stronger than the secondary league. According to principle, GH is just a product of the officials testing new promotion channels. However, in the few matches I watched, I got\u2026 a very strange feeling.\u201dThe support was bewildered. \u201cWhat strange feeling?\u201d\u201cThe most important thing is that it is really just a feeling. If I am forced to say it clearly then I really can\u2019t say!\u201d Luni got a headache. \u201cStill, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way. You saw it in the professional group chat a few days ago. Even AI emerged! Have you ever seen him show an interest in a team like this?\u201d\u201cThat is true.\u201d ROMM nodded. \u201cIn normal situations, PAY isn\u2019t a team that cares about others. Even if Titans comes forward, if AI isn\u2019t interested then DeMen will probably reject the invitation on the spot.\u201d\u201cSo my feeling\u2026 do you understand?\u201d\u201cI see it but I don\u2019t understand.\u201d ROMM knocked on the board. \u201cIf you want to fight then fight. Your intuition has never been wrong. We absolutely believe in this.\u201dLuni was touched by the trust of his teammates. \u201cYou guys\u2026\u201dROMM looked at him and smiled. \u201cIn any case, the one that GH\u2019s coach named for the solo is you. Captain, if you want a training match then sell yourself. I think there is nothing wrong with this logic.\u201dThe others couldn\u2019t help laughing when they heard this. \u201cLooking at it this way, there is really nothing to be worried about?\u201dAll his moved emotions disappeared instantly and Luni\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. \u201cOkay, you are really my good teammates!\u201dHe took a deep breath, opened WeChat and found the pink profile picture. A few moments later, Lin Yan at the GH team base received a new message.Luni: [We\u2019ll accept the training match. See you at 7 o\u2019clock in the evening.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt 7 p.m., the GH training room was lit up. Lin Yan had previously mentioned the LDF appointment with the players but everyone was still a bit surprised after the formal training process was confirmed. In particular, Gu Luo.Under his special care, his granny gray hair almost became bald. \u201cCoach, do you really want me to play solo against Luni?\u201dHe had played against Luni during the recording of the variety show and it had ended in a loss. Now that he had such an opportunity, he knew that Lin Yan must\u2019ve put a lot of effort into it. He might be eager to try it but he was worried.After all, they would start the formal training game after the solo game. This meant that his match against Luni would be played in front of all the players of both teams. In a way, the outcome was likely to affect the momentum of the next training match. It mattered a lot so it was difficult not to be nervous.\u201cWhat\u2019s so hard to believe?\u201d Lin Yan glanced at Gu Luo\u2019s unpromising appearance. \u201cYou not only have to fight but also have to win. Go to the bathroom and look in the mirror. Come back after you can control your expression.\u201dGu Luo looked bitter as he replied, \u201cOh\u2026\u201dHe left the training room very obediently. He came back from the bathroom and there was a thin layer of moisture on his face. He had obviously washed his face but his expression was a lot more relaxed than before. It seemed he had found a way to control his tension.Lin Yan was finally satisfied. Just then, a message arrived from Luni and he clapped his hands. \u201cThey are ready to go online. It\u2019s about to begin.\u201dAccording to the previous appointment, there would be the solo match first before the training match. Luni was a man of his word. He soon opened a custom room to pull Gu Luo in. He also offered to play three straight games directly. In this way, they could directly enter the training match after the solo match was over. This avoided the trouble of switching between two different types of competition.Lin Yan naturally had no opinion on this.The rest of GH didn\u2019t bother to take up some of the spectator seats in the custom room. They simply stood behind Gu Luo and watched the battle in real time. A circle was formed in the blink of an eye.Gu Luo who felt the gazes behind him, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe fingers on the mouse shook slightly. He slowly breathed out, trying to relax as much as possible. Once the map was completely loaded, the roles of both parties quickly refreshed at the resurrection point.Since Lin Yan had mentioned it, Luni didn\u2019t dare do anything casually in order to ensure the quality of the training games that followed. In the first solo game, he took the blue witch he was more skilled at. This hero was currently one of the solo heroes with the highest playing rate in the professional league. The main reason was her strong field control role in team battles.Since the first to fourth skill were all control skills, she was dubbed by players as the \u2018controller girl\u2019 who \u2018is control all over.\u2019 If there was anything wrong with this blue witch, it was that she lacked too much in mobility. Her four control skills caused the blue witch to not have any displacement skills. This obviously compromised her survivability.It was precisely due to this reason that there were only two situations when the blue witch faced an assassin type hero. One was to play the assassin to death using various control skills. However, if the assassin got close then she would be violently killed without any resistance at all.The blue witch in the hands of a master compared to the blue witch in the hands of a rookie could be called two completely different heroes. Obviously, Luni must be a master among the blue witch players.In this round, it was facing Gu Luo\u2019s stabbing hero Tangira and there was bound to be a direct collision. The moment the two of them emerged from the resurrection point, they headed straight to the lane without stopping.Gu Luo was a bit nervous at first but after starting to clear the lane, his eyes were only focused. Every hero must have a balance, whether it was a physical or magic. Most assassin heroes with high explosiveness couldn\u2019t avoid the limitation of a short attack distance. Tangira used in this game was the same.The moment the game started, Luni took advantage of the blue witch\u2019s long-range output to firmly block his way as he cleared the soldiers. The moment Gu Luo entered the output range, he was quickly consumed by Luni\u2019s skill. After a few waves, his health was at the lowest level. Gu Luo had no choice but to rely on his recovery skill to replenish his health.Bi Yaohua saw everything from the rear and couldn\u2019t help shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard. Luni\u2019s operation is really too detailed! The key is that he deliberately left all his skills for when Gloy went to kill the soldiers. He is determined to crush Gloy in the early stages!\u201dLin Yan wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cOnce an assassin hero kills some soldiers and develops, the blue witch won\u2019t be able to use her burst attacks to kill. If Luni wants to win, he must maximize his early advantages. It\u2019s correct to be so active at this time.\u201dChen Yushen looked worried. \u201cCan Gloy win?\u201dLin Yan smiled. \u201cJust watch and you will know.\u201dIn fact, he had been worried that Gu Luo\u2019s psychological state due to the previous finals incident would affect his play. However, based on the current situation, he had adapted very well. Luno\u2019s every skill might be extremely accurate but if one observed carefully, they would see that Gu Luo\u2019s timing was very tricky every time he went to clear the soldiers.After using a set of skills to perfectly gain some economy, he always seemed to have a bit of health decreased by Luni. However, after a wave of soldiers had been cleared, the economy and experience of both sides weren\u2019t too far away. There would be an opportunity as long as he was steady.Lin Yan smiled with satisfaction as he glanced at the blue witch. He was really curious to see if Gu Luo could kill Luni in the end. After all, no matter how much he talked big about winning the solo games 3:0, it still all depended on Gu Luo\u2019s gameplay. Luni really wasn\u2019t an easy opponent to deal with.The entire league knew that this top player wasn\u2019t focused on personal strength, but this didn\u2019t mean that Luni couldn\u2019t play solo. On the contrary, if a personal battle was really set up in the professional league then Luni would inevitably be a very troublesome existence for the major teams. It was because he was too hard to kill no matter how strong the output.If one paid attention to the statistics of the league in the past few years, they would find that Luni had the absolute lowest number of deaths among the players. Even if he was occasionally killed, it was often accompanied by the destruction of the entire LDF team rather than on his own. During the real laning process, the probability of him being killed could be called almost zero.This was definitely very scary data. If playing against LDF, even an inhuman jungler like AI would instinctively reduce the number of trips to the middle lane to gank. This was enough to show the terrifying aspects of Luni\u2019s \u2018tortoise\u2019 system.For this reason, in recent years of the competition, almost none of the opponents of the LDF team used assassin-type heroes to go to the mid-lane. After all, an assassin without any heads was just a useless existence.In this way, no matter the perspective, it seemed that Luni\u2019s existence was to naturally restrain Gu Luo, who was good at playing explosive type heroes. Since Luni was destined to be the gulf in Gu Luo\u2019s career, it was better to try his best to cross it.Lin Yan lowered his eyes slightly and hid the faint smile within them. As time passed, he could feel that on the other side, the blue witch had changed the range of his positioning. Obviously, Luni had already noticed something.If he continued to maintain this rhythm, the blue witch would become weaker and weaker when it came to the advantage of attack range. At the same time, it would soon enter the strong period of Tangira. At that time, there would be a good show.In the LDF training room, Luni was frowning unknowingly. At first, he wanted to use the pressure from the beginning to make the opposing newcomer retreat. He didn\u2019t think that instead of retreating, the other person would control the loss of health and stabilize the economic gap.He couldn\u2019t help raising his head to look at the familiar ID on the screen. He still remembered this ID from the recording scene of Burning Hot Assembly. However, the present person was completely different whether it was the details of the advance and retreat or the precision of the actions.Looking back carefully, GH always revealed a shocking new appearance every time they played a game. Everyone on this team seemed to be undergoing a transformation that could be called a rebirth.Luni stared at the computer screen and his eyes gradually became serious. A solo game wasn\u2019t like a team game. Victory or defeat often appeared in the blink of an eye. He was very clear that the key to this game was near.Just then, a beam of light appeared on Tangira\u2019s body. The moment the four skills were upgraded, the last soldier was cleared. At the same time, a figure rushed toward him like an arrow released from the bowstring.Although some of his health and mana had been restored with the help of the spring fruit behind the defense tower, Gu Luo still had around only half his health and mana left. In this state, he just needed to be controlled by Luni with one skill and the blue witch who upgraded to the ultimate skills would be able to use a set of skills to completely take away his health.This was the charm of a solo game. In many cases, the situation was like this\u2014either life or death! Luni was obviously waiting for this moment. He was prepared and wasn\u2019t panicked by Gu Luo\u2019s sudden violent attack. A blue beam of light filled the black scepter and the landing point was at Gu Luo\u2019s foot. Blue flames appeared on the ground and burned a circular totem. The imprisonment spell was about to bind Gu Luo\u2019s Tangira in place. Once hit, the winner would be decided.Luni\u2019s fingertips pressed on the release keys of three skills. Yet at this moment, Gu Luo made a short displacement with the help of the flash skill. On the screen, Tangira jumped out of the totem range and instantly narrowed the distance with the blue witch.Luni\u2019s heart jumped. The moment Tangira\u2019s sharp blade aimed at him, his fingers moved and he used his second skill to erect a high wall of flames in front of him. The flames hit Gu Luo and caused him to lose a lot of his health. Even so, he had no intention of retreating. He was the complete incarnation of an assassin willing to sacrifice his life for justice and his offensive didn\u2019t stop at all.The deceleration effect on his body completely exposed Gu Luo to the range of Luni\u2019s casting. There was no need for any big moves. The opponent just had to use an ordinary skill and it would take away the last of his health.Gu Luo firmly locked onto Luni\u2019s every move and approached again as if he wasn\u2019t aware of the state of his health and mana! Finally, the blue light on the black scepter rose again.Lunit\u2019s skill was as tricky and perfect as ever. The blue light was about to pass through Tangira\u2019s delicate body when the assassin paused for a moment without warning.He used the help of a displacement skill to retreat and then moved in an S-shape. He avoided a fatal blow while entering his skill range. Then he directly activated his big move.The onlookers shook their heads for a moment as they saw Tangira appear behind the blue witch like a ghost. The moment the black cage appeared, a bloody light filled the air. Tangira was like a ghost of death as he took away the blue witch\u2019s health.The outcome was decided!Luni saw the computer screen completely dim and silently took off his soundproof headphones. The LDF training room was silent and he could feel the gazes on his back. He let out a slow sigh. Looking at the opponent\u2019s ID on the game statistics, he showed a rare desire to fight. \u201cIt seems that the list of top players in the league will change after the autumn competition.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The computer screen was stuck on the interface where the game just finished and his mouse was still. The others didn\u2019t speak and their eyes merely rested on Gu Luo\u2019s back for a while.After a long time, Gu Luo finally came back to his senses. He reached out a hand to take off the soundproof headphones on his head. Then he looked back at Lin Yan in a still hesitant manner. \u201cCoach, did I just\u2026 win against Luni?\u201dLin Yan laughed. \u201cYes, you won.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s eyes shook and a layer of light gradually appeared in them. \u201cI really won?\u201d\u201cYes, you really won.\u201d Jian Ye standing in the back spoke with emotion while also sighing. \u201cIt is a pity that the content of the training matches can\u2019t be circulated. If it\u2019s spread out that you won a solo game against Luni, the Internet would probably explode several times, right?\u201dThe excitement in Gu Luo\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t be hidden for a while. However, it wasn\u2019t good to show it too much. He scratched the back of his head and finally smiled in a low-key manner.Just then, Luni sent another invitation for a custom room. He hurriedly recovered and pressed the confirm button. The two people entered the preparation interface again.Gu Luo thought about how he just won the previous game and hesitated over whether to say something to Luni. Then he saw the other person directly start the second game. Gu Luo fingertips paused on the keyboard as he prepared to enter. He wondered if Luni was a bit upset.Lin Yan saw through Gu Luo\u2019s heart instantly and gently patted him on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. Winning or losing is normal. Luni isn\u2019t that type of narrow-minded person. On the contrary, he should be looking forward to the next two games with you. Continue playing well.\u201dGu Luo sighed and took back his extra thoughts as he asked, \u201cCoach, what should I use in this game?\u201dLin Yan thought about it. \u201cContinue using Tangira.\u201dGu Luo thought that Lin Yan would let him try another hero. He was stunned when he heard these words but he didn\u2019t ask much. He obediently locked onto it.The second solo game officially began. Just as Lin Yan guessed, Luni didn\u2019t use the blue witch this time. He replaced it with the time and space magician Kurima. For the first time, he took out his notebook and started taking careful notes.Half a minute into the opening, the two sides collided for the first time.They were both magician type heroes but the skill range of the time and space magician was further than that of the blue witch. In addition, after the second skill was released, the mana value could be converted into a shield around the body. This allowed the hero to have stronger endurance after equipment mana recovery items. So from the very beginning of the second game, it could be seen that Gu Luo played much more passively than the previous game.Everyone at GH watched the fierce confrontation on the field. They thought that Gu Luo would repeat the last game\u2019s kill after he finished upgrading his ultimate move. Unexpectedly, in the critical fight, Luni used the shield of the second skill to block the final fatal blow. In the moment when Gu Luo was going to withdraw, a light appeared around his body.Summoner skills were special effects that existed independently of each hero. Different heroes naturally had different combinations that could be selected. For the time and space magician which was a super long range hero, in addition to flash, the player often chose to bring an extra life-saving skill. Ignite wasn\u2019t the best choice no matter how one looked at it.Yet Luni chose this configuration and it became the key to determining the outcome. The seemingly insignificant flames ate away at Gu Luo\u2019s health bit by bit.Luni\u2019s mana recovered thanks to his equipment and it slowly rose again. Seeing that Gu Luo\u2019s Tangira was about to withdraw from the time and space magician\u2019s casting range, a skill icon in a dim state lit up again due to sufficient mana. Luni didn\u2019t hesitate to use it.A dark light cut against Tangira. It didn\u2019t have much damage but combined with Ignite, it took away the last of Gu Luo\u2019s health.Luni won this second solo game very beautifully. Hs entire laning process from the timing of the skill release to the accurate calculation of damage was awe-inspiring.Gu Luo lost a game and his original joy was washed away instantly. He knew that he didn\u2019t handle the last wave well. He was a bit embarrassed to look at Lin Yan\u2019s expression. Lin Yan wasn\u2019t too surprised by this ending. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Just play well in the third game.\u201dIt was obvious that Luni took out the time and space magician after losing one game to test this hero\u2019s pairing with Gu Luo.Lin Yan gave Luni this opportunity but he didn\u2019t suffer a loss either. He collected data on the pros and cons of Tangira when facing the time and space magician. He thought about the few heroes he touched so far in terms of lineup configuration and instantly had a more complete idea.Now he gathered the information he wanted. He quickly finished writing it down and tapped the pen against the paper. \u201cFor the next round, try the flame hunting banshee.\u201dAt the start of the third game, Luni was still using the space time magician. Gu Luo learned from his previous defeat and handled the details more carefully this time while attacking. The flame hunting banshee didn\u2019t have as high an outburst as Tangira but it was extremely mobile. Her red waist swayed in the process of retreating quickly and it looked like passionate flames burning in the canyon, flying away with the wind.Gu Luo\u2019s playing style was quite detailed. The strength of the time and space magician\u2019s shield was linked to its mana value. After advancing and retreating several times to force Luni to use the second skill, the recovery of the time and space magician\u2019s mana obviously couldn\u2019t keep up with such consumption.It was under the most extreme pressure for a while and this made Luni passive. For a magic type hero, it was obviously extremely deadly to run out of mana.Eight minutes into clearing the lane, Gu Luo keenly seized an excellent opportunity. Thanks to a set of combos, the shield of Luni\u2019s second skill was played. Then he retreated in one blow. Gu Luo stepped on a soldier\u2019s body while retreating and the burning effect around his entire body triggered the moment the line of soldiers was cleared. Then he used flash and got close to Luni again.In this way, he released the ultimate move Lotus Flower the moment Luni\u2019s shield disappeared. Red flames burned in a beautiful lotus flower shape on Luni\u2019s time and space magician and all the health was emptied out.The third solo game officially ended. The final score was 2:1! It didn\u2019t meet Lin Yan\u2019s initial bragging about 3:0 but based on today\u2019s performance, the two assassin heroes were played perfectly in Gu Luo\u2019s hands.He praised Gu Luo. \u201cWell played.\u201dGu Luo smiled with a bit of embarrassment. He looked back and his gaze passed over everyone, finally landing on Jing Yuanzhou with high expectations. Jing Yuanzhou smiled when he received this gaze. \u201cIt was really beautiful.\u201dThe look in Gu Luo\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t be hidden. \u201cI will continue to work hard!\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help laughing. He almost forgot that their little mid-laner was the chief little brother fan of God Jing. He looked at the time and clapped his hands. \u201cOkay, go back and sit down. Be ready to play the training match.\u201dThey had been watching the solo games just now. If it wasn\u2019t for the reminder, everyone would\u2019ve forgotten that there was a training match. They had watched Gu Luo\u2019s performance on the field and everyone inevitably felt a bit heated up. Hearing this, they immediately sat in front of the computer and eagerly wanted to play hard.However, LDF obviously felt the same.Under normal circumstances, every big team usually retained some tactics and strength when privately engaging in a training match. Yet today, Luni had actually lost two solo games to a rookie. This made the LDF team inevitably sigh. Rather than affecting morale, they completely released themselves in the training match and played in an unprecedentedly fierce manner.Three training games ended. The result of the GH training games was 1:2.Once it was over, everyone in GH collapsed in their gaming chairs. They stared at the ceiling above their heads and it was a long time before they could recover from the bloody battle just now.\u201cThat\u2026\u201d Bi Yaohua lamented. \u201cWas LDF\u2019s previous playing style so fierce? Why do I remember that their games in the professional league are mainly focused in the middle and late stages?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled, half-truthfully and half-lying. \u201cYou remember correctly. Perhaps LDF just changed to a new style today.\u201d\u201cThis new style is too targeted.\u201d Jian Ye looked calm. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see their ferocity in their jungle grabbing. It has been a long time since I lacked so much milk. I will fight hard against anyone who says that their team has a good temper in the future.\u201dChen Yushen frowned. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, my rhythm wasn\u2019t good.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your problem. The rhythm was very good.\u201d Gu Luo\u2019s lips pressed together tightly. \u201cI became a bit arrogant because I won two solo games. I thought that I could kill Luni alone but as a result\u2026\u201dHe paused before solemnly continuing, \u201cAfter three games, I only succeeded twice.\u201dThere were a total of 10 killing opportunities. Apart from these two, the opponent escaped six times and he had been killed by Luni two times. The overall completion probability was indeed very low.Jing Yuanzhou smiled a bit when he heard this. \u201cRather, I think that your current thoughts are arrogant.\u201dGu Luo looked up incredulously. \u201cEh?\u201d\u201cIf I remember correctly, in all the LDF matches in the mid-season, Luni was only killed by his opponent only in the quarter-finals match with PAY.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou glanced at Gu Luo when he said this. \u201cIn these three training games, you did what other professional teams haven\u2019t been able to complete. Do you still dare to say that you aren\u2019t being arrogant?\u201dGu Luo was stunned to hear this. He digested the content of the words only to realize that this was indeed the case. His originally bitter expression finally turned into a smile. \u201cCaptain, you are right! I was too arrogant!\u201dBi Yaohua agreed. \u201cThat\u2019s right! Don\u2019t doubt yourself Gloy. You have made great progress. Once you can rub Wuhoo against the ground then you will be complete.\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t forget to mobilize their fighting spirit. \u201cI have arranged all the training plans for the next stage. As long as you cooperate with me to complete these plans, everything is possible.\u201dThis sentence fell into everyone\u2019s ears and their vision turned black for a while. However, Gu Luo\u2019s performance today was very inspiring. Jian Ye held the table and gritted his teeth.\u201dCome on, Coach! Help me up, I can practice!\u201dThe entire process was indeed excessively hard but compared to the absolute training results, all their hard work seemed worthwhile.The autumn competition was their first official appearance in the professional league. Whether it was to thank fans for supporting them or to stop the mouths of those sunspots, they wanted to prove to the entire e-sport\u2019s circle that their strength was worthy of this position!Lin Yan was very satisfied with this positive attitude. \u201cIn fact, your part about personal ability has been basically completed to the last stage. Before the official start of the autumn competition, the main focus will be on training matches with various teams. If there aren\u2019t any surprises, I\u2019ll try my best to help you arrange matches with the team in the league. There might be a big gap between the statuses of teams in the training match compared to the official matches but it can be regarded as a side assessment of the team\u2019s strength.\u201dHe paused for a moment and thought about it. \u201cWell, in addition to the team goal, I have set a small phased goal for all of you. Putting aside everything else, as long as this is achieved, it will be difficult for GH to not be this year\u2019s champions.\u201dThe moment these words, everyone\u2019s appetite was instantly whetted. What small goals were so amazing?Lin Yan cleared his throat under their gazes. \u201cIn fact, it is simple. As long as Gloy strives to surpass Luni, Abyss to be equal to AI and BB and Gun Zai can handle the pair of Wuhoo and Come, the autumn competition will definitely be our GH\u2019s world.\u201dThe GH members, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThere were pits everywhere but it was completely impossible to refute. It sounded like \u2018once you have the strength of a world champion, you can definitely become a world champion.\u2019 At that time, all the members of GH would\u2019ve replaced the five major demon kings. Then they would rule the world forever!Lin Yan waited for a long time without seeing a reaction and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy? Am I wrong?\u201dEveryone in GH was expressionless. \u201c\u2026Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201dLin Yan glanced at them again. \u201cIs it a lack of confidence?\u201dAfter a period of silence, several low voices rang out one after another. \u201cThere is\u2026\u201dLin Yan felt that this momentum was very undesirable. He frowned and was just about to say something when someone gently patted him on the shoulder. Looking back, he met Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes. His low voice contained a hint of laughter. \u201cEveryone\u2019s goals have been set. What about mine?\u201dLin Yan remembered that he had missed someone.He felt silent for a moment under this gaze. \u201cYou\u2026 just be yourself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 73Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the following days, GH officially started the high intensity life of playing a \u2018round robin\u2019 with major professional teams. As mentioned before, Lin Yan carefully selected several top teams in the professional league for training matches. Through this process, they tried several new play styles without revealing their tactics.There were naturally winners and losers but everyone knew that the results of the training matches weren\u2019t brought into the professional league. Therefore, no one\u2019s mood was affected due to the wins or losses. The main focus was on the review after each training match.Learn from the experience and retain their strengths.Before they knew it, time passed day by day. After lunch that day, the people of GH were preparing to go to the training room as usual. Then they looked up and saw Luo Mo commanding several people to move in several large boxes from outside.Everyone paused in unison. Gu Luo rubbed his eyes that were somewhat swollen after waking up and asked in a daze, \u201cManager Luo, what did you buy again?\u201dThe competition was just around the corner. There would be peripherals and other items sent to the club ever so often, so it wasn\u2019t surprising. Luo Mo expressed dissatisfaction with the word \u2018again\u2019 and clarified. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my delivery. I just came back from the outside and met them at the door. They asked me to help them carry it in.\u201dGu Luo became even more curious and couldn\u2019t help investigating. \u201cWhose is it?\u201dLuo Mo leaned toward a box next to him and slowly read the note attached to it. \u201cThe recipient seems to be\u2026 Master\u2019s wife?\u201dLin Yan had just walked down the stairs. He heard this and almost sprained his ankle again. Next to him, Jing Yuanzhou swiftly helped him but couldn\u2019t help laughing. Lin Yan turned his head and glared at Jing Yuanzhou. However, there was no other way. He could only take the initiative to claim it. \u201cThese things are probably sent to me.\u201dBi Yaohua walked over and circled the boxes a few times, his curiosity intrigued. \u201cCoach, what did you buy? Why is the name Master\u2019s Wife? Is your shopping ID so fresh and refined?\u201dFuck your fresh and refined! The corners of Lin Yan\u2019s mouth twitched slightly and he tried to make his tone as calm as possible. \u201cIf I guessed correctly, these boxes should all be coffee beans.\u201dIt was the recipient name that instantly reminded him that he had asked Lan Min to buy him coffee beans. It had been a long time so he had almost forgotten about it. He didn\u2019t know why Lan Min suddenly remembered to send it to him after so long. Thinking of this, Lin Yan turned around and cast questioning glances at Jing Yuanzhou.Jing Yuanzhou knew some of the twists and turns and explained, \u201cDidn\u2019t you have Mini buy my favorite coffee beans? These beans aren\u2019t sold in China so he could only ask someone to buy it abroad. It took some time to be sent.\u201dIn the blink of an eye, Luo Mo had already called people to move in the few boxes from outside. As he moved, he asked from a distance, \u201cBoss, are you sure you bought coffee beans? The wrong order wasn\u2019t placed? There are at least 10 boxes. Are you going to transform the club into a coffee store?\u201dBi Yaohua had been taking part in the fun. Then he thought of something after hearing this and the expression on his face became subtle for a moment. He hesitated a bit before tentatively asking, \u201cYes Coach, why did you buy so many coffee beans suddenly? Are you going to have us drink coffee instead of tea later? Are you\u2026 going to increase our training intensity again?\u201dThe moment he spoke, the atmosphere of the entire scene instantly became heavy. Lin Yan was left speechless by their rich imagination. He had a headache and didn\u2019t want to talk, so he could only look at Jing Yuanzhou blankly.Jing Yuanzhou looked innocent. \u201cMini said that it seems you like these coffee beans a lot. In order to be filial, he directly bought wholesale from the merchant. He has been asking everyday if you have received the goods. If you don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough then he will buy more in the future.\u201dLin Yan, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t enough? As long as it didn\u2019t expire, this amount was probably enough for the entire club to drink for several years! In order to not waste it, the club\u2019s new year gift package should be replaced with a coffee bean gift box.He took a deep breath and didn\u2019t bother to answer the unreliable questions. He just waved his hand nonchalantly. \u201cOkay, move them all to the storage room. It was bought by Mini from the BK team for everyone. I really don\u2019t have any intentions so don\u2019t think too much.\u201dBi Yaohua frowned. \u201cBK\u2019s people sent it? One who is being unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions. They sent so many at once. Do you want to find a professional hospital to test for poison?\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t bother paying attention to him and turned to Luo Mo. \u201cAh Mo, haven\u2019t you been working on the team\u2019s publicity these days? How is it going?\u201dLuo Mo finally remembered business once he was reminded. \u201cOh yes, I\u2019m here to tell you about this! The publicity plan has been officially set and it just needs to be scheduled.\u201dAs the autumn competition approached, the operating departments of the current professional league were also actively running. GH was a newcomer to the professional league and naturally couldn\u2019t be sloppy when it came to publicity.The partner that Luo Mo contacted this time was the Polar Star live broadcast platform they had signed with. It was confirmed that a full live broadcast would be held in a few days. The content of the live broadcast was a five man team match. At that time, the platform would reserve the most eye-catching recommendation spot on the homepage to provide them with traffic support. They would cooperate with the hot search and marketing accounts to create trends as well. Both the gimmicks and exposure were absolutely explosive.This plan was formally confirmed by Lin Yan.He had always been assured of Luo Mo\u2019s work efficiency. He listened to the rough introduction and didn\u2019t forget to add, \u201cThis is the first official appearance of our team and I will deliberately control the difficulty of the team match. If there is no surprise, I should find a new team within the top 100 of the server. Once the time comes, remember to add your accounts to the team and then over the team permissions. In short it won\u2019t affect your usual training apart from the day of the live broadcast.\u201dBi Yaohua wondered, \u201cCoach, does this mean making a new team? In this case, has the team been named? I want to nominate a name!\u201dLin Yan looked at him. \u201cNo, I have set the team name.\u201dBi Yaohua let out a disappointed sigh and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cSo what is the final name?\u201dThe corners of Lin Yan\u2019s lips twitched slightly. \u201cIt is called Temptation to Go Home.\u201dEveryone in the GH team, \u201c\u2026Wonderful!\u201dIt was really a divine team name and a divine meaning.The live broadcast of the team match was scheduled for three days later. Since the official Weibo of the GH Club had already released promotional content, many netizens waited on the front page of the platform early, ready to rush in and watch.During the broadcast, Luo Mo specifically asked the styling team to clean up the appearance of the GH team. Everyone sat in their positions and carried out the final preparations. This feeling of official business made them a lot more tense than usual at the start of the broadcast.Chen Yushen took deep breaths and then looked up to see Jian Ye drinking half a bottle of water.Chen Yushen, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dNow the command of their team had been officially transferred to the support Brother Gun and today was the first public display. He didn\u2019t show it on the surface but it could be concluded from this behavior alone that Brother Gun was quite nervous.In comparison, Bi Yaohua had experienced many battles. Before the live broadcast started, he leaned back in his gaming chair and looked at Weibo. He had \u2018friendly exchanges\u2019 with the sunspots on Weibo while not forgetting to share the latest information with his teammates. \u201cHahaha, I\u2019m dying. Do you know how many teams are ready to snipe our live broadcast? What the hell? What teams are so idle? Why are there people rushing to send their heads?\u201dGu Luo looked up and wondered, \u201cSniping our team match? Really?\u201dBi Yaohua frowned and hesitated. \u201cIt must be fake right? The group with low IQ come to my Weibo every day to show off. They can\u2019t do anything and are the first to spread rumors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s real.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou joined in the conversation. \u201cA friend told me this morning. It seems that several teams failed to make an appointment with us for the training match so they asked about the specific situation of the live broadcast of the team match. Now thinking about it, it must be for this. If we encounter the teams in the afternoon then it can be considered a training match in disguise.\u201dLin Yan had refused the invitation for training matches with several teams. He heard this and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cForget anything else, the persistence of the competitive spirit is real.\u201dJian Ye was stunned. \u201cAre all professional teams so wild now?\u201d\u201cWho made us so popular?\u201d Lin Yan thought for a moment. \u201cDon\u2019t talk about the professional league teams. Maybe many teams in the secondary league don\u2019t feel reconciled. After all, they have worked so hard for many years. As a result, our good promotion place suddenly appeared and was taken away by us. Some teams want to take advantage of this opportunity to see how awesome we are.\u201dThen he paused and looked at Luo Mo next to him. \u201cOh, this gave me inspiration! Ah Mo, how about publishing the name and ranking of our team on the official website? Tell them directly that all the big teams are welcome to snipe us at any time. This gimmick feels like a free wave for the hot search?\u201dEveryone was speechless at Lin Yan who wished for the whole world to be in chaos.Only Luo Mo praised him. \u201cI\u2019ll go now. There\u2019s half an hour before it starts. This is enough time!\u201dHe did as he said. Soon, a new message was released on the official Weibo of the GH team.[@GH Club V: Starting the 20 minute countdown. The Temptation to Go Home team doesn\u2019t refuse any fight! We are currently ranked 96th in the team competition. The most powerful dark horse team in the autumn competition is seeking abuse online. Welcome to snipe~ Welcome to enjoy the free treatment of going home. We\u2019re waiting for you #kiss #kiss #kiss]Fans and sunspots were waiting for the live broadcast to officially start when they saw such a message on Weibo. The moment they read the specific content, the comments area below exploded.[Is the Go Home team finally crazy? Isn\u2019t this calling for others to snipe them at the scene?][it\u2019s kind of fun. The team I\u2019m on is just ranked over 90. I feel like I can try it.][Is 96th place in the team competition very good? Why be so arrogant about this?][GH takes itself too seriously. Do other teams really care about them?][Ah, don\u2019t be too sure. What if a team really comes to play? @BK Club V @SUU Club V @PAY Club V][In fact, I don\u2019t think the GH officials need to jump like this. It is already good to maintain a winning streak against an ordinary team in today\u2019s live broadcast. If they lose too badly then they are hitting themselves in the face.][Tsk, this broken team really thinks they are so awesome? Be careful not to roll over online.][The people above are so sour. I am different. I absolutely love this type of arrogant tone! GKD! GKD!][Fuck, what type of broken Weibo post is GH posting? Can\u2019t they broadcast? My legs are going numb waiting!][Isn\u2019t this pretending to be bright? They are going so crazy after just being promoted to a professional team. As someone from another club, I can\u2019t bear it.]Bi Yaohua was looking at his mobile phone. Before he could see the specific comments on the official Weibo, he was deeply attracted by the last string of red lips. \u201cManager Luo, your kisses are really\u2026 so coquettish!\u201dLin Yan raised his eyes in a disapproving manner. \u201cIsn\u2019t it used well? How can it match the unique temperament of our team if it isn\u2019t a bit coquettish?\u201dAfter speaking, he moved his fingertips and liked the Weibo post with his side account.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Still, even if they had been prepared early, five live broadcasts starting at the same time and the influx of traffic almost made the screen freeze. It was enough to see their high popularity.However, this type of popularity obviously didn\u2019t come from the fans of the team. There were also the sunspots who flocked to it.Originally, the room managers in each live broadcast room were ready to fight the sunspots. Then once the live broadcast officially started, they were surprised to find that the situation of the barrage was better than expected. There was some cynicism from time to time but the content was relatively optimistic.Among the five live broadcast rooms, there was no doubt that Jing Yuanzhou was the most popular, followed by Bi Yaohua. Both of them belonged to very different styles of live broadcasting.Lin Yan had nothing to do. He sat on the sofa with his mobile and wandered between the players\u2019 live broadcast rooms. The moment he entered Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s live broadcast room, the content of the barrage attracted attention.[Ahhh, Husband. You are finally live!][Where is Coach Lin? Today you are playing a team of five. Didn\u2019t the coach come to arrange the BP?][Yes, every game should be taken seriously. Asking the coach to show his face.][This is a letter written in my blood asking my parents to show love online.

I will wait here.][Beep\u2014technique fan card!]Originally, the two of them were only doing business online and Lin Yan didn\u2019t feel anything. Now he and Jing Yuanzhou had formally established a relationship. He looked at the barrage and couldn\u2019t help his cheeks feeling slightly hot. It was clear that no one was paying attention to him but he couldn\u2019t help clearing his throat.Just then, he heard Jing Yuanzhou explain, \u201cWe have been busy training these days so I haven\u2019t been broadcasting. In particular, Coach Lin is really tired. It is hard for him to rest so he will appear this afternoon.\u201dThe words were just an ordinary explanation but people who wanted to pick up sugar thought that everything was sweet. The moment he finished speaking, the barrage scrolled quickly across the screen.The man\u2019s voice came through the earbuds as if whispering to him. Lin Yan felt that his ears were getting hotter. His fingertips rubbed against the phone screen twice before staying still. Then he moved his fingers and smashed several deep-water fish mines in one breath in the live broadcast room.Jing Yuanzhou was slightly stunned when he saw the reward banner that suddenly floated past. He seemed to want to look back in Lin Yan\u2019s direction but he finally held back. He just gave a low chuckle. \u201cThank you Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess for the deep-water fish mines.\u201dThe entire barrage was quite for a moment before it seemed like the rat\u2019s nest had been stung. The screen was completely covered with \u2018ahhhh\u2019. There was a commotion but the team game was proceeding step by step. Soon, the five people entered the group battle interface neatly and started the first game of the afternoon.The five people\u2019s live broadcasts started simultaneously so people could watch according to their own preferences. People jumped back and forth from different positions one after another and the live broadcast rooms were lively.The first team game was quickly finished.In order to not cause unnecessary agitation, their team used their side accounts. The messy game IDs looked like an ordinary passerby team in the eyes of unsuspecting people but once they really played, the gap in strength between the two sides was instantly exposed.The opponents in this round might be among the top 100 teams but they still weren\u2019t enough in front of the GH team. Just a few minutes after starting the game, heads were gained. At 10 minutes, it was officially a crushing and at 25 minutes, the game ended.Today was originally a benefit of live broadcasting team games. The moment they returned to the team interface, Jing Yuanzhou quickly started another round.Another big interest of this group live broadcast was undoubtedly the team\u2019s voice channel. After winning a few rounds, the ranking of the team soared to more than 80. The audience of several live broadcast teams could clearly hear Bi Yaohua\u2019s voice. \u201cAren\u2019t any masters playing the glory tournament? Is the strength of the top 100 teams just like this?\u201d[66666 The Trash Talk King still can\u2019t hold back.][I know he would come out sooner or later. He just won a few games with passersby and has become so swollen.][Don\u2019t worry, other teams are already sniping. Once they arrive, be careful not to cry.][Listen to my advice, don\u2019t brag too early. Brag carefully.]Bi Yaohua had long been accustomed to the rhythm of the barrage. It was hard for him to feel excited if there was no one to fight.He glanced at the fast-moving content and chuckled in the team\u2019s voice channel. \u201cBrothers, why do they think we are afraid of being sniped?\u201dJian Ye thought about it. \u201cMaybe it is because the uninformed are fearless?\u201dGu Luo heard the two people\u2019s unhappy tones and silently comforted them. \u201cWait until a team really snipes us. We\u2019ll prove it by hitting the opposite side.\u201dChen Yushen couldn\u2019t understand it. \u201cIs it so difficult to snipe?\u201dJing Yuanzhou answered this question. \u201cTeams that enter the queue at the same time are more likely to be matched. If the other side enters the queue with us within 0.5 seconds then the chances of being matched are relatively higher. Therefore, if you want to successfully snipe us, it is best to test the synchronization with the live broadcast. This should improve the success rate.\u201dThen he glanced up at the camera and smiled slightly. \u201cEveryone crouching in the live broadcast room, have you learned?\u201dBarrage: [\u2026]Fuck, what was going on with the GH team? The live broadcast wasn\u2019t enough, they even had to teach sniping skills?As they talked, another game had already started. Based on the opposite side\u2019s IDs, this should be an ordinary passersby team. In the beginning, everyone didn\u2019t think much of it and fought as they pleased.In the early stages, their suppression was maintained as always. Then in the mid-to-late section, the perfect ambushes for the team battles were broken by the opponents and the situation turned around in an instant.Jian Ye didn\u2019t care about the barrage that was mocking them and frowned. \u201cDo you think there is something strange?\u201dIn the ambushes just now, there was no way to see them but the people opposite immediately used their big moves the moment they met. It was obvious the opponents knew their location in advance.Bi Yaohua sneered and replied, \u201cDon\u2019t guess, it is an old trick.\u201dHe had encountered this situation before during live broadcasts. The friends watching mode was different. All the scenes from the live broadcast rooms were synchronized. If the audience sniped them while continuing to watch the live broadcast rooms, there was really no way to hide. This method was often worse than opening a perspective cheat.For example, they were currently playing a team game with the team voice chat. Through the live broadcast room, the opponents could determine their location in advance while also understanding their specific arrangements through the voice channel. In this way, their entire tactical system was laid bare. After all, ordinary players didn\u2019t have the high moral consciousness of a professional team. Some people deliberately engaged in disgusting things and it couldn\u2019t be prevented.In addition, it wasn\u2019t clear if the other side really was in their live broadcast rooms. Without proof, the sunspots would just laugh if they gave an explanation. They couldn\u2019t afford to lose. There was no benefit from dying.Chen Yushen realized that something was wrong after several consecutive gank failures. At first, he didn\u2019t say anything. Then he heard this conversation and instantly understood. His mouth lowered in a frown.Just in time, as if in response to their speculation, several messages popped up on the public channel.[Everyone] Violent Small Ash Ash: Hey, I suddenly found that the great gods of GH are the opponents?][Everyone] Violent Small Lovable Lovable: Wow wow, did we actually match up with a professional team?[Everyone] Violent Small Ash Ash: As expected of bigshots, they are fierce.[Everyone] Violent Small Lovable Lovable: I\u2019m suddenly so excited. What should we do? We actually played with a professional team for 30 minutes.This pretense caused everyone\u2019s expressions to instantly sink.Chen Yushen\u2019s deep voice was heard from the team\u2019s voice chat. \u201cHow to fight?\u201dIn the silence, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s calm voice was heard. \u201cDo you want to play people against the computer?\u201dThe others paused slightly at the word. Moments later, Jian Ye reacted first and he couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cYes! This is too familiar!\u201d[People against the computer? Why do you pretend to be pretentious like this?][What do you mean? Treating the team game as people against the computer?][In the team battles just now, you couldn\u2019t beat the opponents. Aren\u2019t you really going to lose to passersby?][I\u2019m laughing to death. I haven\u2019t met a professional who has lost to passersby. This first will be interesting.][Hey wait, what are they doing? Why are they all scattered?][???]At the reminder, the audience found that the GH members had completely scattered. The top, middle and bottom lane players dispersed and went to their lanes in turn. They each cleared the line of soldiers as if ready to advance brainlessly. What were they intending? This didn\u2019t have many advantages? Were they really ready to be people against the computer?In Bi Yaohua\u2019s live broadcast room, the barrage kept scrolling.[What\u2019s going on? The opposite side is clearly taunting yet the Trash Talk King went back?][Do they feel ashamed after losing the last few team battles? According to my perception of BB, this can\u2019t be the case.][Did the club issue a ban today? He is incredibly well-behaved.][I was ready to see the war of curses yet you actually gave me this?][Hahaha, BB must be scared because he just finished the suspension period.][No, it would be really funny if he was banned for a few months just before the autumn competition starts.][If BB really wants to curse someone, will he leave a chance to be suspended? Oh, too naive!]Bi Yaohua was clearing the line of soldiers on the lane. He glanced at the content of the barrage and spoke slowly, \u201cDon\u2019t guess, can you guess Brother\u2019s mind? We said that this game should be played as people against the computer. The moment this is said, the level of the opposite side isn\u2019t as high as the computer. I think it is a drop in status to fight them.\u201dBarrage: [666666]Bi Yaohua didn\u2019t continue to talk as his eyes swept over the map. Not surprisingly, several figures on the opposite side flashed through his field of view. Judging by this route, they were apparently agitated by what he just said and were ready to team up against him. This was exactly what he wanted.Bi Yaohua\u2019s lips moved scornfully. He glanced at Jian Ye\u2019s position and didn\u2019t mean to shrink back. He just stood in the middle of the lane and continued to clear the line of soldiers. Before long, several figures rushed out of the grass next to him. There were three of them.Bi Yaohua raised an eyebrow slightly, took a step back and slowly loaded his gun. The three people wanted to kill him with an ambush. They didn\u2019t expect the person to meet them and complete a crushing reverse kill.In just a few seconds, Bi Yaohua killed the jungler first and then the shooter. He used flesh and accepted the head of the support Violent Small Lovable Lovable The whole process was like flowing water and ended instantly.The moment the three kills notification appeared, Gu Luo on the middle lane and Jing Yuanzhou on the top lane also completed single kills one after another. The team was directly annihilated.There was the arrival of new troops and GH wasn\u2019t anxious. They just kept pressing forward.In the previous team battles where they were defeated, the main problem was their intention to ambush which was exposed in advance. Now GH was scattered and didn\u2019t hide. They seemed to return to the laning process at the beginning of the game. Since this battle mode had no tactics, it made the opponent\u2019s peeping behavior in the live broadcast rooms lose any meaning. It returned to the most direct strength competition and GH was overwhelming. They once again got the advantage and the situation that had been slightly reversed returned to them.The people on the opposite team never typed in the public chat again. The moment all three lanes were broken and the soldiers reached the high ground, the opponents simply surrendered and quit the game.Bi Yaohua glanced at his super god kill data for this game and moved his finger on the mouse. \u201cHow about it? Can\u2019t it be called people against computers? What was the name just now? Violent Small Ash Ash and Violent Small Lovable Lovable? How about it? Are you still in the live broadcast rooms? I\u2019m curious and want to ask. From the perspective of watching the game in the live broadcast room, have you gained a new understanding of your own weaknesses? You like to type so much, why don\u2019t you send a barrage?\u201dJian Ye also laughed. \u201cThe GH team specializes in all types of abuse.\u201dThe moment they spoke, the barrage in the live broadcast room paused for a moment. They immediately looked back on the entire process just now and fully understood. Fuck? The team that seemed so strong yet weak just now was actually playing dirty?Fans of GH instantly couldn\u2019t hold back. They asked for the game IDs and ran to add these IDs to scold them. As a result, the people who added them later said they received system notifications that these game accounts didn\u2019t exist. They obviously couldn\u2019t resist the scolding and modified their game IDs with a renaming card.Bi Yaohua was addicted to talking and didn\u2019t care much about villains who only knew how to do small tricks. This small episode ended and the ranking battles continued. They were matched with new opponents.After entering the BP link, Gu Luo called out with surprise. \u201cThe opposite people\u2026\u201dThe audience in the live broadcast rooms also saw the game IDs of the opposite side. The barrage in the live broadcast room completely exploded. These five game IDs weren\u2019t hidden at all. They were the new and powerful team who showed an outstanding performance in the mid-season, SUU.Lin Yan sitting on the sofa was also stunned for a moment. He didn\u2019t expect that after rejecting the invitation for training matches from SUU so many times, they would meet in this way. He frowned slightly and glanced in Chen Yushen\u2019s direction. The young man\u2019s expression had visibly sunk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySUU was a new team that had just emerged in the past two years, but their entire process was somewhat different from other teams.The team initially became known in the league because their owner, the Peng Group, spent huge sums of money to directly buy the league quota from the old team OR. Then the name was changed to SUU and a brand new club was established.It was a pity that despite the great momentum, SUU didn\u2019t achieve ideal results in the first year of the league. Their best result was only the quarterfinals. This made the entire team go through a thorough reshuffle during the transfer period of their second year.If teams such as BK and LDF had the richest players in the league, SUU was undoubtedly a well-deserved \u2018rich\u2019 club.Strong financial support allowed them to replace the team\u2019s lineup on a large scale almost every year. After a batch of screening, this year they introduced two major foreign players as the top laner and jungler. This allowed them to finally achieve good results in this year\u2019s summer competition and mid-season.It was said that the two foreign players of SUU were trying to learn to communicate in simple Chinese and the team was in the critical working together period. Once the team successfully completed the integration, they would inevitably have an extremely strong presence in the autumn competition.SUU was a rising force in the league and Lin Yan naturally had some understanding of the history of this team. Yet more than that, he cared about the current SUU captain, Mirror.Mirror, also known as Peng He, was the important presence in the small group at the youth training camp that caused that incident.At present, everyone in the small group had been locked up except for Peng He. It was because there was no evidence to prove he had participated in it. Therefore, he wasn\u2019t implicated and was still active in the professional league.Lin Yan asked Xie Wei to investigate because he believed in his friend\u2019s ability to verify things. Since even Xie Wei said there was nothing wrong with the verdict, there was a large possibility that Peng He really had no relationship with the events of that year.However, if he was really unrelated, why did the Peng Group use so much effort back then to bring the two incidents to an end? This was exactly what Lin Yan couldn\u2019t solve. Combined with Chen Yushen, this made him look at SUU under a filter and there was a somewhat subtle feeling.He had a complex mood, let alone Chen Yushen, who was the party involved. Lin Yan had actually been worried about what state Chen Yushen would be in when meeting SUU during the autumn competition. There was a sudden encounter today. His family\u2019s jungler looked more stinky than usual but he didn\u2019t show any extra emotions.\u201cHe had adjusted better than expected\u2026\u201d Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help some approval flashing in his eyes. He pressed the record button and leaned back on the sofa to pay attention to the game.After all, the nature of human beings was to watch excitement. The moment the name of the SUU team appeared, the barrage in the live broadcast room became even crazier.[Fuck, this isn\u2019t fake? SUU actually sniped GH? It shouldn\u2019t be necessary for them!][I thought it was just a joke. A professional team was really squatting?][It\u2019s a coincidence. I know that SUU has been training with their foreign players recently. They probably just matched randomly.][Then they don\u2019t know this team is GH? Hah, this will be very interesting.][SUU\u2019s performance in the mid-season was fierce. This time, GH really kicked the steel plate.][Weren\u2019t the fans of GH bragging really hard before? Now it is time to see the strength of a professional team.][I don\u2019t think this is necessarily the case. They are just playing casually and there definitely isn\u2019t a strong lineup.][Whether they are a mule or a horse, we will know after watching.]The barrage was blowing up while in the game, the two sides already had the first wave of collision in the jungle area. It was originally a battle of two people and then the mid-laners of both sides also joined the battlefield.SUU\u2019s mid-laner played a trick in this game. He used a displacement skill to move in the grass and just happened to deal a critical injury to Chen Yushen. However, at this moment, the picture seemed to freeze when the two people faced each other.Peng He didn\u2019t move back to his initial position but stayed there for two more seconds. It was only a short time but this was enough to let Chen Yushen unceremoniously hit him. From the side, Gu Luo quickly cooperated to deal more damage. The two people set fire to him and Chen Yushen took away his head.[First Blood!]However, Chen Yushen didn\u2019t show any happiness after getting the first kill.The corners of his mouth were still lowered to their lowest point and he didn\u2019t even look at the corpse under his feet. He took advantage of the other SUU player\u2019s choice to retreat and cleared the opponent\u2019s jungler area.Barrage: [???]What was this situation? Was this deliberately giving away a head or was he stuck? The Internet speed at the SUU base couldn\u2019t be that bad, right? SUU\u2019s members were also full of question marks.Hand, the foreign aid jungler, asked in bad Chinese, \u201cMirror, you\u2026 what happened?\u201dThe young man next to him didn\u2019t show much expression on his face even as the countdown ended and he was resurrected. He rushed to the line of soldiers while replying flatly, \u201cNothing.\u201dPeng He had heard that GH team was live broadcasting team matches today but he didn\u2019t expect to actually match with them. Just now when the game was loading, he went to pour a glass of water and didn\u2019t pay attention. The moment he entered the grass, he saw the game ID on the opposite jungler\u2019s head\u2014King of Hell Takes You To FlyIt had to be called a really familiar name.By the time he returned to the middle tower, he inevitably missed the first wave of soldiers. Peng He quickly got rid of the soldiers gathered under the tower with a wave of skills and couldn\u2019t help clicking on the battle list again to look at the opposite jungler\u2019s ID. His eyes shook slightly and he breathed out slowly as he adjusted his mood. Then Peng He quickly discovered that this ID appeared in his field of view frequently.The considerable economy from the first blood gave Chen Yushen the absolute initiative. He swiftly upgraded his big move and came to the middle lane twice in just 10 minutes. His timing was precise enough to assist Gu Luo in completing the second kill of the mid-laner.Gu Luo felt very comfortable and couldn\u2019t help praising it. \u201cAbyss, your gank rhythm is really getting better.\u201dChen Yushen replied, \u201cYes, continue to push forward. I will come back later.\u201dThere was no emotion in his voice as he spoke. The audience in the live broadcast room saw this cold and ruthless look and the barrage was active.[Not smiling even after taking a head? Is it necessary to be so cool?][Why do I feel like there is going to be one more cold-blooded mechanical jungler?][Can fans not be so pretentious? Wanting to compare with AI at this level? Are you blind?][Can you sunspots not be so pretentious? Black and black? The last few waves of gank just now were really beautiful. Why not praise them?][Don\u2019t say anything else, I really love this stinky face.][Is it my illusion? Why do I always feel that AA is targeting SUU\u2019s middle lane?][SUU\u2019s middle lane has the worst economy right now. If it was me, I would also target Mirror.]As if to prove the correctness of the barrage\u2019s prediction, in the next 10 minutes, apart from when he went to SUU\u2019s jungle area, the other times he would be targeting Peng He the entire time, regardless of whether Peng He was on the lane or went to gank someone.As a result, the 2-8-4 record of SUU\u2019s mid-laner was very eye-catching by the time the game reached 35 minutes. Even the other members of SUU felt it was wrong.SUU\u2019s support asked, \u201cCaptain, the other side is targeting you like this. Would you like me to come and follow you?\u201dPeng He saw Chen Yushen disappear into the map and didn\u2019t hesitate to answer, \u201cNo, you follow the jungler and help him.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t known why but it sounded like something was wrong. SUU\u2019s support frowned slightly. He couldn\u2019t figure out Peng He\u2019s heart but he didn\u2019t say anything. The game continued until the end and almost turned into a competition between junglers.Chen Yushen was grabbing the middle lane while SUU\u2019s foreign jungler was frantically aiming at the bottom lane. The two sides matched each other to the end and eventually, the top lane became the final breakthrough in breaking the stalemate.Jing Yuanzhou pressured and defeated the foreign player on the opposite side and finally forced the other players of SUU to gather on the top lane.Gu Luo had been waiting to ambush in the grass for a long time. He took the opportunity to block the way and dealt a set of explosive damage while Chen Yushen once again took Peng He\u2019s head.Finally, GH won this team battle with two heads for five and directly pushed to the high ground. Overall, GH played quite beautifully. The lineup used in this game didn\u2019t have any tactical reference value but in the end, GH blocked the mouths of the black fans with their own strength.The GH fans went into a frenzy.[66666, who said that GH can\u2019t win against a professional team? Stand up!][Let me guess. They will say that a team match doesn\u2019t mean anything?][What is wrong with a team match? SUU randomly selected a line-up but isn\u2019t GH the same?][Hahaha, does your face hurt? GH really won against SUU.][Come on, let\u2019s see which teams will continue to snipe.][Fuck, these black fans are really enough. I was suffocated before and now I can finally exhale.][Laughing to death. Where are all the people who were jumping just now? Are they all mute?]At this time, the SUU team\u2019s base. As the foreign side lane player hired by SUU at a high price, this was the first time Kong felt such a strong pressure. After the game ended, he couldn\u2019t recover for a long time. He finally squeezed out a sentence in Korean. \u201cWho the hell is the opposite side-lane player\u2026\u201dThe foreign jungler Hand was also curious about this. He was ready to ask Peng He when he saw that the other person\u2019s screen had cut to a live broadcast room. The live footage showed the settlement that just finished with them.Hand felt choked up as his eyes moved to the title of the live broadcast room. \u201cGH?\u201dKong almost shot out of his chair when he heard these words. \u201cTitans?!\u201dPeng He\u2019s eyes shook for a moment and he didn\u2019t speak. He switched back to the interface of the game and his fingers tapped on the keyboard. The next second, everyone in Chen Yushen\u2019s live broadcast room saw the friend request message that popped up in the lower right corner.[SUU.Mirror has requested to add you as a friend.]The entire barrage paused for a moment.[What is this situation?][Mirror has requested to add friends? So straightforward?][It is because he was caught too hard in the middle lane just now that it gave the feeling of abuse?][Perhaps he feels that the middle lane was too targeted so he came here to ask.][I can smell the strong scent of fire and medicine through the screen.][Hahaha, perhaps SUU feels too bad about losing that they want to face again in a training match?][I now believe that SUU really didn\u2019t know who they were playing.][What are you doing? Accept it!][I want to see what Mirror is going to say.]Regardless of the barrage, the screen of the live broadcast room was still like the pause button had been pressed. Chen Yushen sat there so motionless that people couldn\u2019t help wondering if their Internet cut off. Finally, they saw him indifferently move his fingers and refuse the invitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChen Yushen\u2019s refusal stunned the SUU players for a moment and they couldn\u2019t help glancing at Peng He. The support came over and asked, \u201cMirror, does the jungler of GH know you?\u201dPeng He responded in a low voice, \u201cHe knows me.\u201dHe guessed this would be the result but a trace of sadness inevitably flashed in his eyes. It was because they knew each other that Chen Yushen would refuse. Peng He looked at the face in the lower right corner of the interface. He placed his hand on the table, pushed his gaming chair away and stood up. \u201cToday\u2019s team battle ends here. Disband.\u201dAfter speaking, he turned and walked out of the training room without paying attention to other people\u2019s stunned eyes. They had abundant funds in the league and the entire base was extremely luxurious.Peng He poured himself a cup of coffee in the tea room and walked to the balcony. He leaned on the railing to look at the distant scenery. The encounter with Chen Yushen meant that scenes from the past he didn\u2019t want to remember came to mind.As the only son of the Peng Group, Peng He was used to the feeling of being surrounded since he was young. No matter where he went, there was always a group of people around him. Even after entering the youth training camp, there were still people who wanted to take shortcuts to flatter him. They wanted the Peng Group investing in the e-sports industry to take a look at them.At that time, Peng He came to the e-sports road with his childhood friend, Xu Lou. However, it wasn\u2019t so much a friend as a subordinate relationship. It was because the Xu family always relied on the Peng family to survive. To him, Xu Lou was more similar to a subordinate. In fact, Peng He hadn\u2019t been happy with Xu Lou\u2019s ingratiating personality. He just used Xu Lou to help him stop those guys who were always following him around. This way, at least his side could be quiet occasionally.It was precisely because Peng He had been accustomed to such an environment for a long time that after entering the youth training camp, he went his own way and didn\u2019t worry about these things too much. He met Chen Yushen by chance during the team training in the camp.Chen Yushen was the only talented jungler Peng He had encountered who could keep up with his rhythm. The excellent cooperation between them in training and competitions gradually made them feel a sense of tacit understanding.At that time, many people in the youth training camp knew that Chen Yushen\u2019s friend in the same dormitory was another strong mid-laner. Peng He naturally heard Xu Lou mention it several times but he hadn\u2019t paid much attention. In Peng He\u2019s view, the field of e-sports had always been about strength due to his own strength. This made him think that no matter the occasion, he and Chen Yushen were the best partners.He never expected that there would be a sudden accident in the Xu family\u2019s industrial chain. Xu Lou spared no effort to please him under the direction of the family. In the end, he racked his brains and wanted to \u2018clean up\u2019 the biggest obstacle on the e-sports road for Peng He.The time coincided with the training camp\u2019s annual big test. Peng He and Chen Yushen were engaged in intensive training day and night. They had no energy to be distracted and pay attention to other things.Thus, in places they didn\u2019t know, something inhumane happened quietly.It wasn\u2019t until the tragedy of committing suicide by jumping from the building happened and these people rushed to Peng He after having nowhere to hide that Peng He found out what had happened during the training.He would always remember the ugly appearance of the panicked Xu Lou trying to please him and the way all the blood in his body froze due to extreme anger. These people were obviously panicked. Combined with the small relationship between Peng He and Xu Lou, they completely felt that this incident was what Peng He desired. Now that such a big thing had happened, their first reaction was to find Peng He, ridiculously wanting the Peng family\u2019s asylum.The pampered Peng He was unsurprisingly stunned by the sudden trust. For the first time, he felt at a loss. Just as his fists uncontrollably wanted to smash these people\u2019s faces, the person he least wanted to appear suddenly appeared like this.He saw Chen Yushen staring at him deeply and realized that many things had become unclear.In such a chaotic situation, he could only try to control the expression on his face as much as possible. He wanted to wait until his partner\u2019s anger had passed before finding a suitable time to handle the entire thing better. As he pretended to be calm, the others clamored, and the development became completely out of control.Everything that followed was just as reported recently. The violent incident suddenly pushed Chen Yushen to the forefront of the storm. Peng He begged for a long time before convincing his family to help him control this matter so it had the least impact on Chen Yushen.At the same time, it wasn\u2019t known how the Xu family begged or perhaps they had made threats. The Peng family was also worried that the suicide incident would implicate Peng He so they suppressed both incidents together.Throughout the process, Peng He didn\u2019t speak much. It was after this incident that the young man who hadn\u2019t reached the age of adulthood found out for the first time that in this huge world, there were people\u2019s hearts or power that weren\u2019t under his control.After that, Peng He also withdrew from the youth academy. He established the SUU Club with the support of his family and quietly blocked the paths of those who took the professional path.During this period, Chen Yushen completely disappeared from everyone\u2019s view. Peng He couldn\u2019t get in touch with him and had no way to explain it. In the end, he raised the courage to write an e-mail trying to explain the things of that year. To no surprise, once it was sent, it was like a stone sinking into the sea. There was no answer at all.He didn\u2019t know if Chen Yushen had seen the letter. Perhaps Chen Yushen had read it and couldn\u2019t forgive him completely. After all, everyone involved other than Xu Lou still firmly believed that all of this happened under his instruction to the end.In fact, Peng He himself always felt guilty that this tragedy happened due to his previous unrestrained indulgence. As long as he had been more careful and noticed, everything might\u2019ve been different.The young man who never knew sorrow grew up and the sunny self of the past was no longer reckless. Only a silence and indifference that kept others away remained.Peng He recovered his wandering thoughts and unknowingly lowered his head to find that the coffee in his hand was cold. He heard the footsteps behind him and looked back. It was their new foreign jungler, Hand.Hand seemed to be looking for him for a long time. Hand thought about it before organizing his words. \u201cMirror, GH\u2019s jungler is a bit strong\u2026 it\u2019s shocking. Is he a newcomer?\u201dPeng He was a bit stunned and only reacted after a while. \u201cYes, he is a genius and very strong.\u201dIf nothing had happened back then, the position of SUU\u2019s jungler should have been for Chen Yushen. They would now be teammates fighting side by side. Unfortunately, there were no ifs in this world. The original youthful friendship had been lost after too many impurities. No matter how much they cherished each other, they were destined to miss each other.GH\u2019s team battles continued.After meeting the SUU team, they encountered several rounds of passersby teams. Perhaps it was really hard to match. The online sniping teams missed time and time again until they finally met the professional team PILL. However, GH this afternoon was really overwhelming. Under their perfect, devastating rhythm, they won the final victory without any suspense.At 4:30 p.m., the event officially ended.Since they won against two professional teams, the GH team unexpectedly went on the hot search. Among the topics such as #GH beats SUU# and #GH beats PILL#, the hot search title #Mirror\u2019s friend application rejected# stood out.The activity finished and the team members went back to rest after organizing their equipment. Lin Yan took advantage of when the others weren\u2019t paying attention to pull Chen Yushen alone to the side. No words could be inserted during the live broadcast. It was only now that he had the opportunity to look carefully at Chen Yushen. \u201cHow do you feel?\u201dThe question was very euphemistic but Chen Yushen naturally knew what Lin Yan was asking. The corners of his lips slightly twitched and he tried to make what could be called a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Coach. I\u2019m fine.\u201dLin Yan wanted to see other emotions on this face but was only met with indifference. It was a lot better than what he thought. Lin Yan had this thought and was silent for a moment. He finally felt relieved and patted Chen Yushen\u2019s shoulder slightly. \u201cYes, it\u2019s good if you are like this.\u201dChen Yushen lowered his eyelashes, covering the complex emotions in his eyes. The contents of the e-mail he saw a few days ago quietly flashed through his mind.The mailbox had been registered really early on and he didn\u2019t remember how long it had been since he logged into it. For a long period of time, he had no intention of communicating with the outside world and basically didn\u2019t look at any social channels. It wasn\u2019t until LAN and the others received legal sanctions that he made up his mind to regain the past.He entered the mailbox and found that e-mail after many years. Word by word completely lifted the fog that plagued the past for many years and the truth of everything came to light. It was a pity that the thorns in his heart were too deep. No matter what, he couldn\u2019t forget the heart-wrenching pain.He was just an ordinary person with a mortal body. Even if he knew the truth, he couldn\u2019t completely forgive Peng He. He couldn\u2019t even avoid wanting to vent his anger at the heavy price. Perhaps this was the human heart.Chen Yushen slowly let out a sigh and looked at Lin Yan when he was calm again. \u201cCoach, don\u2019t worry. I can adjust myself.\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help smiling at this serious expression. He picked up his phone to take a look. \u201cSpeaking of which, these days are passing really quickly. It will be the opening day of the autumn competition in two days.\u201dHe sighed emotionally. \u201cIt is time to let me see your training results.\u201dHaha, author had to emphasize this several times. Chen Yushen and Peng He aren\u2019t a CP, not a couple!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Luo Mo showed the schedule to the team members and they were inevitably stunned when they read it.BB \u2013 Bi Yaohua: [Letting us play the opening curtain match with MEN on the day of the opening ceremony. Is this real?]Gun \u2013 Jian Ye: [According to the past, shouldn\u2019t there be a strong confrontation arranged at the beginning?]Titans \u2013 Jing Yuanzhou: [The league should be wanting to try something new.]Abyss \u2013 Chen Yushen: [?]Lin Breeder: [Can\u2019t you see this? We are a new team and the first one promoted from the variety show. How can the league\u2019s management not push us hard? The opening match is scheduled for us to give us a chance to prove ourselves.]Lin Breeder: [So play well, you know? If you lose in the first match, be careful that the leaders of the league don\u2019t directly remove us from the autumn competition in annoyance.]Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo: [Ah, is that so? If we lose then our qualifications will be removed? Really?]Gun \u2013 Jian Ye: [Fake.]Abyss \u2013 Chen Yushen: [\u2026\u2026]BB \u2013 Bi Yaohua: [How can you be so naive?]Gloy \u2013 Gu Luo: [QAQ]Abyss \u2013 Chen Yushen: [\u2026\u2026Don\u2019t tease him.]]Lin Breeder: [If you lose to MEN, I will remove you if the league doesn\u2019t do it. Do you hear me?]After a pause, the entire screen of the group chat was filled with \u2018I heard.\u2019Lin Yan sent the last pressuring words and after confirming that he received the desired answer, he put away his phone in satisfaction. He turned around and couldn\u2019t help freezing when he met Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze. \u201cAre you looking for me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou sat on the sofa in the lounge and said, \u201cI was just thinking. Is Coach Lin usually so fierce in normal times?\u201d\u201cThis is fierce?\u201d Lin Yan raised an eyebrow. \u201cThis is called being majestic.\u201d\u201cYes, it is indeed very majestic.\u201d Jing Yuanzhou held back his smile. He wrote \u2018I heard\u2019 in the group chat with great ease and wittily changed the topic. \u201cThen can I ask, would you like to play doubles with me?\u201dLin Yan didn\u2019t think much of it. \u201cI\u2019ll play.\u201dIt was nearing the opening of the autumn competition and all the training plans for the team had been placed on hold. This was to allow enough of an adjustment period for everyone before the competition to find their best condition.They were idle in these two days so Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou continued to play doubles. During this period, they often pulled other people except for Bi Yaohua to line up as well, but they often stopped after a few games.On the whole, Lin Yan estimated that the doubles game adaptive training was effective. At the very least, the discomfort when lining up as three was much better than before. As for restoring his state for a team battle of five, it was still far away and he didn\u2019t dare think about it. Just being able to occasionally feel the fun of lining up as three satisfied Lin Yan.Once Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou came to the training room, they weren\u2019t surprised to find that the other seats weren\u2019t empty. The entire team was in the training room without any absences. All the training plans were over but it was clear that everyone was hoping to improve as much as possible before the official start of the autumn season.Lin Yan and Jing Yuanzhou happily teamed up until around 9 o\u2019clock. Then they went out to have a late night snack. It was close to 1 a.m. when they returned, only to find that the training room was still brightly lit.Lin Yan frowned slightly. It was true that enthusiasm for training was a good thing but it was counterproductive if their nerves were too tight.He knocked gently on the door. Seeing that everyone didn\u2019t respond, he could only take off their soundproof headphones one by one. \u201cAfter playing this game, shut it down immediately. The day after tomorrow is the autumn competition. If anyone secretly plays before the official start of the competition, they will be fined 10,000 yuan. You are welcome to make extra income for the club.\u201dSuch a sentence from their own coach smoothly slapped everyone in GH. After finishing the game in a hurry, everyone shut down and went downstairs without hesitation to have hot spicy soup as a midnight snack.Luo Mo had printed out the schedule of the season and distributed it to everyone. \u201cTake it back and look at it so you can understand the schedule. I personally suggest that after you go back, post the schedule directly on the door of the dormitory. Making it more eye-catching will have a certain incentive effect.\u201dIn the blink of an eye, Jian Ye had half a bowl of hot, spicy soup. He felt like this entire body had been elevated. He lowered his head and glanced at the schedule again. \u201cOn the afternoon of the opening ceremony, is it really only our match that is arranged? I remember that all the professional teams will be there at that time, right? Is this our team\u2019s debut? This is just right. We will take this opportunity to give the professional teams a strong impression and give them a big shock.\u201dGu Luo\u2019s face was red from the spice and he couldn\u2019t help reminding this person, \u201cBrother Gun, we have played all the strong teams in the training matches. I bet they won\u2019t be too shocked, right?\u201dJian Ye shook his index finger. \u201cYou are still young and don\u2019t know much. A training match is a training match. Is it rare for a championship team to be weak in a training match? Those who can really play in the league are the really tough ones.\u201dChen Yushen remembered something at this time. \u201cThe regular season\u2026 seems to be BO1?\u201dJing Yuanzhou answered from where he was sitting next to Chen Yushen and playing with his mobile phone. \u201cYes, it is BO1, a single round. Our opponent at the opening ceremony might be against MEN but who we play in the first match actually has no meaning. It is clear from the schedule that in the entire regular season, each team will play against each other once. Finally, based on the accumulated wins, the top eight teams will compete to enter the next playoffs stage.\u201dThen he slowly raised his eyes. \u201cThe coach\u2019s and my meaning is very simple. If you want to ensure that we are promoted to the next stage, we absolutely can\u2019t lose against these teams with absolute strength.\u201dThe group couldn\u2019t help being shocked by this tone and replied, \u201cUnderstood!\u201dLin Yan had been sitting silently without speaking. Just then, he saw something interesting on his phone and laughed. \u201cHave you seen the pre-match predictions on Weibo?\u201dBi Yaohua frowned with disgust. \u201cThey are still doing such a broken thing?\u201dGu Luo was a bit dazed. \u201cWhat is that?\u201dThe netizens have found something fun to do. It is that before every game, they will guess the winner and loser in advance,\u201d Jian Ye explained while looking at Lin Yan curiously. \u201cThere is actually a pre-match prediction already? Is it about the match between us and MEN during the opening ceremony?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Lin Yan raised an eyebrow. \u201cGuess what the current predicted winning rate is on the Internet?\u201dGu Luo thought about it objectively. \u201cBased on our current strength and MEN\u2019s current strength, our chances of winning should be 80%?\u201dChen Yushen added, \u201cI think it is 90%.\u201d\u201cSorry, the results on the Internet are only 50% and it is on the Weibo of an Internet celebrity who is very popular recently.\u201d Lin Yan found the prediction results more and more novel and finally couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cIt turns out that in the eyes of those in the self-proclaimed circle, our team\u2019s winning rate against MEN is only 50%? We worked so hard before to build up momentum but they didn\u2019t pay attention to it!\u201dMEN might be playing under the banner of the dark horse team but judging from their previous match records, it wasn\u2019t enough. If there were no surprises, among all the teams in the autumn competition, the strength of the MEN team really required the blessing of Heaven to qualify for the quarterfinals.Now the Internet was speculating that the ratio of winning for GH and MEN was 5:5. No matter what, it was an attitude of \u2018not optimistic.\u2019Everyone was a bit unhappy after hearing Lin Yan\u2019s words. Only Bi Yaohua seemed to adapt well.He bit at the potato noodle in the bowl and grinded it down in his mouth.\u201dI\u2019m satisfied. At least from this ratio, netizens still think we have a possibility of winning. According to me, it would be better for them to set our winning percentage as 10% or 20% in the early morning. Then once the opening ceremony is over and we gain a crushing victory, I can at least ask those people if they need to go to the plastic surgery hospital to save their faces.\u201dEveryone else was amused at once and couldn\u2019t help thinking of gaining a brilliant record in the autumn competition. In the end, they simply used the hot and spicy soup to replace wine, raising their big bowls. \u201cNo matter what they do, it\u2019s all over for them!\u201dJing Yuanzhou and Lin Yan had already gone out to eat a long time ago. Now they raised their water glasses and bumped them against the bowls.The autumn competition came as scheduled. Compared with the previous mid-season, the participating teams in the autumn competition hadn\u2019t changed much. Only LARK\u2019s quota had been officially replaced by the brand new team, GH. As the most watched new force in the league, GH got into the business car early and officially set off on their journey in the professional league.Since all professional teams would be at the opening ceremony, the scene around the stadium had never been more exciting. Fans of the big teams filled the surrounding streets and the business car circled around in a big circle before finally avoiding the fierce crowd and parking in the internal parking lot.The moment they got out of the car, a large group of security guards came and nervously escorted the members of GH into the safe passage to the lounge prepared. It was the first time for Gu Luo and Chen Yushen to experience this formal event. They followed behind the group of security guards, their faces so tense that there was a lack of expression.Jian Ye had played in the secondary league previously and couldn\u2019t help joking, \u201cI think these big bodyguards are a bit too nervous. The fans outside might be enthusiastic but it isn\u2019t for our team. Even if someone sneaks behind us to stop us, it is probably\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are probably our black fans.\u201d Bi Yaohua smiled. \u201cStill, I think the security guard brothers are right to be nervous. The black fans\u2019 combat effectiveness is much stronger than the true love fans! It will be really hard if the scene is torn up.\u201dDon\u2019t mention Gu Luo and Chen Yushen, even the solemn security guards almost couldn\u2019t maintain their stiffness. The entire atmosphere was relaxed.The team entered the lounge arranged by the organizers. After closing the door, they could hear footsteps passing by from time to time. Obviously, players from other teams had also started to arrive. Gu Luo sat in a chair facing the wall, breathing deeply repeatedly to control his nervousness.Jian Ye noticed this and couldn\u2019t help leaning over to ask curiously, \u201cHow are you Gloy? Do you need to go to the bathroom today?\u201dGu Luo\u2019s face was red. \u201cBrother Gun, can you stop talking about this!\u201dThere was a burst of laughter.Just then, there was a knock on the door of the lounge. A staff member poked in his head. \u201cTitans, are you ready? The opening ceremony is about to begin.\u201dAs GH\u2019s representative at the opening ceremony, Jing Yuanzhou stood up after hearing these words. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dBefore leaving, he didn\u2019t forget to tidy up his team uniform. Then he paused slightly when passing by Lin Yan. He looked over without speaking. Lin Yan met this gaze and instinctively stretched out a hand to smooth the wrinkles on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s shoulders, patting them gently. \u201cNo problem. You can rest assured and go.\u201dHe didn\u2019t notice that his action was a bit too skillful. Forget the GH team members, even the staff member who came to give the reminder couldn\u2019t help being slightly stunned.A smile flashed in Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes, I\u2019m going.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that he had obtained agreement, the more he thought about it, the more wrong he felt. \u201cIt is really a problem! Previously, they kept playing together and they also secretly ran out for a late night snack without us, right?\u201dGu Luo listened by the side, his mouth twitching. He looked like he wanted to talk but was hesitating.Bi Yaohua didn\u2019t want to pay attention to this fool but he couldn\u2019t help glancing at Jian Ye speechlessly. \u201cDid you just find out now?\u201dJian Ye shook in place. \u201cYou already knew?!\u201dGu Luo finally couldn\u2019t help murmuring softly, \u201cIn fact\u2026 it has been a long time.\u201dChen Yushen was a bit confused at first before pausing. He recalled something and a strange look finally flashed in his eyes.Jian Ye looked at Gu Luo and Bi Yaohua. Then he stared deeply at the closed door and rubbed his temples hard. \u201cDon\u2019t speak, I have to slow down.\u201dBi Yaohua smiled but considerately covered his mouth to not make a sound. The others stayed silent to let Jian Ye digest it by himself.Lin Yan came back and encountered such an overly quiet atmosphere in the lounge. He couldn\u2019t help glancing around in amazement. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with all of you? Are you uncomfortable?\u201dBi Yaohua endured his desire to laugh. \u201cNo, Gun Gun realized something just now and needs to savor it in his heart.\u201dLin Yan turned to Jian Ye. \u201cWhat understanding? Wait until after the match is over. Don\u2019t be too distracted at this time.\u201dJian Ye caught a glimpse of Bi Yaohua smiling in his chair and secretly gritted his teeth. \u201cI know, Coach.\u201dLin Yan nodded, grabbed the remote control and turned on the TV screen in the lounge. \u201cOkay, look at the screen.\u201dIn fact, the so-called opening ceremony was nothing more than the appearance of the representative players of all participating teams. It was a simple exchange of a few sentences. This was just a simple event but for fans of each team, it was already considered an absolute benefit.The lights at the venue turned on, the entire venue was silent for a moment and then there was a wave of screams that almost directly overturned the roof. The lounge was so far away but the people inside could still hear the cheers.Gu Luo covered his trembling heart and spoke emotionally, \u201cSo this is the scene of the autumn competition\u2026\u201dBi Yaohua laughed with disapproval. \u201cWhat about this? Once it is time to reach the finals, you can feel real enthusiasm. The fans who came now are all fans of other teams. Once it is the day of the finals, at least half the stadium will be our supporters. It is really cool!\u201dHis words were so logical that the others heard it and their hearts were full of excitement. The look in their eyes was incomparably eye-catching.At the scene, the host had already started to introduce every big team and their representatives in turn. The players who could represent the team were basically the captains such as Jing Yuanzhou and Luni of LDF. Of course, it wasn\u2019t ruled out for several teams to arrange the core player of the team to appear on their behalf, such as PAY\u2019s AI and Three\u2019s Wuhoo.Every time a representative player appeared, there was bound to be a storm of applause in the venue. In such a warm atmosphere, the host naturally didn\u2019t forget a few simple interviews. Among the regular questions for the various teams, it was inevitable that the two issues of \u2018expectations for this year\u2019s results\u2019 and \u2018opponents you are looking forward to\u2019 will be mentioned.Luni of the LDF team always gave a perfect answer on such occasions. \u201cIt will be great if we can win the championship. Of course, we won\u2019t be too regretful if we can\u2019t achieve it. In general, just do our best. This can be regarded as the best confession for the fans for LDF. Huh? If I have to say the opponent I anticipate\u2026 I\u2019m tired of playing most of the teams now. From this point of view, I want to look at the new GH who has just joined the league.\u201dAI of the PAY team obviously didn\u2019t like this type of entertainment interview process. He frowned during the entire interview process. \u201cOf course, the goal is to be the champions. If it is the opponent then playing everyone is the same. I have to choose one? Then just GH. They are quite interesting.\u201dKu Tianlu of the BK team had been captain for this period of time and his official tone was decent. \u201cThe main goal of BK this year is to not disappoint fans but I am also looking forward to playing against GH. The current relationship between our two teams is very good. Since we are competing on the field, this can be regarded as a welcome ceremony for them entering the league.\u201dWuhoo of Three gave an even more perfunctory answer. \u201cThe goal is to guarantee second and strive for first. As for who I want to fight against\u2026 they have all chosen GH so I will choose GH as well.\u201dSUU\u2019s captain Peng He put it simply, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to GH.\u201dThe players were interviewed one by one. Listening to their answers, the expressions of the audience members subtly changed.No matter if it was the spring or autumn competition, every opening ceremony had this process. However, each team would pay tribute to each other. Basically, the strong teams would get one or two mentions.Then what was going on today? Did all these teams make an appointment to point the finger at the GH team who had just entered the professional league?It had to be known, it was already very strong for a new team to reach the quarterfinals. Was there any team that had such a strong presence in the interview session of the opening ceremony!Before this, there was a lot of discussion on the Internet that the Burning Hot Assembly variety show was completely the product of the professional league\u2019s top management. Therefore, every time there was a mention of the GH team, the first feeling was that they were only on the level of a men\u2019s variety show team. It was reasonable to say that such a team would exit after one regular season. Therefore, no matter how much they thought about it, they couldn\u2019t understand why these top players would take such a team so seriously?Did the officials arrange this interview in advance with the top players? If not, did the GH team really have such strength? Ordinary fans had no way of knowing what happened during the training matches. After this process, they were full of question marks.At this point, all the interviews were complete and it was at last GH\u2019s turn. Once the camera lens fell on Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s body, the bustling scene instantly fell silent. Part of this silence stemmed from curiosity about the team and some of it came from the complicated mood created by the player himself.In particular, the old fans of BK. Previously, they could always see Jing Yuanzhou in this event but back then, he was Titans, the captain of BK. Today, it was still the familiar face but the uniform he was wearing was no longer BK\u2019s uniform. Jing Yuanzhou was now the captain of GH.They wanted to say \u2018welcome back\u2019 but the BK fans who followed him for many years had a thousand words and didn\u2019t know where to start.Unlike other teams, this was the first time GH had appeared in the professional league so the host was prepared to ask a few more questions. Jing Yuanzhou had long been accustomed to such an occasion and he answered with great calm.The host asked about the expectations of the big teams for GH and Jing Yuanzhou paused for a moment, a faint smile on his face. \u201cThank you for the recognition. In order to live up to your expectations, GH will win the championship trophy in this autumn competition.\u201dThere were clearly no fluctuations in his tone but the words had an aggravating effect that fiercely hit everyone\u2019s hearts. The originally calm scene exploded in an instant.Luni shook his head when he heard it. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even played a mid-season game. They have just arrived at this arena yet he dares to speak like this.\u201dWuhoo smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t say it. His team really is a bit interesting.\u201dNext to him, AI didn\u2019t speak. He just looked down at the ground with an impatient \u2018when will this end\u2019 expression. The other representative players had different expressions and rubbed their pained heads. They sensed that this year\u2019s autumn competition was likely to not be peaceful.The scene was broadcasted live to those in the lounge. Lin Yan couldn\u2019t hide the smile on his face at all. He couldn\u2019t help glancing at the man on the big screen. He clapped his hands and said, \u201cOkay, your captain has warmed up the venue in advance. Get up and move around. Be ready to play.\u201dLuo Mo had returned to the lounge after completing the registration of the players. He crouched down with his mobile phone and unsurprisingly, he saw that Internet public opinion exploded following the interview.He couldn\u2019t help the corners of his mouth twitching. Was it a hot spot? Wasn\u2019t it more like a bombing spot?The opening ended smoothly and Jing Yuanzhou returned to the lounge to briefly check his peripherals. Subsequently, the members of GH headed to the field under the guidance of the staff members.Lin Yan stood at the back and raised his eyes slightly, his gaze passing over the figures in the distance that couldn\u2019t be seen clearly. There was a slight smile in his eyes. This battlefield, they were finally here\u2026On the commentary stage, the official commentators were already introducing them with great passion. Due to the interview with Jing Yuanzhou just now, the scene didn\u2019t need warming up at all. The atmosphere was already extremely strong.Lin Yan took a deep breath and raised the headphones hanging around his neck. The moment he put it on, all the noise outside was completely isolated, leaving nothing but tranquility. Lin Yan gave a soft \u2018hello\u2019 and didn\u2019t wait for the others to answer. He continued to speak lightly, \u201cThis is the opening match. Crush them.\u201dEveryone knew that the strength of MEN was only mid to low among the professional teams. It was just that the public liked to make trouble. They didn\u2019t have much expectation for MEN but after Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s interview, they started to hope that MEN could fight back well in today\u2019s opening match.The game officially began under the spotlight. In this round of BO1, MEN\u2019s performance could be considered their best state. Their overall standard was significantly higher than their performance in the mid-season.Unfortunately, their opponents played as fiercely as ever. The GH team seemed to pull out all the stops and swept through the entire field in the blink of an eye. The autumn opening match ended in just 32 minutes. The number of kills was 22:8.As Lin Yan requested, GH completed their debut in the autumn competition with an absolutely strong performance. Their posture was just like their \u2018Go Home\u2019 team name\u2014strong and rampant to the extreme.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

From the beginning of the ceremony to the opening match, the barrage in the live broadcast room never stopped. During the initial interview stage, there were no shortage of people mocking GH for being pretentious. Then the match officially started and it was covered in cheers for the MEN team.However, it wasn\u2019t difficult for netizens who followed MEN\u2019s previous games to find that the number of supporters in this match was a bit excessive. It wasn\u2019t clear if those who suddenly appeared were MEN\u2019s true fans or GH\u2019s black fans. Finally, the barrage was completely silenced by the almost impeccable performance of the GH team.At the end of the match, GH\u2019s players could be seen taking off their headphones. They headed to the other side to shake hands with the players of MEN. Then they stepped down, walked off the stage and hugged the man waiting under the stage one by one.The big screen cut to that area and the face of the young coach was displayed in front of the audience. Anyone who knew the GH team wouldn\u2019t be unfamiliar with this Coach Lin. Since the establishment of GH, he had always been by the side of his team, from the variety show all the way to the professional league.The other team members had already embraced and only the last person was left. The originally indifferent coach seemed to pause for a moment. He looked up at the close-up shot on the big screen before a smile appeared on his face.The two of them looked at each other for a while. Then they hugged, gently patting each other\u2019s backs. It was clearly the same action as before but after changing the person, a strange ambiguity appeared on the screen.After a moment of silence, screams came from one corner after another. Fans of the other teams looked up blankly and saw that the few GH supporters suddenly became agitated. It wasn\u2019t known who took the lead but there were waves \u2018Parents love is true!\u2019In the post-match interview, the host handed the microphone to the match\u2019s MVP, Gu Luo. Before this, no one thought that the best performer in this year\u2019s opening match would actually be such an unknown new mid-laner.It was the first time Gu Luo was facing the camera lens alone like this. It was hard for him to overcome the nervousness of going on stage and at this time, he couldn\u2019t help blushing under the attention of the public.He couldn\u2019t specifically remember what the host asked. He just looked at the camera mechanically and stammered uncontrollably. \u201cH-Hello everyone, thank you for your support of our GH team. I\u2019m very happy to have such a good performance in today\u2019s match. I believe that in this regular season, we will go back home\u2026 no! I mean, our Go Home, we will definitely maintain our momentum and se\u2026 send, all, opponents, home!\u201dHe took a deep breath to finish the final words forcefully. Then he sighed with relief.Gu Luo just thought that he completed the task and his first reaction was a quick exit. As a result, he didn\u2019t pay attention to the action of the host next to him and gave a very standard 90 degree bow to the camera.Everything happened so unexpectedly that it almost knocked over the female host who just came over. The scene became chaotic as microphones scattered all over the place.Lin Yan was helping the other team members packing their things in the lounge. He inadvertently raised his head and saw the scene on the TV. \u201cAh Mo, go and greet those in the PR department. Let them prepare to give PR training to the team members. As for Gloy\u2019s interview, people who don\u2019t know anything might think we cheated him into the team and forcefully brainwashed him?\u201dBi Yaohua watched it with gusto. \u201cDon\u2019t do it Coach! This is Gloy\u2019s personal characteristic! Doesn\u2019t he have a lot of mom fans? Once this interview gets out, the material love will be more widespread and his popularity is absolutely guaranteed!\u201dLin Yan looked back with a smile. \u201cWhat about you? I remember that the Trash Talk King has a lot of father fans right? So after you get the MVP, are you going to put on a good show during the interview? Gloy has maternal love while you have paternal love. From this point of view, the fans of our GH team are really a loving family!\u201dJian Ye helped in a timely manner. \u201cThe coach is right!\u201d\u201cWhat is right?!\u201d Bi Yaohua almost choked on his own saliva. \u201cCoach, don\u2019t say that. Do those idiots who bite my ass everyday deserve to be my father? I have to think about whether I want to recognize them as unfilial children or grandchildren first.\u201d\u201cYes, then think about it slowly.\u201d Lin Yan didn\u2019t continue this topic. However, Bi Yaohua had reminded him to click into the interface of the live broadcast room and he was a bit surprised when he saw the barrage. \u201cTsk, I didn\u2019t expect for the audience to really eat Gloy\u2019s style\u2026\u201dThe live broadcast room at this time was a sea of laughter. The heat was no less than when they swept through the field during the game.[Hahahaha, what is going on with this mid-laner of the GH team? He is making me nervous.][I can\u2019t stand it. Isn\u2019t he too cute?][Damn, is he really the one who got five kills on the field just now? The style is completely different!][Indeed, the match was so fierce that when I watched GH coming down just now, I thought the man with the scar was the mid-laner\u2026][I\u2019m laughing to death. Wake up. The one with the scar is Brother Gun. Brother Gun played the big-breasted healer!][Yes, you don\u2019t understand the gentleness of our male mother~~][???][I want to take the liberty to ask, is the contrast cuteness GH\u2019s team culture?][Don\u2019t say that. Isn\u2019t BB\u2019s shamate style head and his temperament consistent enough?][Fuck, looking at it this way, why do I feel like there is nothing good in GH?]The final audience interaction session was still going on at the opening ceremony. The entries #GH\u2019s team culture#, #current style of e-sports players#, #autumn season opening match# and #GH\u2019s strength# boarded the hot search one after another.Gu Luo returned to the lounge with a lowered head after the interview.He could feel that the interview was a complete collapse. He had wanted to speak tough but there was no effect. He had wanted to be calm and almost knocked down the host. He had wanted to show off but he stuttered as he spoke. Finally, he desperately wanted to dig a hole to bury himself in.Gu Luo was mentally prepared but his teammates didn\u2019t laugh at him as expected. By this time, everyone in the lounge had already packed up their things. Bi Yaohua carried a bag in one hand and rubbed the grandma gray hair with his other hand as he passed by. \u201cYou\u2019re finally back, MVP rookie.\u201dJian Ye followed from behind and gently patted Gu Luo like he was a puppy. \u201cNot bad, not bad. Keep up the good work. We will rely on you for our team\u2019s new popularity.\u201dEven Chen Yushen passing by tried to reach out and touch it. He was presumably surprised to find that it felt good. After a pause, he couldn\u2019t help touching it twice more.Gu Luo\u2019s head was rubbed a few times and he was a bit shy. Then he looked up and found that Jing Yuanzhou had come to his side. Gu Luo saw his own captain and instinctively paused. He was instinctively preparing to send his head up when Jing Yuanzhou handed over his bag. \u201cYour things are already here. Let\u2019s go back.\u201dGu Luo was stunned for a moment before coming back to his senses. \u201cAh\u2026 thank you, Captain.\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. It is your coach who helped you clean up.\u201dGu Luo looked back. \u201cThank you, Coach!\u201dLin Yan walked over to Gu Luo, his broad palms naturally covering this person\u2019s head. The hair that had just been erected was suddenly squashed. \u201cDon\u2019t thank me. Before the next match, prepare some interview drafts in advance. I found that you didn\u2019t realize interviews are necessary after winning a match.\u201dGu Luo didn\u2019t expect that after going around in a circle, the problem he was most worried about eventually came back. His face was hot and his entire head was lowered as he replied helplessly, \u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019ll pay attention next time.\u201dUnder the guidance of the staff, the group of people went through the safe passage to the parking lot. They had planned to take the business car back to the club, but the moment they walked out of the exit, the scene in the parking lot stunned everyone.No one thought that the teams who came today hadn\u2019t left yet. At a glance, they could see the brightly colored uniforms. These people were gathered in groups of three to five to talk. Then they noticed GH\u2019s appearance and stopped communicating with each other.Lin Yan glanced at it briefly and raised his eyebrow with surprise. BK, LDF, Three, PAY\u2026 none of the present top teams in the league were absent. He felt a moment of consternation at this scene but he also understood it.He glanced over and saw that the man next to him was also showing a rare stunned expression. Such an expression was so rare that Lin Yan couldn\u2019t help taking a second look before opening his mouth with a smile, \u201cThis arrangement is so big. Aren\u2019t they waiting for you?\u201dThe moment he spoke, a few people emerged from the crowd not far away.\u201cThen let\u2019s go first. Captain, we\u2019ll wait for you in the car.\u201d Bi Yaohua was particularly sharp-eyed at this time. His shooter\u2019s precise intuition played a role as he quickly found the escape route and grabbed the others to run away.Lin Yan gently patted Jing Yuanzhou on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry and chat slowly.\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s gaze skimmed over his face. \u201cOkay.\u201dLuni saw everything. Once Lin Yan was far away, he asked in a mocking tone, \u201cThis type of chatting requires your coach\u2019s approval?\u201dJing Yuanzhou was indifferent. \u201cYes, we have strict family education.\u201dLuni couldn\u2019t tease this person and choked up instead. It took him a long time to let out a word. \u201cFuck!\u201dSo proud of being supervised?In a rare manner, AI\u2019s attention was attracted. \u201cThis coach is the one who was playing jungler at the time? When can I make an appointment for a doubles match?\u201dJing Yuanzhou answered, \u201cIt\u2019s inconvenient. He only lines up with me.\u201dAI was frowning when DeMen next to them stopped it in time. \u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter if it can\u2019t be arranged. We can go back and play together.\u201dAI glanced at Demen without much interest. \u201cWhatever.\u201dJing Yuanzhou looked around and laughed. \u201cSo what are you all doing here? If I remember correctly, today is the opening ceremony and not the closing ceremony right? Are you all so leisurely that you can come over?\u201dJust now, a group of great gods were talking and Ku Tianlu didn\u2019t dare open his mouth. He heard this and finally found a chance to interrupt. \u201cIt\u2019s because today is the opening and GH\u2019s first public appearance so we\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, he heard the loud voice of the teenager next to him. \u201cMaster, welcome back!\u201dSuch a voice passed through the empty surroundings and fell into his ears clearly, each word knocking against his heart. Jing Yuanzhou had guessed it already but his eyes still inevitably shook.Wuhoo and Come of the Three team walked over and reached out their hands. \u201cWelcome back.\u201dJing Yuanzhou shook hands with the two people in turn while smiling. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t been looking at the time on your phone the entire time, I would\u2019ve been more moved by this sentence.\u201dWuhoo raised his eyebrow. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the one who wanted to come. I would be happy without you in the league. However, Come said that everyone from other teams is here. If we don\u2019t come then it will be very impolite. However, it is a waste of time.\u201dCome looked helpless. \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201dJing Yuanzhou had long been used to the duplicity of this great god shooter. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you will soon find that GH is the bigger trouble for you.\u201d\u201cAre you so confident?\u201d Wuhoo glanced at him. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been in the professional league for so long. I can\u2019t tell if your skills have regressed or not but your mouth is still the same as always.\u201dLuni couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cOkay, there isn\u2019t much difference between the two of you. No one can say who is good.\u201dHe noticed the eyes of the two people and cleared his throat. Once he looked at Jing Yuanzhou again, his serious expression was restored and he reached out a hand. \u201cIn any case, welcome back, Titans.\u201dJing Yuanzhou glanced at the particularly delicate and small ponytail at the back of Luni\u2019s head today and his lips were faintly curved. \u201cThank you.\u201dThe afterglow of twilight sprinkled a layer of light on this group of people. The players of other teams looked at the top players in the league from a distance with moved expressions. Was this the friendship between the strongest players in the China division? Yet even if they were touched, they didn\u2019t dare approach rashly. In the end, they were filled with complex and full emotions as they stopped talking.It was just\u2026 just now, it seemed that a few media reporters had secretly \u2018passed by\u2019. Did they need to send a representative to remind the great gods?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe opening ceremony of the autumn competition officially ended in this way. After the opening match, they should\u2019ve entered the regular season. Unexpectedly, the next day, the front page headlines of major e-sports media was completely occupied by the same topic.#Five demon king players gather in the parking lot#, #Titans\u2019s return#, #sympathy between the great gods# and other topics all jumped into the hot search headlines.All the photos after entering these articles were shot with the parking lot in the background. In the distance, they could see the god-level players in the uniforms of each team standing in one place, the light making everything feel very sacred.The photo of Luni and Jing Yuanzhou holding hands was particularly eye-catching. This type of scene where top players gathered together was only seen in official events such as the all-star games or the opening ceremony. At this time, the private contact between this group of players was suddenly exposed. They were all top-traffic god-level players and it wasn\u2019t a surprise that they instantly detonated the Internet.][Fuck, is the parking lot after the opening ceremony so wonderful?][Ahhh, I know that place! I wanted to go there on that day but was stopped by the security guards. I hate it!][What are the great gods playing? Titans\u2019 strength is just that. Is there any need to give such a big shock?][Oh, his strength is just that? Upstairs, do you want to try eating the keyboard?][Wuwuwu, I\u2019m suddenly in tears. Titans is the best in the world. He deserves it!][Oh my god, is this the friendship between the demon king players. Fight to the death on the field while cherishing each other off the field?][Looking at this, the interviews at the opening ceremony weren\u2019t just casual talk. It seems that the professional teams are really caring about GH?][Don\u2019t say anything else. Is a rookie team like GH worth it? At most, I can accept it as giving some face to Titans.][Wuhoo, wake up! Titans is your opponent!][Wait, the last photo\u2026 I suddenly think that the pair of Luni and Titans is a bit good?][The upstairs person finally said my heart! Loving each other while wanting to kill each other, I feel it!][Can sparks collide between the mid-lane and top-lane? Isn\u2019t this it?][Look at the eyes of these two people, look at the smile on Titans\u2019 face! It\u2019s my taste, my taste!][Oh, evil. Get lost! Parents love is true!]Netizens were discussing it on the Internet while the inside of the major clubs was also particularly exciting.The managers of each team almost failed to control themselves and wanted to grab a kitchen knife. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that these top players were the pillars of their team, they would likely lose control and cut them one by one. The roaring voices were full of soul questioning, \u201cWhat were you thinking? Can you tell me what you were thinking at the time?\u201dThe team managers really wanted to break open these players\u2019 heads to understand them. These great gods were usually so reluctant when finding them to shoot publicity and endorsements.The result? They ran to others to stir up free enthusiasm! The other side was now receiving more unprecedented positive enthusiasm than ever! Didn\u2019t they deserve it as managers who worked hard for the club?!In fact, the blame wasn\u2019t on the managers.When the news first came out, it was initially just a pure rivalry friendship. Then it was obvious that the PR department of the GH Club took action at the right time. The direction was gradually brought to the strength of the GH team. Many fans started to join in and shot their names, hoping for some passionate collisions between the other teams and GH on the field.The more that the topic of GH soared in popularity, the more the managers of each team had to take quick-acting heart-saving pills. What was the difference between fucking them up and stepping on their graves to take their traffic?!In particular, Brother Chen, the manager of LDF, almost smashed his phone screen into Luni\u2019s face. He gritted his teeth and squeezed out a sentence, \u201cI would ask you what you were thinking but Luni\u2026 why have I never found that you can build a sense of CP with Titans?\u201dLuni had been ready to be reprimanded when he heard the news early this morning but these words inevitably gave him a pause. \u201cWhat CP feeling?\u201dBrother Chen shook his phone. \u201cIt\u2019s the netizens\u2019 new combination. Congratulations, your record of zero gossip has ended. Surprise! Are you happy?\u201dLuni clearly saw the contents of the comments and stopped eating the deep-fried breadstick in his mouth. \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe was an innocent, straight man who wanted beauty and talent. If there needed to be a scandal, shouldn\u2019t it be with a beautiful anchor? In the end, he formed a CP with a big man like Jing Yuanzhou? How could he be happy?A strange silence flowed between the two men for a moment. Just then, the phone on the table vibrated twice. Luni hadn\u2019t recovered yet as he reached out and saw the source of the message at once. It was the one who had caused his innocence to be destroyed.The other person\u2019s message was very brief. [If you need something then please mention me in the group or contact our coach directly. See you in a month.]Luni couldn\u2019t understand the meaning of these words for a while. He was just about to frown when enlightenment struck and he realized. He used a paper towel to wipe the oil from his fingers, quickly typed a full stop and sent it.Unsurprisingly, he received a notification from WeChat. [Z has turned on friends verification. You are not his (her) friend. Please send a friend verification request. You can only chat to the other person after the verification.]Even if he had a premonition, Luni couldn\u2019t endure it anymore when he saw the message. \u201cFuck, this beast?!\u201dAlthough according to Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s personality, he would probably do some actions to avoid suspicion and prove his innocence but Luni never expected this person to be so crazy.\u2018See me in one month? Oh, never again!\u2019Once the time came, he wouldn\u2019t add this dog man as a friend even if he kneeled down to beg!Meanwhile, Jing Yuanzhou sneezed in GH\u2019s base. Lin Yan raised his head from where he was sitting on the sofa and looked over. \u201cHave you caught a cold?\u201dJing Yuanzhou touched the tip of his nose. \u201cNo.\u201dFreestarLin Yan raised his eyebrow. \u201cThen think about it. Did you recently offend someone?\u201dJing Yuanzhou thought for a moment and told the truth. \u201cI\u2019ve offended too many people and I can\u2019t lock onto one.\u201dLin Yan gave a low laugh before closing his eyes. From a distance, the Weibo interface could be seen on his phone. Lin Yan had been reading the comments just now. There wasn\u2019t much emotion on his face. Only his fingertips moved flexibly on the screen.Jing Yuanzhou had also quietly logged into Weibo to take a look. The content of the comments had been occupied by the evil CP party that came out of nowhere. These people said that his and Luni\u2019s CP had very real feelings and the limelight overshadowed the Parents CP fans. On a whole, the current situation could be described as more serious than ever before.Jing Yuanzhou glanced at Lin Yan\u2019s expression and was silent for a moment. Then he walked slowly to the back of the sofa. Lin Yan\u2019s entire attention was on his phone and he apparently wasn\u2019t paying attention to Jing Yuanzhou. It wasn\u2019t until the man\u2019s shadow slowly fell over him from the back of the sofa that he came back to his senses.The moment he was going to look back, Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s voice entered his ears. \u201cIt seems our Parents love hasn\u2019t been in business for a long time? There are no training arrangements this afternoon. Should we consider giving our CP fans some benefits?\u201dHis breathing was so close that Lin Yan\u2019s ears instantly heated up. At this time, he finally realized Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s intentions. He held back a smile and pushed this person away a bit. \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble. It really doesn\u2019t need to be that way. I\u2019m not that type of careful person.\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re not. \u201c Jing Yuanzhou stood up straight and looked down extremely calmly. \u201cHowever, I am.\u201dSeeing the person in front of him look back in an inquiring manner, Jing Yuanzhou thought for a moment before continuing without hesitation. \u201cWhat should we do? We might not have officially started dating but we have at least determined our status. Now the Internet is talking about the matter between me and Luni in such a straightforward manner. If it leads to my position in the palace being at risk, won\u2019t I cry?\u201dLin Yan stared at Jing Yuanzhou steadily for a while before muttering with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m not crying. Why are you crying?\u201dJing Yuanzhou\u2019s tone was serious. \u201cI really will cry.\u201dLin Yan was a bit stupefied by this attitude and vaguely felt something move in his heart. He was indeed not a careful person but\u2026 it seemed he wasn\u2019t as generous as he seemed. Otherwise, there was no need for him to talk to fans in the comments area.His fingertips moved and Lin Yan calmly deleted the replies he had planned to post under these comments with his side account. Then he cleared his throat. \u201cWell, this is fine. It\u2019s nothing, so I\u2019ll satisfy you.\u201dThree minutes later, Jing Yuanzhou suddenly started live broadcasting without warning. In the short time it took to organize his equipment, the barrage of the live broadcast room became a battle scene between the new TL CP fans and the Parents CP fans.In the midst of the battle, there were people in the barrage trying to inquire about the specific details of what happened in the parking lot. There were some who even wanted to tentatively ask Jing Yuanzhou if he was happy being \u2018favored\u2019 by so many gods at the same time.Jing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t seem to notice the contents of the barrage and there was no interaction in the entire process. Just as his equipment was finally adjusted and he entered his account to log in, a figure suddenly entered the camera of his live broadcast room.Lin Yan handed him a cup of freshly brewed coffee and reminded him, \u201cThere are still training games to be played in the evening so it can only be broadcasted for a while in the afternoon. After all, you should pay more attention to rest after a match.\u201dJing Yuanzhou let out a low hum of agreement. \u201cYou have the final say.\u201dThe barrage paused for a moment without warning. Once Lin Yan finished delivering the coffee, he turned and sat at the next computer. He logged into the game, naturally sent Jing Yuanzhou a team invitation and the two of them entered the queue.Lin Yan checked the keys and after confirming there were no problems, he casually asked, \u201cWhat position do you want to play today?\u201dFreestar\u201cI want to play support. Can you take me?\u201d[This time, can I understand it as being spoiled?][Titans playing support? What type of devil\u2019s live broadcast is this???][Previous person, wake up. The point is that Titans is asking the coach to take him?][I\u2019m sure there will be a new hot search soon.][#Surprise, Titans actually asked people to take him to gain points# doghead.jpg.]Lin Yan paused before nodding in response. \u201cOkay. The support has a lower operation requirement so you can rest.\u201dHe gently stretched his joints. \u201cJust lie down.\u201dJing Yuanzhou smiled. \u201cThank you for taking me to fly.\u201dThe two people chatting and smiling didn\u2019t notice that the barrage of the live broadcast room had long gone completely crazy. The fans of the TL group who were frantically looking for a sense of existence weren\u2019t even in the live broadcast room for 10 minutes before declaring their collapse.Barrage: [Ahhhhh, the coach is so pampering!!!]The author has something to say:Luni: Why do I always get hurt??? In addition, Jing Yuanzhou, you are a real dog!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They quickly completed the match-up and entered the BP interface. It was different from the previous times when he filled in any position. Lin Yan had agreed to take Jing Yuanzhou to earn points so he directly typed in the public screen after entering: [Fourth spot AD.]However, the attention of others wasn\u2019t on him. There was a moment\u2019s pause before people started talking.[New Century Actor: The third spot is\u2026 God Jing?][Mr.T: Yes.][Leave You to Eat Farts: Fuck, a great god is playing? Then asking the great god to take me to fly!][Mr.T: I am playing support.][Leave You to Eat Farts: ???][New Century Actor: What, the wind was a bit strong just now. Can I trouble you to repeat what you just said?][Mr.T: I am playing support.][Mr.T: The fourth person is going to take me to fly.][Who Isn\u2019t a Little Princess: Yes, he is just in charge of lying down and holding my thigh today.]The others fell silent, apparently digesting the huge amount of information between the lines. For a public figure like Jing Yuanzhou, the IDs of the side accounts naturally weren\u2019t a big secret. However, Lin Yan\u2019s ID wasn\u2019t known to many people except CP fans.At this time, the few passersby players were at a loss and just repeatedly had a few thoughts. Titans didn\u2019t take the top lane and changed to play support. Titans was actually lying down and waiting for someone else to take him to fly. The ID of the person who would take him to fly looked like it belonged to a girl\u2026To sum it up: Did Titans become so self-indulgent after leaving BK?!As the passersby players completed the selection process in a muddled manner, the barrage of the live broadcast room was full of laughter.[Hahahah, I can feel the collapse of these friends across the screen.][I just thought about a new headline: Surprise! The top side-lane player is actually\u2026][Other than that, Titans is able to hug the coach\u2019s thigh so skillfully. I really didn\u2019t expect it.][Am I the only one curious about how well Titans can play a support?][He selected the fluorescent fairy. How well can he play? Taking out this hero shows he is ready to muddle along.][The taste of this technique fan has been caught by the coach\u2019s jungler. I don\u2019t know if I should have expectations for today\u2019s shooter.][You judge, you judge, did the words Titans sent out just now seem like a pretty boy living off a rich woman?][Pfft, brother in front, once you accept this setting\u2026][??? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s poisonous. I can\u2019t change it!]Jing Yuanzhou glanced at the barrage during the game introduction and happened to see the last few messages. He couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cIn fact, there is nothing wrong with living off someone, especially if it is Coach Lin\u2019s food which is very delicious\u2026 Huh? Who is richer between Coach Lin and me?\u201dJing Yuanzhou didn\u2019t need to think about this question and blurted out, \u201cOf course he is richer than me. Let me put it this way. The money in my card right now was given by the coach\u2026 private money? It is a bit wrong for you to say this. In any case, the money can be considered as in exchange for proper labor. It is legitimate labor income and the channels are legal.\u201d[Hahahaha, fake, continue to fabricate things!][Titan\u2019s mouth is a deceitful ghost.][It is all about selling. Can it still be legal?]Lin Yan heard Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s ambiguous words through the headphones and wasn\u2019t surprised to see that the barrage had completely exploded. He thought of the scandal with Luni today and slightly raised an eyebrow.As the game character refreshed, he bought equipment to go out while speaking indifferently, \u201cAren\u2019t you embarrassed to mention selling yourself? I paid such a high fee but now you are lying down and letting me do the work. The barrage saying you\u2019re living off me really isn\u2019t wronging you.\u201dJing Yuanzhou hadn\u2019t expected Lin Yan to suddenly say this. He paused for a moment before laughing. \u201cIt is true that I am indeed wrong.\u201dLin Yan started to clear the soldiers without delay. \u201cWell, your attitude of admitting mistakes is okay.\u201dJing Yuanzhou suggested, \u201cThen you should lie down and let me do it.\u201dLin Yan moved accurately and avoided the skills from the opponent. He instantly pushed the other shooter back under the tower and glanced at Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s delicate figure. \u201cYou are this fairy. Can you do it?\u201dJing Yuanzhou smile. \u201cIn any case, I will be able to satisfy you.\u201dThe two of them were joking and didn\u2019t notice that the barrage in the live broadcast room was going crazy.[At this scale, won\u2019t the live broadcast room be sealed?][Just now my mother asked me why my color suddenly changed.][Do these two people usually talk like this? What is with these ambiguous words?][I was wrong. I am underage and shouldn\u2019t be here.][Parents love has always been a special show for adults and isn\u2019t suitable for children. Children should obediently go to their guardian.][After listening to too much trash talk, hearing this type of talk is actually comfortable?][As for the naturalness of this dialogue, I\u2019m sure the two of them must\u2019ve done it!][This is irrefutable proof that Titans is the newly promoted pornographic anchor.][It seems there is no sense of violation when replacing the word \u2018come\u2019 to \u2018move\u2019?][Ahhhhh fuck. I fucking became stiff. How can these two men be so flirty?]However, Jing Yuanzhou did what he said. It could be seen on the screen that the fluorescent fairy suddenly took the initiative.Accurate predictive control, crucial shield protection, predicting the ganks of the enemy players\u2026 it was obviously such a weak and soft support character but Jing Yuanzhou gave it the feeling of playing a front row tank support.He walked through the rain of bullets and exquisitely avoided most of the skills. He took advantage of the bushes to play around with the few people chasing behind him. Finally, he used the flash skill to avoid a fatal blow.In the entire process, Lin Yan just needed to stand in the rear and output without any burden. By the time the game reached 12 minutes, under Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s protection, Lin Yan directly developed into a shooter who could take a head with several shots.The jungler who was the first player to speak to them came to gank a few times. After seeing Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s series of operations that were like flowing water, he could only feel admiration. God Jing\u2019s skills in picking up girls was really amazing! If he was that shooter, he would\u2019ve completely fallen for the tenderness of this support! Absolutely! Truly amazing!Seeing that the round was about to end, Lin Yan suddenly spoke into the microphone. \u201cOkay, it was cool. Thank you. Don\u2019t work hard now. Lie down and let me do it for you.\u201dJing Yuanzhou heard that Lin Yan wanted to give him a break and took a sip of the coffee that was next to him. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201dThey played a total of four ranking games in this afternoon\u2019s live broadcast. However, the amount of information in the entire process was a bit large. The audience of the live broadcast room was still a bit confused even after Jing Yuanzhou stopped broadcasting.On the dark screen, the barrage still appeared quickly.[Why is Coach Lin\u2019s shooter so strong?][Why do I feel that the atmosphere between them is really strange?!][Fuck, surely it isn\u2019t real?][Speaking of which, Coach Lin is so skilled. Why isn\u2019t he a professional player? He isn\u2019t older than Titans, right?][Yes, why isn\u2019t he signed to GH? Does the coach himself not want it or is management stupid?][I only care about Titans\u2019 sale fee\u2026][I have one thing to say. Doesn\u2019t Titans listen to Coach Lin too much? Did he care about the coaching team when he was at BK?][Speaking of the coaching team, doesn\u2019t it say that GH\u2019s owner is very rich? Why is Coach Lin the only one showing up?][There is no problem for the coach to show up every day but I feel that he is involved in everything about GH.][I remember that the boss behind GH is the Lin Group? Oh, wait! Lin?][!!! Coach Lin also has the last name Lin\u2026]For e-sports clubs, the attention of the netizens was basically on the professional players. As for the boss behind the club, most had just heard about it. However, it was clearly discussed in today\u2019s barrage. One Sherlock Holmes found clues on the Internet, peeling back layers to find the coach\u2019s identity.Lin Yan was also the prince of the Lin Group.Barrage: [Fuck, fuck, fuck?!!!]So the boss who bought Titans from BK for 35 million yuan was Coach Lin?![No wonder why Titans said that all the money in his card is from the coach. Isn\u2019t this selling himself?]After finding out this knowledge and looking back at the previous things, everyone couldn\u2019t help falling silent. They really wanted to stop their brains but the more they thought about it, the more they felt they had irrefutable evidence that Titans was being supported\u2026The local rich person sought true love and spent a lot of money just to make the great god smile. He didn\u2019t hesitate to set up a huge e-sports club to eventually win the championship\u2014this script was simply too touching!In fact, Lin Yan had never hidden his identity but they didn\u2019t pay attention to it. Over time, people just considered him a coach. Unexpectedly, he just accompanied Jing Yuanzhou for a few double matches and after dinner, the Internet turned over his identity.Originally, Lin Yan\u2019s popularity was mainly with the CP fans. Then recently, the name of the GH team itself brought its own traffic. Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s topic had always been extremely high. The two people joining together created another wave of hot searches and the posture of rising up was extremely legendary.Lin Yan casually opened an entry and looked at it. With one glance, he saw a popular title. \u201c\u2026The Overbearing Coach and the God-level Side-Lane Player?\u201d???What was this?The other person was in a good state of acceptance and didn\u2019t forget to congratulate him. \u201cCongratulations, you saved money on publicity expenses.\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help looking up at Jing Yuanzhou. He originally wanted to make some complaints but thinking about it carefully, it was indeed true.After weighing the pros and cons, Lin Yan didn\u2019t ask Luo Mo to spend money to withdraw the hot search. He threw the phone away and turned to arrange the training content for the night.Forget it, it wasn\u2019t a secret anyway. He wouldn\u2019t send away the free heat. Let them be!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The E-Sports Circle\u2019s Toxic Assembly Campchapter 82.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe heat on the Internet lasted two whole days. During this process, there were no waves in the GH base. Everyone knew the \u2018relationship\u2019 between them so the GH players basically entered the tacit Buddhist mode.After all, their captain and coach hadn\u2019t come out publicly so they naturally didn\u2019t dare ask or say anything. On the contrary, they always paid attention to the situation of the closet door. They had to be prepared to sacrifice themselves when appropriate. The team spirit ignited without warning. The tacit understanding of the team also reached its highest point due to this strange cause.However, the person involved, Lin Yan was completely unaware of this. He had no idea that the youngsters in the family were worried about him.The regular season had officially opened so Lin Yan devoted all his attention to preparing for the match. On the third day after the opening ceremony, GH ushered in the second match of the autumn season. This time, the opponent was the AIR team.All matches during the regular season would be held in the arenas of three first-tier cities. This week\u2019s host city was Ningcheng, which was where the Burning Hot League\u2019s headquarters was located. It wasn\u2019t too far from GH\u2019s base. After lunch that day, everyone boarded the business car with their peripherals.On the way to the arena, Luo Mo used his phone to take a few daily photos for publicity. After arriving at the parking lot, they followed the staff to the lounge.The day before yesterday, Lin Yan had told everyone about AIR\u2019s style of play. At this time, he had stopped cramming but there was always a strange feeling along the way. He leaned back lazily against the sofa with a thoughtful expression.Jing Yuanzhou approached when he noticed Lin Yan\u2019s expression and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dLin Yan frowned slightly. \u201cI can\u2019t tell. I just feel that something is weird today. I always feel that many people are staring at us.\u201dBi Yaohua couldn\u2019t help looking over and correcting it. \u201cCoach, your feelings aren\u2019t wrong. However, they weren\u2019t staring at us. They are simply staring at you.\u201dLin Yan wondered, \u201cWhy are they looking at me?\u201dBi Yaohua looked surprised. \u201cDon\u2019t you know how popular the person who burst out recently is?\u201dLin Yan wondered, \u201cWho is it?\u201dHe had been studying tactics against AIR for the past two days and didn\u2019t care too much about other things.Bi Yaohua held his forehead while counting with his fingers. \u201cLook, you have the best game skills and the best coaching tactics. The most important thing is that you are the club\u2019s golden boss behind the scenes. Tsk! Talent and appearance co-exists and you are also rich. This is the perfect male image in many love stories! It isn\u2019t surprising that some people covet you, don\u2019t you think?\u201dLin Yan almost choked on air. He had stopped paying attention for one day and the rumors outside had become exaggerated to this extent?In fact, Bi Yaohua was usually more ostentatious. This time, he considered Jing Yuanzhou\u2019s presence and was relatively euphemistic. The situation on the Internet was much more exciting than what he said. In a nutshell, their coach was on fire!Lin Yan had been busy these days but Jing Yuanzhou had paid close attention to the comments on the Internet. At this time, he just smiled. \u201cHowever, it is estimated they can only covet him.\u201dThe other people in the lounge heard this sentence and fell silent.Captain, there was no need to abuse the single dogs. They all knew that the coach had a partner, okay!The match was about to start. A staff member came to notify them about it when they came across this sour atmosphere. Everyone in GH immediately grabbed their equipment bags and walked out of the lounge without looking back. \u201cMatch! Go to the match!\u201dThe AIR team hadn\u2019t performed well in the mid-season. At that time, it had been hard for them to beat LARK and return their professional league qualification. In terms of strength alone, it was much weaker than the MEN team they had met in the opening match.Theoretically speaking, the current GH should be at ease playing against AIR, but Lin Yan still bothered to make arrangements. He couldn\u2019t say he was worried. He just didn\u2019t want any accidents. He also wanted to protect the new tactics as much as possible while ensuring the winning rate.The accumulation of points in the regular season was mainly to make it into the top eight. This might be important but the truly wise team would be absolutely unwilling to expose too much of the lineup at this stage.The things that really pressured others definitely couldn\u2019t be used in this period of time. Showing the trump cards too early was equal to giving the opponents made opportunities to prepare before the battle. There were still the quarter-finals, semi-finals and finals\u2026 looking further, there was even the future world championship.For a team, there was no retreat if their foundation was exposed too early. Therefore, practicing a new system was a science and how to maximize the use of this system was another science. A careful person like Lin Yan was naturally racking his brain to push all the chips of their team to the extreme.The BP process soon ended. Lin Yan finished his mission and walked down from the stage. Not surprisingly, he felt the scene suddenly boiling.Many of the fans present today were GH fans and these fans were loyal viewers of the previous Burning Hot Assembly. They still had vivid memories of the warm-up game with the LARK team on the day of the finals. At this time, they saw the exact same lineup on the big screen and it was indeed difficult not to blow up.The format for this BO1 was exactly the same as the warm-up game at that time, except that the LARK team was replaced with the current AIR team. The ultimate output lineup of four assassins once again appeared in the arena without warning.\u201cHahaha, daring to release this? Shouldn\u2019t the AIR coach have studied GH before the match?\u201d\u201cI think it was studied but they probably didn\u2019t expect the Go Home team to be so wild in the professional league.\u201d\u201cI have to say that AIR\u2019s BP is already very vigorous. If the strong heroes in this version of the game were released then it would be even worse, right?\u201d\u201cSure enough, AIR\u2019s hero pool is still too soft. There aren\u2019t many who play assassin heroes and the routines are obvious.\u201d\u201cWhy do I feel like Coach Lin is a great master? Both AIR and LARK are bottom teams so let them enjoy the same treatment?\u201d\u201cThe last sentence I gave to LARK will also be sent to AIR: May there be no slaughter in Heaven! Hahaha!\u201d\u201cChe, is it interesting to play the same routines every day? Does GH have no new tricks?\u201d\u201cListening to this tone, is it a black fan? In fact, there is no need to be black just for the sake of being black.\u201d\u201cIndeed, it is normal to keep back tactics in the regular season. It would be stupid to expose it in advance.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Why care so much? Just win!\u201dGH did win this match and the win was pretty excellent. AIR wasn\u2019t even able to hold on until the team battle stage. Their lanes were completely crushed. It took only 30 minutes to end this one-sided game.Obviously, the current AIR team was a lot stronger than LARK during the previous warm-up game. However, the GH team was fiercer and more decisive than back then. This type of transformation was too obvious and every moment of collision on the field had a strange brilliance.If the original match against MEN was still suspected of being won through luck, the victory in this match completely caused the so-called passersby to have no doubts about the strength of the new team, GH.In this match, the MVP was Jing Yuanzhou and the interview process was much easier than Gu Luo\u2019s interview.On the way back after the match, Lin Yan took out the schedule and flipped through it. Then he couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cSpeaking of which, our team really deserves to be the \u2018son\u2019 of the league.\u2019 The schedule is almost comparable to the first-tier teams.\u201dThe regular reason lasted a total of four weeks. During this period, all teams would play a single cycle of BO1 against every team in turn. No teams could be avoided but the specific order of matches was extremely careful.The low ranked teams such as MEN, AIR, PILL etc were basically experience babies in the early stages. In a short period of two weeks, they were arranged against all the major teams to lay the foundation for the ranking of these teams. As for whether they could enter the top eight, it depended on their scoring during the last two weeks.Compared to these teams who could be regarded as giving away their heads, the playing arrangement for GH from weak to strong was simply top treatment. Based on the schedule, they wouldn\u2019t meet any strong teams in the early stages. Top giants such as Three and PAY would only be met after the third week. This made scoring in the early stages easier.In the first week of the regular season, a total of three matches was arranged for GH. Following the crushing victory in the previous two matches, their third match was also successfully won. As a result, GH\u2019s name was impressive in the standings after the first week.Meanwhile, LDF only had two matches arranged in the first week. GH temporarily surpassed a giant team and were full of momentary glory. Seeing the fans of the official Weibo soaring, the hard-working manager Luo Mo almost burst out crying tears of joy. \u201cIt\u2019s finally like the popularity of a professional team!\u201dLin Yan couldn\u2019t help glancing over. He didn\u2019t see to understand why his former assistant could feel so much joy and sadness after taking over the club. However, compared to the issue of the club\u2019s popularity, he was more concerned about the team\u2019s actual performance.The first week of the season had ended. Judging from the points, the situation of their team was pretty good indeed. However, the opponents encountered this time were too weak. Starting from the second week, the overall test would gradually become tougher. He didn\u2019t care much about the other teams. The main thing was the first match that followed.Their opponent was SUU. Putting aside the complex personal factors, it was difficult from the perspective of strength alone. In addition to Peng He, the current captain of SUU, there were the two newly introduced South Korean players who were very strong.If SUU was still getting used to each other in the mid-season then based on the just concluded first week of the autumn competition, this team had already turned into a sword with a sharp edge! Obviously they would be a tough opponent.Whoops forgot to upload this yesterday.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
