Who\u2019s talking?\u201dSurprised and bewildered, Su Ping quickly opened his eyes. He turned around to take a look. Just one glance almost scared him half to death!Leaning against his pillow was a ghost that was bleeding from all the seven openings of her face. A twisted smile was ripping her mouth open, revealing ghastly white teeth.\u201cWhat the f*ck!!\u201dTrembling, Su Ping gave the ghost a backhand slap.His hand went straight through the ghost\u2019s face and landed on the soft pillow. It was just like fanning the air!The ghost grinned a bit and stuck out her scarlet tongue.Su Ping was terrified. He hastened to turn around and flee. However, he didn\u2019t pay attention due to panic; his hand was misplaced and he fell off the bed face first on the ground.\u201cIt hurts!\u201dSu Ping felt his nose was broken and the pain caused a burning sensation.That being said, he then felt cold all over his body once he thought about the horrifying ghost again.\u201cUm, pff...\u201dIt seemed as if someone was trying to hold back but failed. There was a burst of laughter coming from the side.Su Ping shivered from fear. Was the ghost laughing?!\u201cHa, ha, ha... Su Ping, are you trying to kill me with laughter? How hopelessly spineless can you be, to be frightened like this!\u201dThe laughter came from the side of the room.Su Ping was startled.He turned around.At the foot of the bed stood a delicate and cute girl with bright eyes and white teeth, wearing orange pajamas with cartoon characters. She was pretty, but at the moment she was laughing so hard that the word beauty no longer had anything to do with her.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dSu Ping was confused. Then, he suddenly noticed there was something different about the environment of the room.The first thing that jumped out was a huge poster of a monster on the wall behind the girl. That had to be a poster from some movie.This was not his room!Su Ping never had the habit of putting up posters in his room.Where was the ghost girl?Upon remembering the shock she had given him when he woke up, he quickly turned his head to look.There was nothing on the bed. The ghost girl was gone!\u201cDid she leave?\u201dSu Ping was in a daze. He was just about to breathe in relief.And yet, all of a sudden, a black figure whooshed out from under his blanket. It was a black cat.It was more of a \u201crolling\u201d than a \u201cwhooshing\u201d out. The cat was so chubby that it was practically a ball.\u201cSnowball, come here,\u201d the girl said to the black cat.Hearing her voice, the black cat spared no effort in struggling with its four limbs to stand, finally turning around from its belly-up position. The cat shook its fur for a bit, threw a glance to Su Ping who was still cowering on the ground and walked toward the girl with graceful little steps.Maybe he was just imagining things, but Su Ping thought he was being despised by a cat.At that moment Su Ping suddenly noticed two sharp horns on the head of the black cat. There were a few strands of dark red hair on its forehead, forming something like a circle of flames.A question mark slowly emerged above Su Ping\u2019s head.Buzzing!Suddenly, as if space and time were quivering...Su Ping\u2019s vision blurred. Like flood currents, countless pieces of information were surging in his head from all sides.\u201cSu Ping? Su Lingyue?\u201d\u201cAstral Pets?\u201d\u201cAnother world?\u201dThe information that came in a continuous stream was confusing and overwhelming. Su Ping felt his head was about to explode, and the pain was unbearable. He had to clench his teeth to somewhat hold back the urge to utter a sound.He didn\u2019t know how long it took before the messy storm of information in his head gradually quieted down. Some clips of memory emerged in an orderly manner along the timeline.He had been transported to another world...Su Ping came to the realization. No wonder he was in this unfamiliar room with that strange girl and the odd cat.\u201cHowever, I was just curling up at home to sleep! How could I be transported to another world like this?\u201d\u201cWas it because I used my hand for some pre-sleep exercise?\u201dInside, Su Ping was smiling bitterly. He began to sort through the memories in his mind.\u201cThis is a world similar to earth. But the technology is more advanced, already having entered the era of interstellar travels, reaching far beyond the earth. At the same time, the focus here is not technological development, but the unique Astral Pets!\u201d\u201cAstral Pets come in great variety and have everything to do with human society. There are Tool Pets who are in charge of infrastructure, transportation and work in daily life, even in scientific research! Battle pets are responsible for pioneering new frontiers amongst the stars and they also offer support in wars. When it comes to battles and status classification of major countries, the might of the battle pets is the decisive factor!\u201d\u201cAstral Pets...\u201dSu Ping indulged himself in those memory clips. The more he knew, the more shocked he was. He then understood what that ghost girl was about.\u201cBattle pet of the demon family, the Phantom Flame Beast\u2019s main ability is to construct illusions and manipulate fire elements...\u201dThis Phantom Flame Beast was that strange cat, a ferocious and tough battle pet of the demon family. This was an Astral Pet that was proficient both in spirit control and element control, a \u201crare\u201d kind that could cost an arm and a leg!Su Ping couldn\u2019t believe that \u201chis\u201d younger sister Su Lingyue would use such a rare Astral Pet just to trick him every day...Once he finished browsing through the memories of his body\u2019s original owner, Su Ping found this life both funny and annoying. This brother and sister were such a quarrelsome pair; they mutually couldn\u2019t stand the sight of the other since young. At first, Su Ping was the one who often played pranks to bully and scare his younger sister. However, the tables had turned as they grew up. It was Su Ping\u2019s turn to spend his days on tenterhooks.The trigger for such a change was because they had entered different schools when they were twelve.One of them went to a common trade school.The other went to the Academy of Astral Pet Warriors!In a world that was centered on Astral Pets, not everyone could become an Astral Pet Warrior. Only the ones that were well-endowed at birth could build contracts with Astral Pets!It was determined at birth that the former \u201cSu Ping\u201d didn\u2019t have such talent, which meant that he was destined to be a normal person.But, in their childhood, this pair of brother and sister didn\u2019t understand this concept. Therefore, the talented Su Lingyue had always been the one on the receiving end, being constantly bullied by Su Ping who had no talent to train Astral Pets.Once they realized the difference between them, the disastrous life for Su Ping had finally begun.This younger sister of his was not one to be taken lightly. She harbored a bitter resentment due to all the times she had been bullied by her big brother. She had been repaying him that kindness by several folds over the years.At the present day, the gap between them had widened even more. One of them was a genius girl who was enrolled in a famous school, with a promising future ahead of her, while the other couldn\u2019t even get into an average university. He would have to drop out of school to help out the family in the business.\u201cWell, what are you doing there? You didn\u2019t damage your head with the fall, did you?\u201dSu Lingyue felt something was unusual as she stared at the dumbstruck Su Ping who was sitting on the ground. She frowned, since she remembered that he fell head first.She wasn\u2019t worried about Su Ping\u2019s safety, but their parents might blame her for this.\u201cEh?\u201dSu Ping came back to his senses. He threw a look at the proud girl who was there holding her head high with her arms folded in front of her chest. He didn\u2019t know what to do with her. \u201cDon\u2019t play pranks like this anymore,\u201d said Su Ping.Since he had taken over this body, he didn\u2019t want to continue with the practical-joke-revenge living arranged by his sister.Su Lingyue was taken aback.\u201cWouldn\u2019t he usually jump right up and give vent to a torrent of abuse to call me a shrew?\u201cWhy is he so quiet today?\u201cCould it be...\u201cHe thinks I could become soft-hearted just because he wants to submit?\u201cHmm!\u201d\u201cAs long as you haven\u2019t become dumb. Well, truth be told, maybe you can become smarter with your head smashed, given your poor intelligence.\u201d Su Lingyue sneered. She turned around and left right away. \u201cDon\u2019t dawdle. Hurry up and get down for breakfast. Don\u2019t make mom tell me to come up and get you again!\u201dSlam!She smashed the door behind her.Su Ping produced a forced smile. Why was his younger sister so violent when other people\u2019s sisters were cute and lovable girls?Whoosh!The door was pulled open again.Su Ping was startled. It was Su Lingyue who had returned. She hid her spooky face behind the door as she added, \u201cAlso, don\u2019t tell mom on me. Or else...\u201d Then she made a cutthroat gesture.Slam!The poor door had to shoulder another strike before Su Ping could give a reply.\u201c...\u201dSu Ping sat there for a while and crawled back up after he was sure no more sounds were coming from outside.He glanced around the room and saw many action figures and posters of Astral Pets. While he was a normal person in this world, he wasn\u2019t inferior to the average Astral Pet Warriors regarding the studies on Astral Pets.Of course, this didn\u2019t stem from his great love of Astral Pets. This bro hated Astral Pets. He was only delving in such studies to find a way to defeat Astral Pets as an average person!To be more accurate, to find a way to defeat his sister\u2019s Astral Pet!However, many years had passed; he was still on the receiving end of maltreatment and contempt without the ability to fight back. One could only imagine how difficult his life had been, for him to have researched this much.Su Ping had a surge of mixed feelings after he reviewed the 18-year life of this man. Not only was he a good-for-nothing, but he had also offended the only powerful person he could have latched himself to. He had been mischievous since he was a kid. He created so many troubles and fooled his sister many times. He would put caterpillars in her lunchbox or scare her in the dead of night by dressing up as a ghost. He was practically the cause of her childhood trauma.Look at the results. He had turned the girl whose coattails he could ride on into his foe. Besides, this sister of his was not a kind person. She had become his adulthood trauma for a change.Su Ping definitely had to find a chance to reconcile with this powerful sister. Otherwise, he would be traumatized or his nerves would be wrecked after a few more rounds of peculiar scares.Su Ping got himself ready, then he put on his slippers and headed downstairs.\u201cWhat took you so long? The congee is getting cold. Hurry up,\u201d his mother, Li Qingru, said. She seemed to be in her forties, gentle and refined.Su Lingyue had already dug in and remained by the table. She had placed the Phantom Flame Beast named \u201cSnowball\u201d on the chair next to hers, which was supposed to be his spot.Su Ping curled his lips. Even at a simple breakfast, he could still feel such a vindictive nature...\u201cComing.\u201dSu Ping went to the living room to get another chair. He took a look at the substantial breakfast with congee, meat pies, and soybean milk. He was getting hungry.Su Lingyue raised her eyebrows and cast a glance at Su Ping. She deliberately used Snowball to occupy his seat to provoke him, so that he would get angry and scream and yell. That way she would tell her mom to scold him. Why did he bear the insult?Curious.There was some alertness in Su Lingyue\u2019s looks. Was this guy up to something by acting out of character?\u201cMom, I\u2019m done. I\u2019ll be heading to the academy now.\u201d Since her plan had fallen through, Su Lingyue was no longer in the mood to stay. She finished her breakfast quickly and bid farewell to her mom.When she was about to leave, Li Qingru stopped her, \u201cXiao Yue, wait.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Su Lingyue turned around.\u201cRecently, your brother\u2019s store hasn\u2019t been performing very well, it\u2019s not quite popular. How about you put Snowball there just to put on the dog?\u201d Li Qingru tried to sound her out.Su Lingyue was surprised. She threw a glance at Su Ping who was swallowing down the congee. She rolled her eyes and grumpily reasoned with her, \u201cMom, the business has been worsening day by day since you let this guy take over. Why do you think that is? The reason is that this guy is not attending to his proper duties. Do you still remember when someone almost filed a complaint against us at the Association of Astral Pets?\u201cSomeone left a \u2018Messenger Bird\u2019 there for the boarding service. However, it started saying \u2018f*ck you dumb**s\u2019 to all the people it met, and it would blurt out all kinds of curse words, all in less than a week. A few days later, the bird was beaten to death and this case remained unresolved!\u201d\u201cDo you have the courage to have my Snowball be raised by him when he can\u2019t even take care of a Messenger Bird? There is hope that Snowball can advance to an Astral Pet of the eighth rank. If you don\u2019t mind, I won\u2019t, either. After all, you were the one that bought me Snowball.\u201dLi Qingru was rendered speechless. She opened her mouth but ended up sighing.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she had to rest quietly to recuperate since she was under the weather, she wouldn\u2019t have asked Su Ping to take over the store so early.Su Ping could sense his sister\u2019s unkind glare but decided to keep silent. He lowered his head and continued eating the congee without paying attention to Su Lingyue.\u201cHmm!\u201d she snorted, after sensing that Su Ping knew how to behave in a delicate situation. She picked up Snowball who was still eating bones and went back to her room to get changed and head out.A moment later, Su Ping had also finished his breakfast. As per usual, after Li Qingru told him to take care, he rode the bike to the store.It was an Astral Pets store.Su Ping was a dabbler trainer. His work was more related to Astral Pets\u2019 servicing than to actual training.After all, the real master trainers could change the potential and rank of an Astral Pet. The master trainers enjoyed similar, or even higher positions than Astral Pet Warriors!Along the way, Su Ping saw high buildings and large mansions, just like on earth. The only thing different was the peculiar-looking Astral Pets walking alongside most of the pedestrians.\u201cI am indeed in another world...\u201d Su Ping exclaimed. Everything was like a dream but it was every bit as real.Soon, he had arrived at his family\u2019s Astral Pet store.The store was at the end of a commercial street, a relatively remote location, but it used to be pretty popular. Su Ping\u2019s mother Li Qingru was an official Astral Pet trainer of the Federation. While she was only an elementary trainer, she was more than capable of opening a small store like this. She had loads of repeated customers.But things turned south quickly when Su Ping took over the store.Could anyone expect that a person who disliked Astral Pets would take good care of them?Crash~!Su Ping opened the roller shutter door. He could see dust stirring up in the air when sunshine reached the interior of the store.It seemed the store hadn\u2019t been cleaned in a long time. There was a pungent smell of animal urine and feces coming from the inside.Su Ping frowned and held his breath for a bit.All of a sudden, cold mechanic sounds emerged in Su Ping\u2019s mind.\u201cA suitable soul was detected within the target range. Performing contract detection...\u201d\u201cContract completed. Adding to the system...\u201d\u201cCompleted... Ready to launch...\u201d\u201cSystem?\u201dSu Ping paused for a second. Then, glow burst out from his eyes.What should come was coming...62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was not a stranger to systems. Pleasantly surprised, Su Ping began to probe the functions of this system immediately.\u201cI am the Super Pet System, dedicated to cultivating the strongest pets in the world, and the motto of this system is: everything can be cultivated, and everything is a pet!\u201d\u201cA pet cultivation system?!\u201d Su Ping exclaimed in surprise.The system sounded presumptuous. Everything was a pet. So, could flowers and the grass along the road be counted as pets as well?\u201cFlowers and grass can be pets as well, when they have intelligence and are spiritually awakened. Pets of the vegetation family evolved from common plants,\u201d the system gave an indifferent reply.Su Ping was taken aback. He glared at the air and asked, \u201cYou can hear my thoughts?\u201d\u201cI am connected with the host\u2019s soul. Of course, I am aware of my host\u2019s thoughts... Warning, first profanity alert!\u201d\u201c...\u201dSu Ping fell into silence.\u201cThe system has been activated. You, my host, must add a pet store that belongs to you within 24 hours. If the addition fails, the system will be removed and the memory of the day will be erased...\u201d The system added.\u201cThe system would be removed?\u201dSu Ping raised his eyebrows after hearing that reply. While a system wasn\u2019t all that uncommon, it was a system nonetheless.\u201cThere\u2019s a pet store right in front of me. Can I add this one?\u201d Su Ping asked telepathically.\u201cAuthorized. Please confirm.\u201dSu Ping confirmed right away.After all, this pet store was owned by his family. He could do whatever he wanted with it.\u201cAddition was successful. Adjusting the pet store...\u201d\u201c[Pet Trough] established, [Nursing Pen] established, [Window to Cultivation Plane] established...\u201d\u201cSet-up is finished. Initiating beginner\u2019s quest...\u201d\u201cTwo pets are detected in the store. Please select any one pet and enhance its strength by three-fold within a week to reach the standard deemed as \u2018qualified\u2019 by this system.\u201dAs the system finished its reports, promptly, Su Ping felt the Astral Pet store appeared to be different than before. The previous pungent smell of urine and animal feces was gone. At the same time, the store appeared to be tidier and cleaner. The items were the same as before but the outlook was completely new.\u201cEnhance the strength of an Astral Pet by three-fold? Within a week?\u201d Su Ping wondered if he had heard the system wrong. Or, maybe, the system was acting up.How hard was it to enhance the strength of an Astral Pet?Without hunting and training day in and day out, or consuming popular brands of precious food, it was impossible!It was incredibly hard to achieve progress by one fold, let alone three-fold in one try or the one week\u2019s time limit...\u201cWhat will happen if I fail in this quest?\u201d Su Ping asked.\u201cThe host must accept punishment for failure. The method of punishment will be drawn at random, including thunder punishment, purgatory punishment, extreme pain punishment...\u201d the system answered.Su Ping rolled his eyes. He could tell none of those forms of punishment were to be trifled with just by hearing the names.\u201cCan\u2019t I change to another quest?\u201d Su Ping was making his final struggle.\u201cNo.\u201d He was turned down ruthlessly. \u201cWarning. Second profanity alert!\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cThird profanity alert! Thunder punishment randomly chosen!\u201dHardly had the system\u2019s voice faded away when Su Ping felt a huge electric current running through his whole body. He was twitching like a zombie dancing Disco.The electric current disappeared as quickly as it came. Su Ping felt a burning pain all over his body. He wanted to hurl out verbal insults but he pushed the urge down. A wise man should know when to retreat.\u201cNever mind. I will try out the quest first. If I fail, then I have to say the system is a piece of garbage!\u201d Su Ping bit his teeth in hatred.He dragged his aching body to the pet room inside the store.As soon as he was inside, Su Ping noticed the place was more spacious. The main footprint was the same but the score of piled-up iron cages was gone. Taking their place were two rows of stone cages.It was more like a strange stone array than stone cages.Several stalagmites rose straight from the ground and surrounded the two Astral Pets. The gap between the stalagmites was big and there was no ceiling above them. The Astral Pets were virtually able to hop right out or squeeze through the gaps.However, the two Astral Pets were lying on the ground without the slightest intention of \u201cbailing out.\u201dSu Ping raised his eyebrows. This had to be something the system had conjured up. The [Pet Trough] the system mentioned must be this.He threw a look at the two pets in the stone array. Both were Battle Pets of the average type.One of the pets was a Lightning Rat, an inferior grade Battle Pet of the agile type. Even in adulthood, a Lightning Rat would only reach the intermediate position of the first rank. The probability of Lightning Rats evolving was quite low. Even when they did evolve into Thunderstorm Rats, they could only reach the third rank, which was as high as they could go.The other one was Managarm, also an inferior grade Battle Pet of the agile type. When grown-up, Managarms would be at the high position of the first rank, about as powerful as a Siberian tiger on earth.Su Ping faintly remembered that those two Astral Pets were left in the store\u2019s pet boarding service and were going to be picked up after a couple of days.\u201cI\u2019m going with the Lightning Rat.\u201dSu Ping considered his options and chose the weaker Lightning Rat. This way, the room for improvement would be larger.He heard the system\u2019s voice again, \u201cPet selected. Please choose a Cultivation Plane.\u201dAs soon as the system finished the sentence, a surreal ray of white light suddenly appeared in front of Su Ping and it tore apart space, forming a vertical crack that was in the shape of an eye. There was a destructive aura on the other side of the opening, able to twist anything it came into contact with.Su Ping was taken aback. Upon confirming that this thing wouldn\u2019t pose any danger to him, he asked the system. \u201cWhat is a Cultivation Plane?\u201d\u201cCultivation Planes are the main sites for the breeding and cultivation of pets. The host can choose a site suitable to the selected pet to cultivate it.\u201d\u201cCultivation sites?\u201dSu Ping dug through his memory for information on this regard. The cultivation of Astral Pets relied heavily on the sites. Therefore, many Astral Pet breeding stores would rent large areas to build up cultivation sites, also known as professional hunting grounds.The larger pet stores would have such facilities as well, but with more thorough services.For small pet stores like the one Su Ping was operating, they only had to feed their customers\u2019 pets and keep the place clean.\u201cDetecting pet. Lightning Rat. A pet of the thunder family. Match found for most suitable cultivation plane. Ancient Thunder Cloud Realm. Entering, yes or no?\u201dSu Ping felt baffled. \u201cYes... I guess.\u201dJust as he finished speaking, he suddenly felt this cultivation plane\u2019s name somewhat familiar.Astral Pets came from different backgrounds but most of them were from cracks in space, or maybe some were celestial bodies occupied by beasts and animals, while other Astral Pets were from ancient planets.The Thunder Cloud Realm seemed to be an ancient birth site of Astral Pets in the thunder family that was broken and long gone.It was said that there had been many top-level Astral Pets in the thunder family, such as the Thunder Dragon of Blue Sea, the Nine-headed Grand Thunder, and the Zephyr Beast, all of them were from the Thunder Cloud Realm. With the collapse and disappearance of the Thunder Cloud Realm, those top-level Astral Pets had become legends that could be rarely seen.Could it be that the place he was going to was an ancient site that was long lost?Before Su Ping had returned to his senses, he felt a strong force sucking him toward the crack with the surreal white light.The sky and earth were spinning around.Then, it turned pitch dark.When he regained his sight, he saw a blurry white mist and heard the rolling sounds of dull thunders.Su Ping was there in a daze for a moment before he felt shocked by the visuals in front of him!Was this a lost ancient site?He found himself in a vast area surrounded by giant trees. Clouds and fog were in the sky tens of meters away from the top of the trees. Lightning flashed amid the cloud and mist. Purple lights flickered as if dragons were there riding the clouds.The boundless starry sky could be seen through the thinner areas in the sea of clouds and mist. Giant planets, near and far, were visible to the naked eye, so close that the rings of planetary meteorites on their surfaces were clear and distinct.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Immediately, he noticed a line that indicated danger. Number of deaths?A bad hunch rose in his mind.All of a sudden, a huge shadow skimmed over his head. The day seemed to have become darker.Su Ping raised his head, and his pupils were instantly dilated by the sight.A pair of huge wings that could blot out the sky and cover the sun were stirring up the vast sea of clouds that seemed to stretch out to infinity. Lightning flashed and thunder roared among the dark purple wings; the countless clouds that were closest to them began to tumble over.\u201cWhat...\u201d\u201cWhat the hell is this?!!\u201dSu Ping was dumbstruck.Even a massive blue whale would be smaller than a feather of this giant beast!While he was still in shock, a strong gale swept through in a matter of seconds, swooping down from a high altitude and slashing at him like thousands of wind blades.\u201cRun...\u201dJust as this idea came to Su Ping\u2019s mind, he felt excruciating pain all over his body. His sight dimmed and darkness struck all of a sudden.\u201cAm I dead?\u201d Su Ping thought, with heavy-laden eyes. But light soon emerged as a flood. He opened his eyes; in front of him was still the vast and ancient scene and yet, the environment seemed to have changed. He was no longer surrounded by giant trees, but flourishing and tall blades of grass.He remembered the prompt message from the system. Su Ping came back to his senses. Was this the so-called unlimited number of deaths?He could die as many times as he wanted in that place?This idea brought him some relief. That being said, he felt the urge to let loose a torrent of abuse in the next second.While he wouldn\u2019t die for real, he wouldn\u2019t want to experience that pain when he thought he was going to be torn into pieces. It was too painful!\u201cSystem, I want to go home,\u201d Su Ping began to beg in an anguished tone.\u201cThe quest has not been accomplished. An early return is not allowed.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cWarning! First profanity alert!\u201d\u201c...!!\u201dSu Ping turned pale. He had to stay in this deserted world where giant beasts were running wild for three days? How many deaths would he have to endure?He was on the verge of a mental breakdown. What kind of system was this?\u201cRustle, rustle~!\u201dAbruptly, he heard a subtle sound.The sound made Su Ping\u2019s hair stand on end. He looked over in terror, only to realize that the sound came from the Lightning Rat by his feet. This little guy had followed him to that place and was shivering in fright at the moment.The little guy had also seen the giant beast that could cover up the entire sky and was surely scared to death.\u201cYou poor little thing. You\u2019ll have to die many deaths for three days along with me...\u201dSu Ping sighed in despair. Misery loves company.Maybe he felt close to the Lightning Rat because of the temporary contract. He felt sorry for the Lighting Rat after looking at the shivering animal. Su Ping crouched down to pat the rat to calm it down.As he was patting the Lightning Rat...It struck Su Ping that the goal of sending him there was to train this little guy.To train the little guy so that its strength could be improved by three times within one week.It was hard, for sure. But the focus in this quest should be the Lightning Rat!This horrifying cultivation site was prepared for the Lightning Rat!\u201cThe quest can be finished sooner if the Lightning Rat reaches the desired cultivation level. I can see that this is hard, but I\u2019ll never know if I don\u2019t push the limits, can I?\u201dAfter this thought, Su Ping turned his sight to the Lightning Rat that had gradually calmed down in his hand.The jittery Lightning Rat slowly quieted down after being stroked by the warm hand, as if it represented a safe harbor. However, right then, the Lightning Rat was sensing a strong surge of uneasiness in its heart.Following this hunch, the Lightning Rat looked over with its little rat eyes, only to see its temporary master glaring at itself with a pair of eyes that were shimmering with terror!The Lightning Rat: \u201c?\u201d\u201cCome on. You can do this.\u201d Su Ping grinned.The Lightning Rat felt chills.The Lightning Rat surely realized something because it began to struggle and wiggle in Su Ping\u2019s hand with great effort.While the Lightning Rat was an Astral Pet of the agile type, its strength was still greater than Su Ping\u2019s. In an instant, the Lightning Rat struggled itself free.\u201cCome back here!\u201d Su Ping cried out at once.But he shrank back as soon as the words were out of his mouth.This was the Thunder Cloud Realm where ferocious beasts were everywhere. To scream and yell like this was practically a request for death.Then, he remembered he had already built a temporary contract with the Lightning Rat. He concentrated and immediately noticed another faint presence of consciousness running alongside his own.The first consciousness was conveying vague traces of emotions and ideas.Fear, anxiety, shock, escape!Those were from the Lightning Rat.\u201cIs this the power that comes with a contract with an Astral Pet? No wonder I hear people say that an Astral Pet and its master can share the same mind. It can hardly be understood without personal experience....\u201dSu Ping\u2019s eyes flickered. The power that came with the contract was something he had long wished for years back, which came with the very standard that distinguished the common public and the Astral Pet Warriors.\u201cSqueak\u2014\u201dAll of a sudden, he heard shrill cries made by the Lighting Rat coming from the bushes in the distance.Scared, Su Ping ran over at once.He saw that the Lighting Rat was confronting a large insect near the root of a giant grass of about seven to eight meters in height. Its fur was bristled and it was showing its teeth.The large insect was about two meters long in a green color mixed with purple patterns. Some light produced by electricity would spring out from the purple patterns.This was also an Astral Pet from the thunder family!\u201cWhy does it look like a caterpillar?\u201d The appearance of the large insect reminded Su Ping of such an insect. Only the former was hundreds of times more ferocious than a caterpillar.\u201cSh*t, we\u2019re not going to be swallowed by this insect, are we?\u201d Su Ping\u2019s blood was frozen as he saw all the sharp teeth covering the insect\u2019s mouth. Death came instantly when he was torn apart by the fierce wind caused by the gargantuan beast that could cover up the sky. If he were to fall victim to this giant insect, he would have a taste of living was no better than dying!He even wanted to commit suicide at once.However, if he did, he would be reborn in another random location later.There was one more thing.There was nothing around him that could be used as a weapon.Su Ping looked around and only found a rock on the ground. He was filled with mixed emotions.Bashing himself to death?How much strength would he have to use to kill himself with one blow?If he couldn\u2019t do it, what could he do if he remained in a half-dead state?This question was lingering in Su Ping\u2019s mind like a sophisticated philosophy conundrum.\u201cSqueak!\u201dWhile Su Ping was still fantasizing about the most conveniently lethal angle to smash himself with the rock, he suddenly heard a shrill scream.He looked up.The Lighting Rat was about to lose its life. It had been grabbed by the giant insect. The giant insect had many feet, like a centipede. The sharp edges pierced through the Lightning Rat\u2019s soft belly. Blood was spilling out. The Lightning Rat passed away after only a bit of struggle.Su Ping looked pale. He couldn\u2019t bear to look at the scene and there were unexplainable feelings of anger.The system suddenly gave an alert. \u201cRevive pet on the spot. Yes or no?\u201dSu Ping was surprised.Seeing that the giant insect was about to stuff the Lightning Rat\u2019s body into its mouth, Su Ping shouted without further thinking, \u201cYes!\u201dBefore the sound of his voice had died away, the Lightning Rat that was about to be put into the insect\u2019s maw suddenly turned into sparkles that fell back to the ground in front of the insect and took the shape of the Lightning Rat again.Crack!The insect missed its bite.The insect was stunned, since its prey had suddenly come back to life.The insect: \u201c???\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t offer any explanation to the insect. Since the Lightning Rat had come back to life, Su Ping yelled out at once, \u201cAttack the insect!\u201dThanks to the emotional strength passed along through the contract, Su Ping\u2019s directions were delivered to the Lightning Rat immediately.The Lighting Rat was frozen on the spot because, in its mind, it was still seized by the terror of death. Su Ping\u2019s shout woke the Lightning Rat up. The obedience instinct that came from being domesticated emerged; the Lightning Rat rushed forward almost subconsciously.With the speed of lighting!Whoosh!The Lightning Rat sped up all of a sudden and smashed itself against the giant insect.Bang!Due to the impact, the giant bug leaned backward. Halfway through, the insect stopped the motion. The sharp edges of its many feet moved fast. The insect grabbed the Lightning Rat and tore it apart in a most appalling way.The Lightning Rat had died, again!\u201cRevive pet on the spot. Yes or no?\u201d\u201cDo it!\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t give it much thought. He issued another order to strike right when the Lightning Rat came back to life.Since the number of revivals was unlimited, Su Ping was convinced that they would kill this giant insect eventually. While the gap in abilities between the insect and the Lightning Rat was vast, there was still a possibility of winning for the latter. He had to be able to grasp the tiniest chance of victory!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Special SkillPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4: Special SkillTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsThe Lightning Rat was still in shock after being brought back to life. However, it soon regained consciousness that time. After a second of hesitation, the Lightning Rat dashed toward the huge insect as commanded.The huge insect was infuriated, since its prey had escaped twice from its mouth. When the Lightning Rat was about to arrive, the huge insect spat out a sort of white secretion that spread out like a spider\u2019s web, completely trapping the Lightning Rat.Once its prey had been captured, the huge insect wiggled over and tore the Lightning Rat apart with the sharp claws.\u201cRevive!\u201d\u201cAttack, again!\u201dSu Ping brought the Lightning Rat back to life immediately and told it to strike at once.In just a blink, the Lightning Rat had been brought back to life again and again and killed by the huge insect over and over. At the eighth time it rushed on to face the web spat out by the giant insect, the Lightning Rat flashed over and disappeared on the spot in an instant, only to re-emerge somewhere further apart.\u201cThunder Flash!\u201dSu Ping shivered from fear. Was the ghost laughing?!Was that one of the 10 special skills for Astral Pets of the thunder family, \u201cThunder Flash\u201d?Su Ping wondered if he was hallucinating.How could a Lighting Rat at the first rank comprehend a special skill of the thunder family that was so rare it was unimaginably precious?Su Ping was surprised and confused.Not even all of the advanced Astral Pets of the thunder family, such as those of the seventh or eighth rank, could master a top-level special skill of such rarity!Besides, this Lightning Rat was just average, even poor, so to speak. The Lightning Rat might not even be able to learn the middle-rank pet skills of the thunder family, not to mention comprehend the special skills!Su Ping kept his attention on the fight to observe.After the sudden rush, the Lightning Rat came close to a side of the huge insect in the twinkling of an eye. The Lightning Rat had found a perfect soft spot. Lightning was generated around its body as the Lightning Rat smashed into the soft flesh on the side of the huge insect.The huge insect fell to the ground immediately. There were some burns at its fleshy spot.However, the insect was not yet entirely incapacitated. Instead, stimulated by the sharp pain, the insect began to twist and turn violently. Soon, it crawled back up and launched a strike at the Lightning Rat at a faster speed.Having released all the energy, the Lightning Rat was tired so it was moving slowly. It died again after the huge insect\u2019s strike that trapped it.\u201cRevive,\u201d Su Ping said quickly.The Lightning Rat came into being on the ground again. It was no longer confused and puzzled as before, as if it had gotten used to this fresh start after withstanding a short period of pain.Faced with this traumatized insect, before Su Ping gave any orders, the Lightning Rat had dashed over to continue the unfinished battle.Attack, injury, death, and revival.After more than a dozen rounds, the huge insect finally fell, dying with anger and unwillingness because it could no longer defeat the never-dying Lightning Rat.In the latter rounds, Su Ping never saw the \u201cThunder Flash\u201d again; it seemed that such an attack was only a flash in the pan.He felt sorry and a bit disappointed. That being said, he knew that as long as what he saw was real, then the Lightning Rat could do it again in the future, since it had already succeeded once!Having taken care of the giant insect, Su Ping was able to catch a break. At the very least, he wouldn\u2019t have to be eaten up by the giant insect and experience that disgusting way of dying.\u201cNow I see that this place is dangerous indeed, but the training is productive.\u201dSu Ping took a look at the Lightning Rat sprawled on top of the giant insect, exhausted. After the little guy was brought back to life, its crafty movements were faster and more agile. The Lightning Rat even employed deceptive movements to sneak up on its opponent.The battle lasted only about 10 minutes, even though the Lightning Rat was lingering between life and death. It was incredible that the Lightning Rat could achieve such a stunning progress within such a short period.Perhaps, after three days, the Lightning Rat\u2019s strength could advance rapidly!Suddenly, Su Ping was filled with anticipation; finishing the quest was not entirely without hope.\u201cCome on, little guy.\u201d Su Ping patted the Lightning Rat on its little head. He stood up, ready to search for the next target.Tired!A feeling of reluctance came from the Lightning Rat.Su Ping was surprised.But recalling the arduous fight the Lightning Rat had put up to kill the giant insect, Su Ping felt he could empathize.\u201cTake some time to recover your strength first.\u201d Su Ping offered a kind smile.The Lightning Rat, who was still lying on the back of the giant insect, looked up with low spirits. It was suddenly seized by a strange feeling as it glanced at the smiling face that was moving in closer.Before the Lightning Rat could think, it felt a dull pain rushing in.\u201cRevive.\u201dLooking at the Lightning Rat that came into being again on the ground, Su Ping asked with a grin, \u201cHas your strength recovered yet?\u201dSu Ping had already noticed that every time after the Lightning Rat was brought back to life, it would return to its prime state without any signs of fatigue associated with excessive energy consumption from previous battles.Therefore, this was the best way to recover.The Lightning Rat\u2019s hair stood on end. This human smile was deeply engraved in its mind at this moment.\u201cHiss!\u201dThe Lightning Rat showed its teeth, as if warning Su Ping against such behavior.Su Ping put down the claw he harvested from that giant insect. The claw was indeed sharp. He was able to impale the Lightning Rat with just a bit of strength. The claw could be regarded as a handy weapon.\u201cThere, there. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Su Ping stroked the Lightning Rat\u2019s head.The Lightning Rat ground its teeth ferociously. If it weren\u2019t for the restrictions of the contract, the it would have bitten this master to death.......Three days later.A towering mountain in the Thunder Cloud Realm.Cloud and mist curled around the mountainside with steep hills and cliffs. The splendor and magnificence formed a landscape painting of the deserted land that was tranquil and beautiful.On an unassuming boulder, a couple of petty lives were engaged in a fierce battle of life and death!\u201cHurry. Use \u2018Thunder Shadow Image\u2019 to distract it.\u201d\u201cCircle around to its back from the side.\u201d\u201cUse \u2018Thunder Slash\u2019 to strike its side.\u201dSu Ping was standing by the boulder to communicate and give instructions telepathically.Two figures in front of him, one big, one small, were fighting an intense fight.The big one was a cockroach-shaped monster the size of an elephant. The quick and agile being was covered with a stone carapace in the color of lime and claws like sharp stone awls that grew out from its abdomen. This was a type of Astral Pet living in this land of boulders, and an earth family Astral Pet that was rarely seen in the Thunder Cloud Realm. For Astral Pets of the thunder family, those from the earth family were their arch enemies.The small figure was the size of a regular domestic cat with purplish hair and electric arcs around its body. Its hair had wild curls like sharp needles. This was the Lightning Rat.Buzzing!Lightning surged. All of a sudden, the Lightning Rat charged toward the stone cockroach monster.Out of instinct, the stone cockroach monster chased after the Lightning Rat.However, right at this moment, a lighter purple flash whooshed by and appeared behind the stone cockroach monster.Soon, the stone cockroach monster felt something was off. The Lightning Rat that was covered in electric arcs was running forward but that figure was getting fainter and fainter, until it was reduced to a half-transparent shadow formed by lightning.It was an afterimage!Abruptly, the stone cockroach monster sensed danger. It turned around quickly, only to see a ray of glaring purple light within its sight.The Lightning Rat jumped up high from the ground. Lightning was gathering in increasing density around it, gradually forming a sharp blade that had concentrated strength.Pff!The blade of lightning fell. The soft spot between the gaps of the side carapace of the stone cockroach monster could not withstand this cut. The stone cockroach monster was cut into two!Green blood spilled out onto the boulder.\u201cPerfect!\u201d Su Ping snapped his fingers.The Lightning Rat was able to kill this Astral Pet of the earth family that was a grade higher with only one life. The Lightning Rat was forging ahead by leaps and bounds, several times stronger than three days before.It was a fact.Just then, in his mind, he had received the prompt message from the system. The quest had been completed.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that we could do this within three short days...\u201dSu Ping exclaimed to himself. This was hardly imaginable.That being said, to achieve such an improvement, both the Lightning Rat and Su Ping had devoted considerable effort. They had experienced different ways of dying for over a hundred times and the Lightning Rat had even experienced over a thousand deaths.\u201cQuest accomplished. Cultivation Plane closing...\u201d\u201cDisconnecting host from the Thunder Cloud Realm...\u201d\u201cRemoving host and pet\u2019s temporary contract...\u201d\u201cPrepare for return...\u201dIn the next second, darkness fell into his eyes.When the light came back to his world, the familiar scenes of the pet store emerged before Su Ping, as if a lifetime had passed.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Collect now?\u201dSu Ping came back to his senses after the familiar sounds of the system\u2019s prompt tones. His eyes sparkled upon hearing the mention of rewards. \u201cCollect!\u201d he said without demur.\u201cThe host has gained elementary \u2018Pet Identification Spell\u2019.\u201d\u201cPet Identification Spell?\u201dSu Ping waited for a few more seconds but heard no more prompt messages. He glared at the air in despair.\u201cIs that it?\u201dHe exhausted himself in the three days of hellish torture and all he gained was a Pet Identification Spell book? And it was elementary?With the Federal Illustrated Book for All Pets, Su Ping deemed this reward of little value or interest; such a skill could not be more worthless.\u201cThe Pet Identification Spell issued by this system can help you gain insight into millions upon millions of types of Astral Pets. Your Illustrated Book for Pets cannot compare with this,\u201d the system gave a reply in a cold voice, clearly unsatisfied with Su Ping\u2019s complaint and resentment.Su Ping stood in amazement.To gain insight into millions upon millions of types of Astral Pets?In his memory, even the most authoritative and comprehensive Illustrated Book for Pets issued by the Federation only recorded information of a few millions of types of Astral Pets, including many Astral Pets that had gone extinct.Was it true that the goods generated by a system had to be the best of the best?Su Ping\u2019s feeling of resentment disappeared in no time. While this reward was not the immediate strength enhancement he expected, it was a precious skill nonetheless.Additionally, in the future, if he could go to another ancient site like the Thunder Cloud Realm, he would be able to identify those ancient Astral Pets with this skill. After all, most of those Astral Pets had disappeared from people\u2019s lives and there weren\u2019t many records of them in the Federal Illustrated Book.Su Ping was choked up with emotions after having obtained a new skill and he was eager to test it. He looked around and suddenly remembered the Lightning Rat.\u201cWhere is that little guy?\u201dSu Ping hurried to the pet room at the back. He saw that the Lightning Rat had fallen into a deep sleep in one of the ancient stalagmite arrays.The three days of hellish training had worn the Lightning Rat out. It fell into a sound sleep as soon as it returned to this familiar place.Compared with three days prior, not much had changed in the Lightning Rat\u2019s appearance. There were just a couple of more strains of dark purple hair mixed with the light purple strands and its body was leaner than before.However, the faintly discernible gloomy and violent aura of a beast that was spreading out from the Lightning Rat was making the Managarm in the other stalagmite array shiver in fear; it was obviously unsettled.Su Ping put his mind at ease after finding the Lightning Rat safe and sound. Although the contract had been ended and they could no longer exchange and communicate like before, he had become attached to this little guy after three days together.It was a pity that it was someone else\u2019s Astral Pet. He would have to return it someday.While Su Han was sighing, a prompt message suddenly popped out in his mind.\u201cEmploy Pet Identification Spell. Yes or no?\u201d\u201cIdentify this little guy?\u201dSu Ping took a pause and selected yes.Lighting RatProperty: Astral Pet of the thunder familyRank: Upper position of first gradeCombat Strength: 3.6Aptitudes: Below averageAbilities Mastered: Lightning Speed, Thunder Flash, Thunder Shadow Image, Thunder Slash, Thunder OuterwearSu Ping was surprised.Thunder Flash?He saw \u201cThunder Flash\u201d in the abilities mastered!Had the Lightning Rat learned this top-level special skill of the thunder family?Su Ping was stunned. He didn\u2019t see the Lightning Rat employing the \u201cThunder Flash\u201d for a second time in the battles later on. He had thought he was only having blurred visions. He didn\u2019t know that the Lighting Rat had indeed picked up this skill!How astonishing it was that a Lightning Rat of the lowest rank that could be spotted everywhere in the Federation had mastered the \u201cThunder Flash\u201d that not even an Astral Pet of the thunder family of the seventh or eighth grade could master easily! If he told people about this, they would think he had lost his mind!\u201cThis little guy... is many times more valuable!\u201dSu Ping calmed himself down, although his eyes were still glowing.A Lighting Rat that had mastered the \u201cThunder Flash\u201d special skill would be even hundreds of times more valuable than its peers!Not to mention the Lighting Rat had learned other skills.Apart from the Lightning Speed that was common among all Lightning Rats, both the \u201cThunder Slash\u201d and \u201cThunder Shadow Image\u201d were a must for advanced Astral Pets.It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to call a Lightning Rat a mythical creature when it was equipped with so many powerful skills.But there was something strange. In the column of aptitude, the Lightning Rat was rated \u201cbelow average.\u201d Why?Sensing the questions in Su Ping\u2019s mind, the system explained calmly, \u201cThe evaluation of its aptitude is based on the comparison of the data from all Lightning Rats born since the beginning of the endless chaos era to the present day. Host, you can trust the result.\u201d\u201cAll Lightning Rats...\u201dSu Ping became speechless because of astonishment.Even the number of Lightning Rats born in the Federation every year would be beyond calculation, not to mention if they were to start counting since the chaos era in the distant past.If so...This Lightning Rat could already be considered formidable with a below-average aptitude!......Su Yanjing looked up. She could already see the signage of that little pet store down the street\u2014Pixie Pet Store.In sharp contrast to the gaily shining sun, Su Yanjing\u2019s mood was cloudy and terrible.She didn\u2019t expect that she would fall on evil days. She had been forced to a tight corner at the preliminary contest of the Pet Tournament.This was an annual grand event of the academy. The students would display their strengths in this event. If someone could be favored by some Astral Pet masters during the tournament, they would be able to enjoy better tutoring and training. This could add brilliance in their resumes when the time came to join the Astral Pet Team!However, for three rounds in a row, all she met were strong opponents that were highly popular. The result was that several Battle Pets she took such meticulous care of had all been wounded and could no longer fight.Would she be stumped at the preliminary contest?That was unacceptable to her!She had already asked her family to spend a fortune to invite an advanced pet healer to cure one of the battle pets.That being said, one battle pet was not enough. That was her ace in the hole.She had to have a battle pet that could be the power forward and that could lure out her opponent\u2019s ace pet.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the academy prohibited any pets that were contracted within a month to enter the tournament, she would have bought some pets at the last minute, even though that would inflict a great burden on her mind and even cause severe problems.Anyways, she had no other battle pets available, except for the Lightning Rat she had left at the store\u2019s pet boarding service.A very common low-rank Lightning Rat.Nothing special about it.She even wanted to give it up because this Lightning Rat could no longer satisfy her requirements. Faced with the recent opponents, the Lightning Rat would be heading to its doom.Fortunately, she was softhearted and did not remove the contract directly. So, currently, this Lightning Rat was the only other battle pet that could enter the field.The Lightning Rat was weaker but she supposed it could be used to feel her opponents out.\u201cAnyone here?\u201dSu Yanying pushed the door open and entered the pet store. She threw a casual glance over the store. It was empty, as if the owner had moved.\u201cIs the store going out of business?\u201d Su Yanying though. Fortunately, she had come in time.\u201cYes?\u201dSu Ping heard the voice and left the pet room at once. He saw a pretty girl standing in the store, looking around.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was a customer, so he had to treat her nicely and politely.\u201cHi, I\u2019m here to pick up my Astral Pet.\u201d The store owner had come. Su Yanying turned her looks away from the empty store and said to Su Ping, \u201cThe Lightning Rat that I put here half a month ago. Is it doing okay?\u201d\u201cThe master of the Lightning Rat?\u201d Su Ping was surprised.The memories related to this matter were dug out.Su Ping remembered at once. There was a strange look on his face. He couldn\u2019t help but throw more glances at this girl.Was she the luckiest girl...Su Ping felt uncomfortable since the Lightning Rat had to be returned to its original master. Part of the reason was that he had become attached to the Lightning Rat and the other part was because he felt unwilling...After all, this was a super Lightning Rat that had mastered one of the 10 special skills!How could he just give it up like this?Well... he knew this little guy was someone else\u2019s in the first place.Su Ping felt dispirited by this and could only heave a few sighs. \u201cIt is totally fine, better than fine. Come with me and settle the bills first,\u201d he said, lifelessly.Su Yanying was at a loss. Why did this caretaker sound strange? Was he upset?She seemed to have an idea. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I came ahead of time but I will pay you the foster fee as we discussed. I will pay you in full.\u201d\u201cHmm...\u201d\u201c??\u201dSu Ping was not in the mood to talk to her. He took out the bill for the deposit. When he saw the digits, he felt another surge of heartache.He took a deep breath and tore the bill down slowly.He acted as if a piece of flesh had been cut off from him and his voice was laden with a deep feeling of grief. \u201cMinus the deposit you paid, you have to give another 108...\u201d His voice was shaking and he was almost choking!108...Only 108!!An Astral Pet that had learned one of the 10 special skills was going to be given away at an appallingly low price!\u201cWell...\u201dSu Yanying found that something was off about the owner but she could not put it in words. She settled the bill quickly. \u201cHere you go. Can you show me to my Astral Pet?\u201d She was dying to see the Lightning Rat, and to check if it was safe and sound.After all, some pet stores would make mistakes when they were feeding the pets which could lead to sickness. While those events were rare, she could not see such unfortunate incidents happening to her at this critical juncture.Su Ping heard the prompt tone of the money entering his account. His mouth twitched. Eventually, he stood up and turned around. \u201cWait here,\u201d he said.He left the counter and stepped into the pet room slowly.As he looked at the Lightning Rat that was napping in the stalagmite array, recalling the battles they fought side by side for the past three days, he felt reluctant to be parted with it.\u201cCome on. Time for you to go home.\u201d Su Ping sighed and picked up the Lightning Rat gently.The Lightning Rat was startled and woke up. When it saw it was Su Ping, the Lightning Rat relaxed gradually and closed its eyes, falling back to sleep.During the three days of desperate and cruel training, only when the Lightning Rat was with Su Ping could it feel secure enough to sleep.This was a force of habit and trust!Su Ping produced a forced smile. He took some deep breaths to calm himself down and then he stepped out of the pet room.\u201cMy Lightning Rat.\u201dSu Yanying\u2019s eyes glowed as she saw Su Ping coming out with the Lightning Rat in his arms.She knew this was her Lightning Rat the moment she saw it. While the Lightning Rat\u2019s appearance seemed to be slightly different from before, the bond shared by flesh and blood that came from the contract could not be wrong.However, she found something strange. When she first came into the pet store, she did not feel the presence of the Lightning Rat from their contract, as if something had blocked it.She had no time to ponder about it. She hurried forward and took over the Lightning Rat from Su Ping\u2019s hands.The Lightning Rat was startled again. The Lightning Rat\u2019s drowsy eyes glowed once it saw that it was Su Yanying. It threw itself into her arms happily and squeaked coquettishly nonstop.Su Ping stood by their side. The happy sounds made by the Lightning Rat gave him the strange urge to strangle it to death.\u201cThis punk... it only knows how to squeak coquettishly when its real master is here.\u201dThe Lightning Rat never did this with him.But Su Ping was well aware that the emotional bond sustained by the contract would exert a great influence on the Astral Pets. That was why the majority of the Astral Pets would never betray their masters; they would even sacrifice their lives for them!\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s go home.\u201dInside, Su Yanying was glad that the Lightning Rat was still intact and was just a bit skinnier.She had heard about how some unethical pet stores would cheat on pet food to make more money. She didn\u2019t want to look further into this.Just as long as the Lightning Rat was healthy. Otherwise, to cure its illness would take a long time.Su Yanying patted its head once she placed the Lightning Rat on the ground. She didn\u2019t even bother to look at Su Ping who was standing by her side. Inside, she had given a negative rate about this store. She would never come back again!The Lightning Rat began to bounce around Su Yanying happily once on the ground. It was over the moon, since it had not seen its master in ages.Su Yanying pushed the door open and left. Soon, the girl and the pet vanished from Su Ping\u2019s sight.Su Ping looked away as the Lightning Rat bounced about and disappeared. He heaved a sigh.Right then, the system suddenly sent a message\u2014\u201cDetecting money entering the account. [Shop] opened...\u201d\u201cBeep. Money has been converted into energy points.\u201dSu Ping was stunned. Before he could check, he heard another message.\u201cQuest: [Chaos Spirit Pool for Incubation] is ready. The host must breed a pet that belongs to himself within a week.\u201d\u201cReward for quest accomplished: a random skill book for battle pet warriors.\u201d\u201cPunishment for quest failed: downgrade the host\u2019s rate. When the rate is below the passing line, the host will be erased!\u201dA skill book for battle pet warriors?Su Ping was confused. He wasn\u2019t a battle pet warrior at all, and the force of the original core did not exist in his cells.\u201cThe host can purchase \u2018Awakening Potion\u2019 in the shop to be qualified as a battle pet warrior,\u201d the system alerted him.Su Ping was amazed. Then, he gasped. Awakening Potion?He was destined to be a common man from birth. Was it possible for him to change his life? Could he become a battle pet warrior?Something had to be spelled out.Innate skills were determined at birth!Only a tiny minority could be the exception, those who could awaken their abilities later in their lives, but there wasn\u2019t even one in a million!Of course, it was said that the state had developed some potions made from special plants found in space, and such potions could greatly increase the common people\u2019s chances of awakening.Still, such potions were priced at a level that only the rich could afford. Anyone without millions upon millions would not even get a chance!As for those vastly wealthy people, who would take the risk of becoming a battle pet warrior to struggle in the front lines at the frontier, apart from satisfying their curiosities for a moment?\u201cWhere is the shop?\u201dSu Ping could not wait to see this \u201cAwakening Potion.\u201d He was eager to acquire it. After all, whether in strength or survival abilities, there was a world of difference between battle pet warriors and the general public!A simple case in point would be Su Ping and his sister Su Lingyue.Ever since Su Lingyue joined the Academy for Astral Pets at the age of 12, Su Ping had never, not even once, gained the upper hand in close combat. He had always been defeated easily!Therefore, over the years, he had learned to use his brain instead of brawn, unless necessary....62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Three ServicesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7: Three ServicesTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations\u201cThe shop is in the host\u2019s sea of awareness. Think of it and it will appear,\u201d the system explained.Su Ping began to think about the shop.All of a sudden, a dark gray shop interface appeared in his mind, like the cabinet of a storage unit. Only three items could be found in there.\u201cAwakening Potion\u2014100 energy points.\u201d\u201cElementary beast catching ring\u2014100 energy points.\u201d\u201cLow-rank Astral Pet food\u201410 energy points.\u201dInformation on all three items came up at the same time.Su Ping did not hesitate to choose the \u201cAwakening Potion\u201d at once.\u201cPurchase failed. Insufficient energy,\u201d the system cautioned him.\u201cEnergy?\u201dSu Ping was surprised. Only then did he notice the purchase requirement that followed the item description.\u201cThe energy points are converted from the money made by the host. The exchange rate is 100:1. The current energy stored is, one point.\u201dSu Ping was dumbfounded. He suddenly remembered something. He browsed through his transaction history.-100!As he expected, his account had 100 points less; they had been transferred to an unknown, unfamiliar account.\u201cThis is to say, with 10,000, I can buy the Awakening Potion, right?\u201d Instead of feeling frustrated, Su Ping was excited.That was an utterly cheap price. After all, the Awakening Potion was something that could elevate a common person to an Astral Pet warrior in one go!If he had to buy it in the federal outposts, the price alone would be astronomical, let alone the complicated channels he had to go through. Besides, the effect might be inferior to this one!\u201cConvert all the remaining currency in my account into energy,\u201d Su Ping said at once.There were more than 20,000 in the balance of his account. Those had been transferred to him by his family for him to buy some Astral Pet offspring.\u201cCurrency unrelated to store activity cannot be converted,\u201d the system said.\u201cWhat?\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t understand. \u201cIs there a difference between the money made in the store and the one made in other places?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWarning! Profanity alert!\u201d\u201c...\u201d Su Ping took a deep breath. He clenched his fist, \u201cIf so, why can\u2019t you convert money that comes from other channels?\u201d\u201cThe currency conversion module is set up to test the host\u2019s own development ability. This ability will be included in the final evaluation of the host in the system,\u201d the system explained.\u201cWhat final evaluation?\u201d Su Ping raised his eyebrows.\u201cThe host doesn\u2019t have enough authority to know.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSu Ping pushed down a certain urge and gradually loosened his fist.He had to be humble while he was trapped in an inferior situation.\u201cLucky for me, to make 10,000 in the pet store is not a difficult task. I just need some time. If I can train a pet like the Lightning Rat and sell it, I can make more than a million, let alone 10,000!\u201d Su Ping said to himself.\u201cGiven the host\u2019s current limits of authority, you can only rent pets, not sell them.\u201d The system doused him with cold water in a very timely manner.Su Ping: \u201c??\u201dHe couldn\u2019t sell pets in a pet store?\u201cWarning! Second profanity alert!\u201d The system sounded cold.A painful memory surged in his mind. Su Ping quickly cut back the ideas that were swarming out endlessly on his mind.He took a deep breath in, and out.He had obtained the Zen spirit.\u201cEven if it\u2019s just renting, it\u2019s not difficult to make 10,000 every time I rent a pet as good as the Lightning Rat,\u201d Su Ping thought.\u201cAll the services provided by the store shall be priced reasonably. The host doesn\u2019t have the right to adjust the price,\u201d the system came out again.Su Ping was at a loss.He had a bad feeling. \u201cWhat are the prices like?\u201d\u201cCurrently, the store only has three kinds of services available: pet boarding, renting, and selling food.\u201d\u201cSince the host has not bought a nursing pen, the two existing nursing pens in the store are failed products, complimentary from the system. So, for each pet raised there, the price is 10 per hour.\u201d\u201cAs for pet renting services, the prices will be set according to the rank, ability, and aptitude of the pet to be rented out. Since the host has yet to breed any pets, the prices cannot be estimated at the moment.\u201d\u201cAs for the food, the host will have to go to the cultivation site to harvest food and the price will be set according to the quality of the food.\u201dSu Ping was dumbfounded.Only three services were available?That was to say, no other mechanisms or services related to pets could be made available, right?Things like the pets\u2019 apparel, toys, and other services such as hair trimming for pets were the real money-makers for a pet store... the main source of income!It had to be known that pets could do more than battles. In their daily lives, most of the time, pets would do some shopping with their masters, as well as dine or watch TV together. Most battle pet warriors were willing to take care of their pets thoroughly. After all, the pets were the only ones that could accompany their masters when it came to life and death struggles!\u201cIf I can only make money on pet boarding services, one hour is 10, then one nursing pen can generate 240 a day, two of the nursing pens will be 480 and I can make enough money in about a month...\u201dSu Ping did some math. The result was acceptable. One month would pass by easily.That being said, the charge for the nursing pen was higher than the market price and it was an hourly rate.Who would come out and put their pets in pet care for an hour?\u201cSystem, you just mentioned that the nursing pens were failed products and were complimentary. Are there other nursing pens that would charge even more?\u201d Su Ping asked in his mind.\u201cOf course there are,\u201d the system answered at once, \u201c10 energy points for one elementary nursing pen which has to be sustained by one point of energy per day. The host will have to pay for this.\u201d\u201cIt has to be sustained by my energy?\u201d Su Ping felt he had met a dark-minded merchant. \u201cThat is not effective permanently?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d the system replied, \u201cThe elementary nursing pens are made with spirit stones and the pets inside will be nurtured by pure anima that can improve the power of understanding and better the constitution of the pets. In that way, the pets can pick up powerful special skills more easily.\u201dSu Ping was stunned. Was that so?One had to know that other than using some special treasures, only advanced trainers could inspire the power of understanding in a pet.But according to the system, one nursing pen had such an effect. That was practically to say that the pet could be looked after by an advanced trainer at all times...\u201cWhat is the price for this kind of elementary nursing pen?\u201d Su Ping asked in a hurry.\u201cOne hundred per hour.\u201d the system replied.\u201c...\u201d Su Ping fell into silence.In the market, averagely speaking, pet boarding would be charged at around 100 for 10 days unless the master had special requirements for extra services. Other than that, the price was pretty much the same everywhere.Considering this, one hundred per hour would make 2400 per day.That would be 24,000 for 10 days!The price was 24 times as high as that of other pet stores!\u201cSystem,\u201d Su Ping said all of a sudden.\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cCan you make the price... even higher?\u201d\u201c...\u201dEventually, the system turned down Su Ping\u2019s request in a cold-blooded fashion. He felt rather disappointed.The price was high, even unimaginably queer. However, as far as Su Ping could tell, such elementary nursing pens could present such benefits that even a price 10 times as higher would be reasonable!\u201cBut, I cannot afford such an elementary nursing pen right now. Am I supposed to drag along by relying on the failed nursing pen?\u201d Su Ping found himself in a predicament.As for the food sales...He would have to harvest it from the cultivation site first.Su Ping couldn\u2019t help but feel his mouth twitch at the thought of the many deaths he experienced in three days in that cultivation site.Life was too hard...\u201cWait a minute. I\u2019ve gone missing for three days. My family must be worried about me.\u201d This idea suddenly came to his mind and startled him.\u201cThe host doesn\u2019t have to worry. The time flow in the cultivation site is different from here. Outside, only three hours have passed.\u201d The system sounded rather calm.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He immediately opened up the computer nearby to check the time. The date shown on the computer was indeed the day he arrived at the store.\u201cPhew...\u201d He breathed a sigh of relief.That was good.If he were gone missing for three days, his mom would lose her mind.Of course, when it came to that sister of his, she might feel differently...Su Ping shook his head. He focused his mind on the store. He remembered the pet incubation and breeding quest he had just collected. Promptly, he began to search the store.Soon, he found a pond like a dried-up well in the lounge at the back of the store.That probably was the \u201cChaos Spirit Pool for Incubation\u201d the system had just added in the pet store.\u201cAm I supposed to do it here? What should I start the incubation with?\u201dSu Ping was curious. All of a sudden, the image of hens laying eggs came to mind. His expressions changed a bit. His at ease stance gradually changed to attention...\u201cThe host is still within the beginner\u2019s protection month. Only 10 energy points are needed for one use of the \u2018Chaos Spirit Pool for Incubation\u2019,\u201d the system added.Su Ping was relieved.As long as he could use energy points for this... That being said, using energy was no joking matter, either.Ten energy points would be equal to 1000!\u201cLucky for me, when I finish the mission, I can get a skill book for battle pet warriors, which is to say, I can buy a skill book with 1000. That is worthwhile.\u201dUsually, a battle pet warrior had to master a skill to be enrolled into the Academy for Astral Pets. Such skills would have to take a long time, hard work and practice to master. That was not something that merely 1000 could buy.\u201cSystem, how can I make a quick buck?\u201d Su Ping asked the system in his mind.A moment later, the system gave a brief answer, \u201cThe host can earn energy quickly by selling food.\u201d\u201cSelling food?\u201d Naturally, Su Ping still remembered this service. In an instant, his hair stood up and he was covered with goosebumps. \u201cI need to harvest food at cultivation sites. This cultivation site would not be some place like the Thunder Cloud Realm, would it?\u201dHe didn\u2019t wish to harvest food in some places where he would be threatened by a growing crisis. He had had enough of a brush with death!He would probably not mind an instant death. What he was most afraid of was to be bitten to death, one bite after another, slowly. That would be the most horrifying way to go!The system answered, \u201cThe Thunder Cloud Realm is not the only cultivation site. It is just one among many, and it is an advanced one.\u201d\u201cGiven the remaining energy the host has left, there is not enough to pay for a round of teleportation to the Thunder Cloud Realm. Host, please select a cultivation site within the allowed price range to go to...\u201d\u201cBe aware. The more advanced the cultivation site is, the higher the possibility of harvesting precious food!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSu Ping sat up straight suddenly.\u201cPrice? Energy?\u201d\u201cWarning. Second profanity alert!\u201dSu Ping\u2019s facial expressions were twisted!He had to pay to go to a cultivation site?Was the system sure that it was a super pet system? Wasn\u2019t it a zillionaire system?!Su Ping felt too ashamed. He didn\u2019t want to go moments before. However, a second later, he was told that he couldn\u2019t, even if he wanted to!Besides, according to the system, he had lost a fortune!During the previous days for the training mission, he did nothing other than focus his mind on the Lightning Rat. He had squandered away a perfect chance to harvest food for three days in an advanced cultivation site of the Thunder Cloud Realm!If things were different, he would have returned with plenty of food for pets of the thunder family!\u201cSystem, I blame you...\u201d Su Ping sounded full of complaints.The system remained unaffected. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask. Additionally, as a qualified host, you should have learned to search for everything related to pets.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Su Ping clenched his teeth.\u201cThird profanity alert. Punishment drawn at random. Extreme pain experience...\u201d the system warned him.Su Ping opened his eyes wide. \u201cNo...!\u201d\u201cAh, ah, oh, oh, ah...\u201dA long moment later and after a fit of fierce shouts.Su Ping sat by the door of the pet store, listless. His looks indicated he had gone through vicissitudes.Bang.A coin was thrown to him.Su Ping looked up and saw a man smiling warmly at him. He was wearing a business suit and his hair was split in the middle. Then, he could only see the back of the man after he turned around gracefully.\u201c...\u201dSu Ping picked up that coin silently.He gazed at the coin, and gazed at it some more...\u201cSystem, can this money be converted into energy?\u201d Su Ping asked all of a sudden.The system: \u201c...\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dSu Ping made an \u201coh\u201d sound in a low voice. He slowly placed the coin in his pocket and stood up. He patted the dust off from his butt. Life was hard but it had to go on, right?He went back to the store and Su Ping read the words \u201cWindow to Cultivation Planes\u201d in his mind.Soon, a windowed chart showed up in front of him. Many location names were written inside, and following each location was a digit that indicated the energy required.Su Ping scrolled it down. He saw the word \u201cThunder Cloud Realm\u201d and the energy was 1000.One thousand energy points for one visit.Su Ping curled his lips. Soon, calmness was restored.He had become composed, Buddha-like.Su Ping kept scrolling the page down. He came to elementary cultivation planes. The energy required to enter such places varied from one to 10.\u201cWhat?\u201d All of a sudden, Su Ping saw a plane that was also named the \u201cThunder Cloud Realm,\u201d but it only required one energy point!Did he read it correctly?Su Ping checked more carefully. The number was correct. So, did the system make a mistake?\u201cThis system doesn\u2019t make any errors,\u201d the system\u2019s voice came in time, \u201cThis is a fragment of the plane called Thunder Cloud Realm. The fragment is a part broken off from the Thunder Cloud Realm, maybe land from the corners of the realm, or ruins where there are no animals or plants. To go to such places would be risky. The host must be prudent.\u201d\u201cFragment?\u201d It was until then that Su Ping finally noticed the word \u201cfragment\u201d written in extremely small sizes.He suddenly remembered what it said in the history books of the Federation. The Thunder Cloud Realm had broken up and vanished. Could it be that this fragment was from that incident?Then...The one he entered was a complete Thunder Cloud Realm?But it had fallen into pieces, why would there be an intact Thunder Cloud Realm?Su Ping had questions but he didn\u2019t obtain answers from the system. All of a sudden, he felt this system was unfathomably strong. He thought he\u2019d better not mess up with the system in the future.Su Ping browsed through the list and closed it. He did not choose to go in.He was worn out.Simply exhausted.He had died over a hundred times in three days when he was at the Thunder Cloud Realm. That meant more than a mere digit. During almost half of the deaths, he was slowly tortured to the end of his life in the most excruciating way.Although every time after he was brought back to life, his strength would be recovered. That fatigue in spirit was becoming increasingly overwhelming. That is why the Lighting Rat fell so deeply asleep as soon as they came back.Su Ping closed the roller shutter door. The store dimmed down. Promptly, he lay on the desk and slept soundly.......Su Yanying had returned to the academy.The large campus had large lawn areas. The green ratio was quite high. In the middle of a plaza in the distance, there were ponds and waterfalls so that some student\u2019s pets of the water family could enjoy themselves there.But, at the moment, the pond was deadly tranquil. There wasn\u2019t a single pet there.In a campus as large as an airport, there were foul souls scurrying about.It was dead silent everywhere.Su Yanying did not find this strange. Naturally, she knew where everyone had gone.There was a huge stadium-like venue at the end of the plaza.At the moment, the sounds of people cheering were coming out of this place. Even people standing at the gate of the academy could faintly hear that sound.The afternoon match was still ongoing!\u201cHurry up!\u201d Su Yanying said to the Lighting Rat that was following her. Then, she sped up and pressed forward.She had wasted too much time on her trip to the pet store. Luckily, her match was scheduled for later in the afternoon. It would start at around four.That being said, if the competitors in the matches before hers were to fail too quickly, her match would be moved up.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsSoon, Su Yanjing arrived at the Astral Pet combat stadium.Su Yanying did not wear the academy uniform but the guard recognized her. He let her in before she presented her student card.\u201cPyro Cut!\u201d\u201cThe Pyro Canine has used the Pyro Cut!\u201d\u201cSuch a shame that the Pyro Cut did not hit its target. The Fire Warmonster dodged the strike. Wait a minute. No! The Pyro Cut is turning around. Good heavens, the Pyro Cut is traveling back!!\u201dSu Yanying heard the judge shouting in excitement as soon as she stepped into the stadium. His voice could be heard throughout the entire venue; it was loud enough to wake the dead.At the same time, people were thrilled and shouting on the spectator seats on the sides of the entrance corridor.This was of no surprise to Su Yanjing who kept her calm. Such a view couldn\u2019t be more familiar to her.She looked around and found the seats of her class.Class Two, Grade Three.She hurried over. Halfway through, she suddenly remembered that her pet Lightning Rat was still behind her...That little guy... she had never brought it to such a grand event. Would it be scared by this magnificent scene with tens of thousands of people shouting their lungs out?Su Yanjing turned around at once, only to find the Lightning Rat was still close behind her. When she stopped, it stopped as well and the Lightning Rat raised its head to look at her. She could see confusion in those small eyes that were only as big as a crack.It was unaffected... Inside, Su Yanying felt she could breathe again. Pets weren\u2019t like the average wild animals. Pets had basic thinking and awareness abilities. A pet that was more timid would most likely be immobilized from fright in situations like this.Time was pressing. She had just picked up the Lightning Rat. She didn\u2019t have time to train with it or give it some time to adjust.Su Yanying was gladly surprised to see that the Lightning Rat was courageous and fearless.\u201cYing Ying, where have you been? I couldn\u2019t find you anywhere. You frightened me there!\u201dLan Lele, Su Yanying\u2019s friend, had spotted her as soon as she arrived at her class\u2019 seats. The former ran over at once.\u201cI went to pick up my Astral Pet,\u201d Su Yanying said as she followed Lan Lele to the seats of their class. Su Yanying threw a glance at the games and asked, \u201cWhich one is it now?\u201d\u201cThe fourth one. You\u2019re almost up, just after Ice Jiang finishes her match.\u201d Lan Lele pouted her lips to point at the back of someone with black hair in front of them. Both that person and Su Yanying were the center of attention in the class. Over time, due to the influence of such an environment, those two students had grown to be quite competitive.Since Lan Lele was Su Yanying\u2019s friend, she naturally didn\u2019t have nice feelings about that student.\u201cOh.\u201d Su Yanying nodded. She didn\u2019t mind this and kept her gaze on the matches.Then, Lan Lele noticed the Lightning Rat that was eating the fruit peels on the ground near Su Yanying\u2019s food. \u201cThis is the Lightning Rat that you sent out for pet boarding, right? Is it starving? Why is it eating anything it can find?\u201d Lan Lele sounded surprised.Hearing her words, Su Yanying turned around. Her expression changed as she saw the Lighting Rat that was holding a piece of fruit peel, eating happily.\u201cDrop it. It\u2019s too dirty,\u201d said Su Yanying while she used the power of the contract to send across her instructions at the same time.As a person with a morbid fear of getting dirty, she could never tolerate seeing her pets eating garbage on the ground.In the meantime, this reminded her of that pet store!\u201cThat vicious businessman!\u201dWhen the matches were over, she would go to the Association of Astral Pets to file a complaint against that store!Sensing Su Yanying\u2019s orders, the Lightning Rat stopped, blinking its googly eyes.Lan Lele took a look at the Lightning Rat. Something came to her mind. \u201cAre you going to have it join you in this match?\u201d She looked at Su Yanying, stunned.\u201cOf course.\u201d Su Yanying remained composed.Lan Lele opened her beautiful eyes wide. \u201cHave you lost your mind? This is the annual Pet Tournament. The pets that can join in the matches should be at the second rank or higher. Aren\u2019t you sending the Lightning Rat to its death by taking it with you?\u201d\u201cThe academy has rules that no casualties are allowed in the matches. The judge will call it off in time in case of potential danger,\u201d Su Yanying replied.\u201cEven so, say the Lightning Rat doesn\u2019t lose its life, but what would be the benefit of sending it in? This is just a pet at the intermediate stage of the first rank. Any pet out there can defeat it.\u201d Lan Lele was baffled.\u201cI know.\u201d Su Yanying was determined and resolute. \u201cBut, don\u2019t forget about the battle pet warrior special skill I mastered, third-rank strength augmentation!\u201d\u201cThe lower the rank of the pet, the better the effect of my strength augmentation will be. I should be able to boost the strength of the Lightning Rat to the intermediate stage of the second rank. With my skills and instructions, the Lightning Rat can fight other pets!\u201dLan Lele, naturally knew about the capabilities of this friend of hers to a tee. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you asked your family to get you an advanced healer to help you recover the strength of that \u2018Fanged Tiger\u2019? Why don\u2019t you work with it instead?\u201d said Lan Lele, still puzzled.\u201cEveryone else believes it was injured during the previous battles. It is my ace card now. I cannot expose it so quickly.\u201d Su Yanying lowered her voice.Lan Lele finally understood. She heaved a sigh. \u201cSpeaking of which, you are so unlucky this time. You\u2019ve met too many difficult opponents at the beginning of this tournament. Otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be in such a predicament.\u201dSu Yanying kept silent. She didn\u2019t offer a reply.At the same time, this round of matches had just ended. The one that was using the Pyro Canine won. Both parties went off the stage.In the meantime, the girl that was called \u201cIce Jiang\u201d by Lan Lele stood up slowly. She was immediately on the receiving end of the passionate stares from the boys of their class, as well as some glares from some that were gnashing teeth in hatred.\u201cThat girl sure is lucky. All her opponents are rookies!\u201d Lan Lele said, resentfully.Su Yanying frowned a bit. Still, she kept silent.A few minutes later, the battle on the stage had finished. The girl that looked as cold as ice stepped off the stage slowly.Su Yanying felt when that girl threw her a glance.That glance spoke volumes, as if Ice Jiang was telling Su Yanying to not to let her down...Hmm!Su Yanying clenched her fist. She looked even calmer on the outside.\u201cTime to go,\u201d Su Yanying said this to Lan Lele and the Lightning Rat with her.The Lightning Rat noticed that its master\u2019s mindset seemed to have been altered. The Lighting Rat stood up straight and a keen look flashed in that pair of small eyes.And yet, nobody would throw a look at the eyes of an inferior Lighting Rat. Not a single person noticed that dangerous aura hidden within.Along the aisle, Su Yanying walked to the stage in the middle of the venue. She made her way up, step by step.The Lightning Rat jumped and hopped behind her.She stood quietly in the spacious stadium, amid the looks thrown at her from all sides.There was no trace of fear on this girl\u2019s face. In her eyes, there was pride and composure.\u201cSu Yanying from Class Two, Grade Three!\u201dThe judge announced her name at once and continued in a thrilled tone, \u201cNow, let\u2019s shift our attention to the screen and find out who will be Su Yanying\u2019s opponent!\u201dEveryone shifted their looks to the huge score screen hung above the ground. A string of images flashed past and then stopped in one.\u201cSh*t!\u201d Lan Lele\u2019s expression changed the moment she saw the image. It was Zhang Xiao from Class Seven, Grade Three. That was quite a formidable opponent. Zhang Xiao could be counted as one of the best in the class!Su Yanying was surprised as well.How bad her luck was. How come she had to compete against another tough opponent?Soon, her opponent was also up on the stage.That was a young man of about one meter and seventy-five in height, with black hair and a fierce glance, wearing a valuable wristwatch. This was a rare mix of a wild and refined young man.\u201cSu Yanying from Class two?\u201d Zhang Xiao could not help but chuckle as he saw his opponent. \u201cI must be in luck. I heard that all your pets have been injured during the previous battles. Tsk, tsk. Is the little rat there all that you\u2019ve got now?\u201dSu Yanying\u2019s face was clouded and her heart was weighed down.COMMENTBy the stage, the judge announced the commencement coldly, \u201cBest two out of three. Each party can only send in three pets to participate. No malicious wounding is allowed. Now, begin!\u201dZhang Xiao smiled. He reached out his hand and made a grasping gesture to mobilize the contract power. All of a sudden, the space in front of him began to twist slightly. Right after that, a figure that was burning in black flames landed on the ground.\u201cSecond rank, power of the blast!\u201d A faint white glow emitted from Zhang Xiao spanned around like a vortex on the four limbs of that figure surrounded by black flames. This skill was the most basic augmenting skill that a battle pet warrior should master.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations\u201cThat is the Dragon Hound!\u201d\u201cThis is such a surprise. Zhang Xiao from Class Seven, Grade Three, has sent out Dragon Hound, a pet of the demon family that is incredibly hard to tame, right at the beginning of the match!\u201d\u201cThis is a pet that can reach the upper position of the third rank in adolescence. Now, Zhang Xiao is using it at the very beginning. Is Zhang Xiao trying to win the game with a 3:0 score?\u201dThe commentator sounded surprised to see the pet that Zhang Xiao summoned from his contract space. It was somewhat mean to fight an inferior Lightning Rat with such a powerful battle pet.\u201cDragon Hound!\u201dSu Yanying was taken aback. Not only was the Dragon Hound violent and cruel, but it was also said that Dragon Hounds shared bloodlines with the \u201cHell Dragon,\u201d a king beast. The Dragon Hound could release \u201cRoar of Flames\u201d which could carry the powers of dragon\u2019s howls; such skill could overwhelm pets of an inferior rank. The latter would be scared half dead before they even began to fight the Dragon Hound!Was he trying to disgrace her by deliberately threatening her when he was well aware that she was using the Lightning Rat?Su Yanying clenched her hands. She took a deep breath. So be it. She sent out the Lightning Rat just to feel out her opponent and to probe for his ace card.The fact that her opponent was underestimating her meant that the Lightning Rat had half succeeded in its mission!\u201cRoar!!\u201dThe cries of dragons suddenly came out.The Dragon Hound that was nearly three meters tall, bigger than tigers and lions, let out an abrupt bellow, carrying a strong deterrent force. The roar lingered on in the entire venue!Su Yanying\u2019s pupils contracted a bit. She felt that her heart was uncontrollably pounding fast. Not only could the roar of a Dragon Hound deter low-rank pets, it could also intimidate the more timid battle pet warriors.After all, its enormous body with magical flames surging around could give out a strong visual pressure!But Su Yanying was not a coward. Plus, she had confronted more powerful pets in her daily training, so she could deal with this pressure. She was ready to tell Lightning Rat to come back and send out her ace card, the \u201cFanged Tiger.\u201d All of a sudden, some electric arcs were generated with a \u201cbuzzing\u201d sound!The purple light produced by electricity appeared in her sight.Su Yanying was astonished.She lowered her head. The Lightning Rat that was by her foot had jumped to the center of the stage before she knew it. That small body stood in front of her, surrounded by electric arcs, as if wearing a suit made of lightning.That little guy did not show any intention of escaping, even though it was facing the Dragon Hound. The Lightning Rat would have to hold its head up high just to look at it!\u201cIt... is not afraid?\u201d Su Yanying was startled.The low-rank Lightning Rat was born to be a kind of pet that was more timid in nature. At the moment, such a pet was standing in front of her, showing its teeth at the Dragon Hound!It was as if the Lightning Rat was defending something, protecting something!\u201cCome back!\u201dTwo seconds later, Su Yanying suddenly came back to her senses. She shouted to the Lightning Rat at once.\u201cYes?\u201dWhen Zhang Xiao he frowned when he saw that thing enveloped by electricity standing in front of the Dragon Hound. How come that little thing was not paralyzed from fright? His original plan was to bring shame to Su Yanying. It was a surprise that this little thing sabotaged his intentions.\u201cKill it!\u201d Zhang Xiao gave the instructions telepathically.\u201cRoar!!\u201dFerocity was in the eyes of the Dragon Hound. Another sound was squeezed out from its mouth that was filled with horrifying fangs. The Dragon Hound felt its authority challenged since this little guy was not scared.Flames were rolling around the Dragon Hound who had opened its mouth and it breathed out dragon flames. Those dark magical flames fluttered out like pythons. The flames swept across the stage, reaching the Lightning Rat in an instant.Whoosh!The Lightning Rat was enveloped by the passing of the magical flames.Immediately, Su Yanying turned ghastly pale.\u201cHmm.\u201d Zhang Xiao snorted.Right at that moment, he noticed a faint purple glow from the corner of his eyes.Surprised, he turned around, only to see a figure surrounded by lightning rushing toward them at an incredible speed!It was traveling too fast!All Zhang Xiao could see was a ball of lightning charging at him!The Dragon Hound seemed to have sensed the danger. It turned around at once and breathed out a ball of magical flames.Whoosh!The ball of lightning made a turn rapidly and dodged the strike.Then, another ball of magical flames was discharged.Whoosh!The Lightning Rat jumped up again and slipped away!At that moment, people could finally have the visual. The thing in the ball of lightning was that low-rank Lightning Rat that should have been consumed by the dragon fire!\u201cHow is that possible!\u201dSomeone cried out in alarm.\u201cThat\u2019s the Lightning Rat!\u201d The moment the commentator saw it clearly, he found himself dumbstruck.\u201cOh no. Use the flames to tear it apart!\u201d Zhang Xiao shouted at one as he came back to his senses.Having received the instructions from its master, the Dragon Hound showed its teeth. Flames with magical powers were attached to its body. The Dragon Hound\u2019s four limbs exerted great strength. Being facilitated by the second-rank power of the blast, the Dragon Hound\u2019s speed was accelerated. In an instant, the Dragon Hound had charged at the Lightning Rat that was dashing towards it!Roar!The Dragon Hound\u2019s white, sharp fangs were enough to instill fear. Those fangs could crack stones. It opened its mouth, ready to take a bite at the Lightning Rat.The Lightning Rat did not flinch. A cold glare was bursting from its squinting rodent eyes. The lightning around its body quickly converged above its head.The moment the Dragon Hound was about to lacerate the Lightning Rat, the lightning convergence was quickly coming to an end, taking the shape of a sharp sword from the compressed energy!In the spectator seat, someone stood up. \u201cThunder Slash!!\u201dBuzzing, buzzing!Lightning flashed and a gale was whooshing. That sword of lightning was hacked at the mouth filled with teeth that was about to swallow the Lightning Rat!Crack!It was as if the lightning were exploding. With the loud sound, the entire venue began to shake. That glaring lightning stung the eyes, just like the core of a planet that had blasted away!When the lightning disappeared, the glaringly white light faded away from people\u2019s sights as well. Soon, everyone could see the stage again. For a moment, people were gasping in astonishment one after another.In the large stage, at a corner, that huge Dragon Hound had fallen and it was twitching. Smoke was rising from its burnt body. Right next to it, was Zhang Xiao who had collapsed on the ground in fright; his face had turned pale.Next to the Dragon Hound was a small guy that was still covered in lightning. It was stepping back to where it came from.It was that Lightning Rat that caught no attention!A short period of silence later, there was a burst of passionate cheers at the venue.The battle was marvelous!Who could have expected that a Dragon Hound of the demon family could have lost and to a common Lightning Rat no less!But, as of this moment, nobody believed that this Lightning Rat was anything common.Su Yanying felt she was a bit absent-minded while she looked at the Lightning Rat that was coming back to her. Did she win? Did the first rank Lightning Rat defeat the Dragon Hound?As a student of the academy of Astral Pet, she felt all her accumulated knowledge had been disrupted.......\u201cGuys, did you see that?\u201dOn a row of seats by the stage, some people that appeared to be powerful were sitting there. The vice-president of the academy was at the end of this row.Sitting in the middle of the row, a woman with red hair said, \u201cYes, that has to be \u2018Thunder Slash!\u201d She was dressed in strange armor, and there was a long, slanting brown scar on her delicate and beautiful cheek, which was a frightening sight, but the eyes of those around her were still demonstrating their admiration of her.\u201cThat is a seventh-rank skill of the thunder family. Well, well, if I hadn\u2019t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. It is such a surprise that this little Lightning Rat could learn a skill that not even the advanced pets can master.\u201d On her side, someone with a strong figure chuckled.\u201cThat is such an admirable talent. If this little guy can evolve to a third-rank Thunderstorm Rat, I believe it can be a match for other pets at the fourth or fifth rank!\u201d\u201cIt is a pity that this is just a Lightning Rat of low rank. The effect of it using such an advanced skill of the thunder family is still limited. If it were other pets with more potential, then its value would be beyond imagination. Maybe even I would be interested in such a pet.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is such a shame.\u201dThe others nodded as well, feeling sorry for such a fact.This low-rank pet must have a strong comprehending power, to be able to master such a complicated and sophisticated advanced skill.However, it was such a waste that such comprehending power was found in a mere Lightning Rat!The Lightning Rat\u2019s descent was of a low kind. Even if it could evolve to a Thunderstorm Rat, it would only reach the third rank. The ceiling was not high enough. Even an incredible comprehending power would be of no use in such a case....On the stage, the first round of this game had come to an end.Su Yanying held the Lightning Rat that had thrown itself into her arms. She still found all this surreal. She would have never expected that she could win this first round of an otherwise fierce battle so easily. She had won without contributing at all, neither as the master of the Lightning Rat nor as a battle pet warrior.A Lightning Rat helped her win in a breeze!At this thought, her expression became twisted. She didn\u2019t know if she could smile or cry about it.On the other side of the stage, Zhang Xiao had just come around. His face was as white as a sheet when he looked at the seriously wounded Dragon Hound that was lying nearby, seemingly at the last gasp.He clenched his teeth as he used the contract power to make the Dragon Hound withdraw to the contract space. Then, he turned around to glare at Su Yanying coldly.He had underestimated his enemy!He felt vexed. He should have known better. There had to be a reason why his opponent would send out a Lightning Rat in a pet tournament that had the focus of the world\u2019s attention over it.He didn\u2019t know that this Lightning Rat was such a rare kind.He had never heard of a Lightning Rat that could learn the pet skill of the seventh rank, \u201cThunder Slash\u201d.But, that was it!His original plan was to win all three rounds and enjoy a glamourous victory but that was not possible anymore. As such, he had to put into full play his ability as a battle pet warrior. He couldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice!\u201cStone Rhino!\u201dAgain, Zhang Xiao mobilized his contract power. In front of him glowed a faint yellow light. Then, the stage under his feet trembled slightly. A pet in the shape of a rhino that was even larger than the Dragon Hound came out.This Stone Rhino was covered with hard rocks. Besides, there were sharp edges like fish bones along its spine. Few pets could defeat the Stone Rhino in a face-to-face combat!\u201cThat is a pet of the earth family!\u201dSu Yanying immediately noticed the type of pet. Her expression changed.At the same time, the Lightning Rat that was in her arms seemed to have picked up some signals. All of a sudden, the Lightning Rat moved and struggled away from her hug. Then, it turned around and stood in front of her. The Lightning Rat put on a fierce look and thick lightning was surging all over its body!\u201cLightning Rat...\u201d Su Yanying was dumbstruck.Whoosh!Instantly, the Lightning Rat dashed out. It was charging toward the Stone Rhino proactively!The audience gasped on their seats.Even the judge and the commentator were taken aback. At the same time, they found this confusing. As the master of the Lightning Rat, didn\u2019t she know that pets of the earth family were arch-enemies of those of the thunder family? Why would she send out the Lightning Rat again?\u201cHmm, courting death!\u201dZhang Xiao sneered. \u201cSmash it into pieces. Kill it!\u201dAs he was giving the instructions, a starry glow appeared around him. With rapid speed, he released several astral skills with augmentation effects. \u201cSecond-rank strength augmentation, second-rank power of the blast, third-rank firmness augmentation...\u201d Of those, the third one in particular, was the one he was adept at.The reason for him to practice this \u201cfirmness augmentation\u201d so diligently was so that he could cooperate with his Stone Rhino.The Stone Rhino was strong and tough to begin with. If this quality was improved with \u201cfirmness augmentation,\u201d not even his Dragon Hound could leave a mark on the Stone Rhino, not to mention the Lightning Rat!Several of the halos that indicated those augmentation effects flashed by under the Stone Rhino\u2019s feet. Then, those halos transformed into energy runes, circling the Stone Rhino and then immersing into its body. Although this process took little time, it did stir up exclamations in the venue.The fact that he could cast three astral skills in a row so quickly and proficiently indicated that his ability had already surpassed that of many students present!Moo!The Stone Rhino let out a bellow in a low voice; then it exerted strength and pressed toward the Lightning Rat.Across the Stone Rhino, Su Yanying was alerted once she saw Zhang Xiao casting those skills. She was about to add some to the Lightning Rat as well, but to her surprise, she noticed that the Lighting Rat had gone beyond the sphere of her energy transference.Buzzing, buzzing!The light generated by electricity came out again. The Lightning Rat was running toward the Stone Rhino.The moment the two of them smashed into each other, the Lightning Rat was divided into two!Whoosh!Whoosh!Two Lightning Rats ran past the Stone Rhino from both of its sides. At first look, people might think that the Lightning Rat was smashed into two different ones by the Stone Rhino!\u201cThunder Shadow Illusion!\u201dAt the leader\u2019s seat close to the stage, the ones that were enjoying the games with a casual attitude suddenly opened their eyes wide.\u201cHow is that even possible!\u201d That red-haired lady kept her red lips ajar. Disbelief was written all over her face.She could accept the presence of the seventh rank \u201cThunder Slash\u201d skill. Why could the pet use the \u201cThunder Shadow Illusion\u201d of the same rank?!A low-rank Lightning Rat had learned two advanced pet skills??She wasn\u2019t the only one in disbelief. The ones next to her were stunned as well.It was understandable if the Lightning Rat could learn one of such skills. After all, while coincidences didn\u2019t always happen, chances were they were going to encounter one.However, could it be regarded as a coincidence when two advanced skills were used?\u201cIs there something wrong with my eyes?\u201d That strong guy could not help but blink several times.Another person next to him forced a smile. \u201cIt might have been an illusion if you were alone. But it couldn\u2019t be the case when all of us are watching. This Lighting Rat... is just too abnormal!\u201d\u201cIt has learned two advanced pet skills. This aptitude, this comprehending ability... not even those advanced pets of the thunder family could have done this, could they?\u201d\u201cIf I remember correctly, only that Skydoom Pterosaur of our old team leader can master those two skills. Right?\u201dAfter this thought, those people looked at each other. They could not utter a word.An insignificant low-rank Lightning Rat had a comprehending ability on par with a Skydoom Pterosaur. How...?On the stage.The Lightning Rat that had cloned itself confused the Stone Rhino. The latter could not tell which one was real.Even its master Zhang Xiao had become speechless due to his astonishment at the moment.Zhang Xiao had heard of the advanced pet skill of the thunder family, Thunder Shadow Illusion, in the classes he had taken.That being said, that was all theory. He didn\u2019t know how to solve it!Whoosh!While Zhang Xiao was still at a loss, a figure as fast as lightning was on its way to him.The Lightning Rat was of no threat to the Stone Rhino but it would be dangerous to Zhang Xiao.\u201cNo!\u201dHaving figured out the Lightning Rat\u2019s intention, Zhang Xiao was greatly shaken. He called the Stone Rhino back to defend him through the contract but it was already too late.\u201cAstral Shield!\u201dIn a hurry, Zhang Xiao mobilized the astral power within him to set up a transparent barrier that covered him up.Pff!The moment it was set up, the barrier was smashed.Thunder Slash!The Lightning Rat used the Thunder Slash once again. After the barrier was broken, the sharp edge made by compressed lightning did not stop and was coming toward Zhang Xiao!Whoosh!In the next second, Zhang Xiao disappeared all of a sudden.He was in midair when he reappeared; he was being carried by an almost transparent bird. They landed on the ground slowly.\u201cZhang Xiao lost the second round,\u201d the judge announced in a cold voice. That peculiar bird that was carrying Zhang Xiao turned around and flew toward the judge, gradually disappearing into thin air.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One of them had the bloodline of a king beast and the other was a pet that was antagonistic to the Lightning Rat. For the second pet, it would reach the fourth rank once it grew into adulthood!Two pets like this had both been defeated by a cheap, low-rank Lightning Rat!\u201cIs that a pet skill of the thunder family, Thunder Shadow Illusion?\u201d\u201cGood heavens, how can a Lightning Rat use such an advanced pet skill?\u201d\u201cThat is simply horrifying. That is the king of rats!\u201dMany students present had recognized the \u201cThunder Shadow Illusion.\u201d They discussed heatedly in shock.\u201cI won again...\u201dSu Yanying felt she was dreaming as she looked at the Lightning Rat which was bouncing back to her. None of it seemed real.\u201cSh*t!!\u201dZhang Xiao was embarrassed by the shouts of surprise that came from around the venue.He could blame his carelessness and underestimation for losing the first round. However, he had to admit inferiority since, for the second game, he sent out the Stone Rhino but failed again.A mere Lightning Rat had defeated him. How shameful that was!\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that the Starry Hiero Beast is still in cultivation and I cannot bring it here, I wouldn\u2019t have allowed the match end like this!\u201d A cold and vicious glare filled Zhang Xiao\u2019s eyes; he directed his ill intent to Su Yanying who was in the distance. He couldn\u2019t stomach the fact that she had humiliated him!\u201cNext, please send out your pets for the third match,\u201d The judge said loudly. Then, he looked at the Lightning Rat in Su Yanying\u2019s arms. This little guy was amazing. It was so talented that it would incur jealousy. Without any surprises, the Lightning Rat was capable enough to defeat all the other low-rank pets with the two advanced pet skills.\u201cHmm!\u201d Zhang Xiao snorted coldly. He turned around and went off the stage without the third pet.He admitted defeat.He had another pet that was more powerful than the Dragon Hound; that pet was his ace card for the preliminary matches, but it wasn\u2019t much different from the Dragon Hound.Besides, he still had to find a strategy to counter the \u201cThunder Shadow Illusion\u201d constructed by the Lightning Rat. To fight the Lightning Rat recklessly with no regard for the consequences would lead to a lose-lose situation.He had many more opponents to compete with. Losing this one point would not hinder him from passing the preliminary match. He didn\u2019t need to reveal all his cards which would only expose all his abilities to others.With the departure of Zhang Xiao, a great deal of cheering broke out at once.Except that there was some booing amid the cheers.Nobody could have thought that they would cheer for a low-rank, cheap Lightning Rat at a grand and serious event like this. While surprised, they found this turn of events hilarious.\u201cI won...\u201dSu Yanying stood there, absent-minded, and watched as Zhang Xiao left the stage. The passionate cheers were telling her that everything was real.She...She didn\u2019t do anything and still she had won.The Lightning Rat that was lying in her arms; to think she had once considered removing the contract that had brought her such an effortless victory.\u201cThunder Slash, Thunder Shadow Illusion...\u201d Su Yanying looked at the Lightning Rat that was nuzzled up in her arms. This was strange. Surprisingly, the pet skills that were so intimidatingly powerful could be found in a Lightning Rat.Why didn\u2019t she know that it was so talented in combat before?She just left it for a month at the store and it came back a different person. No, a different rat.The thought of pet boarding reminded Su Yanying of something. The confusion in her eyes was fading away. She wondered if everything was related to that pet store she went to.But, that was just a normal pet store. This was unlikely....\u201cSuch an eye-opening day!\u201d\u201cRight. We have just witnessed a magical fight.\u201dIn the leaders\u2019 seats, some powerful people were still amazed after the battle had come to an end. They were smiling brilliantly.\u201cI\u2019ve heard some stories. People say that some low-rank pets are incredibly talented and can learn rare pet skills, and even have the ability to defeat more advanced pets. I had always doubted that. But it seems like it\u2019s possible...\u201d the strong-built person exclaimed.The red-haired lady nodded in agreement. \u201cFor a Lightning Rat to have two advanced pet skills is far from a coincidence. It must be due to its master\u2019s training. All I can say is that its master is a genius!\u201d\u201cThat girl over there? Well, well, interesting. She is so confident that she didn\u2019t apply any of the most basic augmentation effects to the Lightning Rat. It seems that we have yet to have a full understanding of what the Lightning Rat is capable of.\u201d\u201cHa, ha, you are reading too much into it. But, it\u2019s not an easy task to train a low-rank Lightning Rat to this level. I am curious. If she has such abilities, why wouldn\u2019t she train other, more advanced Astral Pets? Is it possible that there is some special reason for it?\u201d\u201cVice Principal Dong, this girl deserves our attention.\u201d\u201cOf course. I will never pass up on a talent like her!\u201d......It was getting late.At the Pixie Pet Store on Taohuaxi Street.It was already dark outside by the time Su Ping woke up. He had slept straight into the night.He got up and turned on the light. The incandescent light was kind of offending to the eyes. Su Ping placed his hand in front of his eyes and squinted to get used to the light. Then, he heard his stomach growling.Only then did he remember he hadn\u2019t had lunch yet.But, other than the starving belly, Su Ping felt he was refreshed, hale and hearty.He looked at the time. It was after ten and this was when he usually closed the store.Of course, the other pet stores weren\u2019t like this. Some stores would even stay open all night and two groups of people would have to take shifts. However, those were the stores that had a healthy business. Besides, the old Su Ping was unwilling to stay in this little store. He couldn\u2019t wait to pack up early so that he could go back home and play games in his cozy nest.And yet, this Su Ping was the newcomer. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t violate the original owner\u2019s rules. Besides, he was indeed hungry.He found the keys, turned off the lights, and locked up in one smooth action.He rode the bike and headed north.Half an hour later, Su Ping arrived home.\u201cI am back.\u201dHis mother Li Qingru was sitting in the living room watching TV. She turned the volume down as soon as she saw Su Ping coming in and changing his shoes. \u201cHow was the business in the store today?\u201d she turned around and asked him.Su Ping observed her expression; she was concerned about the store.\u201cIt was fine...\u201d Su Ping gave a vague answer. He couldn\u2019t tell her that he had slept through the afternoon.Afraid that he would feel upset, Li Qingru comforted him and gave him some advice, \u201cTake your time and don\u2019t give up. As long as you take good care of every pet, the good ratings will increase and so will the business.\u201dWhen Su Ping changed his shoes and stepped into the living room, she stood up and asked, \u201cYou must be hungry. I\u2019m going to heat some dishes for you. Or, do you want to eat with your sister when she comes back?\u201d\u201cShe hasn\u2019t come back yet?\u201d Su Ping was surprised.Usually, Su Lingyue would have already finished her dinner at home by this time. Why hadn\u2019t she returned yet?\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? Your sister\u2019s academy is hosting a tournament today. She will be back later,\u201d Li Qingru said, grumpily. She knew about the relationship between this pair of siblings. She found it annoying, although she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.They were too old to always listen to her.\u201cRight...\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t seem to be interested. \u201cI\u2019m hungry. I\u2019ll start without her,\u201d he said.While he wanted to reconcile with his sister, he was unwilling to simply head on to bouts of suffering. He was starving and had to eat first. What was more, even if he wanted to wait for his sister to come back and eat with her, she might not appreciate the kindness.\u201cMom, I\u2019m back.\u201dUnexpectedly, the door was opened just as Su Ping uttered the last syllable. Su Lingyue stepped in. She glared at Su Ping since she heard his last sentence.After she changed her shoes, she walked directly to the living room. She rolled her eyes when she saw Su Ping standing in the corridor. \u201cMove out of my way!\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He hung up his coat, then he went to the sofa in the living room and poured himself a glass of water.\u201cHmm.\u201dHe had just filled the glass when a delicate hand with porcelain skin reached over and took over the glass. She drained the cup with one gulp. Who could it be other than Su Lingyue?Her raised eyebrows which expressed \u201cdo you have a problem with that?\u201d when Su Ping landed his gaze on her.Su Ping cast a glance to the Phantom Flame Beast who was crouching on her shoulder. That pet harbored no good intentions. Su Ping felt he had to be the bigger man to live his life. Therefore, he decided not to hold the grudge against her. He just took another glass and poured himself some water.Su Lingyue snorted. She threw herself into the other side of the sofa and stretched to feel comfortable. \u201cSomeone is getting smarter today. Good, the stupid guy can be taught.\u201dSu Ping paid no heed to her words.

This Phantom Flame Beast was really bad...Noticing Su Ping\u2019s stares, Su Lingyue glared at him. \u201cWhat are you looking at with those obscene eyes of yours? My Snowball is an excellent Phantom Flame Beast. It is second to none among pets of the same rank. Hmm, there is no telling who can win even if Snowball meets a fourth rank pet.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dSu Ping did not express an opinion.This Phantom Flame Beast currently was at the upper position of the third rank but its combat strength was rated 4.6. According to the interpretation made by the system, in reality, Snowball\u2019s actual combat strength had reached the intermediate position of the fourth rank!Indeed, it was remarkable that Snowball could compete against those in a higher rank.But, that was it.The Lightning Rat he trained had its combat strength rated at 3.6 when it was only at the upper position of the first rank!He supposed that the Lightning Rat would be able to demonstrate abilities of the fifth or sixth rank when it reached the third rank. That aptitude should be deemed outstanding!Yet, even such a genius Lightning Rat could only be rated as below the average by the system.As far as Su Ping could tell, there was a long journey of progress laid before this Phantom Flame Beast. He wasn\u2019t expecting that this Snowball could become alarmingly strong, but, maybe, it would be just average.\u201cWhat? What are you laughing at?\u201d Su Lingyue frowned and pulled a long face.Su Ping was speechless. \u201cWhat, I can\u2019t even laugh now?\u201d\u201cBut that is a cold laugh.\u201d\u201c...\u201d\u201cAll right, all right. What are you two fighting about now? Come on and eat.\u201d Li Qingru came over with the heated dishes and said to the siblings, \u201cTime for dinner. Don\u2019t watch TV now.\u201dSu Ping did not want to badger Su Lingyue at the moment. He got up to wash his hands for dinner.The dinner was sumptuous, with fish soup, stewed pork with brown sauce, fried pork with hard bean curd, and some other vegetables. This feast provoked Su Ping\u2019s appetite. He washed his hands and took his seat to dig in.Su Lingyue came to the dining table with Snowball in her arms as well.Li Qingru filled Su Lingyue\u2019s bowl with rice and sat down. \u201cHow was the match today? Did you pass?\u201d Li Qingru asked.Su Lingyue picked up her chopsticks. The corner of her mouth was raised while she kept a straight face, \u201cToday was just for preliminary rounds, which is of no trouble to me. Besides, all my opponents are just some new students in my class. It wasn\u2019t much of a challenge. It took me just one morning to collect all the points to be qualified for the next round. It is just a pity that...\u201d\u201cWhat is a pity?\u201d Li Qingru became concerned.\u201cIt\u2019s just a pity that I cannot compete against the seniors in the third grade. Otherwise, I could have a chance to join in the finals.\u201d Su Lingyue appeared to be sorry for this fact.\u201cEh-hem!\u201d Su Ping almost choked. He began to cough violently.Su Lingyue looked at him through the corner of her eyes. \u201cNo one is taking food away from you. Aren\u2019t you afraid of choking to death by eating so fast?\u201dSu Ping finally recovered after he took a few sips of the fish soup. He didn\u2019t give her a response and simply focused on his meal.Li Qingru set her mind at ease after Su Lingyue\u2019s explanation. \u201cLook at you. You have just entered this academy of Astral Pets. It\u2019s not an easy task to stand out amongst the new students. Don\u2019t compete against the seniors or you will be worn out,\u201d the former said, sulkily.\u201cSure, mom, you\u2019re right.\u201d Su Lingyue nodded at once. Her smiling eyes curled like a crescent moon.Su Ping coughed again.Su Lingyue threw him a look that could kill people.Su Ping could tell that a gaze that was growing in sharpness was fixed on him without even having to look up...\u201cYou must be tired. Eat all you want.\u201d Li Qingru picked up some pork to put in Su Lingyue\u2019s bowl.\u201cSure. You too, mom,\u201d Su Lingyue answered with a giggle.Su Ping was quick to finish the first bowl of rice and he filled it again.Su Lingyue suddenly remembered something that made her exclaim, \u201cAnyways, there was something strange at the tournament today. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll believe me when I tell you.\u201dLi Qingru was surprised. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asked with curiosity.\u201cThere is a girl, a senior, and she seems to be one of the students always in the spotlight at the academy. But she only used one Lightning Rat in today\u2019s matches. We all thought that she was losing her mind. Only, you know what? Her Lightning Rat won two games in a row and it defeated a Dragon Hound and a Stone Rhino!\u201d Su Lingyue\u2019s eyes were shining as she shared the news. She was excited.\u201cLightning Rat?\u201d The name caught Su Ping\u2019s attention.Li Qingru was astonished as well. \u201cThe Lightning Rat defeated a Dragon Hound and a Stone Rhino? Are you sure? Was it a Thunderstorm Rat? Alas, no, not even a Thunderstorm Rat could have...\u201dAs a formal trainer, Li Qingru was familiar with pets. She could tell such an occurrence would be impossible!Sensing that Li Qingru was doubtful, Su Lingyue decided not to keep them guessing. She went on with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t be freaked out when I tell you that this Lightning Rat has mastered two advanced skills, a seventh-rank \u2018Thunder Slash\u2019 and the \u2018Thunder Shadow Illusion\u2019! Relying on the two skills, the Lightning Rat defeated the Dragon Hound easily and crushed the Stone Rhino who failed to protect its master!\u201dSu Ping was stunned.\u201cThunder Slash?\u201cThunder Shadow Illusion?\u201cWas this the Lightning Rat I trained?\u201cCould it be...\u201dAll of a sudden, Su Ping remembered the look of the master of that Lightning Rat. She was young, about the same age as Su Lingyue. That was to say, that girl was very likely to be a student.More importantly, Su Ping didn\u2019t think there could be another Lightning Rat that was so horrifying, also able to master the same skills the one he trained did.\u201cSuch a small world...\u201dSu Ping mumbled to himself and produced a fake smile.He would have never imagined that the master of that little guy was going to the same academy as Su Lingyue.\u201cTwo advanced skills?\u201d Li Qingru was taken aback. \u201cWhat a talented Lightning Rat!\u201d\u201cRight, everyone was astonished.\u201d Su Lingyue had the same feeling. \u201cIts master is a genius. There are few people that I, Su Lingyue, admire. Now that senior girl can be counted as one of them.\u201dSu Ping stopped his mind from wandering around and glanced at her. He was thinking, \u201cIf you only knew your brother did this, would you still treat me the same?\u201dBut that was only on his mind. His sister would not believe him even if he told her the truth. Rather, she would laugh at him.After dinner, Su Ping and Su Lingyue went their separate ways.Su Ping headed upstairs after his shower. He had thought that he would have more energy to burn off after his afternoon nap. However, he was assaulted by drowsiness as soon as he lay down. Soon, it was dream time for him.The next morning.Su Ping saw a ghost face in front of him as soon as he woke up. Having become prepared due to the last day\u2019s fright, he was only shocked for an instant before he caught his breath. He glared at Su Lingyue, who was sneering outside the door, and got up to go downstairs.After breakfast, Su Ping and Su Lingyue left respectively, one for the academy and the other for the store.Su Ping felt invigorated and recharged after a night\u2019s rest. He had decided to harvest food that day, so that he could gain more energy as soon as possible!At the store, Su Ping first fed the Managarm and then he closed the door. He summoned a cultivation plane window in his mind.Soon, the window appeared.Su Ping selected a plane that only required one point of energy to teleport and chose to enter.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Before him was a bleak mountain forest with no signs of civilization. He could look directly into the vast space with countless stars above his head.Su Ping took a quick look around. He exhaled in relief after making sure that there were no monsters of any kind. Then, he asked the system in his mind, \u201cI heard you say 30 free deaths. Shouldn\u2019t it be unlimited times?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d The system answered indifferently, \u201cThe benefit of unlimited times is exclusive to the beginner\u2019s quest. Currently, the host has finished that quest and therefore is no longer eligible for that benefit!\u201d\u201cAlso, after the beginner\u2019s protection for one month, the host will no longer be granted free deaths. Therefore, the host must improve his abilities as soon as possible, or else it will be difficult for the host to move a single step in the future!\u201dSu Ping was stunned. He found this hardly understandable. \u201cSo, according to you, what will happen to me when I can no longer enjoy free deaths? Will I just drop dead, literally?\u201dHe didn\u2019t have the confidence to say that he would never die, not even once, in a horrifying place like the Thunder Cloud Realm!\u201cThe host can purchase chances for deaths with energy points and the price is one tenth of the price of that corresponding cultivation plane. When the times of available deaths return to zero, the host will be forcefully teleported back to the main world,\u201d the system explained.\u201cThey can be purchased?\u201d Secretly, Su Ping sighed in relief with this new information. That would be reasonable.Roar!All of a sudden, a violent roar came from the distance, just like a sudden clap of thunder.Caught off guard, Su Ping bent over. Then he saw that across the sky on the horizon, the clouds and mist were dyed red as if something were burning. It seemed that a fierce battle had broken out under that sky!\u201cMy God, the roar was so loud. Not even a king of beasts could be this loud...\u201d Su Ping\u2019s heart was pounding. Without hesitation, he turned around and soon ran to the other side of the forest.He ran for a few hundred meters.Bang!A shrill cry was suddenly heard. Su Ping only had enough time to turn his head. In his sight, there appeared a ferocious mouth moving in closer.He blacked out.Su Ping knew that he had died before he could experience the pain.To make it worse, he didn\u2019t even have the chance to see what killed him.There was something he was sure of, though. His body must have been eaten up by that thing.\u201cDoes a cultivation plane that costs one energy point have to be this terrifying? What the hell...\u201d Su Ping had nothing else to say. How long had he been in here? He died an unnatural death without doing anything. This was such a sudden death!\u201cI am too vulnerable...\u201dSu Ping felt worn out already. He was just a common person. Some monsters that were skilled in hiding could be concealed in the dark. There was no way that he could have noticed them. Maybe he would be just sending himself to the mouth of those monsters...He saw a prompt message. \u201cRevival on the spot/revival at a random spot?\u201dSu Ping rolled his eyes. He didn\u2019t even know his own actual state after death. He had no tangible body but with a force of habit, he chose \u201crevival at a random spot.\u201dWhite, glaring light flooded over from all sides. He had a better sight after that jump.Soon, he could see his surroundings. This time, he found himself on a desolate hillside with sparse weeds. There were no monsters around.\u201cWait a minute. Is that...?\u201dAll of a sudden, Su Ping saw a pile of rocks trembling in the distance. Upon a closer look, he felt his whole body break out with gooseflesh.That was no pile of rocks. It was a python that had a body built with rocks!Winding Stone SnakeProperty: pet of the earth familyRank: the lower position of the eighth rankCombat Strength: 8.1Aptitude: poorAbilities Mastered: Entangle, Swallow, Mine Burst, and Earth Guardian.While Su Ping was gazing into the distance, information about this python suddenly jumped to mind. Su Ping\u2019s pupils contracted as he saw the rank. This was a pet of the eighth rank!But, this eighth-rank Winding Stone Snake had a poor aptitude. Su Ping had not seen anything like this before. This python had to be one of the weaker amongst its peers with a combat strength of hardly above eight.\u201cRun!\u201dSu Ping turned around and prepared to run away at once. He kept on mumbling, \u201cIt cannot see me.\u201dThe moment he turned around, he cast a glance through the corners of his eyes. He stopped on the spot at once.\u201cScarlet Stone Fruit?\u201dFour or five meters ahead of him, there was a plant growing out from the stone cracks. It was a small tree that was about half a meter tall with a cluster of fire red fruits which were shaped like raindrops. Those fruits were the size of beans and they were dangling in the wind.It was as if he had known about this plant since a long time ago. Much information about this plant surged in his mind, including the functions and growth cycles, etc.What interested Su Ping enough to stop was the fact that this was the Vermilion Bird\u2019s favorite food!\u201cPet food?\u201d Su Ping was lost in his thoughts. He didn\u2019t know that he could find pet food right there under his nose. He had to thank the \u201cAeon Plant Identification Spell\u201d the system had granted him temporarily. Because of this, such knowledge would prevent him from missing out.That being said...The expressions on Su Ping\u2019s face changed as he looked at the wiggling Winding Stone Snake in the distance.After a mere moment of hesitation, Su Ping had made up his mind. He dashed out from behind the rock all of a sudden and ran toward that \u201cScarlet Stone Fruit,\u201d throwing caution to the wind.He picked up the Scarlet Stone Fruit plant violently. However, its roots were quite firmly set. Since he had overexerted his strength, some of the thorns stabbed his palm, inflicting a dull pain.\u201cCollect into the storage space. Yes or no?\u201d the system queried.\u201cYes!\u201dSu Ping answered without further thought.The Scarlet Stone Fruit plant vanished from his hand instantly. At the same time, in his mind, he felt there was an addition of a virtual space with a small area and the Scarlet Stone Fruit plant was floating around inside.\u201cIs this the storage space?\u201d Su Ping took a look and heaved a sigh of relief.Hiss, hiss!Unexpectedly, the ground around him began to tremble.Su Ping raised his head. In the distance, the Winding Stone Snake had lifted its head as well and was staring at Su Ping.\u201cRun!\u201dWithout further ado, Su Ping turned around and began to run at once, even though he knew the chances of him escaping were very low.More than a dozen seconds passed.\u201cRevival on the spot/revival at a random spot?\u201dThe system presented him with the choices again. It went without saying that Su Ping didn\u2019t make it. He was swallowed by the smelly mouth of this Winding Stone Snake and was squeezed to death.He even felt the pain was surreal when he was falling apart.Su Ping grimaced in pain. Even to this moment, he was still shivering uncontrollably, as if he had been running nude in the chilly wind.\u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t entirely fruitless...\u201d Su Ping felt comforted that at the very least, he had harvested some food. It was painful but whose life wasn\u2019t?\u201cI have 28 more chances left. If I can harvest some food right before I die every time, I believe I can probably fill up half of the storage space...\u201d Su Ping thought to himself. He was looking forward to the rest of the journey.Su Ping made his choice. \u201cRevival at a random spot.\u201dConsciousness came back to his body again. But as soon as he was brought back to life, he felt a bone piercing coldness. He looked around, only to see that he was floating in water.\u201cWhat random spot is this?\u201d Su Ping was astonished. He turned around. Some monsters that looked like crocodiles were closing in slowly.\u201cI...\u201dSu Ping was given no chances to struggle. In the blink of an eye, the crocodiles sprang at him and tore him into pieces.\u201cRevival on the spot/revival at a random spot?\u201d\u201c...Random.\u201d\u201cRandom.\u201d\u201cRandom...\u201dRepeated deaths and repeated revivals.Sometimes, he would be killed right after he was brought back to life. Sometimes, he would only encounter monsters after he had harvested special pet food.Soon, the 30 free revival chances were used up.\u201cPhew...\u201dSu Ping felt he had been gone for ages when the light came back to his sight and the familiar environment of the store leaped to his eyes. On one hand, he could put his mind at ease. On the other, he felt sorry for that to end.\u201cI believe this was a rewarding harvest.\u201d Su Ping looked at the pet food filling up the storage space in his mind. He was content. In terms of quantity alone, it was very abundant. But he didn\u2019t know how the system would price them.\u201cAre you going to set a price on the pet food and sell them?\u201d The system asked.\u201cYes.\u201dSu Ping answered immediately.Soon, the pet food in the storage space vanished into thin air. Then, Su Ping saw there were some jars and containers on the shelf behind the counter in the store, or something that appeared to be a potted landscape. With no exception, all of them were packed with the pet food that he had harvested at the risk of his life.\u201cScorching Fish Seeker, 380 coins per plant.\u201d\u201cFire and Ice Snakegrass, 800 coins per plant.\u201d\u201cScarlet Stone Fruit, 130 coins per fruit.\u201d...62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: A Price of 20,000Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15: A Price of 20,000Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations\u201cThis price...\u201dSu Ping was surprised at the price marked.Each of those edibles could be sold at over a hundred coins, and that would be at least one point of energy if converted.Many of them could be sold at three or four hundred, or even seven to eight hundred, which could be converted into many energy points!To make it better, it merely cost him one point of energy to teleport to a cultivation plane.At this rate, the revenue generated from this one trip was over a hundred times more than the cost!That being said...Su Ping felt that such matters weren\u2019t all that pleasing once he recalled the 30 times he died.Besides, the fact that he could make this much money was attributable to the fact that the cultivation plane he chose was of a surprisingly high-quality and at the same time, to the free chances of revival provided by the system.Without the 30 free deaths, he couldn\u2019t have had the chance to collect that much food.\u201cAnyways, all in all, to collect food in a cultivation plane is a very good deal. When I can no longer enjoy free deaths, I can buy them. It will only cost me three energy points for 30 deaths. There is no doubt I can make more money than that. It is just those deaths that are disgusting...\u201dSu Ping shook his head. He wasn\u2019t afraid of instant death. It was the slow torture that he was scared of.\u201cThe price for Scarlet Stone Fruits is 130 coins per fruit. That plant I picked must have twenty-some or thirty-some fruits.\u201dSu Ping remembered when he was harvesting the Scarlet Stone Fruit. He began to check the actual number. His assumption was right. There were 34 coins!If he could sell them all, he could have at least 40 energy points!Just the Scarlet Stone Fruit alone could generate massive profits.\u201cWell? The price for this one...\u201dAll of a sudden, Su Ping saw another type of food that was floating in its lonesome on the side. It was like a strange-looking tree sapling, but with leaves of seven different colors.\u201cColored Buddha Leaf, 20,820 coins per fruit...\u201dSu Ping thought he had read the number wrong. Upon a closer look, he was sure he read it correctly. How could it be over 20,000 coins?Startled, Su Ping noticed the effect of this food. This wasn\u2019t the average pet food, but a type of herb that could be regarded as an intelligence enlightening treasure!\u201cIt can help a pet develop its intelligence by a large margin, so that the pet\u2019s power of understanding can be greatly enhanced!\u201dThe power of understanding was of critical importance to pets!The pets that had the power of understanding could learn strong skills easily and comprehend their masters\u2019 instructions in battles.Also, the progress and evolution of pets with the power of understanding would come much easier for them when compared to average pets!In particular, in the same race, pets with a stronger power of understanding would usually be the rulers in their respective race. They could defeat others of the same race easily because of their better understanding of their powers, and their skills in battle were far superior!In a nutshell, the power of understanding was something that could enable a pet to grow and become a ruler of its race!Su Ping had a faint memory that he seemed to have harvested this thing next to a pond. It wasn\u2019t a risky journey. Rather, it was surprisingly easy. He didn\u2019t check it carefully back then. He just picked it up after confirming that it was food. He didn\u2019t expect that it would be the most precious among all the food he had harvested.\u201cThat is over 20,000... and I can make two hundred energy points when I sell it?\u201dSu Ping did the math. He was over the moon. This Colored Buddha Leaf alone could solve the problem of him buying the \u201cAwakening Potion\u201d and he would have some extra money left!\u201cThis trip was so worthwhile!\u201d Su Ping was thrilled. All of a sudden, he felt some extra deaths would not be a problem.Soon, Su Ping calmed himself down. He asked the system at once, \u201cIs it possible that we have set the price too low? If it\u2019s used on an advanced pet, the effect produced would not be something that can be bought with merely 20,000 coins.\u201dSu Ping was sure that if this plant could inspire an advanced pet to learn a rare ability, even adding another zero to the current price would be considered a cheap price. He had beginner\u2019s luck as the buff to help him stumble upon this plant. Usually, people could not find a place to buy it even if they wanted to!\u201cThe host doesn\u2019t have the right to negotiate the price,\u201d The system replied coldly, \u201cThe Colored Buddha Leaf is not the best food to improve the power of understanding. This is just a usual kind of herb. At best, it can exert influence on ninth-rank pets. A price that can be converted to 300 energy points is reasonable!\u201dSu Ping almost flared up. \u201cThe effect is already incredible when the plant can influence ninth-rank pets. The ones above the ninth-rank pets are king beasts. There are few and far between in this entire continent. What more do you want?\u201d\u201cThere is no need to say more. To go on would incur pain experience as punishment!\u201d The system went straight to the point without the slightest hesitation in a colder tone.Su Ping indignant. The system was being unreasonable!In the end, Su Ping had to compromise. He heaved sighs as he checked the remaining food. When he had the total price calculated, his mood turned for the better.\u201cNow, the food is ready. All I have to do is to sell them!\u201dSu Ping took a deep breath. He opened the roller shutter door to welcome in the sunlight.He spent over half a day on the cultivation plane but only an hour had passed in the real world.Su Ping went back to the store. He sat behind the counter to search for information on pets in the federal government resources on the computer, so that he could adjust to this world faster while he waited for customers to arrive.Not long after, there came one.\u201cSir, please give me a bag of food for a Conflagration Canine.\u201d A young man in leisurewear came in without looking up from his phone.Su Ping turned his sights away from the computer. He searched on the shelf and finally found some food that a low-rank canine pet could eat. \u201cHere you go. Three-leafed Flame Grass, just the food for the canine pet of the fire family. The price is 380,\u201d Su Ping said.\u201cOkay.\u201d The young man in leisurewear answered without thinking. He was just about to pay when he suddenly raised his head, shocked. \u201cHow much?\u201d\u201c380.\u201d Su Ping frowned. \u201cThis food can increase the intensity of fire elements in pets of the fire family. With a long-term administration, there is a chance that the low-rank pet in the fire family can evolve into a more advanced pet,\u201d explained Su Ping.\u201cIntensity of the fire element? Evolution?\u201d The young man in leisurewear raised his eyebrows. He looked at the counter behind Su Ping. The prices for those foods stunned him. When he saw the \u201cColored Buddha Leaf\u201d at a price of over 20,000 coins, the young man said nothing and left right away.\u201cSh*t. This must be an inn run by brigands. It\u2019s just some dog food and you\u2019re telling me about evolution. F*ck you...\u201dSu Ping watched as this young man left, interspersing his talk with curses. Su Ping pulled a long face. He was angry but he managed to suppress it eventually.Judging by price alone, it might seem high. But that food had excellent quality and was reasonably priced. He didn\u2019t fool anyone. Rather, as far as he could tell, he was sacrificing part of the profit!He started on the wrong foot, But Su Ping was not frustrated. As long as his goods were of high quality, they would be eventually sold. Gold is bound to shine!\u201cHi, do you sell bird food?\u201dAt noon, another customer came.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was an aged man wearing a Tang suit with a bird pet about half as large as a human.This bird was covered with crimson feathers and it looked like an ostrich with its head dangling down. The bird seemed to be lifeless.Su Ping was surprised the moment he saw this bird.\u201cSir, do you have some unique bird food? Something tastier?\u201d Fan Shangde looked at the seemingly young Su Ping who was behind the counter and stepped forward to talk to him.\u201cTastier pet food?\u201d Su Ping didn\u2019t expect this question. But Su Ping understood after he looked at the depressed bird. \u201cIts appetite is not good recently, is it?\u201dFang Shangde nodded. He sounded vexed. \u201cIt began to eat less a few days ago. I don\u2019t know why. I took it to the doctors but none of them found any results.\u201dSu Ping said that he understood the problem. He turned around and took out a bottle of \u201cScarlet Stone Fruit.\u201d\u201dI think it will like this,\u201d Su Ping proposed.\u201cOh?\u201d Seeing that Su Ping was confident, Fan Shangde picked up the Scarlet Stone Fruit and took a look. \u201cWhat is this pet food? How come I\u2019ve never heard of it?\u201d Fan Shangde asked.Su Ping didn\u2019t know how to explain the details. After all, he had no idea whether the cultivation planes the system sent him to were in the past or still in existence. Maybe this food was from ancient times.Either way, he trusted the system\u2019s judgment.\u201cYou can let it try the food,\u201d Su Ping added.Fang Shangde had his fair share of bird food studies, and yet, he failed to recognize this type. On second thought, he believed Su Ping would not sell something that could harm a bird given this was an official store. He opened the lid and poured two grains out.The moment he opened the lid, the upset fire bird suddenly flapped its feathers. Then, the bird looked up. The depressed and lazy looks in its eyes turned into a radiant glow. The bird was staring at the two Scarlet Stone Fruits in Fan Shangde\u2019s hand.\u201cWhat?\u201d The bird\u2019s reaction took Fan Shangde off guard. He felt confident about the food. He lowered his hand and fed the fruits to the bird.The fire bird pecked on his hand quickly and ate up the two fruits. As soon as it finished, the bird began to chirp happily. Its short wings were flapping quickly. Next, the bird turned its sight to the entire bottle of fruits placed on the counter, glaring at it with passionate anticipation.Fan Shangde was stunned. This little guy had been suffering from a loss of appetite for days. It was a surprise that the bird could gobble down the food and it seemed to be wanting more.Since the food was good, Fan Shangde had no more concerns. He asked Su Ping at once, \u201cSir, what kind of food is this? Give me several bottles, please.\u201dSu Ping saw that the fire bird was licking its chops as if it was going to pounce on the food because it could no longer wait. Calmly, Su Ping grabbed the bottle and moved it back to his side. \u201cThis is the Scarlet Stone Fruit, the most favorite for Vermilion Birds. This is the only bottle available in the store. One fruit is 130 coins and we have 34 here. Do you want all of them?\u201d\u201cWell, 130 coins for one bottle...\u201d Fan Shangde felt this price was reasonable. He came to his senses in the next second. \u201cFor one fruit?\u201dSu Ping nodded. \u201cFor one fruit.\u201dFan Shangde was speechless. He looked into Su Ping\u2019s eyes; since he saw that Su Ping was serious and composed, Fan Shangde was sure that he wasn\u2019t hearing things.At the same time, from the corner of his eye, Fan Shangde noticed the other products behind the counter. He was taken aback as he saw the prices. The food he had chosen was not the only pricey one. There were others even more expensive!He then understood that Su Ping was not deliberately ripping him off.\u201cIs there anything special about the pet food here?\u201d Fan Shangde restored his calmness soon and asked curiously.Su Ping was surprised that this customer could stay this collected. \u201cThe food available has different effects, but the majority can help pets to improve their abilities. Some of the food varieties can produce extra effects. They are far from being mundane pet food. Your money will be well spent,\u201d Su Ping said honestly.\u201cThey help pets improve their abilities?\u201d Fan Shangde was intrigued. Pointing to the \u201cColored Buddha Leaf\u201d with the highest price, he asked, \u201cThis price is over 20,000 coins. What can it do?\u201d\u201cThis one can enhance a pet\u2019s power of understanding,\u201d Su Ping answered.\u201cImprove the power of understanding?\u201d Fan Shangde was dumbstruck. His eyes flickered but soon, he covered up his interest. \u201cThis Scarlet Stone Fruit... give me ten. I will come back if my pet likes it,\u201d Fan Shangde said.Su Ping didn\u2019t see this coming. Was this man placing an order?That was to say... he was making money, right?Su Ping felt a surge of emotions as if he could see the energy points waving at him. On the outside, he remained calm. He did the calculation fast. \u201cTen fruits will be 1300 and your Vermilion Bird has eaten two, so that is 260 coins, which makes for a total of 1560 coins.\u201dFan Shangde nodded and transferred the money to Fan Shangde. \u201cHow long can the ten fruits last?\u201d Fan Shangde asked.Su Ping gave it some thought. \u201cIf you want it to be full... the ten won\u2019t not even be enough for one meal. But, if you want to save, you can mix the Scarlet Stone Fruit with other pet food. This way, those will be enough for 10 meals.\u201d\u201cEh...\u201d Fan Shangde didn\u2019t find this food pricey to begin with, but he realized it was expensive after considering Su Ping\u2019s suggestions.He was not in want of money but when he thought about 1500 coins for one meal...\u201cThank you, sir.\u201d Fan Shangde left the pet store after this gesture of appreciation. When he was about to step away, he turned around and took a look at the shop sign\u2014Pixie Pet Store.\u201c...\u201dHaving sent away the customer, Su Ping checked his account immediately. There was an addition of 1560 coins!If converted, it would be 15.6 energy points!For him to collect the pet breeding mission, it would only cost him 10 energy points and he could breed a pet. That was to say, he could already finish his mission!\u201cLucky for me, the cultivation plane I chose was not desolate. It would have been a bad start if I had chosen a barren world...\u201d Su Ping felt fortunate.......Azure Bay Garden.This was a neighborhood that seemed quite ordinary. The buildings were shabby and aged.Fan Shangde walked with his hands clasped behind his back. He was in a superb mood. He walked the Vermilion Bird back to the neighborhood, leisurely and carefree. Along the way, he met some old friends, some with their pets, or with their better halves. They were also strolling in the neighborhood park.\u201cOld De, you\u2019re walking that silly bird again...\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re walking your better half as well...\u201d\u201cPff, you\u2019re walking your better half!\u201d\u201cOld De is old but still licentious. Let\u2019s go...\u201dAn old couple hurried away.Fan Shangde laughed once their bickering was done. He took the Vermilion Bird back to his building; then he took out his keys and opened the door.He stepped into the elevator and rode to the sixth floor.He lived in room 601.As soon as he opened the door, Fan Shangde could tell that someone else had arrived. The most obvious mark was that the several pairs of dirty socks he threw by his door were gone!\u201cWas it a burglary?\u201dFan Shangde did not panic; rather, he was quite calm. He changed his shoes at the foyer and headed to the living room. He saw two people sitting there and smelled some delicious dishes coming from the kitchen.\u201cGrandpa, you\u2019re back.\u201d The two young people sitting on the couch stood up at once.From their reactions, the girl was livelier. Her eyes glowed as she saw Fan Shangde. She ran over cheerfully and said, \u201cGrandpa, we\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time.\u201dFan Shangde smiled and patted the girl\u2019s head. \u201cHow come you have time to visit me today?\u201d\u201cI missed you, grandpa,\u201d The girl said with honeyed words.\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you sweet?\u201d Fan Shangde pinched her nose.The other young man that was standing by the couch smiled fatuously. \u201cGrandpa, didn\u2019t you say that your Vermilion Bird had no appetite and would not eat? I asked someone in my team to get something birds of the fire family love. I\u2019m here to deliver them to you today.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is what I should do.\u201d The young man scratched his head, smiling quietly.The girl ran to the side of the living room and took out a metal case. She waved at the Vermilion Bird. \u201cXiao Huo, come here. These are all for you.\u201dShe opened the case and over a dozen varieties of pet food were revealed, including flowers, fruits, grasses, and even sealed cans with worms in them. All of it was food favored by birds.Fan Shangde threw a look and said to the Vermilion Bird behind him. \u201cCome on and take a look. Someone brought you some nice food.\u201dBeing an intermediate-rank pet, the Vermillion Bird was quite intelligent. It had been showing a lack of interest and only stepped over reluctantly after Fan Shangde had said so. The Vermilion Bird stuck out its head and took a look at the goods, then it turned around right away. Its eyes were filled with laziness. The bird nestled on the ground, not intrigued at all.\u201cWell...\u201dThe girl was surprised. She didn\u2019t foresee that the Vermilion Bird would ignore her like this. How come it wasn\u2019t interested when there were so many delicacies?The young man standing next to her was stunned as well. He felt the situation was awkward.Fan Shangde, on the other hand, was not taken aback. He tried coaxing the Vermilion Bird into eating several of the treats the young man had brought but none of them worked.\u201cGrandpa, your bird is not coming down with something strange, is it?\u201d The girl couldn\u2019t help but consider the possibility as she saw the Vermillion Bird lying on the ground, low-spirited.Fan Shangde raised his eyebrows. He would have had the same idea on any other day. However, he was convinced that it was because of the food, after he witnessed with his own eyes how happy the Vermilion Bird was when it enjoyed the food in the pet store.\u201cIt has been losing appetite recently and will not eat any of the usual food. I suppose it will be better after some time.\u201d Fang Shangde answered calmly and sat down on the side to rest.The young man\u2019s eyes flickered. Building on what Fan Shangde said, the young man proposed, \u201cIf so, grandpa, why don\u2019t you bring it uptown with us. We have the best hospitals for Astral Pets there and it can be cured. Problems should be solved timely to avoid things to go wrong in the future. It will be quite convenient.\u201dFan Shangde snorted. \u201cI already said my piece, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201dThe young man expression\u2019s changed. He said nothing else.\u201cGrandpa, you don\u2019t want to go but you have to consider it for Xiao Huo\u2019s sake. It won\u2019t last long if it continues to go on a hunger strike like this. You cannot simply wait for it to starve to death and do nothing about it!\u201d The girl tried to persuade him from another perspective, using a different way to solve the problem.Hearing this, Fan Shangde raised his eyebrows. Somehow, he felt smug. \u201cIt won\u2019t starve. I already took it to get quality food today. It\u2019s just unwilling to eat this average pet food you brought here. That doesn\u2019t mean that it won\u2019t eat anything else,\u201d said Fan Shangde.The young man was speechless. The food he brought was considered average? Every item was considered precious pet food!\u201cYou bought food for it?\u201d The girl sounded surprised. \u201cWill it eat other pet food?\u201d There was an odd look on her face.\u201cOf course.\u201d Fan Shangde laughed.\u201cI\u2019m not convinced.\u201d Fan Xiaoyu was still in disbelief. She believed that her grandpa was just making up excuses. After all, in all those years, her grandpa had come up with many strange excuses just to avoid living with them in the uptown area.Fan Yujing, the young man, was just as baffled after that exchange.Fan Shangde puckered his eyebrows. He reached into his pocket and grabbed the little bottle. He pulled out the cap and poured out one fruit.\u201cCome here,\u201d Fan Shangde called the Vermilion Bird.The Vermilion Bird had turned over the moment Fan Shangde opened the bottle.The fruit was thrown to the Vermilion Bird.The Vermilion Bird caught it with its mouth and swallowed it at once.This scene shocked the siblings.Soon, Fan Xiaoyu came back to her senses. She would not believe what had happened. \u201cIt must be because the food we brought was placed on the ground and Xiao Hou doesn\u2019t find any of it interesting. I\u2019ve used the wrong way to feed it.\u201dWith that said, she took out some fruits from the case and said, \u201cXiao Huo, here.\u201dThe Vermilion Bird turned over.A big pile of fruit was forced onto its beak.Fan Xiaoyu: \u201c...\u201dFan Xiaoyu was in a cold sweat as she saw the Vermilion Bird about to fly into a fit of rage. Her hair was standing on end; she didn\u2019t dare to try again.\u201cNow you believe me,\u201d Fan Shangde said, laughing with satisfaction.Fan Xiaoyu looked at him speechlessly. She knew that her plan of using Xiao Huo as a leverage to persuade him had fallen through.\u201cGrandpa, what kind of food is this? I\u2019ve never seen it before. Where did you get it?\u201d Fan Yujing checked the fruit carefully. He was confused. He had the confidence to say that he had been out for many battles so he was well-informed. Yet, he had never seen this bird food before.Fan Shangde answered casually, \u201cI bought it in a pet store nearby. It\u2019s called something like Scarlet Stone Fruit.\u201d\u201cScarlet Stone Fruit?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu pondered about the name. The name didn\u2019t ring any bells, even though she was a well-versed straight A student. \u201cI have never heard about this fruit before. Is it real food? I\u2019m afraid that it may produce side effects,\u201d she said, wondering.Fan Yujing nodded. \u201cShe\u2019s right. Some unethical pet stores will pass some weed off as pet food. There are strict regulations in the uptown area regarding this, unlike here. Grandpa, don\u2019t put Xiao Huo in harm\u2019s way just because you bought something unknown.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dFan Shangde felt nervous once they put it this way.The Vermilion Bird was his baby; it was of great significance to him. He could not imagine what would happen if something were to happen to it.\u201cI don\u2019t think that is the case. I bought it in a formal store. They have a business license.\u201d Fan Shangde tried to keep a calm appearance while inside he was fearful and trembling.Fan Xiaoyu thought about it. \u201cI heard that some gangster shops will mix some special chemicals in the pet food so that the food they sell tastes better and the pet would crave for more. Pets would lose their minds once they can\u2019t get such food, but they may suddenly die if they eat such food for a long time, or suffer from other ailments.\u201dFan Shangde was dumbstruck. He had seen such reports on the news. He became anxious.\u201cRight. The pet food I brought is the favorite for birds of the fire family but Xiao Huo won\u2019t even look at it. It\u2019s only interested in the fruit you have, grandpa. This is too strange.\u201d That simple smile vanished from Fan Yujing\u2019s face as his sister explained. Taking that simplicity\u2019s place was something malicious and severe.\u201cWell, grandpa, how much did it cost you?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu asked all of a sudden.Fan Shangde was surprised by this question. Out of instinct, he answered, \u201c1500 coins...\u201d\u201cOne bottle costs 1500 coins?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu was shocked. A layer of ice came onto her pretty face. \u201cThis is not uptown. There cannot be pet food this expensive. That has to be a gangster shop!\u201d\u201cGrandpa, where is the store, and what is its name?\u201d Fan Yujing asked directly.\u201cThe Pixie Pet Store...\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: Breeding Beast KingsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18: Breeding Beast KingsTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsInside the Pixie Pet Store.After the old man left, Su Ping could not wait to head to the Chaos Spirit Pool for Incubation behind the pet store, since he had just made some energy points.\u201cI wonder what kind of Astral Pet can be bred.\u201dSu Ping was filled with anticipation and nervousness. The rarer the Astral Pet coming into being was, the higher the rent would be when he leased it. This could be a source of substantial income!The system reminded him, \u201c[Chaos Spirit Pool for Incubation] is currently at the first level. During every breeding process, one part per one hundred million of \u2018chaos aura\u2019 can be imported. Activate?\u201d\u201cChaos aura? What is that?\u201d Su Ping found it unfamiliar.\u201cChaos aura is the most fundamental energy in the universe, the origin of everything.\u201d The system\u2019s explanation sounded a bit fantasy-like.Su Ping didn\u2019t understand it fully. He frowned. \u201cBut, isn\u2019t it too stingy to import only one part per a hundred million of this source energy?\u201d\u201cThe host can upgrade the spirit pool,\u201d the system suggested calmly.The requirement for upgrading the spirit pool sprang to Su Ping\u2019s mind at once, along with the effects of spirit pools at different levels.Currently, the Chaos Spirit Pool was at the first level. A hundred energy points would be needed to upgrade it to the second level and the chaos aura that could be imported would be increased to one part per ten million. In the best of chances, the pool would give birth to Astral Pets with higher rank bloodlines!To upgrade the Chaos Spirit Pool to the third level would demand ten thousand energy points, which would increase the percentage of chaos aura imported to one part per million. There would be a small chance that an Astral Pet with a beast king\u2019s bloodline could be bred!A hundred million energy points would be needed to upgrade to the fourth level, and the imported chaos aura would reach one part per one hundred thousand. There would be a bigger chance of breeding an Astral Pet with a beast king\u2019s bloodline and a very low possibility that the Astral Pet could be even more powerful!Following the fourth level, there was the fifth, sixth, etc. and the highest was the ninth level!In a ninth level Chaos Spirit Pool, a large amount of chaos aura could be imported. The ancestors of the mythical beasts, the Archaean Deities, could come into being!Su Ping was completely astonished once he reached the latter part of the introduction. Beast ancestors? Archaean Deities?Judging by the names alone, Su Ping could tell that such beings were horrifying. Those creatures had to be more terrifying than those legendary Astral Pets in that illustrated book of feral Astral Pets. Any one of such beings could endanger the whole world!Could such beings also be regarded as Astral Pets?Su Ping felt light-headed the moment he saw the energy points required for an upgrade to the ninth level. He knew that this was way out of his league at the moment. To upgrade to the third level was already in the distant future.Besides, the effects of a third level Chaos Spirit Pool were already shocking.With merely one part per million of chaos aura, there was a chance of breeding an Astral Pet with a beast king bloodline!What was a beast king bloodline?That was to say that such an Astral Pet would already have the strength of a beast king!No matter how poor the Astral Pet\u2019s aptitude was, or how poor its level of understanding was, as soon as the Astral Pet reached adulthood, it would have the strength equivalent to a beast king. The only difference was the ranking among Beast Kings.This did not refer to the Astral Pets that had a percentage of beast king bloodline fused in them. Such Astral Pets were, for the most part, of mixed blood and the beast king\u2019s bloodline would only account for a small ratio. It was almost impossible for such Astral Pets to evolve into Beast Kings.\u201cBreeding Beast Kings...\u201dWhile he stared at this Chaotic Spirit Pool that looked like a dried-up well, his mouth felt parched and his tongue scorched. Beast Kings were creatures that could run wild across the entire land and they were extremely hard to tame. All Beast Kings were violent and cruel. If he could breed one, then he could have a skyrocketing rise!Su Ping had finally calmed himself after a long time of excitement. At the moment, he could only use the first level of the Chaos Spirit Pool. Lucky for him, even at the first level, the Chaos Spirit Pool would have a tremendous effect. There was a small chance that an Astral Pet of the intermediate level could be brought to life!One Astral Pet of the intermediate level would be sold at one hundred thousand coins or more at the federal establishments!\u201cActivate the spirit pool.\u201d Su Ping looked at his 15.6 energy points. He made up his mind and invested the points.-10 energy points.The dry Chaos Spirit Pool began to absorb the energy. As such, a glow suddenly broke out. There was a trace of dark light that glimmered for an instant but then disappeared without a trace. Everything quieted down again.Crack.Something seemed to have fallen apart.Su Ping looked over in surprise.From the edge of the Chaos Spirit Pool crawled out a Little Skeleton that was off-white in color and about 20 cm in height. It was lower than a human\u2019s knee. The skeleton used great efforts to crawl out from the spirit pool. Then, it fell on the ground and shattered into pieces.\u201cA skeleton of the demon family?\u201dSu Ping was stunned speechless.Pets of the demon family were highly popular for battle pets. They were loved by battle pet warriors because of their fierce abilities. But this Little Skeleton... was a pet of the lowest level in the demon family!Su Ping was wishing that he could hit the jackpot and get a pet of the intermediate level on his first try. As it turned out, instead of the intermediate level, this skeleton was the lowest of the lowest level!While he felt like weeping but had no tears, Su Ping wanted to take the chance. He cast an identification spell on the skeleton.Little SkeletonProperty: pet of the demon familyRank: the lower position of the first rankCombat Strength: 1.1Aptitude: poorAbilities Mastered: Severed Limb Reassembly\u201c...\u201dThis panel revealed information that couldn\u2019t be more average. Su Ping felt an urge to cry.\u201cDing! The host has finished the breeding quest. The host will receive a random book about battle pet warrior skills,\u201d the system reminded him.Su Ping came back to his senses. That was when he remembered the reward of the quest. His depressed mood turned for the better. At the very least, he could just think of the Little Skeleton as a tool for accomplishing quests.\u201cWhere is the skill book?\u201d\u201cIn the host\u2019s storage space.\u201dSu Ping entered his storage space to check at once. Not surprisingly, he found a skill book with a light blue color.\u201c\u2018Killing intent\u2019, skill for elementary battle pet warriors.\u201dSu Ping found this surprising. It was \u201ckilling intent.\u201d As he recalled, this seemed to be a rare battle pet warrior skill.Generally speaking, among the skills that a battle pet warrior could master, first and foremost, there were four skills of augmentation effects: strength augmentation, blast augmentation, firmness augmentation, and perception augmentation!The four skills of augmentation effects were essentials for all battle pet warriors!To learn the four skills alone would take a long time. Apart from the four, the other battle pet warrior skills could have other special effects.Take the skill book of this \u201ckilling intent\u201d for example. This skill meant that through the power of the contract, the pet\u2019s desire for homicide would be externalized. The pet would sink into a crazed state and become fearless. The pet would attack violently, without any fear, even when the pet had suffered serious injuries.It could be said that this was quite an aggressive battle pet warrior skill. When dealing with some threatening pets, this skill could produce miracles.\u201cThis appears to be a quite difficult battle pet warrior skill. Battle pet warriors below the fourth rank may not be able to learn it.\u201d Su Ping found this surprisingly pleasant. While the breeding failed to some extent, the reward he drew was good. But he wasn\u2019t a battle pet warrior at the moment, so he couldn\u2019t use it yet.Crack, crack!At the moment, the Little Skeleton that fell by the Chaotic Spirit Pool crawled up again and was stumbling its way to Su Ping. It looked at Su Ping with its empty, dull eyes.Su Ping forced a smile and picked up the Little Skeleton. He went to the counter and asked the system, \u201cWhat is the lending rate for this Little Skeleton?\u201d\u201cPet, Little Skeleton, rent: 1 coin per hour.\u201dOne coin...Su Ping\u2019s mouth twitched. This was the rental price. But if anyone would be willing to rent the Little Skeleton was yet to be seen!After all, who would rent a Little Skeleton at the lower position of the first rank to go into battle?Su Ping\u2019s forced smile had yet to fade away when he heard some footsteps. In the next second, the door was smashed open by two people who dashed in.Su Ping was stunned. He placed the Little Skeleton on the chair by the side and asked the male and female that had come in with overweening arrogance. \u201cAnd you are?\u201d\u201cYou unscrupulous merchant, come clean and tell us, what did you add in the pet food you sold?\u201d the young man said, glaring at Su Ping coldly.The ones that came were none other than Fan Yujing and his younger sister Fan Xiaoyu.They hurried over right after they got the address from their grandfather.Su Ping frowned after a moment of astonishment. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying. Besides, are you my customers? Do I even know you?\u201dHe went through the memories of the previous owner of the body but failed to recognize the two.\u201cI am saying this for your good. Don\u2019t be stubborn and reluctant to admit mistakes or defeats. Or else, you will land yourself in serious trouble!\u201d Fan Yujing looked askance at Su Ping, continuing in a cold voice, \u201cThe food you just sold to an old man, some Scarlet Stone Fruit. What did you mix in them with?\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d Fan Xiaoyu rested her hands on her hips and chimed in arrogantly.At the mention of the Scarlet Stone Fruit, Su Ping remembered which customer it was. He understood what was going on at once, judging by the manners of those two.\u201cAre you suspecting that I tampered with the pet food?\u201d Su Ping pulled a long face. He harvested that food at the risk of his life. How could anyone question him?All of a sudden, the system\u2019s sound alerts sprang in his mind. The system that could always remain composed sounded quite cold, and even furious at the moment.\u201cAd hoc quest: the store is being slandered for no reason. The host must prove innocence personally and demonstrate that there is nothing wrong with the pet food. The host must protect the reputation of the store against any defaming!\u201d\u201cReward if the quest is accomplished: a chance to enter any cultivation plane with an unlimited number of deaths for five days!\u201d\u201cPunishment for quest failure: a 10 points deduction from the host\u2019s grade!\u201dEh?Su Ping stood in amazement.There were ad hoc quests?Besides, for this quest, the reward was a one time access to any cultivation plane for five days with unlimited number of deaths?Previously, Su Ping did not cherish that opportunity presented to him and regretted it later. Surprisingly, there was another chance given to him again. This was a chance to train a low-rank pet to a pet of the highest grade easily!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019d better come clean!\u201d\u201cCome clean?\u201dSu Ping came back to his senses. His eyebrows twitched when he looked at the hand on the counter. A glint of coldness flashed past his dark eyes, but he contained his fury.The two people were battle pet warriors and he was no match for them.\u201cThe host doesn\u2019t have to worry. There is nothing inside this store that can threaten your life. Anything and anyone that shows killing intent towards you will be erased, even when the Immemorial Savior arrives!\u201dSu Ping was stunned speechless. He didn\u2019t know that the pet store had such abilities. Didn\u2019t it mean that this store was his strongest shelter?With the system\u2019s promise, Su Ping felt less worried. Looking at the two indifferently, he said, \u201cDo you have proof that there is inappropriate stuff mixed in my pet food?\u201d\u201cProof?\u201dFan Yujing\u2019s glare turned colder as he went on, \u201cMy words are the proof. Believe me. I will have the Pet Food Association come here to investigate at once and your dirty little store will be shut down!\u201dSu Ping raised his eyebrows.He wasn\u2019t afraid of the Pet Food Association. After all, all the food was natural and harvested by him; there was nothing wrong with it.That being said, the investigation procedures of the Pet Food Association would be complicated and it would affect his business. Besides, that would also harm the store\u2019s reputation. That would put him at a disadvantage when it came to finishing the system\u2019s assignments.At the same time, Fan Xiaoyu noticed the many pet food bottles placed on the shelf behind the counter. When she saw the prices, she cried out in alarm, \u201cBrother, look, this is a clip joint indeed.\u201dSu Yujing took a glance. He pulled a long face at once. \u201cI didn\u2019t know gangster shops were this bold in the outer town. This is a place where there are no rules nor laws.\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dSu Ping snorted. \u201cA high price invariably means that this is a clip joint? Don\u2019t buy or come here and defame people just because you cannot afford it. The things I sell are attractive in price and quality. You get what you pay for. The price is more than reasonable!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t afford it?\u201dFan Xiaoyu laughed out of extreme anger.Even if the price were set ten times the amount, it would be nothing but a casual buy for them. How could he accuse them of not being able to afford anything?Besides, the pet food he had was ten times more expensive than regular pet food. Who gave the owner the courage to call it \u201cattractive in price and quality\u201d?\u201cYou get what you pay for. Nice try. I\u2019d like to know what that thing priced at 20,000 coins can do. Can it make someone live forever?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu burst into laughter out of fury.Su Ping answered calmly, \u201cOnly 20,000 coins and you want to eat it and live forever. You\u2019re not looking for crap to eat, are you?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dFan Xiaoyu opened her beautiful eyes and bellowed, \u201cSay that again?\u201d\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d Su Ping shrugged.\u201cHow dare you insult my sister.\u201d Fan Yujing\u2019s eyes glared in coldness. He made a swift move and reached his hand to grab Su Ping\u2019s neck at lightning speed.However, right at that moment, a sense of fatal danger rose in Fan Yujing\u2019s mind.Before Fan Yujing could think about it, he heard a cracking sound. It was as if his arm had been pushed down by something. The bones in his arm were fractured from the elbow down.The dull pain reached him in an instant. Fan Yujing gasped in pain. He stepped back at once to keep a distance from Su Ping.\u201cBrother?\u201dEverything happened too fast. Still angry, Fan Xiaoyu only saw how her brother was about to teach the other guy a lesson, to then see him suddenly step back as if something had struck him.Fan Xiaoyu turned pale with fright as she saw Fan Yujing with a broken arm. Her brother was not an average boy. He had graduated and joined the rangers as a powerful battle pet warrior. He was far superior than her. How could his arm be broken?Su Ping was surprised by this as well. Inside, he heaved a sigh of relief. The system was freaking awesome and this was a system of words.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that you didn\u2019t mean to end my life, it wouldn\u2019t be just your arm that would be broken.\u201d Su Ping sneered.He was a guy that had died over a hundred deaths in cultivation planes. He had an acute sense of killing intent. Previously, Fan Yujing only intended to teach Su Ping a lesson and did not mean to murder him. Therefore, the system\u2019s punishment was not the most severe.\u201cWas it you who did this?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu turned around and stared at Su Ping, shocked.Who was this person that could easily break her brother\u2019s arm?Also, judging by his looks, she could tell that Su Ping was in his early twenties, younger than her brother. Wasn\u2019t it an indication that Su Ping was more talented than her brother?Fan Yujing was a person that had undertaken countless battles himself. While the pain from the broken arm was sharp, he managed to endure it. He was even more shocked than Fan Xiaoyu. Previously, in that instant, the sense of danger was still lingering in his heart like a needle and it was hard to be erased.He didn\u2019t doubt that he had just visited the gates of hell!\u201cWho exactly are you?\u201d Fan Yujing took a deep breath, putting on a stern look. This person that could break his arm and was younger than him had to be a genius, not a halfpenny the worse than those glamorous talents in the Federation. This person was far from an unknown anonymous guy!\u201cAs you can see, just a normal guy, a pet store owner,\u201d Su Ping said, calmly, \u201cNow, I believe we can communicate like equals.\u201dFan Yujing\u2019s countenance changed. He kept a low voice. \u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to offend you. It\u2019s just that this matter is related to our family. We were too anxious.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s funny.\u201d Su Ping chuckled.At the same time, inside, he was sighing.Right, only the powerful could have a say. Otherwise, people wouldn\u2019t even have the patience to listen to the explanation. The fist ruled even when the words were wrong!\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me what the function of this is?\u201d Su Ping revisited that subject, saying in a nonchalant tone, \u201cThese are Colored Buddha Leaves and can be regarded as a form of pet food. But this is disposable food. The only effect is that it can enlighten a pet\u2019s intelligence and increase the pet\u2019s power of understanding.\u201d\u201cEnlighten intelligence?\u201dFan Yujing\u2019s expression changed once he heard this.All the items that could enlighten intelligence were sold at 100,000, at the very least.Why would this one only cost 20,000?Fan Xiaoyu, who was supporting her brother, was also stunned. She didn\u2019t expect that this garish thing would be a treasure that could enhance intelligence.\u201cWhich pet ranks can be enlightened by these Colored Buddha Leaves?\u201d Fan Yujing voiced another question.Right at this moment, he was no longer regarding this owner as a shady businessman. What kind of trickster was able to break his arm without leaving a trace?Su Ping shrugged. \u201cIt can be applied to all pets below the Beast King rank.\u201d\u201cWell...\u201dThe siblings stared dumbfounded.All pets were inferior to Beast Kings.Didn\u2019t it imply that even pets of the ninth rank could use this?What treasure could enlighten the intelligence of a pet at the ninth rank? Such a treasure could not be purchased with one million, not to mention 100,000 coins!For a moment, the siblings were looking at Su Ping in a weird way. If this man were a fraud, he was unusually powerful; such people were seldom con artists since they wouldn\u2019t have the need for it.But if he weren\u2019t a fraud... then why be so stupid as to sell such a top-level treasure at only 20,000 coins?Su Ping\u2019s mouth twitched as he noticed the funny glares the siblings threw at him. His heart was aching. Of course he knew that the price of 20,000 coins was low. Only the wealthy and ostentatious could regard this kind of price as \u201creasonable.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The items in this store are attractive both in price and quality. It is completely fair.\u201d Su Ping kept a poker face.The siblings could not utter a word.If Su Ping were telling the truth, then this was far from just being attractive in price and quality. He was practically selling at a sacrifice!The siblings looked at each other. They were shocked at the strength Su Ping demonstrated in that strike, but this matter still seemed surreal.Su Ping could tell that this pair was not convinced. He frowned. All of a sudden, he thought of an idea. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, I have something here that can prove it to you,\u201d He calmly said.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu was confused.Su Ping took out a transparent glass bottle from behind the counter and two blue fruits were found in the bottle. Su Ping explained, \u201cThese are Blue Element Fruits, with a low rank rating. This is a kind of food that is favored by advanced pets of the water family. With long-term administration, advanced pets of the family can have their abilities enhanced. If the low-rank pets of the water family can consume such a fruit, they will be directly promoted to the next rank!\u201d\u201cPromoted to the next rank directly?\u201dThe siblings were startled.Things that could enable a direct rank promotion were extremely expensive, even those that were only for low-rank pets.\u201cThe Blue Element Fruit can only be consumed by pets of the first, second, and third rank and only the first-time administration can show effects. The price is 8700.\u201d Su Ping added indifferently, \u201cIf you guys can find some low-rank pets of the water family, you will see the truth with one test.\u201d\u201cOnly 8700?\u201dOnce again, the siblings were speechless due to the appallingly low price.And yet, compared with the Colored Buddha Leaves, they found it understandable.\u201cWell, as for low-rank pets of the water family, I don\u2019t have to get one elsewhere. I have one with me.\u201d Fan Xiaoyu blinked. \u201cSir, can we test it now?\u201d she questioned.Su Ping raised his eyebrows. \u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dAstral powers began to surge over Fan Xiaoyu. She lifted a hand and grabbed at something in the air. A vortex appeared, from which a light blue figure hopped out and landed on her shoulder.This was a blue dotted pet the size of a fist, shaped like a water polo ball. Only its big head could be seen; its four limbs were so short that they were hardly visible.\u201cFountain Beast?\u201d As soon as Su Ping saw this little guy, he recognized it as a first-rank pet of the water family. This pet was extremely common and ordinary, so ordinary that almost every family had one.While those pets were merely at the first rank and their abilities could be practically ignored, they were loved by everyone. The reason was that Fountain Beasts could shoot water jets that were of no offensive value. To a large extent, they could help people save on household water.Many adventurers could also ask the Fountain Beasts for help when they were exploring and wanted to wash their hands, drink some water, or take a bath. Owning a Fountain Beast was like carrying a small water source.\u201cSir, will this work?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu held the Fountain Beast in both hands and placed it in front of Su Ping.Su Ping answered, \u201cSure. But you have to pay for the Blue Element Fruit first.\u201d\u201cWell...\u201dFan Xiaoyu was hesitating.Fan Yujing stepped forward and took out a card. He transferred the money to Su Ping. \u201cSir, please commence.\u201dSu Ping heard the beautiful prompt tone of money entering his account. A faint smile climbed to his otherwise frigid face. He opened the bottle and took out a Blue Element Fruit from it.In his store, this was the pet food only inferior to the Colored Buddha Leaf in terms of price.\u201cLittle guy, here you go.\u201d Su Ping handed the fruit to the Fountain Beast.The Fountain Beast had already smelled the Blue Element Fruit. When Su Ping handed over the fruit, the Fountain Beast could not wait to open its mouth and gobble it down before asking its master for permission.The fruit with the size of a thumb was stuffed into its mouth. It was as if there were a drum filling the Fountain Beast\u2019s mouth, but soon the fruit was gone; the pet had swallowed it.Three people had their eyes glued on the Fountain Beast, waiting for the effect to kick in.Su Ping had thought that the Fountain Beast would need some time to digest it. However, in less than three minutes, something began to happen to the Fountain Beast.The light blue spots on the Fountain Beast began to flow, like liquid. Then, the Fountain Beast\u2019s entire body swelled a bit.This swelling was painful for the Fountain Beast, so it began to roll around on the counter. While it rolled, the Fountain Beast would eject some water arrows.Su Ping used his hand to fend off the arrows. He noticed that it was somewhat painful when the water arrows struck his palm.Whoosh!All of a sudden, a much thicker water arrow was discharged.Su Ping had no time to defend against it but in the next second, that water arrow was stopped by some invisible shield.On the other side, Fan Xiaoyu noticed something as she realized the fact that the water arrows ejected by the Fountain Beast were aggressive. She held up an astral shield to protect her brother and herself.The water arrows provoked ripples as they smashed against the astral shield. Her astral shield was of a high level and could fend off the water arrows easilyA moment later, the Fountain Beast stopped rolling around. Right then, it was two times as large as before. The four limbs that could not be seen earlier were still not visible. The limbs were short, but they were enough to support the Fountain Beast.\u201cIt has evolved...\u201d Fan Xiaoyu opened her eyes wide.Since Fountain Beasts were highly popular, even a seven or eight-year-old kid could tell exactly what Fountain Beasts looked like from the first rank to the third rank. Naturally, Fan Xiaoyu would know.A flash of surprise appeared in Fan Yujing\u2019s eyes. This Blue Element Fruit was an item that could facilitate evolution!While the fruit was only effective for low-rank pets, it was rare!\u201cDone.\u201d Su Ping breathed a sigh of relief inside as he saw the result. \u201cDo you have any other questions?\u201d Su Ping asked.The siblings came back to their senses. They looked at each other and their expressions were troubled.\u201cSorry. We offended you in the beginning,\u201d Fan Yujing said, resisting the pain of his broken arm, slightly gnashing his teeth.Fan Xiaoyu\u2019s expressions changed again and again but eventually, she gave tacit consent to the status quo.They knew that a person that could sell such items for evolution and probably an item for intelligence enlightenment could never be a bad businessman. As such, the fruits this person sold to their grandpa could not be the usual kind, either. That was why the Vermilion Bird loved them.\u201cNo problem.\u201dSu Ping nodded. He accepted their apology. For the time being, it was the other party that had taken a beating. However, without the system\u2019s protection, he would have been the one suffering humiliation. After all, given the other party\u2019s domineering attitude, they would never listen to him.Awkwardness ensued with a short moment of silence.Fan Xiaoyu hesitated for a bit as she saw the Colored Buddha Leaf. \u201cSir, will that work?\u201d she asked.Su Ping raised his eyebrows. Was she still doubting him? \u201cI already made the introduction. I won\u2019t repeat myself,\u201d he said, gloomily.Fan Xiaoyu saw that Su Ping had misunderstood her so she wanted to explain at once. Before she could, Fan Yujing suddenly did something. He transferred the money to Su Ping and said, \u201cWe will take it.\u201dNo amount of explanation could work better than an actual purchase.Fan Yujing felt it worthwhile to test it by spending 20,000. If this article was genuine, then it would be money more than well spent!If it was fake, 20,000 was nothing for him. He could make tens or hundreds of times more with any trip made for opening up virgin soil.Fan Xiaoyu was surprised by her brother\u2019s action but she soon understood his intention. She said nothing more. Still, she felt a bit reluctant inside.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t expect this boy to be so swift in action.The 20,000 coins entered his account and that could be converted to 200 points of energy.With the 200 points of energy, he could buy a bottle of \u201cAwakening Potion\u201d at once, which could make him a battle pet warrior.While he was delighted, Su Ping kept a calm look. At the same time, he felt reluctant to sell it. After all, the Colored Buddha Leaves were more valuable than what the price indicated. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that money made outside the store could not be converted to energy points, he would have tried to sell the Colored Buddha Leaves elsewhere so he could name the price at will.\u201cSystem, can we not increase the price?\u201d Su Ping asked in his mind, unwilling to sell it at this price.\u201cThe system\u2019s pricing is reasonable. There\u2019s no need to change the price,\u201d the system replied.Su Ping felt he was choking on his own blood. His face darkened.The siblings were baffled as they saw this anguished look on Su Ping\u2019s face. Others would be unhappy when a deal fell through. Why would this owner pull a long face when a deal came through? What a weirdo.\u201cHere.\u201dSu Ping handed the plant to Fan Yujing.Fan Xiaoyu took it over for her brother. \u201cHow do you eat this?\u201d She was curious.\u201cHow?\u201d Su Ping said indifferently, \u201cChew it up so you don\u2019t choke.\u201dFan Xiaoyu was on the verge of spitting out blood in anguish. Taunted by his words, she stood there, at a loss, and could not come up with anything else to say.Fan Yujing didn\u2019t mind seeing his sister being humiliated. \u201cSir, how many pieces of Scarlet Stone Fruits are left? I will take them all,\u201d said Fan Yujing.Su Ping\u2019s expression softened a bit as another order was being placed. He turned around and picked up the bottle with Scarlet Stone Fruits to count the number. \u201cOne piece of fruit is 130 and there are 22 left. Altogether, it would be 2860 coins.\u201d\u201cIs that 130 for one piece of fruit?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu came back to her senses, only to be stunned again. \u201cYou are selling on a per fruit basis?\u201cShould I sell them in slices?\u201d Su Ping glared at her.Fan Xiaoyu: \u201c...\u201dFan Yujing had already noticed that his grandpa didn\u2019t have many Scarlet Stone Fruits left. He had been prepared for the price so he didn\u2019t comment further. At least, for the moment, the Scarlet Stone Fruit was the only thing the Vermilion Bird would eat. The price was still acceptable even though it was high.Fan Yujing paid up and collected his merchandise. He darted a glance to the other items on the counter but was no longer in the mood to probe. \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d he said to his sister.Fan Xiaoyu was in low spirits. She carried the food and left the store with her brother. When they got into their car, she snorted angrily. \u201cThis person is despicable. I am furious!\u201dSu Ping lashed out on her several times. She had been grinding her teeth in wrath. She would have come forward to fight back if it weren\u2019t for the fact that Su Ping had displayed a horrifying strength.Fan Yujing didn\u2019t share her view. \u201cIt is us that have been careless. I didn\u2019t know that we could meet such a person in this kind of small place. This person has the strength and is young, yet he is willing to spend his days in comfort here. I cannot figure him out.\u201d\u201cHmm, he is just purposely making a mystery out of simple things. Maybe he\u2019s a bastard from some big family and is homeless, so he has to come here and sell some family belongings just to make some money for food!\u201d Fan Xiaoyu conjured up the meanest assumption. With this said, she couldn\u2019t help but grin. The cloud over her mood had vanished into smoke.Fan Yujing was speechless after seeing how his sister was cheering herself up. \u201cAll right now. You drive. Let\u2019s go to a good hospital to bind up this wound. Later, I will contact my friend and have him treat me,\u201d he said, grumpily.Fan Xiaoyu threw a look at his twisted arm. That grin was soon substituted by a frown. Her look became solemn.This person was far stronger than she was, to be able to hurt her brother this badly. She was sure that she was one of the best amongst her peers at school. She could never imagine that she could meet someone stronger in that remote and backward place.\u201cSo mean!\u201dShe bit her teeth in hatred again as she remembered how detached that person was.Buzzing, buzzing!The car was like a beast that had gone mad. The exhaust growled.Somehow, Fan Yujing felt something was wrong. In the next second, the car was launched forward.\u201cNo...!\u201d......Hearing the car rushing away, Su Ping knew that the siblings were finally gone. He thought they had to be in a rush considering how fierce the exhaust sounded.\u201cAre they rushing to the hospital?\u201d Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He didn\u2019t think about it too much; soon after, he shifted his focus on his account.He did the calculation. His eyes were filled with passionate feelings.8700+20000+2860=31560 coins.Altogether, that was over 30,000 coins!That would be 315.6 energy points when converted!\u201cFinally, I\u2019m out of poverty...\u201d Su Ping teared up. He pulled up the system\u2019s shop and bought that \u201cAwakening Potion\u201d worth a hundred energy points without further ado.-100.When the points of energy were deducted, Su Ping felt his pocket suddenly become heavy with an extra item added.He took it out. It was that bottle of Awakening Potion sold in the shop.Su Ping\u2019s eyes glowed. He asked at once, \u201cSystem, how do I take this?\u201d\u201cThe Awakening Potion is made from an ancient underground spring. Take it orally,\u201d the system gave a simple reply.Su Ping was about to drink it at once when he suddenly remembered something. He left the counter, turned around, and closed the door. Then, he stepped into the back room. He opened the lid and poured the Awakening Potion into his mouth.It didn\u2019t feel like a flow of liquid; it was more like a mist.\u201cSo warm...\u201dAs soon as he took it, Su Ping felt this warm mist spreading across his body through his veins. His arms, legs, and back turned warmer at once.At the same time, his body seemed to be lighter until he felt he weighed nothing, as if he could just float when he stood on his tiptoes.Feeling this warmth, Su Ping could faintly hear some cracking sounds all over his body. That was a special sound that brought a marvelous feeling. It was as if every cell in him was sprouting and cracking, with new things bursting forth.This kind of disputing and revitalizing feeling was not exclusive to his physical body. He felt his brain was going through the same thing. He could hear a constant subtle cracking sound until it completely occupied his mind.After a long, long time.When everything quieted down, Su Ping opened his eyes again.A world that was distinct and in focus was revealed in front of his eyes.To his surprise, Su Ping realized that the darkroom and everything around could be seen vividly, including the protruding particles painted on the white walls.He heard the system\u2019s even tone, \u201cCongratulations to the host on becoming a battle pet warrior. The main quest is initiated.\u201cMain quest: the host is to breed a pet of his own within one week. The aptitude of the pet shall not be lower than upper-middle.\u201dSu Ping was astounded.The main quest?But there were strings attached.He had to have a pet with an upper-middle level in aptitude.When he was training the Lightning Rat, Su Ping already had an idea about how strict the system was. A Lightning Rat that could be regarded as the best was only rated as \u201cbelow average\u201d by the system.He could hardly imagine how outstanding a pet that was rated at the upper-middle level would be!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Antiquity Pet ContractPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22: Antiquity Pet ContractTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsSu Ping inspected the status of his body attentively. He had just become a battle pet warrior.He also had to admit that battle pet warriors and average people were worlds apart. Just on the front of antiquity alone, Su Ping had detected a great difference.He had become lissome and his sight, hearing, and the rest of the five senses had become two times as acute as before!\u201cIn the Federation, battle pet warriors are divided into nine ranks.\u201cThose from the first to the third ranks are elementary battle pet warriors; from the fourth to the sixth are intermediate battle pet warriors. The ones at the seventh rank are advanced battle pet warriors and those at the eighth rank are battle pet masters who enjoy a high status and can be qualified as professors in famous academies.\u201cAs for the ninth rank battle pet warriors, the highest rank, they have titles conferred upon them and are admired by the public!\u201d\u201cBeyond that rank are the legendary Beast King battle pet warriors. Each of such people is a legend. Their life experiences are adapted to movies and novels, so that their stories and exploits can be disseminated through the generations. People will still remember them even after a hundred years of their passing!\u201cJust now, the original core talent has just awakened in me. I haven\u2019t started the battle pet warrior\u2019s training and there\u2019s no astral power in me at all. I cannot even qualify as a first-rank battle pet warrior.\u201cCultivation as a battle pet warrior...\u201dCultivation had posed a conundrum for Su Ping.He was no longer able to get admitted to Astral Pet academies given his age. After all, he had passed the age limit. That is, unless he was admitted via special recruitment due to an outstanding performance.The main knowledge source on cultivation for elementary battle pet warriors were the various Astral Pet academies.While there were some cultivation methods of battle pet warriors posted online, they were superficial. There were no examples for practical applications.\u201cDo I have to... ask my sister for advice?\u201dSu Ping dismissed the idea as soon as it popped up, at the thought of her arrogant face.No matter which way he looked at it, the chances of his sister being willing to teach him would be... zero. No, actually, below zero. He would be mercilessly mocked by her as well!Su Ping shook his head. Anyways, he had become a battle pet warrior. He had to make a contract with a pet first.Su Ping knew the basics of making a contract with a pet. This was no secret. Anyone with some fundamental understanding of pets would know.\u201cThe number of pets a battle pet warrior can make a contract with is directly linked to spiritual power. The stronger the spiritual power is, the more pets can be contracted and the pets will be stronger as well!\u201d\u201cUsually, a battle pet warrior cannot establish a contract with a pet that is two ranks higher than him/herself. Otherwise, the pressure on the spirit would hinder the mind, to descend into insanity until one became mentally retarded!\u201dSu Ping was not even a first rank battle pet warrior. The kinds of pets that he could make contracts with were few and far between. Lucky for him, there was one in the store.Remembering that Little Skeleton, Su Ping began to have second thoughts.That little thing was of practically no value and it would take up a spot if he were to build a contract with it.The more pets were contracted, the higher the pressure on the master\u2019s mind would be.\u201cIf I were to buy other pets when my strength could be improved over time, I would tie them down and their development would be suffocated because most pets with advanced bloodlines would stay in the first rank for a very short time.\u201dSu Ping frowned. As such, there was not much of a choice for him. He had to go with the low-rank pets.Fortunately, he could remove the contract once he became more powerful in the future. Removing the contract would add a burden to his mind as well. Within three days, he would lose his combat abilities. That being said, with the protection of the pet store, such side effects could be ignored.Having made up his mind, Su Ping stopped worrying. He went back to the lobby.Slap!The Little Skeleton seemed to be scared by Su Ping. It rolled down from the chair by the counter, then it fell to the ground, turning into a pile of bones that slowly reassembled.Su Ping was speechless. This Little Skeleton appeared to be timid. This was rarely seen among pets of the demon family.\u201cLittle guy, you will be my pet from now on.\u201dSu Ping moved closer. He picked up the Little Skeleton from the ground and placed it on the counter.The Little Skeleton sat there silently, staring at Su Ping blankly with its hollowed eye sockets.Su Ping was happy that the Little Skeleton was behaving. The only benefit of a timid pet was the fact that they could be tamed easily.He was about to make the contract when, suddenly, he heard the system\u2019s message, \u201cDoes the host want to purchase an Antiquity Pet Contract?\u201d\u201cAntiquity Pet Contract?\u201dSu Ping did not understand.\u201cThe Antiquity Pet Contract is a form of Astral Pet contract and is equipped with all the features of the current Astral Pet contracts. The only difference is that the pet\u2019s emotions can be sensed via the Antiquity Pet Contract. Also, within a specific range, the pet can be called back to the pet space at any time, provided that the pet is not constrained or sealed in any way,\u201d the system explained, with particular patience.Su Ping was left staring, open-mouthed.Different effects could come from varied contracts?In his memory, there was only one form of Astral Pet contracts. Nobody knew that there could be other contracts apart from this common Astral Pet contract!Besides, wasn\u2019t this Antiquity Pet Contract a bit too fabulous to be able to summon the pet back at any time?Being the case, once the pet sensed danger, it could be summoned back to avoid a sacrifice. For battle pet warriors, this was a master skill!Su Ping became alerted as his mind wandered to his point. \u201cHow much energy does it cost?\u201d\u201cOne hundred points of energy will do,\u201d the system replied.Su Ping was amazed.Just one hundred energy points?Why would such an excellent article be sold at such a cheap price?Even the elementary beast catching ring would cost a hundred energy points in this shop!\u201cConsider this contract somewhat like a gift from the system. The actual price is far dearer than this.\u201d The system sounded casual.\u201cReally?\u201d Su Ping was skeptical. Could it be that this was a complimentary offering to begin with, and the system was ripping him off?\u201cWarning. First profanity alert!\u201d\u201cHmm. Did you just admit it?\u201d Su Ping wore a sardonic grin.The system remained silent.Su Ping went through some unspoken criticism in his heart. While he hated to part with his energy points, he did make up his mind and purchased it.For the moment, the contract might not be of great help to him. That being said, beyond all question, this Antiquity Pet Contract was valuable. Furthermore, this contract was not a disposable item. It could be used repeatedly and with all his pets. He could use it for a long time to come.If in the future, this contract could enable him to save the life of an advanced pet, then the 100 energy points would be well spent!-100.\u201cPurchase success. The Antiquity Pet Contract has arrived. Please check,\u201d the system reminded him.Before Su Ping had the time to cry over his lost energy points, he found a complicated mark emerging in his mind. The mark, seemingly made up of many lines, was drawn in his memory stroke by stroke, until it could not be forgotten and he would remember it to the end of his days.\u201cLead with blood and engrave with an array?\u201dSu Ping came back to his senses, still quite confused and stupefied. He focused his mind and the contract method of this Antiquity Pet Contract emerged once more, shocking him again.This contract was not made with astral powers. His blood would be the medium and the content was the array depicted with complex and mysterious lines. Such a contract would be firm and would not be cut off unless the master removed the contract by his own accord.\u201cApart from being able to summon the Astral Pet back, this contract is similar to the ones built with astral powers, including removing the contract. I would lose combat abilities for three days.\u201d Su Ping took a closer look. The system did not lie to him.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

According to the process described in the Antiquity Pet Contract, he bit his finger and slowly painted the Little Skeleton\u2019s forehead with his blood.The Little Skeleton was still sitting there, absent-minded. It seemed to be oblivious of everything around it, but then the Little Skeleton reacted to the smell of blood on Su Ping\u2019s finger; a faint scarlet color appeared in its hollowed eye sockets.The Little Skeleton slowly lifted its arm to reach toward Su Ping\u2019s hand, although the latter retracted his hand right after he finished painting the contract.An intricate blood pattern was engraved on the Little Skeleton\u2019s forehead.As Su Ping lowered his hand, the blood pattern disappeared bit by bit as if the Little Skeleton had absorbed it.In the next moment, Su Ping felt an additional line in his consciousness that was linked to an external consciousness.The second was a quite feeble consciousness, like a flickering candlelight that could die out at any time.From the weak consciousness, Su Ping felt some faint hints of fear and confusion.\u201cIs this the Little Skeleton\u2019s consciousness?\u201d Su Ping looked at the Little Skeleton. With the power granted to him by the contract, he could vividly sense the changes in the Little Skeleton\u2019s emotions.The Little Skeleton looked up, staring blankly at Su Ping. It was still puzzled about the recent changes it was going through.Su Ping patted its little head. After all, the Little Skeleton had just come into being. There was no legacy nor memory in it. It was only natural that the Little Skeleton would be muddleheaded about everything.Su Ping went to open the door. As the sunlight flooded the store, he abruptly sensed fear coming from the Little Skeleton\u2019s mind.He turned around, only to see the Little Skeleton who had fallen from the counter. The bones scattered around slowly moved into the shades at a corner by the counter. The Little Skeleton reassembled itself. It was hugging its knees, curled up, shivering from fear.\u201cIs it afraid of sunlight?\u201dSu Ping was surprised. He realized that he had been ignorant. The majority of pets of the demon family preferred a dark environment. A fraction of them were so afraid of sunlight that they could only stay in darkness.Su Ping came back at once and carried the trembling Little Skeleton to the pet room at the back.There was an empty nursing pen. Su Ping placed the Little Skeleton in the stalagmite array.\u201cSystem, this complimentary nursing pen costs 10 coins per hour. What can it do?\u201d Su Ping asked out of curiosity.It was not a cheap price to hire the pet boarding service at 10 coins per hour.\u201cThe free nursing pens are built with scrap spirit stones. The remaining spirit energy and the complex and confusing radiations from the scrap minerals can be of aid in the pet\u2019s growth. There is a high chance that the pets can mutate,\u201d The system explained.\u201cMutate?\u201dSu Ping was startled.Apart from evolution, with the difference in the living environment, there was a small chance that pets could mutate.As for mutation, it implied that the pet would become an entirely different species.Maybe it could become a new and more powerful species, or it could degenerate into a failed species.Some war zones with extremely harsh environments, filled with devastation and technological waste, were the most likely places to breed mutant beasts.Most of the mutant beasts would carry agents with unknown diseases, which would very likely cause plagues or form a large-scale virus attack.Such cases could be lethal to the general public. As such, in most cases, \u201cmutated pets\u201d were words that could instill panic.At the same time, in scientific pet studies, people never stopped inducing mutations in pets. Many famous ninth rank pets in the Federation had been the result of mutations by scientific methods. Those pets were proficient in battles; they had also been successfully bred as new species!\u201cAre the pets mutated in the slots good or bad?\u201d Su Ping consulted the system.The system gave a brief answer, \u201cHalf and half. It is advisable for the host to upgrade the nursing pens into elementary nursing pens, to avoid damaging the store\u2019s reputation.\u201dSu Ping curled his lips.Fortunately, he thought of asking this question.He already had a bad feeling when the system mentioned radiation of scrap minerals. The cheap buyer takes bad meat.\u201cGo ahead and upgrade it.\u201dWithout hesitation, Su Ping made the decision.First of all, after the upgrade, the rent would be 10 times higher and other benefits would ensue. Second, he couldn\u2019t afford to face the possibilities of failed mutations.Harming his customer\u2019s pets and having a fall-out with them would be detrimental to the store\u2019s reputation. The system was not giving him a free nursing pen. The system was planting a sinister bomb!Lucky for him, he had just made some quick cash. Other than that, the business hadn\u2019t been good in the past couple of days. Nothing had happened.-20 points of energy.Suddenly, a hazy white light glowed over the two aged stalagmite arrays. When the white light was dispersed, he found that the stalagmite arrays had a brand-new appearance. The arrays were practically the same; they used the same sharp stones but the color of each stalagmite was completely different from before.Previously, it was as if the slots had been built with rough rocks in dim and dreary colors. But then, the stalagmites were like ivories, full of life.\u201cNow we are talking.\u201dSu Ping was satisfied.His heart began to ache though, since he remembered that this elementary nursing pen would cost him one energy point for maintenance every day.It was burning a hole in his pocket.In a blink, less than 100 energy points remained from the original 315.\u201cI have to make the most of the time available to earn energy points. I still need to upgrade the Chaos Spirit Pool.\u201dSu Ping was filled with anticipation at the thought of the effects that a third rank Chaos Spirit Pool could bring. If he could breed a pet with a Beast King\u2019s bloodline, the mere action of displaying the pet in the store could attract a large group of customers!\u201cIs anyone in?\u201d someone was shouting from outside the store.Su Ping found the voice familiar. He rushed out from the pet room in the back.Two beautifully-dressed girls were standing by the door, looking around quite carefully.\u201cWhat?\u201dSu Ping immediately recognized one of the girls when he laid eyes on her. It was the girl that came for the Lightning Rat....\u201cIs the owner here?\u201d asked Su Yanying by the door. She looked into the store, confused.\u201cYingying, are you sure this is the place?\u201dLan Lele, who was wearing a gauzy skirt, had tagged along. After looking at such an obscure and disgraceful little store, Lan Lele found it hard to believe that this genius Lightning Rat had been trained here.\u201cThis is the place!\u201dSu Yanying was certain. \u201cThis place must have something to do with the changes in my Lightning Rat!\u201dShe gradually had a better understanding after the preliminary contests; there was indeed something way off about her Lightning Rat.After being visited and questioned by her teachers and the class advisor, she realized to a large extent how freakishly strong her Lightning Rat was!It could be regarded as a coincidence if the Lightning Rat only learned one advanced pet skill. But nobody would think this after seeing how the Lightning Rat could use two of such skills.She threw her teachers off the scent; after all, she wasn\u2019t really sure. And yet, she did know that this might have something to do with the pet store where she left her Lightning Rat for temporary boarding.Before that, the Lightning Rat had been quite ordinary and it had never come into contact with anything else before the stay at the pet store. With such analysis, she believed the only variable in the equation was the pet store!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She stepped forward right then, dragging her friend with her.\u201cHi, what can I do for you?\u201dSu Ping moved to the counter and his eyebrows were knitted together.His heart was in extreme pain as he thought about the mere 108 coins he received for that outstanding Lightning Rat.Su Yanying noticed that Su Ping\u2019s expression appeared to be unnatural. While she found it bizarre, she did not pry further. \u201cSir, do you remember the Lightning Rat I picked up?\u201d She threw out her question in a hasty manner.Rip.It was the sound of the scar in his heart being torn open.Su Ping curled his lips and his face darkened. \u201cWhat is wrong with it?\u201d\u201cThere is nothing wrong with it. I\u2019m only asking if you did anything to it.\u201d Su Yanying couldn\u2019t hold back from asking this question.\u201c...\u201d Su Ping remained silent for a long time before he said, \u201cWhat do you think I would do to a rat?\u201d\u201cWell...\u201dSu Yanying realized that her question was phrased oddly. Her cheeks blushed as she went on in a low voice, \u201cSir, that\u2019s not what I meant. I\u2019m only wondering if it was trained here.\u201d She uttered those words with prudence and respect.If the Lightning Rat had been trained there, then there had to be master trainers working in this place. Even battle pet warriors with titles would have to treat such master trainers with respect and politeness. Of course, she also had to do the same.\u201cOh?\u201dSu Ping was intrigued. He understood the intention of their visit, based on the information he heard from his sister Su Lingyue.This girl saw that little rat in action, so she returned to find out the reason for its growth.There was one thing, though.This matter involved the pet store\u2019s secret and the system, things that he could not expose.Su Ping made up a random answer, \u201cIf taking it for a walk can count as training, then yes, I did train it for a couple of days.\u201dSu Yanying did not see this coming. \u201cWalks?\u201d\u201cOf course I have to take it outside for a walk after a good meal,\u201d Su Ping said off the top of his head. He was about to be convinced by his own words.Su Yanying was losing patience with Su Ping playing with her. \u201cSir, I\u2019m being serious. Did you not train it at all?\u201d she asked in a hurry.Su Ping frowned a bit. She was persistent. \u201cWhat does it have to do with you if it was trained here or not? I can compensate you if you think there is something wrong with it, or you can return it and I will buy it. If you find it in good shape, then I will be okay if you want to give me more money. Other than that, please leave if you have nothing else to do here. Don\u2019t interrupt my business.\u201dSu Yanying never expected that the store owner would tell them to leave so directly. She recovered from her shock soon and hurried to explain, \u201cSir, this is not what I\u2019m saying. I am merely seeking confirmation. If you have trained it for me, please let me know, all right?\u201dSu Ping raised his eyebrows. \u201cIf so, then yes. Are you happy now?\u201dSu Yanying found it hard to find words.\u201cHey you, we\u2019re not here to look for trouble. If you trained Lightning Rat, then tell us. We\u2019re not going to hurt you,\u201d Lan Lele said, unsatisfied by Su Ping\u2019s attitude.Su Ping kept a straight face. \u201cI already said it. I trained the Lightning Rat. But if you want to know the process and methods, then I will have to say sorry.\u201dSu Yanying finally found the root of their misunderstanding. She shook her head at once. \u201cSir, I have no desire to look into the methods and process of your training. I\u2019m just very grateful to you for training my pet.\u201d\u201cOh, I see...\u201d Su Ping put away his cold face and said, \u201cIf you want to say thank you, then give me some more money.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSu Yanying was stunned.Money?As far as she could tell, a person able to train the Lightning Rat to such a degree had to be a hermit who would not care about such worldly items.\u201cYou don\u2019t have money?\u201d Su Ping\u2019s eyebrows were knitted together. Coldness returned to his face again.Looking at how Su Ping changed his face, Su Yanying had the feeling that she had made a mistake since the very beginning. Was her Lightning Rat trained elsewhere?\u201cI finally understand what it means when people say that before gold, even kings take off their hats!\u201dLan Lele couldn\u2019t help but complain about Su Ping\u2019s reaction. She grabbed Su Yanying\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYingying, you must have made a mistake. There\u2019s no way that your Lightning Rat was trained in such a place. That little thing had an epiphany or something else happened. Let\u2019s go back and discuss it.\u201dSu Yanying came back to her senses and shook her head. \u201cSince the owner has admitted that there was some training, I believe the change happened here. Anyways, I must thank the owner for taking care of the Lightning Rat.\u201dWith that said, Su Yanying noticed that Su Ping\u2019s expression was the same as before and was unmoved by her words. She realized something. She took out her phone and transferred one thousand. \u201cSir, this is a thank you.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t expect that the girl would pay the extra money, and she was quite generous at that. After a moment of surprise, he nodded and said, \u201cGood, good. I would appreciate it if you can give me more.\u201dSu Yanying did not know how to respond to that. Of course, she wasn\u2019t going to give him more money.\u201cWhat kind of person is he?\u201d Lan Lele almost burst into flames after hearing Su Ping\u2019s reply. At that moment, she just caught a glimpse of the many pet foods behind the counter. Her eyes were wide open in astonishment. \u201c300 for a plant? Such ridiculous pricing!\u201dShe grabbed Su Yanying\u2019s arm at once. \u201cLet\u2019s go, this is not a legitimate store. He\u2019s ripping us off!\u201dAlerted by her cries, Su Yanying became dazed for a second. Then, she cast a look at the pet food behind Su Ping. She, as well, was startled by what she saw.Still, she remained on the spot. Lan Lele failed to drag her away.A moment later, she came back to her senses. She took a look at Su Ping who was still composed. There was no trace of shame in him.Su Ping could tell from Su Yanying\u2019s looks that she was deliberating. After a moment of hesitation, Su Yanying asked, \u201cSir, can I leave a few more pets here? Is that okay?\u201dNaturally, Su Ping was glad when there was business. \u201cYes, of course. For how long?\u201d He nodded at once.\u201cThree days.\u201d Su Yanying replied after some thought.Su Ping nodded slightly. He took out an old fashioned calculator and pushed the buttons rapidly. \u201cFor three days, that is three by 24. Well, each pet will cost you 7200 coins. How many do you want to leave here?\u201d\u201cThree pets...\u201d Halfway through her sentence, Su Yanying glared at Su Ping in utter astonishment. \u201cHow, how much is that?\u201d\u201cIs there something wrong with my ears?\u201d By her side, Lan Lele was perplexed as well.\u201cOne pet, 7200 coins.\u201d Su Ping raised his eyebrows when he saw how the two girls reacted.\u201c7200 coins?\u201d Su Yanying repeated the numbers. She was still questioning the possibility of her hearing acting up. \u201c7200 coins for one pet? Sir, I just want to leave them in your care for three days only!\u201dSu Ping nodded. \u201cI know. This is the price for a three-day stay. The charge is 100 per hour. So, the result comes as 7200 for three days, no more, no less.\u201d\u201cOne hundred per hour?\u201d Lan Lele sized Su Ping up and down as if he were a monster.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s clean but the storefront is narrow, small and worn-out. Its location is completely out of the way. The monthly rent might not even go beyond 3000. How could this store compare with the famous flagship stores?\u201dLan Lele believed that this owner had decided either to not do business, or to make one deal happen and then close down for years. He was trying to milk money from them!\u201cWishful thinking!\u201d\u201cYingying, let\u2019s go. This owner is a dirty profiteer. A master able to train this Lightning Rat is surely someone who would never have anything to do with him!\u201d Lan Lele glared at Su Ping, her mouth virtually foaming. She didn\u2019t hesitate to urge Su Yanying to leave.But Su Yanying did otherwise. She asked Su Ping, puzzled, \u201cSir, the service was not this expensive the last time I came here.\u201d\u201cThe care system has been ungraded. Naturally, the price has to go up,\u201d Su Ping said, calmly.\u201cThe care system has been upgraded?\u201d Su Yanying stood stunned for a moment. Then, a glow came to her eyes as she said, gladly, \u201cThe pet boarding treatment is better than before? Doesn\u2019t this mean that the pet can learn more advanced pet skills?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d Su Ping said without thinking.\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Yanying\u2019s face was covered in question marks.\u201cI just trained that little guy for some time while I was at it. Its change was a complete surprise.\u201d Su Ping kept a straight face. \u201cNow, of course, I no longer have such luxury of free time. If you want to leave your pets for boarding, then that is it. No training is included.\u201dSu Yanying understood. \u201cSir, you finally admitted it. It is you that helped train my Lightning Rat!\u201d she said, giggling.\u201cI did admit it before,\u201d Su Ping pointed it out.\u201cThis is not the same.\u201d Su Yanying gloated. Staying was the right decision. She hurried to the next question, \u201cWell, sir, what benefits can come with the current pet boarding?\u201dShe believed that there had to be some reasons to account for the high price.Su Ping remained neither hostile nor friendly. \u201cOnly an improvement on the pet\u2019s constitution and power of understanding. If the pet itself is quite qualified, then there is a low chance of evolution but nothing else. If you want the pets to learn pet skills from this foster care, you will only be disappointed.\u201dHe was telling the truth. After all, the benefits that came with the nursing pens alone would be worthy enough for the price charged. If he had to throw in the training, he would be losing money as it was.Su Yanying said oh. She was let down but not so upset.After all, she managed to confirm that her Lightning Rat had received training in this very store. This fact alone was enough to make her happy. At least, she had found the origin of the change in her pet, saving her from that muddle-headed situation.\u201cOnly an improvement in its power of understanding and constitution?\u201d Lan Lele gazed at Su Ping skeptically.While Su Ping had admitted that the Lightning Rat\u2019s change was related to this store, she still found it hard to believe. Once Su Ping revealed the benefits of the pet boarding service, her skepticism was increasing even more.Those words were practically used in all the pet stores\u2019 advertisements!At the end of the day, there was something.Power of understanding and constitution could not be measured or tested, unless the scope of improvement was large. Otherwise, who could tell if the pet\u2019s constitution and power of understanding had been enhanced or not?\u201cSir, can I ask you to train my pets for me again?\u201d Su Yanying looked at Su Ping with anticipation. As for the pet boarding, she wasn\u2019t that interested after Su Ping had made the introduction.Usually, people would only leave their pets at a boarding service when they had too many pets to take care of. At the moment, she was free and she could feed them herself; she could also train their battle skills.\u201cTrain them?\u201dSu Ping was about to refuse when he heard the system\u2019s voice.\u201cDetecting customers in need of pet training. [Pet Training] service has become available in advance.\u201d\u201cThe host can accept orders according to the price set for pet training services.\u201dFollowing the prompt message was a price list, like a menu, with the charge related to different levels of training services.For pets from the first to the third rank, the training fee was 10,000 coins.For pets from the fourth to the sixth rank, the training fee was 100,000 coins.For pets from the seventh to the ninth rank, the training fee was a million coins.For beast kings... the training fee was 10 million!The items for pets from the fourth rank and above were greyed out, meaning that Su Ping could not accept such orders. He could only train low-rank pets from the first to the third rank for the moment.\u201cThe condition for unlocking the next training tier is to train a low-rank pet with an aptitude rated as above average.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t know what to say when he saw the unlocking requirement. This was harder than making a million coins. That being said, this unlocking requirement fell within the scope of his main quest. That was to say, when he finished the main quest, he could unlock the second-class training service while he was at it!\u201cSir?\u201dSu Yanying called him when she noticed his mind was elsewhere.Su Ping came back to his senses and nodded to her. \u201cTraining, right? Currently, the store only accepts low rank pets from the first to the third rank and the training fee is 10,000 for one session.\u201d\u201cTen thousand?\u201dSu Yanjing did the math. The price was a bit high but it seemed much normal than the nursing pen rate. After all, the training service in itself was the highest charging service of them all. There was no upper limit established!As to whether the money would be well spent, she would have to see the effect after the training.With the precedent of the Lightning Rat, Su Yanying had faith in this store. Even an inferior pet like the Lightning Rat, if a second Lightning Rat could not be trained, it would be more than worthwhile!\u201cThen I will have the Lightning Rat trained again.\u201d Su Yanjing made a decision after some consideration.Lan Lele was surprised by this. \u201cYingying, you want to train that little guy again? It is excellent as it is. I don\u2019t think it can progress any further with more training. Besides, the second round of matches will start in a few days. This little guy is your ace card now. You will be screwed if the training goes wrong.\u201dSu Yanying shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t plan on sending out the Lightning Rat for the second round of matches. It has already outdone itself. For the second round, the players are decided by lucky draws. My opponent will make the best of these days to find ways to target my Lightning Rat. To send it out there again won\u2019t be of much use. Besides, my other pets will have recovered by then. They are more than enough to get me past the second round!\u201d\u201cBut...\u201d For a time, Lan Lele was at a loss for words. She just felt uneasy.Su Ping cast a glance to Lan Lele and then asked the girl in front of him, \u201cHave you decided?\u201dSu Yanying nodded and said resolutely, \u201cThe Lightning Rat!\u201d\u201cSure. Pay the charge first.\u201d Su Ping nodded.The system suddenly jumped out with the prompt message. \u201cThe host has triggered a side quest: receive a pet training order. Collect or not?\u201dSu Ping was taken aback. This quest was a surprise. Immediately, he collected it in his mind.\u201cSuccessful!\u201d\u201cQuest introduction: compete the first pet training order perfectly and get a good review from the customer.\u201d\u201cQuest requirement: any service provided by the store must be the best of the best! The host must train the pet and double the original combat strength data!\u201d\u201cTraining time limit: the customer has no such requirement.\u201d\u201cCompleted quest reward: three elementary \u2018Force Pellets\u2019.\u201dSu Ping was speechless once he read the requirements.To double the pet\u2019s combat strength?The Lightning Rat\u2019s combat strength was rated 3.6 already. To double it, the combat strength would have to be 7.2, right?That would be a pet that could compare to a seventh ranker!Seventh rank pets were advanced pets and they were few and far between. The ones that could control advanced pets were advanced battle pet warriors who were considered outstanding among pioneering rangers.Presently, was he supposed to train a low-rank Lightning Rat to that degree?...62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Not For SalePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26: Not For SaleTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations\u201cHmm. Interesting.\u201dThere were some things Su Ping was eager to blurt out.At the same time, he noticed the reward for this quest. He asked in his mind, \u201cWhat is this \u2018Force Pellet\u2019?\u201d\u201cA kind of elementary pellet that battle pet warriors should take. They are only effective to battle pet warriors of the third rank and below and can help cultivate astral power,\u201d the system stated.Su Ping raised his eyebrows. The cultivation of astral power was a nice bonus.Anyways, he had accepted the mission so he had to finish it.He turned his attention to the matter at hand. Su Ping looked at the two girls and remembered something from their conversation. Su Ping asked, \u201cApart from the \u2018training\u2019 service, do you need boarding services? If your pets have suffered minor injuries, healing can be accelerated if you put them in our boarding service.\u201dThis came as a surprise for Su Yanying. \u201cSir, you can cure wounds here?\u201d\u201cOnly minor wounds,\u201d Su Ping stressed.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so? If the boarding service includes healing, then it is worthwhile.\u201dSu Yanying was interested. Although the healers she invited estimated that her pets would recover on the very first day of the second round of matches, their estimation might have been wrong. It would be troublesome if anything were to go amiss.On the other hand, if she were to hire another healer, that would cost her a fortune ranging in the tens of thousands.Su Ping smiled.He didn\u2019t mention this because the small treatment effects that came with the nursing pen were not worth mentioning compared to the benefit of the constitution and power of understanding enhancement. He had not realized that this could be a selling point.\u201cBut, I don\u2019t think I have so much money with me...\u201d Su Yanying was about to place the order when she remembered she didn\u2019t have much money left after paying for the Lightning Rat\u2019s training fee.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I will lend you some.\u201d Lan Lele took out her purse. Might as well; she could never stop this good friend of hers. She decided to chip in this bet.She believed that the store would not be bold enough to fleece them without providing any service in return. If such were the case, she wasn\u2019t a person to be messed with.Su Ping rolled his eyes grumpily as he sensed the anger and hostility coming from this girl. He felt distressed since he had to pay one energy point every day for maintenance. Otherwise, he would not be in the mood to solicit business.He was the only one who really knew about the excellent quality of the products and services provided by the system. He was still sustaining losses with those prices. People would have to wait in line for the pet boarding service after building up a name for the store!\u201cMy good Lele, I will pay you back as soon as I save enough money!\u201d Su Yanying offered a broad and sincere smile.Lan Lele hurried her, \u201cAlright now. Pick your pets. We have to go back early.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dSu Yanying did not waste time. The astral power that was in light blue converged at her fingertips. She pointed her finger to a space on the side and a purple figure jumped out from the contract space and landed on the ground, looking over. It was none other than the Lightning Rat.The Lightning Rat blinked as it found itself in this familiar place. It looked up and saw that smiling human face behind the counter.At this moment, some clips of unforgettable memories surged over.\u201cHiss!\u201dThe Lightning Rat was showing its teeth, as though confronted by a formidable enemy. Electric arcs were flashing all over its body.Su Yanjing was surprised by this fit of fear and the feeling of unrest coming from the Lightning Rat. Puzzled, she tried to comfort it at once.Su Ping raised his eyebrows. The little thing was reacting very strongly; that time must have been unforgettable.A moment later, the Lightning Rat finally calmed down with Su Yanying\u2019s comfort. That being said, the Lightning Rat was still curled up by her feet, on high alert.\u201cCome on out, Fallen Phoenix,\u201d Su Yanying called out another pet.A blazing flame emerged out of thin air. A firebird that was the size of half a human came into being, exuding heat without restraint as it was completely bathed in fire.\u201cIs this a Fallen Phoenix, a pet with an advanced bloodline?\u201dSu Ping found this interesting. This was a precious bird but presently, it was only at the upper position of the third rank, with an aptitude rated as poor and combat strength of 4.2. This bird could fight those at a higher rank if it exerted great efforts.The other one was an Ugly Stone Beast which looked like an oddly shaped rock. This pet was also of an intermediate bloodline, currently at the lower position of the fourth rank with a combat strength of 4.3 and an aptitude rated as poor.\u201cThese are the three.\u201d Su Yanying didn\u2019t summon any more pets.The three pets stood inside the store and made the already small storefront feel even more crowded.Su Ping told himself that once he made enough money, the first thing would be to upgrade the size of the store. In the future, when people came to leave their advanced pets, every single one of them would be large; some would be a dozen meters tall, others even dozens of meters tall. He was afraid that this store would not be big enough to hold them.\u201cThree pets. A three-day stay for them would be 21,600.\u201d Su Ping did the calculation quickly.\u201cSir, can you round it up and forget about the small change?\u201d Lan Lele said before she paid.Su Ping answered coldly, \u201cNo discounts.\u201d\u201cI knew it.\u201d Lan Lele pouted and snorted. She wired the money quickly.After the money entered his account, Su Ping gave them the receipt and asked, \u201cDo you need anything else?\u201d\u201cNo, nothing else.\u201d Su Yanying had no more money and she couldn\u2019t ask her friend to pay more for her.Lan Lele looked around and asked, baffled, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a pet store? Why don\u2019t I see any pets for sale?\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t any pets for sale at the moment,\u201d Su Ping said.\u201cA pet store that doesn\u2019t sell pets?\u201d Lan Lele\u2019s face wore a funny look.Su Yanying found this answer intriguing as well. This entire store reeked of mystery.\u201cAlright. We have concluded our business. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Lan Lele did not linger. She was ready to leave at once.Su Yanying comforted her pets for a bit, unwilling to be parted from them. Before she left, she stressed, \u201cSir, please take good care of them for me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Su Ping\u2019s reply was in such a mild tone that it didn\u2019t seem convincing at all.Su Yanying opened her mouth, trying to say something else. Yet, after thinking that three days would zip right by, she held down that urge. She turned around and stepped away.After they left, Su Ping took the pets to the pet room in the back. Lucky for him, the pet room door was wide enough; it was a sliding door with a 4 meter clearance, large enough for the large Fanged Tiger to go through.\u201cSystem, I need to buy another elementary nursing pen,\u201d Su Ping said to the system.\u201cSure,\u201d The system agreed.-10 energy points.Space twisted for a while in an empty place in the pet room; a moment after, an elementary nursing pen came out from nowhere.Su Ping had become inured to the unusual powers of the system. Taking a look at the size of the nursing pen, he suddenly began to wonder if the large Stone Beast could fit in such a small space.\u201cThe host doesn\u2019t have to worry. The space inside the nursing pens are independent from ours. Pets of all sizes can fit in,\u201d the system explained.Su Ping was relieved. Fortunately, the system was freakishly outstanding.He carried out the little skeleton and the Managarm that were sleeping in the two old nursing pens and made the three pets walk into the vacant ones. The three pets shrank down as they stepped into the nursing pens. The half-a-human sized Fallen Phoenix looked like a fiery red canary.As for that Fanged Tiger with a length of six to seven meters long, it shrank down to the size of a regular dog, only the tiger spots were still visible.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Both were bewildered after noticing that their spots had been taken.Su Ping looked at the Managarm. This was a pet left in the boarding service that would end the next day. By then, its master would come to pick it up.Since that customer paid for the regular boarding service, the Managarm would have to step away from the nursing pen.The system suddenly commented with a severe tone, \u201cAll the pets left in your care must stay in nursing pens and cannot be left outside. The host must purchase another nursing pen for the Managarm at once.\u201dSu Ping was taken aback. \u201cBut that person only paid for the regular service back then.\u201d\u201cHow can an owner of a pet store have zero compassion for pets?\u201d\u201c...If you\u2019re so compassionate, why don\u2019t you give me some for free?\u201d\u201c...Warning! Profanity alert.\u201d\u201cWhen did I swear, I #\u00a5...\u201d\u201c...Warning! Second profanity alert.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSu Ping cooled himself down in an instant.Inhale, and exhale...Su Ping had gotten over the fact that he was going to spend money. It was merely 10 energy points. Given his savings, he could afford it. Besides, the Managarm was going to be picked up the next day. He would have to add more nursing pens sooner or later.\u201cI\u2019ll just pretend that I paid the one energy point maintenance fee out of my pocket today.\u201dSu Ping heaved a sigh. He could only make about a hundred coins with the boarding of this Managarm. At the moment, it would practically be as if he were taking care of it for free for another person.Fortunately, this would never happen again.He chose to buy the nursing pen; soon enough, another one appeared out of thin air.\u201cGo on.\u201d Su Ping let the drooling Managarm enter the pen.The Little Skeleton: \u201c??\u201dSu Ping crouched down and patted the Little Skeleton\u2019s head who was standing on the side, baffled. He accidentally used too much strength and snapped its head off.Su Ping blushed with embarrassment as he quickly placed its little head back on.He was relieved after seeing that the bones were set properly. The Little Skeleton was his pet and it didn\u2019t have to stay in a nursing pen. On this front, the system did not have any requirements.\u201cI will buy one for you later, when I get extra energy points,\u201d Su Ping said to the Little Skeleton.Since the Little Skeleton was his, he could not let it suffer. It also had to enjoy comfort.The Little Skeleton seemed to be able to understand him. It nodded clumsily.Su Ping smiled at it and went back to the lounge. He took a look at his energy points; he made over 300 that day, and adding the hundred and something left from before, he had a bit over 400 energy points, quite the wealth.\u201cUpgrade the Chaos Spirit Pool,\u201d Su Ping said.A hundred points were deducted at once.At the same time, the Spirit Pool that used to look like a dried well began to give out a radiating glow around its edge. Some strange lines appeared on the edge by the time the glow vanished. They looked like ancient runes.\u201cPool upgraded to the second rank.\u201dSu Ping was pleased. One part per ten million of chaos aura could be imported into the second rank Spirit Pool; there was a chance that a pet of advanced Bloodline could be bred!After all, every pet with an advanced bloodline could be sold on the market for hundreds of thousands at the very least, and the best ones would be worth tens of millions and even hundreds of millions!Even though the store could not sell pets at the moment, Su Ping thought he could breed one and rent it. That would be a large source of income as well!\u201cInitiate breeding?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOne hundred energy points for breeding. Please confirm.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t realize that the expense for breeding was ten times higher after the Spirit Pool was upgraded. Being the case, he only had enough energy points for three rounds of breeding!After a moment of hesitation, Su Ping made up his mind and confirmed.\u201cActivating Chaos Spirit Pool...\u201dThe dry-looking Spirit Pool gleamed slightly, and there seemed to be starlight gathering at the bottom.A moment later, the Spirit Pool returned to its original state. Nothing happened.A message appeared above the Spirit Pool. \u201cBreeding failed.\u201dSu Ping was dumbfounded.\u201cFailed?\u201cThe breeding failed?\u201d\u201cWhen chaos aura forms life, there is a small chance that the process will fail,\u201d the system explained.Su Ping received a nasty shock. That was to say, he had wasted one hundred energy points for nothing, right?Words popped out above the Spirit Pool again. \u201cContinue Breeding?\u201dSu Ping came back to his senses. His eyes reddened. Those were one hundred energy points, converted from ten thousand coins, and all of it was gone in a puff!\u201cTry again!\u201d Su Ping bit his teeth, making a determined effort.After the energy was injected, the Chaos Spirit Pool once again began to gleam. Su Ping kept his eyes wide open and checked when the light was about to dim down.All he saw was an egg in milk-white color floating above the Spirit Pool quietly.\u201c!!\u201dSu Ping was shocked. An egg? The pool could generate an egg?His identification spell failed in the egg as well. He could not tell what was in it.\u201cPlease collect.\u201dWhile still confused, Su Ping picked up this large egg which felt warm. All of a sudden, he thought of fried eggs. He was getting hungry.\u201cWhat kind of egg is this? How do I hatch it?\u201d Su Ping asked the system.\u201cThe host has to deal with it in person,\u201d the system passed the buck.Su Ping curled his lips. He could identify pets but to identify an egg... Was he supposed to pay himself and ask an expert from the Pet Identification Institution to tell him?On second thought, Su Ping dismissed the idea. He didn\u2019t have that much money to spare. To ask an expert to identify it would cost a fortune. He thought he might just as well search the internet for eggs of different pets. Maybe he could solve the mystery.He placed the egg on the single bed he had put here for napping at noon when he was at the store. He set the egg by the pillow and covered it with the quilt to keep it warm.Having done this, Su Ping took a look at the Chaos Spirit Pool. He decided to stop trying after hesitating for a moment.He only had a bit over a hundred energy points left.Coming up next, he had to finish the main quest, to open up cultivation planes and buy deaths. Those were all places that he had to invest energy points. He had to reach a sort of balance in the savings.Speaking of the training quest, Su Ping remembered that the system had granted him free access to any cultivation plane for once and unlimited times of deaths when he was defending the name of the store!\u201cI can use this chance to finish my main quest and the training quest.\u201dSu Ping was gloating as he left the lounge. The Lightning Rat was hiding behind the counter. He waved to the Lightning Rat while wearing an ear-to-ear grin. \u201cHere, come on. Come over here.\u201dThe Lightning Rat was frizzly from fear. It was even using the \u201cThunder Cloak\u201d skill. Its fur was like steel needles with electric charges. The Lightning Rat gave Su Ping a fierce look, turning quite hostile.Somehow the Little Skeleton had sensed the hostile intention from the Lightning Rat. All of a sudden, the Little Skeleton stumbled over to Su Ping\u2019s front.The Little Skeleton clenched its fist like a fighter in defense. It looked at the Lightning Rat with its hollow eyes; there was a thickening blood-red color in those dark, empty spaces.Su Ping was surprised. He never thought the little thing would come forward to protect him.He froze when he felt the tension, anxiety, and a bit of fierceness in the Little Skeleton\u2019s consciousness.After falling into silence for a while, Su Ping slowly picked up the Little Skeleton, then he walked to the door and pulled the shutter door down.The light in the store dimmed instantly.Su Ping went back to the counter and pulled up the window of the cultivation plane.\u201cSystem, can I bring both pets into the same cultivation plane?\u201d Su Ping asked.\u201cThe host can only bring pets with contracts built into the cultivation plane. If the host wants to take the customer\u2019s pets for training, please buy a temporary contract,\u201d the system replied.\u201cTemporary contract?\u201dThe interface of the shop popped out immediately. The slot for the \u201cAwakening Potion\u201d was gone and in its place was a golden scroll that had the words \u201cTemporary Contract\u201d written on it, with a price of ten energy points.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At this rate...\u201d Su Ping\u2019s mouth twitched. Was he being exploited?He felt lucky that he didn\u2019t go on with the breeding and kept the last hundred or so energy points. Otherwise, he would be unable to afford this trip.\u201cWill the temporary contract exert an influence on the pet\u2019s real master when I use it?\u201d While he could anticipate the answer to his question, Su Ping thought he\u2019d better ask just to be safe.\u201cThe temporary contract will be overlaid on the astral power contract, and will not affect the pet master\u2019s contract, nor will it be noticed,\u201d the system answered indifferently.\u201cGood.\u201dSu Ping chose to buy it when all concerns were cleared up.When the energy was deducted, Su Ping saw a golden scroll appearing out of nowhere in the storage space floating on his sea of awareness.After focusing his mind, the golden scroll fell into his hand.The scroll used for the temporary contract was very soft, and Su Ping felt as if he were holding a cloud of mist. There was nothing rough on the paper.\u201cHow does this thing work?\u201d Su Ping tossed and turned it.\u201cAdd a drop of blood from the person who will establish the contract and then stick it to the pet that is going to enter the contract,\u201d the system answered.Su Ping understood. He turned around and looked at the Lightning Rat who was hiding in the shades; he smiled, presumably in a way that would make him look harmless. \u201cCome on, good boy.\u201dThe Lightning Rat freaked out at once. That smile was so strange that it had to be from a nightmare.Whoosh!The Lightning Rat dashed away instantly into the pet room in the back.Su Ping froze for a moment and immediately chased after the Lightning Rat.The pet room had been cleaned and cleared out by the system, so the Lightning Rat\u2019s hiding place was visible. The Lightning Rat was hiding next to the nursing pen of the Fanged Tiger. The former\u2019s fur was covered with electricity as it menacingly showed its teeth at Su Ping.Su Ping thought that the Lighting Rat was getting serious as he saw the hostility in its eyes.This little thing was not an average Lightning Rat and Su Ping had no powerful battle pets to deal with it.\u201cWas that experience so horrifying...?\u201d Su Ping mumbled to himself. He frowned and looked at the Lightning Rat for a while. The latter didn\u2019t seem to loosen up for one bit. Maybe his presence would only make the Lightning Rat more nervous because he would be a reminder of that bitter memory.After some thought, Su Ping closed the door and went back to the counter to have a look.He saw a bottle of pet food: Thunder Particles.They were taken from a plant that was like an ear of wheat, and there were dozens of them, each sold at more than fifty coins.\u201cThe Thunder Particles are rich in thunder force and will explode in fire. Thunder Particles are food loved by pets of the thunder family...\u201d Su Ping smiled a light smile and took out one Thunder Particle. Then, he bit his finger and smeared the blood on a corner of the contract.Then, he went back to the betting room and opened the door slowly, only to see the Lightning Rat who was sprawled on the ground. It stood up at once and glared at him, highly alerted.Su Ping didn\u2019t go and disturb the Lighting Rat. He just placed the contract down on the ground by the door slowly and also placed the Thunder Particle in the middle of the contract.Having done this, he closed the door. After that, he would have to wait.While he waited, he didn\u2019t plan on idling away. He opened the shutter door open and went back to business.However, maybe because his store was too out of place, not a single customer came.Bored, Su Ping began to search for the egg on the internet. He browsed through some major websites of pets but failed to find an egg that was the same. He did find a couple of similar ones, though.\u201cSh*t, I cannot look at this section of advanced pets without signing up for a membership?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m supposed to pay?\u201dSu Ping closed the page in indignation.He then switched to other smaller websites. However, not long afterward, the computer froze and crashed.\u201cWas I hit by a virus?\u201d Su Ping was speechless. He unplugged the cable quickly, with the intent to restart the computer.At the moment, he felt that outside of his consciousness came a line that was connected to him. At the same time, another consciousness carried over some happy emotions.\u201cDid it eat the food?\u201dSu Ping was surprised for a moment. The second consciousness came from the Lightning Rat in the pet room. From the line of consciousness, Su Ping could sense the Lightning Rat\u2019s current location. If they were too far away from each other, the line would be cut off and he would no longer sense the Lightning Rat\u2019s presence.Su Ping forgot about the computer\u2019s glitch and went to the pet room. He opened the door and saw the Lightning Rat eating the Thunder Particle it held with both front paws.The sudden appearance of Su Ping shocked the Lightning Rat who went back to its meal only after throwing a look at him.With the power of contract, while the Lightning Rat still remembered that mean human being, the familiar feeling that came from the person made it impossible for the Lightning Rat to turn hostile.\u201cLittle guy, time to go.\u201dSu Ping grinned. He picked up this little guy by its neck and went back to the counter. He placed the Lightning Rat on the counter along with the little skeleton and then went to close the shutter door.\u201cCultivation window,\u201d Su Ping summoned the function with a thought after he returned to the counter.The cultivation planes window emerged in front of him with ghost-like glows, displaying many cultivation planes listed out for him to choose from.\u201cThe best, the most expensive!\u201d Su Ping moved to the column of \u201ctop\u201d cultivation planes directly. The number of cultivation planes in this column was small in number but all of them were the best!The lowest entry charge was 1000 energy points and the most expensive one would cost 10,000 energy points!\u201cCompared to this, the Thunder Cloud Realm would appear insignificant...\u201dSu Ping browsed the cultivation planes. There was a certain \u201cArchean Divinity\u201d that would cost 9000 energy points.A certain \u201cRealm of Asura\u201d would cost 3000 energy points.There was another \u201cMedieval Land\u201d that needed 5000 energy points.\u201cTut-tut...\u201dJust by looking at the names of the cultivation planes, Su Ping could tell that those were amazing places. In particular, there was this Archean Divinity. It was the Divinity! Was it the place where deities lived?Su Ping\u2019s mind had been opened after he witnessed the marvels of the Thunder Cloud Realm. He would believe it if someone were to tell him that there were deities in the world.\u201cThe length of stay in all of the top-level cultivation planes is for one day. If the length of stay surpasses a day, then either the host will be forcefully logged out, or he would have double the energy points deducted. If the length of stay is over two days, then three times the energy points will be deducted...\u201dSu Ping read the introductions. He had an idea. \u201cYou gave me a chance to visit any cultivation plane for five days. That can be used in those top-level cultivation planes, right?\u201d He asked the system.A moment of silence later, he heard the system\u2019s gloomy voice, \u201cYes.\u201dSu Ping couldn\u2019t help but snap his finger. He was about to jump up in excitement.If he were to enter a cultivation plane like the \u201cArchean Divinity,\u201d he would have to spend forty to fifty thousand energy points for five days!But thanks to his reward, it would be free!\u201cIt is incredible to be able to stay in any top-level cultivation plane for five days with no strings attached!\u201dSu Ping was rejoicing with wild excitement. This reward was awesome!It took him a long while to calm down but he was still worked up.Wasn\u2019t it a sure thing that he could finish the main quest if he stayed in any top-level cultivation plane for five days?If he couldn\u2019t finish the quest with such favorable conditions, then he would have to say that the main quest was not reasonable!\u201cIt is a pity that given my current abilities, the harvest is limited when I go to such a top-level cultivation plane. The ticket\u2019s value cannot be put into full play.\u201dSu Ping felt sorry. He could only walk along the edge in such a top-level cultivation plane. Any being from such a plane could easily give him a bashing.\u201cThat being said, this is a chance that comes once in a blue moon. I must enjoy my days there, while I pick up some pet food along the way!\u201dSu Ping was quite satisfied with the reward this time. He wondered if he should call more people over to make trouble, so that more ad hoc quests like this could be triggered. On the other hand, he believed that the system would not let him exploit an advantage. Of course, that was part of a story to be told later.Su Ping scrolled down the list several times. Taking the little skeleton into consideration, he soon selected a cultivation plane\u2014Chaotic Realm of the Undead!The energy points required to enter this cultivation plane were the same as with the \u201cArchean Divinity,\u201d at 9000 points!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He felt his body and his soul separate.When he regained consciousness, he heard the familiar voice of the system.\u201cHost has established connection with the \u2018Chaotic Realm of the Undead\u2019.\u201d\u201cLength of connection, five days...\u201d\u201cUnlimited number of deaths are granted during this connection...\u201d\u201cPlease head out on your own...\u201dSu Ping came back to his senses. As he opened his eyes, a crimson view leaped into his sight.Three massive scarlet moons were hanging in the sky, turning the dark cosmic vault into a brilliant red. Looking from where he was standing, he could faintly see the surface of the crimson moons. There seemed to be streaks of darkness that appeared to be tiny flying insects.Yet, considering the actual distance between him and the moons, he could only imagine how horribly large the actual size of those tiny dark streaks were!\u201cWoo...\u201dHe sensed some fear and heard a plaintive whine. Su Ping looked down. The Lightning Rat was curled up by his foot, shivering in fear and looking around nervously.Su Ping began to check the surroundings as well. His heart almost stopped with just a quick look.What a hellish view this was!The strange trees were like human limbs, twisted strangely. The grey withered grass that could be found across the land were wiggling willfully as if they contained a strong vitality!He was standing at the edge of a desolate, dead wood, where it seemed to have rained, and in front of him were puddles of water with strange worms, like maggots, swimming in them, and a lot of remains and bones lay scattered in the grass by the side of the road.As far as his sight could reach, this was a world where no life could be seen.The red sky and the dark world both reeked of death and desperation.While Su Ping was still in a daze, all of a sudden, he felt both the Little Skeleton and the Lightning Rat become alerted. Compared to the Little Skeleton, there was an addition of fear in the consciousness of the Lightning Rat.Su Ping looked over. He saw that two human-shaped figures were loafing over from the sparse woods.As they came closer, Su Ping could distinguish that the two figures were two skeletons that were about three meters tall. Stooping, they walked with difficulty. It was more like that they were wiggling.Su Ping\u2019s heart pumped faster. Remembering that he had the benefit of unlimited deaths, his confidence was boosted. He gave out the attack command to the two little guys at once.Crack, crack.Upon receiving the order, the Little Skeleton staggered over, as if death was of no consequence.On the other hand, the Lightning Rat was resisting. It was still crouching by Su Ping\u2019s feet. The Lightning Rat knew that this person was despicable but in this strange environment, the human was the only being that it could rely on.\u201cThis timid?\u201dSu Ping was surprised. He was not afraid because he knew he would not die but this little thing had no such knowledge. It was only natural that the Lightning Rat would be scared.This was a problem.Soon, Su Ping remembered the battle pet warrior skill book he had picked up. He clapped his hands. Why did he forget about that?He thought of it and that skill book fell into his hands from his storage space.Killing intent!Two sharply drawn words were on the cover of this skill book.Su Ping opened the book to study it without hesitation.When he opened the book, the skill book transformed into golden sparkles that merged into his body. The next second, Su Ping felt a large amount of information swarming out. When he sorted out the information, he realized that he had mastered the skill.\u201cKilling intent!\u201dSu Ping cast the skill on the Lightning Rat at once.It was as if some faint substance flowed into the Lightning Rat through the bonds of the contract.The next moment, the previously jittery Lightning Rat was suddenly filled with a thirst for blood and violence. Its eyes were red and it showed its sharp teeth. With tremendous force, the Lightning Rat dashed toward the two human-shaped skeletons.When the Lightning Rat dashed out, Su Ping felt mentally exhausted, as if his mind had expended vast amounts of energy.At the moment, the Lightning Rat had run past the Little Skeleton and arrived near the two human-shaped skeletons at the speed of lightning. The first move Lightning Rat resorted to was the strongest of all, Thunder Slash!Lightning hovered above its head violently and in an instant, it was compressed into a sword of lightning. The sword moved toward one of the human-shaped skeletons.The two human-shaped skeletons were wiggling slowly but the moment that the Lightning Rat hopped up to attack, the two skeletons came to their senses. Two streaks of red light shot out from their hollowed eye sockets. The next second, they swung their bodies violently and their sickle-like hands landed heavily on the thunder blade above the Lightning Rat\u2019s head.With a bang, the Lightning Rat was repelled.That human-shaped skeleton\u2019s arm was smoking and burning but the injury was minor. It was as if the skeleton could feel pain. The skeleton howled and ran to the Lightning Rat wildly.Whoosh!The human-shaped skeleton was running at an incredible speed, which was utterly different from when it was wiggling about. In an instant, the skeleton had caught up with the Lightning Rat and along the way, the skeleton stamped on the Little Skeleton that had dashed over.Crack!The sound of the broken bones was extremely crisp.The connection of consciousness with the Little Skeleton in Su Ping\u2019s mind was cut off.\u201cRevive pet on the spot?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Su Ping said at once.The Little Skeleton was too weak and was merely at the first rank. The Severed Limb Reassemble skill could enable the Little Skeleton to set a broken bone. But the Little Skeleton could not recover if it was crushed into pieces.After Su Ping gave his answer, the Little Skeleton reassembled on the spot soon and came back to life. But one second later, the Little Skeleton was stamped into pieces by the second human-shaped skeleton.\u201c...\u201dSu Ping chose to revive the Little Skeleton on the spot again.The Little Skeleton stood up on the spot at once. It took a look around and saw where the two human-shaped skeletons were headed to. Instantly, the Little Skeleton went after them, staggering along.At the same time, the moment the human-shaped skeleton reached it, the Lightning Rat released Thunder Cloak. Its hair was standing on its root since the electric arcs crackled around its body. In the meantime, another Lightning Rat split out and it ran toward the other side of the human-shaped skeleton.Thunder Shadow Image!That human-shaped skeleton did not understand what was going on and was still hacking toward the first Lightning Rat with its arm.Bang!The first Lightning Rat was smashed into pieces but it formed a ball of the residual thunderbolt that exploded on the human-shaped skeleton\u2019s arm, inflicting considerable harm. That thunder power defused much of the dark, foul air surrounding the human-shaped skeleton as well.The moment the shadow image collapsed, the real Lightning Rat came out and aimed at the human-shaped skeleton\u2019s neck with Thunder Slash!However.The human-shaped skeleton reacted even faster.At this critical time, the skeleton twisted around with a huge boost in its speed and swung its other arm at the Lightning Rat.Thunder Flash!The moment the Lightning Rat was hit, it disappeared. It hopped over the human-shaped skeleton\u2019s arm and the Thunder Slash landed on the human-shaped skeleton\u2019s face.Bang!The human-shaped skeleton\u2019s head was smashed to the side with its neck almost cut off. Its head was about to fall.However, before the Lightning Rat could initiate the second attack, another human-shaped skeleton followed through. It reached out its withered, sharp claw and tore the Lightning Rat into pieces!Blood spurted out when the Lightning Rat\u2019s body fell to the ground.Such an intense moment happened in the split of a second.Su Ping\u2019s heart pounded as he saw this view in the distance. When he saw that the Lightning Rat was killed, he chose to bring it back to life at once.In less than a second after the body touched the ground, it came into being again amid sparkles.The instinct kicked in when the Lightning Rat sensed danger after it was brought back to life. The Lightning Rat hopped away at once, distancing itself from the human-shaped skeleton.When the Lightning Rat had a clear visual of the surroundings, the Lightning Rat\u2019s hair stood up and it turned around and began to run at once.Su Ping pulled a long face and initiated the \u201ckilling intent\u201d immediately.The Lightning Rat, who was halfway through its escape, stopped at once. It turned around, grimacing, and dashed toward the human-shaped skeleton again.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Most of the time, battle pet warriors were the brains of the team and they had to make clear judgments during combat.At this cultivation site, not only the pets were trained, Su Ping himself was benefiting from the experience.Whoosh!The Lightning Rat released a Thunder Shadow Image at once. The two Lightning Rats were running toward the injured human-shaped skeleton.While the \u201ckilling intent\u201d could induce a crazed state in the Lightning Rat, it could still receive its master\u2019s intention with precision.The human-shaped skeleton was a bit surprised as it looked at the Lightning Rat coming over again, wondering how this prey could come back to life so quickly. Yet, given its simple mind, the human-shaped skeleton did not probe further into the matter. When the Lightning Rats were close, the human-shaped skeleton dashed toward one of them.Whoosh!The skeleton waved its sickle-like arm.Thunder Flash!In that fatal moment, the Lightning Rat used the Thunder Flash, which was rare, and dodged away from this strike.After landing, the Lightning Rat jumped up again and used the Thunder Slash to hack the skeleton.Bang!The second human-shaped skeleton charged toward the Lightning Rat from the side. With a wave of its arm, the skeleton smashed the Lightning Rat into the ground and the latter died on the spot.\u201cRevive.\u201dSu Ping decided in no time.The Lightning Rat was brought back to life at once. Yet, the \u201ckilling intent\u201d had been dismissed automatically. After a second with its mind unfocused, the first instinct that kicked in was to run away.The two human-shaped skeletons could kill the Lightning Rat with any random attack, which made the Lightning Rat sense danger and horror.Su Ping had to use \u201ckilling intent\u201d again in this case.This time, he had a clear feeling that something was being pulled out from him. The moment he used the skill, his sight was blurred and his consciousness was also foggy. He could not help but fall on his face.\u201cAre three skill releases the maximum I can handle? Do I have to recover by killing myself?\u201dSu Ping\u2019s mind was functioning with difficulty. In his sight, several figures were mixed. He could no longer tell if they were the human-shaped skeletons or the strange trees around. Everything was shaking and he was seeing double.Su Ping clenched his teeth. Relying on the last piece of willpower, he crawled up from the ground and dragged himself forward.He only had one goal, to die.He did not know how many steps he took or how long he had walked before a strong force landed on his head. He was assaulted by the sharp pain instantly.In the next second, Su Ping\u2019s consciousness returned to the dark space, and the options of revival popped out.Su Ping\u2019s consciousness that had almost dried up returned with full vitality. Su Ping chose to revive on the spot at once.The darkness faded away and the surrounding view quickly re-emerged. He saw that the two human-shaped skeletons were bending over their bodies a few meters away, each with half of the Lightning Rat in their hands, eating.By their feet was the shattered body of the Little Skeleton.The sudden appearance of Su Ping shocked both of the human-shaped skeletons. They both turned around slowly.\u201cRevive!\u201d \u201cRevive!\u201dSu Ping brought the Lightning Rat and Little Skeleton back to life immediately.While they were being brought back to life, Su Ping saw one of the human-shaped skeletons dashing toward him. With a body more than three meters tall, the human-shaped skeleton looked dreadful. It went without saying that Su Ping was torn apart before he could ward off the blows.\u201cRevive!\u201dThe moment the pain came over, it disappeared without a trace.Darkness emerged. Su Ping chose to revive again. After he came back to life, he saw the two human-shaped skeletons chasing the Lightning Rat while the Little Skeleton was running after the two human-shaped skeletons; only the Little Skeleton was falling behind.\u201cKilling intent!\u201dSu Ping initiated his skill at once.When the Lightning Rat\u2019s battle rage was rekindled, Su Ping instructed the Lightning Rat to use Thunder Shadow Image to distract the other human-shaped skeletons with one of the Lightning Rats so that the real Lightning Rat would have the chance to launch a strike at the injured human-shaped skeleton.\u201cFight!\u201d\u201cThunder Flash!\u201dSu Ping was determined to make the Lightning Rat fight till the end of its life; even if it were to die again, it had to inflict a mark on the human-shaped skeleton.Fortunately, the Lightning Rat had mastered an advanced pet skill, \u201cThunder Flash.\u201d With the help of temporary teleportation, the Lightning Rat could escape from the human-shaped skeleton\u2019s strike at a close call. The Lightning Rat would dash to the other side of the human-shaped skeleton and cause harm to it.Su Ping brought the Lightning Rat back to life again and again. After two rounds of \u201ckilling intent\u201d, Su Ping asked the Lightning Rat to lure the human-shaped skeleton to him in the fight. After the Lightning Rat died again, Su Ping used the \u201ckilling intent\u201d for the third time, and in the meantime, he also tried his hand against the human-shaped skeleton as well.A cycle of life and death was repeated over and over.After a long time, Su Ping realized that he was no longer as tired as before after the third application of \u201ckilling intent.\u201d He could manage to see the surroundings and his body seemed to be adjusting with repeated exhaustion.Crack!An arm of the human-shaped skeleton was torn off. The dark, foul air was thinning down until there were only a few strands left.The human-shaped skeleton tore apart the Lightning Rat and used a strand of the dark, foul air to reset the broken arm that had fallen to the ground.\u201cRevive!\u201dAfter seven or eight times of revival, the Lightning Rat had finally exhausted the dark, foul air in this human-shaped skeleton. After another strike of Thunder Slash that cut off the human-shaped skeleton\u2019s head, the human-shaped skeleton fell apart all of a sudden, falling to the ground and lying still permanently.\u201cIs it dead...?\u201d Su Ping looked at the remains on the ground. He was relieved and at the same time, pleasantly surprised.The Lightning Rat had cut off the limbs and the head of the human-shaped skeleton and even hacked its remains into pieces, but the human-shaped skeleton could use its dark, foul air to recover its body. It was practically immortal.Su Ping would have given up on killing the two human-shaped skeletons if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he had noticed the effects of the Lightning Rat\u2019s thunder: it could contain the human-shaped skeleton and each time, the lightning and thunder power could reduce the dark, foul air.Having successfully dealt with one human-shaped skeleton, Su Ping could see the dawn of victory. He instructed the Lightning Rat to attack the other one at once.Right at that moment...Su Ping suddenly sensed a desire coming from the Little Skeleton. He looked over with surprise. Unknowingly, the Little Skeleton had moved near the scattered remains of a human-shaped skeleton. The Little Skeleton was bending over and checking the remains.\u201cDo you want to eat it?\u201dSu Ping was taken aback by this idea.He then remembered that pets of the demon family would evolve by catching and feeding off of their kindred, and skeletons were no exception to this. They mainly progressed by eating their peer\u2019s remains.The other way was to suck the power of the undead!\u201cGo ahead.\u201dSu Ping gave his permission and was looking forward to seeing the result.With Su Ping\u2019s approval, the Little Skeleton began to look through the scattered remains and bones. The Little Skeleton picked up several ribs and then threw them away after checking. Later, the Little Skeleton picked up another piece of bone that looked like a finger. The Little Skeleton observed it for a while and then, all of a sudden, pulled one of its own ribs out and stuffed this finger bone back in to take the place of the original rib.The size of the finger bone was similar to its original rib.After the replacement, some dark energy surged from the Little Skeleton. That finger bone was set with a clipping sound. The bone fit smoothly and had become a new part of the Little Skeleton....62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Those bones became part of the Little Skeleton with the help of the dark energy.While the Little Skeleton was selecting appropriate bones, the Lightning Rat was fighting a bitter fight.Thanks to the diversion created by the \u201cThunder Shadow Image,\u201d the Lightning Rat was snatched from the jaws of death several times. That being said, every time the Lightning Rat came close to the human-shaped skeleton, the latter would sense the former\u2019s presence and react swiftly and violently.Relying on the \u201cThunder Flash,\u201d the Lightning Rat could teleport and appear at difficult corners to unleash a Thunder Slash. However, whenever the Lightning Rat managed to hit its target, the human-shaped skeleton would quickly tear the Lightning Rat apart.One life for another!The gap in abilities between the Lightning Rat and the human-shaped skeleton was significant. Normally, the Lightning Rat would not stand a chance against the human-shaped skeleton.It was fortunate that Su Ping could bring the Lightning Rat back to life endlessly. As long as the Lightning Rat could inflict harm on its enemy, the latter would be tortured to death sooner or later.The human-shaped skeleton was ferocious but its intelligence was low. Taking advantage of the revivals, the Lightning Rat had been depleting the human skeleton\u2019s energy but the latter did not stop nor intend to flee.A few minutes later.Over half of the dark, foul air around the human-shaped skeleton had been reduced and the skeleton was moving slowly with less precision than before.At this moment, Su Ping perceived an intense fighting desire from the Little Skeleton. In the next moment, all Su Ping could see was a small, black figure hurrying toward the battlefield.Su Ping fixed his eyes on the dark figure. It was the Little Skeleton.But the Little Skeleton was different from before. Its height was the same but now it was surrounded by the dark air. Its arms, knees and other bones were sharper and darker.The biggest difference was how fast the Little Skeleton could run.Before, the Little Skeleton had to stumble around. At the moment, it was walking with flying feet, almost as fast as the Lightning Rat.The human-shaped skeleton was being badgered by the two Lightning Rats. Disturbed by the Thunder Shadow Image, the human-shaped skeleton had lost its bearings. When the Little Skeleton joined the fight, the human-shaped skeleton felt something. It turned around, let out a bellow, and charged toward the Little Skeleton.The Little Skeleton was not something that could be ignored or stamped to death anymore.Faced with the human-shaped skeleton, the Little Skeleton turned around and avoided the strike with considerable agility. It escaped the first strike, only to be smashed into pieces by the human-shaped skeleton that waved its other arm in a very tricky position!Among all the skeleton bones scattered on the ground, several pieces were quite firm. They were still intact after falling to the ground.Alerted by the system, Su Ping knew that the Little Skeleton had died and could not reassemble. So, he had to choose to revive it.Even though the Little Skeleton lost its life within seconds, compared with before, it had already progressed notably.With the help of the Lightning Rat shadow, the frantic Lightning Rat attacked quickly. Several Thunder Slashes landed on the human-shaped skeleton, diminishing a large amount of the dark, foul air.Five minutes later, with the concerted efforts of the Little Skeleton and the Lightning Rat, the human-shaped skeleton was slain, releasing its dark, foul air.The Little Skeleton began to scavenge for pieces among the remains. Worn out, the Lightning Rat and Su Ping sat by the side to have a rest.Whoosh!All of a sudden, a breeze was felt.Su Ping checked the surroundings as he enjoyed his rest. All of a sudden, he noticed some darkness surging over from the depth of the woods.When the darkness was hundreds of meters away from him, he realized it was a dark tide!Shrieks and howls seemed to come from the billowing black waves of smoke. Some horrifying figures floating around in the dark smoke were faintly visible.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Su Ping was startled.The next second, the tide swept across.Su Ping felt chills all over his body and his life was being drained. Right after, he appeared in the dark revival space.\u201cRevival on the spot!\u201dSu Ping did not choose to revive at another random place because the dark smoke\u2019s nature piqued his interest.As soon as he was brought back to life, he saw the black smoke was still spreading. Before he could observe closely, he once again felt a chill creeping over and then found himself in the revival space a second time.\u201cRevive!\u201dSu Ping decided to stay on the spot. He refused to be misled by fallacies.After more than a dozen revivals, when Su Ping could breathe again, he heard a gentle \u2018gee\u2019 sound coming from the dark smoke.A moment later, the dark smoke suddenly dispersed. Su Ping saw a ghost-like figure flying over. The face belonged to a breathtaking beauty; she was completely flawless, the most beautiful girl that Su Ping had ever seen.However, from her chest down, the girl\u2019s body was made up of dried bones. Su Ping thought he could see the blood-red internal organs and dark smoke surges.The girl in the dark smoke was pale and her delicate face was devoid of emotions. She sized Su Ping up and down. Her green eyes spoke of her interest and exotic charm.Su Ping was fearless. After all, he would not die for real; there was nothing to fear.He was also sizing her up and down in a brazen manner. He even wanted to squeeze her body to see if it was tangible after all.\u201cCannot be identified?\u201d Su Ping cast an identification spell but saw no information, which intrigued him even more. That was an advanced being.At the same time, the girl in the dark mist suddenly said something in a strange language that was hard to understand; it sounded like the calling of the undead.Su Ping could hardly take that information in. He was about to ask when the girl waved her hand and the black haze began to surge over.Su Ping was in that revival space once again. He still had questions so he revived on the spot at once. He saw that girl again.The girl was taken aback to see him. That playful look in her eyes deepened. She floated over, stopping very close to Su Ping.Su Ping blinked and all of a sudden, made a grabbing move toward her chest.It was soft as mist. To be exact, it was essentially made of mist.\u201cGee...\u201dJust as he finished sighing, Su Ping saw that the girl began to frown. His body temperature dropped and he went back to the revival space.Luckily, such death was not painful. Still, Su Ping chose to revive on the spot.The girl was dumbstruck after seeing him appear out of nowhere once more. Slowly, she began to contemplate the situation...\u201cDo you have intelligence? Can you understand me?\u201d Su Ping asked curiously.It was rare for him to meet a being that resembled humans. Maybe he could learn something interesting from her.The black haze girl slowly shifted her sight to him and something seemed to come to her mind. Her eyes glowed in green and she opened her mouth. All of a sudden, Su Ping felt that the heat and energy in his body were transformed into a form of golden energy that floated into her mouth.Soon, Su Ping lost his life yet again.Without hesitation, he revived on the spot.This time, the girl didn\u2019t appear to be surprised. She opened her mouth and continued to suck away Su Ping\u2019s lifeforce.Revive! Revive! Revive!Su Ping repeated the process several times but the girl in the dark haze never stopped and did not reply to his questioning, not even once.Finally, Su Ping realized that this gal was treating him as an inexhaustible food source!In a fit of rage, Su Ping decided not to probe further. He chose to revive at a random spot.Just as he came back to life, Su Ping realized that the view was different from before. He was inside a huge palace.And yet, the magnificent palace seemed to have been built with massive bones....62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The owner must be out of the ordinary, being able to build a palace to dwell in. Besides, the massive bones that were used to build the palace were towering and grandiose. Su Ping found it hard to picture how horrifying those beings must have been when they were alive!\u201cIs that the gate...?\u201dSu Ping stepped forward.He felt the air was more suffocating than outside and it was deadly still.The air was thick with the smell of decay and a strange, fishy odor.He walked only for a dozen meters when he lost his sight. He felt his body being torn apart from within by something out of the void and then he was reduced to nothing.\u201cRevive.\u201dHis sight blacked out and was recovered. Su Ping looked around, searching for the thing that attacked him.Bang!His body burst open all of a sudden for yet another time.\u201cRevive!\u201dSu Ping recovered as before.Explode!\u201cRevive!\u201d\u201cDamn it...\u201dBang!\u201cRevive!\u201dThis time, just as Su Ping was coming back to life, he saw the space in front of him begin to twist. A mass of dark energy emerged from the whirl, gradually taking the shape of a human being.This was a tall woman with an insane body shape. The buxom lady was well-endowed, which gave her an enchanting appearance. There was a black charm on her forehead, with a symbol that resembled a fishhook. She was flapping the eight dull black wings that grew from her back, just like a fallen angel depicted in the myths.Su Ping threw an identification spell on her at once.Just as he expected, no information came out.\u201cEh?\u201d The black-winged lady raised her pretty eyebrows. She looked Su Ping up and down and then, as if to seek confirmation, pointed her finger at him.Bang!Su Ping\u2019s body exploded.\u201cRevive!\u201dThe black-winged lady was stunned to see Su Ping recover. Then, she pointed her finger forward. This time, Su Ping was swallowed by a green mass of energy shaped like a skeleton.Su Ping felt he was melting; he was dissolved until nothing was left.\u201cRevive!\u201dSu Ping stood on the spot but his face was dark. That lady was treating him like a guinea pig and was exploring different ways to kill him.\u201cHey, can\u2019t we have a simple conversation?\u201d Su Ping was furious.Bang!He exploded again.\u201cRevive!\u201dSu Ping clenched his teeth in hatred. The game was on. That\u2019s right. He was filled with wrath and was daring the lady to kill him!Bang, bang, bang!After he exploded several times, he heard a surprised \u201coh\u201d when he came back to life again.This was a deep, nasal sound that was both light and at the same time, loud enough to echo in the entire palace, like a thunderbolt that could make the entire space tremble.Su Ping suddenly felt the depths of his soul quiver. His hair was standing on end. This was freakishly terrifying.His heart was pounding uncontrollably and his blood was surging as he was shivering.He couldn\u2019t see anything but he was simply afraid; something was inducing his fear.The black-winged angel that was still attempting varied ways to end him was startled by that questioning nasal sound. She turned around at once and bowed, dropping to her knees in the air toward the void in front of her\u2014toward that gate built with white bones at the end of the void.Su Ping noticed that the black-winged angel was trembling, even her wings were shaking.Whoosh!Abruptly, his sight was blurred. Next, both him and the black-winged lady re-emerged in front of a throne made of bones, but their positions and relative location had not changed one bit. It was as if they had been teleported by some mighty force.All he could see was a staircase made up of white bones pieced together. He found skulls of many different beings. There were horns on some of the skulls which had to be from demons.Atop the stair was a throne of bones with the backrest made in the shape of a sharp sword. On both sides, the armrests were two enormous skulls encrusted along with some smaller ones.Seated in the throne was a towering figure covered in the gloomy dark energy which flowed all around him, his elbows supported by the ghastly armrests. The skin on his bare wrists was pale. He tilted his head so he could look down upon those present.He lifted his eyelids slightly, revealing his dark, unemotional eyes.Su Ping looked up at him and into the cold eyes that seemed to be able to see through history. Instantly, he felt cold, fear, and the desire to kneel and worship this being.However, he dismissed the idea just as it popped out.Remembering that he could not be killed, Su Ping made up his mind and stood up straight. \u201cAre you the man in charge here?\u201dThe moment he opened his mouth, the kneeling and trembling black-winged lady waved her hands at once. A streak of dark energy sealed off Su Ping\u2019s mouth like a tape.She lowered her head at once and apologized to the king on the throne, but Su Ping did not understand one word.Bang!All of a sudden, without any warning, Su Ping exploded.\u201c??\u201dSu Ping was dumbstruck. Why was there never any sign before those beings took action?He was furious and chose to revive on the spot at once.The king on the throne of bones squinted his eternally immutable and cold eyes.Bang!Su Ping exploded once more.\u201cRevive!\u201dExplode again!\u201cRevive one more time!\u201d\u201cAre you kidding me? Can you let me finish...\u201dBang!\u201cRevive!\u201dThis time, Su Ping did not die at once. Angrily, he climbed that stair of bones and dashed toward that being.Nobody was born to be above others!Su Ping wanted to go there and punch that guy, even though he was aware that he was as vulnerable as a puny insect; he was completely unable to harm that king. But he would have died for nothing if he didn\u2019t fight back!The black-winged lady freaked out, seeing Su Ping trying to approach the \u201cking.\u201d Her expressions were twisted in wrath. Dark energy surged around her. This time, with this blow, she used her strongest strike.Since she was exerting her full strength, Su Ping would die ten thousand times over, even if he were a hundred times stronger!However, before her strike was released, she began to bend over as if something were squeezing her. There were sounds of her bones being fractured. Then, she was swung to the side, smashing into the bone columns like a bird with broken wings.While still in rage, Su Ping did not notice what happened to her. He dashed up the stairs and stood in front of the throne.The process was strangely smooth. Nothing hindered him.\u201cF*ck you...\u201d Su Ping raised his hand and punched.But his fist stopped midway and his body became so still that he could not move at all.\u201cTraveling back in time and space?\u201d All of a sudden, Su Ping heard a frigid voice in his mind. It had to be from the being on the throne.But Su Ping never saw his lips move.\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Ping had never heard about the term but he guessed it had something to do with his revival.\u201cWho are you that can reverse space and time in the Realm of the Undead? Or, should I say, who is the person behind this?\u201d That cold voice went on slowly, carrying an overwhelming sense that could not be doubted.\u201cNone of your f*cking business!\u201dSu Ping couldn\u2019t move his lips but he voiced the curse in his mind.Bang!He exploded.\u201cRevive!\u201dJust as Su Ping came back to life, he realized that his body could move about again. He was hopping mad. It was true that the being in front of him was horrifying, but being killed repeatedly had consumed him with wrath.At the same time, all of a sudden, he saw a blood-red bead the size of a baby\u2019s hand next to the throne. The bead appeared to be precious.\u201cIt must be worthwhile, even if this is just some average gem.\u201d Without hesitation, Su Ping bent over.Bang!He exploded yet again.\u201cRevive!\u201dAfter he was brought back to life, he was still bent over, just the way he was before he died. Su Ping moved down a bit more.Bang!Revive!This time, he lowered his body a bit more.By the fifth revival, Su Ping was very close to the blood-red bead. In his consciousness, he shouted, \u201cI will tell you!\u201dHe didn\u2019t explode.His hand grabbed the blood-red bead.\u201cGot it!\u201dThe bead vanished. It was transferred to the storage space.\u201cWhat?\u201dThat being had seen through Su Ping\u2019s intent but did not know that there were storage treasures in him. The moment this being saw Su Ping, he already had a complete understanding of his puny existence. Nothing could escape from his eyes.\u201cI will tell you to go to hell!\u201d Su Ping obtained the bead. Overjoyed, Su Ping hurled out curses without hesitation.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once again, for such a benighted person to try to fool him... he was annoyed by how ignorant those inferior creatures could be!This was just a small punishment. The king on the throne planned to strip this puny being of his soul when Su Ping came back to life again, to find out the secrets inside him. He would imprison this ignorant soul under his throne throughout eternity so that Su Ping could not die even if he aspired to!However...Five seconds had passed, then ten seconds... and then one minute passed.The void in front of him was undisturbed. Su Ping did not come back again.The king on the throne frowned. While he was still baffled, all of a sudden, he shifted his look. His dark eyes seemed to be able to see through the void. He, who had been sitting still for all this time, stood up all of a sudden!Boom!The palace trembled and space shook.The pride that he had accumulated through the ages manifested, and that overwhelming power could run through the entire world!All the undead beings within millions of meters of this majestic bone palace felt the anger from their king. They fell to their knees, shivering in fear!\u201cThis is a time-spatial diversion! The time-spatial diversion!\u201dThis heroic king who was surrounded by monstrous powers gazed through the hall with his dark eyes into the distance. \u201cThe two laws of supremacy were applied at the same time. The distance of one transfer is beyond the scope of my territory. Who is it? Who is it!\u201dThe black-winged lady that fell to a corner of this bone palace was surprised to see her king flying into a rage. How long had it been? Tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years had passed since she last saw her king losing his temper.When the king was angry, blood would flow for thousands of miles, and ghosts would cry!\u201cYou!\u201d That towering being lowered his head. Flames were blasting around him. His eyes could snatch people\u2019s souls as if they were a pair of black holes. \u201cFind that being and bring him back to me!\u201dThe black-winged lady lowered her head at once. Her voice was trembling as she replied, \u201cYes, your Majesty!\u201dAfterward, she kept her head lowered for two more seconds. There were no more orders for her. She shifted into a puff of black mist and vanished from the palace.The peerless king seemed to be unaware that the lady with black wings had left. He frowned and murmured to himself, \u201cOnly those old guys that are sealed in the dust-laden ancient times can apply the two supreme laws at the same time. Who else can it be? Have they come back from the cursed old world...?\u201d......\u201cRevive at a random spot!\u201dAfter he hurled out those insults, Su Ping accepted his death calmly. It was not a surprise that this time, he chose to be revived at a random spot!\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting to run after cursing!\u201dSu Ping felt even his pores were breathing in comfort since he had vented his anger.He was on the verge of bursting into laughter as he thought about that big potato being unable to chase him after being dissed.\u201cDoes he think that I would keep reviving myself and sending myself to oblivion? So na\u00efve!\u201dSu Ping wore a sarcastic grin.Sarcasm aside, that was a risky move. Luckily, that being was overly confident and proud. He thought that Su Ping would revive on the spot every time and that he could squeeze him to death at will.If he had known that Su Ping could revive at a random spot, Su Ping supposed that the being would have imprisoned him and tortured him slowly until he drove him crazy.\u201cI hope I never run into him again. Otherwise, I\u2019ll have to kill myself at once,\u201d Su Ping said to himself. He felt he had to find some handy weapons to defend (i.e. kill) himself. Otherwise, it would be utterly painful to be ravished by some enemies that wanted to kill him but refused to.More importantly, his precious time in this cultivation site would be wasted if he were to be slowly tortured.At the same time, Su Ping\u2019s sights cleared up gradually. He had been brought back to life in another location.Hanging above his head were still the three blood moons and the sky was cloudy and crimson. Around him was a huge mountain covered with bones and remains.Neither grass nor flowers of any sort grew in the mountain, which was made up entirely of countless bones and remains.Crack!Su Ping moved his feet. He had stomped on some hand bones.Those bones must have been weathered during thousands of years to be that fragile.Gradually, Su Ping got used to the scenes in this Chaotic Realm of the Undead. He had developed some resistance to these hellish horror scenes.He took his time to bring the Lightning Rat and the Little Skeleton back to life. Those two little guys had been killed in that black haze. Thanks to the power of the contract, they could revive right by his side.The Lightning Rat could once again see the outside. It was appalled by the view of this mountain of skeletons. But different from before, the Lightning Rat was not as agitated or terrified. Soon, the Lightning Rat put its guards up and began to check the surroundings with its rat eyes.Having been stimulated by the \u201ckilling intent\u201d several times, the Lightning Rat had become much bolder than before.After the Little Skeleton was brought back to life, it glanced around with a dull look. Then, the Little Skeleton cast its empty gaze on the piles of bones on the ground, picking and choosing. But the Little Skeleton threw away the bones it picked up because it was discouraged after seeing the options.\u201cLet\u2019s take a look around and see if there are any enemies.\u201d Su Ping instructed the Lightning Rat in his mind.The Lightning Rat was reluctant and hesitating. Still, it began to move forward cautiously without making any noises to check the area.Su Ping cast his gaze on the Little Skeleton who was picking bones. All of a sudden, Su Ping remembered the blood-red bead he grabbed off from the throne. An idea came to his mind. He took it out of the storage space at once.The blood-red bead felt warm in his hand.When he snatched it, Su Ping put it away into his storage space in a hurry, so he didn\u2019t have time to check the bead carefully. At the moment, it was to his surprise that the blood-red bead seemed to be a living entity and it would tremble and throb mildly.\u201cThis is precious...\u201d Su Ping exclaimed.At the same time, the scavenging Little Skeleton lifted up its head all of a sudden and fixed its hollowed eye sockets on the blood-red bead in Su Ping\u2019s hands.Su Ping sensed a strong desire from the Little Skeleton\u2019s consciousness.This desire was tens or hundreds of times stronger than when the Little Skeleton wanted those human-shaped skeletons. If it weren\u2019t for the constraint exerted by the contract, Su Ping believed the Little Skeleton would pounce on the bead!\u201cDo you want it?\u201dIt was most likely that the blood-red bead could do the Little Skeleton good since it wanted the bead so much. That was understandable. After all, this bead was from the Realm of the Undead. It was only natural that the bead would be of help to an undead being like the Little Skeleton.Su Ping remembered the main quest. He threw the bead to the little guy after a bit of hesitation. Anyways, this little guy was a pet of his own.The Little Skeleton held the blood-red bead and the red glow from the bead seemed to have deepened the crimson color in the Little Skeleton\u2019s eye sockets. Resolutely, the Little Skeleton stuffed the bead into its mouth and the bead moved up to the skeleton\u2019s skull directly!After the Little Skeleton removed its hands, the blood-red bead began to float around in its skull. There seemed to be some faint red threads that looked like blood vines, flowing into the Little Skeleton\u2019s skull along with the greyish energy inside, and then going into the bones around the Little Skeleton\u2019s body.Su Ping was surprised. He cast another identification spell on the Little Skeleton again.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It can display combat strength of nearly the third rank while the Little Skeleton is, in fact, at the intermediate position of the first rank. That is impressive. Yet, given the strict standards of the system, the Little Skeleton is still regarded as inferior.\u201dSu Ping forced a smile. He felt frustrated when he remembered the requirement for finishing the main quest, which was to raise the Little Skeleton\u2019s aptitude to an above average rate.On the other hand, while they had died many times since they had been teleported to the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, up until then, they had only been there for two or three hours.The Little Skeleton had come a long way within such a short time. This was outstanding.\u201cWoo!\u201dAll of a sudden, the Lightning Rat came back from the distance, passing through some signs of warning and nervousness.Su Ping concentrated his mind. He took a closer look and saw a huge, crawling skeleton coming from the piles of bones behind the Lightning Rat.The skeleton was nearly five meters long, resembling a mixture between a beast and a twisted human being. The skeleton was made up of bones of varied animals. It was traveling on all fours as it chased after the Lightning Rat.Su Ping was not taken aback by this monster. He focused his mind and cast the \u201ckilling intent\u201d skill at once. \u201cMove!\u201dThe Lightning Rat that had run back began to show its teeth and its eyes reddened. It halted on the spot and then electricity was generated all around its body. The Lightning Rat turned around and charged toward that huge skeleton.Su Ping turned his sight to the Little Skeleton who was still standing there, at a loss. Yet, different from the past dull look, seemingly reveling in comfort. The grey mist surrounding the Little Skeleton was mixed with some blood-red aura that was flowing across its bones which were becoming tougher than before, after the combined effect of the grey energy and the blood-red aura.It appeared that the Little Skeleton was consuming this blood-red bead. Su Ping decided not to let the Little Skeleton participate; the Lightning Rat would fight alone this time.The abilities of this massive, crawling skeleton were evidently far superior to the human-shaped skeletons from before. It was obvious that the Lightning Rat could not react fast enough. Luckily, the Lightning Rat had mastered one of the 10 special skills, \u201cThunder Flash,\u201d which enabled it to teleport close to its enemies. With Su Ping\u2019s unlimited chances of revival, the Lightning Rat could reduce its enemy\u2019s powers bit by bit, just like a war of attrition.Bang!After more than a hundred revivals, the Lightning Rat suddenly discharged a bolt of lightning. Even with meters apart, the flash of lightning landed on the crawling skeleton.Su Ping was surprised. He had never seen the Lightning Rat use this skill before.Su Ping cast an identification spell and saw that the Lightning Rat had mastered another skill, named \u201cFlying Thunder Arrow.\u201d\u201cIntermediate-rank skill of the thunder family, usually mastered by flying pets of the thunder family. I didn\u2019t know that the little guy could be pushed out of its limits to unleash this skill...\u201d Su Ping smiled. While this was an intermediate-level skill, the upside was that the skill could be used for remote attacks. So, by all counts, it was good.Therefore, this little Lightning Rat must have been desperate after using the \u201cThunder Flash\u201d for many times to get close to its enemy and then inflict harm at the cost of its own life, to have come up with this remote attack idea.With the mastery of \u201cFlying Thunder Arrow,\u201d the combat strength of the Lightning Rat had been elevated to 4.3. The Lightning Rat could defeat many battle pets of the fourth rank at this time.After about an hour, the crawling skeleton finally fell to the ground after the dark, foul aura was depleted. There was no more energy for the skeleton to repair its lost limbs. The Lightning Rat took it apart.The Little Skeleton ran over as soon as the crawling skeleton fell and began to look through the pile of bones. Yet, this time, the Little Skeleton did not choose any bones to replace its own. Instead, the Little Skeleton chose a sharp-edged bone and brought it back.The Little Skeleton was holding the sharp bone blade like its official saber. While surprised, Su Ping also found it interesting.\u201cI wonder what this item can do to the Little Skeleton. It must need a long time to consume it entirely.\u201d Su Ping took a curious look at the blood-red bead inside the Little Skeleton\u2019s skull. The blood aura in the blood-red bead was being absorbed by the Little Skeleton and the bead was becoming smaller.Su Ping did not rest. He told the Lightning Rat to go and look for other prey to lure them over.Reluctantly, the Lightning Rat did as told. Not long afterward, it ran back in panic. It had lured back two odd-looking skeletons in one go. One of the skeletons looked like a monster and the other was human shaped, but both were clumsy skeletons; both had a large size and a height of about five meters. They were holding huge bones in their hands as shields.Those skeletons had developed a certain level of intelligence. Part of that came from the remaining consciousness of the living beings that the skeletons once were. Therefore, the two knew how to equip themselves.Su Ping instructed both the Little Skeleton and the Lightning Rat to engage at once.The Little Skeleton waved its little bone blade and rushed to the more agile skeleton.When they saw the Little Skeleton, something attracted the huge skeletons\u2019 attention. They simultaneously gave up on attacking the Lightning Rat; they turned around and rushed toward the Little Skeleton directly.The Little Skeleton waved its small bone blade and jumped up to slash at the crawling skeleton. However, the former was unable to sever the bones of the latter. The Little Skeleton was smashed away by a piece of bone that was thrown at it. The Little Skeleton appeared to be much stronger than before, because it did not fall apart this time.Su Ping cast an identification spell. The crawling skeleton\u2019s combat strength was 5.2, way stronger than the Little Skeleton and the Lightning Rat.That crawling skeleton threw itself at the Little Skeleton rapidly and bit the latter. The former moved its jaws and swung its head as if it were going to eat up the Little Skeleton.But the giant skeleton that came after smashed its shield on the crawling skeleton. The Little Skeleton was freed from that big mouth. Then, the giant skeleton threw that almost shattered Little Skeleton into its mouth. Dark and foul aura was surging in that giant skeleton. It was aiming to cannibalize the Little Skeleton!Crack.The Little Skeleton fell to pieces. That blood-red bead fell out from its skull as well, and the bead was then inside the skull of that giant skeleton.At the same time, Su Ping received the prompt message for revival.He was surprised to know that the blood-red bead would fall out after the death of the Little Skeleton. Was it because the bead had not been completely absorbed yet?There was no time for him to think. Su Ping brought the Little Skeleton back to life at once and asked it to cooperate with the Lightning Rat to attack the giant.Apart from the Little Skeleton and the Lightning Rat, the crawling skeleton that was hit by the shield had pounced at the giant skeleton at the same time. They were fighting for the blood-red bead.\u201cUse Thunder Flash to sneak into its skull and bring the bead out!\u201d Su Ping passed along his intention to the Lightning Rat.Having received the instructions, the Lightning Rat leaped from place to place until it was inside the large skull of that giant skeleton. The Lightning Rat gripped the bead with its teeth. With a flash of lightning, the Lightning Rat left the skeleton and then went back to Su Ping after a couple of more leaps.Su Ping took over the blood-red bead and threw it into his storage space.While this bead was beneficial to the Little Skeleton, given its current status, it would need a great deal of time to completely absorb the energy. In the event of a sudden death and the appearance of another powerful being fancying this item, they might lose the bead forever.\u201cWe have to go back and wait for some free time for the Little Skeleton to consume it slowly. I can also let the system check what it is,\u201d Su Ping thought to himself. He looked up. Without the blood-red bead, the fight between the two skeletons had stopped. They were concentrating on the Lightning Rat and the Little Skeleton again. Both of the skeletons dashed over ferociously.\u201cCharge!\u201dSu Ping commanded the Little Skeleton and the Lightning Rat to go at the same time.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He took the Lightning Rat and the Little Skeleton with him to search for other prey around this huge mountain of bones, all though they were the puniest lives there.When he was out of strength, Su Ping would recover by revival.When his mind was fatigued, he would commit suicide to recover.The person, the rat, and the skeleton went on an expedition along the mountain of bones. They only chose to revive in another location when they encountered beings that were far superior to them. Then, they would start their exploration again!Time zipped by. Soon, three days had passed.Su Ping had lost count of the number of revivals or places that he had visited randomly. He just remembered there were mountains with huge piles of skeletons and bones, dark forests that would feast on life energy, and boundless oceans that were bubbling with blood...He had encountered many undead beings, some twisted and ugly, some charming and beautiful, some weak like an average skeleton with a combat strength of no more than five and others that were so strong and powerful, as towering as mountains, that Su Ping could not even see their complete appearance.In this sinister environment, Su Ping, the Lightning Rat, and the Little Skeleton were all growing quickly.Bang!Suddenly, two spooky ghosts\u2019 pale and transparent bodies were suddenly shrouded by a large cluster of lightning bolts; they annihilated on the spot before they could come close!A purple figure jumped out with the lightning bolts rushing in its hair. The guy landed gently, striding with a dexterous step through the place where the ghosts were exterminated, and continuing onward.Behind it, a person and a skeleton followed closely.Compared with three days prior, the appearance of the Lightning Rat did not change much, except that its fur darkened and the thunder power contained within was thicker.After all, the Lightning Rat was only of the second rank. Unleashing several skills of the thunder family in a row would take a toll on its energy storage.Therefore, when the Lightning Rat learned \u201cThunder Slash,\u201d the Lightning Rat had gradually picked up more sophisticated ways to store energy. The Lightning Rat would compress its energy to the extreme and fill its entire body with energy. Regarding the total amount of thunder energy stored, the Lighting Rat was no weaker than a fifth or sixth-rank pet of the thunder family!\u201cFruit of the Undead!\u201dSu Ping suddenly saw a dusty, odd tree in front of him, with several bright, blood-colored fruits.These fruits had a faint outline of a human face and were the favored food for a handful of pets of the thunder family. The fruits contained strong power of the undead and could be rarely purchased in the federation. After all, each of those fruits represented a life lost!\u201cGo!\u201dSu Ping drew back his sight. Without hesitation, he told the Lightning Rat to strike that fruit tree.As soon as the Lightning Rat received Su Ping\u2019s command, electric arcs burst out all around the Lightning Rat, eventually converging into a ball of lightning that whooshed toward the root of that fruit tree.Bang!The moment the bolt of lightning came close, the rootstock buried underground suddenly broke through the soil, reaching toward the bolt of lightning, shattering the latter in an instant. However, the roots and twigs were burnt black and fell to the ground.Bang! Bang! Bang!The Lightning Rat launched strikes consecutively with its thunder and lightning. The number of roots of this fruit tree were decreasing until, finally, the tree could not endure a hit on its trunk where a black mark was left. Su Ping could somehow hear unpleasant screams coming from under the tree.Su Ping didn\u2019t show any mercy. That Tree of the Undead would capture other lives, including skeletons and ghosts, to turn them into nourishment. It just so happened that pets of the thunder family were the invincible opponents of such trees.Soon, the fruit tree was cleaved in two. Su Ping picked the Fruits of the Undead and put them into his storage space.\u201cThe storage space is almost full.\u201dSu Ping frowned when he noticed how the storage space had almost reached the limit. There were various kinds of pet food that he had collected on the way during those three days. He had two more days left and he could find more food, but he feared that the remaining storage space would not be enough.\u201cSystem, can the storage space be upgraded?\u201d Su Ping asked in his mind.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow many energy points?\u201d\u201cOne hundred energy points for every cubic meter.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t bargain with the system because it never worked. He used his remaining points to upgrade the storage space. It was a rare chance that he could come to this top-level cultivation site that would cost 9000 energy points for supplies. He didn\u2019t wish to lose some pet food just because he lacked storage space.\u201cIt is unfortunate that the pet food harvested here is mostly pet food for the demon family, which is not in popular demand. Few places would sell such food and few people would buy it. I must think hard about distribution,\u201d Su Ping said to himself.After harvesting the fruit, Su Ping pressed onward.Su Ping had searched the entire area after some unexpected deaths due to surprise attacks. Again, he chose to revive at a random place and thus began to explore a new area.On the fifth day.\u201cThe time is almost over now...\u201dStanding in front of a cliff, Su Ping gazed at the muddy ocean of dead bodies in which many bones and remains were soaked, rising and falling with the tide.Su Ping had become immune to that hellish scene.By his feet, two little guys stood in silence.Compared with five days before, their appearances were not quite different. Between them, the Little Skeleton\u2019s change was more obvious. The bones transferred from gray to black and there seemed to be some blood streaks in the bones like veins.As for the Little Skeleton\u2019s size, it was still about as tall as Su Ping\u2019s knee. There was no growth in this regard.It was holding a sharp bone blade in its hand. A dagger, to be exact.This bone blade was made from the fang of a skeleton that was almost 10 meters long!After five days of training, the Little Skeleton was at the moment more like a local skeleton born in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. Its energy changed from a light gray to a dull black. The energy was moving around the Little Skeleton and the bone blade.\u201cThis is the end of the road. Let\u2019s go.\u201dSu Ping drew back his sight after standing in that stinky sea wind. He took out a pointed tooth from his sleeve.This tooth was sharp; it was surrounded by some foul aura.Pff!Su Ping kept a straight face as he stabbed his chest with this blade.When he felt pain, he curled his lips. \u201cThis is a mistake. I should have stabbed harder.\u201dHe fell to the ground with a bang. Staring at the crimson air, feeling blood oozing out, Su Ping exclaimed to himself that this... was a complete waste of time!The Lightning Rat and the Little Skeleton looked at him. They were anxious but did not know what to do.While this had happened many times, they would feel anxious and longed to do something when they felt life leaving their masters bodies due to the power of the contract.Not long afterward, in another place in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, the person, the rat, and the skeleton appeared out of thin air. After a short time checking, they launched vicious attacks on the undead beings around them.........The Pixie Pet Store on Taohuaxi Street.The shutter door was closed. It was pitch dark inside.All of a sudden, a whirl emerged out of nowhere, spitting out three figures.When the whirl gradually disappeared, someone opened his black eyes. Seeing the familiar store that he had been away from for days and smelling the unprecedented fresh air, Su Ping felt that he had been resurrected from the numbness and his life had gone back to normal.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Collect?\u201dBefore Su Ping could clear his head, he had heard two prompt messages from the system.Su Ping was surprised at first and then he gladly accepted.Those five days of non-stop battles and countless resurrections had paid off. Half a day before their return, the two little guys had completed those two almost impossible tasks!Of course, apart from their efforts, they had to thank the environment in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. As a top-level cultivation site, the aura of the undead in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead was extremely profound. Just breathing that air constantly would slowly turn a live being into an undead!That was the best world for the Little Skeleton. Because of this, the Little Skeleton could improve from a poor aptitude to an above-average rating after five days of insane battles!At the moment, the Little Skeleton and the Lightning Rat were much stronger in combat strength than their peers. None could compete with them!Su Ping cast an identification spell on them.Little SkeletonProperty: Pet of the demon familyRank: Upper position of the second rankCombat strength: 7.4Aptitude: Above averageAbilities Mastered: Regeneration, Undead Enslaving, Intermediate Saberplay, Puppetry, Rotting Flesh, Darkness Blinding, and Deadly RoarApart from the upgrade to the regeneration from the species\u2019 basic skill, \u201cSevered Limbs Reassemble,\u201d the Little Skeleton had picked up more abilities to an intermediate and advanced levels. Amongst the skills, the Undead Enslaving was a rare special skill in the species of the undead!The strength of the undead slaves was related to the surrounding environment. When the number of dead bodies reached a certain range, that strength would be unmatchable!With Blood Spirit Conversion, the pets could devour blood and transform blood into energy for their uses.As for the Intermediate Saberplay, it was not an ability for the undead and should belong to some quasi-human pets. For the Little Skeleton, this ability, as the name suggested, was merely at the intermediate level.Puppetry, Rotting Flesh and the other abilities were quite useful and they could be the headache for the majority of battle pet warriors.With so many abilities mastered, while the Little Skeleton was only at the upper position of the second rank, its combat strength had reached an alarming 7.4 level, enough to compare with most of the average seventh-rank pets!Su Ping was rather happy with the result. When the Little Skeleton reached a combat strength of 7.1, the aptitude had been identified as above average. Half a day later, there was another increase of 0.3. The Chaotic Realm of the Undead was surely a paradise for the Little Skeleton!As for the other pet.Shadow Lightning RatProperty: Astral Pet of the thunder familyRank: Intermediate position of the third rankCombat strength: 7.3Aptitude: Above averageAbilities Mastered: Thunder Rush, Thunder Flash, Multiple Thunder Shadow Image, Thunder Slash, Thunder Armor, All-round Thunder Prison, Bloodthirst Bite, Thunder Roar, Soul Eater, Claws of the Undead, Life Drain, Undead Calling, and Death DeceitApart from the \u201cshadow\u201d addition in the name, the number of abilities the Lightning Rat had mastered was alarmingly large!\u201cThunder Rush\u201d was an upgrade from \u201cLightning Speed,\u201d an advanced skill for pets of the thunder family, but a common one amongst all the advanced pet skills. Generally, all advanced pets could replace \u201cLightning Speed\u201d with \u201cThunder Rush\u201d!As for the \u201cThunder Shadow Image,\u201d it had been enhanced. Four images could be generated at one time. Counting the actual Lightning Rat itself, there would be five Shadow Lightning Rats in total!The \u201cFlying Thunder Arrow\u201d that the Shadow Lightning Rat learned there had been upgraded to \u201cAll-round Thunder Prison,\u201d with a wider attack range and more strength. This was a must for pets of the thunder family of the offensive type!\u201cThunder Roar\u201d was also an advanced pet skill, quite common. It was a skill that advanced pets used for deterrence effects.Apart from those skills of the thunder family, the other ones were quite peculiar.Soul Eater and Life Drain were used by pets of the undead branch of the demon family which were common amongst them.Claws of the Undead was a common skill of the undead. As for the Undead Calling, it was an intermediate level skill of the undead. The caller could summon the undead for help.As for the last one, Death Deceit, it was an authentic undead pet skill. One could fake death and lose the breath of life completely.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that pets of the thunder family could learn skills of the undead. I think it is rare that a pet could learn the skills of another family. Such things can only happen either because of coincidence or due to living in a different environment for long periods of time.\u201dSu Ping found it both strange and funny when he saw that Undead Calling. If, on the stage, a low-rank Lightning Rat would suddenly unleash Undead Calling to summon an undead to cooperate, that view would twist people\u2019s fundamental values!\u201cHaving stayed in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead for five days, the little guy seems to have changed a bit. In addition to the thunder energy, there is undead energy mixed within. That is why this little thing is able to use undead skills.\u201dSu Ping looked at the Lightning Rat by his feet. On the surface, it did not seem to be that different from the average Lightning Rat. Differences could only be found after a closer check, such as the fir color, the sharpness of its fangs, and the color of its pupils.\u201cThat is to say, in the future, when I take the Little Skeleton to a thunder realm such as the Thunder Cloud Realm, could it learn to use skills of the thunder family?\u201d Su Ping wondered. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh as he pictured how the Little Skeleton would generate lightning, waving its hands with a dull look on its face.But he did understand that it wasn\u2019t easy for a pet to learn the skills of other families.This time, they visited a top-level cultivation world that was rich in undead energy. That had exerted a great influence on the Lightning Rat.If they had gone to other sites, the effects might be less obvious. Just relying on average battles, it would have taken an incredibly long time for a pet to learn the skills of other families.\u201cIt\u2019s such a shame to give away this genius Lightning Rat.\u201d Su Ping felt sorry. But he did have some comfort since his Little Skeleton would remain.He sent the two pets to the pet room and bought an elementary nursing pen for the Little Skeleton with the last 10 energy points he had left, so that the Little Skeleton could rest there.After they went to sleep, Su Ping left the pet room quietly and headed to the lobby where he finally had the time to collect the rewards the system had given him.\u201cWhat is this \u2018Chaos Star Chart\u2019?\u201dSu Ping was curious.He had just collected the reward when a vast and simple presence suddenly came into his mind, instantly drawing his consciousness into the unlimited and boundless universe, making him a tiny wisp of consciousness in the starry sky.Around him were spiral galaxies, surrounded by countless stars.In the next moment, those cosmic landscapes were condensed at a rapid speed, turning into a ray of light and shrinking to enter his body, with galaxies matching various body parts.\u201cChaos Star Chart...\u201dSome ancient consciousness surged out from this information. The reward of this main quest, the \u201cChaos Star Chart,\u201d was an archaic method for astral power cultivation!Su Ping was marveled at this because the cultivation methodology of the \u201cChaos Star Chart\u201d was simply stunning. He would be the vast universe, and the acupuncture points, muscles, and bones throughout the body would be the corresponding stars. This methodology was nothing like the astral power cultivation practice used in the federation, a method he had barely come into contact with!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was a reward from the system and it had to be of high quality. Currently, what he wanted the most was a method to cultivate astral powers. This reward could not have come at a better timing!\u201cCultivation of astral power...\u201d\u201cFeel the energy between the heaven and earth around you and store it in the original cores of the body cells, then weave and compress the energy in the original cores to construct the original force vortices, to later use the countless original force vortices in the countless cells to affect the external energy through the body to exert astral skills...\u201dThe \u201cChaos Star Chart\u201d offered a detailed explanation on how to cultivate it, which had ushered Su Ping into an entirely new world.As of this moment, Su Ping had achieved a true awakening. He evolved from a regular person, to step into the world of battle pet warriors. He had witnessed the use of extraordinary powers.Su Ping closed his eyes at once and focused his mind on the miraculous cultivation presented by the \u201cChaos Star Chart.\u201dThe first-time cultivation attempt was difficult as well as exhilarating. Su Ping lost himself in the process.In the extreme tranquility, he appreciated himself and the world.Soon after, Su Ping felt that some hazy astral power was floating around him, gentle and subtle, like grains of sand. His consciousness gathered those grains like a pair of hands. The astral power seemed to have heeded the call of his consciousness; they slowly flew toward him and seeped into his skin, falling into the original cell cores.This process was smooth, which surprised and excited Su Ping.And yet.Those original cores inside the cells, while appearing to be tiny, they seemed to contain an entire universe!The mist-like astral power entered the original cores as if they had fallen into another universe; they became quite minute after that.Su Ping gathered and absorbed a vast amount of astral power from his surroundings. However, his perception and the range of his consciousness could reach were limited. He could only gather astral power from an area within a two meter radius around him.The gathering of astral power was still soft and slow. Su Ping could not accelerate the process. No matter how anxious he was in his conscious mind, he could not expedite the gathering of astral power. Rather, it would cause a disturbance and slow down the absorption.While he seemed to be surrounded by astral power, the astral power that could be taken into the original cores in his cells were significantly small in quantity.How could so little astral power form a vortex in the original core, not to mention filling up the latter?While continuously gathering astral power, Su Ping\u2019s excitement gradually disappeared. He slowly realized that this astral power cultivation could not be done overnight, and the astral power had to be accumulated over time. The real difficulty was how to persevere!While gathering astral power was easy and the process was unhindered, to make astral power vortices, he had to do the same thing and repeat the same behavior, day in and day out. That required outstanding patience and a will of steel that could endure the increasing boredom!That was the \u201chardest part\u201d in cultivation!\u201cThe first state of the \u2018Chaos Star Chart\u2019 is the Star Vortex State. The main focus is to gather astral power in the original cores to form vortices. Once that is done, I can unleash astral skills and affect the world outside.\u201cThe second stage is the Star Body State!\u201cThe original cores should be stuffed with astral power to substantialize the vortices. The sudden outburst of strength would be like countless stars exploding within the body. Just the physical strength alone will make me like a human-shaped beast, enabling me to fight pets of the corresponding rank of the power type and even higher!\u201d\u201cThe third state is the Star Chart State, which is too far in the future for me right now...\u201dSu Ping slowly opened his eyes. The first two states of the Chaos Star Chart did not require any skills and relied only on the accumulation and convergence of astral power.He had been cultivating until his consciousness felt tired. But Su Ping realized the astral power gathered in the original cores were still low in density. It was hard to form a wisp of energy, let alone a vortex!He had to admit that this was a disappointing result.Such frustration was also the \u201cdevil inside\u201d that could hinder cultivation. It would discourage people. That was why cultivation was not easy.\u201cRight. I have three \u2018Original Force Pellets\u2019.\u201dSu Ping\u2019s spirit was lifted when he remembered the other reward.The Original Force Pellets could improve a persons\u2019 astral power cultivation. Such items that could have this direct improvement effect were highly valuable in the federation and only the powerful and the rich could afford them!That was why those glamorous talents were usually from families with strong connections. It was as difficult as to climb up to the sky for the general public to enjoy the same resources. Not even one in the general public could be found with such connections... in a million.Su Ping took out the pellets from the storage space with his mind.Three coffee-colored Original Force Pellets appeared in his hands.Each pellet was the size of a thumb. Su Ping took a sniff. There was a faint scent.\u201cHow do I eat it?\u201d Su Ping asked the system.\u201cChew them so you don\u2019t choke,\u201d The system replied.\u201c...\u201dWhy did he find those words familiar?Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He threw one of the pellets into his mouth; he chewed it slowly and then swallowed it.While he was chewing, he felt some concentrated astral power flowing into him, into his stomach and then to the rest of his body.Soon, Su Ping noticed that the density of astral power inside the original cores in his cells was increasing. Previously, it was pitch dark in the original cores with some feeble astral power drifting. At the moment, the amount increased more than a hundred times and they had formed wisps of astral power!\u201cThis one pellet\u2019s effect is equal to when I cultivate for hundreds of days!\u201d Su Ping\u2019s eyes glowed brightly.He closed his eyes instantly and focused his mind on the original cores in the cells. He transformed the astral power into belts of energy and wove them together into an hourglass-shaped vortex base.\u201cToo little astral power to form a vortex.\u201dSu Ping took another Original Force Pellet without hesitation.The astral power inside the original cores in his cells increased and were surging in wisps.Su Ping gathered the astral power into the hour-glass shaped vortex and arranged it as the outside wall of the vortex. Halfway through, the astral power ran out again.He made a determined effort and took the last of the Original Force Pellets.Soon, while the Original Force Pellet had been seemingly burnt up, the rich astral power was injected into all of the original cores in the cells. With one gesture, Su Ping finished the walls of the vortices.Buzzing!All of a sudden, Su Ping felt his body tremble, as if he had bumped against the world!An unprecedented powerful force came from all over his body and then it flooded to reach every part. He felt as if he could tear a tiger into pieces!In his body, there was a petite vortex in each of the original cores of the cells; they were swirling slowly in the darkness of the original cores.A strong force would be generated with each swirl. Su Ping felt a continuous flow of strength!Also, the feeble astral power that adhered to his skin like specks of dust were being pulled into the original cores by the vortices. Slow like a turtle, the vortices were growing.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His vortices were poles asunder from the star vortices depicted in the \u201cChaos Star Chart\u201d.At the true Star Vortex State, the star vortices would stretch to every corner of the original cores like a hurricane. Each of his star vortices looked more like a small galaxy in a dark, empty universe with large areas to extend to.That being said.While those were small star vortices, features of the Star Vortex State had already manifested.His body would absorb the surrounding astral power automatically and at all times, to fill in the energy consumed in his daily life and to slowly develop his cultivation.Of course, compared to when he was cultivating proactively, such development was nothing. On the other hand, many a little makes a mickle. Indirectly, this was speeding up his cultivation as well.\u201cThere\u2019s a big room for improvement. While I haven\u2019t reached the Star Vortex State, my body has been strengthened several times!\u201dSu Ping felt the strength surging within him was definitely more powerful when compared to average people. His sight had been enhanced. He was able to see in a pitch dark environment; even the pet food\u2019s tags and prices on the shelves were visible, and that wasn\u2019t something an average person could achieve.\u201cI wonder which rank I have reached as a battle pet warrior. First-rank, I suppose?\u201d Su Ping thought.\u201cThe host\u2019s information interface has been unlocked. The host can check his personal status through this property interface,\u201d The system mentioned casually, and somehow, Su Ping felt the system was disdaining him.Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He had gotten used to the system\u2019s blatant eavesdropping. He knew that this system was not the respectable or honest kind. Luckily, its abilities were commendable.\u201cInterface.\u201dSu Ping said the word on his mind and a virtual panel hopped out in his sight.Su PingProperty: HumanRank: Initial success of the Star Vortex StateCombat Strength: 3.5Score: ??Abilities Mastered: Killing IntentThat was... it?Su Ping didn\u2019t know what to make of this crude panel. He was a bit relieved when he saw that he was ranked at \u201cthe initial success of the Star Vortex State,\u201d though. That was to say, he had indeed reached the Star Vortex State.\u201cA combat strength of 3.5... Did I reach the standard for third-rank battle pet warriors with my strength?\u201dThis was a surprise to Su Ping. If this was the truth, he was indeed powerful!He had never cultivated before; it had been his first try that day. The three Original Force Pellets he consumed had to be potent. It could be said that each of the Original Force Pellets had added one point of combat strength to his power, and each pellet consumed meant climbing one more rank.He could be compared favorably with many college students in famous academies after having leapt to the third rank from zero when he had just awoken!\u201cNo wonder Original Force Pellets are only effective to low-rank battle pet warriors. The pellet can help a person rise in rank directly!\u201dSu Ping exclaimed to himself how mighty the system was. Finishing such a difficult task had turned out to be worthwhile.\u201cAnyways, what is this score about? Why are there question marks in it?\u201dSu Ping noticed the score row. When he was accepting quests, he had heard the system mention something about the score. If he didn\u2019t reach the passing line, he would be eliminated. This property was of vital importance!\u201cOnly the system can check the host\u2019s score,\u201d it replied calmly.Su Ping was speechless. The system had such a domineering personality. It was too bossy!All of a sudden.Su Ping felt his interface\u2019s format looked familiar. It was like... the pet\u2019s interface. No, the two interfaces were essentially identical!Other than having \u201captitude\u201d instead of \u201cscore,\u201d nothing else changed.\u201cAm I... also a pet in your eyes?\u201d Su Ping could not believe it.The system appeared to have vanished. It did not reply.\u201cIs it?\u201d Su Ping could not help but ask again.Still, zero replies.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Su Ping stood up at once, hopping mad. \u201cI treat you as a legitimate system and you treat me as a pet?!\u201d\u201cI #\u00a5%...\u201d\u201cFirst time!\u201d\u201cNow you talk, huh? I #\u00a5...\u201d\u201cSecond time!\u201d\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t even say alert anymore? Sh*t...\u201dBuzzing, buzzing!Electric arcs danced in the dark shop. The once active figure turned stiff, twitched and fell to the ground.Su Ping was groaning, \u201cTo h*ll with you...\u201d\u201cFirst time!\u201d\u201c...\u201dSu decided to keep quiet.As the dull pain faded away slowly, Su Ping crawled up and sat down in sadness. He wanted to take out a cigarette from his pocket, only to realize that he didn\u2019t buy a pack. He heaved a sigh. \u201cI know that you\u2019re not going to show me. But at the very least you should tell me, how close am I from being eliminated?\u201d\u201cThe host doesn\u2019t have to worry. The passing score is 60 and the warning line is 70. The system will alarm the host when the score drops to 70. Currently, the host is doing well.\u201dSu Ping was relieved. There was a 10 point buffer in the score. That was good.Su Ping got up and looked at the time. He knew that it was already 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. when he came back from the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. It was 11 p.m. by then. Having been lost in cultivation, before he realized it, four hours had passed.\u201cI should head back. My mom will be worried if I am too late.\u201d Su Ping patted the dust off his pants, packed his stuff, opened the shutter door, and headed home....His mother Li Qingru was the only one sitting in the living room by the time he arrived.\u201cBe quiet,\u201d Li Qingru whispered to Su Ping once she heard him coming in, \u201cYour sister is cultivating upstairs. She\u2019s contending in the academy tournament these days. Don\u2019t disturb her.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Su Ping nodded. \u201cI\u2019m starving.\u201d\u201cWash up first. I will heat the dishes for you.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dWhile she wasn\u2019t his biological mother in the real sense, Su Ping felt she was kind and friendly. Everything was beautiful, except that...\u201cMom, why is there only green pepper in the diced chicken dish?\u201d\u201cNonsense. There\u2019s some chicken in there. The rest was eaten by your sister.\u201d\u201c...Mom, where are there only potatoes and fat meat in this stewed pork with brown sauce?\u201d\u201cYour sister is busy cultivating. She needs nutrients.\u201d\u201c...Then, what do I have left?\u201d\u201cHere\u2019s a plate of vegetables.\u201d\u201c...\u201dSu Ping dragged himself upstairs to his room, physically and emotionally exhausted. He wasn\u2019t able to relax even once since he came back from the Chaotic Realm of the Undead.\u201cI should cultivate for a bit. I\u2019ll be able to sleep soundly when I\u2019m done...\u201dWith a natural and unrestrained move, Su Ping threw himself to the cozy bed. He closed his eyes and felt the astral power around him. All of a sudden, he sensed that the scope of perception had extended far beyond the two-meter radius compared to when he was cultivating before.His consciousness became a sphere that spread out. He could see all the astral power floating in the air.\u201cWhat?\u201dSu Ping noticed all of a sudden that the astral power was being pulled out of his room.His consciousness followed the astral power. He saw that all the astral power was pouring into the room across the hallway; that was his sister Su Lingyue\u2019s room.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His consciousness sneaked in quietly.The astral power seeped into Su Lingyue\u2019s room from the cracks in the walls and doors like quicksand. The astral power in the other rooms were floating faster, converging like a vortex.The center of the convergence was a slim figure that could be faintly seen amid the astral power. It was none other than Su Lingyue.\u201cIs she also lying on her bed to cultivate?\u201d Su Ping raised his eyebrows as he saw the figure outlined by the astral power.Right then, Su Ping noticed that her sister was using a completely different way to absorb astral power.Inside Su Lingyue\u2019s room, she was like the bottom of an hour-glass. All the astral power that flew into her room were pulled over, gradually forming a vortex. The closer the astral power was to her, the faster they would spin. Eventually, all the astral power was sucked in by her body.\u201cShe\u2019s absorbing faster and in a larger amount!\u201d\u201cIs she controlling the speed of absorption?\u201cIs this what they learn at the Academy of Astral Pets?\u201dSu Ping had tried many methods but failed to hasten the absorption of astral power. He had assumed that the speed could never be altered. However, Su Lingyue\u2019s cultivation revealed to him something new.While surprised, Su Ping began to examine her ways closely.Soon, Su Ping noticed that the major location where the astral power was absorbed into was the dantian in her abdomen. Inside her dantian, there was a small astral power vortex!This astral power vortex was spinning quickly, creating a strong pull which made the astral power outside of her spin as well. That was how the large vortex outside of her came into being!The pull of this external vortex could influence a large area. The astral power that was beyond the reach of her consciousness could be pulled over as well. They would fly over and become a part of the external vortex, to be rapidly absorbed by Su Lingyue!\u201cIt\u2019s because of the pull!\u201dSu Ping stumbled with the fact.How easy it was. How come he didn\u2019t think of it before?Indeed, his consciousness could not control the astral power roaming outside, only the astral power inside of him!\u201cLet me have a try.\u201dSu Ping retracted his consciousness back to his room, limiting the reach of his consciousness to his bed.He controlled all the vortices inside all the original cores in his cells to spin around quickly.Buzzing!All of a sudden, it was as if a hurricane had sprung up by his bed out of nowhere. The bedsheet started to float as a result.The free astral power that was floating toward Su Lingyue\u2019s room was disturbed at once. It was disorderly sneaking into Su Ping\u2019s body in a state of feverish chaos.\u201cWhat?\u201dSu Ping was surprised. He stopped the spinning at once.\u201cThe astral power is in chaos. Is it because there are too many pulling sources making a mess?\u201d Su Ping frowned. All the vortices spinning around in his original cores was confusing the subtle astral power.After some thought, Su Ping decided to copy Su Lingyue\u2019s method, creating a large vortex in a place inside his body.Whoosh!The astral power that was slowly moving toward Su Lingyue\u2019s room stopped all of a sudden. Under some pulling effect, the astral power turned around and flew toward Su Ping\u2019s dantian in his abdomen while moving in a vortex shape.\u201cGot it!\u201dSu Ping was glad to feel the vortex structure outside his body.At the moment, he noticed that all the astral power from Su Lingyue\u2019s room was being pulled away, wisp by wisp.\u201cThe pull of my vortex is stronger than hers?\u201d Su Ping was surprised. He stopped at once.\u201cWhat?\u201dWhile in her room, lying in bed as she was cultivating and reading at the same time, Su Lingyue was startled by a sudden tremor in the astral power vortex outside of her.When she stopped to pay closer attention, the vortex had already returned to normal. She thought she was having an illusion.\u201cStrange.\u201d Su Lingyue was confused but she didn\u2019t think too much into it since things had returned to normal. She held onto a throw pillow and Snowball to get back inside the world of her book.It wasn\u2019t a boring reading material, or else she wouldn\u2019t have continued reading by lamplight. It was one her favorite youth comics with righteous-ardor stories.Different from other girls, she had no interest in romance TV, movies or comics. After all, with such a lousy brother, any fantasy she had about boys had been shattered entirely!\u201cDidn\u2019t she feel it?\u201dSu Ping noticed no reaction from his sister. He blinked. Such being the case, he could try out something else.Having observed the cultivation methodology Su Lingyue had learned in the academy, Su Ping\u2019s mind was wide open in the field of cultivation of astral power.Since he could create a vortex inside him to absorb and cultivate astral power, maybe, he could create a reverse vortex. He wondered what that would do.\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201dWith the experience of cultivating the \u201cChaos Star Chart,\u201d Su Ping had become quite skilled in creating \u201cvortices.\u201d He controlled the reaching scope of his consciousness around him to no further than the bed. Then, he quickly reversed the spinning direction of the vortex.Soon, there was one more vortex in his dantian. This vortex was not pulling astral power in. Instead, the vortex was pushing the astral power away. He was inside an area void of astral power.\u201cJust as I thought.\u201dSu Ping was pretty much right. He was excited. While the power-free area seemed to be useless, this was a successful attempt.The astral power being pushed away was flying to Su Lingyue\u2019s room faster than before, which was surprising to Su Ping. He had a fresh idea in his mind.\u201cIf so, with two vortices...\u201dSu Ping blinked. His idea was difficult but that made it a challenge.He resorted to action at once.First, he would start with a small-scale attempt...Soon, Su Ping created two vortices inside him, one in front, one at the back, one spinning forward, and the other in the reverse direction.In the air outside the wall behind him, a large amount of free astral power was pulled into his back but he did not absorb it. It was released from his chest.His body was like a bridge where astral power converged, to later deliver it in wisps.The astral power that had been compressed inside Su Ping became more concentrated and it was being pulled into the vortex inside Su Lingyue\u2019s room.\u201cHuh?\u201dSu Lingyue, who was reading the comics, suddenly felt a spread of warmth in her stomach. It was quite comfortable. She felt warm all around her body, as if she were in a hot spring. She couldn\u2019t help but hum in comfort.As the sound came out from her mouth, she came back to her senses. She tried to feel it carefully. To her surprise, she was surrounded by this warmth because the astral power became more profound by several times all of a sudden!\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dSu Lingyue sat up, shocked. How come the astral power became richer all of a sudden?62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That compressed astral power was more condensed than the drifting astral power.As such, Su Ping was helping others to improve their astral power cultivation!He had mastered another skill but...\u201cThe effect is just as I have imagined. But this ability is of absolutely no use. I cannot even satisfy my own cultivation needs. Why would I have time to feed others like a fool?\u201dSu Ping shook his head. He stopped the export of astral power from the vortex in his chest.\u201cDid it stop?\u201dSu Lingyue was about to stand up and check when she noticed that the richness of astral power in her room had returned to normal. That, she did not expect.\u201cI have heard from my teacher that the astral power around some powerful experts is incredibly strong. Did a powerful person walk past the window just now?\u201dSu Lingyue was surprised. She got up and lifted the curtain with cartoon bears, then she opened the window to look outside.Their house was by the road. It was the dead of night; nobody was walking in the street.Su Lingyue was confused. She paid closer attention. The astral power had returned normal, so she failed to pick up any clues.\u201cHe must have left.\u201d Su Lingyue was disappointed and frustrated.The ones that could increase the richness of astral power around them were the best battle pet warriors. They were idols admired by many. It was a pity that she had missed seeing such powerful warriors who had passed by her window.\u201cBut, there will be a day when I will become one of the best powerful warriors!\u201d Su Lingyue promised herself with her chin raised. Then, she closed the curtains, hopped onto her bed, and let herself sink back into her comics.\u201cLet\u2019s try vortex synchronization.\u201dIn his room, Su Ping tried out many ways to cultivate. It was the first time he had experienced astral power and he was very interested in it. He tested out many different ideas, abandoning himself to the pleasure of it.Halfway through, Su Ping noticed that Su Lingyue seemed to have stopped in the room across the hall. She must have fallen asleep.Su Ping looked at the time. It was late, two in the morning.\u201cI should turn in as well or I won\u2019t be able to get up tomorrow. I can try more things when I get to the store.\u201dSu Ping yawned and stopped trying new things. He created a regular vortex inside of him to continue the common way of cultivation. At the same time, he took out his phone and searched for some lousy movies to lull himself to sleep.In less than five minutes, he had fallen asleep....\u201cTime to get up,\u201d an overly sweet and sexy voice said to him.Su Ping opened his eyes slowly. He saw some light. The day had come.He rubbed his eyes and turned around toward the voice. A ghost face with blood all over it leaped into his eyes.Compared with before, this ghost face was bleeding more violently and there seemed to be some maggots crawling.\u201cDid she have to be so disgusting so early in the morning?\u201cIs she trying to affect my appetite so she can eat my breakfast?\u201dHaving experienced the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, Su Ping had become immune to such stuff. Compared to the strange things in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, this ghost face was beautiful enough to feast the eyes.\u201cMwah.\u201d Su Ping threw the ghost a kiss.\u201cGee!\u201dIt wasn\u2019t the voice of a question, but the sound of contempt.Su Ping raised his eyebrows and threw a look at the girl by the door. \u201cCan\u2019t you make something new? Aren\u2019t you bored?\u201d\u201cDisgusting!\u201d Su Lingyue gave him a scornful stare. How could he accept this? He was a pervert indeed!Su Ping rolled his eyes as he noticed how she disliked him. Why couldn\u2019t he give that ghost face a kiss when you made your Phantom Flame Beast become that ghost face? Could you be reasonable?\u201dSu Ping was not in the mood to bicker with her. He resorted to the ultimate skill to get rid of her. He lifted his quilt and said, \u201cI slept in the nude.\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dAll he heard was a sneer.Su Ping was surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s not like I haven\u2019t seen it before. What\u2019s the big deal of sleeping nude?\u201d Su Lingyue did not care.\u201c...\u201dSu Ping was embarrassed. His head was buzzing.\u201cShe had seen it? When was that?\u201dWhy was there no memory of it at all in the original owner\u2019s head?Right. They ran around naked when they were kids...\u201cYou still remember that thing when we were so young?\u201d Su Ping was astounded.\u201cDo you think that my head is like your pig\u2019s head? I am a genius. A genius, do you understand?\u201d Su Lingyue sneered. She waved her hand. A black ball snuck out from his bed. It was that Phantom Flame Beast named \u201cSnowball.\u201dThe Phantom Flame Beast crawled up with effort; it glared at Su Ping and then hopped back onto Su Lingyue\u2019s shoulder.Slam!Su Lingyue turned around and slammed the door shut.\u201cIt seems like compromise is no longer working? Do I have to return violence with violence?\u201d Su Ping looked at the trembling door. He shook his head and heaved a sigh.By the time he got dressed and went downstairs for breakfast, Su Lingyue had almost finished hers.\u201cYueyue, have you finished breakfast?\u201d\u201cHurry up. We need to leave now.\u201dSome girls were saying outside the door.Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He saw three girls about the same age as Su Lingyue. Her classmates for sure.\u201cComing.\u201d Su Lingyue put on her coat very quickly.Su Ping frowned. The voice Su Lingyue used was completely different when she talked to him, rude to say the least. At the moment, her voice was refreshing, soft and pleasant at the same time. Anyone would picture her as a polite fair lady by the sound of her voice alone.Soon, Su Lingyue changed her clothes and left with her classmates.They had stepped into the yard but Su Ping could still hear them. After all, he no longer had the constitution of an average person. His hearing was quite acute.\u201cIs he that good-for-nothing brother you told us about?\u201d\u201cHe appears to be dispirited.\u201d\u201cHe looks useless but he\u2019s handsome. Yueyue, your family has such nice genes.\u201dThe girls were chatting.\u201cDispirited?\u201dSu Ping was speechless. \u201cWhat made you think I was dispirited?\u201dThose people didn\u2019t even have the basic ability of proper judgment but their aesthetic judgment was godly. As such, they could be forgiven.\u201cThis sister of mine is quite popular amongst my classmates. But that is just a false appearance. Only I know about her true self!\u201dSu Ping snorted. He finished up his breakfast quickly, bade farewell to his mother, and rode to the store.At the store, Su Ping asked the system to evaluate all the pet food he brought back from the Chaotic Realm of the Undead.That included the blood-red bead he snatched from the throne of bones.The pet food came in many different sorts but the system had no difficulty in identifying them. Soon, the price list was presented to him.\u201cMany good items.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t know all the items but he could recognize their value just from the pricing. The average price was around seven to eight hundred coins. Only a few had a price lower than five hundred coins!Of course, there were a couple of food items that were of little value, with a price of merely a few dozen coins.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Bloodline of Skeleton KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41: Bloodline of Skeleton KingSu Ping looked past the varieties of pet food with prices of only three-digit numbers and went straight to check the most valuable.\u201cPurple Bamboo Yin Flower, 26,000 coins per flower.\u201d\u201cGhost Core, 10,000 coins per core.\u201d\u201cHaunted Lotus, the price is... 1,200,000 coins!\u201dSu Ping counted the many zeroes. Indeed, the price was 1.2 million coins!He was struggling for breath.The price was 1.2 million coins!This could be converted to 12,000 energy points!The money made from this \u201cHaunted Lotus\u201d alone could have made up for the 9,000 energy points entrance fee to the Chaotic Realm of the Undead and the extra 3,000 energy points would be net profit made!Considering that his last access was free of charge, all of the 9,000 energy points were net income!\u201cThe Haunted Lotus is crystallized inside a skeleton being of the king level. It contains a strong undead aura which can help an advanced undead pet rise by one rank directly!\u201d\u201cWhen pets of the ninth rank consume this, there is a 5% chance that they can evolve into a beast king directly!\u201dSu Ping was stunned by the power of the plant.This was a treasure that could help an advanced pet rise in rank!\u201cHow precious this is!\u201dSu Ping was both surprised and delighted. Treasures that could help a pet advance were few and far between, and those that could apply to advanced pets were even rarer!\u201cI remember I picked this up by the gate of an ancient hall. The Little Skeleton found it first.\u201dSu Ping still had a vague memory of how he came by this pet food. It was during countless deaths. Randomly, he was revived in an ancient hall. The Little Skeleton found this plant inside a huge skeleton that was over 10 meters tall by the gate.Su Ping assumed that this plant was very likely to be useful, given how strongly the Little Skeleton longed for it and how pleased the Little Skeleton was. So, he grabbed the plant and it turned out to be a real treasure.The unfortunate side was that not long after they picked this plant up, they were murdered by some unknown force before they could explore other areas.Then, determined, Su Ping chose to revive on the spot for over a dozen times. Every time he was brought back to life, he would be wiped out mercilessly at once. He accomplished nothing. He didn\u2019t even see his enemy before he had to leave that place.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize that the stuff I picked up randomly turned out to be this valuable. On the contrary, the pet food that was guarded by other monsters and I took great effort to collect are garbage!\u201dSu Ping remembered some of the pet food vividly but those items only had a price of a few hundred, which made him unhappy. He wished he could have more discerning eyes. The pet food identification spell was poor.On the shelf, other than the \u201cHaunted Lotus,\u201d there were other pet food varieties that would be sold at dozens of thousands and each of them had different miraculous effects.Su Ping got the calculator and added up the prices of all the pet food. The total amounted to more than 4.5 million coins!That was to say, if he could sell everything, he would have 45,000 energy points!,000 energy points...That would be enough for him to upgrade the Chaos Spirit Pool to the third level!With a third-level spirit pool, there was a slight chance that a pet with a beast king\u2019s bloodline could be bred!\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that most of it is food for undead pets which are not that popular. Not many people would use such pets. I assume the sales will go slowly.\u201dSu Ping frowned as he noticed this issue.\u201cGirls nowadays prefer those adorable \u201cmultifunctional\u201d pets that could fight, act cute and cuddle.\u201dThe pets of the undead family, while strong in combat, had miserable looks. Such pets would either be some dead beings, skeletons, or ghosts whose faces would be covered in blood. Anyone that sent them out to battle would blush in embarrassment, fearing that people would think they had unhealthy minds.People were shallow beings, only judging a book by its cover.Naturally, the pets that lived with people would be affected thusly as well.\u201cBut, if humans don\u2019t judge people by their looks, then what\u2019s the point of me being so handsome?\u201dSu Ping reconciled with this fact soon.That pet food was hard to sell, but they would leave the shelves one day as long as the quality was good.He piled the pet food on the counter and sorted it out. Then, Su Ping shifted his attention to that blood-red bead.The system had identified this item. It was called the \u201cBlood Bead.\u201d This was a mundane name but the value was far from being mundane. The price was set at 15 million coins!That\u2019s right. It was 15 million coins in price, over 10 times more than the price of the Haunted Lotus!This bead was the most valuable item he had harvested during this trip!To be exact, this Blood Bead was not a kind of food. But according to the system, anything that could be consumed was categorized as pet food!The Blood Bead was from within the Skeleton King, the crystallization of life inside the Skeleton King, equal to the placenta found in pregnant women!Its effect was simple, to convert any skeleton-related being to one with the Skeleton King bloodline!A Skeleton King had the royal bloodline in the skeleton family. This royal family was unrelated to Beast Kings, but it was one of the noblest and strongest bloodlines!Su Ping didn\u2019t count this Blood Bead as one of the pet foods. He didn\u2019t plan to sell it, even though 15 million was... a tremendous amount that no regular person could have made within a lifetime!He could always make more money, but such treasures would only come by once in a blue moon!As far as Su Ping could tell, the Skeleton King bloodline would be worth far beyond 15 million. It was just the system that was big-budgeted.\u201cI believe profits will pour in from all sides as long as I have the strength.\u201dAt a top-level cultivation plane like the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, Su Ping had come across many horrible monsters and some other beings that had been living there for who knows how long. He had seen the vast world, the unbounded world.Strength was the only thing that could secure fame throughout eternity!\u201cI can give this Blood Bead to the Little Skeleton. Its aptitude has already been rated as above average, far superior to the other low-rank pets of the undead family. If the Little Skeleton can obtain the Skeleton King\u2019s bloodline, this will make its capability come into fuller play!\u201dSu Ping was not stingy. Only by becoming stronger could he obtain more items. Saving money would be putting the cart before the horse.Besides, hypothetically, he could sell the Blood Bead and obtain 150,000 energy points, but he would not use the energy points at the moment. To upgrade the Chaos Spirit Pool, he would have to spend a million energy points. There was a long way to go. For him, the energy points that he could get from selling the other pet food were enough as it was.If he had to, he could pay for a visit to another cultivation plane.Su Ping went to the pet room. The Little Skeleton and the Lightning Rat were sleeping soundly in the nursing pens.Su Ping approached the Little Skeleton to wake it up and hand it the Blood Bead.When the Little Skeleton saw this Blood Bead, crimson color glowed in its eyes. It was exceptionally glad.As the Little Skeleton took over the Blood Bead, it stuffed the bead into its head. Soon, the bead began to spin in the Little Skeleton\u2019s head as if the bead was being embedded in the skull. The energy-like blood streaks flowed around the Little Skeleton, gradually changing its bloodline.In the Little Skeleton\u2019s consciousness, it was gesticulating with hands and feet happily.Su Ping smiled as he felt the excitement coming from the Little Skeleton and patted its little head. Only this time, he could not break the Little Skeleton\u2019s neck so easily.\u201cLittle fellow, I will have to count on you from now on.\u201d Su Ping smiled.The Little Skeleton seemed to have understood him. The Little Skeleton nodded and pulled out the bone dagger from its hipbone and waved it, trying to prove that it was reliable.Su Ping asked the Little Skeleton to go back to sleep while he headed back to the store. He waited for customers to come as he continued the unfinished tests from the previous night.Time zipped by.Few customers stopped by that day. There was one but when he came to the counter for information and saw the price of at least dozens or hundreds of the many items on the shelf, he turned around and fled in fright at once.For the next two days, more customers came but he sold nothing.On the third day.As usual, Su Ping came to the store. He dusted the counter and began to work on his cultivation.Not long afterward, some customers showed up.\u201cSir, we\u2019re here to pick up my pets,\u201d someone with a fresh and sweet sound said.Su Ping raised his head. It was the two girls again.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Sentimentally AttachedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42: Sentimentally AttachedSu Yanying was glad to see the signboard of the \u201cPixie Pet Store.\u201d She was excited and looked forward to coming to this mysterious shop again. She had been missing the place.She had been separated from her pets for three days. She could not wait to give those little darlings a hug.Even though...Those guys were not little. They were so huge that she had to hold her head up high just to look at them.But to her, those pets were her babies. She bought some of the pets when they were cubs and raised them. Some of the pets grew up quickly. They reached adulthood in three to five years and grew from a size where she could pick them up easily to one that she could ride them.\u201cI wonder if the owner has been taking good care of your pets.\u201dLan Lele came with Su Yanying as her escort again and to supervise. After all, they had spent a fortune last time they visited. They couldn\u2019t afford to be fooled by that owner.Su Ping stopped cultivating when the two stepped into the store. \u201cWait here,\u201d he said with a poker face.With that said, Su Ping went to the pet room in the back to wake up the Lightning Rat and the other three pets.\u201cCome on out.\u201dSu Ping told the pets to step out of the nursing pens.The pets dawdled their way out from the nursing pens reluctantly as they sensed Su Ping\u2019s determined will.As soon as they stepped away from the nursing pens, the pets were reconnected to Su Yanying\u2019s astral power contract. They could feel each other\u2019s presence.\u201cIt\u2019s them.\u201d Su Yanying\u2019s eyes glowed. She was happy that she could tell her pets were just in the back, a wall away from her.She stood on tiptoe, looking with anticipation.After several minutes, she finally saw her pets slowly step out from the pet room; they would stop every now and then to look back as if something behind them was appealing and they were unwilling to be away from it.Su Yanying was surprised.From the astral power contract, she could sense vividly how reluctant her pets were. They had not seen each other for a long time. How could her pets be attracted to something else and not become excited to see her?Had they become attached to this place?\u201cGo on. Go.\u201d Su Ping waved his hand impatiently.Those pets were intelligent. They looked at him with their watery eyes, begging.Su Ping was not in the mood to gaze into their eyes. He hurried them on.The pets were sad. They returned to Su Yanying, down in the dumps. When they saw their own master, they rubbed against her as a welcoming sign and then lay prone on the floor, feeling blue.Su Yanying was surprised since she could sense the frustration in her pets.This wasn\u2019t the meeting she had pictured.Shouldn\u2019t they run to her, wild with joy?Shouldn\u2019t they dance and hop around her in happiness?Why would they be depressed when they saw their master?Su Yanying darted a look at the Lightning Rat by her foot. Last time she had visited, the Lightning Rat was overjoyed to see her. It was also in a bad mood at the moment.\u201cWhy...?\u201d For a moment, Su Yanying did not know what to say. She felt that the situation was unfair and an urge to cry was bubbling up.Su Ping was surprised to feel how upset and reluctant the pets were but he could understand.The elementary nursing pens were built with spirit stones. The pets were being nurtured by the anima at all times. What the pets felt in the nursing pens was similar to what people felt when soaking in a hot spring during winter. It was already nice that pets were not furious after being dragged out all of a sudden.Lan Lele noticed something was off about the pets. She questioned Su Ping, \u201cSir, why are they so lifeless?\u201dSu Ping pulled a long face. \u201cWhy should I know?\u201d\u201cYou took care of them. Why don\u2019t you know?\u201d Lan Lele\u2019s face was clouded with anger.Su Ping put on a sarcastic grin. \u201cSo, if I take care of you for a couple of days, I should know all your emotions as well?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Lan Lele stomped her feet in fury.Su Yanying came back to her senses. She put herself between the two arguing people and apologized to Su Ping. \u201cSir, I am sorry. My friend has a short temper.\u201d\u201cYingying, something is wrong here,\u201d Lan Lele cautioned her.Su Yanying shook her head. \u201cI just feel that they are unwilling to be parted from here. It means that they like the place. That is to say, instead of treating them unfairly, the owner is taking good care of them. I should thank the owner.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lan Lele did not understand. \u201cUnwilling to leave? They are unwilling to leave here?\u201dThis was hardly imaginable. How could the pets become emotionally attached to that place after a couple of days of boarding?Su Ping did not enter into contracts with the pets. Even if they had emotional bonds built with the astral power contract, at the very beginning, the pets and their masters would not be close. The pets would only be following orders. Once the contract was removed, the pets and the masters would be completely unrelated.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201dSu Yanying forced a smile. She could not understand it, either. Only if Su Ping treated the pets extremely nicely would the pets become attached, which implied that this was a reputable pet store!Lan Lele stood there, stunned. She believed that Su Yanying would not lie to her and would not defend the owner. Lan Lele knew that she must have misunderstood the owner.Lan Lele cast a glance at Su Ping whose face was still grim. The apology stopped on the tip of her tongue. She pretended that nothing had happened and shifted her look toward the pets.\u201cTheir wounds seemed to have healed.\u201dLan Lele was sure that Su Yanying did not lie to her upon a closer check. Except for the fact that the pets were in a lousy mood, their wounds had recovered, and they seemed to be healthier than before. Their fur was in a brighter color and the flames on the feathers of the Fallen Phoenix were burning with more intensity. She could tell that the pets were taken good care of.Su Yanying nodded. She had noticed this before. The healer told her that her pets would recover after three days. But she could tell that the pets had not just recovered. The pets were healed at the store. They weren\u2019t just fed.As for what Su Ping mentioned about improving their power of understanding and bettering their constitution, for now, Su Yanying could not find out. She was satisfied with the fact that they had recovered.\u201cI wonder how the training went.\u201dSu Yanying cast her looks at the Lightning Rat by her foot. She crouched down to pet its head to comfort it.While she was patting the Lightning Rat, she noticed that its fur\u2019s color was deeper, having shifted to a blackish color from that dark purple.Besides, maybe this was just in her mind, but she felt that her other pets were unwilling to come near the Lightning Rat who was the nearest to her. The other three pets were two to three meters away from her, unwilling to come close. They weren\u2019t like this in the past.\u201cSir, is it quite different from before?\u201d Su Yanying lifted her eyes to him.Su Ping answered coldly, \u201cIts strength has been improved by several folds, at the very least.\u201dWhile the rating for combat strength was only doubled, that was a digit only, not the Lightning Rat\u2019s true strength!Improving from the third rank to the seventh rank represented an increase in strength of more than a dozen times. Not even a hundred third-rank pets or more could defeat a seventh-rank pet!That was why he thought the system\u2019s quests were unreasonable...\u201cSeveral times stronger?\u201d Su Yanying did not believe this.Lan Lele opened her eyes wide, wondering if Su Ping had chosen the wrong words.The Lightning Rat was much stronger than before after merely three days of training?Did Su Ping consider himself a master trainer?Not even master trainers could boast such things, unless some secret ways were applied to the Lightning Rat. But who would make such a big fuss with a Lightning Rat? What they paid did not deserve that increase.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Training Effect TestPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43: Training Effect Test\u201cSir, are you being serious?\u201d Su Yanying could not help but voice her doubt. She felt that Su Ping might be joking or was plainly mocking them. After all, the expression on his grim face didn\u2019t appear to be friendly.\u201cHmm. Interesting.\u201dSu Ping was not in the mood to defend himself against their disbelief. He whistled at the Lightning Rat who was by her foot and sent over instructions through his consciousness using astral power, \u201cThunder Shadow Image!\u201dEven without the contract, the Lightning Rat acted by reflex after sensing Su Ping\u2019s consciousness. Electric arcs burst out from the Lightning Rat and two more Lightning Rats that were surrounded by lightning emerged.There were three in total!Each Lightning Rat was doing something different. One was looking around, one ran to the door, and the other one stayed by Su Yanying\u2019s foot.\u201cWhat... Multiple Thunder Shadow Image?!\u201dBoth Su Yanying and Lan Lele were stunned by what they saw.Two cloned shadows could be created?Besides, the three Lightning Rats were acting differently. This was not something that the average Thunder Shadow Image could have managed. The cloned images were lifelike!\u201cSuch a lazy bone...\u201d Su Ping was unhappy since merely two images were created but he did not push the Lightning Rat. After all, this Multiple Thunder Shadow Image alone was well worth the 10,000 coins paid.\u201cThe Thunder Shadow Image is an advanced pet skill. Now, it has been upgraded!\u201d\u201cThis... is amazing!\u201dSu Yanying and Lan Lele\u2019s faces were covered in astonishment. It was rare that the Lightning Rat could learn the \u201cThunder Shadow Image.\u201d It had even been upgraded to \u201cMultiple Thunder Shadow Image.\u201d That wasn\u2019t something many advanced pets of the thunder family could have done!It took them a while to get back to reality. When they lifted their eyes to Su Ping again, the looks were different from before.They were convinced that there had to be a master trainer in the store, one who could upgrade an advanced pet skill within three days.Who were master trainers?They were people that even a ninth-rank battle pet warrior with a title should treat politely.Lan Lele blushed as she thought of her previous attitude and she was afraid as well. Regardless of Su Ping\u2019s cold face, she lowered her head. \u201cSir, I have misjudged you. I am sorry...\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dSu Ping did not mind what happened before. \u201cIs there anything else you need? Like pet food?\u201d he asked.The two didn\u2019t see this question coming. They looked at the counter behind Su Ping. The corner of their eyes twitched violently when they saw the price of the pet food.\u201cWell...\u201dSu Yanying was hesitating.On the other hand, the fact that her Lightning Rat could experience such a drastic change was entirely because of this pet store.She bit her teeth to force out some words, \u201cI don\u2019t have much money with me. Sir, how about you recommend some of the cheaper pet food?\u201d\u201cHow much do you have?\u201d Su Ping asked.\u201cI have 1500 coins,\u201d Su Yanying said honestly.\u201cLet\u2019s go with this.\u201d Su Ping turned around to choose. He just happened to find a Fire Grass that the Fallen Phoenix could eat. \u201cThat will be 1200 coins.\u201dSu Yanying felt her eyelids twitch as she saw this red grass that was less than 10 centimeters long. One blade of grass was sold at 1200 coins...She made up her mind after thinking about the Lightning Rat\u2019s progress and paid for the grass.Lan Lele knew what her friend was thinking and did not stop her. Lan Lele thought this could be regarded as thanks for the Lightning Rat\u2019s training.Su Ping placed the grass in a transparent bottle and gave it to Su Yanying.Su Yanying took over the grass and placed it in her messenger bag without looking. Then, she expressed her appreciation to Su Ping again for his training.Her thanks were sincere. After she witnessed the Multiple Thunder Shadow Image demonstration, she was completely convinced that the Lightning Rat had been trained there.Without the Lightning Rat, even if she had fought with the Fanged Tiger, she would have lost in the preliminary matches.She would have been embarrassed. To make it worse, such loss could affect her career after graduation. It was safe to say that this store had helped her.The two girls thanked him effusively. From this, Su Ping felt his hard work had paid off.As he watched them leave, something stuck in Su Ping\u2019s throat\u2014words that he failed to utter. \u201cDon\u2019t just say thank you. Why didn\u2019t you pay me more money...\u201d......Having picked up their pets, Lan Lele and Su Yanying hurried back to the academy.They arrived at the gate and looked at the time, relieved to see it was only 10:00 in the morning.\u201cYingying, slow down. Your turn will come up at 11:30. We still have time.\u201d Lan Lele was struggling for breath and her cheeks blushed.Su Yanying was filled with excitement, \u201cI want to go to the training ground to see how they are doing.\u201d\u201cSure. I will go with you.\u201d Lan Lele\u2019s eyes glowed as she thought of that Lightning Rat as well.Soon, they had arrived at the training ground in the academy. The training ground was large; it had twenty different venues of various environments, such as forests, furnace hearths, waterways and others.People could choose different training venues according to their pet types.Also, there were the regular comprehensive training venues with a common environment, one that the battle pet warriors would often come across outside. After all, nobody would only fight in the environment they were more familiar with. Therefore, combat abilities demonstrated in the common environment were more important!At the moment, most of the students were watching the games at the stadium. So, Su Yanying did not have to wait in the line for a turn.Su Yanying stepped to the machine by the door to log onto her student account, deduct the credit and pick the venue.She chose a common venue with a 2v2 model.Lan Lele did the same thing. She logged on her student account, had the credit deducted, and then she was invited into the team.Since there was no line, after they made their choice, they saw the number of the venue the system had assigned to them, 08.Su Yanying and Lan Lele headed in together.\u201cYingying, let\u2019s try your Lightning Rat!\u201d Lan Lele was itchy to try. It interested her just to think that she could fight with a Lightning Rat that had mastered advanced pet skills.Lan Lele unleashed her contract power to summon her strongest pet, Earth Buddha!This pet of the rock family with an advanced bloodline was made of rocks; it was human-like, and was named the Earth Buddha because it looked like an ancient Buddha.\u201cSuch a dirty trick!\u201d Su Yanying said grumpily.The Earth Buddha had not reached adulthood yet, and was not an advanced pet in the real sense but it was a fifth-rank one already!Lan Lele was being deliberately dishonest by sending out a fifth-rank pet to fight against Su Yanying\u2019s Lightning Rat, when the Earth Buddha could be the Lightning Rat\u2019s mortal enemy!Still, since this was a practice, Su Yanying wanted to find out if the Lightning Rat\u2019s Multiple Thunder Shadow Image could fool a fifth-rank pet.\u201cAstral Shield!\u201dLan Lele stuck out her tongue at her friend. As soon as she entered the venue, she established her astral shield. Previously, the Lightning Rat had lured away the enemy pet and snuck up on the battle pet warrior to secure the final win. Therefore, Lan Lele was putting her guards up as a precaution.Su Yanying snorted gently and said to the Lightning Rat next to her, \u201cGo ahead!\u201dThe Lightning Rat sensed its master\u2019s battle will. Its lazy-bone-state changed in an instant. Neither of the girls noticed that from its small rat eyes darted out a bloodthirsty and cold glare, one that belied an extremely crazy killing intent!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She lifted her hand and the power of the blast was added to aid the Earth Buddha. A whirlwind span around the Earth Buddha to make it lighter and more flexible.\u201cRoar!\u201dThe Earth Buddha was standing on one foot like an old monk meditating. Having felt its master\u2019s will, the Earth Buddha set down the other foot. The four eyes on its face were opened all of a sudden as the roar was let out!This roar was like one from Buddha\u2019s fury, full of deterrence.Usually, a low-rank pet would have flinched upon hearing this roar. After all, this was the most basic deterrence skill mastered by an advanced pet that could completely overwhelm low-rank pets. while the Earth Buddha had not reached adulthood or the most advanced level, its roar could be already appalling.Su Yanying looked at the Lightning Rat in front of her. Its hair stood up in terror.However, from the emotions she felt in the Lightning Rat, she detected a strong intention to fight which was so wild that she found it hard to control, as if the Lightning Rat were going to run away.\u201cUnsteady Ground!\u201dLan Lele made the first move and told the Earth Buddha to attack first.Bang!The ground in front of the Earth Buddha burst open all of a sudden and the crack reached toward the Lightning Rat and Su Yanying.The image of the Earth Buddha was reflected in those blood-thirsty, reddened eyes of the Lightning Rat. The desire for blood surged out. After the impact of countless killings, the moment the Lightning Rat entered the battle, its will for harvesting blood had reached the extreme.To battle was to kill the enemies!That was something the Lightning Rat had learned.When the Lightning Rat was about to do something, it felt some instructions coming its way. \u201cUse the Multiple Thunder Shadow Image now!\u201dThat instruction came from Su Yanying.The moment the Earth Buddha initiated the attack, Su Yanying had decided to let the Lightning Rat apply its strongest skill, the Multiple Thunder Shadow Image.She intended to find out if the Lightning Rat\u2019s \u201cMultiple Thunder Shadow Image\u201d could fool the Earth Buddha. As for defeating the Earth Buddha? She never thought that could be possible.After all, the Earth Buddha was a fifth-rank pet. While Lan Lele herself was not famous for her combat strength, the strength of her pets was well-known in the academy!The reason that Lan Lele could not show her capabilities in the tournament was that she loved to have fun and her skill as a battle pet warrior was inferior.The pet\u2019s strength was not the only factor that mattered. The battle pet warriors\u2019 mastery and command were important as well. An outstanding battle pet warrior could support their pets and even enable them to take on others of a higher rank!When the Lightning Rat received Su Yanying\u2019s instructions, the former seemed to be struggling to hang on to its desire for blood. However, the power of the contract stipulated that the Lightning Rat had to follow orders from the battle pet warrior. The energy surging inside the Lightning Rat changed directions and several figures surrounded by lightning dashed out.In an instant, three Lightning Rats appeared in the venue.However, the three Lightning Rats were not running in different directions. Instead, all of them were charging toward the Earth Buddha. It didn\u2019t seem that the Lightning Rats were going to distract it.Su Yanying did not expect this. Was the Lightning Rat trying to engage in close combat with the Earth Buddha? However, the Earth Buddha was a fifth-rank pet and of an advanced bloodline which gave it more abilities, including inherited advanced pet skills, unlike the other regular fifth-rank pets!\u201cSplit up and go around the Earth Buddha!\u201d Su Yanying said at once.The thirst for blood faded away a bit more in the Lightning Rat\u2019s eyes. The Lightning Rat was struggling, but it followed Su Yanying\u2019s orders eventually. The three headed up to three directions and dashed toward Lan Lele who was behind the Earth Buddha.\u201cYingying, let it fight with Zangzang. My astral shield is fragile,\u201d Lan Lele shouted at once as the three Lightning Rats ran toward her.Usually, pets looked cute. However, those little guys could kill a person easily!\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m just trying to see if your Earth Buddha can tell which one is the real one.\u201d Having said that, Su Yanying told the Lightning Rat to fake an attack on Lan Lele.The Thunder Slash that was taking shape on the Lightning Rat\u2019s forehead came back as Su Yanying passed along the order. The Lightning Rats began to run around the venue.Roar!The Earth Buddha roared angrily as it saw two Lightning Rats charging toward its master. The Earth Buddha slapped the ground. Several earthen walls were erected around Lan Lele to shield her inside.Then, the Earth Buddha pounced at the ground as if diving into the water. The Earth Buddha and the ground became one. In less than three seconds, the Earth Buddha burst out and stopped a running Lightning Rat.Bang!The Earth Buddha was surrounded by spikes like a sea urchin. The Earth Buddha smashed this Lightning Rat into pieces.That was only an image!Su Yanying was pleasantly surprised. The Lightning Rat\u2019s disguise was quite successful, having fooled a fifth-rank pet.If the Lightning Rat could fool pets, then it could fool battle pet warriors as well.After all, the battle pet warriors that she could encounter were the students at the same grade in the academy. Such advanced skills were not something that could be learned in the academy. Only some powerful teachers could have told the minute differences between the real one from the fake Lightning Rats!Bang!After the Earth Buddha crushed that image of the Lightning Rat, the former was surrounded by the electric arcs bursting out from the latter at the same time. That being said, since the Earth Buddha was a fifth-rank pet, its skin managed to transmit the electricity into the ground, so the Earth Buddha remained unharmed.The Earth Buddha snuck back into the ground once more.The other two Lightning Rats stopped at the same time. On one of them, the lightning was becoming messier and messier. This one was an image. As time moved on, it would be harder for the Lightning Rat to control its shadow images. The differences at this stage were easy to ascertain.The Lightning Rat, the real one, did not move. It just stayed close to the ground and did not blink its reddened eyes for once.All of a sudden\u2014The Lighting Rat\u2019s eyes were rekindled!Bang!The ground under the Lightning Rat was lifted, and dirt was stirred up.The ferocious Earth Buddha broke through the soil and seemed to have hit the Lightning Rat.Lightning flashed!Teleport in mid air!In the old days, the Lightning Rat was rusty when it came to the \u201cThunder Flash.\u201d The Lightning Rat would rarely use the skill and after a long time, the skill might even slip from its mind!However, in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, every time the Lightning Rat wanted to come close to its enemies, it would have to rely on this skill. The Lightning Rat had become quite proficient with it!Amid the dust.The Earth Buddha was confused because it sensed it had missed its opponent.While the Earth Buddha was still in shock, it saw some sparkles. All of a sudden, with a bolt of lightning, something came up.That was something with a pair of eyes filled with violent, blood-thirsty looks, and raging fury!Thunder Slash!Bang!The Thunder Slash that came into being almost instantly landed on the Earth Buddha across the air.However, while in terror, the Earth Buddha reacted fast. A shield built of soil surrounded the Earth Buddha. With a cracking sound, after the Earth Buddha was hit, it fell to the ground.As things happened, it seemed as if the Earth Buddha had turned into water. The Earth Buddha had gone underground and escaped.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: FearPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45: Fear\u201cLightning Rat!\u201dSu Yanying jumped in fright, having seen the Lightning Rat being smashed away by the disrupted ground. No matter how strong the power of understanding the Lightning Rat had, it was a low-rank pet, nonetheless. Su Yanying supposed this strike could badly maul the Lightning Rat!The raised dust blurred her view of the Lightning Rat. Su Yanying called out the Fanged Tiger and told it to get in there to help the Lightning Rat.\u201cLele, ask your pet to stop now!\u201dSu Yanying wanted to put an end to the fight immediately. All of a sudden, she realized that Lan Lele was surrounded by the dirt wall. It was likely that Lan Lele could not hear her.This was bad!In the meanwhile, the Fanged Tiger had dashed into the venue. Its huge body dispersed the dust, revealing the Lightning Rat.The Lightning Rat was on the ground, safe and sound, which astonished Su Yanying.She had just seen the Lightning Rat being smashed away. How could it stay unharmed?Boom!Boom!Abruptly, the ground began to shake again. One after another, three more walls were added outside the original three dirt walls, adding more protection for Lan Lele.Su Yanying was stunned still.What?What did this mean?Had the Earth Buddha given up on the attack?But, if the Earth Buddha had curled up behind all those walls of defense, there wasn\u2019t much she could do.After all, the Earth Buddha was at the fifth rank and was a pet of the rock family with defense as a strong suit. The strongest pet she had was the Fanged Tiger who was at the intermediate position of the fourth rank. There was nothing the Fanged Tiger could do to the Earth Buddha.A moment later, the dirt walls loosened a bit and a hole appeared. Lan Lele walked out from behind the walls, craning her neck to peer and make sure it was not dangerous outside. \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d She asked Su Yanying in confusion.\u201cAre you asking me?\u201d Su Yanying was baffled.\u201cJust now, Zangzang sensed an intense danger so it locked me in there. I was so puzzled. What can be dangerous at the training grounds in our academy? As I see it, nothing seems to be out of place.\u201d Lan Lele was perplexed.\u201cIt sensed danger?\u201d Su Yanying was filled with questions.Everything was fine just then. What danger could there be?Besides, her pets did not pick up any clues on danger and they didn\u2019t give her such feedback.\u201cDid Zangzang get it wrong?\u201d Lan Lele turned around. In the shades behind the dirt walls, she could see through the hole that the Earth Buddha was hiding in there. It was shivering and its four eyes were all demonstrating fear.\u201cThat\u2019s curious...\u201d Lan Lele tilted her head, completely at a loss.Su Yanying noticed how scared the Earth Buddha was. She was no less stunned. Pets were not sophisticated beings and that fear was not fake. That was to say, there was something that happened moments before that made the Earth Buddha sense danger and grow terrified because of it.However, she had been there the whole time. She never saw anything off.\u201cWait a minute. Isn\u2019t it...\u201d Su Yanying remembered that toward the end of the battle, the Earth Buddha escaped as soon as the sneak attack on the Lightning Rat took place.The Lightning Rat was unharmed, so the Earth Buddha must have missed its target. In principle, the Earth Buddha should have struck while the iron was hot.Unless, there was something else that made the Earth Buddha give up.Something that the Earth Buddha was terrified of.Could it be that this thing... was the Lightning Rat?A glint of shock flashed past Su Yanying\u2019s eyes.Was it even possible?The Lightning Rat was a low-rank pet. While it had picked up advanced pet skills, its potential was limited within that low-rank bracket; it couldn\u2019t have shattered that shackle.As a pet with an advanced bloodline, the Earth Buddha was proud. How could it be scared of a low-rank Lightning Rat?\u201cLele, have your Earth Buddha come here,\u201d Su Yanying said suddenly. To prove her theory would be easy. A simple test would do.Lan Lele didn\u2019t understand her friend\u2019s intention, but she told the Earth Buddha to do so nonetheless.The master\u2019s will could not be disobeyed. Although the Earth Buddha was conveying its resistance to Lan Lele, it did step over.It was just that, the Earth Buddha was incredibly slow.\u201cLightning Rat, go to it,\u201d Su Yanying said in her mind.Receiving the order from its master, the Lightning Rat crawled up and stood on all fours slowly. Even though this was a rat, it could walk forward with the same graceful, light, and soundless demeanor seen in cats.Su Yanying and Lan Lele were good students, but their visions were limited. Neither could discern the hidden power and cruelty in the Lightning Rat\u2019s every move. That bearing and posture both indicated that the Lightning Rat could launch an alarming strike at any second just like an assassin concealed in the dark!The Earth Buddha that was making its way to Lan Lele became even more fearful as it saw the Lightning Rat step over slowly. The Earth Buddha had practically stopped. Around its feet, the ground was shaking. Dirt and sand were crawling up from its feet to every corner of its body. The Earth Buddha was strengthening its defenses for protection.Su Yanying\u2019s eyes sparkled. She asked the Lightning Rat to come back and then told the Fanged Tiger move closer to the Earth Buddha who didn\u2019t show any particular reaction. Instead, the Earth Buddha breathed in relief as the Lightning Rat moved away, as if a great burden had been lifted. The shell of dirt that covered up the Earth Buddha broke up into flowing sand and fell to the ground.\u201cI was right.\u201dSu Yanying was taken aback by what she saw.It was the Lightning Rat.The Earth Buddha was afraid of the Lightning Rat!!That was the Earth Buddha, a famous pet of the rock family, a star amongst pets.However, the Earth Buddha was scared of a Lightning Rat that could be seen anywhere...\u201cThere must be something I don\u2019t know. So, the Lightning Rat knows other skills, other than the \u2018Multiple Thunder Shadow Image\u2019. It has other powerful abilities!\u201dAs Su Yanying made such assumptions, excitement rose in her eyes. Just this one \u201cMultiple Thunder Shadow Image\u201d was enough to thrill her. There were other possible skills!That store owner did not mention this. Was he also unaware?The training was such a good bargain!\u201cThat store is more than trustworthy. But I don\u2019t think the business is good given how unpopular it is. It must be that few people know about the store yet. I must go there more often before the store becomes popular. Maybe I can get a membership card or something...\u201d Su Yanying had already begun to let her mind go wild.\u201cYingying?\u201d Lan Lele was surprised to see Su Yanying smirking to herself. Was it Su Yanying who scared the Earth Buddha?Su Yanying came back to her senses. She didn\u2019t have time to explain. \u201cHelp me with the other pets\u2019 practice as well.\u201d\u201cEh, sure.\u201d Lan Lele didn\u2019t think too much about it.She didn\u2019t read into the fact that the Earth Buddha was scared. Her attention was not on the pets, to begin with. If she were willing to devote more efforts to raise her pets, given the wealth of her family, she could easily become a student to be showcased in the academy\u2019s newspaper.Afterward.Su Yanying sent out her Fanged Tiger, the Fallen Phoenix, and the Ugly Stone Beast one after another. She noticed that the three pets she had left in boarding had made progress as well.While their progress was not as noticeable when compared with Lightning Rat, their combat strengths had been improved by half at least. The Fanged Tiger was below the fifth rank and could never compete with the Earth Buddha. However, not only could the Fanged Tiger fight the Earth Buddha for a bit, the former was not at a disadvantage!As Su Yanying\u2019s usual training partner, Lan Lele could sense the change as well. She was surprised to see that in merely three days, Su Yanying\u2019s three pets had experienced such a drastic rise in their abilities, as if they were on drugs!Could this be a result of the boarding service in that pet store?Lan Lele\u2019s eyes blinked. As the daughter of a businessman, she was born with an acute business sense. She could tell that that store could bring forth huge commercial opportunities!Soon, the training ended. Su Yanying looked at the time. Her turn was almost up. She didn\u2019t go on to prevent her pets from spending more energy. They weren\u2019t pushed to their limits in those training fights.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSu Yanying was in a good mood. She didn\u2019t think that she could take the crown in this year\u2019s tournament. But, after the result of those drills and having felt the transformation of her pets, she believed she had a chance to reach for the championship!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some celebrity students that could hardly be seen were among those participants as well.The contests had been more exciting. The pets that could come out were of at least the third rank. Rarely would any second rank pets be summoned to the contests. Even if there were, those second-rank pets would be defeated with no exception.When it was a fight between powerful students from the power rankings, the stadium would be filled with the rioting sound of excitement!\u201cWe have more than ten minutes. No rush.\u201dLan Lele and Su Yanying arrived at the stadium as well. They found the seats of their class and sat down.At the moment, other contests were taking place. The two parties were among the stronger students. Neither could get the upper hand.Su Yanying watched the contest. All of a sudden, she felt that someone was glaring at her. She turned her eyes and noticed that the glare came from her front; there was a cold looking person sitting upright. It was Jiang Hanbing who was nicknamed \u201cIce Jiang.\u201dThere were no grievances between Su Yanying and Jiang Hanbing to begin with, but they had somehow become competitors after people had built up rumors about them.Gossip was a fearful thing.Time moved on in their student lives.She would take notice of Jiang Hanbing every now and then.As time passed, they had become rivals.Naturally, that glare came from Jiang Hanbing. Su Yanying\u2019s eyes flickered. She had tested the strength of her pets. She was confident that she could defeat him, instead of having their battles hang in the balance like before!Lan Lele saw the names on the digital board. She gave Su Yanying a pep talk, \u201cYingying, your turn is coming up. Be careful... I will be waiting for your victorious return.\u201dSu Yanying smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I know my opponent. Just the Fallen Phoenix alone will be able to overwhelm him.\u201dAt this time, the commentator called out Su Yanying and her opponent\u2019s name.The other students cheered for them.Su Yanying was somewhat famous in the academy. As a girl in the senior classes who was in the power rankings\u2019 top 10, she would attract much attention.Soon, her opponent came. It was a roly-poly boy.\u201cMiss Su, if I win against you, can you sign your name on my chest? I promise I will never take another shower again in my life!\u201d As soon as the chubby boy came to the stage, he thus announced.\u201cBoo!\u201dThe other students started booing.\u201cSenior Su belongs to all of us. Nobody can take her as his own!!\u201d The students were bellowing.Su Yanying frowned at this jeer. She said coldly, \u201cWe will talk when you do win.\u201d\u201cGood!\u201d The short and fat boy seemed to have been encouraged by this. He called out his pet at once. It was a middle-rank bloodline pet of the water family, the Cloaking Water Beast.This pet was human-like and made up of water, proficient at hiding and assassination.The pet was holding an element dagger that could shift into water streams like the pet itself.Su Yanying called out her Fallen Phoenix without thinking.\u201cYelp!\u201dThe Fallen Phoenix caused a burst of exclamation as soon as it appeared. After all, the Fallen Phoenix was a pet with an advanced bloodline; such pets would become advanced pets as soon as they reached adulthood. Pets of this kind were rare and far superior to other lower-rank pets.A fiery flame lingered close to the Fallen Phoenix, making it appear as if on fire.Since mutual forbearance existed in the two pets\u2019 properties, it all came down to whose pet was stronger in a fight.As soon as the judge announced the start of the match, the chubby boy shouted, admitting defeat.This was just what people expected.Su Yanying felt the boy was smart. However, all of a sudden, she noticed a trace of a smile that indicated he had attained what he wished as he called back his pet.She frowned. Something was not right.Then, the roly-poly boy called out the second pet, one of the rock family.Given its property, the pet was not as formidable as the Fallen Phoenix but it had a strong resistance to fire as well.\u201cIt\u2019s the Earth Seizer!\u201dSu Yanying\u2019s expression changed a bit the moment she saw this pet. The Earth Seizer was one of the most outstanding pets of the rock family. The Earth Seizer could not deter pets of the fire family, but it was an invincible opponent for flying pets!\u201cI am sorry, Miss Su. I have recently been searching for all the information about your past contests and have a basic understanding of your pets. Of all your pets, the Fallen Phoenix is the most difficult one to deal with. You have the Ugly Stone Beast and the Fanged Tiger, which are strong, but they can only be good in face-to-face combat. I just have to crush them in such a fight and that will be fine.\u201cIt\u2019s just this Fallen Phoenix. Even a fifth-rank pet will find it hard to defeat it. Rather, the former will be tortured by the latter.\u201cOf course, you have that genius little rat. But it will be of no use in a contest like this. My Earth Seizer alone will be able to defeat that rat.\u201dThe fat boy grinned. He was convinced the outcome of the contest had been determined.Su Yanying felt her mind weigh down. She had collected his information as well but failed to find the Earth Seizer in his data. That was why she had sent out the Fallen Phoenix so readily.\u201cRight, I forget to tell you, Miss Su. For this tournament, I spent all the pocket money I had saved in three years. I rented this Earth Seizer a month ago. It is a trump card I prepared just for this tournament.\u201dThe fat boy smiled and looked at the audience. \u201cI want everyone to remember my name and know my existence after this tournament! I shall no longer remain in obscurity when I graduate!\u201dSu Yanying gasped.A three-years worth of pocket money...What was he saying?\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that you lived without any pocket money for three years, right?\u201d Su Yanying asked.The chubby boy raised his eyebrows and said calmly, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen, you don\u2019t eat any snacks?\u201d Su Yanying could not imagine how horrible a life would be without chips, cola, fried chicken, and other snacks!The short and fat boy frowned. \u201cOf course not.\u201dWas this a proper question at the time?\u201cThen, why are you still so fat?\u201d Su Yanying threw out another question.Boom! A critical strike!The short and stout boy felt as if he had received a punch, making him feel suffocated. His mouth twitched for a while but eventually, he held down his anger. \u201cMiss Su, you will regret those words,\u201d he cautioned her, in a hoarse voice.\u201cWill I?\u201dSu Yanying lifted her hand. A blasting power was added to the Fallen Phoenix who was already light and graceful. It could move around faster.Even though the Earth Seizer was a formidable foe to the Fallen Phoenix, Su Yanying chose to stick to the fight.\u201cHmm. Courting death.\u201dThe roly-poly boy\u2019s face was clouded. He passed along his instructions to the Earth Seizer in his mind. \u201cDungeon Imprisonment!\u201dBang, bang, bang!Dozens of thorns suddenly protruded from the ground, quickly rushing into the air toward the Fallen Phoenix.\u201cThat is Dungeon Imprisonment that Earth Seizers are best at!\u201d The commentator exclaimed.Hostility filled Su Yanying\u2019s eyes. How could she know which one of them was weaker without a fight?Overwhelmed?For sure.But if her pet was strong enough, it could shatter its overwhelming shackles!\u201cBlazing Bird!\u201d Su Yanying ordered the Fallen Phoenix to attack.\u201cFlame Breath Cut!\u201dTwo pet skills were applied at the same time. A bird burning in flames came off from the Fallen Phoenix and dived toward the short and fat boy.He sneered. \u201cEarth Guardian!\u201dBang!Several earthen walls were erected to protect him.The flaming bird smashed into the wall and dispersed in sparks instantly.The Flame Breath Cut turned out to be useless as well.Su Yanying was taken aback.This was indeed a formidable opponent.Pets of the earth family were born with a strong resistance to fire; the dirt walls were just too strong!\u201cTime for this to come to an end.\u201dThe short and stout boy used \u201cSense Extension\u201d to observe the situation beyond the walls. He grinned sarcastically when he saw the Fallen Phoenix\u2019s efforts were futile. \u201cDid you think that I would buy a piece of garbage with my three years\u2019 worth of pocket money?\u201dSu Yanying had used her Sense Extension as well. She could hear what the chubby boy was saying behind the dirt walls. She was alerted. She was shocked the moment she cast another look at the Earth Seizer.\u201cIt\u2019s an adult Earth Seizer!\u201cFifth-rank!\u201dSu Yanying looked awful as she counted the number of horns on the Earth Seizer\u2019s jaw.Her Fallen Phoenix could fight back an average third rank Earth Seizer regardless of the fact that their properties were mutually deterrent. But this one was of the fifth rank... Her Fallen Phoenix had barely reached the upper position of the third rank!\u201cCome back.\u201d Su Yanying was frustrated. She had fallen into his trap. She admitted defeat.That being said, she still had the Lightning Rat and the Fanged Tiger, trump cards for her win.When she was calling out for the Fallen Phoenix, she felt that it was resisting. At the same time, being forced by the thorns on the ground, the Fallen Phoenix moved to a corner made by the walls.The Fallen Phoenix used Flame Breath Cut many times, but the flames could not inflict much harm as they fell on the thorns. The flames just scorched them.\u201cCome back.\u201d Su Yanying hurried to use the power of the contract.Right at that moment, a long cry of anger echoed in the air!\u201cYelp!\u201dA flame burst out suddenly, and at the same time, an extremely hot ray suddenly swept out, slashing all the ground thorns that were flying and chasing the Fallen Phoenix in the field!The commentator that was about to say that the Fallen Phoenix was being targeted suddenly felt that all words had disappeared at the tip of his tongue.What did he just see?Was it Blazing Ray, an eighth-rank pet skill of the fire family?!!The entire stadium instantly fell into a short moment of dead silence.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even they had to be envious of a pet of such talent.\u201cIs that girl its master?\u201d\u201cI remember her.\u201dCompared with the pets, given their battle pet warrior status, those people were more interested in the master.After all, the pet\u2019s changes and strength were closely linked to their masters\u2019. When some talented pets were controlled by weak masters, the pets would gradually forget some of the rare skills that they had mastered. It would be difficult for those pets to put their strength into full play and eventually, they would disappear into the common crowd.Whereas.An outstanding battle pet warrior could tap his or her pets\u2019 full potential even if the pets were of a poor aptitude. He or she could train excellent pets.All of a sudden, someone said in surprise, \u201cAh, I remember. Isn\u2019t she the one that used a Lightning Rat on her previous match?\u201dThe name \u201cLightning Rat\u201d rang a bell. The others came to realize this fact instantly.Three days before, that Lightning Rat took their breath away...Back then, they already had a feeling that the Lightning Rat\u2019s master had to be a genius. Otherwise, if the Lightning Rat were to rely on itself alone, no matter how talented it was, it couldn\u2019t have learned so many advanced pet skills.Being once again amazed by the same person never crossed their minds.Not only had she trained a talented Lightning Rat, but she had also nurtured this outstanding Fallen Phoenix!Even though this Fallen Phoenix was less talented than the Lightning Rat, the former was an advanced pet. This talent and the potential that lay within its bloodline determined that the Fallen Phoenix would grow to be a formidable advanced battle pet!A red headed lady turned around and asked, \u201cVice Principal Dong, what is the girl\u2019s name?\u201dEh?Was she trying to grab the girl for her team?The other people turned to Dong Songming and fixed their eyes on him.Everyone was thinking that if this talented student could join their team, after several years of training, she could play a big and important role in the future when they explored uncharted lands!Next to them, Dong Songming was inwardly excited while he kept a straight face.The life of the academy would be prolonged if talents emerged from it.If this talented girl could join a team and build a reputation with her contributions, she would have a glorious future. For the academy, she would be a strong connection they could rely on!\u201cShe is Su Yanying, from Class Two, Grade Three,\u201d Dong Songming answered calmly.Su Yanying!The eyes of those present sparkled. They had committed this name to memory.After the contest ended, they would find out everything there was to know about the girl.On the stage.Su Yanying had no idea that some big potatoes had noticed her. Her attention was on the Fallen Phoenix and her brain was ringing.The power of the Blazing Ray was terrifying. The flames did not fan out; they formed a concentrated burst of energy. With more energy converged together, this was no weaker than a physical attack!Wherever the Blazing Ray swept across, the protruding spikes on the ground were cleaved in two, as if they were just pieces of paper.Along with the Fallen Phoenix\u2019s angry calls, the Blazing Ray was reaching toward the short and stout boy surrounded by dirt walls.\u201cWhat...?\u201dThe fat boy stared at the scene.When had the Fallen Phoenix learned the Blazing Ray skill?During the contest?He was so unfortunate, to have encountered something this terrifying.\u201cNo kidding...\u201dBoom!The dirt walls collapsed, and the astral shield shattered. The ray cut a narrow crack on the ground. Although the crack was only as wide as a finger, it was bottomless...KO!The fat boy was saved by the judge in the nick of time, but it had also been announced that the boy had lost this round.Burning in flames of wrath, the phoenix came back slowly. Its flaming wings had grown, creating a scorching heat.\u201cIts rank has risen...\u201d Su Yanying stared at the Fallen Phoenix. From the information passed along from the contract, she could tell that her Fallen Phoenix had broken through to the fourth rank from the upper position of the third rank!A Fallen Phoenix of the fourth rank already had the combat strength of a middle-level pet.Besides, since the Fallen Phoenix had learned a rare eighth-rank pet skill, the Fallen Phoenix could compare favorably against a pet of the fifth rank!\u201cYelp, yelp!\u201dThe Fallen Phoenix chirped happily.Su Yanying came back to her senses. Looking at the happy Fallen Phoenix, she felt she was dreaming.She originally thought that she would lose this round. She never expected that the tables could be turned.\u201cIt was able to learn an eighth-rank pet skill...\u201d Still, Su Yanying found it surreal. How strong must the Fallen Phoenix\u2019s power of understanding be to achieve this? She didn\u2019t give it any guidance at all!Suddenly, something struck her.She remembered that pet store...The calmness of that store owner...\u201cThe power of understanding... and constitution... can be improved...\u201dShe was dumbstruck.At the moment, the judge had already returned to his seat. He declared the start of the third round.Once again, it was the fat boy against Su Yanying.The third round commenced thusly.While it was true that the outcome seemed to have been determined, there were instances in previous matches with a score of 2:0 with the latter winning three times in a row in the last round in an amazing comeback.\u201cEven heaven is against me!\u201dThe roly-poly boy was indignant. Gradually, the sorrow in his eyes transformed into resentment and violence!There would be no more miracles!While the Fallen Phoenix could not be taken care of and he was not sure that he could win, that didn\u2019t mean that he was defeated!He had prepared a trump card!He suffered in silence for three years just so he could climb to the peak at this moment, to make the world notice his presence. He was not willing to stop now!\u201cCome on out, Wind Warcraft!\u201d the short boy shouted.Astral power around him was draining wildly, pouring into the contract in front of him.Astral power was needed to summon pets.To summon a pet with a rank lower than himself, the astral powers needed would not be much. On the other hand, if he were to summon a pet with a rank much higher than his, a large amount of astral power would be needed!Whoosh!Wind sprang out from nowhere in the stadium.It was soft and slow.But the ground in front of the fat boy suddenly cracked and opened.A pet that was almost five meters tall with strange, dark cyan patterns came out slowly from the contract space.The pet floated quietly in front of the fat boy. The moment the pet came, the fat boy fell on his bottom, exhausted. The summoning had almost sucked him dry!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instant Kill!\u201cIt is a Wind Warcraft of a middle-rank bloodline.\u201d\u201cThis, this one is an adult!\u201dThe moment the Wind Warcraft presented itself, the wind in the stadium grew strong. The air was filled with killing intent.Wind Warcraft.Just as the name suggested, this was a pet of the wind family. The fact that it was named \u201cWarcraft\u201d was enough to reveal its brutal and barbaric nature. This was a very aggressive kind of pet amongst all the intermediate pets.More importantly, the Wind Warcraft was huge; its four semi-transparent wind wings marked it as a full grown specimen!The moment she saw the Wind Warcraft, Su Yanying\u2019s face changed.An adult Wind Warcraft!This one was at the upper position of the fifth rank!If it was talented, it could compete against a pet of the sixth rank!Besides, as opposed to Lan Lele\u2019s Earth Buddha, this was a pet of the offensive type and it could be very aggressive!Lan Lele\u2019s Earth Buddha had already become one of the few valiant pets in the academy. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that Lan Lele\u2019s own control abilities were low, the Earth Buddha would be one of the star pets that could help her win.\u201cThere\u2019s no information about this. Is this the trump card he had been hiding?\u201dSu Yanying looked awful.She had been overly confident, thinking that her opponent was a nobody. Only, it turned out that he was a sinister viper!And, as soon as the viper showed his hand, the move was fatal!The audience was frozen as well.They had thought the outcome had been predetermined. They did not see this shift coming!This was such a grandiose comeback!The judge took a look at the Wind Warcraft. His stares were ridden with worry. Then, he turned around and reminded Su Yanying, \u201cSu Yanying, please send out your pet.\u201dShe clenched her teeth as well as her fists.Send out her pet?Which one?Her Fallen Phoenix had just reached the fourth rank. Even with the advanced Blazing Ray pet skill, the Fallen Phoenix could only match the abilities of the fifth rank after a fashion. At the very best, one at the middle position of the fifth rank.As for the Fanged Tiger and the Ugly Stone Beast, both were at the fourth rank, several times weaker than the Wind Warcraft!Even the Lightning Rat with the unusual power of understanding was merely at the third rank, even though it could use the Multiple Thunder Shadow Image!\u201cHmm.\u201dThe short and fat boy crawled up from the ground and patted the dust off his bum. He grinned and said to Su Yanying who looked pale, \u201cNow you see how terrifying I can be without eating snacks for three years?\u201dSu Yanying felt her cheeks twitch.This was such a slap to her pride.It hurt.She never thought she would lose to someone like this.Anyways...Even if she was about to lose, she would not admit defeat like a coward!\u201cCome on out!\u201d Astral power surged in her as she called out the Fanged Tiger. She would let it spearhead the attack.She had three chances. She could make the Fanged TIger and the Lightning Rat wear the Wind Warcraft down at first, then she could send out the Fallen Phoenix as the grand finale to make a last-ditch effort!\u201cAugmentation in strength, perception, firmness, and gale power!\u201dSu Yanying added all the four basic augmentation effects of the third rank on the Fanged Tiger!It wasn\u2019t an easy task to cultivate to the third rank in all of the four augmentation skills.When the augmentation power reached the Fanged Tiger, the audience cried out in amazement after witnessing Su Yanying\u2019s achievements in battle pet warrior skills.\u201cHmm!\u201dThe fat boy\u2019s eyebrows were knitted together but he let out a sneer. \u201cTake care of the tiger. Use Wind Slit to finish it!\u201dNot only did he want to win, but he also wanted to win in a shocking way. That was the only thing that could excite him!Besides, only by doing this could he leave a deep impression on the powerful teams off stage!The Wind Warcraft stayed absolutely still in the air.The fat boy was surprised. He pulled a long face.The Wind Warcraft was rented. Since its rank was far superior to that of his own, his control over the pet was difficult.\u201cDamn bastard!\u201d He was clenching his teeth in hatred, but he couldn\u2019t pass through such thoughts to the pet.Roar!Facing them was the Fanged Tiger. It let out a roar all of a sudden with hair raised; its aggressiveness increased with the four augmentation effects. Promptly, the Fanged Tiger dashed over.Biting!The Fanged Tiger opened its large, fierce-looking mouth and bit at the Wind Warcraft.Whoosh!The soft breeze suddenly moved.The next second, the Fanged Tiger froze on the spot. Then, a large amount of blood spilled out as if the Fanged Tiger had been cut by countless invisible sharp blades.Then, as if struck by a bomb, the Fanged Tiger was smashed away.Boom!The Fanged Tiger fell to the ground, disabled.Instant kill!The audience was silent.Nobody expected that the Wind Warcraft could be this ferocious. Was this the strength of a pet at the upper position of the fifth rank?Su Yanying was taken aback. She called the Fanged Tiger back into the contract space at once.The Wind Warcraft was formidable!The Fanged Tiger never stood a chance!She had thought that she could wear the Wind Warcraft out with attrition warfare. She just then found that thought ridiculous.\u201cI...\u201dSu Yanying said with a bitter mind. She was ready to give up.Right at that moment, the gentle breeze that surrounded her suddenly closed in.An air of murder was running in the air!Su Yanying was scared.The judge who was by the stage noticed what the Wind Warcraft intended to do at once. By the time he sensed that the wind elements around Su Yanying were increasing in density, the judge had turned pale.Pff, pff!The ground around Su Yanying was cut by the wind and she seemed to be in the middle of wind blades, right in the middle of a tornado.\u201cWhat is going on?\u201dThe audience was taken aback. Was the Wind Warcraft attempting to attack Su Yanying?However, since Su Yanying had lost the first match and had yet to send out her second pet, this was against the rules.\u201cThe Wind Warcraft is getting out of control!\u201dAt the spectator seats, the red headed lady frowned. She could tell what had gone wrong with one look.Sitting next to him, Dong Songming\u2019s face changed as he stood up in a hurry. Su Yanying was a rare talent. To let her get hurt would be a great loss to the academy!As for the Wind Warcraft!They could tell right away that the pet was rented. The master\u2019s strength was no match for the pet\u2019s!\u201cDamn it!\u201d Dong Songming slapped at the desk. He used astral power to message the judge, ordering him to bring the Wind Warcraft under control.Nobody noticed that the moment the wind elements were closing in on Su Yanying, something crawled up by her feet. It was the Lightning Rat.The Lightning Rat\u2019s whole body broke out with gooseflesh. In its little eyes were bursting with the desire for blood, filled with violence and ferocity!The Lightning Rat fixed its reddening, gruesome looks on the Wind Warcraft facing them.Kill!Kill!Stimulated by the murderous intent in the air, the Lightning Rat was pushed by its own hormones. The only thing on its mind was to kill!To attack wildly without stopping!Kill, kill, kill!\u201cSqueak!\u201dNobody heard this ruthless and tyrannical cry. However, all of a sudden, many bolts of lightning were discharged, generating a glaring light. The electric snakes seemed to have come to life. They danced around and crushed the invisible wind blades around Su Yanying!\u201cEh?\u201d The judge who was about to take action was surprised by this.Whoosh!Abruptly, all the lightning bolts traveled back to one spot and then vanished.It seemed as if everything were an illusion, something completely unreal!But four or five meters away, the lightning re-appeared out of nowhere!It emerged for just one moment; the lightning vanished once again!\u201cThunder Flash!!\u201dOff the stage, the group, including the redheaded lady, stood up at once. They stared at the stage with disbelief in their eyes.Dash! Rush! Flash!Lightning dashed around several times in a row. Taking advantage of the moment the Wind Warcraft was lost in thought, the Lightning Rat discharged a thick bolt of lightning from its back slashing at the Wind Warcraft in a fit of rage!Bang!Glaring light illuminated the entire stadium!The moment the lightning disappeared, everyone could see a huge body that had been burnt by electricity lying on the ground. It was the Wind Warcraft.Instant kill!People were so quiet that even the drop of a needle could be heard.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Stimulated by homicidal will, the Lightning Rat slowly stepped toward the Wind Warcraft whose survival was uncertain at the moment. It seemed that the Lightning Rat would attempt the last, fatal strike!Was the Lightning Rat trying to wipe out the Wind Warcraft?The judge was surprised. He looked at the Lightning Rat\u2019s master. Was this her idea?Anyone who maliciously killed an opponent\u2019s pet would be disqualified from the tournament, to also be punished severely after the game!The judge was taken aback as he saw how confused this girl was. This was puzzling to him.Wasn\u2019t the Lighting Rat her pet?Why would she be so surprised?Could it be that she didn\u2019t have a full understanding of her pet\u2019s abilities?Time was pressing. The judge could not waste time wondering nor to alert the girl who was stunned, clearly not in a condition to control her Lightning Rat.He swiftly passed along instructions to his pet via his consciousness. \u201cHurry.\u201dAs his instruction was received, a gust of wind swept through the air.Whoosh!A fierce whirlwind suddenly swept through and in the middle of the whirlwind was an almost translucent bird. The bird was flying as quickly as a supersonic fighter plane.The moment the bird entered the stage, the Lightning Rat who was making its way to the Wind Warcraft stopped. The Lightning Rat looked up and fixed its eyes that spoke of a violent thirst for blood on the bird that was approaching rapidly.Buzzing, buzzing!Once again, bolts of lightning surged out from the Lightning Rat.Exterminate!Anything that attempted to strike should be exterminated!This had become the Lightning Rat\u2019s instinct after numerous painful lessons!Bang!All of a sudden, the bolts of lightning surging out from the Lightning Rat converged into one thick bolt that landed on the whirlwind that was charging over with absolute precision.All-round Thunder Prison, an advanced pet skill!Boom!The bolt of lightning was traveling so fast that people could not see it with their naked eyes. Fast as the translucent bird was, it could not react in time. The whirlwind outside collapsed after the lightning strike and the wind faded away.At the same time, the bird was forced to stop while it was still advancing quickly. The bird flapped its wings. Some electric arcs were traveling amid its feathers. Slightly burnt marks appeared.\u201cWind Bird!\u201dThe judge squinted his eyes, gasping with astonishment.The Lightning Rat was able to hurt his Wind Bird?!To make it even more stunning, the Lightning Rat could predict the Wind Bird\u2019s trajectory?!The Wind Bird was a pet with an advanced bloodline and this one had grown up and reached the seventh rank. This was a pet known for its fast speed. Not even pets of the same rank could have predicted its movements, not to mention a pet of an inferior level.Let alone a Lightning Rat that was so much lower in the ranks!\u201cAll-round Thunder Prison!\u201dOn the spectator seats, the redhead lady, Dong Songming, and all the others were looking with their eyes wide open, completely astonished.They had just seen the performance of one of the 10 special skills of the thunder family, \u201cThunder Flash.\u201d After that, did they just witness the usage of \u201cAll-round Thunder Prison,\u201d an advanced pet skill of the eighth rank?This skill was comparable to the Blazing Ray that the Fallen Phoenix had grasped!\u201cChirp!\u201dThe Wind Bird flapped its wings and kept its green eyes on the Lighting Rat. The Wind Bird detected some danger from that figure surrounded by lightning bolts.As an advanced pet, the Wind Bird was almost as intelligent as a human child. Low-level pets like the Lightning Rat were commonly seen in its life. But the Wind Bird could never foresee that it could be harmed by this kind of low-level pet!Rage!The Wind Bird felt that its pride as an advanced pet had been challenged by this ignorant being!Whoosh!Rich wind elements were circling the stage. The wind was even heavier and more overwhelming than the one produced by the Wind Warcraft. If the Wind Bird had such intentions, it could turn the entire stadium upside down in an instant!That was the power that belonged to an advanced pet!Sensing the fury from the Wind Bird, the judge came back to his senses at once. He calmed the Wind Bird down in his mind at once, while he said to the girl at the same time, \u201cMake your pet stop, now!\u201dSu Yanying was pulled back into reality by this scream. Everything that went down happened within an instant. She was still trying to figure everything out.\u201cWhy would the judge interfere?\u201d Su Yanying\u2019s thought still lingered, from the time when the judge sent the Wind Bird in. She was still baffled. But she didn\u2019t have time to think. She just instructed the Lightning Rat to come back to her via her consciousness.Having received instructions, the Lighting Rat gradually suppressed the killing intent. The Lightning Rat hopped back to Su Yanying quickly.The judge was relieved to see the Lightning Rat was not on a rampage. Realizing that he had just been stressed out by a Lightning Rat, the judge could not help but feel speechless, smiling bitterly at such a thought.The judge cleared his throat, adjusted his presence, and announced the result, \u201cSu Yanying wins.\u201dThere was no one cheering in the stadium. The silence was strange.It was because the match had been strange.How could a Lightning Rat defeat the Wind Warcraft and contend against the judge\u2019s Wind Bird?No student could keep their head straight to understand the reason.After seven to eight seconds of silence, someone, nobody knew who, abruptly started to clap. Following that, more people clapped, and the applause became increasingly passionate. At the same time, people began to cheer.While the students could not understand the match, they had to admit that it was marvelous. It was full of twists and turns and beyond everyone\u2019s expectations. It had certainly been an eye-opener.Su Yanying looked at the Lighting Rat by her feet, bewildered.She was well aware of the horrors presented by an adult Wind Warcraft. The text books mentioned it more than once. However, such a terrifying pet had been defeated by her Lightning Rat, and within the blink of an eye no less!Su Yanying remembered the shivering Earth Buddha from before. She looked at the Lightning Rat next to her; it didn\u2019t seem to be unique in any way. Suddenly, she felt she couldn\u2019t understand her pet.\u201cThis little fella...\u201cHow strong is it exactly?\u201dShe remembered that pet store. Her heart was trembling.What kind of person could train a regular Lightning Rat to this stage?She had heard that some experts preferred going into noisy crowds to drown and silence their own clamor. Could it be that she had met such an expert?\u201cIs it a Lightning Rat for real?\u201d\u201cIs it a mutant that only looks like a Lightning Rat?\u201dOff the stage, the red headed lady and Vice-Principal Dong Songming gradually came back to their senses.They felt it was surreal that the pet by the girl\u2019s heel could have released a special skill like \u201cThunder Flash\u201d.It was enough to inspire awe and admiration when an advanced pet mastered such special skills!\u201cHow many advanced pet skills has this little guy learned?\u201d a bulky man could not help but ask.The others looked at each other. Their mouths began to twitch. Counting the Thunder Shadow Image, Thunder Slash, and the All-round Thunder Prison they had just seen... this was unnatural!\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that such genius qualities are found in a Lightning Rat. If it were any other pet, even one with a middle-level bloodline, that pet could have been sold at a whopping price!\u201d The red headed lady exclaimed.\u201cPrincipal Dong, a word, please,\u201d the bulky man said.The others turned to him at once. The red headed lady snorted. \u201cWhat\u2019s the rush? The game is not over yet.\u201dA young man with his arm wrapped in bandages said coldly, \u201cGuys, the Crimson Flame team will take her.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe others sneered. They weren\u2019t in the mood to reply to him.They would take her?He had to see if they would allow it. Who in that group of people would be scared by his remark, considering the groups they represented?62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The system was reinstalled, and it cost him 70 coins, which made his heart ache.\u201cGood, nice. Harder...\u201dA gentle and pleasant voice reached his ears from the small soundbox.In the video, there was a pink linsang lying on all fours on a table and a young man was focusing on massaging the linsang\u2019s front paws.Standing at the side was a learned and refined middle-aged man that would now and then correct the young man\u2019s massage skills.\u201cCan this be called training, too?\u201dSu Ping was speechless.The video explained that with special massage skills, the young man could imbue the linsang with astral power and unclog the veins in its front paws. According to the middle-aged man who was wearing a middle-level trainer badge, after a long time, such a massage could strengthen the linsang pet\u2019s front paws.The difficult part of such training was that the trainer had to be extremely familiar with the internal structure of the astral pet. Otherwise, the astral power could not be digested, and this action could only backfire.Su Ping had no interest in learning this skill. The fast forwarded the video to look at the scenes shot a few months later.The young man grabbed a ruler and measured the linsang pet\u2019s front paws. They were 20 centimeters long!That was two centimeters longer than the front paws of average linsang pets!Then there were more clips demonstrating attacks of the linsang pet... Anyways, the result was that the front paws were one fifth stronger in attacks after such a treatment!And, the training only lasted for three months!Su Ping was speechless as he browsed through the bullet screen comments whooshing by, \u201cYou have my respect, Mr. Lin+238,\u201d\u201dI want to be that linsang pet+529,\u201d\u201dTwo centimeters longer? I have an idea... +1073.\u201d\u201cThat could be regarded as awesome?\u201cThree months!\u201cEvery day for three months, which was a long time, the trainer had to invest his accumulated astral power. All that only to increase the strength of the front paws by one fifth?!\u201dSu Ping felt that those honeyed words in the bullet screen comments were hard on the eyes.He closed the video and suddenly, an idea sprang to mind.He had been frustrated since the store had not received any business for the last couple of days. People would say that good wine needed no bush. However, he couldn\u2019t afford to wait for fame to expand.\u201cDistributing flyers won\u2019t be effective and people may not believe what they say. To shoot a video and post it online can be a good way to advertise,\u201d Su Ping thought.While there was little worth shooting inside the store, and since he didn\u2019t know any training techniques, he could film the cultivation planes.For a trainer, the most important thing would be the cultivation planes other than some secret training methods.The cultivation plane environment could exert the biggest influence on pets. That was why within a short matter of days, Su Ping was able to help the Lightning Rat and the Little Skeleton improve their abilities by several times.\u201cCompared to the cultivation bases that the trainers are at, my cultivation planes are entirely different worlds, vast and boundless. That would be eye-catching.\u201d\u201cEvery time I visit a cultivation plane, I can put a camera in my storage space to capture the views and the pets in the cultivation plane. When I come back, I can edit the videos and post them for promotion.\u201d\u201cBut I cannot shoot some of the special cultivation planes, like the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. The three crimson moons in the sky are too shocking. Someone may think that I doctored the images, since they will be able to tell right away that I\u2019m not on this planet.\u201dThe more he thought about it, the more plausible he found the plan. As for the specific ways to shoot the videos, he would think about it when the time came.He opened up the most popular video website and started the registering process.\u201cPlease type in your nickname.\u201d\u201cThe pretty, beautiful, and incredibly handsome man.\u201d\u201cThe nickname has been taken.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201cHow could someone be this shameless?\u201dSu Ping frowned as he sunk into deep thought.A moment later, he quickly typed in another nickname.\u201cThe unrestrained good-looking man.\u201d\u201cThe nickname has been taken.\u201d\u201cYour pretty boy is here.\u201d\u201cThe nickname has been...\u201d\u201cWhat to do when I am too handsome?\u201d\u201cThe nickname...\u201dAlmost 10 minutes later...Su Ping finally finished the registration.He had gained a full view of this ugly world just by experiencing this measly account registry process.There were too many shameless people out there!Su Ping sighed, exhausted both in mind and body. Then, he entered the \u201cMy Center\u201d section of his page. There was a tutorial to teach people how to upload and post videos.It wasn\u2019t complicated. One read and Su Ping had learned it. The only thing he needed to do was to shoot the video.\u201cI have no other training orders at the moment. To self-finance a visit to a cultivation plane would mean losing money. Besides, I have to get a high-resolution camera...\u201dSu Ping felt a headache once he thought about the camera issue.Good cameras were not cheap, with prices ranging in the thousands at the very least.Besides, he had converted all the money he made in the store into energy points. Even if he had not done so, he wouldn\u2019t have spent that money on buying a camera. So, he would have to ask his family for money to buy the camera.\u201cRight, there are still 20,000 in the card my mom gave me. The money is for me to buy offspring at pet bases but I can breed pets in the store now, so I don\u2019t have to buy them anymore. I can use this money.\u201dRemembering those savings relieved a burden on Su Ping\u2019s mind. This way, the matter of the camera had been resolved.Next, he would have to decide which cultivation planes he should go to and how to shoot the video.Buzzing!All of a sudden, he heard the noise made by a sports car engine outside the store.Su Ping\u2019s train of thought was disrupted. He frowned. The car parked outside his store.His unusually acute hearing enabled him to hear when the car door was opened and closed, including the sound made by the magnets on the door. Then, two people stepped into the store.\u201cSir.\u201dSomeone greeted him with a pleasant voice.Su Ping looked up. He knew them, the siblings that came to find fault with him.To be honest, he had to thank them. Without them riling up the system, he wouldn\u2019t have obtained the free chance to access any cultivation plane he wanted.\u201cSir, I see that you have some new items.\u201dFan Xiaoyu, the slim girl, saw the shelf with more items on display. She said those teasing words with a grin. However, the grin froze on her face as she glanced through the prices.No kidding.Only a few days had passed since her last visit, and there were even higher prices on display.Fan Xiaoyu soon came back to her senses as she recalled the benefits of the food they had purchased in their previous visit. Her eyes were glowing.\u201cSir, long time no see,\u201d Fan Yujing said, smiling. He didn\u2019t seem to mind that his arm had been broken at the store.Su Ping took a look at his arm. It was healed, good as new.He had to admit that the healing techniques in this world were advanced. To heal a severed limb was not hard. The hard part was to pay for it.\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d Su Ping could tell from their looks that the two must have come to know the benefits of the food sold. They were aware that his pet food was well worth its value.Just as Su Ping suspected, Fan Yujing did stop by to purchase more pet food.After his previous visit, he gave that Colored Buddha Leaf to his pet. Coincidence or not, shortly after the pet took it, his pet used a new pet skill by chance during a battle!It wasn\u2019t a rare, advanced pet skill, but it was a pleasant surprise nonetheless.Therefore, he wanted to test his idea by visiting the store again. He wanted to buy some more pet food. Other than that, he came for another important mission.\u201cSir, I wonder if you\u2019re interested in exploring an unclaimed territory.\u201d Fan Yujing looked at Su Ping with anticipation.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Fractures in SpacePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51: Fractures in Space\u201cAn unclaimed territory?\u201dSu Ping remained surprised for a moment.On this blue planet, other than the base cities that humans resided in, almost all the areas were considered wilderness and over 500 such unclaimed territories were scattered across the planet.Such unclaimed territories were unsuitable habitats for humans.Two reasons led to the existence of such unclaimed territories. The first reason was the damages done to the earth, caused by human wars in the past. Hazardous materials and technology remnants polluted the lands, making them uninhabitable.The other reason was that many space fractures would appear in areas that were deemed unstable.The space fractures were twisted cracks that usually led to many mysterious and unknown places.Some places were strange pieces of land hovering amid the stars and ferocious beasts could be found there.Some were death stars that could not even be found on the Federation\u2019s interstellar map. On those stars, there were no traces of plants or animals.Some cracks would lead to a fixed star just like the sun which could destroy people as soon as they set their foot in!In those unknown, mysterious places lived many doughty Astral Pets. Most Astral Pets on this blue planet were originally from those unknown hidden worlds.Space fractures worked as portals that led to those lands.Generally speaking, defensive fortresses would be built in the perilous lands where space fractures existed, with federal armies stationed there in case the untamed, wild pets and beasts in those unclaimed territories would sneak into the base cities where humans lived in; otherwise a massive slaughter would ensue.When unclaimed territories were found, the federal government would designate detachments for \u201cmopping-up\u201d operations in the unclaimed territories to keep them stable.The staff members working for such detachments were all known as explorers.Being an explorer was an incredibly dangerous occupation but at the same time, the pay was tremendous!Explorers lived in the base cities and they enjoyed many benefits. Every month, they could collect generous subsidies and rewards; in some special cases, they were entitled to use their power to seek privileges.The best way for the general public to obtain wealth and position was to join an explorers\u2019 team. Even an average explorer would enjoy a higher status than military personnel. If the explorer could make contributions, the explorer would have an even higher position in society. Even the mayor would have to receive such an explorer with good manners.\u201cYes.\u201dSu Ping was hesitating. Fan Yujing hurried to explain, \u201cSir, given your strength, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re overqualified to run a store here? Our explorer team is in dire need of master-hands like yours. If you can join us, you can name the rewards you want. I believe the money made from the exploration will be over a hundred times more than what you make now!\u201dSu Ping cleared his mind. He flatly declined, \u201cSorry, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201d\u201cExploring the unclaimed territories?\u201cNo, thanks. Why would I go to a dangerous place like the unclaimed territories to risk my life when I can simply lie here and make money in comfort?\u201dIf he died, his life would be gone for good.What was the unclaimed territories\u2019s main feature? There was no protection whatsoever!If by any sh*t luck they encountered monsters as strong as beast kings, he would have delivered himself to doom for nothing.This was not the answer Fu Yujing had on his mind.He had never assumed that Su Ping would turn the offer down so readily.Was it because Su Ping was not in want of money?Well, considering how Su Ping broke his arm, Fan Yujing did not think it would be hard for Su Ping to make money.Maybe, a master such as Su Ping only craved for missions of a challenging nature.Fan Yujing thought about it and added, \u201cRecently, some things seem to be happening in the unclaimed territories outside the explorer\u2019s base of our Longjiang Base City. There are many extra middle-level or advanced pets. I think this can be a good training opportunity. Are you interested?\u201d\u201c...\u201dSu Ping looked at Fan Yujing as if the latter was a fool.\u201cWhy would you persuade me to go when such dangers were lurking about?\u201cWhat\u2019s your brain\u2019s damage?\u201cTraining?\u201cF*ck the training!\u201dSu Ping replied, \u201cThere are two words I want to say.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Fan Yujing\u2019s eyes glowed. He wondered if the two words were \u201cI am.\u201dSu Ping kept a straight face as he uttered the words, \u201cPiss off.\u201dFan Yujing was taken aback.Fan Xiaoyu, who was standing next to Fan Yujing, said angrily, \u201cWhy are you insulting him?\u201dSu Ping answered indifferently, \u201cI suggest you take a look at my goods. You are welcome to leave if you don\u2019t want anything else.\u201dLooking at Su Ping\u2019s calm expression, Fan Yujing produced a forced smile. Neither money nor the prospect of a challenge could appeal to Su Ping. Fan Yujing felt his effort to rope Su Ping in had failed.Fan Yujing heaved a sigh before he confessed in a bitter tone, \u201cActually, I\u2019m only here to invite you because I have no other options. Last night, a new space fracture appeared in the unclaimed territory outside the Longjiang Base City.\u201cOur team headed there to explore. However, since we\u2019re not familiar with the environment, two of our teammates were injured by accident. To make things worse, one of them lost a pet in the excursion. So, we have to hurry back as soon as possible to find his pet.\u201cBut, since both teammates are injured, we cannot find anyone to take their places at the moment. That\u2019s when I thought of you, sir. I thought you would be intrigued...\u201dSu Ping raised his eyebrows but offered no other reaction.He had nothing to do with this matter. He didn\u2019t need to meddle.Sympathetic?He was a little bit sympathetic but that was all.Besides, he wasn\u2019t sympathetic to their team, but to the pet that was lost in the space fracture.Su Ping\u2019s eyebrows knitted tighter as he thought about how lonely the pet would be at the moment. The team could make money when they explored an unclaimed territory. But they had acted greedily when their abilities were not enough. The pet was innocent.\u201cI\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s nothing I can do,\u201d Su Ping voiced his refusal again, pulling a long face.Fan Yujing was disappointed but he said nothing more.Fan Xiaoyu darted a look at Su Ping. She, too, did not say anything. She was well aware of how dangerous exploring an unclaimed territory could be. It was only natural that Su Ping was unwilling.\u201cDing!\u201d\u201cCongratulations. The host has triggered a side quest: look for a lost pet.\u201d\u201cCompleted quest reward: one Magic Forging Skill book.\u201d\u201cFailed quest punishment: 10 points will be deducted from the host\u2019s score.\u201dThe system\u2019s prompt messages suddenly popped up in his mind.That startled Su Ping.What did he do to trigger a side quest?Su Ping couldn\u2019t help but shout out in his mind, \u201cSystem, are you serious? Think about my abilities. Aren\u2019t you asking me to send myself to doom by making me help them find their lost pet?\u201dThe system sounded detached, \u201cAs an owner of a pet store, the host shall not ignore anything related to pets. Please finish the quest as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cAre you being serious...\u201dSu Ping could not win an argument with the system. Inside, he almost burst into tears of rage.He was merely a loser with a combat strength of 3.5. What was the difference between sacrificing his life and exploring an unclaimed territory?He wanted to give up on the quest directly.That being said.He began to hesitate as he thought of the punishment for failure.He would be erased when his score dropped below the passing line.\u201cThis damn system has been rating me this entire time!\u201dAlso, the reward seemed to be appealing...The internal struggle went on for a long time. Finally, Su Ping made up his mind and questioned Fan Yujing, \u201cTell me about the world inside that space fracture first. Another thing I need to know is the kind of pet you lost in there.\u201dFan Yujing was surprised by this question. His eyes began to shine as he asked happily, \u201cSir, are you willing to join our team?\u201dSu Ping wore a solemn look. \u201cAnswer my question first.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Ninth RankPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 52: Ninth Rank\u201cSure!\u201dFan Yujing adopted a more serious attitude and explained, \u201cThe world found inside the space fracture this time is a place suitable for habitation. The place floats in an unknown galaxy not registered on the interstellar map. As for whether the new world is a continent or a planet, we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\u201cA large number of indigenous Astral Pets live there, and the majority are aggressive Astral Pets of the demon family. Based on the information we collected of the environment near the entrance, for the most part, we have found low to middle-level Astral Pets. However, as our team advanced to the deeper regions, we\u2019ve encountered more middle-rank and advanced pets.\u201cThe strongest of all the Astral Pets we\u2019ve met was an eighth-rank Flame Bone Dragon. Fortunately for us, we spotted it in time and managed to get away in advance.\u201dAt this point, Fan Yujing realized that he had revealed too much. An eighth-rank Flame Bone Dragon was not something to be messed with. Although Su Ping was strong, he was in his early twenties nonetheless. He would be unable to defeat an eighth-rank pet.Fan Yujing stole a look at Su Ping and surprisingly, he saw no worries on his face.\u201cThe deeper areas you reached, how deep were they?\u201d Su Ping looked into Fan Yujing\u2019s eyes.Fan Yujing replied, \u201cWe haven\u2019t covered the entire area yet, and we have no idea how vast the world is. The so-called deeper area is a relative term. But based on information we collected with our instruments, we believe we got close to that world\u2019s inner zone.\u201cAccording to our past exploration, there must be more than one eighth-rank Astral Pet living in that world. There\u2019s a chance that ninth-rank Astral Pets can be found there!\u201dHe was telling the truth.He knew what he was doing.Fan Yujing was aware that by saying this, Su Ping could lose his interest. After all, ninth-rank Astral Pets were the strongest of all, second only to beast kings. Even the best of the top explorers\u2019 teams would pale at the mention of a ninth-rank pet.\u201cNinth-rank?\u201dSu Ping squinted his eyes.The only ones who could tame ninth-rank Astral Pets were battle pet warriors with titles. Only a handful of such battle pet warriors could be found in the entire Longjiang Base City.But this was not among Su Ping\u2019s biggest worries. He had other questions. \u201cIs the ninth-rank the highest present? Could we encounter Beast Kings?\u201dIf we were to compare ninth-ranked Astral Pets to a cannonball, Beast Kings could be regarded as a small nuclear bomb! The gap between the two was huge!A Beast King could even destroy over half of a base city!\u201cBeast Kings?\u201d Fan Yujing\u2019s face was drained of color after hearing that term. For people who had to constantly risk their lives, this name was taboo.Su Ping was not joking. Fan Yujing shook his head and answered, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not possible. If Beast Kings lived there, then the number of eighth and ninth-rank Astral Pets would be far greater than what we found. Otherwise, there wouldn\u2019t be enough food for the Beast Kings, unless we were dealing with a herbivore Beast King.\u201d\u201cHowever, the death aura in that world is rich. There are few herbivore Astral Pets to begin with, let alone those that can grow to be Beast Kings.\u201dSu Ping gazed into Fan Yujing\u2019s eyes and nodded. \u201cHow is the strength of your team?\u201dFan Yujing stated, \u201cThe explorers\u2019 teams are always made of five. Excluding the two injured teammates on our team, we have our captain, another member, and myself. I am a battle pet warrior at the intermediate position of the sixth rank and the strongest of my Astral Pets is at the lower position of the seventh rank.\u201cOur captain is the most powerful of us all. He\u2019s a battle pet warrior at the upper position of the seventh rank and he has an eighth-rank Astral Pet. However, that pet cannot compare to an Astral Pet of the demon family like the Flame Bone Dragon. The other teammate is on par with me.\u201d\u201cThat is to say, the strongest power that can be released can only reach the eighth rank?\u201d Su Ping frowned.That was too weak.They would not stand a chance against a ninth-rank Astral Pet, not to mention a Beast King.Even a stronger eighth-rank Astral Pet could eliminate the entire team!Fan Yujing felt embarrassed for a moment, since he noticed the dissatisfaction and contempt shown in Su Ping\u2019s facial expressions.He had introduced his team proudly. After all, they were a middle-level team that could explore a space fracture. On the other hand, many explorers\u2019 teams could only explore third-level unclaimed territories in their own blue planet.Fan Xiaoyu felt vexed by the fact that her brother had been looked down upon. In her mind, since young, her big brother had always been a genius superior to many others!Her brother was a celebrity at the academy. After he graduated, he had achieved his current position and strength and joined a second-level team, all in a matter of a few years. His future was promising!Still, he had just been despised!\u201cHow annoying!\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for the memory that Su Ping could break her brother\u2019s arm easily, Fan Xiaoyu would have talked back. But the world was one that was run by fists. While she was unhappy about Su Ping\u2019s attitude, she had to admit that compared to her brother, this despicable store owner was a more powerful man. A peculiar and odd one at that!He opened a store there to live out his life in retirement instead of fighting and training in pioneering excursions when he was so young. This was a complete waste of his talent!Su Ping paid no heed to how the siblings reacted. His eyebrows were knitted together as he pondered about the risks of this trip.\u201cSystem, are there any tools for protection?\u201d Su Ping asked in his mind.The system replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cSeriously!\u201dHe could not count on this stupid system.Su Ping was grinding his teeth inside.While running into ninth-rank Astral Pets was the worst that could happen, he had to be prepared.Fan Xiaoyu and Fan Yujing didn\u2019t make a sound. They waited for Su Ping\u2019s reply quietly. At the end of the day, exploring the barren land was not like playing house or making jokes. People could lose their lives!A long moment later, the glow in Su Ping\u2019s eyes dimmed down. He lifted his eyes to look at the siblings and inquired, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to buy something?\u201d\u201c...\u201dThe siblings, who were looking forward to his decision, almost spat out of blood in frustration.\u201cWhat is wrong with your brain?\u201cWe said so many words and all of them went down the drain?!\u201d\u201cSir, sir...\u201d Fan Yujing\u2019s lips were trembling.Su Ping said, \u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me. I will go with you. But before that, aren\u2019t you going to make a purchase?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Fan Yujing opened his eyes in astonishment and asked, \u201cAre you willing to help?\u201dSu Ping nodded and repeated his words, \u201cPick some goods now. All the items in the store are of high quality. You know that. Well, buy something expensive. What\u2019s the point of having money if you don\u2019t spend it?\u201dThe siblings, who were momentarily happy due to the surprise, were stunned speechless by Su Ping\u2019s words.Well, indeed, they had also gone there to buy more goods. They felt relieved, given that Su Ping had agreed to join them in the exploration. They began to browse the goods on the shelf.\u201cWhat? This...\u201d Fan Yujing\u2019s sight landed on a pale-white bone lotus instantly. He was shocked after seeing the price tag. \u201cIs that worth 1.2 million coins?\u201dSu Ping\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cDo you want that?\u201dFan Yujing was dumbstruck.Was Su Ping trying to rip them off?Despite the fast money-making chances explorers had, it was still hard for them to make more than a million.\u201cWhat... does it do?\u201d Fan Yujing couldn\u2019t help but ask. Last time, the treasured food that was said to be able to inspire intelligence was sold at 20,000 coins. But the price for this lotus was 60 times that!Su Ping introduced it with a smile, \u201cIt can help an advanced undead pet to directly rise a rank. If you have a ninth-rank pet of the undead, there is a 5% chance that the pet can become a Beast King after consuming this.\u201dThe siblings were wide-eyed and could not make a sound.That food could promote an advanced pet one rank directly. Did such a thing exist in reality?There was a chance that a pet at the peak of the ninth rank could evolve into a Beast King?As informed as Fan Yujing was, he had only heard about such treasures in legends. He had never seen one in real life. He just thought those were only things made up to spice up a story. How could he believe that such an item was being sold there?\u201cDo you want to buy it?\u201d Su Ping pressed him.Fan Yujing recovered from his shock. He pulled up the corner of his mouth and smiled. \u201cWell, we don\u2019t have contracts with any undead pets. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to buy it.\u201dSu Ping pulled a long face at once.\u201cWhat are you smiling about if you don\u2019t want to buy it?\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Bloodthirsty Little SkeletonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 53: Bloodthirsty Little SkeletonEventually.Following Su Ping\u2019s recommendations, the Fan siblings picked some pet food they needed and spent 67,000 coins.That sum of money was converted to 670 energy points automatically.\u201cSir, may I know your family name?\u201d\u201cSu.\u201d\u201cMr. Su, when can we leave?\u201dFan Yujing was more concerned about finding his teammate\u2019s pet than the precious pet food he had just bought.Su Ping didn\u2019t reply to this question directly. Rather, he answered with another question, \u201cHow long are the day and night in the space fracture?\u201dSince that was an unknown world, the alternation between day and night would be different from that on the blue planet. Maybe, it would be in the daytime in the space fracture while it was nighttime in the blue planet.This was common. For instance, consider the Chaotic Realm of the Undead... Su Ping had never seen the sun there.\u201cWhat?\u201dFan Yujing was surprised by this question.Su Ping had to be a professional since he noticed this point.Only senior explorers that would go in and out of space fractures would pay attention to such details.The time difference might appear to be an issue of little consequence, but it could be critical to the daily schedule of some Astral Pets!The majority of Astral Pets of the demon family would hide by day and come out at night. During the nighttime, such Astral Pet\u2019s would be more aggressive and thirstier for blood!Previously, when Su Ping was hesitating, Fan Yujing was still having doubts about him. However, at that moment, Fan Yujing felt he had underestimated this store owner.Someone that could break his arm easily was more powerful. How could Su Ping not be afraid of space fractures?\u201cThe space fracture was just discovered. We haven\u2019t registered the existing alternation between day and night yet,\u201d Fan Yujing confessed.Su Ping said, \u201cCan you have your teammates wait there and guard by the entrance? We can go in at once when daylight comes on the other side.\u201dFan Yujing nodded, but at the same time he still had questions, \u201cWhat if it would take a long time for the day to arrive? Wouldn\u2019t we have to wait for several days?\u201dSu Ping replied in a low voice, \u201cWe will set off tonight at the latest.\u201dSu Ping was also unwilling to wait for that long. They would have to take actions overnight if they couldn\u2019t wait for the day to come in that space fracture. Otherwise, if they postponed their actions for too long, the lost Astral Pet could be murdered and his quest would fail.\u201cSure,\u201d Fan Yujing agreed at once.His bottom line was to set off by the evening of the following day at the latest, or the chances to find his teammate\u2019s pet would be small.\u201cOff you go. Come to this address to wait for me at 10:00 tonight.\u201d Su Ping found a pen to write down an address close to his home and handed it to Fan Yujing.Fan Yujing took it and read the note. \u201cSure. Let me go back and get ready.\u201dSu Ping nodded. \u201cOf course.\u201dAs the siblings almost crossed the door, Su Ping stopped them at once, \u201cWait.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Fan Yujing turned around in surprise.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to buy more?\u201d\u201c...\u201dAfter the two were sent off, Su Ping took a look at the energy points he had collected. Counting what was left from before, he had more than 700 energy points in total.\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a pet of the fire family with an advanced bloodline, the Fire-tailed Blood Fox. Unfortunately, the Fire Herb was sold out. The only thing left is the \u2018Fire Dragon Fruit\u2019.\u201dSu Ping picked up a bottle of Fire Dragon Fruit from the shelf. There were eight pieces of fruit inside and each was worth more than 300 coins. This was a kind of food that was favored by pets of the fire family. The fruit could increase the density of fire elements inside such pets and enhance the power of attacks involving fire.To accomplish the task, he would have to use the Fire Dragon Fruit as bait.He tried hard to mollify his aching heart. Su Ping placed the Fire Dragon Fruit into his storage space. Then, he went to the pet room and cast an identification spell on the Little Skeleton that was soundly asleep.Bloodthirsty Little SkeletonProperty: pet of the demon familyRank: third rankCombat Strength: 7.8Aptitudes: Below averageAbilities Mastered: Regeneration, Undead Enslaving, Intermediate Saberplay, Puppetry, Rotting Flesh, Darkness Blinding, Deadly RoarCompared to when they came back from the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, there had been some shifts in the Little Skeleton\u2019s interface.Its rank had been elevated. When they came back from the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, the Little Skeleton was at the upper position of the second rank. It had already reached the third rank at the moment.Its combat strength had advanced to 7.8 from 7.4, which implied that the Little Skeleton could compare favorably with a pet at the upper position of the seventh rank.However, its aptitude rating dropped from above average to below average.But what stood out more was the addition of \u201cBloodthirsty\u201d in front of the Little Skeleton\u2019s name.Every piece of change was related to one item, the treasure that was worth 15 million coins, the Blood Bead!This Blood Bead was still hovering inside the Little Skeleton\u2019s skull but had shrunk in size. The Little Skeleton had absorbed a fair portion of the Blood Bead. This was the reason for the elevation in rank, combat strength, and constitution. The Little Skeleton had more potential. It evolved from a regular Skeleton-Pet to a Bloodthirsty Skeleton-Pet!Amongst all the skeletons, bloodthirsty skeletons were pets with middle-rank bloodlines. That being said, amongst all the middle-rank Astral Pets, the bloodthirsty skeletons were at the bottom and even an adult skeleton would only have a combat strength of the fourth rank.Yet, compared to the original average skeleton kind, the bloodthirsty skeleton kind was much better.This could explain something.The Little Skeleton had become more talented but its combat strength did not increase markedly. Therefore, amongst its peers, the Little Skeleton\u2019s aptitude could only be rated as below average.Of course, its peers were not the common skeletons, but the bloodthirsty skeletons that were superior.Amongst all the bloodthirsty skeletons born since the beginning of chaos, what the Bloodthirsty Little Skeleton had could only be regarded as below average.Luckily, since that quest had been finished, even the drop of aptitude ratings would not affect Su Ping.After all, the Little Skeleton had absorbed enough energy from the Blood Bead, completely changing its bloodline to that of a Skeleton King. Given its incipient combat strength in contrast to such a constitution overhaul, it was understandable that its aptitude rate would be lower.\u201cLittle fella, time to get up.\u201dSu Ping woke up the Little Skeleton.Some red sparkles shot out from the Little Skeleton\u2019s empty eye sockets as it regained consciousness. The Little Skeleton sat up and looked at Su Ping in a daze.Su Ping told the Little Skeleton to leave the nursing pen, then he took it to the store and closed the shutter door.Su Ping said in his mind, \u201cCultivation plane window.\u201dYes, he wanted to pay a visit to a cultivation plane. But, he was not going to train the Little Skeleton. The true aim was to give the Little Skeleton enough time to absorb the Blood Bead.After all, one day in the cultivation plane was merely an hour in the real world.He had more than half a day left before the rendezvous at 10:00 that evening, so he could stay in a cultivation plane for about a week.A week of nurturing with the Blood Bead would improve the Little Skeleton\u2019s constitution and strength.Given the Little Skeleton\u2019s current status, improving its constitution would be much better than finding an advanced cultivation plane for it to fight.After all, the Little Skeleton had almost reached the limit of its potential when it fought in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. Plain fighting and dying would not necessarily improve the Little Skeleton\u2019s combat strength in the short term.Besides, if they were to engage in fights, the Blood Bead in the Little Skeleton\u2019s skull would have to be taken out, or else the Blood Bead would be lost when the Little Skeleton died. That would delay the absorption of the Blood Bead.Soon.Su Ping found the low-level cultivation plane he went to last time, the Extraterrestrial Meteorite Region 1002.The charge for admission was merely one energy point.Su Ping chose that cultivation plane without any hesitation.That plane had little danger. Once they got there, he could summon the Little Skeleton back to his pet space and then enjoy seven days in that plane. Plus, he could collect some pet food.Even if he used up all 30 deaths that came for free as a gift from the system, he could use some energy points to buy more. The price was merely one-tenth of the admission price.Time zipped by.The seven-day trip in the cultivation plane went by in a blink.Deep at night, Su Ping re-emerged at the store. He came back with uncombed hair and dirty face after seven days in the cultivation plane.He looked at the time. It was 8:30 in the evening.Su Ping breathed in relief. He poured out all the pet food in his storage space and asked the system to help him count and put them on the shelf. Then, he took a shower at the store and then he quickly rode back to his home.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wash your hands, I\u2019ll heat up your meal.\u201dSu Ping went to wash his hands and returned to sit at the table.While waiting, he was wondering if he should let the family know that he had awakened as a battle pet warrior.After all, fire couldn\u2019t be wrapped up in paper. It was only a matter of time before his sister and mother found out about him.Soon, some hot dishes were delivered to Su Ping.Su Ping was surprised, since he saw some meat in the dishes. \u201cShe skipped dinner?\u201dJudging by the astral power vortices upstairs, Su Ping knew that his sister had been home for a good while. However, there was meat in the dishes left for him. What a miracle!Li Qingru was happy that he would think of his little sister. \u201cShe already had dinner. This is another share I saved for you.\u201dSu Ping understood.No wonder...\u201cMom.\u201d Su Ping hesitated for a moment, ready to spill the beans about his awakening.\u201cMom,\u201d someone said at the staircase.Su Ping\u2019s words were stuck in his throat.Then, someone hurried down the stairs and went to the dinner table. She sounded surprised as she asked, \u201cMom, didn\u2019t I finish all the dishes? Where did this come from?\u201dSu Ping curled his lips. \u201cShe finished them all...\u201d\u201cHow cruel!\u201dLi Qingru said, \u201cI cooked some more.\u201dSu Lingyue pouted after she heard the answer, but she regained calmness soon enough. She stared at him coldly and asked, \u201cWhy are you back home so early today? The store should be open at this hour.\u201dSu Ping talked back grumpily, \u201cWhat\u2019s it to you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dSu Lingyue raised her eyebrows?\u201cHow dare you talk to me like this?\u201d\u201cWhat gave you the courage?\u201dShe sat down casually and threw out a remark, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I did some exercise.\u201dSu Ping pretended not to have noticed the hostility in those words. He just replied with curiosity, \u201cHaven\u2019t you been participating in contests? How could you not exercise? Are you saying that you\u2019re cowering at the back and shouting while the pets do all the work for you?\u201dThe table trembled.The iron spoon held by Su Lingyue was bent a little bit.\u201cHmm. Interesting.\u201dShe smiled, showing her teeth.She stretched out her fingers and the iron spoon in her hand was straightened at once.\u201cHmm.\u201d Su Ping grinned as well.He grinned and ate at the same time.Su Lingyue looked at him with a smile for a while. Then, she looked away and said to Li Qingru, \u201cMom, I\u2019ll take a shower now.\u201d\u201cSure. The water heater should be ready now.\u201d Li Qingru nodded. \u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll have your clothes ready in a moment.\u201d\u201cThanks, mom.\u201dSu Ping quickly finished the last bits of his dinner as Su Lingyue was leaving. Making the most of the time while trouble was away, Su Ping mentioned after some thought, \u201cMom, I have some errands to run tonight. I need to go away and may come back late.\u201dSu Ping knew that he probably couldn\u2019t return home that night, even though he claimed he would be back late.However, he had to act first and report later so that he could leave the house.\u201cErrands? What errands?\u201d Li Qingru was surprised.Su Ping had prepared an excuse for this. \u201cIt\u2019s about the pet store. A customer asked me to drop by for some home service...\u201dLi Qingru was relieved since it was something related to the store. She gave her permission. \u201cThen take care and come back early.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dSu Ping lingered at the table for a while, so that he wouldn\u2019t appear to be in a hurry. Then, before his sister came out from her shower, he took off in case she would disrupt his plan.......A black SUV was parked under the shade of some trees on a remote street.Two figures were leaning against the door, one of them smoking.\u201cBrother Fan, is this guy as strong as you described? He can break your arm easily. He must be as good as our team leader, right?\u201d the man smoking asked in curiosity.The other young man wearing a black t-shirt and ripped jeans replied, \u201cPossibly. Anyway, the man is a genius. He is quite young. I think he can become a battle pet warrior with titles in the future.\u201dThe smoking man sounded amazed as he replied, \u201cAre you serious? Is he that good?\u201dFan Yujing shrugged. Who could foretell the future?At the moment, Fan Yujing looked from the corner of his eye. He said at once, \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201dThe two men looked over. From the other end of the street came a slim man wearing casual clothes.While he was approaching, the man who was smoking was sizing the former up and down as well. Just like Fan Yujing had mentioned, this man was young. But he was suppressing his aura; the smoking man could not tell how strong this young man was.\u201cSorry for making you wait.\u201dSu Ping could see the black SUV parked under the tree from a distance, Fan Yujing who was standing in front of the car and another unfamiliar man with profound astral powers. Su Ping supposed that the other man was Fan Yujing\u2019s teammate.\u201cWe\u2019ve only been here for a short while.\u201dFan Yujing smiled. He was surprised; Su Ping didn\u2019t seem to be carrying any weapons, but he didn\u2019t ask him about it.The most powerful weapon a battle pet warrior could have was the pet itself. As for firearms, there was no lack of such items in their explorers\u2019 base but few would use them.\u201cMr. Su, this is my teammate, Li Ying,\u201d Fan Yujing introduced the man who was smoking to Su Ping.That man put out his cigar and gave Su Ping a friendly greeting, \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019ve heard so much about you.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dSu Ping went directly to his question after this exchange of pleasantries, \u201cWhat\u2019s the current situation over there? Is it daytime yet?\u201dFan Yujing appeared to be in a bitter mood. He heaved a sigh and said, \u201cNot yet.\u201dSu Ping frowned but he had been expecting this. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dFan Yujing opened the side door for Su Ping.Su Ping said, \u201cI call shotgun.\u201dWith that said, he went to the front passenger seat.Fan Yujing didn\u2019t mind. He sat in the driver\u2019s seat, then started the SUV and dashed out after Li Ying sat down as well.\u201cMr. Su, I heard that you run a pet store. Your pets must be powerful.\u201dLi Yi took the initiative to start the conversation. He was also trying to probe Su Ping. Li Ying trusted Fan Yujing, but exploring an unclaimed territory was not a joking matter. One careless decision and people could die.Su Ping looked at Li Ying through the rearview mirror. \u201cIf you say so.\u201dLi Ying smiled. \u201cMr. Su, you\u2019re quite the modest one. Can I ask your name?\u201d\u201cSu Ping.\u201dWhile driving, Fan Yujing finally came to know Su Ping\u2019s full name. He committed it to memory.\u201cBrother Su, I think you\u2019re in your early twenties. Usually people at this age are still studying in the academy. Brother Su, did you graduate early?\u201d Li Ying posed another question curiously.Almost all the battle pet warriors were trained in schools. Alternative ways to train battle pet warriors were quite rare.Su Ping only replied with a smile.Su Ping was avoiding the question but Li Ying was unwilling to let go. He pressed Su Ping on this topic, \u201cBrother Su, I heard from Brother Fan that you broke his arm. Is that true? Brother Su, are you an advanced battle pet warrior?\u201dSu Ping frowned. He was only on a quest. He didn\u2019t wish to be grilled like this.While sitting on the side, Fan Yujing could tell that Su Ping was unhappy. He tried to break the ice, \u201cBrother Su, our explorers\u2019 base is kind of far away. You can take a nap if you\u2019re tied.\u201dSu Ping rolled his eyes at him. \u201cWhy would I go and explore with you if I were tired?\u201d\u201cTalk to me about the exploration,\u201d Su Ping said, \u201cI\u2019ve never been on one and want to know more.\u201dFan Yujing found that surprising. Why has Su Ping never gone to any exploration given his strength? If so, why did he notice the importance of the time difference?Anyways, since Su Ping had posed this question, Fan Yujing could not doubt him. He explained to him, \u201cThe space fracture found this time is in unclaimed territory No.38 outside Longjinag Base City. Our team is temporarily stationed at the explorer\u2019s base there.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Explorers\u2019 BasePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55: Explorers\u2019 Base\u201cUnclaimed territory No.38?\u201dSu Ping did know that the 500 or so unclaimed territories around the globe had numbers designated. The unclaimed territory No. 38 must have been discovered a long time ago, given its small number.\u201cYes.\u201d Fan Yujing nodded and continued, \u201cUnclaimed territory No.38 is a Class B territory. Throughout history, there were several Beast Kings found but they have all been eradicated. At the moment, there are only traces of advanced pets.\u201dSu Ping nodded.Even the general public knew about the classification of the unclaimed territories.Generally speaking, there were five classes labeled ABCDEF, representing five different danger levels.Amongst the five, unclaimed territories of Class A, B, and C were unstable areas. They became unclaimed territories because of the frequent appearance of space fractures.As for Class D and Class E territories, the former became deserted after the war. Nuclear radiation and mutated germs were abundant in such areas. Many Astral Pets living there were infected by the germs. Large-scale plagues and illnesses would break out. That was why such areas were isolated and marked as deserted regions.Class E unclaimed territories on the blue planet were places with scant resources and harsh environments. There were no human settlements in those places. Such areas became habitats for wild Astral Pets and gradually, they became unclaimed territories.Su Ping intended to seek confirmation, \u201cI heard that middle-rank and advanced pets frequent Class B unclaimed territories. Is that correct?\u201dClass B Unclaimed territories were rather dangerous. At the very least, the freshly graduated battle pet warriors were not qualified to go. Those fresh graduates would have to go to Class C unclaimed territories or even Class E areas to explore and train. If their performance was outstanding, after three to five years, they could be assigned to Class B unclaimed territories.Fan Yujing admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s mostly middle-rank pets there. The advanced pets are rare. We only get to see advanced pets once every two to three explorations, unlike Class A areas. I heard that you can find advanced pets on every trip to Class A territories, and the mortality rate is high!\u201dAs he spoke of Class A unclaimed territories, Fan Yujing couldn\u2019t help but feel appalled.\u201cA one in three chance...\u201d Su Ping blinked.That was acceptable.He could deal with it as long as they didn\u2019t encounter any Beast Kings.Soon, the SUV got onto the city\u2019s highway. When they were passing through the toll gate, they were allowed to go without having to swipe their card.Just then, Su Ping found out it was because of the SUV\u2019s license plates.The license plates were the pass.On special occasions, they could even run a red light!Su Ping had heard stories about the benefits enjoyed by explorers. Once, an explorer shot down some civilians who had offended him.News reported that the explorer was taken into custody and punished with confinement.As to whether that explorer was really \u201cconfined,\u201d nobody knew. The public would not probe, either.Anyways, it implied that explorers didn\u2019t have to be sentenced to death when they killed someone!The general public was well aware that explorers were not people to be offended.After running down the highway for about an hour, they finally arrived at the border of the base city.Few people resided at the border. Buildings were far apart from each other, but the roads here were wide and sturdy.Su Ping looked up from his car window. It was a high wall that stood towering like a giant.That was the base city\u2019s border wall.The wall could fend off the invasion of wild Astral Pets, and more importantly, invasion of Beast Kings!\u201cIt\u2019s so high...\u201dThe views he saw on television were entirely different after seeing the wall in person. Su Ping was amazed at the wall; it was at least two to three hundred meters tall. This was a magnificent project!Down the highway was an asphalt road that was surrounded by weeds and wilderness on the sides.Ahead of them was the exit leading to outside the city. Lamps lit the road.As they were driving out of the city, there would be occasional cars driving in the opposite direction, brushing past them.\u201cThey are adventurers.\u201d Fan Yujing glanced at them and explained, \u201cThey didn\u2019t pass the exam to join any teams after graduation, and have to work for private companies as battle pet warriors.\u201dSu Ping nodded.There were two paths for the battle pet warrior. The first was to join the explorers\u2019 teams.The second was to work in a private company.Although most of the private companies could not compare to federal departments, some forces were financially sound. They could offer benefits as good as those enjoyed by the explorers\u2019 teams, but such private companies would have stricter requirements. Their recruiting requirements were even stricter than those for the explorer\u2019s teams!Soon, they arrived at the city exit.Armies were stationed there day and night. When Fan Yujing and the team arrived, over a dozen people landed their gazes at the party.\u201cInspection.\u201d An army officer stepped over.Fan Yujing rolled down the window and presented a medallion with a black wolf head.The army officer stood in awe and saluted immediately, then he allowed Fan Yujing to pass, not even looking inside the vehicle.The path to leave the city extended for dozens of meters. One could imagine how thick the wall was.The land outside the base city was overgrown with underbrush.Such a wasteland could not be seen inside the base city, except for the shantytown at the outermost edge of the city where some kids lived.But that wasteland had several roads which led to different directions.The roads were not as clean or intact as those in the city, but it posed no difficulty for SUVs. Fan Yujing chose a path, hurried on, and arrived at a fortress after more than half an hour.The fortress had been built with huge boulders; there were regular buildings inside.\u201cThis is the base for unclaimed territory No. 38.\u201dFan Yujing parked his car outside the base and got off with Su Ping and Li Ying. Fan Yujing presented his medallion and they were allowed in without any hindrance.It was more like a marketplace in the city.It was lively.It was nighttime, but there were road lamps illuminating the place. The area had a power supply.There were shabby stalls along the road, displaying strange things; weird-looking plants, young cubs, and even eggs.At the sight of the eggs, Su Ping remembered the one he had.He wondered if his egg had been hatched...\u201cThe goods we obtain during explorations will be sold here and on the explorers trading web as well,\u201d Fan Yujing smiled and said, \u201cBecoming an explorer is a risky choice but it is a profitable job as well. If you\u2019re lucky, you can make in one mission what the general public has to spend a life to make.\u201dSu Ping nodded. He had little interest in becoming an explorer.As for making money.At the end of the day, explorers were wage earners as well. The real money-making people were the big potatoes that could enjoy the company of beautiful ladies and wine in the base cities. Those big potatoes didn\u2019t have to risk their lives or work hard. They simply filled their pockets by taking a portion of the explorers\u2019 hard-earned money.Soon.Fan Yujing showed Su Ping to a small one-story house.\u201cGuys, I have a new friend for you!\u201d Fan Yujing shouted, laughing.Two people stepped out of the house. One of them was a middle-aged man in his forties with a bulky build. He had whiskers. His muscles attested to his strength.The other person was a young lady, slender and pretty. Su Ping knew her.\u201cYour sister?\u201dSu Ping was astounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Fan Xiaoyu rested her hands on her hips in anger.Fan Yujing couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. \u201cMy sister is here to train herself. She\u2019s in third-grade and about to graduate. It was actually an arrangement set by the academy.\u201dSu Ping was speechless after seeing Fan Yujing\u2019s smug smile. How careless would Fan Yujing have to be, to be this happy knowing his sister would tag along to explore the unclaimed territory?Su Ping blurted out his question, \u201cWill she slow us down if she comes with us?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dFan Xiaoyu was fuming with rage.\u201cSlow them down??\u201dSince young, she had been the one pushing others forward!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: A Test of StrengthPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56: A Test of StrengthFan Yujing smiled as he gave Su Ping an explanation, \u201cBrother Su, you don\u2019t have to worry. My sister won\u2019t be joining us. She\u2019s not qualified enough yet, and can only stay in the outer edge of the unclaimed territory. She will be safe with other teams protecting her.\u201dThis resolved Su Ping\u2019s concern. He followed up with another question out of curiosity, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that, usually, students can only train in Class C unclaimed territories?\u201dFan Yujing sounded proud, \u201cMy sister\u2019s grade is excellent and the academy she is studying in is a famous one as well. So, she was directly recommended to the Class B unclaimed territory. The academy contacted an explorers\u2019 team that is as good as ours to escort her all the way here, and to accompany her to explore the outer edge.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dSu Ping had a clear idea after that.That was the advantage and benefit that came with studying in a famous academy in the upper town, much better than the benefits offered by the academy Su Ping\u2019s sister was in.Both academies proclaimed themselves to be famous, but the one in the upper town was well-known in the entire Longjiang Base City, whereas the other was in the lower town area, and its fame was limited to the lower town and the outskirts.\u201cHmm!\u201dFan Xiaoyu retorted with a proud face, \u201cDon\u2019t belittle me just because I\u2019m a student. I am a middle-level battle pet warrior at the upper position of the fourth rank. Besides, I have two fifth rank pets. In most cases where sixth rank pets are not involved, I can protect myself and get away!\u201d\u201cThat is good.\u201d Su Ping nodded.That kind of strength could earn her a place amongst the best students in the academy, similar to the master of that Lightning Rat. Fan Xiaoyu was even better in comparison. She was one step away from becoming a fifth rank battle pet warrior.Fan Xiaoyu raised her eyebrows. She was unhappy because of Su Ping\u2019s calm reaction.But she could only feel vexed about it, since she recalled the strength Su Ping demonstrated at the pet store. She was outstanding as it was, but Su Ping was freakishly strong.\u201cThis is so annoying!\u201dShe clenched her teeth.The whiskered strong man had been watching while Su Ping and Fan Xiaoyu were bickering. He asked after the two finished their exchange, \u201cFan, is this your new friend?\u201dFan Yujing said at once, \u201cCaptain, this is the genius that I told you about. Brother Su, this is our captain, Fan Ganglie, an advanced battle pet warrior.\u201d\u201cHeroes come from the young. Brother Su, you\u2019re so young. You are twenty, right?\u201d Fan Ganglie\u2019s voice was hoarse and vigorous, but gentle at the same time.Su Ping said, \u201cI\u2019m 18.\u201d\u201cOnly 18?\u201dFan Xiaoyu and Fan Yujing were stunned speechless.How could Su Ping be this strong at the age of 18?This fact came as a greater shock to Fan Xiaoyu because she was also 18. They had the same age, but the gap between their strengths was huge!Fan Ganglie and Li Ying were shocked as well. They knew that Su Ping was young, but he turned out to be even younger than he looked. He was practically their younger brother.How could they ask a kid like Su Ping to go with them and explore the space fracture?Su Ping frowned as he saw their reaction. He only went there to finish the quest. He didn\u2019t want to deal with unexpected problems or to be forced to prove something.\u201cWell...\u201d Fan Ganglie looked at Fan Yujing with questions and doubts in his eyes.He had heard stories about Su Ping from Fan Yujing. But once he met him in person, Fan Ganglie found it hardly believable.A man at the age of 18 could defeat Fan Yujing. Wouldn\u2019t this man be a top student that could only be trained by some big forces? Why would someone like him show up to explore the unclaimed territory with them?Fan Yujing collected himself. The meaning of the looks Li Ying and the captain darted at him were obvious. Fan Yujing himself was hesitating. Could it be that it wasn\u2019t Su Ping that injured him but someone else?If that was the case, then inviting Su Ping was a big mistake.Fan Yujing was in a dilemma.Fan Ganglie intervened with a remark. He didn\u2019t question Su Ping directly, which would be a foolish action taken only by people with low EQ. Intending to feel Su Ping out he said, \u201cBrother Su, our trip to the space fracture will be incredibly dangerous. If you want to join our team, you have to register first. Besides, for better cooperation during the battles, we hope you can call out your pet and let us get to know each other.\u201dAfter the pet testing, they could have a better understanding of Su Ping\u2019s abilities.Su Ping could tell what was on Fan Ganglie\u2019s mind and knew that this was a subtle way to sound him out. Su Ping felt troubled but he had to play along. He stressed, \u201cSure, but note this: I\u2019m not here to join your team. I\u2019m only here to help. I will leave as soon as the lost pet is found. I do not plan on becoming an explorer.\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for the quest, he wouldn\u2019t have gone there in the first place.Wasn\u2019t it more convenient to make money while sitting at the store? Why would he want to challenge death out in the field?Fan Ganglie was surprised. Soon, he came back to his senses. If Su Ping had such abilities, given his talent, it was natural that he wouldn\u2019t want to be an explorer.\u201cOf course,\u201d Fan Ganglie agreed. \u201cBut the Federation has rules. Anyone that goes into a space fracture must be an explorer. Brother Su, you can first sign up as a temporary explorer. While the benefits enjoyed by temporary explorers are fewer, the basics are all there.\u201d\u201cTemporary?\u201d Su Ping raised his eyebrows.\u201cThat\u2019s right. You will see that in the contract when you sign up later,\u201d Fan Ganglie said seriously, \u201cNow, Brother Su, please let us see your pet.\u201dSu Ping took a glance at the group. They all appeared to be concerned about whether his ability would be up to standard. If not, Fan Yujing would have wasted his trip and they would have to see their hope fall through.\u201cOkay.\u201dThe mysterious runes telltale of a pet space appeared as he summoned with his mind.The Little Skeleton fell out from that pet space and smashed onto the ground, accompanied by a crisp sound.\u201c...\u201dNobody said a thing.But soon, the scattered bones were reassembled. The Little Skeleton patted its head, looked down to check the bone blade inserted by its hipbone, and then ran to Su Ping. The Little Skeleton looked around for enemies.\u201c...\u201dStill, nobody made a sound.The Little Skeleton was looking around. The other people\u2019s faces appeared to be twitching.After a long while, Fan Xiaoyu became the first to talk. She whispered her question, \u201cIs this your pet?\u201d\u201cWhat else do you think?\u201d\u201c...\u201dFan Xiaoyu was hopping mad.\u201cThat\u2019s just a skeleton. What\u2019s there to be proud of!\u201dFan Yujing felt embarrassed as well. If something went wrong with Su Ping\u2019s strength, then he would be the one making the biggest mistake.He took up the unpleasant task and asked, \u201cMr... Su, do you only have this one pet?\u201dSu Ping nodded. \u201cThis is the only one I have for now.\u201dFan Yujing felt he had been slapped in the face.Fan Xiaoyu looked at Su Ping in confusion. \u201cDon\u2019t you run a pet store? How come you only have this one pet?\u201d\u201cAre you implying that wedding planners have to get married every day?\u201dOut of habit, Su Ping retorted even though he knew that wasn\u2019t what Fan Xiaoyu meant. Su Ping turned around, then he looked at the space by the side and gave the Little Skeleton a mental instruction, \u201cIntermediate Saberplay!\u201dThe Little Skeleton heeded the order and drew its blade at once.Other than Fan Ganglie, maybe no one else was paying close attention to the little thing; they didn\u2019t see how the Little Skeleton drew its blade.Fan Ganglie barely saw a blur. By the time he could see clearly, the little skeleton was holding the blade tightly.The Little Skeleton\u2019s posture was a bit intimidating!Slash!Bang!!The bone blade was wielded. An explosive sound was heard and a ray of black saber aura was released. The ground burst open, leaving a deep crack all of a sudden!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: The Explorers\u2019 WarehousePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 57: The Explorers\u2019 WarehouseFan Ganglie, Fan Xiaoyu, and all the others were dumbfounded.The dark crack on the ground that extended for seven to eight meters with a width of half a meter startled them all.None of them, except for Fan Ganglie, would have withstood such a powerful attack!Was it done by the Little Skeleton?Was it a low-level skeleton?!When the group cast their looks on the Little Skeleton again, they soon noticed there was something different about it.The Little Skeleton\u2019s bones were not pale white, but black. There seemed to be some blood-red glow flowing inside its bones, just like blood. Besides, there was a red gem the size of a thumb in the Little Skeleton\u2019s skull. The gem was like the Little Skeleton\u2019s soul and it kept emitting a weird scarlet luster.\u201cThis is...\u201dFan Ganglie shifted his attention back to Su Ping. A skeleton that could cut this deep with one slash had to be a middle-rank pet, at the very least!Moreso, when did skeletons ever learn to use saberplay? Not to mention such a formidable saberplay. It implied that the skeleton had undertaken professional saber training!Su Ping told the Little Skeleton to sheathe its blade and asked the group, \u201cIs this good enough for you?\u201dFan Ganglie\u2019s eyes shone. He was convinced that it was just a sampling of what the skeleton was capable of; its real power was still hidden. That was to say, the skeleton was a pet at the middle-level at the very least.Although Su Ping was probably not an advanced battle pet warrior as Fan Yujing had speculated, he was already qualified by explorer standards.\u201cNo problem.\u201dFan Ganglie stopped his mind from wandering and said to Fan Yujing, \u201cTake him to the registration booth. Afterward, take him to the warehouse to pick a suit of armor. We will leave when you\u2019re ready. There\u2019s no time to lose. I\u2019m afraid that the Blood Fox will be in danger if we waste any more time.\u201dFan Yujing nodded and told Su Ping, \u201cBrother Su, come with me.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t send the Little Skeleton back to the pet space. He bent over to take out the Blood Bead from the Little Skeleton\u2019s skull, in case it would fall off and get lost during battles when they entered the space fracture.He put the Blood Bead into his pocket and said the name of the storage space in his mind to place the Blood Bead there.Having finished this, Su Ping went after Fan Yujing.Fan Xiaoyu, who had been on the side, told them to wait for her and hurried over.Once they were far enough from the one-story house, Fan Xiaoyu threw a curious look at the Little Skeleton who was staggering along behind Su Ping. She asked, \u201cWhat kind of skeleton is this? It seems to be out of the ordinary.\u201d\u201cOut of the ordinary?\u201d Su Ping asked, \u201cDo you mean extraordinarily handsome like me?\u201dFan Xiaoyu didn\u2019t know how to respond to that. \u201cForget I asked.\u201dThen the rest of the trip became quiet.Minutes later.They arrived at a magnificent building in the heart of the base. Fan Yujing took the lead and went in. The hall was spacious but few people were there, taking into account it was in the dead of night.They approached an automatic machine placed by the side of the hall. Fan Yujing asked Su Ping, \u201cDid you bring your ID card? If not, stand there and have your iris scanned. The system will record your information and gain access to the civil affairs bureau. From here on, everything about you will become a secret.\u201dOf course, Su Ping didn\u2019t bring his ID card with him. He followed Fan Yujing\u2019s instructions and stepped on the footboard in front of the machine. Fan Yujing helped Su Ping to go through the options on the screen: \u201cExplorer Registration-Temporary-Authentication-Iris Authentication,\u201d etc.A rock-arm camera slowly moved in front of Su Ping.The red light glowed and Su Ping\u2019s iris was scanned.At the same time, everything about Su Ping was presented on the screen.Su PingGender: MaleAge: 18Education: Blue Dragon Kindergarten, Saint Oriole Elementary School, Saint Oriole Middle School, and Baiwu High SchoolFamily Connections:Mother: Li QingruSister: Su LingyueFather: Su YuanshanMother\u2019s Identity...Sister\u2019s Identity......Su Ping saw the excruciatingly detailed information of him; so specific that even his hair was introduced. The surprise he felt gradually shifted to terror.Just with this registration, his background information since he was a kid was collected and even information about his family was recorded in the file!It meant that the explorers\u2019 identity archive system had a high security clearance and could directly acquire related information from other departments whenever necessary.When the Fan siblings saw Su Ping\u2019s age, they were stunned speechless. Su Ping was indeed 18 years old. He didn\u2019t lie about his age.\u201cRegistered,\u201d Fan Yujing said. He closed the information sheet and did not take another look.Su Ping thought it would take longer. \u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201dFan Yujing smiled. \u201cThe registration for temporary explorers is simple and does not need to be approved, as long as you\u2019re invited by a team. I invited you from the team\u2019s intranet so you can register directly.\u201dThen, Fan Yujing tapped on the screen and inserted a string of passwords. Soon, their team\u2019s web page was pulled up.On the page were five profile pictures.Below the five profile pictures was Su Ping\u2019s profile picture.\u201cFrom now on, you will be our team\u2019s temporary explorer. You have to be approved at the base if you want to become a full-time member.\u201dFan Yujing went on with a smile, \u201cBut since you\u2019re a temporary explorer, you won\u2019t receive any allowance at the base and you won\u2019t have an exclusive vehicle assigned. But in other aspects, you will enjoy the same benefits as the other explorers. Anyone that provokes you, as long as they are the initiators, you can just punch them at will. But don\u2019t kill people so casually. After all, you\u2019re not a formal explorer and you would be subject to a small punishment.\u201d\u201cJust a little punishment?\u201dSu Ping was taken aback. Once again, he had a sense of the privilege enjoyed by explorers.That being said, the explorers protected the base. They enjoyed a higher status than the army. It wasn\u2019t rare for explorers to have such rights.If any regular person could kill someone like an explorer could, it would be bitterly disappointing to explorers. For the higher-ups at the federal government, that would result in a greater loss.\u201cOf course, strength is the rule. A regular person unknown to fame would not be safe in these turbulent days,\u201d Su Ping said to himself. He couldn\u2019t say that all explorers were good people. If some hot-tempered explorer killed an average Joe, then that average Joe\u2019s family would have no means to fight back.That was sad for the weak.Life was never equal in any world!\u201cBrother Su, although you are a temporary explorer, you have the basic rights of explorers. During every mission, merits will be distributed according to performance. When merits are accumulated to a certain extent, there will be different welfare benefits. Merit points can also be used to purchase various needed items.\u201dFan Yujing smiled and went on, \u201cBrother Su, let me take you to the explorers\u2019 warehouse. Brother Su, you can pick anything you need.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Su Ping\u2019s eyes glowed. This was interesting.Soon, they arrived at another building. They logged in on a computer and entered the interface of \u201cWarehouse for Benefit Redemption\u201d.Fan Yujing introduced, \u201cThere are armors, weapons, and cultivation methods you may need, such as the four basic augmentation skills. Academies only teach from the first to the fourth ranks. But here, you can find augmentation skills from the first to the ninth rank.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: EntrancePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58: Entrance\u201cReally?\u201dSu Ping\u2019s eyes were sparkling.He had not gone through any teaching in the academy and was utterly ignorant of the augmentation skills.He was clearly unqualified as a battle pet warrior.Fan Yujing helped Su Ping open the Warehouse for Benefit Redemption on the screen. A whole variety of items were displayed on the list.There were different categories of weapons, cultivation methods, treasures, pets, etc.\u201cDragon Scale Armor can fend off a physical attack from low to middle-level Astral Pets and greatly reduce the harm inflicted by advanced pets...\u201d\u201c\u2018Magical Ape Physical Exercise\u2019: when achieving great mastery, you will be able to dodge bullets, act with agility and have abilities that can compare to an eight-rank Astral Pet...\u201d\u201cRippled Ice Fruit: this fruit can help enhance the skill strength of a pet of the water family by two fold.\u201d\u201cBlue Dragon Hatchling: aptitude still unrated. 50,000 credits required for redemption.\u201d...Su Ping\u2019s eyes were confused by the large variety of items. In the cultivation method category, apart from the augmentation skills, there were other skills for physical exercise that battle pet warriors needed, and methods for using various types of weapons.\u201cI can select whatever I want, right?\u201d Su Ping asked Fan Yujing.Noticing the looks in Su Ping\u2019s eyes, Fan Yujing had a bad feeling. He produced a forced smile and said, \u201cBrother Su, I cannot afford the high-value items. I can give you whatever you want among the low or middle-value items.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t make things difficult for Fan Yujing. He chose the four basic skills from the first to the sixth rank which were sold at a cheap price.\u201cIs that all?\u201d Fan Yujing was surprised to see that Su Ping didn\u2019t want anything else. He had thought that Su Ping would select many low and middle-value items which were coveted by the explorers. They could never have enough consumables.Fan Yujing thought about it and picked a middle-level armor for Su Ping, one that could fend off attacks from most of the fifth rank pets. The armor could offer some protection.After the credits were paid, the machine spat out a receipt.Fan Yujing told Fan Xiaoyu and Su Ping to wait there while he went to the warehouse to pick up the items.A few minutes later, Fan Yujing came back carrying a black armor in his hand.\u201cHere are the cultivation methods.\u201d Fan Yujing gave Su Ping a small mobile HDD.Su Ping took it and put it in his pocket, so he could send the mobile HDD to the storage space.\u201cHere\u2019s your armor.\u201d Fan Yujing gave Su Ping the armor; afterward, all of them went back to the one-story building.After they left the base, Fan Ganglie, Li Ying and Fan Yujing summoned their pets.Bang! Bang! Bang!Three enormous beasts came out from cracks connecting to their contract spaces. They were middle-level Astral Pets, Rock Japalura.Once Rock Japaluras came of age, they would become fifth-rank Astral Pets. Among all the fifth-rank Astral Pets, Rock Japaluras would not stand out in combat. However, they were useful as steeds to save them from walking and could even climb up steep rocks and cliffs.The three of them hopped onto the Rock Japaluras\u2019 backs. Su Ping had no riding pet. So, Fan Yujing shouted, \u201cBrother Su, come with me.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t turn down the kind offer. He picked up the Little Skeleton next to his feet, concentrated astral powers on his legs, and hopped onto the back of that Rock Japalura.Having sensed a strange presence, the Rock Japalura was a bit agitated. It flicked out its long and thin tongue to show its reluctance.Fan Yujing patted the Rock Japalura and comforted it for a while to calm it down.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dFan Ganglie grabbed the reins and took the lead to head out.Fan Yujing and Li Ying followed him closely.They pressed forward at full speed under the night sky.Once they were unable to see the base behind them, Li Ying mobilized his astral power and opened up the pet space again to call out a flying pet.That was a bird less than half a meter tall. As soon as the bird came out, it spread its wings and darted into the night sky; it moved at such a fast speed that the bird disappeared within a blink.A moment later, Li Ying said all of a sudden, \u201cFive kilometers that way, there\u2019s a small pack of beasts.\u201dFan Ganglie gave an instruction without hesitation, \u201cGo around them!\u201dThe Rock Japaluras climbed the hills on the side. On the steep hill, Su Ping had to grab Fan Yujing\u2019s shoulders to keep himself from falling.Half an hour later.Su Ping began to see some light on the horizon.He saw a cluster of fire on a plain, a crowd had gathered over there.As they moved closer, Su Ping could tell that it was a temporary campsite. Seven to eight meters above the campsite was a vertical crack that was shaped like an eye with a length of over twenty meters and a width of seven to eight meters. Inside the crack was a spinning, twisted space.\u201cThat\u2019s the space fracture?\u201d Su Ping was surprised. It was the first time that he had seen one.Soon, they rode the Rock Japaluras to the campsite. At the gate, the three of them called the Rock Japaluras back to the pet space and then presented their explorer\u2019s chips to enter the campsite.\u201cFan?\u201dWhen they entered the base, someone greeted them.Fan Ganglie stood there and cast a glance at the person who called his name. A lean young man with a black dagger hanging on his belt stepped over.Under the glare of the bonfire by the gate, a long scar on the young man\u2019s cheek was made visible. The scar was somewhat ferocious and added a gloomy nature to that handsome face.\u201cSorry to have kept you waiting.\u201d Fan Ganglie smiled as he saw the young man and then he introduced him to Fan Yujing and Li Ying, \u201cThis is the lead fighter in the Black Wolf team, Lin Mokong, an advanced battle pet warrior!\u201d\u201cAdvanced battle pet warrior?\u201d Fan Yujing and Li Ying were stunned. They introduced themselves as well and said, \u201cNice to meet you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen your files.\u201d Lin Mokong nodded to them slightly and cast his eyes on Su Ping on the side. \u201cAnd this is?\u201dFan Ganglie answered at once, \u201cThis is a helping hand Xiao Fan has solicited, Brother Su Ping.\u201dLin Mokong sized Su Ping up and down and asked, \u201cBrother Su, were you an explorer before?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Su Ping replied.Lin Mokong frowned. He had already noticed this from his observation. Su Ping was in too good a shape. There were no scars on him. He didn\u2019t appear to be a senior explorer.Besides, the armor Su Ping was wearing was too ordinary. Lin Mokong could tell at once that while this was a middle-level armor, it was a cheap one. Rarely any explorers would wear this type of armor in the Class B unclaimed territory.Fan Ganglie could tell that Lin Mokong was unhappy. So, the former explained hurriedly, \u201cThis is an urgent matter. Brother Su is not an explorer but his abilities are up to standard.\u201dLin Mokong glared at Fan Ganglie. The coldness in his eyes was evident. \u201cJust up to standard? If that were okay, then anyone could be an explorer!\u201dThat being said, there was no going back. Lin Mokong\u2019s opposition would not bear any meaning at the moment. He just cautioned them, \u201cListen to my instructions when we go in. Otherwise, don\u2019t blame me for being merciless!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that,\u201d Fan Ganglie promised at once. After all, he was the one who brought Su Ping there. He had to make sure Su Ping behaved.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Lin Mokong said and headed toward the space fracture.Fan Ganglie turned around, gathered the team, and followed after Lin Mokong.Fan Yujing was embarrassed by what had happened. He comforted Su Ping, \u201cBrother Su, all explorers are like this, outspoken. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Su Ping nodded.Of course, he wouldn\u2019t mind because he was seeing Lin Mokong in the same way.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Tiger Scale TapirPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59: Tiger Scale TapirThey stepped to the center of the campsite and stood under the space fracture.\u201cTry to keep up.\u201dLin Mokong hopped straight into the space fracture in the sky without looking back. Soon, he vanished inside it.Fan Ganglie reminded Fan Yujing, \u201cThis is Brother Su\u2019s first time here. Take care of him.\u201dWith that said, Fan Ganglie hopped into the space fracture as well.Li Ying followed him closely.Fan Yujing told Su Ping, \u201cAfter you.\u201dSu Ping took a close look at the space fracture. Making sure that it was danger free, he hopped into that fracture.The moment he dived into that vortex, Su Ping felt space and time were shifting. It was very similar to what he experienced when he entered a cultivation plane.Suddenly, he landed on the ground and felt a burden being lifted off of his body. Eventually, Su Ping was able to look at the surrounding view. There were people hurrying to and fro behind the space fracture. They were explorers of other teams.Su Ping looked up. It was a crystal-clear galaxy above his head. Outside the atmospheric layer, there were some stars and planets of various sizes and at different distances. Evidently, this had to be the unknown world Fan Yujing mentioned.The place was dark. It was also nighttime in that world.Luckily, after all was said and done, Su Ping was a battle pet warrior with a better visual sense than others. He could see things within 30 meters. But he only saw blurred objects beyond the 30 meter mark.Whoosh!With a flash of light, Fan Yujing came as well.Everyone was there. Fan Ganglie took out a map from his backpack. \u201cThis is the most updated map of the areas we have explored. This is the place we went to the last time we came here. The Blood Fox was lost here. Let\u2019s go and search.\u201dEveryone was looking at the map, trying to remember the layout and markings.Su Ping was sure that the price of the map was high. He took a close look and remembered all the routes and lines depicted.For the moment, nobody knew how vast the world inside this space fracture was. If possible, Su Ping would stay clear of the dark areas noted on the map, since they were still unexplored.Lin Mokong asked, \u201cLi Ying is in charge of reconnaissance, right?\u201dLi Ying nodded. He called out that reconnaissance bird from before. That bird dived into the night sky ahead.Lin Mokong posed another question, \u201cWhat is the furthest place the bird can reach?\u201dLi Ying replied, \u201cAbout 7,500 meters.\u201d\u201cOnly 7,500 meters...\u201d Lin Mokong frowned. Compared to what the scouts of his team could do, this distance was quite short. That being said, Li Ying was merely a middle-level battle pet warrior. Lin Mokong couldn\u2019t ask too much of him.The former then said to Fan Ganglie, \u201cLet\u2019s spread out, shall we?\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Fan Ganglie was thinking about the same thing. He summoned a huge wolf, its body completely black. This was a Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf with a seventh-rank bloodline, very aggressive and suitable for combats at night. It was an adult, judging by the size of this one, unlike the still-growing pets that were used by students at the academies.Lin Mokong looked at this Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf. He lifted his hand and summoned a python longer than 10 meters. This was a Codson Python. While it was a python, it was incredibly poisonous, one of the most difficult kinds to tackle among all the seventh-rank pets.Fan Ganglie and the others appeared to be worried as they saw this huge python. Li Ying and Fan Yujing in particular, they seemed to be afraid and reluctant to be near this python.Usually, ferocious and bloodthirsty pets like this python would easily go out of control. With their abilities, it could instantly kill them with ease once it fell into a frenzy.They truly believed in Lin Mokong\u2019s abilities; he wouldn\u2019t lose control over a seventh-rank pet. That being said, this was a matter of life and death. Nobody could afford to be careless.They had to admit that the Codson Python was intimidating. The moment it appeared, explorers from the other teams cleared a path out of instinct.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Fan Ganglie shouted.The Codson Python and the Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf set off side by side and dashed into the darkness ahead.The further they were away from the campsite at the exit of the space fracture, the duller the darkness would be. No firelight could be seen at all.Since they entered the space fracture, Su Ping had become quite careful. His mind was more focused than when he was in cultivation planes. He extended the reach of his senses to their limits to feel the surroundings, instead of relying on information collected by Li Ying alone.Li Ying alerted the team all of a sudden, \u201cThere\u2019s an unknown Astral Pet up ahead.\u201dHe could only discern the number and size of the Astral Pets from the information relayed by the bird, but not the species.Fan Ganglie wished not to have unexpected problems popping out. He asked, \u201cIs there another way around it?\u201dLi Ying closed his eyes and opened them a moment later. \u201cAll the other routes have Astral Pets there, more than one.\u201dLin Mokong proposed, \u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look, then. We will withdraw if that\u2019s an advanced Astral Pet.\u201dFan Ganglie did not oppose this. It was a simple decision. He was thinking about doing the same thing.Soon, they were near that area. A giant elephant-sized star pet was found in a forest lake in front of them, drinking water by the lake.Fan Ganglie took out something like a night-vision device from his backpack. He took a look and said with relief, \u201cThat is a sixth-rank Tiger Scale Tapir.\u201d\u201cKill it.\u201d Lin Mokong went on to make a prompt decision.Fan Ganglie nodded and was ready to engage. But Su Ping frowned. Something felt wrong to him. Seeing that Fan Ganglie was about to take action, Su Ping stopped him. \u201cWait a minute.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dFan Ganglie turned around and looked at Su Ping with confusion.Lin Mokong knitted his eyebrows. He turned to look at Su Ping as well. He had no good feelings for this new person that had no experience in exploring unclaimed lands. If Su Ping could not produce anything useful, Lin Mokong would tell him to keep his mouth shut for the rest of the trip.Su Ping asked Fan Ganglie, \u201cDid you get a clear view? Is that the Tiger Scale Tapir?\u201dFan Ganglie was surprised by the question. He replied with a frown, \u201cIt\u2019s the middle of the night, but I can see it clearly.\u201d\u201cLet me see.\u201d Su Ping asked to borrow the night-vision device.\u201cAre you making a scene or are you afraid of death?\u201d Lin Mokong pulled a long face and glared at Su Ping with his ice-cold eyes.Li Ying was unhappy as well. Clearly, Su Ping was worried that the beast was not a Tiger Scale Tapir but something else. How timid Su Ping was! Besides, Li Ying was sure that their captain would never lie or boast about anything he wasn\u2019t sure of. Otherwise, they would have lost their lives many times!Fan Yujing felt embarrassed. He whispered to Su Ping to persuade him, \u201cBrother Su, the captain surely saw it clearly.\u201d\u201cRight.\u201d Fan Ganglie was very certain about the pet he had just seen. Besides, he was convinced that his eyes were not worse than Su Ping\u2019s. If he had made a mistake, then there was no way that Su Ping could tell!Su Ping\u2019s face was clouded as he heard their words.This was a decisive matter in his life. He would not pretend at the moment.His eyes were cold as he glared, concentrating an emotionless look on Lin Mokong. \u201cAfraid of death? Do all explorers act like you? Simply charging forward without thinking, like morons?\u201dLin Mokong was furious. \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for the fact that Su Ping\u2019s glare made his heart tremble, Lin Mokong would have drawn the dagger right then.Su Ping\u2019s eyes were as cold as they could get. \u201cFeel the temperature. During this season, if I remember correctly, Tiger Scale Tapirs would not come out for no reason.\u201cBesides, Tiger Scale Tapirs don\u2019t drink much water. They stay hydrated by eating small insects. When they are thirsty, they eat plants to get water. They are omnivorous pets.\u201dThe others were surprised.They felt the breeze blowing. It was chilly. This puzzled the other guys.Fan Ganglie stared at Su Ping. \u201cAre you being serious?\u201dSu Ping glared right into his eyes coldly, \u201cDo you think I am kidding?\u201dSomehow, Fan Ganglie felt his heart beat faster as he looked into Su Ping\u2019s eyes. It seemed as if the Su Ping next to him was a completely different person. When they were at the explorers\u2019 base, Su Ping appeared to be gentle and mild. However, at the moment, Su Ping\u2019s eyes were as cold as if he had seen a dead body. Was this really a person that had never taken part in excursions of unclaimed territories?!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He took out the device to take another look. This time, he was extra careful and was certain that the animal was a Tiger Scale Tapir.\u201cIs it a Tiger Scale Tapir?\u201d Lin Mokong looked at him.Fan Ganglie was in a bad mood. He handed the device to Lin Mokong and said, \u201cTake a look for yourself.\u201dLin Mokong put the device on and was sure in an instant, \u201cIt is a Tiger Scale Tapir!\u201dHe gave the device back to Fan Ganglie. As the former looked at Su Ping, he turned hostile. Su Ping was courting death by being this extremely suspicious and having cast doubt in the group, making them loose too much time!Fan Ganglie sensed Lin Mokong\u2019s hostile intentions. He heaved a sigh but kept it to himself. Fan Ganglie knew that this was Su Ping\u2019s mistake. But to turn on each other during a mission was a taboo. Fan Ganglie said, \u201cLet\u2019s finish the job first.\u201d\u201cHmm!\u201dLin Mokong glared at Su Ping. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for being harsh on you if you spout nonsense again!\u201dWith that said, Lin Mokong let his Codson Python charge toward the Tiger Scale Tapir by the lake at once. It was just a sixth-rank pet. His Codson Python was more than qualified to kill that Tiger Scale Tapir!By the lake, the Tiger Scale Tapir sensed the Codson Python was approaching quickly. It turned around and the moment that it did, Fan Ganglie, who was using the device to observe the battle couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cOh no!\u201dLin Mokong was surprised to hear this cry of terror. He took out his device to look as well.This look covered him in goosebumps!The Tiger Scale Tapir was drinking water by the lake so they could only see one of its flanks. But the moment it turned around, the other half of its body was revealed. There were only bones!The other half of its head had no flesh and blood, and snake-like tentacles were twisting in its eye sockets; there was an octopus-like creature with tentacles over its skull!This was indeed a Tiger Scale Tapir but one that had died a long time ago!Just then, Su Ping was wondering if he had misjudged the situation as well. But Fan Ganglie\u2019s scream made him realize that he was right. He reacted quickly, taking away Fan Ganglie\u2019s device to look.\u201cIt\u2019s a seventh-rank Soul-Spirit Beast!\u201d Su Ping\u2019s pupils contracted in fear.This was a kind of creature that was in the range of lower beings; he had encountered its kind in the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. The creature was small but powerful. More importantly...Bang!The Codson Python had zig-zagged its way to the Tiger Scale Tapir rapidly. The latter did not move away. Instead, under the control of the Soul-Spirit Beast, the Tiger Scale Tapir was running toward the Codson Python.This was just what the Codson Python wished for. It opened its bloody mouth and swallowed the Tiger Scale Tapir at once.\u201cSh*t!\u201dSu Ping was scared by this. He shouted at Lin Mokong with a grave voice at once, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to see your pet dying, make it spit out the Tiger Scale Tapir and get back here. Now!\u201dLin Mokong was taken aback. How could Su Ping, a person he despised, shout at him? The murderous intent was rising high in Lin Mokong\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201dLin Mokong could also tell that the Tiger Scale Tapir was being manipulated by something. But then again, many low-level undead beings could manipulate other creature\u2019s bodies. His Codson Python was a pet of the seventh rank. What harm could the Tiger Scale Tapir do even if it were alive, not to mention a dead one?Since the two were fighting, Fan Ganglie hurried to interfere. All of a sudden, they heard a miserable cry coming from the distance.They looked over.The Codson Python that had swallowed the Tiger Scale Tapir was rolling around on the ground in extreme pain. At the same time, dark air covered the Codson Python. That was dark energy that was unique to undead creatures.\u201cYou idiot!\u201dSu Ping gnashed his teeth. He knew it was too late.He turned his focus away from the pets and warned Fan Ganglie at once, \u201cWe need to leave now. That Codson Python is a goner. The thing sticking on the Tiger Scale Tapir is a seventh-rank Soul-Spirit Beast. Unless your pet is its natural enemy, none of the pets of the same rank will be able to defeat it!\u201d\u201cSoul-Spirit Beast?\u201d Fan Ganglie, as well as Li Ying and Fan Yujing stood in confusion.Lin Mokong, who was about to hit Su Ping, was both surprised and angered by Su Ping\u2019s words, \u201cWhat are you saying now?\u201dFan Ganglie had never heard about this Astral Pet but the fact that Su Ping had noticed the odd situation added credibility to his words. Fan Ganglie interposed with his remark, \u201cIf this is a seventh-rank pet, we can kill it if we work together.\u201d\u201cIf there\u2019s only one, sure, of course,\u201d Pulling a long face, Su Ping spoke quickly, \u201cBut the Soul-Spirit Beast is just a parasite living inside a Bloodsoul Beast. Usually, where there\u2019s a Soul-Spirit Beast, there is Bloodsoul Beast. If I\u2019m not mistaken, that is not water in the lake. It is blood and the Bloodsoul Beast is right there!\u201d\u201cBloodsoul Beast?\u201dAgain, the unfamiliar name of a pet shocked them.\u201cWith a seventh-rank Soul-Spirit Beast transferring nutrition to it, this Bloodsoul Beast must be of the ninth-rank at least or even a Beast King!\u201d Su Ping squeezed the words out from between his teeth.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that he was in an unclaimed territory and that he had to rely on those people present to explore the area, he would have already made his escape.\u201cNinth rank? Beast King?\u201dThose words snapped the others into reality. They didn\u2019t know why Su Ping knew this, but they could see how the Codson Python was struggling in pain in the distance. They shivered in fear.Something that could defeat the ferocious Codson Python in an instant and in such a weird way had to be something extremely lethal.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dFan Ganglie made a prompt decision.Lin Mokong was surprised. After he came back to his senses, he said in a hurry, \u201cAre you leaving my pet?\u201d\u201cWell...\u201d For a moment, Fan Ganglie didn\u2019t know what to say. He was the one who invited Lin Mokong to join them. It would be bad publicity if people knew he was asking Lin Mokong to abandon his pet and escape.\u201cYou punk. Are you trying to retaliate against me? Are you making this up and want to see my pet die for nothing?!\u201d Lin Mokong turned his looks to Su Ping; his eyes were beaming with murderous intent.Su Ping never liked this person. Since Lin Mokong was delaying their retreat, again and again, the murderous intent in Su Ping was stimulated as well. He kept his glare fixed on Lin Mokong and said, \u201cShut up if you want to stay alive!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dLin Mokong\u2019s face was fierce, and he immediately drew his sword.At this moment, there was a sudden splash of water in the distance.In a rush, they looked over. The upper half of the Codson Python that was struggling by the shore had fallen into the lake, stirring up the waters.The next moment, three blood-red tentacles that were as thick as the Codson Python reached out from the lake, entangling the Codson Python, and dragging it down until it disappeared.\u201cWhat...?\u201d Lin Mokong was shocked speechless.He felt the connection between him and the Codson Python break at that moment.The only thing he felt from the Codson Python\u2019s consciousness before it died was extreme fear.\u201cHurry!\u201dOne look and Su Ping could tell it was the Bloodsoul Beast. He could not say more. He turned around and ran away at once.Fan Ganglie, Li Ying, and Fan Yujing followed Su Ping out of instinct with their hearts full of terror.Lin Mokong came back to his senses. He looked awful and his expression changed several times. A moment later, he made up his mind and went after Fan Ganglie and the others.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t expect Su Ping to give him orders. \u201cYou want to take another route?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we return home now?\u201d Su Ping asked.\u201cBut...\u201dHe was met with such a strange and dangerous situation the moment he came out. Li Ying was indeed a little scared, but he wasn\u2019t expecting Su Ping to continue helping him in the search for the Blood Fox.Although he was a settler and had the guts for the job, a settler was still a human. He only had one life. Anyone would be afraid of death!Fan Ganglie took a deep look at Su Ping\u2019s back. He said to Li Ying, \u201cListen to Brother Su. Things can get even more complicated. We can\u2019t afford to delay any further!\u201dLi Ying had opened his mouth to continue; still, he paused and could only say in the end, \u201cI understand.\u201dHe immediately sensed his pet and checked the other routes.At this moment, Lin Mokong had caught up with a few people. His face was extremely gloomy. He had sacrificed his high-level pet as soon as he arrived; it was as if he had cut off a piece of his own flesh and blood!Upon seeing these figures, a venomous look appeared in Lin Mokong\u2019s eyes, but he quickly kept it in check.\u201cHuh?\u201d Su Ping turned his head and glanced behind him. He frowned a little when he saw Lin Mokong\u2019s gloomy eyes. His eyes returned to the front, but there was a flash of coldness in them.\u201cFound it,\u201d Li Ying suddenly said.\u201cThe few Astral Pets on the east path have already moved elsewhere. We won\u2019t bump into them if we make a run for it now,\u201d Li Ying said quickly.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Su Ping ordered immediately.Fan Ganglie could only swallow what he was about to say since Su Ping had already beat him to it.Fan Yujing and Li Ying glanced at Fan Ganglie out of habit, to seek confirmation. Seeing that he didn\u2019t object, they quickly followed behind Su Ping.\u201cBrother Lin, we will think of a way to make it up to you when we return,\u201d Fan Ganglie said to Lin Mokong, who was behind him.Lin Mokong\u2019s expression turned even colder. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I was careless.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault. After all, it\u2019s a new space rift with too many unknown Astral Pets. It\u2019s best for us to be careful,\u201d Fan Ganglie whispered.Killing intent flashed in Lin Mokong\u2019s eyes, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Guided by Li Ying\u2019s scouting, the few of them moved forward, getting closer and closer to the depths of the area where the blood fox had gone missing.\u201cThere are Astral Pet demon beasts on the first few routes. Only one route looks viable,\u201d Li Ying reported.Hearing that it was a similar situation, the expressions of the few people changed slightly.Su Ping immediately said, \u201cLet\u2019s take the route with Astral Pet demon beasts first. We can get closer to observe.\u201dFan Ganglie hesitated for a moment. As the saying went, once bitten twice shy. He was a little worried, but after thinking about it, their luck couldn\u2019t be so bad; it was unlikely that they would encounter another strange incident so soon.\u201cAccording to what Brother Su said, let\u2019s get closer to observe first,\u201d said Fan Ganglie.\u201cAll right.\u201dFan Yujing and Li Ying had no objections.Lin Mokong kept quiet ever since he lost the Codson Python. He was too quiet.Soon, they arrived at a valley under Li Ying\u2019s lead.Su Ping reached out to Fan Ganglie.Fan Ganglie understood what he meant; he passed his detection equipment to Su Ping.Su Ping took a look from afar and saw that it was an ordinary fifth-rank Astral Pet. Without any hesitation, he asked his Little Skeleton to attack.Little Skeleton was very small. Under Su Ping\u2019s order, it immediately drew out its bone blade and dashed toward the fifth-rank Astral Pet demon beast.\u201cIt\u2019s a fifth-rank Death Spirit.\u201d Li Ying, who was using the instrument to see the Astral Pet demon beast, handed his equipment to Fan Ganglie.Fan Ganglie took a look and heaved a sigh of relief. He was about to ask his Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf to make a move when he suddenly remembered the tragic end of the Codson Python. As a reflex, he asked Su Ping, \u201cIs there a problem with this thing?\u201d\u201cI already launched an attack,\u201d Su Ping said.Fan Ganglie was stunned for a moment. He quickly looked over with the equipment and saw that the Little Skeleton beside Su Ping had arrived before the Death Spirit at some point in time. Little Skeleton, who was less than half a meter tall, was vastly different from the Death Spirit, which was almost four meters in size. However, the Little Skeleton suddenly leaped up as it approached. A gust of dark black energy was swept out!Pfft!As soon as the Death Spirit turned around, it used its sharp claws to counterattack. However, its body suddenly froze as the dark blade aura swept past. Then, it turned into two pieces and fell to the ground, slowly dissipating as black energy.Fan Ganglie was stunned. Although he had seen Little Skeleton\u2019s strength before, he was still a little surprised to see it again.Killing a fifth-rank Death Spirit with a single slash was definitely something that only a pet of the sixth rank and above could do!Moreover, although the Death Spirit was an ordinary Undead pet, it was extremely difficult for an ordinary pet to defeat it. This was because its body was made of energy; only energy attacks were effective to defeat it.Lin Mokong also saw this scene with his equipment and his eyes flashed.After Little Skeleton killed the Death Spirit, it immediately jumped to its corpse and absorbed the leftover death energy.Su Ping took another look at the surroundings. After making sure there was no danger, he said to Fan Ganglie and the others, \u201cWe can move on.\u201dOnce they started walking, Su Ping followed them and positioned himself in the middle of the group.When they passed through the canyon, they met some Undead skeletons scattered on the ground along the way. They woke up immediately when they perceived the scent of living creatures, and formed a group to attack Su Ping and the others.However, all of them were low-level skeletons; the strongest was only at the fourth-rank. They were directly knocked into pieces by Fan Ganglie\u2019s Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf.After leaving the canyon, a majestic giant peak appeared in front of everyone.It was an extremely massive mountain.Its top pierced the sky, seemingly extending into the endless starry sky.Su Ping felt as if he were standing at the foot of a giant. They didn\u2019t even count as ants when they stood in front of this immense peak. They were too small.\u201cThe Blood Fox was lost at the base of this mountain peak.\u201d Fan Ganglie looked at the mountain peak with a grave expression.\u201cI remember the way. Should we go to the place where the Blood Fox was last seen?\u201d Li Ying asked. His eyes roamed around Fan Ganglie and Su Ping, asking for their opinions.Fan Ganglie nodded. He then glanced at Su Ping. \u201cIt\u2019s highly possible that we\u2019ll encounter a high-level pet on this mountain peak. It\u2019s very dangerous. We met an unknown high-level pet in our previous visit. The team was almost scattered; we managed to escape by sheer luck.\u201dSu Ping nodded. He searched in his pocket and took out the Fire Dragon Fruit Bottle from the storage space. It was an important thing for him to find the Blood Fox.Fan Yujing summoned two pets and prepared to fight at any moment.Fan Ganglie called out another small pet. It was a multi-eared monkey. It was only a fifth-rank pet, but it had a keen hearing and was able to detect pets on land.Li Ying also summoned a sixth-rank, rock-type pet. It was an earthworm beast. It crawled on the ground and scouted the road ahead.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Calling for HelpPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 62: Calling for Help\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dLi Ying led the way; everyone else followed behind him and guarded the surroundings.The mountain road near the giant peak was uneven and filled with pits and potholes. Some of them were actual footprints left by giant beasts, while others were pits created by Astral Pets battling. The pits were not filled with rainwater; it was thick, dark blood teeming with germs and emitting a foul stench.Fan Ganglie and the others were seasoned explorers, and still, they frowned because of the pungent smell.Su Ping ordered Little Skeleton to stand guard by his side and keep an eye for any sudden attacks.\u201cThis is...\u201dNot long after he left, Li Ying made a sudden stop. His gaze was focused on a brownish-colored rocky depression on the surface. There was a hand hanging there, and a black metal bracer was covering it.Fan Ganglie\u2019s expression changed slightly. With a thought, he got the Multi-eared Monkey to move forward and take a look. The Multi-eared Monkey jumped a few times and arrived in front of the hand. It was a severed arm. Fan Ganglie held the arm that the Multi-eared Monkey had retrieved. After looking at it for a while, his expression turned ugly. \u201cThis belonged to someone from another battle team. It\u2019s a Black Cloud Gold Bracer; someone who can afford such a good bracer is definitely not weak...\u201dLin Mokong, Fan Yujing and the others also recognized the bracer. Their expressions changed. The hand owner was most likely a highly-ranked battle pet warrior or a rather wealthy sixth-rank battle pet warrior. He had actually died there. It was clear that he had encountered a terrifying danger and had no chance of escaping.Su Ping saw the severed end of the arm. His heart skipped a beat and he said, \u201cShow it to me.\u201dFan Ganglie was a little confused. But he still handed the severed arm to Su Ping.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can recognize this bracer.\u201d Lin Mokong sneered when he saw Su Ping\u2019s seemingly pretentious observation of this arm.Su Ping picked it up and took a closer look at the severed spot. His pupils shrank slightly, but he returned to normal in an instant. He continued to check the hardness of the arm as if nothing had happened, as well as the completely undamaged bracer. After flipping it around for a moment, he handed it back to Fan Ganglie.\u201cDid you discover anything?\u201d Fan Ganglie asked. He was quite concerned about Su Ping\u2019s opinion. After all, Su Ping had noticed the latent danger earlier that no one else discovered. Moreover, he had noticed how Su Ping seemed to have turned a blind eye to the harsh environment around him. It was a normal reaction for experienced settlers, but it was strange for a newbie like Su Ping who had never been on expeditions!However, everyone had their own secrets. It would be inconvenient to ask him about it, and he might possibly be offended because of it.\u201cNothing.\u201d Su Ping looked as calm as ever.Lin Mokong chuckled.Su Ping gave him a side glance and suddenly raised his hand.Pa!A crisp slap sounded.Fan Ganglie, Fan Yujing, and Li Ying were all stunned. Lin Mokong was the most astonished. He felt the burning pain on his face. It was unbelievable!He had just been slapped! Being a highly-ranked battle pet warrior, his status was so high that he could be the captain of a second-rate battle team like Fan Ganglie. And yet, he had just been slapped by a nameless boy?!After being in a daze for a second, he suddenly came back to his senses. His eyes had turned bloodshot as he quickly drew his saber. \u201cBrat, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dFan Ganglie and the other two reacted and hurriedly held his hand. Fan Ganglie hurriedly persuaded, \u201cBrother Lin, Brother Lin, let\u2019s talk it over. It\u2019s not good to fight right now, it\u2019s too dangerous here. I\u2019m afraid everyone will die if we draw attention with our inner scuffles!\u201dLin Mokong was so angry he was about to explode. He had been slapped. What else could he say?He had tried his best to unsheathe his saber, but his hand was being held down by Fan Ganglie; he was momentarily unable to pull it out. This shocked him again; he didn\u2019t expect Fan Ganglie to be that powerful. They were both at the seventh-rank, but Fan Ganglie was stronger than him!Li Ying and Fan Yujing were frightened as well. They broke up the fight and blocked Su Ping and Lin Mokong to prevent them from fighting.\u201cBrother... Brother Su, let\u2019s talk things out. Why did you hit him?\u201d Fan Yujing looked at Su Ping, who had a calm expression. He was a little anxious. The other party was an advanced battle pet warrior, not someone he could offend.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Li Ying was also scared out of his wits. He didn\u2019t expect the mild and student-like Su Ping to be so hot-tempered. He struck people on a whim, and he had even slapped a highly-ranked battle pet warrior. Even they had to do their best to be in his good graces.\u201cHe asked for it,\u201d Su Ping said calmly. Although the environment was dangerous and internal strife that was not good for survival, since plots and schemes would eventually emerge, the other party was obviously very prejudiced against him and would take the first chance to trick him in a heartbeat. Since that was the case, there was no need to tread lightly.Furthermore, he knew that he would be unable to fight even if he made a move; Fan Ganglie and company would definitely pull him back. If he took a step back, he would not be afraid even if they were to fight. It was just nice to know that he could kill this person in case something bad happened.The easiest way was to kill someone who could threaten him as soon as possible.\u201cUh.\u201d Fan Yujing and Li Ying were both surprised to hear Su Ping\u2019s words. Lin Mokong was the one who mocked them earlier, but he dared to hit him just because of that. He was too bold. Wasn\u2019t he afraid of establishing a deadly grudge?\u201cYou!!\u201d Lin Mokong\u2019s blood vessels were about to explode. He tried to pull out the saber with all his might, but Fan Ganglie\u2019s hand was like a pair of steel pincers that kept it in place.\u201cBrother Lin, it\u2019s Brother Su\u2019s fault. I\u2019ll apologize on his behalf and complete the mission first, all right?\u201d Fan Ganglie persuaded.Lin Mokong glared at him angrily. He gritted his teeth. He knew that Fan Ganglie would not let him fight with Su Ping. Otherwise, they would all die if they attracted any monsters.Perhaps the other party had predicted this and dared to attack him. In other words, he had received the slap for nothing!\u201cDamn it, all of you deserve to die. Not even the sight of you being sliced and diced would quell my anger!!\u201d Lin Mokong roared in his heart, filled with violence. His hand was tightly gripping the handle of the blade; he struggled and endured for a while before he slowly released it.He cast a cold glance at Su Ping and turned around. \u201cI\u2019ll remember this. I\u2019ll take my revenge when we get back to the base!\u201d He said those words on purpose, to give Su Ping a false impression that he wouldn\u2019t do anything during the operation.Fan Ganglie heaved a sigh of relief when he saw Lin Mokong holding himself back. He said to Su Ping, \u201cBrother Su, don\u2019t be rash. I won\u2019t help you again.\u201dSu Ping smiled after seeing his serious expression. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSu Ping\u2019s nonchalant attitude gave Fan Ganglie a headache. He had no choice but to say, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We have to complete the mission as soon as possible and return to base as fast as we can!\u201dLi Ying and Fan Yujing looked at each other and let out sighs of relief. Li Ying was still leading the way. Not long after, they saw some dismembered corpses on the ground. They belonged to the other explorers.By looking at the scattered limbs, they could estimate that three or four people had died. Lying about there were even some heads infested with tiny worms that had left them beyond recognition.\u201cBe careful.\u201dThose corpses were putting Fan Ganglie and company on edge. They were all extremely vigilant.Swoosh!Suddenly, a colorful smoke signal flew out from a dense forest ahead.\u201cIt\u2019s a distress signal!\u201d Fan Ganglie\u2019s expression changed when he saw this. He immediately moved and said, \u201cQuick!\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Undead EnslavementPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63: Undead EnslavementThe few of them quickly ran to the place where the distress signal had been sent. Very soon, they arrived at the forest outskirts near the slope. They heard the roars of beasts and strange, ear-piercing shrieks coming from inside. Occasional tremors were telltales of an intense battle being waged.\u201cQuick!\u201d Fan Ganglie was the first to charge into the forest.The forest was filled with strange trees, surrounded by a thick death aura; skeletons were scattered all over the place.Lin Mokong was trying to run slower so that he could fall behind the group; that way he would be able to catch Su Ping unaware to take his revenge. However, he realized that Su Ping was running the slowest, on the verge to be left out of the protection of the group. He cursed the b*tch in his heart and could only accelerate.Fan Yujing noticed that Su Ping was the slowest. He was puzzled. He didn\u2019t know what he was thinking, so he lowered his speed to prevent Su Ping from being too far from the team. As a result, the team formation looked like a long line.After Su Ping and Fan Yujing entered the forest, they saw a large patch of fallen trees. It was a clear sign of battle.They followed the wake of destruction and ran deep into the forest. Soon, they saw Fan Ganglie, Lin Mokong, and the others. They were supporting two figures. A man and a woman from what they could see. There were a few pets guarding them, while other pets were fighting in front of them.\u201cIs that... an eighth-rank Magical Corpse Beast?!\u201dFan Yujing\u2019s pupils were constricted when he saw the huge figure that the Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf had pounced at. He wore a look of horror.The Magical Corpse Beast was around seven to eight meters tall. It was like a pile of bones and mountains of flesh lying on the ground. Its entire body was covered in nasty-looking bones. Sharp bone spears or huge arms were constantly emerging from the pile. The way the beast attacked was strange and unpredictable.\u201cMagical Corpse Beast?\u201dSu Ping was surprised to see the monster. He took a closer look at the skeleton\u2019s body. A strange expression appeared in his eyes. It was as if... a chef were selecting the ingredients he liked.At the same time, Little Skeleton\u2019s consciousness was connected to his mind; the thoughts and emotions conveyed were filled with excitement and eagerness. It was extremely active.Su Ping came back to his senses and comforted it. He followed Fan Yujing and moved closer to where Fan Ganglie and the others were.\u201cIt\u2019s an adult eighth-rank Magical Corpse Beast!\u201d Fan Ganglie\u2019s expression was ugly. He even felt a tinge of regret for having rushed over. He turned to the two people beside him and said, \u201cYou two, if you have any pet that can fight, summon it. My Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf alone is no match for it.\u201dThe man and woman were covered in wounds. It was obvious that they had gone through a fierce battle. The man smiled bitterly and said, \u201cThis is the only earth-shield pet I have left.\u201d\u201cMy Holy Flame Bird can still fight.\u201d The woman bit her lip, her eyes full of unwillingness. A bird with golden feathers stood beside her. It was an eighth rank Holy Flame Bird. However, its feathers were in a mess; the flames were dim, and there was a ghastly wound close to the ribs on its chest that occasionally spilled golden blood.Fan Ganglie couldn\u2019t help but take another look at the bird. Even among the pets of the eighth rank, the bird was considered an extremely powerful existence. How could it end up in such a state?As if he could see the confusion in Fan Ganglie and Lin Mokong\u2019s eyes, the man hesitated for a moment before revealing his true feelings. \u201cThis Magical Corpse Beast is not ordinary. It should be close to the advanced eighth-rank.\u201d\u201cClose to the advanced eighth-rank?!\u201d Fan Ganglie and Lin Mokong\u2019s pupils constricted due to the shock.Li Ying and Fan Yujing were listening at the side; their faces paled in fright when they heard this. The two of them had already experienced a difficult situation in front of a seventh-rank Astral Pet demon beast, not to mention a monster of the eighth-rank. What a wicked gift!Fan Ganglie came back to his senses and asked, \u201cOnly the two of you remain from the original team?\u201dThe man said with a bitter smile, \u201cWe encountered another eighth-rank Bone Dragon on the way here. The group was separated. We might have had a chance to kill this thing if the entire team were here. It wouldn\u2019t be as complicated, since we can\u2019t even escape at the moment.\u201d\u201c...\u201dFan Ganglie and the others were speechless. What kind of luck was this?Moreover, they had actually encountered two eighth-rank Astral Pets?\u201cEveryone, you...\u201d The man hesitated for a moment, but he still took a deep breath and looked at the few present seriously. \u201cWhy not let your pets stay behind first? If we continue to fight with this thing, all of us will be left behind.\u201dSeeing Fan Ganglie and the others\u2019 expressions change, the man quickly said, \u201cAfter we leave, we will compensate you for your losses. We will also reward you. Ye Chenshan won\u2019t go back on his word!\u201d\u201cYe Chenshan?\u201d Fan Ganglie was about to fly into a rage when he heard the name. He was shocked. \u201cYou are Ye Chenshan?!\u201dLi Ying and Fan Yujing looked at him in shock. They were extremely familiar with this name.\u201cThe Settler of the Golden Dragon Medal, Ye Chenshan?\u201d Lin Mokong was stunned for a moment. His expression changed slightly.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Ye Chenshan took out a Golden Dragon Medal from his bosom and took it back after giving them a glance. He said, \u201cI hope that you can consider it. Time waits for no one. If we don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019m afraid that none of us will be able to leave.\u201dFan Ganglie\u2019s expression changed. He looked at the Bloodthirsty Demonic Wolves that were fighting with the Devil Bones in the distance. The wounds on the latter\u2019s body gradually increased. Although the Vampiric Werewolf was a seventh-rank agile pet, it was helpless in front of the Devil Bones Beast. It was like a hedgehog that had nowhere to go. It could only rely on its agility to dodge to the left and right to barely stall the beast.\u201cAll right!\u201d He gritted his teeth and eventually agreed.If he could get another Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf as compensation, it would make up for his loss. Most importantly, he could also obtain Ye Chenshan\u2019s favor.Ye Chenshan heaved a sigh of relief, but his expression soon changed before he continued speaking. A large number of skeletons suddenly crawled out from the surrounding ground, blocking their escape route.\u201cIt\u2019s the Undead Summoning!\u201d Everyone had ugly expressions.Just as they were about to command their pets to break out of the encirclement, the summoned skeletons suddenly moved to circle around them and rush toward the Magical Corpse Beast.This scene stunned everyone.\u201cCaptain, your pet has accompanied you for such a long time. It\u2019s such a pity to abandon it like this,\u201d Su Ping said.Fan Ganglie was stunned. He could not help but look at Su Ping. Then, he thought of something and his eyes fell on Little Skeleton that stood beside him. Little Skeleton was emitting a rich dark energy that enveloped its body. At first glance, it looked like a mysterious existence shrouded in black mist.\u201cThis Undead Summoning is yours?\u201d Fan Ganglie was shocked. This was a high-level Undead Pet Skill. Judging from the size of the surroundings, it was obvious that it was extremely familiar with it. It was even more terrifying than an ordinary Undead Summoning!Su Ping didn\u2019t answer him. He was giving instructions to Little Skeleton to control the skeletons around him.This was Little Skeleton\u2019s ability. It was the Undead Enslavement. As long as there were skeletons around it, they could be directly enslaved. The strength of its ability depended on the number of skeletons around it. Of course, most of the skeletons were around the Magical Corpse Beast. If Little Skeleton\u2019s spiritual power was strong enough, it could directly enslave it!That was because the Magical Corpse Beast was also an undead creature.However, it was obvious that the Little Skeleton was only at the third rank. Although its spiritual power was far stronger than that of a third-rank creature, it was still too difficult to enslave an eighth-rank creature. It could only enslave a sixth-rank creature.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Full AssaultPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 64: Full Assault\u201cWhat on earth is that??\u201dBoth Ye Chenshan and the woman beside him gazed at the seemingly tiny skeleton at Su Ping\u2019s feet in great surprise. The encroaching dark energy made it hard to see clearly, but they still saw how the small creature managed to force a great number of skeletons under its command.It wasn\u2019t rare to find smaller Astral Pets with big power. But this didn\u2019t usually apply to skeletons, whose strength was often dependent on their size.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a special kind adept at spiritual attacks...?\u201d They wondered with curious looks.The dark energy cloud around Little Skeleton was rapidly shrinking. Like a whale feasting on schools of shrimps, it absorbed the energy into its dark-colored bones. It then pulled out a sharp bone blade from between its ribs and ordered the controlled skeletons to charge at the Magical Corpse Beast as a team.Ye Chenshan and his partner were greatly shocked again. Moments before, they thought this particular creature was like a mage who stayed behind protection. They weren\u2019t expecting to see it running toward the enemy with a weapon in hand.While marching, the random bone creatures reformed into different shapes using the powerful will of resentment lingering behind. Some turned into human skeletons, while some became more Astral Pets. Nevertheless, every one of them looked fearless.The boney reinforcements madly latched themselves onto the Magical Corpse Beast using their nails and teeth, which helped the Bloodthirsty Demon Wolf to catch a breather. Their number wasn\u2019t their only weapon\u2014each one of them was at least a fifth or even a sixth rank. They could instantly tear the wolf apart if they were to change targets at a moment\u2019s notice.Infuriated, the Magical Corpse Beast summoned two thick bone whips from its massive body and began using them to swipe the skeletons away.The attack seemed to be working at first, when many skeletons were shattered to pieces no matter how fast they could move. However, more dark energy would soon emerge from the destroyed bones to patch them up.Roar!A horned skeletal tiger jumped onto the Magical Corpse Beast and began randomly chomping off its more vulnerable body parts.The maddened beast unleashed a barrage of bone spikes from all over its body, which removed the skeletons still attacking it. But it was of no use\u2014in the next second, endless swarms of skeletons joined the front line to overwhelm it with their sheer number.Snap!By hiding among the skeleton army, Little Skeleton got close enough to the Magical Corpse Beast and slashed at it.A deadly blade aura reached the beast like a tidal wave and shattered several of its supporting bones.\u201cWhat is\u2014\u201dEveryone present watched the ongoing battle with a look of disbelief. Especially Lin Mokong, who simply could not believe his eyes.That thing is at the upper position of the eighth rank! That Su Ping bastard can handle it alone?! he questioned in his mind.Lin Mokong suddenly felt regretful for his earlier actions as cold sweat started to trickle down. More so when he noticed that Su Ping looked completely unruffled in this dangerous situation. What Su Ping showed him until this point suggested that there was probably a powerful clan or organization supporting him from behind the stage. If he ended on Su Ping\u2019s bad side, he would be offending many more people.Fan Ganglie recovered from his shock first and spoke to Ye Chenshan, \u201cSince Mister Su is so good, maybe we should attempt to kill this Magical Corpse Beast instead?\u201dEveryone could see that Fan Ganglie had just become greedy after considering the potential reward they could earn from killing the creature, and it was logical. Judging from the creature\u2019s level, whoever finished it off could be directly promoted to a \u201cSilver Wing\u201d settler.Instead of answering right away, Ye Chenshan checked the young man he had been curious about.With that kind of age, he originally thought that this young member was only a lowly handyman in the team. He was proven otherwise.\u201c...Fine. Let\u2019s give it a shot.\u201d He made the decision after looking at Su Ping\u2019s calm stance for a while.\u201cGot it!\u201d Fan Ganglie sighed in great relief and turned to Lin Mokong. \u201cMister Lin, please assist us.\u201dLin Mokong also recovered from his thoughts and clenched his teeth.\u201cFair enough.\u201dFrom his pet space, he summoned two Astral Pets\u2014a sixth-rank adult Flame Bird at the peak of its average potential, and an intermediate seventh-rank Six-Armed Gorilla, which was the current strongest Astral Pet he could use.The gorilla was almost eight meters high when standing. It was full of chunky muscles covered by dark-brown fur. Four of its six arms were carrying weapons, while the remaining two hands had spiky knuckles equipped. It also had a black chain vest protecting its chest area.By summoning the gorilla, Lin Mokong had revealed his trump card. Thanks to his careful training and well-prepared equipment, this intermediate seventh-rank pet could face enemies of the same rank\u2019s upper stage. Or, it could even keep a lower eighth-rank opponent busy for a while.\u201cMy word...\u201d Ye Chenshan was once again astounded. \u201cThat gear should cost at least several million. That\u2019s enough money to buy another advanced pet.\u201dSeeing Lin Mokong going all-out, Fan Ganglie also decided to provide all he had\u2014a rock-type, lower stage seventh-rank Mountain Mover, and an eighth-rank Azure Quetzalcoatl. This Azure Quetzalcoatl was a half-breed between a dragon-type pet and something weaker. All things said, it was still an eighth-rank battle pet.\u201cAugmentation!\u201dFan Ganglie unleashed astral power from his body and cast four basic augmentation effects of the seventh rank consecutively. Such enhancement was potent enough to make a crippled old man run faster than an Olympic champion.Apart from those basic moves, Fan Ganglie also applied a special skill to the Azure Quetzalcoatl called Double Team.Under its effect, the creature would split into two.This was Fan Ganglie\u2019s core skill which was meant to double the strength of his strongest Astral Pet. The clone was not a simple phantom to trick the senses\u2014it could fight just like the host.\u201c*Whistle* This team is pretty good,\u201d Ye Chenshan commented, \u201cMaybe the best amateur team I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201dBut things didn\u2019t go as planned. As soon as Fan Ganglie and Lin Mokong ordered their pets to attack, the body of the Magical Corpse Beast suddenly exploded, sending countless bone spikes into the surrounding area that immediately wiped out the skeleton army.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Lethal Undead ArtsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: Lethal Undead Arts\u201cMountain Mover, quick!\u201d Startled, Fan Ganglie quickly told his pet to create several rock walls as their protection. The timely move successfully shielded the group from the flying bone spikes.By expanding their astral perception over the wall, they saw the Magical Corpse Beast was somewhat smaller than before. That massive attack had cleansed everything in its range except for a small pile of bones.\u201cThat was Necro Blast.\u201d Ye Chenshan grimaced. \u201cOnly a Magical Corpse Beast with exceptional aptitude can learn this skill.\u201d\u201cGo for it!\u201d Su Ping called out to Little Skeleton in a merciless voice.The \u201cbone pile\u201d broke apart and revealed several skeleton warriors inside. At the center of the group, Little Skeleton stood like a king accompanying its army, while its body was still covered by a creepy dark fog.Roar!That was Little Skeleton\u2019s Deadly Roar skill. Despite its handy size, Little Skeleton unleashed an outcry more deafening than a thunder. Those who heard the reverberating sound felt their blood was about to freeze up.This skill wasn\u2019t much weaker than a dragon\u2019s roar, and was usually enough to scare off common creatures.The Undead Magical Corpse Beast was not frightened by this, but its movements were halted for a brief moment.Little Skeleton and the remaining skeletons rushed at the Magical Corpse Beast once again.Meanwhile, Fan Ganglie and Lin Mokong woke up from the trance caused by the terrifying display and both told their pets to join the fight.Two Azure Quetzalcoatl beasts spat out lightning bolts and poison clouds that quickly disintegrated the beast\u2019s bone structure.The Mountain Mover created a fissure in the land directly below the beast, still with the hopes of trapping it.Similarly, Lin Mokong\u2019s Flame Bird unleashed balls of burning lava at the target.The Six-Armed Gorilla used its weapons to physically smash at what it could reach, while using its \u201cfree hands\u201d to defend.Roarrr!The Magical Corpse Beast looked weakened after using the Necro Blast. But, being an entity that was close to the upper eighth-rank, it could still retaliate by shooting more spikes into the sky.The Flame Bird had one of its wings punctured by a spike and it tumbled down from the air. Seeing this, Lin Mokong quickly sent it back to his pet space.The Azure Quetzalcoatl was quick enough to evade the spikes, after which it spat another poison puddle at the Magical Corpse Beast which further corroded its husk.Thanks to Fan Ganglie\u2019s precise control, the Azure Quetzalcoatl and its shadow rapidly removed the entire outermost shell from the beast.Meanwhile, the gorilla stayed in a melee range to attract the beast\u2019s attention.The battle had not been won just yet. Without any forewarning, the bones around the Magical Corpse Beast began pulsing, as if its entire body were breathing.\u201cThis isn\u2019t good. It\u2019s going to use a Spirit Shock!\u201d Ye Chenshan exclaimed.Fan Ganglie and Lin Mokong quickly realized what that meant. A Magical Corpse Beast was one of the few Undead Astral Pets good at spiritual attacks, while \u201cSpirit Shock\u201d was one of its infamous big moves.\u201cGet out of there!\u201dThey failed to pull their pets back in time. A strange energy ripple from the Magical Corpse Beast disrupted the area around its body and rapidly expanded.Whirrrr!Even at a distance and with the protection of his astral power, Su Ping still felt his head go dizzy, as if someone had knocked him with a hammer.He gathered his willpower and forced his mind to stay clear. Fortunately, the shock wasn\u2019t directed at him, or he would have fainted on the spot.\u201cMy weak body could be a problem...\u201d Su Ping saw the others completely unaffected and realized he urgently needed to raise his astral power. Right then, his astral power was only at the third rank, which was a level commonly seen in students at the academy.All the Astral Pets in the immediate vicinity of the effect stopped moving. Little Skeleton too, was spacing out. Its superior willpower was not enough to help it withstand a direct Spirit Shock like that.More bone spikes flew over, aimed at the currently immobile Astral Pets.A large bone spike destroyed Little Skeleton\u2019s body.Two of the gorilla\u2019s arms were pierced, and its chain vest also had a giant hole in the middle. Luckily, the attack didn\u2019t entirely go through its body.In the sky, the Azure Quetzalcoatl had its neck and wings punctured. Its double had been utterly destroyed.The Magical Corpse Beast did not stop there. Following the spike attack, it created a black vortex in front of them.\u201cThat\u2019s Black Annihilation!\u201d Ye Chenshan uttered.Fan Ganglie turned pale upon hearing that name. \u201cBut that\u2019s only possible for ninth-ranked undead types! What\u2019s the deal with this thing??\u201d\u201cJust run!\u201dFan Ganglie had completely forgotten about getting a trophy. There was no way he could survive a Black Annihilation, a ninth-rank attack.Similarly, Lin Mokong hurried to call his gorilla back.The problem was, their pets were still stunned by the Spirit Shock and couldn\u2019t move very fast. They had to get close enough to directly drag the pets back inside their pet space, but that would mean placing themselves dangerously close to the half-finished Black Annihilation.Wham!It was too late. The Magical Corpse Beast had sent the black vortex against the Azure Quetzalcoatl.In its stunned state, Fan Ganglie\u2019s partner only had enough time to raise a wing to shield itself.The astrally-enchanted wing was erased from existence like a thin paper close to the fire.\u201cNoooo!!\u201d Fan Ganglie yelled desperately.Slowly but surely, the vortex engulfed most of the Azure Quetzalcoatl\u2019s body; it could only muster up all of its remaining strength to resist.The vortex dissipated before it reached the Quetzalcoatl\u2019s head. It did not kill the victim just yet. With most of its body gone, the Azure Quetzalcoatl would soon die unless it received some kind of miraculous treatment.Fan Ganglie saw his pet giving him a sad and pleading look, yet he dared not go to the rescue, fearing that the Magical Corpse Beast could still use Black Annihilation again.The beast aimed another bone spike at the Azure Quetzalcoatl\u2019s head.The Azure Quetzalcoatl sensed its master\u2019s great despair. Losing hope, it slumped down as it waited for the inescapable death\u2014all the bleeding organs exposed on the floor would make sure this would happen in due time.Clash!The fast-approaching bone spike was intercepted by a blade aura.Little Skeleton rejoined the battlefield after reassembling its body, with an even thicker layer of dark energy and a more intense killing intent.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But how?\u201dEverybody saw how powerful that direct spike attack was. It basically grounded Little Skeleton to particles. It was commonly believed that a skeleton still needed most of its bones intact to be resurrected.Little Skeleton did not give them any more time to wonder. After unleashing another ferocious howl, it lunged at the Magical Corpse Beast, blade raised, while red sigils like blood veins coursed through its bones.This was the bloodline power of a Skeleton King.The Magical Corpse Beast felt threatened by Little Skeleton\u2019s display. It roared back and hastily shot out more bone spikes to stop Little Skeleton from approaching. But Little Skeleton was just too agile at the moment. It skillfully evaded all the attacks by either jumping or using its blade to parry.Rarrrw!!Once again, the Magical Corpse Beast began drawing dark pulses of energy to channel another Spirit Shock.\u201cThis is bad. It\u2019s doing it again!\u201d Fan Ganglie and Ye Chenshan wanted to warn Su Ping to back off.While maintaining his cold look, Su Ping sent another order to Little Skeleton.Huraaaa!It was Little Skeleton\u2019s Deadly Roar skill this time. At soon as the skill went off, the effect of Spirit Shock arrived, trying to disrupt Little Skeleton\u2019s consciousness again. However, Little Skeleton seemed completely unaffected this time. It kept running toward the Magical Corpse Beast at full speed.\u201cIt resisted the Spirit Shock??\u201d Fan Ganglie pointed out, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that skeleton has higher spiritual potential than that eighth-rank Magical Corpse Beast?\u201d\u201cThat can\u2019t be,\u201d said Ye Chenshan, \u201cIf so, it should have stayed behind to attack the enemy using spiritual attacks instead of charging ahead. Maybe it used some kind of special move to block off the skill.\u201dDeadly Roar was a pretty common skill that was easily found in tutorial books. Just like other similar skills, it was mainly used for intimidation. No one had noticed any defensive effects.Ye Chenshan glanced at Su Ping again; he kept a neutral attitude.\u201cHe knew this would work? Who is he, really?\u201d\u201cKill it!\u201d Su Ping remotely ordered again.He discovered this extra effect of Deadly Roar when traveling inside the Chaotic Realm of the Undead. Of course Deadly Roar was not intended for defense. However, using the skill would somehow fill Little Skeleton up with uncontrollable violence and rage, which could in turn neutralize the invasive effect of the Spirit Shock.Even so, Su Ping still had to tell Little Skeleton to use Deadly Roar at the exact moment, down to a single millisecond, for this to work out. To practice, he spent a long time facing off a ghost monster that only knew how to use spiritual attacks. And even so, he could only succeed about 7 times out of 10.The Magical Corpse Beast was halfway through another Black Annihilation. Before it could finish the skill, Little Skeleton was already upon its face. A simple slash was enough to destroy the incomplete vortex in the making.Next, Little Skeleton jumped onto the Magical Corpse Beast and began randomly chopping it at lightning speed. Its sharp bone blade cut through the beast\u2019s outer shell like a knife meeting butter. Within seconds, large pieces of bones and chips were blown off.The Magical Corpse Beast shrieked in pain and created a giant bone claw from its body to capture Little Skeleton, which was completely useless against Little Skeleton\u2019s rapid moves.The beast suddenly huddled into a ball and began rolling, hoping to crush Little Skeleton.The ground quaked as the giant bone ball madly twirled and bumped around, during which Little Skeleton was nowhere to be found.Fan Ganglie and Ye Chenshan feared that they would become the next target if Little Skeleton was killed. They would have escaped already, if they had not seen Su Ping still watching the battle with a plain look.\u201cHey\u2014hey, should we help out? We can\u2019t just stand here...\u201d the woman accompanying Ye Chenshan anxiously spoke to Su Ping.Lin Mokong and Ye Chenshan followed suit and all gave Su Ping a questioning look. They had to admit that Su Ping was their most dependable helper at the moment.Su Ping didn\u2019t answer. He was too busy keeping an eye on the Magical Corpse Beast.Rarrrw!!The rolling beast bellowed in great pain.It slowly came to a halt as black fog seeped out through its shell and slowly covered it up.The others stared at Su Ping again, not sure what exactly was happening.Su Ping breathed a sigh of relief and finally looked away from the battlefield. He gave the woman a friendly smile to thank her for her willingness to assist, before talking to Fan Ganglie, \u201cIt\u2019s done. Almost. You should pick up your Azure Quetzalcoatl. Maybe it can still be saved.\u201dFan Ganglie gave the Magical Corpse Beast an uncertain look. He couldn\u2019t see anything because it had been completely engulfed by the fog.He saw his Azure Quetzalcoatl still struggling on the floor. With clenched teeth, he moved closer so he could drag the creature back into his pet space. Meanwhile, his Mountain Mover acted as his cover.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Without getting first-aid from a masterful doctor, it would soon end up in an Astral Pet grave.Fan Yujing glanced at the fog warily. \u201cMister\u2014Mister Su, did your skeleton get it under control?\u201dHe stopped addressing Su Ping as \u201cbuddy.\u201d It would be extremely odd to call someone who just displayed terrifying strength in this way.\u201cSort of, yes.\u201dFrom what he sensed through the spiritual connection, Su Ping could tell that Little Skeleton was absorbing the Undead energy left behind by the Magical Corpse Beast.Earlier, Little Skeleton excavated a small hole on the body of the Magical Corpse Beast and dived in, in order to evade the \u201cbowling ball attack\u201d and easily tear the beast apart from the inside. Even the outer shell of the beast was unable to withstand its bone blade, let alone its vulnerable innards. That was to say, if this thing had any innards.\u201cShould we go there and finish it off?\u201d asked Li Ying. He didn\u2019t do so yet because he sensed something creepy coming from the fog.Su Ping shook his head and took out the bottled Fire Dragon Fruits. \u201cHas anyone seen a Fire-tailed Blood Fox around here?\u201dFan Yujing and Li Ying were taken aback by the question. They didn\u2019t think Su Ping still had this matter in mind after what just happened.\u201cA Fire-tailed Blood Fox?\u201d Ye Chenshan frowned. He decided to play it safe with Su Ping for the moment. \u201cNo, I\u2019m afraid we haven\u2019t. That thing in your hand is pet feed for fire-type pets, right? Are you here to capture the fox?\u201d\u201cThe fox is supposed to belong to someone in this team. I\u2019m here to help them search for it.\u201d Su Ping seemed disappointed.\u201cHelp?\u201d Ye Chenshan widened his eyes. He\u2019s not a member of their team? Makes sense... If he was, I would have heard of him.\u201cThank you, Mister Su...\u201d Fan Yujing just felt overwhelming gratitude filling him up. A moment earlier, he thought Su Ping was going to abandon their task.Su Ping simply gave Fan Yujing an unamused look. Come on, I\u2019m not helping YOU. It\u2019s the goddamned system forcing me.\u201cFirst profanity alert.\u201dForget it.\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a Blood Fox, I think I saw its footprints somewhere,\u201d the woman beside Ye Chenshan spoke up. She didn\u2019t seem sure about her decision because she didn\u2019t want to accidentally provide false clues.\u201cReally? Where did you see them?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a slope around the woods up ahead.\u201d She pointed in a certain direction. \u201cBut the footprints were left a long time ago. The scent was long gone.\u201d\u201cNow that I think about it, she\u2019s right.\u201d Ye Chenshan nodded along.Su Ping looked that way and kept the information in his mind. \u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s us who should be thankful.\u201d The woman smiled. \u201cNice to meet you. I\u2019m Luo Guxue from Team Polaris. May I know your name?\u201d\u201cSu Ping.\u201d\u201cSu Ping?\u201d Both Luo Guxue and Ye Chenshan failed to find this name in their memories.Even so, they had more than enough reason to keep the name in mind. Someone so brilliant would soon get recognized by all the other teams out there.Fan Ganglie had retrieved his pet in time to hear their conversation. His Azure Quetzalcoatl would either die or survive with a serious disability at this rate. Learning about the Fire-tailed Blood Fox did nothing to cheer him up.He looked at Ye Chenshan, who returned a knowing look and placed a hand on his shoulder.\u201cMister Fan, I never go back on my promises. Rest assured.\u201d\u201cFor real? You\u2019d give me another Azure Quetzalcoatl? But that\u2019s an eighth-rank Astral Pet.\u201dYe Chenshan smiled and turned to Lin Mokong. \u201cYour wounded Flame Bird and the Six-Armed Gorilla too. I\u2019ll take care of their medical expenses.\u201dLin Mokong was briefly shocked, before he quickly thanked Ye Chenshan. He could afford the treatment of his pets, but saving the money was even better.Lastly, Ye Chenshan addressed Su Ping politely, \u201cThank you for your help, Mister Su.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dThe black fog around the Magical Corpse Beast was dissipating, causing everyone to look that way.Like water drawn by a sponge, the fog retreated inside the beast\u2019s body; it remained motionless, without showing any energy signatures.Crack!Little Skeleton emerged from an open wound and looked around the area using a pair of hollow eye sockets with crimson flames burning inside. Its dark bones were further blackened by the dark energy swirling around it.The others felt a sudden chill down their spines when Little Skeleton looked their way, as if they were being inspected by something a lot deadlier.Su Ping ordered Little Skeleton to use the Puppet skill, which Little Skeleton learned the other day.Unlike the Undead Enslaving, this skill required some time to work. The dead Magical Corpse Beast was the perfect material to make a puppet.Upon receiving Su Ping\u2019s command, Little Skeleton pumped more dark energy out of its body, which sank into the corpse below.The energy slowly repaired the Magical Corpse Beast\u2019s broken bones. A few minutes later, the Magical Corpse Beast twitched; the members of the group almost yelled in fear.\u201cCalm down. It\u2019s a puppet now,\u201d Su Ping comforted them.\u201cA puppet??\u201dThey all knew about this commonly-seen skill, usually available to high-level Undead creatures. But they never believed Su Ping\u2019s skeleton was potent enough to turn the mighty beast into a puppet.Following Little Skeleton\u2019s instructions, the Magical Corpse Beast slowly stood back up.A puppet created this way was always one rank lower than when it was alive. Moreover, the puppet user could only control something three ranks higher than itself or below. Right then, this \u201cMagical Corpse Beast Puppet \u201d was only an upper seventh-rank creature.As for how Little Skeleton pulled this off as a third-rank Astral Pet... Its superior aptitude had made it possible.The restriction of \u201cthree ranks higher at most\u201d was a conclusion drawn by federal educators. The best potential of this skill was in fact, unknown.\u201cNow we have something to ride on.\u201d Su Ping walked to the Magical Corpse Beast first.Seeing him, the others followed behind, albeit more carefully.\u201cYou need to find a Fire-tailed Blood Fox, right? We\u2019ll go with you,\u201d said Ye Chenshan.Su Ping agreed without a second thought. He knew that Ye Chenshan was probably tagging along so that they didn\u2019t have to return on foot while their pets were wounded.By using the Magical Corpse Beast\u2019s speed and Luo Guxue\u2019s guidance, they soon reached the aforementioned footprints and began their search for more traces left by the fox.Su Ping took out the Fire Dragon Fruits and squashed them up. This way, he could use the smell of the fruits to attract fire-type Astral Pets. This space fracture was mainly occupied by beasts of the Undead-type, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about attracting unwanted creatures.The others were amazed by how Su Ping made such a costly preparation just to find the fox.A few hours later, they reached the edge of a high cliff, where they found more tracks. Fresh ones.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Maybe something\u2019s chasing it. With nowhere to go, it jumped off,\u201d said Ye Chenshan.Fan Yujing and Li Ying didn\u2019t look pleased. The journey had cost them dearly. And Fan Ganglie\u2019s most precious Astral Pet had almost been killed. If the Fire-tailed Blood Fox had already died at the bottom of the cliff, all the time and effort would be for nothing.Su Ping slowly scanned the area and also noticed the messy remains that suggested a fight. There were bright-red fur remains and broken bone chips everywhere.He jumped off from the Magical Corpse Beast and looked below the cliff, while not forgetting about keeping an eye on who was behind him. The others in the group probably would not push him off, but he preferred to err on the side of caution.There was nothing to look at. It was nighttime.\u201cDid anyone bring any flare sticks?\u201dEveryone had stepped down from the Magical Corpse Beast to check what was beyond the cliff. It was Li Ying who took out several flares from his backpack and handed them to Su Ping.Su Ping popped one and tossed it away. Using the falling light source, he could see the brownish cliff wall, some small plants growing on the wall, as well as strands of red fur randomly tucked between pointy rocks.He also caught a glimpse of a strange object somewhere, but failed to recognize it since the flare was dropping too fast.He threw another in the same direction. This time, he successfully found the object to be some kind of irregularly-shaped stone with dark-golden sparkles on its surface. It was lodged inside the wall.\u201cIs that gold ore or what?\u201dThis place was supposed to be uncharted. Finding valuable minerals was no surprise. In fact, this was why settlers loved their job\u2014by finding a gold or uranium mine, they\u2019d become richer than most of their peers overnight.Naturally, Su Ping would love to bring such a nice trophy back. But there was no way he could climb down there and excavate the ore all by himself. He needed help.Besides, his storage space was too small to contain too many unrefined minerals. His best option was to ask an Astral Pet to transport them back in bulk.Fan Ganglie tossed a stone over the cliff and listened, but no one heard the final drop.\u201cLi Ying, send your earthworm down there. If the fox is dead, I want to see its body.\u201dLi Ying nodded and ordered his pet worm to start digging.Su Ping was still unhappy about the situation. If their target was dead, it meant he had failed his mission.A moment later, Li Ying opened his eyes and exclaimed happily. \u201cI found it. It\u2019s alive!\u201d\u201cReally? It can\u2019t fly. How did it survive the fall?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a cave down there, I saw the fox inside.\u201d\u201cA cave, huh?\u201d Su Ping wondered how long the poor creature had been waiting there.\u201cQuickly, get us there.\u201d Fan Ganglie looked thrilled after that.\u201cOf course. I\u2019ll tell my earthworm to dig a tunnel.\u201dSoon, the worm creature released some acidic body fluid to uncover its path until it was big enough for humans to pass through. By following the downward slope, they were able to reach the said cave.Or, it was not really a cave. At least Su Ping would only see it as a small burrow in the wall.The Fire-tailed Blood Fox was resting in its depths. Upon sensing intruders, it immediately went into a battle stance. Though it quickly calmed down when it recognized Fan Ganglie and Fan Yujing.\u201cThank goodness, there you are,\u201d Fan Ganglie smiled slightly. At least he completed his task.The fox affectionately nudged Fan Ganglie. Fan Ganglie was not its master, but they were close friends nonetheless.Su Ping checked and found no fatal injuries on the fox apart from some scratches. Good news for him.\u201cIt used those vines creeping on the wall to slow down while falling, I think.\u201d Ye Chenshan looked above.Su Ping remembered the pointy stone which could also be used as a stepping stone. Then he spoke to Li Ying, \u201cI saw exposed minerals up there. Tell your earthworm to make another path so we can check it out.\u201d\u201cMineral?\u201dEverybody was glad to hear such a thing. They could earn big money if they got their hands on gold or even something better.\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Fan Ganglie urged.Li Ying complied and gave the order to his pet, which dug another tunnel in the cliff. The tunnel ended up where a sturdy object was buried in the wall. It was something several meters in both length and width, like a really massive boulder.Fan Ganglie found a small device and began scanning the object.\u201cUranium... 0.002%. Gold, 2.902%. Silver...\u201dSuch disappointing readings.The device was meant to detect the element composition of the object. However, none of the displays was above 5%, which meant this thing was nothing too useful.As they wondered what such a large object was doing there, Little Skeleton suddenly put both hands on it and eagerly stroked its surface as if it really wanted it.Su Ping quickly realized that the unknown object might be something useful to Undead-type pets.\u201cSystem, do you know what this is?\u201d he asked in his mind.\u201cAffirmative.\u201d\u201cNice. Tell me.\u201d\u201cAppraisal cost, one hundred energy points.\u201dCrap.Su Ping checked his balance, which was a little less than 700, and decided to pay the price.\u201cThis is \u2018Nether Ore\u2019, a compressed form of Undead energy. When refined, it will produce a Nether Stone. You may use it as an enhancement tool, or as a currency to trade with residents in the Realm of the Undead.\u201d\u201cNether Stone, huh? Just like spirit stones?\u201d\u201cYou may put it that way.\u201d\u201cSystem, can you refine it?\u201d\u201cAffirmative.\u201d\u201cAwesome. Can you\u2014?\u201d\u201cOne hundred energy points.\u201d\u201c...\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Maybe it\u2019s valuable, maybe not. I\u2019d say it\u2019s just a cluster of random metals.\u201dSuch things were everywhere in space ruptures. Settlers who discovered them could bring them back to the Federation for inspection and earn a fortune if they proved to be of great use. Otherwise, it would only be a waste of their time.\u201cWe should get a sample and bring it back then,\u201d Luo Guxue suggested.This was a logical decision and no one had a problem agreeing to it. They could learn the nature of the unknown mineral this way and come back to get more later.Su Ping didn\u2019t want his energy points to go down the drain because he had already spent 100 points to identify the mineral. The Federation was going to take everything at this rate; he might earn some compensation for the discovery but that wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\u201cCan I have it?\u201d His words attracted everyone\u2019s attention.He basically told the others that the unknown mineral was in fact, useful in some way. But he didn\u2019t have a choice. Since the specialized device failed to tell what this was, he believed that not even the Federation would have an idea about what the material was, which meant people might let him keep it.\u201cDo you know this thing?\u201d asked Fan Ganglie, curious.Su Ping shook his head. \u201cNo. But my Astral Pet detected Undead energy from it, which means I can use it to feed my pet. If it\u2019s okay, can we remain here for a few days so Little Skeleton can fully absorb the energy?\u201dThat was partially a lie. As long as he played dumb, the Federation would not blame him even if they later recognized the true value of the material.His excuse went through because Little Skeleton was undeniably the only Astral Pet present who could use Undead energy. Still, people weren\u2019t precisely eager to stay in this place any longer than necessary just to keep Su Ping company. They had gone pretty far into this space rupture and already encountered that eighth-rank Magical Corpse Beast. Nobody knew what else could make an appearance.Without minding their attitude, Su Ping simply told Little Skeleton to start \u201ceating.\u201d He didn\u2019t actually plan to remain behind until the energy was fully taken. It was just that, he didn\u2019t want anyone to get suspicious.His act worked out just fine. Seeing Little Skeleton drawing energy from the strange stone, the last bit of doubt vanished from the group.All things said, they still didn\u2019t understand why Su Ping would tarry in this dangerous area for days. They saw Su Ping pretty keen on keeping this stone for himself and couldn\u2019t help wondering what else was hidden inside it. Usually, they\u2019d trust the Federation\u2019s device. If the device failed to tell anything, it was unlikely for a common shopkeeper to know more. However, Su Ping had shown them too many secrets for them to have this lingering belief.Still, they had nothing concrete to stop Little Skeleton from feeding. They couldn\u2019t make any use of the Undead energy anyway. While materials helpful with pet growth could earn them some merit should they bring them back, they had no reason to take this one from Su Ping after what he did.\u201cSo this is just an element stone full of Undead-type energy, right?\u201d asked Luo Guxue.Fan Ganglie put a hand on it and nodded. \u201cI think so. Though element stones are usually smooth and good to look at. This crude one is just a raw element ore.\u201d\u201cI have no objections about Mister Su keeping it,\u201d Fan Yujing claimed.Fan Ganglie nodded again. \u201cSame here. Mister Su helped us reach our destination after all.\u201dYe Chenshan also spoke up with a smile, \u201cThen it\u2019s decided. I\u2019ll let Mister Su make the decision. Just a piece of advice though, taking several days here can be risky. Since you have that puppet to help, shall we carry the stone back first?\u201d\u201cYeah... We\u2019d better get out of here,\u201d Fan Ganglie agreed.Su Ping saw all the others thinking along those lines and nodded as well. \u201cAll right.\u201dFan Ganglie sighed in relief and told his earthworm to enlarge the tunnel so they could carry the Nether Ore back to the surface. Then they found some ropes to bind it onto the Magical Corpse Beast.After making sure the fox came following, the group retreated. Just like before, Li Ying moved farther ahead as a scout. Meanwhile, Ye Chenshan summoned another pet good at detecting danger as an extra layer of safety.On their way, they would evade everything that looked strong and kill all other easier prey. The most dangerous enemy they ran into was a lower, eighth-rank bug monster, which was easily maimed by Little Skeleton, the Magical Corpse Beast and the Flame Bird working together.The ranks of their foes began dropping as they approached the outer edge of the space fracture zone. But they still remained highly cautious because high-rank Astral Pets could well hide among weaker ones to ambush them.They finally felt their tension ease when looking at the exit just up ahead.There were other settler teams gathering there, who were spooked for good when they saw the Magical Corpse Beast running in their direction.The ruckus lasted until the beast disappeared into the fracture.\u201cI\u2019m not seeing things, right, guys?\u201d a settler wondered out aloud, \u201cThat\u2019s a Magical Corpse Beast of the eighth rank.\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s riding it! Who are those people?\u201d\u201cI think I saw Ye Chenshan up there.\u201d\u201cYe Chenshan from Team Polaris? Maybe that\u2019s their leader\u2019s pet?\u201d...The appearance of the Magical Corpse Beast aroused more panic at the temporary campsite.Seeing so many people giving them odd looks, the others in the group all grew embarrassed. Though this was to be expected since the Magical Corpse Beast was way larger than common mounts used by average settlers. Besides, it sure looked dangerous.Several guards hurried to the scene, then returned to their posts when they saw who were riding the beast.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Without waiting, Su Ping told the beast to move on, causing many settlers in their way to quickly back off in either fear or respect.Most people recognized Fan Ganglie and Ye Chenshan. Soon, they started exchanging gossip.On heavy but fast steps, the Magical Corpse Beast soon moved out of the camp area.The group was once again on guard because it was still possible to run into powerful Astral Pets in this Class B barren area. They picked the shortest route so they could reach the base as soon as possible. Since most settlers used this path, wild Astral Pets all knew to stay away, apart from a few ferocious ones that were always looking for trouble.After eliminating a few more fourth or fifth-rank ferals, they finally saw the lights of the settlers\u2019 base welcoming their successful return.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Though they still had to thoroughly check the returning group\u2019s settler badges so they didn\u2019t accidentally invite spies who were being controlled by hostile Astral Pets. Such tragedies occurred several times when either Beast Kings or low-rank parasites planned to infiltrate the base. As the second line of defense protecting the base city, they had to ensure security.Once checked that everything was in order, the guards silently kept Su Ping\u2019s name in their minds. There weren\u2019t many settler teams who possessed such powerful Astral Pets as mounts.\u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, but you have to put your partner back inside your pet space,\u201d a guard politely spoke to Ye Chenshan, when he thought the giant creature belonged to Team Polaris. \u201cLarge-sized pets aren\u2019t allowed to walk freely in the facility.\u201dYe Chenshan cleared his throat. \u201cAhem, Mister Su, the man\u2019s right, I\u2019m afraid. You should leave your puppet outside for the moment.\u201dSeveral guards looked at Su Ping in great surprise. They thought this particular young man was a kid from some rich family who was tagging along to gain experience.But... Not even a \u201crich kid\u201d would be able to summon an eighth-rank pet without having the strength to control it.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Su Ping shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m turning in this thing to get some merit.\u201dThe Magical Corpse Beast was Little Skeleton\u2019s puppet and could not go inside his personal pet space. Since he couldn\u2019t keep it with him in the base city, it would be better to get rid of it.Besides, he didn\u2019t need such a burdensome creature to help him fight when he had Little Skeleton. And it wasn\u2019t like he planned to fight Astral Pets in the barrens often. Supposing he had to return some time in the future, he might just find a dead pet and make another puppet out of it.The others, however, couldn\u2019t quite accept his decision. Everybody would absolutely like such an awesome mount to show off. Why would they hand it over to the Federation?Fan Ganglie even tried persuading Su Ping, who did not listen at all.After ordering the puppet to place the Nether Ore on the ground, Su Ping told Little Skeleton to cancel the puppet effect. As soon as the Undead energy was taken away, the Magical Corpse Beast turned into a pile of bones.The others couldn\u2019t help but feel their hearts aching upon seeing Su Ping giving up such a precious tool. Yet they couldn\u2019t do anything about it.A transportation team in the base came and took all the bones and the Nether Ore further inside.\u201cGoddammit. Such a waste...\u201d Fan Ganglie mumbled.The others more or less knew that Su Ping was not with them. As a shopkeeper usually stayed in the base city, he didn\u2019t have much use for the Magical Corpse Beast anyway.While waiting for the inspection results to come out, Ye Chenshan excused himself first. \u201cGuys, since everything\u2019s done, I\u2019ll report back to my team.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Fan Ganglie and Li Ying nodded back. \u201cGood luck, man.\u201dSu Ping also showed his courtesy. \u201cSee you next time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find time to talk about your compensation in a few days.\u201d Ye Chenshan walked away.No one objected. They knew someone like Ye Chenshan wouldn\u2019t keep them hanging.Before leaving, both Ye Chenshan and Luo Guxue asked to exchange contact information.\u201cThis is where I work in the base city,\u201d said Luo Guxue, as she handed Su Ping her business card. \u201cIf you\u2019re interested, I hope you can come to our academy. With that kind of skill and potential, you\u2019ll be benefiting a lot of upcoming battle pet warriors and enriching our future.\u201dSu Ping read the card and found the name on it to be familiar. It seemed this \u201cacademy\u201d was where his sister was attending. Luo Guxue was a senior professor.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201dLu Guxue thanked everyone politely and went away after Ye Chenshan.A moment later, the report of the prize they delivered came back. They had earned 1.6 million merit points in total.That was a big number, according to what Su Ping learned from Fan Ganglie the other day. As he remembered, the merit points for killing a first-rank was 10, second was 50, third was 100. Then the price would climb in folds from here. A thousand, ten thousand... until it reached 500,000 for a seventh-rank kill.As for eighth-rank pets, even the weakest one was worth at least a million. The Magical Corpse Beast was an intermediate eighth-rank, so 1.6 million was a very reasonable result.However, Fan Ganglie didn\u2019t look happy upon seeing the result. \u201cDamn. They settled the payout based on an ordinary Magical Corpse Beast.\u201dThe Magical Corpse Beast they took back was absolutely not \u201cordinary\u201d when it could use Black Annihilation, a ninth-rank skill. As Fan Ganglie believed, they should be rewarded double. But they couldn\u2019t argue anymore because the corpse couldn\u2019t prove anything. No one suggested a second inspection. It just wouldn\u2019t work out.Su Ping didn\u2019t have any problem with the result at all. The merit points could get him enough rewards already.Also, he was registered as the killer of the beast in the end, as agreed by everyone else. The single record had boosted Su Ping from a recruit all the way to the Silver tier.The next tier would be Gold, which required him to earn a total of five million merit points.Above Gold were honored settlers who could hunt down ninth-rank enemies, which meant over 10 million merit points for each kill. Just like titled battle pet warriors, honored settlers were the most respected individuals on this planet.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It took me eight years to become a Silver settler. And yet, Mister Su succeeded in a single trip.\u201dFan Ganglie felt a bit jealous, but that was about it. He knew well that Su Ping\u2019s glory was still in the beginning stages. This young man would probably become one of the most famous settlers within half a year if he were to take his time hunting Astral Pets in the barrens day and night.\u201cYou\u2019re making me sad, captain. We two are still Iron.\u201d Li Ying pretended a sour look.Fan Yujing checked Su Ping\u2019s young look and felt conflicting thoughts bloating in his mind. People around him always referred to him as a genius who progressed pretty fast. Once Su Ping made his appearance, he felt like a loser.Su Ping, on the other hand, didn\u2019t really care which tier he was at. He was only a temporary settler who didn\u2019t have a minimum salary he could collect. He wasn\u2019t going to actually work as a settler.Compared to his promotion, he was more concerned about what kind of items he could exchange with the merit points.Fan Ganglie acted as the leader who would distribute the points among the team, although the others only took 100,000 points for the sake of it, while leaving all the remaining points to Su Ping.Su Ping basically killed the Magical Corpse Beast all by himself. It was just right to make such a decision.As the team leader, of course Fan Ganglie could keep more points for personal reasons. But at this point, he no longer dared offend Su Ping or whoever was supporting Su Ping from behind the scene.Su Ping simply accepted the income without a word and headed to the storage area. Firstly, he bought all four basic augmentation skills including the tutorials to boost them all the way to the ninth rank. So far, these cost him 150,000 points.Then he spent 880,000 points on a defensive tool called the \u201cAquatic Blessing.\u201d It was a sphere that could create an energy barrier around his body out of water elements. According to its description, the barrier worked well against eighth-rank\u2019s physical and energy-based attacks or below. Though it had no effect against spiritual skills.\u201cLet me see what else I can get here. Oh, a fruit that prolongs lifespan by... only three years? It costs a million points and can only work once. Not good.\u201d\u201cA \u2018beauty fruit\u2019 that gives you good looks. Forget it. I love my handsome face as it is.\u201d\u201cThe egg of a Beast King! By the Gods. Thirteen million points??\u201dHe ended his \u201cshopping\u201d there. He did have enough points left to buy some more battle pet warrior skill books, but he probably didn\u2019t have time to study them when he had not acquired the four basic augmentations yet.Despite the label \u201cbasic\u201d, these four skills were must-haves for all battle pet warriors. By straightforwardly enhancing the performance of battle pets, these skills usually worked better than most other skills that looked flashy.Fan Yujing suddenly approached him. \u201cMister Su, remember that you have to pay a clearance fee of 100,000 if you want to take the ore with you.\u201d\u201cClearance fee?\u201d\u201cYou know, we settlers are employees of the federation, in name. The resources we gather are usually sent to the feds, unless you want to keep something for yourself by paying a price. They made this rule so settlers don\u2019t hide valuables they find on their missions. Note that they don\u2019t care what kind of item you\u2019re taking. You pay the same price for anything.\u201dSu Ping nodded. \u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cGood. And make sure you have the ore examined at the checkpoint, so you don\u2019t bring some kind of foreign virus into the city.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dFan Yujing smiled in satisfaction. \u201cI will surely call you again if we need more help in the future. Hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\u201cOf course I\u2019d mind that.\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d...They were heading back to the one-story house when the Fire-tailed Blood Fox behind them quickly dashed ahead and began hopping happily in front of a woman with a walking cane.She gave the fox a gentle head-stroke and managed not to tear up. Then she waved her hand at the coming group. \u201cHello captain. And a hearty welcome to the other senior gentlemen!\u201dLi Ying didn\u2019t look happy. \u201cI\u2019m not your senior! I\u2019m 28!\u201dFan Ganglie chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to the new helper found by Fan Xiaoyu; he made finding your pet possible. Seriously, we could have all kicked the bucket back there.\u201dThe woman looked at Su Ping and couldn\u2019t believe how the entire team had to rely on someone so young.Fan Yujing explained everything that happened, while the woman widened her eyes further as she listened, until Su Ping grew too embarrassed when the woman was staring at him as if watching a chimpanzee in a zoo.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d Su Ping quickly shooed off the woman\u2019s admiring look. \u201cI was just helping.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be like that, Mister Su!\u201d Fan Ganglie exclaimed with a big smile, \u201cWe all owe you a big one. Come, let\u2019s have a drink. No one\u2019s leaving tonight until everyone\u2019s knocked out!\u201dOf course Su Ping didn\u2019t want to stay. He would be in big trouble if he went home while smelling of booze.Lin Mokong, who had been quiet until then, glanced at Su Ping and spoke, \u201cCaptain, I have other things to do so I\u2019ll leave for now. Let\u2019s get together another time.\u201dFan Ganglie just remembered that Lin Mokong had grudges against Su Ping. As the team leader, he didn\u2019t want to see anyone get hurt.\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll treat you next time. Good job, man.\u201d\u201cGood job indeed.\u201d Lin Mokong turned away.Fan Ganglie saw him leave and gave Su Ping an apologetic look. \u201cMister Su, Mokong is straight-tempered so... please forgive him. I think he\u2019s good now since he didn\u2019t say anything when we settled the result. It\u2019ll be for the best if you both take a step back.\u201dSu Ping nodded, for he couldn\u2019t care less about a man he wouldn\u2019t meet in the future. \u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t cause trouble, I\u2019ll leave him alone.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Fan Ganglie sighed.\u201cI\u2019ll leave as well.

Once this was done, they could head to the designated pick-up station inside the base city to retrieve the ore.Without wasting any time, they took their car to travel back to the city in the middle of the night.When they reached the major intercity highway, the horizon was already brightening up. On the front passenger seat, Su Ping yawned in boredom and began checking what he earned for finishing the rescue mission.\u201cSolar Bulwark...?\u201dIt seemed to be a skill designed to enhance his body. He didn\u2019t have to read the book because its content was already imprinted in his brain.\u201cLet me see... Solar Bulwark is a bodily cultivation art created by an ancient clan of mythical creatures called the Jinwu, or \u2018the golden sun crow\u2019. Those who master this art will receive devastating strength that can punch through mountains and lands. Once perfected, it will even allow its user to shatter the stars and resurrect from fatal injuries.\u201cTo harvest its power, you must draw in the energy of nature and develop a core of celestial consciousness inside, which in turn helps fortify your inner structure as well as your mentality. When you fully synchronize with this consciousness, you will be able to temporarily transform into a fledgling golden crow who can fly faster than sound and unleash an impinging blaze...\u201dReading the description of the new skill had helped Su Ping get rid of the drowsiness completely. He knew he could expect something good from the system. But not this good!If the book wasn\u2019t overstating things, this art must have come from mythical creatures who could use all kinds of unimaginable moves.\u201cI can even become a mythical crow? Awesome...\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but feel extremely thrilled at the moment. As he remembered, \u201cmythical\u201d was a term for very ancient beings that existed way before Beast Kings came to be.Also according to the book, this skill only had seven ranks, while proceeding to each following rank was extremely hard. At the same time, reaching a new rank would exceedingly improve its performance.The first rank allowed its wielder to withstand common blades and bullets using an unprotected body and move at sonic speed. This alone meant powerful defenses, already as strong as that of fifth-rank Astral Pets.Getting to the next rank meant moving even faster and defending against deadlier assaults such as armor-piercing weapons and cannons, which were commonly used against eighth or ninth-rank Astral Pets.At the third rank, the user would be able to activate the \u201cgolden crow mode\u201d and use several basic moves available to this particular mythical beast. In extreme situations, he might even survive in space briefly.\u201cWicked! This thing can make people as sturdy as Astral Pets. Guess this is how battle pet warriors from old times trained. Well, as the masters of powerful pets, they should be strong themselves.\u201dTheir car had entered the city area. Soon, they reached the street where Su Ping had been picked up the other day.\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d Fan Yujing parked the car and was going to see Su Ping off.Su Ping was already leaving. \u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you.\u201d\u201cThank you for your help. Really.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it.\u201dFan Yujing saw Su Ping going away without looking back and shook his head with a bitter smile....\u201cHey mom?\u201dSu Ping\u2019s plan of sneaking back into his bedroom went bust when he saw his mother, Li Qingru, waiting right inside the living room. What was worse, Li Qingru was giving him a cold gaze that made him feel as if he were being stared down by an actual Beast King.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\u201cStaying up late, mom?\u201d Su Ping felt bad all of a sudden.\u201cJust come here.\u201dDefeated, Su Ping went ahead while getting ready for a good beat-up.Li Qingru checked him and made sure there weren\u2019t any smells of alcohol or weed.\u201cWhere did you go?\u201d\u201cI was helping someone with their computer\u2014wait, no. I was out looking after someone\u2019s pet.\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s pet? It took you an entire night?\u201dSu Ping had no choice but to follow up with his lie. Thankfully, his mother believed him somewhat, since he was looking after their shop after all.\u201cDid you tire yourself out? Oh dear. Are you hungry?\u201d\u201cYeah, uh, sorta.\u201d\u201cGo wash your face. You look awful. I\u2019ll prepare breakfast. And remember to wake your sister up. If you\u2019re feeling unwell, you can take the day off.\u201dOnce again, Su Ping felt glad that he had a home and someone who cared for him in this cruel world.\u201cThanks, mom.\u201dHe went to the bathroom to get washed as told, although he might need some more time to take care of his watering eyes.Once this was done, he went to Su Lingyue\u2019s room upstairs. He didn\u2019t need to knock on the door because Su Lingyue came out first as if she knew this would happen.Su Lingyue gave him an unfriendly glare, pushed him aside, and walked away.\u201cDon\u2019t stay outside at night again.\u201dSu Ping raised an eyebrow, not sure what she meant by that.The duration of the breakfast was awfully quiet. As soon as Su Lingyue finished her meal, she headed off to her academy without insulting Su Ping, which was pretty rare.Su Ping still went to his shop as usual despite his mother\u2019s suggestion. His trained body could take a sleepless night or two without trouble.The business was poor as always. The few customers who did decide to come in were scared away by the price tags, without giving Su Ping any chance to introduce his merchandise.He felt bored. Very, very bored.Thankfully, he had something to do in the meantime, such as studying the four basic augmentation skills he just obtained from the settler base. Those skills worked by creating astral runes that were affixed onto his pets, using his astral power. To make the enhancement last longer, he had to \u201cpaint\u201d the runes as accurately and completely as possible.Learning how to paint astral runes was usually difficult at first. But being someone who had read a Chaos Star Chart before could get familiarized with such runes rather fast. Within a day, he successfully grasped all four augmentations of the first rank, which would usually take common students one to three months, or even half a year for someone bad at studying.Using his spare time, he would also occasionally use the computer to look for tools and medications that could help him train Solar Bulwark, so he could get them from the settler base later.The first rank and the very foundation of Solar Bulwark required an insanely large amount of natural energy to enhance his body. Using the energy, he could forge his body just like he would a weapon, until his flesh became hardy enough to both deflect blades and unleash devastating punches and kicks.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: TrainingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 73: TrainingAs stories told, this planet was rich in natural energy in ancient times. Even the vegetation was so energized that Golden Crows who fed on them had refined bodies upon birth, and would easily reach the third or fourth rank with minimal training.At the moment, however, Su Ping had quite a big problem with the beginning of his study.This world was currently so full of humans who sought to cultivate their bodies that all available herbs and medicines helpful for body forging were almost exhausted. Since the natural energy in the environment also underwent a decrease as time went by, people had to find materials from newly-discovered space fractures.Luckily for Su Ping, there were some valuable elixirs and similar things he could use in the settlers\u2019 base. By spending all of his remaining merit points, he purchased several mid to low rank ones.Wonder how these will work out...Since he still had to wait for his items to be delivered, he planned to spend a few days in the shop to train his augmentation skills first. Still, the workers in the base were faster than he expected. On the second day after he placed his order, a team consisting of eight uniformed guards and a settler reached his shop in a large black van that looked more fortified than armored vehicles used by banks.It seemed this settler had decided to retire and become a deliveryman instead of risking his life day and night in expeditions.\u201cGreetings, sir. This is what you requested yesterday. \u2018Millennium Wyrm Weed\u2019, \u2018Godfire Cypress\u2019...\u201dThe old settler carried several secured coffers made out of special alloys into his shop. Su Ping simply needed to enter the password he learned when shopping to open them. Anyone else who attempted to break the coffers open would only destroy the contents instead.Su Ping picked a random one and checked the rich energy leaking through the opened lid, before he sent the workers away.Meanwhile, the owners of shops nearby and some pedestrians all curiously looked Su Ping\u2019s way.\u201cLook at that. Those guys are from the federal government, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cHere to close the bastard down, I wonder? Serves him right. Not even the feds can stand this scammer.\u201d\u201cYeah. I went there once. Man those are some crazy prices, I tell you. Thank god I got away before he forced me to buy stuff.\u201d\u201cSeriously? That\u2019s so lame.\u201dSu Ping accidentally heard those words and couldn\u2019t help shaking his head in embarrassment. For the moment, he did need to close the shop since he needed time to look at the medicines.\u201cSee that? He went out of business.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what happens to a loser like him!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just get out of here.\u201d...Meanwhile, Su Ping went inside the pet room, closed the door, and began looking through all four coffers. As soon as he unlocked all of them, Little Skeleton, who had been resting in a nursing pen, woke up upon sensing the overwhelming energy that filled the room.The first merchandise was a handful of Millennium Wyrm Weed recovered from a new space fracture. This particular plant, tagged \u201c120,000 merit points\u201d, was said to contain the condensed life aura left behind by powerful dragons.Su Ping took a moment and noticed that the energy was not astral power, but spiritual power. This was just what he needed to train on Solar Bulwark. The nursing pens in the pet room were supposed to be built out of spirit stones which could slowly enhance the bodies of pets. Su Ping was going to overhaul himself by directly consuming items full of spiritual power.Following the instructions he remembered, he slowly compressed his astral power and used it to wrap up the weed, before grounding the material into fine powder so he could absorb the spiritual energy.From this point on, he could keep the spiritual energy inside him and start using it bit by bit. It sounded simple but was actually a taxing job for him. Unlike Golden Crows, he couldn\u2019t directly digest the spiritual power as if having a meal.Under his control, the spiritual power entered all the astral power vortices all over his body and enlarged them, while enhancing his body cells at the same time.Half an hour later, Su Ping opened his eyes and saw the weed had turned into a pile of spent ash. His entire body was covered in a thick film of black substance that reeked badly.\u201cUghhh. Guess this stuff is what was washed off from the inside, right?\u201dHe quickly went into the bathroom to deal with the new hygienic problem. And it felt good! He felt lighter and more vigorous than ever after that.His skin looked tender. Some of the random scars from bug bites had vanished.\u201cAh... I\u2019m looking a whole lot cooler!\u201d He felt rather satisfied when looking at his reflection in a mirror. His then better eyesight and hearing suggested that the merit points had been well spent.Not wasting any time, he opened the second coffer and immediately continued.The second item was weaker compared to the wyrm weed. Copying what he did before, he soon finished consuming it. Also like the previous time, more black filth was filtered out of his body.He just found another problem\u2014both sets of outfits he took that day required cleaning. He had nothing to wear.Helpless, he did some quick work washing his clothes and hanging them to dry, before he went on to use the third item bare-bodied.It was a piece of bright-red log this time which was hot to the touch. The energy he absorbed also felt like burning which caused him to shudder all of a sudden. At the end of his work, he felt his entire body was getting hotter.It wasn\u2019t bad though, the warmth made him feel relaxed. Moreover, there was less black stuff seeping out as the fiery energy helped cleanse it.It took him another hour to empty all four coffers. After that, only remains of the medicine were left on the floor.Despite being a shut-in who barely worked out, he began to look somewhat muscular. The brawns on his arms and his chest appeared pretty outstanding, giving him a sports boy look.\u201cHa...\u201d He breathed deeply and felt the new strength he had just gained. He felt like a superman who could easily jump onto roofs or dash across insane distances in the blink of an eye.Still, he could tell he was pretty far from achieving the first rank of Solar Bulwark. He was about 60% there, at most. Though what he did that day had already displayed the method\u2019s potential. By fortifying his body with astral power, he would be invulnerable against common swords and knives, unless it was someone good who could use really expensive blades that could still harm him.Su Ping inspected his skin and concluded, \u201cThis should be enough to withstand the attack of a fourth-rank opponent.\u201dWhile traveling and dying inside the Chaotic Realm of the Undead, he learned the different extents of monster attacks so he was pretty good at estimating his defense.Human bodies were generally weaker compared to Astral Pets of the same rank, since the latter usually had thick fur or scales as protection. Without careful preparation, even a titled battle pet warrior could get killed by a stray bullet in the head. Although such things did not happen often because someone experienced as titled battle pet warriors all knew how to keep themselves secured twenty-four seven. Even when sleeping, they\u2019d constantly cover their bodies with astral power.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: Lightning Rat CrazePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 74: Lightning Rat CrazeSu Ping swept up the floor, tossed the remains into a \u201crecyclable materials\u201d dustbin, put on his slightly wet clothes and opened the shop again. If no customers came, he would just perfect his augmentation skills.Between his study sessions, he would also check his computer for the latest news. This was more or less his daily habit ever since he came to this world.[Stricken by severe depression, this beautiful lady did unspeakable things to her pet!][The shores of Whale Lift City were bashed by terrible tidal waves as high-rank beasts showed up.][A renowned school in Longjiang became infested with rats...]Just like the article titles in his old world, everything on the \u201cInternet\u201d was also written in eye-catching and incomplete ways to attract more viewers. Although Su Ping knew better and would not fall for the seemingly interesting expression that suggested dirty business between a woman and a beast. The actual content of the news was probably something way less enticing.Or, he would gladly take a peek to prove whether he was right, and was both happy and frustrated to know that his suspicion was right on the money.\u201cDamned media. They never change, using fake stuff to get more users, not caring how they would affect their readers.\u201dAfter closing the news about the problematic idol, he began checking the more productive ones, such as the beast hazard in Whale Lift City. This was another base city built along the seashore and was constantly having safety problems because many sea monsters kept coming to shore and causing trouble to inland structures by following the river.As for the next piece of news, which was about invading rats...Su Ping thought he saw something familiar when he skimmed through the headlines. Once he read more carefully, he found out the \u201crenowned school\u201d was Phoenix Peak Academy\u2014the one his sister was studying in.The \u201crat infestation\u201d was not an actual vermin problem. The thing was, the students began raising a lot of Lightning Rats as their pets for some reason. When walking around, one would see these rats everywhere.As for the reason for this new pet choice, it seemed this was because of a certain powerful Lightning Rat which helped its master go all the way to the finals the other day. According to the article, this Lightning Rat amazingly disposed of a good number of Astral Pets who were of superior aptitudes. It even learned one of the ten strongest thunder-type moves.Su Ping watched the video in surprise.\u201cThis little guy started it??\u201dThere was more in the \u201crelated news\u201d section, such as \u201cClick here to watch what a Lightning Rat can really do!\u201d, \u201cSecrets revealed! A Lightning Rat is NOT a low-rank pet!\u201d, \u201cAll hail this king hidden among peasants. If you don\u2019t have it, get one NOW!\u201dThe cameraman of the video perfectly captured Su Yanying\u2019s image along with her small partner. The Lightning Rat still had that cocky look on its tiny face.As soon as the judge blew the whistle, the Lightning Rat disappeared into a flash of lightning and slammed into its opponent.Instant KO.Then the next match ended in a similar way.In other matches, the creature dealt with many popular mid-rank Astral Pets, and even some of the high-rank ones usually loved by nobility. No matter how powerful or graceful they looked, the Lightning Rat would always slap them away with ease.The comments of the video below attested to the Lightning Rat\u2019s rising fame.Su Ping wondered how many passionate shoppers he would get if people learned he was the one who made this possible. But he then saw the advertisements of other pet shops claiming credit for getting the Lightning Rat in shape. They even had photos that showed their cooperation with Su Yanying. Forged ones, of course.The nerve of these people!However, Su Ping was not much of a keyboard warrior. His attempt to clarify his work was soon overwhelmed by other messages.\u201cWait, I have Su Yanying\u2019s number. Should I tell her to make everything clear instead?\u201dWith this in mind, he quickly found Su Yanying\u2019s receipt where he kept the number and dialed it.\u201cHello?\u201d Her voice came. The girl sounded confused.\u201cIt\u2019s me, the caretaker of Pixie Pet,\u201d Su Ping used the cold tone he normally used when talking to customers.\u201cHey mister.\u201d Su Yanying had just recognized Su Ping\u2019s voice and seemed happy about it. \u201cIs there something you need?\u201d\u201cGot any time? Can you come over and help me make a short video?\u201d\u201c...\u201d Su Yanying didn\u2019t answer as she wondered whether she heard it right.\u201cStill there?\u201d\u201cOh, um, what kind of video?\u201d\u201cMe and you. And remember to bring your rat.\u201d\u201cMy Lightning Rat? Are you going to help me train it further?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll have to pay for that. You see, your pet became famous, and I kinda need the video to tell everyone that it came from my shop.\u201d\u201cI see...\u201d Su Yanying blushed. \u201cGood timing, I happen to need to talk to you. Thank you, really. If not for your work, I would have never made it to the finals. Well, I didn\u2019t win in the end, but that\u2019s enough for me!\u201dSu Ping hung up and realized he just learned something interesting.\u201cShe lost in the final match. If something can beat the Lightning Rat, it must be of the seventh rank or higher. The students in the academy have such powerful pets? If they take their pets to the settler base, they can form teams and lead them!\u201dThe final match of the academy was not as popular as those of a professional league. Still, Su Ping found videos captured by the audience that involved a lot of shaking and unwanted noises.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: Exhibition MatchPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 75: Exhibition MatchSu Ping picked a video with the highest view count and clicked it open. The owner of the video had a seat at the back of the crowd, though the position still offered a clear view of the arena.Su Yanying\u2019s opponent was a handsome-looking young man with a refined posture who summoned a silver-scaled Thunder Basilisk, a ninth-rank Astral Pet that usually possessed an amazing aptitude. This thing was known as one of the most ferocious pets of the thunder family and could be born with powerful abilities.The final match was between two thunder-type Astral Pets who had a giant level gap setting them apart. Most of the people watching were cheering for the Lightning Rat because they all hoped to see another miracle where the underdog triumphed over the strong.Su Ping couldn\u2019t see the number of horns the Thunder Basilisk had due to the poor video quality, but judging from its size, the creature should be a hatchling still at the six or seventh rank. An adult Thunder Basilisk was big enough to occupy the entire arena, making a proper match impossible.At the start of the match, Su Yanying applied a stealth effect to the Lightning Rat on top of the four augmentations so the rat was harder to detect.Upon receiving her order, the rat dashed at its enemy while creating four shadows as good as the real body.Many among the audience had seen such a move before, though this wouldn\u2019t prevent them from exclaiming in awe again.Su Ping disabled all the floating comments that filled up the screen so he could look at the video better.Not bad. She knows how to make good use of the rat\u2019s skills now. Su Ping silently approved Su Yanying\u2019s commands.On the other hand, the young man on the other side of the arena also applied augmentations to his pet using astral runes, although what he used appeared to be of the fifth rank. He was surely an exceptional genius, since the academy didn\u2019t help their students to reach such a level.As the Lightning Rat approached, the Thunder Basilisk coated itself in lightning bolts\u2014this was a typical defense move used by thunder-types.Meanwhile, the Lightning Rat used the same move which was obviously more powerful and deadlier.The two pets clashed in the middle of the stage and the energy surge caused the video to go all blurry. When the static settled, Su Ping saw the Lightning Rat using Thunder Slash, which only hit the Thunder Basilisk\u2019s lingering illusion, after which the basilisk bit back at the rat\u2019s body using its lightning-enhanced fangs.\u201cWeird...\u201d Su Ping frowned. \u201cThe rat could have used Thunder Roar beforehand to tell where the basilisk really is. But it didn\u2019t.\u201dThis hatchling Thunder Basilisk clearly didn\u2019t have a complete set of skills yet. But it still used the chance and left several wounds on the Lightning Rat by using simple tail whips.\u201cThunder Flash, Thunder Slash, Thunder Shadow Image, Thunder Outerwear, All-round Thunder Prison... It\u2019s only using these five skills.\u201dIn the video, the Lightning Rat was slowly losing. It had many chances to unleash more helpful moves such as Thunder Rush to get away from certain attacks, but chose not to for some reason.Something was off.As far as Su Ping knew, the Lightning Rat had grasped at least a dozen different skills. It could pick an easy combination and defeat the inexperienced Thunder Basilisk in no time. He had noticed that the Thunder Basilisk was younger than he expected. Maybe an upper sixth-rank, at best.A moment later, the basilisk slammed the rat out of the stage with another tail-swipe, announcing the end of the fight.It lost? Just like that?It was likely that Su Yanying only knew those five skills and would keep telling her rat to use them. As her loyal partner, the Lightning Rat couldn\u2019t do otherwise.Talking about a terrible teammate... Su Ping sighed. The poor little guy could perform better if she just stood there without making a sound.However, the viewers didn\u2019t have the same concern as they kept talking about how awesome the display was. As a matter of fact, four of the five skills shown by the rat were high-rank skills, while the remaining one was a secret art only available to a selected few thunder-type pets and Beast Kings.Still, Su Ping couldn\u2019t quite accept the result.Where the heck was his Undead Calling? Soul Eater? And Life Drain? What about Death Deceit? That skill alone was enough to turn the tables!He didn\u2019t really care about the trophy because he wasn\u2019t the one participating. It was just that, looking at such a match felt like putting a god\u2019s gift to waste. He gave Su Yanying a god-tier pet, while she made a huge disappointment out of it.Soon, Su Yanying came visiting.\u201cHey, mister!\u201d Su Yanying walked to the counter with a joyful look. \u201cNow I can thank you personally. You helped me reach the finals after all.\u201dSu Ping\u2019s lips twitched. He decided not to complain about the match as this would change nothing.\u201c*Sigh* Here, let\u2019s get the video done.\u201d\u201cNo offense but, do you really need the video to make your shop known? I thought you just wanted to keep a low profile in this small place even though you have what it takes to make big money.\u201dSu Ping grimaced. Low-profile my butt! I need freaking money!\u201cOh, right, are you free these days, Mister Su? Since the official matches have ended, our school is going to hold an exhibition match tomorrow. There will be huge crowds and firework shows! I want to thank you more properly, so... Would you team up with me for a match?\u201d\u201cAn exhibition match? I\u2019m not from your academy.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine! The exhibition match is all about being pretty. We\u2019ll be open to visitors on this occasion.

The students of such a famous school were the ones who were willing to put in a lot of effort on their pets, unlike those ordinary passersby who would just casually raise a house cat for fun and would not spend a lot of time to nurture them.\u201cReally?\u201dSu Yanying\u2019s eyes lit up with excitement when she heard Su Ping\u2019s decision. In her view, Su Ping was always a mysterious man. There had to be an extremely powerful teacher, probably a retired but formerly renowned pet warrior, backing him up. It would be very beneficial to get involved with such an entity.\u201cShould I pick you up tomorrow?\u201d She quickly followed up while the iron was hot.Su Ping nodded. \u201cWhen will the match start?\u201d\u201cThere are a few exhibition matches scheduled. Ye Hao and I will be the finalists in the evening,\u201d Su Yanying said immediately. There was a hint of smugness on her face. After all, she had made it to the finals. Previously, she had been looking forward to becoming the champion. However, as she fought more matches with the Lightning Rat, she realized that she would have stopped at the quarter finals at best without her pet rodent. There were way too many hidden talents in college that she had overlooked.It was for this reason that she was especially grateful to Su Ping for the honor of entering the finals. She gained more than she expected.\u201cWho is Ye Hao?\u201d asked Su Ping.\u201cHe\u2019s the champion of our academy, the one who defeated me.\u201d Su Yanying giggled. She didn\u2019t seem disappointed at all. That was a Thunder Basilisk after all, the strongest rank below Beast Kings!Su Ping\u2019s lips twitched when he saw her innocuous look.\u201cI\u2019ll pick you up tomorrow in the evening then. At what time?\u201d Su Yanying blinked happily.\u201cLet\u2019s see... In the afternoon, around four o\u2019clock.\u201d\u201cYou want to be there earlier?\u201d Su Yanying\u2019s eyes twinkled again. Of course she wanted to spend more time with Su Ping and learn more about pets.Su Ping nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll have to trouble you with something. Speaking of which, it\u2019s not against the rules to hand out flyers in your academy, is it?\u201dFlyers? Su Yanying\u2019s shoulders slumped as she looked at Su Ping in shock. He only wants to advertise the shop? Seriously?Looking at Su Ping\u2019s serious expression, Su Yanying was finally convinced that he was indeed asking her for help in this matter.But... Why would someone like him need cheap promotion like this?\u201cMister Su, with your skills and such, you know, is it alright to be handing out flyers?\u201d Su Yanying asked, looking uncertain.\u201cProbably not.\u201dSu Yanying heaved a sigh of relief. I knew it. An expert like him couldn\u2019t actually\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t do that, but you can.\u201d Su Ping looked at her. \u201cRemember to bring your partner. I\u2019ll print the flyers later, you two will be in charge of passing them out. Make sure to pick whoever looks rich. Don\u2019t even bother with the others. We\u2019ll just waste our time.\u201dHe means it!! Su Yanying just felt that she had fallen into a trap. A general publicist? Me? He asked a school belle like me, who just won the silver medal in the tournament, to do grunt work??\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Su Ping was still asking for her opinion.Su Yanying wanted to refuse. But when she remembered that she was supposed to thank Su Ping properly...\u201cFine! I\u2019ll do it.\u201dSu Ping nodded in satisfaction. \u201cIs there anything else? Need to buy something?\u201dSu Yanying subconsciously glanced at a shelf nearby, and quickly jerked her head away when she saw an item priced at 1.2 million.\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t need to buy something for my pet to be trained in the shop, right?\u201d\u201cHuh? No you don\u2019t. Note that the training you\u2019ll get from now on is ordinary. Don\u2019t expect insane boosts like before.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean with ordinary?\u201d\u201cLike, your pet will only get one skill out of each service, or have its rank improved by half a rank or so.\u201dSu Yanying found it difficult to speak all of a sudden.You call that ordinary??A common pet shop would do a pretty good job by improving someone\u2019s pet just a bit. Learning new skills would cost extra cash. A lot of cash.When Su Yanying thought about how her Lightning Rat was growing so rapidly, she suddenly realized that Su Ping was not exaggerating things. In this particular shop, being ordinary meant being good!He IS a hidden expert. No doubt about it. I can\u2019t judge him by common sense.\u201cI see! I\u2019m going to keep all my pets here,\u201d Su Yanying said immediately. She had to seize this rare opportunity as soon as possible. Luckily for her, there were no other customers present. She feared that she wouldn\u2019t be as lucky once the shop was known by more people.She suddenly regretted agreeing to help Su Ping advertise. It would be better if she was the only one who knew such a hidden treasure vault.But on second thought, it was impossible for her to keep things covered anyway. What she needed to do right then was to use the chance to her advantage as much as she could before more people overran this shop.\u201cMister, can I get a membership here?\u201dSu Ping raised his eyebrow and saw through her thoughts.\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAww...\u201d\u201cThe service fee is the same as before. First to third rank, 10,000. Fourth to sixth, 100,000. How many pets do you want to train?\u201dSu Yanying suddenly realized that she was in a tight spot. She was just a student. She had spent most of her allowance the other day and still owed her good friend Lan Lele money. How would she find that much money?\u201cI, um...\u201d Su Yanying blushed. \u201cI didn\u2019t bring enough money today. Maybe next time.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t look convinced.Su Yanying showed a silly smile and waved her hand. \u201cSee you tomorrow Mr. Su. Buh-bye!\u201dWith that, she turned around and escaped.Su Ping shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m mugging her. Why did she look so scared?\u201dHe remained at the shop for the rest of the day without receiving any customers, then he went back home at night.As soon as he entered his home, Su Ping heard Su Lingyue asking their mom for pocket money. Apparently, she wanted to buy a Lightning Rat as well.Huh... The new pet craze reached all the way to my house.Su Ping removed his shoes and stepped into the living room. The girl who was affectionately tugging her mother\u2019s arm suddenly sat up straight and regained her indifferent composure within a second.Su Ping rolled his eyes and asked whether dinner was ready.Li Qingru gladly went to the kitchen to warm up his meal.Su Ping washed his hands and sat at the dining table. He looked at Su Lingyue, who had yet to leave.\u201cI heard that your school has an exhibition match tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhere did you hear that from?\u201d\u201cI just heard it from a customer,\u201d Su Ping said casually. \u201cAre you going on stage?\u201dSu Lingyue wanted to know who this customer was, but her proud character forbade her from asking his brother more unnecessary questions.\u201cOf course I am. I\u2019m the champion of all freshmen. I will show up in the finale for tomorrow\u2019s performance.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the finale for third years?\u201dSu Lingyue was furious. \u201cWell, I\u2019m the champion of my peers! You got a problem with that?!\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What was more, there was actually meat left in his share.Su Ping glanced at Su Lingyue, who snorted and looked away.Ah, she knows how to be a good girl once in a while?Still, Su Ping wasn\u2019t going to test his sister\u2019s patience; he started eating without saying another word.When Li Qingru sat down again, Su Lingyue continued with her earlier plea. \u201cMom, it\u2019s true. Help me out. You have no idea how popular the Lightning Rat is right now. Its potential has been severely underestimated. Apart from that particular pet star in our school, I heard that there\u2019s also a third-rank Lightning Rat in Nanxiang Academy who defeated a fourth-rank Flora Trapper. Everybody is right. These rats are hidden jewels!\u201d*Cough*Su Ping choked on his food. He quickly downed a glass of water to recover.\u201cCome on, I tried to be nice today. I won\u2019t take all your stuff.\u201d Su Lingyue rolled her eyes.\u201cYeah, right.\u201dSu Ping noticed that his sister was probably talking about a real \u201cgenius rat\u201d since he didn\u2019t remember helping a second one.\u201cBut this isn\u2019t a common occurrence, dear. No matter how outstanding Lightning Rats are, they\u2019re still low-rank pets. Their bloodline potential is limited.\u201d Li Qingru was an adult and a beginner-level trainer. She was more rational about this matter. \u201cWhat we can learn from this is that, as long as one is talented and has good aptitude, even a Lightning Rat would be able to display astonishing abilities. This also applies to your Phantom Flame Beast.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to buy a Lightning Rat and spend more time and resources to nurture it. One or two strong pets are enough for you. Focus on the Mirage Flame Beast for now, and it will repay you.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t expect his mother to speak like this, although he totally agreed. \u201cYou\u2019re right, mom.\u201dSu Lingyue shot him a murderous look, then she looked at Li Qingru with a completely different expression.\u201cBut mom! Did you know that the teachers in the academy are constantly asking students about their Lightning Rats to see whether they are doing a good job? If I don\u2019t have one, how am I supposed to answer?\u201dLi Qingru was surprised by this. \u201cWhat? That\u2019s not right. There are so many Astral Pets out there. They can\u2019t snub other pets just because of a Lightning Rat becoming famous.\u201dSu Ping easily saw through the girl\u2019s excuse but didn\u2019t point it out directly. \u201cAgreed. If every teacher is that stupid, that academy will close down in no time.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you keep your mouth shut??\u201d Su Lingyue used that devilish look at Su Ping again. In fact, she would look just like a devil if something bloody were painted on her face.Isn\u2019t she always smart when playing pranks? Su Ping thought to himself, I see. She\u2019s not so good at lying. Well, at least she knows how to bide her time. The rat problem started almost a week ago, and she\u2019s only asking now.She\u2019s still a girl after all. All the general opinions and media will get to her eventually.Nevertheless, her dogged persuasion bore fruit in the end; Li Qingru agreed to Su Lingyue\u2019s request. Lightning Rats were not expensive. Five thousand was enough to buy an adult one. Breeders didn\u2019t usually sell them to make profit straightaway. Instead, pet food was the biggest part of their revenue.Li Qingru was mainly worried that an additional pet would distract Su Lingyue. But seeing how determined she was, Li Qingru had to comply.Su Lingyue almost danced in joy. Then she remembered something. \u201cOh right, Mom, are you going to watch the exhibition match tomorrow?\u201dLi Qingru had heard of this. She shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well, dear, so I won\u2019t be going.\u201dSu Ping gave his mother a worried look. He knew the reason for her condition. There was one time when she kept someone\u2019s pet in the shop as requested. However, the pet was still feral and had not been subdued by a contract. Without its master nearby, it lost control and attacked Li Qingru when she wasn\u2019t paying attention. Fortunately, she reacted quickly enough to keep her life. But the incident left an ailment that prevented her from working for extended periods of time.The owner of the problematic pet didn\u2019t pay any compensation. Instead, he accused Li Qingru of not taking care of the pet which caused it to go wild. The dispute underwent a large amount of judicial procedures and also involved a lot of running around. In the end, Li Qingru received a few hundred thousand as the final result.Such an amount was rather pointless compared to a person\u2019s long term health. However, there was nothing else she could do.Su Ping remembered seeing some rare medicines in the settler\u2019s vault that could even help people regrow lost limbs. There was bound to be something he could use for his mother. But good medicine was extremely costly. He might need millions of merit points.Damn it. Maybe I need to go on a settler mission again, Su Ping thought to himself. If he remembered this matter earlier, he could have saved up the points.Su Lingyue\u2019s eyes dimmed a little when she heard Li Qingru\u2019s words, but soon recovered her smile. \u201cI\u2019ll ask my classmates to help me take a video then, so you can watch it later.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Li Qingru smiled back.Su Lingyue left her seat to go upstairs. On her way, there was a brief and somber scowl as she glanced at her mother\u2019s injured leg.Seeing this, Su Ping felt something click in his mind. Though he didn\u2019t say anything.The next morning.Su Ping had a night of peaceful sleep and there were no spooky pranks in the morning. Su Lingyue was already having breakfast when he went downstairs.A few girls stood at the door and called Su Lingyue\u2019s name. They were the girls from last time.While on her way out, Su Lingyue tossed a small card on the table. \u201cHere, a ticket. You can take a look if you want, or throw it away. I don\u2019t care.\u201dShe left with her friends before Su Ping could say anything.Li Qingru left the kitchen and saw what just happened; she said, \u201cIf you\u2019re not busy with the shop, you can go see your sister and cheer for her. Being her brother means that you should stand for her and keep her safe.\u201dSu Ping almost rolled his eyes. Keeping her safe? It\u2019s more like stopping her from hurting other people.All things said, he was planning on going to the academy anyway. He put the ticket away and left for work on his bike.He studied a full day at the shop, and just like usual, not a single customer showed up.He prepared the printed fliers in the afternoon. When it was almost four o\u2019clock, two bright-looking girls appeared at the entrance of the store\u2014Su Yanying and her friend Lan Lele, whom he had agreed to meet the day before.\u201cHey dude, do you really want us to hand out flyers for you?\u201d Lan Lele was at a loss when she saw the thick stack of handouts in Su Ping\u2019s arms.\u201cWhy else would I ask you to come?\u201d\u201cYou\u2014\u201d Lan Lele felt angered again. She always did when she visited the store.Su Yanying quickly tried to smooth things over. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I promised. Lele, my beautiful friend, you agreed to help me. Pretty please?\u201dLan Lele spat in disdain but still took the papers.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Su Ping checked the clock and went to lock the door, while the two girls called for a taxi.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then, he told the driver to go to Phoenix Peak Academy.By looking at the three and the direction they were headed, the driver guessed that they were all students of the Phoenix Peak Academy. They were easy to chat with and he got to learn more about battle pet warriors; being an ordinary person, he was even more curious about it.Su Ping spoke less, fearing that it would affect the driver\u2019s navigation.Half an hour later, they arrived at the entrance of the academy. The streets in the area were already wide enough, and yet, they were filled with all sorts of famous cars. A few handsome young men and girls walked out of the cars. They were all students of Phoenix Peak Academy.In order to get into this well-known Astral Pet school, one had to have good grades and a rich family background. At the very least, one had to be from a well-off family, since the tuition fees were more than ten times more expensive when compared to ordinary universities. Just the cost of buying pets and nurturing them was a weight that ordinary families could not afford.The car stopped by the side. Su Ping pushed the door open and got out of the car. Lan Lele paid the fare behind him. Su Ping took a glance at the academy entrance, which was still rather imposing. He was satisfied and took the lead to enter.Su Yanying and Lan Lele hurried to follow Su Ping. Su Yanying was surprised to see that Su Ping was familiar with the way. \u201cYou\u2019ve been to our school?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Su Ping replied without looking back.Su Yanying was stunned. Why does it feel like you\u2019re in your home when you\u2019ve never been here before?It had to be known that most people who had just arrived at Phoenix Peak Academy would be shocked by the massive sculpture of a phoenix at the entrance of the academy, spreading its wings and soaring. That lifelike statue had been created by a famous craftsman to depict the king of beasts, the \u2018Purple-tailed Divine Phoenix\u2019. It had the imposing aura of a Beast King.Back when she had just entered Phoenix Peak Academy, she was just like the other freshmen. She had been stunned by the sculptured phoenix at the entrance for a long time. She got used to it after a long time passed. This was one of the famous sights of her school, and also the pride of the students.\u201cThis guy...\u201d Su Yanying mumbled and caught up with Su Ping.The exhibition match would be held that day. Many of the students who entered the academy were accompanied by elegant and graceful figures. They were their parents, and some even brought their siblings.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Su Yanying?\u201dAll of a sudden, a girl saw Su Yanying behind Su Ping and covered her mouth in shock. She was pleasantly surprised.Hearing the words \u201cSu Yanying,\u201d the surrounding students immediately turned their heads over. When they saw Su Yanying\u2019s face, exclamations were heard and the crowd quickly surrounded her.Even in the past, Su Yanying was considered a famous person in the school. After all, she was one of the most beautiful students, and she was in the top ten of the girl\u2019s battle power ranking. She had both beauty and strength. Which guy didn\u2019t want to conquer her?Or perhaps... be conquered by her?Ever since the end of the annual competition, Su Yanying had relied on the Lightning Rat to pass the test and enter the finals. Her reputation had reached its peak. Even Ye Hao, who had won the championship, was not as popular as Su Yanying.After all, coming in second wasn\u2019t the main point. The main point was that she had won using the Lightning Rat.The super Lightning Rat that could fight with a sixth-rank pet left a deep impression on everyone.\u201cIs that Su Yanying?\u201d\u201cI heard she\u2019s the first runner-up amongst the third-years.\u201d\u201cShe looks really good.\u201dIn the distance, some of the parents who were attending the exhibition were jealous and envious of Su Yanying, who was surrounded by students. How glorious would it be if this happened to their children?Lan Lele had already become a bodyguard. She stopped everyone who came to ask for autographs and questions about the reason for the Lightning Rat\u2019s strength. She turned around and called out to Su Yanying, \u201cYou guys go ahead. Don\u2019t bother about me. We\u2019ll meet up at the same old place.\u201d Her tone sounded like a warrior who was ready to die.Su Ping grabbed Su Yanying\u2019s hand and rushed into the academy as he saw the fanatical faces rushing toward him. He ran along a path of greenery. Behind him, a few boys were chasing after him, but they gave up after a short while. After all, it wouldn\u2019t be nice to force things.Su Ping stopped halfway and slapped his head. \u201cAren\u2019t we here for publicity?\u201dSu Yanying said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen why are we running?\u201d\u201cUh, yes?\u201dSu Yanying and Su Ping stared at each other. However, it was a little strange to turn around and go back.Su Ping pondered for a moment. \u201cForget it. Let\u2019s meet up with the second promoter first; I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t want the trash at the door. You should know your college better, go find those rich ones first.\u201dSu Yanying was stunned for a moment. She felt sorry for Lan Lele in her heart. After all, she was the school belle and the daughter of a rich family. Now, Su Ping was treating her as a second promoter... Wait, if she was number two, then who was number one?Su Yanying was startled. By the time she came back to her senses, Su Ping was already far away.She opened her mouth, smiled bitterly, and chased after him.Not long after, the three of them met up at a pavilion in a meadow. Phoenix Peak Academy was extremely large and it was covered in greenery\u2014from meadows to woods. Not only were there resting pavilions, but there were also some fish ponds for viewing.\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Han Xiangcheng and the rest?\u201d Lan Lele suddenly saw a few people walking on a stone path.Su Yanying\u2019s eyes lit up. She said to Su Ping, \u201cAll of them are on the battle power rankings.\u201d\u201cBattle power rankings?\u201d Su Ping was surprised. \u201cSo they\u2019re rich? Hurry, don\u2019t let them go.\u201dSu Yanying blushed a little when she heard Su Ping\u2019s urging. She had never taken the initiative to strike up a conversation with anyone. It was always others who took the first step. It was too embarrassing to pass out flyers at the academy.Su Ping could tell that she was shy. He snapped, \u201cHanding out flyers is also a job, okay? Are you looking down on this job?\u201dSu Yanying quickly replied, \u201cNo.\u201d\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you going?\u201dSu Yanying bit her lip. She had no choice but to brace herself and follow Lan Lele.\u201cSu Yanying?\u201d The leader of the group, Han Xiangcheng, was a little surprised to see Su Yanying and Lan Lele jumping out of the room. Looking at their flushed faces, his heart skipped a beat. Could it be that... they have taken a fancy to my handsome self?\u201cWell, please take a look at this.\u201d Su Yanying blushed and handed a flyer to Han Xiangcheng.Han Xiangcheng was a little puzzled. He took the flyer and looked at it. He couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. \u201cWhat... what is this?\u201d\u201cThis is my Lightning Rat\u2019s cultivation shop.\u201d Su Yanying blushed. \u201cMy Lightning Rat was trained there. You can go there if you\u2019re interested.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Han Xiang Cheng was shocked, doubting his ears.This is not how the story should unfold!Wasn\u2019t the beauty\u2019s face red? Wasn\u2019t it filled with love?My heart was stirred, but you\u2019re just showing me this?!Su Yanying quickly passed each of them a flyer and said that they could visit if they liked it. Then, she turned around and ran away.Seeing that she had settled everything before she could even speak, Lan Lele ran back with Su Yanying.\u201cDone.\u201d Su Yanying panted as she ran. Her heart was pounding.Su Ping saw that the other party had accepted the flyer from afar and was very satisfied. \u201cNot bad, not bad. Let\u2019s go find your rich classmates.\u201dSu Yanying and Lan Lele looked at each other. They knew that Su Ping\u2019s cultivation service was not bad, but why did they feel like they were scamming their classmates?The three of them wandered around the academy and soon found a new target. Su Yanying suddenly had an idea. She followed Lan Lele and returned shortly after. The thick flyers in their hands were gone.Su Ping was surprised. \u201cWhere are the flyers?\u201d\u201cThey have them. They will hand them out for us.\u201d Su Yanying giggled, her eyes filled with cunningness.Su Ping was speechless.They learned how to create downlines this fast?\u201cThen, did you tell them that they should prioritize the rich?\u201d Su Ping asked.\u201cI did,\u201d Su Yanying promised with all her might, but she didn\u2019t dare to look Su Ping in the eye. She felt a bit guilty. Su Ping was expecting that as a matter of course, but how could she confess? Of course she didn\u2019t.However, she felt that even if she didn\u2019t say it, as long as those flyers were distributed, Su Ping\u2019s store would become more famous and the news would spread like wildfire. Everyone would know about it. They would have to line up to enter.Su Ping took a glance at her and knew that she didn\u2019t say anything. However, he couldn\u2019t pursue the matter. As long as the promotion was done, dozens of people going to the store would be enough to keep him busy.\u201cBoss, let\u2019s go watch the matches first. Although it\u2019s not our turn yet, all the exhibition matches are very exciting. You have to see them.\u201d Su Yanying immediately changed the topic.Su Ping nodded. At this time, Su Lingyue\u2019s exhibition match was about to begin.\u201cAre all the exhibition matches for the first to the third years at the same venue?\u201d Su Ping asked.\u201cOf course.\u201d Su Yanying grinned. \u201cThey\u2019re all at the largest stadium.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go then,\u201d Su Ping said.With the two girls accompanying him, Su Ping walked towards the competition stadium.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: Seventh RankPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79: Seventh RankThere was a huge plaza outside the venue.Many students who had brought their relatives to the competition stadium were still strolling around.Su Ping was surprised to find that it was as the news reported. The Phoenix Peak Academy had set off a storm of Lightning Rats. Among the students he had seen along the way, seven had a purple-furred Lightning Rat with them.Those unaware would think that it was a school that specialized in cultivating Lightning Rats.Su Yanying noticed Su Ping\u2019s expression and said with a smile, \u201cBoss, this is all thanks to you.\u201dSu Ping chuckled.The three of them entered the stadium. The interior of the hall was huge, enough to accommodate a hundred thousand people.Su Yanying and Lan Lele were clearly very familiar with the place, as they navigated through the complex sections and passageways with ease. Very soon, they arrived at a place with front row seats; the view was very good. This was the area from where the upperclassmen would watch the competition.\u201cLook, it\u2019s Jiang Bingshan.\u201d Lan Lele pouted.At this moment, a man and a woman were engaged in a fierce battle in the stadium\u2019s arena. However, although the battle seemed intense, it was just gaudy; not much lethality was involved. Even so, the atmosphere of the arena was pumped; people cheered uncontrollably.Su Yanying glanced for a moment and then looked away. She was very calm.\u201cThis time, she barely made it into the top eight. I heard that the academy assigned her to a second-level team. She had to serve in a Class C barren area for a year before she could be promoted to an official settler.\u201d Lan Lele\u2019s face was full of smiles, but her tone was dripping with a sense of schadenfreude. \u201cNow, she can\u2019t be arrogant in front of you anymore. You\u2019re being fought over by those first-level battle teams. Once you reach the barren areas, you\u2019ll become an official settler.Besides, you only need to serve in the Class C barren area for three months before you\u2019re sent for training in a Class B barren area. Your growth rate will definitely surpass her. It is not impossible for you to become a titled battle pet warrior in the future.\u201dSu Yanying looked at the tall and proud figure on the stage and sighed. She knew that she was only lucky to have met Su Ping. Otherwise, with her pets, she would only be able to enter the top eight at best; they were on par with her competitor\u2019s.But fate was like this. From then on, she would rise up and grow rapidly, completely severing this competitive relationship.She would meet new opponents and see a wider world. All of this would turn into memories of the past.\u201cBarren area? Battle team?\u201d Su Ping heard the two girls\u2019 words and thought of Fan Yujing\u2019s sister, Fan Xiaoyu. She was also a student of this school, but she had already entered the barren area for training.He asked, \u201cDo you all become settlers after graduation?\u201dLan Lele shook her head and said, \u201cYingying will; It\u2019s her dream. But I won\u2019t. Even if I\u2019m willing, my father won\u2019t let me. Besides, I don\u2019t want to go to a godforsaken place like a barren area. I can\u2019t even shower every day.\u201dSu Yanying smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s nothing if it means I can become a powerful battle pet warrior.\u201dLan Lele pursed her lips. \u201cWhy should I become a powerful battle pet warrior? Even if I\u2019m an eighth-rank battle pet warrior, I\u2019m still my father\u2019s bodyguard. There\u2019s nothing in this world that money can\u2019t resolve\u2014unless you don\u2019t have enough money. Earning money is the most important thing!\u201dSu Yanying smiled bitterly. She knew that she wouldn\u2019t be able to find a common ground with her in this topic. The environment of their upbringing was different, and everyone pursued their dreams differently.\u201cIsn\u2019t this Su Yanying?\u201d Suddenly, a gentle and calm voice could be heard. The few of them turned around and saw three people walking in their direction, two of them trailing behind like lackeys. The young man walking in front was dressed in casual clothes. He had short hair and looked very spirited. His eyes were deep and warm, but he had a sharpness that could burst out at any moment. His temperament was restrained, but his outstanding persona would attract everyone\u2019s attention wherever he went.\u201cYe Hao?\u201d Su Yanying was surprised to see the young man. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cThis is where the audience stands are. Why can\u2019t I come here?\u201d Ye Hao smiled.Su Yanying knew that she had said something wrong and shook her head. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not what I meant. Shouldn\u2019t you be with your class?\u201dYe Hao smiled and said, \u201cI came here looking for you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re looking for me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Ye Hao smiled. \u201cThe last time I fought with your Lightning Rat, my Thunder Basilisk seemed to have been agitated. It has broken through and has reached the seventh rank, officially entering adulthood. Although it\u2019s still too early to become a real adult, it\u2019s still all good. I\u2019m here to thank you.\u201d\u201cIt broke through to the seventh rank?\u201d Su Yanying was stunned. Lan Lele, who was standing next to her, was shocked as well. The other party was just a student in school. He had already nurtured a seventh rank pet!Moreover, to be able to summon a seventh-rank pet, one could only imagine how powerful Ye Hao\u2019s astral power cultivation had to be!\u201cYou... you can\u2019t be an advanced battle pet warrior, right?\u201d Lan Lele couldn\u2019t help but ask. If that were the case, it would be too shocking!Ye Hao glanced at her and laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not that fast. We\u2019re still students, aren\u2019t we? I used to have level-four astral power and suffered a backlash by the Thunder Basilisk. I was lucky enough to break through to level-five. With my astral power, I can only barely summon the Thunder Basilisk. I can\u2019t let it stay out for long.\u201d\u201cFifth level?\u201d Su Yanying and Lan Lele\u2019s expressions changed when they heard his words. They were still at the fourth level. Su Yanying was in the middle of the fourth level while Lan Lele was in the lower position of the fourth level. Her strength was already considered outstanding and she was a top student in her class.However, compared to Ye Hao\u2019s fifth level, she paled in comparison.At the level of a middle-rank battle pet warrior, the difference between astral power levels was extremely obvious, not to mention that there was a huge gap between them. It was like a chasm that couldn\u2019t be bridged.\u201cApart from gratitude, I\u2019m here to say hi to you. After the Thunder Basilisk broke through to the seventh rank, it underwent some changes. It has a dragon\u2019s might. I haven\u2019t learned how to restrain it yet,\u201d Ye Hao said, \u201cYou know that this is an exhibition match. If your Lightning Rat were to tremble in fear, I\u2019m afraid things will turn a little nasty. Although your Lightning Rat is monstrous, it is still of a low-class bloodline. It is natural to fear high-class bloodlines.\u201cSo, I suggest that you use your Fallen Phoenix to fight me. In that case, at least it will look good. I will show mercy.\u201dIf it weren\u2019t for Ye Hao\u2019s gentle smile, Su Yanying would have thought that he was there to provoke her. However, seeing that Ye Hao didn\u2019t seem to have any ill intentions, she felt a little depressed and uncomfortable, but she still said, \u201cI understand. I will consider it.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to consider further,\u201d Su Ping heard what she had said and stepped in, \u201cYou can fight however you want. It\u2019s just a seventh-rank pet. Not only is it not an adult, the Lightning Rat won\u2019t be scared even if an adult Beast King shows up.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d Ye Hao, Su Yanying, and the others looked at Su Ping. Su Yanying was stunned for a moment. Her eyes lit up. \u201cReally?\u201d Su Ping was the cause of the Lightning Rat\u2019s change. She was convinced by Su Ping\u2019s words.Moreover, she remembered that there was a battle against the Dragon Hound. The Dragon Hound had used a deterrence technique mixed with dragon\u2019s might at the time, but it was ineffective against the Lightning Rat. It was clear that Su Ping\u2019s words were not baseless.\u201cAnd this is?\u201d Ye Hao frowned. He was polite to Su Yanying because she had been scouted by a first-rate team and had a bright future ahead of her. However, he had never seen Su Ping before. He wasn\u2019t on the college\u2019s battle power rankings.Besides, Su Ping sounded exaggerated. What did an adult Beast King mean? Just seeing one might already mean death.This was one of the few monsters in the world. Ignoring the Lightning Rat, even the proud Thunder Basilisk would tremble in front of a Beast King. Could it be that the Lightning Rat had a higher blood lineage than the Thunder Basilisk and had a prideful temperament?62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: Appointment FeePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 80: Appointment FeeTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsSu Yanying then remembered she had not made the proper introductions. She immediately said, \u201cYe Hao, this is Boss Su. My Lightning Rat was trained in his store. He is also half the owner of my Lightning Rat. Speaking of which, Boss Su might know more about the Lightning Rat than I do. Boss Su, Ye Hao is the champion of our school\u2019s annual tournament. He is the one who is most willing to spend money on pets.\u201dThe latter half of the sentence was obviously a hint to Su Ping.\u201cBoss Su?\u201d Ye Hao was surprised. Su Ping was about his age. The latter was a few years younger than him. How was he such a young boss?Moreover, the Lightning Rat had been groomed in his store? Didn\u2019t that mean that he had a master in his store?To be able to hire a cultivation master at such a young age, could it be someone from a large conglomerate or a large family clan?He didn\u2019t doubt Su Yanying\u2019s words; such a lie would not do Su Yanying any good. If word got out, it would lower her standing in the eyes of her mentor and the battle team. After all, everyone thought that she had trained the Lightning Rat herself.In that short moment, many thoughts surfaced in his mind, and the coldness on his face disappeared without a trace. He maintained his composure and smiled. \u201cSo, the Lightning Rat was trained in Boss Su\u2019s store. I wonder where Boss Su\u2019s store is? If there\u2019s a chance, I hope that you can help me cultivate my Thunder Basilisk. No matter how much it costs, I\u2019m willing to pay for it. Of course, money is nothing special. Boss Su, you may not be interested in it, but if there\u2019s anything else that I need to do, I\u2019ll do my best. I\u2019m absolutely sincere!\u201dWhen Su Yanying and Lan Lele heard his words, they thought to themselves, Nope. He just wants money.Su Ping would not reject a business offer. Judging from the man\u2019s appearance, he was obviously rich. He nodded. \u201cSince you\u2019re so sincere, I can consider it. If you give me a hundred thousand now, I can consider nurturing your pet with priority.\u201d\u201cOne hundred thousand?\u201d Su Yanying and Lan Lele were startled when they heard Su Ping\u2019s exorbitant demand. They couldn\u2019t help but glance at Su Ping. And this is just to get in line?They thought that Su Ping had been nefarious enough. But, he could be even worse. This was daylight robbery!Before Su Ping opened his mouth, he had asked the system inwardly and got the answer he wanted.The system was only responsible for keeping a close eye on the cost of the service in the store. It didn\u2019t care about anything else.For example, the gratitude fee and the queuing fee were all things Su Ping could arrange and decide for himself.However, the system would not help to convert the extra money Su Ping collected into energy. Therefore, money was just money.Although money could not be used to buy items from the system store, money was very useful in the Federation, nearly omnipotent in fact. Just as Lan Lele had said, you could buy anything with enough money. This included the things in warehouses. With enough money, one could also spend money to hire settlers to buy them with merit points before trading with them.Su Ping had come up with this idea at the last minute. He didn\u2019t expect it to work. This could be considered as taking advantage of the system\u2019s loopholes. After all, the system\u2019s prices were too rigid; loopholes could be found in rigidness. Humans happened to be the most cunning creatures, able to exploit such loopholes.What pained Su Ping was not having thought of this sooner. Otherwise, he could have gotten more money from Su Yanying.However, Su Yanying didn\u2019t even have the money for the nurturing. He couldn\u2019t get much from a poor person.Su Ping glanced at Su Yanying, who was standing next to him.\u201c???\u201dSu Yanying was baffled.Why did she feel like she was being despised?\u201cOne hundred thousand?\u201d Ye Hao was stunned for a moment when he heard Su Ping\u2019s words. He gave him a strange look. It wasn\u2019t that he found it strange to be asked for money, nor did he find it very exorbitant. On the contrary, he felt that the pricing was too low.To be able to cultivate a low-level Lightning Rat to such a level, it had to be done by a master trainer.As for the store that had a master trainer, the queuing fee was only a hundred thousand?Was a hundred thousand even considered money?In his eyes, that was not the case.As far as he knew, those well-known pet shops with a master trainer needed years to make an advanced appointment. If they wanted to cut the queue, they would need at least a few hundred thousand. If they were to directly cut the queue to the front of the line, they would need at least a million.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Ye Hao immediately nodded his head. As he agreed, he glanced at Su Yanying and then at Lan Lele beside her. Although 100,000 wasn\u2019t money to him, it was a little foolish to give it willy-nilly. He thought that Lan Lele\u2019s family was rich after all, so everything they said could be trusted.Su Ping was stunned for a moment when he saw Ye Hao agree so readily. He regretted it immediately.When a man is poor, his ambition isn\u2019t far-reaching!It seemed like he had accepted too little!He sighed in his heart, but he couldn\u2019t go back on his word at this moment. Was he going to simply accept it? He pondered for a moment and suddenly remembered that he had said he was going to consider. Yes, consider.The word \u201cconsider\u201d was debatable.He glanced at Ye Hao and said, \u201cSince you\u2019re so straightforward, I\u2019ll let you be the tenth in line.\u201dSu Yanying and Lan Lele were dumbfounded once again.Tenth?Are there people making advanced appointments at your shop?If they remembered correctly, every time they went to Su Ping\u2019s store, the boss would be slumped on the counter doing nothing. The store was bleak. There weren\u2019t any customers.Besides, if someone really made an appointment, would they still be forced to send out flyers?!Ye Hao, on the other hand, felt that it was very normal and was rather happy. However, he noticed that Su Yanying and Lan Lele\u2019s expressions seemed a little strange. He couldn\u2019t help but feel that something was amiss. He pondered for a moment and felt that there shouldn\u2019t be any problems. There was no chance that they were lying.If he was a liar, with his family\u2019s connections, he absolutely could make Su Ping pay a heavy price!\u201cOkay.\u201d Ye Hao agreed. He asked for Su Ping\u2019s account and immediately transferred 100,000 to him.Su Ping clicked his tongue poignantly when he heard the sound of a deposit notification. This was a rich and handsome guy from a famous school. He spent money without batting an eyelid. Sure enough, it wasn\u2019t wrong to come here to fleece... no\u2014solicit business.\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll inform you of the exact time when it\u2019s your turn,\u201d Su Ping said generously.Ye Hao nodded slightly and suddenly asked, \u201cBoss Su, from what you said earlier, have you personally seen Beast Kings before?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Su Ping said casually.Su Yanying and Lan Lele were stunned when they heard this. They looked at Su Ping in astonishment. He had seen a Beast King before? They had only seen one in the disaster news at most. But in reality, they hadn\u2019t even seen a ninth-rank pet, not to mention a Beast King.Ye Hao was taken aback. He took a closer look at Su Ping. Could he really be a member of a big family? Only those big family clans had the ability to protect their clansmen so that they had the chance to see a Beast King in real life as a way to embolden them.However, it was also possible that he was just taking a peek from afar. It wasn\u2019t as amazing as he thought.\u201cBoss Su is indeed extraordinary,\u201d he praised with a smile.Su Ping was pleased. This young man has a bright future.With the two ladies by his side, Ye Hao didn\u2019t want to appear too humble. After all, his status wasn\u2019t too bad either. After informing the two girls, he turned around and left.Once Ye Hao was gone, Su Yanying asked Su Ping at once, \u201cBoss, is it true what you said? Have you really seen a Beast King? And, is my Lightning Rat really not afraid of one?\u201dSu Ping nodded his head. \u201cIt\u2019s basically immune to deterrence-type skills. So, feel free to fight with the Lightning Rat. After all, your match will be the grand finale. I\u2019m sure everyone here has heard about your Lightning Rat. If they don\u2019t see it in action, wouldn\u2019t they be disappointed? They might even think that all the hearsay was just a bunch of false rumors.\u201dSu Yanying was taken aback. She had never thought about this. Su Ping\u2019s words made sense. In that case, even if the Lightning Rat was intimidated by the advanced Thunder Basilisk, she had no choice but to battle with it.Lan Lele nodded as well. \u201cBoss is right. If you use the Fallen Phoenix, even if the other party is willing to give in, it will be a one-sided defeat, making the Thunder Basilisk stand out in the entire exhibition match. Your brilliance will be completely covered up and no one will pay attention to you anymore. Instead, if you use the Lightning Rat, as long as you display the skills of your pet, it will be enough to attract attention. It doesn\u2019t matter if you lose.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Su Yanying nodded. Seeing that something was wrong with her expression, she asked, \u201cWhy?\u201dLan Lele snorted at the direction where Ye Hao had left and said, \u201cThis Ye Hao has ill intentions. These days, all the academy has been talking about your Lightning Rat. I think he\u2019s just jealous and wants to steal your limelight. What kind reminder? He\u2019s just a snobbish fellow.\u201d She had been born in a business environment, so she was more sensitive to these things than Su Yanying.Su Yanying was not stupid. She understood what she meant and frowned slightly.Lan Lele snorted and said, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that Boss cheated him out of a hundred thousand. He paid a small price for it. Hmph, who asked him to scheme against someone?\u201dSu Ping objected, \u201cWhat do you mean by me cheating him out of a hundred thousand? My pricing is very reasonable, all right!?\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two sides left the stage after the announcer notified their departure. Very soon, new people appeared.After two consecutive rounds, the quarter-finals finished their exhibition matches. Next was the semi-finals.After the semi-finals, it was the champion exhibition match.The champion exhibition match started from the first years, with the third years being the finale.When the sun set and the sky above the stadium completely darkened, the champion exhibition match began.When the announcer declared the beginning of the champion exhibition match for the first years, Su Ping, who was dozing off, woke up immediately. His interest was piqued when he thought about that proud sister of his who was about to show up.To be honest, he had never seen Su Lingyue in real combat.As for Su Lingyue\u2019s Phantom Flame Beast, it had already reached the mid-tier of the fourth rank. It could even rank in the top eight amongst the third years, much less the first years. Although this fellow was usually arrogant, she did have the right to act the part.In one of the first grade classes, a few girls were surrounding a girl with black, straight, long hair. When they heard the announcer present the final match, one of the girls reminded the black-haired girl in the middle, \u201cYueyue, it\u2019s your turn.\u201dSu Lingyue nodded slightly, her expression cold.This was her usual behavior in school. The people around her didn\u2019t find it strange and were already used to it.\u201cAll the best, Yueyue. Defeat him with your most beautiful pet skills!\u201d Another round-faced girl clenched her fists and cheered.Su Lingyue nodded.At this moment, the announcer presented her name and the other person\u2019s. At the same time, a beam of light shone over, enveloping Su Lingyue in the crowd, attracting everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cAll the best!\u201d\u201cAll the best!\u201dThe girls cheered her on.Su Lingyue stood up. When she passed the mentor in front of her class, the mentor said to her earnestly, \u201cDon\u2019t be careless. Even if it\u2019s an exhibition match, it won\u2019t look good if you lose.\u201dSu Lingyue nodded and walked onto the competition stage.Her opponent was already standing on the other side of the stage. He was waving at a certain part of the stadium, as if someone he knew was there.Many students brought their families to watch the exhibition match.When Su Lingyue saw the other party\u2019s actions, she thought of the admission ticket she had given in the morning. Her heart skipped a beat. I wonder if he\u2019s here yet? She subconsciously glanced at a particular place of the audience stands; it was the area for the admission ticket she gave.There was a sea of people there, but she had excellent eyesight. After a sweep, she didn\u2019t see that familiar and detestable face.After that, his face became even more detestable in her heart.As expected, he didn\u2019t come... Humph, it\u2019s good that he didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t care for him. Su Lingyue was fuming in her heart. She gritted her teeth. If she had known earlier, she wouldn\u2019t have given him the ticket. It would have been better to throw it in the trash can!She looked away and casually glanced at other places. It was the area for the upperclassmen. Suddenly, she saw something familiar... To be precise, it was a person. She looked carefully and her eyes widened.It\u2019s him?Is it really him?!Our little Ne Zha1... Pui! Pui! Pui!It\u2019s that bastard?!How did he get into the upperclassmen area?Wait a minute. Isn\u2019t that the owner of the Lightning Rat next to him?!Su Lingyue was a little surprised. After double checking, she realized that she wasn\u2019t mistaken. Not only was he there, but he was also sitting in the front row, surrounded by famous people from the school.What... is going on?!The referee at the side of the stage was also speechless. What is going on? I\u2019ve already called out to her three times, but she still doesn\u2019t hear me?!\u201cSu Lingyue?\u201d the referee shouted again.Su Lingyue heard this and came back to her senses. She looked at the referee.\u201cThe match has begun,\u201d the referee reminded.Only then did Su Lingyue react. She looked at her opponent, and noticed how his originally smiling face had turned into a furious one... feeling that he had been despised?Su Lingyue felt a little wronged, but there was no way to explain it. Besides, it was fine if he was angered. She was not afraid. Her thoughts had returned to the match. Thinking of the despicable fellow below the stage, she raised her chin slightly. Hmph, I\u2019ll show you how powerful I am!She directly let the Phantom Flame Beast reveal its true form and enter a battle state.Howl!The Phantom Flame Beast jumped down from her shoulder and landed on the ground with a baby-like roar. However, after it roared, its body was instantly enlarged, turning into a ferocious tiger that was nearly two meters tall. Black wings grew out from its back.The advanced pets of the demon family had three abilities\u2014flight, illusion, and fire!Also, their close combat skills were not bad. They were the most popular among the advanced pets. Even in their young state, their prices were very expensive.Her opponent also summoned his pet. It was the most popular dragon-type pet, the Silver-Winged Dragon!This was a dragon hybrid, but it had extraordinary combat strength. It had a ninth-rank bloodline, but it was still in its growing stages. Its body was only five meters long, and its combat strength was around the fourth-rank.\u201cAttack!\u201d Su Lingyue raised her hand, and four amplification skills were instantly applied to the Phantom Flame Beast. She was a first-year student, but her amplification skills were all level two. Judging from her casting speed, she was extremely skilled; it wouldn\u2019t be very long for her to reach level three.If a strong pet could be bought with the wealth of a family, most students would still be unconvinced, but this augmentation skill was enough to show Su Lingyue\u2019s skills and hard work. This was not something that could be achieved with money.Her opponent was also using an amplification skill, but he was clearly slower than her. Furthermore, the increase in strength was actually at level one.For first years, a first-level augmentation was the passing mark for the year-end examination.However, the speed of the opponent\u2019s casting was also very fast. It wouldn\u2019t take long for her opponent to reach level two.As soon as the Phantom Flame Beast went on stage, it unleashed the familiar spiritual intrusion and interfered using illusions. This illusion not only affected pets, but also their owners.The moment the Silver-Winged Dragon was affected by the illusion, it suddenly let out a dragon\u2019s roar. The spiritual power of a dragon-type pet was extremely strong. Considering the pride of the dragon species, it was unwilling to bow its head so easily. With the dragon roar\u2019s dispelling, the illusion that had invaded its master\u2019s mind was also cleared.However, the effect of the illusion was still effective. It had stalled for time.The Phantom Flame Beast flew out at a rapid speed, spewing flames.Flames surged out like a sea, and the scorching temperature was swept out. The entire stadium was rising in temperature.The Silver-Winged Dragon roared and blasted out cold air. It also flew up and clashed with the Phantom Flame Beast.The collision between flames and ice, the roar of a dragon, and the intense battle made the crowd cheer even louder.Su Ping nodded slightly. It was a good show.\u201cThe first-year students nowadays are very strong.\u201d Lan Lele and Su Yanying sighed. They had not been as strong when they were first-years. This was truly the era of a new generation!The battle continued, and it was extremely intense. Not long after, an unexpected illusion interfered. Su Lingyue\u2019s opponent was suddenly distracted, and the Silver-Winged Dragon, who didn\u2019t receive any instructions, suddenly became a little rigid. It was caught by the Phantom Flame Beast, and a huge fireball blasted it out of the stage, causing the front row to tremble like an earthquake.The cheers erupted again.Su Lingyue looked at the Phantom Flame Beast that was slowly descending and a smile appeared on her face. From the corner of her eye, she saw that hateful face was smiling. Just like the people around him, he was clapping for her.She was slightly taken aback as she stole a glance with a smug look in her eyes before she looked away. She turned around and bowed to thank the crowd before turning to leave the stage.At this moment, the girl\u2019s back was facing the lights of the entire stadium. Only her silhouette was left. However, the illuminated corner of her mouth was slightly curved upwards.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Each of the fruits could be sold at several hundred coins but none of these people darted a single glance at them.\u201cThe girl that used the Phantom Flame Beast has a fast reaction. She is worth training.\u201d\u201cI see two good students here. I believe I must pay this place another visit in two years.\u201d\u201cWell, why bother? I think you like to sign contracts in private. Why don\u2019t you go and sign them now?\u201d\u201cRight. We agreed that we must compete fairly. It turns out that a certain shameless person went and used contracts to confuse the kids. How despicable!\u201dSeveral people were sneering and anger was visible in their eyes. Only two in the group were smiling as if they couldn\u2019t understand what the others meant. One of the two even had the guts to say with a laugh, \u201cThe view tonight is stunning.\u201dVice Principal Dong Mingsong was sitting on the side with those guests. His face was smiling while his heart was beaming with pride. Usually, the school had to try hard to make those top-tier teams select their outstanding students, and to ask those teams to take care of and train those students. But the tables had turned. It was the teams\u2019 turn to beg him. This made Dong Mingsong feel so good!Someone noticed how this old, sly fox was grinning. Pulling a long face, that person asked, \u201cVice Principal Dong, tell me honestly. How much money have they paid you?\u201dDong Mingsong was taken aback. With confusion, he answered with more questions, \u201cMoney? What money?\u201d\u201cHmm! Still lying!\u201d\u201cVice Principal Dong, this is unfair of you. The Principal never did such things. Are you going to hold the scales evenly or not?\u201dFilled with anger, several people turned their looks to Dong Mingsong. They were all from top-tier teams. While they couldn\u2019t do anything to the two shameless people, they could be less polite toward Dong Mingsong.Dong Mingsong replied with an innocent tone, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. By the time I found out, they had already signed the contracts. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d\u201cHow could you possibly not know? I will tell this to the Principal. Believe me,\u201d someone claimed in rage.Dong Mingsong said, upset, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say even if you tell the Principal. I honestly did not know.\u201dSince he was sticking to his story, the others were enraged and yet helpless. They were at a loss when they tried to figure out what to do with the two shameless people and one old fox. Secretly, those people were regretting not coming up with such shameless moves themselves. Why did they have to be so noble and pure in their thoughts?That was a sin!On the spectators\u2019 seats, Su Yanying said to Su Ping as she looked at the champion of grade two who had come to the stage for the match, \u201cIt\u2019ll be our turn soon.\u201dSu Ping sat on his seat and looked around, bored. Now and then, he would gaze at the seats in the distance by the stage. He saw several people there. They had to be the most powerful few in the entire stadium.\u201cAre those top-tier teams that have come to the school to recruit students?\u201d Su Ping\u2019s eyes glowed. The top-tier explorer\u2019s teams would only pick students with both potential and strength from amongst the famous students. The second and third-tier teams could only pick students out of average Astral Pet universities.There were seven famous schools in the Longjiang Base City, and Phoenix Peak Academy was one of them.Fan Yujing\u2019s sister, Fan Xiaoyu, was studying in another famous school as well, one that was in the upper town area. Even amongst the seven famous schools, that school was at the top; it had a well-established fame that went beyond the Longjiang Base City.Su Yanying noticed that Su Ping\u2019s mind was wandering. She whispered to alert him, \u201cSir?\u201dSu Ping came back to his senses and threw her a glance. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be our turn soon,\u201d Su Yanying repeated.Su Ping replied, \u201cOh, I heard you.\u201dSu Yanying was surprised. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to get prepared?\u201d\u201cPrepare?\u201d Su Ping gave her a look of confusion. \u201cPrepare what?\u201d\u201cEh...\u201d Su Yanying didn\u2019t know how to answer when Su Ping had such a nonchalant attitude. It was the exhibition match and winning or losing would not change anything. That being said, if she were to suffer a huge loss, that could still exert some influence and she would be embarrassed.Besides, she had signed a contract with a team; she knew that the team she was going to join after the vacation was there that day. They could see her performance.Even if it was only an exhibition match, she was not less nervous than when she was in a formal competition.\u201cNothing.\u201d Su Yanying shook her head. She supposed Su Ping just wanted to step on the stage and advocate his Lightning Rat. She was the main character. The splendor of the match was going to be up to her. She closed her eyes at once to adjust herself and relax her body first.Then, she began to go through the possible scenarios of the match in her head. After all, she had fought against the Thunder Basilisk. She knew what skills that pet had mastered. This time around, the Thunder Basilisk had improved and progressed, which gave her more pressure. She could not make any mistakes. Otherwise, she would lose with shame!Time zipped by.The exhibition match between the champion and the runner-up of the second years had come to an end. The combat was more intense compared to that of the first years. The atmosphere was heated and everyone was more excited than ever.With much anticipation, the commentator presented Su Yanying and Ye Hao\u2019s names. Another wave of passionate cheers came from the audience. Many families of the students present were inspired by this lively scene. At the same time, they felt a bit jealous and pitiful. After all, those two were not their kids.\u201cBrother, it\u2019s our turn now!\u201dYe Hao sat amongst the crowd of the third year\u2019s class six. He was radiating like the sun and people could pick him out from the crowd immediately. Sitting next to him was a girl about 16 or 17 years old. She dressed in a pretty and fashionable way, wearing a coffee-colored knitted hat, and her earlobes were shining because of two delicate crystal ear studs.Noticing that the atmosphere had been ignited because of Ye Hao\u2019s name, her face was covered with excitement. Ever since she was a kid, her brother had been her idol. He had always been the best whether considering his powers as a battle pet warrior or his strength in other studies.\u201cYin, let\u2019s go.\u201d Ye Hao smiled and stood up. His classmates applauded him and cheered for him. Ye Hao was the monitor of his class. He was handsome and wealthy, as well as gentle and humble. The girls in his class adored him and... so did the boys.Ye Qingyin stood up, giggling.The two of them walked in the corridor. Many contract runes began to emerge in the air. The Thunder Basilisk stuck its head out from the space. Ye Hao held his sister\u2019s hand and hopped onto the head of the Thunder Basilisk. The next moment, its more than ten meter long body also came out from the contract space. The Thunder Basilisk flapped its wings, creating turbulent currents for those who sat by the corridor.Some boys had spent a long time getting their fangs ready but were left in a mess after the crazy wind surge. They weren\u2019t looking good in front of their muse. Angry, those boys said some swear words in their hearts.At the same time, Ye Hao had already mounted onto the dragon and taken flight. He caught the attention of all those present. The dragon roared as he neared the stage.This kind of appearance was undoubtedly impressive and arrogant; adding his handsome looks, many girls began to cheer in a frenzy. Some of them almost fainted due to the excitement.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: Frightened Lighting RatPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83: Frightened Lighting RatTranslator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsSu Yanying was ready as well. She could feel how excited people were. She took a deep breath and said to Su Ping, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Su Ping nodded.\u201cYingying, good luck.\u201d Lan Lele cheered for her.Su Yanying nodded. She walked to the corridor with Su Ping following her. Many people noticed the two and there was a small-scale cheer for them.Su Yanying presented herself with a low-key attitude; most of the audience was still focusing their attention on the handsome man standing on top of the soaring dragon. In comparison, Su Yanying\u2019s glow was subdued and she received little attention.Ye Hao slowly descended to the stage. By then, those that had been paying attention to him finally noticed Su Yanying on the other side of the stage. There was another round of cheers.Ye Hao was lofty and out of reach. On the other hand, people were more curious about the mysteries hidden by Su Yanying.People not only regarded Su Yanying as a talent. They thought she was a geek, since no normal person would devote so much energy to a Lightning Rat.\u201cThere\u2019s something off about this Thunder Basilisk, right?\u201d\u201cIt is just huge!\u201d\u201cThis size... the Thunder Basilisk is not in his growth stage anymore. Right?\u201dMany outstanding students and teachers present were shocked the moment the Thunder Basilisk emerged. Most likely, the Thunder Basilisk had reached adulthood given its sheer size. Which rank was an adult Thunder Basilisk at? At least the seventh rank!This was a pet that had reached the advanced level, not to mention that the Thunder Basilisk was of the dragon family, the most fierce of all advanced pets!Amongst pets of the same rank, pets of the dragon family were the strongest of all in combat, far superior to the other pets. Only a few pets of the demon family could compete against those of the dragon family.\u201cA Thunder Basilisk that has just reached adulthood?\u201d On the spectator\u2019s seats, some of the powerful warriors from top-tier teams were taken aback. A pet of the dragon family of the seventh rank? The master had to be at the fifth rank as a minimum to summon such a pet. If the master was at the fourth rank, the master\u2019s astral power would be sucked out and the pet would escape the constraints that came with the contract. The pet would lose control and even hurt its master.\u201cA student with a fifth-rank astral power.\u201d Some among the powerful people pulled long faces and only one of them was wearing a smile with excitement and pride. He had signed a contract with Ye Hao to later join his team. As for the fact that the Thunder Basilisk had achieved a breakthrough, he had found out at the contract signing. Because of this, the team gave Ye Hao excellent benefits. Ye Hao could become an official explorer directly.Besides, Ye Hao could have access to Class B uncultivated areas and train there. This was a great start for him. Not long in the future, Ye Hao was very likely to become a gold medal explorer. He was a talent that had the potential to become a team captain!The other people then understood what had happened. They cast a look at this smiling man, all with awful looks on their faces.Previously, they were just sorry that they couldn\u2019t sign a contract with this talent. At the moment, they were furious.They would be scolded by their captains if they found out that such a talent had been snatched away by others. More importantly, they felt sorry that such a talent would empower another team. This was just a huge loss!Since the talent was unattainable, people would be prone to pick bones. Several of them glared at Dong Mingsonga and one of them snorted. \u201cVice Principal Dong, this Thunder Basilisk has reached the seventh rank. Even among the explorers, such a level can be considered formidable. I don\u2019t think this exhibition match must go on. Miss Su\u2019s Lightning Rat is strong. That being said, it is a low-rank pet, not a match to the Thunder Basilisk at all. Besides, if you ask me, this Thunder Basilisk is beginning to show the dragon\u2019s deterrence trait. I\u2019m afraid the combat will come to an end before it even begins.\u201dHe was the one that signed a contract with Su Yanying. She was currently on his team. That was why he would address her as \u201cMiss Su,\u201d and why he couldn\u2019t accept this seemingly unfair match. Not only would she serve as a prop to Ye Hao, but her opponent would also be able to make a show of authority.Besides, the Lighting Rat was a rat. People would normally say \u201cas timid as a mouse\u201d for a reason. The Lightning Rat was timid and it would be frightened when coming across a pet of the dragon family. If some psychological trauma was caused, then this genius Lightning Rat would be broken!Hearing his words, the other people sneered. The dog-eat-dog fight had begun.The others just sat on the side and looked on with a detachment.Dong Mingsong hurried to calm that man down, \u201cI have told their teachers and Ye Hao promised he would alert Miss Su as well and ask her to send out the Fallen Phoenix. He will pull his punches. After all, the Fallen Phoenix is also an advanced pet. Although the Fallen Phoenix has yet to reach adulthood, it does have its pride and will not be overwhelmed by the dragon\u2019s deterrence. Her defeat will not be embarrassing.\u201dHowever, this man was unhappy. \u201cIs it an exhibition match when one side enjoys a land sliding advantage?\u201d\u201cWell, the exhibition match is just for people to enjoy a show. Only a match where you can win and you can show up is called a fair game, right?\u201d The young man that signed a contract with Ye Hao sneered. \u201cIf you have true abilities, just win with your strength. We have made compromises. What more do you want? This is a place where strength rules. Will you have a debate with the monsters and beasts about what is \u2018fair\u2019 when you are exploring uncharted lands?\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dDong Mingsong mediated between the two quarreling parties. \u201cThe match is about to begin. Let us watch it for now.\u201dThe two pulled long faces and snorted out of contempt, but neither continued the verbal fight.On the stage, Ye Hao and his sister had landed on the ground. He said to his sister, \u201cStay within my Astral Shield and do not come out.\u201d\u201cSure. Good luck, brother,\u201d Ye Qingyin said with a chuckle.Many people recognized Ye Qingyin when they saw her. Someone exclaimed, \u201cIsn\u2019t she a new trainee of Star Entertainment Media?\u201d\u201cIs that so? The singer who made the song \u2018The Snow Sings and the Star Dances\u2019 popular?\u201d\u201cOh my god. I\u2019m a huge fan of hers. She\u2019s Ye Hao\u2019s sister? God, their family is awesome. They\u2019re so good looking! Please save some grace for us!\u201dYe Qingyin\u2019s presence caused some minor disturbances. As opposed to her brother Ye Hao\u2019s interests, she liked music. Therefore, she didn\u2019t go down the path of becoming a battle pet warrior. Instead, she became a singer. She had gone to the exhibition match to cheer for her brother, and at the same time boost her popularity with the exposure.She believed that she would be the highlight of the base city\u2019s entertainment news the next day.Su Yanying noticed Ye Qingyin by Ye Hao\u2019s side as well and this took her by surprise. Su Yanying had once heard Ye Qingyin\u2019s song by chance and knew her. But Su Yanying had no idea that she, the star, was Ye Hao\u2019s younger sister.In this era, battle pet warriors were the mainstream in society. However, battle pet warriors did watch TV and listen to music. Therefore, those singers and actors had their markets and they were supported by their fans as well.COMMENTSu Ping noticed the look on Su Yanying\u2019s face and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dSu Yanying came back to her senses and shook her head. \u201cNothing.\u201d The look in her eyes became more serious as she focused her mind. Astral powers surged within her when she opened up the pet space and summoned both the Lighting Rat and the Fallen Phoenix.She trusted Su Ping when he said that the Lighting Rat could withstand the dragon\u2019s deterrence. Still, just to make sure, she summoned the Fallen Phoenix as well.The match didn\u2019t stipulate that no two pets could be summoned at the same time. It was just that the demand for the master\u2019s control when two pets were called out was much stricter. Just by applying the augmentation skills on the two pets would exhaust one-third of her astral power, not to mention that she had to multitask.If she did well, the outcome would be stunning. But if she couldn\u2019t handle it, she would be in a muddle and it could backfire on her.\u201cWhy did she take out the Lightning Rat?\u201d Off the stage, Su Yanying\u2019s mentor and Dong Mingsong were both shocked. Previously, her mentor had found a chance to tell her. She agreed at the time, but it was clear that she didn\u2019t accept it.\u201cHmm.\u201d Ye Hao\u2019s eyes glistened with coldness when he saw Su Yanying call out the Lightning Rat. She was incorrigible. He warned her out of goodwill but she was ungrateful.The Lightning Rat that had just hopped out from the contract space caught the attention of everyone present. As soon as the Lightning Rat landed on the ground, it felt a threat, something that was familiar and unforgettable.In an instant, all of its hair stood on its roots. A reflection of someone standing on the side was visible in the Lightning Rat\u2019s eyes.\u201cHmm.\u201d Noticing how the Lightning Rat was behaving, the contempt in Ye Hao\u2019s eyes deepened. What was the use of having talents and a strong comprehending power? Nothing like this would be of any use when a truly powerful being was there. The Lightning Rat didn\u2019t even dare to stand in front of a pet of the dragon family!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: Decisive FailurePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84: Decisive FailureSu Ping saw the Lightning Rat looking quite stressed and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cHey, little guy. Miss me?\u201dThe creature immediately hid behind Su Yanying\u2019s leg and trembled upon seeing Su Ping\u2019s wicked grin, one that had been imprinted deep inside its memory. Its recent life was quite enjoyable because Su Yanying always made sure there was enough food, care and rest. But as soon as it saw Su Ping again, it was reminded of all the nightmarish training it received a while back.Su Yanying, on the other hand, was glad that she brought her Fallen Phoenix as a back-up plan. Still, she wondered why her Lightning Rat was afraid of Su Ping, instead of the Thunder Basilisk on the other side of the stage.Unfortunately, she couldn\u2019t read her pet\u2019s mind with more accuracy yet.Wait, why is HE up there? Su Lingyue saw his brother showing up together with the \u201crunner up\u201d of the third year and failed to believe her eyes.She had always seen Su Ping as a sluggish and useless failure who knew nothing other than bullying the weak. How could he even stand together with Su Yanying?More importantly, what was he doing on stage? Was he going to play a grandiose prank in public?Knowing him, Su Lingyue knew she almost had the right answer.Curse him. So that\u2019s why he was in the seniors\u2019 area. To hook up with a girl! Su Lingyue felt her good mood was instantly replaced by sudden fury.\u201cGet ready, you two!\u201d On the stage, the judge was already announcing the start of the match. In fact, he felt more stressed than the participants because he was responsible for ensuring their safety; he wasn\u2019t so sure he could stop a Thunder Basilisk, who had just been promoted to the seventh rank.Su Yanying nodded to the judge and gave her Fallen Phoenix the order to move. The bird leaped into the sky while covered in intense flames; the entire stadium became hotter.\u201cBlazing Ray!\u201d Su Yanying told it to use its strongest move when they still had the chance.The audience exclaimed in awe when they saw the fourth-rank Fallen Phoenix using an eighth-rank skill. Blazing Ray was not an inheritable skill, which meant Su Yanying put a lot of effort in training her pet.Ye Hao saw how the crowd was reacting and smiled widely. This was just what he wanted\u2014the better Su Yanying performed, the more glorious he would look after defeating her.Upon receiving his order, the Thunder Basilisk unleashed a deafening howl toward the sky, causing everyone watching to flinch under its absolute might.The Fallen Phoenix, too, had its actions interrupted. Its Blazing Ray rapidly shrank until it disappeared.\u201cIt cut off an eighth-rank skill using its roar! So that\u2019s the true power of a high-rank battle pet...\u201d some among the audience uttered.Su Yanying grimaced as she realized that her opponent never intended to give her a chance to \u201cexhibit\u201d, just like Lan Lele mentioned.The Fallen Phoenix felt the rage of its master and responded by gathering its flame again.\u201cStill unwilling to give up? Good. Let\u2019s play some more.\u201d Ye Hao smirked.The Thunder Basilisk didn\u2019t attempt to stop the attack this time. It patiently waited until the scorching fire beam approached and struck its wing.Bang!The main screen in the stadium showed a close-up picture of the attack. There, people saw a finger-sized white scar left behind on the Thunder Basilisk\u2019s wing, which didn\u2019t look like a serious injury at all. Before the camera was pulled away, the scar was already disappearing.A Thunder Basilisk was also believed to be a dragon-type. Such creatures usually possessed superior resistance as well as self-regeneration properties. It was rare to see a dragon-type Astral Pet bleed to death.Once again, the spectators called out in surprise.Even if the Fallen Phoenix was below the fifth rank, that beam attack still packed a punch. A pet of the same rank would have already been killed by it. And yet, the Thunder Basilisk shrugged it off!Su Yanying was then too shocked to act. That was indeed her Fallen Phoenix\u2019s best skill. At this rate, she would be unable to get through the Thunder Basilisk defense at all, even if it stood there and let her pet do its worst.The gap between them was way too big!Ye Hao smiled in satisfaction when he looked at Su Yanying\u2019s face, before he told his basilisk to unleash a combination of showy attacks\u2014Dragon Breath, Frigid Brine, Thunderstorm and Leer, all of which were high-rank skills.The first three were meant to show off the well-balanced potential of the creature, while the last one was for intimidating the Fallen Phoenix. Anything with an inferior bloodline would only tremble under the basilisk\u2019s gaze.The first three skills went off somewhere in the sky without hitting the phoenix, which was what Ye Hao tried to do. Still, their deadly power did a number to the stage below as if some kind of brutal battle had just destroyed everything.If he wanted, Ye Hao could absolutely ask the basilisk to burn the stadium down.The Fallen Phoenix stopped moving as soon as it was affected by the Leer skill. It tumbled down and slammed into the floor while still trembling badly.It lost, hands-down.The stadium remained quiet for a while at the end of the game because people at least expected some kind of exciting clash between those two brilliant pets. However, as it turned out, Su Yanying was nothing when fighting against Ye Hao. All she did was amplify Ye Hao\u2019s dominance.It couldn\u2019t be helped, though. A seventh-rank Thunder Basilisk was just too powerful.\u201cI... I...\u201d Su Yanying was overwhelmed by both rage and despair.\u201cCome on, where\u2019s your Lightning Rat?\u201dSu Yanying looked up and saw Su Ping giving her an odd look.\u201cBut my rat is\u2014\u201d\u201cYour rat is braver than you think.\u201dOn second thought, Su Ping decided not to let the girl continue as it was. In such a state, she would just lose another match miserably.\u201cFine, let me handle it.\u201d Su Ping sighed and looked at the small creature still shuddering beside Su Yanying\u2019s feet. \u201cHey, little one, come here already, if you don\u2019t want to embarrass both me and your master to death.\u201dThe rat blinked and pretended with an \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about\u201d look.Su Ping rolled his eyes and sent a spiritual order that way. \u201cDo as I say or I\u2019ll take you to another training trip.\u201dThe rat understood the evil will hidden behind those words. In order not to go through all those nightmares again, it slowly joined Su Ping, after giving its master a pleading look.\u201cSee that guy over there? Beat it up, and I\u2019ll leave you alone.\u201dThe Lightning Rat looked at the Thunder Basilisk with excitement clearly shown in its tiny eyes. Earning more vacations was more than enough reason for it to follow Su Ping\u2019s order through.It puffed up its body, sharpened its claws and displayed the unstoppable will to fight.Su Yanying almost fell agape when looking at her pet so obedient when Su Ping didn\u2019t even have a pet contract with it. She heard how experienced battle pet warriors could communicate with other pets using their spirits, but... She never thought Su Ping could do such a thing with her rat.And I never told my Lightning Rat would listen to him!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Next, it created a blade made out of electricity and slashed at the Thunder Basilisk\u2019s neck.Several scales were knocked off, leaving a shallow cut behind.Roar!The Thunder Basilisk furiously gazed at the smaller enemy annoyingly hopping about.\u201cWhat was that??\u201d\u201cThe Lightning Rat!\u201dOnce again, the onlookers didn\u2019t know how they should react after witnessing such a reversal. They all recognized the Lightning Rat, but nobody expected it to actually hurt a seventh-rank Thunder Basilisk who had just reached adulthood.As they believed, the Thunder Basilisk could scare off weaker opponents by simply standing there, or greatly intimidate stronger ones. How could the Lightning Rat make the first move?Rats were supposed to be cowards!All the people in the stadium, including the invited settlers, thought that the match had ended when the Fallen Phoenix fell. Yet they were proven wrong by a Lightning Rat they had been ignoring for a moment.A Lightning Rat bold enough to challenge a basilisk. What kind of rat was that?\u201cWhat the...\u201d Ye Hao also checked the new enemy in astonishment. When he looked further, he saw Su Yanying similarly shocked.And he felt displeased. If his Thunder Basilisk failed to suppress the rat, he would be helping the rat look better instead.\u201cHeh, I see.\u201d He took a deep breath and sent his killing intent to the basilisk.He had decided to utterly destroy the little nuisance. No matter what happened during the match, people would only remember the winner.Roar!Affected by both its master\u2019s emotions and its challenged ego, the Thunder Basilisk shrieked madly. The sound, combined with the natural aura of a mighty basilisk, echoed in the stadium, making all those present shudder in fear.This was how people usually felt when going up against dragon-type Astral Pets. They\u2019d lose their will to resist at the very beginning.The participants of the tournament grew exceptionally restless. Since the Thunder Basilisk easily knocked them out before breaking through to the seventh-rank. They wondered what would happen if they were to repeat the matches right then. They\u2019d forfeit beforehand, probably.\u201cSh*t! That\u2019s what you get for playing jokes on such an occasion!\u201d Su Lingyue clenched her fists while looking at the miserable image of his brother. She was ready to go to his rescue at a moment\u2019s notice because that basilisk could make short work of him anytime.\u201cFrigid Brine!\u201dUnder Ye Hao\u2019s command, the Thunder Basilisk unleashed freezing air that immediately expanded to freeze up the stage. Apart from causing a slippery footing, the basilisk could further increase the effect and freeze the Lightning Rat into an ice sculpture, unless the rat knew how to fly.\u201cOh Gods...\u201d The dropping temperature woke Su Yanying up from her shocked state as she realized what Ye Hao was trying to do.Su Ping saw the Lightning Rat still gathering the gray energy of death and rolled his eyes. \u201cStop it. Your enemy won\u2019t give you time to summon a powerful Undead. Use your brain!\u201dHearing Su Ping\u2019s spiritual order, the rat quickly canceled the skill it was casting. It didn\u2019t like being around Su Ping, but it knew how to trust his decisions.The rat tried to use Undead Calling because the best shot it used at the beginning failed to knock out the basilisk, and it felt anxious about finishing the job in time.It assessed the battlefield more carefully and began retreating toward the edge of the stage yet to be covered in ice. Meanwhile, it used All-round Thunder Prison to destroy the approaching ice so it had a safe spot to stand on.Using the same trick, it opened up a small path on the icy stage and slowly approached the Thunder Basilisk.Ye Hao frowned and changed his tactic.The silver eyes of the basilisk glowed as the creature Leered at the Lightning Rat to send the invasive spiritual energy that way.\u201cThunder Roar!\u201d Su Ping ordered.Ordering the rat without a contract wasn\u2019t as convenient, though the rat had spent enough time with him to efficiently heed his order.Another deafening roar boomed inside the stadium despite the rat\u2019s size, causing everyone to flinch yet again.Su Yanying, being so close to the rat, almost jumped in fear.Thunder Roar was a simple intimidation tactic amplified by the power of lightning. It had little effect against the Thunder Basilisk. But at the same time, the Lightning Rat was also moving freely without slowing down by the Leer skill.\u201cDid it fail??\u201d Ye Hao widened his eyes. \u201cDo it again!\u201dRoar!The Lightning Rat kept breaking through the ice, unaffected.Ye Hao had realized that the rat had something to counter the basilisk\u2019s Leer. Though he couldn\u2019t understand how Thunder Roar had played a part in this.Without much time to think of a plan, he simply told the Thunder Basilisk to use Thunderstorm.Su Ping saw several miniature thunderbolts swirling on the basilisk\u2019s wings; checking the Lightning Rat\u2019s position, he noticed that the skill would go off before the rat could reach the basilisk.Damn it. It has a tiny brain after all.Su Ping couldn\u2019t complain. The Thunder Basilisk was a genuine high-rank pet that should not be underestimated, or the match would have ended after the first move. He just had to give more specific orders.\u201cUse Shadow Image and go in three different directions. Cast All-round Thunder Prison as bait, while your true body shall flank it from the side. Tell the other shadows to prepare Thunder Slash and Thunder Rush to get closer. Aim for its vital points and eyes, then send something into its mouth. Now move!\u201dThe basilisk\u2019s attacks were both flashy and deadly. Su Ping was worried that the Lightning Rat would lose for real if the fight was dragged for too long. He had to seize the best possible chance to end everything.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the next second, it coated its fur under lightning bolts and entered full concentration.Thunder Shadow Image!After another flash of blinding light, two more Lightning Rats joined the battle.The All-round Thunder Prison they unleashed had its range tripled and almost covered the entire stage. A large thunder strike came down upon the Thunder Basilisk and swallowed it up.Infuriated, the basilisk spat out a fire beam to fend off the lighting bolt. The conflicting attacks created quite a beautiful sight to behold.Whoosh!As Su Ping instructed, three Lightning Rats dashed toward the basilisk from three directions while preparing different skills.Ye Hao grinned and silently applied an astral rune onto the basilisk\u2019s body. This one was meant to speed up the creature\u2019s energy output.The basilisk aimed its whip-like tail at the closest Lightning Rat. With a \u201cpoof,\u201d the shadow was destroyed. The energy brought by the Thunder Rush and the Thunder Armor was also detonated like a bomb. Still, such energy was not enough to break through the basilisk\u2019s hide.Next, the basilisk shot out another fire beam which overwhelmed another fast-approaching shadow. The attack melted all the ice in its way and made the whole area look blurry.The Lightning Rat was quickly losing control of the shadows it created. It was expected that the shadows would get hit that soon.\u201cThis is too easy.\u201d Ye Hao humphed in disdain. He knew those rats were fake, but he\u2019d get rid of them nonetheless so his opponent wouldn\u2019t hide smart tricks in them.Wait, where\u2019s the real one?The Lightning Rat was occasionally blinking out of existence as it used Thunder Flash to move, preventing everyone from knowing its exact location.Thunder Flash was one of the ten most powerful secret arts available to the thunder family, which was said to allow its user to almost unpredictably teleport around. A pet unable to catch the rat could only bear its rapid assault like a stationary practice dummy.But in this case, the Thunder Basilisk was extremely tough thanks to its superior dragon blood. Maybe the rat could knock off more of its scales, which wouldn\u2019t hurt at all.\u201cPetty tricks are nothing compared to true strength!\u201d Ye Hao smirked again.The Lightning Rat appeared right above the basilisk\u2019s head and made another \u201cflashbang\u201d before the basilisk had time to react. When the basilisk was too blinded to defend itself, the rat clawed at its opened maw.People heard another thunderous roar from the basilisk. But this time, it sounded in pain.Ye Hao regained his sight and saw a large gash almost splitting one side of the basilisk\u2019s mouth. If the wound was any deeper and reached all the way to its neck, the basilisk\u2019s jaw would have come off.The Lightning Rat reappeared several meters away and gazed at the basilisk carefully. There was blood and the residue of some gray energy lingering on its claw. What the rat used was not a lightning attack, but Claw of the Undead. This energy-enhanced attack was enough to harm the basilisk where its defense was weak.\u201cGot you.\u201d Su Ping smiled in satisfaction.Everything happened within five seconds so nobody knew how the seemingly losing Lightning Rat suddenly gained the upper hand. It was the turn for the Thunder Basilisk to look pitiful.\u201cWhat just\u2014\u201dThe settlers were just as dumbstruck as the students. They saw the Lightning Rat using the same moves as before, but in a completely different way. Such an ingenious tactic had improved the effect of Thunder Rush several times.Su Yanying just couldn\u2019t believe that the battle could turn out to be this easy for the Lightning Rat. She only saw her partner rushing there and using its claw in a direct attack, and everything was done.Ye Hao spent a moment looking at his wounded pet and suddenly showed a cruel look.Roar!The Thunder Basilisk screeched hysterically and floated in the sky. It gathered the intense power of lightning until its entire body became a shining globe.Then the creature aimed its attack at the place where Su Yanying and Su Ping were standing.\u201cNo\u2014\u201dSu Yanying immediately knew what Ye Hao was trying to do. He was forcing the Lightning Rat to protect its master from the attack. As an offensive pet bad at defense, the rat would get into serious trouble at this rate.To make it worse, the effect of Frigid Brine had locked up Su Yanying\u2019s feet. The basilisk could have frozen her to death if its master instructed it to.\u201cYou asked for it.\u201d Su Ping frowned. He had more than one way to kill the basilisk back there but didn\u2019t find that necessary. But then...He sent another order to the Lightning Rat, who responded by showing a bloodthirsty look.Ye Hao asked the Thunder Basilisk to go into the sky so the Lightning Rat couldn\u2019t reach it. But this was no longer helpful when the rat could use Thunder Flash to freely and rapidly go where it wanted.The rat reached the basilisk\u2019s bleeding mouth in a millisecond and unleashed several attacks at the same time.Bloodthirst Bite, Claw of the Undead, and finally, Thunder Slash.Boom.The \u201chealthy side\u201d of the basilisk\u2019s mouth exploded.Losing focus, it had its skill interjected and allowed the Lightning Rat to see another opportunity to attack.The rat jumped onto its back and used Thunder Rush.The basilisk was hurled toward the ground as if it were being knocked away by a hammer. The falling momentum made a large crater on the stage floor and caused the entire stadium to quake.As the clouds of dust settled, people saw its tail helplessly slumped over the edge of the crater, while its body was further below.For a moment, the stadium stayed deathly quiet.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: An Uncrowned KingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87: An Uncrowned KingThe Thunder Basilisk lost the match!At this very moment, the once majestic creature had collapsed inside the pit in an extremely unpleasant way. Most of its scales had cracked up and blood came out from all over its body. It didn\u2019t move at all; it was probably unconscious.Nobody made a sound because they couldn\u2019t accept the sight before their eyes. Their previous belief was that a seventh-rank Thunder Basilisk making a debut in the academy\u2019s tournament was illegitimate by itself, because it would squash all the other pets with ease. In the end, another pet had been against such an outcome. A Lightning Rat, who had recently lost a match against the basilisk, at that.How in the world did the Thunder Basilisk lose after it just broke through to another rank?The owners of the combating pets\u2014Ye Hao and Su Yanying\u2014were both left awestruck on the stage. The match ended too quickly and they didn\u2019t have nearly enough time to take in everything yet.Through their \u201cconnection,\u201d Ye Hao knew that his Thunder Basilisk had fainted. Obviously, his seventh-rank dragon-type Astral Pet had been knocked senseless. Obviously.How come?HOW COME??Ye Hao madly repeated the question in his mind.Similarly, Su Yanying found it too difficult to accept reality. She should be glad that his Lightning Rat turned out to be the winner. Still, she didn\u2019t feel the joy of it at all. She wasn\u2019t the one fighting the match.Fizz, fizz!The Lightning Rat emerged from the crater with two swift leaps and happily toddled her way.At this moment, Su Yanying remembered that she had to do something about her frozen legs, or she would lose them if her muscles were damaged. Quickly, she channeled some astral power to thaw herself out.Crack.She heard another cracking noise and saw Su Ping doing the same, although he seemed rather relaxed for some reason. The ice on his legs came off as he took a step forward, just like that.Su Yanying found her mind bloated with too much confusion. That was a skill from a seventh-rank Thunder Basilisk. He broke out of it like it was nothing?The settler guests were the first ones to recover from the unbelievable display, though they didn\u2019t look any less surprised. They could see that both pets were using their full strength back there, which meant the Thunder Basilisk would have emerged victorious if nothing went wrong.Well, something went very wrong indeed.They had witnessed how irregularly strong the Lightning Rat was during the previous matches. Nevertheless, there should be a limit to the creature\u2019s true potential. People thought they had seen the creature\u2019s \u201ccap\u201d when it lost against the Thunder Basilisk the other day.And it wasn\u2019t a feeling of disappointment. On the contrary, they still considered the Lightning Rat to be an exceptional miracle.That day, however, they might need to review that idea.\u201cThat rat is fighting a little bit... differently, I think,\u201d a settler commented with a serious look.His partner nodded. \u201cAgreed. The skills are the same, except for the Thunder Rush. But it suddenly learned how to make better use of them to gain the upper hand, especially at the end. Thunder Rush is a supportive skill used for moving faster. Yet it somehow used its power to knock the basilisk off the sky. Such creativity.\u201d\u201cIt reminds me of all those veteran Astral Pets who have gone through many battles during barren land expeditions. Fast, accurate and deadly. But experience alone can\u2019t help it counter the Leer skill. How did it manage to do so?\u201d\u201cThe Lightning Rat\u2019s strength didn\u2019t change. The tactics were different. If I\u2019m not mistaken, Su Yanying wasn\u2019t the one issuing commands during the match.\u201dIt was a woman talking this time, who attracted everyone\u2019s attention with those words.\u201cTake a closer look at the young man next to her. Both of them were affected by the Thunder Basilisk\u2019s Frigid Brine, yet he already freed himself, while Su Yanying is still trying, as you can see.\u201d The woman threw Su Ping an inquisitive look.She didn\u2019t show it, but she was very startled to see someone walk out of the ice trap as if he were shaking off some insignificant cobwebs. Even though they weren\u2019t the main targets of the Thunder Basilisk, what Su Ping did hinted at his extremely rich astral power reserves. Probably of the fifth rank or higher. With that kind of age, he was undoubtedly more talented than Ye Hao.\u201cI see...\u201d The other settlers saw the same thing and all agreed.\u201cSo, that young man is not from someone\u2019s family, but Su Yanying\u2019s helper?\u201d\u201cTsk. He looks even younger than Miss Su. By the way, Mister Vice Principal, which class is he from?\u201dDong Mingsong frowned in confusion. \u201cI... don\u2019t remember. Is he from this academy at all?\u201dAs the vice president, he knew every outstanding student in this institution. Yet he couldn\u2019t remember seeing that young man. Could that be a student who always stayed low among people?That was good news though. There would be another brilliant genius under his watch.\u201cWho\u2019s his professor anyway?\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cI\u2019m going to remove his bonus for failing his job...\u201dOn the stage, the judge made sure that the Thunder Basilisk wasn\u2019t moving any longer and gladly announced the winner of the match.It took some time for the audience to start applauding, which lasted a long time until the loud cheers could be heard miles away from the stadium.That night, the famous Lightning Rat had put up another wonderful performance no one was expecting. None of the common spectators clearly saw how the rat had beaten the Thunder Basilisk, although that wouldn\u2019t change their opinions regarding the awesome creature.Dazzling fireworks marked the end of the festivities.The wounded Thunder Basilisk and Ye Hao were gradually forgotten over the course of the celebration. The result of the exhibition match did nothing to affect his championship or his award money, yet people were not going to see him as an actual champion, that much was certain.To make it worse, he did tell his basilisk to go all-out. Nobody would believe him if he were to say that he was going easy on the Lightning Rat because it was supposed to be an \u201cexhibition.\u201d\u201cBrother...\u201d Ye Qingyin gave her brother a worried look.The yelling crowds, the beautiful light shows and the joyful atmosphere had made Ye Hao\u2019s lonesome figure look even more miserable. Ye Qingyin had always respected her brother since her childhood. Seeing him like this, she felt overrun by unbearable sadness.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: Special Admission?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88: Special Admission?\u201cSomeone wants to see us?\u201dSu Yanying and Su Ping had yet to get off the stage when a manager of the academy walked over and invited them to the office building, saying that an important man was expecting them.Su Yanying more or less knew who this \u201cimportant man\u201d was, since she had met him many times when her Lightning Rat made its name. And she felt excited to find out what kind of commendation she\u2019d get after her rat\u2019s brilliant performance.She had only spent 10,000 astral coins at Su Ping\u2019s shop to train her pet, which rewarded her greatly by instant-defeating a seventh-rank Thunder Basilisk. Whenever she thought about this, she couldn\u2019t help but feel grateful.Then she was terrified when she saw Su Ping already seated while helping himself with some hot tea.This was the Vice Principal\u2019s office!Su Yangying felt it hard to stand properly while waiting for the Vice Principal as it was. And yet, Su Ping was already making himself at home.\u201cGet\u2014get\u2014get up from there,\u201d She quickly urged. She wouldn\u2019t want Su Ping to leave a bad first impression.Su Ping was looking in another direction while checking the painting of a Purple-tailed Divine Phoenix on the wall. Just like the statue at the academy\u2019s gate, this one also seemed to be the work of a master. Only... the phoenix didn\u2019t look as awesome. It was only a Beast King, after all.\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Ping heard the warning and slowly stood up, for he thought Su Yanying was calling him.\u201cThe Vice Principal will be here soon. You don\u2019t want him to see you like that!\u201dSu Ping sat down again. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? Someone asked me to come, only to keep me waiting. It\u2019s not like I need to ask for any favors. You know what? I\u2019ll just leave if he doesn\u2019t show up soon.\u201dSu Yanying decided not to argue because it made sense. Besides, the Vice Principal was probably asking for her. He didn\u2019t know who Su Ping was or care how he behaved.\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d Su Ping said as he pricked up his ears.At the same time, Su Yanying heard footsteps approaching and her heart skipped a beat; she quickly straightened herself at a seemingly proper spot beside the sofa.The door of the office was pushed open, but no one came in. It seemed that whoever had just arrived was taking his time to check what was going on in the room.\u201cMi\u2014Mister Vice Principal, sir!\u201d Su Yanying quickly uttered upon seeing not one, but several mighty figures outside, which only doubled her mental pressure. As someone who had recently gone through a lot in the academy, she managed to show her good manners by smiling politely.An old man walking in front of the group nodded back with a kind smile and searched for the other \u201cguest\u201d in the office, only to see Su Ping\u2019s head partially hidden behind the back of the sofa.He wondered how Su Ping would react if he, as an elder, gave him a kind reminder to not slack off like that when someone important was present.\u201cAhem. Welcome, Mister...?\u201dBy doing this, Dong Mingsong meant to both announce his arrival and tell his assistant to leave.Su Ping stood up so he didn\u2019t appear too ill-mannered. He was a little surprised to see a total of seven people waiting behind the old man. Every one of them more or less had battle scars somewhere on their bodies. One of them even had the tip of his nose cut off, which gave him a horrid skeleton-like appearance. This man would surely scare kids out of their minds, that much was certain.\u201cGreetings.\u201d Su Ping nodded slightly.The simple response puzzled the visitors. This probably meant that Su Ping didn\u2019t recognize the Vice Principal.But how?They realized that the young man they were looking at was not a student of the academy.Dong Mingsong thought about the same thing and felt his mood drop. \u201cAre you a student here, my boy?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Su Ping shook his head.The other visitors quickly made up their own plans.Meanwhile, Dong Mingsong felt greatly disappointed since he no longer held the right to decide which team could accept Su Ping. Su Ping\u2019s presence meant nothing to the academy as things stood.A woman with red hair spoke up, \u201cJudging from your age, you\u2019re a first-grader, am I right? Which school are you studying in?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not currently receiving any teaching.\u201d\u201cYou... what?\u201dAs they previously discussed, this young man could be a better talent than Ye Hao. Someone like this had no proper education?Dong Mingsong\u2019s eyes glimmered. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name, young man? Are you perhaps interested in coming here? I can grant you free tuition, living expenses, an independent dorm and even an advanced Astral Pet pup upon your graduation. Or even an adult one, if you have good scores. What do you say? If you say yes, I can finish up the registration today so you can start your lessons tomorrow!\u201dDong Mingsong spoke too fast, never giving the others the chance to say otherwise. Right then, they could only throw their hateful glares at the old man\u2019s back.Meanwhile, Su Yanying listened with a look of disbelief.The Vice Principal is inviting Su Ping to the academy? Free of charge? A good pet as a gift? Why have I never heard of any of this before??Reduced tuition was a commonly-seen welfare usually provided to brilliant students. But not even the top scorer could simply get an advanced pet for free!Su Yanying started to wonder if the old president was in his right mind that day.Besides, she should be the one under the spotlight. Why was everybody looking at Su Ping instead? Did they already find out that Su Ping was the trainer of the Lightning Rat?On the other hand, Su Ping was rather discontented by the offer. Luo Guxue had already invited him to become an honorary professor in the academy, yet this old man had offered him a lower spot.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but no.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Countless people would pay with their lives to be admitted. The Vice Principal directly invited Su Ping and provided many bonuses, but he actually refused? And he didn\u2019t hesitate in the least!\u201cYou... think again, please,\u201d Dong Mingsong tried.Su Ping shook his head. He did consider accepting Luo Guxue\u2019s suggestion, though he had yet to reach a solid decision. As for becoming a student? Definitely not.Dong Mingsong\u2019s eyelids twitched at the absurd playout of events. Not even Ye Hao, the top ranker in the academy, enjoyed such privileges. He had already gone over the line by presenting those generous offers; he might have needed to talk with the president later to seek approval later, otherwise, he\u2019d be paying the expenses himself.He never thought his offer would be rejected like this.A bulky man stepped ahead. \u201cAll right, Mister Vice Principal, you shouldn\u2019t force the guy since he said no. As far as I can see, an outstanding young man like this already has a dependable teacher. He doesn\u2019t need the academy. Heck, what he did back there was better than what your best graduate can do.\u201dDong Mingsong knew he didn\u2019t have a say on this so he stepped aside.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name, my friend?\u201d the big man asked directly.\u201cHow about you go first?\u201d\u201cHA! You\u2019re funny. The name\u2019s Fang Baili. As in the fang of ferocious beasts!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Su Ping. Though my life is hardly peaceful1.\u201dFang Baili bellowed with laughter. \u201cI like you, man.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t say the same. I\u2019m not interested in dudes.\u201dFang Baili choked on his laughter and stared at Su Ping.The others chuckled upon seeing their companion getting stumped like this.The red-haired woman spoke again, \u201cBaili, dear, you already have Su Yanying on your side, how about leaving Su Ping to us? Mister Su, I\u2019m Ji Rongying. Or just call me Ying for short. I represent a Class A settler team working for the base city. By joining us, you\u2019ll receive\u2014\u201dAnother young man beside her didn\u2019t let her finish. \u201cChill out already. We\u2019re all Class A teams, aren\u2019t we? Besides, your team focuses on missions in Class A barren areas where six out of ten advanced battle pet warriors return in body bags. Are you seriously telling Mister Su to go to that kind of place, huh? Come on. My team is the best for settler recruits as we have multiple bases established around Class B areas. If you want safer jobs, Mister Su, we can train you in Class C areas as well. There will be teammates protecting you. I don\u2019t know about anything else, but we can make sure you stay alive while exploring.\u201d\u201cCan you now?\u201d Another middle-aged settler smirked. \u201cIf someone tells you about being absolutely safe in the barrens, you\u2019re talking either to a legendary battle pet warrior who can kick Beast Kings\u2019 as**s, or an amateur who doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. I mean, we all know that Beast Kings sometimes show up in Class C areas. How can you fully protect anyone?\u201d\u201cNonsense! How often do you run into Beast Kings in a Class C barren land? Once in several decades? And there are so many Class C areas out there. If you\u2019re afraid of that kind of stuff, you might as well stay home for the rest of your life!\u201d\u201cNothing is impossible. Besides, my team can do all that too.\u201d The middle-aged man threw Su Ping a friendly look. \u201cIf you join us, Mister Su, you get an advanced demon-type Astral Pet trained to its adulthood. You don\u2019t let another man protect you, you take care of yourself! Capiche?\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t have the chance to speak as yet another settler was already chipping in. \u201cHumph! You made it as if that\u2019s something rare. Demon-type pets come in a large variety, including strong ones and squishy ones. I would step back if you promised, like, a dragon-type pet instead. That would guarantee a useful result.\u201d\u201cYou talk as if you can afford one!\u201d\u201cOf course we can. If Mister Su comes with me, I\u2019ll raise enough funds to get him a dragon-type pet within a year.\u201d\u201cA year, huh? So he works for you for a year before getting paid. What a smart plan you got there!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better than your stupid demon anyway!\u201dThe settlers started arguing without letting Su Ping speak at all.Su Yanying felt more and more defeated after hearing all those insane offers presented to Su Ping. She didn\u2019t get to enjoy these things by joining Fang Baili\u2019s team. An adult demon-type? That would cost at least millions! Even more, if it had good potential!She began to wonder whether she had made the right choice.Several days earlier, Fang Baili invited her to a caf\u00e9 to talk over their future plans, during which she was too excited to decline any of the man\u2019s conditions. She thought it was glorious enough to be chosen by a first-class settler team. There was no point in bargaining.\u201cHey, hey, guys.\u201d Su Ping tried making himself heard among the quarreling folks. \u201cIt\u2019s good and all, but you know, I\u2019ve never intended to become a settler.\u201dThe heated discussion was instantly silenced.\u201cYou, you don\u2019t?\u201d Fang Baili stuttered. \u201cEven with that kind of skill??\u201dSu Ping\u2019s response just reminded them of something they already had in mind. There was probably someone way more powerful acting as Su Ping\u2019s backup. He didn\u2019t need to risk his life gaining fortune and fame as a settler at all.\u201cI\u2019m just not interested in this line of work. Sorry.\u201dIf it was for improving himself, he could simply use cultivation planes without worrying about dying for real. If it was for money, he had his shop to help with that. All the recent income was enough to sustain his life, unless he needed a larger budget to buy a powerful pet.And even if he did need a powerful pet, he could use the Incubation Pool in his shop and perhaps produce a Beast King if he was lucky. He had no reason to join dangerous expeditions with settlers when he could play it safe at home.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Aren\u2019t you interested?\u201dThose people frowned with clouds over their faces. They had been arguing there for such a long time and it turned out that Su Ping claimed he had no interest. This was an opportunity that many so-called talents could never get in their lives and Su Ping had just turned it down.Sitting on the couch, Dong Mingsong wore a strange look. He was having a deja vu kind of feeling. It was like the same thing that had happened just moments before...Su Yanying didn\u2019t know what words to use to describe her feelings right then. Su Ping had turned down the Vice Principal\u2019s offer and had just refused the invitations of so many top-tier explorers\u2019 teams.He wasn\u2019t interested in becoming a student nor an explorer. What was his interest?Besides, Su Yanying didn\u2019t understand what the explorers\u2019 teams and the Vice Principal saw in Su Ping. The Lightning Rat had been trained in Su Ping\u2019s store. However, it was evident that the one training the Lightning Rat was the mysterious master trainer working for his store. It had nothing to do with Su Ping, who didn\u2019t train the Lightning Rat. It was unlikely that a master trainer could be this young. Could it be that those people were trying to approach that master by forging a relationship with Su Ping?Wasn\u2019t that too much of a trouble?While Su Yanying\u2019s thoughts were floating about, Su Ping gave his answer, \u201cI am sorry. Please go and find someone else.\u201dEveryone looked at each other speechlessly as Su Ping claimed his refusal again. They were all frustrated. They had fought against each other for such a long time, but it was merely their wishful thinking. Su Ping had no desire to join them at all.Since Su Ping had demonstrated his resolution, those people could only stop trying to persuade him. Besides, they were having some worries. Su Ping was young but he could escape from Frigid Brine. No matter how talented he might be, he couldn\u2019t have learned this by himself. There had to be a powerful backer. Therefore, none of them were willing to risk offending such a connection.\u201cFine.\u201d Feng Baili sighed. Regret was written all over his face.Ji Rongying stepped forward and handed Su Ping a card. \u201cHere\u2019s my contact information. You may not need this now but in the future, if you\u2019re interested, you can contact me then. Our team will always welcome you.\u201dWhat Ji Rongying did reminded the others. They offered their contact information as well.Su Ping accepted all their cards and said, \u201cI will take my leave if you don\u2019t have any other matters.\u201dEveryone smiled a bitter smile and let Su Ping go.When he was about to step out of the office, Su Ping had an idea. He turned to Dong Mingsong and said, \u201cYou are the Vice Principal, right? Can you please do me a favor?\u201d\u201cEh?\u201d Dong Mingsong did not expect that Su Ping would talk to him all of a sudden. A second of surprise later, Dong Mingsong asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d His eyes were glowing. Su Ping had asked him for a favor. The former would then owe the latter.Su Ping went on, \u201cPromote my pet store in the academy. Tell students that the Lightning Rat was trained at my place. Students that want to have their pets trained can come to my pet store.\u201dBy luck, he had met the Vice Principal. This was the best advertisement opportunity, better than what the two minions under Su Yanying and Lan Lele could do.Su Yanying was taken aback by Su Ping\u2019s words. This man had cast his eyes at the Vice Principal? The Vice-Principal of a famous school, he was the professor and an eighth-rank battle pet warrior. The Vice Principal enjoyed fame and prestige in the entire Longjiang Base City. How could he help with advertising?Dong Mingsong was surprised as well. He didn\u2019t expect those words from Su Ping. What shocked him more was that, based on Su Ping\u2019s words, he ran a pet store and that genius Lightning Rat had been trained there.The explorers were just as baffled. Young as Su Ping was, he was the owner of a pet store? Was this a family business? Was that Lightning Rat honestly trained in his pet store?Feng Baili thought of something. He turned to Su Yanying and asked, \u201cWhat was the strength of your Lightning Rat like before it was trained?\u201dSu Yanying became nervous as he asked this question. She knew that Feng Baili valued her mainly because of her genius Lightning Rat. Being its master, she had some credit.However, she was well aware that she had done nothing. Before she handed the Lightning Rat to Su Ping\u2019s pet store, the Lightning Rat was just an average, low-rank Lightning Rat. But later on, the Lightning Rat had become a formidable being that had defeated a seventh-rank pet of the dragon family.\u201cIntermediate position of the first rank.\u201d Hesitating, Su Yanying said the truth. Lying would not get her anywhere. Given the connections and powers the explorers had, they could find out about the truth easily. Besides... she was eager to know if her strength would be recognized by them without the credit of training the Lightning Rat.\u201cMiddle position of the first rank...\u201dEveryone was surprised, which was followed by silence.It was a rank common amongst average Lightning Rats. To train a Lightning Rat of the first rank into something that could defeat the seventh-rank pet of the dragon family... that wasn\u2019t merely outstanding. It was unbelievable!Not even a master trainer they knew could have achieved this!They considered that the very best master trainers on this planet were incapable of this!\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Feng Baili asked, being more serious than ever as he gazed at Su Yanying.Su Yanying answered, \u201cYes, I am.\u201dA ray of light glistened in Feng Baili\u2019s eyes. He said to Su Ping, \u201cWell, now I have to call you Mr. Su. I wonder where your pet store is. I want to pay a visit.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Su Ping took out the name cards he had prepared and handed them out.Everyone took a name card and looked at the address. It wasn\u2019t far away. This wasn\u2019t a store at a prime location and the name was mundane. They had never heard of it.\u201cI\u2019ll be going now,\u201d Su Ping said after he distributed all the name cards. He could tell from their eyes that those people would pay a visit and might become key customers. He could make a fortune.Dong Mingsong came back to his senses. He said at once, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I will promote your store for you,\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d Su Ping took off after he expressed his gratitude.The others saw him out and left as well. They had gone there for Su Ping. Since he had left, there was no need for them to stay in the office. As for Su Yanying, she had signed a contract with Feng Baili. As far as the other explorers were concerned, she was one of them already and further talk with her was unnecessary.Everyone walked out of the corridor with Su Ping. Along the way, they would meet some teachers from this academy. The teachers would greet the Vice Principal and the explorers as they crossed paths.Once they arrived at the first floor of the office building, two people headed toward them. Su Ping knew one of them. It was Luo Guxue. With her was another middle-aged teacher, and they were discussing something.Sensing a huge crowd\u2019s presence, Luo Guxue and the middle-aged teacher threw a glance. Luo Guxue looked up, and this one glance surprised her. She had to check carefully to make sure that she did recognize this young man.\u201cYou are here.\u201d Luo Guxue hurried over. Her voice was filled with pleasant surprise.Su Ping nodded. \u201cI came to watch the exhibition matches.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: AcceptancePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 91: Acceptance\u201cExhibition match?\u201d Luo Guxue had just returned from the barren area. Su Ping\u2019s answer reminded her that such an event had taken place that day. The feeling of satisfaction triggered by their encounter quickly vanished. She was disappointed. She had thought that Su Ping had accepted her invitation to become a teacher. After all, the Vice Principal was there to see him out in person, and they were talking happily.At the same time, she was confused. Usually, no outsiders were invited to the exhibition match. Only students and their families could participate. What is Su Ping doing here?Dong Mingsong asked with surprise, \u201cMrs. Luo, do you know him?\u201dLuo Guxue came back to her senses and nodded. \u201cMr. Su saved my life. Thanks to Mr. Su timely rescue I was able to come back from the barren area.\u201d\u201cThe uncultivated area?\u201d Dong Mingsong was baffled and so were the others including Feng Baili. They looked at each other and then cast their glances at Su Ping. This guy had visited the barren area? What did it mean when Luo Guxue said he went to her rescue?They weren\u2019t familiar with Luo Guxue. That being said, Luo Guxue was the main member of Team Polaris, and they knew each other. If Luo Guxue, who was at the intermediate position of the seventh-rank, was in danger, then only a battle pet warrior at the peak of the seventh-rank or the eighth-rank could have helped her. How could Su Ping save her?\u201cTell me. What is that about?\u201d Dong Mingsong asked, curious.The others darted glances of curiosity at her as well.For all this time, Luo Guxue had been grateful to Su Ping for this matter. She told them about how they had been attacked by the Magical Corpse Beast. At the end of the story, she expressed her gratitude to Su Ping once more. \u201cMr. Su, I will gladly repay your kind help. You can come to me for anything you may need me for.\u201dSu Ping was speechless. He could have made a quick escape; he just wanted to go back home. However, when Luo Guxue told the story, he couldn\u2019t just cut her off. Being under the heated and shocked gazes of those present, he felt he was a gorilla of a rare kind. He said with a bitter smile, \u201cWell, you guys go on. When you\u2019re free, come to my store but please remember to take enough money with you.\u201dThe others came back to their senses but they were still stunned. Su Ping, who was most likely around the age of 20, could defeat a Magical Corpse Beast. Really? Not to mention that the Magical Corpse Beast was one that had learned ninth-rank pet skills.Didn\u2019t this practically imply that Su Ping was not weaker than them?They didn\u2019t doubt Luo Guxue\u2019s words. After all, she had her pride and fame. She didn\u2019t need to make up a story and lie to them. Simply put, this matter was astonishing, and unimaginably queer. Su Ping had the age of a student. It was rare to achieve what Ye Hao and Su Yanying had accomplished at this age. If everything went on smoothly, in the future, those two could become advanced battle pet warriors; even becoming eighth-rank master battle pet warriors would be possible!However, Su Ping had already reached that level when he was about their age. If Ye Hao was called a talent, then what was Su Ping? A freak?While everyone was still numbed by shock, Su Yanying fixed her eyes on Su Ping. She couldn\u2019t reconcile the image of this young store owner who idled away in his store all day long with that powerful warrior, one that could kill a Magical Corpse Beast at the upper position of the eighth-rank. Su Yanying knew that Su Ping was mysterious and most likely there was a master trainer in his pet store. She was willing to believe when someone told her that he was a talent. That being said, with the strength to kill a Magical Corpse Beast of the upper position of the eighth-rank... he was more than a talent. He was a mature, powerful warrior that could take charge by himself!To become such a strong man, in addition to talent, their efforts were also extremely important. Yet, the way Su Yanying saw Su Ping was that it seemed he just squandered time at the store, single-mindedly trying to make money.How could someone like him be this strong?Noticing that Su Ping was about to leave, Luo Guxue said in a hurry, \u201cMr. Su, last time, I mentioned about you coming here as a teacher. What do you think?\u201dSu Ping answered, \u201cWell, I\u2019m still thinking.\u201dDong Mingsong was stunned. Luo Guxue had invited Su Ping to come as a teacher. Given Luo Guxue\u2019s identity as an advanced teacher, she did have such a right. Dong Mingsong blushed as he remembered how he had invited Su Ping to become a student. Su Ping was someone that could kill an eighth-rank monster. If he were a student there, who would have the right to mentor him?Secretly, he gave Luo Guxue a look of praise. She acted fast, a true testament that he was the one who trained her.\u201cMr. Su, I\u2019m sorry if I have offended you.\u201d Dong Mingsong put on a smile at once to help Luo Guxue. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you were so brave and heroic. We have been wrong about your strength. Please forgive us. Mr. Su, if you\u2019re interested in becoming one of our teachers, I\u2019m more than happy to see that happen. Given your strength, you can become an advanced teacher in this academy, just like Mrs. Luo. I will make sure that the treatment is to your satisfaction.\u201d\u201cHonestly?\u201d Su Ping was intrigued. He had been hesitating about this offer. So, he questioned, \u201cWhat are the benefits?\u201dDong Mingsong smiled. He had seen this young man through. He was just a punk that would be bent solely on profit. Talking business with a guy like this was easy as long as the benefits were enough. Someone self-conceited and insolent on account of talent would be troublesome to deal with considering personal quirks.\u201cOh, there are quite many benefits. For example, the advanced training method for astral power in the collection of the academy, some advanced battle pet skills, and some potions with special effects. Besides, you will be qualified to join some of the auctions. The items sold at those auctions aren\u2019t even found at the explorer\u2019s warehouses. There\u2019s no harm to have a few more identities,\u201d Dong Mingsong persuaded Su Ping with a kind smile.After hearing this, Su Ping became interested. He had to admit that Dong Mingsong had gone straight to the point, as if he clearly knew what he desired.Su Ping asked, \u201cWhat do you need me to do?\u201dThis was kind of a silly question. However, since Su Ping had put forward this question, there had to be a specific meaning. Dong Mingsong picked up the cue at once. \u201cAn advanced teacher has an easy job. You don\u2019t have to go to class to give lectures every day. You can just teach one class per week. The rest of the time will be up to you. It\u2019s very free. You can tell this from how Mrs. Luo handles herself. She is invested in exploring uncultivated lands. That should be regarded as her main responsibility.\u201dLuo Guxue forced a smile and said, \u201cVice Principal, don\u2019t make fun of me.\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t know that the job would be this easy. He thought about it and nodded. \u201cI see no problem, then.\u201dDong Mingsong was overjoyed. \u201cGood. I will prepare the contract for you right away. From now on, Mr. Su, you will be an advanced teacher in our academy.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: Revealing the TruthPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92: Revealing the TruthFeng Baili and the others standing by the side were speechless. Inside, they called Dong Mingsong an old fox. What was done couldn\u2019t be undone. Nothing they could say could change that fact. They were jealous of how fortunate Dong Mingsong was. Given Su Ping\u2019s talents and abilities, his future achievements would be unlimited, provided he didn\u2019t die an early death. It was most likely that he could become a titled battle pet warrior. By then, the academy could boast about how they had a teacher with titles giving lectures there.This alone could enable the Phoenix Peak Academy to rise by one or two ranks amongst the seven famous schools in the Base City. This was a long-term plan.Luo Guxue was happy since Su Ping had agreed. This way, she and Su Ping would be coworkers and she could meet him in the future.Su Yanying had become numb to this shocking news.The information revealed by Su Ping was increasingly surprising. She had become immune to this. He had the strength to kill monsters of the eighth-rank, which made him more than capable to be an advanced teacher. She just didn\u2019t expect that Su Ping, who she had been dealing with as her equal, had become her teacher, and of the most advanced level no less. Ye Hao and the other students would be boiling with anger once they learned of this.After all, Su Ping was too young. It would be logical for him to be a junior fellow student.But now, he was going to teach her...Su Yanying\u2019s mouth twitched at the thought. All of a sudden, she felt lucky that she was in grade three and about to graduate. Otherwise, if she would have to face such a young teacher every day; with such a daily reminder, all her confidence would be lost.Feng Baili and the others bade farewell since they had nothing else to do there. He was once again invited by Dong Mingsong; Su Ping returned to his office with Luo Guxue with Su Yanying following them silently.They sat down on the sofa. With quite the zeal, Dong Mingsong poured Su Ping a cup of tea and then handed him the contract his assistant had printed out.Su Ping could feel Dong Mingsong\u2019s passion and sincerity. After a careful read of the contract and without finding any issues, Su Ping signed it.Dong Mingsong put away the contract and said with a smile, \u201cMr. Su, you can begin your lessons next week.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Su Ping nodded.Dong Mingsong went on, \u201cI will have someone register your information at once. But it will be a few days before you can have your ID.\u201dSu Ping was in no rush. He had another question, \u201cWhen and where can I have a look at the advanced cultivation methods and skills for battle pet warriors?\u201d\u201cIn the academy\u2019s second library.\u201d Dong Mingsong continued, smiling, \u201cYou can go there at any time, even right now. But since you don\u2019t have your teacher\u2019s ID yet, if you want to go, I will let those in charge know you\u2019ll go there.\u201dIt was getting darker. Su Ping didn\u2019t wish to visit at the moment. There was cultivation and other things he had to do. He could wait for a couple more days.After they exchanged some pleasantries, Su Ping left the building. Not long afterward, he had reached the stadium. From the distance, he could already see the glaring and flickering colorful lights above the stadium. The paths on the campus were crowded with students. The matches had come to an end. People were exiting the stadium at the moment, therefore, every corner of the campus was filled with students.Su Yanying followed him. She looked up at Su Ping from behind and asked, \u201cDo you want to go to the stadium to advertise some more?\u201dSu Ping shook his head. \u201cNo. The Vice Principal\u2019s promotion is enough for me.\u201dHe was worried about being potentially unable to find enough time for training pets, if too many students approached him. After all, he was just one person. There was no one to help him. The only thing he could do was to train several pets at the same time but that would be too much pressure on his spirit.Su Yanying walked Su Ping out of the campus. After Su Ping left, Su Yanying turned around quietly. However, her mind was unable to settle down.It was late. Su Ping called a taxi and went home directly. He didn\u2019t want to bother going back to the store. There wasn\u2019t much of a business at the moment. No promotion could generate an effect that quickly.He got out of the taxi and went inside. His mother was watching TV in the living room. That arrogant sister of his was nowhere to be seen. Most likely she was still at school. Li Qingru was surprised by Su Ping\u2019s early return. Li Qingru asked nervously, \u201cHow come you\u2019re home so early? Has anything happened to the store?\u201d\u201cNo. I went to watch her match, then I came back directly from her school,\u201d Su Ping answered. The truth would be revealed when his sister returned anyways.\u201cYou went to see your sister\u2019s match?\u201d Li Qingru was taken aback. She didn\u2019t think that Su Ping would care about this. Usually, he wouldn\u2019t go even if she asked.Su Ping felt embarrassed, \u201cWhat\u2019s with your tone?\u201dLi Qingru rolled her eyes at him grumpily and posed another question, \u201cWhy did you come back alone? Where\u2019s your sister?\u201dSu Ping found an excuse, \u201cShe wanted to hang out for a bit longer.\u201d\u201cYou two...\u201d Li Qingru was speechless. \u201cAre you hungry? If not, wait for your sister to come back.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Su Ping agreed. He was just about to go upstairs when he sensed that presence. Su Ping raised his eyebrows. He walked back from the staircase and then went to the living room to sit down. He began to watch TV with keen pleasure.The door was opened. It was Su Lingyue that stepped in. Her eyes opened wide the moment she saw Su Ping sitting on the couch. \u201cWhy are you here? Did you come directly from the school?\u201d\u201cWhat? Should I have taken a detour?\u201dSu Lingyue scolded him, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to the store?\u201dSu Ping was surprised. \u201cHow did you know I wasn\u2019t there?\u201d\u201cBecause I waited for you there for a long time!\u201d said Su Lingyue, fuming with rage. Her exhibition match had ended long before. After the conclusion of the exhibition match between the third year\u2019s first and second place, she wanted to find Su Ping at once to ask him about everything. However, Su Ping had been dragged away by the school leaders with Su Yanying. She couldn\u2019t find a chance to search for Su Ping so she had to leave school by herself. She called a taxi and headed to the store. She thought that since it was only after seven once the matches were over, Su Ping would have to go back to the store. There were some matters Su Lingyue wished to discuss with him in private. At home, their mom would be able to hear their conversation.Only, she waited there for two hours.She saw it was late and went home, only to see Su Ping was already there.\u201cYou waited for me?\u201d Su Ping asked while knowing the answer. He added with confusion on his face, \u201cWhy were you waiting for me?\u201dSu Lingyue ground her teeth with hatred. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cHow should I know?\u201dSu Lingyue stared at him. \u201cDo you have astral power?\u201dThere was no concealing the truth. So, Su Ping nodded and admitted it readily.\u201cReally?\u201d Su Lingyue\u2019s pupils contracted. She only realized this possibility when she saw how Su Ping was the first to be freed from the Frigid Brine. The likelihood of someone awakening later in life was slim but there would always be someone lucky and favored by heaven. It was just that God had been too blind and blessed her despicable brother by mistake.Li Qingru was startled. She could not help but ask, \u201cWhat did you just say? Do you have astral power? You, have you awakened?\u201d Filled with nervousness and excitement, Li Qingru was shivering. Even though the achievement that came with acquired awakening was limited, he was a battle pet warrior nonetheless. He could support himself no matter how lousy his life may turn out to be.Su Ping scratched his head. \u201cIt was by accident. It has been some time.\u201dSu Lingyue squinted her eyes. He had awakened some time before. So, did this guy play dumb all this time? Was he showing weakness to endure hardships so that he could accomplish some ambition?\u201cGood, this is good.\u201d Li Qingru was so happy that her eyes reddened. She was shedding tears. She wiped her tears away quickly and said, \u201cWe have to tell your father about this piece of good news. Anyways, do you have a pet? You have awakened too late in life. You must buy a quality pet. I will go to the market myself tomorrow to pick a pet for you, one with good quality and power of understanding!\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: Playing with FirePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: Playing with FireSu Ping was once again touched by his mother\u2019s kindness. He smiled. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t make long walks, mom, leave it to me. I have a pet anyway. We run a pet shop, remember? I can switch to a new one each day if I want.\u201dLi Qingru chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding. What kind of pet warrior uses different pets everyday? What is your current pet? The shop doesn\u2019t have any good ones in stock.\u201dSu Lingyue also pricked up her ears to listen. Since Su Ping had become a battle pet warrior, he was slowly catching up to her. She preferred to stay cautious, to prevent her miserable childhood from repeating.\u201cIt\u2019s an Undead-type. Decent aptitude, I\u2019d say. Just a little below average.\u201d\u201cUndead?\u201d Li Qingru looked surprised, because not many people liked their horrible looks, even though they usually fought pretty well. \u201cWhat exactly is it?\u201dSu Lingyue thought that his brother had developed a fondness for this kind of creature due to her constant \u201chorror pranks.\u201d This guy had even blown a kiss to a ghost the other day, giving her the creeps instead.Sh*t. Maybe I should use different ways to spook him each day, she thought. I can\u2019t let him catch some odd fetish.\u201cIt\u2019s a small skeleton.\u201d Su Ping had no choice but to say something under Li Qingru\u2019s demand.\u201cA skeleton??\u201d Li Qingru almost cried again. \u201cOh dear... You really should have told your mom earlier, about your awakening. I\u2019d get you a better pet even if I need to get a loan. You can\u2019t be a pet warrior using a skeleton!\u201dSu Lingyue felt her earlier anxiety gone all of a sudden. \u201cHey, mom, he can\u2019t use a better pet at his current state anyway. You don\u2019t find many advanced battle pet warriors out of late awakeners. If you ask me, I\u2019d just let him find a random job at the guild. He\u2019ll earn more money than common salarymen that way. He can\u2019t get us any income at the shop anyway.\u201dLi Qingru didn\u2019t look happy to hear that. \u201cYou can\u2019t say that to your brother until he tries! Yes, it\u2019s rare for such cases to be good. But awakening later in life is already a miracle! You know what? If you only consider late awakeners, they break through faster than normal awakeners!\u201dSu Lingyue couldn\u2019t keep arguing; sulking was her only choice.Li Qingru continued, \u201cYour brother has earned such a great opportunity. We shouldn\u2019t discourage him from it. Come, you should help him too.\u201dSu Lingyue didn\u2019t answer.Su Ping knew his mother cared about him, but not to such an extent. Their family wasn\u2019t really rich. It would be for the best if they pooled all their resources on Su Lingyue, so they could aim at making her an advanced battle pet warrior.It was clear that Li Qingru chose to be a better mother rather than a strategist.\u201cSis is right, mom,\u201d Su Ping spoke in a gentle voice, \u201cDon\u2019t waste money on me. We need it to treat your leg! Besides, I like my pet. I don\u2019t want another anyway.\u201dSu Lingyue raised an eyebrow at that. She thought Su Ping would use this chance to blatantly request a good pet like her Phantom Flame Beast, since that was always how he acted since childhood. She didn\u2019t expect him to be so considerate all of a sudden.Either way, she found it necessary to judge his brother differently at this point.She removed her unpleasant look and spoke to their mother, \u201cIf we must, find him a middle-rank one, mom. We\u2019d be lucky if he becomes a middle-rank battle pet warrior. And if he can do better than that, I\u2019ll support him with all I have. I\u2019ll give him my Phantom Flame Beast if that\u2019s what it takes.\u201dThe Phantom Flame Beast had been her partner since she was young; of course she didn\u2019t want to hand it to anyone else. She said so because she didn\u2019t believe Su Ping could surpass her.During her studies, she never fell out of the top three on the score list. Not once. She was confident.Li Qingru looked between them and sighed. \u201cI hope you two stay friendly like this. You need to help each other once I\u2019m gone.\u201dSu Lingyue frowned. \u201cDon\u2019t be like that, mom. I talked to my professor. I\u2019ll go to the barrens as soon as I graduate, so I can earn merit points and buy medicines for you.\u201dSu Ping smiled. \u201cTake care of yourself for now, mom, and don\u2019t worry about us. I\u2019ll take care of my pet. My Little Skeleton is pretty good.\u201dLi Qingru shook her head. Good? How good can a skeleton be?She was both glad and sad to see Su Ping being so humble, for she thought that she was responsible for his situation. She could have easily gotten Su Ping another Phantom Flame Beast if she had kept their shop in good condition.\u201c*Sigh* I\u2019ll prepare dinner.\u201d She headed to the kitchen and left the children behind.Su Lingyue glanced at his brother. \u201cI never thought you could be a good boy like this. And no, I\u2019m not being sarcastic. I appreciate it, really. Just don\u2019t do anything stupid, alright? Becoming a battle pet warrior means nothing. No matter how you work from now on, you won\u2019t be able to actually help me with anything. It should be the opposite. If you stay careful and don\u2019t act up, I\u2019ll find some time and teach you some pet warrior skills.\u201dSu Ping felt it was extremely weird that his sister was playing the adult role. \u201cI\u2019m the bigger one here, remember?\u201d\u201cHumph. Every man will stay childish. No exceptions.\u201d\u201cWhat the heck? You talk as if you\u2019ve been through better.\u201dSu Lingyue\u2019s expression turned colder. \u201cWatch what you\u2019re saying.\u201dSu Ping stood up, and under his sister\u2019s threatening stare, he put a hand on her head and rubbed.\u201cBe a good sister, will you? A soft and cute girl draws more love from people.\u201dSu Lingyue was frozen for a moment.Ever since she went to the academy at the age of 12, Su Ping, or any other male, had never managed to lay a hand on her, let alone touching her head.She felt humiliated!She tried slapping Su Ping\u2019s hand away by using a small portion of her astral power, so she could teach him a lesson. Such a hit would definitely leave Su Ping\u2019s hand swollen for a few days.She failed. Su Ping pulled away in time.\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201d Su Lingyue clenched her teeth in rage. \u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire, I\u2019ll show you!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t say?

Su Lingyue had barely managed to swallow her rage down her throat, but she felt how it was dangerously returning.Li Qingru quickly realized what was going on because this happened quite often in the family. \u201cStop it. I just told you to be good to each other a second ago!\u201d\u201cSorry, mom.\u201d Su Ping lowered his head as he found his mother was truly angry.Li Qingru shook her head and turned away to continue cooking.\u201cDon\u2019t you think this is over!\u201d Su Lingyue shouted while taking the apples all to herself.\u201cUm-hmm.\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201d\u201cHa?\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201dThey totally understood what they were talking about.Su Ping retreated to his room after dinner, while Su Lingyue didn\u2019t say anything else. Su Lingyue had planned to ask his brother about what he did at the vice president\u2019s office earlier, but she no longer felt like it, since it would make her look bad.As usual, Su Ping stayed on his bed to cultivate his astral power. The \u201cChaos Star Chart\u201d method was such a domineering technique that he could easily pull all the astral power existing in the environment his way. He might even stop Su Lingyue from cultivating if he wanted to.It was less than a week since he started cultivating, yet his Combat Strength had been improved by 0.2, reaching 3.7, which made him an upper third-rank already. If he kept on, he\u2019d become a fourth-rank in the next week. Combining his Solar Bulwark, he was at the moment strong enough to fight off most fifth-rank monsters. Or sixth-rank ones, if he cast augmentation skills on himself.\u201cI need to get my Solar Bulwark to the second rank so that eighth-rank and ninth ones can\u2019t kill me easily. Only then I\u2019ll be able to survive better...\u201dAs someone who had witnessed the perilous threats in the barren areas, he couldn\u2019t let his guard down even if his life in the city looked peaceful.A night quickly passed.The next morning, Su Ping and Su Lingyue had breakfast while having a staring contest, before they both went on their ways without any verbal mishaps.Su Ping saw a slim-bodied lady in a long, coffee-colored overcoat looking here and there in front of his shop. Without minding her, Su Ping locked his bike to a tree using a chain to deter thieves, and went to unlock the shop.It was then that the seemingly apathetic woman suddenly gave him a surprised look.Next, the woman followed him into the shop.\u201cSomething you need?\u201d asked Su Ping, after he gave the woman a glimpse. He found her face to be a little familiar but couldn\u2019t remember her name. He wondered if she was a customer who saw his advertisement.\u201cYou\u2019re the shopkeeper here?\u201d Jiang Hanbing looked at Su Ping up and down and found this man too young to run a shop. Then she remembered seeing him the day before.Su Ping nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Do you need your pet cared for, trained, or are you looking for pet food?\u201d\u201c... You were at the academy yesterday, right? Did you train that powerful Lightning Rat?\u201dSu Ping was glad that the flyers he printed didn\u2019t totally go to waste. \u201cYeah, that\u2019ll be me.\u201dJiang Hanbing sighed in relief. She and Su Yanying used to be clear of each other\u2019s way, but ever since their classmates tended to compare them in various matters, they slowly became rivals. As Jiang Hanbing observed recently, Su Yanying had the talent, but was far from being a good trainer. Also, Su Yanying was not someone who knew how to bide her time. If she had that powerful rat all along, she would have used it way before.Using the flyer she found from a classmate, Jiang Hanbing went to that shop to see whether the rumor was true. She was expecting to see some kind of grand, beautifully-decorated boutique managed by an experienced dealer, not this... boy who seemed two years younger than herself.\u201cHow long does it take to train a pet? Are you the trainer?\u201d she asked.\u201cI am. I don\u2019t have a fixed duration for training a pet; it depends on how many sessions you buy. Once all sessions are complete, I\u2019ll send word so you can pick up your pet.\u201d\u201cSessions?\u201d Jiang Hanbing had never heard of such a training methodology before. Though it wasn\u2019t strange for reclusive masters with amazing skills to have odd protocols.\u201cFour pets. Ten sessions each,\u201d she offered.Su Ping raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou must pay independently for each session, I\u2019m afraid. Do you have enough money on you?\u201dJiang Hanbing was ready to hear an insane price from the shop that trained the exceptional Lightning Rat. \u201cHow much for each session?\u201d\u201cTen thousand for low-rank pets. A hundred thousand for middle-rank. As for advanced... sorry, I\u2019m not accepting them for the time being.\u201dGetting the Lightning Rat in shape only unlocked such a level of service. If Su Ping wished to train advanced pets, he had to successfully train a middle-rank pet in the same way.\u201cThat\u2019s... pretty cheap,\u201d said Jiang Hanbing. Such pricing would look like a scam in ordinary pet shops, but not so much if they were talking about who trained that special rat.Su Ping\u2019s lips twitched. He was always frustrated about not being able to determine prices freely.Thankfully, the Lightning Rat was a special case, because the system demanded him to boost it higher. From then on, he could simply take the customer\u2019s pets to a cultivation plane and hang out for a bit to get the job done. He might have to die a few times while at it, but that wasn\u2019t a problem.\u201cI have three fourth-rank pets and a third-rank one. Can you get them all to a level equal to the Lightning Rat\u2019s?\u201d Jiang Hanbing was already paying because she didn\u2019t want Su Ping to suddenly change his mind.\u201cOf course not. The Lightning Rat was an exception. I provide \u2018normal\u2019 training most of the time.\u201dJiang Hanbing knew that getting four Lightning Rat-like pets in one go could only be a dream, but it still felt bad when Su Ping pointed it out.Also, she wondered if the Lightning Rat was a unique case used for attracting customers, while the true trainer had already left the shop. Or, it could be worse, all of it being a lie. Su Yanying might have been a paid shill who helped the shop with false advertisement.Su Ping didn\u2019t know what Jiang Hanbing was thinking but it couldn\u2019t be anything good to his business.\u201cNormal training still has decent effects, you know. Do you want to buy it or not?\u201dReally? Jiang Hanbing shook her head. If there used to be something good here, Su Yanying already took it. Damn it.\u201cI\u2019ll... entrust you with one pet for now.\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to leave empty-handed. Even if this \u201cmaster trainer\u201d was no longer there, this shop could still have some connection. Becoming a customer was a good choice.As for Su Yanying being a scammer, Jiang Hanbing didn\u2019t believe that to be possible. Su Yanying would have cooperated with a bigger shop if that were the case.\u201cOne, huh?\u201d Su Ping felt bad that the sale was suddenly reduced to a quarter, though he couldn\u2019t force his customer. \u201cFine.\u201dPing\u2014Pong!\u201cEmergency mission!\u201d the system suddenly announced in his head. \u201cA customer has withdrawn her order due to mistrust, resulting in decreased revenue. On this special occasion, the host shall be allowed to initiate a specialized training session.\u201d\u201cPrice: a hundred times the usual price of a normal training session.\u201d\u201cTime limit: 30 days.\u201d\u201cRequirement: customer\u2019s pet must reach an aptitude of above average.\u201d\u201cReward: one intermediate Force Pellet plus a mythical technique tutorial chosen at random.\u201d\u201cPenalty for failure: host rating reduced by 10.\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the price for a specialized training session was only 10,000 when Su Ping trained Su Yanying\u2019s Lightning Rat back then. He could have gotten a million if this mission came up earlier.Sh*t. All the money I missed... Su Ping felt his heart bleed.The time limit for this mission was acceptable, though. A month should be enough. Apparently, the system was aware that he could no longer enter cultivation planes for free or die without suffering any losses. He did need to take his time in an ordinary plane.Seeing Jiang Hanbing already paying with her phone, he quickly told her to stop.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d she asked.\u201cIt\u2019s... possible for me to repeat what happened to the Lightning Rat, but it\u2019ll cost ya. A lot.\u201dIn fact, a million was usually enough to directly buy the egg of an upper seventh-rank pet. The owner of the pet still needed more money and resources to train it later, but the pet would grow up sooner or later. Eventually, a full-fledged seventh-rank pet would have its price elevated to several million, which was enough to buy a house in the middle of a big city.\u201cCan you??\u201d Jiang Hanbing brimmed with joy. \u201cHow much exactly?\u201d\u201cSpecialized training is worth a hundred times. That will be a million for low-rank pets, and ten million for middle-rankers.\u201d\u201cA million??\u201d Jiang Hanbing gave him a doubtful look. \u201cIf I pay that kind of money, can you really train a low-rank pet as powerful as Su Yanying\u2019s Lightning Rat? You were there to watch the match. That thing knocked out a seventh-rank Silver-Winged Dragon!\u201d\u201cDid you ever learn that the outcome of any battle is not only dependent on pet ranks? Why do we need battle pet warriors otherwise? The Lightning Rat was a lower seventh-rank who has gained a lot of combat experience, while that dragon is, well, not so experienced. It has a strong body but it\u2019s still unable to put it to use. Your augmentation skills and your commands are all vital to your victory. What I\u2019m saying is, I can teach the same things to your pets, but it relies on you whether they can defeat a Silver-Wings Dragon or something similar.\u201dJiang Hanbing was taken aback as she didn\u2019t think Su Ping could speak so wisely.She came from a good family, yet ten million was no small number to her. Even one million was not something she could throw away lightly, because that was all she could save up in a year by working hard.\u201cMister, are you absolutely sure that my pets will be able to beat up ordinary high-rank pets after being trained by you? If I don\u2019t mess up as their master, that is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem.\u201dJiang Hanbing looked around the shop and widened her eyes slightly when she read some of the price tags.\u201cUm, do you own this shop or are you running it in someone else\u2019s stead?\u201dSu Ping knew the woman was worried that he\u2019d take her money and ditch the shop.\u201cIt\u2019s my shop.\u201d\u201cCan\u2014May I take a look at your house deed?\u201dThat was an odd question, but Jiang Hanbing found it necessary to see the proof. The lower town was not a very secure area. She would have a hard time trying to catch a thief.Su Ping chuckled. \u201cIf you mistrust me, you can check the website of your school. Apart from owning this shop, I\u2019m also an honorary professor of the academy. They just hired me.\u201dHe was glad he accepted the vice principal\u2019s offer; such a status was quite handy.\u201cYou\u2019re a professor??\u201d Jiang Hanbing stared at him. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Only advanced battle pet warriors are allowed\u2014\u201d\u201cJust take a look at the web. You\u2019ll see.\u201dJiang Hanbing quickly checked her phone until she found the page showing the names of registered personnel. In the \u201cadvanced teacher\u201d section, she found five entries instead of four as she remembered. The extra one was none other than Su Ping, with his picture.\u201cYou... but... what...\u201d Jiang Hanbing stuttered and almost dropped her phone on the floor. Then she looked up and down several times to make sure she was talking to the same person as shown in the portrait.\u201cYou\u2019re our professor? They accepted someone so young as a professor!\u201d\u201cCome on. If you\u2019re still unconvinced, you can phone your Vice Principal. He\u2019ll tell you.\u201dOf course Jiang Hanbing couldn\u2019t bother the Vice Principal for this. No one had the courage to sabotage the academy\u2019s page so openly, and even if they did, the incorrect part would not stay there for long. She didn\u2019t believe Su Ping had what it takes to temporarily manipulate the roster just to fool her.But... What kind of godly genius can be employed as an advanced teacher of the academy while barely reaching adult age??In the past few days, Jiang Hanbing had felt so terrible since her confidence had been mercilessly mauled over and over. Apart from losing in the quarter finals, she saw too many talented folk better than her. That Ye Hao even possessed a seventh-rank dragon-type pet.And yet, all those were nothing compared to what she had just witnessed in this seemingly inconspicuous shop!62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Celestial PigPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 96: Celestial PigJiang Hanbing felt embarrassed once she believed in Su Ping\u2019s identity because she had been too impolite. After offering an apology, she paid for a specialized training session without a second thought.A million for a pet as powerful as the famous Lightning Rat was a nice trade. She had no reason to think otherwise.She wasn\u2019t sure if this was enough for her to surpass Su Yanying since there wouldn\u2019t be any competitions any time soon. However, she could use her trained pet to rapidly gain experience in Class C barren areas so she could become an official settler soon. This way, she would have something good to talk about during future reunion parties.Her eyes brimmed with happiness when she thought her dream was almost within reach.Su Ping nodded upon receiving the payment confirmation. The pay was good, but the responsibility that came with it was also pretty serious, so he didn\u2019t feel too happy since he might fail the mission if he wasn\u2019t careful enough.\u201cA month... I have time to make careful plans. Now, summon your pet,\u201d he told Jiang Hanbing.Jiang Hanbing nodded and used her astral power to open her pet space; a pink, round-bodied piglet stumbled out.This was a third-rank, poison-type Celestial Pig. Just like ordinary Lightning Rats, they usually stayed at the same rank in their entire lives, with the exception of rare cases that might evolve into Venom Veilers, which were of the fifth rank.This thing was almost useless in battles, though Jiang Hanbing kept it with her because they had spent years together. Besides, Jiang Hanbing loved its adorable look. Unlike actual pigs or most Astral Pets, this small creature didn\u2019t shed or leave odors all over the place. Instead, it always carried a mild and pleasant smell.When threatened, however, the smell would turn into deadly poison.*Snort*The pig quickly stumbled on all fours and braced itself in front of the only potential enemy in the room, which was Su Ping.As soon as it received Jiang Hanbing\u2019s order to stand back, it slumped back down, scratched its neck with a pointy toe, and looked around the shop curiously with a pair of black and beady eyes.Su Ping briefly checked the pig and found his mission to be doable.\u201cThe session will take a month.\u201d He looked at Jiang Hanbing again. \u201cCome again by then.\u201d\u201cOnly a month?\u201dAs the pig\u2019s master, she knew its condition better than anyone. She had spent a lot of effort training it, which only allowed it to become slightly stronger compared to others of its kind. It was quite impossible for the pig to confront enemies of the same rank. In the worst cases, an enemy with poison resistance would easily destroy the creature.As they agreed, Su Ping had to improve the pig until it could fight off seventh-rank Astral Pets within a month. This was conceivable!There were other master trainers out there who might be able to succeed, but only by spending half a year or more. She wondered if Su Ping got the time wrong.\u201cI\u2019ll take it from here. Just remember the time,\u201d Su Ping reassured her.She chose to believe in Su Ping\u2019s confident attitude, while trying not to show her excitement. It would be fine if Su Ping was being overly optimistic, and that she needed to wait a few more days. But that was acceptable as long as her pig became stronger.\u201cThank you, Mister\u2014I mean, Professor!\u201d\u201cYou can stick to \u2018Mister\u2019 while in this shop.\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201dIf any of Jiang Hanbing\u2019s classmates would have seen her unusually obedient character, their jaws would have hit the floor indeed.\u201cDo you have more pets to train? Just a reminder, those below middle-rank only cost a hundred thousand.\u201d Su Ping still preferred to secure more income if he could manage.Jiang Hanbing blushed. \u201cI don\u2019t have enough money on me. Sorry...\u201dA million was what she could pay without affecting her lifestyle. Any more and she would have to survive on cheap bread and cup noodles.Su Ping shook his head. Damn, another bankrupt. She\u2019s good though. You don\u2019t find many families who give their children so much pocket money.\u201cWhat about pet food?\u201d Su Ping tried.Jiang Hanbing flinched after checking the nearest shelf. \u201cUh, maybe next time.\u201dWhy does everyone act as if I\u2019m trying to ransack them? Su Ping complained in his mind, before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to your business then.\u201dJiang Hanbing found it strange that Su Ping was so impatient to an important customer who had just spent a million at the shop, although she wasn\u2019t going to say anything about it. After bidding farewell to her pet, she turned away and left.Su Ping bought a temporary contract from the system store and used it on the Celestial Pig immediately, so the critter didn\u2019t do anything unnecessary when he wasn\u2019t looking.\u201cCome here. Ohh, you feel so soft!\u201d He carried the pig to the pet room and placed it inside a nursing pen.He might need some time to select a proper cultivation plane. He returned to the shop\u2019s counter to check through the list of planes. This way, he wouldn\u2019t overlook any customers. The others could not see his \u201csystem window\u201d anyway.\u201cThis is the place?\u201d someone uttered while walking through the door.Su Ping canceled the window and saw two girls with short bodies enter the store.Upon reaching the counter, one of the girls with a round face spoke to him first, \u201cIs this the Pixie Pet Store? That special Lightning Rat was raised here, right?\u201dMust be more students who saw the flyers, Su Ping thought.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Both of you want your pets trained?\u201dThe same girl seemed happy about the response but was interrupted by her partner, who was tugging at her sleeve while pointing at the shelves.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She would have run already if she wasn\u2019t born braver than her friends.\u201cAhem, Mister! I want to get a really bad-ass pet trained here. But it\u2019s bad-tempered, I wonder if you can handle it. And for how much.\u201d\u201cTen thousand for low-rank, and a hundred thousand for middle-rank.\u201d Su Ping offered a friendly smile.That smile only made her think it was the cocky smirk of a scheming broker in Yu Yuanyuan\u2019s view, even though such a price wasn\u2019t too far from her comfort zone. When checking the goods on sale, she expected to hear more insane numbers than that.\u201cHow much did you charge for training that Lightning Rat?\u201dSu Ping\u2019s smile disappeared. \u201cOne million.\u201dThe girls were surprised but soon recovered because a million was pretty cheap in exchange for such a deadly Lightning Rat.She needed to make sure Su Ping was speaking the truth, though.\u201cYou know which Lightning Rat I\u2019m talking about, right?\u201d asked Yu Yuanyuan. \u201cDo you know who\u2019s its master?\u201dSu Ping gave her a side-glance. \u201cI\u2019m obliged to protect the privacy of my customers but... I can tell you this: she\u2019s from the Phoenix Peak Academy. Miss Su.\u201dYu Yuanyuan breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cWhat can my pet gain if I pay ten thousand?\u201d\u201cTen thousand, huh? It\u2019s hard to say. There will be some sort of improvement, that I can assure you. Either a rank, half a rank, or battle experience. Either way, your pet will be better than before.\u201d Su Ping returned to his seat while speaking.Woah, he lost interest already, the girls thought. Talk about businessmen...They were curious to find out what the result of the training would be. They might not be able to raise a million even if they worked together, but paying ten thousand was not as problematic.\u201cI\u2019ll put a middle-rank plus a low-rank pet here,\u201d said Yu Yuanyuan.Her partner, who seemed pretty timid, also spoke up, \u201cI\u2014I\u2019ll also leave a pet here. My Spider Queen.\u201dSpider Queen?? Su Ping glanced at the second girl again. For such a cutie to use that kind of scary pet? Don\u2019t tell me this girl has a personality disorder or something.He wasn\u2019t going to refuse the business, though. \u201cThat\u2019ll be two hundred \u2018n ten thousand for both of you.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Yu Yuanyuan nodded and paid as she asked. \u201cHow long do we need to wait?\u201d\u201cCome tomorrow.\u201dSu Ping smiled brightly as he had just earned 2,100 energy points on his account. His advertisement tactic was paying off!\u201cTomorrow?? That\u2019s fast! Are you like\u2014\u201d... tricking us? Is this guy even dependable?Su Ping knew what they were thinking about but didn\u2019t have anything to prove himself at the moment.\u201cIf I don\u2019t finish the request by tomorrow, I\u2019ll refund you.\u201d\u201cOkay...\u201dIn fact, the girls had just planned to ask for a refund. But they both decided to see how things would turn out, after seeing Su Ping being so positive.\u201cI\u2019m recording, mind you.\u201d Yu Yuanyuan showed her phone. \u201cMake sure you don\u2019t go back on your word. It won\u2019t work.\u201dSu Ping\u2019s improved eyesight already allowed him to see that the girl was bluffing; her camera was not even on. Though he wasn\u2019t going to point it out.\u201cI\u2019m not going to damage my reputation just to earn such a small amount of money. Summon your pets and leave if you don\u2019t have anything else to say.\u201dThe girls knew Su Ping was getting angry and quickly did as told. They were unwilling to part with their pets, but being away for one day was no biggie.When the girls left, Su Ping placed the three new pets into the pet room, filling up the vacant nursing pens.He checked one of the pens in which the Managarm was still kept. According to their contract, the pick-up deadline for this creature was long overdue. Its master was either dead, or he decided to abandon the hound.Either way, it was for the shop to decide how to deal with the hound at the moment.Su Ping bit his finger and tried making a pet contract with it. Soon, a spiritual connection was established between them, which meant he guessed correctly.\u201cOof. Poor guy.\u201d He patted the hound on the head and returned to the front room.The contract was only meant to check whether the hound\u2019s master still wanted it. Though he wasn\u2019t going to terminate it soon. A Managarm would not take away much of his spiritual power. He might try taking it with the other pets when training them and make it stronger, so he could rent it out to other customers. Or he could sell it, if the system allowed him to do so one day.Soon, more students from the academy showed up. They were either famous ones on the ranking list or curious students who just wanted to check the shop out. Of course, most of them were scared away by Su Ping\u2019s prices, leaving only a few brave ones who purchased care or training services.As for pet food... no sale at all.This was to be expected, because the students were there because of Su Yanying\u2019s Lightning Rat. The food was too expensive to their liking.Apart from what he had gained from Jiang Hanbing and the two girls that followed, Su Ping had earned a total of five thousand energy points during the day. He had broken his daily sales record.Without a second thought, he spent ten thousand points to get the Chaotic Spirit Pool to level 3. Such a level would then have a small chance of directly giving birth to a Beast King.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Inferno DragonPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 98: Inferno DragonSu Ping intended to try the pool out straight away. Perhaps he could get lucky with it. Besides, he was still under the beginner\u2019s protection according to the system; each incubation would only cost him 10% its original price during this period. Afterwards, he would need to pay 10,000 energy points for each attempt.He had an egg still kept inside a nursing pen which had yet to hatch. He still had no idea what kind of pet would be born out of it. Using the incubation pool to directly get a pet sounded like a good idea.\u201cMy balance... After earning a million, which was converted to ten thousand energy points, I used it to level up the pool. Now I have seven thousand points remaining, which means seven incubation chances.\u201dOf course, he couldn\u2019t use up all the points because he still needed some to get his mission done. That is, the specialized training session. To be safe, he would save up a few thousand energy points for this job.A failed incubation means a thousand points thrown down the drain. Gosh, this is madness.A thousand energy points were equal to 100,000 Yuan in cash. That was almost a year\u2019s worth of tuition for Su Lingyue. Average workers in the city usually needed two or three years to earn that much money.Su Ping stood in front of the incubation pool, crossed his fingers, and offered prayers to a bunch of random gods and deities he could think of.Then he took a deep breath and activated the pool.[Energy points -1,000]The incubation pool brightened up as soon as it received his \u201cpayment.\u201d The light was naturally stronger than the last time when the pool was still at level 2. When standing nearby, Su Ping could feel that the astral power radiating from it had grown at least ten times richer than before.A while later, the light dimmed down and revealed a Rock Lion cub sitting at the bottom of the pool, curiously looking at Su Ping with its amber-like eyes.This was a disappointment. The lion was a common fifth-rank pet easily found on the market. Selling as it was would get him roughly 100,000 Yuan. That was about it.He gently carried the small feline in his hands and had his arm tickled as the creature happily nudged him. Looking at the cub\u2019s twinkling, puppy-doll eyes somewhat cured his frustration.After giving it several playful head-rubs, he sent it to a nursing pen and returned to the incubation pool.Another 1,000 points gone.The astral power in the pool seemed to be lasting longer this time. Like a whirlpool, the energy swirled around for a while, before it condensed at the bottom of the pool and started shrinking.The retreating light first gave way to a red, slim and pointy tail. For a moment, Su Ping thought he was expecting a snake or something similar.He was proven wrong when he saw a pair of tiny wings stretching open.It was a dragon, the \u201cmeta pet\u201d in the current world. Su Ping went wide-eyed as he recognized this awesome species.That\u2019s an Inferno Dragon... A ninth-rank dragon-type pet.Compared to Beast Kings that were always a rare sight in this world, ninth-rank Astral Pets usually had a bigger population and variety. Even common civilians who had no business with Astral Pets would know some of the famous ones since they appeared in online advertisements on a daily basis. For instance, many titled battle pet warriors would take their ninth-rank pets and become brand ambassadors for certain products to get some quick money. As a result, the images of several ninth-rank pets could be seen everywhere, from random street posters to large advertising screens in the cities\u2019 downtown areas.Having a powerful ninth-rank Astral Pet meant looking cool in battles. For this reason, film production companies and sponsors alike always seeked to have them in their footage to attract more customers.This Inferno Dragon was one of the best among all ninth-rank pets. The Silver-Winged Dragon and the Thunder Basilisk who made their appearance in the academy were both ninth-rank upon reaching maturity, yet they would all fall short when compared with an Inferno Dragon.There was a group of experts who maintained a ranking list for ninth-rank pets and kept it updated. On the list, an Inferno Dragon was always within the top ten. Or the top three, if people only looked at dragon-type pets.\u201cOh sh*t oh sh*t oh sh*t. I hit the jackpot!\u201dSu Ping didn\u2019t know the exact value of an Inferno Dragon, as nobody could easily find it on sale. Not even in the black markets.The small dragon was currently gazing at him warily, with a pair of bright red eyes that seemed to be on fire. It had its body covered in beautiful red scales that looked almost polished. The only thing ruining its overall image was the pair of undeveloped wings that looked like plucked chicken wings. There was no way it could fly with them at the moment.Su Ping couldn\u2019t persuade himself to look away now. A level-3 incubation pool should have a very low probability of creating a top-tier pet. It seemed that his luck was in full swing that day.The Inferno Dragon whelp opened its mouth and yelled at Su Ping as a warning. Though it only sounded like a cat\u2019s purr.Just like humans, newborn Astral Pets tended to have different characters from the beginning. Looking unfriendly was, in fact, a good perk, because the dragon might be more intelligent. Training it could be harder, yet the result was very likely to be sweeter.Su Ping quickly made a pact with it. When this was done, Su Ping found a new consciousness full of anxiety and doubt connected to his mind.It seemed that the dragon whelp would see everything in this world as a threat for the moment, except for its master.Su Ping carefully picked it up and felt its warm and smooth scales, whereas the whelp kept edging away from his embrace. He then placed the small creature inside a nursing pen to let it take in some anima aura as soon as possible, so it could grow strong enough to fight.Since he still had more points to spare, he decided to keep trying and see whether he could get an even better result.His streak didn\u2019t keep up though. The third attempt ended up as a complete failure. He used an additional thousand points and got nothing in return.Damn. 100,000 Yuan went down the gutter. This thing is the biggest money drain I\u2019ve ever heard of.The system spoke in his mind, \u201cAs aforementioned, the incubation pool may experience exceptional failure, causing fruitless results. The chances of such failures occurring will decrease as the level of the pool increases. A maxed-out incubation pool will no longer yield such failures.\u201d\u201cIt failed once out of two last time, then it happened again on the third try today. Isn\u2019t it a little bit too high??\u201d\u201cThis is beyond the system\u2019s control.\u201d\u201cUgh, forget it. Or, can you at least refund half of the wasted points to me?\u201d\u201cCurrently using a proper response as observed from the host to address such a question: \u2018piss off\u2019.\u201d\u201c...You got me. Fine.\u201dSu Ping was once again reminded of the saddening fact that he should never try to reason with this shameless system. The incubation pool was another of its many traps to burn his energy points away. He might find chances to get large amounts of energy points in the future, but the system would always force him to spend them!He was left with a little above four thousand points. Using the points on the incubation pool during the \u201cbeginner\u2019s protection period\u201d was a good choice, but he couldn\u2019t do that now, as he needed some points to ensure a successful outcome for his mission. Perhaps he could try again later, once the emergency mission was done.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Shop LevelsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: Shop LevelsSu Ping sat down behind the counter to train his skills while waiting for more customers. Or in other words, more energy point batteries.The shop was far from being crowded, but he could still see that his \u201cpropaganda\u201d was working. Every now and then, a few students of Phoenix Peak Academy would come to visit and occasionally buy services.Thanks to all the piled-up orders, he finally realized that there was a limit to how many nursing pens he could have in the shop. According to the system, the shop was currently level 1, which was allowed to hold 25 nursing pens in total.Getting the shop to the next level would increase the upper limit to 50, as well as updating the \u201csystem shop\u201d, which might allow him to buy better items and services.A level-2 shop also came with two important functions: Nursing Space and Dummy Trainer.The Nursing Space allowed him to keep customers\u2019 pets inside, instead of occupying the available nursing pens, in case those customers didn\u2019t come to retrieve their pets in time. Previously, he had to keep neglected pets inside nursing pens since the system wouldn\u2019t allow him to randomly throw them here and there. With a Nursing Space, however, he could toss pets that didn\u2019t need to receive any more services inside and forget about them.\u201cDummy Trainer\u201d was a very handy function that allowed him to order his \u201cclones\u201d to train pets in his stead. These clones, or dummies, would carry a portion of his character and skills, and could go on training sessions in different cultivation planes by themselves. While waiting, Su Ping could either give them more specific orders or leave them to commence ordinary training.At this rate, he couldn\u2019t possibly handle all customers by himself as the shop gained more fame. This new function would solve a major problem.But to level up the shop, he needed 10,000 energy points. He didn\u2019t have enough, even after all the subsequent sales of the day.He already had 25 elementary nursing pens filled up. Thankfully, those were only 10 energy points each. As for intermediate ones, each one was worth 1,000 energy points to maintain. To go with the elevated price, an intermediate pen also had a \u201cx100\u201d nursing efficiency. A random pet that stayed inside for 24 hours could gain a visible improvement in strength.A pet could get stronger both by staying inside an energy-rich nursing pen and undergoing training. The latter required Su Ping\u2019s personal effort and was obviously optimal. Also, training was the way to go if he wished to finish the \u201cspecialized training mission.\u201d Keeping a pet inside a nursing pen was not enough.Before he could open up more nursing pens, he had to decline some orders, although he could still earn some energy points by selling pet food as there was no limit to that.He felt a headache when looking at nearly twenty pets waiting to be nursed in the pet room.At noon, he bought a cheap lunch box and closed the shop. He planned to get the first group of pets trained as quickly as possible so he could accept more and get enough energy points to level up the shop. That would free up a lot of his time.With several quick moves, he purchased enough temporary pet contracts from the system, found four fire-type pets in the pet room, and used the contracts on them in one go.He felt his head getting heavier the moment he finished the contracts. As an upper third-rank battle pet warrior, keeping seven pets under his control was almost his limit.Luckily, dying multiple times in cultivation planes contributed to the growth of his spirit and endurance somewhat.\u201cUgh, my head... That\u2019s all of the fire-types? Good. I can train all four of them in one trip.\u201dHe sat down and scrolled through the cultivation plane list to look for one suitable for fire-type pets. In the end, he chose a place called \u201cStellar Shard #9527,\u201d which would cost him 5 energy points to enter. This looked like a pretty good one among all the elementary cultivation planes.Like before, a dimensional vortex appeared in the pet room and drew him inside.\u201cThe host has been connected to Stellar Shard #9527.\u201d\u201cTime limit: 24 hours.\u201d\u201cUnder beginner\u2019s protection, the host will receive 30 free death allowances.\u201d\u201cPlease begin your exploration, and good luck.\u201dSu Ping\u2019s eyes were still closed when he felt a scorching heat assaulting his skin. When he opened them, he saw flames and burning lava everywhere. He was standing on a floating rock in the middle of a lava pool. His arrival caused the rock to dangerously sink several inches, bursting several giant bubbles of hot carbon dioxide.Where the heck am I?Su Ping scouted around while trying to find a better footing. He managed to see a higher landscape up ahead where there was less lava.Fire-types were a popular choice among students, especially proud ones, because all the pets of this category knew some flashy moves, even though they might not be very useful.People didn\u2019t often find wild fire-type pets, however, because these creatures tended to make a big scene by burning things up. Predators could easily detect them from a distance and kill them.None of the four pets Su Ping took with him could fly, so they had to proceed by jumping between the floating rocks. He feared that some of the rocks were not as sturdy as they appeared to be. Stepping on them might not be a good idea.Man. Without Solar Bulwark, the air would be enough to roast me alive. Is there anything living around here at all?The system did tell him that certain abandoned cultivation planes were inhabitable. He could have stumbled into one if he was unlucky.\u201cHey, you four. Try jumping into the lava,\u201d he ordered the pets.The pets looked at each other with terrified looks. Despite being of the fire-type, they couldn\u2019t actually survive in the lava. Powerful fire-based attacks could still hurt them, let alone such bright magma that looked at least a thousand Celsius hot.However, they couldn\u2019t oppose Su Ping\u2019s order with their pet contracts in effect.As carefully as possible, they moved to the edge of the platform and reached with their paws below.Fizz!It smelled like burnt fur.As one, the creatures turned back and stared at Su Ping with watery eyes.Su Ping didn\u2019t care about them getting hurt though, since pets being trained in a cultivation plane could get revived countless times.He walked to the pets, and without any forewarning, he booted one of them\u2014a Pyro Canine\u2014over the edge.\u201cWuff?? AHROOOOO\u2014\u201d62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Fast TrainingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Fast TrainingThe Pyro Canine struggled in the hot lava and shrieked at the top of its lungs. Like most canine pets, this one had learned how to scare off its opponents by roaring at them. At this moment, however, it only sounded like a terrified puppy being bullied.Its flame-red fur could not help it withstand the deadly heat as it was instantly ignited. In a few seconds, the dog turned into a scorching ball of fire and disappeared under the surface.The other still living pets looked at the sad fate of their partner with widened eyes and opened jaws.Their contract made it clear that Su Ping was their new master for the moment. As pets loved and cared for by their original owners, they felt as if they had been condemned to hell overnight. The man in front of them was a terrible pet abuser or something even worse. He had just killed one of them without the slightest bit of mercy.Using the power of their contract, Su Ping called his next target over, which was a Blue Spark Cat. This one was another popular fire-type pet with proficiency for speed. It was currently at the fourth rank, while it had the potential of reaching the sixth rank with enough training.The cat stared at Su Ping with its enlarged violet eyes and slowly walked his way.Copying what he did a moment ago, he sent the creature down into the lava below.\u201cYOOOOWL\u2014\u201dThe poor creature puffed up into a fur ball and went inside the red substance of death with no way of fighting back. Its hysterical meowing soon came to a stop as the charred remains of its body vanished from view.The remaining two pets huddled together and trembled.\u201cCome here.\u201dSu Ping intended for these pets to grow sturdier against fire and to have them experience what death felt like. It would be too late if they went into similar situations when exploring barren areas with their owners.The third pet\u2014an Obsidian Frog\u2014crawled his way step by step as slowly as possible.\u201cDon\u2019t waste time. It won\u2019t help you.\u201dAnother clean kick.Croak!!Splash.The frog managed to hop above the heavy liquid several times like a skipping pebble before its limbs were burned off and it died.The Flame Lion cub that stayed behind had wet itself in its own urine. This one had accepted the inescapable death with a look of true despair.Kick, burn and death.\u201cRevive here.\u201dThe four pets reappeared beside Su Ping, and he pushed them off the edge again before they realized what was happening.The Flame Lion was a bit heavier than the others. As it \u201cdove,\u201d several drops of lava reached Su Ping\u2019s body. He was quite surprised to find out that he wasn\u2019t burned at all. The lava was unpleasantly hot, but he could endure it just fine.He crouched down and also tested the lava with a finger.There was no need to pull back; the temperature was bearable, unlike what he had imagined.My Solar Bulwark is working, I guess.He had achieved the first rank of the skill in the past few days, making his body as durable as someone of the fifth rank. Combined with the fact that Golden Crows loved fire, Su Ping\u2019s fire resistance had grown to quite an impressive degree.He reached further down, until his entire hand was inside the lava.It was... good. It felt like having a hot bath.He removed his clothes and sat down at the edge of the platform to soak his feet in the lava.A pleasing sense traveled along his legs and reached his body, causing him to shudder in delight. He felt how his body was absorbing fire elements from the lava, which in turn improved his Solar Bulwark. This was probably made possible by the Golden Crows\u2019 nature, who were known to consume fire to grow up.\u201cRevive.\u201dThe resurrected pets saw him naked and were briefly surprised, before they remembered what was going on.Again, Su Ping forced them to continue \u201cbathing.\u201dThe restraining power of the pet contracts was not completely infallible. There were occasional cases in which pets could harm their owners. The Pyro Canine seemed to be going down this path right then. Upon hearing Su Ping\u2019s order, it bared its teeth at him instead.When Su Ping tried kicking it again, it bit his ankle and latched onto his leg.Without minding the almost negligible pain, Su Ping moved his leg to hurl the dog away. The creature was easily shaken off because its teeth barely went inside his skin.Su Ping\u2019s current body was completely invulnerable against anything at the fourth rank or below. Not to mention that the four pets he had brought were all of the fire type.Unable to resist, the pets cycled through life and death repeatedly.They died several hundred times or so in two hours. While at it, they tried to learn how to last longer in the lava pool, which eventually allowed them to paddle in the lava for a minute or two. Meanwhile, their resistance against fire also grew, which was just what Su Ping hoped to achieve.His training didn\u2019t involve any complicated tactics or knowledge. By sending the pets to their deaths, they would naturally study how to do better. As simple as that. This way, even the slowest pet would be forced to come up with new properties or evolve accordingly.To make his job faster, Su Ping simply jumped off and started swimming in the lava, so the pets directly \u201cjoined\u201d him every time they came back to life.None of them were attempting to resist now, after seeing the futility of it. Their only thought was to live longer after every attempt, hoping to satisfy the human who seemed to be more of a fire-type Astral Pet than themselves.Five hours later, the pets were able to safely hold out in the lava for eight minutes. The lava could no longer kill them because eight minutes were enough for them to reach the nearest floating rock.Seeing this, Su Ping told them to stop so he could check the other parts of this cultivation plane. The training was already done.An ordinary training session required him to either improve a pet\u2019s Combat Strength rating by at least 0.33, or a new skill had to be taught. At the moment, the four pets had successfully grasped a skill called Flame Coat, which worked similarly to the Lightning Rat\u2019s \u201clightning coat.\u201d This skill could be further improved into \u201cFlame Armor\u201d in the future.Also, the Pyro Canine was slightly smarter than its companions because it gained an extra skill, which was Flame Dragon\u2019s Roar.Since the job was done, Su Ping could leave the cultivation plane and deal with the other pets, but this would be a waste since he still had about 17 hours to check out of this place. He planned to look around and perhaps gather some materials he could sell.He failed to find anything worth taking, though. There was nothing apart from a few wild fire-type Astral Pets of various levels.He was sent back to his shop when the timer ran out.He died 12 times during the exploration, all of which were caused by high-rank pets and even Beast Kings. He could have taken Little Skeleton with him but didn\u2019t do so, because there was little benefit for it in a cultivation plane for fire-type pets.Su Ping dressed himself again and phoned the owners of the trained pets before he collected and prepared another batch of pets.A day in a cultivation plane was equal to an hour in reality. When he returned to the store, Su Ping saw a young man waiting in front of the shop with a worried look, probably because the shop was closed when he was still in a training session, and this man thought he had abandoned the job.\u201cYou\u2019re the only one?\u201d Su Ping looked around and didn\u2019t see anyone else. \u201cBut I called four of you to come.\u201dThe young man gave him an embarrassed smile. \u201cThey all came, but they headed to another street to hang out when they didn\u2019t find you. Should I call them over?\u201d\u201cYeah, do it.\u201dZhang Baoxing followed Su Ping inside while texting. \u201cYou already trained my Pyro Canine? But I just handed it to you this morning.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s the afternoon now. Is there a problem?\u201dZhang Baoxing frowned. Problem? Of course there\u2019s a problem! Did this man give my pet some dog food and think it\u2019s a proper training??I bought my Pyro Canine for a hundred thousand, and he only spent a few hours training it?Zhang Baoxing decided to wait for his friends to come before arguing with Su Ping.Soon, the other three arrived.Without wasting any time, Su Ping presented them with their pets.\u201cThe training is... done?\u201d The four people all looked unhappy because they all believed that Su Ping was tricking them. While they were too worried having wasted their money, they failed to notice that their pets were almost crying upon seeing them.Su Ping simply ordered the Pyro Canine to use Flame Coat.The temporary pet contract had already been terminated, yet the dog immediately heeded the order out of instinct, as if Su Ping had just pushed some kind of sensitive button planted deep inside its heart.Followed by three more \u201cpoofs,\u201d the other three pets also did the same and brightened up the interior of the shop with their new skill, while the customers who wanted to sue Su Ping watched the pets with widened eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s Flame Coat?\u201d Zhang Baoxing recognized the skill first. \u201cBut that\u2019s a middle-rank skill. They learned it in less than a day??\u201d\u201cYour Pyro Canine also learned how to use Flame Dragon\u2019s Roar, by the way. But I can\u2019t show you here because it\u2019ll mess up my shop. Find somewhere vacant and try it out yourself later.\u201d\u201cWhat?? That\u2019s two middle-rank skills!\u201d\u201cWhat about us??\u201d the other three men quickly asked. They no longer doubted Su Ping.Su Ping glanced at them. \u201cThey went through the same training. But the rest of them were... let\u2019s say, not as talented as the Pyro Canine. They all gained a higher resistance to fire, though. From now on, common fire-based attacks will no longer work against them.\u201dThree of them looked jealous, thinking of the skills learned by the Pyro Canine, though they weren\u2019t going to complain. More defense sounded pretty useful in any case.Zhang Baoxing affectionately shook Su Ping\u2019s hand. \u201cMister Su, can\u2014can I keep my dog here for longer? Let me see, I\u2019ll pay you an extra 20,000 as a tip!\u201dSu Ping agreed right away. He couldn\u2019t convert the \u201ctip\u201d into energy points, though he would be glad to give the money to his mother. It was high time he offered some sort of financial help to his family.\u201cA pet can only undergo one training session per day,\u201d the system warned him.Su Ping curled his lips.\u201c...This is to prevent the shop from being exclusively dominated by a rich customer. The ultimate goal of the pet shop is to serve people from all walks of life. Please broaden your vision, host.\u201dWell, I can understand the first part, but is it necessary to judge me like that?? Su Ping thought, before saying to Zhang Baoxing, \u201cI can only train it once per day. Come back tomorrow.\u201dZhang Baoxing stepped back in disappointment. If he could, he would even pay a visit every day from then on.\u201cWe can all come again, right?\u201d the other three asked.\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cNice!\u201dThe customers took their pets and left, after carefully remembering the address of the \u201ctreasure vault\u201d they had just found. They finally knew how that particular Lightning Rat grew to be so strong. With such efficient training, their pets could do the same!The only problem was that they couldn\u2019t easily afford specialized training sessions.While walking away, their pets took the lead and tried to urge their masters to move faster.Su Ping closed the door and summoned more customers to pick up the second group of pets, while not forgetting to remind them that they should wait a bit should he go absent. He preferred to avoid wasting time while waiting for customers.After answering questions from several prospective customers, he bought more temporary contracts and began training the third group.The remaining pets were not necessarily of the same element, but close. Finding cultivation planes that befitted all of them would be a relatively easy task.Spending a few days inside cultivation planes tired him out. He was eager to get the shop to level 2 as soon as possible, so the \u201cDummy Trainers\u201d could help him.The good thing was, training pets personally was rewarding to him as well. He learned a lot from all the confrontations and deaths he went through.62e886631a93af4356fc7a46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
