Why can\u2019t she see anything in the dark? Could it be\u2026Shit, she died in a pile of mud to save people, but went into hell instead of going to heaven?Nan Xun just wanted to swear at the sky, but the darkness in front of her suddenly stirred and formed a whirlpool.The whirlpool grew bigger and bigger and eventually spread out into the glorious starry sky!Nan Xun stared at the wonders in front of her.Tap Tap Tap, it sounded like running.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes widened and stared at a snow-white horse who leaped out of the starry sky, crossed a beautiful arc in the air, and then landed steadily in front of Nan Xun.It has slender limbs, a fluffy mane and beautiful tail like an umbrella, which shines a star-like light.\u201cDo you want to live?\u201d The white horse stared at Nan Xun and asked.On the surface Nan Xun was not alarmed, but her heart was full of shock and was thunderous.She died, and then saw a horse, a horse with a halo who was talking!\u201cI am an ancient mythical beast, with a divine power. I am the master of time and space, I can break the void and travel through time and space and go back to the past or the future.\u201d The white horse said.Break the void? Travel through time and space?Nan Xun was stunned at first, then she pointed at it and laughed. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t tease me, haha\u2026\u201dHowever, before Nan Xun could laugh enough, she felt a huge sense of oppression sweeping over her, and her soul was squeezed and distorted in an instant!In a blink of an eye, she was already in an antique hall, and the women inside are wearing wide sleeve flowing skirts.Nan Xun became a stone sculpture, but it was too late to look closely. Her soul was twisted again.In a dozen rounds, Nan Xun saw a variety of different worlds, such as ancient royal families, warlords from the Republic of China, modern space, the real world, interstellar world\u2026It also had a primitive society, nothing to wear, wrapped in leaves below, she had especially spicy eyes.The beast flicked its halo tail and said, \u201cAs long as you help me heal some people who are very angry and evil, purify their ugly hearts and help me collect enough merits, I will take you back to the past and change the outcome of your death.\u201dNan Xun blinked and asked: What kind of psychopath, murderous maniac? The kind of villainous boss who wants to destroy the world even if everyone dies?\u201dThe void beast grew silent.Nan Xun was also silent for a while, but she quickly laughed. \u201cWell, I\u2019m already dead anyway. This business is not bad, is it?\u201dShe smiled and her brows curved, and the dark eyes reflected the whole starry sky, brighter than the stars.The Void beast nodded with satisfaction.The next moment, its body shrank smaller and smaller, and finally turned into a round ball. The ball have eyes, nose and a mouth, and almost all the short limbs are hidden under the fluffy hair.\u201cHow did you become like this?\u201d Nan Xun was surprised, her eyes lit up.Furry, so cute.The void beast that became a ball of hair uncomfortably twisted its rounded waist and snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the worlds that I have just taken you through, the spiritual power is overdrawn, so it has changed me back to my infancy.\u201d\u201cAh, so don\u2019t pretend to be forced, pretend to be struck by lightning, ha ha ha\u2026\u201d Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but laugh, she laughed more and more freelyThe void beast raised its paws with a straight face and suddenly placed a drop of blood onto Nan Xun\u2019s forehead. It said coldly: \u201cThe soul contract is signed successfully and enters the first world\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, wait, I am still not sure yet-\u201d Nan Xun has not finished her sentence, and her soul is distorted in a familiar sense of oppression.Then her eyes went black and she knew nothing.There was a sound.The sound of a sharp instrument piercing the flesh is so clear.When Nan Xun opened her eyes, she felt something splashed on her face. She reached out and touched it.Bright red and sticky, she touched a handful of blood.Looking up again, a round monster\u2019s head fell in front of her, blood dripping.Nan Xun: \u2026Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bracelet is a little hot. The voice of the void beast rings directly in her mind.\u201cYou can call this beast the eighth Lord,\u201d said the void beast.Nan Xun\u2019s was a bit angry, \u201cLittle eight, eighth Lord, come and tell your sister what this is.\u201dThe void beast said: \u201cThe situation is how you see it. Given that you have previously questioned the ability of this god beast before, you were sent directly to an advanced world. It\u2019s very similar to the world where I reside. You can feel the power of the Lord with your heart, hehe.\u201dThis sentence, ah, let the high cold void beast become very grounded for a second.\u201cAre you all right, cousin Xuan\u2019er1?\u201d A flustered male voice sounded.The next moment, Nan Xun felt that her hands were tightened, and she was pulled behind a tall man.Nan Xun is still confused, a large wave of memories was forced into her mind at this time.Looking at the tall figure in front of her, Nan Xun subconsciously called out, \u201cCousin?\u201dQin Yuexuan looked back at her and smiled gently. \u201cMy cousin, rest assure that as long as I am here, I will not let anything happen to you.\u201dThe corners of his eyes were raised, and the corners of his mouth was smiling.Qin Yuexuan gave Nan Xun a protective enchantment, and then went to deal with a group of demons in front of him.Nan Xun searched her memories for a moment. This group of demons seems to be called the demon moon wolf beast. Their personality was extremely cruel, and they always appear as a group.This is a wuxia world, where they live is called Yinchuan continent. Those who practice martial arts are called Xuan, and those who are strong are respected.There are no emperors in the Yinchuan mainland at this time, instead it is governed by the big five families.The five major families are distributed through the Yinchuan continent, the east, west, south and north of the Yinchuan continent. Among them, the most powerful family is Zuili, who specializes in beast taming.What is beast taming?That is the innate ability to communicate with spiritual beasts and the knowledge in anti-heaven crafting secrets. Even demons, beasts and gods fear the clan.Nan Xun\u2019s host body is the only daughter of the Zuili\u2019s family head. In the whole family, she is ranked ninth. Her name is Zuili Xuan. Nan Xun\u2019s vessel is a beautiful woman with a beautiful face. It is only a pity that she was as useless as an embroidered pillow.She did not inherit the ability of beast taming.On this basis, Zuili Xuan was a disgrace to the family and labeled as a waste.However, whether she can control beasts was something Nan Xun knew better than anyone. This little beauty was actually too kind-hearted, she refuses to enslave those spiritual beasts, so she prefers to be an idiot who wasn\u2019t competent.The waste was deserted by the family and was bullied by them.Although her father and mother loved her, they could not resist the coercion of the elders and the other four great clans. They could only hand her over to marry the wicked King of Demons, a red snake with four claws that made all humans, gods and beasts fearful.\u201cSmall eight, is the four-clawed red-blood snake really a snake?\u201d Nan Xun asked the void beast.\u201cYeah, you can rest assure that the demon king\u2019s body is ugly, but after his transformation, he is handsome and extraordinary as beautiful as the gods in the heavens. You know, there are countless demons who admire the demon king that they can be lined up from here all the way to the far north. You are absolutely indebted to your beauty and wisdom to be able to marry the demon king. I am waiting for the day the four-clawed red-blooded snake abandons the darkness, this Lord\u2019s merits depend on you.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s mouth twitched.All of a sudden, she really wants to hang this round void beast and beat it.

He had a vigorous tall posture, handsome, and his pair of peach blossom eyes, which were slightly raised were very attractive. It\u2019s no wonder that Zuili Xuan was coaxed to eloping with him.Today is the second day that Zuili Xuan discovers her family\u2019s plans and elopes with Qin Yuexuan. With the strong influence of the Zuili family in this world, she is afraid it won\u2019t be long until she is captured.\u201cLittle eight, what happened to the original Zuili Xuan? When I entered her body, what happened to her?\u201d Nan Xun asked.The Void Beast was silent for a while before saying: \u201cAfter three days, she will die, and I promised to help her guide her soul, so I went to her three days before her death and requisitioned her body in advance.\u201dWait!What the fuck, she seems to know what\u2019s wrong!\u201cLittle eight, are you saying that after three days I am going to die?\u201dThe void beast laughed and said, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHow did I die?\u201d How miserable was it?\u201cWell, it\u2019s all right. You ran away with wild men and rubbed against the evil king\u2019s scales. Then the evil king ate you into his stomach. As for the wild man, he was smothered by the demon king and hanged at the city\u2019s gate for seven days and seven nights, and finally dried up.\u201dNan Xun did not listen to everything. Her mind was full of the words, \u201cThe evil king ate you into his stomach,\u201d which reverberates back and forth.\u201cLittle eight, do you understand what eating is, like how I understand the meaning?\u201d Nan Xun holds onto a glimmer of hope.The Void Beast is not happy. \u201cDoes it seem like a joke? You were eaten into the bloodthirsty and cruel demon king\u2019s stomach, and he didn\u2019t even spit out your bones.\u201dNan Xun shuddered: \u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s Zuili.\u201d\u201cHey, you are Zuili now, you will be eaten by the demon king in three days. Do your best. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201dNan Xun felt tired and didn\u2019t want to talk to the Void Beast anymore.At this time, Qin Yuexuan, who killed a group of demon moon wolf beasts, came over with a bloody smell.He dares not to approach, for fear that his bloody clothes would stain the beautiful woman in front of his eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, cousin. I\u2019ve taken care of this group of demon moon wolves.\u201d Qin Yuexuan looked at her with gentle eyes full of obsession.Nan Xun smiled. \u201cCousin, I seem to hear the sound of water. Let\u2019s go and wash.\u201dQin Yuexuan stayed where he was and stupidly said: \u201cCousin, you really look good when you smile.\u201dHis voice floating.Nan Xun burst out laughing. How beautiful was she, that a smile could fascinate the other party?Qin Yuexuan walked ahead with a heavy head and light feet, his ears became redder and redder in front of Nan Xun.Nan Xun followed him, looking at his dull appearance from time to time.It didn\u2019t take long for the two to see a clear stream.Qin Yuexuan took Nan Xun upstream while he went downstream. Before he left, he told her \u201cCousin, if anything happens, call me immediately. I\u2019ll be in front of you.\u201dNan Xun ought to be fine, waiting for him to go far, she couldn\u2019t wait to walk to the shore.The water is clear and smooth as a mirror which clearly reflects her appearance.After seeing what she looked like, Nan Xun inhaled a breath of cool air and asked the void beast in her heart. \u201cLittle eight, be honest, are you actually a beauty freak?\u201dThe void beast said: \u201cLook how I treat you. I found you such a beautiful face. Even the wild man who you eloped with is a beautiful man.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s eyes looked up at the sky and rolled her eyes back. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true, going to heaven in three days.\u201dThe void beast has no heart, its fat waist twists, its small claws tilt. \u201cShort oil1, you just need to turn the tide in your favor.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bridge of the nose is upright, the tip of the nose smooth that you can see sunshine highlighting it, the lips are like peach petals, slightly opened, revealing a small slit, with the vaguely visible pink tongue inside.This is a clean and beautiful woman that people feel reluctant to get close. For fear of being close, they will tarnish the her temperament.Nan Xun blinked at the woman in the water, and so did the person in the water.\u201cOkay, don\u2019t pity yourself. Just think about how to complete your task \u2013\u201d The void beast said halfway but abruptly stopped.\u201cLittle eight? Little eight?\u201d Nan Xun called several times and did not hear the other party.Nan Xun muttered strangely and looked around for a while without noticing anything wrong.She found that her hair and face were stained with blood. Nan Xun squatted down, placed her beautiful hair into the water sideways, then hand combed it. While combing and shampooing her hair she pondered.Since her goal is to redeem the demon king, she must go to him. The present kinship is just an opportunity. Fortunately, she has one day left and can find an excuse about her elopement.After washing her long hair, Nan Xun directly bent over and sprinkled a handful of water onto her face.Beads of water slid down her cheeks, shining in the sunlight, like pearls.Suddenly, Nan Xun turned her head to see what was happening.Under a big tree not far from her, a long-eared rabbit stared at her.The rabbit has a pair of blood red eyes, dark and deep, emitting a bone-eroding gloom.Nan Xun did not notice this as her heart was completely germinated by this furry spirit.The long-eared rabbit is one of the lowest ranked spiritual beasts. It is herbivorous, which is harmless to Nan Xun. Moreover, this little guy is very furry and looks very cute.Nan Xun lifted her skirt and walked lightly over. She crouches down, and stares at the long-eared rabbit with big eyes.The long-eared rabbit did not hide, as it stayed in the same spot waiting for the woman to approach.\u201cRabbit, are you lost? Come on, come into this sister\u2019s arms, this sister will take you home.\u201d Nan Xun smiled and cajoled. She reached out and held the long-eared rabbit in her hand.The long-eared rabbit\u2019s body stiffened slightly. In a place where no one can see, a blood-red pupil flashed bloodthirsty, murderous intent.\u201cLittle eight, can I raise a pet? This long-eared rabbit is really cute, but you can rest assure that my favorite is you, you are the cutest.\u201d Nan Xun asked the void beast in her heart.It did not respond.When Nan Xun agreed, she raised the long-eared rabbit high with joy. \u201cRabbit, how about we live together in the future?\u201dThe long-eared rabbit did not care for her and seemed unable to understand what she said. It just looked at her in a quiet way with its red-blood pupils.Nan Xun did not expect it to understand. She was trying to find a small pet with little spirituality to listen to her. Otherwise, she was not familiar with this world and little eight ignored her. She was afraid that she would be suffocated before her task will be complete.Nan Xun touched the little guy\u2019s long ears and couldn\u2019t help but rub it against her face.Haha, it\u2019s so soft and comfortable, there\u2019s a pillow in the future.The ears of the long-eared rabbit droop slightly, a pair of animal pupils lowered. There is a blood-thirsty violent temper in the depths of its eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stared at the woman in front of him, she didn\u2019t know what he saw, but he suddenly turned around.\u201cCousin, I\u2019m going to make a fire. Your dress is wet, you have to dry it.\u201d After that, he walked away.Nan Xun looked down at herself. She had just washed her hair. Now her long black hair was pulled over her right shoulder. It poured down from her right shoulder like a black waterfall, the tip of her hair dropping water on the side of her waist, which soaked her clothes and vaguely showed the skin around her waist.No wonder Qin Yuexuan was scared to look.Nan Xun quickly moved the long-eared rabbit from her arms down and blocked the skin around her waist.So, the long-eared rabbit\u2019s red pupils were aligned to the spot, and the curve of the waist was fully visible.The animal pupils have no superfluous emotions, but it was deep. It was falling into a tempting place, looking at it as if it\u2019s not beautiful, but\u2026a good meal.If Nan Xun saw the long-eared rabbit\u2019s eyes now, she would be frightened and throw the rabbit far away and run.Sadly, Nan Xun did not see nor did the void beast within the bracelet told her.Qin Yuexuan lit a fire and excitedly talked to the woman opposite of him about the next arrangement.Nan Xun listened quietly, and from time to time is happy to see the long-eared rabbit\u2019s hair within her arms. She thought Qin Yuexuan is probably love drunk from Xuan, otherwise he would not reveal such a taste of shyness. Although, she felt that Qin Yuexuan is an old driver1.When the other party finished, Nan Xun looked at him and suddenly said, \u201cCousin\u2026let\u2019s go back.\u201dQin Yuexuan handsome face suddenly froze, \u201cCousin, what did you say?\u201dNan Xun replied, \u201cCousin, I\u2019m sorry, I cheated you. I don\u2019t like you. I\u2019m just too scared, so I had cousin help me to escape marriage.\u201d\u201cCousin, stop talking! I don\u2019t want to listen, I don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201dNan Xun\u2019s heart said: Big brother, you can\u2019t help but listen. If we really go on, I\u2019ll be swallowed up when the demon king finds out, then you\u2019ll become an ordinary man, it\u2019s really for your own good.So, Nan Xun ignored him and continued: \u201cCousin, if I really leave like this, I will leave the Zuili family because I am ashamed and my father\u2019s position as the head of the family may not be stable. Anyway, I am not concerned, it\u2019s life, I\u2019m alive, it\u2019s a good deal if I can sacrifice myself if we can obtain peaceful coexistence between people and demons.\u201dNan Xun, herself felt moved by her magnificent words.Qin Yuexuan\u2019s face changed, and lost control and shouted angrily: \u201cCousin, you are confused! No way! Do you know what kind of bloodthirsty monster, the King of Demon is? If you go, you must go or not!\u201dWhen he said this, the long-eared rabbit nested in Nan Xun\u2019s arms raised its eyes to him, and its pair of blood-red and thick pupils emitted an extremely angry air.Nan Xun showed a slight smile, with a sad look, as beautiful as a white lotus, \u201cSo what, if this is what everyone wants, I will do what they want, hoping that my sacrifice can really be exchange for this short-term peace they seek.\u201d\u201cNo, I won\u2019t allow you to be in danger! Cousin, you know my heart clearly, but why\u2026 Why did you suddenly change your mind?\u201dQin Yuexuan muttered, trembling twice and looking as if he had been hit hard.Nan Xun apologized again. \u201cTomorrow at dawn, let\u2019s go back. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cZuili Xuan!\u201d Qin Yuexuan called her name angrily.The man\u2019s peach blossom eyes were glazed blood-red, and he sneered. \u201cI\u2019m so heartfelt towards you, and you\u2019re so grateful to me? Use me when you need me, then leave me when you don\u2019t need me?\u201dNan Xun was frightened by his ferocious expression.Shit, she guessed that Qin Yuexuan would get hairy, but did not expect him to be angry like this.Qin Yuexuan approached her step by step, and his face became more and more cloudy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can\u2019t beat him even if I knew Taekwondo, but this world is too pitiful, I can\u2019t beat him at all, I don\u2019t want to die in this world as soon as I arrive.\u201d Nan Xun cried for half a day, but the void beast did not respond.\u201cCousin, I have something to say.\u201d Nan Xun laughed and tried to appease him.Qin Yuexuan raised his mouth and said in a very gentle and authentic tone: \u201cCousin, I want you. Wait for us to cook the rice1, you won\u2019t want to go back.\u201dNan Xun sighed in her heart. It was impossible to see that Qin Yuexuan was a beast in disguise.Nan Xun took off running without forgetting to take the long-eared rabbit.However, her opponent is Qin Yuexuan, in the Yinchuan mainland, the division of the Xuan people from lowest to highest: apprentice, master, general, king, emperor, god and holy.Each division is divided into junior, intermediate, advanced and peak.Qin Yuexuan is now a junior master, not a novice like Nan Xun.Nan Xun was thrown to the ground by the man behind her. His hand was about to explore her skirt, but the long-eared rabbit flew out of Nan Xun\u2019s arms.The long-eared rabbit flew directly to Qin Yuexuan\u2019s shoulder with its jaw and pair of sharp incisors, it plunged into Qin Yuexuan\u2019s flesh and blood.Gulu, Gulu.Nan Xun confirmed that she heard correctly. It was the sound of swallowing flesh and blood.This long-eared rabbit drank human blood in order to save her!Nan Xun was a little touched. She looked at Qin Yuexuan who had fainted. Nan Xun picked up the rabbit and ran away.Suddenly, Nan Xun hummed a few times in the night sky, releasing her spiritual strength.Momentarily, a bluebird flew down from the night sky.\u201cBuddy, can you give me a ride? I want to go back south to the Zuili family\u201dThe bluebird sounded twice and bent down.Nan Xun\u2019s heart was overjoyed and she immediately climbed up with the long-eared rabbit in her arms.Where is the waste? She is a genius beast tamer! She hummed a few words at will and could summon nearby spiritual beasts.Before long, the bluebird spread its wings and flew south.The long-eared rabbit\u2019s eyes fell on her, with a kind of inquiry hazed cloudy and cold.When she was close to home, Nan Xun said goodbye to the bluebird and travel on foot.\u201cNinth sister? Why are you here!\u201d A woman suddenly screamed.Nan Xun looked at a girl wearing a pink butterfly dress.The woman looked shock when she saw her.Nan Xun faintly glanced at her. \u201cThird sister, this is my home. Where should I be, if not here?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you elope with Cousin Yuexuan?\u201d Zuili Yuejian said. She seemed to realize what she said and immediately covered her mouth.Nan Xun slightly hooked her lips. \u201cThird sister, you can\u2019t defile people\u2019s innocence. If it is known by my father and several elders, I am afraid they will hit you with the board.\u201dFinished talking, she directly passes from the woman\u2019s side, her white dress gently rippling in the wind, bringing a faint fragrance.Zuili Yuejian, was so angry she almost bit her silver tooth2, her anger could not be vented out, she smashed her fish against the wings of the leopard.The winged leopard uttered a cry of pain, but it dares not speak out.The Zuili family is not excellent in the cultivation of Xuan, but their ability to control spiritual animals is extremely powerful. They are natural tamers, even a small Xuan can control a beast for more than a thousand years.Zuili Yuejian suddenly thought of something and could not help but sneer, \u201cIt\u2019s good to come back and marry that beast.\u201dIn her opinion, all beasts were beasts, and the king of demons is no exception.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You should have ran away a little farther, ah, you\u2019re really mad at mother!\u201dThe handsome uncle, her father, followed her mother and heard her words. He hurriedly set up a soundproof enchantment outside the house, otherwise, if the words were heard by others, they would surely suffer.Nan Xun was surprised.Did her father and mother know from the beginning that she dared eloped Qin Yuexuan?Nan Xun hung her head and whispered: \u201cNiang, if I really left, what would you and Daddy do? Anyway, it\u2019s no use leaving the Zuili family. I might as well make some contribution for the family.\u201dWhen she heard this, her tears ran down like a flood.Her father was also red-eyed. \u201cXuan\u2019Er, father is incompetent and can\u2019t protect you.\u201dNan Xun shook her head and said with tears: \u201cThere are several elders from the Zuili family and other families that are covetous. Outsiders only see Daddy\u2019s status as the head of the Zuili family. How can they ever know the bitterness in Daddy\u2019s heart? So, I don\u2019t blame father and mother, really.\u201dHer father, an old gentleman, couldn\u2019t help hearing this anymore and began to howl with his wife in his arms.Nan Xun: \u2026\u2026Her mother wanted to help her escape, but she didn\u2019t expect her to return and for Zuili Yuejian to tell the elders of her return. The elders came to see her and was at a deadlock with her father for a long time.Finally, her father watched the elders cast a powerful isolation enchantment, that not even a fly can enter.The title as the head of the Zuili family sounded noble, but in fact, her poor father was a mere puppet. He is an excellent puppet of the Zuili family as all the decision-making power of the most important matters are decided by several elders.The Xuans and Demons have been fighting for about one hundred years. At first, both sides were defeated and sustained heavy injuries. However, over time, the Demons were far more resilient than the Xuan, so they decided to prolong the truce period.Later, after the discussion between several large families, it was strategized to create an alliance.The Zuili family is the head of the five major families. In order to show sincerity, the person naturally sent should be a member of the Zuili family. But every child within the Zuili clan is capable, and the elders were reluctant.Therefore, all eyes fell on Zuili Li Xuan.She had no skill, but was the daughter of the Zuili clan, extraordinarily beautiful, the entire Zuili family couldn\u2019t find a more qualified candidate than her.In a blink of an eye, Nan Xun was left alone along with the long-eared rabbit within her arms.Perhaps the long-eared rabbit\u2019s presence was nearly non-existent since no one noticed it this entire time.Nan Xun tried to contact the void beast, but the little thing didn\u2019t respond at all and she didn\u2019t know what had happened.So, Nan Xun can only chat with the long-eared rabbit.Nan Xun ate at the same table with the long-eared rabbit and slept holding the long-eared rabbit for the past two days.On this day, Nan Xun was lying on a rocking chair with the rabbit in her arms, looking at the stars in the night sky.\u201cLittle White, I really want to drink. When I get drunk, I don\u2019t have any worries.\u201d Nan Xun muttered, rubbing the ears of the long-eared rabbit.Even when its ears were ravaged, the rabbit\u2019s response is faint. It looked sideways at the table next to it, and there was a flash of blood in its bright red eyes.In the next moment, Nan Xun pointed at the table and exclaimed.\u201cWine? How can there be a jug of wine there?\u201d Nan Xun stared at the small table in front of her, and almost stared a hole into it.At last, Nan Xun determined that she was blind and that there is a jug of wine on the table.Nan Xun hesitated for a long time and asked the long-eared rabbit, \u201cLittle White, do you think this wine is poisonous?\u201dThe long-eared rabbit glanced at her without any expression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She laughs and said, \u201cLittle white, drink with me in the bar, let\u2019s not get drunk, if it\u2019s poisonous wine, we will become companions on the Huangquan Road.1\u201dWith that, she lifted the jug and took a big drink with her head up. The drinking posture was so heroic that it was nothing like a woman.A big mouth bulged, and then picked up the long-eared rabbit, and kissed it to pour wine into the rabbit\u2019s mouth.When Nan Xun\u2019s lip petals touched the small mouth of the long-eared rabbit, it released a strong bloody atmosphere, and its pair of blood-colored rabbit eyes turned into a snake\u2019s erect vertical pupils in an instant!After a sip of wine, Nan Xun\u2019s head shook.\u201cLittle white, how is your body shaking? Are you drunk?\u201d Nan Xun made fun of the long-eared rabbit.There\u2019s a trace of emotion in the rabbit\u2019s eyes.The horrible atmosphere around him didn\u2019t make the woman feel the slightest fear?Nan Xun didn\u2019t feel it but felt that the air around her was cold. So, she held the rabbit in her arms for warmth and continued to pour wine in her other hand.The woman in a long white dress swayed and wobbly stood up. While wobbly standing, her graceful posture twisted and swayed. From time to time, she turned around in a circle, forming a charming dance, which looked as if a fairy fell into the mortal world.Spinning around and around, the wine from the jug slid down the corners of her lips and dripped to the depths of her dress.When she finished drinking, she threw the bottle randomly.Listening to the click, the woman burst into laughter. \u201cGood wine, good wine.\u201dNan Xun looked at the long-eared rabbit and gently danced with it.Shortly after, she hummed as she danced. \u201d Fly, fly, fly. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, uh\u2026\u201dAlthough it\u2019s was just ah-ah\u2019s, the ghostly voice within the empty valley is like the cleanest spring in the world, sweet to the utmost. It is like a fairy\u2019s voice, breaking through the heavy clouds and soaring into the sky.The long-eared rabbit\u2019s dead face has undergone subtle changes after hearing this ethereal chanting. The eyes of the woman became very deep, such as two deep bottomless holes.In the night, the dust-stained woman dances, humming songs that is so clean, ethereal, and boisterous.Outside the enchantment, a group of birds slowly gathered. Various kinds of birds hovered over the small courtyard, circling and dancing with the hum. The spiritual birds gathered constantly, woven into a colorful world which was as beautiful as a dream.Seeing such a scene, the rabbit\u2019s eyes moved, and broke free from her arms. In the blink of an eye, it leaped into the darkness.Nan Xun\u2019s humming stopped abruptly. \u201cLittle white, where are you going? Little white\u2014\u201dNan Xun\u2019s small face was slightly stunned and whimpered twice. \u201cLittle white with no conscience, little white hurts, hiccup!\u201dThe long-eared rabbit, who had melted into the night, heard the murmur, paused, and then continued to leap deep into the night.The long-eared rabbit hopped away. The shadow under the moonlight grew longer and wider from the small body. Finally, it turned into a tall figure.The figure stood up from the ground, and the thick black fog gathered behind the long-eared rabbit.From the black fog, a man in a black robe walked out.The man\u2019s posture is tall and straight, and black hair loosely draped over his shoulders. His face is beautiful and not cast like a demon god, he was expressionless, long eyebrows and sideburns. A pair of vertical pupils that were bloody red with no fluctuations as if giving off a gloomy feeling. His nose as tall as a jade pillar, thin lips spread tight and purple.The black cloak agitates in the night, entwined with the bloody temperament surrounding him, and the rich smell of blood spreads out instantly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But it was clear that her wishes have been dashed, because the next morning, a large group of people descended into her courtyard.Originally as the daughter of the family\u2019s head, her independent courtyard was very spacious, but after the arrival of the group, it suddenly became crowded.Several elders walked ahead, followed by her father and mother, then by a large group of servants, uncles, aunts, brothers and sisters.Nan Xun didn\u2019t know what happened. She only felt that the old man\u2019s eyes in front of her was so bright that it could eat people. Her mother and father were crying.Nan Xun was still confused when several elders spoke about the matter with great emphasis.The king of monsters and beasts actually sent a little demon as a messenger and tomorrow he will send someone to pick up the bride.Originally, the Zuili family and the other big families had wishful thinking. They had planned to bring the person to the entrance of the magic realm by a sedan chair. Then they would see whether the Demon King would accept the bride or not.They had never expected that the Demon King would send someone to pick up the bride when he learned about it.Does this mean that the Demon King is satisfied with the bride candidate?Nan Xun breathe a sigh of relief with some excitement: \u201cLittle Eight, theDemon King will come pick me up tomorrow. Does this mean I won\u2019t be eaten today? I changed the fate of Zuili Xuan from being eaten!\u201dThe void beast snorted, \u201cCongratulations, maybe you\u2019ll get eaten tomorrow? Have you forgotten all the bad things you did to the Demon King?\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cOh, baby, if I was eaten, your merits would be lost.\u201d Come on, hurt each other.The void beast wilted immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They wanted to let her know that sacrificing an individual for the benefit of the whole was a necessity to elevate the Zuili family through this marriage.Nan Xun wanted to spit on their faces.But in order not to collapse, Nan Xun quietly became a little white lotus which was not familiar with the world.That night, the enchantment outside the small courtyard increased by another layer, and a red wedding gown was sent by her mother.Her mother howled for a while, then took Nan Xun\u2019s small hand and slipped a note into it. Her voice dropped, \u201cXuan\u2019Er, this is a top-quality escape, explosive and teleport enchantment. Take it and use it when the opportunity comes.\u201dNan Xun collected and put away the things, and she couldn\u2019t help but hug the beautiful woman, and said in her heart: \u201cLittle eight, I miss my mother.\u201dThe void beast didn\u2019t pretend to be dead at last, and answered, \u201cWell, as long as you finish the task well and wait for me to gather all the merits, you can go back.\u201dNan Xun squeezed a few tears and didn\u2019t speak. She always felt that little eight was a pit, or a giant pit.\u201cLittle eight, I remember that I sang last night and gathered many spiritual beasts. Didn\u2019t anyone witness that grand occasion?\u201d Nan Xun is puzzled.A hundred birds were flying, such the wonders of the millennium, these people actually didn\u2019t see?The void beast explained, \u201cThe Demon King has isolated the courtyard from the rest of the world, so that no one else could hear except for you, him and the other birds.\u201d\u201cWhy did he do that?\u201dVoid beast: \u201cYou ask me why?\u201dNan Xun couldn\u2019t help but yell at him. \u201cDidn\u2019t you send me to this world to show me how powerful you are? It turned out that you don\u2019t even know.\u201dThe void beast began to pretend to be dead again.Early the next morning, Nan Xun woke up. A group of maids sneaked in and began to wait for Nan Xun to wash.An hour later, Nan Xun, who had been wrapped from beginning to end, looked at the beautiful and irritated bride in the mirror and couldn\u2019t help but smile. Not surprisingly, she heard an intake of breath all around.Who said that the Zuili family is all conservative old men? Look, the dress she wears is half-exposed at the chest and covered with red gauze. The most unappealing thing was that while looking at herself, it gave her a nosebleed.A big sedan chair had stopped at the entrance of the Zuili home, but the faces of the Zuili clan were ugly.Nan Xun shit herself after seeing it. This sedan chair is actually white!\u201cLittle eight, what do you think the Demon King means? Does he want to marry a dead Zuili woman?\u201d Nan Xun\u2019s voice trembled.The void beast only replied, \u201cGood luck to you.\u201dThe sedan chair is carried by an eight headed, green-eyed hell demon leopard, but there were no other monsters present.The eight pairs of green eyes fell upon Nan Xun\u2019s body, radiating a mountainous pressure.Even if only the eight headed hell demon leopard was sent as a greeting and the sedan chair was white, people did not dare to speak out in anger.Nan Xun climbed into the sedan chair and looked back to the people whose eyes were surprised, lamenting, worried or gloating about this disaster.Before she was stabilized, the eight headed demon leopard carried the white sedan chair and turned its heads. They were flying at a rapid speed as if eager to leave the womb.Although Nan Xun was always screaming and scared, she was actually a careless person. She soon fell asleep but didn\u2019t realize that she would only be able to take a nap from waking up so soon. She was no longer in the sedan chair.She laid on a long couch, the light around her was dim, and the five natural elements in the air was very thin, and the dark elements that couldn\u2019t be absorb was mysteriously abundant in this space.This should be the legendary\u2026demon domain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Obviously, they didn\u2019t care for the present human bride in front of them.Nevertheless, who is Nan Xun? No matter whether they were men or women, young or old, she will be able to integrate with them in no time.An hour later, laugher echoed throughout the palace, which was very lively.\u201cYou\u2019re a very interesting human being. Totally different from the ones I know.\u201d The maidservant called Hong Chou hid her mouth and smiled.Nan Xun blinked at her. \u201cAren\u2019t all human beings like me, with two eyes, one nose and one mouth?\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Lu Sui Ren couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cHong Chou means that many people she seen were cunning and treacherous, but you are so simple and ignorant of the world.\u201d\u201d By the way, why did you come into our magic domain?\u201d asked Lan Shui.Nan Xun picked up a red and bright fruit from the fruit tray besides her. Whatever it was, she bit into it and swung her legs and replied back at Lan Shui with a smile: \u201cOh, my sister Lan Shui couldn\u2019t guess, I came to play a beautiful trick. If the evil king could like me, I could blow pillow wind for him1, so that the evil king would not attack the human race, then the human race and demons can coexist peacefully.\u201d\u201cCough! Cough\u2026\u201d Several people choked.Lan Shui immediately knocked her head. \u201cYou really answered my question, remember, these kinds of words must not be heard by others, otherwise you will die.\u201dThe other three nodded hurriedly in succession and gave advice.Nan Xun laughed and said: \u201cI have to follow the teachings of several beautiful sisters.\u201dHong Chou said with a delicate smile: \u201cYour little mouth is smeared with honey.2 Nevertheless, forget it. Compared to you, we are not beautiful.\u201dA few people make a lot of noise, chattering about gossip every day, and in a twinkling of an eye, a month has passed.Nan Xun hugged her chin and looked out the palace\u2019s door.\u201cLu Sui Ren, since the Demon King has brought me back, why doesn\u2019t he come to see me? How can I seduce him when he doesn\u2019t see me?\u201d Nan Xun asked, blinking her big black eyes.Boom.In the pitch-black hall, the Demon King sat crooked on the black king\u2019s chair, holding a delicate cup of wine in his hand. Somehow, the Demon King was stunned, and with little effort in his hand, the good wine cup was crushed.The mellow wine flowed down his long fingers and overflowed the room with its fragrance.After a pause, he went on drinking expressionlessly.3The beast standing outside the temple couldn\u2019t hear her voice, so they repeated their statement. \u201cWang4 it\u2019s been a month now. What are you going to do with that woman? Are you going to suck her dry and hang her in the human city?\u201dThe Demon King married the human woman but treated her like air for a month. All the beasts and demons thought that the Demon King was humiliating the human race, but they preferred the direct and bloody way of humiliation. So, they couldn\u2019t wait to send a little demon to ask.The Demon King looked at him coldly and said, \u201cWhen was it your turn to talk about Benwang\u2019s5 affairs?\u201dThe beast fell onto his knees with a loud plop, \u201cMy mistake!\u201dThe Demon King\u2019s blood-red eyes narrowed slightly, his big palm turned the cup in his hands playfully, and he didn\u2019t know what to think.

It seems that it was the time he devoured the previous Demon King alive.\u2026It\u2019s no wonder Lu Sui Ren heard Nan Xun\u2019s words.Despite the innocence and pureness of this girl, these rash words were said. What\u2019s more, it\u2019s impossible to blame this girl when she had an innocent expression and clear eyes when she said that.They immediately felt that it was because they were so dirty, that\u2019s why their thoughts were dirty.Anyway, no matter what Nan Xun did or said, once the four people looked up at her pair of clean as the mountains and clear springs eyes, they couldn\u2019t say a single word.\u201cAh, Xun Xun1, the Demon King is busy with his official duties.

The Demon King left me cold, it has saved my life for a while, but he hasn\u2019t seen me yet, what should I do? What about my task? How can I help you purify the Demon King\u2019s heart?The void beast ignored her.Nan Xun sighed leisurely, shouldering her heavy responsibilities.\u201cIt\u2019s boring to be idle, why don\u2019t we play hide-and-seek?\u201d Lu Sui Ren saw her so sad and tried to divert her attention.Nan Xun has already changed from her red bridal dress to her favorite white dress, clean and spotless.Only this time, her eyes were covered with a red silk ribbon. White with red has a different flavor.The silk ribbon is Lu Sui Ren, it was tied tightly on Nan Xun, she was stunned and couldn\u2019t see a shred of light.To be honest, there are few entertainment methods in the ancient times, let alone an ancient time with the human race, spiritual beasts, and demons. They can only play hide and seek, catch birds and butterflies, and so on. But Nan Xun is so moldy that they play hide and seek.Nan Xun extended her hands and felt all around.She doesn\u2019t know which bad girl poked her waist and which touched her little hand.\u201cBad girls, dare to tease me. When I catch you, I\u2019ll kiss you and see if you dare!\u201d Nan Xun laughed and yelled.At first, there was a lot of laughter. But, suddenly the air around her was quiet for a moment. Nan Xun felt something was wrong. She tried to pull the ribbon off her eyes but at this time heard footsteps.Then, Nan Xun\u2019s mouth bent. \u201cI thought I wouldn\u2019t know where you were.\u201dAfter that, she rushed forward, and hugged the person in front of her. Then, with her small mouth pouted, she kissed and made a loud \u201cmuah\u201d sound.However \u2013Instead of kissing the other on the cheek, the kiss fell on\u2026on a chin.\u201cHiss~\u201dThere were several exhalations, and a cold air spread instantly, causing people to shiver from the cold.Nan Xun\u2019s heart leaped.At this moment, it\u2019s silly of her not to know that she\u2019s holding a man, but the whole series of actions already had occurred. By the time she discovered something was wrong, her little mouth already planted a kiss.\u201cLittle eight, I am screwed! Nine times out of ten, this person is the Demon King. I live in his house, but I have made fun of him!\u201dIn addition to the legendary bloodthirsty and cruel Demon King, I\u2019m afraid there is no other person here!Also\u2026her host body is Zuili Xuan so it should be Xuan Xuan\u2026maybe she told them her surname is Xun?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Whether it was his eyes or purple lips, these unusual features could not hide his beauty. The curvature of his jaw was just right, more would have made it slightly feminine, and less would have been too masculine. When he looks at you, you could clearly feel a bone-eroding cold, like a moth fighting fire, you still want to feel his eyes on you more.Like little eight, Nan Xun is a hardcore appearance freak. She likes everything beautiful including people, but its only limited to like, she doesn\u2019t have any other feelings.So now she looks at the man with total undisguised glamour, without the slightest obsession with obscenity.\u201cYou look so good.\u201d Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but sigh.The person next to her sucked in cold air with a \u201chiss~\u201dNan Xun has a problem. When she sees something beautiful, her courage will fatten several folds. Then she will die all kinds of ways and others can\u2019t stop her.At this moment, she appreciates the beautiful man in front of her, completely free from her shackles of fears.After Nan Xun\u2019s death, the four maidservants, Lu Sui Ren, Hong Chou, Lan Shui and Zi Ling were all dead and slammed knelt to the ground, shaking themselves into sieves.They wanted to remind Nan Xun, but they don\u2019t dare. They are still greedy for life and afraid to die before matters of vital importance.The man in front of her wore a black robe with the waist tied and a cloak wrapped around him. The collar and cuffs were embroidered with dark gold stripes, which made him looked noble and unparalleled.His handsome face was as expressionless as ever, and the red eyes seemed to flicker with a trace of emotion, fleetingly.\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d The man asked, with a deep voice carrying a hint of coolness.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help muttering: \u201cEven the voice is so good.\u201dShe twisted the silk red ribbon in her hands with her fingers. Then looked at him with her dark and bright eyes and laughed, \u201cWho can come and go here at ease except for the Demon King in the rumors?\u201d\u201cThen you know, no one in this world dares to look directly at Benwang?\u201d The Demon King said, there was no fluctuations in his voice and no emotions could be heard.Hong Chou knelt on her knees and felt unbearable. She asked in a low voice, \u201cWang, please calm your anger. Xun Xun didn\u2019t understand the rules. She didn\u2019t intentionally mean to offend wang.\u201dThe Demon King did not look at her, but at the next moment, a mouthful of blood came out of Hong Chou\u2019s mouth and her body completely collapsed. It seemed that an invisible force was pressing on her.Nan Xun\u2019s face changed, \u201cHong Chou!\u201dSuddenly she stared at the Demon King, angry and exasperated, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I look directly? You can\u2019t see anyone or what? You look so good, why can\u2019t I look more? If you don\u2019t like me to look at you in the future, I will not look at you, you blame others for what!\u201dAfter a long time, the Demon King\u2019s lips were squeezed even tighter and narrowed his eyes slightly. Then suddenly asked something that wasn\u2019t even related like cows to horses. \u201cDon\u2019t you think benwang\u2019s blood-red pupils is frightening?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just red eyes? What\u2019s scary? You can give it to me if you don\u2019t want them.\u201dAt this moment, the surroundings were quiet.Dead silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t speak and Nan Xun didn\u2019t speak.Suddenly, the Demon King waved his hand at the four people behind the woman and murmured, \u201cYou all retreat.\u201dHong Chou still wants to say something but was dragged away by Lan Shui.There is only one human woman, even if there is some regret, they don\u2019t have the ability to intervene. They only hope that the Demon King is in a better mood today and would keep her body whole.When the people all retired, the tall body of the Demon King suddenly slammed forward, his black shadow completely wrapped Nan Xun inside.Nan Xun subconsciously stepped back two steps, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLater, she responded sensibly. At present, this man is beautiful, but he is the Demon King who eats people without blinking!Shit, did she say something?\u201cNow you know how to be scared?\u201d The Demon King laughed and stretched his long arm around her waist and held her tightly as if he could break her waist with little effort.Nan Xun, who was short-circuited in her brain, quickly raised her hands and hugged his neck to death. She nodded dully and out of her mouth jumped the word, \u201cfear.\u201dThe Demon King\u2019s body stiffened slightly, and his eyes deepened.\u201cAfraid to dare provoke me, huh?\u201d The man in front of her suddenly opened his mouth, and the corners of his mouth slightly picked up, creating a charming arc.\u201cI\u2019m just telling you the truth. If you are angry, I won\u2019t say these things in the future. Can you not eat me?\u201d Nan Xun looked at him pitifully with her small appearance.\u201cWhy do you take advantage and put your arms around benwang\u2019s neck when you are afraid?\u201d The man\u2019s plain words carried an imperceptible smile.Very light, very shallow, and fleeting.Nan Xun hugged his neck tighter and tighter, with her words trembling, \u201cI\u2019m holding on tight, so when you eat me later, I won\u2019t see you eat me, and maybe I can take the opportunity to bite your neck.\u201dThat\u2019s a compelling reason.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t eat you for the time being.\u201d The Demon King picked up his eyebrow slightly and said.But Nan Xun noticed the word \u201ctime being\u201d, so sooner or later he would eat her?Nan Xun was so afraid and tried to call little eight, but little eight didn\u2019t say a word.She quickly buried her face in the man\u2019s neck, revealing a row of small white teeth grinding there. \u201cWell, please let me know in advance when you want to eat me. I will bite you a few times. I am the kind of person that\u2019s not willing to go down without a struggle.\u201dThe Demon King looked at the woman for a long time and felt her heat from his neck. His eyes darkened a little.His gaze slightly moved down and fell on the woman\u2019s exquisite body, and his eyes couldn\u2019t help but squint.Nan Xun hollowly laugh loudly, trying to divert attention, and asked: \u201cWell, I\u2019m in good shape, aren\u2019t I?\u201dThe Demon King suddenly tightened his arms and a pair of blood-red eyes gazed at Nan Xun, \u201cYou, woman is really\u2026.\u201dShe was scared to death and held on tighter.He couldn\u2019t see through this woman.Nan Xun hugged his neck and stared at the bloody red eyes. Her face suddenly loosened, and her eyebrows curved: \u201cIt is rumored that you have a green face and three heads and six arms, so when I first knew I was going to marry you, I was terrified. I didn\u2019t think you would be so beautiful, if I\u2019m going to die sooner or later, I\u2019m no longer afraid.\u201dThe Demon King did not bring up her attempt to escape the marriage. He looked at her for a moment and said coldly, \u201cI heard\u2026you want to seduce benwang?

It\u2019s no wonder that little eight been silent.

She actually heard a hint of ridicule from the Demon King\u2019s words.\u201cAh!\u201d Nan Xun suddenly exclaimed.However, one person was walking while the other was carried princess style!Nan Xun shrank in fright but leaned closer to him.\u201cYou, what are you going to do?\u201d Nan Xun trembled and asked.The Demon King\u2019s thin lips slightly picked up with a beautiful curvature and his voice was still silent. \u201cGo back to the house and help you to seduce.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026As the saying goes, she can\u2019t live from her own misdeeds, she wants to die.Nan Xun has forgotten how many bold words she has spoken within the past month. Does this voyeuristic Demon King remember them all in his heart?If so\u2026hehe.On the bed, a man and a woman sat face to face.The handsome, expressionless man looked at the woman and waited for her actions.Nan Xun sought advice from the void beast within her heart, \u201cLittle eight, how do I seduce him?\u201dAt last, the void beast stopped pretending to play dead. At the risk of being perceived by the Demon King, it whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, give all kinds of hugs, kisses, rubs and licks.\u201dNan Xun: \u201c\u2026I feel like I\u2019m losing my night.\u201dVoid beast: \u201cDon\u2019t talk too much, come on!\u201dNan Xun swallowed and whispered to the man in front of her in a low voice: \u201cYou really want me to\u2026 seduce you?\u201dThe Demon King sounded, and the blood red eyes were thick and deep.\u201cNo matter what I do, you won\u2019t be angry?\u201d Nan Xun asked.The Demon King affirmed again.\u201cWell, then I will\u2026 start?\u201d\u201cUn.\u201dNan Xun watched the man half-sounded, then slowly gathered herself together and gave him a quick peck on his thin lips.The man\u2019s face is expressionless.Nan Xun was fat and courageously kissed him, his two eyes, and then the tip of his nose.The man is still expressionless.Nan Xun\u2019s trembling hands reached towards the man\u2019s waist and loosed the belt, then her two small hands slid inside.The chest is hard, the skin is very smooth and cool.Nan Xun was a little hot, her face beet red, then she pulled down the other\u2019s robe from his upper body. The whole person embraced the other with her hot face pressed against his chest, according to little eight, she rubbed her face against him.Thump, thump, thump.She heard the heartbeat of the other party, and it was particularly powerful.Then at some point, the thumps were getting heavier, louder and faster.Nan Xun felt incredulous, and she suddenly noticed a wetness on her neck and looked.Nan Xun almost fainted.A long serpent tongue popped out of the man\u2019s mouth and was licking her neck. A wet trail was soon licked on her neck.\u201cOh, shit! I\u2019m going to be eaten by the Demon King! He\u2019s licking my neck, see? Fuck! He\u2019s licking my neck! Is he going to eat me?\u201d Nan Xun was so frightened that her liver and gallbladder cracked.Sure enough, in the next moment Nan Xun heard the man\u2019s voice sounding from above, \u201cBenwang is out of control, benwang never allowed this to happen before, so benwang feels that it is better to eat you directly.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let\u2019s run away!\u201d Nan Xun screamed in horror in her heart.The void beast whispered quickly, \u201cDon\u2019t give up. There\u2019s still a chance. You must try to make him feel better physically and mentally than the temptation of flesh and blood. Come on, hurry up, you\u2019re going to be eaten if you delay any longer!\u201dIn a hurry, the void beast continued to play dead.Then Nan Xun\u2019s brain paste, although she had died once before and was less afraid of death, but she really didn\u2019t want to be eaten alive, this method of death is too torturous.So, Nan Xun threw the man down on the bed, kissed his lips without saying a word, and bitterly bit him randomly. Her little hands wandered upon the man and gradually moved downwards.The man\u2019s chest fluttered up and down, and at some point, he inhaled a sharp breath of cool air.At last, he gave up the idea of devouring Nan Xun and placed his big palm on the back of her head and wrapped his lips on her pink lips and sucked them fervently.\u201cWoman, you don\u2019t want to be happy. It\u2019s useless to regret later.\u201d He said between his lips and teeth and then flipped and pressed the woman under him.Nan Xun suddenly felt a chill on her body. Her dress was grabbed by the man\u2019s big hand. In a twinkling of an eye, it ripped into pieces.In the next moment, Nan Xun stared in horror.There was a tragic scream in the room. It was sad to hear and brought tears to those who listened.The bed beneath was sturdy and didn\u2019t know what to do. It squeaked and jumped, from high to low, from fast to slow. At last, a fierce sound was heard, and it collapsed.Lu Sui Ren and a few people felt the Demon King\u2019s aura left, and quickly rushed to the room, hoping to collect Nan Xun\u2019s whole body. There was no one on the bed, but the remains of a tattered skirt scattered at the foot of the bed.The bed was collapsed with a puddle of blood visible.Hong Chou wiped her tears, \u201cI\u2019m afraid Xun Xun was swallowed by the Demon King.\u201dThe other three couldn\u2019t help but turn their eyes to herLan Shui: \u201cHong Chou, don\u2019t you smell it?\u201dHong Chou nodded and continued to cry. \u201cOf course, it smells of blood! You guys have no heart, Xun Xun was our sister for more than a month. Now she was eaten by the Demon King, you\u2019re not sad at all!\u201dZi Ling couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly the smell of lust. I\u2019m afraid the Demon King has spoiled Xun Xun. We\u2019ll call her Mrs. Xun in the future.\u201dHong Chou opened her mouth wide and exclaimed: \u201cHow is this possible? The Demon King has never had any luck with women!\u201dSeeing that the three people had the same expressions, Hong Chou asked, \u201cWhere is Xun Xun? Why is she missing?\u201dLu Sui Ren hid her smile and laughed. \u201cNaturally, the Demon King didn\u2019t have enough. He took the girl back to his bedroom to continue.\u201d\u201cBut no one has ever stepped into the king\u2019s domain!\u201d Hong Chou was surprised again.Soon after, Hong Chou believed the words of the other people, because the next morning, Nan Xun laid on her newly changed bed, her face pale.Several people looked and were shocked.The woman\u2019s original silky white skin is full of blue and purple bruise marks, it was dense and looked horrible.They were both happy and sad.Don\u2019t say that the Demon King never let anyone step into his palace, this woman was actually an exception!But seeing the tragic appearance of the woman, people couldn\u2019t help but express their worries.Man is no better than a beast.The person\u2019s body is too weak, so how can it withstand the excessive demands of the Demon King?Several people hurriedly waited for Nan Xun to bathe and change clothes. After washing and cleaning, Nan Xun laid in bed with a lifeless look.\u201cLittle eight, that man in bed, he treated me like a rag doll and threw me.\u201dThe void beast can talk now, because the pervert has stopped monitoring Nan Xun at last.\u201cYou should be thankful, because I gave you advice, the Demon King didn\u2019t eat you.\u201dNan Xun gave a loud cry and looked up with empty eyes. She cried in her heart, \u201cLittle eight, I\u2019m not clean. People didn\u2019t even have time to talk about love before. As a result, when they came here, they didn\u2019t have anything\u20261\u201dThe void beast calmly comforted her. \u201cThis body is not yours. No matter what happens, your soul is very clean. You can think of this as a game, when the task is completed, the game is over, you can return to the real world.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cReally!\u201dThe void beast doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s talking about, but it persuaded her, it allowed Nan Xun to set herself free. It was both gratifying and gave a headache.\u201cThere are two good news. First, the blackening value of the Demon King is only 80, which means he hasn\u2019t completely blackened. The second is that the evil value of the Demon King has dropped from 100 to 95.\u201d At this time, the void beast saw that Nan Xun was in a bad mood and quickly diverted her attention.Nan Xun choked on her spit when she heard that, but she couldn\u2019t help but poke at the villain in her heart. \u201cI was reduced to a rag doll by him, and the evil value was actually lowered by 5?\u201dBut Nan Xun quickly rejoiced, \u201cLittle eight, does this mean that I can eliminate his evil value after being brewed 19 times in the Demon King\u2019s sauce?\u201dThe void beast was silent for a while and replied: \u201cYou can try it.\u201dThe old virgin just started eating meat, not to mention that the Demon King has not tasted a female in over ten thousand years.That same evening, Nan Xun\u2019s tragic blue and purple strawberries had not disappeared and several girls that were laughing with her silently retreated.The next moment, the void in front of her eyes distorted, and the handsome man wearing a black robe looked angry and appeared suddenly in front of her.Before Nan Xun finished drinking a mouthful of tea, she was carried directly to the palace for the first time.The surroundings were dark and only some night pearls were embedded in the walls, illuminating the darkness, it gave a faint green and ghostly look.Nan Xun didn\u2019t like it very much, and she was very shy when she did it.Today\u2019s Demon King is very quiet. After seeing her, he didn\u2019t say a word and directly destroyed her clothes and pressed onto her.A broken moan flowed from Nan Xun\u2019s mouth. She quickly covered her mouth and didn\u2019t want to disturb the man on her body. \u201cDon\u2019t hold it, benwang likes to listen.\u201dThe man\u2019s voice is particularly low and hoarse, Nan Xun has never heard his voice like this before.Nan Xun\u2019s big eyes were full of water and felt wronged: \u201cNext time, don\u2019t destroy my clothes, it\u2019s a pity.\u201dThe man paused and whispered in her ear, \u201cWell, next time benwang will gift you some more.\u201d After that, his actions became more and more erratic.Nan Xun was tossed around by the man, her body became soft and muddied, the whole person becoming empty.Afterwards, she was eaten thoroughly by the man and embraced back to her palace.When Lu Sui Ren and a few people bathed Nan Xun, they saw the kiss marks all over the woman\u2019s entire body, blue and purple, which were eye-catching. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine how fierce the fight was.TL Note: That\u2019s actually quite disturbing, I never heard of being brewed in someone\u2019s sauce\u2026kind of nasty imagery there. Nan Xun has a perverted mouth she deserves to be treated like a rag doll.What she means in this sentence was that while she was alive, she was a virgin and was never in a relationship. Then after she entered this world, she doesn\u2019t have anything aka she was defiled and no long has a \u201cpure\u201d soul/virginity. She\u2019s just referring to herself as the third person, not sure if this meant to be funny.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time I took revenge. His back was scratched by my nails, he should be bleeding. His pain is not much lighter than mine.\u201dSeveral people were frightened by her words.That\u2019s the Demon King! How dare this girl made the Demon King bleed! Doesn\u2019t she know how precious the Demon King\u2019s blood is?!Nan Xun is lying in the tub resting against the top, unable to resist asking the void beast, \u201cLittle eight, did his evil value decreased?\u201dThe void beast was listless, \u201cDecrease, the evil value is 94.\u201dNan Xun smiling face is stiff. \u201cWhat? Management and labor worked so hard to serve him for so long, why is it only one point less?\u201dThe void beast explained: \u201cThe second time is certainly not as good as the first time.\u201dNan Xun sighed and accepted this fact, \u201cOne point at a time, it will accumulate.\u201dBecause the first time was a hit, two days after Nan Xun inevitably didn\u2019t put in effort, until the void beast told her that the evil value only dropped by 1 point. She was so scared that she no longer dared to slack off.However, in just a few days, Nan Xun and the Demon King\u2019s body reached an unprecedented level of incompatibility.Nan Xun knows the Demon King\u2019s unsatisfaction, because his words were less, and his expression was once more indifferent.Nan Xun doesn\u2019t care as long as the other\u2019s evil value falls.The days of such shamelessness and impatience lasted for more than a month, and the Demon King\u2019s evil value dropped from 94 to 85 and did not change.Nan Xun is worried.The Void Beast is very calm and comforts her. \u201cNo hurry, in the wuxia world, human beings can increase their lifespan by practicing Xuan. Although the beasts have no talent in practicing Xuan, they know many magic secrets and some ways to increase longevity. You still have a long way to go.\u201dHowever, Nan Xun was not comforted.The Demon King favored a human woman on a daily basis. This matter has already spread throughout the demon domain. She doesn\u2019t know what the Demon King said. Those monsters who hate human beings have not regarded her.Nan Xun asked the void beast why.The void beast replied, \u201cOh, well, because the Demon King said to all that were present, you were just a plaything. Once he gets tired of playing, he will devour you and declare war on humanity.\u201dNan Xun fought a chill, \u201cA good move from a ruthless scum male.\u201dHowever, how much hatred do they have? Why must the beasts go against humanity?The void beast also explained, \u201cIt\u2019s people who killed themselves. A long time ago, there were only beasts and gods who fought against each other. But the beasts were outnumbered, with the humans mixed into the fight, many beasts were slain in the hands of the humans. Now the hatred of the human race is greater than the gods.\u201dNan Xun listened to little eight and they talked about the beasts, the human race and she had a deeper understanding of this world.For example, the Demon King is a four-clawed red blood serpent which is actually a variant of the god beast, Divine Serpent, but this variant is naturally bloodthirsty and cruel. It is regarded as a different species by the Divine Serpent and was ruthlessly expelled by the Divine Serpent clan and finally degenerated to a savage ancient beast.For example, the Qinglong, now the head of the four great beasts, has long been a mortal enemy of the Divine Serpent.In order to compete for the position of the Great Beast, in order to extend their offspring lifespan, the Qinglong has cross-bred with many chaotic deities and beasts and gave birth to a variety of dragon beasts, such as the black dragon, yellow dragon, and blue dragon.Among them, the most pure and noble clan is the Five-clawed Golden Dragon, which can be called the noble amongst the dragons.Nowadays, the number of dragon beasts within the Qinglong clan is considerable, and the momentum has long overtaken the self-righteous Divine Serpent.\u201cThings are precious because they are scarce. It\u2019s time for dragons to engage in family planning.\u201d Nan Xun commented.The Void Beast said, \u201cThe dragon beasts have already become purple, they are all over the place and are very shameless.\u201d1In the evening, Nan Xun was beaten by the Demon King, while in the daytime, she gossips with little eight, her life was easygoing.Suddenly, two days later the Demon King no longer favor Nan Xun and she was very surprised.Nan Xun asked Lu Sui Ren how many were there.Finally, Hong Chou was indignant and arrogant: \u201cSeveral old things in the demon domain have heard that the Demon King is close to a woman. He has found a lot of glamorous beasts within his domain. At this time, wang naturally cannot remember the lady. I also heard that last night, wang had many women and the entire palace was filled with cries of those despicable whores, I was so angry!\u201dAfter listening, Nan Xun had some mixed feelings, \u201cLittle eight, men, ah, indeed only think with their lower bodies like animals.\u201dVoid beast: \u201cThe Demon King is a beast, a serpent. Have you ever heard of snake sex?\u201d2Nan Xun suddenly had nothing to say.However, Nan Xun is not sad, but feels relieved. These days, she could not reduce the Demon\u2019s Kings evil value by brewing in his sauce. She took this opportunity to think of other methods.How can a bloodthirsty and brutal beast King discover the truth, the goodness and beauty of the world?Nan Xun thinks day and night and eats a lot less.This falls in the eyes of Hong Chou, the tea does not think about rice3.Hong Chou is not worthy of her, day after day, she praises her that there is no other woman that can be compared to her.Nan Xun felt that the Hong Chou brain circuit was really strange. Fortunately, she had no feelings for the Demon King. She would vomit blood on the spot if she knew Hong Chou thought she loves the Demon King.In order to make her happy, Lu Sui Ren gave her two sprouting beasts from who knows where.The spiritual beast is called a Zhi Shou beast. It\u2019s fluffy, white, and cuter than the long-eared rabbit.Nan Xun named them Da Bai and Xiao Bai4.\u201cHong Chou, Da Bai, Xiao Bai. I have just dug this grass, they will definitely like it.\u201d Nan Xun held lush green grass in her hand.Hong Chou\u2019s face was iron-clad and looked like a steel tunnel5: \u201cMadame, when is it? How come you only know how to play with beasts? Wang has not come for a long time!\u201dLan Shui immediately pulled her aside and whispered: \u201cEnough! Don\u2019t mention these things in front of the lady, don\u2019t you think her face is not ugly enough?\u201dNan Xun waved her hand unconcerned. \u201cNothing is wrong, Hong Chou is afraid of me falling out of favor, but I\u2019m not in a hurry. It\u2019s better to do what I like.\u201dHong Chou stamped her feet in anger.Da Bai and Xiao Bai suddenly disappeared, and several people looked for them separately.Lu Sui Ren didn\u2019t know what she saw, but suddenly screamed, people who heard the sound immediately headed towards it.Dai Bai and Xiao Bai originally cute, fluffy and white became two pieces of skin, lying in the shade of the tree, where their blood was drained dry and their flesh eaten whole.The four maidservants looked at one person in silence.She was afraid. She didn\u2019t know when the Demon King arrived but saw her two spiritual beasts. They were not pleasing in the Demon King\u2019s eyes and he devoured them directly.She looked at the two pieces of skin soaked with blood, her eyes saw darkness and she fainted.I think the Demon King was trying to get her jealous by sleeping with others. Not sure if he slept with them since Hong Chou only heard sounds\u2026could be him swallowing them whole\u2026ahaha such a coincidence that little and big white were eaten after Nan Xun said that she wasn\u2019t in a rush for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How do you remember me?\u201dIt\u2019s a simple doubt, but it sounds sour when it\u2019s heard by the other person. It sounded as if she was jealous and blaming the man in front of her.The Demon King watched her slight movements, and his eyes flickered with emotions.\u201cYou\u2019re pregnant.\u201d The Demon King suddenly opened his mouth.Nan Xun was dumbfounded, then her eyes widened as if she was foolish.When she has yet to realize the joy of motherhood, the Demon King suddenly brought a bowl of black medicine to her and ordered with a deadpan face, \u201cDrink it.\u201dNan Xun looked at the black medicine that exudes a bitter flavor and stupidly asked, \u201cWhat is this? A fetus strengthening broth?\u201dThe Demon King didn\u2019t speak but licked his thin lips. What complex emotions were there at the bottom of his eyes?Several people looked at Nan Xun and trembled and knelt onto the ground. After hearing the Demon King\u2019s words, they shook.Nan Xun suddenly understood, this is not a beneficial broth, but an\u2026 abortion.Nan Xun stared at the man in front of her and looked down with tears falling. She cried and asked, \u201cDo I have to drink?\u201dThe Demon King looked at her, cold and ruthless: \u201cYou can\u2019t have benwang\u2019s child.\u201dThen Nan Xun didn\u2019t answer but took the medicine bowl and drank with her head up. She loosened her hands and smashed the bowl on the floor with a bang.She didn\u2019t notice the Demon King\u2019s clenched fists and his palms dripping with blood.\u201cLittle eight, my heart is bitter, this child I didn\u2019t want. I am a wandering soul and can\u2019t leave my child behind in any worlds, but I feel guilty when I think that I\u2019ve killed my unborn child.\u201d Nan Xun looks down and looks mournful.She wouldn\u2019t have abandoned her unborn child if it wasn\u2019t for the Demon King\u2019s bowl of abortion medicine.\u201cIn just a few months, I experienced a big marriage, a pregnancy and an abortion, ha ha\u2026\u201d The last sentence is full of vicissitudes.The void beast replied to her. \u201cIn this world you have suffered and tasted all its bitterness, once we leave this world behind, we will be able to navigate more easily. This was my mistake, and I promise that it will not happen again in future missions.\u201d\u201cLittle eight, you actually talked, don\u2019t you fear that the Demon King will find you?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201che is in a state of uncertainty right now and he isn\u2019t paying attention to anything else.\u201dAfter watching Nan Xun drink the medicine, the Demon King left. His figure looked bleak and Nan Xun didn\u2019t care about him. She twisted her head and closed her eyes.The Demon King\u2019s abortion medicine is really good medicine. She didn\u2019t feel any pain when she drank it and strangely, her spirits felt better.Suddenly she heard a strange sound, Nan Xun opened her eyes and looked. She was shock with what she saw.Hong Chou buttocks was pasted on the ground, she was sticking out her tongue and licking the ground!\u201cHong, Hong Chou, what are you doing?\u201d Nan Xun looked like a ghost.Zi Ling next to her coughed softly and explained: \u201cWhen the Demon King left, a few drops of blood fell from the palms of his hands, and Hong Chou noticed and immediately went to lick it.\u201dLu Sui Ren said regretfully in an authentic tone: \u201cFortunately I was lucky enough for the Demon King to give me a drop, and I was able to take shape.\u201d\u201cBlood, I just saw the blood dripping on the ground, and thought about taking a bottle to collect it, but Hong Chou moves so fast!\u201d She gave Hong Chou a hateful look.The corner of Nan Xun\u2019s mouth is drawn and she only saw Lan Shui who was still normal.Lan Shui smiled embarrassingly and explained: \u201cMadam, don\u2019t you know that the Demon King\u2019s blood contains powerful magic power? The entire demon realm is eager to get a drop of the Demon King\u2019s blood. But I have not seen anyone who has made the Demon King bleed except for himself.\u201dNan Xun nodded and didn\u2019t ask why the Demon King was bleeding. She was in a bad moon and quickly slept with her quilt.Lan Shui gave Lu Sui Ren a look and several people quietly retreated.\u201cThe reason why the Demon King refused to let Madam have the child was because he was afraid that the child will take Madam\u2019s life\u2026\u201d One of the four maids muttered in a low voice.For several months, the Demon King did not come to visit Nan Xun\u2019s small hall. He heard that Nan Xun enjoys singing, drinking wine and living her days in luxury.\u201cShit, the Demon King\u2019s evil value suddenly dropped to 10!\u201d The Void Beast suddenly roared with shock and frightened Nan Xun who was eating melon seeds.Nan Xun is happy, but at the same time puzzled. \u201cHow could it suddenly drop so much? Could it be that the Demon King suddenly figured out something?\u201dIt\u2019s common knowledge that the Demon King is very stingy, before she worked so hard with him to brew soy sauce, but at most he dropped 5 points, and then a pitiful 1 point, then 0.5 points. Then it suddenly dropped down to 10 points, which is unprecedented!Nan Xun suddenly clapped her hands. \u201cI know. It is said that during this period, the Demon King was able to enjoy a number of women day and night. He is probably greatly satisfied physically and mentally. He just discovered ecstasy in the world, so his evil value plummet.The void beast nodded approvingly. \u201cShould we find him more beautiful women then?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not worry about it. Those old demons in the demon realm must have found almost all the beauties and beasts in the entire realm, it will be enough to fascinate him for a while.\u201dNan Xun was in a good mood and couldn\u2019t help but hum a song. \u201cF\u0101 f\u0113i f\u01ce, f\u0101 wa f\u0113i f\u01ce, f\u0101 wa f\u0101\u2026\u201d1\u201cThis song is so sad.\u201d Hong Chou couldn\u2019t help but rub her sour eyes and look at Nan Xun with a new perspective.Lu Sui Ren sighed a few times, Madam has begun to enjoy wallowing in self-misery.\u201dThat night, Nan Xun had a dream. She first smelled mellow wine, and then couldn\u2019t help but get closer to the delicious wine. She gently moved closer and sipped from the place that was soft and cold.Finally, she licked her mouth and smiled slyly. \u201cIt\u2019s so sweet, oh\u2026\u201dThe surrounding atmosphere suddenly became hot, the temperature almost searing was suffocating Nan Xun who was entrapped in its heat.Her breathe was taken away, her body alternated between hot and cold\u2026The next morning, Nan Xun looked at her face that was blue and purple and was confused.\u201cLittle eight, did the Demon King visit last night?\u201dThe void beast nodded. \u201cI only know that he was present. I don\u2019t know what happened. Anytime my eyes get too spicy from watching, it\u2019s automatically blocked. Besides, I\u2019m afraid to watch the scene, if I stare for too long, he will find me.\u201dNan Xun asked, \u201cDo you think the Demon King is sick? He already has so many beautiful beasts, so why is he trying to provoke me?\u201dThe void beast snorted, \u201cI thought about it, it\u2019s because your vessel is what he naturally craves, so he\u2026. has an endless taste?\u201dNan Xun: \u2026No idea what she was humming.

I just measured the Demon King\u2019s evil value and it actually lost 5 points, now it\u2019s at 70 points!\u201dNan Xun\u2019s heard the news, her eyes brightened, thinking it was a matter of time within the near future the evil value will be 0.She is in a good mood and her appetite improved and pleased others.For a few days, every night, the Demon King will secretly sneak into Nan Xun\u2019s small hall and hold Nan Xun and embrace her to death.Nan Xun wanted to open her eyes and grasp the situation, but somehow, she clearly feels the other side. She couldn\u2019t open her eyes and couldn\u2019t do anything but moan.Nan Xun is sulking.After climbing the bed every night with the Demon King, on the second day, she still heard news that the Demon King\u2019s nights were filled with the songs of joy and bewitching beasts. Only then did Nan Xun realized that it was all a bluff and the Demon King didn\u2019t spoil any others besides her.\u201cXun Xun.\u201d The man\u2019s low and hoarse voice, mellow with an alcoholic smell was gently sounded and slightly intoxicated in her ears.Nan Xun told Lu Sui Ren that her little name is Xun Xun. She was afraid that if others were to call her Xiao Xuan or Xuan Xuan, she would forget her name. She has only heard the other girls call her nickname in a playful tone and never heard it called in such a low, gentle, burning voice that touched the soul.Her ears are a little itchy and numb. They seem to be pregnant.1Nan Xun wanted to open her eyes. This time, she finally felt the heavy weight on her body and looked into the dark blood-red eyes.The bloody pupils looked straight at her.\u201cWhat are you doing\u2026\u201d Nan Xun opened her mouth and didn\u2019t finish her sentence. The man\u2019s thin cool lips held her lips fiercely, so that she couldn\u2019t even speak.After Nan Xun became mud again, the Demon King held her from behind, placed his chin on her head and his arms tightly clasped to her waist.The two pairs of eyes looked at the moon outside the window, a pair of bright dark eyes and a pair of bloody-red eyes, they were silent for a while.\u201cTonight\u2019s moon is so big and round\u2026\u201d Nan Xun\u2019s voice sighed dryly.The Demon King behind her whispered: \u201cThe beauty of the scenery in benwang\u2019s eyes is less than one thousandth of Xun Xun\u2019s.\u201dNan Xun mouth twitched. \u201cLittle eight, what happened to the Demon King, he seems to develop love skills overnight.\u201dLittle eight dared not speak out at this time.\u201cXun Xun, do you still hate benwang?\u201d asked the Demon King.Nan Xun was stunned, \u201cWhat do you mean hate? Do you mean hate for forcing me to drink the abortion medicine or leaving me cold for months?\u201dHer words caused the Demon King\u2019s arms to suddenly tighten, after a long time, behind her came his voice full of guilt, \u201cXun Xun, benwang\u2026Don\u2019t blame me, Xun Xun, that child we couldn\u2019t have, how can your human body bear the blood of the four-clawed red Divine Serpent? The child will kill you and benwang will not let you die. As for the women rumored outside, benwang never touched them.\u201dNan Xun snorted, \u201cI don\u2019t believe.\u201dThe Demon King sighed, and helplessly said. \u201cAlthough benwang is a beast, but benwang never lies.\u201dNan Xun touched her belly, this movement \u2013This movement was seen by the Demon King and the guilt in his eyes worsen.\u201cThen I can\u2019t have children in the future?\u201d Nan Xun asked sadly.The Demon King hugged her fiercely in his arms and whispered, \u201cXun Xun, there will be, benwang will find ways to improve your physique and ensure that you can bear the blood of benwang, so don\u2019t blame me for this time?\u201dNan Xun nodded slightly and softly answered: \u201cYes, I believe you this time. If you call me Xun Xun, what should I call you? Do you have a name?\u201dThe Demon King froze for a moment.Name\u2026\u201cCall me Xue Ming.\u201d The Demon King\u2019s eyes moved slightly and said in a self-mocking way: \u201cThis name hasn\u2019t been called for tens of thousands of years.\u201dNan Xun turned around and looked at him seriously, holding his face and saying, \u201cThen I will call you that every day, okay? Xue Ming, Xue Ming, Xue Ming\u2026\u201dThat name hasn\u2019t been called for tens of thousands of years was whispered from that woman\u2019s mouth again and again. His heart was beating fiercely, with his eyes turning red, he turned over and pressed the woman underneath him.Nan Xun sighed in her heart. \u201cLittle eight, you are right, it\u2019s snake sex and it\u2019s an old snake.\u201dAfter surfing the waves, Xue Ming personally held Nan Xun to return to the Demon King\u2019s palace, where there was a very large bath.This beast was too possessive and didn\u2019t allow a servant to clean Nan Xun\u2019s body. He personally went to battle and washed her from head to toe, outside and inside.Just after washing, he stared at the naked Nan Xun, and suddenly his eyes became hot and searing, to the point where he could burn a hole in the person.Nan Xun\u2019s heart felt bad, with one foot she kicked the man into the water and let him drink a few mouthfuls of her bathwater. Then she climbed into the pool quickly.As a result, at the next moment, an unforgettable scene occurred in the bathtub.Her waist was suddenly wrapped with a slippery snake tail, blood-red, and from above the scales were cold and smooth.\u201cXun Xun, you are too playful.\u201d Behind her came the man\u2019s somber voice with a cold smile.Nan Xun cried quickly, \u201cShit, little eight, a big snake tail. I knew someday this would happen, but I didn\u2019t think it would come so fast\u2026\u201dNan Xun was dragged by the snake tail into the man\u2019s arms.Seeing the handsome face, Nan Xun breathed a sigh of relief. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t see a huge snake head when she was dragged. This half snake and half man, she could accept.\u201cXun Xun, are you afraid of me?\u201d Xue Ming asked his voice tinted with rare gentleness.Nan Xun tried to squeeze out a smile. \u201cAt first glance I was naturally afraid, but now that I see it, I am no longer afraid.\u201dXue Ming hooked his thin lips. \u201cI know, every day I will be half-beast. Then you\u2019ll get used to my appearance and then I will become whole beast. That way you won\u2019t be afraid.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Seeing her silence, his eyes sank, and his voice suddenly was cold, \u201cIs Xun Xun deceiving me? You\u2019re afraid of my body, do you think my beastly body is ugly?\u201dNan Xun cried in her heart. \u201cLittle eight, the Demon King is a moody and abnormal pervert. Do I have to say it\u2019s good looking when it looks like a ghost with a snake tail? But if I said he\u2019s ugly, would he eat me in anger?\u201dLittle eight is doomed to not answer her words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have raised one before.\u201d Nan Xun immediately replied, and sincerely smiled at the Demon King.Nan Xun has never raised a snake.He was glad and angry when he heard her words. He hugged her into his arms and whispered. \u201cYou should change your habit of picking up spiritual animals, don\u2019t raise them anymore, or they shall meet the same end as those two beasts.\u201dNan Xun had a suspicion in her heart, and her Da Bai and Xiao Bai were indeed eaten by this sick pervert!\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll change, but Xue Ming, don\u2019t eat raw meat in the future, it\u2019s not hygienic and not clean.\u201d Nan Xun trembled in her heart, but her face was very calm.Xue Ming was stunned for a while, as if he didn\u2019t expect the other\u2019s reply.He smiled and laughed, \u201cBut raw meat is delicious. I like the taste of blood. If you don\u2019t behave well in the future, I\u2019ll eat you in one bite.\u201dNan Xun shuddered. \u201cDon\u2019t joke about it, Xue Ming?\u201dXue Ming\u2019s forked snake tongue traced her neck, back and beautiful collarbone. He said in a very hoarse voice: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019m just scaring you. Xun Xun, I don\u2019t know how to get along with people, so can you teach me later?\u201dWhen Nan Xun heard this, she was stunned. Then she nodded her head and replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to get along with beasts, so can you teach me please?\u201dXue Ming smiled and said: \u201cOkay.\u201dThis man has always been expressionless. Once he smiles, it was like melting a thousand years of ice, and then ten thousand plum trees blossom overnight.Nan Xun\u2019s heart swayed.Gee, it\u2019s really beautiful.Since then, Nan Xun has been invited to the Demon King\u2019s palace and started a cohabitation lifestyle without shame.The news quickly spread throughout the demon domain and exploded between the transformed and untransformed monsters.Tens of thousands of monsters bemoan the situation, but in the face of the Demon King\u2019s absolute strength, they dare not say anything.In addition to the eight-headed hell demon leopard and the four maidservants who had been waiting on them, there were no beasts who knew what the human woman looked like. They only knew that the Demon King has taken care of this person and personally received her into his own palace.This is a privilege that no one has ever had for tens of thousands of years!The beasts are envious and jealous, and in their hearts, many want to kill Nan Xun.Nan Xun closed her door and lived a small life. There is a strong enchantment outside the Demon King\u2019s palace, except for the Demon King, no beasts can enter, and it is very safe.When the Demon King is absent, the void beast will occasionally make a sound and give Nan Xun a briefing of her progress.After much grinding, the Demon King\u2019s evil value finally dropped to 50.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d The man\u2019s soft voice came from her ear. At the next moment, there was a forked snake tongue licking Nan Xun\u2019s cochlea. Then, the thin dress was arbitrarily swayed by the man\u2019s big palm and fell onto the floor.Nan Xun wants to curse at people, no, she wants to curse the snake.She suggested to the horny snake to not destroy her clothes every time. Instead, of destroying her clothes, this kinky snake found some loose dresses that can be removed with two fingers.Luckily, Nan Xun stayed in the palace every day without going out, otherwise she really can\u2019t see anyone.This fucking pervert, deadly lewd snake.Nan Xun slaps the man\u2019s head.She concentrated on roasting the red-skinned wild boar in her hands. \u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss, I\u2019ll give you barbecue.\u201dShe dares to set up a roast oven in the Demon King\u2019s bedroom, out of the entire Yinchuan continent, she was the only person.Xue Ming came from behind her to grab her waist, his big palms on his favorite place to rub, he whispered: \u201cXun Xun, but I have already taken off your clothes.\u201dNan Xun turned her eyes to the sky. \u201cIf you take it off, it will come off. What part of me haven\u2019t you seen yet? Wait until I roast this red-skinned wild boar meat.\u201dXue Ming stared at the spiritual beast barbecue meat in her hands. \u201cWhen are you going to be done roasting?\u201dNan Xun leaned over to inhale a mouthful of aroma. \u201cSoon.\u201dThe barbecue is fragrant, after the meat is roasted, Nan Xun tore off a leg and the rest was given to Xue Ming. Looking at the other\u2019s mouthful, she happily asked, \u201cIs it delicious? Is it better than raw meat?\u201dXue Ming suddenly paused and murmured, \u201cIf you cook me barbecue every day, then I can promise you that I won\u2019t eat raw meat in the future.\u201dNan Xun replied: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I will cook for you every day. However, you\u2019re not allowed to bully those cute little beasts.\u201dXue Ming\u2019s mouth slightly hooked, and answered with a low voice, \u201cOK.\u201dWhen the two are full of wine and food, Xue Ming\u2019s fingers headed towards Nan Xun\u2019s mouth.Nan Xun suddenly lowered her head and looked at him with bitter hatred. \u201cCan I pass today? I just finish eating barbecue and now I have to drink your blood.\u201dXue Ming helplessly rubbed her head. \u201cYou know how many beasts in the whole demon realm wants to drink benwang\u2019s blood, but you show a disgusted expression.\u201dNan Xun naturally knows since the scene of Hong Chou rooted on the ground, licking blood, was imprinted in her heart.This is a wuxia world. This is a world described in fairy tales, where animals and plants can be demonized within a span of thousands of years. The gods and beasts are all in beastly forms. Unless, they hail from noble lineage and they can be humanized in less than a hundred years or born in a human form. A typical beast can only transform into a human form above the emperor level.1However, emperor is not an easily achievable feat. People have pursued that sacred rank all their lives, but so far only a few people have succeeded, and about a hundred people have reached that rank.This is true for the humans and especially true for the beasts.But why did so many emperor ranked beasts emerged from the demon realm?It\u2019s all because of this demon, that is, this sinister snake in front of Nan Xun.The four-clawed red-blood snake is a variant of the Divine Serpent, its magical strength is higher than the Divine beast by more than one grade. Xue Ming inherited its powerful abilities. Anyone who drinks the blood of the four-clawed red-blood serpent can rapidly progress in cultivation. Within five hundred years, it is possible to promote to the rank of emperor, while humans will take four to five thousand years or even longer.It can be said that in the entire demon domain, excluding those old veterans who have cultivated themselves, the other demons that have transformed into human form is because of the Demon King\u2019s blood.It\u2019s not unreasonable for people and gods to desire to kill the Demon King, that ability is too frightening.Nan Xun held Xue Ming\u2019s fingers, licking the slender fingers, and muttered: \u201cBut I don\u2019t like to drink blood, it tastes fishy.\u201dXue Ming flicked her forehead. \u201cXun Xun, it\u2019s good for your health.\u201dShe had to bite his fingers and suck several times.After drinking the blood, Nan Xun estimated that it was time for pancake.2Sure enough, this time Xue Ming\u2019s pancake was branded with great strength, but when he was half-baked, he suddenly asked Nan Xun with a burning gaze. \u201cXun Xun, I let you see my half beast every day, I don\u2019t know if you\u2026. are ready?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She couldn\u2019t understand why the Demon King wanted to entangle in his beast form. After she brewed in his sauce, does it seem like her mental capacity was large?The Demon King\u2019s disappointment turned into strength, and his pancake was brimming with enthusiasm. From the excitement, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but claw his back.Don\u2019t look, it\u2019s definitely bloody.On his next stroke, his pancake was deeply rooted and suddenly the woman under him held tightly onto him.The next moment, the man\u2019s bare back suddenly exposed a pair of huge flesh wings, and there was a row of sharp barbs along his spine, like a line of blood-colored knives.Nan Xun exclaimed. The four-clawed red-blood snake\u2019s wings!It is rumored that the root of the wings is the weakest spot, and the Demon King revealed his weakness to her?The huge flesh wings stretched out and closed, and soon the two were wrapped within and it covered up a spring.The next day, when Nan Xun woke up, she heard the void beast happily say, \u201cThe evil value has dropped to 40.\u201dNan Xun stretched and said: \u201cThe snake told me last night that he was invited by the Divine Serpent family as a guest. He said it might take him a while to come back and for me to stay here. Alas, I didn\u2019t expect him to go to this grand banquet. He has been driven out by his family long ago. It wouldn\u2019t be a good thing to be invited back as a guest.The void beast was unaware. \u201cAccording to my examination of him, he is the most powerful existence in this world. Most people can\u2019t touch him.\u201dNan Xun made a sound and laid back down and continued to sleep.Suddenly, she turned over and sat up. \u201cShit, I\u2019m so screwed! Xue Ming told me not to step out of this palace.\u201dThe Demon King laid a strong protective enchantment outside the palace. No one else would be able to enter unless she took the initiative to leave.The void beast yawned, \u201cThen don\u2019t go out.\u201dNan Xun was paralyzed and replied: \u201cHe didn\u2019t leave anything behind for me to eat. If I stay here the entire time, wouldn\u2019t I starve to death?\u201dThis realm\u2019s Demon King doesn\u2019t need to eat grains, but Nan Xun wasn\u2019t the same, she will starve to death if she doesn\u2019t eat.The void beast was silent for a long time before it said: \u201cAccording to this beast\u2019s knowledge, there are many monsters outside who wants your life.\u201dIf you go out, you may be killed. If you don\u2019t go out, you will starve to death.So, after three days of hunger, the light-headed Nan Xun finally stepped out of the Demon King\u2019s palace.Nan Xun was unfamiliar with the Demon King\u2019s palace. She was always held by the Demon King and teleported into his palace, she never left after she entered.\u201cMadam! How did you get out?\u201dShortly after Nan Xun left the palace, she heard a cry.When she saw the person, she couldn\u2019t help but say. \u201cHong Chou? You\u2019re here. Why are you alone, where is Lan Shui?\u201dHong Chou listened to her and was so angry that she was stunned. \u201cI was worried about you, so I came over here to look for you. All the beasts know that it\u2019s forbidden by the Demon King to come near his palace. So, no monsters will come near, Lan Shui and the rest are very stiff and wouldn\u2019t come with me.\u201dNan Xun was moved and quickly took her arm. \u201cThank you, Hong Chou, but don\u2019t blame Lan Shui. In this whole demon domain, who dares defy the Demon King\u2019s orders?\u201dHong Chou said: \u201cI\u2019m not defying it, but the Demon King hasn\u2019t been present for a few days and doesn\u2019t know I\u2019ve been here.\u201dNan Xun was embarrassed to ask, \u201cHong Chou, I\u2019m a little hungry. Can you get me something to eat?\u201dHong Chou was stunned at first, then laughed loudly, \u201cWang really forgotten that his wife is not like us and needs to eat all kinds of grain.\u201dWith Hong Chou\u2019s help, Nan Xun has escaped starving to death.It\u2019s just that she is worried again. Xue Ming clearly said not to step out of the palace, now that she is out, she doesn\u2019t know if she can return?The answer is obviously no.\u201cMadam, quickly return to your palace. You\u2019re exposed to the knife\u2019s edge right now. Those old demons have long wanted to take your life.\u201d Hong Chou urges.Nan Xun looked embarrassed. \u201cCan I return once I leave?\u201dHong Chou laughed and said: \u201cThe average person can\u2019t, unlike them, you are his wife and have the Demon King\u2019s love for several years. The Demon King\u2019s scent already lingers on your body. Only a meager amount of Xuan can let you break through the barrier and enter.\u201dNan Xun was shocked after hearing the words, \u201cseveral years\u201d and asked the void beast, \u201cLittle eight, did I spent several years living in the Demon King\u2019s palace?\u201dThe void beast answered, \u201cYes, or so you would think.\u201dFor a moment, Nan Xun felt endless emotions. She listened to Hong Chou and went directly to the enchantment, but her forehead was repelled by the barrier.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but look at Hong Chou, didn\u2019t she say she only need a little Xuan?Hong Chou said, \u201cSorry madam, I forgot that you\u2019re just a junior master.\u201dNan Xun felt that she had made rapid progress but heard the disdain from Hong Chou\u2019s mouth.When she first arrived in the demon domain, she was still an apprentice. Xue Ming fed her all kinds of elixir every day and now is a junior master.From an apprentice to junior master, she feels that her progress was amazingly rapid. The palace was above the demon realm. There were almost no natural elements within the air, it was all dark elements. She can only practice with that element. Besides, she spends very little time practicing daily and the rest of her time is devoted to a certain snake.Hong Chou thought for a moment and said: \u201cI have no intention spying from the shadows. If the madam doesn\u2019t dislike it, I\u2019ll be in your shadow and go with you.\u201dNan Xun was in a daze, thinking back to when the Demon King had hidden in the long-eared rabbit\u2019s shadow. Wasn\u2019t this a secret method, how can Hong Chou use it?Nan Xun immediately clap her hands, \u201cVery good.\u201d Then said with a thick face, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you take some more food with you?\u201dHong Chou waved the storage bag in her hand and smiled: \u201cHere, it\u2019s all dry food.\u201dThe two people went together with Hong Chou hidden within Nan Xun\u2019s shadow. With her help, Nan Xun easily entered the protective enchantment and returned to the palace.This time with dry food reserves, Nan Xun doesn\u2019t have to worry about starving to death.In the palace, Hong Chou left her shadow, and dumped the dry food from the storage bag onto the ground.\u201cThank you, Hong Chou. I\u2019ll say a few nice words in front of Xue Ming when he comes back. Quickly leave, if you leave your scent here, you will not be happy when Xue Ming comes back.\u201d Nan Xun reminded.Hong Chou didn\u2019t answer, she stared at Nan Xun incredulously, and her voice was slightly elevated. \u201cXue Ming? You called wang\u2019s name directly!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You see, Hong Chou\u2019s jealous face is exposed, I didn\u2019t expect this since she dressed so well1 in front of me, I had no idea at all.\u201dThe void beast humph, \u201cYou\u2019re nervous, of course you won\u2019t notice. I have already discovered it.\u201d\u201cYou found out but didn\u2019t say?\u201d Nan Xun despises it.The void beast hesitated, \u201cIt\u2019s because the Demon King\u2019s perverted surveillance of you, I didn\u2019t have an opportunity.\u201d\u201cWhat should I do now? I\u2019m so scared that Hong Chou will kill me.\u201d Nan Xun was nervous.The void beast began to advise. \u201cFind ways to satisfy her vanity, so she will humiliate you first and will not kill you immediately.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cI asked you, this rubbish thing, did you bring it into wang\u2019s palace?\u201d Hong Chou frowned.Nan Xun nodded, \u201cYes, because I wanted to barbecue for wang.\u201dHong Chou\u2019s face suddenly changed and shouted, \u201cWang is not a human, so he doesn\u2019t eat cooked food! Don\u2019t give him such dirty things in the future!\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Nan Xun seems to be busy.Don\u2019t blame her, she must try to save her little life before she eliminates the Demon King\u2019s evil value.Hong Chou glanced at her, and the corners of her mouth was bent, she suddenly reached out to hold her chin. \u201cIt\u2019s really beautiful, but you are not qualified to stand in front of the Demon King.\u201dNan Xun pretended to find out she wasn\u2019t right and glared at her. \u201cHong Chou, why are you talking to me in that kind of tone?\u201dThe cold Hong Chou snorted, and her slender jade finger cut a blood mark on Nan Xun\u2019s chin and pushed her away.Nan Xun fell to the ground and patronized her by trying to satisfy her vanity as much as possible.\u201cZuili Xuan, what makes you, a human, keep your head above the Demon King? You cheap human!\u201d\u201cI used to think that the Demon King wasn\u2019t fond of women because he hated to be close to any women, but! But the Demon King is interested in you! What on earth do you have that is better than Hong Chou? Face? But Hong Chou isn\u2019t bad, or is it your skills in bed? Hong Chou knows 9,981 techniques and will wait on wang to serve him comfortably. How can you compare to me?\u201dNan Xun laughed in her heart. \u201cLittle eight, this female demon is so dirty. Isn\u2019t she reading too much erotic pictures?\u201dThe void beast: \u201cThink about your situation first.\u201dNan Xun suddenly couldn\u2019t laugh.Hong Chou completely revealed an ugly face full of jealousy. \u201cDo you know how excited and jealous I was when I first saw your love marks? The excitement I felt when I found out wang likes women and that I had a chance. I\u2019m so jealous because wang is so obsessed with you. In the past few years, excluding the monthly demon domain meeting, wang has never stepped outside the palace. And his original ambition to eradicate the humans and the beast gods has been worn away because of you.\u201dNan Xun shrank herself into the corner with her injury and replied, \u201cHong Chou, I have always regarded you as my sister. If you like wang, you can tell me, and I will let wang know.\u201d\u201cEnough, enough, Zuili Xuan, Hong Chou don\u2019t want your charity!\u201dHong Chou looked down at her and sneered, \u201cNow you have two choices. First, immediately roll out of wang\u2019s palace and be killed by the other beasts. Second, stay here and serve me. Otherwise, I will eat you immediately!\u201dIn order to save her life, Nan Xun wanted to choose the second option, but she didn\u2019t want to humiliate the Zuili family.So, Nan Xun left the Demon King\u2019s palace which she lived in for several years.Hong Chou sneered from behind and seemed to visualize her end of being eaten by the beasts.When she was about to step out of the palace, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but look back. She saw Hong Chou on the quilt bed smothering her mouth and nose in the bedding and having a look of intoxication. Soon, she curled up in the snow silk quilt, writhing and moaned from her mouth.Nan Xun: \u2026Nan Xun was too embarrassed to tell her that the snow silk has never been touched by Xue Ming. She liked to use it to wrap her body after bathing, even though it smelled like that.2Nan Xun immediately left the palace and took out the many charms that her mother has given her and remembered the passing note that was mixed with them.Although it can teleport people dozens of miles away, the entire demon realm is enclosed. She can\u2019t leave the boundary. She can only temporarily leave from the top of the demon realm where the Demon King\u2019s palace was located at.Nan Xun wanted to use the teleporting charm to leave from here but heard the sudden screams of the void beast within her mind. \u201cFucking Hell! What happened?! Why did the Demon King\u2019s blackening value suddenly become 100! The evil value also went back to 99!\u201dNan Xun\u2019s brain rumbles and her shock was not inferior to the void beast. \u201cLittle eight, what did you said? The evil value bounced back to 99? Why is it so bad that it rebounded!? Didn\u2019t this, didn\u2019t this make all my hard work over the years ruined?\u201dNan Xun wants to cry.The void beast was also shattered and was silent for a moment.\u201cUmm!\u201d Nan Xun who was sad had her mouth suddenly covered.Nan Xun wanted to struggle but heard a familiar voice in her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, it\u2019s me.\u201dNan Xun blinked, it sounded like Lan Shui.Oh no, after Hong Chou then comes Lan Shui. Does Lan Shui secretly love the Demon King and also hates her to the bone?Lan Shui handed a black silk umbrella to Nan Xun and said, \u201cHold this umbrella and follow me, and don\u2019t speak if you see anything.\u201dNan Xun looked down at the black silk umbrella in her hand and vaguely felt the demonic aura encircling her. She can\u2019t help but ask: \u201cLan Shui, what is this?\u201d\u201cA superior item that restrains and conceals your human aura.\u201d Lan Shui\u2019s brows twisted. \u201cXuan\u2019Er, it\u2019s not too late, quickly leave with me.\u201dNan Xun was stunned, Lan Shui and Lu Sui Ren has never called her Xuan\u2019Er. The Lan Shui in front of her was inexplicably strange.Although strange, but harmless, Nan Xun didn\u2019t ask any more questions, holding up the umbrella and followed her.Lan Shui used a token and was unobstructed along the way.Along the road, Nan Xun saw a lot of humanoid beasts, half-human half-beasts, and fierce beasts that could not take human form.\u201cLan Shui, where are you taking me?\u201d Nan Xun whispered.\u201cTo leave the demon domain.\u201d Lan Shui replied heavily.Nan Xun\u2019s footsteps stomped violently. Does Lan Shui actually want to take her out of the demon domain?Guys, I think Hong Chou catalogs all her techniques\u2026she knew the exact number of techniques she is well-versed in\u20269,981\u2026. okay.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The news will soon spread within the demon domain, you must leave here before then.\u201dWhat?Nan Xun looked shocked.Xue Ming was captured?\u201cLittle eight, what\u2019s going on here, how can the Demon King be captured?\u201d Nan Xun hurriedly asked the void beast.The void beast replied: \u201cYou wait, wait for me to take a look.\u201dNan Xun guessed that the void beast should have clairvoyance or divine hearing, or perhaps a magic item that lets you see anywhere you desire.\u201cShit, things are not looking good! I see the Demon King locked in a cage and bloody! It\u2019s no wonder his blackening value suddenly shot to 100 and evil value rebounded to 99!\u201d The void beast roared.Nan Xun was confused. \u201cIf he dies, what should I do?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cIt\u2019s important to flee first, once the demons within the demon realm hears of the Demon King\u2019s news, I fear that they will take a knife to you.\u201dNan Xun trembled and fell silent.As the two reached the threshold of the domain\u2019s barrier, the gate guardian, a two-headed black python bellowed: \u201cGolden python, where are you going? What beast is behind you? Why can\u2019t I see her body?\u201dLan Shui showed the token, but it wasn\u2019t good enough: \u201cThe iron-winged fire lion ordered me to go out to run errands and behind me is my newly-shaped sister. She is the giant-eyed owl that wang aided personally. Do you still want to stop me?\u201dAs soon as the double-headed black snake heard that she was a giant-eyed owl, its natural enemy and personally shaped by the Demon King, it dared not question her identity anymore and apologized. \u201cSince the iron-winged fire lion has errands, then the golden python can leave as soon as possible.\u201dNan Xun was messy in the wind1. She played with Lan Shui for so long. She now discovered that her beast form was actually a golden python.Lan Shui is not as enchanting as Hong Chou, why is she a golden python?After leaving the demon domain, Lan Shui took Nan Xun a long way before stopping.\u201cLan Shui, why did you protect me?\u201d Nan Xun asked.Lan Shui gazed at her lovingly, like an elder looking at a child. \u201cXuan\u2019Er, now that the Demon King is captured, you\u2019re the greatest hero, you can now retire. You are the pride of the Zuili family.\u201dNan Xun felt shameful and asked little eight in her heart, \u201cWhat does it have to do with me that the Demon King was captured?\u201dThe void beast said it was unclear.Nan Xun shuddered and felt that she had been set up. It seems that something big happened without her knowledge.\u201cWho on earth are you?\u201d Nan Xun frowned and looked at Lan Shui.Lan Shui\u2019s eyes were red. \u201cXuan\u2019Er, have you ever heard your parents mention your aunt, Lan Xin?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s face changed.Aunt Lan Xin mentioned by Lan Shui was naturally someone she knows. Her father had her when he was 200 years old, but she has never met her aunt. It\u2019s said that during the beast war a hundred year prior to her birth, her father\u2019s half-sister, Aunt Lan Xin, inexplicably disappeared and was never found.Everyone said that Zuili Lan Xin lost her life in the war, both her father and mother were devastated.\u201cYou\u2019re obviously a beast. How could you be my aunt? My aunt has died a long time ago.\u201d She thought she just heard a joke just now.Lan Shui smiled bitterly, \u201cXuan\u2019Er, have you awakened the unique bloodline, beast-taming ability?\u201dNan Xun shook her head, \u201cNo.\u201dLan Shui bowed her head, \u201cNo wonder. From awakening the inherited ability, there were many unique secrets and forbidden techniques in beast-taming. Among them, there is a powerful forbidden technique called soul eater\u2026\u201dWhen I was Zuili Lan Xin, I was injured during the war and my spiritual strength was severely damaged and I could no longer control beasts. However, Zuili Lan Xin was a natural genius in cultivation, even if I couldn\u2019t control beasts.But even then, the elders of the Zuili family made a desperate decision.They used a soul extraction technique to pull Zuili Lan Xin\u2019s soul out of her body and placed it into a golden python.Zuili Lan Xin was forced into the giant golden python\u2019s body and the vessel contained two souls. In order to fully possess the new body, following the elders\u2019 wishes, she had to use a forbidden soul eating technique to swallow its soul.Nan Xun has long felt disgust towards the old men but didn\u2019t think they were capable of doing anything horrible to this extent.Lan Shui saw her angry expression and couldn\u2019t help but smile. \u201cDon\u2019t blame the elders. This was my wish. I am willing to do anything for the Zuili family and help them destroy the bloodthirsty Demon King as soon as possible. This is for the peace and prosperity of mankind.\u201dNan Xun felt at that moment, that Lan Shui was shining all over her body and the dazzling golden light almost blinded her.2Nan Xun was upset for her aunt Lan Xin but didn\u2019t expect that she was willing to do it.\u201cChild, you have been living with the blood thirsty Demon King for these years. It must have been really hard on you, but it\u2019s good that you poisoned the Demon King. It gave the Qinglong and Divine Serpent clan an opportunity to capture that beast alive. You\u2019re the hero for all of mankind, we are proud of you.\u201dNan Xun was shocked.Wait, what is her aunt talking about? Why doesn\u2019t she understand a word?\u201cWhat she meant was that because you administer poison unique to the Zuili clan to the Demon King, it led to his defeat. The Demon King is now confined into a cage, being whipped all day long and ended up miserable.\u201d The void beast kindly explained.\u201cCome on, I know what she meant. What I don\u2019t understand is, when did I administer poison to Xue Ming?\u201d Nan Xun was a bit grumpy.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The void beast fell silent after replying.Nan Xun wanted to kill the void beast.\u201cXuan\u2019Er, go back, aunt won\u2019t take you.\u201d Lan Shui suddenly said, her eyes looked into the distance with melancholy.Nan Xun suddenly returned from her consciousness and asked: \u201cAunt, why don\u2019t you return to the clan with me?\u201dZuili Lan Xin touched her head and smiled. \u201cAunt has already become neither a human nor a beast. I have no face to go back to the Zuili family and no courage to face the clan. Xuan\u2019Er, go on.\u201dNan Xun opened her mouth and wanted to persuade her but couldn\u2019t say a word.\u201cGo on.\u201d Zuili Lan Xin urged.Nan Xun turned back ten times to the gently smiling woman behind her, but by the last time she looked, she had disappeared.\u201cDon\u2019t look, she has long wanted to die. Now that the Demon King is captured, she lost her reason to live.\u201d The void beast said.\u201cAre you saying she will commit suicide?\u201d Nan Xun was shocked. But when she thought about it, she understood. \u201cShe has been hiding her identity for so many years. As a person, she had to find a way to blend in with the beasts and must have felt bitter in her heart. Now she is finally free.\u201dThe void beast remained silent.Nan Xun suddenly felt her footsteps were heavy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She quickly returned to the Zuili family.Someone saw her returned and shouted, then soon a large group of people came to welcome her home.Everyone witnessed her tearful mother and father bringing her back home.In the eyes of outsiders, Nan Xun is a great hero. Most people admired Nan Xun\u2019s behavior of \u201cself-sacrifice\u201d. Only a small number of people looked at her with strange eyes. After all, she has been committed to the Demon King for several years, and her body has long been unclean.Her mother embraced her and cried for a long time, sobbing and saying, \u201cJust come back, just come back\u2026\u201dNan Xun felt very tired, hugged her mother and whispered, \u201cMother, I\u2019m a little tired.\u201dHer mother told her to have a good rest and left with red eyes.Nan Xun sighed. \u201cLittle eight, ah, I\u2019m so sorry, wasting so much time, but I couldn\u2019t eliminate the Demon King\u2019s evil value, you didn\u2019t get any merits.\u201dThe void beast: \u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged, there will be opportunities. Ah, the Demon King is captured, and not dead.\u201dNan Xun sprang from her chair and said, \u201cFuck, little eight, what do you mean by that? Would the Demon King be able to escape?\u201dThe void beast laughed, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, the Demon King is the most powerful existence in this world. He won\u2019t die so easily, it\u2019s a matter of time before he escapes.\u201dNan Xun slowly sat back down and said to the void beast softly, \u201cDo you know what praises they sing about me outside? The daughter of the Zuili clan, went alone to the demon domain, willing to sacrifice herself for the world, helped capture the Demon King, a rare woman in the world, hehe.\u201d\u201cLittle eight, do you know what that means? It means that I am the first person the Demon King would want to eat after he escapes.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s gentle tone suddenly changed, \u201cIn the end, I\u2019ll still be eaten!\u201dThe void beast first agreed and said in a negotiated tone: \u201cI know that you live in this world with fear every day, as compensation, regardless of completing the task, I will promise you a request in the next world, ok?\u201dNan Xun regained some of her spirits, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much the same.\u201dThen, Nan Xun left to binge eat and drink.Nan Xun\u2019s idea is very simple. If you are destined to be eaten by the Demon King, it\u2019s better to eat and drink more before dying.However, Nan Xun\u2019s appetite is very good, but she was still thinning day by day, and her face has become a bit pale.Her mother found that her face was not right, and immediately invited a number of famous doctors. However, every doctor shook their head and said they couldn\u2019t find out the cause.Her mother can only conclude it was heart disease and worried.When Nan Xun said she wanted peace and quiet, her mother listened to her. She came to see her every other day. Daily, her mother made delicious food and had people bring it to her. She was worried about people gossiping about her, so she chose two quiet girls. One of them waited for washing and the other for serving.In short, her mother was heartbroken for her.Nan Xun likes the quiet, she sends the two maidservants away to be alone when necessary.Nan Xun was so excited to listen about her family\u2019s gossip during the time she was away.For example, she got so happy hearing about her distant cousin, Qin Yuexuan, who was a beast, recently married Zuili Yuejian about a month ago.Another example, the Zuili family has had a good relationship with the Qinglong in these recent years. Her fifth eldest sister, who is ranked fifth, has also obtained an equal contract with a dragon beast.Nan Xun drank a cup of tea and wandered into the small courtyard to enjoy the cool.\u201cLittle eight, I always feel dizzy and tinnitus these days. What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d Nan Xun asked.The void beast was silent for a moment before replying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019ll give you a pill for your health.\u201dAs soon as it finished speaking, it put a pill into her mouth, and it dissolved.\u201cI feel much better, thank you, little eight.\u201d Nan Xun smiled and laid on the rocking chair.The void beast: \u201cYou suddenly treat me so politely, I\u2019m not used to it.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026The rocking chair rocked and squeaked, Nan Xun\u2019s head was dizzy and she slept unconsciously.Suddenly she noticed an itch on her face. Her heart trembled and her eyes opened immediately.When she saw an enlarged face coming closer, Nan Xun turned and screamed, \u201cLecher, you dare to be rude to me!\u201dThe man gave a cold smile and looked at her sullenly. \u201cZuili Xuan, how can you pretend to be a virgin? How many times have you been ruined by that beast? You\u2019re so cheap that you would rather let an animal taint you than to commit yourself to me!\u201dNan Xun discovered that the person who snuck into her yard was no other than Qin Yuexuan who had lost a handful of rice but didn\u2019t steal the chicken1.\u201cPresumptuous, who let you in?! I am the Zuili clan\u2019s great hero, how dare you disrespect me?\u201d Nan Xun was angry.Qin Yuexuan seemed to have heard a joke and \u200b\u200blaughed loudly. \u201cI say cousin, cousin, don\u2019t you know how everyone talks about you privately? Your body that has been committed to the Demon King has long become dirty. According to the temperament of the clan\u2019s elders, sooner or later, you will be silently executed, and your stupid father and stupid mother are really proud of you!\u201d\u201cYou shut up!\u201d Nan Xun angrily shouted.In the entire Zuili family, her father and mother treated her the best and she couldn\u2019t tolerate Qin Yuexuan\u2019s words.\u201cCousin, don\u2019t you know your situation? Has cousin ever done anything that harmed you?\u201dThen he grabbed Nan Xun\u2019s wrist and his eyes were complicated, his voice lowered, \u201cXuan\u2019Er, how about I take you out of here? Cousin doesn\u2019t hate you.\u201dThere was a hint of supplication in the depths of his eyes, but Nan Xun didn\u2019t see it.She threw aside Qin Yuexuan\u2019s hand and said coldly: \u201cIs cousin actually saying that you haven\u2019t done anything that hurt me? If it hadn\u2019t been little white who saved me, you would\u2026now that you have married my third sister, you should live well with her and stop humiliating me!\u201dThe last light in Qin Yuexuan\u2019s eyes dissipated, and he sneered. \u201cOkay, Okay, I won\u2019t care about you anymore!\u201dAs he said that, he flicked his sleeves and went to the door, only to see Zuili Yuejian walking in.Nan Xun looked at the vicious woman and sighed in her heart. \u201cLittle eight, she thinks that I am hooking up with her man and witnessed an act of infidelity.\u201dThe void beast immediately replied, \u201cWhat she thinks is true. What\u2019s the difference between Qin Yuexuan hooking you or you hooking him?\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How can I be with her, when I am married to you? She is a withered willow3,how can she be half as good as you?\u201dNan Xun sighed, this woman is really a strange creature. She saw Zuili Yuejian\u2019s little face smiled and held Qin Yuexuan shyly. \u201cBrother Xuan, are you serious?\u201d\u201cNaturally it\u2019s true.\u201d Qin Yuexuan lifted her chin with a smile, bowed his head and kissed her.When Nan Xun looked away, she seemed to have stimulated the two, who were increasingly moaning. The two people\u2019s movement became more and more erratic, nearly performing a live erotic show in front of her.Nan Xun\u2019s face didn\u2019t change color, instead she stared at the stars in the night sky.She doesn\u2019t know when the erotic sounds disappeared. But when Nan Xun looked back there was only Zuili Yuejian.She is a beautiful woman, but her face looked ugly because of jealousy.\u201cZuili Xuan, I\u2019m warning you, stay far away from cousin Xuan! Now, you don\u2019t even deserve to give him shoes!4\u201d Zuili Yuejian left after saying ruthless remarks while sneering.Nan Xun sighed. \u201cDo I look like a person who needs to hold onto a thigh badly?\u201dThe void beast retorted: \u201cIn just a few years, he was promoted from junior master to intermediate king. This Qin Yuexuan is indeed a genius cultivator.\u201dNan Xun looked at the night sky and became drowsy again.What\u2019s wrong with her, why does she feel that her body is getting weaker?Two months later, after hearing there was a civil strife within the demon domain, the five big human families and the Qinglong clan headed an attack on the demon domain. The beasts without a leader were defeated and the demon domain was breached. But after that, the defensive array set up by the Demon King activated, which prevented further attacks from the humans and the Qinglong.The beasts were shocked that the defensive layout of the demon realm has been stolen and that there was a thief within them!Soon, the beasts thought that the Demon King\u2019s human woman was the culprit and all the blame was directed at the Zuili female who return to her clan.Nan Xun listened to the void beast\u2019s live report and almost spit out a mouthful of blood.Fuck, why is she carrying all the pots on her back?She thought about it. She feared that this defensive layout was stolen by her aunt Zuili Lan Xin who gave it to the Zuili family. As the poison that was inflicted on the Demon King, she had no idea who did it. With Xue Ming\u2019s vigilance no one could get close.\u201cForget it. Anyway, I\u2019ll be eaten by the Demon King and have to take the pot5.\u201d Nan Xun said very open-mindedly.The void beast suddenly asked, \u201cDo you know why this beast chose you in the beginning?\u201dNan Xun yawned lazily. \u201cIs it because I\u2019m as beautiful as a flower?\u201dThe void beast was silent for a moment and said in a serious tone she has never heard before. \u201cYou seemed casual, lively, smart, got along well with others, but in fact you are heartless. You never give up your feelings easily and you sleep like a dead pig even if the sky was falling. However, once you are concerned about something, you will do everything you can and you\u2019re incredibly persistent. This type of person will have the highest success rate in completing the task.\u201dNan Xun covers her face in embarrassment. \u201cShort oil6, why did you suddenly praise me, I\u2019m very embarrassed.\u201dVoid beast: \u2026All the other words it said before was ignored by the other party?\u201cLittle eight, I really don\u2019t have cancer? I always feel as if my body is being hollowed out, and I\u2019m about to run out of oil7.\u201d Nan Xun covered her chest.She leaned her head slightly, rubbed her head with her hand and her dusty face pale like paper.This time, the void beast was silent for a long time. \u201cActually, I suspect that you\u2019re\u2014\u201dBefore it could finish its words, the void beast noticed something, and its tone suddenly changed. \u201cFuck, the Demon King broke out of the Qinglong clan\u2019s nine treasure cage and has now escaped!\u201dNan Xun suddenly felt no pain nor did her head hurt when she heard the news. Her heart trembled and she asked, \u201cIt\u2019s said that the Demon King was badly tortured by the Qinglong clan when he was trapped in the cage. Little eight, is there any way for me to see the situation of the Demon King now?\u201dThe void beast\u2019s tone was a little strange, \u201cDo you really want to see?\u201dNan Xun nodded fiercely and prepared herself psychologically before seeing it.\u201cThe Demon King is on the way back to his palace. I\u2019ll give you a live broadcast immediately.\u201dAs soon as the void beast\u2019s voice fell, Nan Xun felt her eyes were feverish and then she \u201csees\u201d the Demon King\u2019s palace.\u201cWhy is there a woman in the palace who looks exactly like me?\u201d Nan Xun was shocked, but soon she understood.The Demon King\u2019s enchantment is not something that anyone can break into, so the woman was most likely Hong Chou. She doesn\u2019t know what secret technique Hong Chou used to actually make herself looked exactly like her.But doesn\u2019t Hong Chou know that the demon realm been turned upside down? Or was she afraid of leaving the palace and being unable to enter again? Did she not leave the palace for the past two months and have no idea what is happening outside?Nan Xun didn\u2019t have time to think deeply because the palace was suddenly turbulent with a void distorting the space. A tall man in a black robe suddenly appeared in the palace.Nan Xun was frightened.Even if the man wore the black robe, he can\u2019t hide the scars on his body, and he was covered in blood. Especially on his original handsome and uncast face there were several whip marks marred deep within his bones. The flesh and blood were torn and exposed his stern white bones which complement his blood red eyes which emitted a bone-eroding hatred. The whole person was like a blood bathed devil.In the palace, \u201cZuili Xuan\u201d was frightened and pale, she staggered backwards a few steps. She was terrified and asked in a panic, \u201cWang, wang, how did you become like this?\u201dThe Demon King\u2019s hateful blood eyes stared straight at \u201cZuili Xuan\u201d, and suddenly in the next moment his eyes turned into a pair of vertical blood red pupils!He opened his mouth sharply, exposing two sharp poisonous fangs on his upper gums, then his mouth grew larger and larger, but in a blink of an eye it turned into a huge snake head!The long snake devoured \u201cZuili Xuan\u201d into its big mouth, the beauty\u2019s head disappeared, then her body. Finally, her feet with her shoes were completely swallowed by the snake whole.Everything happened in just one or two seconds.When the vision disappeared, Nan Xun grabbed the table beside her, bent over and opened her mouth.Puke, vomiting vigorously.For the first time, she witnessed the Demon King eating people. All of the contents in Nan Xun\u2019s stomach rolled and even her evening meal tumbled out.\u201cCalm down, calm down, that wasn\u2019t you that was eaten.\u201d The void beast consoled her.Nan Xun covered her stomach and cried, \u201cHe wants to eat me, that\u2019s me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Previously, she obviously prepared herself to be eaten, but then she watched the live broadcast of the Demon King\u2019s cannibalism. She rather stab herself ahead of time than to be swallowed whole by the Demon King.Bong, Bong, Bong.1Suddenly in the quiet night, the Zuili\u2019s family beast detector enchantment rang, and its vibration was fierce.Everyone was awakened and soon there was a fearful hum of the various beasts.\u201cNot good, there is a powerful beast intruding\u2014\u201d She doesn\u2019t know which elder shouted, followed by chaotic footsteps and panicked calls.Nan Xun suddenly straightened up, \u201cShit, little eight! Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s the Demon King coming. Wasn\u2019t he in the palace within the demon domain?\u201dThe void beast explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a mysterious technique called teleportation, which allows the user to break the void and go to any place they desire within a blink of an eye.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026After the void beast said that, it stopped talking. Nan Xun predicted that the Demon King has arrived.In this instant, her mind flashed through countless images and finally settled on the scene where \u201cZuili Xuan\u201d was devoured.Her feet were filled with lead and she couldn\u2019t move.So, she looked ahead with her big black eyes wide open, filled with tears\u2026I\u2019m scared.The night before her stirred slightly. A man in a black robe, covered in blood, appeared in front of Nan Xun.The man\u2019s thin lips curved slightly and gently said, \u201cXun Xun, I found you.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s tears flowed uncontrollably. She looked at the man in front of her and whispered, \u201cXue Ming\u2026you\u2019ve finally came\u2026\u201dThe two slowly walked towards each other, gazed at each other affectionately and then reached out their hands.One hand trembled while touching the whip marks on the other\u2019s cheek. While the other hand directly grabbed the other\u2019s slender white neck.Nan Xun was gripped and couldn\u2019t say a word. Her throat was strangled, if the other party put in a little effort, her neck would be broken with a crack.\u201cXun Xun, is benwang not good to you? Why did you betray benwang, huh?\u201d Xue Ming came closer to her ears and his deep voice was chilly and cold.Nan Xun wanted to explain, but her voice struggled while being strangled and her neck at risk of being snapped. \u201cXue Ming\u2026no\u2026no\u2026betrayal.\u201d\u201cXun Xun, remember what benwang once said? If you\u2019re not obedient, benwang will eat you one mouthful at a time.\u201d Xue Ming\u2019s voice was soft and gentle, his big palm that encircle her neck slowly loosens.Nan Xun gasped and coughed violently, but the next moment when he let go, the man suddenly dipped his head and bit onto her shoulder, severely tearing off a piece of her flesh.Nan Xun\u2019s cried bitterly in pain but didn\u2019t utter a word.Xue Ming chewed the flesh in his mouth, his thin lips stained with blood and was extremely beautiful.\u201cXue Ming, I didn\u2019t betray you, why don\u2019t you believe me\u2026\u201d Nan Xun wept silently and her words were full of grievances.She was really wronged, and she didn\u2019t do anything. But as a result, all the pots were on her back.Xue Ming opened his bloody mouth, two sharp poisonous fangs exposed from his gums, ready to take another bite into her flesh. Hearing the woman\u2019s defense, he whispered and sneered \u201cXun Xun, you and I are together, day and night, the only person who has the opportunity to poison me is you, who is a Zuili. The poison is so powerful that it affected benwang. Benwang was trapped in the nine-treasure cage for more than two months. Do you know what kinds of torture benwang suffered during that time?\u201dHis voice suddenly sinks, \u201cAnd all this time, it was all thanks to you, Zuili Xuan!\u201d\u201cXun Xun, benwang really likes you, but you can\u2019t escape death if you calculated benwang to this extreme. Benwang thought about it, it\u2019s better to swallow you into benwang\u2019s stomach, so that we can become one. Xun Xun, what do you think?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s body couldn\u2019t stop trembling. Her previous feelings of weakness surfaced again, especially strong this time.She knew she was about to faint, so she grabbed onto the man\u2019s arm with one hand and grasped his chest tightly with the other and gasped to explain, \u201cXue Ming, I don\u2019t know how you were poisoned, let alone how I would be able to leak out the defensive layout of the demon domain. I stayed by your side every day and never stepped out of the palace, so how would I know where the demon domain\u2019s defensive layout would be? Xue Ming, I know you were worried about me after you were captured, and I was really worried about you. I was so afraid that you were dead, so afraid\u2026\u201dIn the end, she couldn\u2019t help but sob. \u201cI\u2019m not the most righteous and best woman humanity offers. I don\u2019t know what happened\u2026I don\u2019t want anything, I just wanted you to come back alive, Ming, believe me, believe me, ah\u2026\u201dXue Ming looked at her with scorn and disdain, then indifference. In the end, he widened his eyes slowly and showed a frightened expression.Nan Xun felt that the other person\u2019s expression was very strange. It must be because she had acted so sensationally that Xue Ming finally believed her.Her head felt heavy, liquid flowed down her mouth and nose. Nan Xun was stupefied, she couldn\u2019t help but reach out and touch it.Blood.Her nose and mouth were bleeding.Her eyes blurred and two lines of tears fell from her eyes and mingled with the blood.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me, me?\u201d Nan Xun asked puzzled.\u201cXue Ming, Xue Ming, my head is so dizzy, and my eyes can\u2019t see you anymore, I\u2019m so tired, I want to sleep, ah\u2026\u201dNan Xun\u2019s grip on his bloody chest unconsciously loosened and slowly fell back.Xue Ming hooked her waist and hugged her to his bosom. His voice had a trace of fear that even he wasn\u2019t aware of, \u201cXun Xun! Xun Xun\u2026.\u201dXue Ming held Nan Xun in a princess carry and was about to leave but saw the bright fire outside the courtyard.The spiritual beasts with sensitive noses found the Demon King and led the Zuili family to surround the courtyard.They thought it would be a general of the demon realm but didn\u2019t expect the Demon King himself!\u201cWasn\u2019t the Demon King locked in the Qinglong clan\u2019s nine-treasure cage? Why is he here?!\u201d The elders who led the crowd were shocked and frightened.The nine-treasure cage was made of dragon\u2019s keels and ribs for over 200,000 years and forged with extremely rare fire. After being cast, they have added several ancient enchantments. It was the Qinglong clan\u2019s holy treasure! How can the Demon King escape so easily?\u201cXuan\u2019Er!\u201d A beautiful woman screamed from within the crowd.It was unknown if the woman within the Demon King\u2019s arms was alive or dead. Her seven orifices were bleeding. The flesh and blood on her shoulders exposed, the blood flowed like a river and dyed the white dress red, which looked very miserable.\u201cYou wicked beast! What did you do to my daughter?\u201d The head of the Zuili family face changed and violently screamed.Zuili Xuan\u2019s mother who witnessed signs of her being eaten by the Demon King, rolled her eyes backwards and fainted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But changed his mind after seeing the middle-aged man and the woman in his arms look similar. He waved and a few black cloudy fogs descended on the elders who led them.After the elders were wrapped in the black fogs, they ignited spontaneously and screamed.The crowd rushed to extinguish the fire. When they looked up, the blood-covered Demon King left with the woman. It wasn\u2019t determined if she was dead or alive.\u201cHead! Several elders have already, already\u2026\u201d A voice sounded out with grief.Everyone was sorrowful and looked at the piles of black ashes in front of them. Several elders were directly burned to ashes by the Demon King\u2019s black fog!Her father shook his fist fiercely and declared, \u201cThe Demon King has killed my precious daughter and burned five Zuili elders alive. This is an act against the Zuili and warrants revenge! From now on, the Demon King will be the enemy of the Zuili, and we will eradicate this evil beast at any costs!\u201dWhen Nan Xun woke up, she was lying in the Demon King\u2019s arms.The man\u2019s bloody eyes stared at her. The previous bone-eroding hatred from when her flesh was bitten and devoured had disappeared, replaced by an intense burning magma-like love and deep regret.Nan Xun slowly raised her hand and touched the wound on the man\u2019s face. She said sadly, \u201cIf I don\u2019t see you for a few days, you\u2019ll be like this, but it doesn\u2019t matter. In my eyes, you are still as beautiful as when I first saw you.\u201dHer voice was very light, as if she would sleep at any time, and the corner of her mouth was lightly hooked, making her pale cheeks angrier.Xue Ming also hooked his lips. \u201cI forgot that Xun Xun like my face best. I shouldn\u2019t frighten you with this ghastly appearance.\u201dWith that, he covered her palm with a black mist. It went over his face, when the black fog dissipated, the face full of scars became as beautiful as the god of beauty.Nan Xun gently laughed and poked her finger to his face. \u201cYou, I don\u2019t dislike you. You should deal with the wounds on your body first.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201d Xue Ming\u2019s voice was rarely low and gentle.He healed all the wounds on his body, but the wounds on his chest seemed to be more serious and took longer to heal.Then, Nan Xun noticed there was something wrong. She pulled his clothes apart and saw a piercing bloody hole in his chest.\u201cMing, this is a place of Dantian, but they took out your\u2026beast core?\u201d Nan Xun was distress and felt two lines of tears falling and couldn\u2019t help but touch the bloody hole lightly. \u201cHow could they, how could they\u2026\u201dXue Ming touched her head, kissed her gently on the tip of her nose and on her pale lips and whispered, \u201cXun Xun, don\u2019t worry, even if the benwang is poisoned by voodoo, they can\u2019t think this would seriously easily wound benwang. Benwang\u2019s beast core is not gone, but temporarily placed elsewhere.\u201dXue Ming stared deeply at Nan Xun and asked: \u201cXun Xun, did you know that you have been poisoned by voodoo for a long time?\u201dNan Xun widened her eyes, \u201cMing, what did you say? I\u2019m poisoned? When did I get voodoo poisoning?\u201dXue Ming caressed her slender neck, a fragile spot where he could pinch with little strength and kill her. But the woman in his arms didn\u2019t realize it and exposed all her fatal weaknesses in front of him.This woman\u2026 why did she provoke him. He will not let her go. He will never let her go. She will never leave him for the rest of her life.\u201cMing, about what you said, what the hell is going on?\u201d Nan Xun shook his arm.Xue Ming looked at her, gently parting a wisp of hair from the front of her temple to behind her ear and faintly said, \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about when you poisoned me. Although I can\u2019t remember when, I thought it was you who did it. So, I thought you wanted me to die. At that time, I was so angry that I wanted to devour you into my stomach, so you wouldn\u2019t deceive me anymore, but I found out that you didn\u2019t deceive me. After you were voodoo poisoned, I realized that\u2026Xun Xun, before you came to the demon realm, you were given a kind of witchcraft poison. I love you day and night, and the poison that you had passed onto me.\u201dSpeaking of the latter, a pair of blood pupils were full of bloodthirst and murder, and the whole body was wrapped with gloomy violence.When Nan Xun heard this, she groaned in her heart. \u201cLittle eight, what do I need you for? You didn\u2019t even know what the hell I\u2019ve got!\u201dThe void beast laughed and said. \u201cAlthough this god beast has great powers, it is not omnipotent. Even the doctors that came to the Zuili home didn\u2019t know you were voodoo poisoned.\u201d\u201cDid you speak?\u201d Nan Xun was surprised.The void beast snorted, \u201cThe Demon King has been wounded to a dog, and even the beast core been fed to you. Even if he had four eyes and four ears, he can\u2019t perceive me.\u201dNan Xun was shocked.Xue Ming took out his beast core for her?Little eight, who has always been afraid of the Demon King, now wasn\u2019t afraid of him. How seriously injured was he?Nan Xun looked at the man in front of her and suddenly asked, \u201cMing, the poison in your body\u2026\u201dXue Ming smiled slightly, \u201cXun Xun be at ease, it has been solved.\u201dNan Xun breathed a sigh of relief, but after thinking of something, her face changed slightly, and immediately asked: \u201cWhere is your beast core?\u201dXue Ming pursed his lips and said lightly, \u201cXun Xun, don\u2019t worry about it. Anyways, I\u2019m all right.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s eyes suddenly reddened and asked, \u201cIt\u2019s in my body, isn\u2019t it? Tell me?\u201dXue Ming was silent.\u201cTake it back, I don\u2019t want it! I don\u2019t want your beast core, if you give it to me, what would you do? You are so badly injured\u2026I don\u2019t want it. Take it away. Take it away quickly\u2026\u201d Nan Xun kept repeating this sentence, her attitude was determined, and her eyes were full of distress and heartache.The void beast muttered in a low voice, \u201cYour performing skills are progressing rapidly. I\u2019ll give a best new actress award to you later.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s distressed expression almost fell apart, but she was able to resist.Xue Ming paid attention to the distressed and heartbreak within the woman\u2019s eyes, his grasp on her arm suddenly tightened. He suddenly lowered his head and suck on the woman\u2019s lips greedily and insatiably.\u201cMmmm\u2026mmm\u2026\u201d Nan Xun pushed against him vigorously and managed to gasp for breath. She quickly said in a low voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t take the beast core back, don\u2019t think about getting back on my bed again!\u201dShe doesn\u2019t know why this sentence pleased the Demon King, but it made him laugh happily with a pleasant smile. The deep laughter caused his chest to vibrate and it passed through the tight skin to Nan Xun\u2019s ear, his mood was a lot better.\u201cWhat are you laughing at? I\u2019m serious!\u201d Nan Xun was mortified.Xue Ming smirked and shattered her clothes. Without saying a word, she was pulled across the bed and bullied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The voodoo in my body hasn\u2019t been lifted yet!\u201dXue Ming smiled and said: \u201cThe witchcraft poison in my body has been dispelled many times and the poison in Xun Xun\u2019s body is controlled by my beast core, which will not affect me for the time being.\u201dWith that, he merged with her little by little, firmly and began to savor the delicacies under him repeatedly carefully.By the time Nan Xun opened her eyes, the man besides her disappeared.\u201cLittle eight, where did the Demon King go?\u201d Nan Xun yawned and asked.The rehabilitated kinky snake was so terrible that she felt that her body was no longer hers and was sore and weak.The void beast\u2019s tone soars, \u201cThe Demon King went to repair the demon realm for those restless beasts~\u201dNan Xun smiled and asked, \u201cAre you in a good mood, little eight?\u201dThe void beast replied: \u201cLast night, the Demon King\u2019s evil value dropped from 99 to 10. How can this lord be in a bad mood? The power of love is so great that you triggered the Demon King to realize that there are more wonderful things in the world besides killing, killing, eating and eating. I predict that the last 10 evil value will be eliminated when he gets his revenge, haha\u2026\u201dNan Xun, however, wasn\u2019t happy. After a moment of silence, she suddenly asked, \u201cCan he win against the gods and beasts led by the humans and Qinglong without his beast core?\u201dThe void beast exclaimed, \u201cAre you worried about the Demon King? You, you, you didn\u2019t fall in love with the Demon King, right?\u201dNan Xun rolled her eyes. \u201cI clearly remembered that the Demon King bit the flesh on my shoulder. It felt so painful that I wanted to die on the spot.\u201dThe void beast let out a sound.Nan Xun continued, \u201cI remembered vividly that the Demon King swallowed the fake Zuili Xuan. The scene was too beautiful, I dare not look at it, but it\u2019s in my dreams every night, ha ha.\u201dThe void beast let out another sound.Nan Xun said coldly: \u201cDo you think that I will shake m1? Falling in love with an obscene snake that would eat me? If I hadn\u2019t been smart, quick-witted and a first-rated actress, I would have already been devoured by that pervert!\u201dThe void beast: \u201cShort oil, it\u2019s not good, I\u2019m afraid you would fall. You must know what is false to you. Your goal is to return to your own world. Don\u2019t forget this in your heart.\u201dNan Xun looked at the night pearl embedded in the wall. Her dark pupils were particularly bright illuminated by the faint light.She\u2019s been awake.Perhaps she had a moment where Xue Ming was in her heart, but she has always been a sensible and almost indifferent person, clearly remembering her purpose.Besides, if she hadn\u2019t been lucky and had high EQ, she would have really been eaten by Xue Ming! It\u2019s true, it\u2019s not fake!The Demon King will disappear for a while every day, and the remaining time he spends in the palace, pressing Nan Xun and shamelessly brewing sauce.At first, it was simply pressing and thrusting. Later, she didn\u2019t know who the Demon King was instructed by. He was suddenly enlightened, and tried countless venues, such as the dressing table, stone tables, floors and even the walls.The posture changed alongside the venue and unlocked the 9,981 styles with great exhilarating pleasure.Nan Xun wants to curse but couldn\u2019t even exert the strength to swear.\u201cXun Xun, I\u2019ve written a war document for the humans and beast gods. We agreed to fight in a decade, regardless of the outcome, the two sides will no longer fight for ten thousand years and the Yinchuan continent will be peaceful.\u201d Xue Ming\u2019s big palm caressed Nan Xun\u2019s soft waist fondly. Accompanied by such hooliganism was his extremely serious tone.Nan Xun weakly sighed, lifted her soft finger and pointed to his chest. She said, \u201cMing, the voodoo in my body is gone, you can take back your beast core.\u201dXue Ming\u2019s snake tongue slowly stretched out to lick her lips and his eyes smiled, \u201cXun Xun, do you know how many people in this world wants my beast core? How can you always be so dismissive of what others dream of?\u201dAs for the long serpent tongue on her face, Nan Xun was used to it. When she heard his words, she seriously retorted, \u201cI just don\u2019t want you to have an accident. Ten years will be a drop in the bucket. You have to use that time to recover your strength.\u201dAfter saying that, Nan Xun told little eight in her heart, \u201cI feel like a piece of shit. All these love phrases are handy, this is all thanks to the \u300aWords of Love Book\u300bthat little eight gave me.\u201dShe wonders if the Demon King has almost recovered recently. The number of replies from little eight is getting less and less, this time there was no response.Nan Xun\u2019s love words caused Xue Ming\u2019s heart to sound. He hooked Nan Xun\u2019s nose and his eyes almost overflowed with indulgence. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll listen to Xun Xun and end the war as soon as possible. Didn\u2019t you mention that you wanted to go sightseeing all over the country? I\u2019ll accompany you when the war is over.\u201dNan Xun happily wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said.\u201dAfter that, she kissed him on her own initiative and said vaguely: \u201cCome and take the beast core.\u201dXue Ming chuckles and frolicked with her for a while. His long tongue reaches out and plays with the woman\u2019s body, after a while it hooks out the beast core.A decade in the demon realm quickly passes. Within those ten years, Xue Ming and Nan Xun was an old married couple. Nan Xun would cook meals daily while Xue Ming handled government affairs during the day and would later rush home to eat together with her.No one could ever imagine that Xue Ming, who was once a bloodthirsty monster that enjoyed eating raw meat and drinking cold blood, would skillfully grasp his chopsticks and place vegetables in Nan Xun\u2019s bowl. His face drowned to pamper her, \u201cWhy do you always eat meat, eat some vegetables.\u201dNan Xun was full of meat. At the sight of the pile of green vegetables in her bowl, her face suddenly changed, humph, and immediately used her chopstick to place a piece of carrot in Xue Ming\u2019s bowl. She smiled with her eyes bent, \u201cMing, it\u2019s good for your health to eat more carrots.\u201dSuccessfully seeing Xue Ming\u2019s face changed, Nan Xun laughed.She inadvertently discovered that Xue Ming particularly was averse to eating carrots. In fact, this vegetable wasn\u2019t a carrot, but the taste and color were very similar to them, so she called it a carrot.Once Xue Ming bullied Nan Xun, she made carrots. After a few days from being tossed by the other, she was upset and made a plate of fried carrots every day.Although Xue Ming\u2019s face changed, he obediently used his chopstick and ate the carrot Nan Xun gave him. Then looked at her with a straight face and said, \u201cWell, you eat all the vegetables in your bowl until there is none left.\u201dNan Xun could only eat the vegetables with a bitter face.When they were full, they were at a loss and fell silent.\u201cMing, in three days will be the day of way.\u201d Nan Xun said.Xue Ming sighed, \u201cYou can rest assure that I will not be in trouble, until the end of this war, regardless of the outcome, the two sides abide to the agreement, truce for thousands of years to come.\u201dNan Xun reached out her hand and held his hand, \u201cYou must promise me to return safely.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one but me can take it off. If you encounter anything, shake the bracelet and call my name three times. No matter what happens I\u2019ll find you and rush to your location.\u201dNan Xun stared curiously at the bracelet on her wrist, swayed it a few times, then called out Xue Ming three times and asked with a smile, \u201cBut that\u2019s it?\u201dXue Ming pinched her nose and raised his thin lips and said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s it.\u201dWhen Xue Ming left, Nan Xun yawned and said lazily, \u201cLittle eight, I\u2019ve almost forgotten what the days outside were like, it\u2019s been ten years.\u201dAi, isn\u2019t she considered a hidden mistress?At that time, she was carried back to the demon domain by the Demon King\u2019s white sedan chair. She never bowed to the heavens and earth and couldn\u2019t be considered his first wife.2 She was like a little mistress raised by the Demon King and was hidden all day long.Nan Xun has been in the demon realm for so long, and there were very few beasts who have seen her real face.Regarding the white sedan chair, Nan Xun later asked Xue Ming its meaning. The man innocently replied, because he felt that white suits her well, so he deliberately made a certain white sedan chair from ten-thousand-year-old snow silk.Nan Xun listened and couldn\u2019t laugh or cry.The void beast yawned. \u201cLooking at your kind love show every day, this god\u2019s eyes are almost blind. The good news is that the Demon King\u2019s evil value has dropped to 5.\u201dNan Xun touched her chin and asked, \u201cWhen I eliminate all of Xue Ming\u2019s evil value, will I leave the world soon?\u201dThe void beast answered, \u201cThat\u2019s right, at most, give it two or three days.\u201dNan Xun suddenly fell silent and didn\u2019t speak.This war is destined to be grand and unprecedented. In order not to endanger innocent people and the surrounding creatures, the participating parties set the location of the battlefield in a wasteland. The wasteland spanned for hundreds of miles, even if it was an intense battle, the battlefield was large enough.The night before the war, Xue Ming embraced Nan Xun to a pancake as usual.Nan Xun was under him moaning, anyway she was too lazy to move, and let him have his way by being tossed about by the other party.When the pancake was branded vigorously, Xue Ming kissed her earlobe and his voice said something gently.Nan Xun\u2019s brain was confused. She didn\u2019t hear what he said. She just thought that he was saying sweet nothings and gave a vague response.In an instant, the pair of blood pupils brightened and stared at her with a burning gaze.Nan Xun felt frightened in her heart and asked the void beast weakly. \u201cLittle eight, did I just promised something that I shouldn\u2019t have?\u201dThe void beast didn\u2019t respond to her, of course.However, Nan Xun faintly heard little eight\u2019s laughter of happiness and felt misfortune vaguely, and her heart felt worse.Suddenly, Nan Xun\u2019s pupils shrank and her heart seemed to explode with a bang.In the blink of an eye, the Demon King, who was still a beautiful man, transformed into a complete beast \u2013 the four clawed red-blood snake!Nan Xun was frightened and dumbfounded. She stared dully at the huge snake head hanging over her. The thick red snake body wrapped her naked body all around, leaving only her neck and head exposed. The two dragon claws were on both sides of her and the huge red flesh wings covered one person and one beast inside.The red snake trusts Xun Xun, he licked and stared at her little stunned face.Nan Xun\u2019s heart was already filled like a river3 but didn\u2019t show on her face. She restored her powerful heart within her chest, then gently hugged the snake\u2019s head and raised her head slightly and kissed the snake\u2019s mouth.\u2026The next day, the Demon King had already gone to battle. Nan Xun buried her face in the pillow and didn\u2019t want to see anyone.The void beast coughed and said, \u201cWell, last night\u2019s nightmare has passed. The Demon King\u2019s evil value has dropped to 1. Oh, we should be able to leave this fucking world soon~\u201dNan Xun raised her face and her eyes were red. \u201cLittle eight, can I still believe you?\u201d\u201cYes, of course! Who else can you believe in besides this Lord?\u201dThis time, the beast-man war is impossible to conclude within several years. Nan Xun hinted, that this time Xue Ming would not starve her again. He directly sent her a storage ring that could store living things, this was an emperor ranked treasure. Fucking amazing, once Nan Xun put it on, she didn\u2019t want to take it off, she loved it.There were many spiritual beasts within the storage ring. When Nan Xun was hungry, she would take out a spiritual beast to roast or pick some vegetables to eat.Nan Xun eats and sleeps, living like a rice worm4.One day, Nan Xun didn\u2019t realize five months have passed. She pinched her waist and asked sadly, \u201cLittle eight, do you think I\u2019ve gain weight?\u201dThe void beast sneered, \u201cYou should be happy if you eat and sleep all day and only gained one roll instead of two.\u201dNan Xun sighed and said, \u201cOtherwise, what else can I do? I read all the scripts Xue Ming sent in a few days.\u201d\u201cWould you like me to give you a live broadcast of the battle between the Demon King, the humans and the god beasts?\u201d The void beast suddenly suggested.Nan Xun asked hesitatingly, \u201cWill it be very bloody?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the Demon King eating people, but you\u2019re afraid of blood?\u201dNan Xun thought about it and agreed.As a result of the earlier trauma, Nan Xun could calmly watch the scenes of missing arms and broken legs.\u201cOh shit, little eight! Look, there is a very powerful blue dragon in the middle of the battlefield! Is this the first blue dragon beast born from the masses?\u201d Nan Xun was somewhat excited.\u201cAnd over there. Look, it\u2019s a black snake with huge flesh wings, a Divine Serpent?\u201d Nan Xun quickly pointed to another area.Nan Xun had seen Xue Ming\u2019s body not too long ago. At a glance, she could see that it was a Divine serpent.In contrast, the bloodstained beast had four more red claws, like dragon claws, sharper scales and spikes on its spine, not black but red, it was nothing special.It stands to reason that although the four-clawed red-blood snake is a mutated variant and has a bloodthirsty nature, it couldn\u2019t be denied that it had the blood of the god beast, Divine Serpent and therefore was a member of the family.But why are those Divine Serpents so cold and heartless, that they want to put their own blood to death?Xue Ming once said that when he was young, he was bullied and suffered all kinds of humiliation because he was different from his siblings. He endured his bloodthirsty nature and all kinds of humiliations silently and never took vengeance, but even so, he was not liked or recognized.Until one time, he couldn\u2019t resist eating a fangled red-skinned wild boar.His way of eating was very bloody, he directly plunged his claws into the belly of the red-skinned wild boar. He grabbed its guts and ate it, smearing blood on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the time, the young snake was frightened by the bloody Xue Ming. He plotted a grand scheme in his heart out of fear.He took a badly wounded Divine Serpent cub to the place where Xue Ming was hunting and then used the blind eye technique on the cub.It wasn\u2019t a young Divine Serpent that Xue Ming saw but a red-skinned wild boar. He devoured the red-skinned wild boar into his stomach.He didn\u2019t know that this was planned by his half-brother. Nor did he know that he had eaten his kin cruelly or that it was a seriously injured baby.All of this was witnessed by the Divine Serpent\u2019s elders and they were shocked by his bloodthirsty cruelty.At once, Xue Ming explained, but no matter his explanation, the clan didn\u2019t listen. They only believed what they saw with their eyes. Even his biological parents were frightened by his brutality and were ashamed of him.So Xue Ming was punished to be executed, no one believed him, and everyone wanted him to die.In order to integrate into the clan, he endured his bloodthirsty nature, but in the end, it was for naught. So, he blackened and escaped from his clan with half his life, then he broke his self-restraint and freed his bloodthirsty nature. He devoured spiritual beasts or whatever he encountered in a bloody manner.He constantly devoured and became more and more powerful. Later, he swallowed the previous Demon King alive and then became the new Demon King. He continued to act freely.From his actions, the four-clawed red blood snake was well-known for its fierce reputation. When the people, beasts, and god beasts heard of it, the Divine Serpent regarded him as a disgrace. In order to eradicate the scoundrel, the Divine Serpent even cooperated with its eternal rival, the Qinglong clan.When Xue Ming talked about his past, his face was calm and indifferent, but Nan Xun was distressed.Xue Ming was once a small pure steam bun. Unfortunately, God had allowed him to become a fierce bloodthirsty creature.When Nan Xun thought about it, she immediately lost any good feelings she had for the Divine Serpents in the battlefield. Even the mighty Qinglong no longer were in her eyes.\u201cLittle eight, have you seen Xue Ming? Why haven\u2019t I seen him yet?\u201d Nan Xun asked.\u201cHe\u2019s that little black spot.\u201d The void beast answered.Nan Xun squinted for a long time before she saw a small black dot on the head of a two-tailed black python. He was wearing black robes which made it hard to see him.After Nan Xun found Xue Ming, her eyes followed him and watched him stand on top of the python and her view zoomed in. He casually waved a powerful bloody red and black mist which directly entangled with its target. It would burn a god beast, or an emperor ranked Xuan from the human race, they quickly screamed and turned into a pile of ashes.\u201cOh, my family pervert is really awesome\u2026\u201d Nan Xun sighed.Watching the Qinglong lead several other dragon beasts to attack from the front, while several Divine Serpents circled to the rear, Nan Xun breathed tightly and angrily shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t bully, too shameless!\u201dThe void beast said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, your family pervert can handle it. Watch carefully.\u201dWait, the pervert is a pervert. Why add the word \u201cyour family\u201d?Just as the void beast\u2019s voice fell, the black dot on the python\u2019s head flew off.A thick black mist rapidly gathered around the black spot, forming into a large black cloud.At this moment, all the beasts and god beasts who were fighting, stopped and stared at the vast black cloud with a look of fear in their eyes.Nan Xun also stared at the dark clouds.When the black clouds dissipated, a huge beast covered the sky and sun.Looking at the behemoth, Nan Xun\u2019s mouth became an O-shape. The last time she saw the Demon King\u2019s body was really reduced several folds! In addition to the palace\u2019s darkness and being shy during the time, she didn\u2019t take a good look at the Demon King\u2019s beastly body.But now\u2026The fierce Demon King was now in beast form and every person was full of fear and retreated for their lives.Huge bony wings stretched out and covered the huge serpent for half a day. The red blood scales densely covered the snake, there were four sharp claws on its hands and feet. A cold bloodthirsty aura overflowed from the snake\u2019s eyes. A row of sharp barbs appeared on the top of its head to its back, like a row of blood-colored knives inserted along its spine. Its large bloody mouth flashed silver and revealed the sharp poisonous fangs!Nan Xun touched her chest, her heart beating strongly from embracing and frolicking with the beast not too long ago.The four-clawed red blood snake in its beastly form was simply overbearing. In a blink of an eye, it swallowed numerous human beings, who were powerful Xuan leading the frontline, at least above the emperor rank. They didn\u2019t even struggle before being swallowed by the Demon King.Nan Xun shivered.The scene was a bloodbath and Xue Ming was eating people. But before they were still\u2026all real living people, and in a twinkling of an eye, they entered the Demon King\u2019s belly.\u201cIf you can\u2019t watch, don\u2019t force yourself.\u201d The void beast said thoughtfully and turned off the live broadcast.Nan Xun had some regrets, but when she thought of the scene just now, she accepted the void beast\u2019s actions obediently.Nan Xun was preparing to lay down and sleep but felt the entire palace tremble.\u201cIt\u2019s the enchantment. Someone damaged the enchantment outside the palace!\u201d Nan Xun\u2019s expression changed.There were too many people or beasts outside that wanted her dead. Currently, the Demon King was too far away from the demon realm and was in the battlefield in the wilderness. Although this enchantment was created by him, its effectiveness is less powerful now in his absence. It\u2019s not impossible for his enchantment to be breached by some powerful individuals.Nan Xun listened to the banging sound and her heart jumped.\u201cA Divine Serpent and your beastly cousin are breaking the enchantment.\u201d The void beast said.Nan Xun sighed with relief, at least it wasn\u2019t beasts who eat people without saying a word.\u201cBy the way, your father is there as well.\u201d The void beast hesitated to add.Nan Xun suddenly felt happy. \u201cHe thought that I was locked up by the Demon King, so he came to save me?\u201dThe void beast remained silent for a moment and replied, \u201cMaybe.\u201dNan Xun listened to its tone, and it didn\u2019t sound right but didn\u2019t think much about it.Since her cheap father was present, the Divine Serpent and the beastly cousin wouldn\u2019t harm her.The few voices sounded flustered, but the people outside worked tirelessly to destroy the enchantment.\u201cWith your father\u2019s secret technique against the heavens and the Divine Serpent, this enchantment will be destroyed soon.\u201d The void beast warned.What? Against the heavens?Nan Xun whispered, \u201cIs he crazy? That\u2019s the most powerful forbidden clan technique. He dares to use the secret technique and isn\u2019t afraid of the heavens!\u201dBut in the next moment, the palace\u2019s entry door broke with a thump and she heard a sharp bang from outside the palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She took several big steps towards him to welcome him. \u201cDad, why did you\u2014?\u201dPow.Before Nan Xun could finish speaking, Zuili Qing Shi slapped her. She was sent flying to the ground with her mouth bleeding and her eyes saw stars.Nan Xun covered her swollen face, incredulously looked at her cheap father. She shouted at little eight within her heart, \u201cI was so worried that something had happened to him, but he directly slaps me? Come on, is this really Zuili father?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cReally.\u201dThe Zuili father pointed at her and shouted angrily, \u201cEvil child, evil child! Father thought you were killed by the Demon King but didn\u2019t think you were in cahoots with that beast. The entire Zuili clan is fighting against the Demon King, but you live comfortably in the Demon King\u2019s palace! If it hadn\u2019t been for Lord Hei Ze who seen you with his own eyes, then father wouldn\u2019t have believed it, you, you\u2026you are the shame of the Zuili family!The man next to him, dressed in navy-blue said indifferently: \u201cZuili head, these reprimands can be said later, now it\u2019s time to do important business.\u201d\u201cYes, uncle, let\u2019s listen to Lord Hei Ze and do business first. I believe that cousin had a temporary fascination. If she returns properly, she will turn over a new leaf.\u201d Qin Yuexuan said.Nan Xun listened to the three people\u2019s words and intuitively felt that bad things were about to happen.She didn\u2019t want to leave here, but in front of these three, she couldn\u2019t resist.Nan Xun was knocked unconscious by her cheap father and carried away.Almost at the same moment that the palace\u2019s barrier was breached, the eyes of the four-clawed red-blood snake shrank sharply within the battlefield and the red within his eyes were gleaming. He wanted to return to the palace but was entangled with several stinky dragons and Divine Serpents in front of him. Only when his back was cut by a Qinglong dragon did his bloodthirst overtook his mind. Now, it was a fantasy for him to teleport and leave the battlefield.Xue Ming was impatient and finally went into an increasingly violent killing spree.As soon as Nan Xun woke up, she saw several people standing around her: her father, her mother, her beastly cousin, and the Divine Serpent named Hei Ze.Her mother took her hand and cried. \u201cXuan\u2019Er, how can you do such a foolish thing? Who is the Demon King? He eats human flesh and drinks blood and had killed several elders in our family ten years ago. How can you be bewitched by him? Did you forget that you are Zuili clan member and the daughter of the Zuili head!?\u201dNan Xun knows that her cheap parents have really been hurt by her, but now she felt chilly after listening to this.Have they ever thought much about her when they sent her to the demon domain? Would they rather have her die with dignity by being buried in the Demon King\u2019s stomach for the sake of righteousness, instead of living well now, was it so wrong?She believes that she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong with people, but just \u201clove\u201d the Demon King, is this really so unacceptable in this world?Nan Xun suddenly sneered, looked up at her cheap parents and whispered, \u201cFather, Mother, did you know that the elders poisoned me with voodoo? From the moment I was chosen, I was a chest piece sacrificed for their sake in the name of their so-called righteousness. I was long dead in their eyes before.\u201dWhen he heard this, his eyes twinkled and were ashamed. \u201cXuan\u2019Er, this matter was only known later by father. Although some elders were apologetic for you, they have devoted themselves to the Zuili family for many years. All their decisions were for the sake of the Zuili family, and also for the sake of all lifeforms in the world. It\u2019s difficult for this world to be peaceful unless the Demon King is eliminated.\u201dNan Xun smiled slightly and muttered, \u201cSo, I should be dead?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it!\u201d Zuili Qing Shi shouted with an iron-blue face.1 You were with the Demon King, disgraced the lintel2, but father would have rather you died from that voodoo poisoning!\u201dHer mother held her within her arms and cried, \u201cXuan\u2019Er, don\u2019t talk back to your father, admit your wrongs, Mother begs you.\u201dNan Xun muttered, \u201cI\u2019m all right. Are you trying to take my life by capturing me? If so, then do it!\u201dThe void beast was shocked by her non-humble attitude and sincerely admired it. \u201cNow you look like a heroine that is about to die, especially handsome.\u201dNan Xun immediately retorted in her heart,\u201d Little eight, can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m procrastinating? Ouch, why can\u2019t my perverted family come rescue me? I\u2019m going to lose my unyielding attitude if he doesn\u2019t come soon enough.\u201dThe void beast: \u2026It was blind just now, really.Nan Xun forcefully refused to admit her mistakes and continued with her unyielding attitude to the very end. So, her father went straight to the Divine Serpent with a conflicted heart and said, \u201cLord Hei Ze, let\u2019s do it. I don\u2019t think I ever had such a daughter before.\u201dHer mother knelt on the ground with tears in her eyes. \u201cPlease, Lord Hei Ze, let the little girl go. She was only bewitched by the Demon King and is in a state of confusion.\u201dNan Xun was about to open her mouth but was surprised to find her mother pleading the Divine Serpent in order to protect her little life.The Divine Serpent, Hei Ze said lightly, \u201cMadam, please, I can\u2019t take her life, but temporarily seal the blood in her soul engraved by the blood pact, and then\u2026\u201dAfter listening to the Divine Serpent\u2019s idea, the beautiful woman held Nan Xun tightly within her arms and gently said, \u201cXuan\u2019Er, don\u2019t be afraid, don\u2019t be afraid, Lord Hei Ze just wants your one hand.\u201dWhat? One hand?Nan Xun\u2019s eyes widened as she watched the serpent come towards her. He laid a seal on her forehead and then she watched her mother lift her left hand which was wearing the blood bead bracelet. Then the serpent, Hei Ze, gently waved a dark blade towards her wrist.\u201cAh-\u201cIn the next moment, Nan Xun gave a terrible cry and turned as pale as paper.They actually cut off her hand!Nan Xun looked at the bloody slender jade hand on the ground and shed tears.The void beast was puzzled. \u201cDoes it hurt that much? I just helped you shield 90% of the pain.\u201dNan Xun replied, \u201cThank you, little eight. No wonder it didn\u2019t hurt so much just now. But I didn\u2019t cry because of pain, but because I lost my hand and now, I\u2019m a cripple. For my obsession with beauty, it might as well have killed me.\u201dThe void beast: \u201cOh, well, then that should have hurt you to death just now.\u201dNan Xun thought she would always be missing a hand from now on. But she didn\u2019t expect that in the next second, her mother would feed her a medicinal herb and gently coaxed, \u201cXuan\u2019Er, don\u2019t cry, don\u2019t cry. This is a muscle-growing bone pill, after eating it, you will grow a new palm quickly.\u201dNan Xun was overjoyed. However, she had just experienced great sorrow and joy, thus her expression looked extremely indifferent. On the contrary, she looked as if her sorrow was no greater than heartbreak.The black Divine Serpent, Hei Ze left, holding the bracelet that Xue Ming had personally placed on Nan Xun, which was stained with blood. In addition, he took Nan Xun\u2019s dress outside and spilled her blood on it.Nan Xun was somewhat confused and asked the void beast, \u201cLittle eight, this serpent, who isn\u2019t a good bird at first sight, took my bracelet and bloody clothes and left. Say, what do you think he\u2019s going to do with it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They want to stimulate the Demon King by your death. Don\u2019t they know the terrible consequences of the Demon King\u2019s anger?\u201dAt this time, Zuili Xuan\u2019s beastly cousin, Qin Yuexuan just answered her question. He smiled at Zuili Qing Shi and said, \u201cPlease take it easy uncle. The Demon King has feelings for cousin. Once he sees cousin\u2019s remains, he is bound to be chaotic. My father is a powerful dream weaver. He will use this opportunity to drag him into a dream and trap him in it. At this time, we will kill the Demon King.\u201dZuili Qing Shi nodded randomly and said wearily, \u201cI drove nearly half the Zuili into the battlefield, and I also tried my best to help Lord Hei Ze to get what he wanted and even used the secret technique against the heavens. We did everything we could as members of the Zuili family\u2026\u201dNan Xun was shocked and asked the void beast, \u201cLittle eight, what\u2019s the matter with Xue Ming? Does he really think I was killed by them and will fall for their trap?\u201dThe void beast confidently said, \u201cAbsolutely not. How big do you think your face is? That pervert won\u2019t die for you no matter how much he likes you.\u201dNan Xun replied with a sigh of relief, \u201cI\u2019m relieved to have you.\u201d Then added, \u201cThere is still an evil value of 1 that hasn\u2019t been eliminated. Xue Ming can\u2019t have an accident at this time.\u201dThe void beast said, \u201cOh, do I need you to explain?\u201dNan Xun said no, then laid down on the bed with a peace of mind.Not long after, Nan Xun was awakened by a sharp scream in her mind.Nan Xun like a carp turns and sat up, rubbing her head, \u201cLittle eight, did you see a ghost? Your scream is so harsh.\u201dThe void beast cried, \u201cAh ah ah! It\u2019s a thousand times more terrible than a ghost. Do you know what just happened? Motherfucker, the Demon King\u2019s evil value jumped back to 100! It\u2019s not 99, it\u2019s 100!\u201dNan Xun: \u201c\u2026Little eight, don\u2019t tease me. It\u2019s not a funny joke at all.\u201dThe void beast continued to cry, \u201cI\u2019m not joking.\u201dNan Xun staggered to the window, the sky is dark now. There were no stars in the sky, it was a cloudy night.Nan Xun looked at the night sky and said expressionlessly, \u201cI have strolled in my Doudou1 for more than a decade, but in the end used a wicker basket to draw water2, all my hopes and efforts were for nothing. Little eight, my heart is bitter.\u201dThe void beast sobbed, \u201cMy heart is more bitter, if the Demon King\u2019s evil value becomes 0, I would have gotten a lot of merits in this world alone and would have succeed sooner, but now I have nothing\u2026\u201dNan Xun wasn\u2019t in the mood to comfort it. Suddenly, she thought of something. Her face suddenly changed, and she shouted, \u201cLittle eight, fast! Let me see what\u2019s happening in the battlefield!\u201dIn the bloody battlefield, the Qinglong and Divine Serpent were in the same side, facing against the four clawed red blood snake.Nan Xun sees the Divine Serpent called Hei Ze.Hei Ze carried bloody clothes in his hand and had a cruel sneer on his lips. \u201cXue Ming, I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time, I trust you\u2019ve been well since we last met.\u201d At this point, he paused, then picked up the corners of his mouth, \u201c\u2026My brother.\u201dXue Ming\u2019s eyes fell straight on the bloody garments and he emitted a chilling bone eroding aura. \u201cWhatever you say, benwang will not believe it.\u201dHei Ze laughed and sneered, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe it, do you? The enchantment outside the palace has been broken. And the small darling person inside was taken care of by me.\u201dAfter that, he threw the bloody clothes in front of Xue Ming and spread open his palm and revealed the blood-stained bracelet. \u201cThis bracelet is made of the toughest scales from your body, moreover you placed a cursed enchantment on it. No one can remove it unless she does. Also, your blood contract that is branded on her soul, can\u2019t you feel it?\u201d\u201cXue Ming, don\u2019t deceive yourself, that human woman that you\u2019ve been protecting has been\u2026dead.\u201d\u201cNo, impossible! Xun Xun can\u2019t die, she can\u2019t die! I promised her that we can visit the mountains and rivers. I haven\u2019t fulfilled her wish yet. She can\u2019t die, she can\u2019t die\u2026\u201d Xue Ming held the bloody clothes and muttered to himself, looking crazy.Hei Ze nodded slightly toward the dragon and the two made a move behind them without a trace.The people behind quietly began to retreat.Now that the Demon King is in a state of confusion, it\u2019s the best time to activate the ancient blood evil spirit array.Earlier when the battlefield was determined, the Qinglong and Hei Ze asked for this secret array from the Zuili clan. In the center of the battlefield, a great array of ancient blood demons and evil spirits was set up. In ancient times, the great array of blood evil spirits used a blood sacrifice and called the world\u2019s spirits, with their tremendous power, can destroy souls within the array.This array won\u2019t be completed until every last living creature was swallowed and then the array will be released.As long as everyone exits the array\u2019s boundaries, the Qin family leader will release the dream weaver to lead the Demon King into the array. At that time, when the array opens, even with the Demon King\u2019s great capability, he won\u2019t be able to escape the ancient blood evil spirit array!But before the array could be opened, people saw the Demon King suddenly raised his head and laughed. He held the bloody clothes of the human woman and his bloody-red eyes were dripping. His laughter was worse than crying.\u201cNow that Xun Xun is dead, what are you still doing alive? What\u2019s left in this world? Better to be all destroyed! All destroyed, hahahaha\u2026.\u201dThe man in the black robe looked like a handsome demon god and laughed wildly, his whole body was full of blood and rage. The Emperor-classed Xuan people nearby were bleeding from their nose, kneeling on the ground.Hei Ze\u2019s eyes were wide opened and he yelled in horror, \u201cXue Ming, you, what are you going to do?\u201dXue Ming looked at him. His eyes were sinister and cold. He slightly smiled but didn\u2019t reply to his words. His eyes turned and fell on the Qinglong. His voice is as cold as ice. \u201cQinglong, I have no injustice or hatred towards you, but you have schemed against benwang several times and even united with Hei Ze. Along with Hei Ze, I hate you very much. Today, benwang curse your Qinglong clan in the name of the four clawed red blood snake\u2026in the future, it will be doomed!\u201dThe Qinglong\u2019s eyes glared and said angrily, \u201cXue Ming, how dare you!\u201dHei Ze yelled at the Qinglong, \u201cDon\u2019t argue with him, leave quickly and start the ancient blood evil spirit array!\u201dThe Demon King\u2019s mouth is slightly hooked, revealing a bloody sneer, \u201cIt\u2019s too late, you can\u2019t run, everyone can be buried with benwang and Xun Xun!\u201dNan Xun who watched the battle, at this moment widened her eyes, \u201cLittle eight, little eight! What is he going to do?\u201dThe void beast was also forced. \u201cI guess he\u2019s going to explode his beast core, fuck! Tens of thousands of years from a fierce ancient beast, if the beast core explodes, the whole\u2013\u201dBefore little eight could finish, the image was interrupted and the whole ground suddenly shook violently.The dark night sky was illuminated by the dazzling bloody light. At that moment, the night sky was as bright as day.Not long after, a loud bang came from a distant place, which made the eardrums ache.Nan Xun\u2019s legs went soft and collapsed onto the ground. She stupidly stared at the bright sky, watching the blood light scatter bit by bit and the sky darkened again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The blast radius made everyone in the battlefield \u2013 human, beast, god beast, follow him to ashes. If the battlefield wasn\u2019t previously contained by the humans, I\u2019m afraid that most of the Yinchuan continent would have been destroyed by him.\u201dNan Xun suddenly covered her head. After a dull pain, there were many things in her mind, many essences of beast taming, ancient witchcraft, secret techniques and arrays.Just now, she had awakened the unique heritage of the Zuili clan.The ancestors of the Zuili clan, or the Zuili themselves, were a very intelligent ethnic group. They learned this method from the big demons and beasts. They passed on their memories through their bloodline which sealed their wisdom into their blood through an ancient secret technique. This allows their descendants to inherit their memories.As soon as the time is ripe, the inheritance will awaken, the better the qualifications, the higher quality the inheritance will become.Nan Xun didn\u2019t expect to awaken her inheritance at this time.If the Demon King is dead, what could she do if she awakens and inherits it?Nan Xun roughly turned over the things in her mind. Her eyes brightened after discovering a resurrection skill. Since there is a resurrection skill, can she resurrect the Demon King without knowing how to do so?However, after Nan Xun examined the resurrection technique, her heart and liver trembled and gave up on the idea immediately.What, it uses hundreds of blood-related grievances to gather broken souls, it uses hundreds of loyal servants\u2019 flesh and blood to create the new flesh and so on? This technique makes Nan Xun\u2019s back turn cold.Nan Xun pinched an enchantment by breaking the stone, which had been made by the Zuili\u2019s to hide her secretly and she quickly dashed out.\u201cXuan\u2019Er! Xuan\u2019Er, where are you going?\u201d Her mother has been guarding the door and was surprised to see Nan Xun break out.\u201cMother, I am going to the battlefield. Don\u2019t stop me this time, you can\u2019t stop me anyways.\u201d Nan Xun looked firm.At the end of her speech, Nan Xun suddenly closed her eyes and instantly, a huge spiritual force was released.\u201cAll Spiritual beasts, please help me.\u201d Nan Xun looked into the distance.A natural anomaly occurred, the earth shook and all the beasts within the clansmen homes rushed out of the houses and gathered in the hall with constant noise.At this time, the sound of birds and beasts suddenly came from afar.A golden-winged Dapeng flies quickly, followed by a green phoenix, black feather eagle, colorful birds and many others. The birds of various attributes arrived and the light reflecting the different colors dyed the entire sky gorgeously.The beasts also rushed in, and all the people immediately gave way, watching the various black-spotted cheetahs and iron-winged lions spread their claws to her side.Everyone\u2019s hearts were shaken.They were all Zuili clansmen. Naturally, they can detect that these beasts were summoned. However, those clansmen with ability, including Zuili Yuejian, Qin Yuexuan and many others of the younger generation, all followed the Zuili adults to the battlefield, and all the spiritual beasts within a several miles radius were also taken to the battlefield with them. So now, where did such a large wave of spiritual beasts come from?If they were from a distant place, how powerful is the Zuili master\u2019s spiritual abilities who summoned these beasts!They saw with their own eyes that a group of birds and beasts had entered Zuili Xuan\u2019s home. Not long after, the first golden winged Dapeng flew out to the sky over the home. On the back of the golden winged Dapeng, stood a woman in white.White clothes fluttering, untainted by even a speck of dust1, she was surrounded by the spiritual birds and animals truly like the Ninth Heaven Goddess.\u201cXuan\u2019Er! Xuan\u2019Er, don\u2019t go-\u201d Zuili Xuan\u2019s mother stumbled out and looked at the person who was far away and burst into tears.Everyone said that the daughter she gave birth to, didn\u2019t live up to expectations. If she didn\u2019t have the qualifications to be a Zuili, then\u2026who could call themselves Zuili?If they knew this before, the elders would not have sacrifice her at all.She\u2019s going to find that evil beast and accompany it to die!People didn\u2019t know that the battlefield had just been reduced to ashes. They thought Nan Xun was going to die, but Nan Xun went to collect the remains.The golden-winged Dapeng directly took Nan Xun to the battlefield, and the group of following spiritual beasts smelled countless of their companions and started to whine.The bloody aura in the battlefield has yet to dissipate. The spiritual animals were afraid and only dare wander outside the battlefield. The golden-winged Dapeng is a distant relative to a beast god and could withstand the bloody atmosphere and sent Nan Xun to the center of the battlefield.Nan Xun looked around, it was empty with only the bright red blood on the ground flowing and it smelled tangy.\u201cNothing\u2026\u201d Nan Xun murmured, suddenly feeling some pain in her chest.The golden-winged Dapeng next to her rubbed her leg with its head intimately, as if to comfort her.\u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you.\u201d Nan Xun rubbed the golden-winged Dapeng\u2019s two golden hairs on top of its head.One person and one beast stepped over the bloody river on the ground and looked a hundred miles around and the remnants of the battlefield filled their eyes.Nan Xun\u2019s hand shook slightly and she couldn\u2019t help but whisper. \u201cLittle eight, you told me to regard everything in this world as a game. The things in this game are not real. However, these were obviously living people, living people\u2026\u201dAfter a moment of silence, the void beast replied, \u201cLife and death is destiny. Don\u2019t be too upset.\u201dIn fact, the saddest thing was that she was about to succeed in changing the Demon King, but at the last moment, the Divine Serpent, Hei Ze destroyed this possibility, come on, he\u2019s truly the real beast.She didn\u2019t know how long she walked for. Nan Xun finally found several red blood scales in a pool of blood.\u201c\u2026Xue Ming.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s eyes flickered slightly, then crouched down and carefully gathered the scales into her hands.The golden-winged Dapeng saw the scales of the four-clawed red blood snake and called out.Nan Xun quickly comforted it. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I just want to bury the Demon King\u2019s remains. Now in this battlefield, the evil spirits and resentment doesn\u2019t disperse. We can only bury the Demon King\u2019s remains to calm his anger.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. These evil spirits and grievances are not only the Demon King\u2019s, but also the tens of thousands of people and beasts!\u201d A voice full of hate came from ahead.Nan Xun suddenly looked up and saw Hei Ze in the flesh and blood standing in front of her.\u201cLittle eight, why isn\u2019t Hei Ze dead? He was the closest to Xue Ming. How can Xue Ming\u2019s self-destructing beast core that has the power to destroy the continent, not destroy him?\u201dThe void beast explained, \u201cHe has the amulet given to you by the Demon King, that\u2019s the bracelet.\u201dHei Ze stumbled over and glared at Nan Xun, and gnashed his teeth and said, \u201cI knew he was in love with you, but I didn\u2019t know its depths. It was enough to brand your soul with the blood contract, but to self-destruct his beast core! In order to exterminate this deviant, the entire Divine Serpent clan went to the battlefield. Now, they are all buried with this evil animal and are all dead. Hahahahaha\u2026.\u201dHis tone suddenly was sharp, \u201cAll the people, beast gods and beasts are buried here with this evil animal, but you, the most damned lowly human are not dead!\u201dIdiom \u2013 untainted by even a speck of dust; selfless and incorruptible spotlessPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but sneer, \u201cDo you hate me? Lord Hei Ze, you\u2019re strange. If you weren\u2019t clever enough to provoke Xue Ming, everyone wouldn\u2019t have fallen to such a point. The culprit is you, the most damn is you!\u201dNan Xun stood up and approached him step by step. \u201cDon\u2019t you feel ashamed to hold my bracelet that Xue Ming given me to protect your life?\u201dHei Ze staggered back a few steps and sat on the bloody ground. He spread his right hand and stared at the blood bead bracelet in his palm which had shattered.Nan Xun walked up to him and placed her foot on his chest mercilessly which made him vomit blood again.The woman looked down at him and her voice was cold. \u201cI really want to stab and kill you. But you look like you will soon die. I don\u2019t want to dirty my hands.\u201dNan Xun finally glanced at him and left with the golden-winged Dapeng, leaving people in the pool of blood, half-dead.\u201cYour personality seemed to have changed and I\u2019m not used to it.\u201d The void beast suddenly said.Nan Xun\u2019s face was expressionless and faintly said, \u201cAfter more than a decade, it\u2019s inevitable to become ink black and become infected with Xue Ming\u2019s moodiness.\u201dVoid beast: \u2026It was still a little flustered. For a moment, it thought that the heartless Nan Xun it knew was fake. Also, it was with the fake Nan Xun that it usually quarreled with, it was as if there was another Nan Xun within her heart and this was the real her.It felt really flustered.\u201cLittle eight, what is the blood contract that Hei Ze mentioned?\u201d Nan Xun suddenly asked.The void beast suddenly returned from its thoughts and replied: \u201cIt should be a type of contract. Isn\u2019t it similar to the equal master-servant contract signed between a human and a beast? In any case, when someone dies, the contract will disappear. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dNan Xun, who left the battlefield, found a beautiful place, dug a pit with her own hands and buried Xue Ming\u2019s scales then set up a wordless monument.One person and one beast talked a lot along the way. At last, little eight found the familiar Nan Xun and its heart was no longer flustered.\u201cLittle eight, you think, was it really because of me that Xue Ming exploded his beast core?\u201d Nan Xun asked and looked at the wordless monument.The void beast hissed, \u201cAre you stupid? Was the Demon King so infatuated that he would die for love?\u201dNan Xun was silent for a while and said, \u201cIt looked like it. After Hei Ze threw my bloody clothes to him, his beast core self-destructed, if it wasn\u2019t because of me, then why?\u201dThe void beast scornfully replied, \u201cHe didn\u2019t explode his beast core because of you, but because Hei Ze and the Qing Long set up the ancient blood evil spirit array. This array was provided to them by your cheap Father himself, which is very powerful. Once activated, the Demon King\u2019s life will end, but you don\u2019t know his abnormal nature. If he was going to die, he will drag others as well, so he exploded his beast core.\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t because of me?\u201d Nan Xun hesitated.\u201cHow big is your face? You forgot, that later the Demon King\u2019s evil value changed back to 100. At that time, his entire thoughts were to destroy the world, so how in the devil could he think of you.\u201dNan Xun made a sound and stopped asking about it.\u201cIt\u2019s late, it\u2019s time for us to go.\u201d The void beast reminded her.Nan Xun was shocked, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cStupid, to the next world.\u201d\u201cWait, let me get dress.\u201dThe void beast sighed, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die to the next world, and you dress up to be presentable for a ghost!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. If you die, die beautifully.\u201dThe void beast \u201chehehe\u201d followed her and Nan Xun was in a bad mood.Nan Xun took a floral bath and rid the bloody air from her body, on her back was her black shiny hair which was soft and smooth.After facing the lake for a long time, Nan Xun asked little eight, \u201cHow are my clothes and bearings?\u201d\u201cBeautiful, perfect!\u201d The void beast within the bracelet secretly rolled its eyes.Nan Xun especially found some beautiful dream-like sea-flowers, she messily and prettily arranged them. When the white dress was scattered onto the ground and covered with red petals, she said to the void beast: \u201cOkay, little eight, let\u2019s go to the next world.\u201dIn the void beast\u2019s heart: This ancestor is completely ruined.The void beast began to work.Huh? What the fuck is going on!Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but wondered why she hadn\u2019t moved for half a day. She has kept this beautiful posture for so long, her hands and feet were going stiff.\u201cLittle eight, be faster.\u201d Nan Xun urged.The void beast was annoyed: \u201cI\u2019d like to hurry up too, but the problem is that your soul can\u2019t be extracted!\u201dNan Xun was confused, \u201cWhy is that?\u201dThe void beast sneered, \u201cYou have to ask yourself, did you especially taken something that you shouldn\u2019t have? I have long said that you can\u2019t carry anything in this world when you\u2019re leaving. Are Laozi\u2019s words wind that passes your ears?\u201dNan Xun thought about it and suddenly exclaimed, \u201cAh!\u201d She raised her hand and asked, \u201cIs it because of this storage ring on my finger?\u201dThe void beast roared: \u201cStill not hurrying to throw it away!\u201dNan Xun asked, \u201cCan\u2019t I wear it while dying? Anyway, my soul can\u2019t take it away.\u201dThe void beast gnashed its teeth, \u201cNo!\u201dNan Xun sighed sadly and took off the storage ring that Xue Ming gifted her.\u201cWhat happened? Why can\u2019t I extract your soul!\u201d The void beast was startled and was suspicious, \u201cDo you have anything else?\u201dNan Xun replied, \u201cThere\u2019s really nothing. What about clothes?\u201dThe void beast pondered, \u201cI don\u2019t know, otherwise\u2026try being naked?\u201dNan Xun: \u2026In the end, Nan Xun naturally didn\u2019t strip naked. Before discovering the reason, Nan Xun temporarily returned to the Zuili family.At this moment, the tragic situation on the battlefield has spread throughout the Yinchuan continent, and the entire continent was enveloped with grief.When Nan Xun returned to the Zuili family, she heard everyone\u2019s cries.In order to annihilate the Demon King, whom humanity and god beasts shared the same hatred. Some of the talented were on the battlefield. The Zuili family, as the head of the five major family set an example. All the young generation were on the battlefield to kill the enemy. Now, all these people and beasts were turned to ashes.Nan Xun returned to her own small courtyard and set up a ban on everyone except for her mother.Nan Xun spent the whole day in her own yard, studying with little eight why she couldn\u2019t leave this world.After a month, the void beast suddenly shouted, \u201cI finally know why!\u201dNan Xun, who was eating cranberries was shocked by it. \u201cWhy?\u201dThe void beast almost roared, \u201cYou, why do you still ask me, look down at your fat waistline!\u201dNan Xun was stunned, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just bigger by two sizes? Why are you angry?\u201dThe void beast cried: \u201cFat peat, you\u2019re pregnant! And it\u2019s been six months that you\u2019ve carried this world\u2019s child! You can\u2019t leave while with child!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You have to leave!\u201dNan Xun touched her stomach and whispered: \u201cI always think about my first baby who haunts me. The first time, I didn\u2019t want him. For the second time, I can\u2019t want him again. Little eight, don\u2019t you say that I\u2019m too casual and worried that I can\u2019t focus on my task? If I give birth to this child, I will have another goal in the future, that is, to finish all the tasks and come back and see him.\u201dSince it\u2019s possible for the void beast to bring her into this world once, she can come back again.This time, the void beast was silent for a long time and finally made a sound.Nan Xun estimated that if her family knew that she had the Demon King\u2019s flesh and blood in her belly, they would definitely break her leg and kill the child in her belly. So, Nan Xun left a letter and secretly left the Zuili family.The golden-winged Dapeng carried Nan Xun to the north. Under the guidance of little eight, Nan Xun found a mountain rich with spiritual energy.Nan Xun temporarily lived there, but the golden-winged Dapeng refused to leave and stayed with her and becomes her mountain guardian beast.Nan Xun looked at her obvious pregnant belly and asked little eight anxiously, \u201cI\u2019ve only been pregnant for seven months. This baby won\u2019t stay in my stomach for three or four years, right?\u201dThe void beast: \u201cWait for it. It will be born in 3 months.\u201dLess than 3 months later, the golden-winged Dapeng guarding the mountain suddenly said its farewell, saying it found its other half. The two giant Dapengs planned to travel into the sky, and after playing enough, they had a litter of babies.Nan Xun watched the golden-winged Dapeng go far away and was reluctant to part with it.\u201cIf you are lonely, you can call a group of spiritual beasts to accompany you. Now you are a beast-tamer.\u201d Little eight reminded.Nan Xun felt it was feasible and summoned a group of small partners.Birds and animals played in this mountain all day long. She doesn\u2019t know if it was due to the spiritual beasts\u2019 influence, but the aura of the mountain was getting richer and stronger.Nan Xun touched her stomach and looked at the increasingly pale and emaciated face in the bronze mirror. She said: \u201cIn the past, Xue Ming told me that my body with a beast\u2019s child would not be able to bear it. If it was serious, I may die. I thought he was bluffing me, but now it seems to be probably true.\u201dThe void beast hissed, \u201cOf course, it\u2019s true. The blood of a beast is powerful, not to mention the four clawed red-blooded snake. If you hadn\u2019t drank the Demon King\u2019s blood every day, your body wouldn\u2019t have improved. When you were three months pregnant, you would have been drained by the little thing in your belly.\u201dNan Xun shuddered, but still tenderly caressed her stomach. \u201cThis child is different. You can see that he never bothers me. Besides feeling weaker, he doesn\u2019t hurt me or give me a stomachache. He\u2019s very obedient.\u201dIt turns out that Nan Xun\u2019s baby is really very good. When she gave birth to her baby, she was in so much pain.It\u2019s just that Nan Xun looked at what she birthed\u2026it was an egg, the whole person was a little confused.Especially, she forgot that the father was a snake, or the four clawed red-blooded snake!She waited patiently to hold a plump and tender baby, but she didn\u2019t want to hold a round and shiny snake egg.The void beast gloated and said with a smile, \u201cLook at your reaction, I didn\u2019t have the heart to tell you that you were going to birth an egg this morning, hum~\u201dNan Xun ignored little eight. She touched the egg in her hand, rubbed the eggshell and carefully placed it in the basket and covered the egg with a small handkerchief.The next day, Nan Xun made ten egg blankets, each made with good quality fabric.Nan Xun placed the egg within the blanket, revealing only half the egg.Seeing that the egg\u2019s surface was too smooth and monotonous, Nan Xun was very playful. With a pen, she drew a pair of big cartoon eyes, a nose and a mouth on the egg exposed from the blanket, with a small tongue sticking out of the mouth, it was especially cute.The void beast: \u2026\u201cNow that the egg is laid, we should go.\u201d The void beast reminded her.Nan Xun replied, \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t broken through the shell yet.\u201dThe void beast sneered, \u201cDo you want to wait until it breaks from its shell? How clever is the Demon King\u2019s son? He guessed that you would leave without him breaking his shell. If he doesn\u2019t break his shell for hundreds of years, will you wait for hundreds of years?\u201dNan Xun was stunned, and her eyes were bright, \u201cLittle eight, do you mean that this egg has its own consciousness? What\u2019s more, how do you know that the egg is a boy?\u201dThe void beast pretended it was dead. It was tired and didn\u2019t want to talk.Since then, Nan Xun has started her life with the slippery egg. During the day, she hung the egg in the blanket around her waist and goes out for a walk when she has nothing to do. At night, she held the egg in her arms and told stories.Later, Nan Xun discovered that her family\u2019s egg was very clever. It likes to wear blankets made of snow silk and being washed with Lingquan water best. He doesn\u2019t like the faces that she painted on. When he has time, he will rub it off on the blanket.So, after a year, Nan Xun sighed and said, \u201cI believe you little eight, this egg is being intentional, I think. When I finish one last thing, we will leave.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d The void beast asked.Nan Xun said, \u201cI want to give some virtue for my family\u2019s egg because it is heavy from all the killings his father done. At present, the evil spirit in that battlefield has yet to disperse. If we go on like this, there will be resentment. I want to seal that battlefield.\u201dThe void beast yelled, \u201cWhat are you really so great? Do you know how big the battlefield is? How would you seal it!\u201dNan Xun smiled, \u201cthere is a secret method from the heritage of the Zuili, which can seal a space into a secret place.\u201dSo, Nan Xun went to the battlefield alone.After three days and three nights, Nan Xun finally succeeded in sealing the whole battlefield, and it was locked away in a jade slip.After thinking about it, Nan Xun broke the jade slip into two halves, leaving a small piece for herself and the remaining to the Zuili family.She was thinking, to not place it with the egg in the basket, in case the jade slip was obtained by people with ill-intentions and try to open the secret place, the consequences will be unimaginable.However, Nan Xun almost spat out blood after hearing little eight\u2019s words.For some reason, the half jade slip she handed over to her mother was divided in half and one piece was with the dragon beast clan while the other with the black Divine Serpent.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Hei Ze has been seriously injured and half-dead. He\u2019s useless and let alone the dragon beasts. Their old ancestor, the Qinglong is dead, the rest are not good, and they were cursed by the Demon King. One day they will perish.\u201d The void beast said.Nan Xun nodded and felt that she could die with ease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now we can depart at any time.\u201d Nan Xun said.The void beast replied, \u201cFuck, look at you now. Your soul is so weak, if I break the void now, your soul will shatter.\u201dNan Xun who just sealed the battlefield was as pale as a ghost and as thin as a tree trunk.Nan Xun was embarrassed and said, \u201cI thought this secret technique was very easy to use, but I overestimated my ability.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, the void beast said: \u201cWell, I will give you another twenty years to raise the primordial spirit. But you know, the reason why I\u2019m so tolerant towards you is because it was my mistake that you were pregnant with the Demon King\u2019s cub. There will be no such cheap thing in the future.\u201dNan Xun especially wanted to hold little eight and kissed its forehead. \u201cLittle eight, thank you. However, twenty years, even, nineteen years is enough.\u201dThe void beast: \u2026What the fuck, what\u2019s the difference?For the remaining 19 years, Nan Xun took the opportunity to chat with the egg while recuperating.\u201cLittle eight, I think I should give my egg a name.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cMay I give it my surname, Nan?\u201d\u201cNo, there is no Nan Xun in this world, only Zuili Xuan.\u201dNan Xun can only give up.One day, Nan Xun looked at a red maple leaf and suddenly clapped her hands, \u201cYes!\u201d Then she raised the egg blanket from her waist and asked with a smile, \u201cSon, you\u2019ll be called Zuili Feng, okay?\u201dThe void beast snorted, \u201cThe mother\u2019s chirping of insects1, is not pleasant to hear.\u201dNan Xun ignored its opinion.She was afraid that the egg didn\u2019t know the words, so Nan Xun engraved \u201cZuili Feng\u201d on the eggshell.On a different day, Nan Xun thought about it. She planned to go to the Demon King\u2019s grave to extract some red blood scales that she had previously buried. She brought it back to the PiaoMiao mountain and together with the incomplete jade slip, she sealed them in the spiritual source of the mountain.\u201cLittle eight, when you said we will go the next world, you would promise me one condition. Does it still count now?\u201d Nan Xun asked.The void beast snorted, \u201cCounts.\u201dNan Xun thought for a moment, \u201cI hope that the big boss in the next world would like me, this kind of strategy is easier.\u201dThe void beast: \u2026Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but laughed at its stupidity, \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke, don\u2019t take it so seriously.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve taken it seriously, I can satisfy this request.\u201d The void beast replied.This dumbfounded Nan Xun and her eyes changed, she was really moved and said, \u201cLittle eight, you really do love me.\u201dIn the last year prior to Nan Xun\u2019s departure, there were several Xuan people in the mountain. Anyway, she wanted to leave, so she took in several people. The several Xuan people didn\u2019t want to leave, instead they asked if Nan Xun would establish a sect here and that she would be respected as the master.Nan Xun nodded and waved. \u201cYes, it\u2019s called PiaoMiao sect.\u201dAfter her son Zuili Feng was placed in the forbidden cave, Nan Xun planned to die. On the day of her death, there were already 100 disciplines of the PiaoMiao sect. All the disciplines bowed down and saluted.Nan Xun stood on the top of the mountain with her hands behind her back and looked like a high-profile expert.Overlooking the great river and mountains at her feet, Nan Xun authentically said with satisfaction. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to establish a sect before I died. I have a premonition that later on, this ancestor\u2019s PiaoMiao sect will surely become a huge pillbox sect.\u201dThe void beast: \u201cStop talking nonsense, let\u2019s leave this fucking world soon.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s soul was separated from the host\u2019s body and was taken away from this world by the void beast.Before fainting, Nan Xun heard the faint voice of little eight. \u201cIt seems as if there\u2019s something following after Laozi2!\u201d\u2026\u2026When Nan Xun woke up, she was lying on a stiff bed and was very uncomfortable from head to toe. Then she opened her eyes and looked guarded and saw that there was nothing else in this small, damaged room. There was only a small bed and table, on the small table it was almost filled with a thick stack of books.The small modern broken furniture made Nan Xun feel warm. However, after seeing her small arms and calves, Nan Xun\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cLittle eight, did you especially found me such a pink, delicate body to let me get close to the villain whose evil value is 100?\u201dWith this, the void beast rolled its eyes. \u201cWhere is it pink and delicate? Aren\u2019t you only thirteen years old?\u201dWith that, the void beast\u2019s tone turned serious again, \u201cSomething unexpected happened on the way to this world.\u201dNan Xun was a little nervous because of its serious tome, \u201cWhat was the accident?\u201d\u201cI think there was something following me, but that\u2019s impossible. Breaking the void requires powerful force. Except for other void beasts that are naturally born as masters of space and time, ordinary people can\u2019t easily break the void.\u201dNan Xun listened to its tone of voice and was aware of its uncertainties, and comforted, \u201cMaybe you think too much.\u201dThe void beast didn\u2019t know what to think. Suddenly, it coughed guiltily, \u201cFirst, I couldn\u2019t control the time when we traveled to this world. At this time, the big boss\u2019 evil value is not ready, it won\u2019t be until ten years later.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cBaby, so, what do you want to say?\u201d\u201cThe spiritual essence in this world is too thin. I can\u2019t take you forward ten years for the time being, so wait for me, wait for me to rest, then later I will take you forward ten years.\u201dNan Xun regretted it, if she had known, she would have stayed in the previous world for a few more years.In the last world, she had a son egg, but this world had a pile of broken things and endless homework.This body is called Bai Mo. Her father is a drunkard and gambler. Later, he directly took the family\u2019s money and left. Her mother and her led a hard life, eating pickled vegetables and radishes every day. Even now, Bai Mo\u2019s malnourished body was yellow and emaciated. On the contrary, she was marked to blossom much later.Then, Bai Mo\u2019s maternal uncle was suddenly moved to marry her off to a blind 40-year-old uncle in town. Her mother desperately protected her, and her uncle\u2019s thoughts were temporarily dispelled.For three years in junior high school, Bai Mo had strong self-esteem and did not get along well with her classmates. In order to not return to her hometown to get married, she studied hard day and night and finally was admitted into the city\u2019s best high school.It\u2019s just that her high school life wasn\u2019t good. In her second year of high school, her mother was diagnosed with stomach cancer. She worked as a child laborer, went to school and ran to the hospital every day. Her life exhausted her. In her third year of high school, her mother passed away and she missed the college entrance examination.Bai Mo resigned to fate, she was married by her maternal uncle to the blind and ugly uncle. She was raped and abused all day long and was finally overwhelmed. At the age of 30, she killed herself by overdosing on medicine.Nan Xun: \u201cSigh\u2026\u201dThe void beast, \u201cSigh, I have already suppressed Bai Mo\u2019s soul and expropriated her body and now you\u2019re in her thirteen-year-old body.\u201dNow that Bai Mo has just been admitted to the key middle school in the city, she will leave town tomorrow to experience junior high school life in the city.After thinking about studying with a group of younger brothers and sister, Nan Xun felt her head was big3.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Mom is willing to sacrifice everything she has to provide for you.\u201dNan Xun nodded, a person with red eyes set foot on the road towards the city.Other family\u2019s children were escorted by their parents. She is the only one who carried her old luggage. She went to registered herself for the school\u2019s formalities.\u201cI feel that you\u2019re in a bad mood.\u201d The void beast suddenly said.Nan Xun smiled, \u201cNothing, I was just thinking of my mother. Actually, her life is my sole concern.\u201dHer mother spent a lot of effort on her, but her mother never forced her to learn. She doesn\u2019t have to learn elegant things like the piano or violin, but she liked it, so she earned the 10th level. She liked taekwondo and mixed martial arts. Her mother didn\u2019t object and encouraged her to do anything she wanted.She was also her teacher and friend. Her mother\u2019s tolerance caused her to develop her optimistic and casual character, but perhaps because of her slag father, she was extremely indifferent.\u201cLittle eight, recover quickly. Although I used to be a bookworm, I really don\u2019t want to study again.\u201dThe void beast: \u201cShort oil, don\u2019t you know that the last Wuxia world was much higher? It\u2019s very laborious to shuttle you back and forth by spending spiritual energy, okay? Try to experience the student life again. It\u2019s something that many people won\u2019t be able to experience. You be content with one\u2019s situation, humph~\u201dUnder the void beast\u2019s persuasion, Nan Xun let herself go. Anyway, there will be no one in the school who knows Bai Mo, she wasn\u2019t worried about falling into ruins from people\u2019s arrangement.Bai Mo\u2019s face1 was good as she had good grades, was cheerful, enthusiastic and helpful, soon she attracted a large group of younger brothers and sisters. She had a very good life.In order to lighten the burden on Bai Mo\u2019s mother, Nan Xun didn\u2019t know what self-respect was. She applied for the school\u2019s difficult subsidy and the application was miserable. Several of her teachers saw her red eyes, then paid special attention to her. Once any subsidy was applied for, the first thing they thought of was her.During the senior high school entrance exam, Nan Xun lived up to expectations and took first place in the city. She was admitted to the city\u2019s key high school and won the honor of alma mater and successfully smoothly obtained a large amount of grants. The town\u2019s mayor also provided financial assistance, she harvested enough bits to completely cover her high school\u2019s tuition fees.Her cheap mom happily wiped her tears and her black-hearted uncle who has been expecting her to drop out of school and get married also temporarily stopped his thoughts.However, Nan Xun was waiting for Bai Mo\u2019s destined catastrophe. Bai Mo\u2019s mother fainted and was diagnosed with advanced stomach cancer.Every day, Nan Xun runs to both ends, her little face becomes weary and thin.However, the day before the college entrance examination, her mother passed away, and the next day she failed to take the college entrance examination.Nan Xun collapsed on the ground and cried to little eight, \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been hollowed out.\u201dThe void beast felt a little guilty, \u201cWait a minute, my spiritual power will be full soon. It will only take one month at most.\u201dNan Xun buried Bai Mo\u2019s mother, then sold the house and left town alone.Nan Xun who only has a high school diploma is thinking about how to earn money to support herself. Her family\u2019s eighth child suddenly happily said, \u201cI\u2019m recovered. Now, I\u2019ll take you forward by 4 years!\u201dBefore Nan Xun could express her opinion, she felt darkness in front of her.Four years later, Nan Xun shared a two-bedroom, single home with others. The room she lived in was not big but clean. There were several pots of hanging orchids on the balcony and a bamboo rocking chair. It looked very comfortable and she indeed liked the style.\u201cLittle eight, what am I doing now?\u201d Nan Xun asked.\u201cYou work at the bar as a singer.\u201d The void beast replied feebly.Nan Xun was surprised. \u201cHow can I be reduced to singing? So miserable! But little eight, what\u2019s wrong with you? You don\u2019t sound very energetic.\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cThis low-level world\u2019s spiritual energy is too thin. I\u2019ve used up all the energy I\u2019ve gathered. I\u2019m afraid I have to sleep for a while.\u201dNan Xun hurriedly asked, \u201cNo, little eight, how can I find the big bad boss with evil value of 100 when you\u2019re not here?\u201dThe void beast\u2019s voice gets smaller and smaller, \u201cYour first request you mentioned earlier is that this world\u2019s villain likes you. He will definitely take the initiative to find your door. Be obedient, shoot I want to go to sleep~\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cLittle eight? Little eight! Little eight\u2026\u2026\u201d Nan Xun affectionately called many times and the void beast didn\u2019t utter a single word.She didn\u2019t adapt to little eight\u2019s absence for a while, but she was lying on the rocking chair with the sunshine outside the window warming her body. She listened to the soothing light music from her mobile phone and such a pleasant afternoon nap made Nan Xun soon forget all her troubles.The light music from the mobile phone was interrupted by a ring tone. Nan Xun picked up the mobile phone bewildered and heard a nasal sound.There was faint laughter on the other end of the cell phone, but Nan Xun didn\u2019t hear it.Nan Xun was awake for the most part and looked at the strange phone number displayed on her cellphone. Her intuition said it was advertising. She was still languid and askew, she yawned and asked, \u201cHello, who is it?\u201dThe other end of the cellphone was quiet for a while. Later, a man\u2019s voice answered, \u201cHello, is this Bai Mo?\u201dThe voice was low and deep mixed with strands of softness, which gave a very comfortable feeling. However, this sound seemed to bring a chill and Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but wrap a blanket around her body.Nan Xun quickly confirmed and asked, \u201cYes, I am. Who are you? What can I do for you?\u201d\u201cThis is Fu Yu. Do you remember me?\u201d The man asked without any hesitation. Just listening to his voice, easily made people feel good.Nan Xun felt that the name, Fu Yu was very familiar to her, as if he were her high school classmate.Nan Xun hasn\u2019t been wearing the host for four years. Her high school life had just occurred. Otherwise, she really wouldn\u2019t have remembered this person called Fu Yu.Nan Xun was a little confused. She doesn\u2019t know how the other side had her phone number. Moreover, in the three years in high school, the words she and Fu Yu exchanged can only be added up to no more than ten sentences.As the other end on the phone was still waiting for her reply, Nan Xun didn\u2019t think much about it. She smiled and said, \u201cOf course, Fu Yu, you\u2019re the smallest, but always sat in the last row. Besides, you didn\u2019t like talking, but your grades were particularly good.\u201dOn the other end of the phone, came the man\u2019s low laugh, as if his mood seemed to be very pleasant because of her response.\u201cBai Mo, where are you now?\u201d Fu Yu asked.His breathing seemed very light, as if he doesn\u2019t breathe at the end of his sentences.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After graduating high school, there was no news from anyone, I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing. By the way, Fu Yu, how are you, what are you doing now?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s impression of Fu Yu isn\u2019t deep. He didn\u2019t seem to enjoy talking and always sat alone in the corner of the classroom, never listened to lectures during class and doesn\u2019t hang out with anyone during his spare time. His whole body eluded a thick gloomy atmosphere.Even so, his academic performance was very good.After finishing high school, there was little eight hanging around. Nan Xun jumped four years forward in time. She didn\u2019t know Fu Yu\u2019s current situation. But before she left, she heard that Fu Yu had been admitted to the best university in the city. He could have gone to one of the top universities in the country, but he chose to stay in the city.For a moment, the phone was quiet, and the man\u2019s voice sounded softly, \u201cI founded my own company after graduation, it\u2019s called Si Mo1 Corporation.\u201dSince the other side paused for a while, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. The other side was waiting for her reaction, so she quickly exclaimed, \u201cWow, is that right, Fu Yu, you\u2019re really amazing!\u201dThe man on the other end didn\u2019t speak and the atmosphere was a bit awkward for a moment.Nan Xun laughs to break this stagnant atmosphere and jokingly said, \u201cWhen your short on staff, I\u2019ll come work for you. I\u2019m letting you know in advance that I can\u2019t do any high-tech work, but there\u2019s absolutely no problem serving you tea and pouring water.\u201dAt the other end of the line, there was a man\u2019s voice which was mixed with a faint smile. There was also a kind of nostalgia layered in as well. \u201cBai Mo, you\u2019re still the same as before.\u201dNan Xun didn\u2019t quite understand the meaning of his sentence.However, the other party obviously didn\u2019t continue the topic. He stated the purpose of his call, \u201cThere will be a high school reunion the day after tomorrow and everyone will attend. Will you come?\u201dNan Xun has no interest. Her purpose is to wait for the big boss to knock on her door and to eliminate his evil thoughts to proceed to the next world.\u201cFu Yu, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m very busy recently, so I won\u2019t go. Besides, you should know, I didn\u2019t even go to college, it will be humiliating if I went.\u201dFu Yu on the other end of the phone was silent for a while, then suddenly said, \u201cAre you really not coming? Everyone misses you very much\u2026\u201dNan Xun heard the sense of desolation from his words. She thought it wouldn\u2019t be so bad, so she changed her mind. \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201dShe said with a sly smile, \u201cSince it\u2019s you, the big boss who invited me personally, I will certainly give you face, but you need to protect me and not let others bully me.\u201dFu Yu laughed, \u201cOkay.\u201dNan Xun asked, \u201cWhere is the gathering? Is it far?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not far, it\u2019s in this city.\u201d The man on the other end of the cellphone whispered, \u201cI\u2019ll send you the address later.\u201d His voice was low as if weighted, \u201cBai Mo, I\u2019ll wait for you to come\u2026\u201dNan Xun felt strange after hearing this, but she couldn\u2019t tell what was strange. The other party made a special phone call to her and his attitude was also sincere. Naturally, she patted her chest and promised again, confirming that she would definitely go that day.The man on the other side hung up.Ding, the other party sent the address to the class reunion.Nan Xun looked at the address, it\u2019s not far away. It\u2019s in this city\u2019s suburb and it\u2019s a very famous rural tourist location.Nan Xun thought it was interesting that the class representative didn\u2019t choose a high-end hotel but settled for a natural atmosphere.However, Nan Xun had been wondering, how did Fu Yu know her phone number?In high school, except for the rich, the average person still couldn\u2019t use cellphones, and even if she could afford a cellphone, the school didn\u2019t permit them to carry it, so she didn\u2019t leave any of her contact information at that time.She couldn\u2019t figure it out and Nan Xun didn\u2019t want to. Maybe because the other person was a big boss that he could find out at any time.After resting on the lounge chair for a while, Nan Xun began to rummage through the boxes and cabinets, trying to find a more dignified dress. There was no way, who called her poor? The clothes to participate in this occasion can\u2019t be too shabby.Her roommate Lin Jingwan appeared to hear her overturning trunks and boxes. She couldn\u2019t help but yawn and ask, \u201cMo Mo, what are you doing not resting in the afternoon?\u201dNan Xun didn\u2019t lift her head and continued to rummage through the boxes. \u201cThere\u2019s a high school reunion the day after tomorrow. I don\u2019t have any suitable clothes.\u201dLin Jingwan thought it was an important event and immediately said, \u201cDon\u2019t look, older sister here has plenty of clothes, I happen to have clothes that especially fits you.\u201dNan Xun was a little embarrassed and said with a smile, \u201cThank you Lin Jingwan. I\u2019ll treat you with a tableful of food when I return.\u201dLin Jingwan is a broad-minded person, who was very compatible with Nan Xun and had a strong sense of justice. But the one thing that Nan Xun couldn\u2019t stand about Lin Jingwan was her private life that was too chaotic from being a hedonist, not only material, but also carnal pleasure.After her first encounter with this girl and a wild man on the sofa, Nan Xun\u2019s eyes were blinded spicy and strongly expressed her opposition. The girl sneered that she didn\u2019t understand the local customs. But since then, she rarely brought home strange men.Nan Xun didn\u2019t want to find a new home to live in and she was a lazy person. Once she settled down, she was too lazy to move, so she stayed.On the weekend, Nan Xun took personal time off and directly went to the address of the gathering.Just after getting off the bus, Nan Xun saw many people gathered in front of her. At first glance, there were at least 30 people.\u201cOh, look who arrived, it\u2019s the great beauty, Bai Mo!\u201dA woman with heavy makeup stepped forward towards Nan Xun with a lira in her arms. She said very enthusiastically, \u201cBoss Bai, do you remember me, I\u2019m Jiang Wen Wen.\u201dNan Xun chuckled. When she went to school, she did have a little girl who was her fan. Unexpectedly, the little girl who used to be fat became a big beauty.The years really carved people.Student life seems to be the purest time during a person\u2019s life, especially during high school in senior year, when they were ignorant of everything. Although they hadn\u2019t seen each other for several years, they soon chatted to catch up with each other.Everyone was distributed with work. The women boiled water and washed vegetables. The men caught chickens and fished. Nan Xun was a small portion of the people who were left out.She and Jiang Wen Wen wandered out onto the country road to chat about their recent situation.Nan Xun inadvertently glanced somewhere and didn\u2019t know what she saw. Her eyes widened sharply, and she quickly ran forward.With a plop, she jumped into the pond.Nan Xun saw a little boy who fell into the water and was struggling desperately.Nan Xun hurriedly swam toward the little boy. But just as she was about to reach him, suddenly she felt something underwater caught her leg and dragged her down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He nodded slightly and thoughtfully replied, \u201cHow are you feeling now? I\u2019m Bai Xiye, Bai Juyuan\u2019s older brother. You fell into the water just now and scared everyone.\u201dNan Xun hurriedly looked at the distant pond. \u201cWhat about the little boy who fell into the water?\u201dJiang Wen Wen\u2019s expression was a bit strange, \u201cBoss Bai, what are you talking about? There wasn\u2019t a little boy in the pond. I just saw that you were shocked and rushed towards the pond quickly, then jumped down with a plop.\u201dNan Xun replied, \u201cBut I really saw a little boy fall into the water, then I jumped in to save him.\u201dThe surrounding people were quiet for a moment then stood up roaring with laughter.Bai Xiye felt her forehead directly with the back of his hand and asked, \u201cAre you suffering from heatstroke and it\u2019s the reason why you are dazzled?\u201dNan Xun was sent to the farmhouse to rest. Everyone said that she was blind, and she thought to herself. Maybe it was her\u2026what\u2019s the point?Nan Xun thought for a while and had some lingering fears, but little eight was still asleep. If something happened to her during this time, it would be over for her.After sitting for a while, Nan Xun went to the kitchen to help.She suddenly remembered something, then Nan Xun quickly asked Jiang Wen Wen next to her, \u201cI\u2019ve been here for a while, but Fu Yu hasn\u2019t come yet?\u201dJiang Wen Wen first thought about it, then was surprised, \u201cYou mean that freak?\u201dAs soon as she finished, she covered her mouth and smiled. \u201cI\u2019m wrong. I shouldn\u2019t have said that. But I haven\u2019t heard news about that invisible person in recent years. I don\u2019t know his current situation, but even if the class representative pulled down his face and called him, he wouldn\u2019t have come.\u201dNan Xun frowned slightly. She asked several other people but found that none of them knew that Fu Yu would come. Even the class representative was surprised, stating that he didn\u2019t contact Fu Yu at all. Not only that, but that Nan Xun would come today also.\u201cI thought it was the other students who informed you. After all, I haven\u2019t heard news about you for a long time. As for Fu Yu\u2014\u201dThe class representative paused, then there was a trace of envy that flashed in his eyes. \u201cYou may not believe it, but Fu Yu, who was a bit of a jerk is now the big boss of the Si Mo Corporation. I heard that he started his business in his sophomore year. After graduation, he ran the company.\u201dThe people present in the room couldn\u2019t help but click their tongues, they thought it was quite inconceivable.Their impression of Fu Yu was that he was a freak. He never talked to anyone and sat alone in the corner and seemed to have separated himself from the whole world.In fact, many people secretly suspected that Fu Yu may have severe autism. It\u2019s said that this kind of person was the most terrible and must not be provoked.\u201cClass representative, Fu Yu is so good now. Why didn\u2019t you ask him to come to the get together?\u201d Jiang Wen Wen quickly asked.The class representative ridiculed, \u201cWhen I was in high school, I didn\u2019t even have a bird. So, if I suddenly called people, isn\u2019t it too good?\u201d1The person next to him couldn\u2019t help but make fun of him. \u201cLook at your advice now, where was the terrified class representative from that year.\u201dEveryone laughed and made noise. Nan Xun pulled the corners of her mouth but couldn\u2019t laugh.Last time on the phone, she got the definite message that Fu Yu would attend the class reunion, but after so long, he was still missing.Nan Xun didn\u2019t expect that the people didn\u2019t wait for Fu Yu but waited for Qin Jia.She came with a BMW, dressed in a long black dress, with light but delicate makeup on her face.Nan Xun was grateful to Qin Jia.When she was in high school, Nan Xun had a difficult life, so she went to work nearby to do some odd jobs in her spare time. But because she wasn\u2019t old enough, people didn\u2019t dare to accept her. Later, the little girl in front of her helped her get a job at a coffee shop and to serve dishes in a western restaurant.Even with the plate, she was much taller.It\u2019s said that Qin Jia\u2019s family has a good relationship with Fu Yu\u2019s family, they often pay each other a visit.Qin Jia took off her sunglasses and swept her eyes all around until it finally fell on Nan Xun\u2019s body and her face was astonished.\u201cBai Mo, you actually came?\u201d Qin Jia stared at her for a long time.Nan Xun was somewhat upset and explained: \u201cI received a call from Fu Yu. He gave me the address, so I came.\u201dBut Qin Jia didn\u2019t want to hear this, her eyes widened, and her face flashed with a frightened expression.But she didn\u2019t say anything at that moment since everyone else was around.Including Qin Jia, apart from Fu Yu, almost all the high school classmates have arrived.The owner of the farmhouse had a table full of dishes, and everyone began to eat, drink, talk and laugh.Qin Jia didn\u2019t speak until the end of the meal. She suddenly called Nan Xun aside to chat.\u201cBai Mo, we\u2019ve been looking for you for a long time.\u201dShe\u2019s talking about them.Before Qin Jia arrived, Nan Xun also knew about everyone\u2019s current situations.It\u2019s said that Qin Jia and Fu Yu attended the same university in the city, but Fu Yu obtained first place in the province, and Qin Jia was admitted in by her family\u2019s money.\u201cWhen you left, you really didn\u2019t leave any news for us. There was a huge crowd, where could we find you\u2026\u201d Qin Jia lightly said.She didn\u2019t know if she was delusional, but she felt that Qin Jia had a strange attitude towards her as if she held some resentment.But they hadn\u2019t met each other in several years, where did all this resentment came from?Suddenly, Qin Jia coldly stared at her, \u201cBai Mo, don\u2019t you know?\u201d She asked, then suddenly threw the deep-water bomb, \u201cFu Yu is dead.\u201d\u201cJust three days ago, he died in a car accident.\u201d She added coldly.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes widened, thinking that she might have heard a joke.The day before yesterday, Fu Yu called and talked to her for so long.Is it possible that\u2026it was a prank?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His parents wanted me to marry him as their daughter-in-law. At first, I didn\u2019t like him and thought he was a sick person, but after four years of contact in college, I gradually fell in love with him. I thought this proposal was very good, but it\u2019s a pity\u2026he already had someone he liked.\u201dSpeaking of this, her look towards Nan Xun was complicated.Nan Xun heard her upset tone and managed to reply, \u201cQin Jia, you\u2019re grieving.\u201dQin Jia sighed. \u201cYou say, he was so young, just when his career was successful, how can he just die?\u201dNan Xun also lamented for a while, he was indeed so young.\u201cLittle eight, why are all the world\u2019s prodigies killed in a car accident? Look at me, I accidentally had a car accident before that ended my lifetime as well. Ah\u2026I\u2019m in the same boat with this Fu Yu.\u201dLittle eight was asleep, otherwise if it heard this, it would have cursed at her, \u201cCome on, what kind of genius are you?\u201d\u201cBai Mo, how on earth did you get the news? You\u2019ve disappeared for so many years and the city so big. It\u2019s not easy to find you. Have you been in touch with other students in recent years?\u201d Qin Jia suddenly asked.Nan Xun was shocked and truthfully answered, \u201cIt\u2019s true that someone called me. He claimed to be Fu Yu, but since Fu Yu passed away, it must have been a prank.\u201dQin Jia slightly frowned, \u201cPrank? Even if someone wants to play a prank, they would need to know your contact information first. Fu and I\u2026I haven\u2019t heard from you all these years. Is it so easy to prank someone you don\u2019t know?\u201dNan Xun was silent and replied, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not Fu Yu and I made a mistake.\u201dQin Jia stared at her for a long time and didn\u2019t continue the topic.She picked up her cellphone, and opened her phone\u2019s contact list, then deleted Fu Yu\u2019s number and said sadly, \u201cThe phone number will no longer work in the future\u2026\u201dNan Xun looked at the string of numbers and suddenly felt it was familiar. She took out her phone and discovered from her call history it was the same number from a few days ago.With this knowledge, Nan Xun was scared and felt her back went cold, the phone number of the person who called was exactly the same as the one Qin Jia deleted!How could it be Fu Yu\u2019s mobile phone number?!\u201cBai Mo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Qin Jia asked when she saw that her expression wasn\u2019t right.Nan Xun shook her head and said it was nothing.Maybe the prankster used Fu Yu\u2019s mobile phone to call her\u2026right?Nan Xun felt that she shouldn\u2019t think too deeply about it and immediately stopped.At the end of the reunion, everyone left.Nan Xun was left alone at last, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh. When she arrived, she came by taxi. Now, where can she take a taxi in the middle of this wilderness!Finally, Nan Xun asked the owner of the farmhouse to borrow a bike to ride back.It was more than ten kilometers away. Come on, she\u2019s going to have to ride in the dark.Nan Xun pushed the bike out quickly, only to bump into a little boy.The little boy wore a small white T-shirt, denim shorts and had a pair of big black clear eyes, thin lips which were slightly pursed and looked like a delicate doll.He held a bouquet of wild chrysanthemums in his hands and looked up at Nan Xun quietly.Nan Xun saw that he was the youngest son of the owner\u2019s wife. But when she saw the little guy, he was still catching crickets with a group of wild boys. He was very lively and wasn\u2019t as quiet as he was now.The child\u2019s little delicate face was expressionless, and his big eyes held no emotions, there was a dead silence within them.Nan Xun smiled awkwardly and asked, \u201cLittle brother, were you just hurt by sister? Sister, will apologize to you?\u201dThe little boy didn\u2019t speak.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but squat down to be eye level to him, she smiled and said, \u201cSister can do a magic trick for you. Look, change, change chocolate!\u201dNan Xun handed a chocolate to the little boy\u2019s chubby small paw.He looked down at the chocolate in his hand, then looked up at her again, and those pair of clear black and white eyes unexpectedly made Nan Xun feel somewhat profound.Nan Xun made sure that he didn\u2019t get hurt, then reached out to rub his furry head, then pushed the bike away.After several steps, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but look back.He still looked at her so quietly, but his little red mouth slightly raised into an arc.Nan Xun also hooked her lips, but she didn\u2019t forget to talk to little eight in her heart, \u201cI knew that it would be difficult to take care of the little baby.\u201dNaturally, the sleeping little eight was unresponsive.The little boy walked slowly and steadily towards her, step by step, not like an ordinary childHe handed the wild chrysanthemum to Nan Xun.Nan Xun said, \u201cIs this flower for sister? Thank you.\u201dThe little boy didn\u2019t say anything, but only looked at her quietly.Nan Xun looked at the delicate little face, smiled slightly, and squatted down to kiss the little face.The little boy turned his head slightly, and her kiss landed on his red little mouth.That cool sensation passed from their lips to the center of her heart, Nan Xun unconsciously shivered.Nan Xun touched the head of the small radish. \u201cHow could your body be so cold on a hot day? Don\u2019t play too much, remember to go home early. If you have a cold, your mom and dad will worry about you.\u201dNan Xun placed the flowers gifted by the little radish into the bike\u2019s basket, then left on the bike twistedly, this mountain road really wasn\u2019t good.Halfway through the ride, the sky darkened.Nan Xun looked around and suddenly saw several graves in the field. At this time, a gust of wind blew by.Nan Xun shivered and felt a little panicked.She didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion. Nan Xun was riding the bicycle but felt heavier and heavier. It was like there was suddenly something on the backseat of the bike\u2026the weight of another person.Nan Xun was frightened by her sudden metaphor. She quickly increased her strength and pedaled faster.The night wind seemed to be a bit strong and cold, there was always a cold air surrounding her. Fortunately, it\u2019s summer now, so it was quite comfortable.\u201cHey-\u201c\u201cHey-\u201cNan Xun suddenly heard someone crying in the distance from behind, as if calling her.Nan Xun subconsciously wanted to turn around, but she jerked her head back.You can\u2019t look back, you can\u2019t look back.Cold sweat gathered on her forehead while she pedaled for a long time in a panicked state, she listened to the crickets and frogs the entire way back and finally returned to the city.Nan Xun took a shower and laid in the large-sized bed.Suddenly she thought of something. Nan Xun went down the stairs again and took out the wild chrysanthemums from the bicycle basket.It was an adorable little baby that gifted it to her, it\u2019s not good to throw it away.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She could have good dreams just by smelling the flower\u2019s fragrance in the evenings.Nan Xun slept well that night.The next day, Nan Xun woke up and went to the bar as usual.The bar is in the center of the city, it\u2019s a little far from the house she rents. It takes more than an hour by bus.Truthfully, Nan Xun thought the job is very good. She just stayed in this world for a while and didn\u2019t need to do anything. Her salary was enough. Now she sings seven or eight times a day in this bar, if the response is good, she could earn 200 to 300 yuan a day. It\u2019s really good for a person who only has a high school diploma.After singing for a few days, Nan Xun still sang with gusto. She had some talent in music and Bai Mo\u2019s voice was very good, she was very happy to eat this bowl of rice.But these days, there is a rich boy in the bar who comes to cheer her on every day, this rich boy\u2019s name is Zhao Qilin. His name sounds powerful, but he looks a little\u2026well, it\u2019s hard to say.It\u2019s said that his father is a coal mine owner and that he\u2019s a nouveau riche.Nan Xun repeatedly chewed little eight\u2019s previous sentence again and again, before it went to sleep. She wondered if Zhao Qilin, the rich and young man, is the big boss that she is looking for and was the one that took the initiative to come to her door.But when she thought of Zhao Qilin\u2019s paunchy stupidity. Nan Xun immediately denied this idea. Little eight is like her, a face freak. How could it select a boss that is so fat?Rich boy Zhao Qilin was honest for a few days and couldn\u2019t help it. On this day, he directly stopped her to express his thoughts of having a one-night stand with her.Nan Xun\u2019s face darkened and expressed her refusal politely.Zhao Qilin broke the wine glass on the table and his words were full of profanity. \u201cIt\u2019s just singing XX. It\u2019s your blessing that laozi looked at you. Fucking don\u2019t be shameless! Don\u2019t you want money? Laozi will give you 200,000 yuan tonight and buy you for one night. If you make laozi comfortable, laozi will add another 200,000 yuan\u2026\u201dNan Xun listened in anger, then directly picked up the bottle and slammed it on his head.There was a crash and the whole bar was quiet.Nan Xun scooped her ear and sneered, \u201cIt can be quiet at last.\u201dLater, the bar owner sent Zhao Qilin out and saw that Nan Xun\u2019s face was very black.Fortunately, Nan Xun was popular everywhere and other people in the bar helped her talk. The boss didn\u2019t directly dismiss her and only deducted one month\u2019s salary.Since the boss didn\u2019t let Nan Xun go, Nan Xun had the cheek to stay.Not long after, Nan Xun heard that the rich second generation, Zhao Qilin, died in a car accident.It\u2019s said that Zhao Qilin\u2019s death is a bit strange.He really died by himself, but when the car was about to pass, it was as if he was pushed out by something. The reason for that speculation was because there was no one besides him during that time. Even the surveillance tape showed that he flung forward abruptly and actually collided with the car and died on the spot.After listening to this, Nan Xun didn\u2019t care too much. Some rumors spread ten times, others a hundred times, and finally nothing remains the same.It should be an ordinary car accident, Nan Xun thought.The bar business is good during the evenings and there were many guests. Nan Xun sang two more songs before going back.When Nan Xun returned to the house, she saw a table of food. Her eyes were shining, and her saliva was about to flow out. \u201cI say, it\u2019s quiet. What\u2019s the occasion today? How are you so virtuous today?\u201dLin Jingwan\u2019s voice came from the kitchen: \u201cI\u2019m in a good mood today, so please have a big meal.\u201dNan Xun was starving, she went into the kitchen happily and got a pair of chopsticks. When Lin Jingwan\u2019s last dish landed, she couldn\u2019t wait to put a piece of braised chicken in her mouth. \u201cOh, the workmanship is truly good, afterwards when you marry it\u2019s indeed the blessing of three lifetimes.\u201dLin Jingwan disdainfully said, \u201cYou\u2019re too good to bribe, it\u2019s just a table of food.\u201dNan Xun laughed and replied, \u201cI\u2019ll find a man who can cook and contract him to make three meals a day.\u201dAs Nan Xun said this, suddenly she felt a gust of wind across her neck and itched, she couldn\u2019t help but shrink her neck.After dinner, Nan Xun was consciously given the task of dishwashing. Although she hated washing greasy things the most, she was embarrassed from eating rice.\u201cMo Mo, I remember you placed this chrysanthemum for a long time. How come it\u2019s still so gorgeous?\u201d Lin Jingwan went to Nan Xun\u2019s room to borrow a charger and looked at the vase of white chrysanthemum that was on the bedside table.Nan Xun also thinks it\u2019s amazing, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess the vitality of that flower is more resilient?\u201dLin Jingwan replied, \u201cMo Mo, I swear this flower is a bit sinister, why don\u2019t we throw it away?\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do!\u201d Nan Xun held the flower and the vase within her arms. \u201cThis was gifted from an adorable radish head to me. I promised him that I will raise it well. Anyway, it\u2019s kept in my room and you won\u2019t see it again.\u201dLin Jingwan immediately rolled her eyes and said, \u201cLook at you, being fiercely protective of your baby, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re even aware of what you\u2019re holding.\u201dDing.Nan Xun\u2019s mobile phone suddenly rang and the screen lit up.Lin Jingwan glanced at it and saw the short text message with her eyes and its contents.\u201cMo Mo! You, you, you actually have a boyfriend. You didn\u2019t tell me, you\u2019re too much! You see, the proof is right here, this handsome guy named Bai Xiye is asking you to see a movie!\u201d Lin Jingwan picked up her cellphone and shook it at her, with an expression of \u201ccatching a couple in the act.\u201dNan Xun recovered her mobile phone and explained: \u201cLast time I attended the class reunion. I accidentally fell into the water and he saved me. He was my senior high school classmate\u2019s older brother. That day, he also went to the reunion.\u201dLin Jingwan clicked her tongue twice, \u201cBai Mo, classmate is a coverup, needless to say, you go on this date, I won\u2019t say anything.\u201dNan Xun really wants to meet him. First, Bai Xiye is kind to her. Second, she has some doubts that Bai Xiye is the villain boss that she has been waiting for.Little eight said that the big villain boss has long liked her and that she also gathered information from Bai Xiye. The class reunion from before was not the first time they met.The first time they met, it involved a very bloody thing. While Nan Xun was shopping, a thief stole her wallet, then a handsome guy appeared from thin air and recovered it.And this person was Bai Xiye.It seems that Bai Xiye fell in love with her at first sight.Little eight is an appearance freak. At least the person she\u2019s looking for wouldn\u2019t be bad looking and Bai Xiye is a handsome man. In addition, he likes her. Nan Xun had to suspect that Bai Xiye is the boss she had been waiting for.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His background was very clear, and there were some rich people in his family.Some accidents, but Nan Xun guessed that this Bai Xiye may be pretending to be a good man, but in fact, he has evil thoughts.After Nan Xun determined the strategic goal, she excessively beat her spirit, after the other party took the initiative to ask her, she readily agreed.When Nan Xun went downstairs, Bai Xiye\u2019s car was stopped downstairs, and they went directly to the cinema with the best audio-visual effect in the city center.\u201cBai Xiye, did you book two horror movie tickets?\u201d Nan Xun looked at the creepy movie poster at the gate of the cinema and the corner of her mouth twitched.Bai Xiye smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t you girls like watching these kinds of things?\u201dNan Xun sighed in her heart, haha, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know your plan.There were many people on the weekends. This was a busy commercial area. At a glance, the theatre was almost full. So, Nan Xun was surprised to find that the seat to her left was empty.Maybe someone bought the ticket and suddenly didn\u2019t come, Nan Xun thought.Nan Xun estimated that Bai Xiye wanted her to shrink into his arms when she saw half the film. She intended to cooperate with him. However, the special effects of this movie were so bad that she dozed off while watching.In a daze, she seemed to have tilted her head and fell onto the shoulder of the man besides her.His shoulders were wide and solid. She rubbed against it twice and went to sleep peacefully.She didn\u2019t know how long she was asleep for, but she suddenly woke up because of the screams around her.By this time, the movie had reached its climax and the people around were screaming with fear.Besides her, Bai Xiye looked at her helplessly. \u201cMo Mo, you can sleep even watching horror movies.\u201dNan Xun looked at him, his expression was somewhat stupid.Just now, she was sleeping in a daze and didn\u2019t think about it. Now, her head seemed that it was tilted to the left, but Bai Xiye was sitting on her\u2026right.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but swallow a bit of saliva and asked with difficulty, \u201cDid the person sitting on my left just left now?\u201dBai Xiye replied, \u201cNo, it\u2019s been empty.\u201dNan Xun suddenly felt that her whole body was cold. She just watched a movie that wasn\u2019t scary but now she was a little afraid.\u201cCan we change seats?\u201d Nan Xun asked.Bai Xiye joked: \u201cMo Mo, are you afraid?\u201dThe two changed seats and there were people on both sides of her, so Nan Xun wasn\u2019t so scared.Finally, Nan Xun felt relieved when the movie finished, and the surrounding lights lit up.Bai Xiye insisted on driving Nan Xun back. Thinking of the strange things that happened today, Nan Xun nodded and agreed.Bai Xiye took her all the way upstairs, and before he left, he stared at Nan Xun.Nan Xun thought that she was going to attack the target anyway, it was okay to give some sweetness, so she stood on her tippy toes and gently kissed his face.Just after the kiss, Nan Xun sneezed and muttered: \u201cThe weather seems to be getting cold these days.\u201dBai Xiye also hugged his arms and looked at her and smiled. \u201cIt seems that it\u2019s really cold.\u201dWhen Bai Xiye was far away, Nan Xun quickly opened the door and entered the house.Just as soon as she entered the door, Nan Xun heard a discordant noise.This sound was still coming from her own room.\u201cAh\u2026oh\u2026 faster, quickly\u2026\u201d\u201cOh\u2026honey, you\u2019re great\u2026\u201dIt seemed to be the voices of Lin Jingwan and a man.Nan Xun\u2019s face turned black in a flash. She listened patiently for a long time. When she was sure there could be no mistake, there were two people in it. They were turning over in her bed!Nan Xun kicked the door open and yelled at the pile of white flowers on her bed. \u201cLin Jingwan! You stinky girl\u2014\u201dHalf an hour later, the wild man disappeared, and Lin Jingwan also woke up.\u201cMo Mo, I\u2019m sorry, this time I really drank too much. I didn\u2019t mean to. I mistook your room for mine.\u201dLin Jingwan had a good attitude while admitting her mistake, but Nan Xun was still very worried.Although she didn\u2019t have any serious cleanliness habits, she thought that was the place where she sleeps. Not long ago, two people were doing vigorous activities and the bed might still have something bad left behind. She was a bit\u2026Nan Xun spent the night on the sofa.The next day, Nan Xun was determined to move out.Lin Jingwan felt a little guilty. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mo Mo. A dog can\u2019t stop himself from eating shit, but this time I\u2019m serious. I may have talked about this for a long time, so\u2026I\u2019m thinking of moving out.\u201dNan Xun shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ll go out. Anyway, I will find a place to live before long. It\u2019s not difficult to find a house now. My salary is more than ever before.\u201dLin Jingwan also knew her temper and left.But the next day, Nan Xun beat Lin Jingwan to death. Before she moved out, Lin Jingwan brought the man back from yesterday.Nan Xun whose heart was stuffed, moved to the bar that evening.Bai Xiye heard that she lived in the bar and immediately said that he has a vacant villa that she could live in.If Bai Xiye was an irrelevant person, Nan Xun will certainly not agree, but he was the boss whose evil value was 100. Once she lives with him, the two would have more chances to get along. Only by knowing the source of Bai Xiye\u2019s evil thoughts, she can find a way to help him eliminate it.In addition, Nan Xun just didn\u2019t want to go back to the original house. Then, he should come down and help her move in tomorrow.Bai Xiye was happy to help her move. Nan Xun didn\u2019t have many things, so she quickly packed them. She didn\u2019t ask for some of the hanging orchids on the balcony and didn\u2019t take the vase full of white chrysanthemum. Her mood was very sour now and she was afraid she wouldn\u2019t have time to take care of any flowers and plants.With a bang, after the two left, the vase fell to the ground, split and the white chrysanthemum also scattered on the ground, stained with water, it looked extraordinary\u2026delicate and beautiful.The two simply cleaned the villa together. The villa has two floors. Nan Xun likes the large balcony on the second floor, so they moved everything to the bedroom on the second floor.Bai Xiye helped her settle down and left. Before leaving, he looked at her reluctantly.Nan Xun threw a kiss at him and smiled, \u201cThank you, Xiye, thank you for being such a gentleman.\u201dBai Xiye smiled bitterly. \u201cMo Mo, do you think I don\u2019t want to stay? I\u2019m just afraid of scaring you.\u201dNan Xun rolled her eyes in her heart. Then, if you had openly asked me to be your girlfriend, I would have promised.She feels that she was now Bai Xiye\u2019s little lover and she couldn\u2019t see the light.But it doesn\u2019t matter. As long as she has time to get along, she will have a chance to eliminate Bai Xiye\u2019s evil thoughts.However, they have been together for seven or eight days. Nan Xun couldn\u2019t see the source of Bai Xiye\u2019s evil thoughts. He has good family conditions and a healthy growing environment. Now he was the winner of both love and career.Nan Xun has some doubts about whether she found the wrong person.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It took her a long time to reach it and she pulled it down smoothly.Suddenly, Nan Xun\u2019s back was stiff.She felt that there was someone behind her who was looking at her. She turned around abruptly but there was no one there.It seemed that there was a gap in the floor-to-ceiling windows and the wind came in from the crevice, bringing in a coolness which made the elegant and light curtains to stir.Nan Xun hurriedly closed the windows and then continued to take off her skirt.Halfway through, she felt that she was being stared at by something more obvious.Nan Xun turned around and looked for a long time. Once she determined there was nothing, she felt slightly relieved.She seemed to be a little nervous recently.Nan Xun quickly took off her dress and then sprinted at a high speed and charged into the bathroom.\u201cHehe.\u201d A low-pitched laughter sounded, but in a blink of an eye it disappeared into the wind.Although she lived in an empty villa, one of Bai Xiye\u2019s property, he also expressed his intention of supporting her euphemistically. Nan Xun was an independent woman, she insisted on going to the bar to do her own business.On this day, the bar business was a bit deserted. When she went to sing in the evening, there were only a few scattered people.Nan Xun sat down on the stage and quietly sang a soothing love song <<chasing>> into the microphone.</chasing>It was as if the soft whispering in a singing voice that was sad beyond words, recounted their unsuccessful love, after the song, the people applauded.The bar where Nan Xun sings at is a quiet bar. The environment is very good. Most people come here to relax, drink a glass of wine and listen to the soothing love song. A day\u2019s fatigue can be eliminated.Nan Xun glanced over at the several guests in the bar and smiled and saw that they enjoyed themselves very much.Everything was normal, but she didn\u2019t know why she had a strange feeling.Suddenly there was a cool breeze on her ear, which made Nan Xun shudder.Where was the wind coming from in this enclosed bar?Nan Xun\u2019s hand that held the microphone couldn\u2019t help but grip it more. She wondered if she was ill recently. She always loves to hear and fantasize things.Nan Xun sat alone on the stage, feeling the cold air surrounding her, leaving her nowhere to escape.She tried to put aside the abnormal thing and sang the second song <<secret love=\"\">> into the microphone.</secret>She sang a song that was very provocative, it was about an unfortunate love that she didn\u2019t asked for and the pain that couldn\u2019t be bear.Because there were not many people, when she sang the second song the applause was sparse.But here, Nan Xun suddenly gripped the microphone in her hand.She heard a person\u2019s applause that had came from behind her, clearly for a moment.Nan Xun turned her head a little and glanced behind her.\u2026\u2026no one.Nan Xun suddenly felt a chill from her foot which drenched her heart cold.No one, where did the applause come from?She didn\u2019t hear wrong, someone really applauded behind her.At this time, Nan Xun finally faced the speculation in her heart.She thought her conjecture was a little funny, but she couldn\u2019t laugh at all at this time.Nan Xun poked the villain in her heart and sneered at little eight. \u201cLittle eight, do you know that I want to kill you, so you hid and don\u2019t speak? I thought this was a small and fresh world, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be such a heavy world. It\u2019s better that this is my fantasy. Listen, otherwise\u2026haha, if I find the chance, I will crack your head.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know when she provoked this kind of thing.She thought to herself that she had done nothing wrong, and Bai Mo had done nothing wrong, and even if this world was haunted, she shouldn\u2019t have been approached.Nan Xun was overwhelmed by the speculation from her heart. Even in the last world, when she witnessed the Demon King eating people, she didn\u2019t panic much.Because the unknown is often the most terrible.After she sang two songs, Nan Xun hurriedly got off the stage.She wanted to leave here immediately.At this moment, a couple left, and Nan Xun breathe a sigh of relief. She didn\u2019t dare to look at other people\u2019s faces. She said hello to her old acquaintance the bartender and left behind the couple closely.Soon, Nan Xun returned to the crowd, it was a busy city here.Listening to the bustling cries and dazzling neon lights, Nan Xun\u2019s tense heart relaxed a little.Nan Xun came to the bus stop she took daily and there was a crowd of people. Because the bar was located in the business center and wasn\u2019t far away, this was downtown, so the number of people getting on wasn\u2019t small and there was more than ten.However, at the next moment, Nan Xun suddenly thought of something and panicked.She had just moved into Bai Xiye\u2019s villa, it wasn\u2019t in a remote location, but it definitely wasn\u2019t flourishing. So, she had to take another bus after getting off this one.Nan Xun wanted to give Bai Xiye a call and ask the boss to pick her up. It\u2019s said that ghosts are afraid of the wicked. Bai Xiye\u2019s evil thoughts were at 100, so ghosts should definitely be afraid of him.However, Nan Xun made several phone calls and none of them were answered.At this time, the bus had reached the destination and Nan Xun had to get off.Several people who just got off the bus quickly left one by one until she was the only one waiting for the last bus at the station.The summer wind was a bit cool and Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but shrink her body and pinch the phone in her hand.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but make another call. The line was busy all the time and she didn\u2019t know what was going on.Fortunately, Nan Xun didn\u2019t wait too long for the bus to arrive and she got on the bus in a hurry.The uncle driver looked at her and said with a smile, Little girl, don\u2019t be out so late in the future.\u201dNan Xun grinned, \u201cThank you, uncle. I\u2019ll pay attention later.\u201dNan Xun glanced in the bus and saw that in the last row, sat a man in a white shirt.At this time, Nan Xun especially wanted to talk to someone, so she went to the man and sat down and greeted him.The man next to her looked out the window and couldn\u2019t help but turn his head towards her after hearing her voice.This man was very handsome with deep eyes, he wore a white shirt and western-styled trouser and leather shoes. He was dressed as an elite of the upper class.Nan Xun thought he felt familiar but couldn\u2019t remember where she has seen him.Nan Xun smiled at him and asked, \u201cI\u2019m going to the front styled villa town. I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re headed?\u201dThe man looked at her and replied, \u201cMe too.\u201dHis voice was very pleasant, clear and cool, and the speed was slow and steady.There was someone to accompany her in conversation and Nan Xun\u2019s previous panic diminished.The man was not talkative, but it was very comfortable to chat with him. No matter what she said, he would follow-up and throw out a new topic.After arriving at the station, the two got off the bus together, and Nan Xun, whose mood was now normal, was happy to say goodbye to the uncle driver.The uncle driver\u2019s lips twitched slightly, and he smiled a bit ugly.When Nan Xun was far away, the driver quickly looked back in the bus. It\u2019s clear there was no one else in the bus. He didn\u2019t know who the little girl was talking to just now\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two walked and talked, and the laughter continued. Nan Xun was the only one who was smiling. It seemed that the man had face paralysis and didn\u2019t like to smile. But when he was in a good mood, she could see the smile deep in his eyes, it was charming as if there were stars in them.The man sent Nan Xun to the villa\u2019s door.Nan Xun was very grateful, \u201cTo be honest, I was afraid of something happening today, so thank you for accompanying me all the way here. By the way, where do you live, is it nearby?\u201dThe man nodded, \u201cI live here too. Go in, I\u2019ll leave when you go in.\u201dNan Xun opened the door, her mind suddenly pumped, and asked, \u201cWould you like to come in for a cup of tea?\u201dThe man first glimpsed and a smile slowly formed in his eyes, \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid that I may go in, rob money and rape you?\u201dNan Xun laughed, \u201cThe man who dares to rob me has yet to be born. You may not know since I look like a lady, but I am actually very powerful.\u201d Taekwondo level 10 and mixed martial arts level 10 to boast.After hearing this, the smile in the man\u2019s eyes were more intense, \u201cI believe you. Then in that case, I\u2019ll go in and ask to drink tea1.\u201dNan Xun originally meant it as a polite courtesy but didn\u2019t expect that he was really rude.But she said it and it was spilt milk, she was forced to put on a bold face to invite the person to go in.This person just asked for a cup of tea and left. Nan Xun breathe a sigh of relief.The light on the second floor of the villa was lit up, and the man had already gone far outside the door. The warm streetlights shone on the man, and there was no shadow on the ground.There were no weird occurrences in the next few days and Nan Xun\u2019s heart finally calmed down.After Nan Xun moved into the villa, Ba Xiye would come to eat every day, saying that the rice she cooked tasted like home.In fact, Nan Xun was annoyed to death with Bai Xiye coming over every day. When he comes, Nan Xun has to cook a tableful of rich meals every day in order to brush the other\u2019s affection. Moreover, the commodity wasn\u2019t conscious nor considerate. He didn\u2019t wash the dishes actively and stopped to rest after eating. So, the dishes were piled high and Nan Xun\u2019s heart was tired.Nan Xun recalled the last time and joked, \u201cBai Xiye, I called you so many times last time. Why were you so busy the entire time? Tell me the truth, are you treating me like a little mistress and was afraid I would talk endlessly on the phone?Bai Xiye was confused. He quickly took out his cell phone and didn\u2019t see any call records.\u201cMo Mo, don\u2019t wrong me. When have I not answered your calls? Even if I\u2019m talking to someone else, I make sure to cut it off as soon as I receive a call from you.\u201dNow it was Nan Xun\u2019s turn to be shocked.After a while, Nan Xun suddenly said: \u201cBai Xiye, find me a psychiatrist.\u201dThis scared Bai Xiye so much that he immediately asked, \u201cMo Mo, what\u2019s the matter?\u201dNan Xun told him some of the strange things that happened these days.After hearing this, Bai Xiye breathed a sigh of relief and joked that she might have seen too many horror movies, but in order to reassure her, he contacted a psychiatrist.The psychiatrist was Li Mu, an old classmate of Bai Xiye.Dr. Li arrived with gold rimmed glasses on the bridge of his nose and smiled professionally. \u201cMiss Bai don\u2019t worry. You probably feel mentally unstable due to insufficient rest. Just take a few more days off.\u201dNan Xun silently rolled her eyes. \u201cDr. Li, what do you think about the sleep quality of a person who sleeps more than nine hours a day without waking up in the middle of sleeping?\u201dDr. Li seemed to understand what she meant and let Nan Xun lie on the sofa.\u201cMiss Bai, listen to my instructions and relax.\u201dNan Xun let go of herself and relaxed and waited to hear what he wanted to say.\u201cMiss Bai, now you are walking on a lush meadow. You can hear the sound of the wind blowing against the leaves. The river is flowing, the birds are flying in the sky. Then you walk and see three doors. One door is a wooden door with green vines on it, the second is an iron door with a cold texture, and the third is the door of an old country house. Now, you choose one.\u201dNan Xun chose the third, the old country house door.She didn\u2019t want to say that she wanted to see a tableful of delicious food once she enters.At first, Nan Xun was able to distinguish dream from reality. Later, she actually felt like she was in front of a big house.Somehow, the house looked familiar.Dr. Li\u2019s hypnotic voice was low and deep. \u201cAfter you open the door and walk in, what do you see behind the door?\u201dNan Xun pushed the door open and went in. She saw the lush flowers and plants in the yard, then she opened another door and went in and was shocked at what she saw.Come on, she actually saw a tableful of delicious food on the dining table in the hall, it was her most favorite dishes!Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but sit down and have a taste. The taste was wonderful, it could compete against the food from a five-star hotel.Just then, she heard the sound of vegetables and meat being cut in the kitchen.Nan Xun put down the tableware and slowly walked over.She peeked her head into the kitchen.There was a man in the kitchen, wearing a white shirt, black trousers, and shoes that hadn\u2019t been changed yet2, black leather shoes.The figure of the man\u2019s backside who was cooking with his head down was very attractive.His body was very good, his legs were straight, and the muscles on his arms were loose because of his movements from cutting vegetables, which made the rolled-up sleeves shake gently.He focused on the things in his hands and as if he noticed someone was behind him, his movement paused slightly, and he slowly turned his head.At this moment, Nan Xun actually looked forward to seeing that face.But when the man turned around, Nan Xun\u2019s eyes suddenly widened.This person has no face!\u201cAh\u2014\u201dNan Xun screamed, suddenly opened her eyes and woke up.Dr. Li was shocked by her and quickly asked, \u201cMiss Bai, what did you see behind the door you chose?\u201dNan Xun swallowed her saliva and whispered, \u201cI saw many dishes on the table, which were my favorite. Then I heard someone cutting vegetables in the kitchen, so I went into the kitchen. As a result\u2026 I saw a man who had no face.\u201dDr. Li was still smiling at first while listening, but he was a bit unhappy after hearing this. He thought that Nan Xun was playing with him.After his hypnosis just now, the things the patient sees are usually what he has arranged in advance from the scene. Those who had money behind the door and a handsome man means that there has been too much pressure recently and were struggling materially or emotionally. How could Miss Bai see a man without a face?If she\u2019s not playing with him, then what was it?If it wasn\u2019t because Bai Xiye was the one who personally introduced this woman to him, he might have hit the person on the spot.Nan Xun also saw that Dr. Li wasn\u2019t happy. She didn\u2019t want to make trouble for the big boss, so she smiled and said, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ve seen too many horror movies recently, so I had this illusion.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This time you must cooperate well.\u201dNan Xun quickly agreed.This time, Dr. Li didn\u2019t let her close her eyes directly. He took out a pocket watch from his pocket and hung it over her head and gently swayed it.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes stared at the pocket watch that kept constantly swinging, her eyelids became heavier and heavier until she slowly closed them.She was surrounded by a vast expanse of white, until the distant sky came instantly, the fog around her gradually dispersed and she slowly saw the surrounding scene.She was standing on a street surrounded by a stream of vehicles, waiting for the green light to cross the pedestrian crossing.She looked across the street and saw a man.The man wore white shirt and black trousers, as if he had just come out of the company.Tall, straight, handsome, can be seen at a glance within the crowd.Nan Xun thought it was strange that she could see his face clearly, but she couldn\u2019t remember what his face looked like.The man stood on the side of the street with no expression and looked cold. Suddenly he looked at her, and the pair of bottomless eyes went straight to her, and his face suddenly changed. There was a trace of hidden happiness within his eyes.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but look at her left and right side, but there was no one besides her.He was watching\u2026 her.Suddenly, the man ran towards her, his eyes seemed to have nothing else besides what he saw, completely forgetting about everything.Then, Nan Xun heard the sharp, harsh brakes, followed by a violent crash.The man fell to the ground and was covered in blood.Nan Xun looked at the man who was hit by the car and suddenly felt it was hard to breathe and was out of breath.The man was lying in the pool of blood and his mouth squirmed twice, seemingly calling, \u201cBai Mo\u2026\u201dNan Xun suddenly woke up, sat up and gasped heavily.She looked around for a week and saw Dr. Li, who was frowning.\u201cMiss Bai, what did you saw just now?\u201dNan Xun described the dream from now and Dr. Li\u2019s brow wrinkled more tightly.\u201cMiss Bai, your situation is more serious than I thought. If you\u2019re not playing me, I think you may have some mental problems.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026She felt that the other party was euphemistically saying that she was crazy.She was so angry that some people said she was crazy.Dr. Li returned his pocket watch, drew two lines on the medical record and then prescribed several medications for Nan Xun.\u201cMiss Bai, if you don\u2019t get better after taking these drugs, I suggest you\u2013\u201d he paused and reached for his glasses on the bridge of his nose. \u201cYou can go to the psychiatry department to have a look. Please don\u2019t be angry, I just give my advice objectively. You can have your own thoughts.\u201dWith that, he looked at the wall clock habitually.But at this point, his vision suddenly seemed fixated.Nan Xun called out twice, \u201cDr. Li? Dr. Li?\u201dShe felt that something was wrong and hurriedly looked into the man\u2019s eyes, only to find that his eyes became dimmed, as if when he looked at the wall clock, he had been hypnotized.Not long after, he suddenly widened his eyes in horror, his mouth and nose were bleeding, and his whole body began to twitch which seemed like epilepsy.Nan Xun was frightened and quickly rushed out to shout.Rescue was sent to Dr. Li. Nan Xun didn\u2019t know what happened to him, but later heard that he seemed to be a little deranged and was temporarily sent to the neurology department for treatment.Since then, Bai Xiye and Nan Xun didn\u2019t mention seeing a psychiatrist.Nan Xun was more and more sure that she was entangled with something dirty. But since the big boss was Bai Xiye whose evil value was 100, Nan Xun\u2019s courage was bigger. They say that ghosts were afraid of the wicked. Bai Xiye\u2019s evil thoughts were worth 100. As long as she was with him, that thing wouldn\u2019t be able to harm her.At first, their nerves were tense. Later, Nan Xun said that she didn\u2019t seem to hear any strange sounds recently and Bai Xiye was relieved.These days, Nan Xun\u2019s affairs were not good. So, Bai Xiye will stay with her for a while. However, he was careful with Nan Xun and never asked to stay.But this time, it was heavily raining outside.\u201cMo Mo, it\u2019s raining outside. Look, can I rest here today?\u201d Bai Xiye asked.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cThis is your villa. You can rest if you want, but you can only stay in the bedroom on the first floor.\u201dBai Xiye answered happily.After dinner, Nan Xun put away the dishes and chopsticks, then they sat on the sofa together to watch a movie.While watching, Bai Xiye suddenly held Nan Xun\u2019s face and lowered his head to kiss her.Nan Xun was startled, reached out her hand and blocked his face. She said with a smile, \u201cXiye, aren\u2019t we progressing too fast?\u201dBai Xiye was really a gentleman. As soon as she refused, he gave up and looked disappointed.Nan Xun was astonished and was at a loss. How proper was he? Is this really the villainous boss with evil thoughts of 100?\u201cMo Mo, do you really like me?\u201d Bai Xiye asked suddenly.Nan Xun hesitated and quickly replied: \u201cI like, ah, look at you, you\u2019re handsome and rich and so good to me. Where can I find such a good boyfriend, ah, if it isn\u2019t you?\u201dWhen Bai Xiye heard this, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cMo Mo, you\u2019re so straightforward, but I like this about you. You know, when we met for the first time and that pickpocket stole your things that day, you threw your high-heeled shoes off your feet and ran after them, I thought such a woman was rare, especially free and easy going.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s mouth twitched and, in her heart, said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You haven\u2019t seen me rolled up my sleeves and made a stand, then that would have been really handsome.\u201dIt was late and Nan Xun yawned and was about to go upstairs to go to sleep.Bai Xiye looked at her for a long time and was tempted to make a move.He couldn\u2019t help but grab Nan Xun\u2019s arm and stole a kiss from her face when she got up to leave.Nan Xun quickly patted at his paws. \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble, it\u2019s already late.\u201dBai Xiye loosened his hand.Nan Xun slept all night without a dream until dawn. She stretched, pulled open the curtain from the French window, and looked at the golden sunshine pouring onto the ground, shining her body warm.Nan Xun went downstairs and found that Bai Xiye had already left. She went to the kitchen to heat a glass of milk and fry an egg.Just after breakfast, Nan Xun received a text message from Bai Xiye, saying that she needs to go to a western restaurant to wait for him.In order to maintain the best impression of herself at all times, Nan Xun deliberately changed into her favorite white dress.Before she reached her destination, Nan Xun saw Bai Xiye across the street, holding a bunch of red roses in his hand and waving them towards her with a smile.But in the next second, he widened his eyes in horror, and the whole man flew forward uncontrollably and landed in the middle of the road.Just then, a large truck drove over.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her gaping eyes only saw the pool of blood and his scattered limbs.Nan Xun\u2019s body shook all over.Then she bent over and vomited.How could this be? Bai Xiye was the big boss with an evil value worth 100. How could he die? How can he\u2026\u201cFuck! How can I see such a bloody scene as soon as I wake up!\u201d Suddenly, there was a familiar voice that sounded in her head.Nan Xun was stunned at first, then cried with joy. \u201cLittle eight, you finally woken up, oh\u2026I miss you, little eight, you don\u2019t know what happened to me during this time, I was really scared\u2026fortunately this older sister isn\u2019t an ordinary girl, I would have been frightened to death several times\u2026\u201dThe void beast directly said, \u201cWeren\u2019t you okay while I was away? How come when I wake up, you became so stupid?\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cLet\u2019s get out of here first.\u201d The void beast said.Nan Xun foolishly oh, then her expression quickly changed to cry, \u201cWhy do you say that when Bai Xiye, Bai Xiye died? Last night, I was lucky to be by myself and persuaded him and I didn\u2019t die.\u201dAlthough, in the short period of time the two got along, Bai Xiye was really good to her. All of this happened so suddenly. She never thought that Bai Xiye would die. Wasn\u2019t he the villain boss with evil thoughts worth 100?The void beast comforted her with a sentence, \u201cLife and death are all part of life, it\u2019s useless to be sad.\u201dNan Xun calmed down for a while and suddenly said, \u201cLittle eight, I always feel that when your here, I\u2019m not afraid of anything.\u201dThe void beast proudly snorted, \u201cNo, even if you have an accident, laozi will take you away with the void, so don\u2019t be afraid, let\u2019s boldly face the big boss. You have this grandfather, wait a minute, I\u2019ll calculate the progress.\u201dNan Xun was trying to tell it that the villain boss may have been killed by the ghost, but before Nan Xun could speak, she hears little eight suddenly shout.\u201cNan Xun! What were you doing? I remember when I brought you here, the target\u2019s blackening value was only 50. How can it be 100 now? And his evil value is at 100, you didn\u2019t even wipe a point! What were you doing for so many days?\u201dNan Xun asked stupidly, \u201cWasn\u2019t the big boss Bai Xiye, little eight?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t him.\u201d\u201cWho is it then?\u201d Nan Xun quickly asked.The void beast was silent for a while, and faltered, \u201cSince you haven\u2019t found out, forget it. Soon, you will know.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026One person and one beast have a chat. Nan Xun just witnessed with her own eyes a living man crushed by a truck. She was a little frightened, panicked and disgusted. But now these emotions have gradually subsided, but she still didn\u2019t dare to look back.After receiving the report, the traffic police rushed to the scene and surrounded it.Nan Xun walked numbly on the road, remembering what little eight had just told her.\u201cLittle eight, did I really provoke something that I shouldn\u2019t?\u201dFor a moment, the void beast was silent.\u201cDid Bai Xiye die because of it?\u201d The void beast paused and then sounded an en.Nan Xun suddenly became angry. If there was anything, he should have directly come to her. Why should he hurt innocent people!What\u2019s the matter with ghosts? Can they kill people indiscriminately?Nan Xun\u2019s anger was followed by a deep sense of guilt and remorse.She thought that Bai Xiye was the big boss that she had been waiting for, so she let him get close to her and happily accepted his help.If she knew that this would have happened earlier, she would have never touched this person\u2026\u201cLittle eight, do you think the dead will meet another void beast like me and get a chance to live again?\u201d Nan Xun looked at the crowd all around her and suddenly her mood fell.The void beast: \u201c\u2026maybe.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s indifferent gaze became softer, whispering: \u201c\u2026that\u2019s good.\u201dThe void beast comforted her, \u201cYou can\u2019t control their life and death. Even if it\u2019s not you, they would have died in other ways. Believe me, everyone\u2019s life and death in every world is doomed. We can only intervene but not destroy the established balance.\u201dNan Xun lowered her voice and no longer spoke.With little eight on her side, Nan Xun soon changed back to the heartless Nan Xun that little eight was familiar with.She couldn\u2019t live in the villa, Nan Xun packed her things and went back to the bar to live.But this wasn\u2019t a long-term solution. Nan Xun began to search for rental information on the internet.After searching for a long time, it was either too expensive or too far away.Nan Xun yawned and laid down on the sofa in the private room.\u201cLittle eight, you see, you found such a fuck up body for me, Dr. Li who was a psychiatrist that I met, and the rest, Zhao Qilin and Bai Xiye are all dead and one was especially killed by a car. Have you ever seen someone flung out in front of a car to get hit?\u201d\u201cWell, what do you want to say?\u201d\u201cIf I got close to the big villain boss whose evil value is worth 100, I\u2019ll get killed before I could reform him. Although I would like to bring this thing to justice and obtain justice for the dead, I am a very self-aware person. If I can\u2019t do it, I have to flee. We have wasted so much time in this world now. We can\u2019t waste any more time. Why not\u2026go straight to the next world?\u201d Nan Xun looked serious.The void beast paused and said, \u201cYou really think a lot, really. You did a good job in the last world. Later, it was an accident that the evil value of the Demon King rebounded from 1 to 100, so I\u2019m optimistic about you in this world~\u201dNan Xun, whom high hopes were inexplicably placed on: \u2026\u201cBut now I haven\u2019t even met the big villain boss. There\u2019s no way to eliminate the evil thoughts.\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cYou have already met.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s face was muddled. \u201cWhen, how could I not remember?\u201dThe void beast coughed, \u201cThink about it again, the face beauty value is relatively high. After all, this grandfather is a face freak. The big boss you are looking for is a handsome guy with long legs.\u201dNan Xun really couldn\u2019t remember. She sung in the bar every day. She meets many handsome men, but she doesn\u2019t remember any of them.\u201cWait! Little eight, how do you know that I\u2019ve met him? Didn\u2019t you just wake up before?\u201dThe void beast chuckled and laughed. \u201cI will wake up from time to time. I just saw it during one of those times. I wanted to remind you, but I saw you talking and went back to sleep.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026She still couldn\u2019t remember who it was. There were many people who happily talk to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were suddenly thrown forward by some strange force, and they landed in the middle of the road and watched themselves get smashed by the vehicle.The probability of a car accident was not high, but if two people who had died contacted the same person, that person would be criticized.\u201cLittle eight, do I look like a disaster star?\u201d Nan Xun asked.The void beast authentically replied, \u201cOh no, you\u2019re my lucky star, my merits depends on you.\u201dIn one day, there was no place to live, no place to work, and no shadow of the villain boss. Nan Xun thought this was really a fucking world.Nan Xun flipped through some of the most reliable rental information she recorded yesterday and got the cheapest one.After receiving the call, the landlord enthusiastically recommended her a house which had two bedrooms and one hall, and quickly sent two photos.Nan Xun was surprised after seeing it.The room looked very good and well decorated. All the landlord\u2019s furniture was inside and wasn\u2019t moved out. There was even an expensive piano as well. Why was such a good place so cheap?The landlord hesitated to explain a few words, frankly because of personal reasons, he wanted to rent it out quickly.Nan Xun now has little eight, and was not afraid of any danger, so she left the bar and went to the new house directly with her suitcase.The house was as good as the landlord said and was fully furnished.But soon, Nan Xun found something wrong.Her rental was located in an entire building and she seemed to be the only resident.Even if it was in an old district, the other homes shouldn\u2019t be empty, isn\u2019t this too wasteful?Nan Xun asked little eight if it knew the reason.Little eight directly answered, \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid, you can find another companion to live with?\u201dNan Xun replied, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid, I\u2019m comfortable with living alone, I can do as I wish unrestrained.\u201dLittle eight thought and unexpectedly agreed with her, \u201cI think living alone is also very good.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cNo, I suddenly feel that living alone is very lonely. I\u2019d better find someone to share the rent and even share some money with me.\u201dLittle eight: \u2026What a capricious woman.Nan Xun immediately advertised the shared housing information on the internet, because the bedrooms in the house were locked, and she also indicated that there were no gender limitations on the ad.Nan Xun thought it would take several days for news, but she didn\u2019t expect to get a phone call that night.The phone number that called her was vaguely familiar, but Nan Xun couldn\u2019t remember from where.\u201cHello, hi, is this Miss Bai? I saw the shared housing information that you posted online. Would you consider renting short-term?\u201dIt was a man\u2019s voice which was low. He didn\u2019t speak quickly or slowly. It gave people the impression that he was a gentleman.Nan Xun hurriedly replied that she didn\u2019t mind. He could move in at any time. The rent could be paid on a monthly or daily basis.Because the house rented by Nan Xun was located in the corner of the community, it wasn\u2019t easy to find. Nan Xun said warmly to the other party that if he couldn\u2019t find his way to the community, he should call her, and she would pick up.The void beast suddenly said, \u201cHave you forgotten that you are a woman? How about being more reserved?\u201dNan Xun rolled her beautiful eyes, \u201cLittle eight, I didn\u2019t ask you. Your mind is really too dirty. I\u2019m not asking for a booty call. If I don\u2019t have a better attitude, who would like to rent with me?\u201dAt nine o\u2019clock sharp, Nan Xun received a call and hurriedly went out to meet her new roommate.She looked around and finally found a man at the back entrance of the community.The man was standing straight under a big tree, half of his face was shaded by the tree\u2019s shadow, while the other half was shrouded by the pale-yellow street lamplight, white and transparent.\u201cAre you Miss Bai Mo?\u201d The man suddenly asked, his voice was a little lower than on the phone, but it gave a very refreshing feeling.When Nan Xun heard this sentence, she felt that something was strange, but her brain seemed to be stuck by something and she couldn\u2019t remember.As the man talked, he took a step forward and came out of the shadow.It\u2019s a very handsome man.He kept short fresh hair, the front of his hair was combed up, revealing a full forehead and a pair of dark eyes. His eyes were very deep as if you couldn\u2019t see the bottom at a glance. His nose was high, his thin lips were slightly pursed, and his face was expressionless.Nan Xun felt that he was familiar but couldn\u2019t remember at that moment.As for Nan Xun, this person, her memory has always been bad, or she was a bit heartless and didn\u2019t bother to remember.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t think of it anymore and unexpectedly was very enthusiastic about chatting with others. \u201c\u2026Although the house is a little bit out of the way, it\u2019s better to have a quiet environment. I\u2019ll take care of the cleanliness of the home. Don\u2019t worry about it. Just don\u2019t give me a pile of stinky socks and stinky underwear.\u201dThe man besides her listened quietly. When he heard this, he suddenly let out a low sound, like laughter. But when Nan Xun looked at him, his face was expressionless.She found out from the beginning of the chat, that this person seemed to never smile. Nan Xun thought that he might have face paralysis and was unable to laugh, but when he looked at Nan Xun, there was always a smile in his eyes, which made people easily feel good about him.The eyes were very deep. Staring at them for a long time, there seemed to be a faint red from the white. It\u2019s not blood-red, but it looked like a drop of blood that was faint and faded.His hair was black, like the color of the night.The lips were thin, and the color was light and fleshy.Against his white complexion compared to ordinary people, she felt that he was more like a person that came out of an ink painting.Very beautiful, it\u2019s a beautiful man.However, the longer she looked, the more familiar Nan Xun felt. She must have seen this man somewhere.When the other party saw her staring at himself, he asked what she was looking at.Nan Xun replied with a smile, \u201cI think you look good.\u201dThe man looked at her, the smile in his eyes was more apparent\u201cBy the way, my name is Bai Mo. What\u2019s your name? What should I call you in the future?\u201dThe man paused and replied, \u201cMy name is Fu Mo.\u201dNan Xun accidentally quickly said, \u201cDo you want to pay the landlord directly, Fu? I had a high school classmate whose surname is Fu.\u201d She said with some regret, \u201cBut he died last month.\u201dWhen Fu Mo heard this, he didn\u2019t touch on the subject much and just faintly replied, \u201cYou are sad.\u201dNan Xun sighed: \u201cThe uncle and aunt are certainly very sad. The white-haired people can\u2019t bear to send the black-haired people first.\u201d\u201cAnd you?\u201d The man besides her suddenly asked.Nan Xun was stunned and truthfully replied, \u201cI just think it\u2019s a pity that he was so young and outstanding. To be honest, I can\u2019t remember him at all, or I\u2019ve never seen what he looked like.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah\u2026\u201d Fu Mo looked at her and there was a dark light that flashed through his deep dark eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had a wide range of knowledge and can speak freely no matter what the topic was about.\u201cI\u2019ve always felt like I\u2019ve seen you somewhere?\u201d Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but take the initiative to ask.Fu Mo looked at her with his pair of deep eyes, his eyes became bright and clear under the streetlamp. \u201cI also have that feeling. I think I\u2019ve known you for a long time.\u201dIf it wasn\u2019t for the expressionless face of the speaker, Nan Xun almost thought that the other side was flirting with her or using very old-fashioned pick-up lines.Nan Xun looked at his side profile and thought that this man was very handsome, that is, his skin was pale, and he looked sickly.\u201cAh!\u201d Nan Xun suddenly called out and pointed at him and said, \u201cI know who you are!\u201dWhen Fu Mo heard this, his eyes narrowed slightly, and something seemed to be brewing from the depths of his eyes.\u201cOh? Then tell me who am I?\u201d He replied.Nan Xun said, \u201cDo you recognize me? Last time, I sat next to you on the bus, then you took me home.\u201dFu Mo looked at her, and the corner of his mouth was slightly hooked up. He smiled silently, \u201cYes, that was me.\u201dThe two chatted for a while and finally arrived in front of the building that was on the last corner.The streetlight in front of the building seemed to be broken, and the whole building was trapped in the dark night.Nan Xun regretted that when she left, she shouldn\u2019t have turned off the light to save electricity, it made the whole building dark and gave it a sinister feeling.Nan Xun promptly dashed upstairs and howled. She rustled to the sixth floor and at each level she turned on the stairway induction light.Just after she finished howling, Nan Xun didn\u2019t mean to cough twice. She rushed to the person besides her and explained: \u201cThe light is too old, and you can\u2019t see while you walk. At this time, you can only howl.\u201dThe smile in Fu Mo\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t scattered. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I like the darkness. I can go upstairs without the lights.\u201dThe two went upstairs and Nan Xun hurriedly took him to see another room. \u201cThis room is bigger than mine, but the lighting isn\u2019t as good as mine. If you like it, I can change it for you.\u201dFu Mo shook his head and replied: \u201cNo, I like this room very much. I don\u2019t like the strong sunlight.\u201dNan Xun listened to him and knew that he was ready to move in, but she thought that the other party had only came to see the house tonight and would move in tomorrow. Afterall, he didn\u2019t bring anything, but she didn\u2019t expect that Fu Mo would sit down on the sofa of the living room.\u201cYou\u2019re staying here tonight?\u201d Nan Xun was a little surprised, \u201cBut it didn\u2019t seem that you have brought anything with you.\u201dFu Mo looked at her, but there was a bit of banter in his eyes, \u201cIs it not ready for me to live in?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s advertisement on the internet indeed said they can move-in at any time, but it\u2019s also good to move in with a bag instead of being empty handed, right?Nan Xun said, \u201cThen, you can live here. By the way, have you had dinner? Do you want me to cook you a bowl of egg noodles?\u201dIn fact, the general way of asking this was to ask casually, so when she saw Fu Mo nod, Nan Xun had the feeling that she couldn\u2019t laugh or cry.She didn\u2019t expect that Fu Mo would be such an unkind person.However, she likes straight-forward people.In the kitchen, came the sound of cooking. Nan Xun fried an egg, then cut some carrots and chopped scallions and sprinkled it in. Finally, the delicious noodles were cooked.Nan Xun directly brought it to the coffee table in the living room, with a special service attitude. Ok, she had prepared to give Fu Mo her chopsticks.Suddenly she thought of something, Nan Xun quickly asked, \u201cThis bowl and chopsticks are what I use. Won\u2019t you dislike it?\u201dFu Mo replied, \u201cIf it\u2019s you, I don\u2019t mind.\u201dAfter receiving the egg noodles and chopsticks, he ate slowly.Nan Xun was confused by his words. Would he have mind if it was someone else?How did this sound like love talk?Nan Xun stared at him for a while. He ate very well, but the carrots in the bowl were pushed aside by him. It seemed that he didn\u2019t like it. Nan Xun also noticed that every time he ate, he would put the chopsticks in his mouth to suck on.The thin lips at the end of the chopsticks, gently sip, as if to taste its flavor in addition to the other flavors such as the egg noodles. He seemed to have tasted it for a long time.Somehow, Nan Xun\u2019s face turned red.The bowl of noodles soon revealed the bottom. Fu Mo looked up at her and smiled with satisfaction.\u201cThank you for your noodles. It\u2019s delicious. I\u2019ll cook for you tomorrow.\u201d Fu Mo said.Nan Xun hurriedly replied, \u201cDon\u2019t be so polite, it\u2019s just a bowl of noodles.\u201dNan Xun didn\u2019t take Fu Mo\u2019s words seriously.However, the next day, Nan Xun got up late and heard the sound of vegetables being chopped in the kitchen.Nan Xun peeked her head in the kitchen and saw a tall handsome man cutting vegetables.He was very serious while cutting vegetables, with his head slightly drooped, his white shirt rolled up and it revealed his white arm.Nan Xun inexplicably felt that this scene was familiar as if she seen it somewhere.When the man heard the sound, he looked back at her. He had a handsome face, a high nose, sword-like eyebrows, dark and narrow eyes. After seeing her, his eyes, which had no fluctuations at all, revealed a small smile which made him look a bit angry.\u201cAwake? You go to the living room to watch TV and I\u2019ll be done soon.\u201d Fu Mo said.Nan Xun stared, \u201cFu Mo, do you really want to cook for me? In that case, I\u2019m so sorry, ah.\u201dLittle eight at this time immediately interject with a sentence, \u201cDo you still have time to be embarrassed?\u201dNan Xun ignored it.Fu Mo said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. If it\u2019s for one person or for two. Besides, the ingredients that I used were all taken from the refrigerator. Do you mind if I make rice?\u201dObviously, it was clear that Nan Xun took advantage of this, but when the other party said that, it seemed as if he took advantage of her. How can such a small amount of money be worth the hard work of cooking a meal?Nan Xun saw that he was already half busy, so she wasn\u2019t polite and had the cheek to eat.\u201cFu Mo, can I help you?\u201dNan Xun rolled up her sleeves and was about to enter.\u201cI don\u2019t need your help. Go to the living room and watch TV. There should be a lot of Taiwanese dramas that are popular recently.\u201d Fu Mo stood at the door and looked at her with a smile.Somehow, Nan Xun felt that this kind of Fu Mo\u2026. was magnificent!\u201cThen, I\u2019ll go\u2026?\u201dFu Mo nodded slightly, and his voice was cold at this moment, which actually made people feel warm. \u201cGo ahead, when you finish watching, the meal will be ready.\u201dNan Xun drifted away precariously, she felt very strange. She knew the man in front of her for only one night. Oh, plus the last time when he sent her home, that was only two times, but she thought they seemed to know each other longer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nan Xun was nestled in the sofa, holding a bear pillow in her hand, listening to the sound of cooking from the kitchen. There was a smile of enjoyment on her lips.\u201cLittle eight, do you know? I always think that man wasn\u2019t reliable. The mother followed that man to show conjugal love by pledging undying love, the result\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, the man is scum. Do you know that he already has a wife and children? The mother was still foolishly kept in the dark. Later, she cried herself blind that she broke up with him decisively. I expected that that would have happened. So, I think I don\u2019t want to love in the future. If I were to get married, my significant other would be in the house and kitchen, I can go out to earn money to support my family.\u201dNan Xun hooked her lips, but her dark eyes were indifferent.The void beast: \u201c\u2026Did you get the role wrong? It\u2019s men who makes money and you who cooks.\u201dNan Xun whispered, \u201cI can cook, but the man is responsible for washing dishes. It\u2019s also half the chores for one person.\u201dThe void beast coughed a little, \u201c\u2026well, fuck there\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cShort oil, little eight you\u2019re one of my people and still swear.\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cThe man who is now cooking in your kitchen, cough, is your\u2026strategic goal, and more good news to tell you is that after getting along with him last night, his evil value dropped to 90.\u201d\u201cWhat? Fu Mo was the villain boss with evil intentions worth 100!\u201d Nan Xun thought it was unbelievable, \u201cBut I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a person with evil intentions worth 100. Is his heart black?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cThe blackening value has changed to 100. How wouldn\u2019t it be black? As for why the evil thoughts are so high\u2026hey, you\u2019ll find out later.\u201d\u201cLittle eight, can you not laugh like this? I\u2019m scared.\u201d Nan Xun was sure that little eight knew something but didn\u2019t say.\u201cBut I still want to thank you little eight, for finding me a very appetizing person this time.\u201dThe void beast sighed, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. You don\u2019t need to thank me. If you really want to thank me, I\u2019ll thank you when you\u2019ve eliminated the evil thoughts.\u201d\u201cLittle eight, does Fu Mo like me?\u201d Nan Xun asked shyly and covered her face. Fu Mo, a good man at home was really her kind of dish.The void beast quickly replied: \u201cLike, like a lot. In the future, you will deeply understand how much he likes you.\u201dThe smell of food was coming from the kitchen. Nan Xun wasn\u2019t hungry at first, but she felt hungry when she smelled it.\u201cFu Mo, it\u2019s so fragrant. Is it really ready so soon?\u201d Nan Xun goes to the kitchen door, stick her small head in and asked the man who was cooking with a smile.Fu Mo looked back at her with a gentle smile in his eyes. \u201cIt will be ready soon. Did you wait too long?\u201dNan Xun quickly shook her head and said, \u201cIt\u2019s just because the dish you cooked is so fragrant that I had to find an excuse to come and smell it.\u201d Then she sniffed, \u201cIt\u2019s so sweet.\u201dThe smile in Fu Mo\u2019s eyes were deep. \u201cYou can tidy up the table in the living room first. We can have dinner soon.\u201dNan Xun saluted him and said with a smile. \u201cYes, Mr. Fu Mo the virtuous man.\u201dFu Mo shook his head, his eyes were full of laughter with a strong feeling of indulgence and pampering.Nan Xun put away all the sundries from the table, wiped the table with a rag again and placed the chairs upright.Nan Xun sat on the chair and waited to eat.\u201cLittle eight, I\u2019m so happy. Fu Mo is really good. Later I\u2019ll take advantage of such a big virtuous boss. I love you to death!\u201dThe void beast\u2019s voice raised by one degree. \u201cAre you sure? \u201cNan Xun heard something was wrong but quickly changed her mind. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later, then you will say later.\u201dBut Nan Xun couldn\u2019t understand. How can a good man like Fu Mo be a boss with bad intentions worth 100? Little eight\u2019s reaction was also very bad. Was there an unknown side to Fu Mo?Nan Xun didn\u2019t think about it anymore because the food Fu Mo prepared was already ready.Nan Xun helped to serve the dishes.She looked at the three dishes and one soup on the table, Nan Xun thought to herself happily, the big villain boss not only likes her, but also had such good craftsmanship. Little eight was really too good to her.Nan Xun politely took the rice bowl that Fu Mo handed her, picked up her chopsticks and grabbed a big chunk.Nan Xun, who had a big appetite, ate two bowls of rice in one breath, and the three dishes were also swept up by her, her appetite didn\u2019t lose out to a man.As soon as Nan Xun looked up, she saw Fu Mo\u2019s eyes smiling and couldn\u2019t help but brazenly turn red.\u201cThis\u2026 in fact, I don\u2019t usually eat so much. It\u2019s really delicious what you cooked.\u201d Nan Xun coughed softly and explained.Fu Mo\u2019s eyes were slightly bent, and he looked like he was in a good mood. \u201cYou like it.\u201d\u201cWhoever is your future girlfriend will be very happy.\u201d Nan Xun said casually. She thought later, this girlfriend would be herself, hehe.Fu Mo looked at her, his eyes burning. \u201cWould you like to be my girlfriend?\u201dNan Xun gargled and almost sprayed liquid from her mouth.She didn\u2019t expect the big boss to be so active and direct, which made her flattered.However, although she and Bai Xiye\u2019s relationship wasn\u2019t clear at that time, outsiders knew that her boyfriend has just passed away, so if she agreed. Wouldn\u2019t she be regarded as a slut?After such deliberation, Nan Xun\u2019s eyes suddenly darkened. She lowered her head slightly and said with a bitter smile, \u201cI\u2019m sorry Fu Mo, I can\u2019t like others now. My boyfriend just died.\u201d\u201c\u2026you seem to like him very much? \u201cNan Xun shook her head, \u201cI can\u2019t say how much I like, after all, we haven\u2019t been together for a long time, but he was really good, especially towards me. I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t forget him in such a short time.\u201dFu Mo dropped his eyes slightly, \u201c\u2026oh, yeah?\u201dThey didn\u2019t talk anymore, and the atmosphere was deadlocked for a while.Nan Xun\u2019s mind suddenly sounded with little eight\u2019s voice, \u201cWhy did you say that? Did you forget that he\u2019s your goal?\u201dNan Xun immediately replied: \u201cIf I promised right away, won\u2019t it appear that I\u2019m not reserved?\u201dThe void beast answered, \u201cI wish you good luck then~\u201dNan Xun didn\u2019t quite understand the meaning of this sentence.After the meal, before Nan Xun could speak, Fu Mo went to wash the dishes.Nan Xun sat in the living room watching TV, eating the apple that Fu Mo had peeled for her on the coffee table, and felt more and more that Fu Mo was a wonderful man.Fu Mo dried his hands and went back to the living room. He was still dressed in a white shirt, black trousers and leather shoes. There was no sweat on his white skin, which made Nan Xun feel very strange.The last time she saw him, he was the same. The snow-white shirt seemed to be spotless and not dirty.Moreover, since he moved in, he has been wearing that pair of shiny leather shoes, even in the house and didn\u2019t take them off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Who didn\u2019t have one or two quirks.Fu Mo smiled and didn\u2019t speak.After dinner, Nan Xun continued to watch the palace drama on the sofa, and Fu Mo dragged himself to the ground then sat down.Nan Xun had an illusion. As soon as he came over, a small portion of air around her becomes fresh and comfortable without the dryness of summer.Nan Xun handed him the remote control and asked him to change it to his favorite channel.Fu Mo shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t like watching TV very much. You can watch what you like, and I\u2019ll watch with you.\u201dNan Xun continued to watch.Watching, Nan Xun suddenly feels sleepy.Fu Mo said with a smile, \u201cSleep on the sofa if you\u2019re sleepy. I\u2019ll wake you later.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s lips curved, \u201cThen you remember to wake me up later.\u201dFu Mo turns down the volume from the TV, looked down at the woman lying beside him and his cold eyes flashed with a hot madness.Then, his mouth hooked up a bit which contrasted against his eyes that had a trace of stubborn craziness and made him look treacherous.\u201cAh\u2014\u201d Nan Xun suddenly screamed and woke up from her dreams.Fu Mo still sat next to her and asked her with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Your face looks a bit ugly.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s face was pale. She looked at Fu Mo, her face was crying, \u201cI, I just had a nightmare! It was terrible!\u201dFu Mo said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, it\u2019s just a dream.\u201dNan Xun didn\u2019t expect that she would have nightmares in the daytime, but after seeing Fu Mo nearby, the creepiness she felt in her dream eased a bit.\u201cI dreamt about my ex-boyfriend, Bai Xiye. He asked me if he was handsome. Of course, he was handsome. Then, his face suddenly changed. It was his appearance from when he died. He was hit by a truck and his flesh and blood were all blurred. The most terrible thing was that he would keep asking me whether his face was handsome or not. I was so scared by him that I woke up!\u201dFu Mo patted her back and comforted: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, you were just thinking about that day and dreamt it. If you don\u2019t think about him, you\u2019ll be okay.\u201dNan Xun couldn\u2019t say clearly. Even if she occasionally thought of Bai Xiye, she felt guilty that she had implicated him, but it wasn\u2019t the same kind of feelings that Fu Mo thought.But now, she didn\u2019t dare to think about Bai Xiye again. No matter what she felt about him, she doesn\u2019t dare think about him anymore.\u201cGo back to sleep. I\u2019ll be by your side.\u201d Fu Mo said.Nan Xun shook her head. She just had a nightmare and didn\u2019t dare to sleep again.But Fu Mo insisted, \u201cBelieve me, you won\u2019t have any more nightmares.\u201dShe didn\u2019t know if the other party\u2019s sentence had a hypnotic effect. After listening to him, she felt sleepy again after hearing it.\u201cThen I\u2019ll sleep for a while. You remember to wake me.\u201d Nan Xun mumbled, then laid on the sofa to sleep.This time she slept soundly.Nan Xun swore to the sky that she really only wanted to sleep for half an hour. As a result, when she slept, she slept like a pig. By the time she woke up, it was evening.As soon as she opened her eyes, she saw Fu Mo\u2019s enlarged face, which was white, smooth, delicate and handsome.\u201cYou slept so well that your saliva flowed onto my lap.\u201d Fu Mo said.The smile in his eyes seemed to be magical, it made people easily sink into it.Nan Xun listened to this, got up quickly and hurriedly wiped her mouth, but found nothing.What the fuck, this person was actually joking!\u201cDid I sleep for a long time? Why didn\u2019t you wake me?\u201d Nan Xun lightly changed the topic.Fu Mo\u2019s soft eyes fell on her ruddy face and said, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to wake you up because you slept well.\u201dHe slightly paused then added, \u201cYou looked so cute while you\u2019re asleep.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s face turned completely red because of him. For the first time, she heard people praise her for being cute and felt embarrassed.Fuck, was the big boss flirting with her?But how can he tease her so seriously? If his expression was a little bit indecent, she would have definitely slap him across the face, but now Fu Mo\u2019s expression was so serious that she really couldn\u2019t do it!Nan Xun felt that she needed to be more sober and awake. She just woke up and was a bit confused and couldn\u2019t think well.After Nan Xun washed her face with cold water, she saw Fu Mo standing in front of the white piano in the living room.It was a very gorgeous piano, the sun shone through the window and fell on the black and white keys which caused the cold texture to have a bit of warmth.Nan Xun went to Fu Mo and explained, \u201cIt was left by the landlord. It\u2019s strange that she would have moved away and left something as valuable as the piano behind. I don\u2019t know why she left it. Originally, I wanted to move the piano to a different spot, but it was heavy, and I couldn\u2019t move it.\u201dFu Mo listened to this, his eyes narrowed slightly and fell onto the piano stool that stood in front of the piano stand as if he was looking at something.\u201cActually, this piano is also very good here. I just feel it makes it a little dark and makes the living room look dark.\u201d Nan Xun said.When Fu Mo heard this, he immediately said, \u201cWhere do you want to move it, I will help you.\u201dNan Xun smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m getting a big bargain with you as my roommate.\u201dFu Mo easily lifted the piano and moved it to Nan Xun\u2019s designated spot in the living room. This freed up the entire window and the sunlight poured in from the big window, sprinkling sunshine all over the place.Although it\u2019s still summer, the location on this side caused the entire small building to receive very little sunlight, so the light that entered the house wasn\u2019t blazing, but warm.Nan Xun quickly moved the sofa forward, so that while she slept, the sun would hit her face and body, she felt comfortable just thinking of it.After Fu Mo moved the piano, he looked down at it slightly. Nan Xun thought he was interested in the piano, so she went to him and looked at the piano with him. She smiled and asked, \u201cCan you play the piano?\u201dFu Mo nodded, \u201cJust, I haven\u2019t played for a long time.\u201dNan Xun said in her heart, also, this older sister is level 10 on the piano, I don\u2019t know who has the better skill out of the both of us.However, Nan Xun didn\u2019t dare to set herself up to fall into ruins. Nan Xun could play the piano, but she shook her head when Fu Mo asked if she could.\u201cThis kind of thing is too luxurious for me.\u201d Nan Xun sighed, and her expression was somewhat lost.Little eight clapped as usual, \u201cDarling, your acting skills are getting better and better. Look at that lost little expression that completely portrays the image of a poor family girl who doesn\u2019t dare to think or ask for anything.\u201dNan Xun directly took little eight\u2019s words as a gust in the wind that blew passed her.\u201cMo Mo, do you want to learn? I can teach you.\u201d Fu Mo looked down at Nan Xun and his voice was extremely low at this moment, as if with a hint of temptation.Nan Xun looked up at him and saw a pair of deep, black eyes.Nan Xun\u2019s heart thumped abruptly and immediately said to little eight, \u201cI\u2019m more and more confident that Fu Mo is flirting with me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You don\u2019t have to take the initiative, the big boss has taken the initiative and is at your door.\u201dHappiness came too fast, Nan Xun almost couldn\u2019t hold back the curvature on the corner of her mouth. It\u2019s really a good feeling that this kind of boss actively engages her instead of her trying her best to brush the other\u2019s feelings.No, no, she should be more reserved and can\u2019t smile.\u201cFu Mo, won\u2019t it be too late for me to learn now?\u201d Nan Xun asked.Fu Mo\u2019s dark eyes revealed a light smile and his tone became very soft. \u201cIt\u2019s not too late, you\u2019re a smart girl.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s face turned red again.Fuck, how much can Fu Mo tease her, sooner or later she\u2019ll have to break his deed.Fu Mo didn\u2019t say anything else. He sat down on the piano chair, then patted the space next to him, indicating that Nan Xun should sit beside him.Nan Xun sat in the spot with reserved hands and didn\u2019t know where to place them.Unprepared, Fu Mo raised his hand and played the piano.Nan Xun noticed that his fingers were slender and beautiful, and his hands danced flexibly on the keys. It seemed that flowers were blooming, and its fragrance would be intoxicating. The sound of the piano fell slowly from low to high. The melody was beautiful and melodious.Nan Xun was fascinated. She didn\u2019t expect Fu Mo\u2019s piano skills to be so good.At the end of the song, Nan Xun was still immersed and dazed.\u201cGreat.\u201d Nan Xun praised.\u201cCome, Mo Mo, give me your hand.\u201d Fu Mo suddenly reached out to her.Nan Xun was stupefied for a moment and handed her left hand to him.\u201cTwo hands.\u201d Fu Mo softly reminded.Then the moe1 Nan Xun handed him her other hand.Fu Mo\u2019s right arm looped around her armpit, almost encircling her in his arms, but she wasn\u2019t touched by the gentleman.Then, he carefully unfolded Nan Xun\u2019s fingers one by one, slowly covered them with his big palms and interlaced them one by one with his fingers until they overlapped.His body temperature was lower than ordinary people, it was a little cold.The coolness from his ten fingers that connected the two people, ran through her body which made her shudder.\u201cMo Mo, follow me to experience.\u201d Fu Mo whispered.Nan Xun answered yes, then in the next moment, she felt her ten fingers slowly following along with Fu Mo\u2019s ten fingers.He deliberately slowed down and the sound from the piano that was lively became low and unhurried.The two people played together, and Nan Xun suddenly felt a burning gaze on the side of her face.She glanced at him, she didn\u2019t know when Fu Mo turned his head to look at her but his eyes were mixed with a chilling fanaticism.Nan Xun was shocked, but when she looked carefully again, there was only a faint smile in his eyes, which gave a very comfortable feeling. It seemed that the glance just now was her illusion.Nan Xun recalled the sight she had just seen. Suddenly she was a little flustered. She got up from the piano stool and chuckled at Fu Mo: \u201cIt\u2019s late, Fu Mo, I\u2019m going to cook. Do you want porridge? Let me cook some porridge.\u201dThen she hurried into the kitchen.As soon as she ran into the kitchen, the void beast\u2019s voice began to ring, \u201cCongratulations, the evil value has dropped to 80.\u201d\u201cWhat? So fast? Compared to the previous world\u2019s Demon King, this is simply the speed of a rocket!\u201d Nan Xun wasn\u2019t happy.It seems that the other party really likes her.\u201cLittle eight, what did the big boss do while I was asleep for a few hours?\u201d Nan Xun asked.The void beast\u2019s answer left her very satisfied. \u201cHe was watching you and the love in his eyes were so strong that he couldn\u2019t wait to eat you into his belly.\u201dLittle eight\u2019s exaggerated answer pleased Nan Xun.After they left, Fu Mo sat quietly in front of the piano, his eyes were gloomy and his whole body gradually radiated a cold air.\u201cBy the way, Fu Mo!\u201d Nan Xun\u2019s small head suddenly protruded from the kitchen door. She looked at the man who seemed to have never moved from the same spot and reminded him. \u201cThere are many fruits in the refrigerator. If you\u2019re hungry, you can eat some to cushion your stomach first.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Fu Mo answered with a sentence, his whole body\u2019s cold and gloomy air was slowly restrained as he stood up.He suddenly slightly raised the corner of his mouth and smiled.It seemed that the pale pink lips were much redder than before. With that smile, they looked particularly enchanting. They were like the blood flowers on a grave, excluding a strong aroma of decay\u2026The night was heavy and thick, it was time to dream.While Nan Xun was asleep, she suddenly heard a dragging sound from the living room. It was like someone was dragging something heavy, but it was too heavy, and it scratched the ground hard.After a while, there was a piano sound, but it wasn\u2019t pleasant to hear and sounded harsh.Nan Xun frowned and said in her heart, was it Fu Mo? He made so much noise at night and didn\u2019t sleep.After muttering twice, Nan Xun was ready to get up and have a look, but when she thought about it, the noise of the piano suddenly stopped, and the living room becomes quiet again.So, Nan Xun didn\u2019t care and continued to sleep.In the dark lacquered living room, Fu Mo stared at the little girl sitting on the piano bench. She had moved the piano to its original position.The little girl was very cute. She sat on the piano bench and cried. She cried and her eyes shed two lines of blood and tears. \u201cMama, I was wrong. I will practice the piano well and won\u2019t go play anymore.\u201dShe cried and cried, then the little girl violently changed her face. Her face was deathly pale. She ferociously grimaced at Fu Mo and asked, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I play the piano? Why can\u2019t I play the piano? Why can\u2019t I play well? I practice for several hours every night so I can get better and better to play well, so my mama won\u2019t be angry\u2026\u201dFu Mo blinked and interrupted her words, \u201cYou\u2019re too noisy.\u201d\u201cMeddlesome, this is my place, you dare to provoke me!\u201d The little girl was angry and suddenly flew to Fu Mo.Fu Mo pinched her neck and said, \u201cLooking for death.\u201dThe little girl was greatly frightened and shouted, \u201cGrownup please spare me, I don\u2019t dare anymore.\u201d\u201cToo late.\u201d Fu Mo large hand lifted her.The little girl screamed, and her body shrank sharply, then he directly threw her into his mouth, rolled his throat and swallowed her.With a wave of Fu Mo\u2019s arm, the piano and piano bench flew and gently fell back to its original positions.Looking at the white piano that was sitting in the living room, Fu Mo suddenly thought about the situation of the two people sitting there and playing during the day.It stirred his heart and he sat down in front of the piano.Nan Xun was asleep when she heard the sound of the piano again, but this time it was pleasant, and it was a feast for her ears.Nan Xun listened attentively for a long time and finally determined that she wasn\u2019t dreaming. Someone was playing the piano in the living room.TL Note: lol\u2026too bad little eight wasn\u2019t exaggerating about him wanting to devour her at the spot, Nan Xun is kinda romantically dense for someone who brags about high EQ. Well this is our next cannon fodder victim that Nan Xun never met\u2026lolPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The moonlight outside the window was just right, the moonlight shone on the man\u2019s delicate side profile, it was white and transparent, as if he would melt in the moonlight at any time.Nan Xun stood quietly beside him, not disturbing him.Until the last note fell, Fu Mo looked over to her and whispered: \u201cDid it bother you?\u201dNan Xun shook her head and said with a smile: \u201cI have slept for a long time during the day, now I\u2019m not very sleepy. How about you? You can\u2019t sleep?\u201dFu Mo sighed. \u201cAt night, I have some insomnia.\u201d\u201cSo, then I will chat with you for a while.\u201d Nan Xun said.Fu Mo moved aside and patted the empty space beside him, \u201cMo Mo, you sit here.\u201dNan Xun sat beside him and looked at him sideways. Her eyes were dark and bright, full of water, covered with moonlight, rippling with stars. The ends of her black hair were loose and looked soft, which made people want to touch it.\u201cMo Mo, do you still want to learn the piano?\u201d Fu Mo asked.\u201cOkay.\u201d Nan Xun smiled.Fu Mo suddenly reached for her hand and got close to her, this time they touched.He placed Nan Xun within his arms, his arm went under her arm, and the back of his hand entwined down her arm to her palm and held it up.Nan Xun\u2019s body was stiff when his arms were around her.Even with the layer of clothing, you could feel how cold the man\u2019s body was. Especially now, his big palm gently passed under her arm and he held her hand up and the cold feeling still remained in her four limbs.She looked up at him and felt his face was more and more pale and almost transparent.\u201cMo Mo, concentrate.\u201d Fu Mo suddenly opened his mouth, and his voice rang softly in her ear. It seemed a little ethereal in the thick dark night.Nan Xun hurriedly concentrated to follow his rhythm.Nan Xun was glad that the whole building was only occupied by them. Otherwise, the neighbors will surely find someone who wasn\u2019t sleeping in the middle of the night but was instead interested in playing the piano.In fact, Nan Xun was worried about this problem before, but found out she had no neighbors that lived in the same building. Every night they heard the harsh sound of the piano and they were so scared that they moved out of the building one after the other.After playing the song three times, Nan Xun has already learned it, but she doesn\u2019t dare show it. When Fu Mo asked her to play alone, she struck it casually.\u201cMo Mo.\u201d Fu Mo suddenly called her.\u201cHuh?\u201d Nan Xun responded and looked at him.In the next moment, her eyes suddenly widened.Fu Mo\u2019s face magnified in front of her eyes, then a cold touch came from her lips and the seam was brushed by the tip of his tongue.Nan Xun\u2019s heart trembled and her face turned red like a monkey\u2019s ass.\u201cYou, you, you\u2026\u201d Nan Xun pointed at the man who took advantage of her, then ran away without saying a complete sentence.Nan Xun ran back to her bedroom, her face was blushed and dazed, and she quickly called little eight. \u201cLittle eight, little eight, just now the big boss was frivolous, and the problem is that I\u2019m unexpectedly not angry. Do you think that I\u2019m a red phoenix star moving the old tree to blossom?\u201dThis Fu Mo was too provocative for her to bear.The void beast yawned and replied, \u201cThis is a good thing, but let me tell you, what the fuck is the red phoenix star moving, just don\u2019t fall down.\u201dNan Xun was a little surprised. \u201cLittle eight, are you still the same little eight that I know? Isn\u2019t it because of life and death that I\u2019m not allowed to attack the strategic target?\u201dThe void beast happily replied, \u201cBecause I know that you\u2019re moving now, but soon you won\u2019t be able to move anymore.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Nan Xun thought that little eight\u2019s words were very meaningful, but a certain ball didn\u2019t say what was the hidden meaning of the sentence.Nan Xun patted her ass and left. In the living room, Fu Mo stared at his empty arms. Suddenly, his eyes became sinister and the hands on the keys curled.\u201cI still can\u2019t do it, but Mo Mo, I can\u2019t help it\u2026\u201d He whispered, a small red blood trail suddenly flowed down from his forehead, then more and more until it covered his whole face.He looked up again, his delicate and handsome face was crisscrossed with blood. There was a bloody hole on his forehead as if it been knocked off. The blood rushed out from the inside and fell along his gentle chin then landed on the black and white piano keys, it made a crisp drip drip sound\u2026Nan Xun, who almost blossomed flowers on the old tree, thought her face was still a little hot. She opened the bedroom window a little more. The half-opened window blew a wisp of breeze which brought in the fragrance of flowers in from the community.After the cold wind and the scent of flowers blew in from outside the window, Nan Xun\u2019s face wasn\u2019t so hot.She went back to bed and planned to sleep until dawn.In a daze, Nan Xun suddenly felt a chill coming. Under the soft and warm quilt, it slowly climbed up from the bottom of her feet and reached her thighs.The cold touch made Nan Xun\u2019s body tremble all over.Her body was taunt, and her breathing seemed to have stopped at this moment.She wanted to move but found that she couldn\u2019t move or make a sound. She could only breathe low and passively accept the joy brought by that thing.Nan Xun\u2019s heart beat violently, her mouth was wide opened and at last she cried out.\u201cAh\u2014\u201dNan Xun was like a carp that rolled then sat up, panting and sweating.Nan Xun looked around and saw nothing. It was just a dream.She couldn\u2019t laugh or cry. She didn\u2019t know whether this could be called a nightmare\u2026or a spring dream.The next day, Nan Xun\u2019s gaze on Fu Mo were very empty.Nan Xun, who didn\u2019t have a spring dream for hundreds of years, had one in less than two days after she met Fu Mo. She felt that she had indescribable thoughts on how to deal with Fu Mo.The two lived together for three days. Every day, Nan Xun bought food and paid Fu Mo to cook. Nan Xun had a good life as a rice worm, sitting and eating. As if in three days a tacit understanding was born.Fu Mo was very accommodating to her, never got angry with her. Nan Xun felt that she was being spoiled by him.Nan Xun thought that if the two continued to get along like this, her relationship with the big boss will become more and more intimate. After a little while longer, the big boss will raise the important matter of dating and she will be able to readily agree.At that time, as the closest person to the big boss, she would soon be able to eliminate his evil thoughts. Therefore, when Fu Mo proposed to leave on the fourth day, Nan Xun was completely confused.\u201cThere are some things in the old house. I may have to leave for a while.\u201d Fu Mo looked at her as if to say there were some things Nan Xun wouldn\u2019t understand from the depths of his eyes, surging like an undercurrent.Nan Xun suddenly asked, \u201cWhat would I do if you leave?\u201dFu Mo listened to this, looked at her for a moment, and suddenly smiled. His mouth was pulled up, his eyes were full of laughter, \u201cMo Mo I won\u2019t let you leave me, never.\u201dNan Xun listened to this, but somehow felt a little flustered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As expected, Fu Mo is the big boss with evil intentions worth 100 and even the ghosts are afraid of him.\u201dNan Xun thought of this and said flustered, \u201cNow that Fu Mo is gone, won\u2019t I meet that thing again?\u201dLittle eight coughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, you can try to stick to the big boss the entire time. With him, nothing dirty dares to approach you.\u201dNan Xun sighed, slumped on the sofa and looked at the empty room. It was quiet and suddenly lonely.If she was alone in the beginning, Nan Xun wouldn\u2019t have these kinds of feelings, but when the two people were together, Nan Xun would wait for food and drinks. She really had a leisure life. Fu Mo had a strong sense of existence and she wasn\u2019t used to his absence.Nan Xun used the three-day rent that he had given her before leaving and went to the supermarket to buy some food.That night, the cashier at the supermarket counted her money as usual and found two ming bi1 in it. She was almost scared to death. The person cried and said to others that she had received two ming bi. The manager scolded her for not having eyes and that she couldn\u2019t distinguish between ming bi and real money. The little girl was extremely wronged, and she received the money during the day and clearly saw it was real money.Nan Xun refilled the refrigerator and dragged herself onto the living room floor again.She looked up and across, she suddenly found that the room Fu Mo lived in wasn\u2019t closed and was left open with a gap.In the gap was darkness.Nan Xun stared at the door crack for a long time, and her heart jumped uncontrollably.This room was the one that Fu Mo lived in. It should be full of life. But at this time, Nan Xun looked at the dark door crack and felt that it was lifeless inside.She stood at the door and gently pushed the door open.When the door was pushed open, it emitted a subtle sound, which was magnified several times at that moment.Nan Xun suddenly panicked. \u201cLittle eight, do you think Fu Mo will leave something unseen inside? I suddenly feel that my heart is beating so fast.\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, this grandpa will cover for you. In the case there is something unseen, this grandpa will immediately block your five senses.\u201dSo, Nan Xun went in with confidence.Fu Mo doesn\u2019t seem to like any environment that was too bright. The light in the bedroom was dim and the curtains was pulled tightly shut, so there was no sunshine.The room was very tidied, and even the quilt was neatly folded, just like in the beginning, but\u2026Nan Xun reached out towards the table and felt a thin layer of dust.Nan Xun had an illusion, as if nothing in this room had been touched since Fu Mo moved in.But how was this possible?\u201cLittle eight, I didn\u2019t dream those three days. Was there a man named Fu Mo who had lived with me for these three days?\u201d Nan Xun quickly asked little eight.The void beast replied, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream.\u201dNan Xun was relieved. As for the dust in Fu Mo\u2019s room, Nan Xun thought that it was dustier in there.Although the big boss left, Nan Xun always thought about his evil value and whether she should find an excuse to take the initiative to come to his door.At this time, the landlord called and said that a little girl wanted to share the rent with her. Her rent would be halved, and she asked Nan Xun if she would like to.Nan Xun heard that she was asked if she would be willing. In fact, the landlord could make the decision to rent out to others. This was the landlord\u2019s house and the other party doesn\u2019t have to ask her.At this time, Nan Xun was very glad that the big boss had just moved out. Otherwise, it\u2019s not good for her to rent the house secretly to others and be discovered by the landlord.\u201cLittle eight, if I want to share rent with others in the future, I don\u2019t think I will have the opportunity to get along with the big boss alone.\u201d Nan Xun said.After a long time, the void beast replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, he will take the initiative to come to your door.\u201dNan Xun thought for a moment and said, \u201cI think I\u2019d better call Fu Mo and tell him that he has to live somewhere else.\u201dThe void beast said, \u201cNo need.\u201d He knows everything about you.Nan Xun groaned, \u201cStupid, I\u2019m looking for an opportunity to get in touch with Fu Mo.\u201dThe void beast: \u201c\u2026so smart, he will be very happy.\u201dNan Xun found the big boss phone number in her phone\u2019s contact list.Just after she dialed, Nan Xun was startled by the sudden song. It was her singing. When she sung at the bar, she liked to sing her favorite, <<secret love=\"\">>. The voice rang from the other end of the door behind her, it was a phone ringtone.</secret>This song should have been recorded live by someone at the spot. She even heard the sparse clapping sound at the end of the song.Nan Xun twisted her neck a little bit and looked at the bedroom she had just come out of.\u201cLittle eight, when I went in, I didn\u2019t see a mobile phone inside. Why is there a mobile phone ringtone coming from inside? It\u2019s the song I sang in the bar.\u201d Nan Xun felt something was strange.The void beast said, \u201cJust go in and have a look.\u201dThen Nan Xun pushed open the door and went in. She saw the phone lying on the corner of the table at a glance.The mobile phone\u2019s ringtone was still ringing, the screen was on, and the caller ID displayed \u201cMo Mo\u201d. The avatar was actually a photo of her sitting on the bar stool, holding the microphone and singing affectionately.Nan Xun was stunned. Did Fu Mo go to the bar where she sung?Little eight said that the big villain boss would like her first. Does this mean that he fell in love with her at first sight when he encountered her at the bar?Nan Xun was a little shy. When she thought about the big boss, she doesn\u2019t know when he sat in a corner to listen to her singing, and that he secretly liked her. She felt that her charm was too great.Nan Xun hung up the phone, and the screen on Fu Mo\u2019s mobile phone slowly darkened. She carefully carried Fu Mo\u2019s mobile phone into her pocket and decided to return it back to him now.Returning the mobile phone was a good excuse. Besides, Fu Mo would definitely be anxious when he finds out that his mobile phone is lost.Nan Xun pulled up Fu Mo\u2019s old house address given by him from her mobile phone. She saw the address and was a little surprised. She didn\u2019t expect that the old house that Fu Mo said he lived in was in the small town where she lived in when she was a child.She remembered that when she studied at that time, during summer vacation, she would wander around on a small broken bicycle and often passed by a villa. The villa was built in a luxurious style, with a large yard filled with lush flowers and plants.At that time, she couldn\u2019t help but take a look. Sometimes she would see a small shadow standing on the balcony on the second floor. She was facing the light and couldn\u2019t see the little boy who was hidden in the shadow of the curtain. But when she was in a good mood, she waved at him and then rode away on the small broken bicycle.Was that little boy Fu Mo?Nan Xun suddenly felt that this was fate.Ming bi \u2013 there\u2019s no English translations that I know of. Its fake paper money burned as an offering to the dead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The yard was full of flowers and plants. The second floor had a large floor to ceiling window. The light was pale yellow, and the plain white curtains were slightly swaying, but this time she didn\u2019t see a little boy standing behind the curtains.There was a distance between the villa and the town behind it. Usually, no one walks around here. It stood here in seclusion, as if isolated from everything around it.Nan Xun knocked at the gate, only then did she hear a squeak.When the door opened, a tall and upright man stood behind the door, hidden in the shadow. As always, he wore a white shirt and black trousers. At this moment, when he saw Nan Xun, his eyes were filled with a smile.\u201cMo Mo, why are you here?\u201d Fu Mo asked.Nan Xun shook his mobile phone and said with a smile. \u201cYou were too careless when you left. You didn\u2019t take your mobile phone with you. Now I\u2019m acting like a delivery boy to deliver your mobile phone.\u201d\u201cCome in, it\u2019s hot outside.\u201d Fu Mo said.Nan Xun entered the house and followed Fu Mo. She looked at the decoration in the living room, suddenly she had a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.Fu Mo went to the kitchen to pour water for her. Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help following him. She looked at Fu Mo\u2019s back and then at him. A layer of cold sweat seeped from her forehead.She remembered where she had seen it. When she was hypnotized by Dr. Li the psychologist, this was the door she saw in her dream, it was the same as the door to the house, and the scene in the door was exactly the same as what she saw now.And now\u2026Nan Xun looked at the man\u2019s back, saw him poured water slowly and turned around.Nan Xun\u2019s breathing was suddenly smothered.\u201cMo Mo, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you so sweaty?\u201d Fu Mo walked up to her and reached out to wipe.It wasn\u2019t the faceless person, it was Fu Mo.Nan Xun breathed a sigh of relief, but when Fu Mo approached, she took a step back unconsciously, avoiding his touch.Fu Mo saw her avoiding him, then his eyes became a little gloomy for a moment, but he quickly recovered himself as in the beginning.\u201cMo Mo, I\u2019m just worried about you.\u201d Fu Mo sighed.Nan Xun was too slow to get over it and couldn\u2019t help but curse herself in her heart.\u201cI\u2019m fine, maybe it\u2019s too hot outside.\u201d Nan Xun said quickly, then took the water from his hands and drank, gulu gulu.The man looked at her when she poured a big mouthful in her mouth. He didn\u2019t show any surprise at her heroic drinking method, instead there was a smile in his eyes.Nan Xun didn\u2019t leave at once but sat for a while shamelessly. Fu Mo turned on the TV, changed the channel to what she liked and watched TV with her for a while.Nan Xun didn\u2019t leave until it was a little late.\u201cFu Mo, I\u2019ll go first.\u201dFu Mo looked at her for a long time without speaking. After a long time, he said, \u201cMo Mo, I really want to swallow you into my stomach, so that we will never be separated.\u201dWhen he said this, his eyes smiled extremely strongly.Nan Xun rolled her eyes at him. \u201cI\u2019ll be angry if you tease me like this again.\u201dFu Mo laughed.Fu Mo sent Nan Xun to the door and didn\u2019t go out again. He looked at Nan Xun and said softly, \u201cMo Mo, you can call me at any time.\u201dNan Xun gave a light cough, \u201cAh, okay.\u201dJust as she stepped out of the villa door, the void beast appeared to report the good news, \u201cCongratulations, the evil value has dropped again, it is now at 75.\u201dNan Xun was very happy to hear that and had walked far away, she couldn\u2019t help but look back.There was no figure at the door. Nan Xun felt lost, but suddenly saw a man standing beside the white curtain that was gently rippling from the wind behind the floor to ceiling window on the second floor.It was Fu Mo.Nan Xun\u2019s mouth grinned, and the afterglow of the setting sun shone on her face. It was warm. She waved to the man behind the French window and smiled very brightly.Fu Mo\u2019s body was caged in the shadow of the curtain and his thin red lips were slightly hooked up.When she returned to the house, Nan Xun found that there was suddenly another person inside.The woman sitting on the sofa heard a sound, turned around to look at her, nodded slightly at her and said, \u201cHello, my name is Su Han, I\u2019m your new roommate.\u201dThe woman in front of her was about 25 or 26 years old. Her hair was short, and her features were average, her eyes were sharp, and her skin was wheat colored.Nan Xun didn\u2019t expect the other party to move in so fast. She just left the house and the new roommate just moved in.\u201cHello, my name is Bai Mo.\u201d Nan Xun held out her hand to her with a smile, then paused. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you.\u201dNan Xun soon learned that Su Han\u2019s full-time job was a police officer. No wonder she looked like she was well-trained.Nan Xun didn\u2019t know why Su Han wanted to suddenly rent here. She seemed to be investigating something recently.Su Han seemed to be a person who was not very capable of taking care of herself. Her three meals were basically called take-out, and even cleaning was done by calling an auntie to drop by at a specific time.Nan Xun was very surprised and asked little eight. \u201cAre all the police officers so rich?\u201dThe void beast: \u201cThe person herself is interested in exorcism. The Su family are a family of exorcists and have been an influential family for many generations. Her grandfather was famous as a grandmaster exorcist but Su Han is an exception, her yang was too great, and she wasn\u2019t able to open her eyes to see the supernatural.\u201dAs soon as Nan Xun heard that, her eyes towards Su Han suddenly were sparkling.Exorcist expert, ah, she was amazing, although Su Han wasn\u2019t, but her grandfather and many people in her family were.She saw that Su Han was about to order take-out again, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. She took the initiative and said, \u201cThree meals a day will be provided by me, but you wash the dishes.\u201dSu Han nodded quickly. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll buy a dishwasher later.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026The rich were really capricious.Nan Xun asked little eight, \u201cIn the next world, could you let me wear a child from a rich family?\u201dThe void beast thought for a moment and replied, \u201cOkay, should compensate.\u201dAt that time, Nan Xun didn\u2019t quite understand what little eight meant by \u201cshould compensate1.\u201dSoon after, she understood the essence of the two words and the only thing she thought was to make the bun-like little eight into a cake.Nan Xun and Su Han got along well with each other. At first, Su Han\u2019s attitude was still the same. Later, Nan Xun became her younger sister.Nan Xun also thought that Su Han was good, until she found out that Su Han was investigating her recently.Su Han wasn\u2019t embarrassed when it was discovered by her, but she explained seriously, \u201cMo Mo, have you heard? The death of Zhao Qilin and Bai Xiye looked like a car accident, but in fact it was all strange. Moreover, Dr. Li who was your psychiatrist and who was perfectly fine, abruptly and immediately became someone with a mental disorder.\u201dNan Xun thought of something. Her face changed a little, her mouth opened but she didn\u2019t speak.\u201cMo Mo, tell me honestly, have you already been in contact with it?\u201d Su Han\u2019s eyes suddenly became sharp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Would it be irritated if I told her? Although the thing hasn\u2019t followed me these days, I am still a little scared, always worried about when it will suddenly appear again.\u201dThe void beast calmly replied, \u201cSu Han is the child of fate in this world. How could she die so easily?\u201dNan Xun couldn\u2019t help but wonder, \u201cChild of fate? Is it the same as a protagonist in a novel?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible to comprehend it in that way.\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I see the child of fate in the last world?\u201d\u201cDear, it didn\u2019t matter who was the child of fate in the last world, anyway, would have died in that war.\u201d\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t you said that the child of fate wouldn\u2019t easily die?\u201d\u201cThat was a special case. Who would have expected that the Demon King would blow up his beast core and killed the child of fate as well.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cLittle eight, if I didn\u2019t come into these worlds, what would have happened to those villain bosses from those worlds?\u201dThe void beast answered: \u201cNaturally be killed by the child of fate.\u201dNan Xun said meaningfully, \u201cI see. You are competing against the child of fate for merits.\u201dThe void beast immediately explained: \u201cI\u2019m doing a good thing too. You know, if the child of fate is against the villain boss, the villain boss will be the one that will be killed at the end. But I only need to eliminate the evil value of the villain boss. Once the evil value of the villain boss is eliminated, the heavens will not need the child of fate to kill him. I am saving his life, oh~\u201dShe now knew that Su Han was the child of fate and had its halo, Nan Xun told her the strange things that happened to her during this period of time.Su Han was silent for a long time after she listened.She was already very certain that the thing was strong and was distorted with possessive desire towards Bai Mo. It wouldn\u2019t let anyone insult her, nor tolerate men approaching her.\u201cSu Han, why do you want to investigate these things?\u201d Nan Xun asked.Su Han answered coldly: \u201cI won\u2019t allow any criminal to go unpunished, no matter what it is.\u201dNan Xun thought: Su Han is a good police officer who serve the people with integrity. No wonder she was a child of fate.Su Han tied a bell to Nan Xun\u2019s hand and said, \u201cThis is a bell to ward off evil spirits. If there are evil spirits approaching, it will ring.\u201dNan Xun was scared and refused.Fuck, if this thing keeps ringing, she would be scared to death. It\u2019s better to know nothing than to know there was nothing that she could do.Su Han saw that she didn\u2019t want to live or die. She changed it into an amulet for her. \u201cThat ghost is too obsessed with you. He will definitely come to your door again. This amulet was made by my grandfather before he died. There are only two of them. This one is for you. You remember to keep it close to you. Don\u2019t leave. Today, I will go back home to get some exorcism items. Remember, no matter what happens, don\u2019t leave this room until I come back.\u201dNan Xun saw that she was very serious, and she nodded seriously in return. But she was curious. \u201cSu Han, if I don\u2019t leave this room, won\u2019t the ghost try to look for me?\u201dSu Han replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know this ghost\u2019s abilities, but since he dares to kill people, it certainly isn\u2019t simple. No matter what kind of ghost he is, once he leaves his source, his abilities would become weaker even if he is a difficult and powerful ghost. If he could leave his source and stay elsewhere for a long time, it must be attached to a certain medium.\u201d\u201cWhat is the source?\u201d Nan Xun asked.\u201cIt\u2019s the place where he lived all his life. There is the aura of his life, so the ghost aura will be the strongest there.\u201d\u201cMo Mo, apart from Bai Xiye, have you ever had a boyfriend before? Or, do you know who likes you, or the type that is fond of you?\u201d Su Han suddenly asked.Nan Xun replied innocently, \u201cI haven\u2019t been in love before, but I have received a lot of confessions and love letters, about twenty or thirty, but I can\u2019t remember who they were from.\u201dSu Han: \u2026Su Han left. Before she left, she stuck two pieces of talisman paper on the door. Nan Xun listened to her words. She didn\u2019t go out this day. She was alone on the sofa watching TV.When the phone rang, Nan Xun saw \u201cbig boss\u201d displayed on the caller ID and couldn\u2019t help but bend her mouth. She quickly picked up the phone and said, \u201cHello, Fu Mo.\u201d\u201cMo Mo, what are you doing?\u201d The voice at the other end of the phone was a little low but soft.Nan Xun almost already imagined that his deep eyes were smiling fully and looked especially sexy.\u201cI\u2019m at home. Su Han won\u2019t let me go out. By the way, Su Han is my new roommate. You know, she\u2019s very powerful, her Su family are exorcists!\u201dThe person on the other end of the line paused for a while, then asked, \u201cWhy won\u2019t she let you go out?\u201dNan Xun explained, \u201cSu Han said that I have something following me. If I don\u2019t go out, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cMo Mo, are you afraid?\u201dNan Xun replied, \u201cOf course I\u2019m afraid. If the average person encounters such a thing, won\u2019t most people be afraid of such things, right?\u201d It\u2019s just that she was afraid of the unknown, she wasn\u2019t afraid of ghosts knocking at her door while she was doing a shameful deed.The person on the other end of the phone was silent for a long time, to the point that Nan Xun thought that he was gone.\u201cFu Mo? Fu Mo?\u201d Nan Xun hurriedly called out twice.\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d The man answered.She doesn\u2019t know if it was her illusion, but Nan Xun felt that Fu Mo\u2019s voice became a little cold. The cold feeling even reached her through the other end of her cellphone which made her ears trembled.The two chatted for a while before they hung up.Nan Xun hurriedly asked little eight, \u201cWhat did I said to make Fu Mo so unhappy? Why do I think he was a little absent-minded?\u201dLittle eight answered, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dWhen Su Han returned, she brought back some strange things to Nan Xun, such as a bronze mirror, a small bag of glutinous rice, a peach-wood sword, incense ash and talisman paper.Su Han sprinkled glutinous rice on the crack of the door and the windowsill, the incense was sprinkled on the floor and the bronze mirror was placed on a table facing the door.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that this is the legendary magic mirror?\u201d Nan Xun asked.Su Han glanced at her and explained: \u201cIt\u2019s an exorcism mirror from my Su family\u2019s ancestry. After my grandfather died, it was passed onto my father. Unfortunately, my father is a businessman and wasn\u2019t interested in the things handed down by my grandfather. Although I\u2019m interested, I don\u2019t have my grandfather\u2019s talent and can\u2019t open my eyes to see the supernatural.\u201dNan Xun heard a trace of regret from her words.Because of curiosity, Nan Xun stood in front of the exorcism mirror and looked at it, \u201cStrange, why do I feel that there is a black aura on my body?\u201dWhen Su Han heard this, her expression suddenly changed, and she quickly looked into the mirror and saw that Nan Xun was covered with a faint ghostly aura.\u201cMo Mo, have you been in contact with that thing recently?\u201d Su Han\u2019s voice sank.Nan Xun\u2019s face was muddled. \u201cNo, you have been with me these days. Today, I also listened to you and didn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You must have had contact with that ghost these days!\u201dAfter thinking about it, she suddenly asked: \u201cMo Mo, these days, you seem to call someone every day. Who is that person?\u201dNan Xun immediately understood Su Han\u2019s meaning and her face became pale. \u201cIt\u2019s Fu Mo, I met him a few days ago and he\u2019s a very good person.\u201dSu Han sneered. \u201cNo wonder, when I first arrived, I felt that there was a strong ghost in this room.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cMo Mo, give me your cell phone.\u201d Su Han said.Nan Xun\u2019s hands were shaking when she touched her cell phone from her pocket.Su Han placed the cellphone in front of the exorcism mirror and saw that it was fully entangled with a very strong ghostly aura.Nan Xun also saw that there was a lot of blackness on the phone.Su Han asked Nan Xun what was Fu Mo\u2019s phone number and Nan Xun showed her.Su Han immediately made a phone call and it seemed she had someone investigate the phone number.This process wasn\u2019t long, and soon the other party sent the photo of the owner of the cell phone number.Su Han looked up at Nan Xun and showed her the photo on her mobile phone. \u201cWas this the person you were talking about?\u201dNan Xun took a close look and was stunned. After seeing the photo from the ID card, she was scared. \u201cHow can this be?\u201dSu Han faintly said: \u201cThe owner of this mobile phone number was Fu Yu, the CEO of the emerging company Si Mo Corporation. He died in a car accident a month ago.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s eyes widened sharply. \u201cWho? Who are you talking about? Fu Yu!\u201dAfter Su Han heard that Fu Yu was a fellow high school student with Bai Mo, she gave her a meaningful look. \u201cThis dead person named Fu Yu was your fellow senior high school classmate? Since he was your high school classmate, how come you didn\u2019t know how he looked like now?\u201dNan Xun said with a pale face: \u201cIn high school, he had long hair, his eyes and forehead was covered. I really didn\u2019t know how he looked like.\u201d\u201cMo Mo, according to your previous statement, you lived with a ghost for three days and didn\u2019t know?\u201dNan Xun swallowed hard. \u201cI think they might not be the same person. Fu Mo was completely different from the Fu Yu in my memories.\u201dSu Han laughed. \u201cI believe you, maybe they\u2019re twins.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u2026Su Han solemnly said, \u201cMo Mo, since you are so convinced that they are not the same person, let\u2019s visit Fu Mo for now.\u201dNan Xun said to herself, \u201cI, us? Am I going too? Er\u2026Su Han, can\u2019t you see that it\u2019s dark right now, why don\u2019t we go tomorrow? Or why don\u2019t you go by yourself?\u201dSu Han\u2019s eyes were on her and leaned on her, \u201cMo Mo, I need you to lead the way.\u201dNan Xun pleaded with her but ended up taking her to the old house she had visited not too long ago.But when Nan Xun saw the old house again, she opened her mouth in surprise.The old house was completely different from the daytime. The flowers and plants in the yard have been withered because they haven\u2019t been taken care of for a long time. The white curtain on the second floor was barely moving and made the whole house looked less angry.Nan Xun swallowed and knocked at the gate.It was quiet all around and there was no sound in the night except for her knock.\u201cFu Mo, it\u2019s me, Bai Mo. Are you home?\u201d Nan Xun shouted at the door.Still no one responded.Su Han couldn\u2019t wait, and directly ran up the wall of the courtyard, and successfully jumped over the wall.Then she opened the door for Nan Xun.Nan Xun: \u2026Su Han opened the gate for Nan Xun from the inside and they went in, one by one.Su Han turned on the light at the door and Nan Xun was stunned by the scene inside.It was still the same familiar place, but there was the smell of dust floating in the room. You could feel a layer of dust on the table with a touch.It looked as if it hasn\u2019t been occupied for at least a month.Su Han\u2019s courage was very big, she walked in front and Nan Xun closely followed her.She didn\u2019t know if she was too nervous, but Nan Xun felt that there was someone following behind her. The footsteps were superimposed with her footsteps.She didn\u2019t dare look back.They went up to the second floor into Fu Yu\u2019s bedroom.It seemed that the bedroom items hadn\u2019t moved since Fu Yu\u2019s death, except it was covered in a layer of dust. Fu Yu seemed to have an obsessive-compulsive disorder, everything was arranged neatly.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes fell on a photo frame on the bedside table.In the photo was a girl, dressed in a loose high school uniform, lying on a meadow, with her ponytail resting on her arms and her right leg over her left leg. She looked lazy and wanton. A high school Chinese book covered her face and the sun was very bright. There was a bunch of trees behind her. Through the lush foliage, the dazzling light was broken into star-studded shapes from the branches and leaves and fell on her.This photo was very artistic and very beautiful.But as soon as Nan Xun saw the ugly school uniform, she knew that the girl was an alumnus from her high school.She just looked at the photo dazedly, then Su Han patted her shoulder and scared her to death.\u201cMo Mo, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go back.\u201d Su Han said with a dignified face.Nan Xun\u2019s mind was very chaotic. Naturally, she will do whatever Su Han says.When they left, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but look back.At the sight, Nan Xun\u2019s eyes suddenly widened.On the second floor, at the floor-to-ceiling window, a man stood beside the white curtain that gently rippled from the wind.Nan Xun\u2019s face turned pale.However, when Nan Xun looked closely, the figure disappeared.Nan Xun stepped forward and slammed into Su Han, who was walking in front of her.At this moment, Nan Xun suddenly thought of a lot of things. For example, who was the girl in Fu Yu\u2019s bedroom photo? Come on, in junior high school, ah, Bai Mo\u2019s face was blocked, and she didn\u2019t see it at first.Fu Mo and Fu Yu were the same person. Fu Yu\u2019s crush was her and Fu Mo likes her and even asked if she wanted to be his girlfriend. Su Han said that the person who was Fu Mo didn\u2019t exist. Little eight said that Fu Mo was the villainous boss and had a blackening value of 100 and evil value of 100 and that the villain boss likes her\u2026All of this revealed the answer Nan Xun wanted.After they went back, they sat on the sofa. Because they had some concerns, they were silent.Nan Xun didn\u2019t expect that when she rarely has a good impression of someone, that person wouldn\u2019t be a person, but a ghost.This was really\u2026hahahaha.Su Han suddenly stood up. \u201cMo Mo, I\u2019m going to Lingyin Temple to ask Master Wu Chen to come out of the mountain. Recently, fierce ghosts have been rampant, and the ghost aura is very strong. We can\u2019t let these things run rampant anymore.\u201dNan Xun opened her mouth and dryly said, \u201cWhat master exorcist? Do you want to deal with Fu Yu? But Fu Yu might not be a bad ghost\u2026\u201d\u201cBai Mo! Are you pleading on behalf of a ghost?\u201d Su Han\u2019s face suddenly sank.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She asked little eight in her heart, \u201cIf the child of fate encounters the big villain boss, would the big boss be killed by her?\u201dThe void beast calmly replied, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, because of your intervention, the fierce ghost boss is several times more powerful than the original Fu Yu. Even if grandmaster Wu Chen comes, he won\u2019t be afraid.\u201dWhen Nan Xun heard this, she sighed and was a little relieved, but soon she thought of something and her face darkened, \u201cLittle eight, what are you hiding from me?\u201d Her voice suddenly rose, \u201cYou especially want me to fuck a ghost?!\u201dNan Xun almost cried out, \u201cHow could you let a ghost fall in love with me? Thank you, come on, I really don\u2019t need it!\u201dAfter pretending to be dead for a while, the void beast finally said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you understand this grandpa\u2019s good intentions? It\u2019s not easy for this grandpa to find a world that meets your conditions. Ah, although he\u2019s a ghost, he likes you. Do you like it or not? Besides, he has long legs and can cook, isn\u2019t this what you like ~\u201dNan Xun wanted to slap him to death no matter how he explained himself.The next morning, Su Han left. Nan Xun yawned and went to the bathroom to wash.\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201d Nan Xun stared at her neck in the mirror and found a red strawberry mark.She was most familiar with this kind of mark. In the last world, the Demon King flipped pancakes and planted strawberries on her every day.\u201cLittle eight, what happened last night?\u201d Nan Xun asked in a trembling voice.The void beast replied, \u201cNo, you don\u2019t want to think about it too much.\u201d\u201cBut my arm is also a little sore. As a matter of fact, is it possible that it\u2019s sleep paralysis? Little eight, tell me honestly, did the big fierce ghost boss followed me?\u201dThe void beast paused for a while and then said, \u201c\u2026no.\u201d\u201cThen, why did you pause?\u201d\u201cI was just thinking about something else.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201c\u2026Really.\u201dAlthough little eight said so, Nan Xun was still uneasy and observed for a long time. There were no passive traces from the sticky rice in the door cracks and windowsills, and there were no strange footprints in the ashes on the ground. Nan Xun was relieved.Now that she knows that the big boss won\u2019t have an accident and there was only one person left in the house, Nan Xun begun to let herself go.The white piano was still placed in the old position in the living room. Nan Xun likes Fu Mo very much. Oh no, it should be said that Fu Yu taught her this song. She\u2019s itching to play a complete song for a long time but couldn\u2019t since Su Han had been here the entire time. In order not to collapse her image, she has been reluctant to touch it.Now, she was sitting on the piano stool. Her long, white fingers moved flexibly on the black and white keys. When she was taught by Fu Mo, she always felt half strange. The sweet music from the piano and Nan Xun\u2019s singing danced and leaped in the room, which made it cheerful.The void beast: \u201cYou\u2026oh, forget it.\u201d\u201cThere are no outsiders here. If people arranged to collapse, they will collapse.\u201d Nan Xun didn\u2019t consider thoroughly.The void beast: \u2026There was no one, but there was a malicious spirit. Laozi didn\u2019t tell you, Laozi was afraid to scare you.It\u2019s just that when Nan Xun showed her \u201ctrue temperament\u201d, the nearby ghost\u2019s evil value fell.Nan Xun was tired of playing, she laid on the sofa and took a nap, but slept unconsciously.When she woke up, it was already time for dinner. Nan Xun yawned and looked at the blanket that covered her. The whole person was confused.\u201cLittle eight, when I fell asleep, did I cover myself with a blanket?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cIf you feel a little cold in your sleep, you will get up and cover yourself.\u201dNan Xun was suspicious, \u201cReally?\u201dThe void beast replied firmly: \u201cReally.\u201dNan Xun sighed, got up and cooked dinner.Today, she didn\u2019t go out and didn\u2019t buy anything, so the refrigerator was empty. Nan Xun planned to go shopping at the supermarket tomorrow.After dinner, Nan Xun watch TV on the sofa for a while, then went to the bathroom to take a bath.She didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion. But when she entered the bathroom, she felt a cold wind blowing in.\u201cLittle eight, how is there a gust of wind?\u201d\u201cProbably because there was a change in the weather. Well, go wash, I will immediately block my five senses.\u201dWhen Nan Xun undressed, the feeling of being surrounded by the cool wind became clearer.Was she really thinking too much?Nan Xun felt a little cold and couldn\u2019t help but turn the water heater up two gears.When she washed her hair, Nan Xun suddenly found that she had forgotten to bring a towel. The foam from the shampoo went into her eyes and made them spicy. Nan Xun hurriedly reached out to find a towel on the shelf.The process of reaching the towel was smoother than she expected. As soon as she reached the shelf, she felt the towel, as if someone had handed it to her.That night, Nan Xun had a dream.When she was in her second year of high school, she still had a childlike face. After school, she carried her schoolbag and planned to directly go to the hospital to see Bai Mo\u2019s mom.\u201cSon of a bitch, take out all your money to show respect to this young grandpa!\u201d1Nan Xun heard the sound and saw several ruffians that stopped a little boy to ask for money.Nan Xun was in a hurry to go to the hospital and didn\u2019t want to meddle, but she saw the person wearing their school uniform and the boy\u2019s iconic long bangs, it quickly reminded her of the \u201cinvisible man\u201d from her class.The little boy lowered his head and pulled out the money from his pocket.The gangster laughed, \u201cWhat a good grandson, that\u2019s right. However, Laozi has long seen that you\u2019re not pleasing to the eye. Why were you born in a rich family! Hit, hit him!\u201dWithin a few moments, the little boy was beaten miserably.Nan Xun was so angry that she saw fire and directly pulled up her sleeves and went into the scaffold.The few small gangsters were dumbfounded. They didn\u2019t expect that the little beauty in front of them would be fiercer than a boy in a fight. With long legs sweeping and punches, she beat the gangster\u2019s head to the ground with a fist.\u201cFuck!\u201d The leader of the gang spat on the ground and didn\u2019t care what mercy was. He called several brothers and surrounded her.Nan Xun was punched in the face and kicked on her ass, but the three gangsters were beaten black and blue by her.\u201cI\u2019ve already photographed the scene of your robbery with my cell phone. If you don\u2019t want to eat a hard-boiled meal in prison, go see my grandmother and take a detour!\u201d Nan Xun glared at the few small gangsters.Of course, this was a bluff. At that time, Bai Mo was so poor that she couldn\u2019t afford a cell phone.But the gangsters got up and ran away.Nan Xun touched her face and hissed with pain. She looked back at the little boy, walked over to pat him on the shoulder and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, this sister will cover for you later.\u201d\u2026\u2026At that time, Nan Xun just wanted him to not be afraid. She didn\u2019t have any confidence. But what about that little boy? Has he always thought of it in his heart this entire time?When she woke up, Nan Xun was still sore and sour. She looked in the mirror and saw some red and purple strawberries on her neck.Nan Xun paused for a moment, then continued to brush her teeth and wash her face as if nothing had happened.The void beast compiled a list of reasons to deceive: \u2026Does she know? Or\u2026still don\u2019t?The void beast was a little panicked: This, this was too calm, wow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was in the scorching sun but didn\u2019t feel the heat at all. A cool breeze followed her the entire time like a shadow.Nan Xun\u2019s mood was a bit complicated.She dreamed of a lot of things in her dreams. It was about high school, and a little boy peeped at her with his hot eyes.She never knew that a person would have such a deep obsession with his crush which seemed almost morbid.The feeling of being loved should make her very happy, but the person who loved her was Fu Yu who was scary.Nan Xun turned on the TV and tuned it to one of her favorite channels. Originally, she wanted to watch the programs she liked more, she wanted to be spirited since she didn\u2019t want the sleepiness to come.Nan Xun knew that being so sleepy wasn\u2019t normal.She had another dream, this time the setting wasn\u2019t the high school.In the dream, she was wearing a white dress and was alone in the street with no one around.After a long walk, she finally saw a man, and then ran towards him.It was a man in a white shirt, he was tall, but his face wasn\u2019t clear. He gave a bunch of white chrysanthemums to Nan Xun.Nan Xun was stunned, subconsciously reached for it and said thank you.The man\u2019s face suddenly became clear. Nan Xun was scared and took a step back.It was Fu Yu!Fu Yu\u2019s mouth slightly pulled into a curve and looked at her eyes gently and dotingly. He said softly: \u201cMo Mo, this is the second time you accepted my flowers. If you accept them, it showed that you are willing to be my girlfriend. Mo Mo, I want you\u2026.\u201dAfter he finished, he kissed Nan Xun as soon as he bowed his head. At the same time, he used his hand to tear her clothes into pieces.Nan Xun was shocked, she didn\u2019t know that if she accepted flowers, it would mean she would become his girlfriend! And this was in public, although there was no one, but this was in the street, ah, the street, he actually stripped her!Her heart was in a panic and Nan Xun bit his mouth and pushed him away.Her eyes suddenly jerked opened. Nan Xun woke up, reached out and felt cold sweat.Nan Xun thought that the big fierce ghost boss was too much and he even molested her in her dreams.Nan Xun thought of the dream and was angry at the ghost who molested her on the street.She tucked the amulet that Su Han gave her under the pillow, which wasn\u2019t enough. She also placed Su Han\u2019s exorcism sword under the pillow.Su Han said that if she noticed an abnormal wind, she should stab it directly with the exorcism sword and guaranteed that the soul of the thing will be injured. Even if it wasn\u2019t injured badly, its ghostly powers would be greatly reduced.Of course, Nan Xun didn\u2019t want to deal with the big boss. She also wanted to eliminate the big boss\u2019 evil value but the big boss this time went too far and didn\u2019t even allow her to have a good night\u2019s sleep.However, Nan Xun thought she would have a good night\u2019s sleep, but still dreamed.This time, she was dressed in a snow-white wedding dress and was lying on a king-sized bed.Nan Xun hurriedly got up and went to the door. She found that there was no one in this luxurious European style castle.She dragged her long skirt and ran alone in the empty corridor, her high-heeled shoes made a tapping sound and she listened and was flustered.Afterwards, she finally ran out of the castle and found a long red line tied to her ring finger.The red line led her all the way forward and she slowly moved forward. After bypassing several rockeries, the red line finally reached the end. A diamond ring slipped from the other end of the red line to her ring finger and was firmly set on it.Then, a man came out of the rockery.He wore a snow-white shirt and his eyes looked at Nan Xun with a smile. He said softly, \u201cMo Mo, will you marry me?\u201dNan Xun looked at Fu Yu and blurted out, \u201cBut you\u2019re dead. How can I marry you?\u201dAs she spoke, she saw the smile in Fu Yu\u2019s eyes disappeared in a blink of an eye, and his eyes became gloomy. The delicate and handsome face changed in a flash. There was a big bloody hole in his forehead and the blood was flowing down from his forehead the entire time.Nan Xun\u2019s face changed greatly and she turned and ran.\u201cMo Mo, Mo Mo\u2026\u201d The man kept calling after her.\u201cAh\u2014\u201dAfter she shouted, Nan Xun suddenly opened her eyes.Come on, if she does this several times, she will definitely be debilitated by the big boss!Fortunately, it was all a dream.Nan Xun breathed heavily and thought to reach out to wipe the sweat from her forehead.However, at this moment, she suddenly found that she couldn\u2019t move!She didn\u2019t know when her pajamas had fallen to the ground and she was stripped naked.In the next moment, Nan Xun\u2019s eyes widened in horror, and she noticed that there was another person in the quilt.She felt a wet, cool touch on her legs.Fuck, it\u2019s true this time! It\u2019s not a dream!Nan Xun wanted to speak but found that her throat was blocked and couldn\u2019t speak a word.In the dark night, a big palm covered her eyes.As soon as it was dark, Nan Xun felt a coldness on her lips and the cold but blazing kiss made her breathless.In the silent night, the sound of water and gasps were interwoven, which were magnified several times in the coldness of the room\u2026At dawn, Nan Xun laid on the bed dead.She was disorientated for a long time, then went to get dressed and wash herself.The sword and amulet under her pillow have been broken into a powder.It didn\u2019t work! Not only that, but it angered him. Last night, he punished her for everything. She was afraid of all the blue and purple marks.He thought she was going to deal with him with all those broken things, so he got angry?\u201cLittle eight, I can\u2019t believe I was molested by a ghost.\u201d Nan Xun sighed in her heart.Should she be thankful that the big boss didn\u2019t continue on to the end?The void beast let loose a big sigh of relief. \u201cDear, da, you finally are willing at last, muwah, da1~\u201d\u201cLittle eight\u2026ah.\u201dThe void beast had a guilty conscious, \u201cCome on, don\u2019t be like that, I didn\u2019t mean to hide it from you. If I had said he followed you every day during this time, wouldn\u2019t you have been scared to death?\u201d\u201cCough, good news, after these days, the evil value of the big boss has been reduced to 45~\u201dNan Xun immediately corrected, \u201cWe weren\u2019t getting along, he was peeping!\u201dThe void beast faltered, \u201cWhether he peeps or not, it\u2019s a good thing that the evil value was reduced.\u201d\u201cLittle eight, I want to smash you into a meat patty, really.\u201dThe void beast: \u2026Da \u2013 the clatter of a horse\u2019s hoovesMuwah \u2013 my imitation of a kissing soundPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t know how much or how little to say. I don\u2019t even know what Fu Yu\u2019s wish is. If I fulfill his wish, won\u2019t the evil value be eliminated?\u201dThe void beast said: \u201cThe reason why people become fierce after death is because they had too much resentment, but the obsession is too heavy. His grievance is heavy, help him to obtain revenge so it can calm his resentment and obsession, so naturally help him fulfill his wish. I don\u2019t know what kind of big boss the malicious spirit is. Anyway, if he\u2019s in front of you, why don\u2019t you ask him personally?\u201dNan Xun thought about it and felt it was feasible. Although the ghost boss and herself were well aware, the layer of window paper hasn\u2019t been pierced. Now, it\u2019s time for a showdown. Moreover, if she continued, she will die.Nan Xun cleaned herself up and went to the living room.Nan Xun sat on the sofa and looked around for a week. Her expression was a bit complicated: \u201cFu Yu, I know you\u2019re here. I want to talk to you.\u201dThere was a gust of wind blowing inside the house.Nan Xun felt that the temperature of her whole body had dropped a lot.That ghost was in this room.\u201cFu Yu, I, I know now that you like me, thank you for liking me, really. My life has been miserable. My father was a drunkard. Later, he took the family money and left. Then, my mother died, leaving me alone and I never enjoy the taste of love, but you gave it to me. For example, if you have any unfulfilled wish, you can tell me, and I will help you fulfill it even if the oil pot is on the knife mountain1.\u201dAs soon as Nan Xun finished talking, there was a strong gust of wind in the room, so strong that all the small things on the table were blown up and fell back onto the ground.Nan Xun asked little eight quickly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What did I said wrong to provoke him?\u201dThe void beast said, \u201cYou can\u2019t guess the abnormal mind. You won\u2019t understand it even if you guessed.\u201dNan Xun swallowed her saliva and saw two rows of shoe prints on the ashes on the ground. It quickly extended to her side until it stopped besides her.Even if she couldn\u2019t see, she felt his gaze, cold and hot, so ambivalently mixed, and it ran straight down her body, leaving her nowhere to hide.Nan Xun\u2019s heart was beating violently. She could clearly feel that her earlobes were covered with a cold dampness. Then the gentle voice of the man rang in her ears.\u201cMo Mo, I don\u2019t want anything. I just want you. At eight o\u2019clock tonight, I\u2019ll wait for you at home\u2026. Mo Mo, you must come.\u201dAfter he said that, the gust of wind disappeared.Nan Xun was very flustered and asked little eight, \u201cWas the big boss asking me?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThen do you want me to go?\u201d\u201cGo, why not?\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m here.\u201dThe void beast continued to persuade: \u201cHave you forgotten our purpose? Don\u2019t we just need to eliminate the evil value of the big fierce ghost boss? People have said that all they want is you.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s heart was desolate. \u201cWhy do I have to fucking sacrifice myself every time to eliminate the evil value?\u201dThe void beast comforted her, \u201cIf only you were sacrificed, you will be able to purify the evil-minded villain boss in this world and save thousands of people. Wow, what a great and praiseworthy feat that is!\u201dNan Xun was not dazzled by its praise and analyzed rationally: \u201cI thought that for this big villain boss, I didn\u2019t have to be his lover, instead being a close relative is pretty good. Little eight, next time can I be the big boss\u2019 mother or grandmother, even his sister or daughter would be good.\u201dThe void beast thought about it and replied: \u201cIf we complete this mission, I will fulfill your requirements in the next world.\u201dFor the future happiness of the next world, Nan Xun summoned the courage to go to Fu Yu\u2019s old house alone.As dusk fell, darkness devoured the isolated old house.When she arrived at the old house, Nan Xun was still a little flustered. \u201cLittle eight, sing me a song. If you don\u2019t sing, I won\u2019t go in.\u201dThe void beast silently rolled its eyes and began to sing, \u201cArise, ye who refuse to be slaves! With our flesh and blood\u2026.\u201d2Nan Xun: \u2026When Su Han arrived at Lingyin Temple to find the grandmaster exorcist Wu Chen, the grandmaster was in seclusion. She waited for two days until he came out. Grandmaster Wu Chen shook his head when he knew of her intentions and said with only one sentence, \u201cThis ghost is too violent and obsessive. It can only be avoided and can\u2019t be provoked.\u201dSu Han\u2019s persuasion was to no avail and she returned first. But after she returned, she discovered that Bai Mo was gone, and Su Han\u2019s face suddenly changed.She knew that Bai Mo must have gone to Fu Yu\u2019s old house, but at this time, going to Fu Yu\u2019s old house was a trap!Did she know whether Fu Yu was no longer a human being, but a fierce ghost!A fierce ghost who was crazy enough and abnormal!Su Han grew more and more worried and rushed to Linyin Temple overnight.\u201cGrandmaster Wu Chen, this is a matter of life and death, it\u2019s very important. Please help me!\u201dGrandmaster Wu Chen was silent for a long time and finally sighed. \u201cCome on, everything has its own causes and consequences. I owed your grandfather a favor, now it\u2019s time to pay it back.\u201d\u2026The old house at night was hidden in the darkness, and there wasn\u2019t any light at all.Grandmaster Wu Chen looked at the house in front of him with a dignified appearance. \u201cThis place is full of evil aura. This ghost is much more worse than I\u2019ve imagined.\u201d\u201cThen, can the master deal with it?\u201d Su Han asked quickly. Since she was here to save people, naturally she can\u2019t let grandmaster Wu Chen leave.Grandmaster Wu Chen stirred the Buddha beads in his hand and lightly said, \u201cWe can try.\u201dThe house was still the same as last time, it was quiet, and no sound could be heard.\u201cSu Han, take the amulet and follow me closely.\u201d Grandmaster Wu Chen said.They slowly set foot on the stairs leading to the second floor.In the silence, they could only hear the footsteps of the two people going upstairs, which made people feel scared.Every two steps, grandmaster Wu Chen would place a piece of paper on both sides of the stairs. After five pairs were placed, his footsteps suddenly stopped.At this time, the two people were surrounded by a blowing wind.Su Han vaguely heard cries and laughter, which were intertwined with each other and strongly stimulated her eardrums.As soon as grandmaster Wu Chen heard, his face changed. He suddenly whispered, \u201cNo, there\u2019s a ghost gathering array here!\u201dAs soon as grandmaster Wu Chen\u2019s voice fell, Su Han, who was closely following behind him, screamed.Suddenly, a hand extended from the darkness and dragged Su Han\u2019s leg down.Grandmaster Wu Chen suddenly threw a piece of talisman paper from his hand behind Su Han. A shrill cry sounded and the ghost dragging Su Han suddenly turned into ashes.Su Han shook her dizzy head and stood up again.Grandmaster Wu Chen said in a deep voice: \u201cThere\u2019s a ghost gathering array here. The evil and dead spirits in the square are gathered, but I can\u2019t find the source of the array for now. Take this amulet, and if you meet the evil ghost from a sneak attack again, stick the amulet on the ghost.\u201dSu Han nodded and climbed back up by holding the stairs.The fierce ghost blocked them from going upstairs. She was absolutely sure now that Bai Mo was upstairs.She\u2019s in danger!Oil pot is on the knife mountain \u2013 achieve the goal no matter the difficultyThis is the Chinese national anthemPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Su Han firmly held the talisman in her hand and walked more carefully.Soon they will reach the second floor, the suppressed spirits were angry and became several times stronger and there was a constant cry around them.Su Han listened carefully and could hear a few words.\u201cI don\u2019t want to die, I don\u2019t want to die, give me your life, I want your life\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWuwuwu, wuwuwu, why didn\u2019t you save me, why didn\u2019t you save me, I\u2019m dead, you have to die\u2026\u201d\u201cI will kill you. Why didn\u2019t the police arrest them? Why! Obviously, you killed me\u2026\u201dSuddenly, there were countless faces over their heads, which emitted a rotten stench and they glared at them.Su Han saw the countless faces and was horrified. She saw Zhao Qilin and Bai Xiye who were the biggest faces!Numerous ghost faces gathered, in the position on the ceiling, like a huge array.Master Wu Chen calmly said: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, my talisman paper has the eight-trigram ghost array. These evil spirit and ghosts can\u2019t break this old man\u2019s array.\u201dHowever, just as grandmaster Wu Chen\u2019s voice fell, it seemed that the evil spirits and ghosts in the ghost gathering array weren\u2019t afraid and dived down together, and they all had their mouths open to bite them.As soon as grandmaster Wu Chen saw, his face changed, and he recited the Buddhist scriptures from his mouth.In the next moment, the talisman paper that was pasted nearby which didn\u2019t moved from the wind, suddenly rose automatically and flew towards the evil spirits who dived towards them.The talismans fell on the faces of the evil spirit and immediately ignited them mid-air. The fire grew more redder and fiercer than normal fires. This raging fire consumed the entire ceiling above them and trapped the evil spirits within.The evil spirits made a sharp scream which was more shrill and louder than the last.Su Han saw these evil spirits turn into ashes from the fire.When all the evil spirits were gone, the burning talisman paper turned black and fell.Su Han breathed a big sigh of relief. \u201cMaster, are all these evil spirits gone?\u201dGrandmaster Wu Chen nodded and suddenly there was blood that spilled from the corner of his mouth.Su Han cried out in fear, \u201cMaster!\u201dGrandmaster Wu Chen waved at her, \u201cNo problem, I didn\u2019t expect this ghost gathering array to be so powerful, so I spent a lot of energy.\u201dSu Han felt a little guilty, pondered for a while and said with difficulty: \u201cMaster, if you can\u2019t\u2026let\u2019s give up.\u201dGrandmaster Wu Chen shook his head. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t come here, but now that I\u2019m here, I must save people from that fierce ghost.\u201dThe two finally arrived at the second floor, to the last door.Master Wu Chen bit his finger, drew a Buddhist character on the door, and patted the door open with one palm.Su Han rushed in after grandmaster Wu Chen.The room wasn\u2019t dark as she had imagined. The moon was very bright tonight. The silver light came in from the window and covered everything in the room in a hazy veil.There was a man sitting by the bed, his back faced the two and looked down at the woman on the bed.On the big bed, a woman laid in the middle, her surroundings were full of all sorts of strange blood characters, a row of candles which emitted a green light and formed a circle around her. The green light shone on the woman\u2019s beautiful face which was blue and pale.The woman looked serene and\u2026 dead.Su Han\u2019s eyes suddenly sank.It\u2019s Bai Mo!Grandmaster Wu Chen grabbed Su Han who wanted to move forward and looked at the man in front of him\u2026. or the male ghost.At this moment, the man slowly turned his head.He wore a white snow-colored shirt, although his face was a little blue and pale, he still looked delicate and beautiful. The corners of his mouth picked up into a smile, his eyes were silent, cold and deep. \u201cWhat a bunch of waste, let you come up so soon.\u201d\u201cFu Yu! What did you do to Mo Mo?\u201d Su Han said angrily.Fu Yu\u2019s mouth was lightly hooked and smiled happily. \u201cMo Mo is very good now. She will soon be with me forever.\u201d\u201cHow would you be together? Do you want to turn her into a fierce ghost like you!\u201d Su Han\u2019s hand was clenched into a fist.Fu Yu slightly tilt his head and said with some unhappiness. \u201cGhost? No, how could I give up? I just want to turn Mo Mo into a puppet that has flesh and blood that won\u2019t rot and die. She won\u2019t be a dead puppet, she\u2019ll be a puppet with flesh and blood, with her own consciousness. But\u2014 I need to kill her first, and then seal her soul in this corpse, so that she can stay with me forever, it\u2019s really good.\u201dSu Han\u2019s heart was shocked. \u201cForever? That\u2019s ridiculous! Have you ever thought that once Mo Mo becomes a puppet if it would be the same as the previous Mo Mo? Even if she had her own consciousness, would she laugh? Jump? She would no longer feel her heartbeat, won\u2019t have a temperature, she won\u2019t be happy, she would only hate you!\u201dSu Han smelled the pungent odor of blood. She saw that Bai Mo\u2019s two wrist were bleeding!This devil was going to kill Mo Mo!Fu Yu\u2019s gaze became ferocious, but his mouth once again curved.He greedily looked at the woman in the blood array and softly said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? As long as she can always be with me, even if she hates me, I don\u2019t care.\u201d There was a trace of sweetness and satisfaction in his words.After that, he said happily: \u201cI felt very reluctant to die before, but now I\u2019m very happy. Now, Mo Mo will accompany me every day, I will watch her smile and enjoy her privately. Do you know how lovely she is? I didn\u2019t even know before.\u201d\u201cThis feeling is so wonderful. I\u2019ve never been so satisfied. But\u2013\u201dHis voice suddenly changed, it was cold and piercing, \u201cWhy are there so many annoying people in the world? Why does so many people hate it? Don\u2019t say what shouldn\u2019t be said, let alone what shouldn\u2019t be thought of, otherwise, I will be very angry.\u201dSu Han\u2019s heart felt cold, \u201cSo, because of this ridiculous reason, you killed two innocent people and turned a psychiatrist into a mentally ill person?\u201dNow, even his most beloved woman, he wants to kill!\u201cSu Han, I\u2019m not happy that you came here today and brought this old bald donkey to interrupt Mo Mo\u2019s ceremony.\u201d Fu Yu\u2019s tone was very gentle, but his eyes grew colder.At the moment that Su Han and Fu Yu were talking, grandmaster Wu Chen was almost recovered. He blocked Su Han behind him, looked at the fierce ghost in front of him and placed his hands together. \u201cAmitabha, almsgiver of the ghost, this old man advises you to let go of your obsession and return to the heaven and earth.\u201dFu Yu sneered, he leaned over Mo Mo and kissed her forehead. Then he got up and walked towards grandmaster Wu Chen.\u201cOld bald donkey, were you ready to come and collect me? In that case, let\u2019s cut down on the hypocrisy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Su Han pulled two pieces of cloth from the bed and bound Bai Mo\u2019s wrists, temporarily stopping the blood loss.But it still wasn\u2019t enough, she must send Bai Mo to the hospital or she will die.Su Han eagerly looked behind her, but her eyes were suddenly widened with fear.Grandmaster Wu Chen\u2019s talisman paper clearly ignited Fu Yu\u2019s body. She also saw that the body of the fierce ghost begun to turn black. But in the next moment, the fierce ghost\u2019s entire body released a strange black mist.A stabbing sound was heard. The black fog swallowed up all the flames from the talisman paper. Not only that, but also the black fog restored the burnt parts of the fierce ghost.\u201cOld bald donkey, you pissed me off.\u201d The fierce ghost looked at grandmaster Wu Chen in a calculating way, and his eyes turned red. He made several strides to approach grandmaster Wu Chen.Grandmaster Wu Chen quickly gripped the beads in his hands.Originally, the Buddha beads had supreme power, but were corroded by the black fog once it collided with the fierce ghost, it seemed to have become useless.Grandmaster Wu Chen\u2019s old eyes grew bigger and bigger, and a sense of oppression that he has never felt before, surrounded him.Fu Yu grabbed the grandmaster in front of him and smashed him into the ground. Then, went to use his fist to smash his head, but his body suddenly froze.Su Han placed the talisman on his back.Fu Yu paused and turned his head slowly.Su Han opened her eyes wide and looked at him in astonishment.Fu Yu sneered. \u201cEven the old bald donkey\u2019s Buddha beads are useless against me. Do you think you can deal with me with such a talisman? It\u2019s really whimsical.\u201dAfter he finished, he grabbed Su Han by the neck, raised her high, then hurled her to the ground.Bang, Su Han\u2019s whole body was smashed into the ground. From under the back of her head, a pool of blood slowly spread out. Her pupils slowly lost focus, and there was no resistance from her afterwards.Fu Yu raised his hand and prepared to give her the final blow.However, at this time, his waist was suddenly hugged from behind.\u201cFu Yu, don\u2019t hurt innocent people anymore! I\u2019ll stay with you. I\u2019ll stay with you for the rest of my life. Don\u2019t hurt anyone else, I beg you\u2026\u201d The girl cried.Fu Yu\u2019s body trembled.Mo Mo\u2026 Woke up? When did she wake up?Did she witnessed and heard everything?After seeing his cruel and bloodthirsty side, she still said those words?Or\u2026 was she just lying to him?Grandmaster Wu Chen just fainted, but Su Han on the ground had been lying in a pool of blood for a long time. If she isn\u2019t treated, she would probably die from excessive blood loss. Nan Xun was very anxious.At this time, she was eager to swear with her thick mouth.Fuck, when she came, she really came with an attitude of sacrificing herself, but she only sacrificed her own fucking moral integrity. She really didn\u2019t come to die. She didn\u2019t expect to see Fu Yu who didn\u2019t say a single word and suddenly fainted from the man\u2019s treacherous smile.If it wasn\u2019t for Su Han who had just stopped her blood loss in time and little eight who fed her the heart-protecting pill to wake her up in time, her little life would have really been over right then and there.Fu Yu is a deadly pervert!Nan Xun tightly hugged the man in front of her with her goal in mind. Even if he was cold, she didn\u2019t dare to let go.\u201cFu Yu, I will stay with you and never leave you again.\u201d Nan Xun kept talking, she tried to persuade the man in front of her.Fu Yu slowly raised his hand and placed the cold big palm on her waist. He couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cMo Mo, what you say is true?\u201d Would you really stay with me? Always be with me?\u201dNan Xun nodded fiercely. \u201cEn!\u201dFu Yu was very happy, he always thought Mo Mo was afraid of him and hated him, so he wanted to kill her and make her into his puppet, so that she would stay with him forever. But now his Mo Mo said she was willing to stay with him forever.The overwhelming joy didn\u2019t make Fu Yu lose his mind.He turned and looked at the woman lying in the pool of blood again, he slightly raised the corners of his mouth and with a gentle authentic voice: \u201cMo Mo, wait until I kill this woman and the old bald donkey. I promise you, they will be the last two.\u201dNan Xun had the heart to hit the big boss right there.The void beast felt her mood fluctuated and hurriedly comforted her, \u201cHold back, ah, baby. Just as you said, the evil value has dropped by 20! There is only 25 left. Success is just around the corner!\u201dNan Xun listened to little eight\u2019s words. Although she still wanted to poke the villain, she was indeed comforted.\u201cFu Yu, I only have one request. Don\u2019t kill Su Han and grandmaster Wu Chen. Let them go, don\u2019t you want to be with me?\u201d Nan Xun pleaded.Fu Yu looked back at her and his eyes were slightly narrowed, and then slowly formed a smile. He softly said, \u201cGood, I\u2019ll listen to Mo Mo.\u201dWhen Nan Xun heard this, she quickly picked up Su Han from the ground and said to the fierce ghost boss in front of her, \u201cYou will send the unconscious grandmaster Wu Chen\u2026.throw him out of the house. I\u2019ll take Su Han to the hospital and will be back soon.\u201dFu Yu looked at her silently without saying anything which made Nan Xun\u2019s heart bristled.\u201cFu Yu, I promise you, I will come back.\u201d Nan Xun quickly reassure the big boss.After a long time, Fu Yu\u2019s eyes floated with a smile, and his voice was soft: \u201cGood, I will wait for you.\u201dNan Xun personally sent Su Han to the hospital, watched her enter the emergency room, waited for several hours until the operation was finished, then confirmed with the doctor that Su Han was out of danger and left confidently.Nan Xun secretly asked little eight, \u201cIs the big boss still following me?\u201dLittle eight said, \u201cWhat nonsense, according to this ghost\u2019s abnormal desire for control and possessiveness, he must always be glued to you and follow you.\u201d\u201cAnd grandmaster Wu Chen?\u201d\u201cOh, that old bald donkey, he was dragged out of the old house by the big fierce ghost boss and was thrown into a nearby grave.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Well, at least not dead.\u201cAh, little eight, luckily I have you to hang onto. Otherwise, I would have really wanted to run away from this.\u201d Nan Xun said and was somewhat glad.Little eight said with a smile: \u201cDon\u2019t thank me, just eliminate all the evil values.\u201dNan Xun didn\u2019t return immediately. She wandered in the street outside for a long time, thinking that when she entered Fu Yu\u2019s old gloomy house, she wouldn\u2019t see the outside sun.In the early morning, there were basically no people in the streets. Nan Xun wasn\u2019t afraid of meeting any thieves. Anyway, there was a readily available bodyguard called the big boss.She wandered into the supermarket that was almost open, Nan Xun went into the supermarket to buy a lot of food, as well as many fruits and vegetables. She had many big and small bags to carry back and she was almost tired of being a dog.The void beast asked inexplicably, \u201cWhat are you doing? Why don\u2019t you just buy the entire supermarket?\u201dNan Xun replied, \u201cI thought about it and would like to, but without money, I can\u2019t do it. Forget it, I\u2019m going to live with a paranoid pervert immediately. The ghost doesn\u2019t need to eat, but I do, otherwise I\u2019ll starve to death.\u201dThe void beast: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The driver was very enthusiastic and planned to help her carry the bags in, but she was scared and quickly shook her head and waved.As soon as the taxi was far away, the door to the old house opened. Fu Yu was still dressed in a white shirt and black trousers, so he stood at the door and looked at her with a smile in his eyes.NanXun bent her mouth slightly and asked, \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to wait at the door for me the entire time, are you? I just went to the supermarket to buy some food, so I came back late.\u201dThen she handed over the small and big bags from her hands, and said, \u201cWhat are you still doing? As my boyfriend, shouldn\u2019t you help me with this?\u201dThe ghost in front of her was stunned momentarily, then reached out and took the bags from her hand. A pair of cold eyes flashed with a hot light. He didn\u2019t believe it, he thought he had just heard wrong.\u201cMo Mo, what did you say I was? I\u2019m your boyfriend?\u201d Fu Yu stared at the woman in front of him.It was obvious that he was already dead and couldn\u2019t feel his heartbeat, but at this moment, he felt that he had a sense of happiness, to the point of suffocation.Nan Xun pushed his chest and walked in. \u201cMr. Fu Yu, it\u2019s very hot outside. Can we go inside first and talk? Um?\u201dFu Yu foolishly allowed himself to be pushed and didn\u2019t noticed that she was staggering.Nan Xun quickly pulled him forward. Because of inertia, his magnified handsome face was in front of her. Although his skin was a little blue and pale, it was as smooth as porcelain, so delicate and beautiful that people couldn\u2019t help but feel it.Nan Xun\u2019s courage was incredible at this time.She raised her hand and touched Fu Yu\u2019s face, whispering: \u201cSomewhat icy.\u201dFu Yu listened to her and his eyes darkened and deepened, but he soon heard the person in front of him said, \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t matter, I can warm you up later.\u201dThen she pasted her face on his.Their faces were stuck together, the temperature was transmitted, the ice-cold face was warm, and the never-beating heart throbbed.Ten minutes later.Nan Xun was nestled on the sofa in the living room, she ate apples while watching soap operas.The apple was so crisp and tasted really good.The void beast suddenly said, \u201cYou\u2019re so brave. How dare you let the big boss cook for you? Did you forget that he wanted your life not too long ago?\u201dNan Xun laughed, \u201cLittle eight, you\u2019re a beast that doesn\u2019t understand that humans are complicated creatures. Fu Yu likes me like this. If I\u2019m polite to him, he will think I\u2019m looking elsewhere.\u201dAfter that, Nan Xun sighed with some sadness. \u201cWhen I do this, my head is always attached to the waistband of my pants. What\u2019s more, I\u2019m also exposed to a psychologically distorted pervert. Regardless of my three years of high school, these days, Fu Yu\u2019s big perversion have already touched my temper clearly. If I pretend to meet the pervert\u2019s preferences, it\u2019s not only counterproductive, but I am still alive and would feel wrong.\u201dThe void beast said, \u201cJust be happy, but don\u2019t forget about the evil value.\u201dJust now, the evil value dropped again, but he didn\u2019t want to tell Nan Xun at this time, so that she wouldn\u2019t be smug.There was an attractive rice aroma wafting from the kitchen. Nan Xun took a deep breath. She was so greedy that she snuck to the kitchen door and probed her head inside.\u201cWow, Mr. Fu Yu, you\u2019re so virtuous. I\u2019m really lucky to be your girlfriend, it\u2019s truly the blessings of three lifetimes!\u201d Nan Xun smiled.The man who was cooking, looked back at her, his eyes overflowed with fragmented smiles.\u201cGo to the living room and wait, it\u2019s almost done.\u201d The man said.\u201cDear Mr. Fu Yu, I want to eat stir-fried carrots and shredded pork, don\u2019t you forget, oh~\u201d\u201cI know, I\u2019ll make it for you right away.\u201d The man smiled, then turned to continue cooking.Nan Xun happily returned to the living room and continued to chat with little eight in her heart, \u201cFu Yu is really a good man at home.\u201dThe void beast reminded her, \u201cHe\u2019s not a man, he\u2019s a fierce ghost.\u201dNan Xun immediately wilted, she couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cHis obsession is too heavy, I am not worthy of his affections for so many years.\u201dThe void beast nodded, \u201cYes, you are a piece of shit.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026There were three dishes and one soup on the table, full of color, fragrance and flavor. Nan Xun was very satisfied with her food, she didn\u2019t forget to serve vegetables to the boss.Fu Yu looked at the bowl full of carrots, and his expression changed subtly. He suddenly said, \u201cMo Mo, I don\u2019t need to eat.\u201dNan Xun, ah and expressed her regret, then ate the bowl in front of Fu Yu.The void beast: \u201cAre you a pig? Eat so much.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cFu Yu\u2019s food is really delicious. It\u2019s just that I\u2019ve became a specialist to study this.\u201dAfter dinner, Fu Yu took the initiative to wash the dishes and chopsticks. When he came out of the kitchen after washing, Nan Xun had already fallen asleep on the sofa.Fu Yu sat beside her and looked down at her. The tenderness in his eyes overflowed and filled the room.He watched, and then Fu Yu\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but narrowed.It\u2019s already very satisfying, but why wasn\u2019t it enough? He wants more, more\u2026Nan Xun had a good rest. She didn\u2019t know when Fu Yu took her to his bed, and she held his quilt. She looked at the man sitting in front of the desk vaguely, yawned and asked, \u201cFu Yu, what are you doing?\u201dFu Yu looked at her sideways, \u201cWake up?\u201dNan Xun got up and walked behind him. When she saw the picture on the table, she couldn\u2019t help but open her mouth in surprise. \u201cYou drew me?\u201dOn the desk was a portrait sketch of Nan Xun sleeping on the sofa. The face was so finely drawn that the curly eyelashes on the eyelids could be counted. It was dark and dense. The texture of her mouth and the little smooth water line that lubricated her wet lips were also very delicate. The slightly small opened lips showed a slit in the middle, it revealed two small incisors.Nan Xun was a little shy. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t drool while she slept. Otherwise, according to Fu Yu\u2019s temperament, the drool marks would have been drawn.\u201cFu Yu, you\u2019re not allowed to draw me sleeping in the future.\u201d Nan Xun said.Fu Yu didn\u2019t understand, \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that if I do something indecent, you would draw it, and I will fall into the cracks from shame.\u201dThen he smiled and said, \u201cWhy? You\u2019re so good-looking.\u201dNan Xun had a big red face. \u201cLittle eight, I was praised by the ghost and he said I was pretty, then I am a little shy. What happened?\u201dThe void beast, who was already familiar with Nan Xun\u2019s virtue, silently rolled its eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s because the ghost in front of you is a handsome one. However, where\u2019s your shyness? This skin isn\u2019t yours, it\u2019s not you that he praises.\u201dNan Xun immediately asked Fu Yu, \u201cFu Yu, do you think that my body is beautiful, or my soul is beautiful?\u201dFu Yu didn\u2019t think she would ask this question and was stunned. After thinking about it, he smiled a little. \u201cMo Mo is beautiful, but the soul is more beautiful.\u201dNan Xun was triumphant, while the void beast pretended to be dead.The ghost is in love with a fool.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Well, your\u2026it\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cEspecially get away from me\u2014\u201d Nan Xun\u2019s roar came from the bathroom.The smile in Fu Yu\u2019s eyes thickened. After standing at the bathroom door for a moment, he left as she wished.Nan Xun quickly asked little eight, \u201cHas the ghost boss gone away?\u201dLittle eight didn\u2019t respond.Nan Xun suddenly remembered that little eight had blocked his five senses, so now he couldn\u2019t see or hear anything.Nan Xun, who felt that the vicious ghost boss had gone far away, finally took a hot bath in comfort.Nan Xun wrapped herself with a bath towel into a big glutinous filled rice ball, then went to the bed, quickly and easily put on her pajamas then covered herself tightly with the quilt.Fu Yu witnessed everything, he sat at the edge of the bed with a smile in his eyes.\u201cMo Mo, go to sleep. Don\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t do anything to you.\u201dNan Xun glanced at him in disbelief, \u201cWhen I was at home with Su Han, was it you who played rogue to me many times?\u201dFu Yu choked, then suddenly lowered his head and looked wronged. He said, \u201cMo Mo, if you don\u2019t want, I won\u2019t touch you.\u201dNan Xun immediately asked little eight in her heart, \u201cDo you believe him?\u201dLittle eight retorted crisply, \u201cDo not believe.\u201dAlthough the big vicious ghost boss said that he wouldn\u2019t touch Nan Xun, the ghost didn\u2019t need to sleep, so while Nan Xun slept, he took a chair and sat beside the bed and stared at her back.Nan Xun: \u201cLittle eight, the back of my head is so cold. I think my head may bloom if he keeps staring at me like this.\u201dThe void beast quickly commented: \u201cAren\u2019t you here to contribute by exercising? Don\u2019t you want to invite Mr. Vicious Ghost to bed as soon as possible?\u201dNan Xun: \u201cWell, baby, you better keep playing dead.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s heart was very big, although there was a ghost behind her, she still slept like the dead.Before her consciousness was blurred, she thought that since Mr. Vicious Ghost wanted to pretend to be a gentleman, she would let him pretend.However, in the middle of the night, Nan Xun vaguely felt that there was a cold wind in her quilt, which wrapped her tightly.Nan Xun rolled her eyes in her heart and turned around to embrace the ice-cold blockhead beside her.When she woke up in the morning, Nan Xun was lying alone in the bed, and the ghost in the house was gone.After waiting downstairs, Nan Xun found a cup of hot milk and a piece of freshly baked bread on the table.\u201cFu Yu? Fu Yu?\u201d Nan Xun called out twice, but no one answered.After eating breakfast, Nan Xun went to the yard alone to weed. Yesterday, she bought some flower seeds while she went shopping. She wanted to turn the yard over and replant some flowers.This hard work should have been done by Fu Yu, but she didn\u2019t know where that ghost had gone.After weeding half the yard, she suddenly heard Fu Yu\u2019s voice in her ear, \u201cMo Mo, what are you doing?\u201dNan Xun was frightened by him. She wanted to tell him to not walk soundlessly but remembered that he was a ghost. A ghost would walk without sound.\u201cI want to plant flowers. I wanted to ask you to help me weed, but you weren\u2019t here.\u201dFu Yu listened, and his eyes turned very soft. He handed her a bouquet of wild chrysanthemums from his hand and said with a light smile, \u201cThis is what I picked from the field just now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been missing all morning, just to pick flowers for me?\u201d Nan Xun was surprised. She took the flowers and placed them on the tip of her nose to smell them.The faint fragrance of the wild chrysanthemum smelled very comfortable.\u201cI like it very much, thank you Mr. Fu Yu.\u201d Nan Xun smiled and gave him a hot hug.Fu Yu hugged her and kissed the side of her face. \u201cI knew you would like it.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s mouth silently twitched.What would you have done if I said I didn\u2019t like it?When she finished her hug, Fu Yu touched her head, took the shovel from her hand and began to dig the yard, while Nan Xun planted seeds in the upturned soil.In the afternoon, Nan Xun sat on the balcony to look at the scenery. Fu Yu suddenly hugged her waist from behind. \u201cMo Mo, this scenery in front of me, before I saw you every summer, riding a worn-out bike passing by, sometimes you would even wave and smile at me.\u201dNan Xun silently said: If I knew that you would become such a fierce ghost in the future, I would only have cried towards you from the beginning.\u201cI thought there was a little girl standing on the balcony, Mr. Fu Yu, I really didn\u2019t think it was you.\u201d Nan Xun said.Fu Yu\u2019s eyes twitched slightly and emphasized: \u201cMo Mo, I\u2019m 1.86 meters now and I can lift you with only one hand.\u201dNan Xun still didn\u2019t respond, and she felt that her body was lighter and her whole person was lifted by a strong arm, she couldn\u2019t help but cry out in alarm.Nan Xun quickly supported her head in case she fell. Now, she sat on his left arm like a child. She looked down at the fierce ghost who looked up at her. Her expression was stunned.She had never experienced this feeling, she never had a strong arm that she could rely on, never.Why was Fu Yu a fierce ghost? If not, how nice it would have been.Nan Xun\u2019s brain short-circuited for a moment and suddenly said, \u201cFu Yu, let\u2019s go on a date.\u201dFu Yu stared blankly at the big girl sitting on his shoulder and muttered, \u201cDate?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a little late today. We can only go to a movie. Tomorrow, we will go shopping and go to the playground to go to the park and row on the boat. There are so many things that lovers can do together\u2026\u201d Nan Xun said a lot.Fu Yu\u2019s eyes became more and more dazed, but at last they became sad.\u201cMo Mo, have you forgotten\u2026. I am already dead?\u201dNan Xun said, \u201cI know, but what does it matter? We can still go on a date.\u201dNan Xun was a person who does what she says. She had some money from her savings. She can buy a beautiful dress and go see a movie in the evening.She held onto her own ghost husband, then Nan Xun hurriedly wandered around the shopping mall excitedly. The ghost husband would look at her after she change. In the beginning, he was expected to give some advice. As a result, the ghost husband saw her dress and nodded and said it was good-looking.At last, when she came out with the white dress pinching her waist, the ghost husband\u2019s eyes could see straight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, there was a small willow waist from front to back. This white waist was pinched by the dress which was simple and generous in style. It also outlined her curves much better which made it especially suitable for her.Fu Yu stepped forward and placed his arm around her waist and said, \u201cMo Mo, this dress I want to buy for you personally.\u201dNan Xun glanced at him and scorned mercilessly, \u201cHow can you buy it, with ming bi?\u201dMr. Ghost was speechless at once.His current money was indeed ming bi.Nan Xun, who changed into her new dress, walked on the street with a 100% return rate. Fu Yu wasn\u2019t happy. He stared at the men who looked at Nan Xun, his eyes were full of murderous rage. \u201cMo Mo, I really want to dig out their eyes.\u201dNan Xun had a headache. She quickly clenched his hand. \u201cMr. Fu Yu, I\u2019m yours now. Others can only look, but you\u2019re different.\u201dShe thought it would take a great deal of effort to quell Fu Yu\u2019s anger. As a result, she didn\u2019t know what he thought. He lowered his head slightly and the corners of his mouth were hooked up. He said, \u201cMo Mo, I understand.\u201dNan Xun was a little confused.Ghost da ren, what do you understand? Why didn\u2019t I understand anything?When they watched the movie, Nan Xun bought two tickets. Although in the eyes of outsiders, the seat next to Nan Xun was empty, only she knew that there was a paranoid ghost that sat beside her.During the entire time they watched the movie, the cold big palm held her hand tightly. Instead of watching the movie, he stared at her the entire time.Thanks to Nan Xun\u2019s great heart, even if the ghost da ren stared at her, she can continue to watch the film without her face changing and she was still fascinated.At the end of the movie, the heroine died of cancer. The male protagonist felt that without the female lead, he wouldn\u2019t be able to live, so he crashed into a car and in the end, they both died.The plot was very bloody, but it\u2019s better than the actor\u2019s acting, and the scene layout was very beautiful and luxurious.There was a whimper all around. Everyone was moved by the earth-shattering love. But Nan Xun didn\u2019t shed a tear. She felt that the feelings were too fake.Fu Yu, who didn\u2019t watch much of the movie, only saw the last scene. He suddenly asked Nan Xun, \u201cMo Mo, if you were the hero, would you follow me to death?\u201dNan Xun stretched and casually replied, \u201cOf course not. There is so many in the world to love, who needs to die. The hero just let himself go. He didn\u2019t think about the people who would be worried about him, especially his parents, the white-haired people who send the black-haired people first, how pitiful they were. In the end, that man was selfish and unfilial.\u201dFu Yu held her big palm and suddenly tightened his grip. He asked coldly, \u201cIf the dead person was me, would you follow me?\u201dNan Xun suddenly was frightened. Did she say something that made the boss da ren very unhappy?\u201cLittle eight, I am so flustered. How can I answer that sentence?\u201dThe void beast: \u201c\u2026I wish you luck.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s mood brewed, then looked at him sideways, with firm eyes. \u201cFu Yu, do you want me to die with you? If you want, I\u2019ll die. Anyway, my mother who loved me the most is no longer here. There is no one in this world that would be worried about me.\u201dFu Yu was silent for a while and shook his head. \u201cIf Mo Mo died, there would be no temperature. Even if you were made into a puppet, you would not be the original Mo Mo. I like you alive.\u201dNan Xun took his hand and kissed him, then said, \u201cFu Yu, whatever you want, even if you do something wrong, I will not blame you\u2026\u201dBefore the film was finished, Fu Yu, a fierce ghost, rushed to hurriedly pull Nan Xun and left.Fu Yu was silent all the way back, he only held Nan Xun\u2019s hand tightly.When they arrived at the old house, the door opened without the wind. Fu Yu lifted Nan Xun up and place her against the door. He covered her with a hot fierce kiss.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes were stunned.Fuck, what she just said, she didn\u2019t mean words of love, did it stimulate the big boss?\u201cLittle eight, little eight, it\u2019s over! I think the boss da ren may want to brew sauce with me!\u201dThe void beast sighed, \u201cSooner or later, this day would have come. As the saying goes, an early demise means an earlier reincarnation, you must accept this unpleasant fact\u2026I\u2019ll be blocking my five senses. Bye-bye~\u201d\u201cLittle eight! Little eight, you\u2019re fucking dead!\u201dNan Xun was breathless from the ghost da ren\u2019s kiss. With great difficulty, she gasped: \u201cGo\u2026go to the bedroom\u2026\u201dThen the ghost da ren hugged her all the way through the house. Nan Xun was afraid of falling, so she quickly raised her legs and hooked it onto his waist.The ghost da ren chuckled, and the laughter echoed between the two people\u2019s lips and teeth, which made her tongue tingle.Suddenly, she felt a little cold on her body. She looked down and saw that her clothes had been stripped off. Then, her shoes fell on the wooden floor of the living room.Then there was a pair of pants, the small inner wear\u2026. fell off all the way.With a bang, the bedroom door was shut clearly.After a while, Nan Xun\u2019s sad cry came from the room.The ghost da ren licked her tears, the voice was particularly very gentle, \u201cMo Mo, don\u2019t cry. I will be very gentle\u2026\u201dHowever, Nan Xun howled all night.\u201cFu Yu, you\u2019re such a liar\u2013\u201d\u201cMo Mo, this time I will be very gentle.\u201d\u201cGet away from me, there will be no next time\u2014\u201dThe next morning, Nan Xun wrapped herself up like a silkworm baby with only her head exposed. Her eyes were wide open, and she looked out the window with empty eyes.The satisfied ghost da ren was no longer here. It seemed as if he was making breakfast downstairs.The void beast: \u201cDear, are you okay? Hee hee, good news. After the fierce battle last night, the evil value of the big fierce ghost boss suddenly dropped by 20, 20! There are only five points left for us to succeed!\u201dNan Xun shriveled and sighed, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m paying homage to the virtues that I\u2019ve lost yesterday.\u201dThe void beast coughed, \u201cDear, try this line, only by losing virtue did it changed. Come see the light, look at it~\u201dNan Xun ha ha, \u201cLittle eight, it\u2019s me, not you, who lost virtue.\u201dThe void beast began to play dead.Nan Xun sat up with the quilt in her arms. She didn\u2019t know what to expect. She hurriedly called little eight, \u201cLittle eight, don\u2019t pretend to be dead, I have something to ask you.\u201dThe void beast was full of blood, \u201cDear, you may ask.\u201d\u201cLast night, when I was brewing soy sauce with the ghost da ren, I suddenly felt the soul was familiar and blending. Why do you think I felt the familiarity?\u201d Nan Xun asked.The void beast was surprised, \u201cDear, da, how are you so dirty? Oh, still the soul blending, you can say that the body blended well~\u201dNan Xun placed a hand on her forehead. \u201cLittle eight, I\u2019m asking you this question very seriously.\u201dThe void beast paused and said, \u201cIt should be that you\u2026you want more?\u201dNan Xun groaned and didn\u2019t speak again but looked out the window in a daze. Her eyes were clearly extinguished, and her thoughts were unknown.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When she smelled the delicious food, she turned her head. When she found that it was the ghost man who had brought the food, she turned her head and was angry.Fu Yu was helpless and placed the good meal in front of Nan Xun, he coaxed her. \u201cMo Mo, you should eat, it\u2019s your favorite dish.\u201dAfter that, he reached out and picked up the whole silkworm baby from the bed, held the rice bowl directly, and dug with a big spoon to spoon feed her.Nan Xun didn\u2019t want to eat, but her stomach made a sound at this time.Come on, made pancakes all last night and in the early morning, then she slept until noon, she wasn\u2019t hungry.Nan Xun ate from the spoon, then opened her mouth and continued to wait to be fed.Fu Yu laughed and gave her spoonful upon spoonful until the bottom of the bowl was revealed. Then, he went to refill the bowl.Nan Xun ate a bowl and a half. When she couldn\u2019t eat anymore, she shook her head and patted her bulging stomach. \u201cI\u2019m full.\u201dFu Yu touched her head, leaned over and kissed her greasy mouth, then cleaned up the dishes and left.Nan Xun happily laid down on the bed and gossiped with little eight. \u201cFu Yu is really a good ghost at home. This good dish was especially suitable for my appetite.\u201dThe void beast immediately pricked her happiness bubble, \u201cHave you forgotten that the ghost da ren had killed two people and one completely turned insane because of him?\u201dNan Xun: \u201c\u2026Baby, why on earth would you mention this without rhyme or reason?\u201dThe void beast snorted, \u201cNo matter which world it is, don\u2019t be moved with feelings that shouldn\u2019t be moved.\u201dNan Xun was startled by his words, \u201cLittle eight, you, you, you mean, you think that I like ghost da ren? You are too heavy, fuck, even if all the men in the world were dead, I can\u2019t like it. He, he is a ghost! And have you forgotten, he almost killed me?\u201dThe void beast grunted again, \u201cYou know.\u201dThe food in the house was almost eaten. Nan Xun didn\u2019t expect a ghost to buy her food. So, she appeased the ghost and went out with her own money.When she reached the door, she saw Fu Yu staring at her the entire time.Nan Xun sighed helplessly, grabbed his neck and offered a hot kiss. Fu Yu quickly hugged her back to kiss.\u201cDarling, I will go to the supermarket. If you\u2019re okay, water and weed the flowers at home.\u201d Nan Xun touched his handsome face.Fu Yu smiled and said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll wait for you at home.\u201dNan Xun said to little eight shyly, \u201cShort oil, what\u2019s with this sense of seeing off a virtuous wife who is waiting for her husband to return home?\u201dThe void beast: \u201c\u2026. Husband, it\u2019s time for you to go shopping.\u201dNan Xun went to the supermarket for a stroll. The cart was full of all kinds of food and the cashier lady looked at her more.\u201cLittle eight, the big fierce ghost boss really didn\u2019t follow?\u201d Nan Xun still didn\u2019t believe.The void beast: \u201cReally, this time he didn\u2019t follow.\u201dNan Xun thought about whether to take advantage of the ghost da ren not being present to go to other places, but on second thought, forget it, can\u2019t let the ghost da ren wait too long, in case of anger, it wasn\u2019t good.Nan Xun was carrying a big bag and small bag when she was blocked by a car. A man suddenly rushed up from behind, covered her mouth and dragged her back.As soon as Nan Xun\u2019s face sank, she raised her leg and was about to turn her body to kick.The person behind her barely avoided danger and whispered, \u201cMo Mo, it\u2019s me!\u201dNan Xun was stunned.Su Han?Su Han\u2019s head was still bandaged. She pulled Nan Xun to the corner and looked at her solemnly. \u201cI\u2019ve followed you since you\u2019ve left the town. I\u2019ve observed you for a long time to make sure you were alone.\u201dNan Xun knew what she meant and nodded, \u201cHe didn\u2019t follow me.\u201dSu Han\u2019s face looked a little complicated, \u201cMo Mo, did you save me and grandmaster Wu Chen?\u201dNan Xun nodded again, with a nonchalant expression, \u201cThis thing that happened, it\u2019s between me and him, and shouldn\u2019t involve others.\u201d\u201cBai Mo!\u201d Su Han looked at her and angrily said, \u201cAre you crazy? It\u2019s a fierce ghost! Do you understand? Just a few days ago, he almost killed you!\u201dNan Xun\u2019s heart: Of course, I know, but I didn\u2019t eliminate the evil value of the ghost da ren. I can\u2019t leave him.Su Han took out a bag of black powder and a piece of talisman paper from her pocket and placed them in Nan Xun\u2019s hand. She eagerly said, \u201cMo Mo, listen, this is your last chance. Master Wu Chen passed away last night. Before he died, he drew this talisman paper with his heart and blood, as well as this bag of thousand-year-old mahogany heart powder. It\u2019s especially useful against fierce ghosts.\u201d\u201cWait for an opportunity to feed the heart powder to the fierce ghost, then stick the talisman paper on his chest. Then he will die, I\u2019ll figure it out. The day after tomorrow is the best time to start\u2026\u201dNan Xun stupidly took those two things, looked at Su Han\u2019s mouth that opened and closed and suddenly asked little eight, \u201cYou said that Su Han almost died last time. Why hasn\u2019t she given up?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cHer aura is good, the heavens are kind, her aura is thick, generally it will be difficult to die.\u201d\u201cMo Mo, do you understand what I said?\u201dNan Xun nodded quickly. \u201cOh, I know.\u201dSu Han repeated her instructions several times before leaving.After waiting for someone to leave, Nan Xun smelled the black powder in her hand and wrinkled her nose with disgust. \u201cHow smelly! Did grandmaster Wu Chen add black dog blood inside?\u201dThe void beast was a little surprise. \u201cYou know about black dog blood? Yes.\u201dNan Xun snorted, \u201cLook down on me, right? I know the ghost blows the yang fire. There are three yang fires on the person. One on top of the head, the other two on the shoulders. When you walk at night, don\u2019t look back. If you blow out the yang fire caused by the ghost, you will be taken by the ghost.\u201dThe void beast listened to this and began to think.Nan Xun studied the black powder and the incantation in her hand for a while, while she thought that this was the last hard work of grandmaster Wu Chen, she wanted to throw it away. It was a pity to throw it away, so she asked little eight if there was a place that was heavy with yin.Little eight took her to a shady alley with strong yin. Nan Xun sprinkled the peach wood powder everywhere and then used the talisman paper and pasted it on the road to the alley.After doing all this, Nan Xun clapped her hands and continued to carry her bags of food.Before she reached Fu Yu\u2019s house, Nan Xun saw a man standing at the doorway alone.Fu Yu greeted her from behind the door and took the initiative to take the things from her hand, but he stood still for a long time and didn\u2019t move.He stared at Nan Xun and his eyes looked wrong. Something seemed to be madly gathering in his eyes.Nan Xun asked, \u201cFu Yu, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dFu Yu didn\u2019t speak, but directly added. He picked her up, turned around and went upstairs.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why does he think about making pancakes in broad daylight?\u201d Nan Xun was frightened.Little eight coughed, \u201cI was absent-minded and recalled, that although the ghost da ren didn\u2019t follow you, but this area within several hundred-kilometer, the little ghosts are his people. What you did, the little ghost must have told the ghost da ren a long time ago.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Afterwards, she was afraid. If she had brought back the talisman paper and the mahogany heart powder, would the big boss be angry?Maybe he would directly eat her in his fit of rage, in the literal sense.This time, Fu Yu\u2019s pancake was very excited. Nan Xun deeply experienced the feeling that her soul almost left her body.Since then, the meat-eating ghost was out of control and indulged. He bullied people intolerably and pressed Nan Xun to make pancakes as soon as there was an opportunity.This ghost was also well-read. He was proficient in the 9,981 positions. Every day, there were seven styles that were not repeated.A month later, Nan Xun looked in the mirror and was shocked.\u201cFuck, who is that in the mirror? How could this face be as pale as a ghost?\u201dThe void beast: \u201cPeople and ghosts are different. Do you think it\u2019s just written casually in a book? You and the ghost, or a fierce ghost, have been brewing sauce all day and your yang is almost absorbed by him. But the good news is that there is only one point left for the evil value.\u201dNan Xun looked at the paper-pale face in the mirror and suddenly asked, \u201cDoes Fu Yu know about this?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cIt should have been known, but fortunately this beast is clever and imposed earlier a diversionary tactic, in his eyes you still have a rosy appearance. Hehe, he may have forgotten for a while that ghosts sucks yang.\u201dNan Xun licked her mouth, she reached out to touch her face and asked, \u201cHow long do I have to stay after this mission?\u201dThe void beast: \u201cThe last world we stayed in for too long and in this world, we were stranded for several years because of my mistake, so we must leave as soon as possible after we complete the task.\u201dNan Xun oh once and then began to put on makeup in front of the mirror, her pale face had a bit of color.The void beast was puzzled. \u201cWhat are you doing? Fu Yu can\u2019t see your pale face.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to take Fu Yu out for a last date.\u201dOn this day, Fu Yu\u2019s whole ghost was in a good mood. Mo Mo actually had another date with him.One person and one ghost went to play in the roller coaster and spaceship, screaming the entire time. In the evening, they went to see a movie. Nan Xun followed other people and cried. Fu Yu was helpless and patted the head of his beloved girl and comforted her silently.Back at the mansion, just after the door was opened, Nan Xun was a little hot and unusual. As soon as the whole person went up, she hung onto the ghost like an octopus, held his head and began to nibble.Nan Xun\u2019s fiery heat made Fu Yu almost unable to stand, he held her all the way up to their love nest.That day, the thunder stirred the fire, it was fierce, ah, the bed almost fell apart.At a certain moment, the void beast\u2019s voice suddenly rang, \u201cDear, I have blocked the five senses in advance, and I can\u2019t hear or see anything. I just came to pass on a message. The evil value of the big fierce ghost boss is all cleared, and the task is complete! Now, I will give you an hour to stay, afterwards we will leave immediately.\u201dNan Xun was joined with the ghost da ren and the alluring woman played. The moment she fought with the ghost and heard this sentence, she almost fell from the top of the clouds.Nan Xun embraced Fu Yu more enthusiastic. The fight between the two was much more intense and more exciting than before. The various moves were staged in turns.When Nan Xun tossed herself to the point of becoming a puddle of mud, she nestled in Fu Yu\u2019s arms and rubbed her head against his chin. She said wearily, \u201cFu Yu, I\u2019m sleepy and want to sleep for a while.\u201dFu Yu\u2019s eyes were full of tenderness. He smiled, bowed his head and kissed her forehead. \u201cOkay, I will accompany you.\u201dThe ghost didn\u2019t need to sleep, but now he held Nan Xun in his arms, his chin against her head and closed his eyes just like her.Just when he closed his eyes, Nan Xun\u2019s soul was pulled out of her body by little eight.She looked at the person in the man\u2019s arms that was even paler than him. The whole person was dull and dead. Although it looked ugly, but it gave people a feeling of peace.\u201cWell, don\u2019t look. Let\u2019s go.\u201d All of a sudden, the void beast\u2019s voice sounded in her mind.Nan Xun sighed and asked: \u201cWhen Fu Yu wakes up and sees that I\u2019m not breathing and dead because he had absorbed all the yang, would he collapse and want to die?\u201dThe void beast replied: \u201cJoking, how could anyone who has died once die again? And you think a lot. Before, he wanted to kill you and make you a puppet for himself. Now, his original desire would be considered achieved.\u201dNan Xun made a oh sound. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s soul slowly became distorted and she was about to leave the world. The ghost man with his eyes closed suddenly noticed something and opened his eyes. A pair of black eyes turned into blood-red eyes! From the eyes, evil spirit overflowed and stared fixedly at her direction.But in a moment, the eyes returned to normal again. The man was confused for a while, then he gathered the person in his arms and continued to close his eyes and slept peacefully.Nan Xun was shocked and didn\u2019t think too much about it. The next moment, she blacked out and left the world.When she opened her eyes again, Nan Xun was a little confused. Was it her illusion just now? How could she feel that she saw a pair of blood-colored pupils?However, Nan Xun soon had no time to think about anything else, because she realized that she was held in someone\u2019s arms.The person held her too tightly and the posture wasn\u2019t right, which caused her to be unable to breathe.Nan Xun raised her head with difficulty, looked up and down. Fuck, a big face swayed in front of her eyes. From surprise, Nan Xun raised her arm and slapped his face.With a pa, the sound was a little crisp and small.Nan Xun was a little confused.She raised her hand and placed it in front of her eyes to look at for a long time, it was small, white and tender.Nan Xun\u2019s face was black and hurriedly called out to the void beast in her heart, \u201cLittle eight, shouldn\u2019t you explain to me, what\u2019s going on?\u201dThe void beast happily replied: \u201cIsn\u2019t it satisfying that I met your requirements? You said that you wanted to be born in a rich family and have a blood relationship with the strategic goal. Now this is it. Your father, Li Chen has a lot of money in his family. Really, your grandfather used to be a gangster. Later, he washed everything in his grandfather\u2019s hands and set up the Li Group. It involves real estate, entertainment, catering, transportation and other industries. It\u2019s fucking awesome, it wouldn\u2019t be out of the question that you can later eat delicious food and drink hard liquor.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cThe strategic goal is\u2026\u201dThe void beast: \u201cYour father, he is so handsome!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can\u2019t attack the target directly until adulthood?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cYou\u2019re stupid. Family love and romantic love are not the same. Since you want to use family to influence the boss\u2019 black heart, you must start from a young age. Now, you are only one year old, and the time is just right.\u201dNan Xun felt it was quite reasonable.She tried to stretch her neck to observe the woman holding her, or the girl was more appropriate. She was very beautiful, with a big ponytail, and she was sixteen or seventeen years old.Nan Xun asked curiously: \u201cLittle eight, this girl is \u2013\u201d\u201cYour mother.\u201d The void beast quickly replied.Nan Xun: \u201cI was asking you very politely, what do you mean by swearing?\u201dThe void beast: \u201cNot swearing, she\u2019s your mother.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cBaby, are you sure you\u2019re not kidding? This is a girl that is sixteen or seventeen-years-old, doesn\u2019t this mean she was pregnant with me when she was fourteen or fifteen?\u201dThe void beast began to explain, \u201cYour mother is seventeen-years-old, and your father was even younger, fourteen-years-old.\u201dNan Xun felt that her three views might be broken. If she didn\u2019t get it wrong, what little eight meant was that the villain boss father, who was her target, enlarged the belly of a woman when he was just twelve years old and had her.Fuck, this wasn\u2019t human!The void beast continued to explain, \u201cYour father is not the big boss villain here. It\u2019s normal to be precocious. When your father was twelve years old, he was in his third year of junior high school. Your mother and him were classmates. Your mother was the school flower. She took the initiative to hook up with your father. As a result, your father was so cold that she spared no effort to try to hook up with him. Then, one dark night, your mother intoxicated your father, forced him, and it became a good thing. After getting pregnant, she dropped out of school and secretly gave birth to you. Now, she is standing in front of the Li\u2019s family villa, which covers a few acres.\u201dAfter Nan Xun heard the key points, the whole person wasn\u2019t good.Fuck, this woman was too brave. She dared to force a big boss with an evil value of 100!The void beast: \u201cYour father\u2019s worth was too attractive. How many women secretly covet your father, but when it\u2019s finally done, they hold you now. People are really powerful.\u201dNan Xun secretly gave a big thumbs-up. Unexpectedly, no matter how powerful the villain boss was, he was calculated.However, Nan Xun didn\u2019t want to worry about her. The child she was born into, this situation wasn\u2019t pleasant. The big question was whether she could enter the Li family smoothly and become an official daughter.After the void beast knew her worries, he immediately said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the original host finally entered the Li family, because the old master didn\u2019t allow the descendants of the Li family to be exiled, but the original host of your body was too much, she ate, drank and played all day and took advantage of the family. In addition, your romantic father made a litter of younger brothers and sisters for her. This litter of cubs, in your father\u2019s custody, under her arrogance, were all like wolves. They all stared at her together like a wolf and dealt with her together. She dealt with one, then, she dealt with more and more, and finally she died.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s mouth was opened. Why did she think she encountered a stallion father?A litter? That\u2019s so amazing.Nan Xun suddenly didn\u2019t understand, \u201cThe original host, why were those little kids staring at her?\u201dThe void beast explained: \u201cLi Chen\u2019s grandfather, the last generation of the Li family was the mother in the family. The Li family only recognized the first wife and not others. If the original host had the ability, the large Li group would have probably been given to her.\u201dNo wonder.The girl who held her, stood at the gate for a long time, until an extended luxury car came from the distance.The girl who held her immediately stopped in front of the black luxury car and greeted.The car stopped, and after a while, a man in a suit came out of the car and was very tall.Nan Xun craned her neck and looked at him. She said, \u201cMy father is too strong, he has Chinese features. Will I grow up to be strong too?\u201dThe void beast: \u201cStupid girl, I just said that your father is only fourteen-years-old, this is just a bodyguard.\u201dThree big thick bodyguards dressed in black came over and picked up her scheming mother and threw her aside.Her scheming mother fell to the ground and cried towards the car, \u201cLi Chen, I\u2019m soft, ah. The child in my arms is yours. Do you remember that night\u2026\u201dAt this time, the door was opened, and two people came out from the car one after the other. The first man was about fifty years old. He was a handsome uncle, and next to him\u2026Nan Xun tried to stretch her neck, but it wasn\u2019t easy to see what the man looked like, but she was stunned.A very handsome little fresh meat.The man\u2019s face was childish, but she could already see the outline of a cool handsome face, the nose was very strong, his eyes were cold and deep, his lips were thin, and he looked even colder and merciless.Although his face hasn\u2019t matured yet, the expensive tailored suit made him look more mature and stable which was inconsistent to his age, giving a sense of inexplicable coercion.And his height, he was only 14 years old, but was already 1.76 meters. He would later grow even a little more taller and be outstanding.Nan Xun looked up for a while, her neck was a little sore and she was still sleepy. She couldn\u2019t help but yawn.Li Chen coldly glared at the woman who described herself to be in a difficult situation. When he looked at the milk baby in her arms, that is, Nan Xun, he was suddenly stunned.Nan Xun spit up a bubble, looked at him, and then smiled brilliantly. His black lacquered eyes narrowed into a slit. She also placed a chubby little paw on him.\u201cLi Chen, what\u2019s going on?\u201d The handsome uncle besides the young man looked coldly at Nan Xun and the woman holding her.The young man\u2019s eyes moved, suddenly pursed his lips and his face was indifferent. \u201cThe peach blossom debt caused by my young romantics, but I didn\u2019t know that this woman secretly carried my child.\u201dThe young man\u2019s words made the handsome uncle laughed, \u201cYou are now fourteen-years-old. I can see this little doll is one year old. Boy, you are much more better than Laozi. You dare make a woman pregnant when you were twelve-years-old.\u201dNan Xun listened to this, her small mouth was silent and took a breath. What was with this proud tone towards this responsibility? Was it so great to be with a woman at such a young age?Fuck, they both have problems with their three views!The handsome uncle\u2019s eyes fell on Nan Xun.Nan Xun quickly waved her chubby little paws towards him.Then the handsome uncle said, \u201cThe child will stay, after all, it\u2019s the blood of my Li family. As for this woman, my Li family will never allow such a calculating woman to enter its door.\u201dAs he spoke, he took out a blank check and threw it in front of the woman. Then stood in front of her, \u201cGive me the child and leave, okay.\u201dNan Xun clearly saw that the woman\u2019s eyes brightened, but she quickly opened her eyes and cried: \u201cGrandpa Li, I really love Li Chen, otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have given birth to this child through all these hardships, I\u2026\u201dThe handsome uncle\u2019s face sank. \u201cI don\u2019t want to repeat what I said. Take this check and roll or get nothing.\u201dThen her scheming mother weighted the options and left Nan Xun. Of course, she simply also took the check from the ground.Nan Xun: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She thought that Li Chen was the old man\u2019s son. They were very handsome, an old handsome man and a little handsome man.The little handsome man came over and his movements were clumsy when he awkwardly picked her up.\u201cBro, brother\u2026\u201d Little Nan Xun waved her little claws and couldn\u2019t speak clearly. Then, kissed the face of the small fresh meat and her saliva stained his face.Young Li Chen pursed his mouth and didn\u2019t speak, but his cold eyes became softer and he corrected her, \u201cCall me dad.\u201dThe handsome uncle stared at his son in surprise. He had never seen his son\u2019s tender side. Was this a father and daughter relationship?\u201cDa\u2026\u201d Nan Xun called and spat bubbles and her small palms patted his face.The little paws were chubby and soft. It didn\u2019t hurt when it hit his face.Li Chen was expressionless. He reached out a finger and poked Nan Xun\u2019s white, tender and bulging cheek, then poked it again and again, and then commented, \u201cSoft.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Nan Xun with her small face, turned a blind eye to that hand that kept poking and poking her face.Poke, poke!Come on, I\u2019m not a steam bun. Is it so fun to poke?Poke me again and I\u2019ll kill you.Li Chen got into the car with the baby in his arms. The car drove into the gate and along the road in the property for a while before stopping.After Nan Xun exited the car, her black eyes were almost blinded by the buildings in front of her.Does this huge castle-like villa belong to the Li family?Fuck, too luxurious!At the villa entrance, there stood two rows of big black bodyguards. When they saw Li Chen and Old Li, they bowed down to a 90-degree angle in unison, \u201cWelcome back master, young master.\u201dOld Li made a sound. Li Chen was cold-faced and walked straight to the door with the milk doll in his arms.\u201cMaster, master, this is\u2026\u201d The old housekeeper, Uncle Wang looked at Old Li.Old Li laughed, \u201cMy son\u2019s new daughter, my granddaughter.\u201dWhen Old Li was young, he had seen a lot of blood with his father. Maybe he had seen too much blood. He had no children until he was forty. Then, he trained him as a successor. Li Chen didn\u2019t live up to his expectations. He took over some of his industries at a young age, but he was too young and mature.Of course, Old Li hoped that his son would have many grandchildren, so his fourteen-year-old son had a one-year old daughter. He wasn\u2019t angry at all but was very happy.If it goes on like this, the Li family will be full of grandchildren in the future.Nan Xun opened her pair of big round eyes and tried to look at the young man holding her, and then patted his face.The void beast\u2019s voice suddenly sounded, \u201cDear, you just got smaller, did your IQ also got affected?\u201dNan Xun: \u201c\u2026I just want to beat him a few more times since I won\u2019t have the chance to fight when he blackens.\u201dThe void beast was surprised. \u201cHow did you know that little Li Chen\u2019s blackened value was less than 100? Little Li Chen\u2019s blackened value is now at 40 which isn\u2019t abnormal.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cIf it\u2019s completely blackened, how can he show such eyes towards me? It\u2019s just a person worthy of being a father. The tenderness mixed with indifference is really a fatal temptation.\u201dWith Li Chen\u2019s command, a servant soon prepared a beautiful princess room.The princess room was filled with fluffy plush dolls, which became an animal world. There were hundreds of diapers, milk powder and small clothes.On that day, little Nan Xun had a new name: Li Xiao Nan.Nan Xun likes it a lot because there was a \u201cNan\u201d character in it.Before long, the news spread, whether it was people inside or outside the circle, they all knew that the Li family had a daughter.Li Chen, at the age of fourteen was still a teenager, he like Li Xiao Nan very much at first sight. Li Chen, previously known as the cold-faced little king was now known as a super father since then. He has been in the limelight for several years.Nan Xun lives a life of clothes, mouth fed, and selling meng every day. It\u2019s been four years and she was now five years old. Little Nan Xun was so adorable with her pink and jade carved face which was lovely.\u201cLittle eight, how much evil value is there?\u201d Nan Xun, leaned her small head and looked sadly at the children\u2019s picture book.The voice of the void beast shriveled. \u201cLi Chen is clearly in favor of you. His evil value is still at 100. I\u2019m so angry!\u201dNan Xun asked strangely. \u201cYou say, my dad is young, how could he have an evil value worth 100? What did he experience when he was a child?\u201dThe void beast said, \u201cDo you know how old your father was when he used a gun? Five years old! Once the enemies of the Li family kidnapped your father. While kidnapping, your father took out a gun from his trouser pocket while the other party wasn\u2019t paying attention. He killed the man. Funny, those kidnappers thought the gun was a toy. He didn\u2019t even bother to hide it, oh~\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cI didn\u2019t understand before, but now it\u2019s clear that Li Chen and his father\u2019s love are rampant. Haha, he actually treats me like a pet.\u201dThe more Nan Xun thought about it, the more she thought she was a high-quality toy that he raised out of amusement.Li Chen was too mature, he had no childhood and doesn\u2019t know what toys were. So, Nan Xun\u2019s appearance filled in his missing childhood.Nan Xun sighed with a little sadness, \u201cI\u2019ve wasted four years in vain and I\u2019ve been played as a fool that\u2019s been teased by him\u2026\u201dAfter thinking about it, the void beast suggested: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just wear the host for another ten years?\u201dNan Xun: \u201cWould it be useful? Now, he treats me like a pet and toy. Will it be different ten years from now?\u201dThe void beast thought about it and suddenly its tone was startled. \u201cYou can\u2019t pat your ass in the bedroom for ten years! If we leave, who will stop your romantic father from creating a nest of younger brothers and sisters? I\u2019ll tell you, since you want to have a big boss with familial affection, you can\u2019t let anyone share Li Chen\u2019s attention, so you have to stop the birth of these younger brothers and sisters!\u201dNan Xun suddenly felt a little frustrated from hearing this. If Li Chen\u2019s evil value were worth a lot, wouldn\u2019t she have to wait until Li Chen couldn\u2019t have children?The void beast also took this into consideration. \u201cWell, let\u2019s stay until your eighteen. If you can\u2019t eliminate his evil value as his only daughter after so many years, let\u2019s leave early.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cBaby, I suddenly regret it. To use familial affection to develop the big boss, first we need to cultivate strong feelings before we can improve him. The world was destined to be doomed for a long time.\u201dThe void beast said, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019d better purify the big boss with the body in the next world.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had just completed his degree at the most powerful university in China. He was the CEO of the Li group while studying. Nan Xun felt that he wasn\u2019t a person, but a monster.The 18-year-old father Li Chen was very handsome. He had an eight pack and was in good shape.After taking a bath, father Li would come out with a bath towel wrapped around his hip. Then, he picked up little Nan Xun and stripped her.Nan Xun\u2019s little face turned black and she struggled in his palm with shame and indignation. \u201cDad, everyone is five years old, they can take a bath.\u201dLi Chen raised his eyebrows slightly and said. \u201cBaby, do you want to take a bath by yourself?\u201d He looked at Nan Xun\u2019s small arms and legs.Nan Xun\u2019s delicate little mouth, tooted, she was coquettish and sold meng. \u201cWhen people grow up, they will become ashamed and shy.\u201dHowever, the protest was ineffective. As usual, Li Chen carried Nan Xun directly into her small basin and personally wiped her body.Nan Xun: \u201cLittle eight, I\u2019m so ashamed. I\u2019m so old, this deadly pervert actually wants to bathe me.\u201dThe void beast snorted, \u201cFive years old, really old.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Nan Xun suddenly resigned and enjoyed the intimate service of the big boss.\u201cDad, my toenails are getting longer. You should cut them for me.\u201d Nan Xun raised her wet little chubby feet to his mouth, turned her round big toe in front of him to show him her toenails.Li Chen looked at her, took a dry towel to wipe her feet and then rubbed her small feet, \u201cEn, first dry baby\u2019s feet, dad will cut your toenails right away.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s big black eyes turned and asked, \u201cDaddy, do you think my feet stinks?\u201dLi Chen raised his eyebrows slightly. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stink. Dad just used soap to wash baby\u2019s fragrance.\u201dNan Xun whispered in a coquettish way: \u201cIf it\u2019s not dirty, then dad, you kiss it.\u201dFather Li Chen held the little foot, paused for a while, then really held it to his lips and kissed it.Nan Xun: \u2026Nan Xun was inexplicably very successful. Tell her that it didn\u2019t decrease the evil value, see that she will toss you to death!After taking a bath and cutting her toenails, Li Chen wrapped Nan Xun\u2019s small pink body with a bath towel, and then bent his fingers to play a tune on her forehead, \u201cNaughty.\u201dNan Xun hissed and said, \u201cDad, you hurt me.\u201dLi Chen glanced at her, took her to bed and laid down beside her.Yes, it\u2019s a bed.Nan Xun didn\u2019t want to say since she was one year old until five years old, Li Chen, a pervert slept with her on the same bed.Nan Xun suspected that the other side regarded her as a mobile pillow.\u201cDad, dad, you should tell me a story.\u201d Nan Xun pulled out a dozen fairytale books from the drawer and placed them directly to his face.Li Chen took the stack of books that his baby daughter covered his face with, pulled out a story about the ugly duckling and the white swan and directly recited it with a cold rigid voice, \u201cOnce upon a time\u2026\u201dNan Xun\u2019s little face collapsed, \u201cDad, you have already read this story more than fifty times.\u201dLi Chen directly changed it to a different fairy tale book.Nan Xun was satisfied and directly placed her little foot on his lower abdomen of his eight pack. Her small hand touched his Adam\u2019s apple and she went to sleep comfortably.She slept until dawn, Nan Xun sat up and blankly looked at the warm quilt besides her.Where was father Li Chen?She was dazed when a shadow fell over her.Li Chen touched the two small hairs on her head and dressed her in a white princess dress with pink flowers.Nan Xun turned a circle in front of the mirror and looked at the little person in the mirror, she was especially satisfied.\u201cDad, Dad, you comb two princess braids for me.\u201d Nan Xun directly handed the comb to Li Chen and positioned her little head next to him.Half an hour later.Nan Xun looked at the crooked pigtails in the mirror and almost cried.Li Chen grinned, \u201cDad really can\u2019t braid. I\u2019ll let Aunt Li do it later.\u201dNan Xun pursed her lips and shook her head, \u201cNo, although it\u2019s ugly, but dad combed it for me.\u201dLi Chen was accidentally stuffed with another mouthful of sugar. It was so sweet that his mouth curled slightly.Nan Xun said to little eight in her heart, \u201cLittle eight, thank you for giving me <<words collection=\"\" love=\"\" of=\"\">>. I found that the love words could be slightly changed and be used on daddy Li Chen.\u201d</words>Now, Li Chen had no blackening, it was good to coax him. Nan Xun felt that her skills to say words of love have improved.The void beast: \u201cHey\u2026you used it, ah, but the evil value has not disappeared at all.\u201dNan Xun also withered.Wasn\u2019t kinship enough to eliminate Li Chen\u2019s evil value? Or it wasn\u2019t important enough for him?Li Chen went downstairs while holding the little princess.On the long luxury dining table, Nan Xun sat next to Li Chen and old Li sat at the other end.\u201cGot up late today.\u201d Old Li glanced at the two people, small and big.Nan Xun immediately spoke for her father, \u201cGrandpa, grandpa, yesterday I begged father to tell me a story, so we were late today, don\u2019t blame dad~\u201dOld Li was amused by her and said, \u201cOh, what story did dad tell Nan Nan?\u201dNan Xun began to count with her fingers.Old Li was so happy that he squinted at Li Chen. \u201cLook at Xiao Nan\u2019s face, I won\u2019t care about you. Today, a general shareholder meeting will be held, you should be more energetic.\u201dLi Chen gave a faint hum and used chopsticks to bring green vegetables to his baby daughter next to him.When Nan Xun saw the green vegetables, her face changed. Then her eyes wandered and directly said to old Li, \u201cGrandpa, I want to eat carrot porridge in the evening, can we eat it together?\u201dOld Li glanced at Li Chen\u2019s dark face and was in a good mood. \u201cGood, listen to baby Nan Nan.\u201dNan Xun proudly raised her eyebrows. While her little mouth was covered with oil and water, she kissed his face and looked at him.She looked at Li Chen\u2019s handsome face covered with oil, water and saliva. Nan Xun was very happy.That evening, two guests came to the house, an old grandfather with his 17-year-old beautiful granddaughter.Nan Xun\u2019s mind suddenly sounded with little eight\u2019s voice, \u201cAlarm, alarm, this woman was one of your romantic daddy\u2019s lovers, pay attention to prevent.\u201dNan Xun was reading a picture book, when she heard this, her big eyes looked at the woman.Her chest was big and her waist thin, she wore light makeup, the body was sprayed with perfume, but it wasn\u2019t strong and didn\u2019t cause resentment. This might actually be daddy Li Chen\u2019s favorite dish.The old grandfather talked with old Li in the study, while this beautiful woman pestered her with father Li Chen. Although he didn\u2019t pay much attention to her, his eyes didn\u2019t show impatience.If it goes on like this, this woman will definitely hook up with him.Where would a man and pregnant woman remember that in the corner was a girl!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, she succeeded in standing on Li Chen\u2019s thigh, she held his neck in her hands and pointed her butt to the smiling woman.\u201cDad, Dad, you play with me, don\u2019t talk to this aunt.\u201dYu Manshan\u2019s delicate face with light make up stiffened, but she soon smiled again. \u201cIs this Nan Nan, she\u2019s so cute.\u201dNan Xun glanced back at her. \u201cOf course, I\u2019m cute. When I grow up, I\u2019m sure to look better than you.\u201dYu Manshan\u2019s smile froze again, \u201cHehe, of course, how could this aunt compare with little princess Nan Nan?\u201dLi Chen picked up Nan Xun and said goodbye, then took his baby daughter to the bedroom to play house.Yu Manshan sat alone in the huge living room, her face was very ugly.In the evening, the two stayed for dinner, so Nan Xun\u2019s request for carrot porridge was gone. The meal was very rich and healthy. There was no big fish and meat. Aunt Li boiled the gruel with preserved egg and lean meat and the soup with pork ribs and yam, she also fried several light vegetable dishes.Li Chen brought his chopsticks with vegetables to Nan Xun.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes widened.Did he do it deliberately? He knew she didn\u2019t like green vegetables, she wanted to eat meat, to eat pork ribs!Li Chen scooped a spoonful of congee with preserved eggs and lean meat from his bowl, blew it and fed Nan Xun.Nan Xun was angry and didn\u2019t want to eat it, but she happened to catch the shock on the woman\u2019s face who was named Yu Manshan. So, she was relieved and immediately opened her mouth and swallowed the porridge.Li Chen looked at his daughter\u2019s puffed cheeks. He couldn\u2019t help but poke it with his finger. He almost caused Nan Xun to squirt out her food.Nan Xun stared at him and caught him smiling, the arc from the raised corner of his mouth was evident that it wasn\u2019t flat.\u201cLi Chen gege, you shouldn\u2019t spoil Nan Nan.\u201d Yu Manshan smiled and leaned over to Li Chen. \u201cIf you pamper her like this, what would she do at school? If she can\u2019t take care of herself, she would be teased by her teachers and classmates.\u201dOld Li and Yu Manshan\u2019s grandfather were old friends. Although Li Chen has a daughter now, he was still alone. If they were together, the two would naturally enjoy their success.So, the two elders looked at each other with a smile on their face.Yu Manshan\u2019s closeness, Li Chen didn\u2019t explicitly refuse, but he didn\u2019t answer Yu Manshan.Yu Manshan was a little embarrassed and continued: \u201cLi Chen gege, believe me, my sister\u2019s children are often raised by me. I have more experience than you.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s little face stiffened and asked little eight, \u201cIs this woman suggesting that she would be a competent stepmother?\u201dThe void beast immediately replied, \u201cThis woman looks very smart and difficult to deal with. You make sure to nip your daddy Li Chen and her adultery in the bud!\u201dNan Xun listened to little eight\u2019s words and immediately pouted her small mouth, \u201cDad, will others really make fun of me? People are afraid.\u201d(TL note: she jumps to third person as \u201cpeople\u201d because she\u2019s too shy or doesn\u2019t want to lose face by referring to herself. This type of writing style is common in CN novels.)Li Chen\u2019s face became a little cold. He glanced at Yu Manshan and coldly said: \u201cNo one would dare make fun of my baby. My princess daughter can be as spoiled as she wants.\u201dAs soon as these words came out, Yu Manshan\u2019s beautiful face suddenly turned pale, while Nan Xun grinned triumphantly and revealed two small tiger teeth, which made her look so cute.Grandpa Yu\u2019s expression was also a bit ugly and old Li coughed awkwardly. \u201cEat dinner, sit down.\u201dWhen Li Chen saw his baby daughter ate a mouthful of oil, he frowned, picked up the wet towel on the table and wiped her little mouth.Nan Xun was very cooperative, it was convenient for him to wipe her mouth.\u201cBaby, don\u2019t eat meat so much, you should eat more vegetables.\u201d When Li Chen saw Nan Xun\u2019s little hand reached for the ribs, he couldn\u2019t help but frown.Nan Xun\u2019s face was like a little cute bun. She obediently gave up the ribs that she was about to pick and drank porridge.Nan Xun was full when she drank half of it. She pushed the half bowl of congee that had been eaten by her in front of Li Chen\u2019s face. The little face that was in front of him, immediately bloomed into a brilliant flower. The voice was sweet and genuine: \u201cDad, you didn\u2019t seem to have had enough. Why don\u2019t you drink my congee, okay?\u201dLi Chen looked at her bowl of porridge expressionlessly, he reached out and rubbed her head. \u201cBaby is really filial.\u201dYu Manshan, grandpa Yu and old Li: \u2026Nan Xun: \u2026Little eight said that Li Chen will build a nest of younger brothers and sisters for her later. Nan Xun didn\u2019t believe it at first, because Li Chen seemed too serious, but now\u2026 she blinked, come on, her swearing skills weren\u2019t strong enough, no wonder he provoked so many rotten peach blossoms and gave birth to a litter of babies.Nan Xun thought that she would have to block Li Chen from those many peach blossoms in the future and she was a little depressed. No matter how dissuaded she was, she picked up her chopsticks and went to pick up the ribs.However, Nan Xun\u2019s small arms and hands weren\u2019t long enough and the chopsticks weren\u2019t well controlled. She couldn\u2019t clamp down onto the rib long enough.Li Chen raised his eyebrows and watched without helping.Old Li wanted to help her, but he was stopped by his son\u2019s fierce eyes.Nan Xun was originally angry, but now she was teased by the rib. If she couldn\u2019t hold it, she stabbed it with her chopstick.Thud.A large bowl of pork rib soup was also poked by her and it flowed all over the table, because it faced Yu Manshan\u2019s direction, it flowed onto her beautiful clothes.Yu Manshan screamed and stood up quickly.The dress was light pink, and the workmanship was high-quality, she was afraid that it costed a lot of money.Nan Xun felt a little guilty in her heart, she used her shin to explore the ground, held the big chair under her buttocks and moved away from Li Chen. Unfortunately, before she moved half a step, she was hooked by daddy Li Chen and even the chair was hooked in front of him.Li Chen stared at her with a cold expression.Nan Xun whispered, \u201cDad, people wasn\u2019t intentional, otherwise, are you going to hit me?\u201dWith that, Nan Xun pouted her little chubby butt at him, indicating that he could spank.Li Chen\u2019s anger was suddenly gone, but he had a headache. He rubbed his forehead and took his naughty daughter into his arms. \u201cBaby, eat well, you didn\u2019t seem to have much just now.\u201dNan Xun blinked her big watery eyes, did she dare? Daddy Li Chen didn\u2019t plan to punish her at all, but he was worried that she didn\u2019t had enough?Yu Manshan\u2019s expression was very ugly and grandpa Yu wasn\u2019t much better and old Li was embarrassed.After the two left, Nan Xun smugly climbed onto Li Chen, rode his neck and held his head in her hands and said with a smile: \u201cDad, just finished eating, let\u2019s exercise, drive! Hyah! Come on, horse. Quickly, come on, come on!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, he grabbed the little girl\u2019s feet and stood up and said, \u201cHold it steady.\u201dThen, the big and small person went for a ride in the hall. From time to time, they could hear the little girl\u2019s giggling laughter.Old Li sat alone at the table and silently stuffed his heart.\u201cOld Wang, did I do something wrong? Old Li sighed.The old housekeeper Wang smiled appropriately. \u201cMaster, don\u2019t you think the young master is happier than before? If so, master, you did the right thing in the beginning.\u201dOld Li was still worried, \u201cBut you see what he did today, old Yu is an old friend of mine and I view his granddaughter very well. This Li Chen youngster didn\u2019t even give them face. Later, he won\u2019t be able to marry, and it would be impossible to have a family for Nan Nan\u2019s sake, right? What\u2019s more, Nan Nan isn\u2019t his offspring\u2014\u201dWhen he said this, old Li was worried and didn\u2019t continue, but old housekeeper Wang was silent next to him.No one would have thought that woman would have been courageous in the past. If it wasn\u2019t for old Li\u2019s strict routine to do a DNA check, it would have never been known that the smiling and noisy little girl in this room had no blood relations with Li Chen\u2026After the Yu Manshan\u2019s incident, Nan Xun consciously felt that the task was very important. She followed daddy Li Chen everywhere, so he wouldn\u2019t hook up with other women without her knowledge.So, everyone knew that Li Chen had a little tail that followed him. He used to hang out with some people within his circle every month, but now, he doesn\u2019t go anymore.This time it was Li Chen\u2019s close childhood friend, Zhao Minghao\u2019s birthday. Zhao Minghao held a private party in a bar called Twilight on his property, he invited his friend group to the gathering.Li Chen thought about his daughter at home that he had to take care of, so he immediately refused, but he couldn\u2019t stand to fight. Finally, he promised.\u201cDad, dad, I\u2019m tired of all my dresses in the closet. Let\u2019s go shopping.\u201d Nan Xun climbed onto daddy Li Chen who was working and left two saliva prints by kissing his handsome face.Li Chen put down his purchase plan, carried the baby into his arms and poked her bun face, then said, \u201cThe princess dresses in the closet are all customized by father\u2019s private master designer Java and were privately ordered. There are more than 100 pieces, baby, you still have half of them.\u201dWhen her lie was exposed, Nan Xun blinked her eyes and pouted her lips. \u201cI just want dad to go out with me. Dad is so busy and don\u2019t want dad to be too tired. We have a lot of money at home. Why does dad still work so hard?\u201dThe words weren\u2019t too sweet, and Nan Xun felt that she was really a nice little padded cotton jacket for daddy Li Chen, warm.Li Chen\u2019s eyes softened and reached out to rub the little girl\u2019s head.Nan Xun: \u201cShort oil, dad, don\u2019t rub, my hair will be messed up by you.\u201dLi Chen laughed lowly, and it sounded especially pleasant.\u201cDad, dad, will you go out with me or not?\u201d Nan Xun\u2019s little fat hand rubbed daddy Li Chen\u2019s handsome face into different shapes.Li Chen\u2019s image was destroyed, and he wasn\u2019t angry. He hugged her, kissed her delicate face and said with a smile, \u201cOkay, go now.\u201dLi Chen had never personally bought clothes for his daughter. They were all directly delivered by the private customized design master under his name. If it wasn\u2019t for the little girl to come up with this, he wouldn\u2019t have realized it. It happened to be Zhao Minghao\u2019s birthday party tonight and he bought a watch.If Zhao Minghao found out that his birthday present was incidental, he would cry himself blind.They went to the most prosperous business district in the city.Because cars weren\u2019t allowed to drive in the district, the driver Zhao lao1 parked the luxury limousine outside while Li Chen took Nan Xun around.Li Chen was a man with purpose. He glanced at Nan Xun and took her to a high-end building, and then went straight to the children clothing on the third floor.The decoration in this building was very luxurious, and all its luxury products sold were from big brands. Most of the people who come here to purchase were people with value.At this time, there were few people who visited the children clothing and usually they would be women. So, Nan Xun who was carved from jade and was flushed was very conspicuous with the handsome Li Chen.Although this whole street was Li Chen\u2019s industry, he had never been here before and wasn\u2019t familiar with it.Nan Xun looked at a diamond-encrusted white pompous dress in the window and tried to pull daddy Li Chen to have a look. Unexpectedly, at this time, little eight suddenly called out, \u201cAlert, alert, look inside that shop, there are countless little mistresses of daddy Li Chen and among them, there is one that is very difficult to deal with.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cDad, dad, let\u2019s not go into this store, let\u2019s go somewhere else.\u201d Nan Xun quickly said.Li Chen picked up his eyebrows. \u201cBaby, you clearly liked that puffy dress in the window. Why don\u2019t you want to buy it?\u201d\u201cPeople suddenly don\u2019t want to go.\u201d Nan Xun whispered.Nan Xun hurriedly took Li Chen\u2019s big palm and walked away until she saw an old salesperson in a store. She walked in with a sigh.The salespeople in this building were high-quality professionals. The salesperson in the shop didn\u2019t ask Li Chen what he wanted. When Li Chen chose a dress, she gave a simple explanation beside him and her attitude wasn\u2019t too attentive.Li Chen glanced at her and nodded with satisfaction. He will give the manager of this building a raise later.Not long after, Li Chen chose a small simple cut dress with smooth lines and asked, \u201cBaby, do you like this dress?\u201dNan Xun hurriedly said she liked it and went in to change into the little dress.The salesperson tried to go in and help, but Li Chen who was beside her went in.The salesperson was distracted for a moment, then thought that this father treated his daughter well. People who came to places like this were all from the upper class. Even women with children didn\u2019t necessarily change their children\u2019s clothes personally.After a while, Li Chen led Nan Xun out.The two stood in front of the floor-to-ceiling mirror and Li Chen said, \u201cCome on baby, turn around and let me have a look.\u201dNan Xun turned from the mirror with her small dress and sweetly said, \u201cDad, your eyes are good. I like it very much. Does dad think that I\u2019m beautiful?\u201d\u201cDaddy\u2019s baby is very beautiful.\u201d Li Chen touched her little head.The salesperson next to him smiled and said: \u201cYour daughter is really beautiful. This dress is very suitable for her.\u201dLi Chen slightly raised his eyebrows and accepted her praise.\u201cBaby, this one isn\u2019t bad, do you want to try it on?\u201d Li Chen soon picked another one.Nan Xun shook her head and sweetly said: \u201cDad, I like this dress very much. Save dad\u2019s money and only buy one.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s mouth was stuffed with sugar and he stroked his forehead helplessly, but the corner of his mouth was slightly hooked up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The salesperson took it respectfully and her hand trembled a little.Ah, diamond card.She guessed that the other party was a big man, but she didn\u2019t want such a big man. The person who owns the gold card in their building was very expensive. She didn\u2019t want this person\u2019s diamond card!The salesperson didn\u2019t expect that the next day, the shopkeeper would inform her of her salary increase, and it wasn\u2019t small.Daughter Nan Xun and daddy Li Chen happily went out of the building and Li Chen personally carried her newly bought dress.Before they could have gone far, Nan Xun\u2019s mind rang with little eight\u2019s voice, \u201cAlert! The woman in front of the shop is also one of your daddy\u2019s little lovers and it\u2019s his favorite flower!\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Now she wants to kill little eight, but also daddy Li Chen.Nan Xun didn\u2019t have time to find a way for Li Chen to take a detour, so they approached the woman who gave out flyers.The woman was very beautiful, she wore a bright yellow dress and had black stiletto heels, even the flyer was reduced to beautiful scenery.\u201cHello, sir can you support a donation to disabled children?\u201d The woman handed a flyer to Li Chen from her hand.Li Chen\u2019s good upbringing made him reach for the flyer. He glanced at the leaflet contents and couldn\u2019t help but raise his eyebrows.Nan Xun: \u201cIt\u2019s over. My brain can already see a lot of dog blood stories. The kind of compassionate poor girl that marries into a rich and powerful family, and from then on, young Li will throw away his money recklessly.\u201dThe void beast hurriedly said: \u201cDon\u2019t use your brain to mend it. Quickly stop it, wow!\u201dSo, Nan Xun quickly hugged Li Chen\u2019s thigh. \u201cDad, let\u2019s go back soon, I want to go home.\u201dNan Xun snuck a glance and saw that the smile on the woman\u2019s face froze after she called her father.So, after seeing her daddy Li Chen, did the woman\u2019s mind really moved?However, the woman\u2019s expression just froze momentarily, then she continued to smile, \u201cSir, I hope you can support our activities. It will be at 4pm this Saturday and it won\u2019t delay you too much.\u201dThe void beast snarled, \u201cI hear, it\u2019s about the time. It\u2019s just the evening after this activity. What can we do if the two suddenly have a one-night stand?\u201d\u201cAre women so difficult now?\u201d Nan Xun sighed.The void beast: \u201cYour father is a gold bachelor, ah, and a woman wants to take advantage. If she can be your stepmother, people will be happy. You better hurry and act, ah, it\u2019s just a matter of a sigh!\u201dYou\u2019re right. Come on, she just called out to her father. This woman wasn\u2019t dead yet. She even colludes in front of his daughter, was she dead?Nan Xun immediately took daddy Li Chen back and stared at the beautiful woman in front of her eyes. \u201cBad aunt, my father won\u2019t go. Why do you smile so brightly at my father? Do you want to be my stepmother?\u201dWith that, Nan Xun pounced onto Li Chen\u2019s thigh and cried out, \u201cI don\u2019t want a stepmother. I don\u2019t want a stepmother, dad, don\u2019t like these women\u2026\u201dLi Chen\u2019s eyes sank abruptly and coldly swept the woman. In front of her face, he crumpled the leaflet in his hand and threw it in the trash.After that, he rubbed Nan Xun\u2019s head and coaxed: \u201cBaby, don\u2019t be angry, dad doesn\u2019t like her, just like you.\u201dNan Xun rubbed her eyes, her big eyes were moist. There was a big golden bean that hung from the corner of her eye. \u201cDad really won\u2019t be taken away by other women?\u201dLi Chen held the little aggrieved girl in his arms and kissed the little pink face, \u201cAs long as baby loves dad so much, dad won\u2019t be taken away by others.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cFuck, he\u2019s so insidious. He\u2019s digging a trap for me. If I don\u2019t love him as much as I do now, he\u2019ll give me a nest of younger brothers and sisters.\u201dThe void beast quickly said, \u201cIt\u2019s not very simple to always love him so much.\u201dNan Xun poked the villain in her heart, \u201cBut I love him so much and not a single evil point decreased?\u201dAfter a moment of silence, the void beast thought: \u201cThis is a low-grade world, the spirit energy is too thin, so we can\u2019t spend too much time here. Let\u2019s change the original 18-year-old plan, if there aren\u2019t any changes in the next five years, it shows that it isn\u2019t feasible to use familial affection to change the big boss. Let\u2019s go directly to the next world to do some exercises.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Little eight\u2019s suggestion was scientific and reasonable. She was really speechless.Nan Xun quickly hugged daddy Li Chen\u2019s neck and intimately pasted her face against his and sweetly said: \u201cDad, dad, I am your baby sweetheart, I love you the most, and you should love me the most, only you can love me.\u201dLi Chen chuckled, \u201cDad promises you that dad only loves you.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Nan Xun looked at him with her pair of big clear black eyes.Li Chen looked at his shadow that was clearly reflected in the dark and bright pupils. His eyes couldn\u2019t help but soften a little. \u201cReally.\u201dThe two of them were displaying their father-daughter love as if there was no one else. Little eight suddenly cheered in Nan Xun\u2019s mind, \u201cDaddy Li Chen\u2019s evil thoughts has just dropped by 2 points. Oh, it\u2019s not easy to talk to each other!\u201dNan Xun silently pouted her lips. She poured a mouthful of sugar into daddy Li Chen every day. From the age of 1 to 5, it has dropped by 2 points over that time span? She simply kneeled to Li Chen.The beautiful woman who tried to steal a chicken only to end up losing the rice that was use as lure took a detour.Li Chen\u2019s long, narrow and sharp eyes suddenly squinted and said in a cold voice: \u201cStop, who allowed you to distribute flyers here? Later, roll.\u201dThe beautiful woman was dumbfounded, completely unaware that this cool handsome man could say such harsh and mean words. Besides, she didn\u2019t say anything just now. Even if she had any thoughts, it was very concealed. How could this man be so ungracious!It wasn\u2019t long before the store manager from the store behind them came in a hurry. He humbled and pleaded that he wouldn\u2019t let these people go to the business district to distribute leaflets in the future.Then the beautiful woman was taken by the two security guards that the manager sent and was gone\u2026The woman was lively, she completely lost her original elegance and scolded the entire time.Nan Xun was very happy when she was held by Li Chen who had a cold face. Today, she pinched off two peach blossoms from daddy Li Chen.After they returned home, Nan Xun climbed to the dining table and waited to eat.Suddenly she thought of something and Nan Xun immediately said: \u201cDad, I want to eat fish head.\u201dShe felt that it would be a headache to deal with Li Chen\u2019s many rotten peach blossoms in the future and she had to make up for it.Li Chen rubbed her little head and immediately ordered it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nan Xun had a lot of fun playing horse-riding.Ze ze1, this feeling of riding on the big boss shouldn\u2019t be too comfortable. Such good welfare must be enjoyed in this world.After playing enough, Li Chen began to read Nan Xun a storybook. Nan Xun laid on her flat and strong stomach, kicking her calves.\u201c\u2026and the pig mother and pig father lived happily together.\u201dAfter Li Chen finished the 20th storybook, he rubbed the little girl\u2019s hairy head helplessly. \u201cBaby, dad has read 20 storybooks. Aren\u2019t you sleepy?\u201dHe was going to coax the little baby to sleep and then leave, but this little girl was too smart and clever. It seemed that he was going to go out, so he read 20 stories and she didn\u2019t yawn. Her big watery eyes stared at him.Li Chen thought for a moment, put aside the 21st storybook that the little girl had in her hand and coaxed, \u201cBaby, dad wants to go out, you go to sleep first and when dad comes back, will bring you a gift.\u201dNan Xun said, \u201cWhen you bought a dress for me today, I saw father bought a watch as well. Dad, are you leaving me to go out to meet your secret lover?\u201dLi Chen cried and laughed, \u201cBaby, who taught you this? Father isn\u2019t a lover and has no little lover.\u201dNan Xun patted him on the face with a little slap. \u201cWho said dad didn\u2019t have a little lover? I am dad\u2019s little lover, and daughter is dad\u2019s last lover.\u201dLi Chen raised his eyebrows and said in a good mood: \u201cEn, your father\u2019s little lover, father just wants to go to a friend\u2019s birthday party and come back shortly.\u201dNan Xun didn\u2019t give up, \u201cI don\u2019t care, dad can\u2019t leave me. I\u2019ll go wherever you go!\u201d\u2026\u2026Twilight was a very high-end bar, located in the most prosperous street. There were basically two types of people who go there to spend, one was people with a face and were the second generation of the rich, the other were some upstarts and the second generation of upstarts.And this famous Twilight was owned by one of Li Chen\u2019s childhood friends \u2013 Zhao Minghao and his old man who opened it.After Li Chen took his daughter into the private room, the noisy private room suddenly went dead.Everyone stared wide-eyed at the little doll who was pink and carved from jade embraced within young Li\u2019s arms.Like water, it was tender, and the watery pair of eyes looked at them curiously, the chubby lips were puckered slightly, and they whispered something to his ears.The little grim king of hell had a cold and hard face was well-known in the circle, but the facial lines were softened at once.Fucking hell!This, this was really Li Chen?Not a ghost?\u201cDad, Dad, why did the handsome uncle reach into the beautiful aunt\u2019s clothes?\u201d Nan Xun blinked and pointed to the man in the middle of the room, or the young man, because he looked 18 or 19 years old.Li Chen looked at Zhao Minghao from her little tender fingers, and his face suddenly darkened. He immediately covered Nan Xun\u2019s eyes with his big palm.Zhao Minghao was a little embarrassed. He quickly moved his hand from the pure-looking girl\u2019s dress.\u201cZhao Minghao, it seemed that I told you before I came here that there shouldn\u2019t be idle people in the private room. Do you take my words as a whisper?\u201d Li Chen\u2019s face was as cold as ice.The others in the private room were silent and were afraid to say a word.Although everyone present were second generation rich people, they were really nothing compared to the Li family. Yes, not to mention the fact that this was young Li, who has been doing great things with Mr. Li since he was 12 years old, it was totally different from those dandies who only knew how to eat, drink and play.Although Zhao Minghao mingled, he couldn\u2019t stand his friendship with Li Chen. He hurriedly retired some woman from the room and said with a smile, \u201cBrother Chen, this friend was wrong, I originally thought you were opened to dirty people. I didn\u2019t know you cared about this kind of thing. I didn\u2019t think that the little princess would have also attended. I\u2019ll punish myself with one cup, ha ha.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s face was a little better. He handed him a box and lightly said, \u201cBirthday present.\u201dZhao Minghao removed the packaging and saw the high-end diamond inlaid watch inside. He couldn\u2019t help but blow out a loud whistle. \u201cBrother Chen is so generous.\u201dLi Chen held Nan Xun in his arms and sat in the corner of the room. He glanced at all the people and said, \u201cIf you like, I\u2019ll sit down and go.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t, young Li. You haven\u2019t been here for long, brother. I\u2019ve managed to invite you here today. Can\u2019t you join us for more drinks?\u201d Zhao Minghao happily said.Zhao Minghao took the lead and the atmosphere became active, others also started to heckle.Zhao Minghao directly blinked at little Nan. \u201cMy little princess, today, advise your father to accompany us to drink a few more cups?\u201dNan Xun rolled her eyes. \u201cDad can\u2019t drink too much. You have to drink by yourself.\u201dWhen they heard this sweet answer, they laughed.\u201cI say, young Li, where did you pick up such a sweet little doll? It\u2019s not like you at all. She\u2019s so cute. Hahaha\u2026\u201dLi Chen glanced at him. \u201cMy own daughter.\u201dLi Chen took his daughter to sit for a while then left, which was supported by Zhao Minghao.After waiting for the person to leave, the room quickly exploded the opened pot.\u201cThis was really young Li, right? I think I may have met a fake young Li!\u201d\u201cThis time I saw young Li\u2019s legs shaking the entire time, how come I feel that young Li is amiable this time?\u201d\u201cSo amiable, did you forget last time\u2026\u201dAlthough Li Chen only sat for a while, there was Zhao Minghao. He poured a glass of wine with a high degree.Nan Xun\u2019s wine tolerance was actually very good, but the body that little eight found was worse than her original. Now, this little doll was worst. She was a little drunk just by smelling the wine in daddy Li Chen\u2019s mouth.Li Chen looked at his daughter\u2019s little red face within his arms, he couldn\u2019t help but poke it and pinch it.\u201cBaby, you don\u2019t feel well?\u201d Li Chen pinched the little face that was a little hot and couldn\u2019t help but frown.Nan Xun slapped the face in front of her, then pinched his nose and said, \u201cDad, you made me drunk.\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201d Zhao lao, the driver in front of her, couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Suddenly, he felt that his back was a little cold and Zhao lao was afraid and didn\u2019t dare speak out.Li Chen with a dark face, got out of the car halfway to buy a piece of fruit cream cake with a peach heart painted on top.\u201cDad, why did you only buy one piece? People wants to eat.\u201d Nan Xun wasn\u2019t happy.Li Chen directly took a fork and fed it to her, \u201cBaby, let\u2019s eat together.\u201dNan Xun looked at the fork in daddy Li Chen\u2019s hand, that is to say, share a fork?Nan Xun ate the small cake, and the small mouth licked the fork back and forth.With so much saliva, shouldn\u2019t daddy Li Chen be disgusted?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He directly placed the cake with the fork into her big open mouth and she ate very well.The two took bites and the small cake was soon almost eaten.The last piece was left, and Nan Xun held the fork and scooped it towards Li Chen\u2019s mouth. \u201cDad, this is the last piece, you eat it.\u201dIn fact, she couldn\u2019t eat it, her stomach was too small.\u201cBaby is really filial. Father is very happy. Why not\u2026half for both of us.\u201d Li Chen said.Li Chen was a very strict person. When he said half, he meant absolutely half. Nan Xun clearly saw that he had eaten the last piece of peach on the cake, but he spat out half of it.Nan Xun sighed in her heart. \u201cLittle eight, why is he so unhygienic? Does he want me to eat the other half of it?\u201dThe void beast\u2019s words were meaningful and heartfelt: \u201cFor his evil value, bear it. It\u2019s just saliva, you\u2019re not eating poison.\u201dLi Chen forked the remaining cake with the half of piece of peach to Nan Xun. \u201cCome on baby.\u201dNan Xun was directly watched by him and her heart was hairy. Although she didn\u2019t have a serious cleanliness OCD, come on, there was the other\u2019s saliva on it. Now the big boss was waiting for her. If she makes the other party think that she dislikes him, she would be ruined, and all her efforts would be destroyed.Nan Xun ate the cake with a whimper, and she bit the half of piece of peach with Li Chen\u2019s slobbered saliva.It was already late in the evening when the two returned to the villa, Nan Xun laid on her stomach on the large bed.\u201cDad, you press me.\u201d Nan Xun\u2019s head turned and saw an arm lying across her little butt.Li Chen fished her into his arms and turned over. The two of them were stacked together and became a pyramid.\u201cDad, dad, I\u2019m so sleepy, but people haven\u2019t brushed their teeth and washed their faces yet.\u201d Nan Xun laid on her stomach, with her little arm leaning against her head to look at him.\u201cLet\u2019s go baby, let\u2019s go wash together.\u201d Li Chen picked up little Nan Xun.Nan Xun softly held his neck and yawned, \u201cDad, don\u2019t go out at night. Let\u2019s go to bed early.\u201d\u201cWell, listen to baby.\u201dAfter entering the bathroom, Nan Xun consciously moved her small stool to the washstand and stepped onto it to see the big mirror in front of her.Li Chen squeezed the strawberry-flavored toothpaste for her and the two people, one big and one small, brushed their teeth in front of the mirror.Brush to the left, to the right, their actions were exactly the same.After brushing her teeth, Nan Xun showed her teeth in the mirror. \u201cDad, my teeth are so white.\u201dLi Chen gave her a small smile, wiped her face with a towel, and washed her feet carefully. \u201cLet\u2019s go baby, go to sleep.\u201d\u2026\u2026Li Chen\u2019s relationship with his daughter was getting better and better, but old Li was getting more and more worried.He looked at Li Chen going to the company and taking Li Xiao Nan as usual and old Li coughed, \u201cLi Chen, let Nan Nan stay at home. She\u2019s at the age where she can\u2019t sit still. When you are busy at work, you can\u2019t take care of Nan Nan, she would get bored. Besides, Nan Nan will have to go to elementary school in a year or two. She wasn\u2019t willing to go to kindergarten, but she has to learn some simple lessons so she can make progress and catch up.\u201dBefore daddy Li Chen could speak, Nan Xun immediately said, \u201cGrandpa, I can even do first grade addition, subtraction and multiplication, so I don\u2019t want to study. Li Xiao Nan is a genius.\u201dLi Chen touched her head and said to old Li: \u201cBaby will follow me, she\u2019s smart.\u201dThen Li Chen didn\u2019t say anything and took Nan Xun\u2019s cartoon schoolbag in one hand and Nan Xun with his other hand. The father and daughter happily went out the door.Old Li felt very tired.The old housekeeper smiled and said, \u201cMaybe the master is too worried. Now the little miss is still young, it\u2019s hard for the young master to spend more time with the little miss. When the little miss grows up, they won\u2019t be as sticky as they are now.\u201d\u201cI hope\u2026\u201d Old Li sighed.Li Chen was working in the office, while Nan Xun sat quietly drawing, she looked well-behaved.Today, Li Chen went to a conference meeting and little Nan Xun followed him. She dragged her chair and placed it beside daddy Li Chen\u2019s seat. She climbed and sat properly, then took out a book from her schoolbag, took out crayons, placed it upright, and took a red crayon and began to scribble on the paper.On the table sat two rows of department managers in suits and their eyes fell on the little girl in pink carved from jade.Until the sharp and cold eyes swept the crowd, the people quickly looked away.\u201cPresident Li, the sales for last month\u2026\u201d One person dryly opened his mouth and the crowd began to get down to business.This meeting will likely last all day and Nan Xun\u2019s little butt hurt from sitting. No way, there were too many departments in this company and daddy Li Chen was the leader who was personally involved with everything.For the whole day, Nan Xun who had nothing to do, drew a whole book full of little people, there was nothing but an adult holding a little doll. It was very ugly, the adult\u2019s head was as big as his body, his mouth was a straight line and his eyebrows were two diagonal lines that were picked up.Not to mention, although it was ugly, but that very image, people could tell at a glance this adult was Li Chen.\u201cBaby waited for a long time. Dad\u2019s business is finished, we can go home.\u201d Li Chen picked up little Nan Xun with one hand.Nan Xun\u2019s voice was a soft whisper: \u201cDad, I sat for the whole day, my butt hurts, I also drew for the whole day, my arms ache.\u201d\u201cBaby worked hard. When we return, dad will rub you.\u201d Li Chen said.\u201cThank you, dad. Dad is very good.\u201d As she said this, Nan Xun hurriedly handed Li Chen the book that she had drawn in for the whole day. \u201cDad, it\u2019s for you, there is dad and me all inside. I drew dad handsomely.\u201dNan Xun felt her filial piety moving. If Li Chen\u2019s evil thoughts aren\u2019t reduced, then it was really difficult.Li Chen took the drawing book, smiled for a moment, then opened the book to look at it carefully.\u201cDoes dad think I drew well?\u201d Nan Xun asked.Li Chen rubbed her head silently, his eyes were deep and difficult to distinguish, his voice low. \u201cGood, very good.\u201dNan Xun was a bit puzzled. Shouldn\u2019t Li Chen be moved to tears? What\u2019s with this reaction? Isn\u2019t it too dull?At this time, little eight suddenly spoke up and was excited: \u201cYour daddy Li Chen\u2019s evil value was just reduced by 10 points!\u201dNan Xun was also a little excited. It really wasn\u2019t easy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She planned to give a gift to daddy Li Chen if she has nothing to do in the future. It must be hand-made by her, which could move him.Time passed by very quickly. Nan Xun attended elementary school in a blink of an eye. Nan Xun felt that it was too painful to go to primary school with a group of little radish heads. She begged Li Chen to not attend elementary school.Li Chen also wanted to keep his daughter by his side, if it was allowed. Of course, old Li disagreed. In the end, it was decided that she must attend elementary school, junior high school and high school.When Li Chen was 28 years old, most of his family\u2019s industries were transferred to him. Old Li wanted to have a leisure time. This year, little Nan Xun, who was fifteen years old, was a sophomore in high school, she had jumped two grades in junior high school.Nan Xun, who had already become a little beauty, was on the bed and sighed.\u201cLittle eight, what\u2019s the evil value?\u201d\u201cThe evil value is at 50.\u201d The void beast said.\u201cIf I remember correctly, the evil value last dropped years ago to 50. In the past three years, not a single point dropped?\u201d Nan Xun wanted to die.The void beast was silent for a while and said: \u201cIt\u2019s only lowered by 50 points and became saturated. It seems that it isn\u2019t feasible to use familial affection towards the big boss. Let\u2019s wait for another three years, after that, if it doesn\u2019t work, let\u2019s leave.\u201dNan Xun raised both her hands and feet in approval. No wonder, little eight reminded her in the beginning to not lose herself. Any world in which she stays for more than ten or twenty years, she wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference what was true and false. If she wasn\u2019t careful, she might not be able to leave the play once she entered.Her goal was to go back to the real world, then go to the first world again to find her egg son.It was a clear goal.\u201cBy the way, I forgot to tell you something.\u201d The void beast suddenly said, \u201cDaddy Li Chen\u2019s blackening value hasn\u2019t changed for a long time. Today, it grown by 5 points and became 45.\u201dNan Xun snorted, \u201cWhat does it got to do with me?\u201dSuddenly she heard footsteps, Nan Xun immediately got out of bed and looked at the man whose upper body still dripped with water and was only wrapped in a bath towel around his waist. Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but look at him more.This figure, tut tut1, she wasn\u2019t tired looking at it for so many years, and that face, which has completely faded from its youth, had become mature and charming. He was so handsome that it was unreasonable, and his figure was so unreasonable as well.Li Chen directly walked over naked. Nan Xun patted the spot beside her and sweetly said, \u201cDad, I\u2019ll warm you up under the covers.\u201dNan Xun has her own princess room, but she has never slept in it once. She has been sleeping with daddy Li Chen all these years. But come on, she was a girl. She used to try, and sleep separate every time, but daddy Li Chen\u2019s face would turn black and she didn\u2019t dare say.This time, when Li Chen got into bed, Nan Xun, who was very ashamed, pointed out again, \u201cDad, I\u2019m 15 years old this year and I\u2019m grown up. We can\u2019t sleep together in the future.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s hands stretched out and took her into his arms, his voice sank. \u201cBaby, isn\u2019t obedient again, huh?\u201dNan Xun struggled for a while and found that she couldn\u2019t break away, so she laid in his arms, coughed softly and her tone was as gentle as possible. \u201cDad, all the students in class sleep by themselves and I sleep with you when I\u2019m so big, I will be laughed at.\u201d\u201cBaby, do you think classmates are more important or your father?\u201d Li Chen asked, and his eyes were slightly narrowed.Nan Xun quickly said: \u201cOf course, dad is important! My classmates are just friends that I study together with, but my dad is my relative who will accompany me when I grow up. Father will always rank first in my heart.\u201dLi Chen touched her head with satisfaction. \u201cObedient.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026So, that topic he casually dodged?\u201cDad, one more thing, I\u2019m so big, can you stop sending people to protect me?\u201d Nan Xun said that it was protection, but come on, it was disguised surveillance. She had already discovered the two people secretly staring at her.The people sent was discovered by his daughter, Li Chen was somewhat surprised. After all, he was very clear about his people\u2019s abilities. After his surprise, he stopped by and waved two or three thousand dollars. \u201cBaby, whatever dad does, it\u2019s for you.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Fucking hell, it really was a universal excuse that people couldn\u2019t refute.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t convince Li Chen, so she closed her eyes and went to sleep. Forget it, tomorrow she will continue to fight for her self-interest. It seems that Li Chen wasn\u2019t in a good mood today?She didn\u2019t do anything today, but she received a love letter during the day.Was this the cause of his anger?But she didn\u2019t even look at it and threw it in the trash. Even if she looked at it, it was nothing. At the age of 15 or 16 was the time that young boys and girls were in love, even in ancient times, they began to talk about marriage. Her daddy Li Chen was too fussy.Nan Xun sighed in her heart and fell asleep.When Nan Xun fell asleep, the man next to her looked at her face, his eyes and complexion were deep.It seems that his baby has grown up and knows to be shy.However, he wasn\u2019t happy with normal things.Unhappy, Li Chen hugged the girl who slept like a pig in his arms.Nan Xun was dead asleep, when she woke up the next day, Li Chen was already dressed and sat beside the bed. The whole person stared at her in a measured way that scared her.She looked again and daddy Li Chen\u2019s eyes were normal, nothing unusual.Li Chen handed Nan Xun\u2019s skirt to her, \u201cPut it on and come down for the meal. Aunt Li has breakfast ready.\u201dNan Xun took the clothes and waited for him to go out.However, Li Chen didn\u2019t move and sat still on the bed, his eyes were heavy.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes were dark and somehow was a little flustered. \u201cDad, if you don\u2019t go down, the food will be cold.\u201d\u201cBaby, wants to leave father, en?\u201d\u201cDad, I\u2019m not leaving you, but I\u2019m too big and want some privacy.\u201d\u201cDad has never had privacy with you, but now you want to talk to dad about privacy?\u201d Li Chen said in a deep voice.Nan Xun said, \u201cDad, you can\u2019t say that. You don\u2019t let me know much about your work, humph.\u201dLi Chen looked at her half-quietly and suddenly said, \u201cInteresting, dad knows.\u201dWith that, he turned to leave.The bedroom door was loudly slammed shut.Nan Xun was a little confused. What does Li Chen mean by interesting? What does he know?The more she thought of it, the more she panicked, and Nan Xun cried to little eight, \u201cLittle eight, is he abnormal? I\u2019m so old and his daughter. He wants me to sleep with him. I wanted to wait for him to leave so I can change clothes, but he wasn\u2019t willing. Why wasn\u2019t he willing?\u201dAfter thinking about it, the void beast replied, \u201cYes, I think your daddy Li Chen is a pervert, but then again, when haven\u2019t we met someone who wasn\u2019t a pervert?\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just wanted to wait for dad to leave so I can change my clothes, but dad says that I want to be separated from him and got angry.\u201dThe more Nan Xun said, the more reasonable she felt, and the more abnormal Li Chen was.When Old Li heard this, his smile faded. He looked at Li Chen and said: \u201cIn my opinion, Nan Nan is really grown up. Later, you will sleep separately.\u201dLi Chen didn\u2019t answer and directly said to Nan Xun: \u201cNan Nan, dad has something to deal with, you come with me.\u201dNan Xun, oh, then quietly stuffed her mouth with rice.Today was the weekend and there was no class. Nan Xun changed into a white puffy dress that was pinched at the waist. She wore a pair of snow-white customized sneakers, her hair was made into a ball. She looked young and beautiful, her genes were good. She was so beautiful as if she was a sculpture carved from jade. Her eyes were full of water and she was especially smart.Li Chen looked at his big baby daughter and took the initiative to reach for her waist with his big hand.Nan Xun was also used to it and didn\u2019t feel that it was strange.Only that old man Li saw how they got along with each other from behind, his pair of eyes stared at his son. When the father and daughter left, he stood up trembling on his crutches.The old housekeeper who stood beside him, hurriedly helped him. \u201cMaster, you\u2019re\u2026\u201dOld Li\u2019s lips squirmed a few times before he asked, \u201cWang lao, you say, do you think that Li Chen already knows that Nan Nan isn\u2019t his daughter?\u201dThe old housekeeper seemed to have realized what Master Li was worried about. He looked surprised and paused, then said, \u201cMaster, even if the young master really found out, but the young lady is already big, how could he have other thoughts? But the young lady is still so young, how could the young master\u2026\u201d\u201cNow she\u2019s small, but isn\u2019t she grown up? Don\u2019t you see Li Chen\u2019s strong possessiveness for Nan Nan right now! He thought that I didn\u2019t know that he sent people to watch Nan Nan\u2019s every move at school?\u201dThe more he thought about it, the more worried he was. He was his son, although sometimes he couldn\u2019t figure out his thoughts, but he knows that once he wants something, he will obtain it by all means. What he was good at was to let his prey fall into the trap slowly and finally swallow it.Nan Nan has been calling him grandpa for so many years. How could he bear to see a pure white flower be destroyed by a hungry wolf? Even though his son may not know that they weren\u2019t blood-related, Nan Nan doesn\u2019t know. In her heart, Li Chen is her father!Old Li decided to find time to have a good talk with them later.Nan Xun didn\u2019t know where Li Chen was taking her, because the car drove more and more off the road and finally stopped on a street in a certain town.This time, there were four bodyguards that followed them. The big man in black bowed to open the door. When Li Chen went out first, Nan Xun was about to follow him out, but Li Chen princess carried her out, scared, she quickly held the other\u2019s neck tightly.\u201cDad, I\u2019m not a child. Why do you still hold me like this?\u201d Out of the car door, Nan Xun quickly jumped down from him.Li Chen didn\u2019t speak, he directly walked into the restaurant in front of them with her waist in his arm. The four bodyguards in black closely followed them.The restaurant was large, but there was no one inside, it seems as if it had been cleared beforehand.Nan Xun felt a little strange and wondered why Li Chen took her to such an isolated place. According to Li Chen\u2019s deep-rooted cleanliness, he seldom patronized such a restaurant that wasn\u2019t very sanitary at first glance.As soon as Li Chen entered, a middle-aged man came up respectfully and whispered: \u201cYoung Li, people have already been caught and is underneath.\u201dDuring the conversation, he snuck a glimpse at Nan Xun and saw that Li Chen held the girl\u2019s waist. He was a little surprised, he heard that young Li was never close to women, was this rumor wrong?But this little girl at present was too tender, did young Li actually like this kind of girl?The middle-aged man silently recorded this in his heart.Li Chen said, \u201cLead the way.\u201dThe man quickly nodded, \u201cCome with me.\u201dYoung Li took Nan Xun\u2019s hand and told her in a low voice, \u201cBaby, I\u2019m watching you, so be obedient.\u201dNan Xun nodded, especially obedient.The restaurant had a basement, and the person in front led the way. A group of people walked in from a side route.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes widened in surprise when she saw the scene inside.This was actually an underground casino!There were several gambling tables, and there were still gambling cards on the table that hadn\u2019t been cleaned up yet. All the lights were on and every corner was clearly illuminated.In the empty space, a man in his thirties was bound with rope and knelt on the ground, with a wad of cloth in his mouth.\u201cHmmmm, hmmmm.\u201d The man saw young Li and the man looked excited and tried to crawl his way to him but was kicked to the ground by the man in black from behind.\u201cYoung Li, this way please.\u201d The middle-aged man took the lead and made a gesture of invitation.Right ahead, there was a soft leather upholstered chair that was placed there earlier and young Li sat down.Nan Xun originally intended to stand, but unexpectedly, Li Chen took her directly in his arms and let her sit on his lap.Nan Xun moved awkwardly and finally simply nestled in his arms and tried to shrink her sense of existence.Li Chen slightly raised his right hand, and someone immediately took out the rag from the man on the ground.Although the man had trouble speaking easily, he immediately pleaded for mercy: \u201cYoung Li, you are a person of great moral stature who doesn\u2019t remember the offenses committed by one of low moral stature, let me go this time. I won\u2019t dare do it again. Please let me go, young Li, don\u2019t lose face for this father. Let me go, I won\u2019t dare anymore\u2026\u201dNan Xun was stunned and looked at the man incomprehensibly, then at her daddy Li Chen.Come on, he was a gangster. Now this scene looks like a scene from TV where the gangster boss was betrayed by his younger brother. Then, the boss was prepared to shoot the traitor.A little scared, a little excited, what\u2019s going on?With a lively attitude, one of Nan Xun\u2019s arms consciously was placed on Li Chen\u2019s neck and she sat in a more comfortable position.His baby\u2019s dependency and intimacy towards him made Li Chen very happy, but he doesn\u2019t know later\u2026if his baby will be as close to him as she was now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The industry of the Li family has been washed white for a long time. Now, I\u2019m in charge of the Li family, but you slap my face.\u201dThe voice was plain and had no emotional fluctuations, but it was more terrible than seeing his thunder and anger.Thump.The man, while begging for mercy, his head was slammed onto the floor and blood soon broke out from his head.Li Chen suddenly got up. He placed the girl in his arms on the chair to sit down. He walked slowly towards the man and looked down at the disobedient person.When the middle-aged man who led the way, saw him reach out, he immediately handed over a two-inch long knife.Young Li tested the blade with his fingertip, it bled after a slight stroke.Very sharp.When the person on the ground saw the knife in his hand, he shrank back in fear.Li Chen slowly approached him and squatted down. The high-quality customized leather shoes shined in the light and it stopped in front of the man.Li Chen slowly approached him and softly said, \u201cLook at your father\u2019s face, I will personally do it, so that other people won\u2019t be clumsy and hurt you.\u201dAfter a pause, his eyes narrowed slightly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t take your life.\u201dWith a wave of the man\u2019s arm, a silver light flashed through the air.\u201cAh\u2014\u201d The man screamed.The knife hit the palm of the man\u2019s hand, it stabbed him in different directions, it twisted back and forth several times.The sound of flesh and blood being cut was clearly visible.With a plop, the man pulled out the knife again, the blood splattered on his face.He didn\u2019t care, he skillfully picked out the man\u2019s tendon, then threw the knife to the ground.With a thump, the bloody knife fell to the ground and bounced.A clean brocade handkerchief was immediately given to the man.The man took it, wiped the blood stains that accidentally splashed onto his face. Finally, he carefully wiped his hands that weren\u2019t stained with blood and didn\u2019t miss a single finger.The dirty brocade handkerchief was thrown to the ground and covered the bloody knife.Li Chen looked at the girl sitting on the soft chair who looked at him. He went over and rubbed her head tenderly. He asked in a very gentle voice, \u201cBaby, are you scared?\u201dNan Xun swallowed her saliva gently, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dAfter all, she was a person that witnessed the Demon King killing and devouring people. She was just a little surprised. In her eyes, Li Chen was always her father who was cold on the outside and gentle in the inside. But this quick and accurate scene completely overturned her impression of Li Chen.His big palm kneaded her head intimately. Yes, it was this same one, just a second ago, it had pierced the man\u2019s palm and picked out the tendon.Nan Xun always felt that she had only seen the tip of the iceberg, so she thought the gentle touch on her head would make her hair grow.Nan Xun suddenly hugged Li Chen and muttered: \u201cDad, let\u2019s go home, I want to go home.\u201d\u201cOkay, listen to baby.\u201d Li Chen paused and his mouth slightly curved.He was a bit surprised. In this case, his baby child approached him first and didn\u2019t pushed him away but took the initiative to hug him.The small physique was shaking, and he didn\u2019t know if she was scared.Li Chen carried her on his back and went out.Nan Xun exclaimed and quickly said: \u201cDad, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have legs. Why do you always hold or carry me? You always do this, you\u2019re going to make me too lazy to walk by myself in the future.\u201dLi Chen chuckled, \u201cDad thought your legs were soft. If baby doesn\u2019t want to walk in the future, dad can carry you for a lifetime.\u201d\u201cWhat dad said, it should be the opposite. In the future, when dad gets old, I will carry dad for a lifetime.\u201d Nan Xun immediately said.Nan Xun felt that she was very intimate, but he didn\u2019t want to listen, instead his handsome face turned black.Li Chen asked gently, \u201cBaby, do you think dad is old?\u201dNan Xun felt that Li Chen was very childish, but he was the big boss. She said everything correctly and quickly replied: \u201cDad, of course you\u2019re not old. Dad is only 28 years old and is still fresh meat. Besides, dad is the golden bachelor that all women wants to marry, dad is very handsome. I have never met a more handsome man than dad, even a famous supermodel can\u2019t compare with dad\u2026\u201dLi Chen\u2019s face was a little better, but he felt entangled about what she just said. \u201cDoes baby think dad is older than you?\u201dNan Xun dumbly looked at him. Did Li Chen have a fever? How could he ask this kind of brain-damaged question?Could it be that she stimulated him with this sentence? He didn\u2019t want to get old?Nan Xun thought for a moment and said, \u201cDad, people are always getting older. Dad is 13 years older than me. When dad gets older, I\u2019ll also get older\u2026\u201dLi Chen shoved her into the car and the two drove away quickly.Previously, the middle-aged man who led the way bowed the entire time until the car was far away, then he straightened himself and wiped the cold sweat on his forehead.Today, young Li only took the man\u2019s single hand, this didn\u2019t match his usual style at all. If it was in the past, it wouldn\u2019t have been as simple as one hand.The man frowned slightly. Later, he heard the girl called him dad, then he knew the girl\u2019s identity. It turned out to be young Li\u2019s treasure, which he was afraid would melt in his mouth\u2014Young Li\u2019s attitude wasn\u2019t raising a daughter, but rather to raise a little mistress.Nan Xun and Li Chen fought for a long time in the car. Suddenly, she thought of something. Nan Xun quickly grabbed his hand and found his blood-beaded finger.\u201cBaby, it\u2019s okay, it\u2019s just a small injury\u2014\u201d Li Chen suddenly stopped halfway, because his baby suddenly placed his finger into her mouth.The hot and damp package made Li Chen\u2019s eyes darkened and deepened.Nan Xun sucked, then took out his finger and said with a smile, \u201cOh, dad, it\u2019s not bleeding now.\u201dLi Chen looked at her, his eyes were so rough that Nan Xun\u2019s heart was uncomfortable.Nan Xun hurriedly asked little eight in her heart, \u201cDid I do something so bad that Li Chen discovered that I\u2019m trying to please him, so he\u2019s not happy?\u201dThe void beast yawned, \u201cThink more, I can feel daddy Li Chen\u2019s blood boiling, he should be happy.\u201dNan Xun was a little surprised. \u201cLittle eight, you could feel other people\u2019s happiness, anger and sorrow?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Li Chen was very happy, because he pinched Nan Xun\u2019s face intimately and softly said, \u201cYou\u2019re really father\u2019s good girl.\u201dWhen he said this, his sexy lips were slightly upturned. Nan Xun who observed his words for many years, knew that this kind of smile would only appear when Li Chen was in a very good mood.Nan Xun\u2019s mood suddenly picked up and quickly said: \u201cDad, I\u2019m so good, could you be better towards me?\u201dLi Chen raised his eyebrows. \u201cIsn\u2019t dad good to baby now?\u201d\u201cOkay, but I think dad could be better towards me.\u201d Nan Xun smiled and said. It\u2019s better to get rid of all the evil value at once.Li Chen touched her head with a soft expression, \u201cOkay.\u201dAt this moment, the atmosphere was just right. She heard little eight yawned, so Nan Xun was infected and yawned also. Just when she was about to close her eyes and have a rest, she suddenly heard Li Chen said, \u201cBaby, dad has no privacy with you now.\u201dNan Xun took a second to react and realized it was the sentence she had said previously.What the fuck, she dared said she wanted privacy this morning, Li Chen still remembered until now?\u201cBaby, so you can\u2019t have privacy with dad.\u201d Li Chen said, his tone wasn\u2019t a question, but a firm affirmation.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t understand Li Chen\u2019s thoughts at all. She didn\u2019t have any independent space to be rebellious. She just wanted to sleep on her own bed. Come on, why couldn\u2019t Li Chen agree?\u201cLittle eight, was it because I clung to him all these years and didn\u2019t let him find a woman, that it broke him into a pervert who likes to sleep with his daughter?\u201d Nan Xun was frightened.If so, she would be guilty.The void beast thought about it and exclaimed: \u201cIt\u2019s extremely frightening to think about it. How many years has it been since he found a woman? Fuck, let\u2019s not talk about it, I think it\u2019s really possible!\u201dWhen Nan Xun heard his analysis, she thought it was horrible. She immediately asked, \u201cWhat should I do then? Do you think the reason that his evil value hasn\u2019t dropped was because I need to mingle in his sexual life?\u201dThe void beast thought deeply, \u201cYou can try to find a flower for you to understand.\u201dSo in the evening, while they laid in bed chatting, Nan Xun pondered and said her thoughts quickly.Li Chen held her in his arms and held an English book with his other hand. He read English text to Nan Xun.When she was a child, it was a storybook. Now, it was an English book. Nan Xun felt that her own strength had improved by more than one grade.When Li Chen spoke English with his low voice, Nan Xun thought it was much better than a lullaby.Before she dozed off, Nan Xun poked Li Chen\u2019s abdominal muscles with her finger to signal him to stop.Li Chen turned to look at her, \u201cEn? What\u2019s the matter baby?\u201dNan Xun tangled her words softly: \u201cDad, I feel sorry for you.\u201d\u201cOh? Why did baby say this all of a sudden?\u201d Li Chen put down the book from his hand and his expression was serious.Nan Xun became more and more guilty, she said, \u201cFather is a young man now, but because of me, father never looks at those women, these years, didn\u2019t I restrain father?\u201dLi Chen\u2019s face slowly darkened.Nan Xun, who focused on adjusting her expression, didn\u2019t pay attention and continued: \u201cWhen I was small, I wasn\u2019t sensible, I always pestered father. Once father talks to any woman, I would become very unhappy because I was afraid that father would be robbed, but now that I\u2019m older and sensible, father has the right to pursue happiness. I won\u2019t obstruct father in the future. If you see any woman that excites you, marry her!\u201dNan Xun finished and looked up.What the fuck!Why was Li Chen\u2019s face so black?The void beast suddenly called out, \u201cI just took a nap. What happened? Why did you suddenly increase the blackened value of daddy Li Chen by 10 points!\u201dNan Xun was also confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I acted accordingly to our discussion earlier. I just suggested that daddy Li Chen go find a woman and he turned black.\u201dLi Chen suddenly reached out and touched Nan Xun\u2019s little face. \u201cBaby, do you really think so?\u201dNan Xun said in her heart: Didn\u2019t she just showed her sincerity?Nan Xun nodded, she seriously and honestly said: \u201cDad, I really think so. I\u2019m not angry or joking with you. I can\u2019t let dad give up his happiness for the rest of my life. Although I will take care of dad, it\u2019s different naturally.\u201d\u201cHow is it different?\u201d Li Chen asked.Nan Xun began to count with her fingers. \u201cA wife can warm the bed, give birth to children, cook and wash clothes for you.\u201dLi Chen replied with her own words: \u201cBaby, you can also warm dad\u2019s bed. As for children, you\u2019re enough for dad. Aunt Li can cook and wash clothes.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Come on, how could it be the same? She, as a daughter, warmed the bed for Li Chen, just like other women. How could it be the same!However, Nan Xun was raised by Li Chen to be very simple and stupid, which made it impossible for her to ask such a question.Fortunately, Li Chen didn\u2019t ask again. He rubbed her head and lightly said, \u201cI heard baby\u2019s opinion, go to sleep.\u201dHis eyes suddenly became very deep at a certain moment, and a ray of moonlight came through the window and shined on his face, it made his dark eyes turn into a silver light, it looked a little cold.Nan Xun wanted to continue to express her position, but little eight suddenly cheered, \u201cDear, dear! Wow, you just made a fortune! A fortune! You just suddenly made daddy Li Chen drop his evil value by 15, 15 points! This is the biggest drop in so many years! Hahahahahaha\u2026.\u201dNan Xun was also very happy. It seemed that this event has promoted the continuous reduction of evil value. Li Chen was afraid of hurting her, so he had never found a woman. Now that she had expressed her attitude, Li Chen can find his happiness at ease.Nan Xun closed her eyes and went to sleep happily. As soon as she was in a good mood, her sleeping posture relaxed. She placed a calf on Li Chen\u2019s thigh and her arm was also across his chest. He didn\u2019t know what she dreamt of in the middle of the night, but she smashed her little mouth.Li Chen looked at her from the side, and his eyes fell on her pink lips for a long time.He gently removed Nan Xun\u2019s arms and legs, then walked alone to the window to breathe.Just now, he suddenly understood why he wasn\u2019t happy recently.Li Chen lit a cigarette and sat alone beside the edge of the bed. He quietly looked at the girl on the bed who slept through the night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, there were so many things to deal with behind the scenes and the president must listen to the scenery.With Li Chen\u2019s absence, Nan Xun breathe a sigh of relief. She quickly changed her clothes and went to the bathroom to wash.When she was almost downstairs, Nan Xun could smell the scent of milk and bread.On the big dining table, there were two breakfast plates. Grandpa, uncle Wang and aunt Li wasn\u2019t present.Nan Xun frowned doubtfully and heard some noise from the kitchen, she quickly ran over.\u201cDad?\u201d Nan Xun looked at the busy person in the kitchen and felt like a ghost.Li Chen has always been someone who didn\u2019t need to fend for himself, but unexpectedly was frying an egg?Li Chen looked back at her and said, \u201cBaby, it will be ready in a minute. You go eat the bread first, the bread was freshly baked by dad.\u201dNan Xun said with amazement: \u201cDad, you can cook? But why are you cooking today? Where\u2019s aunt Li?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with aunt Li\u2019s family, so I gave her a day off, but don\u2019t worry baby, dad won\u2019t let you be hungry.\u201dNan Xun asked again, \u201cBut dad, grandpa and uncle Wang are gone, where did they go?\u201dLi Chen continued to explain, \u201cYour grandfather was asked by an old friend to go fishing and uncle Wang went with him.\u201dNan Xun mumbled, \u201cWill dad go to the company later? Today I still have homework, so I can\u2019t go with dad.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s action paused and said: \u201cToday is the weekend, dad doesn\u2019t need to go to the company. Ready to take you out to have fun.\u201dNan Xun was surprised, Li Chen was a workaholic. He usually goes to the company even on the weekends. Today, he said that he would take her out to have fun?Suddenly, the void beast chimed in, \u201cGood opportunity, it\u2019s the easiest way to cultivate feelings when you go out and play!\u201dNan Xun thought the same, so she happily hugged Li Chen from behind. \u201cDad, you found your conscience. Tell me, how long has it been since you\u2019ve taken me out to play? When I was a child, you took me to the zoo once and nothing else!\u201dLi Chen held the small hands on his waist and kissed it. \u201cBaby, dad was wrong. Later, dad will accompany you more.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s heart and liver trembled. She felt that it was strange that Li Chen kissed her fingers, so she asked little eight, \u201cWhy did Li Chen kissed my fingers, ah?\u201dThe void beast replied, \u201cYou forgot, he\u2019s a pervert. Perverts do things differently from ordinary people. Whatever, why do you care, just reduce the evil value.\u201dNan Xun was convinced by little eight that she was only here to eliminate Li Chen\u2019s evil thoughts, but why were there so many other matters.On the dining table, Nan Xun had a fragrant dish. She gave Li Chen a thumbs up while she ate. \u201cDad, the bread you baked is delicious and the fried eggs are especially tender.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s eyes contained a smile. \u201cIf baby likes to eat, dad will make you breakfast in the future.\u201dNan Xun hurriedly shook her head. \u201cThat\u2019s not good. I can\u2019t bear to let dad get tired. He\u2019s so tired from working every day, better to sleep longer in the mornings.\u201dLi Chen looked at her, suddenly reached out and wiped her lips with his thumb. He cheekily looked at her face and said: \u201cDrink milk and it\u2019s all over your mouth.\u201dNan Xun cried out ah, then quickly pulled out her tongue to lick her lips. \u201cIs this all right dad?\u201dLi Chen\u2019s eyes fell on the little pink tongue. His eyes dropped and he suddenly looked away. He replied absent-mindedly.After the meal, Li Chen asked Nan Xun where she wanted to go. Nan Xun said she wanted to climb the mountain, so they changed into casual clothes.Nan Xun wore a simple white dress with sneakers and Li Chen wore an inner white shirt with a casual navy-blue coat as his outerwear, his hiking shoes were the same color as Nan Xun. His short hair that was usually styled was scattered messily.When they looked in the mirror, Nan Xun was amazed. She couldn\u2019t help but wow, \u201cDad, you look so young, like a handsome young man in his early twenties. You are so handsome.\u201dLi Chen pinched her nose. \u201cDad isn\u2019t old.\u201dNan Xun held Li Chen\u2019s shoulder in one hand and made a poss in the mirror and said with a smile: \u201cDad, you see, we look like an ideal couple. The way we dress as if we wore matching outfits for couples, ah, while we walk on the road, it\u2019s 100% certain to turn heads.\u201dLi Chen looked at himself and the girl in the mirror, he slightly hooked his lips and whispered, \u201cYeah, it does.\u201dBecause they only had one day, they went to a famous scenic spot in the city, it was a ten-mile-long mountain road that had green mountains and clear water, wildflowers and beautiful scenery.Nan Xun had a stupid camera around her neck while Li Chen carried dry food and water for the two people.Nan Xun ran two steps and returned, she stood from a high vantage point and smiled brightly at Li Chen. \u201cDad are you tired?\u201dLi Chen took several strides to catch up to her. He picked her up, twirl her in a circle and let her go.Nan Xun hurriedly begged for mercy. \u201cI\u2019m wrong. I\u2019m wrong. Dad\u2019s energy is good. I shouldn\u2019t have questioned dad.\u201dA little couple passed by and saw them, the girl covered her mouth and smirked, then reached her boyfriend with her arm. \u201cHow nice to see someone\u2019s boyfriend to climb the mountain with his girlfriend on his shoulder. Wow, tall, handsome and considerate.\u201dHer boyfriend\u2019s face was suddenly bitter. \u201cAncestor, can you stop. That boyfriend is so strong, how could I compare to him?\u201dThe girlfriend gave him a scornful look and asked strangely. \u201cHow did I hear that girl call that man dad just now?\u201dThe boyfriend suddenly revealed a meaningful expression and whispered, \u201cHave you seen a father in his early twenties? Do you understand? Some people like to play like this.\u201dHis girlfriend immediately grabbed his arm and twisted it. \u201cDad, let\u2019s continue to climb.\u201dThe boyfriend laughed and replied: \u201cHey, let\u2019s go, big girl.\u201dLi Chen had good ears and listened to the couple clearly. He looked at Li Xiao Nan and found that she was using the camera to take pictures of everything. She didn\u2019t notice what they were talking about.Li Chen rubbed his forehead and sighed.Because of their strength and stamina, they finished climbing the mountain in half a day. Nan Xun held Li Chen\u2019s arm and asked, \u201cDad, I\u2019m very happy today. Are you happy?\u201dLi Chen nodded, reached out and straightened the hair on her face that touched her lips. He said with a light smile: \u201cDad is very happy too.\u201d\u201cDad, it\u2019s still very early. I don\u2019t want to go back. Shall we go somewhere else?\u201d Nan Xun held his waist and looked up at him and smiled like a little sun.\u201cEn, where does baby want to go?\u201d Li Chen hooked her face with his finger and asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I want to go to the shooting range to learn how to shoot. I think the shooting posture is so cool!\u201dLi Chen slightly raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt turns out that baby is interested in this.\u201dLi Chen took Nan Xun to the biggest shooting range in the city, where boss Wu obviously knew him well. The boss led him to shooting range No.5 with the best position and provided him with his usual desert eagle.Nan Xun looked at the silver pistol that daddy Li Chen held in his hand, itching to touch it.The shooting range owner chatted with Li Chen for a while. After he glanced at Nan Xun, who was eager to try, he clearly smiled and said, \u201cYoung Li, have fun. I have something else to do, so I won\u2019t disturb you.\u201dBoss Wu walked off to the distance and couldn\u2019t help but look back. He happened to see an innocent and pure girl who approached and held Li Chen\u2019s arm. Li Chen actually indulged her, they talked and laughed. An intimate and sweet atmosphere could be felt from far away.Zeze, this cold-faced little king of hell was close to a woman and actually likes this kind of taste. Look at that person, unexpectedly was young. In order to please the little girl, he was attentive.Boss Wu thought if he had time, he could look for two more. Since he has meat, Li Chen wouldn\u2019t care about one or two. Just a moment ago, that girl was a special thing. He couldn\u2019t find anything better than that girl for a while\u2026\u201cBaby, you should step back first and let dad give you a demonstration.\u201d Li Chen then raised the desert eagle with one arm.The man\u2019s arm crossed a beautiful arc in the air, just extended into a straight line, without hesitation, he shot three times, the bullets hit the bullseye, all of them at that single point.Nan Xun cried how cool her daddy Li Chen was, most people wouldn\u2019t bother to fight. He was so fierce that he actually picked up the gun and fired it and it all hit bullseye. This shooting method was too cool!\u201cCome on, baby, come to dad.\u201d Li Chen reached for her.At this time, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but worship him. When she heard this, she immediately ran to him and hugged him. \u201cDad, you were so cool just now. I\u2019ve became your fan!\u201dLi Chen smiled and couldn\u2019t hold back, he lowered his head and kissed the tip of her nose.Nan Xun stared blankly and fucking immediately asked little eight in her heart, \u201cLittle eight, why did Li Chen kiss me?\u201dThe void beast yawned, \u201cI\u2019m so sleepy, kiss you, he\u2019s your father. Why can\u2019t he kiss you? It\u2019s just a kiss on the tip of your nose, it\u2019s not a kiss on your mouth.\u201d\u201cSo, dad can kiss me on the tip of my nose?\u201d Nan Xun\u2019s voice couldn\u2019t help but rise.\u201cYes, father and daughter kiss. Don\u2019t you know that other fathers and daughters from other families are like this?\u201d The void beast said unconcerned.Nan Xun\u2019s cute face said, \u201cI really don\u2019t know. This older sister since childhood never had a father.\u201dThe void beast smiled and happily said: \u201cSo, you see how good I am to you. I knew you lack a father\u2019s love, so I chose this world to let you experience it. How does it feel to have a father\u2019s love?\u201dNan Xun thought for a moment and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, this feeling of being loved dearly since childhood is good. A child with a father\u2019s love is like a treasure while a child without a father\u2019s love is like grass.\u201dWhile she nagged, Nan Xun had already grasped the gun and aimed at the target to shoot.\u201cBaby your posture is wrong.\u201d Li Chen said and suddenly leaned.His right hand wrapped Nan Xun\u2019s hand that held the gun. The other hand held Nan Xun\u2019s waist and his face was close to her face.Nan Xun clearly felt the temperature from his face and the palm that held her waist. Even though the contact was separated by a layer of clothing, she could feel the heat radiating from the palm.Nan Xun suddenly panicked, this, was this really normal?\u201cBaby don\u2019t be distracted. Look at the target.\u201d Li Chen said with a deep voice.\u201cAh? Oh!\u201d Nan Xun didn\u2019t dare to think about it. Daddy Li Chen was such a gentleman. She was ashamed of the thought that passed through her mind. Her thoughts were so dirty.\u201cKeep your feet apart, about shoulder width. That\u2019s right. Don\u2019t stand on your feet so tensely, relax, let your toes loosen naturally. Aim at the target, now, shoot!\u201dWith a bang, Nan Xun felt her hand was shaking slightly, but the big hand tightly wrapped it. When the bullet shot out, her hand didn\u2019t shake.\u201cDad, I shot it! I hit the bullseye!\u201d Nan Xun jumped excitedly, only to knock her head on the person\u2019s chin behind her.Nan Xun immediately reached out to rub and said, \u201cDad, does it hurt? Let me rub it for you.\u201dLi Chen took her into his arms and reached out to her little face and said, \u201cBaby it won\u2019t hurt if you blow it for dad.\u201dNan Xun agreed, then raised her head and gently blew on his chin.\u201cDad, bend over, ah, I can\u2019t reach you.\u201d Nan Xun saw that he didn\u2019t move for a long time, so she placed her hands around his neck and pulled his head down.Li Chen\u2019s hands encircled her slender waist and looked at his baby\u2019s cheeks blowing his chin. The air was fragrant, part of his nose was inexplicably intoxicated.The two were unaware of how ambiguous their posture was. Looking from a distance, it appeared as if they were kissing.As a result, the real estate big shot chief Ma who came over from the side was frightened.Just now, he heard Wu lao mentioned that the Li family\u2019s kid was here, so he wanted to come over and get familiar with him. Unexpectedly, he witnessed such a scene.The woman he held in his arms wore delicate makeup. After looking, she was stunned. Then she smiled, \u201cChief Ma, didn\u2019t you say that young Li wasn\u2019t close to women? My eyes are opened with you today. Here, they are intimate, look at that figure, that woman is very young, no more than 18 years old.\u201dChief Ma loosened and said, \u201cRong Rong, you wait for me here. Young Li\u2019s face isn\u2019t easy to see, this is an opportunity.\u201dLi Rong Rong nodded and smiled at him: \u201cI know you guys like to talk about business. Go ahead and play with me some other day.\u201dNan Xun was cultivating affection with daddy Li Chen and didn\u2019t expect a bald uncle in his fifties to come over.She felt that Li Chen wasn\u2019t happy that they were interrupted.\u201cYoung Li, long time no see.\u201d The man smiled.Li Chen patted Nan Xun\u2019s back. \u201cBaby, you practice here first. Dad will come see you in a moment.\u201dNan Xun nodded cleverly, \u201cHave a good talk, don\u2019t get angry.\u201dLi Chen couldn\u2019t help but smile. His baby could see that he was in a bad mood?\u201cOkay, listen to baby.\u201d Li Chen hooked her nose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It seems that this girl was treasured to the point of a magnificent house built for a beloved woman.Li Chen gave him a meaningful look and the two changed scenery to talk about things, which wasn\u2019t far from here.Nan Xun recalled the essentials that Li Chen just said and had a good time with the gun.\u201cGood shot.\u201d Suddenly a voice called out.Nan Xun turned around and saw a woman with heavy makeup and looked a little familiar.Nan Xun\u2019s memory was bad, but thanks to the palace drama that she watched recently, she recalled that one of the leading actors who played the ruthless queen was in front of her!\u201cYou, you are Li Rong Rong?\u201d Nan Xun exclaimed. She saw a real star for the first time. This kind of close contact made her feel very strange.\u201cI like the TV series you acted in very much. I think your acting skills are very good.\u201dLi Rong Rong was stunned at first, then smiled. \u201cI thought you wanted to scold me. You know, I\u2019m in public now, if people recognize me, they all want to throw rotten eggs.\u201dNan Xun also smiled, \u201cIt shows that you have good acting skills. Some viewers are too involved with the drama and think that you\u2019re a bad woman.\u201dLi Rong Rong\u2019s smile was lighter. \u201cI\u2019m not a good woman at all.\u201dWith that, she pointed to the bald uncle who was talking with Li Chen and said, \u201cSee, that\u2019s my financial backer.\u201dThe little girl\u2019s eyes were full of surprise and Li Rong Rong didn\u2019t take it seriously: \u201cYou know, it\u2019s useless to have acting skills and looks in the entertainment circle. I\u2019ve been playing soy sauce in the entertainment circle for more than ten years, and I\u2019ve wasted my time from nineteen to thirty now. Finally, I got a part that\u2019s a leading role in this drama because of Chief Ma.\u201dAfter a pause, she asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you look down on me?\u201dNan Xun shook her head, she calmly and frankly said that she found a financial backer. She thought that this Li Rong Rong was different from those women that wanted money.Nan Xun asked: \u201cSince the entertainment industry is so chaotic, why don\u2019t you quit?\u201dLi Rong Rong said with a smile: \u201cActing is my life. I like acting. If I don\u2019t act, I will feel that something is missing in my life.\u201dNan Xun hesitated for a moment and said, \u201cBut that Ma is a little\u2026old.\u201d She originally wanted to say that he was old and ugly.Li Rong Rong laughed out. \u201cBig younger sister, you are straightforward. Do you know what the sisters in the same trade say? They say that I really have a good eye, and I found Ma to become my financial backer.\u201dNan Xun heard the slight ridicule from her words.Li Rong Rong continued: \u201cAlthough I got mixed up with him, we just get what we need, he wanted a gentle lover and I wanted the resources for acting, that\u2019s all.\u201dThen, she reached out her hand and patted Nan Xun on the shoulder. \u201cBig younger sister, I can see that you are not one who climbs the dragon and follow the phoenix, but\u2014\u201dShe paused and lowered her voice. \u201cYoung Li isn\u2019t a good person. You may have just entered this circle and aren\u2019t clear about young Li, he\u2026in short, you should withdraw as soon as possible.\u201dNan Xun opened her mouth. Did Li Rong Rong had something wrong with her brain? She actually thought that she\u2026But she thought that Li Chen was very good, why did Li Rong Rong said that Li Chen wasn\u2019t a good person. \u201cBig younger sister, this has my phone number on it. If you have nowhere to go one day, come to me.\u201d Li Rong Rong handed her a simple business card.Nan Xun tried to explain that she wasn\u2019t Li Chen\u2019s little lover. But the person turned around and left.At this time, Chief Ma and Li Chen had finished talking. Chief Ma walked over and left holding Li Rong Rong\u2019s shoulder. Li Chen also came over.\u201cBaby, what are you looking at?\u201d Li Chen moved skillfully around her waist.Nan Xun showed him the business card. Suddenly, she came up with a new idea and said, \u201cDad, our family is also engaged in the entertainment industry, can we dig up Li Rong Rong, ah?\u201dLi Chen slightly raised an eyebrow, \u201cDoes baby like her?\u201dNan Xun said with a smile: \u201cYes, I think her acting is very good. I just don\u2019t know why she always play supporting roles, even if she plays the leading role, it\u2019s always the villainess. People on the road wants to throw rotten eggs at her. Dad, how well do you think her acting is that makes people hate her so much?\u201dLi Chen nodded subconsciously and said: \u201cOkay, it\u2019s just a person. What baby wants, dad will get for you.\u201dAt that moment, Li Rong Rong wasn\u2019t aware at all, but because she said a few words with a girl, her life dramatically changed in the future, with numerous high-quality scripts and announcements that came one after the other. Together with her own effort, before long, she became the film empress.Li Chen and Nan Xun had dinner outside before they went home. Old Li had already returned and sat in the hall and looked at the father and daughter who returned hand in hand.\u201cNan Nan, you go upstairs first. I have something to say to your father.\u201d Old Li\u2019s expression was very serious.Nan Xun couldn\u2019t help but look at Li Chen.Li Chen gently patted her back. \u201cBaby go up first. Dad will come in a minute.\u201dNan Xun nodded and went upstairs. Before she left, she didn\u2019t forget to say to old Li, \u201cGrandpa, today I asked dad to go out with me. Don\u2019t blame dad for being absent from his job without permission.\u201dOld Li didn\u2019t look at her angrily. \u201cI know. I won\u2019t make your father look like I\u2019m his stepfather.\u201dNan Xun laughed twice and ran to the bathroom on the second floor to take a bath.In the hall, there was only two people left, old grandpa Li and Li Chen.Old Li first looked at Li Chen\u2019s clothes and couldn\u2019t help but purse his mouth and muttered: \u201cI really think that dressing up like a youth makes you look like a youth, humph.\u201dOld man Li knocked his cane against the ground. \u201cSit down, I have something to ask you.\u201dLi Chen directly sat opposite of him, his legs overlapped, one arm rested on the sofa chair and an invisible aura suddenly rolled out.\u201cDo you want to talk about Nan Nan?\u201d Li Chen asked right to the point.Old Li was angry with his contemptuous attitude and his voice directly raised by a degree, \u201cStinky boy, tell yourself what you\u2019ve done today? When Laozi was away for one day, you give me such big news. Now everyone in the circle knows the big news that you\u2019re hiding a delicate little girlfriend. Laozi is really infuriated with you!\u201dLi Chen looked at him for a long time and saw the old man began to panic.\u201cThere\u2019s more than this, isn\u2019t there?\u201d Li Chen\u2019s voice was faint.Old man Li gasped and sulked. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not going to beat around the bush. Let me ask you what you think. Nan Nan is your daughter, is your attitude towards her the same as towards a daughter?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He stared for a long time and saw the old man looked guilty.\u201cSon of a bitch, you actually dare pressure Laozi!\u201d Old Li was annoyed.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to pretend in front of me. I know better than anyone if I touched that woman.\u201d Li Chen said.Old Li\u2019s eyes widened and glared. \u201cYou, you stinky boy, what do you mean? You didn\u2019t have a fling with that woman 16 years ago? You knew from the beginning that Nan Nan wasn\u2019t your daughter? You knew and brought her back? Li Chen, what the hell are you doing?\u201dLi Chen reached out and unbuttoned two buttons from his shirt and lightly said: \u201cI thought that I had a father-daughter relationship with that child, so I took it back and raised it. It was originally for fun. I casually thought I wanted to raise my feelings. I thought it would be nice to have more than one daughter, but now\u2026I changed my mind.\u201dOld Li was scared. \u201cLi Chen, you have to think clearly, even if you two really have no blood relationship, but Nan Nan was raised by you alone. In her heart, you\u2019re her biological father. If you act willfully, you will ruin her!\u201dLi Chen suddenly called his father which scared him again. When he called for his father seriously, he knew that his son had something to say that couldn\u2019t be stopped even by an emperor.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about our business. I raised her. I know her better than you.\u201d Li Chen said this sentence, then changed his shoes and went upstairs.Old Li didn\u2019t hold back. Before he disappeared, he quickly stopped him and reminded him in a low voice, \u201cLi Chen, Nan Nan is still small. You, you should pay attention to propriety and don\u2019t frighten her.\u201dLi Chen made a sound and couldn\u2019t wait to go upstairs.Li Chen gently pushed open the bedroom door. The girl in the bed had already taken a shower and changed into pajamas.Nan Xun heard the noise and quickly stood up and looked at him. \u201cDad hurry up and take a shower. You\u2019ve been out playing with me all day.\u201dLi Chen came over, sat down beside her on the bed, reached out his hand and pinched her face. \u201cBaby, I thought you were asleep.\u201dNan Xun yawned and said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m worried about dad. I was afraid grandpa taught you a lesson, so I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u201cGood girl.\u201d Li Chen touched her face, leaned over and gently dropped a kiss on her lips.Nan Xun was shocked. Although it was just a touch, Li Chen just kissed her. This time, it wasn\u2019t her nose, but her mouth!\u201cHehe, little eight, come out for a while. You said that kissing on the nose was normal. Now what? Li Chen even kissed my mouth!\u201dIt took a while for the void beast to reply, but he answered, \u201cJust now, I overheard the conversation between daddy Li Chen and your grandpa and discovered a great secret that I can\u2019t tell you right now. I\u2019ll tell you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cNow say it!\u201d\u201cIf I say it now, you won\u2019t sleep well tonight.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cThen let\u2019s talk about it tomorrow.\u201dThe void beast: \u2026\u2026In fact, it was ready to tell her.After Li Chen kissed Nan Xun, he went to take a shower. After a while, Nan Xun went back and laid down. She was also in the mood to pick out an English storybook and placed it beside her. She waited for Li Chen to finish his shower to read it to her.But Nan Xun fell asleep before Li Chen returned.Li Chen\u2019s body still had water droplets. He sat on the bed and looked at Nan Xun, his eyes radiated with a heat that was never seen before. After a long time, he reached out and took the book out of the girl\u2019s hand, then he got into bed and skillfully embraced her into his arms.Nan Yan muttered twice, one leg directly wrapped around his waist, one hand around his neck and her little face was attached to him.Their breathing entangled, the breath was hot.Li Chen took a deep breath, turned his head over and whispered, \u201cDaddy\u2019s baby, hurry up and grow up\u2026\u201dThe next day, Nan Xun finished her breakfast and was ready to go to school while Li Chen was also ready to go to the company.\u201cBaby, you really don\u2019t need dad to send you?\u201d Li Chen asked.Nan Xun quickly shook her head, \u201cDad, don\u2019t send me anymore. As soon as your extended luxury car arrives at the gate, I\u2019ll be surrounded and watched like I\u2019m a giant panda. Please spare me.\u201dWith that, Nan Xun sweetly said, \u201cDad, I\u2019ll go first, bye~\u201dLi Chen grabbed her, leaned slightly, and turned his face to her. \u201cBaby, did you forget something?\u201dNan Xun turned rolled her beautiful eyes, slightly stood on her tiptoes, looked up and gave him a big kiss on the face. \u201cDad, you really, how old are you? You have to have a goodbye kiss.\u201dWaiting for the little girl to leave, she looked far away from the door, old Li sneered, \u201cNot ashamed, also actively asks for a kiss.\u201dLi Chen glanced at him and said, \u201cAre you talking about yourself? When you\u2019re old, you still peep at a young man and little girl kiss goodbye.\u201dOld Li angrily got up and said, \u201cMy, pah, young man, shameless.\u201dLi Chen put on his coat and carelessly said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the company. If you\u2019re bored, you can go back with your old friends and fish for flowers again.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t good to mention this, when Old Li heard this, his face changed. \u201cI\u2019ll never be fooled by you again. Yesterday, you set me up to do something so you can do things with Nan Nan. I\u2019m not going anywhere in the future!\u201dLi Chen lightly said, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Then left.Old Li was so angry that housekeeper Wang on the other side hurriedly comforted him. \u201cWhy are you doing this? Don\u2019t you know the young master\u2019s temper.\u201dOld Li snorted, \u201cI don\u2019t want this boy to be smooth. I look forward to his collapse in this matter.\u201dButler Wang lamented in his heart: Are you his father? How can you expect your son to eat? But young Li really\u2026well, actually now he thought about it, it was good to be frustrated.The only bitter thing was the little lady. What a pure white piece of paper, what a pure flower, but now it has encountered young Li, the pure white paper was doomed to be dyed by young Li.In the classroom, Nan Xun\u2019s eyes were fixed on the book on her desk, her thoughts had drifted far away.\u201cLittle eight, what did you just said? Say it again!\u201dThe void beast coughed, \u201cI said that you aren\u2019t blood-related to your daddy Li Chen at all and he wants you, oh, that means\u2026you don\u2019t blame me for this. Ah, I really didn\u2019t know! Last time I reviewed this world, Li Xiao Nan\u2019s identity has always been Li Chen\u2019s own biological daughter until her death. I thoroughly thought that Li Chen didn\u2019t care if she was his own daughter, so I didn\u2019t want to break her identity.\u201d1Nan Xun: \u201c\u2026 Baby, I really want to beat you to death.\u201dThe void beast: \u201cDon\u2019t be so cruel, people2 are also victims, but I think it\u2019s a good thing. Ah, you see, look, ah, daddy Li Chen\u2019s evil value hasn\u2019t been reduced for a long time. Now your identity just changed, you can use your fierce and intense love to influence him, heihei.\u201d3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She poked it with the tip of her pen and made countless holes.The void beast\u2019s voice sounded: \u201cYou, what did you draw?\u201dNan Xun: \u201cYou, don\u2019t you see it\u2019s a ball?\u201dThe void beast: \u201cCome on, I didn\u2019t think you were ugly. I can see that it\u2019s me. You actually took a pen to poke me. You are so cruel, yingyingying\u2026\u201d1Nan Xun coldly said: \u201cI\u2019m upset. Don\u2019t provoke me.\u201dThe void beast stopped crying and quickly asked: \u201cWhat are you upset about?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m especially young and Li Chen has been thinking about me. When I grow up, will my moral integrity still be intact? You say, why does he think about his daughter this way? Is he still human?\u201dThe void beast immediately said, \u201cYour daddy Li Chen isn\u2019t a human being, he\u2019s a pervert. Before we arrive at each world, we have to be psychologically prepared.\u201d\u201cYou say, it was good to use familial affection to change the big boss, you liar!\u201d Nan Xun was angry.The void beast\u2019s heart especially faltered: \u201cPeople2 weren\u2019t deliberate. I swear with my beast core, I really didn\u2019t know about this.\u201d\u201cGood, good. Don\u2019t you think daddy Li Chen is very good? Ah, so there isn\u2019t any moral integrity, but daddy Li Chen has long legs and looks more handsome than a model. Hmph, what are you waiting for, hurry up and steal the music, even if you have a guilty conscience.\u201d The void beast snorted twice.With a stab, Nan Xun directly made two halves from the drawn ball on the paper which destroyed the paper.The void beast: \u2026so scary.After school, Nan Xun was carrying her schoolbag to return home. As a result, a boy in the next class suddenly said to her, \u201cLi Xiao Nan, I have something very important to tell you. I will see you in the grove later.\u201dNan Xun was perplexed for a while, whether she should return or not, but she was afraid that daddy Li Chen wouldn\u2019t be happy if she returned late, but the thought of daddy Li Chen made her unhappy. So, why did she think about him.Nan Xun thought the little boy had something important to say, but after she went, he actually confessed to her.Since Nan Xun came to this world and became Li Chen\u2019s daughter, there were only three things in her life: eating, sleeping and Li Chen.Even if she went to school, she also spent three days fishing and two days drying nets.3 She didn\u2019t know all the people in her class, let alone the neighboring class. However, she had some impressions of this boy at present, his name appears to be Ji Shaoqing. He was very handsome. When Nan Xun went to the basketball court, she always saw him. Because there were always a flock of flowers who were crazy around him, thus she noticed him.But there was a father who was more handsome than the stars at home. This boy was handsome, but he couldn\u2019t be compared to Li Chen.Nan Xun politely refused: \u201cYou\u2019re very good, but I think it\u2019s more important to study now, and I\u2019m still young, so\u2026\u201dJi Shaoqing immediately smiled. \u201cXiao Nan, I know that you\u2019re different from ordinary girls. You\u2019re right. Now we should focus on our studies. Your academic performance has been very good, but I\u2019m not bad, so next year when we take the university exams, okay?\u201dNan Xun thought about it and continued to refuse: \u201cBut even when I attend university, I don\u2019t plan to fall in love. There are more things to learn in university. I don\u2019t want to waste my time.\u201dJi Shaoqing scratched his head. \u201cI can wait for you, Li Xiao Nan, I really like you. There were many girls who have expressed their love for me since I was young, but today is the first time I confessed to a girl.\u201dAfter that, he didn\u2019t wait for Nan Xun to refuse, he was fast\u2014he hugged her, then happily ran, after he was far away, he waved to her: \u201cLi Xiao Nan, you must remember our agreement!\u201dNan Xun was speechless. Obviously, this kid didn\u2019t give her the right to refuse. But now he was a little boy and was a hot-blooded young person, it was estimated that he would forget after a while.Nan Xun carried her schoolbag and rode an electric car back. When she arrived at the gate, little eight suddenly called out, \u201cYour daddy Li Chen\u2019s blackening value increased by 10 points!\u201dNan Xun\u2019s heart thumped. She already knew that Li Chen had sent someone to secretly \u201cprotect\u201d her. So, Li Chen must know about today\u2019s confession in the grove.He knows\u2026is he very angry?Nan Xun stood at the door for a long time, then the door suddenly opened from the inside. Uncle Wang smiled at her. \u201cCome in, little miss. Young master has been waiting for you for a long time.\u201dAfter a pause, he reminded her in a low voice, \u201cYoung Li\u2019s mood doesn\u2019t seem to be very good. Little miss, pay attention.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s expression changed, she bowed her body as she entered the door, then gently climbed to the second floor.\u201cBaby, Dad is here.\u201d All of a sudden, there was a man\u2019s low voice that rang in the hall, it was cold.Nan Xun pretended to not notice and said, \u201cDad, I thought you were upstairs.\u201dWith that, she ran to the man on the sofa, jumped onto him and hugged his neck. \u201cDad, I missed you today. I didn\u2019t listen carefully in class.\u201dLi Chen separated her thighs and hugged her body. His expression was still a little dark. \u201cOh? Baby missed me, if you missed me, then why did you come back so late today?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s heart trembled, come on, really because of this.Nan Xun thought for a moment and resolutely used the facts, she tooted: \u201cDad, it\u2019s a boy from the neighboring class. After school, he said he had something important to say. I thought it was something important so I went to see him, but I didn\u2019t expect he would confess to me.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s hands on her waist suddenly tightened and faintly asked: \u201cSo, what does baby think about the boy? In fact, there\u2019s nothing wrong with early love. If baby likes, dad won\u2019t object.\u201dNan Xun hehe in her heart: Pretend, you try your best to pretend. If it wasn\u2019t for little eight who told me your true thoughts, I really would have thought you were a good father towards me!Nan Xun shook Li Chen\u2019s neck and angrily rebuked: \u201cDad, how could you say that? I don\u2019t like these little boys. I like dad the best. I want to be with dad all the time.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s eyes slightly deepened and stared at her in a good way. \u201cBaby, is what you said true?\u201d\u201cOf course, it\u2019s true. Dad is always first in my heart. No one can match him, even grandpa is behind.\u201d Nan Xun held his neck and kissed his face affectionately.Nan Xun continue to stuff his mouth with sugar. \u201cDad, I\u2019ve even decided which university to enroll in, it\u2019s B university in this city. It\u2019s the closest one to home, so I can come back every day to see dad.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s large palm gently stroked her waist. His eyes were deep, and she didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.\u201cDad, Dad, what do you think? Talk to me.\u201d Nan Xun shook her body.4Li Chen suddenly snorted and slapped her bottom. \u201cDad is listening, sit down and don\u2019t move.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026\u201cFuck little eight, this beast is actually in heat!\u201d Nan Xun was frightened, she didn\u2019t dare to move.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He hasn\u2019t touched a woman for so many years. Now it\u2019s love, you still don\u2019t want to move? You want to make your daddy suffocate? Besides, didn\u2019t you jump on him yourself?\u201dNan Xun: \u201cBut I\u2019m still so small. I really didn\u2019t expect he would be interested in my shriveled body.\u201dThe void beast interjected with surprise, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on yourself so much, you were raised well by your daddy. Although you are young, you\u2019re already beautiful and have curves. You\u2019re a delicate little beauty.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cLittle eight, I really want to make you into a cake.\u201dThe void beast was fearless and sang, \u201cCome on, make it~\u201dNan Xun: \u201c\u2026Why don\u2019t you go to heaven and stand side by side with the sun?\u201d1The void beast immediately continued the couplet, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go in the water and lip sync with the tortoise\u2019s beak?\u201d2Nan Xun huddled in Li Chen\u2019s fierce arms and pretended to be dead. After a long time, she held his sleeves. \u201cDad, my legs are numb. Hold me upstairs.\u201dLi Chen laughed lowly, his voice spread through his chest to Nan Xun\u2019s ear, which was pressed against his chest, her ear vibrated along with it.\u201cLet\u2019s go baby, dad will take you up.\u201d Li Chen held the girl in front of his chest and his steps were very brisk and light.Nan Xun hurriedly said, \u201cDad is very good, holding me upstairs without gasping.\u201dLi Chen said with a smile: \u201cBaby is very light, dad can carry three of you.\u201dNan Xun despised him in her heart: Stinky rouge, one isn\u2019t enough, but he still wants to hold three.However, the matter regarding the boy\u2019s confession, should it be regarded as being foolish in the past?In the evening, Nan Xun discovered the old rogue was too generous. He gave her a good night kiss before going to bed. It wasn\u2019t a kiss on the face, but a kiss. After the kiss, he asked for a return on the gift.\u201cBaby, dad gave you a good night kiss. Shouldn\u2019t you return one back to dad?\u201dThe old rogue said.Nan Xun heard that and went to kiss his forehead, but the old rogue refused and pointed to his mouth and said, \u201cBaby, kiss here, dad used your strawberry toothpaste today. It tastes very sweet.\u201dNan Xun shivered around his neck and almost strangled the old rogue.\u201cDad, this isn\u2019t right. I watched TV and only lovers can kiss each other.\u201d Nan Xun blinked her big innocent eyes, trying to tear off the old rogue\u2019s disguise.Li Chen opened his eyes and said, \u201cBaby, we can too. Do you hate it when dad kisses you?\u201dNan Xun shook her head. \u201cI don\u2019t hate it. I like dad kissing me.\u201dHumph, happy old rogue.Li Chen was very happy indeed. He wrapped Nan Xun\u2019s small mouth and sucked it several times.Nan Xun also foolishly kissed his mouth, regardless of his reaction, she closed her eyes and went to sleep.Li Chen leaned over to her side, his burning breath hit her ear, his voice was deep and low, \u201cBaby, although dad isn\u2019t enlightened. I still think it\u2019s not good to have early love, so baby should obey me and don\u2019t fall in love at school.\u201dNan Xun rolled her eyes in her heart and vaguely said, \u201cI only like dad, so I won\u2019t fall in love. But dad, do you have to secretly send bodyguards to protect me? Dad, please take them away. Now I think that someone is staring at me secretly and I don\u2019t feel comfortable, even though I know that dad wants to protect me.\u201dOne of Li Chen\u2019s big palm gently stroked her head, he was silent for a long time after he heard her. \u201cOkay, dad promises you, but you must obey.\u201dNan Xun happily rubbed his neck and whispered: \u201cThank you dad.\u201d\u201cSleep, dad\u2019s baby.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s deep and gentle voice seemed to have a hypnotic effect. Nan Xun was attacked by sleepiness.When Nan Xun was about to fall asleep, little eight rejoiced: \u201cThe evil value just dropped by 5.\u201dIn Nan Xun\u2019s dream, the corners of her mouth were bent. She counted there was only 30 evil value points left.The next day, Nan Xun, who was in a good mood, ate two more small dumplings. She carried her schoolbag and happily boarded daddy Li Chen\u2019s car. When they separated, they also had a goodbye kiss.\u201cBaby, be careful on the road, ah.\u201d Li Chen rolled down the window and shouted.Nan Xun waved her hand, \u201cDon\u2019t worry dad, I won\u2019t wander off.\u201dWhen it came to this matter, Nan Xun was very ashamed. She once took the bus to school by herself, but accidentally took the wrong bus. She swore she read the wrong number and wasn\u2019t an idiot, but she really didn\u2019t know which bus to take.But this was the reason why he yelled out. He was afraid she would take the wrong bus again.By the time she arrived at the classroom, the students were all there. They were reciting the text, words and formulas.Nan Xun directly took out a book in front of her, then her eyes were absentminded as she began to chat with little eight.\u201cLittle eight, ah, the evil value is only 30. You say, if I directly drop my moral integrity and brew sauce with daddy Li Chen, will daddy Li Chen\u2019s evil value suddenly become 0?\u201dHearing this, little eight was very excited and quickly replied: \u201cI think it\u2019s feasible! Why don\u2019t you try it tonight?\u201dNan Xun chuckled, \u201cBaby, it\u2019s not you who will lose your moral integrity, what are you excited about?\u201dThe void beast was a little cautious and said, \u201cPeople just think this strategy is feasible. If we eliminate the evil value early, we can leave early.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cI was just joking with you. I didn\u2019t expect you to actually think so. My 16th birthday isn\u2019t even here yet. You are so anxious for me to die. Little eight, you, I didn\u2019t expect you were such a fucking beast.\u201dThe void beast humph, \u201cWhat is moral integrity? Can you eat it? In my eyes, there is only merit when the big boss\u2019s evil value is eliminated. Besides, are you 16? Is that young? Even in ancient time, they already had a family and children!\u201d3Nan Xun also learned to humph, \u201cI tell you, before I was an adult and wanted to dedicate myself to the door, but there wasn\u2019t a door.\u201d4One person and one beast were arguing, just at this time, two girls at a table in front of them suddenly had a fierce fight.Nan Xun sat behind the two people and the spit from their quarrel splashed on her face.After thinking about it, Nan Xun stood up and tried to calm them.She just grabbed the hands of the two female students, but before she could do anything, she was pushed away by both of them.The girls\u2019 fingernails were long. If Nan Xun didn\u2019t duck in time, she would have been blinded by them. However, Nan Xun\u2019s mouth was still hit and cut.Nan Xun hissed.Suddenly from her lips was blood, it was a gorgeous bright red which looked strange and frightening.Nan Xun wiped the blood with the back of her hand.She looked at the blood on the back of her hand, Nan Xun only had one thought in her mind: It\u2019s over, Li Chen would be furious after he finds out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They heard that Li Xiao Nan\u2019s family had some background. If the other\u2019s family held them responsible, they would have trouble.\u201cNo, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Nan Xun said, her lips spurted blood and she hissed with pain.The two female students who were still shocked, quickly helped Nan Xun to the infirmary, but they met Ji Shaoqing, the handsome guy who confessed to her yesterday.Ji Shaoqing was more anxious than they were. He hurriedly picked up Nan Xun and ran.\u201cLet me, let me go\u2026ow ha\u201d Nan Xun patted his shoulder. She just hurt her mouth, not her legs. Was this handsome boy funny?Ji Shaoqing immediately comforted, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Li Xiao Nan. We\u2019ll be in the infirmary soon.\u201dNan Xun was speechless. Her mouth hurts so much that she didn\u2019t want to talk anymore.She should be glad early in the morning, there was no one on the way, or if she was seen by other students, she doesn\u2019t know what gossip will be spread.Ji Shaoqing carried Nan Xun all the way to the school clinic. The clinic auntie saw Nan Xun\u2019s bloody mouth and looked at the handsome guy beside her. She thought the young couple was too daring. If the director found out, it was appropriate for them to be suspended for two weeks.She carefully looked at Nan Xun\u2019s punctured mouth, the clinic auntie found that it wasn\u2019t bitten, so she had a better attitude and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It will be fine after two or three days.\u201d1After she finished, she took a cotton swab to apply some ointment on Nan Xun\u2019s mouth.\u201cCome on, hurry back to class.\u201d The auntie urged, but also said to the young handsome Ji, \u201cYou\u2019re still young, you still need to focus on learning.\u201dAs soon as she saw them, she guessed they were a couple, but the more she looked, she felt more confident they were a couple. Unlike those little gangsters who didn\u2019t studied, she reminded them once more.Ji Shaoqing\u2019s face suddenly became red and quickly explained: \u201cAuntie you misunderstood, it\u2019s not like this.\u201dThe infirmary auntie didn\u2019t want to listen to his explanation and let them go.Nan Xun thanked Ji Shaoqing. She was afraid that he would carry her again and ran first.Ji Shaoqing chased her from behind, his lips almost reached the root of her ear.Nan Xun\u2019s mouth was swollen. She felt guilty all the way home. According to Li Chen\u2019s boundless love for her, she didn\u2019t dare let Li Chen know.However, come on, those two people that secretly stared at her must have told Li Chen about it.She just arrived at the door and was ready to enter her fingerprints to open the door. But unexpectedly, the door was opened from the inside.\u201cBaby, come in.\u201d It wasn\u2019t Uncle Wang or Aunt Li, it was Li Chen who opened the door.He stood at the door with his black face.Nan Xun lowered her head and used her hand to cover half her lips, then vaguely said, \u201cDad, you\u2019re back so early today.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s face darkened when she spoke with her tongue pressed in her mouth. He took Nan Xun in his arms and carried her into the house.When Nan Xun noticed the situation and their posture, she hurriedly explained: \u201cDad, don\u2019t be angry. My classmates weren\u2019t careful. You can\u2019t order others to stop the students from learning or making them transfer. Let alone make them bankrupt.\u201d\u201cBaby, put down your hand so dad can see.\u201d Li Chen\u2019s voice didn\u2019t rise or fall but implied with urgency.Nan Xun knew that when daddy Li Chen spoke in this tone, no one would try to disobey his orders.So, Nan Xun voluntarily released her paw to let him see her sausage mouth.When Li Chen saw the red swollen lips, his eyes suddenly sank, and he released a cold air.Nan Xun quickly said: \u201cDad, really, it was my classmates\u2019 accident. Don\u2019t be angry.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s concern was different from Nan Xun. He suddenly raised her chin, looked at her lips carefully for a long time, then stretched out his index finger to gently rub the red swollen place. The next moment, the strength in his hand increased uncontrollably. \u201cBaby, it\u2019s said that today a boy carried you to the infirmary, it was the boy that confessed to you last time, en?\u201dNan Xun hissed with pain and said, \u201cDad, you hurt me.\u201dLi Chen immediately lightened his strength, but still looked at her darkly.Nan Xun cried and explained: \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to carry me. His shoulders weren\u2019t strong at all. I felt like I would fall at any time when he carried me. But dad, I didn\u2019t have time to refuse because my mouth was injured at that time. I was afraid that he would carry me again after the medicine, so I ran away first.\u201d\u201cDad, I promised you that I wouldn\u2019t fall in love last time. It\u2019s true, I don\u2019t like Ji Shaoqing. I don\u2019t like anyone. I only like Dad, ah.\u201d Nan Xun hastily stressed.\u201cBaby, dad will believe you for the moment, so, tomorrow go break off your relationship with him, you know, en?\u201dNan Xun quickly cried.This hairy guy2 from the start wasn\u2019t convinced at all!Nan Xun knew that no matter how she explained it, Li Chen believed that she has a relationship with Ji Shaoqing, so she could only nod with tears. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go make it clear to the other party tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBaby listen to dad\u2019s words. Dad loves you so much, how could he harm you?\u201d Li Chen pinched her little face and his words came from the depths of his heart.Nan Xun: Old rogue, old pervert.When she finished the meal, Nan Xun was unhappy because her mouth hurt, and it hurt to eat. At last, she could only swallow a few spoonsful of porridge.Li Chen thought she wasn\u2019t happy because she agreed to his words, but he could indulge her in anything else. This wasn\u2019t the case. Only god knows that when he saw the picture of the boy carrying Li Xiao Nan on his back, he was so angry that he wanted to kill people.He really wanted to shoot him.His baby was his, her entire body, everything belonged to him, no one was qualified to touch!Old Li also saw there was something wrong between the father and daughter. He was inexplicably happy and wanted to hum a tune.\u201cNan Nan, ah, wait a minute for the TV to start, do you want to watch with grandpa?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s spirit was vacant: \u201cGrandpa, please watch by yourself. I won\u2019t watch today. Grandpa, tomorrow tell me what happens.\u201dThen, Nan Xun didn\u2019t even look at Li Chen. She took her bag and went upstairs.Li Chen slightly frowned.Old Li happily said: \u201cYo, did you quarrel with Nan Nan again? Li Chen, at Nan Nan\u2019s age, it\u2019s the rebellious period. Don\u2019t restrain her all the time. Be careful that it backfires.\u201dLi Chen continued to eat, but his movements slowed down.Old Li glanced at him. It was rare. Did his son actually listen to his words?After Li Chen finished eating, he went upstairs to coax her, but after he opened the bedroom door, he found the bed that should have been raised in the shape of a baby silkworm was flat and there was no one in the bathroom.After taking a closer look, there was one missing small bear pillow from the bed.Li Chen\u2019s face darkened in a flash.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although she doesn\u2019t sleep in it, Aunt Li cleaned it every day, so it was very clean.She just rolled on the bed with the quilt in her arms and lamented about her comfort in bed. Then, there was a knock on the door.\u201cBaby, open the door.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s little mouth bent, who asked you to deprive my rights, today, sleep by yourself.Nan Xun listened to the heavy knocks on the door. She imagined Li Chen\u2019s thin lips were pressed into a straight line and his face was expressionless. She felt more and more satisfied, but she thought about it and finally opened the door.She looked at Li Chen\u2019s dark and sullen face at the door and Nan Xun said with a smile, \u201cDad, I\u2019m old enough to sleep in my own room by myself from now on.\u201dLi Chen looked at her eyebrows flying with pride and couldn\u2019t help but stroke her forehead. It seems that the old man was right. His baby\u2019s rebellious period has arrived. Just let her stay for a couple of days and let her calm down first.Then, Li Chen compromised: \u201cGood, you should sleep by yourself for a few days.\u201dHe said a few days.Nan Xun didn\u2019t notice. She happily jumped in bed, then retracted into the bed. She laid down upright and grinned sharply. \u201cDad, it\u2019s late. You should go to sleep too. Remember to close the door when you leave.\u201dLi Chen softly sighed, walked over and fixed the quilt for her, then he bowed his head and kissed her little mouth. \u201cBaby, good night.\u201d\u201cGood night dad.\u201d The happy Nan Xun also slightly raised her head and kissed his lips.Both of them were stunned by this kiss.Li Chen controlled the corner of his mouth that wanted to bend and softly said, \u201cDream well daddy\u2019s baby.\u201dLi Chen thought Li Xiao Nan was temporarily angry and that she would take the initiative to return. After all, they were used to each other.These days, Li Chen had no girl to hold and slept badly. He had dark circles, but on the contrary, Li Xiao Nan was in a good mood every day, her little face was ruddy.The happiest person was old Li.Old Li hummed a tune, his mood was so good, he went to the manor to trim the flowers and plants. Finally, he picked two lilies and placed them in a vase on the coffee table in the living room.At the dinner table, the family ate a few mouthfuls of dinner and old Li had another bowl.Li Chen glanced at old Li and said in a cold voice, \u201cYou seem to be in a good mood?\u201dWhen old Li was young, he was also a tough guy. He wasn\u2019t afraid of his son\u2019s low pressure and happily said, \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll ask my old friend to go fishing. I\u2019ll give you Nan Nan. Take good care of her.\u201dNan Xun listened to this and quickly inserted a sentence, \u201cGrandpa, I want to eat crucian carp, bring back more fish, oh~\u201d\u201cOkay, Nan Nan. Grandpa will bring you a basket of fresh crucian carp when he comes back tomorrow.\u201dLi Chen looked at the two who neglected him and was in a gloomy mood.\u201cDad you have to eat more. I\u2019ll give you a dish.\u201d Nan Xun saw Li Chen didn\u2019t eat much and hurriedly used her chopsticks to place his most hated vegetables in his bowl.Li Chen looked at his bowl full of vegetables and couldn\u2019t help but pick up his eyebrows.Baby took the initiative to talk to him. She was worried that he didn\u2019t eat enough and gave him food, which showed her anger dissipated.\u201cDad, I can\u2019t eat it. Please help me eat the rest. It\u2019s a shame to waste it. I don\u2019t want to be a wasteful person.\u201d Nan Xun said and pushed the sloppy half bowl of rice in front of him.Li Chen, with a steady face, combined Nan Xun\u2019s half bowl of rice in his bowl.They didn\u2019t feel embarrassed, anyway, since Nan Xun was small, they often shared a bowl of rice, pear, cake or even chocolate. They have indirectly eaten each other\u2019s saliva countless times.They felt nothing was wrong, but old Li was soured. This kind of sour acidity, he couldn\u2019t eat anymore.\u201cNan Nan, ah, you eat so little, how aren\u2019t you hungry at night?\u201d Old Li asked with consideration.Nan Xun immediately said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Dad can cook. If I\u2019m hungry, dad will cook for me to eat at night.\u201dLi Chen was more relaxed after hearing this. Baby really calmed down. It seems that she will return this evening on her own.\u201cDad, Grandpa, I\u2019ll cut some fruit for you to eat!\u201dNan Xun happily ran to the kitchen. All kinds of fruits were cut into small pieces and arranged into a flower on the plate, then she took a box of toothpicks.\u201cDad, Grandpa, taste the fruits I cut.\u201d Nan Xun placed the plate on the table and gave them a toothpick.Old Li was a bit happy. Was it hard for her to cut fruit? Would it taste different than usual?As soon as old Li thought about it, he listened to his son\u2019s praise, \u201cBaby cut fruit so well and it tastes better than usual.\u201d1Old Li: \u2026Old Li felt his teeth was more sour and went out for a walk so his teeth wouldn\u2019t fall out.Uncle Wang left with him and Aunt Li cleaned the kitchen and left. Li Chen and Nan Xun were left in the house.Nan Xun sat alone on the sofa watching TV which was very exciting.Li Chen came over, now there was no one in the way, he could talk to his baby alone.\u201cBaby, don\u2019t be angry with Dad, en?\u201d The tone was very soft.Nan Xun was stunned and quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m not angry, why would I be angry with dad?\u201dLi Chen saw her sincere expression, it wasn\u2019t perfunctory. He was more confident that she wasn\u2019t angry, so he rubbed her little head, \u201cLet\u2019s go baby, it\u2019s time to wash and sleep.\u201dNan Xun heard something wrong, and immediately said: \u201cWait dad, did you misunderstand me? I\u2019m not angry, but I still want to sleep by myself, ah.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s eyes narrowed immediately.\u201cDad, I\u2019m sixteen years old. I will go to college after the college entrance examination in a few months. I\u2019m already an adult. How can I sleep with dad?\u201dWhen Nan Xun was a child, she was afraid that Li Chen would make her younger brothers and sisters. Later, he wouldn\u2019t pay attention to her, then her words would be weightless. In order to eliminate the evil thoughts through familial affection, it would be equivalent to an idiot talking about their dreams. So, when Li Chen wanted to sleep with her, she happily attached herself to Li Chen.But later when she was a little older, about nine or ten years old, she felt that she managed her father-daughter relationship very well. Even if Li Chen made her younger brothers and sisters, her position in Li Chen\u2019s heart would absolutely be first. But when Nan Xun proposed sleeping in separate beds at that time, Li Chen wasn\u2019t happy.Nan Xun asked him why and Li Chen simply reasoned: Used to it.Then this habit was preserved until now and was getting worse day by day. These past few days, there was no Nan Xun, so Li Chen\u2019s quality of sleep plummet. During the day, he still worked hard, and Nan Xun didn\u2019t look satisfied.For her sake, Li Chen has almost became a teenage mutant turtle for her and was really a good \u201cfather\u201d.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was hard to guarantee that one day he wouldn\u2019t become an animal and deal with her.Even if she was destined to lose her moral integrity, he could at least wait until she was an adult, right?Li Chen didn\u2019t speak. He silently carried Nan Xun back to his bedroom and firmly implemented his own ideas.Nan Xun resisted to no avail and resigned to her fate.Forget it. If Li Chen couldn\u2019t help but touch her, sleep together.It seems that in front of Li Chen, she never had human rights. It was sad to think about. Last time, he was finally persuaded to let go of those two \u201cbodyguards\u201d, but before it was implemented, Ji Shaoqing had to butt into her business. She didn\u2019t want to think about it, she was surely ruined.However, Li Chen was so good to her that Nan Xun felt that even if the other party went too far, she could bear it.The two of them slept together again and Old Li begun to sigh and finally gave up. He didn\u2019t care.In the third year of high school, the average person would be very busy, but Nan Xun was the exception. She was the school tyrant, previously she went to middle school in the second world, and now she was already a professional in taking exams.Nan Xun was in the living room, holding a bear pillow in one hand and a big apple in the other which she took a big bite out of.\u201cGrandpa, this Xue Guiren is blind. That Li Meiren is so bad. She clearly wants to use him as a springboard, can\u2019t he see?\u201dBesides her, old Li pinched a banana and took delight in her words, \u201cNan Nan, you talk lightly. This Li Meiren has such powerful means and pretends so well in front of the public. In addition, Xue Guiren and this Li Meiren grew up together since childhood. Xue Guiren can\u2019t see that she\u2019s bad. Nan Nan you are so simple. If you went into the imperial harem, you would be beaten into the cold palace in a few days.\u201dNan Xun laughed twice, \u201cGrandpa, you look down on me too much. I\u2019m going to sit on the Empress\u2019s throne properly in the palace, then become the empress dowager, hehe. Then I\u2019ll raise some gigolos first for the emperor to wear a green hat. Who would call a nest of women in the rear palace? The spider spirit and white bone essence are mixed together. If you\u2019re not careful, you\u2019ll be swallowed with no bones left behind.\u201d\u201cPfff, empress? Gigolos first? Cough, cough\u2026\u201d The old man choked on the banana.Nan Xun promptly rebuked him: \u201cGrandpa, do you despise me or what? Do I look so stupid?\u201dOld Li didn\u2019t answer, but little eight suddenly added, \u201cBaby, do you really think you can live in the harem for three days?\u201dNan Xun wasn\u2019t happy, she thought little eight was looking down on her intelligence. \u201cNot for three days, but to become the empress dowager.\u201dLittle eight didn\u2019t say a word, as if he was thinking.1The palace drama just came to a climax. The two sat on the couch and watched intently. As a result, the TV drama ended with Xue Guiren pushed down the river by Li Meiren.Nan Xun was so angry that she jumped. \u201cGrandpa, this wasn\u2019t a wonderful place to stop, isn\u2019t this keeping people\u2019s appetite?\u201d2Old Li was very calm, \u201cGrandpa has already guessed the follow-up. First, Xue Guiren drowned and the harem became a mess. Secondly, he didn\u2019t die and finally fought with Li Meiren. But it can be seen that Xue Guiren is obviously the star, so absolutely won\u2019t be dead.\u201dThe discussion between the grandfather and granddaughter boomed. Suddenly, they heard the sound of someone coming downstairs. Old Li glanced at the person coming downstairs and patted Nan Xun on the shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s late. Nan Nan go and take a rest. There will be the college entrance exam tomorrow.\u201dNan Xun oh and quickly ran to the person downstairs, she happily extended her arms, \u201cDad, my legs are numb, can you hold me upstairs.\u201dLi Chen glanced at the old man, picked up Nan Xun and went to their nest.\u201cBaby, just now, you want to raise a group of gigolos? En?\u201d Li Chen suddenly asked, the end of his tone rose and scared Nan Xun.Come on, she said a lot of words, dare to ask if that was all he heard?Nan Xun immediately complained: \u201cDad, it\u2019s not right for you to eavesdrop on other people\u2019s conversations, and that was just a joke, don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201dLi Chen smiled and said, \u201cGigolos! You actually know this word, baby is so smart.\u201dNan Xun: \u201c\u2026Dad, I was really joking.\u201d\u201cDad, did you finish your work?\u201d Nan Xun cleverly changed the topic.Li Chen said, \u201cTomorrow, when you finish the exam, dad will pick you up.\u201dNan Xun was stunned, \u201cDad, are you serious?\u201dLi Chen rubbed her head and said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, won\u2019t drive.\u201dNan Xun thought he meant he wouldn\u2019t drive the extended version of the luxury car and instead use a more ordinary car to pick her up. So, the next day when she saw the man on the bicycle at the school gate, she was stunned.Li Chen wore a short-sleeved white shirt, dark brown slacks and white sneakers. With one foot on the pedal of the bike and the other on the ground, his stretched legs looked very slender.At this time, everyone just finished the final exam. The gate was full of parents while the school gate was full of students. Li Chen\u2019s appearance was so eye-catching that they couldn\u2019t help but look more as they passed by.Nan Xun heard two girls next to her mutter to each other, saying this was someone\u2019s handsome elder brother. He was so handsome. He was more handsome than the XXX star who was very popular recently.Nan Xun walked honorably straight.Li Chen also saw Nan Xun, then waved at her. \u201cBaby, here.\u201dSwish-Nan Xun\u2019s face turned as red as a monkey\u2019s butt.Was this old rogue deliberate?He was deliberate!He was absolutely deliberate!She was so embarrassed, he called out to her with such a brilliant smile that everyone looked at him, then saw her from his line of sight. Nan Xun already felt several eyes on her.\u201cIt turns out that Li Xiao Nan already has such a handsome boyfriend. It\u2019s no wonder that even Ji Shaoqing\u2019s confession was rejected.\u201d\u201cWow, really handsome. His temperament is very good. He\u2019s much more handsome than Ji Shaoqing. Is he a college student?\u201dSomeone who knew Li Xiao Nan begun to whisper.Nan Xun quickly ran to the back of the bike, she hugged Li Chen\u2019s waist with both hands, buried her whole head on him and urged: \u201cDad, go quickly!\u201dLi Chen raised his eyebrows and wasn\u2019t in a hurry to leave, he first asked, \u201cBaby, how was the exam?\u201dNan Xun snorted, especially confident as her small chest was erect. \u201cIt was a piece of cake to be admitted into university B.\u201dLi Chen looked at her small haughty appearance and raised her chin. He looked and couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cBaby, sit still, let\u2019s go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Nan Xun sat in the back and giggled, \u201cDad, I thought you could only drive a car. I didn\u2019t expect you could ride a bike so well.\u201d\u201cDad still knows a lot of things that baby doesn\u2019t know about.\u201d Li Chen said.Nan Xun was about to say the word narcist, only to find her fierce father, Li Chen, rode in a big circle and actually went to the back door of the school.\u201cDad, aren\u2019t we going home?\u201d\u201cDad wants to see your school, baby, don\u2019t you want to see it again?\u201dNan Xun was stunned, she had a chance to see it. Now, she completed the exam and still had to go to the graduation party to take graduation photos.Now it was after the college entrance exam, there was no one in school. Li Chen rode the bike with Nan Xun slowly on the small road of the school. There were tall sycamore trees on both sides of the road, which were lush and covered the sun\u2019s heat from overhead. It was very cool.Nan Xun held Li Chen\u2019s sturdy waist and looked at the sunshine coming from the lush foliage. On the trail, there were pieces of light. As the bike rolled over, these small pieces of light were scattered on Li Chen\u2019s white shirt, like some light spots that were dotted on his white shirt, warm.Nan Xun put the tip of her nose close to the man\u2019s back and took in a deep breath.Oh, the smell of grass shower gel, also\u2026the smell of sunlight.\u201cDad.\u201d\u201cEn? What\u2019s the matter baby?\u201d\u201cI like you dad.\u201d Suddenly, Nan Xun gave him a mouthful of sugar.Li Chen\u2019s action of pedaling paused, then his voice became very soft at this moment. \u201cDad also likes you very much. You don\u2019t know how much dad loves you.\u201dNan Xun was shy: short oil, so shy. Is this Li Chen\u2019s confession to me in disguise?Little eight jumped to the scene at once to be an eyesore. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say your family\u2019s daddy Li Chen was a pervert? Hmph, now you know how to steal music?\u201dNan Xun was embarrassed: \u201cLittle eight, I was wrong. I suddenly found that daddy Li Chen is very good, ah. I almost fell in love with him.\u201dLittle eight was startled, \u201cYou need to distinguish, ah. These are fakes. You can\u2019t fall in love with anyone in these worlds, ah!\u201dNan Xun laughed in her heart, \u201cLittle eight, look at you terrified. I was just kidding. I\u2019m a person who have elderly above and young below, okay?\u201d1Little eight: \u2026Nan Xun sighed, \u201cI miss my family, ah.\u201dLittle eight: \u201cSo you have to go forward firmly and boldly. There are many leaves in the forest, don\u2019t let them touch you. Our goal is the evil value. It doesn\u2019t matter if we lose the three aspects of moral integrity for the evil value, but we can\u2019t get emotional!\u201dNan Xun said, \u201cOkay, little eight, don\u2019t brainwash me. My heart is clear.\u201d\u201cBaby, why don\u2019t you speak?\u201d Li Chen suddenly asked.Nan Xun quickly hugged him and said in a muffled voice, \u201cDad, people are shy.\u201dLi Chen didn\u2019t speak, in the place she couldn\u2019t see, the corner of his mouth was hooked up a bit and his deep eyes were filled with tiny smiles.\u201cDad, you see, the school doesn\u2019t allow students to fall in love with each other in that grove. Those little lovers always sneak into that grove for trysts.\u201dWhoosh, Li Chen suddenly stopped the bike. He faintly interjected with an en, \u201cDad knows this is where that little boy confessed to you.\u201dNan Xun choked. She indeed mention the pot that doesn\u2019t boil.2 As a result, Li Chen thought of this matter.Li Chen stopped the bike at one side and took Nan Xun from the backseat.\u201cDad, are you going to the woods?\u201d\u201cEn, let\u2019s see what this lover\u2019s meeting place looks like.\u201d His tone was faint.Li Chen led her to the depths of the forest. There was no one there at the moment and the forest was quiet. A few red and yellow wildflowers were scattered on the green grass. Different fragrances mixed and gave off a refreshing scent.\u201cDad, it\u2019s at the end of the road ahead.\u201d Nan Xun pinched his big palm to remind him.Li Chen stubbornly stopped and suddenly turned to look at her.Nan Xun was startled. The man\u2019s eyes in front of her were deep and terrible, like two black whirlpools, plundering all her attention, dragging her inside and finally captured her to become his captive.\u201cBaby, dad wants to hold you.\u201d Li Chen said. He hotly stared into her eyes, his eyes burning like a raging fire.Nan Xun was stupefied for a moment and spread out her arms to him. \u201cDad hold me.\u201dLi Chen looked at her, his hanging hands suddenly clenched and loosened. At the next moment, he violently picked up the girl in front of him, separated her thighs and wrapped them around his waist, then held her against a big tree behind her.Suddenly Nan Xun was raised, and she was frightened as she quickly hugged his neck. \u201cDad, why did you lift me so high? I\u2019m not a child.\u201dLi Chen suddenly said, \u201cBaby, dad still wants to kiss you.\u201dNan Xun: Motherfucker, old rogue.\u201cI want to kiss dad too.\u201d Nan Xun said sweetly as she kissed his face.\u201cBaby, not like this.\u201d Li Chen said.Without waiting for Nan Xun to open her mouth again, he suddenly took Nan Xun\u2019s mouth. The next moment, he gave a passionate, burning and possessive kiss.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes widened.Fucking hell, this pervert, ya, you haven\u2019t revealed my identity yet. You treat me like this. If you do, won\u2019t I be killed by you!After half an hour.Nan Xun panted, and her heart was about to jump out of her chest.\u201cBaby, how do you feel?\u201d Li Chen asked, his voice hoarse.Nan Xun replied truthfully: \u201cDad, can\u2019t breathe. I\u2019m tired.\u201dShe was held like a koala and he didn\u2019t stop, Li Chen single-handedly dominated her with a kiss: \u2026\u201cDad, my mouth seems to be swollen. Your skin is so thick that it\u2019s not swollen.\u201dLi Chen: \u201c\u2026come, baby, let dad have a look.\u201dNan Xun put her mouth closer to him and didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cHere, it\u2019s all swollen into a sausage mouth.\u201dLi Chen gently sip and kissed both lips, \u201cBaby, it will be fine in a moment.\u201dLi Chen\u2019s mood was a little complicated. Although he did what a man would do to his beloved woman, but his baby didn\u2019t seem to realize that. But if she did and didn\u2019t disobey his command, did she know what it meant?Nan Xun was in a very good mood, she hummed a tune in her heart.A deadly pervert and their entanglement.Nan Xun slipped off Li Chen\u2019s body and yawned: \u201cDad, I\u2019m a little sleepy.\u201dLi Chen sat on the grass beside her and patted his legs. \u201cCome baby, lie here for a while.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s head rested on his lap, her eyes narrowed, and she fell asleep.In her daze, suddenly there was a hard thing on her cheek. She almost poked it with her mouth. Nan Xun touched it with disgust and felt it poking her face. She turned around and went to sleep. She faintly heard daddy Li Chen groaned.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It would be weird if she didn\u2019t wake up.Li Chen saw that she was awake, released her lips and smiled deeply. \u201cBaby, it\u2019s late. It\u2019s time to go home.\u201dNan Xun rubbed her eyes and almost forgot where she was. She was picked up by the man and directly held out of the woods. Then she was placed on the back seat of the bike.Li Chen stepped on the bike and slowly took his girl off campus and rode all the way towards the Li home.Because the distance was quite far, the sky was dark.\u201cDad, the stars are coming out, so bright.\u201d Nan Xun looked at the night sky and pointed to the stars that slowly shined on her body, which was extremely bright.\u201cBaby don\u2019t move. If you want to see the stars, let\u2019s go to the top floor to see them when we get home.\u201dNan Xun oh, obediently sat still and began to sing, \u201cFafeiwa, fawafeiwa\u2026\u201d1She said she wanted to see the stars, but after she returned, she forgot. After dinner, she sat in the hall with old Li to watch palace drama.\u201cGrandpa, you actually guessed right. Xue Guiren didn\u2019t die, then she began to tear Li Meiren. The female lead\u2019s halo is beginning to work!\u201d Nan Xun was a little excited.2Old Li said: \u201cLook, it\u2019s beginning. Behind the dozens of rallies, there are various of tricks and intrigues.\u201dLi Chen with a black face watched the grandfather and granddaughter discuss the plot with great enthusiasm. Suddenly, there was an impulse to smash the huge crystal-clear TV.Later, when Nan Xun went to sleep first, old Li called Li Chen to talk.As soon as the doors were closed, old Li smashed the inkstone on the table.Li Chen\u2019s head moved slightly to avoid the object and frowned, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dOld Li was very angry with him. \u201cI told you to be a little more restrained. You treat laozi\u2019s words as wind? Look at Nan Nan\u2019s mouth. It\u2019s almost swollen into a sausage. Aren\u2019t you afraid that other people will know she has an abnormal father?\u201dLi Chen disagreed and lightly said: \u201cYou should be glad to have a son with strong self-control. Otherwise, Nan Nan wouldn\u2019t just have a swollen mouth.\u201dOld Li was angry when he heard this. What\u2019s more irritating was that he couldn\u2019t do anything.All the properties and forces of the Li family, in the dark, has been firmly grasped by Li Chen. Before, he was happy to be free. Now he wants to take back his rights and clean up the boy.Unfortunately, he can\u2019t get it back now.Everyone in the Li Group knows there was a very young chairman, who was more handsome than the stars and has strong working ability. However, the chairman of the Li Group always leaves on time every day. The other day, he started to leave early. Recently, he simply disappeared, and it\u2019s said he requested a long vacation.Li Chen did ask for a long vacation. His baby had finished her college entrance exam and is now on summer vacation. He had to take time off to accompany her on a graduation trip as a reward for choosing university B.At that time, he knew that Nan Xun was going to apply for university B. Her teachers were very anxious and angry. With her achievements, she could apply for the top university T in the country. Even if she wanted to stay in this city, there was also a university A that was ranked second. But Nan Xun insisted she wasn\u2019t interested. Several teachers specially invited her parent to come to school for this matter.When they saw the young Li Chen, the teachers thought he was just her brother and Li Chen didn\u2019t deny it. He directly said, \u201cI respect any decision made by Nan Nan, and that\u2019s what family means.\u201dThe teachers\u2019 persuasion failed, and they were regretful.This summer vacation, Nan Xun and Li Chen had a crazy time. Li Chen originally had a cold temperament, but all his gentleness in his life was given to Li Xiao Nan. Li Xiao Nan had a crazy time and could go play with him.When they returned from their trip, Nan Xun jumped on the bed and rolled happily.The void beast who has been silent for a long time, suddenly made a noise, \u201cDear, did you have a good time?\u201dNan Xun hurriedly said she was happy.\u201cDaddy Li Chen\u2019s evil value is only at 20 points. Don\u2019t you think you should lose your moral integrity at once? You say, if you lose it, won\u2019t the evil thoughts become 0. If you finish this task early, you can ask for two things in the next world.\u201dNan Xun wasn\u2019t tempted by his sugar-coated bullets and firmly said: \u201cAlthough the ancient woman was 15 years old and have the hairpin, even if they were considered as adults, how could it be the same as modern time? I\u2019ll wait until I\u2019m an adult to lose my moral integrity.\u201d3The void beast grumbled, \u201cPedantic.\u201dNan Xun immediately said: \u201cYou\u2019re not pedantic, so you go brew sauce with Li Chen.\u201dThe void beast: \u2026Nan Xun\u2019s college life will begin soon, but it seems there was no difference between her university life and high school life. Because she was close by, she could go home every day. Then in the evening, she lies in the quilt with Li Chen and chat with him. Before going to bed, she gives another mouth-to-mouth goodnight kiss.Every morning, Nan Xun could see Li Chen go to the bathroom. She had been alone for a long time. One day, when she thought something was wrong, she knocked on the door. As a result, Li Chen replied in a charming and very low husky voice, \u201c\u2026baby, I\u2019m fine.\u201d4Nan Xun heard this and was too scared to knock on the door anymore.The void beast inexplicably smiled, \u201cDear, all of a sudden I look forward to it, oh.\u201dNan Xun was a little confused, \u201cLittle eight, what do you expect?\u201dThe void beast rudely answered, \u201cAi oh, I look forward to the day when the hungry wolf breaks through the cage and devours the prey. Oh, that picture is cruel. But don\u2019t worry, I will automatically block my five senses, especially my eyes and ears.\u201dNan Xun increasingly wanted to make little eight into a meatloaf.Because Nan Xun\u2019s life basically revolved around Li Chen, even if the university divided the dormitory, she didn\u2019t stay overnight and will go home on time every day. Because of this, several of her roommates always make fun of her, saying that she was a little child that hadn\u2019t grown up yet.However, Li Xiao Nan skipped two grades in middle school, she was two years younger than them. Everyone took care of her.At noon, Nan Xun took a lunch break in the dormitory. At this time, everyone wasn\u2019t sleeping, so they began to chat.They chatted and talked, and Li Xiao Nan was somehow mentioned.\u201cNan Nan, ah, what do you think of the big grass next door?\u201d A person suddenly asked.Nan Xun was stunned for a moment. \u201cYou mean Ji Shaoqing?\u201dAnother person said with a smile: \u201cI heard that Ji Shaoqing and you were high school classmates and he\u2019s been chasing you since high school?\u201dNan Xun actually didn\u2019t expect Ji Shaoqing to attend this university. In the beginning, because of Li Chen\u2019s strict \u201cfamily education\u201d, she went to find Ji Shaoqing alone and explicitly refused him.She was convinced that his big boy pride wouldn\u2019t be willing to hear her words.Ji Shaoqing always thought she would apply for university A, so he was surprised to see her at university B.At that time, he also said, \u201cNan Nan, you have me in your heart, or why would you apply for this university?\u201dIt was so narcissistic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My father won\u2019t let me fall in love.\u201dSeveral people were stunned at first, then they laughed loudly.One person laughed and tears came out. \u201cNan Nan, your father is right. You\u2019re still small. Don\u2019t casually fall in love.\u201dNan Xun thought she was probably saying the opposite.In short, Nan Xun became the little white rabbit in everyone\u2019s eyes, especially cute and simple.The little white rabbit grows up day by day, getting closer and closer to adulthood.Nan Xun\u2019s heart suddenly quickened. \u201cLittle eight, why is my heart racing recently? I always have palpitations. I won\u2019t suddenly die, right?\u201dThe void beast comforted: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re just too nervous. This is a normal reaction. Relax, relax, just loosen your heart knot, you\u2019re not missing a piece of meat.\u201dNan Xun listened to his words and her heart suddenly jumped more.She shouldn\u2019t have asked little eight, really.These days, Nan Xun slept in Li Chen\u2019s embrace, she could feel his hot skin which was very frightening.Come on, ah, she was really scared.When the void beast saw that she was flustered, he was in a good mood and changed the topic, \u201cDear, don\u2019t forget that today is Li Chen\u2019s birthday~\u201dNan Xun sighed, \u201cEven if I forgot my own birthday, I don\u2019t dare forget his. When have I forgotten about his birthday?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s birthday was very close to Li Chen\u2019s, which meant she will soon be 18 after Li Chen\u2019s birthday, which was really a sad thing.In the afternoon, there was only one big class. After class, Nan Xun rode her bike to a famous ceramic shop nearby.This ceramic shop allows customers to create their own ceramic. Nan Xun spent a whole afternoon the other day, under the guidance of the ceramic teacher to knead a ceramic cup.At the bottom of the cup was her and Li Chen\u2019s names. After the cup was baked, she also engraved two cute cartoon cats on the top of the cup, kissing each other mouth-to-mouth, which looked especially cute.The shopkeeper already packed the cup. Nan Xun held it in her arms like a baby and exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ve never been so heartfelt towards a person, this time if Li Chen\u2019s evil value isn\u2019t lowered, I\u2019ll take his surname.\u201dThe void beast: \u201c\u2026In this world, your name is Li Xiao Nan, you already have his surname.\u201dNan Xun took things home and wanted to go back early to surprise Li Chen, but she answered the phone at this time. After that, her face changed.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. I think I have the VIP card. You, wait for me!\u201dNan Xun abandoned her bike and stopped a taxi. She hurriedly said to the driver, \u201cSir, go to Twilight at the business center.\u201dThe driver gave her a subtle look.Not everyone can enter Twilight. Those who can enter Twilight are those who have strong identities. But not being able to enter, doesn\u2019t mean that outsiders doesn\u2019t know. In fact, there were many people who knew about Twilight. But most of the time, they could only look at the luxuriously decorated door when they pass by, because they don\u2019t have a VIP card to enter and exit freely.Nan Xun knew the driver misunderstood her and quickly explained: \u201cSir, one of my female classmates has been cheated in Twilight. I must hurry and save her!\u201dWhen the driver uncle heard this, he became serious. \u201cLittle girl, it\u2019s useless to go alone. You have to call the police.\u201d\u201cIf this is a big problem, it\u2019s not good for my classmate. Uncle, you can rest assure. In a while, I will call my dad. Once he\u2019s there, no one will dare bully me.\u201dThe driver uncle saw she had a plan in mind and didn\u2019t talk nonsense. He immediately drove to the business center.When Nan Xun arrived, several roommates hurriedly cried at the door.\u201cNan Nan, do you really have a VIP card?\u201dNan Xun said nothing and immediately took out her cellphone and dialed a number. \u201cUncle Zhao, it\u2019s Nan Nan. I want to enter Twilight. Please let the people blocking the way let me in.\u201dAt the other end of the phone, Zhao Minghao dropped the cigarette from his mouth with a patter.He glanced at Li Chen who sat across from him and at the same time, took a look at several other friends. At last, he glanced at Yu Manshan, the beautiful girl who sat beside Li Chen. Suddenly, he felt his cellphone was a little hot.Today was Li Chen\u2019s birthday, because everyone in the circle knew that Li Chen never returns late, so he gathered everyone and chose a time in the afternoon to celebrate.The eldest young lady of the Yu family found out and came here uninvited and brought a few little sisters. No, everyone had a good time and several of them looked at each other.The location he naturally chose was his site, Twilight and the most luxurious box.When everyone saw him pick up the phone, he looked a little strange. They stopped the game and asked, \u201cBrother Zhao, are you checking up on your little mistress?\u201dAs soon as the words came out, everyone laughed loudly.Li Chen also slightly raised his eyes and looked at Zhao Minghao.Zhao Minghao\u2019s hand suddenly trembled and he accidently press\u2026the speaker button.Then, the soft, sweet and anxious voice came out, \u201cUncle Zhao, are you listening, ah? I want to enter Twilight now! You be careful if you don\u2019t let people outside let me in. I\u2019ll look for my dad and tell him you took liberties with me last time, humph!\u201dZhao Minghao was shivering all over and he looked sideways. The man sitting on the sofa was expressionless and stood up with a shudder. His face was as black as the bottom of a pot.\u201cHello? Uncle Zhao? You really don\u2019t care about me? Then I\u2019ll tell my dad about when you secretly poured me an alcoholic drink.\u201dZhao Minghao wanted to slap this little ancestor from saying anything else, then hurriedly said, \u201cNan Nan, wait a moment, uncle is in Twilight, I\u2019ll immediately pick you up!\u201dAfter Zhao Minghao left, a group of people rushed out. Li Chen was faster than him. The gloomy expression made Zhao Minghao scared and guilty.He and Yu Manshan joined together to handle Li Chen. They not only secretly muted his cellphone, but also just added something in his drink. Li Chen can\u2019t leave here, once he left, the consequences would be unimaginable.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Let Zhao Minghao send Nan Nan back. It\u2019s your birthday today. Are you going to spoil everyone\u2019s interest?\u201dLi Chen waved his hand and stared at Zhao Minghao coldly and walked out with his coat.Zhao Minghao quickly followed and glanced back at Yu Manshan, who lost her soul.She has given up too many things for Li Chen. She was only one year younger than Li Chen. At the age of 30, she wasn\u2019t married. She has been waiting for him for so many years. Wasn\u2019t what she done enough? She didn\u2019t care that Li Chen had a daughter, she was willing to be a stepmother. Why can\u2019t he accommodate her?Today, she was shamelessly out of her mind. She thought of this kind of dirty trick, but in the end, she can\u2019t make people stay. Ultimately, she doesn\u2019t know which cheap woman\u2026.Nan Xun also opened the phone while talking. She waved her cellphone to the two tall men in black who blocked her. She angrily said, \u201cNow, you know the relationship between me and your boss? Even when he sees me, he calls me great aunt. How dare you block me?\u201dThe men in black who blocked her quickly gave away. Nan Xun took several roommates and quickly ran in.The decoration inside Twilight was very luxurious, but few people were in the mood to appreciate it.\u201cWhich room is Xiaohe in?\u201d1\u201cWhen Xiaohe felt dizzy and wasn\u2019t well, she sent me a text message, she\u2019s in a private room called Shuitianyise.\u201dNan Xun found Shuitianyise, directly lifted her leg and kicked the door to the private room.When they saw the scene inside, the few roommates who had little knowledge had already screamed.Nan Xun didn\u2019t say anything. She stepped forward and kicked the man who was committing a crime.Fortunately, few people arrived in time and Xiaohe wasn\u2019t substantially hurt. However, she looked at the traces of dog bites on Xiaohe\u2019s neck and Nan Xun was so angry that she directly punched and kicked the man.The man wanted to fight back but found he couldn\u2019t beat the little girl in front of him. Soon he was beaten black and blue.Several roommates behind her were shocked by Nan Xun\u2019s ruthlessness.\u2026\u2026Li Chen hurriedly walked in front while Zhao Minghao trotted after him and quickly called the manager to ask, \u201cDid you see a beautiful little girl enter a room?\u201dWhen the manager heard the word, \u201ca\u201d, he thought about it and pointed to a private room. \u201cThere\u2019s a young woman in a white dress who entered Qianli Chanjuan.\u201dAs soon as Li Chen heard the words of wearing a white skirt, his eyes became more gloomy and he rushed towards the private room called Qianli Chanjuan like a storm.The door to the private room was unlocked. After Li Chen kicked the door open, the ugly scene inside made Li Chen\u2019s lust break open.He didn\u2019t see what the woman under the man looked like, but when he saw her exposed white dress, he lost his judgement at that moment.Li Chen\u2019s face turned black and blue with a flash in his head, then his mind blanked. He quickly walked to the man and woman who were addicted to lust and didn\u2019t even notice him. With his arms extended, he directly grabbed the man\u2019s neck and lifted him up. Then swung him to the ground and hit him hard.The man saw blood on his face the next moment and fainted before he could scream.Zhao Minghao was shocked and said in a loud voice: \u201cLi Chen! You can clearly see that woman isn\u2019t Li Xiao Nan!\u201dWhen Li Chen heard this, he slowly turned to the woman he didn\u2019t look at. When he found the strange face was distorted with fear, he was shocked.His hands were still trembling and stained with blood.\u201cNot baby\u2026\u201d He murmured and rose slowly.Li Chen\u2019s eyes were vicious, and he turned to the manager who led the way. The manager was cold and sweaty, then said: \u201cIn the time period of young Li\u2019s speech, except for this woman, there was a group of young girls. There was also a white skirt among them. They went straight to Shuitianyise as if they were looking for someone.\u201dThis time a few people just arrived at the door of Shuitianyise and heard Li Xiao Nan\u2019s vigorous shouting and swearing.Zhao Minghao breathed a sigh of relief. He wanted to pat Li Chen on the shoulder, but he felt air. The man had already pushed the door in.Then Zhao Minghao followed, just like Li Chen, he took half a step before he stood still.Zhao Minghao\u2019s eyes were so big while staring at the little girl in front of him who was like a little leopard with teeth and claws, where was the cute kid Li Xiao Nan from his memories?Before, when he saw Li Xiao Nan, he thought it was incredible, because Li Xiao Nan was so cute, how could a person like Li Chen have such a cute daughter?At that time, he once suspected that Li Xiao Nan wasn\u2019t part of the Li family.But now, tsk tsk, look at this little girl\u2019s ferocious beating. Now, he doesn\u2019t believe she\u2019s not from the Li family.\u201cNan Nan, Nan Nan stop! Someone\u2019s coming!\u201d When the frightened roommates saw Li Chen and Zhao Minghao, they suddenly regained their senses and quickly turned to Nan Xun and reminded her.Nan Xun cried out, \u201cAh?\u201d, then finally smashed another fist to make sure the scum man\u2019s face turned into a pig\u2019s head, then she stopped.She suddenly raised her head, and the bangs soaked with sweat swung along with the movement of her head. Her big bright eyes, with a never before fierce look, stared straight at the door.After seeing his face, Nan Xun jumped up and quickly straightened her skirt, she smoothed her messy hair, put her hands behind her and drew a circle on the ground with her foot. Then she sweetly cried, \u201cDad, how did you come here so fast?\u201dSince Li Chen sent someone to protect her secretly, the stalker will surely inform Li Chen of the news that she went to Twilight, but Nan Xun didn\u2019t expect the other party to come so soon.Nan Xun was wrong about this. Li Chen did send people to keep an eye on her, but he was in the VIP room on the second floor just now and his cellphone was muted by someone so he couldn\u2019t hear the news.Li Chen quietly stared at Nan Xun, his look was a bit strange, and there seemed to be something fermenting in his burning eyes.Under the dim light, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t see his face clearly and she was a little flustered.\u201cLittle Eight, I suddenly have a bad feeling. Do you think Li Chen will be scared when he sees my strong side, then the evil value will bounce back to 100?\u201dThe evil value rebounding was something that had happened before and little eight cried on the spot, \u201cYing ying ying, please tell me, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d2\u201cBaby, come, come to Dad.\u201d Li Chen suddenly opened his mouth, his voice as gentle as ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t dare look up and quickly recognized her mistake. \u201cDad, I was wrong. Don\u2019t casually hit people.\u201dLi Chen didn\u2019t answer. His big palm grabbed her small fist, pulled her up and left.Zhao Minghao saw this and suddenly thought of something. He wanted to open his mouth to remind him, but suddenly Li Chen looked back at him and couldn\u2019t say.It was a very meaningful look.Zhao Minghao\u2019s heart thumped.It shouldn\u2019t be what he thought?Did Li Chen know that Yu Manshan drugged his wine?Did he still drink it when he knew there was something wrong with it?Zhao Minghao was in a trance when he arranged people to ensure that several of Li Xiao Nan\u2019s friends were sent away safely, then thought about the problem.Nan Xun was dragged all the way out by Li Chen. The wind blew and the waves rolled, but she didn\u2019t fall.\u201cDad, Dad, I was really wrong. Please don\u2019t be angry\u2026\u201d Nan Xun admits her mistake the entire journey, trying to save her cute little lady image.However, Li Chen didn\u2019t seem to hear her words. At first, he dragged her away. Later, he just picked her up and rushed out.Although there were few people at this time, it was hard to guarantee that no one will see. Nan Xun struggled in Li Chen\u2019s arms. \u201cDad, it\u2019s better to let me down. It\u2019s not good to be seen by people.\u201dSuddenly, Li Chen came close to her ear, his breath hotter than her beating heart. His voice was low and seductive, \u201cWhatever other people think, only dad cares about you.\u201dNan Xun breathed a sigh of relief, \u201cDad, you\u2019re not angry?\u201dLi Chen suddenly smiled, and his voice became more muffled. \u201cWhy would dad be angry? Baby just now was so charming. Dad likes it very much.\u201dNan Xun listened to this and her whole body shivered.\u201cLittle eight, little eight, do you think Li Chen is normal now?\u201dThe void beast\u2019s voice was a little excited and immediately said, \u201cAccording to my experience over the years, your daddy Li Chen has been treated with aphrodisiac!\u201dNan Xun was dazed. Li Chen held her out of Twilight and a person opened the door for them.Li Chen couldn\u2019t wait to cram Nan Xun into the car, then he slammed the door shut. He turned around and went to the driver\u2019s seat. When he stepped on the accelerator, the car rushed out.Nan Xun hurriedly grasped the car\u2019s handlebar, and looked terrified: \u201cDad, can you drive slower, did you drink? We can\u2019t drive after drinking, we\u2019ll get into an accident! How about Zhao lao, the driver? Why didn\u2019t he drive dad?\u201dLi Chen continued to step on the accelerator, his face unchanged. \u201cBaby, don\u2019t worry, dad only drank a small cup, it\u2019s okay.\u201dHe was a good drinker. No one could make him drunk. In fact, he will never allow himself to become drunk. No one could calculate him under his eyes.Naturally, the reason why Yu Manshan succeeded was because he indulged it.He didn\u2019t think about it initially, but when he found out that Yu Manshan put medicine in his wine, he pushed the boat with the current.1 He had enough self-control to not lose consciousness because of the medicine. What he wanted was an excuse to eat Li Xiao Nan.Look, baby, it\u2019s not dad\u2019s fault. Dad was also calculated.He couldn\u2019t wait, it\u2019s been too long.Today was his birthday. Why couldn\u2019t he give himself a big meal? If his dream was fulfilled today, he will have no regrets in his life.2Li Chen\u2019s blood boiled, he has strong self-control and wasn\u2019t afraid of any drugs. But when he thought about the person he wanted was right behind him, he felt a fire course through his body and ran straight to his lower abdomen.Several times, Li Chen\u2019s car almost hit a wall and Nan Xun was scared.\u201cLittle eight, I won\u2019t die without finishing the task in a car accident, right?\u201dThe void beast comforted her. \u201cThink more, your daddy Li Chen\u2019s car skills is first-class, it\u2019s not a problem to star in an internationally acclaimed car racing movie.\u201dThe car drove all the way to the Li family\u2019s other villa. Li Chen hurriedly opened the door and carried Nan Xun on his shoulder into the house.Li Chen\u2019s appearance made Nan Xun very afraid. Although she had anticipated this day for a long time, now Li Chen\u2019s state was a little violent. She was afraid that he would ruin the flowers by accident.Just now, when Li Chen dragged her the entire way, she clearly felt the burning fire from his heart through his hot palm. Li Chen\u2019s sullen eyes looked as if he would swallow her at any time.Nan Xun was worried but found that Li Chen\u2019s movement were suddenly calm. He carried Nan Xun upstairs and put her on the bed, then sat down. His somewhat reddish eyes looked at her directly and softly asked, \u201cBaby, did you drink wine secretly, en?\u201dNan Xun quickly explained: \u201cDad, last time Uncle Zhao picked me up, he gave me a drink, I didn\u2019t think about drinking myself and only took a sip. Really! And this time, I went to Twilight because my roommate was cheated to go there by a scummy guy. That scummy guy wanted to do something bad, so I\u2026\u201dLi Chen slightly picked up his eyebrows and didn\u2019t seem to care why she went to Twilight. He turned to the glass wall cabinet in the hall and took a bottle of red wine and two tall glasses.Nan Xun\u2019s eyes were fixed on Li Chen. He opened the cork and filled the expensive red wine into the two glasses.\u201cBaby, don\u2019t you want to drink? You\u2019re going to be an adult soon. Dad allows you to drink.\u201d Li Chen didn\u2019t tense nor talk slow, but calmly handed her the glass.He didn\u2019t urge and looked at Nan Xun.\u201cDad, do you really want me to drink?\u201d Nan Xun asked, in fact, she likes to drink red fruit wine, but Li Chen was very strict. Before that, she secretly followed her cheap uncle, Zhao Minghao, to drink some.She saw that Li Chen wasn\u2019t joking and Nan Xun took the glass and took a sip.It was so strong that part of her face started to heat up, then burn.Nan Xun quickly pushed the wine to Li Chen\u2019s side. \u201cDad, this wine is too strong. I won\u2019t drink it.\u201dLi Chen took the glass and drank a few more sips along the edge of the cup where Nan Xun drank from.Nan Xun looked at his beautiful curved lips from the spot she just sipped from. He was dyed ruddy red and rosy by the red wine, and suddenly felt his body was burning more.\u201cLittle eight, ah, what kind of drug did Li Chen really take? I don\u2019t think he did, ah.\u201d Nan Xun said.The void beast hei hei. \u201cDon\u2019t you think he\u2019s in a rush like he was a moment ago on the road?\u201dNan Xun: \u201c\u2026Just was, but now he isn\u2019t, did the effects subside?\u201dThe void beast hei hei, \u201cYou\u2019re so calm on the surface, really first-class, but in fact, you\u2019re about to explode. But you\u2019re willing to deceive yourself, then make sauce~\u201dThe last syllable was lengthened and the mood rise.Li Chen drank and looked at the girl in front of him. His baby has grown up and looks so charming. In a moment, his heart flashed with a lot of pictures that was about to happen. Before it could happen, he felt he couldn\u2019t breathe well.Because he was so excited, he almost suffocated from excitement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes roamed from her forehead, eyebrows and eyes to her mouth, then the white beautiful neck, to the deeper part of her skirt. He suddenly drank all the wine in the cup, grabbed Nan Xun\u2019s waist with one hand and held her on his leg.\u201cWait, wait, I have a present for you.\u201d Nan Xun struggled for a while.Li Chen heard this, took a deep breath and let her down.Nan Xun unpacked the contents onto the table and took out the ceramic cups inside.Nan Xun smugly bumped the two cups and the two cats kissed each other. \u201cLook, I made it myself. Our names are on the bottom of the cup. Do you like it?\u201dLi Chen looked at the girl who smiled from the bottom of her eyes that were crooked into a crescent shape, then at the two carton kittens who pouted and kissed each other.Suddenly, he grunted, then swallowed.\u201cBaby, I like this gift very much, but can I ask you for another one?\u201d Li Chen asked.Nan Xun said, \u201cAs long as I have it, no matter what you want, I will give it to you.\u201dWhen Li Chen heard this, he began to release a burning and overbearing atmosphere from his body without hesitation. Then he suddenly put his hand around the back of Nan Xun\u2019s head and pressed her against him.At the next moment, the overwhelming passionate fiery kiss was released unscrupulously.The beast that has been locked for many years came out of the cage, roaring and shaking the earth.Soon, Nan Xun was quickly stripped like an egg without a shell.\u201cNan Nan, be obedient, I\u2019m going to love you.\u201d Li Chen said and kissed.Then, Nan Xun saw many stars, Chang\u2019e and the Jade Hare from thousands of miles.1 It was like she was high in the sky, in a spaceship, she was so uncomfortable from the oxygen deficiency. Fortunately, Li Chen took a few breaths from time to time and she didn\u2019t suffocate to death.Afterwards, Li Chen held her in his arms and kissed her skin, not even letting her toes off the hook.Nan Xun secretly scolded the old rogue and fell asleep.Li Chen licked her crystal white earlobe and sounded intoxicated in her ear. \u201cNan Nan, I love you\u2026\u201dThe next day, when Nan Xun woke up, the old rogue was gone. Her body was very fresh, it should be that yesterday, Li Chen cleaned her body.Nan Xun was like a dead fish lying in bed, her whole body felt it was run over by a truck and her bones were shattered.\u201cBa\u2019er ah, I tell you, if the evil value doesn\u2019t go down, I want to directly die.\u201d2Nan Xun took the initiative to call him and the void beast immediately sensed it and released his five senses. He said with some shyness: \u201cDear, I\u2019m sorry for you.\u201dNan Xun was shocked. \u201cWasn\u2019t the evil value reduced at all?\u201dThe void beast quickly said: \u201cNo, it did. The evil value dropped to 2 points.\u201dNan Xun breathed a sigh of relief. \u201cBaby, you scared me. Then, why do you say you\u2019re sorry for me?\u201dThe void beast said in a small voice: \u201cI was so happy yesterday that the evil value dropped so much. I wanted to share the news with you. As a result\u2026I forgot to continue to shield my five senses. So, I saw the picture of you entangled together. Short oil, so shy. Daddy Li Chen\u2019s figure is really great and really powerful~\u201dNan Xun: \u201c\u2026I want you to be afraid, I\u2019ll make you into minced meat sauce!\u201dThe void beast was so aggrieved. \u201cPeople weren\u2019t deliberate. Anyway, you were below. Daddy Li Chen smothered you to death. I didn\u2019t see anything that I shouldn\u2019t see.\u201d3Nan Xun was so tired that she used the quilt to directly cover her head.She covered herself to death.As soon as she closed her eyes, she thought of what happened last night. She could feel that Li Chen was a little overexcited. Now it was a miracle that she was lying in bed.Nan Xun suddenly heard footsteps and couldn\u2019t help but wrap herself tighter and cover her head to death.A big palm pulled it down and exposed her little head.Li Chen leaned over and asked for a lingering kiss. His thumb gently rubbed her face and said, \u201cI have already granted you sick leave. You stay and have a good rest at home for two days. It\u2019s already ten o\u2019clock. What do you want to eat? I\u2019ll personally cook for you.\u201dIt took a long time before Nan Xun answered with reddened eyes. \u201cYou\u2026I\u2026we, last night, we, we\u2026\u201d She was close to tears.Little eight secretly clapped his hands, \u201cYo he, acting is becoming more and more exquisite.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Li Chen took the person wrapped in the quilt into his arms and kissed the tip of Nan Xun\u2019s nose, then affectionately said: \u201cNan Nan, first tell me, did you hate what I did to you yesterday?\u201dNan Xun thought about it, shook her head and truthfully replied, \u201cNot bad, later very comfortable.\u201dThis sentence made Li Chen\u2019s body instantly congested.\u201cYou really\u2026will be tortured to death sooner or later.\u201d Li Chen took a deep breath.Nan Xun had no face and innocently asked little eight. \u201cDid I said something I shouldn\u2019t have? I just really described how I felt.\u201dLittle eight: \u201cNo, it\u2019s daddy Li Chen. He\u2019s too dirty and wants more.\u201dLi Chen hugged her for a moment and explained: \u201cNan Nan, I have no blood relationship with you. Dad wants to be your lover, not your dad.\u201dNan Xun didn\u2019t appear very surprised. She looked at the man in front of her and saw several golden beans rolled down from his narrowed eyes.4\u201cI, actually, I already knew for a long time, but I was always so afraid that you would suddenly not want me. So, I always pretended to not know.\u201dNan Xun sniffed and stuffily said: \u201cI overheard dad and grandpa talked long ago. Dad, you don\u2019t want me because of this?\u201dLi Chen was very surprised. He was a very vigilant person. When he talked with his old man, he made sure that Li Xiao Nan wasn\u2019t nearby, but now his baby said she already knew?However, Li Chen didn\u2019t have time to think about these problems. He felt that his baby was afraid and uneasy.\u201cSilly girl, I like you so much. It\u2019s too late, I love you, how can I not want you? Although we won\u2019t be father and daughter any longer, you will be the woman I love most.\u201d From time to time, Li Chen pecked and kissed her little mouth, saying affectionate words that he would never say in his life in order to comfort her uneasy heart.Nan Xun was very satisfied. From the bed, she stuck out her two white arms from the quilt and wrapped them around his neck and rubbed him with the tip of her nose. \u201cDad, remember what you said.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He placed her on the dining chair and went to the kitchen to cook.Soon, Li Chen came over with a pot of kelp rib soup, then carefully and thoughtfully filled a bowl for her and even raised the bowl to feed her.Little eight: \u201cThis one-stop service is really\u2026tsk tsk.\u201dNan Xun: \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous of me, if you have the ability, come and lose your integrity, ah.\u201dLittle eight: \u2026The next day, Old Li, who went out to travel with his old friends, came back. At a glance, he saw the subtle changes between the two, and his heart was complex, ah.He had expected there would be such a day, but he didn\u2019t expect Li Chen would be such a beast. It was only a few days before Nan Nan\u2019s 18th birthday, but he still managed people.What he was more troubled about was that this beast was his own.On Nan Xun\u2019s birthday, Li Chen asked her if she wanted to invite her classmates to visit her home. Nan Xun quickly shook her head and said she wanted to spend time with dad.Little eight was stupid and quickly asked: \u201cDon\u2019t you like to laugh happily, but refused so simply, this is unlike you, ah.\u201dNan Xun hummed: \u201cWe\u2019ve been together for so long and you still don\u2019t know Li Chen\u2019s virtues after all this time? He\u2019s digging a hole for me. If I say yes happily, even if he nods his head on the surface, I\u2019m sure he will be upset. Can\u2019t you feel people\u2019s happiness, anger and sorrow? Isn\u2019t Li Chen stealthily happy now?\u201dLittle eight: \u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dLi Chen prepared a super luxurious multi-layered cake and a romantic candlelight dinner for Nan Xun. Nan Xun had enough to eat and her stomach was bulging.\u201cDad, I\u2019m full,\u201d Nan Xun said.Li Chen looked at her, his eyes resembling a wolf, \u201cBut baby, dad\u2019s not full.\u201dNan Xun hurriedly pushed the cake that she gnawed out of shape in front of him, \u201cThis is for dad to eat.\u201dLi Chen didn\u2019t move and directly stared at her. \u201cBaby, dad doesn\u2019t want to eat this.\u201dNan Xun: This beast!Then, a certain animal carried Nan Xun upstairs. That night, he ate people thoroughly from the outside to the inside, from top to bottom, from front to back.These unscrupulous days lasted for more than two months. Nan Xun sat in the school library in a daze.\u201cLittle eight, ah, Li Chen\u2019s evil value hasn\u2019t dropped at all?\u201d Nan Xun asked the void beast.The void beast anxiously said, \u201cYes, not even 0.1! What\u2019s the matter with your daddy Li Chen? Now that he\u2019s very happy and satisfied, why isn\u2019t the evil value falling?\u201dNan Xun thought: \u201cYou say, do you think it was because I was too easy to get?\u201dThe void beast thought, \u201cIt\u2019s very possible.\u201dNan Xun snapped her finger and pointed out, \u201cWell, let\u2019s make a big escape.\u201d\u00b71Li Xiao Nan was gone.Li Xiao Nan would return home on time every day but didn\u2019t return today. At first, Li Chen thought something delayed his little baby, until the people who secretly protected Li Xiao Nan said the miss was gone.The two bodyguards in black knelt on the floor and shivered.\u201cOld Li,2 we have been monitoring the miss\u2019s every move according to your instructions. On the way back, she went to the public restroom. We waited outside, but we didn\u2019t see her come out for a long time. Then we rushed in and found the miss was gone.\u201dLi Chen turned his thumb, his eyes were cold and his face dark.No one knew that he looked calm on the surface, but his heart had already ignited the sky with anger.He knew his recent methods were a little radical. He unscrupulously pulled out some old cavities in the group, which may hurt the interests of some people, especially those who followed his father, but it was better than if they were against him. If they hurt his heart, he will make those people unhappy and happy to die!Li Chen used his remaining reason to arrange for a search. Most of his manpower was devoted to track a few old people who have conflicts of interest with him. The rest guarded places where Li Xiao Nan often haunted.The high-intensity work lasted for a whole month.The lights in the living room weren\u2019t turn on. Li Chen sat in the corner of the sofa, puffing clouds from his mouth, casting a dark shadow on the ground which looked lonely.Old Li turned on the light with a \u201cpa\u201d, and saw what Li Chen looked like. In the daytime, he handled his official business as if nothing had happened to him. But in the evening, his whole person collapsed.The hall was filled with acrid suffocating smoke. Li Chen sat on the sofa with his eyes slightly narrowed. The ashtray in front of him was full of cigarette butts and there was a cigarette between his fingers. The smoke rose from his fingers.\u201cLi Chen, ah, Nan Nan hasn\u2019t been found yet?\u201dLi Chen didn\u2019t speak.Old Li hesitated for a moment and said: \u201cYou should have seen that Nan Nan has been abducted by your enemies, but\u2026she left herself.\u201dWhen Li Chen heard this, his body finally froze. He turned his head and looked at old Li. His eyes were as sharp as a torch and he said in a deep voice, \u201cNan Nan won\u2019t leave me. I love her so much. Why would she want to leave me?\u201dOld Li said: \u201cWhy were you together? You should know better than anyone. Did Nan Nan really love you or mistakenly regarded it as fatherly love? She may have heard some gossip and finally found out she was abnormal with you. She couldn\u2019t bear the blow for a while, so she ran away from home. Give Nan Nan some time and she will come back when she thinks it over.\u201dOld Li said this, patted him on the shoulder and left.Li Chen looked up at the dazzling crystal lights on the ceiling. His red eyes seemed to flash with blood under the light.Was this really the case?Li Xiao Nan accepted him so easily, but simply took this as father\u2019s orders? She habitually obeyed him, or habitually pleased him. In her heart, she was more eager to return to their original father-daughter relationship?However, this was impossible.He has lived such a big life and never actively pursued a woman. Li Xiao Nan was the first and last.He didn\u2019t want it, even if he was wronged, he wouldn\u2019t eat.3 Just like the woman who called herself Li Xiao Nan\u2019s mother, when she gave him medicine, he would rather bear the burning pain himself and let his personal doctor come cure him and wouldn\u2019t take the calculating woman to bed.He gave the woman his own bodyguard. It was funny that woman thought she got what she wanted, to be the wife of the Li family\u2019s young master with a child.He thought to himself that Li Xiao Nan\u2019s fate couldn\u2019t be avoided, as she was born with a predestined affinity. She was born to belong to him!Li Chen was silent. Suddenly, he slowly smiled deeply, and his eyes flashed with an icy light.\u201cBaby, do you want to reconnect with me as father-daughter again? I tell you, it\u2019s absolutely impossible. This time you were too unscrupulous. When dad finds you, you must be punished\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not good, not good, I don\u2019t know what happened just now. Your daddy Li Chen\u2019s blackening value jumped to 100!\u201d The void beast suddenly screamed.Nan Xun, who was eating a large bowl of noodles on the side of the road, almost spewed it out from her mouth because of his ghostly roar.\u201cWhat\u2019s the fuss, it\u2019s not like the evil value rebounded to 100. Blacken it. I only care about the evil value.\u201d Nan Xun took a piece of napkin and slowly wiped her mouth gracefully.The fussy void beast: \u2026Once again, the void beast was conquered by Nan Xun\u2019s powerful heart.He thought Nan Xun didn\u2019t understand the meaning of the word, \u201cblackening\u201d. Anyway, it was Nan Xun who would suffer this time. Anyway, when the moment of hardship arrives, would Nan Xun still not care about it?Before, the void beast always thought Nan Xun was particularly stupid, but now he can confirm she is stupid. She had prepared things to escape and didn\u2019t dare take the different gold cards Li Chen gave her. She left with only one hundred yuan.Nan Xun first shook off the tail that was secretly stalking, then went to find Li Rong Rong, who once had a close relationship with her. This woman was now amazing. Then after seeing her, Li Rong Rong prepared a fake ID card for Nan Xun and provided a small sum of money.Nan Xun could use this money for at least ten years without doing anything but eat and drink. But in order to avoid Li Chen, Nan Xun specialized in eating at roadside stalls. Even if Li Chen was dead, he wouldn\u2019t think of this. His spoiled baby has only eaten delicacies but went to eat these things.More than that, Nan Xun also changed her hair style. Her long hair turned into shoulder length resembling a student, and she wore an old dress with a pair of black frame glasses. The whole person looked very dull.No one could imagine it was Li Xiao Nan a month ago.Nan Xun, who was full of food and drink, directly carried her bag to the destination, a famous scenic spot in S province.The void beast said, \u201cYou\u2019re a wastrel, all your money has been spent for traveling.\u201dNan Xun hummed: \u201cDo you think Li Chen is a vegetarian? I just have a perfect plan. Within three months, Li Chen will find me. Anyway, the final result is the same. Why should I grieve? And you think, a fugitive, would she be in the mood to go sightseeing? This is the opposite of what I would do. Li Chen can\u2019t guess I\u2019m going around now.\u201dThe void beast was speechless.\u201cDon\u2019t forget the task.\u201d The void beast said dryly.Nan Xun was flying free for another month.On this day, the weather was clear and cloudless. Nan Xun was lying on the prairie, her heart resting on her arm, looking at the boundless blue sky, her eyes squinting comfortably.The surroundings were very quiet, she could hear the sound of the wind. The warm wind brushed her face and made her itch.When people are quiet, it was always easy to think of something that was sealed in their hearts.She thought of Xue Ming, the man who carried her on his back and walked on the hillside planted with demonic flowers. It was a very beautiful magical flower. The black petals were dotted with little red dots. The small glowing insects flew in the night sky, illuminating the red dots on the magic flowers. The red dots flashed with the spiritual insects in the night, like countless red stars.The night was beautiful, and the man\u2019s shoulders was very wide and solid.She also thought of the paranoid ghost Fu Yu. Every night, he held her tightly in his arms as if he held the most precious treasure in the world.Then she thought of Li Chen.She thought, then thought of everything, all this she blamed on this familiar feeling \u2013during pancakes, a sense of trepidation echoed from the depths of her soul. There were some things she didn\u2019t want to think about, because the more she thought, the more it fetters.Da da da.Nan Xun seemed to hear the sound of a horse running. She sat up and looked into the distance, and soon saw a small brown spot.Someone came over on horseback.All of a sudden, the void beast interjected, \u201cI wish you good luck.\u201dThen Nan Xun could see the man.She didn\u2019t expect Li Chen to come so soon.The man didn\u2019t change into riding equipment and wore a casual suit.The horse stopped more than 20 meters away. The man jumped down from the horse with his long legs and approached her.The sun was behind the man, his expression was in the shadow and couldn\u2019t be seen, but Nan Xun saw his curled hands, his taut long legs and tight muscles. He walked with great strides, bigger and faster.Grunt.Nan Xun swallowed a mouthful of saliva.After her eyes wandered around, Nan Xun suddenly raised the corners of her mouth into a smile, then ran towards people and began to express her yearning. \u201cDad, I miss you very much\u2014\u201dThe void beast almost choked to death on his own saliva.What a fickle woman. Oh no, it should be said that Nan Xun\u2019s ability to adapt to the situation was too strong. Look at this smiling face, how sincere.Nan Xun rushed to Li Chen. When she was about to collide into him, she jumped onto him with her legs hooked onto his waist and her hands around his neck. Her face rubbed his side. \u201cDad, Dad, I miss you, I miss you every day for the two months I was away.\u201dDuring the conversation, Nan Xun sneaked a glance, looking at Li Chen\u2019s mouth that slightly hooked at the corners and her heart jumped abruptly.To suffer, when he smiles like this, it meant someone was going to be unlucky!Now there was only two people here. Who was the unlucky person besides her?Nan Xun hugged Li Chen tighter. \u201cDad, why are you here? People was preparing to go back.\u201dLi Chen didn\u2019t speak or return her embrace. After a long time when Nan Xun was about to slide down from him, he stretched out his hand and held her little buttocks.Then he held her with one hand and walked back in silence.Nan Xun was held up by him, then heard Li Chen\u2019s \u201cdriving\u201d sound. The horse under him started to gallop with their legs spread apart and ran across the prairie.The speed was a little fast and it was very bumpy.Nan Xun clung onto Li Chen. \u201cDad, slow down. I\u2019m afraid.\u201dLi Chen glanced at her slightly and finally said his first sentence, \u201cBaby, you were really disobedient. So, I will punish you now.\u201dAfter that, he embraced Nan Xun against himself and lifted her skirt.There was a horse running across the prairie very fast, then immediately afterwards, a flower opened, and someone was crying.Nan Xun was carried back to the car by Li Chen. She didn\u2019t know what happened in between, she really didn\u2019t know a thing.Nan Xun asked little eight if anything happened in the middle of the journey. Little eight ah, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Ah, I couldn\u2019t see or hear anything during the whole journey, ah. The entire time, daddy Li Chen was making pancakes. And the pancakes were made, there was different pancakes from the strength ah, angle ah and posture ah.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no way Li Chen wasn\u2019t protected closely. With his position, he was still a gangster since his ancestors mixed with them. He didn\u2019t feel at ease without any bodyguards.But this time, in order to find someone, Li Chen didn\u2019t even bring his bodyguards.\u201cThey move in the dark.\u201d Li Chen faintly replied.Nan Xun saw his cold appearance and understood he was still angry. Although he ran a few laps, he was still angry.1Nan Xun obediently stopped talking and planned to go to sleep. However, just as she closed her eyes, Li Chen\u2019s face suddenly changed, and he pushed her down onto the seat.The next moment, Nan Xun heard gunshots and her eyes widened.\u201cLi Chen!\u201d Nan Xun shouted.Li Chen touched her head. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid baby. You lie there, don\u2019t get up.\u201d Even at this time, his tone wasn\u2019t urgent.\u201cZhao lao, continue driving.\u201d Li Chen said in a deep voice.The driver Zhao lao obviously saw the scene. As soon as he turned his hand, the car swiveled back and forth on the road, so that the people following him couldn\u2019t aim at their target.Li Chen took out a black pistol with a silencer from a dark box, aimed it at the rear glass window, then focused at a point and fired several shots in succession.Nan Xun heard the harsh brakes screeching from a distance. It seemed that the driver was killed by Li Chen and one of their tires burst.At this time, the bodyguards who followed Li Chen in the dark had already started a gun battle with the people in the car, and there were the sounds of gunshots for a long time.When the gunshots finally stopped, Li Chen suddenly said, \u201cZhao lao, turn around.\u201dZhao lao cursed softly, \u201cOld Li, someone certainly leaked your whereabouts!\u201dLi Chen\u2019s eyes became extremely cold, but because of the ignorant girl, he slightly restrained his killing intent in his eyes.He held Nan Xun in his arms and gently patted her back. \u201cBaby don\u2019t be afraid. Nan Nan don\u2019t be afraid. The bad guys have been caught. Dad will take you to look.\u201dThe scene was very chaotic. A small truck with a flat tire. Seven or eight men in casual clothes were lifeless, their chests were like a wasp\u2019s nest covered with bullet holes. The only one alive was kicked to kneel on the ground by the bodyguard in black.\u201cOld Li, look, is this sole survivor going to be tortured?\u201dLi Chen suddenly hooked his lips and held Nan Xun to his chest, imprisoned her in his arms, then softly whispered close to her ear: \u201cNan Nan, this man was about to kill dad just now. Do you think he should be damned?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s tongue was a little knotted, \u201cDeserve, damned.\u201dLi Chen was like the devil and lowly mumbled in repetition, his voice sounded in her ear, in a bewitching way: \u201cNan Nan come kill him to get revenge for dad, okay, en?\u201dNan Xun\u2019s expression froze, and quickly said: \u201cDad, it\u2019s better to send this bad guy to the police station.\u201dLi Chen listened to this, laughed out loud and pinched her little pink face. \u201cNan Nan is so cute. We have to do things according to the rules of the road. The police shouldn\u2019t wade in muddy water.\u201dHe said, then handed the pistol in Nan Xun\u2019s hand, held her waist from behind, \u201cCome, Nan Nan, kill him, kill him to avenge dad.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s hand was shaking. She could hardly hold the gun.The man looked at the muzzle of the gun she held and yelled, \u201cOld Li, you can\u2019t kill me, you don\u2019t know who wants to secretly kill you!\u201dLi Chen disregarded him and only patiently taught the girl.\u201cQuickly, Nan Nan. If you do well, dad will reward you.\u201d Li Chen said with enthusiasm.Come on, Nan Xun was about to cry.Li Chen reluctantly sighed, \u201cNan Nan is really not obedient. If it can\u2019t be done well, come, dad will help you.\u201d At the end of his words, his big palm suddenly encircled Nan Xun. She was unprepared when the trigger was pulled by their fingers.Then there was a peng peng thump, the gun shot the middle of the man\u2019s forehead and heart.2Nan Xun watched the big living man fall down in front of her. He twitched on the ground a few times, then took his last breath. Her breathing became fast and her heart pounded.\u201cHandle it here.\u201d Li Chen coldly ordered.Until she was picked up by Li Chen into the car, Nan Xun\u2019s mind was blank.\u201cYing ying ying, little eight, I killed, what should I do, ah, ying ying ying\u2026\u201dThe void beast comforted her. \u201cIt\u2019s not you who killed, it\u2019s your daddy Li Chen who killed. He was the one who pulled the trigger. Don\u2019t think too much. Besides, there were a lot of human lives that person extinguished with his own hands, consider it as removing a harm from society.\u201dNan Xun was still stunned for a while. The high tension just now made her physically and mentally tired, and she soon fell asleep.She didn\u2019t know how long the bumpy road was, finally, it quiet down. In a daze, Nan Xun felt cold on her feet and heard a tinkling sound.Nan Xun mumbled, turned over and continued to sleep.When Nan Xun woke up, she looked at the long gold chain which was fasten on her ankle and her whole person was confused.\u201cLittle eight, what happened when I was asleep?\u201dShe didn\u2019t know why, but the void beast\u2019s voice was very excited, \u201cYe3 actually saw the legendary little black house play with my own eyes!4 From my own eyes, I saw how delicate the foot chain is, ah. I estimate that daddy Li Chen had someone make it since a month ago. Oh right, something must have occupied his mind while you were gone. He\u2019s afraid that you\u2019ll run again, so he tied a chain to your leg. Hee hee.\u201dNan Xun raised her ankle chain and looked at it. Then she put it on her teeth and bit it. She cried out, \u201cLittle eight, it\u2019s pure gold!\u201dLittle eight: \u2026\u2026Is there something wrong with this woman\u2019s focus?\u201cSuch a long one, and it\u2019s all gold, ah. It\u2019s worth a lot of money. What\u2019s more, you can see how delicate the foot chain is polished, ah. If I can take it when I go to the next world, it would be fine.\u201dLittle eight: \u2026The most \u201csatisfied\u201d thing he met in his life was Nan Xun, a person with great nerves.The length of the chain was particularly suitable. It restricted her two or three steps from the bedroom door, but Nan Xun couldn\u2019t reach it. She bent her body 90 degrees, but still couldn\u2019t reach the doorknob.Nan Xun was glad the chain was long enough for her to use the bathroom.Surrounded by silence, Nan Xun roared a few times, and no one responded.It was useless to be alone in such a big villa, old Li wasn\u2019t here, as if it was only possessed by Li Chen.She was the only one left in this whole big villa alone, perhaps\u2026with a beast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I have a big belly. It\u2019s okay to eat two more bowls of noodles. Good little eight, no problem, give me one to eat~\u201dLittle eight: \u201c\u2026\u2026Okay.\u201dThe coquettish woman really made it difficult for the beast to refuse.Nan Xun, who had eaten the pigu pill, tumbled around in bed bored.Little eight asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dNan Xun said, \u201cThis is a very soft and comfortable bed, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t sleep in the next world.\u201dLittle eight oh, \u201cOf course, should sleep more.\u201dNan Xun was surprised \u201cLittle eight, why does it sound like you\u2019re a little flustered.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t panic. I\u2019ve already thought about the next world. Your birth isn\u2019t very good.\u201d Little eight finished and hummed a song.Nan Xun had a bad premonition, but little eight didn\u2019t reveal the next world despite her life and death.She didn\u2019t know how long it took, but when night fell, Li Chen finally came back.Nan Xun stared at the door. When the door opened with a squeak, she dashed towards the visitor and tried to pounce into his arms.As a result, she forgot she had a chain on her ankle and almost fell to the ground. Thanks to Li Chen\u2019s quick two strides, she was in his arms which saved her from eating the floor.Nan Xun hugged him and said with a very aggrieved expression. \u201cDad, where have you been? I haven\u2019t seen you all day.\u201dThere was a bit of tiredness between Li Chen\u2019s eyebrows. Nan Xun guessed that something had happened during his absence.Li Chen didn\u2019t say a word, just took her to bed, then began to frantically make pancake.The cake was baked repeatedly and shrieked.Come on, she was going to die.Finally, Nan Xun cried and became a dog, she was nestled in his arms and said, \u201cDad, I was wrong, I\u2019ll never run again.\u201dLi Chen hugged her, kissed her earlobe, and said in a deep voice: \u201cNan Nan, if you do something wrong, you\u2019ll be punished. This punishment isn\u2019t over.\u201dNan Xun regretted it and her intestines were green.However, there was no medicine for regrets in the world.\u201cDad, can you unlock the foot chain first. I have some pain.\u201d Nan Xun looked at the man beside her with tears in her eyes.Li Chen took her foot and looked at it. He really saw red marks. He frowned slightly and thought for a long time. He took out the key from his pocket and opened the lock with a snap.At this moment, Nan Xun was so moved that she immediately hugged Li Chen and gave him a big kiss, \u201cThank you dad!\u201dLi Chen stroked her beautiful little face, his eyes were very gentle and said, \u201cYou can take it off when dad is here, but when dad isn\u2019t here, Nan Nan still has to wear it.\u201dCome on, what else can Nan Xun say.She rushed over and rubbed her face on Li Chen and said very cleverly, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s okay as long as your happy.\u201dAfterwards, Li Chen went to the dining room with Nan Xun, and personally cooked two bowls of noodles. The father and daughter both ate one bowl. Although neither of them talked, the atmosphere was very warm.Only after eating half a bowl, Nan Xun couldn\u2019t eat. After eating the pigu pill, she wasn\u2019t very hungry.Li Chen looked at her faintly, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t to baby\u2019s taste?\u201dNan Xun surveyed the overcast eyes and hurriedly shook her head and continued to eat a big mouthful. Her heart was full of tears.Little eight snorted in a small voice, \u201cIt\u2019s worth it.\u201d2Nan Xun: \u2026When they finished eating, Li Chen was washing the dishes and Nan Xun suddenly hugged his waist from behind.Li Chen paused.\u201cDad, are you still angry that I left without saying bye?\u201dThe tip of Nan Xun\u2019s nose rubbed against his white shirt and her voice was stuffy, \u201cDad, I can explain. I like dad very much. No, I love dad, but I wasn\u2019t sure if my feelings towards you were abnormal. I was more worried that dad didn\u2019t love me. If I can\u2019t love him for a lifetime, I\u2019d like to stay as a relative, so you can never abandon me. Dad, do you understand? I was just worried. I love you so much. Dad you\u2019re so kind and I don\u2019t know what to say. I was afraid that one day dad would suddenly not love me\u2026\u201dAt the end, Nan Xun sobbed softly.It seems it took Li Chen a while to digest this passage because he kept the previous position for a long time without moving.At some point, he suddenly turned around and looked at the little sweet mouth in front of him.With a thump, his heart beat abruptly.Nan Xun was frightened by his scarlet eyes!After a careful look, those eyes weren\u2019t red, but more blood-red. The more she looked at that red, she felt a sense of relief.Li Chen stretched out his long arms and pulled her into his embrace. He could probably break Nan Xun\u2019s small waist if his strength was a little stronger.\u201cThe evil value dropped by 1 point, there\u2019s only one point left!\u201d Little eight\u2019s voice suddenly interrupted at this time and sounded extremely excited.\u201cCome on, go on, say all kinds of love endearments! Don\u2019t stop, don\u2019t stop!!\u201d Little eight was so excited that he wanted to take over Nan Xuns mouth and repeat love phrases.When Nan Xun heard the evil value decreased, she suddenly felt she could fight 300 rounds with her light body.So, instead of listening to little eight, she hugged the man in front of her and shyly said, \u201cLi Chen, I still want you.\u201dLittle eight: \u2026!What the fuck! Fucking hell!High, this move was too high. What\u2019s the point? Fight with the demon directly!The meaning of Nan Xun\u2019s sentence was very obvious. Li Chen inhaled a deep breath and couldn\u2019t wait to hold her and walked straight to the bedroom.When the two demon fought halfway through, little eight couldn\u2019t help but cry out, \u201cDear, the evil value is zero! We did it!\u201dAfter saying this, little eight continued to block his five senses. Just now, he just wanted to report the progress and didn\u2019t open his ears and eyes, so he couldn\u2019t hear or see anything.But even so, the experienced little eight has already guessed which stage the two people\u2019s battle was at. It must be the most intense and hottest. The earth was shaking, the auspicious clouds were floating, and the birds were singing the entire time.Knowing that Li Chen\u2019s evil value was eliminated, Nan Xun had some thoughts. At some point, she held Li Chen\u2019s arm firmly.Thank you, Li Chen.That night, Nan Xun was sleeping sweetly with Li Chen who was blackened nearby.Li Chen didn\u2019t sleep. He always looked at the woman in his arms. His eyes were gentle and watery, sometimes dark and deep, but without exception, they were warm as a fire.When Nan Xun woke up the next day, Li Chen disappeared.Nan Xun moved her foot, jingling and the gold chain was fastened on her foot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why is he always gone?\u201dLittle eight who was in a good mood, knew everything, \u201cYour daddy Li Chen spent a lot of energy to look for you during this period and didn\u2019t manage the secret forces. As a result, some people with ill-intentions united and dug a hole. But you can rest assure that daddy Li Chen is very powerful. Within five days at most, these people can no longer afford to create waves.\u201dAfter a pause, little eight tentatively asked, \u201cShall we leave the world now?\u201dNan Xun made a move and whispered: \u201cGive me two more days.\u201dLittle eight was silent for a moment and replied good.That night, when Li Chen came back with Nan Xun\u2019s favorite pastry, she could see some fatigue between his eyebrows, but the moment he saw Nan Xun, all of it disappeared.\u201cNan Nan, I dealt with everything. I\u2019ll be with you tomorrow.\u201d Li Chen took Nan Xun in his arms and spoke tenderly and affectionately.Nan Xun docilely leaned on his arms and suddenly said: \u201cLi Chen, let\u2019s go out tomorrow.\u201dLi Chen smiled and asked, \u201cWhere do you want to play baby?\u201dNan Xun answered, \u201cWe can go anywhere, as long as you accompany me.\u201dThe next day, Li Chen took her to the shooting range they often frequent.Nan Xun proficiently loaded the gun and aimed it at the bull\u2019s eye.Right in the heart.Li Chen hugged her from behind and his large palm rubbed her waist, his thin lips kissed her earlobe, smiled and lowly said: \u201cIndeed, my baby was really taught by me. The marksmanship will soon be on par with me.\u201dNan Xun had some doubts if this wasn\u2019t an open shooting range, Li Chen would probably breed some dirty ideas.After having a good time, they walked hand in hand.At this time, little eight\u2019s voice suddenly rang, \u201cWhat the fuck, this isn\u2019t good! There\u2019s a traitor here aiming at daddy Li Chen. There\u2019s a sniper ambush in the dark! Now, he\u2019s going to shoot!\u201dNan Xun\u2019s face greatly changed. At that moment, her body reacted first in response to her brain. She rushed to Li Chen and firmly stood in front of him.The next second, she heard her heart explode.Her body fell backwards, and she saw Li Chen\u2019s stunned expression. But after a second, the man\u2019s eyes shrank, and he pulled her into his arms in a panic. He cried out, \u201cNan Nan! Li Xiao Nan!\u201dNan Xun\u2019s mouth constantly had blood rushing out. Her hands tightly grasped the white shirt in front of Li Chen\u2019s chest. \u201cLi\u2026Chen\u2026\u201dShe originally wanted to say, \u201cyou have to live well\u201d, but the results were these two words that were swallowed.Come on, the TV was full of lies. Why did she lose her breath and couldn\u2019t finish speaking? People on TV could say many words of farewell before they died!Nan Xun\u2019s soul was drawn from the body. She looked at the man holding Li Xiao Nan\u2019s body and clearly saw the light in his eyes rapidly fading and becoming hollow.Li Chen lost Li Xiao Nan, as if he had lost\u2026 the whole world.Little eight cried on the side, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, dear. I forgot to shield your pain just now. Was it very painful ah?\u201dNan Xun quietly looked at Li Chen, en, then said, \u201c\u2026Very painful.\u201dAfter a pause, her eyes suddenly moved away from Li Chen and faintly said, \u201cSo, you should compensate me in the next world.\u201dLittle eight: \u201cDon\u2019t worry child. Brocade garments, jade meals, don\u2019t worry about food and clothing. Cough, I know you don\u2019t want pancakes and spaceships. The next world meets your conditions.\u201dNan Xun nodded. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dNan Xun\u2019s soul was twisted in the dark. This time, one person and one beast seemed to spend extra time in the dark. At last, at a certain moment, it was bright and she and little eight arrived in the next world.It was just that Nan Xun didn\u2019t taste what she wore in this world and heard a pa, exceptionally crisp.Then her head was smacked on one side, her face was burning, and her mouth was suddenly filled with blood.Nan Xun\u2019s heart was filled with fire, she wasn\u2019t a person who easily suffered. She saw the woman\u2019s hand that slapped her in front of her. Then she waved her hand and pa pa twice on the woman\u2019s face. She was thrown to the ground and was dazed on the spot.\u201cAudacious! You cheap person have the cheek to injure zhen\u2019s favorite fei!\u201d1 A sharp shout unexpectedly sounded.The next moment, Nan Xun flew high in the air, then landed on the ground with a peng and spat out blood.Little eight quickly helped her block the pain, but even with the pain blocked, the injury still remained.Nan Xun didn\u2019t dare move her body casually. She thought her bones might be broken. She slowly looked up at the man and woman in front of her while lying on the ground.The woman\u2019s clothes were gorgeous, with gold hairpins and flower pearls inserted on her head and glass bells on her ears. Although there were two bloodshot palm prints on her face, it wasn\u2019t difficult to see the face was very delicate. She hid in the man\u2019s arms and wept as if greatly wronged.And the man, Nan Xun was stunned after she saw his face.The man was very good-looking. He wore a red five-clawed dragon robe and had a high nose. It seems that his eyebrows gave a strong sense of heroism. However, his eyes were full of disgust. After watching for a long time, Nan Xun could see a trace of killing intent and hatred.The man glanced at her coldly and indifferently said: \u201cQin guifei2 managed to lose her virtue today and is demoted to the cold palace for striking the beauty. She must enter and shut herself to ponder over her mistakes, zhen commands that no one can visit!\u201dThen, Nan Xun, who was still confused, was rudely carried by two eunuchs to the cold palace. There was no one in the cold palace except her little personal servant girl, Cuihuan, who she brought into the palace.Little eight hehe and ridiculed mercilessly. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you could leave in three days? You impulsively slapped Li Shu fei twice and was beaten into the cold palace?\u201dNan Xun directly scolded the beast, \u201cDamned little eight, you let me be slapped in the face as soon as I wear it. You should hope I don\u2019t find you to settle the debt! You are fully aware of my temper and definitely knew I would return a pa pa twice, but unexpectedly you let me wear this at this time?\u201d3What\u2019s more, what about the brocade garments and jade meals? What about a good identity? As soon as I came, I became the abandoned fei in the cold palace, where is the brocade garments and jade meals!\u201dThe more that Nan Xun said, the more little eight was at fault.\u201cInside\u2026 you really did grow up with a golden spoon? You are the great general Qin\u2019s di granddaughter,4 don\u2019t you know your grandfather? He has many pillboxes.5 He and the late emperor fought together to beat down the world! Laoye zi is a person of virtue and prestige. No one disrespects him, even the late emperor.\u201d6Nan Xun immediately heard and asked, \u201cYou know that you\u2019re talking about the late emperor, right? Is the current emperor the late emperor ah? Is he? I ask you, doesn\u2019t the tyrant think Qin laoye zi is powerful and wants to eradicate him?\u201d\u201cShort oil, you\u2019re suddenly so smart, I\u2019m not used to it ah.\u201dNan Xun: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The man just held her body for five days. He didn\u2019t eat or drink. If it wasn\u2019t for the occasional tremor of his eyelashes, maybe no one would have thought he was still alive.His eyes were hollow and empty, but his eyes always fell on the body in his arms, which had no body temperature for a long time.After watching this entire time, his empty eyes would occasionally flash with a ray of tenderness, which was his most energetic moment in the day.Except for the cold body in his arms, he seemed to have forgotten everything. This was his all, his treasure, he won\u2019t allow anyone else to touch.\u201cLi Chen.\u201d Old Li gave a low cry.However, the man gave no response.After this incident, the old man looked even older. His eyes looked at the walking corpse, then sighed for a long time.He felt pain because he watched Li Xiao Nan grow up. In his eyes, she was his granddaughter. But compared with Li Chen, his pain was insignificant.Li Chen loved Li Xiao Nan as if she was his heart, even if she wanted the stars and the moon in the sky, he would find a way to pluck them for her.He loves her more than his own life.And it was such a person who was more important than Li Chen\u2019s life who died or blocked the bullet for him. He saw her rushing to him with his own eyes. She didn\u2019t even hesitate as she desperately block the bullet that should have pierced his chest.The girl\u2019s mouth flowed with dazzling blood that quickly rushed out. She could only call his name before she swallowed her last breath in front of Li Chen.Ordinary people would have been shocked, guilty and grateful, but for Li Chen who personally witnessed this scene with his own eyes, could only collapse.Li Xiao Nan did save his life, but for Li Chen, this wasn\u2019t salvation, it was a punishment.He would rather die than for Li Xiao Nan to die or die with Li Xiao Nan.He will soon be with her if he doesn\u2019t drink or eat for five days and nights.The Li Chen in front of old Li could be described as haggard, pale and totally lost his former fierce spirit.He was a man who was indifferent and calm. There was nothing that could make him feel panicked. He was a hunter. After a loss, he would slowly cast his net, when the prey was lured into his net, he will fiercely tear the prey.Only Li Xiao Nan could make him go crazy.Old Li gently patted him on the shoulder. He didn\u2019t dare use strength as he was afraid that he would knock people out by accident.\u201cLi Chen, if Nan Nan sees you like this, she will be sad. Do you have the heart to make her sad?\u201dLi Chen\u2019s eyelashes didn\u2019t even tremble.Old Li was angry and said: \u201cDo you want Nan Nan\u2019s sacrifice for you to be for naught? Li Chen, if you don\u2019t eat or drink and continue like this, you will die. You really will! Look at your own virtue. Nan Nan always said her father was handsomer than a star and has better temperament than a model. But what kind of temperament do you have now!\u201dLi Chen was still indifferent, his eyes fell quietly on the body in his arms, as if immersed in his own world and had difficulty to hear outside sounds.Old Li gasped for breath. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll say a few more words. If you want to be like this, you can accompany Nan Nan to death. I should have never had you! But even if you\u2019re going to die, shouldn\u2019t you avenge Nan Nan? The traitor who revealed your whereabouts has been captured. It\u2019s up to you to kill or torture him!\u201dIt seemed to entered Li Chen\u2019s ears and his dead eyes finally slightly moved.\u201cWhere?\u201d he asked, because he didn\u2019t have water for the past few days, his voice became dry and hoarse and it was a little difficult to hear.Old Li breathed a sigh of relief and quickly replied: \u201cThe traitor is now in the basement of the Li family\u2019s other villa.\u201dLi Chen moved his arms and slowly placed the body he held onto the bed. He also carefully gave her a quilt.He touched the girl\u2019s cold face, then leaned over and kissed her. He softly said in her ear, \u201cBaby, you need to sleep for a while. Dad is busy and won\u2019t take too long. Dad will come back soon. You should be good by yourself and don\u2019t run around again.\u201dOld Li looked at the gentle Li Chen and suddenly felt a sense of horror in his heart.It seems this was the first time he seen such a Li Chen, there was a devil living in Li Chen\u2019s heart. At the moment of Li Xiao Nan\u2019s death, the devil was released from Li Chen\u2019s heart. In other words, Li Chen\u2019s soul had been swallowed by the devil since long ago, the devil was asleep, but now he finally woken up\u20261Li Chen finally cheered up from his words. Instead of asking to see the traitor at once, he slowly began to eat and drink. He also cleaned himself up and returned to the former devil who was decisive except for his slightly emaciated face.After that, he went to the basement.Old Li didn\u2019t follow but could hear the screams from inside while in a daze. They were shrill and continuously flowed. After that, the bodyguards who followed Li Chen in, came out as pale as paper with extreme fear\u2026These screams lasted for seven days, except for a few bodyguards, no one else knew what happened inside.Until the eighth day, two white-faced bodyguards came out with a bulging sack. Finally, they couldn\u2019t help but vomit onto the ground.It wasn\u2019t known where the bodyguards threw the sack, but from that day forward, there were no screams from the basement.After that, Li Chen returned to normal. He didn\u2019t hold Li Xiao Nan\u2019s body again. Instead, he watched her cremation with old Li, then her urn was buried.Old Li was very pleased. This was his son. He can overcome any difficulties.But on the second day of Li Xiao Nan\u2019s burial, old Li suddenly discovered something was wrong. Li Chen, who was still in bed, didn\u2019t get up yet.Old Li called his old servant, Butler Wang, to knock on Li Chen\u2019s door, which used to be the bedroom where Li Xiao Nan and Li Chen lived together.The knocks on the door continued for a long time, and no one answered from inside.Old Li\u2019s body stumbled, and he almost couldn\u2019t stand.Butler Wang quickly helped him, shook his head, and reached out to open the door.The room was a little dark and the curtain was shut tight. The room hadn\u2019t been dark for long. Li Chen used to like the darkness, but since Li Xiao Nan entered his life, the room was kept in a state of sunshine all year round. In the early morning, Li Xiao Nan\u2019s first action was to open the curtains and let the sunshine stream into the room, and Li Chen also developed this habit under her influence.Old Li looked at the man lying quietly on the bed and quietly cried out, \u201cLi Chen?\u201dThe person on the bed didn\u2019t answer. His face was very serene, obviously sleeping. However, when Butler Wang placed his finger under the tip of his nose, he couldn\u2019t feel his breathing.Li Chen died.There were no wounds on his body and no signs of medication.No one knows how he died, as if his soul was suddenly pulled out of his body, and this body became soulless.Old Li thought he would be so sad that he would have fainted. But now, he discovered that he was calmer than what he expected.Perhaps, he had already expected such a day and was prepared.He couldn\u2019t help but reflect that whether he has ever given Li Chen fatherly love in his life. From the moment Li Chen was born, he was treated as a successor. This child had no childhood, no maternal love, and even his father wasn\u2019t competent.Therefore, when Li Xiao Nan appeared, she not only gave Li Chen familial affection, but also her simple and pure love, which naturally penetrated the softest place in Li Chen\u2019s heart.Li Xiao Nan was Li Chen\u2019s whole world.When his world collapsed, his living state was a walking corpse.It was better to die like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
