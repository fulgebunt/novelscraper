The sky was azure blue, and not a cloud was in sight. The scorching sun burned furiously like a massive fireball as it hung high in the sky.6Donghai No. 1 High School.15.30 pm.\u201cRing, ring, ring\u2026\u201d1The bell signaling the end of the lesson rang. The entire school campus woke up from its stupor, and noises appeared from everywhere.5A few seconds later, waves of students gushed out of the different classroom buildings. They smiled and chatted in their small groups while walking out of the school gates.\u201cThe weather is so hot today!\u201d someone complained angrily.1\u201cBrother Wang Teng, let\u2019s go to Wild Rose Pub for a drink tonight.\u201d3A voice pulled Wang Teng back to reality.4\u201cXu Jie!\u201dAs he looked at the person in front of him, the familiar face and the distant memories surged out from the depth of his mind. This was one of his playmates when he was in senior high.\u201cI won\u2019t be joining you tonight. I have a headache. You can have fun,\u201d said Wang Teng.Xu Jie replied hurriedly, \u201cHey, don\u2019t be like this. There aren\u2019t many people in our circle. If you don\u2019t come, it will be meaningless. Besides, we haven\u2019t gathered in a long while. Why don\u2019t we find another day to meet? How about tomorrow or the day after? What do you think?\u201dWang Teng shook his head helplessly. \u201cTomorrow is good.\u201d\u201cNo problem. I will inform Little Wei and the rest that we will be gathering tomorrow instead.\u201d Xu Jie smiled brightly.4When they walked to the school gates, a huge commotion sounded in front of them.\u201cHey, what happened in front? There\u2019s a crowd there.\u201d Xu Jie felt puzzled.\u201cLet me take a look.\u201d He then ran forward and squeezed through the crowd to get to the front.Wang Teng, on the other hand, just placed his hands in his pockets and walked forward slowly. A few students saw him and voluntarily made way for him, afraid of provoking this guy.As expected, he, Young Master Wang, had a powerful reputation!Wang Teng mocked himself silently.Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t a good reputation.He walked out of the crowd and looked at the open space in front. A lady had managed to knock down a few gangsters with dyed hair. The thugs were lying on the ground and crying in pain. They had fear in their eyes when they looked at the young lady.From the discussions around him, Wang Teng had a basic understanding of what happened.He Manrong encountered these gangsters after she ended her lessons. Finding her quite pretty, they teased her and said some nasty things to her.3They thought that He Manrong was just a weak and easily bullied lady, but unexpectedly, she was a rose with thorns.She attacked them angrily and beat them until they couldn\u2019t get up from the ground.\u201cGoddess He is indeed an advanced stage martial disciple. These gangsters offended the wrong person!\u201d4A male student beside Wang Teng was waving his fist around feverishly. Even the pimple on his face turned slightly red because of his excitement.6From his words, he treated He Manrong as his goddess.1\u201cI\u2019ve heard that He Manrong was a star student, but I didn\u2019t expect her to fight so well. Did she learn taekwondo in the past? Has she achieved the legendary 9th-degree black belt?\u201d13\u201cHonestly speaking, it\u2019s rare to see such long legs. She\u2019s only a high school student, but her figure is already so good. Imagine how she will look in the future!\u201d19Wang Teng was amazed at He Manrong\u2019s valiance. Just as he was admiring the beauties in life, he suddenly heard the words \u2018advanced stage martial disciple\u2019. The expression on his face froze.4He was in a daze!Did I hear wrong?That\u2019s right. I just got reborn, so it\u2019s normal to be a little absent-minded and mishear things.At this moment, Xu Jie leaned over and said with jealousy, \u201cWe have five advanced stage martial disciples in our school. He Manrong is the only female, and she comes from a common background to boot. She\u2019s really a genius.\u201d9\u2026Wang Teng felt speechless.They were indeed talking about advanced stage martial disciples; he didn\u2019t hear wrong.He was reborn in modern society, so why did this interesting profession exist? What was going on?Was he really reborn?3Wang Teng sensed the evil intentions of this world. His mind was filled with questions.5He Manrong frowned slightly when she noticed the number of people she had attracted. In the end, she ignored the gangsters on the ground and left right away.The people crowding around also dispersed when she left the scene.Wang Teng and Xu Jie parted ways at the school gates.Wang Teng found the car that came to fetch him from school as the other students stared at him in envy. He sat in the BMW parked at the side of the road, and it zoomed off.5In the car, Wang Teng looked at the scenery flashing past outside. He was deep in thoughts.This was when he noticed that the trees growing along the road\u2019s side were exceptionally tall, big, and lush.These plants had too many nutrients. No wonder he felt something different when he was in school just now.The plants in school were exceptionally lush too. However, Wang Teng was immersed in the fact that he was reborn, so he didn\u2019t notice it.Everything Wang Teng saw on the road astounded him.The streets were clean and neat, the pedestrians\u2019 styles seemed ahead of time, and the country\u2019s economy was extremely prosperous.It didn\u2019t feel like 2009. It didn\u2019t feel like 2019 either, the year he was reborn.7As expected, there was something different about this world!Wang Teng\u2019s mind was in a mess. He saw a pretty lady around 20 years old walking on the streets with a huge and fluffy dog on the leash.There was nothing wrong with this scene, but the dog was just too huge. It was as big as a calf.3Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but curse, \u201cWhat the f**k! What breed is this? Why is it so big?\u201dHe took a deep breath to calm his emotions. But then, he was dumbfounded again as he touched his chin.\u201cIt looks like a golden retriever, but it\u2019s too big.\u201d1He noticed a few more people walking their pets, and all of them were huge. Their sizes exceeded the typical dimensions of the animals. Some parents even let their children ride on the backs of the big dogs.The pet dogs became mounts!He also saw some pet cats with two tails. They were gigantic, too, looking like leopards.However, they were very obedient. Judging from the unsurprised reactions of the passers-by, they weren\u2019t treated like wild beasts.Wang Teng felt a little numb.This was definitely not his original world. Even though his classmates and school remained the same, some things were obviously different.The car drove for more than 20 minutes before arriving at the luxurious villa district.Fortunately, his home was still here.He came from a normal wealthy family.6Wang Teng\u2019s grandfather had four children. His father, Wang Shengguo, was the second child. He was a business talent, so he started his own business and built the Xinteng Group. This corporation was second to the corporation Wang Teng\u2019s grandfather founded, which was the Rongsheng Group.1The Xinteng Group and the Rongsheng Group were both big businesses worth over a hundred million.4But, Wang Teng knew that there were many corporations like this in the world. His family might be considered wealthy in this area, but in front of the real global financial institutions, they were just tiny ants.4In his past life, the Wang family had offended someone, resulting in the downfall of their business. They only managed to persevere for a few months before their company went bankrupt and closed.2The Wang family collapsed and became a thing of the past.It sounded good to have two companies each worth more than a hundred million. Yet, they were nothing in front of the really influential people.How ironic!Since then, Wang Teng\u2019s life took a huge turn. In the next few days, he basically lived a dog\u2019s life. He got humiliated and embarrassed all the time until he was reborn\u2014wait, he might not be reborn!This world had changed drastically, so he didn\u2019t know what the Wang family was like now.He wondered if his parents were still his parents?He hoped that when he opened the door, his parents wouldn\u2019t have changed.No way! It won\u2019t happen!\u00a0Wang Teng comforted himself hurriedly. He felt agitated, so he took a few deep breaths before he stepped through the doors of the villa.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn 2009, the villas in this expensive district cost 200,000rmb per square meter.1Wang Teng\u2019s family villa was 800 square meters big, and they had paid more than 10 million for it. Including the price of renovation, they spent more than 20 million in total.4Upon entering the villa, the first thing visible was the spacious living room. At the moment, two maids were cleaning the place.Mother Wang, Li Xiumei, was cooking in the kitchen.Li Xiumei was born in a scholarly family. In university, she was famous because of her talent. However, she wasn\u2019t someone who couldn\u2019t step into the kitchen.Rather, she was a master at cooking. Wang Teng and his father were full of praises for her.That was why Li Xiumei always cooked personally. She would make the dishes every day and wait for her husband and son to come back to eat.1Looking at the hustling figure in the kitchen, Wang Teng could smell the familiar fragrance of the food from here.He stood at the door of the kitchen and opened his mouth several times. After a long while, he finally managed to make a sound.\u201cMom, I\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re back!\u201dLi Xiumei turned around and smiled as she continued, \u201cLet\u2019s wait for a while. Your dad should be back soon too. We can eat together after he returns.\u201d\u201cOkay! Let me wash my face.\u201d Wang Teng rushed up the stairs instantly and dashed into the bathroom.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this child today?\u201d Li Xiumei shook her head.In the bathroom, Wang Teng turned the tap and splashed cold water on his face.He came back!He never thought that he would still have the chance to return to this family after ten years.In the past, when the Wang family went downhill, someone conspired against Wang Shengguo and had him murdered. Some time later, Li Xiumei also died of grief.14Wang Teng raised his head and wiped his face. He stared at his reflection in the mirror with slightly red eyes.Many things had changed in the past ten years.Wang Teng changed. He was no longer who he was before. Now, he was able to remain calm and composed when facing different people and matters.But, in the corner of his heart, there were still a few soft spots that he didn\u2019t want to touch.Since he was reborn, his heart turned warm again.Wang Teng dried his face and walked out of the bathroom. He then located his bedroom with the help of his memory.The similar arrangements, everything was so familiar.NBA stars posters were pasted on the wall, and there were piles of audio CDs and novels on the bookshelf. The study table was below the window while the bed was next to it. There was a computer on the table.It was a new model of Apple. The bright silver frame was light and trendy.7This was another item that didn\u2019t fit the timeline.Wang Teng suddenly thought of something when he saw the computer. As expected, he found a cell phone in his bag. However, it wasn\u2019t an antique from 2009; it was the latest iPhone 8.He was mentally prepared, though. He entered the passcode and opened his cell phone.Wang Teng felt fortunate that he wasn\u2019t good at remembering passwords. He had used the same password for many years without changing it, which became useful now.4Food delivery apps, WeChat, Douyin\u2026 many apps in his phone belonged to the future. They didn\u2019t exist in 2009.2When he was reborn, he wanted to use his memories to create a bright future for himself. He would conquer the hearts of future bosses like Jack Ma.10Fine, he had no chance now!He sighed and put down his phone. Wang Teng then turned on his computer.There was no fastest method than searching online.Since the computer and cell phone technology was so advanced, it would be unreasonable for the internet to be stuck in 2009.Technology and the Internet were inseparable.Wang Teng was a little surprised after he turned his computer on.The operating system wasn\u2019t Windows 10. Instead, it was already the 11th generation.14So far, the advancement timeline here wasn\u2019t the same as in 2019. There were some differences here and there.He had to spend some time before he got familiar with this world.Wang Teng opened the Baidu browser and searched the two words \u2018martial warriors\u2019. A huge amount of information sprung up.1More than an hour later, Wang Teng closed the browser and leaned back on his chair. He was in disbelief.\u201930 years ago, multiple dimensional rifts appeared in the world. The rifts are linked to an alternate world, Xingwu Continent.\u2018Force exists in the Xingwu Continent. Everyone there can become martial warriors by using this Force to cultivate.9\u2018Martial warriors are formidable!\u2018Low-rank martial warriors can break metals, split rocks, and divide a stream of water into two using their blades. High-rank martial warriors can move and destroy mountains, cut the sea into two\u2026 \u20187This is like a fantasy!Wang Teng was speechless.The scientist on Earth had done some research on the Force and discovered that it might be dark matter. But, why were the humans and plants on Xingwu Continent able to absorb the dark matter to change their body structure? Why weren\u2019t the living creatures on Earth able to do the same? The scientist couldn\u2019t find the answer to these questions.12After some time, along with the appearance of the dimensional rifts, the Earth started to change. The living creatures on Earth were affected by dark matter.The plants became taller and lusher, and some extinct species reappeared on Earth.6Animals started to grow in size too. The special characteristics on their bodies, for instance, scales, claws, and teeth, were enhanced accordingly.Some gifted creatures even managed to mutate and obtained special element ability.As the masters of the Earth, humans also followed suit.Their bodies became stronger. They were able to run faster, jump higher, have more strength, and live longer!3The elderlies who were around 70 to 80 years old 30 years ago were still alive. Despite being more than a hundred years old now, their physical and mental state remained the same as 30 years ago.Humans went berserk!The different countries disregarded their previous enmity and organized a global conference.22In the end, they decided to organize a team to investigate and explore the dimensional rifts. After confirming that they were safe, they sent the army and different specialists into the Xingwu Continent.These people were known as the pioneers.Xingwu Continent was endless. The pioneers claimed that they came from the other side of the sea and gained the locals\u2019 trust. Afterward, they started interacting and trading with them.The people on earth didn\u2019t ruthlessly invade the Xingwu Continent. Instead, they adopted the principles of peaceful coexistence and interacted with the locals there amiably.28After some time, the pioneers came back with the cultivation methods from Xingwu Continent.After some trials and errors, humans on Earth were able to cultivate. The countries came to a common consensus and made the cultivation methods public. Henceforth, it was the dawn of a new martial arts era.12This was a huge reform!1History took a sharp turn and moved in an unpredictable direction.We have come to the most important part. Please do take note.7Humans were powerful because they had intelligence. Through cultivation, the human race quickly grew stronger. Within a few short years, a considerable number of martial warriors started to appear around the world.7Some joined the army, while others entered the government. Some belonged to various financial institutions and elite families. All in all, these people formed an alliance. However, a small portion of the civilian martial warriors preferred freedom. They set up various martial arts schools to provide a way for other civilians to start their cultivation.1Due to the presence of these martial warriors, humans were able to keep the mutated and powerful wild beasts out of the city. This prevented massive damage and impact on society.However, becoming a martial warrior required talent. It wasn\u2019t a path everyone could pursue.If someone wanted to become an official martial warrior, they needed to toughen their body and build a solid foundation.Cultivators at this stage were known as martial disciples. They would only be able to absorb the Force and store it in their body if their foundation was strong enough. Then, they would become an official martial warrior.If Force was compared to water, the body would be akin to a vessel collecting the water. The process of absorbing the Force was the same as pouring water into a vessel. The bigger and sturdier the vessel was, the more water it could hold.6The principle of cultivation could be explained simply like this.Based on the martial disciples\u2019 strength, speed, and overall ability, they could be classified into three categories: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.1He Manrong was an advanced stage martial disciple. She was only a step away from becoming a martial warrior.This was the step that stumped many people.There was a stark difference between people who could absorb the Force and those who couldn\u2019t.An official martial warrior who was able to cultivate using the Force was able to easily tackle ten advanced stage martial disciples who couldn\u2019t absorb the Force.2On the surface, though, only one step separated an advanced stage martial disciple and an official martial warrior.As the saying goes, the poor study while the wealthy learn martial arts. Copious amounts of resources were required to cultivate the martial path. Naturally, they cost money, so ordinary people were at a disadvantage.On the whole, martial warriors only made up a small proportion of humans. Most people were just slightly stronger human beings.But, this didn\u2019t stop martial warriors from becoming the mainstream. On the other hand, the rarity of martial warriors and their importance gave them their important status.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 3": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay7 pm.Wang Teng\u2019s family finally sat down together to have their dinner.\u201cYour father was halfway home when something cropped up at work again. He had to go back, so he was delayed by more than an hour. Can\u2019t you go back after you finish your dinner?\u201d Li Xiumei complained as she placed some food in Wang Teng\u2019s bowl.Wang Teng was holed up in his room for more than an hour. He also forgot about his dinner, but fortunately, his father was late because of work.\u201cIt was an emergency. I had to go back and take care of it first,\u201d Wang Shengguo replied helplessly.\u201cLet\u2019s ignore your father. His mind is always fixed on his stupid company.\u201d Li Xiumei rolled her eyes at Wang Shengguo.Wang Teng smiled.When he was in high school, his relationship with his father was a little tense. Wang Shengguo had great hope for his child, so naturally, he was strict. However, Wang Teng was in his rebellious phase, and he didn\u2019t study well. Thus, the conflict between him and his father got more intense.7Thinking back on it, Wang Teng felt that his actions were really childish in the past.5On the dining table, Wang Teng and Wang Shengguo were quieter as compared to Li Xiumei. She placed food in Wang Teng\u2019s bowl and chatted with the father and son.Wang Teng enjoyed this atmosphere.Wang Shengguo had a short conversation with Wang Teng. He was mostly concerned with his studies.Wang Teng\u2019s replies were quite standard. He wasn\u2019t as childish as before, and he didn\u2019t throw tantrums or smash his chopsticks.Wang Shengguo was pleasantly surprised. He felt that his son was different today, but he didn\u2019t overthink. After finishing his dinner, Wang Shengguo left the house in a hurry.As the boss of a huge company, he had many things to settle every day. Most of the time, he could only sleep for four to five hours daily.11Wang Teng informed his mother before leaving the house too. He rushed straight to the Jixin Martial House.A yellow sports car zoomed along the streets in the night, its loud engine catching the attention of many passers-by. Most of the cars today used the Force as their source of energy. Fuel had long been eliminated. The Force was more environmentally friendly and cheaper.10The pioneers didn\u2019t just bring back the methods of cultivation from the Xingwu Continent. They also brought back many new technologies.The Force rune was one of them.By combining the technologies from the Xingwu Continent and the Earth, the Force technology was born. From then, cars started to use the Force. Later on, computers and phones also shifted to the newly invented Force runes chip and batteries. They worked faster and could last longer\u20261Half an hour later, Wang Teng parked the car outside the martial arts school.Based on the information he found, Jixin Martial House was one of China\u2019s top three martial arts academies. The principal of this school was a 12-star general-rank martial warrior. He was ranked among the top 5 warriors in China.7Worldwide, he was ranked among the top 20.There were different ranks for martial warriors: 1-star to 9-star were soldiers, 10-star was brigadier general, 11-star was low-tier general, 12-star was general, 13-star was high-tier general\u20265From this, one could tell how powerful the principle of the Jixin Martial House was.2The headquarters of the Jixin Martial House was in Capital Xia, with its branches spreading over the big cities in China. They had a lot of martial warriors in their employment and had given birth to many powerful people.The Donghai branch of the Jixin Martial House was situated beside the sea. In the dark, it looked like a huge wild beast lying prone. The landmass it covered was comparable to a high school.The martial arts academy\u2019s main gate was wide enough for five cars to drive through side by side. It was grandeur and magnificent to say the least.There was a huge rock erected in the middle of the main gate. The words \u2018Jixin Martial House, Donghai branch\u2019 were written conspicuously in gold.1When he reached the sentry box, a few guards carrying guns walked to his car.\u201cRoutine inspection, please cooperate.\u201dWang Teng lowered his car window and nodded. Then, he got out of his car.The guards inspected the interior of the car and used the scanner to check Wang Teng\u2019s body. The whole process was done very carefully.3At the same time, Wang Teng also sized up the guards.They wore black protective vests and had large-caliber machine guns in their hands. Just their menacing looks and sophisticated gear was enough to frighten the onlookers.1There were Force runes carved on the machine guns, signifying that they were Force machine guns. They were ten times more powerful than their normal counterparts. Even if an official martial warrior got hit by them, he would be crippled.9After the inspection, the guards let him in.Wang Teng parked the car properly and walked along the paths in the martial arts academy.It was already past 8 pm, but the place was brightly lit. Plenty of students could be seen on the roads and the grasses.There was no lack of people training at night.Every second counted when you were training to become a martial warrior. Being talented was the basic criteria. One still needed to work hard to achieve progress on his cultivation journey.1There were three tall and huge buildings in the martial arts academy. With their silver-white color with distinctive characteristics, it was easy to spot them.The one in the middle was the administrative building. It was rectangular in shape and a hundred meters in height. It stabbed straight into the clouds like a spear. At the tip, there was a strange half circle.2On the left was the martial disciple teaching building, while the right one was the martial disciple training building.1These two buildings looked like two huge round balls. They weren\u2019t tall, though, only having three floors, but they were extremely spacious. By rough estimate, they were two times bigger than Donghai No. 1 High School\u2019s stadium.4The placements of these three buildings made Wang Teng suspect that this was the work of the principal\u2019s poor sense of humor.9Wang Teng had done his homework, so he ran towards the administrative building without hesitation.Under the staff\u2019s guidance, he registered himself as a martial disciple and went to the martial disciple teaching building.The martial arts academy would only accept students between the age of 16 and 30. This was to prevent wastage of resources.Wang Teng was merely 17 years old, so age wasn\u2019t a problem for him.The noise in the teaching building struck him the second he walked into the building.The first floor was where beginner disciples trained. Beginner disciples were beginner stage martial disciples, and there were more than 3000 beginner stage martial disciples in the Jixin Martial House.On the first floor, all the students were cultivating on their own. It looked extremely lively.The second Wang Teng entered the main lobby, he froze on the spot.What did he see?Around 50 transparent bubbles were floating above the ground.4Strength*1Speed*3Physique*1Enlightenment*0.52Strength*2\u2026Wang Teng blinked. He blinked again. The bubbles were still there, but the other students in the lobby couldn\u2019t see them.This was his special skill?!He wasn\u2019t sure, so he pulled a student that was walking past.\u201cWhat do you want!\u201dThe student was around 17 years old. He glanced at Wang Teng irritatedly with a \u2018why are you more handsome than me\u2019 expression.3\u201cBrother, your floor\u2026 it\u2019s paved really nicely,\u201d Wang Teng pointed to the floor and said.1The transparent bubbles were floating at the height of his calves. He could see them just by lowering his head.The student ignored the bubbles and replied impatiently, \u201cOf course. This is the best rubber flooring. There are Force runes carved in it that can minimize vibration, last longer, and have many other functions.\u201cWhere do you come from? Don\u2019t you have common sense?\u201dThe student flicked his hand and walked away without looking back.Wang Teng touched his chin. From the person\u2019s reaction, he obviously couldn\u2019t see the bubbles. That meant that he was the only person who could see them.1The students walked around the training area, some going through the bubbles. To them, the bubbles didn\u2019t exist.Wang Teng moved closer to the bubble nearest to him to test if he could walk through it.The instant he touched it, the bubble disappeared.His vision blurred for a moment, and a transparent board popped out.Enlightenment: 184Physique: 41Strength: 50 (+1)Speed: 32\u2026Wang Teng\u2019s heart palpitated as he stared at the transparent board. He felt as though his heart was going to jump out of his throat.This was exhilarating.Wang Teng felt that he wouldn\u2019t be so excited even if he struck a hundred million lottery.He couldn\u2019t control himself.1This must be a bug!12In this era where martial warriors were the mainstream, becoming stronger was the only path to success.His bug allowed him to collect attributes from other people and turn them into his own. This was heaven-defying!Other people had to cultivate diligently while he only had to pick up attributes. Wang Teng saw an unobstructed path to success in front of him.1One day, he would go straight to the top of the world!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt first, Wang Teng had come to the Jixin Martial House to cultivate. But now, he was busy picking up attributes.He felt like a rubbish collector, working hard to pick up what others dropped.2He observed the bubbles for some time and noticed that the transparent bubbles on the ground were dropped during the disciples\u2019 cultivation process.Many students were practicing in the martial arts academy, so quite a few attribute bubbles had dropped.One thing made Wang Teng\u2019s heart ache, though.There was a time limit for the existence of the bubbles. They would disappear after a few minutes.Just now, when he was in a daze, a few bubbles had already disappeared. He felt a pang of pain in his heart, as if he had lost a few hundred million.The disciples continued practicing; attribute bubbles kept dropping.As Wang Teng collected the bubbles happily, his attributes started surging.When an instructor saw him running around the arena aimlessly, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He called him loudly.\u201cHey, student, why are you not practicing diligently? Why are you running around?\u201d1\u201cTeacher, this is my first day, so I\u2019m looking at how other people practice. As the saying goes, there\u2019s something you can learn from everyone. I\u2019m learning things from other people first.\u201dWang Teng looked at the instructor and smiled as he spouted nonsense.\u201cToday is your first day? Come over here. I will teach you the ninth set of radio exercises first. Since you don\u2019t know anything now, you won\u2019t be able to understand what they are doing. Lay your foundations first,\u201d said the instructor.2Wang Teng thought for a moment and felt that the instructor made sense. This guy was quite responsible.He looked at the attribute bubbles that had just dropped in the training lobby. The feeling of losing a few hundred millions struck him again.\u201cTeacher, what kind of exercise is the ninth set of radio exercises?\u201d Wang Teng walked over and asked curiously.\u201cIt is a set of exercises created by the country to train your body scientifically. It uses the basic physical training exercises from the Xingwu Continent.\u201dThe instructor turned to the sound system after he finished speaking.\u201cThe ninth set of radio exercises, Martial Spirit, starts now.\u201dWang Teng froze.He could recognize the music. The starting actions were familiar too.\u201cWatch carefully.\u201dThe instructor was taller than 1.8m, and his muscles were bulging out of his shirt. It was frightening, yet he was getting ready diligently.2Wang Teng was stunned.The instructor started doing the exercises along with the music.\u201cThe first stance, stretching exercise. One two three four, two two three four\u2026\u201d\u201cThe second stance, chest expansion exercise. One two three four, two two three four\u2026\u201d\u201cThe third stance, kicking exercise. One two three four, two two three four\u2026\u201dWang Teng looked at the instructor in astonishment as many crows flew past his mind uncontrollably. He was speechless.1Oh my god!The names of the exercises were the same as the radio exercises he knew in the past, but the actions were more complicated. Some of them even had high physical demands.It seemed like\u2026 the exercises could truly train one\u2019s physique.But, this music, this tempo, and this familiar feeling were really embarrassing.3\u201cHow is it? Have you seen everything? If you didn\u2019t, I could show you again.\u201dThe music stopped, and the instructor slowly ended the exercise. He let out a long sigh. Beads of sweat appeared on his forehead and his body. The effects of the ninth set of radio exercises were astounding.\u201cInstructor, I saw everything clearly!\u201d Wang Teng nodded in a hurry. He was really afraid that the instructor would do it again.Looking at his unsatisfied expression, the guy might really do it again. He wasn\u2019t kidding.\u201cOh, it looks like your memory is not bad. I had to watch it three times before I managed to memorize it,\u201d the instructor said with disappointment.Why do you look so disappointed!How can you get addicted to a radio exercise?Wang Teng sent the instructor off with all his might by persuading him to harm other students. After all, they would be delighted to listen to him.I will never practice the ninth set of radio exercises! I will never do it even if I die!I will only rely on picking up attributes to become stronger!6When the instructor wasn\u2019t looking at him, Wang Teng continued his collection business.Strength*2Speed*1Enlightenment*0.2\u2026Basic Fist Skill*5\u2026Wang Teng was thrilled. He had picked many strength and speed attributes, but he hadn\u2019t tested them. Hence, he didn\u2019t know where his strength was at. However, while running around, Wang Teng felt his speed increasing. He accidentally dashed a few meters further than expected.There weren\u2019t many Enlightenment attributes. Most of them were less than one point, so they only added up to one point.Will I become smarter if my Enlightenment attribute increases? Why don\u2019t I feel anything?\u00a0Wang Teng thought to himself.Wait!Basic Fist Skill*5?!Wang Teng had absorbed an attribute bubble that he never saw before. Suddenly, memories of him practicing fist skills, which didn\u2019t exist earlier, appeared in his mind.\u201cI\u2019ve learned the basic fist skill?\u201d Wang Teng was in disbelief.As martial disciples couldn\u2019t absorb the Force, they weren\u2019t able to practice Force battle techniques.Hence, the country summarized many basic fighting skills, including footwork, fist skills, sword skills, blade skills, etc.They popularized the skills and allowed everyone to practice them.Wang Teng looked at the 20-years-old youth who was practicing the basic fist skill not far away from him, and his eyes lit up.Although he had learned the basic fist skill, he wasn\u2019t well-versed in it. He just knew it roughly like an ordinary person who had practiced it for five days.Was he able to increase his proficiency if he collected more basic fist skill attributes?Bang, bang, bang!The young man punched the sandbag forcefully, swinging it right and left. Every punch formed a dent in the sandbag.\u201cAmazing!\u201cIndeed, you can only be successful if you become a martial warrior.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t it dropping\u2026? Hey, it dropped! It dropped again!\u201d1Wang Teng was feeling over the top. He secretly crept in from the back and picked up the attribute silently. Then, he sneaked away.2Basic Fist Skill*7Strength*5\u201cThis young man is amazing! He\u2019s good!\u201d Wang Teng exclaimed.The proficiency of his basic fist skill had increased once more!He waited for a while, but the other party didn\u2019t drop any more attribute bubbles. Wang Teng had no choice but to turn his attention to the other students. He mustn\u2019t neglect the other attributes while waiting for this one.Only children made decisions.Adults took everything!8He, Wang Teng, was an adult!\u2026Basic Footwork*2There was a running track outside the training lobby. It was like a stadium.A fat man was dashing across the track like a gust of wind. Standing by the side, Wang Teng\u2019s hair flew up. Still, a bubble dropped from the fat man.This was an agile fatty!2\u201cHuh? Basic footwork!\u201dWang Teng was astounded when he picked up the attribute bubble. This was another basic technique. He was really lucky today.As the fat man kept running assiduously, bubbles dropped behind him like a hen laying eggs.\u201cSo many bubbles!\u201dWang Teng was flabbergasted. He didn\u2019t want to waste anything, so he ran behind the fatty and collected the bubbles.1The speed attributes he had collected earlier started showing its effects now. Wang Teng was able to follow behind the fatty without breaking a sweat.Speed*1Speed*1Speed*1Basic Footwork*3Speed*1\u2026\u201cHah, hah, hah\u2026 why are you following me?\u201d The fatty stopped and glared at Wang Teng while sticking out his tongue.\u201cNo one is following you. I\u2019m just practicing my footwork. Don\u2019t flatter yourself.\u201d Wang Teng glared back at him.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about me?\u201d\u201cDamn it, I\u2019m not running anymore. You can run alone.\u201d The fatty was frustrated, but he couldn\u2019t do anything to Wang Teng.\u201cHey, don\u2019t do that. You can run a few more rounds. I think that you have a bright future. Don\u2019t give up easily,\u201d Wang Teng immediately persuaded the fatty with all his heart.1The fatty: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The night was getting dark.1Wang Teng left the Jixin Martial House unwillingly. The other students had trained for the entire night, but he fooled around the whole time.Fooled around?Pfft\u2026 how could he say that he was fooling around when it was about martial warriors?The martial disciples left in batches, and Wang Teng was among the last batch.It wasn\u2019t because he was very hardworking. He just didn\u2019t want to miss any attribute bubble. Well\u2026 this was a kind of hard work too.1Wang Teng drove on the empty road.Enlightenment: 19.3Physique: 47Strength:1359Speed: 86Battle Techniques: Basic Fist Skill (basic understanding), Basic Footwork (basic understanding)Glancing at the attributes panel, Wang Teng felt content. From single-digit to the current double-digits and three-digits, it was an undeniably huge change.His strength and speed had increased the most. On the other hand, his enlightenment and physique were on the low side.It wasn\u2019t hard to notice that each attribute had a different probability of dropping.The greatest surprise today was the basic fist skill and the basic footwork. To become a martial warrior, having a tough body wasn\u2019t enough. He needed to learn battle techniques so that he could display his true potential.I will go to the martial arts academy again tomorrow to test how far I can go.\u00a0Wang Teng thought to himself.When he returned home, Li Xiumei had already prepared dinner.2Wang Shengguo was eating. He frowned and asked, \u201cIt\u2019s late. Where did you go?\u201d\u201cThe Jixin Martial House,\u201d Wang Teng replied casually.Then, he said to Li Xiumei, \u201cMom, did you make egg noodles? Did you leave some for me? I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\u201cOf course, I left some for you.\u201dLi Xiumei was elated that her son loved her cooking.Slurp~Wang Teng took the bowl and sat down beside Wang Shengguo, taking huge bites of the noodles. It was incredibly delicious.Not smelling alcohol on Wang Teng\u2019s body, Wang Shengguo\u2019s eyebrows relaxed a little. He asked with surprise, \u201cWhy did you go to the martial arts academy?\u201d\u201cTo practice martial arts,\u201d Wang Teng replied without raising his head.\u201cPractice martial arts!\u201d1\u201cPractice martial arts!\u201dWang Shengguo and Li Xiumei were flabbergasted. They exchanged glances with each other before turning to look at Wang Teng in unplanned unison.They had tried persuading Wang Teng in the past, but he was too pampered. He didn\u2019t want to learn, so he didn\u2019t take their words to heart.Yet, he voluntarily went to practice martial arts today?2\u201cSon, you want to practice martial arts?\u201d Li Xiumei asked in disbelief.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Wang Teng nodded.\u201cSon, are you dating?\u201d Li Xiumei followed up curiously.\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Teng was stunned.When did he start dating? He didn\u2019t even know that he was dating.\u201cYou hated practicing martial arts in the past,\u201d said Wang Shengguo.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? I\u2019ve sorted out my thoughts, so naturally, I want to start practicing,\u201d Wang Teng gave a relaxed expression as he replied.Was it really so simple?Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei glanced at each other again.\u201cAlright, since you want to learn martial arts, I will hire the best teacher to teach you.\u201d Wang Shengguo could sense that Wang Teng wasn\u2019t joking, so he clapped his hands happily.\u201cDad, you don\u2019t have to do that. Martial arts require talent. I want to practice on my own and give it a try.\u201dWang Teng directly rejected his father. How could a teacher be compared to his bug?His father was only able to hire an advanced stage martial disciple as his teacher. Based on his family background, they couldn\u2019t hire a martial warrior.1He would rather spend time picking up attributes than learning from an advanced stage martial disciple.It would be a waste of money and resources.This was the martial era. Even hiring an advanced stage martial disciple wasn\u2019t cheap.Wang Shengguo didn\u2019t force his son. He nodded and said, \u201cOkay, there are instructors in the martial arts academy too. As one of the top three martial arts academies in China, their instructors won\u2019t be bad.\u201cPractice properly. I don\u2019t hope that you can become a martial warrior. If you\u2019re able to become an advanced stage martial disciple, your physical quality will improve tremendously, and your lifespan will increase too.\u201cHealth is wealth. With a good body, you can get twice the result with half the effort.\u201d1Actually, he was afraid that Wang Teng\u2019s passion wouldn\u2019t last long. He might give up after two days of suffering. Thus, it was better to let him practice on his own for a period. If he could persevere, they could make more plans later.1\u201cI understand.\u201d Wang Teng smiled secretly. His father loved to educate him. In the past, he wouldn\u2019t listen to his father.But.An advanced stage martial disciple?He had a bug. Not mentioning an official martial warrior, he might even be able to become a general-stage martial warrior.3He was just afraid that he would scare his father if he told him the truth.3On the other side, Wang Shengguo felt content in his heart. He thought that Wang Shengguo had matured\u2026 Was he dating?4\u201cSon, you\u2019re already 17 years old. If you are really dating, we won\u2019t object. Do you have enough pocket money?\u201dWang Teng was puzzled.Why couldn\u2019t they stop talking about this topic?\u201cDad, Mom, I\u2019m really not dating. If I have a girlfriend, I\u2019ll tell you immediately.\u201d Wang Teng was speechless.1\u201cWhat a pity.\u201d Li Xiumei felt disappointed.Wang Shengguo nodded in agreement.Wang Teng said helplessly, \u201cMom, I\u2019m only 17 years old. Why are you sighing?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not young anymore. We are allowed to get the marriage certificate at 18 years old. If you start dating now, you can cultivate your relationship for a year and get married after that,\u201d Li Xiumei said.4\u201cGet married at 18 years old?\u201d Wang Teng was dumbstruck.Was the martial arts era so loving?\u201cMom, I\u2019ve finished eating. I will wash up and go to sleep.\u201dHe dashed upstairs as though he was running away from his parents. He was afraid that if he talked to his mother for a while longer, she might start talking about his future children.This was how his mother was like.\u201cThis child! Hubby, I feel that the young miss of the Tang family is not bad. Let\u2019s visit her family another day and ask them\u2026\u201dLi Xiumei was still chatting with Wang Shengguo on the first floor.Fortunately, Wang Teng didn\u2019t hear them. If he did, he might have peed in his pants out of shock. The young miss of the Tang family was at least a hundred kilograms!41\u2026The next day.Wang Shengguo was eating breakfast bright and early in the morning. Steamed buns, fried dough, soy milk\u2026 these were all simple dishes, but they were the favorites of the people in China.Wang Teng came downstairs.It was Saturday, so he didn\u2019t need to go to school. He could make his own arrangements.After he finished breakfast, Wang Teng bid farewell to his parents and rushed out of the door.Wang Shengguo felt relieved again. He said to Li Xiumei, \u201cBuy some star beast meat. Little Teng is practicing martial arts. Eating some star beast meat can help him improve his physique.\u201dJixin Martial House.Wang Teng came really early. There were only a few students in the training lobby at the moment. Clearly, these people were remarkably hardworking.As early risers, they were all surprised to see a new face.However, Wang Teng\u2019s diligence earned their approval as the students nodded at him politely. They felt that he was the same kind of person as them.Wang Teng found himself very hardworking, too, but unfortunately, not many people came to practice so early. Hence, there were few bubbles to pick today.He went to greet the students and picked up the attributes along the way.Yes, he just did it because it was along the way.I, Wang Teng, am a polite person. My main purpose is to greet them.Basic Fist Skill*6Strength*4Speed*3Basic Sword Skill*4\u2026Wow, there was an array of attributes. There were also basic fist skills and basic sword skills for him to pick up. He had learned another basic battle technique!As expected, the early bird catches the worm.The disciples were all talented, and they were very polite. Even more, they dropped many attributes for him.Wang Teng really liked them.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWang Teng soon finished picking up the attribute bubbles. He knew that the other students wouldn\u2019t drop any more bubbles for some time, so he ran to a corner.There were a few inspection devices placed over there: strength inspection device, speed indicator device, and physique inspection device.This was all equipment used to test the physical conditions of the martial disciples. They were more accurate with minimal error.Wang Teng stopped in front of the strength inspection device first.He had learned the basic fist skill, so he knew how to exert his strength properly.Other people would need at least a month to learn this. Even a genius would need around ten days. Yet, Wang Teng only used a month.16To him, it was only a few attribute bubbles!This was the shortest time to learn the skill in the world. It was so short that other people didn\u2019t even dare to imagine it.Wang Teng slowly got into posture and took a deep breath. He then closed his eyes, relaxing his body.Suddenly, he opened his eyes wide. He fixed his gaze in front of him, as though he was looking at his prey. Then, he moved. He stepped firmly on the ground and slightly moved his waist. His backbone tightened like a bow as he attacked with his fist.\u201cBang!\u201dWang Teng\u2019s fists slammed the strength inspection device. The number on display started jumping violently before it finally stopped. It was 143 kg!9Yesterday, when he went home at night, his strength attribute was at 135 points. Just now, he had picked up 8 points, coming to a total of 143 points. This was the same as the number on the device.His strength had reached the limit of a normal person.7It was worth noting that it was a normal person\u2019s limit.A human in a desperate situation was able to go beyond his limits. However, it was hard for an ordinary person to do that. In fact, it was exceedingly difficult.1Thinking back, his initial strength was at 50, which was the strength of a normal person.9Fortunately, I\u2019m not incompetent!4Wang Teng consoled himself. Then, he went to the speed indicator and stood on it.The speed indicator looked like a running machine. When a person ran on it, the wheels below would start spinning, and the person\u2019s speed would be calculated.Wang Teng started with a light jog. Then, he increased his speed until he hit his peak.The speed indicator device would display the runner\u2019s fastest speed.Wang Teng felt that he had already reached his limit, so he slowed down gradually and stepped down from the device.He looked at the number on the indicator: 12.7m/s!1It was obvious that the speed and the attribute points didn\u2019t rise equally. Wang Teng wasn\u2019t interested in how these two aspects were connected, though.It was just a different formula.Nonetheless, Wang Teng was still astounded by his own speed just now.This was the speed of the Olympics hundred-meter sprint champion, right? If the body of a martial disciple was already like this, how scary was a martial warrior?\u201cLet\u2019s look at my physique.\u201dThe physique inspection device looked like a hibernation chamber in a fantasy movie. It stood erected in a corner.Wang Teng walked in and pressed the start button. A ray of light scanned his body from his head to toe a few times.The physique inspection consisted of an examination of the blood, muscles, bones, meridians, and other elements. It was extremely complex, requiring advanced technology.\u201cDing! The scan has ended. Student Wang Teng. Physique 47.\u201dA pleasant female voice resounded from the physique inspection device.\u201cTsk, tsk, there is even a voice broadcast system.\u201dWang Teng was amazed at how high-quality the speed indicator device and physique inspection device were.He wondered to himself.\u00a0My physique is 47, the same as my physique attribute points. It seems like only the speed attribute is different.He glanced at the \u2018Levels of martial disciple chart\u2019 hung on the wall at the side.The standard strength of a beginner stage martial disciple was 100 kg to 300 kg. The speed was 9 to 7 seconds for a hundred meters, meaning 11.11m/s to 14.28m/s. Lastly, the physique was between 30 to 50.As evident, Wang Teng was already a beginner stage martial disciple.He was satisfied with this result.Why shouldn\u2019t he be satisfied? Did he think that he could rise to the top in a single day?He had already saved much time in upgrading from a normal human to a beginner stage martial disciple.One needed to learn to be content\u2026\u201cI will aim to become an intermediate stage martial disciple today!\u201d Wang Teng was filled with excitement as he decided to stay in the training lobby the entire day. He wasn\u2019t going anywhere.The other students were all practicing on their own, concentrating on their training. They didn\u2019t notice Wang Teng\u2019s test result. After all, this was the first time they had met. It was impolite to peek at others\u2019 abilities.While Wang Teng was doing his test just now, a few more attribute bubbles had dropped beside the students.Wang Teng\u2019s eyes lit up. He pretended to walk past them unintentionally and picked up the attributes.Basic Sword Skill*3Strength*5Enlightenment*0.6Speed*2\u2026Not bad, not bad. There\u2019s enlightenment to collect, and I\u2019ve almost completed my basic sword skill!\u00a0Wang Teng was secretly jumping with joy.Since there were too few people at the moment, Wang Teng didn\u2019t want to be too conspicuous and garner everyone\u2019s attention. He walked into the weapons room and looked around.There were many weapons on the shelves, including swords, blades, spears, halberd, rods, hammers, and many more.1Each weapon had its subcategories too. For instance, for swords, there were long swords, short swords, soft swords, double swords, and such.There were all kinds of weapons on display here, and one could find whatever they fancied. No matter how unpopular the students\u2019 weapon was, they would find it in the weapons room.Wang Teng stood in front of the shelf with the swords and observed for some time. Eventually, he selected a black soft sword from the \u2018dark shadow\u2019 series.3As martial arts became mainstream, the weapons industry started developing too. After all, weapons were extremely important to a martial warrior.In a duel, a martial warrior with a powerful weapon had an advantage over a martial warrior without any weapons.However, the weapons provided to the martial disciples were all dummies. The quality was barely satisfactory, and no runes were engraved on it.This metal sword from the \u2018dark shadow\u2019 series was entirely black. Its pattern and weight were the same as the real sword, but there were no occult runes on it.1If you really wanted to compare, the cost of manufacturing this sword was only a few hundred dollars. On the other hand, it cost a few hundred thousand to make the real sword. The difference was huge.Wang Teng weighed the black metal sword in his hand. It felt just right.Men had an inclination and yearning for all kinds of weapons.Many people probably dreamed of carrying a sword and challenging the pugilistic world.In his past life, Wang Teng was in a technological society without any martial arts. Hence, he had no chance to get in touch with martial arts.1Now, as he looked at the long sword in his hand, he felt as excited as a predator looking at its prey.He had collected some basic sword skill attributes, so he had a rudimentary understanding of the sword. As it was still early, not many people had arrived for training. Considering the lack of bubbles to collect, Wang Teng made use of this time to test the power of his basic sword skill.He walked out of the weapons room and found an empty spot. After focusing and getting into the posture, he started practicing his sword skill based on his memory.\u201cSlash, slash, slash!\u201dWhen he waved his sword, he could hear the sound of it cutting the air. If he hit someone with it, the other party would definitely be injured or dead.1Among the students, the young man who had provided the basic sword skill attributes was practicing his sword skill too. He was stunned when he saw Wang Teng carrying a sword out of the room.He slowed down his actions and watched Wang Teng from afar.\u201cHe\u2019s just a novice!\u201dThe youth observed Wang Teng for a few seconds before shaking his head. Then, he ignored him.\u201cThis isn\u2019t difficult. I familiarized myself with it after two rounds.\u201cMy enlightenment is just 19.3 too. It isn\u2019t high!\u201dWang Teng stopped and wondered to himself in shock.He didn\u2019t know that his 19.3 points of enlightenment had already exceeded an average human. That was why he didn\u2019t find it difficult to learn basic skills.If he was learning a Force battle technique, it wouldn\u2019t be so simple.Force battle techniques were related to the use of the Force. It was already a complicated and profound skill in itself. People with low enlightenment would have a hard time getting their heads around it.2Thus, it could be deduced that practicing martial arts truly relied on one\u2019s talent. If you wanted to become a martial warrior, you needed to be a genius!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter practicing sword skills for some time, Wang Teng placed the sword back in the weapons room. He then focused on his fist skill.The student practicing sword skills shook his head when he saw this. Martial arts relied on quality, not quantity.It was better for Wang Teng to choose one skill instead of practicing two skills for a short time. In the end, he wouldn\u2019t be skilled in either.\u201cThis newbie is hardworking, but he\u2019s a little stupid.\u201d1Wang Teng didn\u2019t know that someone had called him stupid in his heart.Even though he practiced his sword skill only a few times, he felt that his understanding had increased a little. The results were not bad.He turned around and saw the tall and muscular figure standing at the side with his arms crossed in front of his chest.It looked like he had been standing there for a while.\u201cTeacher, when did you arrive? Why didn\u2019t you say something? You frightened me.\u201dThis was the instructor who had taught Wang Teng the ninth set of radio exercises yesterday evening. Now, he was staring at Wang Teng so intently that he felt goosebumps on his head.\u201cYoung man, I have been watching you for a while. Your fist skill is not bad.\u201d The instructor gave Wang Teng a thumbs up.\u201cThank you for your compliment.\u201dWang Teng felt embarrassed. He continued, \u201cTeacher, I\u2019m Wang Teng. How do I address you?\u201d\u201cMy name is Peng Hai. You don\u2019t have to call me a teacher. You can just call me Senior Brother Peng,\u201d said Peng Hai.1\u201cSenior Brother Peng.\u201d Wang Teng reacted naturally. Then, he asked, \u201cDo you always come so early?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not talented. I\u2019m twenty-plus years old, but I\u2019m still merely an advanced stage martial disciple. I can only work harder.\u201d Peng Hai was a little upset.For an instant, Wang Teng didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201cHahaha, there\u2019s no need to feel awkward. I\u2019m just running my mouth. Wang Teng, you are smart. As long as you work hard, I believe that you will become a martial warrior within three years. All the best,\u201d Peng Hai encouraged him.Three years?No, three days was enough!2This was what Wang Teng thought. But on the surface, he just nodded and replied, \u201cSenior Brother Peng, I will work hard.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will be going to the third floor for my practice. There will be another advanced stage martial disciple in charge of guiding you today. Of course, if you have any questions, you can come and look for me,\u201d said Peng Hai.\u201cWhat a devoted senior brother!\u201dWang Teng exclaimed when he saw him walking up the third floor.More and more students had started arriving now, making the scene lively.\u201cSenior Brother.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cSenior Sister, you look beautiful today!\u201d\u2026Friends greeted each other before starting their personal training. Time was precious for everyone, so they couldn\u2019t afford to waste a single second.Wang Teng stared at the students and suddenly felt that they looked like sheep walking on two legs. There was an endless amount of fur on their bodies.3\u201cGreat!\u201d The corners of Wang Teng\u2019s lips lifted slightly, and he gave a fatherly smile.Once the sheep were fat enough, he could kill them\u2014wait, he mustn\u2019t kill these good-quality sheep. He needed to cherish them so that he could collect fur from them continuously.3As everyone started practicing diligently, all kinds of attribute bubbles dropped down. Very soon, the lobby turned into a bubble sea, and Wang Teng happily swam in it.\u201cI love wool. Let me collect some wool\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t dare to sing this song aloud, afraid that he might get beaten to death. Thus, he just sang it in his heart and quietly collected the attributes.If there were notifications now, it would be like this:Dropped Strength*2, Speed*6. You picked it up. Your strength and speed have increased!Dropped Basic Fist Skill*2. You picked it up. Your Basic Fist Skill has increased in proficiency!Dropped Enlightenment*1, Physique*3. You picked it up. Your enlightenment and physique have increased!\u2026More people were training on Saturday as compared to the night before.Wang Teng had underestimated the number of potential attribute bubbles. Or rather, one could say that he underestimated how hardworking everyone was.The harder the students trained, the higher the probability of them dropping attributes.It was like squeezing milk. The harder one squeezed, the more milk came out.5An entire day passed just like that, and Wang Teng really became an intermediate-stage martial disciple.His strength, speed, and physique all had reached the standard of an intermediate stage martial disciple. He was now a bona fide intermediate stage martial disciple.Furthermore, he had reached the small achievement stage for his Basic Sword Skill, Basic Fist Skill, and Basic Footwork!Based on proficiency, the understanding of a battle technique could be split into a few stages: basic understanding, well-versed, small achievement, big achievement, mastery\u2026At the well-versed stage, the martial disciple would be able to unleash the power of the battle technique. The small achievement stage would have an extra advantage, with the power at least doubling.If he reached the big achievement stage or even mastery, the power of the battle technique would increase many times.Besides that, Wang Teng had also received a Basic Blade Skill and pushed it to the well-versed stage.1All in all, it was a good harvest today.In the evening, at dinner time.The students were all famished after an entire day of practice. They packed up and slowly left the training lobby.Wang Teng was reviewing his gains in a corner.He held the black steel sword in his hand and moved around by combining the sword skill with footwork. He waved his long sword and cut the air with it.The youth, who was practicing his sword skill this morning, had just returned his sword and was walking out from the weapons room.While walking past Wang Teng, he glanced at him unintentionally.\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026\u201dHe was dumbstruck. His jaws almost dropped to the floor as he rubbed his eyes furiously. He suspected that he was having an illusion.\u201cHe isn\u2019t at the well-versed stage. No, this is the small achievement. This is definitely the small achievement!\u201dHis own sword skill was still at the well-versed stage. Although he hadn\u2019t reached the small achievement, he knew what it felt like.How was that possible? In the morning, when he saw Wang Teng practicing, he was just a novice. His sword skill was extremely crude.Only a day had passed, and he was already at the small achievement stage!Was this a joke? It must be a joke, right?Was there really such a genius in this world?He was starting to doubt himself. In the morning, he mocked this young man and had called him stupid. Thinking back, it felt like a sick joke.1\u201cThis is crazy, crazy.\u201dThe youth shook his head with a bitter smile as he dejectedly walked out of the training lobby.1Wang Teng didn\u2019t notice this person\u2019s existence at all. He was wholly focused on practicing his blade skill, sword skill, fist skill, and footwork. After the session, he felt invigorated.\u201cPant!\u201dHe let out a long breath. Wang Teng then placed the weapons back in the weapons room.The lobby was almost empty when he walked to the underground parking lot. Along the way, he pulled out his attributes panel.Enlightenment: 28Physique: 52Strength: 4555Speed: 185Battle Techniques: Basic Fist Skill (small achievement), Basic Footwork (small achievement), Basic Sword Skill (small achievement), Basic Blade Skill (well-versed)\u201cI made great progress today!\u201d Wang Teng smiled happily as he drove home.In the house, Li Xiumei was cooking as usual. Smelling the strong meat fragrance wafting out from the kitchen, Wang Teng\u2019s stomach started growling.\u201cMom, what good food are you cooking today? It smells delicious!\u201d he walked into the kitchen and asked.\u201cYour dad specially asked me to buy some star beast meat for you,\u201d Li Xiumei smiled and replied.\u201cReally? My dad is willing to spend the money?\u201d That was unexpected.Star beasts were animals that had mutated due to the influence of the Force. Since the Force was born from the universe and the stars, these beasts were named star beasts.Their meat was highly nutritious. Normal meat couldn\u2019t be compared to them. Hence, they were very expensive too.\u201cIt smells amazing. Let me have a bite.\u201dHe looked at the braised meat on the table and started salivating. Wang Teng couldn\u2019t control himself anymore. He picked up a piece of meat and placed it in his mouth.\u201cOh my god, this is delicious. Mom, your cooking is fabulous.\u201d\u201cAre you a hungry ghost? Look at your smelly sweat. Hurry up and take a shower.\u201d Li Xiumei chased him out of the kitchen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Wang Shengguo returned home at around 6 pm, Li Xiumei asked their helper, Aunt Chen, to call Wang Teng down for dinner.Wang Teng had just finished bathing then. After changing his clothes, he was blowing his hair with the hairdryer.\u201cOkay, Aunt Chen, I will be down in a minute,\u201d he replied.After becoming a martial disciple, his sense of hearing had gotten better. The noise of the hairdryer didn\u2019t disturb Aunt Chen\u2019s voice at all.Within a minute, he dried his hair and unplugged the hairdryer. Then, he went down for dinner.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei were waiting for him.There were a few dishes on the table, steaming hot and fragrant. The family of three sat around the dinner table and started eating.\u201cSon, how was your practice today?\u201dLi Xiumei asked the question Wang Shengguo wanted to ask. He looked at Wang Teng intently.Honestly speaking, Wang Shengguo had a hard time being Wang Teng\u2019s father. Most of the time, his friends would boast about their children in front of him, telling him how outstanding they were or whose child became an intermediate stage martial disciple and an advanced stage martial disciple or whatnot.Wang Shengguo was the only person who couldn\u2019t brag about his son. He was the CEO of a huge company worth a few hundred million, but his son was ignorant.If he talked about his son, other people would laugh at him.Now, his son finally got his head straight and was willing to practice martial arts. Once he became an advanced stage martial disciple, he could finally boast to his friends.6\u201cNot bad. My senior brother from the martial arts academy said that I\u2019m talented,\u201d Wang Teng replied.He didn\u2019t tell his parents that he was already an intermediate stage martial disciple. He was afraid that they would faint from the sudden piece of good news.He would release the news to them slowly in the future.1\u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re talented. That\u2019s good.\u201dWang Shengguo was so happy that his eyes couldn\u2019t be seen properly. He waved his hand and said, \u201cYou just need to practice properly. Our Wang family might not be extremely wealthy and powerful, but we are at least better than ordinary people. You don\u2019t have to worry about martial arts resources.\u201d3Wang Teng just nodded, not saying anything.He wasn\u2019t worried about resources. Other people might need all sorts of martial arts resources, but he didn\u2019t need to rely on them.He had a bug with him. Other people\u2019s resources were his resources too!2\u201cCome, eat more food. You\u2019ve practiced the entire day, so you must be tired and hungry.\u201dRather than hoping he would become a martial warrior, Li Xiumei was more concerned if he was tired or had suffered. She felt her heart hurting a little when she saw him stuffing down his food.Wang Teng didn\u2019t have the time to talk. He had to admit that star beast meat was very delicious. It was fatty but not greasy, and it melted in his mouth like cotton candy.When he swallowed the meat, he could feel a stream of warmth spreading throughout his body. It soothed his tiredness and fatigue.Li Xiumei and Wang Shengguo ate some meat too, but they didn\u2019t dare to overeat.They didn\u2019t practice martial arts, so if they ate too much star beast meat, it would be harmful to their bodies instead.An average person in the martial arts era had a stronger physique because of the influence of the Force, but that was a long-term and gradual effect.After dinner, just as Wang Teng prepared to go to the Jixin Martial House again, his cell phone rang.He picked up his phone and heard Xu Jie\u2019s voice on the other end.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, we are already at the Wild Rose Pub. Come over quickly.\u201dWang Teng finally remembered this matter that had been thrown to the back of his mind. He smiled helplessly and replied, \u201cAlright, wait for me. I will come soon.\u201d\u201cIt looks like I can\u2019t go to the Jixin Martial House today.\u201dWang Teng felt some regret. But, he knew that he couldn\u2019t stay in the martial arts academy every single day.4\u201cI\u2019ll take it as a chance to relax.\u201dWang Teng bid farewell to his parents and went out of his house.Vroom, vroom, vroom\u2026The engine of the sports car was extremely loud. Whether it was the sleek body of the car or the loud engine, it captivated all the passers-by\u2019s attention.The pub street of the South City.There were many such pub streets in Donghai, but this one was the most prosperous in the South City.There were all kinds of pubs here with different styles and price points.The public bars were suitable for low-end consumers, while the high-end bars were for society\u2019s elites or the wealthy people.It might be hard to admit it, but humans had been segregated into different classes imperceptibly.4Every night, the pub street would light up brightly and colorfully. The dazzling neon lights intertwined with the glamorous reflections and colors, forming a dreamy and amazing scene.In the day, the stress from work bore down on the shoulders of these young men and ladies from the city. Hence, at night, they wanted to find a place to relax and release it all.Social pressure had never disappeared. In the martial arts era, it only got stronger.They needed to get the stress off their chest!Of course, to Wang Teng and his friends, this was just a place for them to have fun.There was a row of luxurious sports cars parked outside the Wild Rose Pub. Wang Teng had to search for a long time before he managed to find a parking spot. Then, he walked into the pub.Boom!The door separated the outside noise and the interior of the pub. When one stepped in, it felt like two different worlds.The instant he opened the door, the loud music, the peals of laughter of handsome men and pretty ladies, and the blinking lights congregated and lashed out on Wang Teng\u2019s eardrums and eyes.\u201cWhat a familiar feeling.\u201dIn his past life, ever since the Wang family had declined, Wang Teng never visited a pub.He felt that he was kicked out of this noisy world.But now, he was back again!Wang Teng strode into the Wild Rose Pub. He had a handsome face and was wearing branded goods all over. Due to his martial disciple practices the past two days, his body had gotten firm and muscular, and his mental state had transformed entirely. Like a diamond in the sand, he stood out among the crowd.Many ladies were instantly attracted to him. His appearance had piqued their fancy.Wang Teng used to be an old man. Now, he was a true young man with a youthful face. However, his aura was completely different.2He had experienced many things in his past life. There were ups and downs, and it was like riding a roller coaster.He had enjoyed wealth and experienced poverty both. He used to be an arrogant youth full of high spirits. Then, he fell to his lowest point in life and turned gloomy and blue\u2026His rich life experience made him mature and composed. It easily left a good first impression on people and made them like him.Wang Teng scanned the pub in search of Xu Jie and his friends.At this moment, a voice sounded on his left.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, over here. Over here!\u201dWang Teng looked at the lady waving at him. It was Bai Wei, the little sister in their circle of friends.1Her hair was tied in a bun. She looked smart and cheeky with a hint of charm.Wang Teng could still remember how beautiful this little girl was after she grew up. In fact, she could wreck a country with her beauty. Many men were enchanted by her.3\u201cYou came early.\u201dBai Wei shifted slightly to give some space to Wang Teng. Wang Teng sat down beside her.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, you\u2019re late,\u201d Xu Jie complained.\u201cThe night is young, and the fun is just starting. Why should I come early?\u201d Wang Teng smiled and replied.\u201cBrother Wang Teng!\u201dAnother young man greeted Wang Teng.\u201cYu Hao, long time no see.\u201d Wang Teng looked at the guy.\u201cMy father has been watching me closely recently. I had to sneak out today to come here,\u201d Yu Hao said helplessly.\u201cThis brat got dragged by his father to learn martial arts.\u201d Xu Jie chuckled at Yu Hao\u2019s plight.\u201cOh? How\u2019s your practice?\u201d Wang Teng was surprised.\u201cI\u2019m already a beginner stage martial disciple,\u201d Yu Hao rubbed his head and said shyly.1\u201cWhat the f**k, you little brat. You secretly became a beginner stage martial disciple!\u201d Xu Jie exclaimed in shock. It was obvious that he hadn\u2019t heard this piece of news before.\u201cYou are the only martial disciple among all of us. If someone bullies us in the future, we will seek your help.\u201d He then placed his arm around Yu Hao\u2019s shoulder and sniggered.\u201cLittle Mouse (nickname for Yu Hao), we will have to rely on you in the future!\u201d Bai Wei smiled and agreed with Xu Jie.Yu Hao started feeling a little proud when he heard their comments. Bai Wei\u2019s compliment made him feel exceptionally good.They were close friends, so it was normal to have ambiguous good feelings towards the opposite sex.1This was how Yu Hao felt about Bai Wei.Wang Teng smiled and asked, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Yuan Zhenghua here?\u201dEveryone turned silent.\u201cHe won\u2019t be coming!\u201d Xu Jie scoffed.\u201cHuh? What happened?\u201d Wang Teng frowned and asked.\u201cThat fellow is following Li Rongcheng now. He\u2019s his lackey,\u201d Xu Jie pouted and continued.\u201cLi Rongcheng!\u201dWang Teng pondered for a moment. Finally, he managed to dig this person up from the depth of his memory.Wang Teng and his friends had similar family backgrounds. Their parents\u2019 generation knew each other, and they also had business interactions. Hence, they formed their own friends\u2019 circle.As for the Li family, it was quite a huge family in Donghai. Actually, the Li family was more influential than their families.In Xu Jie\u2019s eyes, Yuan Zhenghua got close to Li Rongcheng because he wanted to curry favor with him.This was how their rich second-generation circle worked. Only those with similar backgrounds could be called friends. If the difference was too big, it would become a form of currying favor.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about him. Everyone has their own aspirations. There\u2019s nothing much to be said.\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t really care.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Let\u2019s not talk about that fellow anymore. Just his name is enough to make me angry,\u201d said Xu Jie.1They changed the topic and ordered some alcohol and fruit platters. Then, they chatted happily with one another. As time passed, Wang Teng slowly regained the feeling of his youth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAmidst their laughter and chatting, time passed very quickly.The music in the pub was blasting and the atmosphere was lively. Slowly, everyone got more comfortable.Xu Jie, Bai Wei, and Yu Hao were playing truth or dare.These three flipped their hands to decide the winner.The game had progressed for a few rounds, and everyone won and lost some. When challenged, they said interesting but harmless truths.If they didn\u2019t want to answer the \u2018truth\u2019 questions, they would choose the \u2018dare\u2019 option.The most exciting dare was when Yu Hao asked Bai Wei to seduce another young lady. No one expected Bai Wei to actually succeed in the end.1The young beauty, who was unlucky and got chosen, turned red in her ears from Bai Wei\u2019s seduction. Everyone hugged their stomach and burst into waves of laughter.This time, it was Yu Hao\u2019s turn.Xu Jie and Bai Wei laughed happily.Then, Xu Jie had a bad idea.His question caused Yu Hao\u2019s face to turn as red as the pig\u2019s liver.Wang Teng also laughed and shook his head. He didn\u2019t participate since he had too many secrets. It was easy for things to get out of control if he played this kind of game.2Xu Jie and Bai Wei stood at the side and passionately cheered Yu Hao on. They urged him to answer the question.Wang Teng stood up and went to the washroom.The star beast meat he ate at night was good for the body\u2019s metabolism. It helped him to purge the toxins out of his body.8After answering nature\u2019s call, Wang Teng walked back towards Xu Jie and his friends. The moment he got nearer, he noticed that his friends were surrounded by a group of people. Furthermore, Xu Jie and Yu Hao seemed to be quarreling with them.2This bunch of people looked like gangsters, with earrings and tattoos on their bodies. They didn\u2019t look like someone to be trifled with.Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but frown.Suddenly, one of the people pushed Xu Jie and shouted furiously, \u201cDamn it, this young lady dirtied my clothes. Are you planning to settle this matter with only an apology?\u201cDo you know how much this shirt costs?2\u201cAre you able to pay for the loss?\u201cYou are just a small child. Why are you learning from the adults and playing in a pub?\u201dAs he spoke, the people beside him burst out laughing. They were mocking Xu Jie and his friends. Yu Hao couldn\u2019t bear this humiliation.They were all rich second-generation and had been from young. Wherever they went, people would flatter and indulge them.If this person had a higher status than them, it was alright to suffer a little. However, they were just nobodies who had popped out from some random street or alley.They would become the joke of the rich second-generation circle if news spread that they got their asses kicked by a bunch of ruffians.Xu Jie\u2019s expression darkened when he was pushed by these people. He always looked relaxed and careless, as if he was the centre of the world. However, he wasn\u2019t stupid.He knew that the other party won them in numbers. Besides, he also had a lady on his side.If a conflict arose, they would be the ones on the losing end. Also, this was the martial arts era. Although these people looked ordinary, there might be a master among them.They would be dead if his thoughts became true!Hence, Xu Jie secretly took a deep breath and tried his best to say calmly, \u201cBuddies, it\u2019s our fault that we dirtied your clothes. We are in the wrong. We can compensate you.\u201cWhy do you have to be so overbearing? Do we have to make such a huge scene and let things get out of hand?\u201cEveryone here saw what happened clearly. Even if we call the police, we will be the ones in the right.\u201d\u201cF**k, are you planning to call the police? Are you threatening me?\u201dThe youth whose clothes got dirtied was around 20 years old. He had an aquiline nose and a sinister-looking face. This was a shameless, stubborn, and unreasonable person. When he felt that Xu Jie was threatening him, he started shouting at him.\u201cXu Jie, why are you talking nonsense with him? This fellow is creating trouble out of nothing. Bai Wei didn\u2019t touch him. He purposely let her bump into him when she got up and walked over,\u201d Yu Hao said angrily.\u201cBrat, if you don\u2019t have evidence, don\u2019t slander others,\u201d the sinister-looking youth scoffed and said.\u201cYou know clearly whether I\u2019m telling the truth or not,\u201d Yu Hao stood up and pointed at the youth.The sinister-looking youth turned impatient. He snorted and said, \u201cStop talking nonsense. Ask the young lady to have a few drinks with me and we can forget about this matter. If not\u2026 hehe.\u201d1\u201cWhat did you say? Repeat that. Do you believe that I will kill you?\u201d Yu Hao exploded in anger.These people actually wanted Bai Wei to drink with them. Anyone could tell what they were thinking of.This time, Yu Hao was really infuriated.Xu Jie instantly thought to himself.\u00a0Oh shit!It was obvious that the other party was setting a trap for them. The moment Yu Hao\u2019s fuse blew up, there was no way this issue could be resolved.\u201cYu Hao, stop talking!\u201d Bai Wei had been pulling Yu Hao all this while, but when she wasn\u2019t paying attention, he had broken free.At this moment, she also felt the atmosphere tensing up.\u201cLittle brat, how dare you try to kill me? I will kill you today.\u201dThe sinister-looking youth gave an eerie smile and took a step forward. He bent his fingers into a claw, aiming it at Yu Hao\u2019s neck.It was a vicious move. The moment he acted, he went for the kill.\u201cMartial disciple!\u201dSomeone exclaimed in surprise.Yu Hao\u2019s expression changed instantly. He didn\u2019t expect the other party to attack him so decisively and be a martial disciple at that.In his haste, he didn\u2019t have the courage to directly resist the man. He could only shift to the side to evade.Fortunately, Yu Hao was dragged by his father to learn martial arts, so he was a beginner stage martial disciple now.If he was just an average person, he might not have been able to dodge the attack. Rather, he would probably freeze on the spot because of the fright he received from his opponent\u2019s vicious and ruthless aura.The pub was in a mess.1Xu Jie quickly pulled Bai Wei to the side. They had never practiced martial arts before, so they couldn\u2019t help at all.The sinister-looking youth was slightly surprised when he saw Yu Hao successfully evading his attack. But he didn\u2019t mind. He twisted his body and swept his legs towards Yu Hao.Yu Hao hurriedly grabbed the chair beside him to block the kick.Bang!The metal chair was dented by the kick from the sinister-looking youth. Due to the huge force, Yu Hao flew out diagonally and slammed heavily on the ground.Along with him, tables and chairs also crashed on the ground.Alcohol bottles shattered loudly as they landed on the floor, spilling wine everywhere. The entire pub had been turned upside down within a second.The men and women, who were cheerful earlier, screamed and hid far away.Nonetheless, most people didn\u2019t leave. Instead, they hid some distance away to watch the show.\u201cCough, cough.\u201d Yu Hao clutched his chest and coughed a few times. He felt as if his ribs were broken.He knew that he offended someone powerful this time.Yu Hao had just become a martial disciple. Based on his opponent\u2019s strength, although the guy was within the range of a beginner stage martial disciple, he was only one step away from breaking through to the intermediate stage.The sinister-looking youth retracted his leg and walked towards Yu Hao step by step.\u201cLittle brat, weren\u2019t you acting arrogantly just now? You want to kill me, but your ability isn\u2019t enough.\u201dThe sinister-looking youth slowly walked towards Yu Hao and forced him into a corner. He coldly looked down at him while mocking him at the same time.\u201cIf you dare to touch me, my dad won\u2019t forgive you,\u201d Yu Hao gritted his teeth and said with a pale face.\u201cYoung friend, are you still a baby? Why are you looking for your father when you can\u2019t beat me?\u201d The sinister-looking youth sneered.3\u201cYou!\u201dYu Hao\u2019s entire face turned red in embarrassment.Xu Jie couldn\u2019t let his friend get humiliated anymore. He stood up and said, \u201cWe admit our defeat today. Tell us a number. We will compensate you.\u201dThe sinister-looking youth shook his forefinger and clicked his tongue.His expression was full of contempt.\u201cStupid child, I will teach you how to be obedient today. If you don\u2019t have the ability, don\u2019t stand up.\u201d The sinister-looking youth raised his right leg and swept it at Yu Hao\u2019s head viciously.Some people couldn\u2019t bear to see the next scene, closing their eyes. Xu Jie and Bai Wei\u2019s expression also changed abruptly.If this kick landed on Yu Hao, he would definitely get severely injured. Also, it was aimed at his head. He might be gone if he was unlucky.They didn\u2019t expect this sinister-looking youth to be so ruthless.Bang!A heavy collision was heard.However, Yu Hao remained at the same spot, unscathed. On the other hand, the sinister-looking youth flew out and slammed violently on the ground.\u201cPfft!\u201d He vomited a mouthful of blood.Everyone, including Xu Jie, Bai Wei, and the other people in the pub, were dumbfounded by this sudden change.The spectators stared absentmindedly at Wang Teng, who was standing in front of Yu Hao.Wang Teng placed his hand in his pocket and spat out the cigarette in his mouth. Like a cool mafia boss, he said indifferently, \u201cWhen was it your turn to lecture my friends?\u201d7The moment he finished speaking, though, his heart skipped a beat.When that sinister-looking youth hit the ground, a few attribute bubbles had also dropped.\u201cYou can drop attributes like this?\u201d4Wang Teng controlled the curiosity in his heart. There were many people around them, so he didn\u2019t walk forward.\u201cYou, you!\u201dYu Hao finally regained his senses. His face filling with astonishment, he stammered and didn\u2019t know what to say.Xu Jie and Bai Wei looked at Wang Teng in shock too. They felt as though it was their first time seeing him.\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you getting up? Is the floor very cooling?\u201d Wang Teng laughed and said.\u201cBrother, you are my biological brother from now on. You kept it from us really well,\u201d Xu Jie shouted excitedly.3Bai Wei ran over in small steps, staring at Wang Teng with glistening eyes all the while.\u201cEnough. Why are you shouting like this? When did I hide it from you? You just didn\u2019t ask me,\u201d Wang Teng replied helplessly.\u201cBastard, how dare you hit me? Charge! Kill this little brat!\u201d1The sinister-looking youth climbed up from the ground and wiped the blood off the edge of his lips. There was enmity and hatred in his eyes when he shouted to the people beside him.\u201cBrother, brother, this brat is too powerful. We are not his match!\u201d One of his friends looked at Wang Teng in fear.The sinister-looking beginner stage martial disciple youth had flown out like a ragdoll before they could even see how Wang Teng threw him. As normal young men who weren\u2019t martial disciples, what help could they offer?\u201cUseless!\u201d The sinister-looking youth kicked the person and shouted at Wang Teng, \u201cYoung brat, tell me your name if you dare. Wait for me to call my men.\u201d2Wang Teng Suddenly walked forward. On the other side, the sinister-looking youth flinched and took a few steps back.Wang Teng touched the bubbles casually and collected them.Strength*15Speed*12\u201cSo many attributes!\u201dWang Teng was amazed. This was the first time so many attributes had dropped from the same person.Killing monsters will give you more experience!1Is this the correct way of using my bug?He thought for a moment and threw this matter aside for the time being. This wasn\u2019t the right time to ponder on this question.Wang Teng lifted the corners of his lips and replied, \u201cWhat are you afraid of? My name is Li Rongcheng. I will give you half an hour to call your men. If you\u2019re late, I won\u2019t wait for you.\u201d5\u201cOkay, wait for me here.\u201d The sinister-looking youth left the Wild Rose Pub in a haggard state.1After they left, Bai Wei couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201cBrother Wang Teng, you\u2019re so bad, pushing the blame to Li Rongcheng. If he knew what you did, he would probably hate you to death.\u201dA cold light flashed past Wang Teng\u2019s eyes. No one saw it, though. He had a deep hatred towards Li Rongcheng. In his past life, they had no grudges between them. Still, after the Wang family declined, the other party showed no thoughts of letting them off.3\u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d Wang Teng had no interest in this affair anymore. He turned and walked out of the pub.\u201cWe are not waiting for them to come back?\u201d Yu Hao was unwilling to leave like this.Wang Teng slapped his head and said, \u201cDid you grow stupid after learning martial arts? We don\u2019t know how many people he will bring. What if he brings an advanced stage martial disciple to help him or a martial warrior? Are we still going to stay here and wait for death?\u201d2\u201cThat\u2019s right, you are too impulsive. If it wasn\u2019t for Brother Wang Teng, you\u2019d have suffered a huge beating today,\u201d Xu Jie couldn\u2019t help but reprimand Yu Hao.\u201cLet\u2019s go. They can look for Li Rongcheng if they want. I\u2019m not him.\u201d1After Wang Teng and his friends left the pub, he drove his car and disappeared into the night. If that bunch of people wanted to find him, they would need some luck.Even if they did find him, no one knew if it would be their luck or their misfortune\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe moment Wang Teng and his friends left the pub, the staff looked at the mess on the ground and turned to ask a 30-year-old man wearing a fitting suit.\u201cManager, are we going to let them go just like that?\u201dThe suited man glared at the staff member who had asked the question and replied furiously, \u201cWhat else can I do? Do you want to ask them to stay?\u201cYou\u2019re not observant at all!\u201cThat Zhao Gangbao is a beginner-stage martial disciple, and his brother is an advanced-stage martial disciple.1\u201cAs for the rich second generations, all of them come from wealthy families with assets of over a hundred million. Most importantly, there are two martial disciples among them. Let\u2019s not talk about the one that got beaten. The one that acted just now should be an intermediate stage martial disciple.\u201cHe became an intermediate stage martial disciple at such a young age. Do you know what that means?\u201cHe would at least become an advanced stage martial disciple. Idiot! If you want to die, don\u2019t pull me along.\u201dThe staff member was speechless. A second later, he started admiring the young man from the bottom of his heart\u2026 His manager had already investigated the backgrounds of these people.No wonder he could become the manager while he was only an unimportant low-level worker.The moment they met a problem, the difference between them was evident as night and day.\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d The staff immediately asked for advice modestly.\u201cLet\u2019s wait for some time. Didn\u2019t that Zhao Gangbao say that he will call for reinforcements? He is revengeful in nature, so he will definitely come back. He might break some things again, so we can calculate the losses after they leave.\u201cThat bastard. Why does he have to provoke the rich second generations? Do you believe that he won\u2019t be able to get away with his revenge this time?\u201cEven if his elder brother comes, it might be useless.\u201d The man in the suit started cursing the troublemaker.He thought for a moment and continued, \u201cWe will put all the losses on him. Also, we must preserve the surveillance images in the pub. They are our evidence, so we can\u2019t lose them. I\u2019ll make a copy later and send them to our boss through WeChat.2\u201cSince this matter is linked to a few martial disciples, normal people like us can\u2019t deal with it. We can only let the boss make the decision.\u201d\u2026After Wang Teng and the other people left, they didn\u2019t have the mood to go anywhere else. Hence, they went back home.It was past 10 pm when they reached their homes.Wang Teng didn\u2019t go to the Jixin Martial House after that. Instead, he surfed the Internet at home and flipped through pieces of information to strengthen his understanding of the martial arts era.What happened tonight was a warning to him.He had just met a random gangster, but this gangster\u2019s ability was already close to the intermediate stage.Had he not collected attributes furiously for the past two days and leveled up, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to settle today\u2019s affair. It would have led to a huge disaster.The percentage of people practicing martial arts wasn\u2019t high within the population of a few billion.4But, the problem was, when they were thrown into the sea of humans, you wouldn\u2019t know when you would be unlucky and meet one of them.What if he offended a real martial warrior in the future?The other party could injure him and the Wang family with just a flick of their fingers.He never wanted to experience the lesson from his past life again.When Wang Teng just got reborn, he had felt a sense of danger in his heart. Now, the premonition was getting stronger.He must become a real martial warrior as quickly as possible.Martial disciple\u2014even an advanced stage martial disciple\u2014wasn\u2019t enough. He would only have some ability to protect himself if he became a martial warrior.A little later than 11 pm, Wang Teng finished bathing and prepared to hit the bed. He picked up his phone to set an alarm. He needed to wake up early tomorrow.When he turned on his phone, he noticed that he had received two messages on WeChat.Although it was still 2009 in this world, WeChat already existed here and was popularized. Everyone would post some moments on their WeChat when they had nothing to do.There were many followers of the martial warriors\u2019 friend circle, and it was extremely popular. This was because the martial warriors could enter the Xingwu Continent through the dimensional rifts.Thus, they took photos of many amazing sceneries and wonders in the Xingwu Continent, as well as the exotic beauties there\u2026Nowadays, showcasing clothes, bags, and luxurious cars was all too low!The high-class and classy trend now was posting photos of the other world!Wang Teng looked at his two messages. One was sent more than an hour ago.Brother Wang Teng, I\u2019m home. \u2014From Bai Wei.There was a cute emoticon at the end of the sentence.The other message was sent three minutes ago.Brother Wang Teng, I\u2019m sleeping soon. Goodnight. \u2014From Bai Wei.She had added a sleeping emoticon at the end.\u201cWhy is this little girl so polite? I understand her message after she reached home, but why does she have to message me before she sleeps?\u201d Wang Teng had a weird expression on his face.4He pondered for a moment. This message was sent three minutes ago. She should be asleep now, right?Oh, it was sent four minutes ago.He decided that he shouldn\u2019t reply to her to prevent disturbing her.9Wang Teng scrolled through a few of his friends\u2019 posts. Nothing piqued his fancy, so he put down his phone and closed his eyes to get some rest.Within a minute, his breathing stabilized, and he entered deep sleep.On the other end of the phone, in a pink princess room, Bai Wei waited for a long time but didn\u2019t receive any reply. Disappointment appeared uncontrollably on her face.1\u201cSlap!\u201d She threw her phone and almost went crazy. After rolling around a few times on her bed, she felt frustrated.7\u2026The next day, Sunday.Wang Teng woke up early in the morning. After having his breakfast, he left the house under the contented gaze of his father, Wang Shengguo.\u201cFinally, I don\u2019t feel that gaze anymore.\u201dAfter the sports car drove a long distance, Wang Teng shivered.\u201cCould this be the legendary gaze of love?\u201d2\u201cSsss\u2026 That was so scary!\u201dAfter some time, Wang Teng arrived at the Jixin Martial House.A few attribute bubbles were scattered on the grass field and the pathways in the martial arts academy. He picked them up along the way and walked into the martial disciple training building.Some students were practicing in the training lobby on the first floor.Wang Teng took a look around briefly. Most of them were those who came the earliest yesterday.Wang Teng had a deep impression of them. He thought that he was early enough, but these people were even earlier than him. They were indeed hardworking.However, on this path of diligence, I, Wang Teng, will not admit defeat.Wang Teng walked over and greeted them politely. He also collected the attributes these people had dropped.1Basic Sword Skill*1Basic Footwork*1Strength*3Basic Fist Skill*2Speed*5\u2026\u201cThis is a good start! I\u2019m so happy!\u201dAfter collecting the attributes, Wang Teng didn\u2019t stop moving. He walked straight up the stairs to the second floor.His actions attracted the attention of a few students.The young man practicing his sword skill kindly reminded him, \u201cBased on the rules of the martial arts academy, a beginner stage martial disciple isn\u2019t allowed to go up to the second floor.\u201d\u201cI know. Thank you for your reminder.\u201d Wang Teng turned around and smiled. \u201cBut, yesterday night, I accidentally broke through and became an intermediate-stage martial disciple.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he had already climbed the second fleet of stairs. His figure couldn\u2019t be seen anymore.He boasted so calmly and even flicked his sleeves, not leaving anything behind.1The young man practicing his sword skill froze on the spot.\u201cHe, what did he say?\u201d He asked the other students in disbelief.\u201cThis brat just came yesterday, right?\u201dThe students didn\u2019t answer him directly. Instead, they retorted with another question.\u201cThat\u2019s not right. He came on Friday night. I saw him,\u201d another student suddenly said.\u201cHe became an intermediate stage martial disciple after practicing for two days? Are you kidding!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s definitely impossible. He must have practiced martial arts before he came to the martial arts academy. Look at him. He\u2019s obviously a rich second generation. The poor study while the wealthy learn martial arts. His family is influential, so he definitely learned martial arts earlier than us. It\u2019s easier for him too.\u201dEveryone agreed with this explanation.No one believed that someone in this world could turn from a weak, useless human being into a beginner stage martial disciple and then an intermediate stage martial disciple within two days.This was impossible.Genius wasn\u2019t enough to describe such a person. You could only call him a monster!\u2014Of course, that was excluding those people who cheated and had bugs!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere were many students on the second floor of the training building.Wang Teng scanned his surroundings, and his eyes suddenly lit up when he saw a familiar figure.It was that agile fatty!5At this moment, just like the last time, he was sprinting on the running track.So, the fatty had also become an intermediate stage martial disciple. No wonder Wang Teng didn\u2019t see him yesterday on the first floor. He had come to the second floor.1\u201cFatty, good morning!\u201dWang Teng greeted the other party as though he was an old friend.The fatty turned around when he heard the voice. His expression then instantly changed. \u201cWhy is it this fellow!\u201dHe pretended to ignore Wang Teng and didn\u2019t reply to him. Instead, he started running faster.Wang Teng watched him run like a madman. This fellow didn\u2019t know that he was dropping attributes behind him. But it made Wang Teng elated.He executed his Basic Footwork and followed behind the fatty, picking up the attributes along the way.Speed*6Speed*7Basic Footwork*3Speed*6\u2026After becoming an intermediate stage martial disciple, the fatty\u2019s dropping even more attributes. So, the more powerful you are, the more attribute bubbles you drop?Wang Teng thought to himself.In that case, he would definitely be able to pick up more attributes on the second floor. After all, everyone here was an intermediate stage martial disciple.He believed that it wouldn\u2019t take long for him to break through and become an advanced stage martial disciple. He would be one step closer to becoming an official martial warrior then.\u201cWhy are you following me so closely like a medicinal plaster? Is there an end to this?\u201d2The indignant voice of the fatty in front pulled Wang Teng out of his deep thoughts.\u201cHaha, where\u2019s the fun in training alone? Why don\u2019t we have a competition? Let\u2019s see who can run ten rounds in the shortest time. What do you think? Do you want to compete?\u201d asked Wang Teng.The fatty wanted to reject him. But, he had a sudden thought, so he replied, \u201cIf you lose, you will stay away from me and let me train alone.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dWang Teng agreed and continued, \u201cWhat if you lose?\u201d\u201cWhat a joke! How can I lose!\u201d The fatty scoffed.\u201cConfidence is a good thing. However, since you raised a bet, I have mine too. Competition must be fair, right?\u201d Wang Teng said.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d The fatty frowned and asked.\u201cVery simple. If you lose, you will sing this song \u2018Zhen Fu\u2019 (which means conquer in Chinese). What do you think?\u201d Wang Teng asked.\u201cAlright. As long as you win, I can sing anything for you. Don\u2019t talk about one \u2018Zhen Fu\u2019. I can sing ten songs for you.\u201d The fatty patted his chest and agreed.Wang Teng sniggered in his heart.\u00a0Ten songs? You would definitely be crying later.\u201cThere\u2019s a timer at the side. Let me find someone to help us check the time.\u201dThe fatty walked to one side after he finished speaking and spoke a few sentences to a student who was training. He asked the student for help.The student nodded and followed the fatty to the side of the running track.\u201cBoth of you can prepare first. When I shout \u2018start\u2019, you will start running,\u201d the student standing beside the timer said.The two participants nodded.The fatty started preparing for the sprint. He shook his legs to relax his muscles, but in the end, only his fat shuddered violently.The other students also gathered around the running track when they saw two students having a competition.However, they couldn\u2019t help but laugh upon seeing the fatty\u2019s fats shaking.\u201cThis fatty went to learn footwork and speed even though he is so fat. I wonder what he\u2019s thinking.\u201d\u201cBut, honestly speaking, he does have some ability. He\u2019s faster than a rabbit when he runs.\u201d1\u2026Upon hearing the discussions from the side, the fatty felt pleased with himself. He gave Wang Teng a provocative look and stood up straight without moving. He didn\u2019t even get into the starting position.Wang Teng smiled. He copied his actions, standing still on the spot. At the same time, he asked casually, \u201cFatty, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cMy name is Wu Liang!\u201d The fatty pointed to his nose and said, \u201cYou must remember it in case you don\u2019t even know who you lost to.\u201dAfter he finished, he continued asking, \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\u201cWang Teng. Remember to sing \u2018Zhen Fu\u2019 after you lose!\u201d Wang Teng smiled and said.1\u201cTsk!\u201d Wu Liang rolled his eyes in contempt.Right then, a shout was suddenly heard from the side.\u201cReady\u2026 start!\u201dWang Teng and the fatty were talking to each other, but the moment the voice fell, they dashed out simultaneously.The expressions of the people at the side changed slightly. Both of them had moved like lightning. In an instant, they were more than ten meters away.They maintained their high speed as they continued running. They didn\u2019t bother to save their stamina for the last burst of fire just because they were running ten rounds.This was a timed competition, and they were competing based on time. Also, people who practiced martial arts had great stamina. Running ten rounds wasn\u2019t a big deal to them.Wu Liang might be fat, but he wasn\u2019t slow at all. Instead, his speed exceeded the spectators\u2019. There weren\u2019t many who could practice their footwork and speed to his stage.This was the reason why everyone\u2019s expression changed instantly.As expected of a fatty who ran like the wind.This was the exclamation in many people\u2019s minds.But, when they looked at Wang Teng, they looked extra shocked.They understood the fatty\u2019s abilities, so they accepted his speed as a matter of fact, even though they were surprised. However, Wang Teng was an unfamiliar face. It was highly likely he had just become an intermediate stage martial disciple.Yet, this newly advanced intermediate stage martial disciple\u2019s speed was on par with Wu Liang. This was amazing.Wait, they remembered that Wu Liang had also just become an intermediate stage martial disciple!He only came to the second floor yesterday.In that case, these two people were both fresh newbies!Were the newbies all the fierce nowadays?How were old people like them supposed to live?It was indeed true; the younger generations would excel the older generation, leaving no paths for the older generation.A wave of sorrow surged through the hearts of a few intermediate stage martial disciples.\u201cThis newbie is slightly weaker than Wu Liang,\u201d someone commented.\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. Although he\u2019s lagging, the distance between him and the fatty is the same. Didn\u2019t you notice that he\u2019s never more than 20 meters behind the fatty?\u201d\u201cHey, if you hadn\u2019t said it, I wouldn\u2019t have noticed.\u201dThey looked at Wang Teng in astonishment. When they observed him carefully, they could tell that he didn\u2019t seem tired at all.Indeed, Wang Teng wasn\u2019t giving it his all. He was trailing Wu Liang because he wanted to pick up the attribute bubbles.Also, the whole purpose of this competition was to let Wu Liang drop more attributes.He had gotten some basic understanding of his bug. If he wanted to let these \u2018small monsters\u2019 drop more attributes, he needed to make them train harder. Or\u2026He could hit them. The harder he hit them, the more attributes they might drop!He had received the inspiration for the last point from the sinister-looking youth. But, this hypothesis still needed affirmation.After all, he couldn\u2019t find a random person and beat him up, right?To get rid of Wang Teng, Wu Liang was exceptionally serious about this competition. He used more effort, so naturally, more attributes dropped. He was dropping them like laying eggs the entire way.4Basic Footwork*2Speed*5Speed*6Basic Footwork*4Speed*7\u2026Wang Teng felt that he was playing \u2018Temple Run\u2019, and the attribute bubbles were like the gold coins.2He could almost hear the ringing sounds when he collected a bubble.As Wang Teng ran and collected the attributes, his own attributes kept rising. He didn\u2019t feel tired the entire way. Instead, he felt more and more energetic.This was why he dared to compete with the fatty. He was cheating, and it would be embarrassing if he still lost.When the onlookers saw Wang Teng revealing a smile on the corners of his lips, their expressions turned strange.This fellow was walking a dog\u2014no wait, he was walking the fatty!All he lacked was a chain.Wu Liang didn\u2019t notice anything weird, though. When he saw that Wang Teng was always lagging behind him, he looked back and laughed. \u201cThis is so simple. I told you that you\u2019re not my match. Why are you making yourself suffer!\u201dSwoosh~The moment he finished speaking, a figure dashed past beside him.The smile on the fatty\u2019s face froze. His mouth dropped, and he opened his eyes wide. He couldn\u2019t say anything for a long while.\u201cF**k!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You were preserving your strength all these while and only released it at the last stage. You made me happy for no reason!\u201dWang Teng sniggered and said, \u201cWho was the one who was so confident at the start?\u201cAlso, I wanted to save some of your ego, so I let you be in the lead for a while before catching up at the end.\u201d\u201cHmph~ Why should I believe you? You bad old man, you\u2019re so evil.\u201d Wu Liang snorted.1(\u3012\u3008\u3012)Why did I become a bad old man?\u201cFine. Do you dare to admit your loss? If you do, I won\u2019t ask you to fulfill your bet with me.\u201d Wang Teng was speechless.\u201cWho says that I can\u2019t admit my defeat. All I have to do is sing the song \u2018Zhen Fu\u2019, right? What\u2019s there to be afraid of?\u201d Wu Liang straightened his neck.\u201cGo ahead and sing, then! The flowers are drooping from waiting.\u201d Wang Teng glanced at him from the corner of his eyes.Wu Liang instantly looked as though he had eaten a fly. The expression on his fat face kept changing.He couldn\u2019t put down his ego and sing the song, but on the other hand, he didn\u2019t want other people to think that he couldn\u2019t accept losing either.His entire expression could be described in one word\u2014dilemma!In the end, he admitted defeat while looking like a deflated balloon. He started singing with the voice of a mosquito.\u201cI can\u2019t hear you!\u201d Wang Teng placed his hand beside his ear and pretended that he couldn\u2019t hear properly.Wu Liang was furious. After taking a long, deep breath, he increased his volume.\u201cThis is how I got conquered by you\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dThe people around them burst out laughing. This fatty was tone deaf!But, they felt sorry for him too.He had to sing \u2018Zhen Fu\u2019 in front of so many people. This must be black history in his life.Wang Teng was really evil. He actually pranked someone like this.Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but laugh too. He waved his hand and said, \u201cFine, fine, stop singing. Your voice will frighten little children!\u201dWu Liang replied, \u201cDon\u2019t! I still need to sing ten songs!\u201dThis time, it was Wang Teng\u2019s turn to feel speechless.This fatty was a little cunning!\u201cThis is how I got conquered by you\u2026\u201d Wu Liang got even more motivated when he saw Wu Liang\u2019s frustrated look.2\u201cGet off!\u201dWang Teng ran away like his life depended on it. Damn it, his voice was too terrifying!The fatty was fun to play with, but he was too cunning.Too much was always not good. Since he was a good pastime, he would play with him slowly in the future.The fatty looked around the same age as him, yet he was already an intermediate stage martial disciple. This meant that he had the talent.He might become a martial warrior in the future.He was a fat sheep full of potential. Wang Teng could milk this fatty as his long-term dueling buddy!1The students gathering around ran away in fright. They hid far away and discussed with one another for some time. While they marveled at the young men\u2019s abilities, their competitiveness was ignited too. All of them started practicing even harder.As a result, there were already many attribute bubbles littering the second floor, as if it was raining here.Wang Teng walked over and picked all of them up like a Good Samaritan. He also greeted the other students.Speed*6Strength*7Basic Fist Skill*3Strength*5Basic Blade Skill*6\u2026After another round of upgrading his attributes, he stopped in front of a student practicing his fist skill, observing the young man for a long time.When the student finished his session, he stopped to take a rest.Wang Teng took the chance and walked forward, \u201cSenior Brother, shall we have a duel?\u201dThe young man looked a little older than Wang Teng and seemed to be slightly above 20.He was stunned for a moment when he heard Wang Teng\u2019s challenge. He replied, \u201cYou\u2019re Wang Teng, right? I am Zhang Shaoyang.\u201cI saw you competing with Wu Liang just now and am a little interested in you. Since you brought it up yourself, let\u2019s have a duel.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother Zhang, please!\u201dThe two of them stood in an empty area and distanced themselves. Wang Teng raised his hand to ask Zhang Shaoyang to start.\u201cI will not be polite then.\u201dZhang Shaoyang clenched his fist and stomped his leg, darting towards Wang Teng first.Bang, bang, bang\u2026The duo got right down to it. Wang Teng didn\u2019t use other battle techniques, only employing his footwork and fist skills to fight with Zhang Shaoyang.As their fists went back and forth, the fight looked violent and fierce. If they were hit, their punches would directly land on their muscles.Zhang Shaoyang was slightly surprised. He was a muscular man. One look and you could tell that he was a bulky guy.However, Wang Teng was wearing loose sportswear, so the muscles on his body weren\u2019t prominent. From his appearance, he just looked like an ordinary youth.But when he started fighting for real, he was full of explosive power.It didn\u2019t feel compatible at all!Also, Wang Teng\u2019s ability astounded him too. A moment ago, he thought that Wang Teng was already quick with his footwork. Now, he felt that he needed to retract his judgment.Wang Teng\u2019s fist skill wasn\u2019t weaker than him.This fellow seems to be a genius!\u00a0Zhang Shaoyang thought to himself.They were like a Roland for an Oliver, evenly matched. They fought back and forth, and for a moment, no one won or lost.5\u201cZhang Shaoyang\u2019s Basic Fist Skill has reached the big achievement stage. Yet, Wang Teng isn\u2019t at a disadvantage after fighting for so long.\u201dThe students standing far away didn\u2019t have high hopes for Wang Teng initially. Hence, they didn\u2019t take much notice when he challenged Zhang Shaoyang. They thought that it would end within a few rounds.But, the reality was unexpected. The two of them fought for a long while, without any results.\u201cCould it be that Zhang Shaoyang didn\u2019t try his best?\u201d Someone was puzzled.\u201cAre you stupid? Look at Zhang Shaoyang. Does he look like he\u2019s not trying his best?\u201d Another felt speechless.\u2026\u201cI\u2019m not fighting anymore. I\u2019m not fighting anymore!\u201dZhang Shaoyang quickly waved his hands after the two of them collided and retreated a few steps.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to fight anymore?\u201d Wang Teng was unwilling to stop.\u201cYour fist skill is on par with me. There won\u2019t be any outcomes if we continue fighting. Instead, we might lose too much energy, affecting our training for the entire day,\u201d said Zhang Shaoyang.\u201cAlso, if you didn\u2019t compete with Wu Liang, I would have lost already.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s not go further than necessary. We will have more chances to duel in the future,\u201d replied Wang Teng.\u201cOkay. I learned many things after fighting with you.\u201d Zhang Shaoyang nodded.Wang Teng went to the side to rest and restore his stamina. At the same time, he counted the gains from his duel.Basic Fist Skill*23Strength*45As expected, his guess was correct. Fighting with \u2018monsters\u2019 would make them drop attributes. The harder they fought, the more attributes they dropped, especially attributes like Basic Fist Skill. They would never drop so much when they were practicing.\u201cSo this is the correct way to use my bug!\u201dWhile strolling around the training room, Wang Teng slowly regained his stamina. At the same time, he also picked up the attributes from the other students.Half an hour later, most of his stamina was restored.He went to the weapons room to pick a sword. Then, he came in front of a student practicing sword skills and said, \u201cSenior Brother, are you free to test my sword skills?\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d The other party was decisive and nodded in agreement.More and more students arrived at the training arena. However, only those who came earlier knew that two duels had happened before this.\u201cThat Wang Teng is having a duel with another person again. This time, he\u2019s using his sword skill!\u201dA student that just came felt puzzled. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? This student looks unfamiliar. Is he new?\u201dAnother student started explaining to him.On the other side, Wang Teng and the other young man had already started fighting. Their long swords collided, letting out sparks and metallic clangs.A sword duel was naturally more dangerous, but both parties knew their limits well. They wouldn\u2019t intentionally hurt the other party.When the duel ended, Wang Teng gained many attributes as expected. He rested at the side.Basic Sword Skill*26Strength*30\u2026An hour later, Wang Teng found a student practicing blade skill and cupped his fists at the young man. \u201cSenior Brother, my blade is extremely thirsty now. Let\u2019s have a duel.\u201d9\u201cAlright, my blade couldn\u2019t keep itself down anymore too!\u201d7The two of them looked exceptionally serious. They were sparks in their eyes as they looked at each other~3\u2026The other students were already numb.Wu Liang was one of them. He suddenly felt pity for the student Wang Teng found when he looked at him.This Wang Teng was crazy about duels. He knew all the battle techniques, and the result was always a draw\u2026He must be a monster!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFor the entire morning, besides picking up the attributes other people dropped, Wang Teng also looked for them for duels.Footwork, fist skill, sword skill, and blade skill. As long as he knew something, he would find others to challenge them.His nickname, duel fanatic, started spreading among the students unknowingly. No one knew who started this nickname, though.2\u201cYou better make sure that I don\u2019t know who that bastard is!\u201dWhen Wang Teng heard someone calling him by this nickname, his entire face turned black.What the f**k!What grudges do we have? Why do you have to frame me like this?\u201cAh\u2026 choo!\u201dThe fatty, Wu Liang, was eating his lunch in the cafeteria. Suddenly, he sneezed uncontrollably.He choked, and the rice in his mouth flew up to his nose. Next, the rice bits flowed down his nose with his mucus, painting a disgusting scenery.3He rubbed his nose and said with frustration, \u201cWhy did I sneeze for no reason? Is someone scolding me behind my back? How mean.\u201d\u2026Wang Teng looked at his attributes panel. The gains on the second floor were huge. In one morning, most of his attributes were close to an advanced stage martial disciple.Enlightenment: 35Physique: 667Strength: 6211Speed: 323Battle Techniques: Basic Fist Skill (big achievement), Basic Footwork (big achievement), Basic Sword Skill (big achievement), Basic Blade Skill (small achievement)The requirements for an advanced stage martial disciple were physique 70, strength 700 kg, and speed 100 meters in 5 seconds.2He just needed to work harder in the afternoon, and a fresh new advanced stage martial disciple would come out of the oven!His basic battle techniques were also upgraded by a level. His fist skill, sword skill, and footwork had advanced from the small achievement stage to the big achievement stage. His blade skill changed from the well-versed to the small achievement stage.In short, his ability had undergone a tremendous change.Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t pick up any new battle techniques today. It seemed that most people chose these few battle techniques to practice and master.Wang Teng walked out of the training building and headed to the cafeteria of the martial arts academy.He had learned from Zhang Shaoyang and a few other students that the Jixin Martial House also had a cafeteria.As long as one had the money, one could eat anything. Even if you wanted to eat star beast dishes, they had it!These star beasts were all killed by the martial warriors from the martial arts academy and sold to the academy in exchange for points or money. Hence, the martial arts academy had an abundant array of star beasts ingredients as compared to other places.It included rare star beasts that weren\u2019t sold outside at all.The martial arts academy had specially hired Force chef masters to attend to these ingredients.Force chef was a secondary career derived from the martial warriors.1Every single Force chef must have the Force in their bodies. If anyone wanted to cultivate with the Force, they needed to be a martial warrior.A martial warrior as a chef? Would anyone dare to think about that?However, the dishes cooked by a Force chef master weren\u2019t ordinary. They would benefit martial warriors when they cultivated.The methods of preparations and the dishes all came from the Xingwu Continent. Even this career title originated from there.The salary of Force chef masters was high, and there were no dangers. Many martial warriors pursued and flattered Force chefs because they wanted to eat Force dishes. Hence, the status of Force chef masters was actually rather high.On the way to the cafeteria, Wang Teng asked Zhang Shaoyang curiously, \u201cSo, you\u2019re saying that the cafeteria of the Jixin Martial House provides Force dishes?\u201dZhang Shaoyang explained, \u201cYes. Our Jixin Martial House is one of the top three martial arts academies in China. Naturally, we have the ability to hire Force chef masters.\u201cToday, after many experiments and trial and error by the Force chefs on the earth, new dishes were created based on the ones from the Otherworld. An entire system of Force dishes cuisine was formed.\u201cBut, these Force dishes from the Otherworld are only available on the third floor of the cafeteria. Normally, only martial warriors will go there. Average students can\u2019t afford them.\u201dWang Teng nodded. He was shocked as he asked, \u201cOh? We can still see martial warriors?\u201d\u201cWe can see them, but not many. Most of the martial warriors are exploring the Xingwu Continent during normal times or executing some missions released by the martial arts academies. They won\u2019t spend much time in the martial arts academy,\u201d Zhang Shaoyang elaborated.Wang Teng nodded as he continued to expand his knowledge. \u201cAre Force dishes expensive?\u201d\u201cThey are not just expensive. Usually, Force dishes cost tens of thousands. They are difficult to prepare, and the ingredients are rare. Some of them even cost a few million or tens of millions. They are extremely expensive,\u201d Zhang Shaoyang exclaimed.Oh my god, even Michelin chefs aren\u2019t so outrageous.Wang Teng was flabbergasted.Did one meal cost a few million or tens of millions? Were martial warriors all so wealthy?2Of course, he didn\u2019t go to the third floor of the cafeteria. He went to eat on the first floor with Zhang Shaoyang and a few other students.A few million for a meal, Wang Teng wasn\u2019t so extravagant.Even if he wanted to eat, he would wait until he became a martial warrior and was able to earn a hundred million easily. At that time, he could let his parents have a taste of the Force dishes too.2After eating, he rested for an hour.Then, he continued training in the afternoon.Wang Teng grabbed his thirsty blade and started dueling with the student. He mainly looked for those practicing Basic Blade Skills.2Among all his battle techniques, only his blade skill was at the small achievement stage.A human had to be fair. He mustn\u2019t favor any skill more than the others. Hence, he decided to raise his basic blade skill to the big achievement stage first.2Time flew in the afternoon. In a blink of an eye, a few hours had passed. All of Wang Teng\u2019s attributes had broken through the threshold of an advanced stage martial disciple.That meant that he had finally become an advanced stage martial disciple.Among the martial disciples, he was part of the elites now. He was a slightly stronger nobody.5His basic blade skill had also reached the big achievement stage.However, his footwork, fist skill, and sword skill accidentally reached the perfected stage. They flung the basic blade skill behind them again.What happened to fairness?Basic Blade Skill: \u2018Wronged emoticon\u20192Everything seems to be rising a little too quickly!\u00a0Wang Teng felt helpless in his heart.His life was so lonely!Wang Teng decided to continue staying on the second floor for a few more days. He would still be able to raise his attributes.There might be more attributes for him to collect on the third floor, but a few days wouldn\u2019t make any difference.At night, Wang Teng returned home and had dinner with his parents. Then, he went back to the Jixin Martial House to pick up attributes.He worked until 11 pm before he finally returned home.After bathing, he laid on the bed and silently opened his attributes panel to take a look.Enlightenment: 432Physique: 84Strength: 9641Speed: 533Battle Techniques: Basic Fist Skill (perfected), Basic Footwork (perfected), Basic Sword Skill (perfected), Basic Blade Skill (big achievement)Not bad.\u00a0Looking at his attributes, he was above average among the advanced stage martial disciples.As long as Wang Teng didn\u2019t meet an official martial warrior, he would be able to protect himself.He was immersed in his thoughts as he laid on his bed. After some time, he slowly slipped into the dreamland.The next day, Wang Teng woke up early as usual. It was Monday, so he needed to go to school.He almost forgot that he was still a senior high student.Although he just got reborn, he still had the mindset of an adult. Coincidentally, it was the weekend, so he went to practice his martial arts. He didn\u2019t do things that a senior high student should do.2In the morning, everyone sat down together to have breakfast.Wang Shengguo ate some porridge and said, \u201cAlthough you\u2019re practicing martial arts now, you can\u2019t forget about your schoolwork. There\u2019s a martial arts course at university. If you\u2019re able to become an advanced stage martial disciple before the university entrance exam, you can apply for it.\u201dIt would be a good choice if he could enter a military academy. After he graduated, he would at least be a major or above.\u201cIn this day, the military ranks are closely related to one\u2019s martial arts. However, until now, only martial warriors who graduated from recognized military academies are given military titles. Martial warrior graduates from normal universities won\u2019t have this special privilege.\u201dWang Teng nodded and started contemplating.The country was the best protection. If he could enter a military academy and receive a military rank after he graduated, it was a good solution too.Of course, even if he entered a normal university, there would be many benefits for martial warriors. Regular academies also had formed their own factions.The amount of protection every martial warrior faction gave to their own martial warriors was undeniable. Also, the martial warriors were given more freedom.All in all, each had its own benefit.It seemed that if there was a possibility, he should get into a good university. He had a bug, but he needed time to grow too.1Before he became someone powerful enough to disregard all rules, the best solution was to find strong support.The problem was, whether it was his past life or the current one, he had never studied properly in school. His school results were atrocious\u20263Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now, he listened really carefully and started pondering over his father\u2019s words.\u201cHe has grown up\u2026\u201dWang Shengguo felt content. Wang Teng\u2019s performance was vastly different these two days.He used to hear other people telling him that their child suddenly grew up and became mature. He could only smile bitterly in response. He felt that his useless son wouldn\u2019t be able to mature before he turned 30.4As his father, he was really worried for him!Yet, now, Wang Shengguo managed to wait until the day arrived!Sob~ this is too touching.\u00a0His sternness was finally starting to take effect. He didn\u2019t waste his effort being a strict father.Wang Shengguo finished his porridge and wiped his mouth. He said with a serious expression, \u201cThe university entrance exam is a turning point in life. I hope that you can think about it properly.\u201cI\u2019m informing you about this not because I want you to take the exam this year.\u201cThe university entrance exam is just around the corner. Your studies are bad and you only started practicing martial arts recently, so there\u2019s no hope of you taking the exam this year. We can only wait until next year or the year after.\u201cThe Ministry of Education has a rule. You can register for the martial arts course anytime before you turn 20. Hence, you have two chances to repeat your high school.\u201cAs long as you can become an advanced stage martial disciple before you are 20, you will have the chance to register for the martial arts course. I can hire tutors to help you with your studies and give you specialized tutoring. There will be a good chance for you to enter university.\u201dHe looked at Wang Teng after he finished speaking with a hint of anticipation in his eyes. He hoped that his song would have a bright future!2This was probably the wish all parents had for their children. This might be a form of love.Wang Teng slowly finished the fried dough stick in his hand under Wang Shengguo\u2019s gaze. Then, he raised his head and smiled. \u201cDad, maybe we won\u2019t have to wait until next year.\u201dWhen he saw Wang Teng\u2019s smile, Wang Shengguo knew that his son was listening to what he just said. But why did he feel like scolding him upon hearing his words?He couldn\u2019t help but laugh and say, \u201cIt\u2019s good to have confidence, but please don\u2019t act in front of your father, your little brat.\u201dHe didn\u2019t believe that Wang Teng was able to pass his university entrance exam this year.\u201cThis child is getting naughtier and naughtier.\u201dLi Xiumei took the coat on the clothing rack and passed it to Wang Shengguo as she complained sweetly.\u201cI won\u2019t be arranging a driver for you today. You can drive or take public transport. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d Wang Shengguo took over the coat and left the house.Wang Teng was speechless. Was he very worrying in the past? His father always asked someone to fetch him to school and escort him home afterward, fearing that he would fool around outside.He shook his head and bade farewell to his mother. \u201cMom, I\u2019ve finished eating. I will be leaving.\u201d\u201cOkay. Be careful on the way.\u201d\u2026Wang Teng drove his car and reached Donghai No. 1 High School in 20 minutes. He found a space to park his car and started walking towards his classroom.Well\u2026 if he remembered correctly, he should be in year three class eight.The year three classroom building.Most of the students here seemed to be in a hurry. The atmosphere here was much tenser than the classroom buildings for year one and year two.When he reached his classroom, many students were already studying hard.Most of them moved their lips as they silently recited their textbooks. They didn\u2019t make any sound to avoid disturbing others.Wang Teng\u2019s arrival seemed highly conspicuous in the quiet classroom. A few students raised their heads with a tinge of surprise in their gazes.But, they didn\u2019t think too much.This rich second generation probably woke up early accidentally.He will most likely resume his usual late arrivals tomorrow.These few thoughts flashed through the minds of several students in unplanned unison. They hurriedly lowered their heads and continued what they were doing after that.When Wang Teng walked into the classroom, his eyes suddenly lit up.Attribute bubbles!A few bubbles had dropped beside a few students.He watched as one of the female students silently recited her textbook and a small bubble appeared on her lips. As she continued, the bubble slowly became bigger\u20261Then, it dropped on the floor with a \u2018splat\u2019.She really looked like a goldfish blowing bubbles.Wang Teng was in a trance.\u00a0You could drop bubbles when you are studying?He always thought that only martial arts had attributes. From the looks of it, that wasn\u2019t the case.He walked over calmly and collected the attributes.7Language*10English*155Biology*12Chemistry*15\u2026The next moment, Wang Teng smiled. A second ago, he was still worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to study well. Now, the study attributes came like rain in a drought.His bug was really amazing!3After he collected the attributes, relevant knowledge started appearing in his mind.He felt as though he had learned all of this before. They had merged into his memory and would never disappear.Wang Teng sat down beside the lady that blew the bubble just now.Indeed, this was Wang Teng\u2019s table buddy.This lady was their class monitor, Lin Chuhan. She came from a normal family, but she was an ultimate star student. She had the chance to enter the top universities in China.1One was a rich second generation who couldn\u2019t study, while the other was an average civilian who was a star student.By right, there was no way these two people could sit together. But, their headteacher, Fan Weiming, arranged their seating like this.He claimed that he did this so that the good student could teach her poor fellow classmate.Hence, the best student, Lin Chuhan, had to teach the worst student, Wang Teng.Old Fan\u2019s unexpected move almost caused all the students in the class to sprain their backs.He wasn\u2019t afraid that this would affect Lin Chuhan and this star student might go astray because of Wang Teng. There was a chance that she could enter the best university in the country.Of course, Lin Chuhan\u2019s appearance was another reason why everyone was filled with righteous indignation.This was such a good and pretty little flower. Old Fan was committing a crime by placing her beside such an unworthy person.Unfortunately, no one dared to voice out their anger.Wang Teng was a rich second generation who would be inheriting hundreds of millions of assets in the future. They couldn\u2019t afford to offend him.However, everyone was surprised by Wang Teng. Although he was incompetent in his studies, he didn\u2019t disturb Lin Chuhan.They had been table buddies for more than a year, and Lin Chuhan\u2019s results remained the same. She was always number one, never dropping in rank.Also, because of Wang Teng, many male students didn\u2019t dare to disturb Lin Chuhan. This gave her a quiet learning environment.Who knew that this might be a blessing in disguise.Wang Teng looked at Lin Chuhan, and a memory floated into his mind.He was just starting his year three in high school.One night, Wang Shengguo suddenly told Wang Teng proudly, \u201cSon, I gave some gifts to your headteacher so that he will arrange the best student to sit beside you. You should learn from her properly.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Don\u2019t bully the young lady. If I know, I will break your leg. Do you understand!\u201dWang Teng was frozen on the spot when he heard this piece of news.Especially when he saw Old Wang\u2019s proud expression, he felt speechless.You placed the prettiest lady in school beside me, but you don\u2019t allow me to touch her. Are you my biological father?This is too cruel!Despite complaining, Wang Teng didn\u2019t dare disobey Wang Shengguo. Hence, he remained as Lin Chuhan\u2019s obedient and good table buddy for a year.3O(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o\u20261Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The prettiest young lady in school was right in front of him, yet he couldn\u2019t touch her. It felt highly frustrating.3After they graduated from senior high, Lin Chuhan went to the Capital Xia and studied at the First Capital University.After that, he heard that she went overseas to further her studies and came back three years later. At that time, she displayed exceptional business talent and built a huge franchise all over the country within a few years. Her company was looking to go international. She became a powerful boss in the business world in that era and became an amazing person.He recalled her life and looked back at his\u2026He felt like a salted fish lying in front of a whale, a salted fish that laid in front of her for an entire year.Wang Teng lowered his gaze and looked at Lin Chuhan\u2019s lean legs. He had the urge to go forward and hug them tightly.2These beautiful legs felt as though they were encased in gold.Honestly speaking, this young lady\u2019s figure was perfect.Lin Chuhan was reciting her textbook when she suddenly felt an intense gaze landing on her legs. She frowned uncontrollably.\u201cHmph!\u201dA snort woke Wang Teng up from his daze.Wang Teng looked at Lin Chuhan\u2019s cold face and touched his nose. He laughed softly and retracted his gaze.\u201cWhy is he still laughing? This fellow is so irritating,\u201d Lin Chuhan muttered softly to herself.Wang Teng shook his head. He had experienced two lifetimes, but he was still so easily distracted. That was embarrassing.3He took out his phone and planned to look up information regarding the university entrance exam.What Wang Shengguo said in the morning had made him see the university entrance exam in a new light.Wang Teng always thought that after he became a martial warrior, his status would be different. He wouldn\u2019t need to participate in the university entrance exam.He didn\u2019t know that there were so many things he had to do and understand even after he became a martial warrior.Fortunately, Wang Shengguo had reminded him in time. If not, he might have missed the university entrance exam this year.He searched casually, and a whole bunch of information on the university entrance exam jumped out.It had to be said this world and the world in his past life had some minor differences. If you didn\u2019t look at it carefully, you wouldn\u2019t be able to find them.For instance, this planet wasn\u2019t named Earth. It was called the Earth Star instead.2For instance, their country was called Huaxia (an ancient name for China), and the capital was called Capital University. The First Capital University was a university situated in the Capital.8Donghai was similar to Shanghai. Donghai University and Capital Xia University were both top universities in the country.The time of the university entrance exam had changed too, from June to the 5th of July. That was because this was the day martial arts started gaining popularity in public.Today, the martial arts examination was the most crucial part of the university entrance exam. So, the test was held on this special day with a special meaning.Wang Teng did more research on the registration for the martial arts course.The martial arts examination was very different from the routine examination.Martial arts wasn\u2019t just about testing your language, mathematics, English, and Science. It included the human anatomy, the history of martial arts, spirit herbs studies, mineralogy, and other various bits and pieces.The Ministry of Education had compiled all these bits of knowledge into a book called \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019.Anyone that wanted to take the martial arts course would get one copy of this book.Wang Teng looked at the name with a weird expression. He wondered if he should get his hands on one too. After thinking for a moment, he decided to give up.1It was impossible for him to learn everything. He had to rely on picking up attributes.2There were five advanced stage martial disciples in Donghai No. 1 High School. They would definitely take the martial arts examination, and they would have most likely studied the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019.He could find time to visit them and pick up some attributes. This way, Wang Teng could collate more points for the proficiency of the \u201dFive Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019.If that wasn\u2019t enough, there were other students from other schools taking the martial arts course. He could look for them and collect some bubbles.Wang Teng came up with a good plan.\u201cThis fellow came so early, but he\u2019s actually playing with his phone.\u201dWhen Lin Chuhan saw Wang Teng fiddling with his phone the entire morning, she frowned again. She said in a low voice, \u201cWang Teng, come out with me for a moment.\u201dAfter dropping her words, she stood up directly and walked out of the classroom.Wang Teng was still pondering over the martial arts examination, so he was at a loss when he heard Lin Chuhan.But as he looked at the other party\u2019s back as she walked out of the classroom, he got up and followed her.Forget it, since you\u2019re pretty, I will give you some response!Wang Teng kept his phone and placed his hands in his pocket. He casually walked out of the class and saw Lin Chuhan waiting for him around a corner.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Class Monitor Lin?\u201d Wang Teng looked at the beautiful face in front of him and asked.\u201cWang Teng, there\u2019s less than a month until the university entrance exam. Why are you still playing every day? Are you not planning to take the university entrance exam?\u201d Lin Chuhan asked with a cold expression.\u201cEven you know that there\u2019s only less than a month until the examination. What\u2019s the point of working hard now?\u201d Wang Teng said in a joking manner.2Wang Teng\u2019s nonchalant tone made Lin Chuhan unhappy.Her brows furrowed. In the end, she controlled her temper and said, \u201cI have some notes. Although there\u2019s less than a month, if you work hard, you might be able to score some points in the entrance exam. Your family background is good. It shouldn\u2019t be difficult for you to get into a good university.\u201d\u201cClass Monitor Lin, why are you so concerned about me?\u201d Wang Teng suddenly asked.\u201cDon\u2019t think too highly of yourself,\u201d Lin Chuhan replied without any expressions.What do you mean by I care about you? How can there be someone so shameless?\u201cWhy are you worried about my university entrance exam then?\u201d Wang Teng continued asking.\u201cThe headteacher let you sit beside me because he wants me to help you with your studies. It\u2019s alright if you didn\u2019t listen to me in the past. However, the university entrance exam is coming, so I\u2019m reminding you sincerely one last time,\u201d Lin Chuhan explained.\u201cAny explanation is a cover-up,\u201d Wang Teng teased her.2\u201cI\u2026\u201d Lin Chuhan was stunned by his shamelessness. She didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment. She continued in frustration, \u201cI\u2019m persuading you because we are table buddies. You can choose whether you want to listen to me or not. If you can\u2019t enter university, it has nothing to do with me.\u201dShe turned around and wanted to go back to the classroom. However, she didn\u2019t see the broom that had fallen on the ground because of her brisk pace. She tripped over the broom and staggered.2Oh shit, there\u2019s nothing for me to hold onto.Lin Chuhan had a huge shock. But the next second, she felt someone hugging her body.Wang Teng had noticed the strange feeling in his hand too. He froze for a moment.\u201cHurry up and let go!\u201dLin Chuhan wanted to cry.\u201cDo you really want me to let go?\u201d said Wang Teng.\u201cLet go!\u201d Lin Chuhan said firmly.\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Then, Wang Teng released his grip\u2026He let go of his hand\u2026\u201cAhh!\u201d Lin Chuhan fell with her face landing flat on the ground.\u201cClass monitor, you were the one who asked me to let go,\u201d Wang Teng said honestly.2Lin Chuhan raised one hand from the ground and pointed at Wang Teng. Her finger kept trembling.\u201cErm\u2026 are you alright?\u201d Wang Teng bent down beside her and asked carefully.Lin Chuhan raised her head. Her hair was in a mess, and her exquisite nose, as well as her forehead, was entirely red.She looked so hopeless!\u201cWang Teng, you bastard!\u201dShe got up from the ground and ran away without turning back.She felt so embarrassed!Wang Teng looked at Lin Chuhan\u2019s back view as she ran further and further away. His expression was a little awkward. Did he do something wrong?16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He remembered that at that time, she would always persuade him in hopes that he would suddenly get enlightened and study hard.Unfortunately, in his past life, he never turned back. He walked along the path of darkness right to the end.After that, the two of them parted and never met again. It was really regretful.This lady left her mark in his memory in the past. This lifetime, he didn\u2019t want to miss her!2\u2026When Wang Teng went back, almost the entire class had arrived. As a result, more attribute bubbles had fallen to the ground.Wang Teng walked around the classroom under his classmates\u2019 puzzled gazes and picked up all the attribute bubbles.1English*9Language*12Biology*152\u2026\u201cWhat is this Young Master Wang doing?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Maybe he\u2019s taking a stroll.\u201d1\u201cTaking a stroll?\u201d\u201cWhy do you care about what he\u2019s doing? He\u2019s a rich second generation. His thinking is not on the same level as us.\u201d\u201cHis train of thoughts is really peculiar!\u201dThe meddlesome students couldn\u2019t help but lower their voices and discuss among themselves. All the while, they had strange expressions on their faces.1When Wang Teng turned around and looked at them, their voices disappeared. They all sat there seriously and pretended to be studying hard.Wang Teng pouted as he sat down on his seat.Lin Chuhan wasn\u2019t in her seat. No one knew where she went.She only walked into the classroom when the school bell signaling the start of the morning lesson rang. She had a cold expression and didn\u2019t glance at Wang Teng at all.She sat on her seat as though there was just a ball of air beside her.Wang Teng smiled bitterly. He didn\u2019t dare to provoke her again.Lin Chuhan\u2019s personality was distant and cold. When she wore a chilly expression, she gave off an aura that seemed to forbid anyone to get close to her.\u201cThis young lady is really cold.\u201dDuring the morning lesson, Wang Teng flipped through his textbook aimlessly. He was bored to death.All the students were intensely revising the entire morning. Wang Teng had a fruitful morning too. He listened to the class and picked some attributes while at it.1His knowledge of his subjects increased exponentially. If he was to take a test now, he could get around 60 points.This was extremely frightening!Mind you, his past results only had one digit, and that was if he was lucky and chose the correct answer for the multiple-choice questions.3Lin Chuhan didn\u2019t want to interact with Wang Teng. However, since they were table buddies, she could see what Wang Teng was doing.She couldn\u2019t help but feel surprised.\u201cDid this fellow\u2019s character change suddenly? Why is he reading the textbook? Have my words borne fruit?1\u201cOr could it be that this bastard likes me?\u201d3Lin Chuhan had never been in a relationship, but she had chatted about guys with her female friends before. Also, she secretly read some romance novels.2In a novel, when a young man loved another young lady, he would take her words to heart and make changes for her. That was what all novels said. The guys always wanted to present a better self to the other party\u20262When she thought about what happened just now, she felt something strange in her heart.But, this fellow was still so irritating!He actually let go of her. Would he have died if he had held onto her? He was really a dumb young man.4As she thought about this, Lin Chuhan suddenly woke up in shock. She shook her head like a pellet drum, and her ears uncontrollably turned red.What kind of nonsense am I thinking about?There was a tremendous fight going on in Lin Chuhan\u2019s brain. All kinds of young girl\u2019s thoughts were jumbled up in her mind. Her whole face was so red that it felt as though she was in a steamer.Lin Chuhan\u2019s will might be stronger than her peers, but she was a young girl after all. She would naturally have this kind of thoughts about love.After some time, Lin Chuhan sighed quietly.It\u2019s all that fellow\u2019s fault. He\u2019s disturbing my peacefulness.Wang Teng noticed Lin Chuhan shaking her head frantically and then sighing for no reason. He felt confused.What is she doing?He couldn\u2019t help but open his mouth. \u201d Class Monitor Lin, the lesson has ended. Go and take your lunch break. Why don\u2019t I treat you? This is my apology for what happened this morning.\u201dLin Chuhan was flabbergasted. The next instant, she turned vigilant.Tricks! These are all tricks! This fellow has other intentions towards me!Wang Teng was dumbfounded.Why are you giving such a vigilant look?Other people might think that I\u2019m a human trafficker abducting people.3Lin Chuhan glared at Wang Teng and said coldly, \u201cI\u2019m not going.\u201dShe got up and took her bag after she finished speaking. Then, she ran out of the classroom as though something would happen if she stayed a moment longer with him.\u201cStrange!\u201d Wang Teng shook his head helplessly.Was he so scary?1He actually managed to make a young lady evade him as though he was a poisonous scorpion.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, let\u2019s go and eat!\u201d Xu Jie\u2019s voice came from outside the classroom at this moment.Wang Teng got up and walked out.Xu Jie was a year three student too. But, he was in class 12. He wasn\u2019t in the same class as Wang Teng.As for Bai Wei and Yu Hao, they were studying in year two in Donghai No. 1 High School. They were one year younger than the two of them.Usually, they wouldn\u2019t go home for lunch. Instead, they would finish their meals in the school cafeteria, or sometimes, they would go to a restaurant outside the school to eat.When Wang Teng and Xu Jie arrived at the cafeteria, it was already crowded. The noise could almost turn the roof upside down.At this moment, Xu Jie\u2019s WeChat notification rang.He took out his phone and looked at it. Then, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the second floor. Bai Wei and the rest are waiting for us there.\u201dThe second floor was more spacious than the first.When they reached the second floor, the air-conditioner was cold and icy, and there were not many people there. It wasn\u2019t crowded at all.The level of consumption on the second floor was much higher than on the first floor. Regular students wouldn\u2019t go there for their meals.The moment they came up, they scanned the cafeteria and saw Bai Wei and Yu Hao sitting on the seats to the right.The dishes were already prepared, still steaming hot. It was evident that they just came out of the stove not long ago.This was a unique feature of the second floor. Not only were the dishes exquisite and delicious, but they were also cooked on the spot.On the first floor, all the dishes were cooked beforehand and put into trays. The cafeteria aunties just had to scoop the dishes the students chose.The spoons they used to scoop the dishes were shared. After taking out one dish, they would use it to scoop another dish. Hence, all the different flavors were mixed, and it was a suffering to one\u2019s taste buds.4Have you tried the taste of mixing stir-fried tomato with egg, twice-cooked pork, fish-flavored eggplant, and\u2026?4Once you did, you would never want to try it again.1If you were a little late, you could only eat leftover dishes and rice. The dishes would be cold, and they were all vegetable stems and leftover gravy.The four of them chatted happily and ate at the same time.Halfway through their meal, Yu Hao suddenly pointed in a certain direction and asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t that Yuan Zhenghua?\u201dXu Jie and Bai Wei immediately looked in the direction of his finger.\u201cHey, it\u2019s really that brat!\u201d Xu Jie scoffed.\u201cThe pig-head beside him\u2026 is that Li Rongcheng?\u201d Bai Wei\u2019s eyes suddenly dropped wide open as she asked in confusion.\u201cWhat pig-head?\u201dXu Jie and Yu Hao were stunned at the same time. Then, they looked carefully.\u201cOh my god, haha, that\u2019s really Young Master Li Rongcheng. How did he become like this?\u201d The two of them were astounded. Then, they burst out laughing.\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201dThe moment Bai Wei started speaking, Xu Jie and Yu Hao abruptly thought of something. They looked at Wang Teng with a strange expression.When Wang Teng saw Li Rongcheng\u2019s appearance, he remembered that he seemed to have pushed some blame on this young man that night at the Wild Rose Pub. He coughed awkwardly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense if you don\u2019t have evidence.\u201d4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, she was having a hard time.At the end, when her friends burst out laughing, she couldn\u2019t control herself anymore and started laughing along with them.Li Rongcheng was in a bad mood during these past two days.Yesterday, he went to the Wild Rose Pub to play and hook up with two young working ladies. He wanted to bring them to a hotel and talk about life and ambitions.Just as he was about to succeed, a group of gangsters broke into the pub and started yelling.\u201cWho is Li Rongcheng? Come out if you dare!\u201dLi Rongcheng was extremely infuriated at that time. He stood up at once and scolded, \u201cI am Li Rongcheng. Who\u2019s your owner? Why didn\u2019t he put you on a leash? Why did he release you?\u201dThe group of gangsters was burning with anger, too, not caring about anything anymore. They rushed up and threw a sack over Li Rongcheng.Li Rongcheng probably never expected these people to be beginner stage or intermediate stage martial disciples.Although he was an advanced stage martial disciple, in front of an entire bunch of beginner stage and advanced stage martial disciples, he lost in numbers.Also, he didn\u2019t know that these people would start fighting directly, so he was caught off guard. At the same time, since he was inexperienced, he got controlled by them within a split second.This bunch of people knocked Li Rongcheng unconscious and brought him to a dilapidated warehouse.The sinister-looking youth, Zhao Gangbao, was waiting there. The instant he saw Li Rongcheng tied up, he asked his lackeys to beat him without even opening the sack.They only removed the sack after they vented their anger. When they took a careful look, they discovered this wasn\u2019t the right person!While the bunch of gangsters exchanged glances with one another. Zhao Gangbao started cursing in anger. Then, he vented all his rage on Li Rongcheng, again.Another round of beating that was too horrible to look at followed.During that time, Li Rongcheng was completely at a loss.Who am I? Where am I? Where am I going?Zhao Gangbao and his men left after they let out their anger, leaving Li Rongcheng lying on his back in the run-down warehouse. Tears of helplessness and injustice flowed down the corner of his eyes.From the start to the end, he didn\u2019t know what was happening.Slowly, he took out his phone with trembling hands and called 120. That was how he got sent to the hospital for emergency treatment.Fortunately, it was only external injuries. Li Rongcheng was an advanced stage martial disciple, so his physique was stronger than a normal person. He could recover faster.Hence, he was able to recover and came to school all alive and kicking today.But, there was still a ball of flame in his heart. Everyone was an eyesore to him.Morning ended amidst the students\u2019 strange expressions when they saw him. They wanted to laugh but didn\u2019t dare to.A few students who laughed secretly were beaten by him violently.He came to the cafeteria to have his meal, but the instant he went up to the second floor, he heard peals of laughter. The flame in his heart was ignited immediately.His face turned green with anger.\u201cDamn it! Why are you laughing!\u201d Li Rongcheng charged towards Wang Teng and his friends.Xu Jie wasn\u2019t an easy person to bully. He stood up and rebutted, \u201cMy mouth is on my body. Why is that any of your business?\u201dEveryone was clear of each other\u2019s background. The Li family was more powerful than the Xu family, but their families wouldn\u2019t be at loggerheads with each other just because of a conflict between two younger generations.Conflicts between the younger generation would be settled by the younger generation.This was a silent rule consented to by everyone.If the older generations got involved, they were throwing their dignity on the ground for others to trample on. They were all respected people; dignity was like life to them. They wouldn\u2019t lose it for such a small thing.In the past, Xu Jie might be a little afraid of Li Rongcheng, as he was an advanced stage martial disciple, but now, he wasn\u2019t scared. He had Wang Teng supporting him.\u201cXu Jie, you\u2019re getting bold. How dare you speak to me like this?\u201dLi Rongcheng laughed hideously and suddenly raised his fist, aimed for Xu Jie\u2019s face.Xu Jie felt depressed. Li Rongcheng didn\u2019t act according to the script!As rich second generations, shouldn\u2019t they hurl insults at each other first?Why was he raising his fist so quickly? Where did he throw his dignity as a rich second generation?He didn\u2019t know that Li Rongcheng was seething in anger the entire day. A little stimulation was enough to make him explode.The power of this fist wasn\u2019t small. The strong wind caused Xu Jie\u2019s cheeks to hurt. He believed that if this fist hit him, his nose would collapse entirely.\u201cI\u2019m gone!\u201dXu Jie closed his eyes instinctively.But, the pain he was anticipating didn\u2019t come. He opened his eyes a little. Through the small crack, he saw a hand firmly grabbing Li Rongcheng\u2019s wrist, stopping him from moving a single inch.\u201cYoung Master Li, anger is harmful to the body,\u201d Wang Teng said casually.\u201cWang Teng!\u201dLi Rongcheng was flabbergasted. Everyone knew that Wang Teng was hopeless in his studies, but he was actually displaying strong martial arts ability now.Yuan Zhenghua, who was standing beside Li Rongcheng, opened his eyes wide in surprise. He had a look of disbelief.In the past, he was Wang Teng\u2019s friend too.But as time went by, he tilted towards Li Rongcheng and cut ties with Wang Teng and his friends.Yuan Zhenghua had stayed beside Wang Teng for a long time. However, he never once realized that Wang Teng had such abilities.Xu Jie regained his senses and stood behind Wang Teng with lingering fear. Then, he glared at Yuan Zhenghua proudly to mock him for being blind.On the other side, Li Rongcheng struggled forcefully. He noticed that no matter how much force he used, Wang Teng\u2019s hand continued to hook firmly around his wrist like steel. He couldn\u2019t break free despite his best efforts.\u201cLet go of my hand!\u201dLi Rongcheng said fiercely. His face was green with anger.Wang Teng released his grip as asked.Li Rongcheng was still pulling himself back, so he landed on his butt.\u201cYoung Master Li, why are you so careless? Hurry and get up. The floor is cold,\u201d Wang Teng said in concern.\u201cYou!\u201dLi Rongcheng pointed at Wang Teng. He was so angry that he didn\u2019t know what to say.He climbed up from the ground and said furiously, \u201cWang Teng, I didn\u2019t expect you to hide your true power. No matter what the reason is, our grudge is formed today. Do you have the guts to have a duel with me?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Wang Teng retracted his smile and answered while looking into his eyes.\u201cOkay. When school ends in the afternoon, we will have a showdown at the stadium.\u201d Li Rongcheng turned around and walked down the stairs after he finished speaking.Yuan Zhenghua glanced at Wang Teng, but he didn\u2019t dare to exchange gazes with him. He hurriedly chased after Li Rongcheng.\u201cYoung Master Li, aren\u2019t we eating?\u201d\u201cEat your head. I\u2019m full from anger.\u201d\u2026After Li Rongcheng left, Bai Wei asked worriedly, \u201cBrother Wang Teng, are you really going to fight with him?\u201dBefore Wang Teng could reply, Yu Hao answered for him, \u201cThis is a martial arts duel. Since he agreed, he will definitely fight with him. This is the rule.\u201d\u201cLittle Mouse, what you said isn\u2019t right,\u201d Wang Teng suddenly smiled and said.Yu Hao gave him a puzzled look.Wang Teng continued explaining, \u201cRules are set by men. You can decide whether you want to abide by them or not. Just make sure that you don\u2019t go against your heart.\u201dYu Hao was a little clueless. He didn\u2019t understand Wang Teng.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, are you confident that you can beat Li Rongcheng?\u201d Xu Jie asked.\u201cWhy would I agree if I didn\u2019t?\u201d Wang Teng smiled and asked him back.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Don\u2019t worry. Let\u2019s sit down and have our meal. Then, we can go back and rest. We can talk about this when the time comes.\u201d\u201cWe will follow you to your duel after school ends,\u201d Bai Wei said.\u201cSure!\u201dThe three lessons in the afternoon were physics, math, and biology.Every lesson, the teacher and his classmates would drop many attribute bubbles. This allowed Wang Teng\u2019s study attributes to rise to another level.He wasn\u2019t bothered by Li Rongcheng\u2019s duel request at all. Instead, he continued doing what he was supposed to do.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFor the entire day, Wang Teng swam in the sea of knowledge until school ended at 5.30 pm. Even then, he was still yearning to learn more.He felt that in his past life, he was held up by his title as a rich second generation. If not, he would have definitely been a good student who loved studying.Fortunately, he still had a chance in this lifetime, even though he missed the opportunity in his previous life.From this day onwards, he must become a model student with all-rounded development in morality, intelligence, and physical education.When he thought about this, Wang Teng instantly felt the red towel in front of his chest became even brighter.After the school bell rang, all the students surged out of their classrooms. Wang Teng didn\u2019t pack his things up. Rather, he threw his textbooks in the drawer.Then, he met Xu Jie, Bai Wei, and Yu Hao.The four of them went to the stadium together.Wang Teng was relaxed and didn\u2019t show any hint of worry. On the contrary, Xu Jie, Bai Wei, and Yu Hao kept exchanging glances with one another. They hesitated to speak to Wang Teng.Bai Wei plucked up her courage and smiled at Wang Teng. She said, \u201cBrother Wang Teng, shall we have a meal first? You will only have the strength to fight if you fill up your stomach.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, why don\u2019t we have some food first?\u201d\u201cLi Rongcheng has a lot of spare time. You can let him wait for a while longer.\u201d\u201cMaybe he\u2019s going for a meal too.\u201dXu Jie and Yu Hao nodded in agreement as they started convincing Wang Teng together.\u201c??\u201dWang Teng said in a helpless tone, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t exercise after eating. You will get gastroptosis.\u201d\u201cOops!\u201dThe three of them realized that they seemed to have made a stupid suggestion.\u201cAlright, there\u2019s no need to worry. Li Rongcheng is an advanced stage martial disciple, but he\u2019s not my match.\u201d Wang Teng could tell that they were worried about him, so he consoled them.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, are you also an advanced stage martial disciple instead of an intermediate stage martial disciple?\u201d Yu Hao asked in shock.Wang Teng nodded.The three of them were dumbstruck.An advanced stage martial disciple!Wang Teng was actually an advanced stage martial disciple!They knew that Wang Teng was a martial disciple, but being an advanced stage martial disciple and an intermediate stage martial disciple were two different concepts.An advanced stage martial disciple could apply for the martial arts course. They had a high probability of becoming a martial warrior in the future. At that time, the distance between them and Wang Teng would only grow bigger.This was beyond comprehension!They were peers, peers who were really familiar with one another. At first, they thought that all of them were the same, but the other party had soared up straight into the sky.They said that they would fail together, yet he secretly became better.Complex emotions instantly sprung up in their hearts.After some time, the four of them arrived at the stadium.Every school viewed students who practiced martial arts with high importance. In order to provide a training ground for them, they especially emptied a floor in the stadium.Stadium, second floor.Li Rongcheng was leaning against the wall with his arms crossed in front of him. He looked impatient from the wait.Yuan Zhenghua was standing beside him with water and towels in hand. He really looked like he was currying favor with Li Rongcheng.Xu Jie felt his blood boiling with anger when he saw Yuan Zhenghua\u2019s actions.Why did this fellow choose to be another person\u2019s dog when he could be a human?\u201cYou finally came.\u201d Li Rongcheng turned his head and squinted slightly as he glared at Wang Teng.\u201cYoung Master Li, you\u2019re really early. Did you skip class?\u201d Wang Teng mocked.\u201cDon\u2019t bullshit with me. I\u2019m using a blade. What\u2019s your weapon? You can choose one,\u201d Li Rongcheng replied impatiently.\u201cI will use a blade too!\u201dWang Teng walked to the side and took a standard blade from the weapons rack.The back of the blade wasn\u2019t thick, and it was relatively longer. It looked like the \u2018Tang Blade\u2019 in his past life.He weighed the blade and found it a little light. Wang Teng shook his head silently. It seemed like he needed to find some time to get himself a weapon.He would make do with what he had for now!Wang Teng held the blade and walked opposite Li Rongcheng.Xu Jie and Bai Wei\u2019s faces turned pale when they saw them using weapons. \u201cWhy are they using weapons? What if they get hurt?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think? This is a martial arts duel, not playing house,\u201d Yu Hao took a deep breath and said.This was what he said on the surface, but he had only become a beginner stage martial disciple not long ago. This was also his first time facing such a situation.\u201cWang Teng, you have good strength, so you have probably become an advanced stage martial disciple.\u201d\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m shocked. Everyone is mistaken about you. You hide very well.\u201d\u201cBut, who gave you the confidence to challenge me with a blade?\u201d Obviously, Li Rongcheng looked down on Wang Teng.He had started practicing martial arts ever since he was 15 years old. He became an advanced stage martial disciple in three years. During these three years, he only practiced his blade skills, advancing it to the big achievement state.Thus, he had the right to be arrogant.He also found it funny that Wang Teng dared to use a blade in front of him.\u201cLet\u2019s start.\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t say much and went directly to the point.\u201cSure!\u201d Li Rongcheng opened his eyes wide and shouted fiercely.He stomped his feet on the ground.\u201cBoom\u201dA dull and loud sound resounded in the hall. There seemed to be waves churning in the air. Due to the recoil of the force, his entire body flew towards Wang Teng like an arrow leaving its bow.In that split second, the ferocious aura appalled Yuan Zhenghua, Xu Jie, and the other two.However, Wang Teng, who was the first to bear the hit, showed no change in his expression.Li Rongcheng thought that he was shocked from fear, so he displayed even more contempt on his face.He raised his blade up high and struck it down in a simple move.Just as the long blade was about to touch Wang Teng\u2019s body, he shifted without any warning and appeared on Li Rongcheng\u2019s right.When his blade cut the air instead of flesh, Li Rongcheng\u2019s expression changed instantly. He forcefully twisted his body and slashed his blade at Wang Teng at 180 degrees.\u201cClang!\u201dThe two blades collided and let out sparks and metallic clangs.\u201cBang!\u201dAnother dull sound was heard. Before Li Rongcheng could figure out what the hell was going on, he felt a pain in the back of his head and lost consciousness.\u201cWeak, so weak!Wang Teng shook his head.Basic Blade Skill*20Strength*12He picked up the attribute bubbles Li Rongcheng had dropped and walked to the side to place the blade back.Yuan Zhenghua, Xu Jie, and the rest of the people finally regained their senses. They stared at Wang Teng with their mouths agape.The exchange between them looked simple, but the speed of advanced stage martial disciples was more than a little exaggerating. The four of them only saw everything in a blur.As the saying went, \u2018the insider knows the ropes, while the outsider just comes along for the ride\u2019.The four of them were purely watching the show. Even Yu Hao wasn\u2019t considered an \u2018insider\u2019.Hence, they didn\u2019t understand the battle, only feeling that Wang Teng was very powerful.Especially the time. It was too short!Was it three seconds or five?Li Rongcheng lost even before they could fight properly.They watched Wang Teng as he put back his weapon and walked over. He seemed to be muttering to himself, \u201cToo weak, why is he so weak? That\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201dThe four of them were rendered speechless.Li Rongcheng was a real advanced stage martial disciple. He was one of the top five most powerful students in Donghai No. 1 High School. Yet, Wang Teng said that he was weak!Brother, we are close friends. Do you have to act so arrogantly?But, this also indirectly showed how powerful Wang Teng was.Li Rongcheng wasn\u2019t weak among the students, but Wang Teng was stronger than him. In fact, he was much stronger.\u201cLet\u2019s go home and eat dinner.\u201dWang Teng called out to his three friends as he walked down the stairs.Xu Jie, Bai Wei, and Yu Hao hurriedly caught up to him. On the other side, Yuan Zhenghua was left standing alone on the same spot in a daze.He didn\u2019t dare to greet Wang Teng.This Wang Teng was unfamiliar to him. At the same time, he was frightening.In the past, Wang Teng didn\u2019t like studying. However, since his family background was better than his, Yuan Zhenghua didn\u2019t dare to offend him.Now, he felt fear towards Wang Teng personally.He had betrayed Wang Teng. Would he take it to heart? What if he came to find him for trouble one day when he wasn\u2019t in a good mood?The instant he thought of this, Yuan Zhenghua felt anxious. He looked at the unconscious Li Rongcheng on the ground. He didn\u2019t seem to be able to protect him.Regret filled up his heart immediately\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs they walked out of the stadium, the other three people were exceptionally excited. They never stopped talking on the way back.\u201cAmazing! You\u2019re so powerful!\u201d\u201cBrother Wang Teng, are advanced stage martial disciples all so powerful?\u201d\u201cTo a normal person, an advanced stage martial disciple is quite strong.\u201dWang Teng lit a cigarette and took a puff of it. He slowly breathed the smoke out and said in a calm tone.\u201cHaha, this is great. With you protecting us, no one will dare to bully us.\u201d Xu Jie laughed heartily.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, do you think I can be as strong as you in the future?\u201d Yu Hao clenched his fist secretly and asked with envy.1\u201cYou just need to practice hard. Becoming an advanced stage martial disciple won\u2019t be difficult for you,\u201d Wang Teng replied.Bai Wei walked beside them without saying anything. However, her gaze would land on Wang Teng occasionally. There was a small sweet smile appearing at the corner of her lips.4The group of four parted at the school gate and went back to their own homes.On the way, Wang Teng kept wondering why Li Rongcheng was so weak. He wasn\u2019t acting. He sincerely felt that Li Rongcheng was too weak.When he drove the car along the roads and looked at the other cars zooming past him, he suddenly got enlightened.Speed!Right, it was speed!Looking at all the martial arts in the world, only speed could never be defeated.13His speed was much faster than Li Rongcheng, so to him, his attacks looked slow.Li Rongcheng was so slow that Wang Teng only used two moves to knock him unconscious on the ground.The speed attribute on the attribute panel couldn\u2019t be perceived directly. Wang Teng kept picking up attributes and his points kept rising, but he had never tested his actual speed before.Today, his potential suddenly exploded, and Li Rongcheng did not even have a chance to retaliate.At night, Wang Teng finished his dinner at home and went to the Jixin Martial House for practice as well as to collect attributes.For the next few days, his life was calm and smooth.During the day, he would attend school and go for lessons. He collected attributes to upgrade his studies and occasionally teased his beautiful but cold table buddy. He had a great time.After these few days, his studies had improved tremendously. If he took an exam now, he was confident that he could get 90 points.This level was enough for him. He wasn\u2019t planning to become the top scorer in the standard exam. Also, this was already a huge leap from his past results.1At night, he would sign in at the Jixin Martial House for training and collect attributes to raise his martial arts cultivation.Now, all his martial arts attributes had broken through the limit of a martial disciple.Enlightenment: 514Physique:121Strength:13563Speed: 632Battle Techniques: Basic Fist Skill (mastery), Basic Footwork (mastery), Basic Sword Skill (mastery), Basic Blade Skill (mastery)7Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks)1The limit for the physique of an advanced stage martial disciple was 100. The limit of strength was 1000kg and 100 meters in four seconds for speed.All his attributes had far surpassed those limits.Some time ago, he had specifically tested his speed and realized that he could run 100 meters in two seconds. This was much faster than the advanced stage martial disciples.4It might only be a two seconds difference, but many people might not be able to cross this hurdle even after three to five years.1Think about how hard it was to break the 100 meters sprint record for the Olympics. This was proof of its difficulty.In addition to his mastery in Basic Footwork, if Wang Teng was to meet another advanced stage martial disciple, he would dominate them without a doubt.Getting to here, there was a need to emphasize the fact that all of Wang Teng\u2019s battle techniques had reached mastery state.What was mastery?As its name suggested, it was mastery to the smallest detail of the technique. It was a state above the perfected state.2What kind of power did a mastery state battle technique possess?A simple example would make it clear.If a person was attacked and he had reached the perfected state of Basic Footwork, he would need to move more than half a meter to evade the attack.If the person had reached the mastery state of Basic Footwork, he would be able to remain unscathed by maneuvering close to the attacker. The distance between the two would be no more than a few centimeters.Hence, the difference between the two states could only be depicted clearly during an actual battle.One could say that Wang Teng\u2019s current ability was only a step away from an official martial warrior.Once he started cultivating the Force, he would become a real martial warrior.6\u2026On Friday, after the lesson ended, Wang Teng went back home as per usual.He drove his car along the road and looked at the scenery outside the car window. Yet, in his heart, he was pondering how he could get a Force cultivation skill scripture.His current stage was known as a prospective martial warrior. Once he started cultivating the Force, his status would change.But, the Force skill scripture was different from the foundation battle techniques and aerobics that any martial disciple or average person could practice.The imparting of Force skill scriptures had always been tightly regulated.1One could pass the martial arts exam and learn it in universities. This was the path with the most freedom.Another way was to apply for a prospective martial warrior exam at martial arts academies. Once he passed and the academy found nothing wrong with his background, they would impart their Force skill scriptures to him.This way, he would become a martial warrior of the martial arts academy. He would be on the same boat as the martial arts academy.The last method was to become a vassal of some powerful family. If you were able to gain the other party\u2019s trust, they might impart their Force skill scriptures to you. However, this was equivalent to selling your life.1The martial arts exam was after the university entrance exam. Furthermore, he had to wait until he entered the university to learn the skill scriptures. It took too long. Wang Teng didn\u2019t consider this option.Should he go to the martial arts academy to become a prospective martial warrior?No way, no way!Wang Teng\u2019s family knew his progress. He had only started practicing martial arts not long ago, and yet, he was already on the way to becoming a martial warrior. If unscrupulous people laid their eyes on him, things would turn troublesome.Then\u2026 should he become a vassal for other martial warrior families?Forget it. He was still a rich second generation. He would be lowering his status if he became other people\u2019s lackey.Bang!As he was pondering to himself, he heard a loud explosion in front of him.A great cloud of smoke was billowing out in front of him.The intersection in front of him was jammed for some reason, and the car ahead braked abruptly. It looked like there was a rear-end collision.Wang Teng\u2019s reaction was swift. He immediately stepped on the brake. However, the distance was too near, so the car still jerked forward due to inertia.\u201cBoom!\u201d He knocked into the boot of the car.Beep, beep, beep!Ring, ring, ring!In an instant, the honking of the cars and the sirens of the police cars intertwined together.The scene was messy and chaotic. This part of the road was completely paralyzed.Wang Teng frowned. He had no choice but to get out of his car to look at what had happened.He needed to go back home for dinner.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\u201cOh my god, what\u2019s going on? The car is wrecked!\u201dThe drivers stuck their heads out of their cars and started cursing.Bang! Bang! Bang!Right then, a few more loud sounds stunned the scene into silence in a blink of an eye.\u201cGunshots!\u201dWang Teng was astounded. \u201cI\u2019m sure I didn\u2019t hear wrong. That was definitely gunshots!\u201dRobbery in daylight?Riot?Or was it kidnapping?All kinds of thoughts flashed through Wang Teng\u2019s mind. Suddenly, he saw a few people dashing over.Based on their speed, they must be martial disciples!Wang Teng made his judgment in his mind. Then, he hurriedly shifted to the side. He didn\u2019t know what was happening, so it was better to mind his own business.He wanted to step away, but unfortunately, it didn\u2019t mean that troubles wouldn\u2019t look for him.When these people ran past him, the one with a scar on his face suddenly shouted, \u201cWait!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d his companions asked him in a hurry.\u201cThe police are arriving soon. We\u2019re too passive if we run like this. We should kidnap a hostage so that we can negotiate with them.\u201dThe man wanted to grab Wang Teng as he spoke.Just as Wang Teng was about to resist, the man with a scar on his face raised a gun with his other hand and aimed it at his head. \u201cBe obedient. If not, I will shoot you!\u201dHe was on tenterhooks!The intense aura of death caused Wang Teng\u2019s mind to explode, and the blood in his body started flowing furiously. His heart stopped beating for a split second. Then, it started palpitating.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDanger!Extreme danger!Although this was Wang Teng\u2019s second lifetime, it was the first time someone was pointing a gun directly at his head.In the face of life and death, the fear was terrifying.He was reborn, but he hadn\u2019t experienced an actual death before. Back then, he felt that he just woke up from a deep sleep.It was nothing compared to the situation now.The black muzzle felt like a terrifying huge beast opening its mouth. Inside, it was hell, and it felt eerie. The beast seemed to be waiting to swallow him whole.Terrifying! Horrifying!Immediately, Wang Teng\u2019s body froze, and his soul trembled uncontrollably.Even though he was practicing martial arts, he was still a normal person. He had never met such a situation before.Also, at such a close distance, he could clearly see the silver patterns on the body of the pistol.They were Force runes!This was a Force rune gun. It was a deadly threat to advanced stage martial disciples, as well as martial warriors.Hence, even though he had reached the speed of 50 meters per second and his footwork was at the mastery stage, he didn\u2019t dare to move when there was a Force rune gun pointing at his head.\u201cDamn it!\u201dWang Teng cursed in his heart. Then, he instantly gave in.He gave in within a split second!He gave up without any hesitation.\u201cDon\u2019t shoot. I will cooperate with you.\u201dWang Teng said in a hurry. He was afraid that the other part would kill him out of pure unhappiness.He had no choice but to be a coward.This was too frightening. He couldn\u2019t help but tremble in fear.\u201cBe obedient. Don\u2019t think of playing any tricks. If you do, I will let you have a taste of this gun.\u201dThe man with a scar on his face pushed Wang Teng and threatened.Thus, Wang Teng was forced to join their escape gang.He observed them secretly. There were a total of five people in this group, and they all had Force rune guns in their hands. From their aura, they were at least intermediate stage martial disciples.When Wang Teng\u2019s gaze swept past three of them, he paused instinctively.Each one of them was carrying a huge bag that was stuffed to the brim. The zip wasn\u2019t closed properly, so one could faintly see the notes inside.Could it be that they\u2026 robbed a bank?I remember that there is a bank not far away in front\u2026Wang Teng suddenly felt that his situation wasn\u2019t good. He seemed to have gotten involved in a troublesome matter.Does this mean that they were just passing by and I accidentally became their hostage?Wang Teng was a little speechless, feeling innocent and unlucky. He was able to meet robbers on his way home!Meeting them was alright. Why did they choose him as their hostage when there were so many others around?Were they bullying him?He didn\u2019t know that the man with a scar on his face chose him because he was driving a sports car. A rich second generation definitely had a higher status than an average person. Hence, he took Wang Teng as his hostage.Wang Teng was forced into a small alley as the robbers seized him by his arm. Then, he kept running and making turns in the alley, losing his sense of direction. He didn\u2019t know how long he ran.He pretended that he was extremely weak and started panting heavily after running for a short time.\u201cDamn it, this rich second generation must have slept with too many women. Look at how weak he is.\u201dOne of the robbers cursed Wang Teng. He was probably envious, jealous, or just didn\u2019t like Wang Teng.\u201cShall we kill him directly? Bringing him along will be a hindrance,\u201d another robber wearing a cap said ruthlessly.What the f**k!Wang Teng\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he heard this.This person was so cold-blooded. He only ran a little slower, yet he already wanted to kill him. Did he have to be so cruel?\u201cDon\u2019t kill me. I can run. I will definitely keep up with you,\u201d Wang Teng said frantically.\u201cForget it. We have already come this far with him. It\u2019s just a few more meters. Everything will be fine once we get in the car,\u201d the leader of the robbers replied.The few of them ran for another ten minutes. Wang Teng appeared exhausted, but he still managed to keep up with them.A white van was parked at the side of an old street. One robber pulled the car door open and stuffed Wang Teng inside. The engine of the van started with a loud roar.The van drove in the city at high speed.Suddenly, the police siren was heard behind them.\u201cF**k, the police have caught up with us.\u201d The robber, who was driving, slapped the steering wheel and stepped heavily on the accelerator. The van charged forward.\u201cThe van in front, listen. Stop at the side of the road immediately. Stop at the side of the road immediately\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must be kidding!\u201dThe driver stuck his hand out of the car and gave the cars behind his middle finger.\u201cTo the right. Go up the highway,\u201d the leader of the robbers said calmly.The driver turned the steering wheel.The head turned sharply as the van\u2019s boot skidded for a distance, creating a long mark on the ground. Then, it started flying towards the right.The police car in front overshot by a huge distance before it managed to stop. It turned and started chasing the van.Hence, the police car and the van started their cat and mouse game on the highway.During the chase, many cars collided with one another, causing traffic congestions. Drivers with road rage symptoms stuck their heads out to curse.\u201cCalling the van in front. If you don\u2019t stop your car now, we will open fire!\u201dThe robbers turned a deaf ear to the police.Bang!A gunshot was heard immediately thereafter. However, it was fired at the sky. Since there were too many people in the city, the police didn\u2019t dare to fire randomly.1This gunshot was purely to scare the robbers!But, the robbers weren\u2019t easy to deal with. The more you tried to scare them, the more vicious they would get.The man with a scar on his face pushed his gun against Wang Teng and stuck his head out of the car. He shouted fiercely, \u201cIf you dare to shoot, I will kill him first!\u201dWang Teng felt like a puppet.He felt weak and helpless!As the van sped along the highway, the wind blew against his hair, causing his mind to be in a mess.Who on earth did I provoke?Wang Teng asked the heavens helplessly.As expected, the police behind decided to spare the rat to save the dishes. They didn\u2019t dare fire anymore. After seeing their actions, the man with a scar on his face pulled Wang Teng back into the car.He proudly said to the other robbers, \u201cLook, this is the benefits of having a hostage.\u201d\u201cYou did well!\u201dThe leader wasn\u2019t stingy with his compliments.Wang Teng rolled his eyes while silently ridiculing them in his heart.\u00a0You are really smart!Unfortunately, it was too early for them to feel happy!More than ten police cars were chasing, obstructing, and intercepting the robbers\u2019 van. The robbers had underestimated the determination of the police. Although they were crafty, they were still stopped in front of an office building.\u201cF**k, we are just taking some money to spend. Do they have to chase us so fervently?\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d the leader of the robbers shouted with a cold expression.They had no choice but to alight the van. Then, they retreated into the office building while dragging Wang Teng along.\u201cYou have been surrounded from all sides. I repeat, you are surrounded. Hurry up. Lay down your arms and surrender\u2026\u201d This sentence kept coming out from the police\u2019s loudspeaker.The robbers ignored them and dashed into the office building.It was after-work timing, so most people had already left the office. No one could be seen in the lobby.The robbers went up to the third floor, probably wanting to occupy the high ground.3The third floor belonged to a fashion design company. There were still a few professionals working overtime inside, and most of them were ladies.The robbers kicked the door open and charged inside.Bang!One of them fired a shot to take control of the scene.His scare tactics made the scene even rowdier. The shouts of the anger of the office ladies turned into screams of terror.The leader of the robbers aimed his muzzle at a middle-aged lady and pulled the trigger. The other party\u2019s thigh got hit, and she screamed in pain.The middle-aged lady looked like someone with a high status in the company.Before the robbers broke in, she was reprimanding her subordinates. But in a blink of an eye, everything turned tragic.The other office ladies shrieked when they saw blood. Some of their voices even broke.\u201cShut up! I will kill anyone who makes another sound,\u201d the leader warned coldly.The office ladies quickly covered their mouths in unplanned unison. They were afraid that if they made a sound and stood out, the robbers would kill them.The middle-aged lady, who was shot, forcefully resisted the urge to make any sounds due to the pain.Cold sweat could be seen all over her forehead.Wang Teng frowned. This bunch of robbers was outrageous and ruthless. They didn\u2019t care about human life at all. This was too crazy.\u201cGo to the corner and squat down with your hands over your head. If anyone dares to create trouble, my gun might accidentally fire at you.\u201dA robber waved his gun and signaled everyone to squat in a corner.However, Wang Teng wasn\u2019t so lucky as he was pushed to the window.He looked down and saw around twenty police cars surrounding the office building. Many police officers had their guns raised at the windows of the building.\u201cLeader, what should we do?\u201d The man with a scar on his face asked furiously.The leader didn\u2019t bother to reply with words. Instead, he fired a shot straight at the police. The police officers hurriedly hide behind their shields or cars.\u201cListen, prepare a helicopter for us within an hour. If we don\u2019t see the helicopter one minute after the allocated time, we will kill one hostage. If two minutes pass, we will kill two hostages\u2026 We will kill until everyone here dies!\u201dThe police weren\u2019t the only ones who had heard his words. Wang Teng and the other hostages in the building heard him too.The employees of the fashion design company turned pale with fear. As the first hostage, Wang Teng\u2019s heart was raised to his throat, and his face turned black.But\u2026These five robbers had five Force rune guns with them. He wasn\u2019t confident he could deal with them.He could only place his hope in the police. He prayed that they would be able to prepare the helicopter in time.\u2026Time continued to pass slowly. One hour had almost passed.However, there was no helicopter.The hostages had looks of despair on their faces.\u201cIt\u2019s almost one minute past the allocated time. If the helicopter doesn\u2019t come soon, you are forcing us to kill a hostage,\u201d the leader shouted at the police cars below.\u201cDon\u2019t act rashly. The helicopter is on the way. It will arrive soon.\u201d The person-in-charge below was perspiring profusely because of anxiety as he used the loudspeaker to reply to the robbers.The leader didn\u2019t say anything. From his reaction, he didn\u2019t seem to care about the reason. As long as the time exceeded the deadline, he would kill someone.One minute passed in a blink of an eye.\u201cBrat, you, come over!\u201d The leader of the robbers pointed at Wang Teng.\u201cIt\u2019s too bad. You are unlucky!\u201dThe man with a scar on his face gave a hideous smile. He pushed Wang Teng towards his leader.Wang Teng sighed. He felt that he didn\u2019t look at the almanac before he left his house this morning. This must be why he was so unlucky today.Initially, he thought that if he acted as an obedient hostage, the robbers would let him go after achieving their goal. But, from the looks of it now, he was too naive.I can\u2019t just wait for death!There is no route of retreat now. They want to kill me, but I don\u2019t want to die. I\u2019m still young and I was given a chance to be reborn. How can I die here?I can\u2019t let that happen!No one can kill me. My new life is just starting. I have many regrets to make up for and many things I want to do\u2026 This lifetime, I need to be filial to my parents. I have to become a martial arts warrior and make them proud. I also want to see how the Xingwu Continent looks like\u2026I don\u2019t want to die\u2026I don\u2019t want to die. Thus, I have to kill them!3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A cute and handsome rich second generation like him must protect himself properly when he was outside.1The outside world was too dangerous!His life could be in peril at any moment.Wang Teng walked towards the leader of the robbers step by step. His whole body was trembling with excitement\u2026\u00a0Kill them. I must kill them. They are all extremely wicked and evil people!One step!Two steps!As he got closer and closer, the other hostages looked at him with compassion in their eyes.They felt pity for him, but at the same time, there was a hint of relief in their gazes. They felt glad that they weren\u2019t the first to get killed.They were shivering in fear too.This bunch of robbers wasn\u2019t even willing to let off such a cute young boy. There was no limit to their cruelness. Why hadn\u2019t the police\u2019s helicopter arrived?They would be the ones getting killed if it didn\u2019t come soon!Kill them!Kill them!Wang Teng almost had a mental breakdown. He was extremely nervous. His palm, back, and forehead were drenched with perspiration.There was no other way beside killing them!Three steps, four steps\u2026 very soon, he was less than half a meter away from the leader.\u201cHurry up and come over!\u201d shouted the leader impatiently.Enough!This is close enough!I can\u2019t wait anymore.Wang Teng raised his head abruptly. His eyes were bloodshot.\u201cWhy do you have to force me?\u201d2\u201c??\u201dThe leader of the robbers felt that Wang Teng had probably lost his mind in the face of fear, hence his nonsense.But, the next instant, the eyes of the robbers and the hostages widened in surprise.The leader of the robbers looked as though he had seen a ghost!What did he see?A moment ago, this hostage was still acting like a little lamb. The next second, he turned into a crazy fierce bear.His aura transformed in an instant!\u201cI\u2026\u201dEverything felt slow, but it just took an instant.When Wang Teng raised his head, there was no hesitation in his mind. His decision was firm and resolute as he stomped his feet heavily.Boom!The ceramic tiles on the ground shattered, and stone shards flew everywhere.The force exploded below his feet, pushing Wang Teng out abruptly. He shot out like an arrow from a bow and arrived in front of the leader within a split second.It was a result of extreme speed and mastery stage footwork.Wang Teng crossed the distance of half a meter within a blink of an eye.3Even though the leader of the robbers could see him, he wasn\u2019t able to react in time.Wang Teng\u2019s fist was like a hammer pounding the iron as he raised it high and punched it down. His fist became bigger and bigger in the robber\u2019s eyes, shocking him senseless.\u201c\u2026F**k!\u201dThe second he spoke the word, Wang Teng\u2019s full force attack had already landed on his head.Bang!The power of more than a thousand kilograms was extremely frightening!It probably felt like a lorry driving past your head!Bang!The sound was crisp, as if a watermelon was crushed!First blood!It got crushed\u2026However, Wang Teng didn\u2019t have any extreme feelings. At the moment, he was only thinking about the threat to his life. He killed one enemy yet, and there were still four left!They had guns. They were too scary!He must finish this battle as soon as possible.Hence, he didn\u2019t stop for a single second.He grabbed the leader\u2019s corpse tightly and smashed it at the robber standing behind with a scar on his face.At the same time, Wang Teng dashed forward. His mind was churning furiously. All the basic battle techniques he had learned so far seemed to be integrating into one whole.Footwork was merged with speed.Sword skills and blade skills were merged into the fists skills.He didn\u2019t have any weapons in his hand, so he used his fists as the sword and his legs as the blade.The robber with a scar on his face was in a flurry when his leader\u2019s corpse smashed into him. Wang Teng swept his leg from the left like a blade.Crack!The sound of bones cracking spooked the onlookers!Boom!The man shot out horizontally and slammed into the wall like a ragdoll. He spat a mouthful of blood before his head tilted to the side. The guy was deader than dead.2Double kill!Bang! Bang! Bang!The other three bandits panicked. But, they finally regained their senses and fired at Wang Teng.The runes-reinforced bullets poured out of the guns, halting Wang Teng\u2019s advance. These bullets were faster and more powerful.Swoosh!The bullets tore through the air, bringing along a shrill screech with them as they charged towards the vital spots on Wang Teng\u2019s body.His head, heart, thigh\u20262Wang Teng was well-prepared. After he got rid of the man with a scar on the face, he shrunk his body\u2026And did a perfect roll on the ground!2In one smooth motion, he hid under the office desk.Bang!The bullets hit the wall and blasted a huge hole in it.When Wang Teng glanced at the hole, a lingering fear washed over him. He felt fortunate that he hadn\u2019t rashly resisted the robbers at the start.Based on how powerful these bullets were, they would definitely bore a bloody hole in his body. Even if he had an advanced stage martial disciple\u2019s physique, he wasn\u2019t bulletproof.This thought only stayed in his mind for a split second. Then, he immediately grabbed the chair in front of him and threw it out. At the same time, he dashed out in the other direction.The three robbers were extremely tense. When they saw something flying out, they instinctively fired multiple shots in that direction.\u201cOh shit!\u201dImmediately after, they knew that they were in trouble.Wang Teng didn\u2019t give them time to regret it. He charged towards them from the other side and shot his fist out like a cannon, firing it at a robber\u2019s temple.The robber staggered and fell on the ground with a thud.Triple kill!One more down.Then, he turned to a robber who was two meters away from him.Wang Teng remembered this person. He was the first one who wanted to kill him.Thus, he exerted more power in his attack. Wang Teng clutched his hands together and smashed them down like a sledgehammer. The poor guy flew three meters backward.Quadra kill!Bang! Bang!The last robber was the driver.By now, he had realized that Wang Teng was extremely fierce and vicious. His companions couldn\u2019t handle his attack at all. They were either dead or seriously injured.He was so frightened that he kept retreating. In his flurry, he fired a few shots at Wang Teng.Wang Teng dodged, dashed beside the robber, and landed a punch. This was the simplest sword stab from the Basic Sword Skill.One attack!Another attack!In the end, the final robber also fell to the floor.Penta kill!3All five robbers were taken care of. From the time Wang Teng started attacking to the end of the battle, less than one minute had elapsed.The hostages were all flabbergasted!Their jaws almost touched the ground, but no sound came out.The middle-aged woman, who was injured, seemed to have temporarily forgotten her pain. She stared at him in a daze.We are both hostages. Why are you so outstanding and fierce!We are supposed to shiver in fear together, but you killed the robbers instead. Are you a devil?\u201cPant, pant, pant!\u201dAfter the five robbers collapsed, Wang Teng was finally able to relax his taut nerves. He breathed in large mouthfuls of air.2Exhaustion!A feeling of overwhelming exhaustion flooded his body.This battle had only lasted less than a minute, but his state of mind was tense, as he had been dancing on the edge of life and death. The adrenaline rushed through his vessels, and his body operated at an unprecedented high. This was mentally and physically draining for him.\u201cWhy did you force me?\u201dWang Teng muttered to himself while scanning the room. Suddenly, his face turned pale.The horrifying state of the robbers made his stomach churn, and the stomach acid almost spurted out of his throat.He hurriedly turned his head away. Coincidentally, he met the gaze of the hostages.These people had looks of fear on their faces. They were pale too, and some were even vomiting in the corner.However, their gazes were a bit weird. They didn\u2019t seem to be looking at a kind and honest high school student\u2026Instead, they seemed to be looking at a perverted murderer!\u201cWill you believe me if I said I\u2019m a good person?\u201d asked Wang Teng sincerely.The hostages shook their heads in unplanned unison. Then, they reacted quickly and started nodding their heads frantically.However, their guilty expressions weren\u2019t convincing at all\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before this, he had called home and told his parents that he was having dinner with his classmates tonight.In actual fact, he was brought to the police station to record his statement.Fortunately, Wang Teng was a victim, so the police released him after they understood what had happened.The captain of the criminal police personally sent Wang Teng to the door. He passed a cigarette to him.\u201cWant one?\u201d4Wang Teng didn\u2019t stand on ceremony. He directly took the cigarette and placed it in his mouth.The two of them lit their cigarettes and started smoking in front of the police station.\u201cYou know how to smoke at such a young age,\u201d Yang Zhenchao smiled and teased Wang Teng.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about it.\u201dWang Teng sighed and shook his head.Yang Zhenchao didn\u2019t probe further. He dropped the casual attitude and said seriously, \u201cThose robbers fled from other cities to our Donghai City. They have committed many heinous crimes, and they are all wanted criminals.\u201cYou should be able to tell that they are all cruel and evil people. Their hands are stained with the blood of quite a few innocents.\u201cYou are getting rid of evil for the people by killing them. Hence, don\u2019t feel too pressured.\u201dWang Teng instantly felt much better.\u201cAs expected, they were bad people. If I wasn\u2019t forced into a corner, why would a model student like me with all-rounded development in morality, intelligence, and physical education retaliate so violently?\u201dYang Zhenchao: \u2026This brat seemed a little shameless.Yang Zhenchao felt that his concern was redundant. He said grumpily, \u201cAfter we finish the procedures on our side, we will reward you with a silk banner and the bounty.\u201d\u201cHuh? You are still going to give me a silk banner and bounty?\u201d Wang Teng was a little shocked. He hurriedly waved his hand and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\u201cReally? This gang of robbers has been on the wanted list for a long time, but no one managed to catch them. So, the bounty is extremely high. It\u2019s as much as 100 thousand!\u201d Yang Zhenchao thought that Wang Teng didn\u2019t know what he was rejecting, so he kindly explained to him.\u201cI really don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t lack the money,\u201d Wang Teng replied casually.\u201cYou don\u2019t lack the money?\u201d Yang Zhenchao was speechless. This brat was really arrogant.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I donate the bounty to your station? You are the servants of the citizens. That is hard work. You can take it as my way of saying thank you,\u201d said Wang Teng.1\u201cAllow me to represent the police and thank you on their behalf.\u201d Yang Zhenchao was filled with profound veneration.\u201cOh right, Captain Yang, before I was taken hostage, my car was abandoned in the middle of the road. Can you help me check if it was seized by the police?\u201dWang Teng suddenly remembered his sports car that was stuck in the traffic.\u201cOkay, I will make a call and ask.\u201dAfter the call connected, Yang Zhenchao spoke a few sentences. Then, he asked Wang Teng for his license plate number. The answer arrived very quickly.\u201cIt was indeed seized. Come, let me bring you over to collect your car,\u201d Yang Zhenchao hung up and said.\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Teng nodded and followed the guy.\u201cHonestly speaking, your attacks were a little ruthless.\u201dWhile walking, Yang Zhenchao suddenly turned and said to Wang Teng.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve encountered an issue like this. It looks like I really didn\u2019t know how to control my strength,\u201d Wang Teng said helplessly.\u201cCompared to you, my first time was very different. I almost failed miserably on an easy task. Luckily, a senior helped me.\u201d Yang Zhenchao was immersed in his memory.Then, he exclaimed, \u201cYou are so young, yet you are already an advanced stage martial disciple. You are stronger than me. I feel that within two years, you can become a martial warrior!\u201d\u201cCaptain Yang, you are praising me too much. I was just lucky.\u201d Wang Teng remained humble.After some time, the duo arrived at their destination. They were asked to sign some papers before collecting the car. Yang Zhenchao looked at the sports car in front of him and was rendered speechless.\u201cNo wonder you felt that the 100 thousand was nothing. You really don\u2019t need the money.\u201dWang Teng got into the car and waved at Yang Zhenchao.\u201cCaptain Yang, thank you for today. I need to go home now. If not, my parents will be worried.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I almost forgot that you\u2019re a high school student. Hurry up and go home.\u201d Yang Zhenchao nodded.\u2026A man around 30 years old came beside Yang Zhenchao, who was watching the sports car drive off in the distance. He asked, \u201cWhat is this young man\u2019s background? How is he able to make you send him off personally?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t come from anywhere. But, he\u2019s an advanced stage martial disciple. Today, he personally killed five criminals carrying rune guns, empty-handed,\u201d Yang Zhenchao replied.\u201cAdvanced stage martial disciple!\u201dThe man was astounded. \u201cHe\u2019s only around 17, right? Yet, he\u2019s already an advanced stage martial disciple. He even managed to kill five criminals with rune guns on them empty-handed. That\u2019s really powerful. Where did this genius come from?\u201d1\u201cWho knows? But\u2026 he\u2019s really amazing. I\u2019m afraid that when I meet him in the future, I can only look up to him,\u201d Yang Zhenchao also exclaimed.The man nodded his head in agreement.\u2026Wang Teng didn\u2019t know the discussion going on between the two people behind him. He drove his car and went directly to the Jixin Martial House.After he reached the martial arts academy, he directly headed to the second floor.Looking at the students practicing diligently in the training hall, his anxious nerves started to calm down.Wang Teng made a round around the hall and picked up the dropped attributes. He then walked in front of a sandbag and started practicing his fist skill.Bang, bang, bang!Wang Teng needed an avenue to let out his emotions. He needed to release the accumulated stress and pressure in his heart. Thus, he pounded the sandbag furiously. His arm formed a lingering shadow as he punched the sandbag.The sandbag started shaking violently due to the force of his punches. It seemed as though it was experiencing a storm.The students beside him unconsciously took a few steps back when they saw his crazy actions\u2026 This was so scary! Was this person a maniac? They needed to stay as far away from him as possible!While Wang Teng was practicing his fist skill, the image of him killing the five robbers kept replaying in his mind.1If he was given a chance to choose again, would he attack so ruthlessly?The answer was\u2026 yes!He wasn\u2019t used to it, but he didn\u2019t feel that he was wrong.1A person who killed others would be killed in return by other people!Also, in that situation, the robbers would have retaliated even more violently if he hadn\u2019t finished them in a single move.They had rune guns. If he wasn\u2019t careful enough, he would be the one getting killed. Thus, kindness was undesirable. He did everything\u2026 because he just wanted to live.After he finished practicing his fist skill, he started on his sword and blade skills.Wang Teng didn\u2019t want to stop even for a second. Instead, he wanted to be exhausted. That was the only way he was able to release all the pressure in his heart.Thus, Wang Teng practiced all the way until 11 pm. After the students left, he dragged his tired body to his car and drove back home.Only when he reached home did he finally feel relieved and at peace.\u201cSon, weren\u2019t you eating dinner with your classmates? Why did you go to the martial arts academy?\u201dLi Xiumei couldn\u2019t help but ask when she saw Wang Teng drenched in sweat and the look of exhaustion on his face.\u201cI went there after dinner. We need to be consistent in practicing martial arts,\u201d Wang Teng smiled and replied.\u201cYou are really serious this time, my boy,\u201d Li Xiumei said with relief.\u201cHurry up and bath. I will make some supper for you. Come down and eat it later.\u201dLi Xiumei\u2019s care and concern warmed up Wang Teng\u2019s cold heart. He smiled and walked upstairs.He took some clothes and entered the bathroom. Then, he opened the water tap.Cold water splashed on his tired body, seemingly washing everything away.After a cold bath, Wang Teng felt an unprecedented sense of relaxation. He felt light and free. He dried his hair and went down.\u201cWow, this smells really good. Mom, what good food did you make?\u201d\u201cYour favorite egg noodles. I used star beast meat to make the soup and added some star beast meat inside too. Come and eat it.\u201d Li Xiumei carried a bowl of noodles and walked out of the kitchen.\u201cNo wonder it smells different. It\u2019s even more fragrant.\u201d Wang Teng took his chopsticks in anticipation and slurped a huge mouth of the noodles.\u201cThis is delicious.\u201dWang Teng swallowed everything into his stomach like a whale. The heat flowed out of his mouth as he complimented involuntarily.\u201cEat more if you find it delicious. Practicing martial arts takes up too much of your energy. You need to replenish your stamina,\u201d Li Xiumei said.\u201cOkay.\u201dWang Teng finished more than half of the noodles within a few mouthfuls. He raised his head and asked, \u201cMom, where\u2019s Dad? Why don\u2019t I see him around?\u201d\u201cHe went overseas for business. He won\u2019t be returning for the next two days,\u201d Li Xiumei replied.\u201cI see.\u201dWang Teng finished his noodles quickly and patted his stomach in satisfaction. Then, he stood up and stretched his back.\u201cI\u2019m so full. Mom, I will go up now. Rest early too.\u201d\u201cOkay. I will sleep after I wash the dishes,\u201d Li Xiumei answered.Wang Teng went back to his own room and took out his phone.There were a few unread messages on his WeChat.Bai Wei had dropped a couple of messages, asking him what he was doing. One came from Yu Hao. This fellow wanted to practice martial arts with him.They had sent the messages when he was taken as a hostage, so he naturally couldn\u2019t reply to them.Since it was very late, he didn\u2019t message them back. He decided to wait until tomorrow.Wang Teng got on his computer and surfed the internet for a while. He watched the thickheaded netizens quarreling and making fun of other people. When he started feeling sleepy, he climbed onto his bed in a happy mood and said goodnight to himself.He closed his eyes and slipped into the dreamland.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day was Saturday.Wang Teng woke up late, which was rare. He only opened his eyes past 8 am.The sunlight outside the window sprinkled in and landed on his face. Wang Teng raised his hand to block the light, taking some time to get used to the brightness.\u201cIt\u2019s 8.45 am.\u201dWang Teng glanced at the time. He climbed out of bed, brushed his teeth, and washed his face. Then, he went downstairs.Aunt Chen and Aunt Lee, the maids at his house, had already started working. Aunt Chen was sweeping the floor while Aunt Lee was dusting.The villa was huge and spacious, but it was hard to clean. It was impractical to clean the house themselves.\u201cYou\u2019re awake. Come and have some breakfast,\u201d Li Xiumei said when she saw him.\u201cMom, I overslept. Why didn\u2019t you wake me up?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cYou looked so tired yesterday, so I didn\u2019t call you. It\u2019s Saturday. One or two hours won\u2019t make a difference,\u201d Li Xiumei replied.\u201cYoung Master has really changed. He\u2019s becoming more and more hardworking,\u201d Aunt Lee smiled and said.Although Aunt Chen and Aunt Lee were maids, they had a good relationship with Wang Teng\u2019s family. In the past, no matter how playful and cocky Wang Teng was, he never disrespected them in any way.This was attributed to Wang Shengguo\u2019s strictness and Li Xiumei\u2019s character education.A child was a reflection of his parents.\u201cI heard that Young Master is practicing martial arts now. My son used to do so in the past, but he didn\u2019t have the talent. He could only give up in the end. After all, the burden of practicing martial arts is too great for normal families like us,\u201d Aunt Chen agreed and continued.\u201cDon\u2019t praise him anymore. If not, he will become arrogant,\u201d Li Xiumei smiled and replied.Wang Teng ate his breakfast while chatting with the maids. He also replied to Bai Wei and Yu Hao\u2019s messages whenever he could.After he finished his breakfast, he informed Li Xiumei and drove his car out.Jixin Martial House, second floor of the martial disciple training building.Wang Teng greeted a few familiar students.\u201cAh Teng, you\u2019re a little late today!\u201d Zhang Shaoyang stopped his fist training and wiped the sweat off his forehead. He looked like he had been training for a few hours.\u201cI overslept, and my mom didn\u2019t wake me up,\u201d Wang Teng said helplessly.\u201cHahaha, all mothers are the same. If I overslept, my mom would never wake me up either,\u201d Zhang Shaoyang replied smilingly.Wang Teng laughed and shook his head.\u201cOh right, I have something to tell you. I will become an advanced stage martial disciple soon,\u201d Zhang Shaoyang said happily.\u201cOh, congratulations. When are you preparing to level up?\u201d Wang Teng was shocked for a moment. However, he didn\u2019t find it strange.Zhang Shaoyang\u2019s ability was already close to that of an advanced stage martial disciple. In the past, he had predicted that Zhang Shaoyang would have his breakthrough anytime now.\u201cI\u2019ll warm up in the morning before going for the test. If no accident happens, I\u2019ll go to the third floor for practice in the afternoon,\u201d Zhang Shaoyang answered.Wang Teng nodded as he teased, \u201cThere are more powerful people on the third floor. Don\u2019t get tortured.\u201d\u201cHmph, how is that possible? After I train for a period, I\u2019ll definitely catch up with them. Let\u2019s talk about you instead. Don\u2019t make me wait too long. Hurry up and become an advanced stage martial disciple soon. I think that I advance faster when I duel with you,\u201d Zhang Shaoyang said.\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t hold you up.\u201d Wang Teng smiled.The two of them chatted for a while and soon started practicing. They didn\u2019t waste any time.In the afternoon, Wang Teng went to watch Zhang Shaoyang\u2019s test. All his indicators had reached the basic requirements. Therefore, he successfully became an advanced stage martial disciple and went to the third floor.Wang Teng was genuinely happy for him.Advanced stage martial disciple! He was one step closer to becoming a martial warrior!Although this one step was huge, it was what all martial disciples worked hard to achieve.When will I be able to become a martial warrior?I wish I can get a Force skill scripture!Unfortunately, that\u2019s too difficult!Wang Teng pondered silently. He still didn\u2019t know what to do.Wang Teng spent the rest of his time in the martial arts academy. He picked up attributes and practiced furiously at the same time. He didn\u2019t even have the energy to tease that fatty, Wu Liang.Sunday, some time past 9 am.Wang Teng was still practicing in the martial arts academy when he received a call from Xu Jie.He said that there was a gathering today where they would be able to meet many friends from old and well-known families. Thus, he wanted to invite Wang Teng, Bai Wei, and his other friends.Wang Teng initially wanted to reject his offer, but he couldn\u2019t resist Xu Jie\u2019s nagging. He felt that Xu Jie would keep pestering him until he agreed.Hence, he accepted the invitation helplessly. They had been friends for so many years, so it wouldn\u2019t be good to make Xu Jie lose face.Honestly, he wasn\u2019t willing to attend the gathering. He had been to many such parties in his past life.The people attending were all rich second generations or children of officials. Everyone gathered to eat, drink, play, and keep up their friendships.Once they forged a good relationship, they could go out more in the future. If anyone had trouble, they could help one another out.But, in his past life, when his family went downhill, these people dodged as far away as possible. No one was really willing to help him.At that time, he understood.These were all fair-weather friends. They appeared like brothers on the surface, helping you when you have small or unimportant problems. Once you were in a true dilemma, you couldn\u2019t rely on them at all.\u201cForget it. I\u2019ll just go there to have some good food and drinks,\u201d Wang Teng consoled himself.He placed the sword and blade he was holding back into the weapons room. Then, he returned home to tidy up and changed his clothes. He prepared to meet Xu Jie and his friends first.\u201cMom, I won\u2019t be coming home for dinner. I\u2019m going to a gathering of our circle with Xu Jie and some other friends,\u201d Wang Teng told Li Xiumei.\u201cGo ahead. It\u2019s good to go out and make some friends. You practice martial arts every day. I\u2019m worried that you will get addicted to martial arts and won\u2019t find a girlfriend in the future\u2026\u201dThe moment he heard Li Xiumei mention his girlfriend, Wang Teng felt his head spinning.Judging from his mother\u2019s expression, he felt that she planned to continue this topic forever. Thus, he immediately ran away in fright.\u201cThis is so scary!\u201dWhen Wang Teng drove his car, he still had lingering fears.20 minutes later, he met Xu Jie and his friends at the toll station heading to Mount Bao\u2019an.This gathering was being held inside a mountain villa on Mount Bao\u2019an.It was said that the host\u2019s family was influential, and he had massive sway over the younger generation. This mountain villa was his personal property. He had provided it for their gathering today.The four of them drove two cars in. Bai Wei was sitting in Wang Teng\u2019s car as she briefly explained the situation to him.She wasn\u2019t clear about the details either.Xu Jie drove his car in front of them to lead the way.Yu Hao was sitting in his car, feeling a little bitter. At first, he wanted to sit with Bai Wei so that they could have a conversation along the journey. Yet, before he could open his mouth, Bai Wei had already run to Wang Teng\u2019s car.Wang Teng\u2019s sports car could only fit two people. In the end, Yu Hao had to throw his thoughts away.Mount Bao\u2019an was at the outskirts of Donghai City. If they took the highway, they would reach in half an hour.There were road signs placed at regular intervals. They followed them and left the highway, driving up the hill along a cement road.After years of development, there were many mountain villas and entertainment facilities built on Mount Bao\u2019an. A broad road was constructed to make it more convenient for travelers.The road\u2019s construction was made possible because Mount Bao\u2019an wasn\u2019t high. If it was too high, the road wouldn\u2019t reach the top.Lush forests lined the sides of the road and painted beautiful scenery. Mixed with the occasional chirping of birds, the sound of a flowing stream floated into their ears. It was invigorating and refreshing and lightened up people\u2019s moods.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Those that were ferocious became more ferocious, while stupids turned even more stupid.In the wilderness, there were giant eagles with a wingspan of a hundred meters soaring in the sky. There were lions the size of lorries occupying the grasslands. There were also fierce tigers with wings roaring in the forest\u2026Of course, in the cities, there were still stupid huskies devoted to their great course of dismantling homes. There were also cute cats dedicated to acting cute\u2026The mutated star beasts were blocked by martial warriors outside the city. In the city, its citizens continued to get along happily with the animals.Mount Bao\u2019an wasn\u2019t part of the wilderness. It was still within the vicinity of the city.The trees were lush and green, and they were all more than ten meters tall. It was a magnificent scene.Occasionally, colorful birds would fly out of the forest and stop at the side of the road, ignoring the cars going back and forth.In the past, these birds were just ordinary wild birds. Yet, now, their feathers were bright and colorful, their eyes were beautiful, and their posture was elegant. They could honestly be compared to the precious and rare birds in the past.However, in this era, they were just wild birds that could be seen all the time in the mountains.A white rabbit popped its head out from the bushes, peeking around with its ruby-like eyes. Its fur was smooth and glossy, and its long ears were folded back.\u201cLittle white rabbit! What a cute little white rabbit!\u201d Bai Wei exclaimed in surprise.Wang Teng glanced at the rabbit from the corner of his eyes while driving his car. The corners of his lips twitched uncontrollably.\u201cThis little white rabbit isn\u2019t\u2026 little at all!\u201dThe car drove away quickly. The little white rabbit also disappeared into the bushes, leaving Bai Wei extremely disappointed.The two cars soon reached the middle of the mountain.A villa was built against the mountain wall, with a verdant landscape as the backdrop. It merged with nature, making it high-class but not extravagant.After parking their cars, Wang Teng and his friends walked towards the villa.A line of attendants was waiting to welcome the guests at the door.They walked into the villa and passed through a corridor, which opened into a huge hall.There were already many people happily interacting inside.Someone came forward and welcomed them when he saw the group. The person smiled and said, \u201cElder cousin, you came. Aren\u2019t you going to introduce your friends to me?\u201d\u201cSun Gaoyan, my younger cousin.\u201cThis is my elder brother, Wang Teng. These two are my best friends too, Yu Hao and Bai Wei.\u201dXu Jie gave a mutual introduction.Sun Gaoyan was a little surprised when he heard Xu Jie calling Wang Teng his elder brother.They were cousins and were quite close to each other.Hence, he had some understanding of Xu Jie\u2019s personality\u2014indifferent and nonchalant. Yet, he called Wang Teng his elder brother. This meant that he respected the guy from the bottom of his heart.\u201cXu Jie is my elder cousin. Since he calls you elder brother, I will call you brother too,\u201d Sun Gaoyan smiled and said to Wang Teng.As the saying went, one can\u2019t be angry at a smiling person. Wang Teng also smiled in return and replied, \u201cEach to his own. We are peers. There\u2019s no need to address each other formally as an elder brother. You can just call my name.\u201dSun Gaoyan turned to Yu Hao and Bai Wei and chatted with them happily for a while. He took care of everyone and left no one unattended.With Sun Gaoyan bringing them around, Xu Jie and his friends quickly got familiar with the rest of the people.Wang Teng didn\u2019t like to socialize that much, but since he was here, he would respect other people when they came to speak to him. He would smile and reply to them.As a rich second generation, he had never especially learned such a skill. However, he had witnessed situations like these before, so he knew how to handle it.Also, he wasn\u2019t a lunkhead who didn\u2019t know anything and frowned upon everything.He still had to do the superficial greetings!Among them, the most popular person was actually Bai Wei.This young lady was pretty and lovely. When she stood with the other ladies, other young men kept turning their heads to look at her.Yu Hao felt unhappy when he saw this.A while later, more people joined the party, around 20 in total. They were all either rich second generations or the children of officials.Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but exclaim over how influential the host of this gathering was.\u201cGaoyan, who is the host of this gathering? Give me some information,\u201d Xu Jie asked Sun Gaoyan softly.\u201cZhou Baiyun!\u201d Sun Gaoyan chuckled before saying the name.\u201cZhou Baiyun!\u201d Xu Jie was astounded. \u201cThat Zhou family?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s the Zhou family you are thinking of,\u201d Sun Gaoyan nodded and replied.\u201cThen, who is this Zhou Baiyun?\u201d Xu Jie was puzzled, almost bursting with curiosity.\u201cThe third child of the Zhou family. She stayed overseas in the past and just came back recently,\u201d Sun Gaoyan said.\u201cShe isn\u2019t leaving anymore?\u201d Xu Jie immediately understood the situation.\u201cThat\u2019s right, she\u2019s not leaving anymore. I\u2019m afraid that there might be a fierce battle within the Zhou family in the future.\u201d Sun Gaoyan gave a meaningful smile.Bai Wei and Yu Hao were eavesdropping on their conversation. As rich second generations, they were naturally able to imagine future events.Wang Teng remained indifferent, though. This had nothing to do with him.No matter what happened, he wouldn\u2019t participate in it. Also, as long as he became a martial warrior, family feuds would be just a joke to him.\u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201dSomeone suddenly shouted.Footsteps were heard outside the hall. Then, four people walked in from outside.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I went to fetch a friend along the way. I apologize for letting everyone wait for such a long time,\u201d the lady in the middle of the four people scanned the crowd as she spoke.This lady seemed to be in her early 20s. She was tall and slender and could get 90 points for her beauty. However, she had a proud and domineering aura around her. She lifted her chin slightly and revealed her long slender neck, like an arrogant white swan.\u201cYou\u2019re not too late. We just arrived too.\u201d Everyone showed respect towards her and chimed in.\u201cWhy is Li Rongcheng here too?\u201d Xu Jie leaned towards Wang Teng and frowned as he asked.\u201cDidn\u2019t Miss Zhou say that he\u2019s her friend?\u201d Yu Hao pouted.\u201cLi Rongcheng has a grudge with us. Will he create difficulties for us by talking bad about us in front of Zhou Baiyun?\u201d Bai Wei asked.\u201cIf he dares to talk behind our backs, Wang Teng will beat him to death. I didn\u2019t see him in school for the past few days. He must be dodging Brother Wang Teng,\u201d Xu Jie said with contempt.\u201cAlright, this is their home ground. Don\u2019t talk so much,\u201d Wang Teng said.Zhou Baiyun had a strong background and was skilled with people. As she interacted with all the rich second generations and children of government officials, people quickly forgot their unhappiness about her late arrival.As for Li Rongcheng, he accompanied her all the time. It was obvious that Zhou Baiyun regarded him as an important person.Whether they were real friends or not, no one would know.After some time, Zhou Baiyun held a glass of red wine and walked towards Wang Teng and his friends.\u201cYou seem a little unfamiliar. May I know from which family talented youths like you come from?\u201dAs the saying went, respect other people and you would naturally get respected.The moment the third princess of the Zhou family opened her mouth, she gave high respect to Wang Teng and his friends.Talented youths?If students like Wang Teng, who didn\u2019t study well, were considered talented youths, they were dragging the standard for talented youths down to the abyss.Li Rongcheng\u2019s expression changed when he saw Wang Teng.Yuan Zhenghua was following Li Rongcheng, and his expression also followed his example.Their expression seemed to be carved out of the same mold.Before Sun Gaoyan could introduce them, Zhou Baiyun had already noticed the strange atmosphere between them. She smiled and asked, \u201cDo you know each other?\u201d\u201cOf course. How can we not know each other? We are old classmates! We are old friends.\u201d Xu Jie sniggered.\u201cYoung Master Li, you look better recently.\u201dWang Teng greeted Li Rongcheng casually since they knew each other.However, Li Rongcheng\u2019s expression worsened.Zhou Baiyun didn\u2019t know what was happening, so the smile on her face turned slightly awkward. Sun Gaoyan hurriedly introduced Wang Teng and his friends to her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cOh, so it\u2019s the fifth young master of the Wang family,\u201d Zhou Baiyun smiled as she said.3Her emotions a moment ago disappeared in an instant.Before coming here, she had done her homework on all the big and small prominent families in Donghai City. Thus, after Sun Gaoyan introduced these people to her, their identities immediately flashed through her mind.After a simple conversation, she excused herself and went to find other people.When she was a distance away, Xu Jie lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cOur families are probably not up to Zhou Baiyun\u2019s standard.\u201dAlthough Zhou Baiyun didn\u2019t portray her emotions, they could feel the difference in her attitude. She wasn\u2019t as hospitable to them as she was to the others.Sun Gaoyan was a little unhappy. He was the one who invited Xu Jie and his friends, so Zhou Baiyun\u2019s attitude made him feel humiliated.Wang Teng patted his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t mind her. We came here today purely to have fun and enjoy some good food. Making friends is secondary.\u201d\u201cGaoyan, don\u2019t think too much. It feels good to eat and play for free the entire day.\u201d Xu Jie chuckled.The other three people instantly felt better after his consolation.\u201cHey, how did Li Rongcheng manage to get to know Zhou Baiyun? By right, the Li family isn\u2019t strong enough to befriend the Zhou family,\u201d Bai Wei suddenly asked.1\u201cI heard that Zhou Baiyun is looking for martial disciples, especially advanced stage martial disciples with the hope of becoming martial warriors,\u201d Sun Gaoyan said.\u201cThat makes sense. When Li Rongcheng became an advanced stage martial disciple, the Li family had announced it to everyone. They probably wanted everyone to know that there was a genius in their Li family who would become a martial warrior in the future.\u201d Yu Hao joined the discussion.\u201cHmph, it isn\u2019t easy to become a martial warrior. Advanced stage martial disciples aren\u2019t rare, but only a small percentage of them can become martial warriors. Within a thousand advanced stage martial disciples, there might not be even one who can take that step. The Li family might not be able to help Li Rongcheng become a martial warrior even if they throw all their resources at him,\u201d Xu Jie said with contempt. He was incredibly irritated.3\u201cBut, this doesn\u2019t prevent Zhou Baiyun from drawing him to her side,\u201d Bai Wei mocked.\u201cThrow the net and you will get more fishes! Li Rongcheng is probably only one of the fishes. However, if Zhou Baiyun knows Brother Wang Teng\u2019s ability\u2026 haha!\u201d Xu Jie gave an evil smile.\u201cThis has nothing to do with me. No matter how well she treats me, I won\u2019t interfere in her affairs,\u201d Wang Teng shook his head and replied.A thought shot through Sun Gaoyan\u2019s mind as he listened to their conversation and recalled Li Rongcheng\u2019s expression a moment ago\u2026After some wild guesses, he realized something, and a glint appeared in his eyes.But, he didn\u2019t express his emotions. He maintained the same attitude and slowly integrated himself into Wang Teng\u2019s circle.Yu Hao and Bai Wei liked Sun Gaoyan\u2019s personality. Though Wang Teng knew his intentions, he didn\u2019t say anything.Besides, he was Xu Jie\u2019s cousin. This additional relationship naturally made it easier for them to accept him.Hence, they had a fun time chatting with one another.\u2026Afternoon. It was lunchtime.Plates of exquisite dishes were placed on the table. The fragrance of the food wafted into everyone\u2019s nose and made them salivate.\u201cThis is\u2026 star beast dishes!\u201dYu Hao said in a soft voice. He had seen these dishes before.\u201cZhou Baiyun must have spent a fortune on this gathering. These star beast dishes are quite expensive,\u201d Xu Jie commented.While everyone sat around the table, some guests inched towards Zhou Baiyun\u2019s side. Within a few seconds, the front part of the table was fully occupied.The entire dining table was long and rectangular.In the end, Wang Teng and his friends could only sit at the end of the table. They seemed a little asocial.Very soon, everyone started eating.Wang Teng took a piece of meat and placed it in his mouth. Once his tongue touched the meat, he immediately noticed that the energy contained inside wasn\u2019t thick.\u201cThese are probably wild beasts on the earth that underwent small mutations.\u201d He formed his conclusion.It made sense. Most of the people here were just normal human beings. How could they handle the energy contained in the meat of real star beasts?Wang Teng scanned through the guests briefly and saw that many rich second generations and children of officials had pale complexions. They looked so weak that it felt as though they could drop dead at any moment.To these people, eating a small amount of star beast meat could benefit their health. However, if they overate, it was as good as poison. They could lose their lives.Zhou Baiyun understood this, so she had prepared these ingredients.Of course, most people didn\u2019t know this. Wild beasts that underwent minor mutations were equivalent to the rare game meat wealthy people ate in Wang Teng\u2019s past life. Usually, there was little chance of tasting them.Also, these ingredients were cooked by advanced stage chefs. They were outstanding in color, flavor, and taste. At the same time, they were nourishing to the body. Everyone had a happy time eating.They all felt that Zhou Baiyun was very considerate!This meal lasted for more than an hour. After filling up their stomachs, Zhou Baiyun stood up and said, \u201cThere are many entertainment spots on Mount Bao\u2019an. In the afternoon, everyone can get some rest. We will go out to have some fun at 2.30 pm. Since we have already come here, we should have a good time.\u201dThey all agreed with her.There were many rooms in the villa, so the guests went to look for their rooms. Those wanting to rest excused themselves, while the remaining gathered together and chatted with one another.Xu Jie, Bai Wei, and Yu Hao didn\u2019t have Wang Teng\u2019s energy. They decided to rest for some time.Ever since Wang Teng started practicing martial arts, he would consciously ensure that his body was in its best state all the time. Since there was nothing for him to do now, he decided to get a short nap.2.30 pm.Everyone left their rooms and gathered in the hall. Under Zhou Baiyun\u2019s lead, they went into the mountain.There were indeed many entertainment spots in the mountain, like open-air swimming pools where one could play with water guns under the hot sun. They could also enjoy the sight of pretty ladies in bikinis along the way.Mind you, there were many beautiful ladies among the wealthy young generations.Not only that, there was a special area cordoned off as a hunting ground on Mount Bao\u2019an. Visitors to the mountain could form teams and hunt there. It was an exciting experience.Men loved guns, so this kind of hunting game would satisfy their desires to a large extent.So, there were indeed many entertainment venues, and it would be unwise to go through them one by one.The group soon reached their destination and looked at the open-air swimming pool in front of them. It was situated below a small waterfall. There were also many entertainments built around the swimming pool. Many people felt like taking off their clothes and jumping into the cool water.\u201cWoah!\u201dApparently, some people were already doing this. A man howled like a wolf and jumped into the swimming pool without even taking off his clothes.Water splashed everywhere!\u201cLin Hao, are you crazy!\u201dHis friends started laughing and teasing him.Lin Hao popped his head out of the pool and wiped the water off his face. He laughed heartily and said, \u201cThis feels so good. Hurry up and come down if you want to play. Why are you dilly-dallying?\u201d\u201cYou are indeed bold and unrestrained, just like your name (in Chinese, \u2018Hao\u2019 means bold and unstrained),\u201d Zhou Baiyun praised him.Lin Hao laughed loudly again.\u201cWhat an idiot,\u201d Xu Jie scolded him softly with a smile. He was speechless.\u201cThe hunting ground is at the side. You can go there if you want. All you have to do is to register with the staff.\u201cYou can hunt some game for us to barbecue at night!\u201cI have prepared a secret gift for the person who catches the most prey.\u201dZhou Baiyun pointed at an entrance-looking spot on the left and did some explanation. At the end, she warned everyone.\u201cHowever, I have to remind you that there are some aggressive wild beasts inside. Please ensure your own safety. It will be better to form a group. You can take care of each other that way. If you act alone, it will be very dangerous.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe second Zhou Baiyun finished speaking, people started heading over to the hunting ground after informing their friends.Wang Teng was interested too. Before joining them, he called out his attributes panel.Enlightenment: 82Physique: 167Strength: 28882Speed: 1033Battle Techniques: Basic Fist Skill (mastery), Basic Footwork (mastery), Basic Sword Skill (mastery), Basic Blade Skill (mastery), Gun Skill (small achievement)1Over the past few days, his attribute points had been steadily increasing, and he had also added \u2018gun skill\u2019 to his arsenal.It was already at the small achievement stage too.There were a lot of things related to gun knowledge in Wang Teng\u2019s mind. He felt that his aim had gotten accurate, and his gaze had become slightly sharp.He had picked up the gun skill two days ago when he killed the five robbers.1These robbers were all martial disciples, and they only had the very basic fist skill and footwork, so the attributes they could provide were limited. However, they had guns to make up for their lack of skills. They had dropped quite a lot of gun skill attributes.The attributes from the five robbers pushed Wang Teng\u2019s gun skill to the small achievement stage.Undoubtedly, killing someone would make them drop the most attributes!It was frightening just thinking about it!Besides attributes, Wang Teng also had another gain that day\u2014rune gun!Each of the five robbers had one rune gun. However, the leader of the robbers had another one hidden on his body. After the hostages ran out of the office building, based on the principle of not wasting any chances, Wang Teng\u2026 searched the corpses!This is just a good habit I picked up from playing games. o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o7Fortunately, the surveillance cameras were broken by professional robbers, so it provided the most convenient opportunity for Wang Teng.This was why Wang Teng had a weapon hidden on his body!2After he picked up the gun skill attributes, he hadn\u2019t had the chance to test it out. Thus, when he heard that guns could be used in the hunting ground, excitement crept up in his heart.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, shall we have some fun?\u201d Xu Jie asked with glistening eyes.Yu Hao and Sun Gaoyan seemed excited too.Wang Teng smiled in his heart. It looked like everyone had the same thought.\u201cLittle Wei, are you going?\u201d Wang Teng looked at Bai Wei and asked.\u201cNo. You guys play with the real guns, and I will play with my small water guns.\u201d Bai Wei waved the water gun that had suddenly appeared in her hand.\u201cErm\u2026 sure. As long as you are happy.\u201d The corners of Wang Teng\u2019s eyes jumped a little. He said to Xu Jie and the other two young men, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dBai Wei joined the water gun battle team with a few other young ladies.Wang Teng and his friends came to the entrance of the hunting ground. After finishing their registration at the staff counter and collecting their guns, they entered the hunting ground.The guns provided by the staff were also rune guns. However, their power couldn\u2019t be compared to the guns the robbers used.Although they were both rune guns, there was a difference in their power. More powerful rune guns were able to kill martial warriors, while weaker ones could only be used to kill the lowest level mutated wild beasts.Based on the power of the guns, rune guns could be classified from one-star to nine-star.The hunting guns they had weren\u2019t even considered one-star guns.But, when Xu Jie and his friends touched the guns, they felt they were caressing some precious treasure.3Amid mixed feelings, the group walked into the hunting ground.The entire hunting ground was surrounded by metal barbed wires, which were enhanced by runes. Hence, its defense ability was better than regular metal wires.The light in the hunting ground was a little dim. Trees shot up from the ground, and their dense crowns blocked the sunlight.The ground was filled with decomposed leaves and branches piled up over the years. When you stepped on them, they kept cracking.\u201cIsn\u2019t there any special staff assigned to clean the hunting ground normally?\u201d Xu Jie complained.\u201cCleaning is unnecessary. Many people are attracted by the atmosphere here. If there are too many signs of human intervention, it won\u2019t have this feeling anymore,\u201d Sun Gaoyan explained.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Xu Jie thought for a moment and nodded. \u201cMakes sense.\u201dYu Hao rolled his eyes. He had to admit that Xu Jie was a little idiotic and stupid sometimes.Bang!As they were chatting casually, a gunshot exploded beside their ears without any warning. They almost jumped on the spot in fright.\u201cF**k, Brother Wang Teng, why did you fire?\u201d Xu Jie patted his chest and asked.Wang Teng raised his chin. Xu Jie and the other three people looked in the direction he was pointing at.There was a huge grey rabbit!It was lying in the bushes, dead.\u201cWe\u2019re off to a flying start!\u201d Xu Jie laughed loudly.Yu Hao and Sun Gaoyan looked at Wang Teng in shock. They hadn\u2019t noticed when this rabbit appeared at all.Also, his firing was really accurate. One shot, one kill!After Xu Jie picked up the rabbit, the group of young people continued walking into the depth of the hunting ground. The deeper parts were the real playground for wild animals.An hour passed in a blink of an eye.Xu Jie and his friends were all carrying wild animals in their hands. The harvest seemed good.\u201cThere\u2019s movement in front.\u201dThe second Wang Teng spoke, the other three people stopped in their tracks and raised their guns.They listened carefully and noticed a faint sound coming from the distance. They were already used to Wang Teng\u2019s keen senses, so they appeared nonchalant now.Each of them found a tree and hid behind it.\u201cHurry up and chase it! Don\u2019t let it run away!\u201d someone shouted in front.Xu Jie exchanged glances with his companions. It looked like they had encountered another group of hunters.Just as they were preparing to give up, the bushes in front of them started shaking. Wang Teng and others stopped midway and saw an agile black shadow dashing out of the bushes.The person who shouted earlier had run over too.\u201cIt\u2019s them!\u201dXu Jie and his friends took a glance and exclaimed. It was Zhou Baiyun, Li Rongcheng, and their friends.Li Rongcheng was eager to perform in front of Zhou Baiyun, so he raised his gun and fired at his prey while sprinting.Bang, bang, bang!All three shots hit nothing. The black shadow dodged right and left. It was unimaginably agile.\u201cLi Rongcheng, if you can\u2019t hit it, stop firing. You are wasting the bullets. More importantly, what if you hit us?\u201d Xu Jie shouted in a mocking tone.\u201cF**k, why are you here?\u201d Li Rongcheng cursed, as if meeting them was unlucky.\u201cHaha, this hunting ground doesn\u2019t belong to your family. If you can come, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Xu Jie rebutted.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cHurry up and stop it. It\u2019s going to escape!\u201dBefore Li Rongcheng could say anything, Zhou Baiyun shouted from behind.\u201cF**k, Brother Wang Teng, it\u2019s a white wolf. It\u2019s running towards you,\u201d Xu Jie glanced at the animal and yelled in a strange tone.Wang Teng didn\u2019t want to fire. This wolf was Zhou Baiyun\u2019s prey. If he interfered with their tram hunting, grudges would naturally take root in their hearts.However, Li Rongcheng fired a few more shots and still couldn\u2019t hit it.\u201cIf anyone hits that wolf, I will fulfill one wish for him!\u201d Zhou Baiyun shouted when she saw that the white wolf was about to escape.Wang Teng looked at the white wolf dashing towards him and felt helpless.Why do you have to run towards me?You are forcing me to act.Bang!One shot!Wang Teng predicted the wolf\u2019s movement for dodging the bullet. He aimed his shot in its path and hit its abdomen with a single shot.The white wolf howled in agony and fell from the branches, landing on the ground with a thud.\u201cHaha, you hit it!\u201dXu Jie was happier than Wang Teng. He walked out from behind the tree and laughed at Li Rongcheng until Li Rongcheng\u2019s face turned green.\u201cWhat good luck!\u201d Li Rongcheng scolded.Yu Hao and Sun Gaoyan also walked over. They gathered around the wolf and examined it, clicking their tongues in amazement at the same time.\u201cThis wolf\u2019s fur is so beautiful!\u201dZhou Baiyun walked over and bent down to stroke the wolf\u2019s fur. She said delightfully, \u201cVery good. This fur is perfect for making a scarf.\u201d8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This white wolf\u2019s skin was just like silk. Not only was it pure white and beautiful, it felt extremely good to touch. Its thermal insulation effect was good too.Zhou Baiyun instantly fell in love with it.She passed the wolf to the young lady following her. Then, she got up and said to Wang Teng, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that your gun skill was so good. Thank you for helping out just now. I meant what I said. You can make one request of me.\u201dAfter she finished, she gave a cheeky smile and added, \u201cBut, you can\u2019t go too far!\u201dZhou Baiyun was proud and arrogant most of the time. But, mind you, when she put on a cheeky expression like this, the contrast made her attractive.She had probably noticed Wang Teng\u2019s ability, so her attitude towards him changed.Hmph, what a slap in the face!\u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me. It\u2019s nothing. Don\u2019t mention it.\u201dWang Teng smiled. His indifferent expression caused Li Rongcheng to go berserk as he screamed in his heart.He\u2019s acting!He\u2019s acting!This man must be feigning calm!\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Wang Teng turned and waved at Xu Jie and his other friends. Then, he walked towards the direction of the hunting ground\u2019s entrance.He was tired of hunting. The preys here didn\u2019t even require him to release one-third of his gun skill potential.Xu Jie didn\u2019t hesitate. After pointing his middle finger at Li Rongcheng, he followed Wang Teng out.Zhou Baiyun felt a little dissatisfied with the rejection.Sun Gaoyan said to Zhou Baiyun, \u201cSister Zhou, we are all tired from hunting. We will be going back now. Please continue to have fun.\u201dZhou Baiyun was displeased at Wang Teng for being disrespectful to her. However, she couldn\u2019t display her emotions openly, so she just nodded with a calm expression.2\u201cWait for me!\u201d Yu Hao couldn\u2019t bear to part with the gun in his hand. But, there was no point in continuing if he was the only one left, so he jogged and caught up with the rest.The four of them returned to the entrance and handed their guns to the staff.There were many beach chairs placed around the open-air swimming pool. The sunlight filtered through the trees, and the mountain spring in front of them shimmered under the sun.Wang Teng and his friends found four empty beach chairs and laid on them. Their hands didn\u2019t rest, though, as they enjoyed some iced fruits, snacks, and drinks.The group also admired the beauties in the swimming pool. Tsk\u2026 what a good life!1Xu Jie and Sun Gaoyan chuckled like ducks.1Yu Hao couldn\u2019t help but glance at them a few times. Then, he threw a look of contempt before turning to look at Bai Wei with a sincere expression.\u201cIt\u2019s good to be young. Everyone is full of vitality!\u201d Wang Teng wore a pair of sunglasses and held a cigarette in his mouth. While taking a puff of his cigarette, he lamented like an old man.4This young man was acting again!This time, he was pretending in front of nobody\u2026Xu Jie suddenly leaned over and asked with a secretive look on his face, \u201cBrother Wang Teng, who do you like?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201dXu Jie nodded.Wang Teng glanced at the swimming pool before replying, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to say? I\u2019ll choose the one with the best figure.\u201d\u201cShameless!\u201dThe three of them exclaimed simultaneously.Wang Teng laughed loudly in return. When he turned to look at the beauties again, a sudden scene caused him to squint.He picked up a small pebble on the ground and flicked it out with his fingers.Swoosh!The pebble cut through the air and hit a young man\u2019s hand. This guy was secretly trying to molest a young lady.The strength and accuracy were right on point.Perfect!\u201cAh!\u201dThe young man screamed in pain. He immediately retracted his hand, as though he was pricked by needles.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dBai Wei turned around and looked at the young man curiously.\u201cOh, nothing, nothing. I think I got bitten by something. It frightened me.\u201d He laughed awkwardly as he placed his hand behind his back, leaving no traces of his crime.Bai Wei ignored him and continued playing water guns with the other young ladies. Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh\u2026The young man looked at the back of his hand. It was swollen. It hurt so much that he gasped in pain.What happened just now?He scanned his surroundings in confusion. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t see anything.Wang Teng thought that after this lesson, the young man would restrain himself. But, more than ten minutes later, the young fellow sneaked behind Bai Wei and lifted his hand again in an attempt to grope her.Wang Teng frowned.Isn\u2019t he done?He picked up a bigger pebble and flicked it out once again. The stone flew towards the young man with a sharp gust of wind.This time, it didn\u2019t hit the back of his hand. Instead, it was aimed directly at the bottom part of his body.2\u201cSlap!\u201dA crisp sound shook the hearts of men.\u201cOuch!\u201d Afterward, another howl of pain was heard.The earth-shattering scream made everyone jump in fright. The young man\u2019s face turned distorted as he clutched the lower part of his body. He was crumpled up like a huge shrimp.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dEveryone turned to look at him. His friends went forward and showed some concern.The young man didn\u2019t dare to tell the truth. He waved his hand fervently and took a long time to calm down. Finally, he replied in a hoarse voice, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. I think something bit me.\u201dBai Wei gave him a puzzled look when she heard his familiar reply. Both times, this person was standing behind her. Both times, he screamed for no reason and explained that he got bitten by something. She wasn\u2019t stupid.Bai Wei had a hunch and raised her head. Her gaze coincidentally landed on Wang Teng, who was on the shore.Wang Teng raised his eyebrows and gave her a sign. Bai Wei was enlightened and got disgusted by the young man.After this issue, she didn\u2019t have the mood to enjoy anymore. She stepped out of the swimming pool and came beside Wang Teng and her friends.She found an empty bench and sat on it. Then, she chatted with them casually while having some drinks. Bai Wei didn\u2019t mention what happened just now at all.Time passed quickly.Soon, the sky turned dark, and everyone started building a campfire.Before this, Zhou Baiyun had already ordered people to clean the preys that were caught.Currently, plates and plates of fresh game meat were dished out. Those that knew how to barbecue started showing their capabilities. They needed to perform well in front of the beauties.The meal consisted of barbecued meat and vegetables. Everyone\u2019s lips were covered with oil from the food, but they didn\u2019t find it greasy.The atmosphere got livelier as they paired their food with beer.The young men and ladies were huddled in small groups, singing and playing together as though they had known each other for a long time.As they had fun, time seeped away slowly.Around 9 pm, everyone started to feel tired after a whole day of fun. They prepared to go back.Zhou Baiyun stood up and clapped her hands to gather everyone\u2019s attention. She was planning to say a few polite words before parting ways.Everyone respected her and looked at her quietly.Zhou Baiyun opened her mouth\u2026Boom!A loud explosion suddenly came from the forest in the distance. Even though it was far away, they still felt the ground vibrating a little.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dAll of them were flabbergasted. They looked in the direction where the sound came from. It was pitch black, and nothing could be seen clearly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe crowd exchanged glances with one another. No one knew what was happening in the forest.Li Rongcheng stepped out at this moment and said to Zhou Baiyun, \u201cI will go and take a look.\u201d\u201cAlright! Be careful,\u201d Zhou Baiyun nodded and replied.Li Rongcheng smiled. He ran into the forest in front and disappeared into the darkness.\u201cLi Rongcheng is an advanced stage martial disciple, right? In a situation like this, only people who practiced martial arts are useful,\u201d a rich second generation said in envy.Wang Teng looked at the pitch-black night sky. He hesitated for a moment before saying to Xu Jie and his friends, \u201cWait here. Don\u2019t run around. I will go and take a look.\u201d\u201cBrother Wang Teng, be careful,\u201d Bai Wei said worriedly.Wang Teng nodded.He stepped on the ground, and his body shot up abruptly. Tapping his toes on the branches lightly, Wang Teng flew onto the crown of a massive tree like a bird.Everyone exclaimed in surprise. They didn\u2019t expect the ordinary-looking Wang Teng to be a martial disciple too. Also, looking at his ability, he wasn\u2019t weaker than Li Rongcheng.1Indeed, he was an advanced stage martial disciple!Furthermore, judging from his skill, he was more powerful than Li Rongcheng.A glimpse flashed past Zhou Baiyun\u2019s eyes as she stared at the figure standing on the crown of the huge tree.Wang Teng gazed into the distance and identified the direction. He then exerted force on his legs and unleashed his monstrous strength within a split second.Boom!When he tapped his toes on the crown, the entire thing exploded, and wood splinters and leaves scattered down from the sky.Wang Teng\u2019s figure had already shot out like an arrow released from the bow. He slashed through the night sky and used the numerous trees to move quickly through the forest in mid-air.The bunch of rich second generations and children of officials were dazzled by Wang Teng. Was this the true ability of an advanced stage martial disciple?If Li Rongcheng saw this scene, he would denounce Wang Teng for acting in public again.To hell with advanced stage martial disciples!This wasn\u2019t martial arts!Which advanced stage martial disciple had his kind of ability? If all the advanced stage martial disciples were as powerful as him, the city would be filled with martial disciples jumping on roofs and climbing up walls.Not long after Wang Teng left, Li Rongcheng came back.\u201cDid you discover anything?\u201d Zhou Baiyun walked forward and asked.Li Rongcheng shook his head. \u201cThe sound came from somewhere extremely far away. I\u2019ve checked all the areas in the vicinity. I didn\u2019t notice anything unusual.\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dThe moment he finished speaking, another loud explosion shook the eardrums of the crowd.The atmosphere turned awkward for a second.Li Rongcheng felt embarrassed.Xu Jie and his friends snorted without any qualms. They didn\u2019t show any intention of hiding their peals of laughter. It made Li Rongcheng even more furious.\u201cWhat are you laughing at! Hey, where is Wang Teng?\u201d He suddenly noticed that Wang Teng had disappeared.\u201cAfter you left, Wang Teng went to take a look,\u201d Zhou Baiyun said.Li Rongcheng\u2019s expression turned uglier.What the f**k!Why is this fellow interfering with everything!\u201cLet\u2019s wait for a while longer. Maybe Wang Teng will bring some information back,\u201d one of the rich second generations suggested.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s wait for a while.\u201d Zhou Baiyun nodded.\u2026Wang Teng flew through the forest. He would tap his feet on the crowns of the trees every time before leaping forward.Honestly, ordinary advanced stage martial disciples weren\u2019t as powerful as him.The crown of a tree was delicate. If you exerted too much force, you would fall. Conversely, if your strength wasn\u2019t enough, you wouldn\u2019t be able to gain the momentum to leap forward.Normal advanced stage martial disciples didn\u2019t have his strength nor his outstanding body control. Hence, they couldn\u2019t astonish the crowd with a dazzling performance like Wang Teng.After some time, Wang Teng stopped. He jumped down from the tree and landed on the ground lightly.\u201cIt should be around here.\u201dWang Teng scanned the darkness around him. He had noticed something amiss.\u201cThere was a fight here a moment ago. The explosion was so loud. Could it be martial warriors?\u201dWang Teng had a sudden thought, scaring himself.\u201cIf it was really martial warriors, it\u2019s better for me to stay here.\u201dJust as Wang Teng wisely decided to retreat, he hesitated in his tracks.\u201cBut, martial warriors will drop attribute bubbles when they fight, right? What if there\u2019s something I need?\u201dHe froze on the spot. In his mind, the voice on the right was warning him that curiosity killed the cat. But, the voice on the left was enticing him\u2014great success came with great risk!1\u201cWhy don\u2019t I take a look first? If the situation isn\u2019t right, I will run away immediately.\u201dIn the end, Wang Teng convinced himself and carefully explored the forest. He was unusually nervous.He walked forward for another ten meters. Fallen trees could be seen all around him. The tree branches were shattered with burnt marks on them.There were also a few holes on the ground.Half of the deep holes\u2019 edges were burnt, while the other half was covered with ice shards.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wang Teng opened his mouth. He was astounded. Was this the power of a martial warrior?He took a few steps forward, and his gaze froze.Huh?There was a figure lying on the ground. It seemed to be dead.A few attribute bubbles were floating beside the figure.Wang Teng went wild with joy. However, just as the feeling appeared in his heart, he felt a sense of fear surging throughout his body. It completely drowned his happiness.In an instant, Wang Teng\u2019s head turned numb, and goosebumps started appearing on his body.He felt a sharp pain somewhere on his back. Without thinking, Wang Teng executed his mastery stage footwork to its maximum speed.He didn\u2019t have the time to dodge to the side, so he could only tilt his body slightly\u2026Slash!The glint from a sword cut through the air beside Wang Teng\u2019s body. His clothes were cut open, and his skin got pierced.A dash of fresh blood splattered everywhere.Fortunately, it was only an external injury. However, Wang Teng didn\u2019t dare to relax at all. The danger was still lingering closely around him.Almost at the same time when he evaded the attack, he shook his hand, and a small-sized rune gun appeared in his hand. He fired multiple shots in the direction where the glint of the sword came from.Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!Wang Teng only stopped shooting after he emptied the gun.He then dashed behind a tree and used it as cover. Wang Teng was panting as his heart threatened to jump out of his chest. He could feel death caressing his back just now.Who is it?Who on earth is it?Why does he want to kill me?The forest was eerily quiet. Besides the leaves rustling in the wind, no other sounds could be heard.Wang Teng waited for a few minutes before he stuck his head out slightly and looked in the direction where the sword had come from.A black figure was leaning against a tree without moving. There were a few bubbles floating beside this figure.The faint glow from the bubbles allowed Wang Teng to barely make out the figure. He seemed to be dead!Did I kill him?Could it be that he isn\u2019t a martial warrior?Wang Teng was filled with curiosity. In the end, he couldn\u2019t hold it in and walked over. However, he still had basic vigilance. Wang Teng shifted his energy to his fists and got prepared to fight at any moment.However, when he neared the figure, he discovered that the person was really dead.There was one headshot and a few more shots at his organs. If this person wasn\u2019t dead, he wasn\u2019t human.Phew!Wang Teng instantly heaved a sigh of relief.He touched his waist before looking at his hand. It was covered with blood.\u00a0I\u2019m so lucky! I almost died!Is the martial warrior world really so dangerous? Do they kill people whenever they want?Wang Teng was puzzled as he studied the corpse\u2019s face. This person didn\u2019t die in peace. There were still remnants of disbelief and the fear of imminent death on his face.Maybe he didn\u2019t expect to die in my hands!Wang Teng\u2019s gaze landed on the bubbles dropped beside this person.He picked them up!Red Flame ScriptureBeginner stage fire talentFire Force*2\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The feeling only lasted for a short moment, though, and disappeared in a split second.At the same time, his body underwent some unexplainable changes.When he closed his eyes before, it was pitch-black. But, now, he was able to feel numerous fiery red tiny particles floating above the earth. They were like little fairies with life.Fire Force!1This was the fire Force.1After Wang Teng\u2019s body completed its transformation, the fire Force hovering around him seemed to have discovered an amusement park. They happily flew towards him and entered his body through the various pores on his skin.However, since they didn\u2019t receive any guidance, they only knew how to barge around in his body.Fortunately, a memory that appeared in thin air managed to help him.Red Flame Scripture\u2014Force skill scripture!In Wang Teng\u2019s mind, a virtual shadow started practicing the scripture. Wang Teng could clearly see the meridians on the shadow\u2019s body. They spread out from his limbs with his spine as the trunk, covering his entire body.The fire Force immediately found their direction.The 2 attribute points of the fire Force he just collected were the most obedient. They acted as leaders and commanded the other small Force attributes to line up as they marched into Wang Teng\u2019s meridians.Finally, they followed the spine and congregated at its lowest part.A red light flashed brightly!Boom!A wave of heat exploded from the bottom of his spine and spread through Wang Teng\u2019s entire body. The injury he suffered before started healing rapidly as the heat subsided, all the way until it completely healed.Then, the ball of heat shot out of the crown of his head like a balloon of steam.As it slowly dissipated, the red light at the bottom of his spine also subsided. Everything soon died down.At the other side of his mind, another figure was holding a battle sword and practicing. The power of fire was wrapped around the battle sword, and its strength was formidable.Fire Kirin Sword Skill\u2014Force battle technique!After the scene disappeared, Wang Teng opened his eyes. He suppressed the happiness in his heart and looked at his attributes panel.1Wang Teng was shocked by what he saw.His attributes panel had undergone a transformation.Enlightenment: 83Spirit:12.1Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (10/300)Force: 6/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)1Scripture: Red flame scripture (foundation 1/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (mastery for fist, sword, blade, footwork), gun skill (small achievement), fire kirin sword skill (foundation 10/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks)Overall Battle Power: 132 (the final decision belongs to the system(\u25cf\u02c7\u2200\u02c7\u25cf))4What is this?Wang Teng stared at the totally different attributes panel, especially at the \u2018Force\u2019 row. He couldn\u2019t shift his gaze away anymore.One-star soldier level?I\u2026 I\u2019ve become a martial warrior!!Wang Teng clenched his fist and took many deep breaths before he forcefully calmed himself down.So this person was indeed a martial warrior.I actually killed a martial warrior!He lowered his head and looked at the corpse of the martial warrior in front of him. He didn\u2019t know what emotions he should have.\u201cSigh!\u201dIn the end, he let out a deep breath.Suddenly, Wang Teng remembered that there was another person lying on the other side. The figure dropped a few attribute bubbles too. Wang Teng needed to pick them up quickly, or they would disappear.Fortunately, the scene just now felt really long, but only a few seconds had passed in real life.1When Wang Teng came back to the person lying on the ground, the bubbles were turning transparent, but they hadn\u2019t disappeared completely.He picked them up!Beginner stage ice talentIce Force*11Deep Ice ScripturePhantom Ice Fist*8There were four attribute bubbles, with the \u2018spirit\u2019 bubble missing.If Wang Teng was right, this fellow was a martial warrior too!As the attribute bubbles merged into Wang Teng\u2019s body, the same thing happened again.Wang Teng received the beginner stage ice talent, and his body became attractive to ice Force. All the ice particles floating around him surged into his body.The Force skill scripture, Deep Ice Scripture, started demonstrating its uses.The figure in Wang Teng\u2019s mind was sitting down cross-legged. In real life, Wang Teng copied the figure\u2019s actions; he crossed his legs and sat down. He followed the Deep Ice Scripture and guided the ice Force around his body through his meridians.The cold and icy feeling caused him to shiver.A thin layer of frost appeared on the ground around him.Wang Teng didn\u2019t notice it, though. He commanded the ice Force and congregated them at the lowest part of his spine.Boom!The flow of ice Force into the spine aroused the fire Force particles that had stationed themselves there not long ago.These two elements were naturally incompatible!Once they met, one must disappear. They would never allow the other element to exist in their vicinity.However, just as the two Forces were all set for a showdown and confrontation was imminent, a profound and mysterious energy appeared in between these two Forces.3This energy allowed the ice Force and the fire Force to calm down.The two Forces slowly twirled and finally became circles, maintaining a stabilized equilibrium.At the same time, information about the Phantom Ice Fist successfully merged with Wang Teng\u2019s memory. He had received another Force battle technique.A few minutes later, Wang Teng let out a long sigh and opened his eyes.That was dangerous!Ice and fire are incompatible. They almost exploded in my body. That almost scared me to death.Wang Teng still had lingering fears. He felt that after going home, he must read up on martial warriors.If not, he might make another common sense mistake again and kill himself without knowing how he died.Speaking of this, did that energy come from the ultimate boss, the system?Wang Teng pondered over this question for some time, but he couldn\u2019t think of another explanation. It was most likely that the system had helped him.After all, he didn\u2019t have a magical ring, so he knew that there wouldn\u2019t be an old man appearing suddenly to save him from the verge of death.3He wouldn\u2019t have the chance to tear up and call the old man his master~What a touching scene. It moved heaven and earth and touched everyone\u2019s heart!Wang Teng stood up and patted the dried leaves off his body. At that moment, he noticed that the ground around him had a layer of frost on it. Wang Teng was stunned.\u201cForce is really amazing!\u201dWang Teng exclaimed. He looked at the corpses of the martial warriors and contemplated\u2026Well, let\u2019s search the corpses.3He looked through the pockets. Besides a cell phone and one steel bar, there was nothing else.But, the purple-black gloves on his hand caught Wang Teng\u2019s attention.This is good stuff!I\u2019ll keep it and examine it when I go home.He ran to the other fire element martial warrior and searched through his pockets too.An iPhone 8.1A Zippo lighter.\u00a0This is good. I\u2019ll keep it.There was also a pack of squashed cigarettes in his pockets. It looked like this man was a smoker. Wang Teng kept it without any qualms.\u201cHey, this sword is not bad.\u201dWang Teng pried open the corpse\u2019s fingers and sized up the long sword with bright red runes on it. He took possession of it immediately.\u201cPlease don\u2019t blame me. Take nothing away at death. You cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he didn\u2019t go back soon, Xu Jie and his friends might come and look for him.If they saw this scene\u2026Wait!Wang Teng frowned.He had taken the possessions of these two martial warriors. If someone came to investigate, they would easily find him.Should he destroy the evidence by burning the corpses?It looked like this was the only thing he could do.Wang Teng placed the two corpses in a deep hole and activated the fire Force in his body. A small flickering flame appeared on his finger.\u201cYou created this deep hole. It just so happens that you can use it now.\u201cCremation is popular in society nowadays. It\u2019s environmentally friendly and doesn\u2019t waste landmass. How do you recite that poem\u2026 Oh right, \u2018Though turned to mud, they\u2019d nurture flowers\u2019 growth next spring\u2019.1\u201cAfter you die, you can still make contributions to this forest. How lovely is that?\u201dWang Teng chattered away for a few seconds before he laid his eyes on the martial warrior who wanted to kill him. His emotions were complicated.\u201cAlthough you wanted to kill me, I didn\u2019t die and even killed you instead. This lighter and cigarette will be the compensation for the emotional distress you caused me. Now, I will cremate you since I\u2019m still a good person.\u201d1He flicked his fingers, and the flame flew out, precisely landing on the corpse.The corpse lit up!It burned furiously like a raging blaze. Since it was using the Force as its fuel, the flame was burning furiously.Within a few seconds, the two corpses turned into ashes. Nothing was left behind.Without the corpses, no one would know what had happened here tonight. Even if someone managed to find him, they wouldn\u2019t be able to know what he took.Perfect!\u201cIt\u2019s time to go back!\u201dBut why were these two people fighting here in the middle of the night? Was it for fun?Wang Teng was puzzled. He scanned the surroundings but found nothing. In the end, Wang Teng could only shake his head. It looked like he was thinking too much.Wang Teng decided to return to the party. After taking a step, he retracted his feet back.Wang Teng stared at the huge tree the fire element martial warrior was leaning against just now. He had a weird feeling.He walked under the tree and looked up.The leaves were blocking his view, so he couldn\u2019t see anything. He had no choice but to jump lightly. Wang Teng landed on a branch and looked around him casually.\u201cHuh?\u201dHis gaze froze.It was a backpack!Wang Teng jumped over and took the backpack down from the branch. He unzipped the bag and found it stuffed with hay. The hay was wrapped around\u2026 an egg!2Were they fighting over this egg?\u00a0Wang Teng touched his chin as he wondered to himself.The martial warriors were dead, so there was no point thinking about this. This egg belonged to him now.\u2026\u201cWang Teng has left for half an hour. Why isn\u2019t he back yet?\u201dThe rich second generations and children of officials were getting impatient from the long wait. They were a little unhappy.\u201cWe didn\u2019t ask you to wait. If you want to leave, you can leave. Why are you complaining?\u201d Xu Jie frowned and replied.\u201cThat\u2019s not right. We are waiting because we are worried about Wang Teng. However, from Wang Teng\u2019s point of view, it isn\u2019t right of him to make so many people wait. If he can\u2019t find anything, he should have come back earlier. He doesn\u2019t need to put on a strong front,\u201d said Li Rongcheng.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I think he just boasted himself as an advanced stage martial disciple.\u201d A young man scoffed.Some other people wanted to chime in, but a voice suddenly came out from the forest.\u201cI\u2019ve never said that I\u2019m an advanced stage martial disciple, right? In that case, there\u2019s no such thing as a self-proclaimed advanced stage martial disciple.\u201dThe young man\u2019s expression froze.Wang Teng looked at him indifferently. Then, he smiled at the crowd.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to keep you waiting for such a long time. I forgot that I\u2019m bad with directions, so I accidentally lost my way.\u201d\u2026 Everyone almost fainted.Where did you get the guts to enter a forest alone when you have no sense of direction?Investigation? What can you investigate!\u201cYoung Master Li, be careful. You might become a gossipmonger if you continue speaking behind other people\u2019s back.\u201d Wang Teng looked at Li Rongcheng and gave him a mysterious smile.Feeling guilty from his gaze, Li Rongcheng turned his head away.Zhou Baiyun didn\u2019t believe Wang Teng\u2019s nonsense, though. She walked forward and asked, \u201cYoung Master Wang, did you discover anything?\u201d\u201cNo. I circled the vicinity a few times and finally managed to find my way back. I didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d Wang Teng shook his head and replied.Zhou Baiyun looked at him intently with a meaningful gaze. She said, \u201cIn that case, let\u2019s go back. It\u2019s getting late.\u201dNo one had any objections.Everyone went back to the mountain villa to get their cars before bidding farewell and leaving.Of course, we needed to mention that the person who caught the most number of prey was Li Rongcheng.Since Wang Teng left the hunting ground earlier, Li Rongcheng had won by a small margin.He did receive a mysterious gift. It was something Zhou Baiyun brought back from overseas\u2014a human-sized doll.3And it was a female!Li Rongcheng\u2019s expression was indescribable at that time.5\u2026Wang Teng and Xu Jie\u2019s car drove into Donghai City one after the other.At the intersection, while they were waiting for the light to turn green, Xu Jie wound his window down and shouted at Wang Teng, \u201cBrother Wang Teng, we will be going home first. Please send Little Wei back.\u201d\u201cGo ahead. Send a message when you reach home.\u201d Wang Teng waved his hand.The two of them parted ways at the intersection.Wang Teng dropped Bai Wei at her home. She lived in another villa district known as Jinhua.There were many wealthy people in Donghai City, so naturally, there were many similar villa districts.Bai Wei stood in front of the entrance of a villa and tip-toed as she waved. \u201cBrother Wang Teng, hurry up and go home. Be careful on your way back.\u201d\u201cI will take my leave now. Sleep early. You\u2019ll get old faster if you sleep too late.\u201d Wang Teng smiled and drove away.\u201cYou are the one who will get old.\u201d Bai Wei pouted.\u2026Along the way, Wang Teng drove really fast. He just wanted to reach home as quickly as possible to count and examine the gains he had received tonight.He had hidden the backpack containing the mysterious egg, the fire element martial warrior\u2019s battle sword, and the other small items in his car trunk in advance.Earlier, Wang Teng had rushed back to the mountain villa at his fastest speed to hide the items. Then, he went back to find Zhou Baiyun and others.If not, there was no way for him to explain the many items he was carrying.Fortunately, when he achieved his breakthrough, the wound created by the fire element martial warrior had healed. He wouldn\u2019t be able to explain it either if it didn\u2019t.1Wang Teng took off his bloodstained and torn clothes and found a similar colored shirt to change into. The night was dark, so no one noticed that he had changed his clothes.1Since he was in a rush, this was the best he could do.Some explanations couldn\u2019t withstand careful analysis. Zhou Baiyun had probably noticed something amiss, but she didn\u2019t have evidence. She had to stop at her guess.Wang Teng recalled the things he did as he drove his car. After confirming that there was no huge problem, he finally felt a little more relieved.The egg!He felt like he was a thief!5He shook his head.There were only a few cars on the road at night. Wang Teng placed his left elbow on the car window and leaned his head on his hand. He started driving with one hand like a seasoned driver.1As Wang Teng drove past a business lane, he saw the bustling and prosperous street from the corner of his eyes.It was already past 10 pm, but there were still many people on the streets.They were laughing and having fun.The young men held the hands of young ladies and stayed out the entire night.It felt so good!The life of an ordinary person is not bad too!\u00a0As Wang Teng thought to himself, a familiar figure suddenly appeared in his vision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were signs of exhaustion on her exquisite face.Her forehead was covered with sweat, and her hair was slightly messy because of this.But, this couldn\u2019t hide her beauty.Lin Chuhan worked part-time at a bubble tea shop. Indeed, it was the milk tea shop called Er Dian Dian!1Undoubtedly, her presence added a touch of color to the shop.The boss of the bubble tea shop felt that his decision in the past was brilliant. Whenever Lin Chuhan was present, the business at his shop would be better than usual.Unfortunately, Lin Chuhan could only work during the weekends.What a pity!The boss was married and had a fierce wife at home, so he didn\u2019t have any other thoughts towards Lin Chuhan.However, the two male workers in his shop were drooling over the pretty girl. They would either send her breakfast in the morning or treat her for lunch. They were extremely attentive to her.The boss saw everything and wanted to say a thing or two. However, it wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to interfere with his workers\u2019 private life. He could only set a rule to prevent them from dating during working hours.The rule had its effect.But once work ended, the boss couldn\u2019t control them anymore.Currently, the workers were all packing up and preparing to get off work. At that moment, a tall, big, and modest-looking young man walked over and smiled at Lin Chuhan.\u201cChuhan, it\u2019s already very late. Let me send you back later.\u201dThe other young man was fresh and clean-looking with a tin foil perm. When he noticed that he was a step slower, he got anxious and said, \u201cChuhan, your house is on the way to mine. Why don\u2019t I send you home?\u201dA young lady teased him from the side. \u201cSeriously? Your \u2018on the way\u2019 is approximately ten kilometers away from Chuhan\u2019s house.\u201d\u201cAt least my house is closer to hers than Qian Weibo\u2019s. One of them lives in the west and one in the east. They are at least 20 km apart,\u201d the man with tin foil perm replied.The lofty man, Qian Weibo, frowned. Then, he smiled and said, \u201cNormally, I exercise at night. If I send Chuhan home and then go back later, the amount of exercise is just perfect for the day.\u201d\u201cHmph, your excuse is really high-sounding.\u201d The other young man scoffed.\u201cAlright, stop fighting. I don\u2019t need you guys to send me back. I can go home myself,\u201d Lin Chuhan said coldly. As always, she rejected them outright.The two young men felt helpless. They got rejected all the time. Actually, they didn\u2019t even know where Lin Chuhan lived.Lin Chuhan had only told them the general district\u2026After all, a young lady needed to protect herself outside. She must not tell other men her address casually.The two young men still wanted to try their luck, but a voice was heard at this moment.\u201cPretty lady, can I have a cup of bubble tea!\u201dLin Chuhan found the frivolous and haughty tone very familiar.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re closed.\u201dThe moment Qian Weibo finished speaking, Lin Chuhan turned around and saw the person who had walked in. She was surprised as she asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cLook at what you are saying? Why can\u2019t I be here?\u201d Wang Teng smiled and replied.Qian Weibo and the young man with tin foil perm felt a strong sense of danger when they listened to these two people\u2019s familiar interaction.Also, this man was a little handsome!Hmmm\u2026 Just a little!Qian Weibo asked, \u201cChuhan, who is this?\u201d\u201cChuhan?\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201d Wang Teng squinted and gave him a meaningful gaze.\u201cHe\u2019s my table buddy,\u201d Lin Chuhan replied.\u201cTable buddy!\u201dThe gazes of Qian Weibo and the young man with tin foil perm froze. Then, they looked at each other.They could tell from each other\u2019s gaze that this was a strong opponent who required them to join hands.\u201cSince he\u2019s Little Lin\u2019s table buddy, let\u2019s make him one last cup of bubble tea,\u201d the boss nodded at Wang Teng and said.Qian Weibo asked, \u201cSo, classmate, what do you want to drink?\u201d\u201cDo you have Xiang Piao Piao?\u201d Wang Teng asked.Qian Weibo: \u2026What do you mean by Xiang Piao Piao!This is a bubble tea shop, not the supermarket!If you want to drink Xiang Piao Piao, go to the supermarket to buy a cup and brew it yourself at home!Qian Weibo screamed in his heart.The boss of the bubble tea shop and the other workers were also left speechless. They didn\u2019t know what to say.On the other hand, Lin Chuhan had already started moving. She made the easiest recipe, milk tea with black pearls. She prepared the biggest cup for Wang Teng and finished it quickly. Then, she placed it in front of him.\u201c12 RMB!\u201d3\u201cSo expensive!\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t care what kind of bubble tea it was. He complained for a moment and took out his phone to pay for his drink.Lin Chuhan ignored Wang Teng. After packing up, she bid farewell to the boss and walked out of the bubble tea stall.She pushed a pink scooter out of the parking lot at the side.Then, she put on a round Hello Kitty helmet and was just about to mount her scooter.\u201cChuhan, wait for me.\u201dQian Weibo and the man with tin foil perm hurriedly packed up their stuff and chased after her. Each of them was pushing one scooter.Wang Teng\u2019s appearance had given them a sense of urgency. Tonight, whether Lin Chuhan rejected them or not, they planned to shamelessly send her home either way.Lin Chuhan frowned unhappily when she saw the two of them pestering her like Chinese medicine plaster.1\u201cMiss class monitor, let me send you home.\u201d Wang Teng walked over while carrying his milk tea.\u201cNo need!\u201d Lin Chuhan said coldly.\u201cWe are classmates. You don\u2019t have to be polite with me.\u201dWang Teng snatched Lin Chuhan\u2019s little scooter and carried it up with one hand.\u201cOh my god, his strength!\u201dThe two young men\u2019s expressions changed for the worse. When Wang Teng walked to the sports car parked beside the road, their eyes widened even more.\u201cBeep!\u201dThe boot of the car opened, and Wang Teng stuffed the scooter into the car. However, the lid couldn\u2019t close properly.The pink scooter was half-exposed in the air. It was glaring to the eye.O_o\u2026\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201d This is really amazing!\u201d\u201cStuffing a scooter in a sports car. I have never seen anything like this!\u201dThis series of actions stunned the boss of the bubble tea shop and the other workers.\u201cIs this the distance between us?\u201dQian Weibo and the other young man started questioning their lives.Wang Teng opened the car door and urged Lin Chuhan, who was rooted on the spot.\u201cLet\u2019s go. What are you waiting for?\u201dLin Chuhan hit her lips and stomped her foot. In the end, she still sat in the car.1Bang!You could almost hear the sound of glass shattering.Their hearts hurt!The two young men clutched their chests.Wang Teng helped close the car door. Just as he was about to get in the car, he remembered something and walked towards Qian Weibo and the other young man.\u201cMisters, are you very close to my class monitor?\u201d he smiled and asked.The two of them wanted to nod. Wang Teng placed his hands on their shoulder and exerted some force\u2026The next moment, excruciating pain was felt!\u201cSince you\u2019re not familiar with her, remember to call her by her full name the next time.\u201dI, Wang Teng!Am really narrow-minded!3Wang Teng snorted and released his hand. Qian Weibo and the other young man\u2019s faces were red from holding their breath.Pain~They felt as if their bones were crushing.This guy\u2019s strength was astonishing. Could he be practicing martial arts?Also, he was driving a sports car. That meant that he was wealthy!They couldn\u2019t afford to provoke him! They couldn\u2019t!1Shivers~The two of them hurriedly nodded. Lin Chuhan? Who was she? Was she very pretty? What did it have to do with them?Nothing was important anymore.Rather, the most important thing now was to send this devil away.Wang Teng drove his car and charged into the night with his loud engine. Qian Weibo and the young man with tin foil perm stared at the sports car\u2019s rear lights in a daze.As well as the little scooter exposed outside\u2026They felt an unprecedented sense of humiliation!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Isn\u2019t that kicking me to the curb after I\u2019ve outlived my usefulness?\u201d Wang Teng asked her back.\u201cI want to get off the car,\u201d Lin Chuhan couldn\u2019t beat Wang Teng in speaking, so she unbuckled her seatbelt and said firmly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me where you live, I\u2019ll drive to my home.\u201d Wang Teng smiled calmly.4Lin Chuhan: \u2026In the end, she lost.She lost to Wang Teng\u2019s shamelessness.Wang Teng sent her home.Lin Chuhan lived in a low block area. It was hard to imagine that such a place existed in Donghai City.In front of them was a black alley. When they reached here, Lin Chuhan refused to let Wang Teng send her any further.Also, the car couldn\u2019t drive in, so Wang Teng had to give up.He picked up Lin Chuhan\u2019s scooter and then hung the milk tea on the handle.\u201cAlright, you can go back yourself,\u201d said Wang Teng.\u201cYour milk tea.\u201d Lin Chuhan frowned.\u201cI won\u2019t be able to sleep if I drink milk tea at night,\u201d Wang Teng replied.\u201cSo you want me to have trouble sleeping instead.\u201d Lin Chuhan was speechless.\u201cHahaha, you can only think of me if you have trouble sleeping.\u201d Wang Teng laughed.6\u201cGet off~\u201dLin Chuhan ran off in a flurry as she rode her little scooter into the dark alley.This alley was long and dark. Even though her scooter\u2019s light was on, she could only see a small distance in front of her.Lin Chuhan rode carefully. Suddenly, a white light lit up behind her.She turned and noticed that Wang Teng had turned his car around. He had turned on his car\u2019s headlights and lit up the entire alley for her.\u201cThis fellow!\u201dLin Chuhan was touched. But, she hurriedly shook her head to get rid of the feeling and rode her little scooter forward.Wang Teng only left when he couldn\u2019t see Lin Chuhan\u2019s figure anymore.When he reached home, it was already 11 pm.Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly. He wanted to rush home earlier, but he was still delayed until now.Women!They were troublesome!2The house was silent. Wang Teng closed the door and climbed up the stairs.It looked like Li Xiumei had gone to bed.Wang Teng didn\u2019t make any sound. He brought his spoils back to his room and took some clothes to the bathroom.After bathing, he dried his hair.Then, he locked the door and rubbed his hands in anticipation. He sat cross-legged on the ground and took out everything to sort them.One steel bar, one Zippo lighter, half a pack of cigarettes, and two cell phones. These were all ordinary items.4If there was a chance, he wished that he would be able to decode the passwords of the two cell phones.There must be some information he needed in the two cell phones, including the identities of the two dead martial warriors.There was also a pair of boxing gloves and a battle sword.These were all rune weapons!The runes carved on the boxing gloves and the battle sword appeared mysterious and extraordinary.Wang Teng searched online based on their appearance.The purple-black boxing gloves were a one-star high-class ice element weapon from the \u2018dark shadow\u2019 series. The pair\u2019s retail price was around two million.As for the battle sword with fiery red runes, it was a one-star elite-class weapon from the \u2018fiery flame\u2019 series. Its market price was 3.5 million.This price!Wang Teng could only sigh and exclaim that martial warriors were all wealthy people!Fortunately, he was a rich second generation, so he had seen this kind of price before. He wouldn\u2019t kick up a fuss over a few million.However, this saved him the trouble of buying and selling weapons. These two weapons were enough for him to use.Finally, the egg!Wang Teng took the egg out of the bag and observed it carefully under the light. From its surface, he really couldn\u2019t tell which animal\u2019s egg this was.\u201cThis egg should be the reason why those two martial warriors were fighting so brutally.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, this egg must be special.\u201dHe looked at different kinds of eggs online and compared them with the one in his hand. He spent another half an hour analyzing.In the end, he came to an astonishing conclusion.\u201cThis is the egg of a bird!4\u201cThat\u2019s right, it must be.\u201dWang Teng nodded to himself and stuffed the egg back into the bag. He covered it with hay and zipped the bag. Then, he hid it in a corner under his bed.\u201cNo matter what it is, let\u2019s keep it first.\u201cI will think of a way to hatch it after I confirm its identity.\u201dWang Teng then shifted his gaze to his attributes panel.Enlightenment: 83Spirit:12.1Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (10/300), Beginner stage ice talent (12/300)Force: 6/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)4/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red flame scripture (foundation 1/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 1/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (mastery for fist, sword, blade, footwork), gun skill (small achievement), fire kirin sword skill (foundation 10/100), phantom ice fist (foundation 8/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks)Overall Battle Power: 1354Looking at the rows and rows of attributes on his board, Wang Teng suddenly felt a sense of satisfaction.Martial warrior!He finally became a martial warrior!As compared to other people, the time he took from practicing martial arts to the moment he became a martial warrior was very short. But, the experiences he went through weren\u2019t lacking at all.He even went through a life-or-death situation recently!1Seeking fortune in danger!It was worth it!Then, Wang Teng compared the before and after differences of his attributes panel.When he was at Mount Bao\u2019an, he didn\u2019t have the time to ponder over this. Now, after observing his attributes panel, he realized that the differences were huge.Firstly, Spirit was a new row.It wasn\u2019t hard to understand what it was based on the word itself.Spirit represented a person\u2019s consciousness. It was a profound way of saying it.He might have gotten the spirit attribute from the dead fire element martial warrior, so this attribute got activated.He continued looking down. The physique attribute was gone, replaced by Talent.Wang Teng knew what talent was. After the physique of a martial warrior reached a certain standard, they would undergo a test using a special device to ascertain their talent direction. This would allow them to choose the Force skill scriptures and the battle techniques they could cultivate.This was the largest difference between martial disciples and martial warriors.Wang Teng thought about it carefully and was flabbergasted.\u201cSpeaking about this, I got the fire and ice element talent because I picked up the attribute bubbles. Does that mean that I don\u2019t have any talent personally?\u201dHe searched the internet before and knew that most people had talents. Once their physique reached a certain level, they would be able to practice Force skill scriptures.But, there was a tiny percentage of people who didn\u2019t have any talent.To be very talented and having no talent were two extremes.Both were rare.He didn\u2019t expect himself to be one of them!\u201cI\u2019m lucky to have my system!\u201dWang Teng felt fortunate. He wasn\u2019t afraid of having an inferior talent, but rather, he was scared of having no talent at all. It would cut off all possibilities in his life.Imagine this. You practiced hard for so many years and were just a step away from reaching your goal. Suddenly, you were told that you had no talent. How frightening would this stimulation be?1People with a poor mentality might collapse after the setback!Wang Teng shook his head.Next was the Force attribute. That represented the martial warrior\u2019s level.Wang Teng was a one-star soldier-level martial warrior now. However, he had two Force elements in his body. Based on numbers alone, he was more powerful than martial warriors with only one Force element.He searched the internet and learned that single element martial warriors were the most common. Multiple Force element martial warriors were extremely rare.You could occasionally see a few double Force element martial warriors, but triple Force element martial warriors were rarely seen. As for four Force elements, five Force elements, and even six Force elements martial warriors, they had not appeared yet.3Skill Scripture and Battle Techniques didn\u2019t change much. Only two Force skill scriptures and Force battle techniques were added.Finally, there was the Battle Power.Battle Power was probably the overall calculation of all the attributes, including physique, strength, speed, Force, battle techniques, and the rest.This was a good attribute. It displayed his overall ability in one figure.\u2026After looking through everything, Wang Teng yawned. Exhaustion crept up his body, and he closed his eyes. Slowly, he slipped into dreamland\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMonday.The first day after he became a martial warrior!When Wang Teng woke up, he was still in a daze. After some time, the events of yesterday night flashed in his mind.\u201cSo I\u2019m a martial warrior now!\u201dWang Teng clenched his fist. Noticing the hidden strength in his body, he finally felt a sense of reality.Martial warriors absorbed Force into their bodies and used it to cultivate. This allowed their bones, muscles, and other parts of their bodies to undergo transformations. It couldn\u2019t be compared to martial disciples at all.But, in this martial arts era, becoming a martial warrior was just the start!Wang Teng got off his bed and went down to have breakfast.\u201cMom, is Dad not back yet?\u201dWang Teng stuffed an egg into his mouth at the dining table as he asked Li Xiumei curiously.1\u201cHe said that there were some bumps on a project, so he will be delayed for a few days,\u201d Li Xiumei replied as she ate her bird nest porridge.Wang Teng nodded. Since it was regarding the company, he didn\u2019t probe further.After he finished breakfast, Wang Teng drove his car to Donghai No. 1 High School.The university entrance exam was getting nearer and nearer. The atmosphere in school got increasingly nervous as the days went by. The students were studying hard for a promising future.Everyone said that the university entrance exam was the turning point in life.Many people scoffed at this remark. So what if you entered a good university after studying so hard? Wouldn\u2019t you still be working after you graduate? Wouldn\u2019t you still be earning a miserable three to six thousand salary?You would live frugally and save money for ten years. Then, when you wanted to buy a house and a car, you still had to take a bank loan!1Those that earned more than a hundred thousand or a few million a year were just the minority.All of them were star students from top universities!How could you compare with them?Tell me, how could you compare with them?2So, knowledge could change your life was just bullshit?Wrong!You would realize that if you didn\u2019t enter a university, your life would be even worse\u2026Lin Chuhan had come to school earlier than Wang Teng.In the past, Wang Teng just felt that she was hardworking. But now, he knew that she also worked part-time outside until late at night. Yet, she still woke up earlier than most people the next day to study.She deserved to be the star student!In his past life, Wang Teng was still an arrogant and frivolous young master. At his age, he would just snort at Lin Chuhan\u2019s actions.What was the use of studying so hard?After she graduated, the money she earned in her entire life couldn\u2019t even buy his sports car.However, after experiencing the collapse of the Wang family, Wang Teng finally realized how useless he was. Without the Wang family\u2019s backing, he was nothing.He was extremely useless!1Thus, when he saw Lin Chuhan studying so hard, he just sighed in his heart.Wang Teng didn\u2019t disturb her. He sat down on his seat, took out his cell phone, and logged in to Taobao\u2026He wanted to see if there were any specific containers to store his weapons.2Based on the performance of his system, Wang Teng felt that he would progress more comprehensively in the future. The number of battle techniques he would learn would only increase.He already had a battle sword and boxing gloves. There would be even more weapons as he progressed.It wasn\u2019t possible for him to hook everything on his body when he went out, right?Wang Teng scrolled through Taobao.Everything could be found on Taobao. Whatever you wanted, you could find it there.He typed the keywords, and a whole bunch of similar products appeared.However, most of them were sword sheaths, blade sheaths, and rod holders. It wasn\u2019t what Wang Teng wanted.After the morning self-study session ended, the first lesson of the day started. But Wang Teng was still scrolling through Taobao. He didn\u2019t have any thoughts of listening to the teacher.Lin Chuhan couldn\u2019t bear his nonchalant attitude. She frowned, but all she did was sigh in her heart. She didn\u2019t say anything.Suddenly, Wang Teng\u2019s eyes lit up as his gaze landed on an item.The stall owner: Weapon carrier casket?He looked at the design. This was a rectangular casket with a vintage style.Wang Teng then read the introduction. This weapon carrier casket was said to be able to contain 14 kinds of weapons. There was a mechanism on top. Once you pressed it, the weapon you needed would spring up.Is it really so amazing?He continued scrolling the listing. It was then Wang Teng realized that the 14 kinds of weapons mainly were blades and swords, including 14 different styles and lengths. He was caught between laughter and tears.Should I buy it or not?Wang Teng hesitated.Forget it. Let me ask the stall owner and see if I can customize one.This shop owner was called \u2018Master Lu\u2019. It was a gold crown flagship stall, and the reviews were all good.There were custom-made items in the reviews too.Hence, Wang Teng decided to open the chatbox and ask the shop owner.Wang Teng: Are you there?The stall owner: Yes, I\u2019m here (\u3065\u03043 \u0304)\u3065\u256d\u2764~1Wang Teng: Can you customize weapon carrier caskets here?The stall owner: Weapon carrier casket?Wang Teng: \u2026You don\u2019t know?The stall owner: Wait for a moment. Let me check.\u2026Wang Teng was a little speechless. This person didn\u2019t even know what he was selling in his shop. Was he reliable?After some time, the other party\u2019s reply finally came.The stall owner: Dear, are you there?The stall owner: I\u2019ve checked for you. So this is what you meant by weapon carrier casket.The person attached a picture with the message. It showed a wooden casket covered in dust in the corner of a warehouse.Wang Teng finally realized why this person couldn\u2019t remember this item.He asked curiously: How long has it been since you took this item out?The stall owner replied awkwardly: Hahaha, there\u2019s no need to care about the details. This weapon carrier casket was created by my grandfather in a moment of inspiration. No one wanted to buy it for a long time, so it was kept in the warehouse. I didn\u2019t expect someone to ask about it after so many years.Wang Teng: May I know how many years of history this item has?The stall owner: Not a lot. Only ten years!Ouch!\u00a0Wang Teng felt his teeth hurting. He continued: Alright, can you help me ask your grandfather if he could customize one for me based on my requirements?The stall owner: \u2026I\u2019m afraid not.??Wang Teng asked: Why not?The stall owner: I don\u2019t want to be on the same side as my grandfather so soon \u2044(\u2044\u2044\u2022\u2044\u03c9\u2044\u2022\u2044\u2044)\u20445Wang Teng felt a little helpless as he replied: I\u2019m sorryWang Teng: Forget it thenJust as he was about to go offline, the other party sent him a message hurriedly.The stall owner: Wait!He continued: If you\u2019re fine with it, you can tell me your thoughts. I\u2019ll see if I can make some customizations on top of this weapon carrier casket. If I can sell this away, I\u2019m sure that my grandfather will be happy.Wang Teng felt invigorated. \u201cOh!\u201dWell, let\u2019s make a Hail Mary effort!He explained his ideas to the other person.The other side remained silent for a long while before replying: Are you collecting weapon carrier caskets?1Wang Teng replied: You can say so.The stall owner: Alright, I will try my best. I will inform you once I finish the alterations.Wang Teng: What about the price?Wang Teng noticed that the other party was in a hurry to go offline to start his research on how to modify the weapon carrier casket without even talking about the price. He began to have a faint idea of this person\u2019s personality\u2026This must be an idiot!The stall owner: Oh, right. I forgot about that o(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)oHe thought for a moment before continuing.The stall owner: Since no one wants this, you can simply give me around 80 to 100 thousand for my labor fee.Wang Teng: Alright, as long as I\u2019m satisfied with the product, I will buy it for 100 thousand.Wang Teng didn\u2019t hesitate and agreed immediately.Those rune weapons cost hundreds of thousands and even millions. This weapon carrier casket was just a hundred thousand. It wasn\u2019t hard to accept the price.Also, he had many requirements, so he needed it to be custom-made. It was understandable that the fee was a little higher.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wang Teng found one that sounded more credible\u2014incubators to hatch the egg!2Before hatching the egg, Wang Teng planned to pay a visit to the pet shop to ask some questions.This egg wasn\u2019t ordinary!Wang Teng was afraid he would accidentally kill it. That would be a pity.The lives of two martial warriors were lost because of this egg.When the second lesson ended, during the break, Wang Teng said to Lin Chuhan, \u201cI have to leave. I have something to attend to. If the teachers ask, just tell them that I went to the hospital because of a stomach ache.\u201dAfter Wang Teng finished speaking, he rushed out of the classroom without waiting for Lin Chuhan\u2019s reply.\u201cThis fellow is actually skipping lessons!\u201d Lin Chuhan was furious. She glared at the door, but she couldn\u2019t do anything. Wang Teng was already gone.\u2026At the entrance of the school, a few gangsters were squatting and smoking at the roadside. They didn\u2019t look like the good sort. There were cigarette butts all over the ground.When Wang Teng drove his car out, the traffic light turned red, so he had to stop at the junction and wait.The gangsters were attracted by the sports car.\u201cTsk tsk, are the students from Donghai No. 1 High School all so wealthy? They can afford to drive a sports car.\u201d\u201cDamn it, why is he driving a sports car to school? What a showoff!\u201dThe bunch of hoodlums cursed and scolded Wang Teng out of jealousy.One of the younger gangsters saw Wang Teng in the driver\u2019s seat and suddenly remembered something. He shouted, \u201cBrother Bao, it\u2019s that fellow!\u201dUnfortunately, Wang Teng didn\u2019t hear him. The sports car gave off a loud roar and drove off straight forward.Zhao Gangbao saw the face on the driver\u2019s seat flashing past. He threw his cigarette on the ground and scolded, \u201cF**k, it\u2019s really that brat. I finally caught him. Why are you still standing here? Hurry up and chase him.\u201dWhile yelling, he dashed to the car parked at the side of the road. He started the engine at lightning speed and chased after Wang Teng.At the same time, he made a call.\u201cRing, ring, ring!\u201d\u201cHello?\u201d\u201cBrother, I\u2019ve found the fellow who hit me the last time. He\u2019s moving towards Tongming Street. Hurry up and go there. We can\u2019t beat him ourselves,\u201d Zhao Gangbao shouted at the person on the other end of the phone.\u201cAlright, continue following him. I will rush over immediately.\u201d The person on the other end seemed to be sighing.\u2026Almost simultaneously, in the vast sky more than ten kilometers away from Donghai City.As high as a thousand meters above sea level!An entirely black giant crow magnificently flew across the sky.It was more than 20 meters in length, and the feathers on its body gave off a cold metallic luster. The crow honestly looked like a battle plane. Its entire body screamed danger.The crow\u2019s eyes were bloodshot with a hint of killing intent in them.Its target was Donghai City!Boom!While flying, the speed of this gigantic crow suddenly accelerated exponentially and formed a loud explosion in the air. It shot towards Donghai City like a meteor.2\u2026Tongming Street, in a pet shop called \u2018Kitty Kitty\u2019.1After Wang Teng got some incubation knowledge from the staff at the pet shop, he felt that he finally had some confidence.He thanked the beautiful, but most importantly, enthusiastic and kind young lady at the pet shop before walking out.\u201cHe came out! He\u2019s out!\u201d Zhao Gangbao pointed at Wang Teng and said to a man beside him.Suddenly\u2014\u201cScreech!\u201dA screech that was loud enough to pierce the sky rang through the air.The man\u2019s expression changed, and he abruptly raised his head. At the same time, Wang Teng also looked up with a solemn expression. He gazed into the distance.High in the sky, a huge black creature was closing in rapidly. A shrill screech of a bird followed its flight downward.\u201cScreech\u2026!\u201dThe sound exploded in the sky. It became louder and even more ear-shattering as it neared. Its penetrating power was astonishing to behold, almost threatening to rupture their eardrums.Wang Teng felt his eardrums hurt. The passers-by on the street frowned and covered their ears.\u201cCrack! Crack! Crack\u2026\u201dThe shattering of glass all around was a testament to its sharpness.\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Teng\u2019s expression changed.The frightening soundwave had created an invisible shockwave. When it spread throughout the street, cracks appeared on the glass windows and glass doors of the shops. After some time, the glass couldn\u2019t hold up any longer and shattered.\u201cSlap!\u201dThe shattered glass shards flew towards the passers-by around the area.The young lady at the pet shop had just sent Wang Teng to the door when it suddenly exploded. A piece of palm-sized glass shard smashed down right on her forehead.Wang Teng reacted at once and yanked her away.At the same time, he trembled, and the energy in his body erupted. Wang Teng forced away all the broken glass shards flying towards him.The passers-by on the streets also dodged in a flurry. Some got hit and had scratches on their skins.Some suffered more grievous injuries. The sharp shards had stabbed into their bodies. They laid on the ground and were moaning in pain.Others lucky enough to escape the ordeal hurriedly ran far away. They could still sense the lingering fear in their hearts.\u201cWhere did this bird come from?\u201d\u201cWhy is it in the city?\u201d\u201cHurry up and call 120. Someone is injured!\u201d\u2026\u201cWhat a frightening bird. It must be a star beast!\u201d Wang Teng looked up.The bird was getting bigger and bigger in his vision. It was closing in on him rapidly from afar.\u201cThis isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s coming this way!\u201dWang Teng was shocked. His expression turned ugly, and he shouted at the young lady beside him, \u201cGet into the shop. Don\u2019t come out.\u201dAs he spoke, he hurriedly ran to the roadside and took out the battle sword from his car trunk. He wore the boxing gloves and flung the bag containing the egg on his shoulders. After finishing his preparations, Wang Teng rushed to the shop.\u201cScreech!\u201dThe giant crow seemed to have sensed something. Its speed accelerated once again as it shot towards Wang Teng even faster. Its shrill screech resounded in the air.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? Why is this bird attacking our Donghai City?\u201dBy now, the crowd had dispersed and ran away in all directions. Everyone was covering their ears and screaming in fear.The giant crow had arrived above Donghai City in a blink of an eye. It spread its wings apart and covered the whole sky. The bird then waved its wings, giving rise to violent winds.It plummeted down from the sky.\u201cF**k, did this bird come for me?\u201dWang Teng felt as though dark clouds were boring down on his head. When he raised his head, he was greeted with a pair of blood-red eyes.An endless evil aura crept up in his heart.Wang Teng was dumbstruck. His entire body froze, and he couldn\u2019t move at all.What should I do? What should I do?Why do I have to meet all these troublesome matters!Hurry up and move!Right\u2026He bit the tip of his lips until it bled.Once the sense of pain transmitted into his brain, Wang Teng finally regained control of his body. The Force in his body was activated, and it engulfed the battle sword.How unlucky!Even if I die, I will make sure you\u2019re heavily injured too!The battle sword was shrouded in intense red light, releasing the maximum potential of the fire Force. Wang Teng\u2019s hands were filled with perspiration as he stared at the giant crow.When it reached his attack range, he slashed his sword out.\u201cEvil beast!\u201d\u201cAudacious!\u201dAt this moment, a loud shout echoed in the air, accompanied by a green blade light. It extended from the roof of a building and cut the giant crow in mid-air.\u201cScreech!\u201dThe bird released a cry of pain.Slash!Once the blade light cut the giant crow, blood splattered everywhere, showering down on the onlookers below.However, the blade light did not fade away. Instead, it spread all the way to the horizon, even chopping the clouds in half.The massive corpse of the bird smashed down from the sky!It had all happened in an instant!Everyone was stunned. They stared at the sky in a daze with blank minds.\u201cSo powerful!\u201dThe man beside Zhao Gangbao was dumbstruck. He was muttering to himself.Wang Teng was clenching his sword, and his back was drenched with cold sweat. He didn\u2019t even have the time to execute his move\u2026He hadn\u2019t regained his senses even now. Confusion could be seen all over his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was what a real martial warrior should be like!One strike of his blade, and he was able to destroy everything a few hundred meters away from him. Compared to that person\u2026Wang Teng felt that he was so weak!He swiftly adjusted his confused expression.I\u2019m all ready. Even my posture is ready. Why did you do this to me!I feel so awkward!Fortunately, everyone\u2019s attention was attracted by the giant crow. In a state of panic, the crowd was busy looking for a place to hide. No one had paid him any attention.Wang Teng hurriedly kept his battle sword and boxing gloves. He stuffed the bag containing the egg into his car too.Then, he pretended that nothing had happened and looked at the spot where the giant bird had smashed into the ground.It wasn\u2019t far, almost ten meters away from him.The massive corpse of the bird laid right in the middle of the road. A few cars parked along the road had been squashed, and their alarms were blaring.A few road lamps had collapsed too. Sparks of electricity crackled and scared others from getting close.The passers-by had scattered far away. But they didn\u2019t forget to take out their cell phones to take photos and share them on their moments or Tiktok.\u201cThis crow is so big. It\u2019s frightening.\u201d\u201cIt was a martial warrior who helped out just now, right?\u201d\u201cIt must be. Only a martial warrior can deal with a giant beast like this.\u201d\u201cThe blade that struck all the way up to the sky stunned the entire Donghai City. I wish I was so powerful\u2026\u201dThe spectators started discussing among themselves. They felt admiration and envy towards the martial warrior who had executed the stunning blade light.Martial warrior!Martial warrior!This was a real martial warrior!During this martial arts era, who didn\u2019t want to become a martial warrior?But what was the use of just thinking about it?Many people were still blocked by an invisible wall. They didn\u2019t even have the right to step through the door.Even the advanced stage martial disciples standing at the edge of the door were no exception.The man beside Zhao Gangbao was one such example. At this moment, Wang Teng felt a little dumbfounded as he looked at the corpse of the giant crow.Would killing star beasts drop attribute bubbles?The answer was right in front of him. A few huge transparent bubbles were floating beside the giant crow.Although others couldn\u2019t see them, to Wang Teng, they were exceptionally conspicuous.He hurriedly squeezed through the crowd, pretending that he was curious about the bird. He got close to the attribute bubbles and touched them secretly.He picked them up!Speed*130Fire Force*35Blank Attribute*602Spiritual Sight*11\u2026What the f**k!What the f**k!What the f**k!Important things must be emphasized thrice!These attributes are amazing!\u00a0Wang Teng was on cloud nine, feeling as though he was floating.Three \u2018what the f**k\u2019 weren\u2019t enough to express the excitement in his heart at this moment.Speed*130!Gaining 130 points of speed attribute at once was honestly a little too much.When fire Force*35 seeped into his skin, the fire Force in his body increased tremendously. It surged through his body like a current.The feeling was incredible!Wang Teng continued looking down.Blank Attribute*601He was a little surprised.There were even blank attributes?What was their use? Could he use it to increase any of his attributes?Wang Teng decided to bring it back and investigate when free. After the update of his system, many changes started appearing slowly.Finally\u2026Spiritual Sight*1Wang Teng felt that something intriguing was happening to his eyes. A cold and icy stream was flowing in his eyes.If he was given a mirror, Wang Teng would be able to see a thin black film covering his eyes. It was eerily black.This is so interesting!But what\u2019s the use of this spiritual sight?He scanned his surroundings, but he couldn\u2019t notice anything special with his pair of eyes.Forget it. This is not the time to get to the bottom of this.How do I retract this ability?When Wang Teng thought about holding back the ability, the peculiar energy in his eyes seemed to have received a summon. It slipped into the depth of his eyes and went into hibernation.\u2026After some time, a group of people arrived at the scene. The crowd was dispersed, and the place was sealed off.\u201cThey\u2019re from the City Protection Bureau!\u201dThe newcomers wore black uniforms with a unique logo on them\u2014a cross of a blade and a sword. On their backs, there was a simple and unsophisticated picture of a shield.Someone quickly recognized who they were.The City Protection Bureau. Based on the name, one could tell that this was a special department erected to protect the human cities in this world.In this department, besides the office workers, all others possessed strong martial arts abilities. The presence of this group allowed normal humans to live peacefully in the cities.Many times, without the public knowing, they had solved a lot of troubles.The members of the City Protection Bureau carried the giant crow onto a huge truck and cleaned up the streets.They learned about the situation from the nearby spectators. They wanted to understand why this giant crow had suddenly invaded Donghai City.Unfortunately, no one was able to provide any relevant information. The onlookers were all talking in confusion. They just said that a powerful and mysterious martial warrior acted in the end. There was no helpful information given.In the end, the members of the City Protection Bureau left helplessly.Wang Teng stood among the crowd and watched them leave. He was in deep thought.That giant crow seemed to be here for me.But why?What grudges do we have? Why does it have to travel a thousand miles of wilderness to kill me?3Since Wang Teng couldn\u2019t find a reason, he gave up.8The beautiful young lady from the pet shop ran towards Wang Teng when she noticed that things had settled outside.On the other side, Zhao Gangbao saw the members of the City Protection Bureau leaving and spoke to the man beside him.\u201cBrother, the people from the City Protection Bureau have left. Let\u2019s catch that fellow quickly. If not, he will run away. I must take revenge for the kick he gave me in the past.\u201dThe guy remembered how he was kicked into the air at the Wild Rose Pub. He was also tricked by this brat and caught the wrong person. He felt happy for nothing.Anger instantly shot up right into his head.Zhao Gangbao was about to walk towards Wang Teng in his fury.\u201cSlap!\u201dUnexpectedly, the man beside Zhao Gangbao had slapped him on the head.\u201cCatch him? Catch your head!\u201d Zhao Ganghu was furious as he shouted at his brother.Zhao Gangbao was stunned. He looked at his brother blankly while muttering, \u201cBrother, why are you scolding me?\u201d\u201cF**k, you make me so angry that my mind is muddled!\u201dZhao Ganghu slapped Zhao Gangbao\u2019s head again.\u201cWhy are you hitting me again? Why are you angry?\u201d Zhao Gangbao was puzzled. He shrunk his head and asked with a pitiful look.\u201cI\u2019m angry because you\u2019re stupid! You are an idiot!\u201cDo you know who you\u2019ve offended?\u201cIf you want to die, don\u2019t pull me along. Why are you getting your brother in trouble?\u201dWhen Zhao Ganghu noticed that his brother still didn\u2019t know his mistake, he got even more infuriated. He wanted to vomit blood\u2026They had the same mother. Why was his brother so stupid?Hence, he raised his hand, wanting to slap his brother again.This time, Zhao Gangbao was prepared. He dodged the slap and shouted, \u201cBrother, even if I was to die, you must let me know the reason. What is it? Tell me clearly!\u201d\u201cOkay, let me tell you!\u201d Zhao Ganghu took a deep breath and continued, \u201cThat person is a martial warrior!\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201dZhao Gangbao was flabbergasted. However, he didn\u2019t believe it at all.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. He\u2019s so young. How can he be a martial warrior!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I saw it with my own two eyes.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, are you saying that I\u2019m blind?\u201dZhao Ganghu\u2019s angry words echoed beside Zhao Gangbao\u2019s ears. He was dumbstruck.\u201cForce\u2026 Martial warrior!\u201cThat brat is actually a martial warrior!!\u201cBut, when I met him the last time, he wasn\u2019t so powerful. He was at most an advanced stage martial disciple. How can he be a martial warrior!\u201dZhao Gangbao still couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cThe only explanation is that he was hiding his ability. He doesn\u2019t want to reveal his true power.\u201d Zhao Ganghu took a wild guess.\u201cHid his true power!\u201d Zhao Gangbao was shocked. Then, he asked curiously, \u201cWhat\u2019s his motive?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not something we should know. But, think about this. If you keep provoking a martial warrior, what is the consequence?\u201d Zhao Ganghu stared at his younger brother in exasperation.\u201cOh my God!\u201d Zhao Gangbao gasped in fear when he thought about this carefully.\u201cBrother, I\u2019ve offended him once. Will he kill me?\u201dThe thought of a certain possibility sent shivers down his spine.\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. But, it will be a hidden problem in the future!\u201d\u201cHow about this? You will follow me, and we will go and apologize to him now. Let\u2019s see if he can forgive you and let this matter end completely,\u201d Zhao Ganghu added after pondering for some time.Zhao Gangbao hesitated. He didn\u2019t dare to face Wang Teng.However, when he noticed that Zhao Ganghu was going to flare up again, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cOkay, I will apologize!\u201d1\u2026While Zhao Gangbao and his brother were guessing the consequences of provoking Wang Teng, the beautiful lady from the pet shop had arrived in front of Wang Teng.\u201cHello, thank you for helping me.\u201d The beautiful lady was a little shy as she raised her head and spoke to Wang Teng.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It\u2019s nothing. I have to thank you for answering all my queries. I went to many pet shops before I found someone who truly understands birds,\u201d Wang Teng smiled and replied.\u201cLet\u2019s exchange WeChat. If you have any questions, you can contact me directly in the future.\u201d The beautiful lady from the pet shop took the initiative.In the past, Wang Teng had never received such treatment.As expected, a hero saving a beauty was the ultimate move to win a lady\u2019s heart!But\u2026Exchanging WeChat\u2026 Am I someone who will add a lady\u2019s WeChat so easily? ( \u0304\u3078\u0304)2\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do that. I\u2019ll have to trouble you if I have questions later.\u201d Wang Teng took out his phone in a hurry.5They exchanged WeChat and asked for each other\u2019s names. Then, they changed the ID.The beautiful lady from the pet shop was called Lu Zhiqing. She said, \u201cThe shop is really busy today. I have to go back. Contact me on WeChat if you need anything.\u201d2\u201cSure!\u201dLu Zhiqing smiled and waved her hand. She ran back to the pet shop.Zhao Ganghu cautiously brought his good-for-nothing younger brother over when he noticed that Wang Teng had finished hooking the young lady.\u201cMister, please wait for a moment.\u201dWang Teng turned around upon the call. His eyes fell on Zhao Ganghu first and found him unfamiliar. Then, he looked at Zhao Gangbao, who was beside him.\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201dThe knowing smile and the meaningful tone caused Zhao Gangbao\u2019s heart to beat violently.Zhao Ganghu\u2019s heart also skipped a beat. He hurriedly pushed Zhao Gangbao forward.\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d Zhao Gangbao stuttered as he opened his mouth.Wang Teng lit a cigarette and suddenly replied, \u201cI have stopped being a boss for many years!\u201d\u2026What the hell was he saying?Zhao Gangbao was puzzled.Zhao Ganghu laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cYou must be joking. I\u2019m Zhao Ganghu. This is my bastard younger brother.\u201d\u201cMy younger brother failed to recognize who you are in the past and offended you. I brought him here today to apologize to you.\u201dThen, he shouted at Zhao Gangbao, \u201cHurry up and come over here to apologize to this mister.\u201dZhao Gangbao wanted to bow and apologize, but Wang Teng stopped him.\u201cWait, I\u2019m afraid that you didn\u2019t come to find me today to especially apologize, right? You have followed me for the entire trip. Do you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201d Wang Teng scoffed.Zhao Ganghu\u2019s expression changed. Zhao Gangbao even shivered in fright.\u00a0Oh my god, I am exposed!\u201cMr. Wang\u2026\u201d\u201cBang!\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t give him any chance to speak. The aura of a martial warrior exploded and surged towards Zhao Ganghu and his younger brother.Just now, he was playing a trick. He knew that someone was following him, but he didn\u2019t know the person\u2019s intention.Now, looking at Zhao Ganghu\u2019s expression, they were obviously looking for revenge just now. However, something had happened in the process and made them change their mind. That was why they came over to apologize.Could it be that they saw me using Force just now?Wang Teng stared coldly at the duo as he thought.Since they had come themselves, it was a chance for him to take care of them. This would prevent them from pestering him continuously in the future.Even though he wasn\u2019t afraid, it was still irritating to have a few nobodies crawling around him all the time.On the other side, in the face of the pressure given off by a martial warrior, Zhao Ganghu could only withstand it with all his might. He was extremely shocked.Indeed, he was a martial warrior!Zhao Gangbao\u2019s face turned pale, and he fell weakly to the ground. He couldn\u2019t even climb up.Aura!It sounded mysterious and profound, but it was just the pressure a powerful person could enforce on a weaker person.Wang Teng versus Zhao Ganghu, a martial warrior versus a martial disciple.The difference in ability was vast.The distance between them was obvious.That was why he felt a huge pressure.\u201cWe are willing to compensate you!\u201d Zhao Ganghu\u2019s forehead was filled with cold sweat. He gritted his teeth and opened his mouth with much effort.\u201cCompensate?\u201d Wang Teng pulled the corners of his lips.\u201cThere\u2019s five million in this card. This is our way of apologizing,\u201d Zhao Ganghu took out a bank card as he spoke.\u201cFive million.\u201dThe amount wasn\u2019t small. A normal person might not be able to save a million in his entire life. Yet, this was five million!However, Wang Teng was a damn rich second generation!He smiled gently and replied, \u201cDo I look like someone who needs five million?\u201dZhao Ganghu\u2019s heart dropped. It looked like this matter wouldn\u2019t be solved so easily. He forgot that the person didn\u2019t lack money.Would a person who drove a sports car lack money?3Zhao Ganghu\u2019s mouth tasted bitter. He really wanted to beat Zhao Gangbao to death on the spot. Why did he have to offend this malignant star?\u201cGive me one day. I will give you a satisfactory answer tomorrow.\u201dZhao Ganghu was decisive. Once he knew that five million couldn\u2019t solve this matter, he gave up and made another promise.\u201cAlright, I will wait for your news tomorrow.\u201dWang Teng nodded. He wasn\u2019t worried that the other party would run away.Although Donghai City wasn\u2019t small, it wasn\u2019t big either. It wasn\u2019t hard to find someone.He would meet him one day unless Zhao Ganghu was willing to forsake everything he had in Donghai City and run to other cities.Wang Teng believed that Zhao Ganghu wasn\u2019t so stupid.He shook his head when he saw Zhao Ganghu pulling Zhao Gangbao away.This Zhao Ganghu was just an advanced stage martial disciple. He was slightly older, but he was a character to take notice of. However, his younger brother\u2026He was utterly hopeless!This tiger and leopard siblings (in Chinese, \u2018Hu\u2019 means tiger and \u2018Bao\u2019 is leopard), the elder brother might be a tiger but the young brother might not be a leopard!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why was he so stupid? Why did he only link this up now?9The mother crow had come to look for her little crow!Damn it, no wonder it had a grudge against me and was dying to kill me. I abducted its child!1Wang Teng felt speechless.However, based on the ability of those two martial warriors, how were they able to steal the egg under the nose of this frightening gigantic crow?They had probably employed some special methods. They might have stolen the egg when the giant crow went out to look for food.Forget it. It\u2019s useless to think about this now.Wang Teng shook his head. Suddenly, he felt very fortunate.I was lucky that the mysterious martial warrior helped me. If not, the crow would definitely have killed me for revenge. Even if I didn\u2019t steal the egg, it\u2019s in my hands now. Who else can the giant crow look for?Wait, when that martial warrior executed his blade attack, did he leave any attribute bubbles behind?F**k, they were the attribute bubbles of a formidable warrior!1Wang Teng had a taste of how amazing the attributes dropped from the giant crow were. If that mysterious warrior dropped some attributes, it must be even more rewarding.He hurriedly turned his steering wheel and sped in the direction where the blade light had come from based on his memory.I must be on time!The car whisked through the traffic as Wang Teng prayed in his heart. Finally, he stopped in front of a commercial building.It should be here!Wang Teng got out of the car in a hurry. With a \u2018bang\u2019, the car door closed, and he rushed out like lightning.\u201cMister, may I know who you are looking for? Do you have an appointment?\u201dThe second the beautiful lady at the reception opened her mouth and asked, Wang Teng had already charged past her. He stopped in front of the lift.\u201cMister, this is a private company. Outsiders aren\u2019t allowed to enter for no reason.\u201d\u201cHurry up and stop him!\u201dA few security guards heard the shouts of the receptionist and dashed towards Wang Teng.\u201cBeep!\u201d The lift arrived just in time.\u201cStop right there!\u201d the security guards shouted from behind Wang Teng.Only an idiot would stop, though.Wang Teng leaped into the lift and pressed the close button frantically.The lift door slowly closed. The security guards were a step too late. They could only watch Wang Teng disappear in front of them.The guards had no choice but to chase after him using another lift.However, this time difference was enough.Wang Teng went up to the roof of the building and scanned the spacious roof. He noticed a bubble that was about to disappear.That\u2019s good; that\u2019s good.Wang Teng quickly walked over. However, just as he was prepared to pick it up, the bubble disappeared\u2026??Wang Teng froze on the spot, along with the smile on his face.It disappeared!It still disappeared in the end!His heart suddenly hurt so much!Wang Teng clutched his chest. This pain made him feel as though he had lost a few hundred million!It was so cruel!God, why do you have to be so cruel to me?\u201cSigh!\u201dWang Teng let out a long breath and walked to the edge of the roof. He lit up a cigarette and stood in the wind as it messed up his hair. He felt depressed and melancholy.At this moment, the security guards caught up with him. They were panting heavily.The moment they reached the roof, they saw Wang Teng standing at the edge with a look of despair on his face.They wanted to question this young man, but they forcefully swallowed the words that had already reached the corner of their lips.\u201cYoung man, if there\u2019s anything you need, we can talk properly. Can you come down first?\u201d one middle-aged bodyguard asked. He tried his best to make his voice gentler.\u201cYou don\u2019t understand. I just lost a few hundred million!\u201d Wang Teng sighed. His expression became even more depressed.A few hundred millions?Is this young man boasting?Don\u2019t say anything. If you stimulate him and he jumps down, you will be held responsible!The security guards exchanged glances with one another and completed a silent interaction.The middle-aged security guard continued, \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a few hundred million? You are still so young. You can earn it all back. Maybe you will be able to earn a billion or a few billion in the future. What is a few hundred million then?\u201dThe middle-aged men talked about a few billions so casually as if he was Jack Ma.2Wang Teng looked at him in shock. \u201cYou spoke about it so casually that I almost thought you were talking about paper money!\u201dThe middle-aged security guard laughed awkwardly.\u201cForget it. It\u2019s my luck to gain and my fate to lose.\u201dWang Teng sighed again.The security guards heaved sighs of relief when they saw that he had let the matter go. Yet, unexpectedly, the next second, Wang Teng jumped down.\u201cGoodbye, everyone!\u201dThe security guards stretched their hands out and screamed. They looked like the scene where Erkang was trying to catch Ziwei\u2026 (these two characters are from a classic Chinese melodrama)\u201cNo~\u201dSome of them even closed their eyes. They couldn\u2019t bear to look.But the tragedy didn\u2019t happen. The middle-aged security guard had rushed over when Wang Teng leaped up.He was an advanced stage martial disciple. However, he didn\u2019t have the chance to progress any further since he was already middle-aged. He could only make a living as the head of the security guards.His speed was faster than his fellows. He rushed to the edge of the roof and looked down.His eyes turned wide open.He saw Wang Teng landing lightly on the air conditioner outside the building. He was jumping down, level by level.Wang Teng saw the middle-aged security guard popping his head out, so he waved at him.Now, it was the middle-aged security guard\u2019s turn to stand at the edge of the roof and let the wind mess up his hair.1\u201cThis young man is not a simple person.\u201d\u2026Wang Teng left the commercial building with regret. He went to buy an incubator and then returned to school.It was already afternoon.All the students had gone to the cafeteria to have their lunch. Before he came back, he sent Xu Jie and his other friends a message on WeChat, telling them to save a portion of food for him.After finishing his lunch, there were two hours of afternoon break.The year three students were at their revision period now, so most students only rested for an hour. For the next hour, they revised and recited their textbooks.While Lin Chuhan was revising, Wang Teng wasn\u2019t sleepy. In fact, he was diligent, too, as he had started studying his attributes panel.Enlightenment: 83Spirit: 12.1Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (10/300) Beginner stage ice talent (12/300), Spiritual sight (beginner stage 1/10)1Force: 41/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)4/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red flame scripture (foundation 1/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 1/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (mastery for fist, sword, blade, footwork), gun skill (small achievement), fire kirin sword skill (foundation 10/100), phantom ice fist (foundation 8/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks)Overall Battle Power: 182Blank Attribute: 60His fire Force had increased tremendously. It was at 41 points now. Wang Teng could feel the fire Force in the Force nucleus of his body taking shape.The Force nucleus was situated at the bottom of his spine. It was where the Force was stored, the origin of its name.Because of the increase in his speed and fire Force, Wang Teng\u2019s overall battle power had increased to 182.This meant that his ability had been enhanced.Wang Teng had done his research. He knew that humans had a method to evaluate one\u2019s battle power.The battle power of a one-star soldier level martial warrior was between 100 to 300.From one-star to nine-star soldier level martial warrior, each rank could be split into the primary, middle, advanced, and peak phases.The primary phase was between 100 to 180, the middle phase was between 180 to 230, the advanced phase was between 230 and 280, and the peak phase was between 280 to 300.If the Overall Battle Power figure from the system was equivalent to the human\u2019s method of evaluation, it meant that Wang Teng was a one-star middle phase soldier level martial warrior.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At the moment, he was in a dilemma. How should he use this blank attribute?He scanned the attributes panel from top to bottom.Well, let\u2019s try one by one.Wang Teng started by adding some blank attributes to Enlightenment. The 83 points of Enlightenment jumped a little and became 83.1!Ratio 10:1.Wang Teng nodded to himself.He added some blank attributes to Spirit. Similarly, his spirit attribute increased by 0.1.It had a ratio of 10:1 too.Then, he added some attributes to his fire and ice talent. Both of them increased by one point.Ratio 1:1.When he reached his Spiritual Sight, he thought that the ratio would be the same. Wang Teng added 1 blank attribute point, but Spiritual Sight only increased by 0.1. The ratio was 10:1.Spiritual Sight is a more advanced talent?\u00a0Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but think this way.He continued experimenting. He realized that the Force at the bottom and all the Force skill scriptures, as well as the battle techniques, were all 1:1.However, he couldn\u2019t add any blank attributes to his Overall Battle Power.It looks like I have to raise the other attributes to increase my Overall Battle Power.\u00a0Wang Teng pondered.After the round of experiments, he had used up 11 blank attributes and was left with 49.Wang Teng contemplated for some time. He added 20 points to his fire Force and used the remaining 29 points on the Fire Kirin Sword Skill.1Specialization was better than knowing a little of everything.He had a limited number of blank attributes, so he could only upgrade one attribute as quickly as possible.Enlightenment: 83.1Spirit: 12.2Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Spiritual Sight (beginner stage 1.1/10)Force: 62/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)5/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red flame scripture (foundation 2/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 2/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (mastery for fist, sword, blade, footwork), gun skill (small achievement), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 40/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 9/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks)Overall Battle Power: 191Blank Attribute: 0He looked at the changes in his attributes panel and nodded in satisfaction.Blank Attribute is a good thing. I hope there\u2019s more of it!\u00a0Wang Teng exclaimed in his heart.However, he also knew that it wouldn\u2019t be easy to get so many blank attributes at once. That gigantic crow was extremely powerful. That was why it had dropped so many attributes.Such incidents relied on luck!If that mysterious martial warrior didn\u2019t appear, he would be dead. He wouldn\u2019t have the chance to pick up the attributes.He shouldn\u2019t wish for good luck to fall into his laps!Wang Teng shook his head and adjusted his mentality.In the afternoon.The first lesson in the afternoon was with their headteacher, Fan Weiming.He walked into the classroom and said sternly, \u201cStudents, the university entrance exam is two weeks away. You must use your time wisely for revision. But remember to rest properly too. Adjust your schedule and don\u2019t fall sick. When you go home, ask your parents to make good food for you. Eat nutritiously\u2026\u201cAlso, the Ministry of Education just released a statement. They said that there are some changes to the martial arts course exam.\u201dAll the students looked at him.Wang Teng suddenly got more interested when he heard this.There would be changes made to the university entrance exam every year. He wondered what these changes were this year.Also, it was related to the martial arts course exam.Fan Weiming opened his mouth under everyone\u2019s anticipated gazes. \u201cThere will be an increased enrollment for the martial arts course this year. Intermediate stage martial disciples can also participate in the martial arts course exam now.\u201d\u201cIncreased enrollment!\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cIntermediate stage martial disciples can participate too? Does that mean that I have a chance to get into the martial arts course?\u201dMany students were excited, especially those that had reached the intermediate stage. They virtually danced with joy.The beginner stage martial disciples were in low spirits, though.There were only five advanced stage martial disciples in Donghai No. 1 High School. But, there were many beginner stage and intermediate stage martial disciples.This was a huge piece of good news for intermediate stage martial disciples.The university entrance exam was a turning point in life.If they joined the martial arts course, they would be able to enjoy more resources. This would give them a higher chance of becoming martial warriors in the future.In the past, many people were unable to become advanced stage martial disciples before turning 20. Hence, they couldn\u2019t get into the martial arts course and couldn\u2019t become martial warriors.This year, the martial arts course was increasing the quota. Their chance was finally here.How could they not be excited!\u201cAlright, settle down. Wait for me to finish speaking.\u201d Fan Weiming clapped his hands.The students gradually became silent. They looked at Fan Weiming.Fan Weiming said, \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone who wants to apply for the martial arts course, remember to register with me at my office within this week. The dean\u2019s office needs to compile the number and send it to the Ministry of Education.\u201cYou will only be given your identity card for the exam if you register. Without this identity card, you will not be able to take the martial arts course exam. Please remember this.\u201dHe paused for a second before continuing.\u201cHowever, there\u2019s one thing you need to inform your parents clearly. There\u2019s an actual combat assessment with a certain risk.\u201cThe internet is well-developed, so all of you probably know that there\u2019s a particular risk. However, you might not have an idea how high the risk will be.\u201cLet me tell you then. There\u2019s a specific death rate for the actual combat assessment. If the death rate doesn\u2019t exceed this benchmark, the authorities won\u2019t take any notice of it. That means that if you die, you will just be dead.\u201cThus, if you are not confident, don\u2019t have the idea of leaving things to chance. I\u2019d rather you repeat a year and take the exam next year.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ve said everything. Prepare your textbooks. We are starting our lesson.\u201dFan Weiming gave the students some time to digest the news after he finished speaking.As expected, the students below started discussing in hushed voices.\u201cThere\u2019s a death rate? I always thought that you would get injured at most.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve asked a senior before. He said that no deaths have occurred for the past two years. Was he lying to me?\u201d\u201cMaybe not. Even if there weren\u2019t any deaths for the past two years, what about the earlier years?\u201d\u201cI should go back and research carefully. If there\u2019s a death rate, I need to consider it carefully.\u201dSome students were frowning. The happiness a moment ago had subsided a little.\u201cAh\u2026 If I want to participate in the martial arts course exam, I need to start doing my \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019. There are only two weeks left. There\u2019s not enough time!\u201d someone suddenly shouted.\u201cOh right. I haven\u2019t started reading the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019. How am I supposed to take the exam?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re making it difficult for us. Why didn\u2019t they inform us earlier\u2026\u201dThe topic got steered in another direction. A moment ago, they were still worried about the death rate. Now, they were all stumped by the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019.Wang Teng shook his head. It was just an increase in seats. That had nothing to do with him. His current ability was enough to deal with the university entrance exam.\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Teng suddenly turned his head. He noticed that Lin Chuhan\u2019s emotions seemed a little weird.Her eyes were shimmering, but there was hesitation and fear on her face.\u201cClass Monitor Lin, are you an intermediate stage martial disciple?\u201d3Wang Teng thought of a possibility. He couldn\u2019t help but ask her, \u201cAre you thinking of applying for the martial arts course too?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She glared at him as she said, \u201cI can\u2019t?\u201d\u201cNope. I always thought that you will move down the scholar path,\u201d Wang Teng replied innocently.\u201cAfter all, this is the martial arts era. We can foresee that the uses of martial arts will become greater and greater. Its influence will seep into every aspect of society. The change for this year\u2019s university entrance exam is a signal. Thus, even if I go with the scholar path, I don\u2019t want to forgo my martial arts.\u201d Lin Chuhan analyzed objectively.\u201cYou make sense.\u201d Wang Teng nodded.\u201cYou should be participating in the martial arts course exam, right?\u201dLin Chuhan gave Wang Teng a meaningful look. From his recent performance, she was around 90% certain that he would take the martial arts exam even though she couldn\u2019t confirm it.Wang Teng just smiled.Lin Chuhan didn\u2019t probe further. However, in her heart, she already had her answer.No wonder he didn\u2019t place much emphasis on his studies.However, the martial arts exam had a written portion too. The \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 was a must-read. Did he have enough confidence?She still had some doubts. But, once she remembered the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019, she frowned uncontrollably.\u201cWhat do you think the Ministry of Education is thinking? Why did they release this news at the last moment? Many intermediate stage martial disciples haven\u2019t read the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 properly. They have no hope in passing the exam.\u201d1\u201cHow would I know? The way these powerful people think is always peculiar.\u201d Wang Teng shook his head.At this moment, a young man in front of them suddenly turned his head and jumped into their conversation.\u201cHehe, I heard that it\u2019s related to the policies by the World Federation!\u201d\u201cWorld Federation\u2019s policies?\u201dWang Teng and Lin Chuhan exchanged glances with each other. This involvement was a little far-fetched.\u201cYang Jian, how do you know this?\u201d Wang Teng asked the young man.1Yang Jian wanted to perform in front of Lin Chuhan, so he turned his body and explained in a proud manner, \u201cMy uncle works at the Ministry of Education. A month ago, I heard this piece of news from him. I\u2019ve been reading the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 recently.\u201d\u201cF**k, you have connections!\u201d Wang Teng laughed and scolded him.Wang Shengguo had also gotten some wind of this, but he thought that since Wang Teng had just started training, he had no hope of taking the exam this year. Hence, he didn\u2019t tell Wang Teng.Lin Chuhan felt a little speechless and helpless.This was the difference between an average student and someone like Yang Jian. Yang Jian received the news one month earlier, but she had to wait for the school\u2019s notice. She got her information too late.No matter what era it was, information was always the most worthy.Yang Jian didn\u2019t take it to heart. He smiled and said to Wang Teng, \u201cYoung Master Wang, you\u2019re the one with the most connections. Why are you teasing me?\u201dThen, he looked at Lin Chuhan\u2019s expression and guessed her thoughts. He hurriedly consoled her.\u201cClass monitor, don\u2019t worry too much. Since the authorities released the information at this time, they must understand the students\u2019 plight.\u201cI\u2019ve also heard that the normal exam\u2019s difficulty and results will be lowered. It might be the lowest among all the previous years.\u201dWang Teng instantly smiled at Lin Chuhan. \u201cYou heard him. It means that there\u2019s much hope this year. Don\u2019t put on that face anymore.\u201cAlso, with your top student\u2019s brain, the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 is just a piece of cake for you.\u201dLin Chuhan rolled her eyes at Wang Teng. She then replied to Yang Jian, \u201cThank you for telling me this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome; you\u2019re welcome. Even if I didn\u2019t tell you, you\u2019d have heard it soon. Since they released this policy, they won\u2019t be able to hide some information from the public.\u201d Yang Jian waved his hands.\u201cAlright, students, ten minutes of discussion is up. If you continue talking, I won\u2019t need to start my lesson anymore.\u201d Fan Weiming knocked on the blackboard.The students immediately sat up straight. The teacher\u2019s dignity was not to be messed with.\u2026For the entire afternoon, everyone was immersed in the piece of news their teacher gave them. The moment class ended, they started a huge discussion.Some students went to take a look at their neighboring class. They were talking about this too.After the lesson, some students took the chance to call their families and ask their parents to get some insider\u2019s news. Others asked their parents for opinions.The martial arts exam was extremely important!Many parents skipped work once they received their child\u2019s call and started hunting around for news.They found their relatives and used all the connections they had.When a family had a child taking the university entrance exam, they would always be the focal point of the family\u2026The three afternoon lessons soon ended. It was time to go home.Wang Teng looked at Lin Chuhan, who was packing her bag beside him. \u201cMiss class monitor, shall I send you home?\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201d Lin Chuhan replied in a hurry.She was afraid that if she replied a little late, she would be pulled into his car forcefully. She kept thinking that this fellow had some motive towards her. He didn\u2019t restrain himself as he did in the past.\u201cYour choice.\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t mind. He got up and prepared to leave. But, he thought for a moment and said, \u201cSince you want to take the martial arts exam, you shouldn\u2019t work part-time for the next two weeks. Time is a little tight. You should use it wisely and look through the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019. If you face any difficulties, as your table buddy, don\u2019t forget to look for me.\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t give her a chance to refute as he left the classroom directly.In an instant, Lin Chuhan felt warmth spreading in her heart. She shook her head and scolded.\u201cThis fellow is seducing me again!\u201d6\u2026Wang Teng, Xu Jie, and Bai Wei met one another at the school gate. They already knew about the increased enrollment quota. Even Bai Wei and Yu Hao, who were in the second year, knew about it.Bai Wei and Yu Hao were excited.After all, they still had one year. Becoming an intermediate stage martial disciple was much easier than becoming an advanced stage martial disciple. Their chances were high.Especially for Bai Wei, even if she had never practiced martial arts before, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem for her to become an intermediate stage martial disciple in a year. The Bai family just needed to provide her with more resources.Xu Jie was a little dejected, though. The increased enrolment for martial arts courses was cruel to those who didn\u2019t practice martial arts. They felt that they had no chance.Becoming an advanced stage martial disciple might be a little tricky, but if Xu Jie practiced diligently, he still had hopes of becoming an intermediate stage martial disciple.Unfortunately, there was no medicine for regret in this world!1Opportunities were given to those who were prepared. He was destined to miss the chance this year.Wang Teng thought for a moment. \u201cXu Jie, maybe you can repeat the year. Go home and discuss it with your parents.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, we were persuading him to repeat a year too.\u201d Yu Hao agreed with Wang Teng.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, do you really think I should repeat a year?\u201d Xu Jie raised his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not what I think. It\u2019s what you want,\u201d Wang Teng replied.\u201cI\u2026 let me go home and ask my parents first,\u201d Xu Jie hesitated for a moment before saying.Wang Teng didn\u2019t reply to him. After all, the final decision was up to the guy.After everything he had experienced recently, Wang Teng knew that the martial arts path wasn\u2019t easy\u20261Should he practice martial arts?Was it right or wrong to practice martial arts?Would he regret it in the future?No one could provide Xu Jie the answer. He had to walk the path personally to know if it was right or wrong, or whether he would regret it or not.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXu Jie and his friends were a little depressed because of the martial arts exam.Reading the atmosphere, Bai Wei hurriedly changed the topic. \u201cDo you know that Zhou Baiyun sent someone to investigate Mount Bao\u2019an again today?\u201d\u201cOh, what did they find?\u201d Wang Teng asked indifferently.This was in accordance with his expectations.Smart people were easily curious. Zhou Baiyun was the kind of person who felt that she was smart.She didn\u2019t receive an answer yesterday night, so she would definitely investigate again.\u201cWu Yuan said that they found traces of a battle in a forest patch. Based on the strength, it might be a fight between martial warriors,\u201d Bai Wei said.\u201cMartial warriors!\u201dXu Jie and Yu Hao were shocked.\u201cThere were burnt marks at the scene and some frozen plants too. They must have been destroyed by Force,\u201d Bai Wei nodded and said.\u201cThere were martial warriors? Luckily, Brother Wang Teng didn\u2019t find them. If not, he would have been in danger,\u201d Xu Jie said.Wang Teng nodded.\u201cOh right, who\u2019s Wu Yuan?\u201d Yu Hao suddenly asked Bai Wei curiously.\u201cShe\u2019s a young lady I met at the mountain villa yesterday. She\u2019s really gossipy and extremely well-informed. She\u2019s talkative too, so she sent me a message on WeChat the moment she heard the news.\u201d Bai Wei couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cWhat else did she say?\u201d Wang Teng asked.\u201cShe also said that after Zhou Baiyun arrived, the members from the City Protection Bureau arrived too. However, they didn\u2019t seem to have discovered anything. The two martial warriors probably left after fighting,\u201d Bai Wei continued.Wang Teng was in deep thought. It looked like Bai Wei only knew some surface news. She probably didn\u2019t know any exact details.They chatted for some time before parting at the entrance of the school. The group returned to their homes.\u2026When Wang Teng reached home, he noticed a few strangers. Wang Shengguo had come back from his work trip and was conversing with these people.The City Protection Bureau!I didn\u2019t expect them to find me so quickly!Wang Teng\u2019s heart skipped a beat, but there were no changes to his expression. He walked into the living room and asked, \u201cDad, you\u2019re back. These people are?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Wang Shengguo nodded. He then frowned slightly as he replied, \u201cThey\u2019re from the City Protection Bureau. They came to ask you a few questions. Did you cause trouble again?\u201dWang Teng immediately felt wronged. \u201cHow can I cause trouble? I\u2019ve been obediently practicing martial arts and going out with my friends recently. What trouble can I cause!\u201d\u201cMr. Wang, don\u2019t worry. This is just a routine check.\u201dA young man waved his hand and stood up. He asked Wang Teng, \u201cYou\u2019re Wang Teng, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the leader of the No. 3 small team of the City Protection Bureau, Chai Yu.\u201d The young man introduced himself. \u201cWe came today because we wanted to ask you about what happened yesterday night on Mount Bao\u2019an,\u201d\u201cOh, okay. So you came for that matter. No problem, ask along. I will tell you everything I know.\u201d Wang Teng pretended to know everything.Chai Yu asked a few questions, and Wang Teng replied to him with the answers he had prepared beforehand. No loopholes could be found in his story.Especially when he mentioned that he had no sense of direction, Wang Shengguo laughed and added, \u201cI\u2019m not worried about you laughing at him. This brat has been bad with directions ever since he was a child. Fortunately, we have GPS now. If not, I\u2019m really worried that he will get lost one day.\u201d\u201cAlright, thank you for your cooperation. Sorry for the inconvenience caused today.\u201dSince Chai Yu didn\u2019t receive any relevant information, he got up and left.After the members of the City Protection Bureau departed, Wang Shengguo used his finger and pretended to tap Wang Teng\u2019s forehead.Wang Teng chuckled. \u201cDad, you cooperated well!\u201d\u201cStop teasing me.\u201d Wang Shengguo flared up once there were no strangers. \u201cFrom now on, be obedient and stop causing trouble.\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t explain what had happened, so Wang Shengguo just warned him and didn\u2019t probe further.Li Xiumei placed the dishes on the table and called the father and son for dinner.\u2026Chai Yu was sitting in a car. The staff driving the car asked, \u201cBrother Chai, how much truth do you think there is in the young boy\u2019s words?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say.\u201dChai Yu frowned. \u201cBased on the chemical examination of the site, the martial warriors who were fighting are already dead. There should have been a third party at the scene.\u201cFrom Li Rongcheng\u2019s statement, we know that Wang Teng isn\u2019t weak. He\u2019s probably an advanced stage martial disciple now.\u201cBut, it\u2019s impossible for an advanced stage martial disciple to kill two martial warriors.\u201d\u201cHence, it should have nothing to do with him. He probably saw the fight and got scared, so he didn\u2019t dare to tell the truth.\u201d1The driver also made his guess. \u201cIs it possible that the two martial warriors perished together and he reaped their benefits?\u201d\u201cAre you reading too many novels? If there\u2019s such a lucky thing, why didn\u2019t it happen to me?\u201d Chai Yu rolled his eyes.1\u201cHaha, Brother Chai, don\u2019t you know that this plot is popular nowadays? It feels good when you read it!\u201d The driver laughed.1\u201cJust focus on the road.\u201dChai Yu laughed and scolded him. Then, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cSigh. Li Rongcheng and Wang Teng are both advanced stage martial disciples. There is a chance that they will become martial warriors in the future. The Li family and Wang family are not ordinary families. Their lives are really good.\u201cAlso, the possessions of the martial warriors have disappeared and their cell phones are gone. We don\u2019t know their identities. And we don\u2019t even have a clue where to start investigating. This will probably become an unsolved case.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Ever since we got linked to the Xingwu continent, it\u2019s getting hard to count the deaths and disappearances of martial warriors,\u201d the staff lamented.1\u2026After dinner ended, Wang Teng carried the backpack with the egg back into his bedroom when his parents were not looking.He took out the egg and placed it in the incubator. He switched the incubator on and let it incubate the egg slowly.Then, he laid on his bed and placed his head on his hands.He was in a daze for some time. Then, he suddenly leaped out of bed and took out a mirror.Wang Teng looked at the mirror and activated his Spiritual Sight. He saw a thin layer of black film covering his pupils\u2026It\u2019s as if I\u2019m wearing cosmetic contact lenses.Huh? There\u2019s a spot of red light deeper in my eyes!Oh my god, why do they look a little like crow\u2019s eyes!Wang Teng observed his eyes carefully and immediately felt frustrated. Did they really turn into crow\u2019s eyes?Sigh, I wonder what kind of talent Spiritual Sight is?With a sigh, Wang Teng scanned his room. When he saw the egg on the incubator, his gaze suddenly stopped.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dWhen his Spiritual Sight was activated, the egg turned entirely red, as though it was a ball of burning flame.\u201cFire Force!\u201dCould it be that the use of Spiritual Sight is to allow me to see Force?1Wang Teng had a mind-blowing thought.This might be the talent that allowed the crow to find Donghai City. That was how it was able to lock in on him.This talent came from the giant crow. Compared to it, his talent was a weaker version. There was plenty of room to develop it further.\u201cHowever, this talent is not bad. I can see the Force through my eyes, so I can predict how strong or weak other martial warriors are!\u201d Wang Teng muttered to himself.1Wang Teng was burning with eagerness. He experimented with the talent for a long time until he felt his eyes turning sore and his head getting heavy. He had no choice but to deactivate his Spiritual Sight.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I feel a little dizzy!\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201dWang Teng was a little surprised. He fished out the attributes panel and looked at the Stats section. There was an (over-consumption) behind the attribute.Spiritual Sight consumes spirit!It looks like I can\u2019t use it recklessly.Wang Teng rested for a while before the dizziness gradually disappeared.\u201cI only know that Spiritual Sight can help me see the Force. I wonder if it has other abilities.\u201d2Wang Teng pondered for a moment and decided that he would pay more attention to it in the future. Spiritual Sight talent was very promising. He must focus on it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Presence EnlightenmentAfter studying his spiritual sight for some time, he had digested almost all the food in his stomach.Wang Teng got up and climbed down the stairs. On the way, he greeted his parents.\u201cDad, Mom, I\u2019m going to the martial arts academy.\u201dWang Shengguo had just come back from his business trip. He didn\u2019t go back to his office tonight. One reason was that he wanted to rest at home and the other was to spend more time with his wife.At this moment, he was watching the television with Li Xiumei in the living room.When they reached an interesting part, he would discuss with Li Xiumei how outdated the storyline was. The way he was acting now was no different from the millions of ordinary men in this world.When he heard Wang Teng\u2019s voice, Wang Shengguo waved his hand without even bothering to turn his head.\u201cMove aside. Don\u2019t interrupt us while watching the television! This is the climax!\u201d\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t!\u201d Wang Teng rolled his eyes and beat a hasty retreat.Li Xiumei patted Wang Shengguo once and shouted in a hurry, \u201cSon, what do you want to eat tonight? I will make supper for you.\u201d\u201cAnything is fine, Mom. You can cook whatever is available. I\u2019m going now!\u201dWang Teng\u2019s voice came from outside the door. Then, the rumble of a sports car engine was heard.Jixin Martial House.Wang Teng parked his car and walked along the small pathways in the martial arts academy. On the way, he thought to himself,\u00a0Let\u2019s go straight to the third floor today. Some people already know that my strength has exceeded an intermediate stage martial disciple. There\u2019s no point in hiding it anymore. However, I should drag the news that I\u2019ve become a martial warrior for a little longer.Sigh, rising too quickly is vexing!Actually, Wang Teng never expected himself to become a martial warrior so quickly either. He thought he would have to wait until the university entrance exam was over.Accidents always came so abruptly!It caught him off guard!Wang Teng stood in front of the martial disciple training building and glanced at the martial warrior training building beside it. He heaved a deep sigh, as if lamenting the unfairness of the world like an old man.Within sight but beyond reach!Wang Teng walked into the building and quietly finished his test. The identification information changed automatically, and he received the right to move to the third floor.He didn\u2019t forget to finish a round on the first and second floor, picking up dropped attributes. Wang Teng then headed to the third floor.The staircase leading to the third floor was situated in a conspicuous location.Wang Teng didn\u2019t want to be in the spotlight, but he still attracted everyone\u2019s attention the moment he stepped on the stairs.\u201cWang Teng, I didn\u2019t expect you to become an advanced stage martial disciple so quickly!\u201d Some familiar students came forward and started praising him.Their tone was full of envy!The longer one trained as a martial disciple, the harder the path got.Many students here had been stuck at the martial disciple intermediate stage for a long time. They never managed to break through the doors to become an advanced stage martial disciple. It was sorrowful, to say the least.\u201cSigh, Zhang Shaoyang became an advanced stage martial disciple. Now, another one is leaving.\u201d\u201cI heard that the Ministry of Education underwent a reform this year. Intermediate stage martial disciples can also take part in the martial arts exam now. But, it has nothing to do with us.\u201d\u201cDamn it! Why didn\u2019t this reform take place earlier\u2026\u201dThe moment the news of an increase in enrolment for the martial arts course was released, it spread like wings throughout the city. Everyone that should know about it had heard of it.Most of the intermediate stage martial disciples present were adults practicing martial arts as part of their job. Their average age was quite high. As a result, they were unable to take part in the university entrance exam.They weren\u2019t the same as the students in school. Even if the students were intermediate stage martial disciples, they still had the chance to climb up the social ladder in the future.But, to them, this piece of news wasn\u2019t good. Instead, it was a huge blow!Some people were born in the wrong era and missed many good opportunities!Time was not on their side, so what could they do?\u201cJust work hard. There will be opportunities for you.\u201d Wang Teng nodded at the student and went up to the third floor.\u201cThat\u2019s right. There will be opportunities!\u201dThe student clenched his fist tightly, and the fighting will in his eyes lit up again. He was just a little past 20. It was too early to give up now.Among the crowd, a fatty was watching Wang Teng\u2019s pretentious back view as he left. He cursed in his heart.\u00a0I knew it. I knew that this fellow must be hiding his true abilities. If not, how could he run faster than me or become an advanced stage martial disciple so quickly? This is so dishonest of him.On the third floor, there were obviously fewer people as compared to the second floor. From the first floor to the third floor, the numbers would sharply dwindle. This was a good example of the pyramid concept.Wang Teng\u2019s arrival caused many people to pause their training and turn around to glance at him.\u201cHe\u2019s so young!\u201d\u201cAnother genius!\u201d\u201cHmph, genius?\u201d\u2026Wang Teng scanned his surroundings. The floor was littered with attribute bubbles and there was a bunch of two-legged sheep for him to collect furs from\u2026It felt so good!At this time, Zhang Shaoyang, who had just become an advanced stage martial disciple, walked over. He sized up Wang Teng with a strange gaze.\u201cWang Teng, your progress is a little scary!\u201d\u201cI started practicing martial arts at a young age. I\u2019ve been stuck at the intermediate stage for some time. I was just waiting for an opportunity,\u201d Wang Teng smiled and replied.Zhang Shaoyang had a look of enlightenment. He placed his arm around Wang Teng\u2019s shoulder and took him inside.\u201cCome, come. Since you\u2019re here, there\u2019s finally someone who can spar with me using fist skills.\u201d\u2026The entire night, Wang Teng collected all the attribute bubbles on the third floor. It was another round of huge gains.In total\u2014Enlightenment*5Spirit*6Strength*153Speed*66\u2026Currently, Wang Teng was more focused on increasing his points for Enlightenment and Spirit. However, these two attributes were rare as always.He had researched online before. Force skill scriptures and Force battle techniques were more profound. Hence, they had a higher demand for Enlightenment.If one\u2019s Enlightenment value was high, they would yield twice the result with half the effort when practicing the scriptures and battle techniques. If the Enlightenment was low, they would experience what despair felt like.Wang Teng was able to collect attributes to improve his scriptures and battle techniques. However, martial warriors were rare. Even more, they wouldn\u2019t congregate together like the martial disciples. He wouldn\u2019t be able to collect rounds and rounds of attributes as he did with the martial disciples.Thus, when there were attributes, he would collect them. When there was nothing to be picked, he had to rely on his own practice!Increasing his Enlightenment was considered saving for a rainy day!However, Wang Teng was lucky that he was able to increase his Enlightenment by collecting attributes.Many a little made a mickle. If he slowly collected them, he believed that his Enlightenment would increase.He was different from others. If other people had low Enlightenment, there was nothing they could do besides feeling despair.As for Spirit, it was related to the endurance time of his Spiritual Sight ability. This ability might prove really important in the future. He should increase the capacity of his spirit battery as quickly as possible.Besides all these, he had collected many Basic Footwork, Basic Fist Skill, Basic Sword Skill, and Basic Blade Skill attributes today.Now, these battle techniques were charging towards another stage above the mastery stage.The next stage after mastery was \u2018presence enlightenment.\u2019Presence enlightenment was the last stage of a basic battle technique. At this stage, one would comprehend the powerful aura behind the skill. When fighting with someone, the frightening presence of the skill would be felt first, overwhelming the other party.Subduing the enemy without a fight!This was the use of presence.However, few would spend a huge amount of time practicing their basic battle techniques to this stage. If they had the time and energy, they would rather work towards becoming a martial warrior and cultivate Force battle techniques.But Wang Teng didn\u2019t mind. All he needed to do was pick up the attributes. It would be a waste if he didn\u2019t collect them.Also, if he practiced his foundation well, it would be beneficial to his cultivation of Force battle techniques in the future. After all, a skyscraper was only possible if the foundations were solid.Besides the basic battle techniques he already possessed, Wang Teng picked up a new basic technique\u2014Basic Stick Skill (foundation)!Stick skill!Not bad, not bad\u2026 Do I have to find a golden cudgel or an iron polearm in the future?[1]Then, I will shout out loud\u2014Hey, demon, let go of my master![2][1] [Annotation text missing][2] [Annotation text missing]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: This\u2026 Drama King!It was an exciting night of collecting sheep furs\u2014wait, it was a night of training!Wang Teng finished picking up the last attribute bubble and came out of the Jixin Martial House. He drove his car along the seaside highway on his way home.Jixin Martial House was situated beside the sea. There was a highway following the coastline. At night, there weren\u2019t many cars on this road.Under the dark night sky, the place seemed exceptionally quiet and secluded.Wang Teng was the last to leave again. The other students of the martial arts academy had already gone home much earlier.The music in the car was turned on, and the vibrant and loud music dispersed the silence in the surrounding\u2026Tonight, I watch the snow fluttering in the cold nightMy heart is cold as I travel far awayI ran in the wind and the rain, not able to differentiate the figures in the mistThe sky and the sea, you and meWill we change\u2026\u2026Screech\u2026The friction between the tires and asphalt broke the calmness of the silent night. The relaxing atmosphere created by the music was gone.Wang Teng had managed to stop his car just in time. His body flung forward because of inertia, but as a martial warrior, his control over his body was exceptional. He forcefully remained in his seat.The high beam lit up the scene in front. A large fallen tree was blocking the road ahead. At the same time, there was a human figure sitting on a branch of the large tree. He couldn\u2019t make out the figure clearly.Wang Teng frowned.It looked like this person had come bearing ill intent. He seemed to be targeting him.Just as Wang Teng was about to get out of his car, he suddenly thought of something and activated his Spiritual Sight.A ball of bright light like a 50-watt incandescent lamp appeared in his vision\u2026Force!Martial warrior!Wang Teng\u2019s heart skipped a beat. Why was a martial warrior looking for him? Who was he? What motive did he have\u2026A pile of questions filled up his heart.However, comparing the intensity of the light he saw using his Spiritual Sight and the light on himself, he had nothing to be afraid of, even if they were to fight.Wang Teng took out his battle sword and wore his boxing gloves. Then, he got out of the car slowly.\u201cHand over the item!\u201d The man looked at Wang Teng and opened his mouth.\u201cWhat item? I don\u2019t think I know you!\u201d Wang Teng curiously asked.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you know me or not. However, if you hand over the item you took from Mount Bao\u2019an, I can spare your life,\u201d said the person coldly.\u201cWhat item? What Mount Bao\u2019an? Why don\u2019t I understand what you are saying?\u201d Wang Teng\u2019s heart dropped.How did this person know that he had taken something?The person snorted. He stood up and walked towards Wang Teng. \u201cYou don\u2019t know? In that case, where did you get the sword and boxing gloves in your hands?\u201d\u201cI bought them,\u201d Wang Teng replied indifferently.When the other party came closer, Wang Teng finally saw his appearance. This was a man around 30 years old. There was no distinguishing feature on his face, but his eyes were like that of a lone wolf. He didn\u2019t look like a kind person by any means.\u201cYou\u2019re at the brink of death, you know. Why are you still being stubborn?\u201d The man waved his cell phone. \u201cAll the members of our team installed a GPS tracking system in our phones. You hid it well by destroying their corpses and all traces left. After all, dead men tell no tales. Unfortunately, you were stupid enough to bring their cell phones back.\u201dDamn it, I didn\u2019t even expect a tracking system to be installed in the cell phones. I was too careless!\u00a0Wang Teng scolded himself in his heart.\u201cDo you have nothing to say now? Tell me where the item is, and I will spare your life.\u201cI don\u2019t mind telling you that I\u2019m a martial warrior. You\u2019re just a martial disciple. Even if you have rune weapons, you are not my match.\u201cSo, don\u2019t cause harm to yourself,\u201d said the man calmly.Wang Teng felt lucky. Fortunately, he brought the two cell phones along with him wherever he went. This person had just tracked him through GPS, so he probably didn\u2019t know where he lived.Still, Wang Teng pretended to look shocked.\u201cMartial warrior, you\u2019re actually a martial warrior!\u201cIf I hand the item over to you, will you really let me go?\u201dAt this moment, it was as if Wang Teng was possessed by a drama king. He appeared to be nervous and frightened, mired by a dilemma.\u201cOf course, you should feel fortunate that I came alone to settle this matter.\u201cIf my other teammates had found you out first, hmph, they aren\u2019t as easy to talk to like me,\u201d the man continued.\u201cNo one knows about this?\u201d Wang Teng raised his head.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019m the only one. You don\u2019t have to worry about other people looking for trouble.\u201d The man probably wanted to let Wang Teng believe him, so his expression was extremely sincere.\u201cOkay, I will tell you. But you must first promise to spare my life.\u201dWang Teng gritted his teeth and nodded firmly. He walked towards the other party in a cautious manner.The man had a smile on his face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I mean what I say. I\u2019m a martial warrior. There\u2019s no need for me to lie to a small martial disciple like you.\u201d\u201cI put that thing\u2026\u201dWang Teng walked until he was within three meters of the martial warrior. Then, his gaze intensified, and he heavily stepped on the ground. Using the rebounding force, Wang Teng jumped high up.The smile on the man\u2019s face turned hideous!\u201cLittle brat, I knew you won\u2019t be so honest. I was already guarding against you. Do you think you can fool me with your hidden intentions?\u201cYou are just a martial disciple!\u201cToday, I will show you the difference between a martial disciple and a martial warrior!\u201dThe man punched at Wang Teng. There was a layer of brown Force covering his fist, giving off a thick and solid feeling.Wang Teng swung his long sword in response.Mastery stage Basic Sword Skill!When he raised his sword, he didn\u2019t use any Force. However, once the long sword collided with his opponent\u2019s fist, a scorching explosive Force erupted from the sword.Boom!The two Forces collided and caused a loud roar.Wang Teng had used all his strength in this attack while the other party had a casual attitude. He considered Wang Teng as just a martial disciple.The winner was apparent!Slash!The man\u2019s flesh got slashed and his bones cracked by the strength behind the attack. Blood spurted out like a fountain, going high into the sky.The man\u2019s scream of agony accompanied the falling blood.\u201cAh!\u201dOne of his arms had been chopped off by Wang Teng.A moment ago, he was still confident and arrogant, as if everything was in his control. Now, his face was pale, and his features were distorted from the pain. Astonishment, anger, and disbelief were written all over his face.\u201cMartial warrior!\u201cYou\u2019re actually a martial warrior!\u201dThe man couldn\u2019t help but exclaim. He never would have thought that this high school brat in front of him was a martial warrior.Run!He must escape!If not, he would die!The man had lost an arm, so his battle prowess had drastically dropped. He knew that he wasn\u2019t Wang Teng\u2019s match. His heart was filled with resentment, but he still turned and ran away.He had seen the overflowing killing intent on Wang Teng\u2019s face.As well as his pair of indifferent eyes.There was no hint of anxiety or fear in them anymore. All that was fake. He had been acting, and brilliantly at that.This was a\u2026 drama king!\u201cAre you planning to leave?\u201dAfter Wang Teng chopped off the man\u2019s arm with a single stroke, he didn\u2019t hesitate. He executed his mastery footwork and accelerated exponentially. Flames intertwined his battle sword as he slashed it at the other party.\u201cLittle brat, don\u2019t go too far!\u201d the man screamed in terror. At the same time, he wasn\u2019t going to wait for his death. He hurriedly evaded the attacks.Wang Teng wasn\u2019t affected. He continued following the man with his footwork and inched closer towards him with every move.But, his opponent was obviously an experienced martial warrior with ample battle experience. Despite being heavily injured, he was still able to hold on to his dear life.I can\u2019t drag for too long!I must end it quickly!Wang Teng was in a hurry. In an instant, a spiritual light flashed past, and the battle sword flew out of his hand. He had hurled it at his opponent.Swoosh!The battle sword shot out like an arrow leaving its bow, bringing with it the power of the fire flames.The man\u2019s pupils constricted into a dot. The hair on his body stood up as he tried his best to tilt his body and dodge the sword.Slash!The battle sword slashed his chest and left a bloody mark behind. The skin around the cut was all burnt.Still, he had managed to evade the fatal blow.The man was panting heavily, swallowing large puffs of air. He felt as if he had just survived a calamity.\u201cHahaha, little brat, you won\u2019t be able to kill me. Today\u2026\u201dHe burst out laughing. However, before he could finish his sentence, a gust of strong and icy wind smashed towards him from his right.The man turned his head.A fist that looked like an ice sculpture was quickly growing in size in front of his eyes.\u201cIce element!\u201cNo!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Earth Element Talent Has Gone Live\u201cNo!\u201dThe man screamed in terror. He frantically activated the Force in his body and congregated it into an earth-yellow shield.\u201cEarth element shield!\u201dBut, before the shield could form up, Wang Teng\u2019s Diamond Dust Punch[1. A move from the Saint Seiya anime)\u2014Erm, that was not right. Before the shield finished assembling, Wang Teng\u2019s Phantom Ice Fist had already slammed into his body.Boom!Crack!The battle shield shattered, and the fist landed on his opponent\u2019s face\u2014The passive skill was activated\u2026 Disfiguration!The man flew backward from the punch.There were no low-quality special effects. Instead, only extreme coldness invaded the opponent\u2019s brain. It froze his brain entirely.The man\u2019s scream of agony got cut off the second it started.His fearful expression solidified on his face as his body flew out like a cannonball and smashed into the ground.KO!This was a fatal blow. Wang Teng had used all the ice element Force in his Force nucleus. Although there wasn\u2019t much Force, it was enough to kill someone!The other party was dead!From the start, the information he received wasn\u2019t accurate.Wang Teng was a martial warrior, not a martial disciple.Wang Teng tricked his oblivious opponent. He used the ability of an advanced stage martial disciple to sneak attack his opponent. At the same time, he made his opponent think that he was in complete control.At the end, while his opponent was overly confident, he released his power as a martial warrior and chopped off the man\u2019s arm without giving him any time to react. From then on, the man had no thoughts of fighting anymore. He only wanted to run away.In this situation, the man couldn\u2019t even release half his battle potential before he got sent to hell by Wang Teng with a single punch.The fight ended!Wang Teng\u2019s heart was beating like a drum. He was taking ragged breaths to calm his emotions.\u201cI killed a martial warrior!\u201dWang Teng was slightly stunned.This martial warrior was different from the one he had killed on Mount Bao\u2019an.At that time, the martial warrior on Mount Bao\u2019an was already injured. Wang Teng didn\u2019t kill him face to face either. He had used a rune gun instead.That martial warrior hadn\u2019t expected Wang Teng\u2019s speed to be faster than an average martial disciple, so he had failed in his sneak attack.Even more unexpected was that a high school student actually had a rune gun hidden on him.All these reasons and coincidences allowed Wang Teng to kill the martial warrior with a few shots.So I\u2019m a sneaky attacker?How is that possible!Wang Teng quickly shook his head.He picked up his battle sword and walked forward. After hesitating for a second, he plunged the sword into the man\u2019s heart.Even though his ice element Force froze his opponent\u2019s brain, it was safer to stab his heart just in case something happened.A few attribute bubbles dropped beside the corpse.Beginner stage earth talent*12Earth Force*3Earth Loess Skill*1Spirit*1Strength*10\u2026He was an earth element martial warrior!It looks like I have another element now! I\u2019m moving further and further on the path of becoming an all-rounded martial warrior!Wang Teng picked up the attribute bubbles. With the effect of Spirit*1, his mind cleared up at once. Simultaneously, the cultivation techniques of the Earth Loess Skill were added into his memory.His body became attracted to earth elements, and he was able to feel the earth element Force lingering in his surroundings in the next instant.The earth element Force swarm into his body. The three points of earth Force he picked up merged into his body too.He followed the method in the \u2018Earth Loess Skill\u2019 and moved the earth Force throughout his limbs and bones. Then, the Force entered the Force nucleus.When a new type of Force entered, the balance in the Force nucleus instantly broke. The ice Force was starting to get restless. However, the occult energy appeared again and pacified his ice Force.The three Forces gradually spun around, and equilibrium was once again restored. It slowly became a tripartite confrontation.Enlightenment: 88.1Spirit: 20.2Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Beginner stage earth talent (12/300), Spiritual sight (beginner stage 1.1/10)Force: 62/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)5/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)4/100 Earth (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red Flame Scripture (foundation 2/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 2/100), Earth Loess Skill \u2018Earth element shield\u2019 (foundation 2/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (mastery for Fist, Sword, Blade, Footwork), Basic Stick Skill (foundation), Gun Skill (small achievement), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 40/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 9/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks)Overall Battle Power: 195Blank Attribute: 0The guy didn\u2019t drop any battle techniques?Wang Teng felt pity when he looked at his attributes panel.However, the Earth Loess Skill had a defensive battle technique\u2014Earth Element Shield!The defense shield he used in his last moments must be this battle technique. At that time, I broke his shield before he could form it completely. I wonder what its defense ability is like.I need to find a chance to experiment with it.Wang Teng was delighted with this Earth Element Shield.He had a whole arsenal of offensive battle techniques. However, Wang Teng lacked a defensive skill. The Earth Element Shield was able to mend his shortcomings.The spirit attribute is quite high this time. He dropped one whole point. Is it because I went for his head?Should I get a brick and smack people\u2019s heads from now on?Wang Teng suddenly felt that this was highly possible when he thought of this idea.These thoughts flashed in his mind for a split second only. Thereafter, he shifted his gaze to the corpse in front of him.It was time to execute his god-like skill\u2014searching the corpse!Sadly, besides a cell phone, the person had nothing in his pocket. There were no rune weapons at all.F**k, what a poor fellow!Wang Teng didn\u2019t expect this man to be so poor!But it wasn\u2019t the man\u2019s fault either. He had just become a martial warrior and spent a fortune to buy the \u2018Earth Loess Skill.\u2019 He didn\u2019t have money to buy other battle techniques or weapons.If not, why would he conceal his whereabouts from the teammates he mentioned and come to find Wang Teng personally?He just wanted to take everything that the two martial warriors had left behind.Wang Teng didn\u2019t waste any more time. He lit up the corpse with his fire Force and burnt it to ashes.As Wang Teng watched the flame gradually extinguish in front of him, he was in a daze. In less than a month, his hands had been stained with the lives of many people.He never voluntarily caused any trouble, though. Every single time, he was forced to take action. If not, he would be the one who lost his life.But, the people were still killed by him.No matter what was said, his hands were the ones stained with blood.Sigh, the evil in the world!Wang Teng lamented. He believed he was a kind and honest person, but he couldn\u2019t control how the world was like. He was forced to become a murderer!The flames extinguished entirely.The sea wind blew, and the ashes also scattered in the wind.Suddenly, he realized something.The fire Force was an essential item to bring along when killing people and committing crimes!Wang Teng clutched the martial warrior\u2019s cell phone in his hand. He squinted slightly and exerted force on his fingers.Crack!An expensive iPhone cracked between his fingers.Wang Teng sneered. He swung his hand and threw the phone into the sea. It sank into the depths with a \u2018plop.\u2019He went to his car and took out the two cell phones he got from the martial warriors on Mount Bao\u2019an. He repeated his actions and threw them into the water.If they wanted to look for the phones, they could fish them out from the sea!This matter also gave Wang Teng a warning. In this current society, he had to be careful of technological creations.\u2026Wang Teng got into his car and left. Luckily, it was already very late, so no other cars drove past him.If someone saw him destroying the corpse and clearing evidence, they might be frightened to death.Wang Teng went home and laid out all the things he had taken from the two martial warriors in the past. He examined the items carefully. After ensuring that there weren\u2019t any GPS tracking systems, he heaved a sigh of relief.I better not bring these things back home in the future. Mom and Dad might get dragged into the revenge of martial warriors.They do not practice martial arts. It\u2019s best to leave them out of it.No wonder normal people had so little understanding of the martial world. Only when one stepped foot in this pond would they genuinely appreciate the differences.Wang Teng had many thoughts in his mind. He spent some time straightening his ideas for the future.In that case, I can only rent a house outside. I\u2019ll take a look tomorrow.At this moment, Li Xiumei\u2019s voice came from downstairs.\u201cSon, hurry up and have some supper!\u201do(\u256f\u25a1\u2570)o Luckily, I practice martial arts.

    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Cut It Into HalfTuesday.After Wang Shengguo came back, Wang Teng couldn\u2019t run loose even if he wanted to. He could only go to school obediently.Wang Teng stuffed the egg into his bag and placed it in his car along with the two weapons. He planned to rent a house outside today.He would find a house to hide his egg!Wang Teng soon arrived at his school.To his amazement, he realized that many people were studying \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers.\u2019 He felt a little frightened when he saw how crazy everyone was.Even Lin Chuhan wasn\u2019t an exception. She was studying very hard, as if her life depended on it. She was chanting while writing her notes.Seriously, this was\u2014I either go mad or I succeed!The martial arts exam was pivotal to the students. Even if the chances were minimal, most of them didn\u2019t want to give up.They were willing to bet their lives\u2026 pfft, bet their university entrance exam on it. No matter what, they had to go all out and try it once.Wang Teng felt gratified.Look at this entire floor of \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 attribute bubbles.\u00a0Classmates, you are really amazing. Study hard, please study hard.Wang Teng expressed admiration towards the students who were hard at work as he picked up the attribute bubbles.\u2014All of you are amazing!In one morning, Wang Teng quickly mastered the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers.\u2019After eating lunch with Xu Jie and his other friends, he drove his car out of school in the afternoon.Zhao Ganghu and Zhao Gangbao had been waiting outside the gates of Donghai No. 1 High School for almost two hours. Yesterday, after a whole night of consideration, Zhao Ganghu made a decision that he didn\u2019t even believe he could ever make.He had been waiting for a long time, but he didn\u2019t dare to complain.Zhao Gangbao sat on the steps beside the road in a dejected and despondent manner. He smoked continuously and looked a little downcast.When Wang Teng\u2019s car drove out, Zhao Ganghu recognized it immediately.\u201cYoung Master Wang!\u201d his eyes lit up as he shouted in a hurry.Wang Teng was just about to drive his car off. When he heard this voice, he stepped on the brake again. \u201cOh, it\u2019s him. He really came.\u201dHe parked the car beside the road and came down.\u201cHow is it? Have you thought about it properly?\u201d Wang Teng said to Zhao Ganghu after getting out of his car.\u201cSince I promised Young Master Wang, I will definitely solve it quickly,\u201d Zhao Ganghu gave a bitter smile as he replied.\u201cIn that case, what decision did you make?\u201d Wang Teng asked with interest. He was a little curious when he saw Zhao Ganghu\u2019s reaction.Zhao Ganghu gritted his teeth. He seemed a little hesitant at the last moment. But, in the end, he still said, \u201cYoung Master Wang, I\u2019m not someone talented or powerful, but I do have some beginner stage and intermediate stage martial disciples following me for a living\u2026\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, we will follow Young Master Wang from now on.\u201dWang Teng was dumbfounded.He thought that Zhao Ganghu might dispose of his assets to gather more liquid cash or find a few rune weapons or something similar to solve the grudge between them.But, he never imagined that Zhao Ganghu would burn his boats and put himself at his command along with his subordinates!\u201cBrother!\u201d Zhao Gangbao was flabbergasted.He didn\u2019t expect Zhao Ganghu to make this decision either. If he really became Wang Teng\u2019s lackey, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone he could rely on in the future.Wang Teng was contemplating something, though. He had a sudden thought.Most of the gangsters were just beginner stage or intermediate stage martial disciples. Zhao Ganghu was the only advanced stage martial disciple among his fellow hooligans. However, this was still a small faction.He could keep them under his wings!But, he didn\u2019t agree immediately. Instead, he gave a look of dilemma.Zhao Ganghu\u2019s heart skipped a beat when he saw this. He pulled Zhao Gangbao, who was beside him, aside and said, \u201cMy younger brother is the one who caused this issue because he can\u2019t control the lower part of his body. If Young Master Wang feels that this isn\u2019t enough, we can cut it off. He won\u2019t be able to carry out misdeeds in the future.\u201dZhao Gangbao almost peed his pants in fright.\u201cBrother!\u201cMy biological elder brother!\u201cI must have been picked up from the streets. How can you treat me so cruelly!\u201d he shouted and struggled frantically in his hold.But, with his ability, he wasn\u2019t able to resist Zhao Ganghu, an advanced stage martial disciple.Wang Teng was stunned too.\u201cCut\u2026 cut off!\u201dHe only regained his senses after a long while. He stared at Zhao Ganghu with a strange expression.If these two people weren\u2019t similar in their looks, he would really have thought that Zhao Gangbao was picked up from the streets.\u201cDon\u2019t you think that cutting it off is a little too harsh?\u201d Wang Teng muttered.Zhao Gangbao was so touched that he almost cried when he heard Wang Teng speaking up for him. He nodded his head hurriedly.\u201cBrother, look, even Young Master Wang feels this way. Please spare me this time.\u201cI won\u2019t dare to do it again!\u201cThat time, I was blind. That was why I had some thoughts towards Young Master Wang\u2019s friend. I shouldn\u2019t have had those thoughts. I know my mistake\u2026\u201dZhao Ganghu wasn\u2019t moved in the slightest.However, Wang Teng nodded. \u201cIt looks like your brother really recognizes his mistake. In that case, we don\u2019t have to cut it off entirely.\u201dZhao Ganghu felt that something was wrong when he listened to their conversation. But, he didn\u2019t manage to react immediately.Zhao Gangbao was delighted. He knew that Wang Teng had softened his attitude. His brother wouldn\u2019t have to cut his lifeline off for real.But, Wang Teng paused before continuing, \u201cI\u2019m a benevolent person. Let\u2019s just cut half of it!\u201dZhao Ganghu: \u2026Zhao Gangbao: \u00a5%%\u2026*&amp;&amp;*#\u00a5\u00a5%\u00a5\u2026&amp;You must be a devil!Your heart must be black!Half?To hell with half!Zhao Gangbao\u2019s entire face turned pale. He looked at Wang Teng in a daze, especially the expression when he said that he was benevolent. He felt extremely uncomfortable by his sick behavior.\u201cYoung Master Wang, why don\u2019t we just cut the whole thing off?\u201dZhao Ganghu\u2019s eyelids twitched furiously. He kept warning himself continuously that he must not provoke Wang Teng in the future.At this moment, Zhao Gangbao even felt that Zhao Ganghu was speaking for his sake.Cut half of it\u2026It was better to be more direct!There were no emotions in Zhao Gangbao\u2019s eyes. He was frightened and had no urge to live anymore.The world is too scary! Mom, I want to go home!Wang Teng noticed that his words had the desired effect, so he stopped frightening Zhao Gangbao. He patted his shoulder and said to him, \u201cAlright, I was just trying to scare you. Don\u2019t cause trouble in the future. You won\u2019t meet someone who\u2019s so easy to talk to like me all the time.\u201dZhao Gangbao abruptly raised his head. His face was filled with a pleasant surprise. He didn\u2019t need to cut it off anymore?\u201cBut, if you repeat the same mistake, I will take care of you personally!\u201d Wang Teng said in a calm tone. Then, he ignored Zhao Gangbao and went back into his car. He started the engine and prepared to leave.\u201cYoung Master Wang, what do you think of my suggestion just now?\u201d Zhao Ganghu shouted frantically.\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. Wait for me to check their backgrounds. If they\u2019re up to my requirements, we can talk about it again.\u201dWang Teng winded down the car window and glanced at Zhao Ganghu. He left him with this reply and drove off in his car.After the car went a distance away, Zhao Gangbao carefully asked his brother, \u201cBrother, you\u2019re not cutting me anymore?\u201d\u201cIdiot, only you think that I want to cut you. Don\u2019t you know the self-torture trick? Young Master Wang saw through it at one glance. He just wanted to scare you. Look at how timid you are,\u201d Zhao Ganghu glared at him as he replied.Zhao Gangbao was used to getting scolded, so he didn\u2019t mind it this time, either. He just heaved a sigh of relief and patted his chest. \u201cI was almost scared to death!\u201d\u201cUseless thing!\u201d Zhao Ganghu got angrier. He kicked his brother indignantly.Zhao Gangbao jumped to the side skillfully and dodged the kick. He sniggered and asked again, \u201cBrother, are we really going to listen to him from now on?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a brighter future in following a martial warrior than an advanced stage martial disciple like me. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s such a young martial warrior,\u201d Zhao Ganghu answered in a profound manner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: A Man Who Possessed 18 Relocated HousesAfter parting with Zhao Ganghu and his brother, Wang Teng pondered over Zhao Ganghu\u2019s suggestion while driving.He had to admit that Zhao Ganghu was street smart.When Zhao Ganghu chose to seek refuge with Wang Teng, a martial warrior, he was able to resolve the grudges between them in the past. At the same time, he was also able to turn Wang Teng into his security blanket.There was also that self-torture trick just now\u2026 Hmph~Wang Teng smiled ambiguously.Should he accept Zhao Ganghu\u2019s sincerity?\u2026As he thought about this, Wang Teng drove his car into an estate.During his lesson in the morning, he had searched for all the available houses between Donghai No. 1 High School and his home on 58.He had also set appointments with a few landlords in the afternoon to take a look at the houses.The estate in front of him was his first destination. The landlord was a middle-aged woman around 50 years old.Since Wang Teng was a little late, the woman\u2019s expression was unhappy. However, when she saw him driving a sports car, her eyes lit up. She immediately turned enthusiastic.She brought Wang Teng for a tour of the house. She kept introducing the house to him, telling him how good her place was and how conveniently located it was.Wang Teng felt his head spinning because of her chattering.Also, the moment they talked about the rent, he felt even more speechless.On the website, it was written as 3500 per month. Yet, when he came, it became 6000 per month. The price rose by almost 100%!It was obvious that she was treating him like a wastrel!In the end, Wang Teng could only get rid of the naggy old woman by telling her that he needed to go home and consider the offer.He couldn\u2019t help but heave a sigh of relief when he drove out of the estate.It was seriously frightening!After that, he went to look at a few more houses, but none of them were satisfactory.Some had weird landlords, while others had so many rules and regulations that they didn\u2019t seem to be looking for a tenant. Instead, they must be seeking a guard to watch over their house\u2026This room was out of bounds; that appliance mustn\u2019t be used!My house was renovated recently, so please don\u2019t dirty the walls!Remember to water the flowers and plants on my balcony. Remember to feed some dogs and cats, etc.There were all kinds of rules like these!Wang Teng was speechless. If they couldn\u2019t bear to leave their house, why bother renting it?Since the flowers and plants were so precious, since the dogs and cats were so cute, why didn\u2019t they bring them along and raise them personally?\u2026After spending an hour or so, he didn\u2019t gain anything. Wang Teng shook his head and went straight to the last house.Actually, he didn\u2019t dare to have too much hope.\u201cI should have just found an agent!\u201d Wang Teng shook his head. After the Wang family declined in his past life, he went to rent a house outside alone and got tricked by real estate agents a few times. He could still remember it vividly. That was why he subconsciously threw away the thought of looking for agents.The last house was located around Donghai University town.It wasn\u2019t situated on the path from his house to Donghai No. 1 High School anymore. However, this area was secluded and quiet. It was at the edge of a university town, so the security was not bad either.He saw it coincidentally and felt that it was not bad. Thus, he decided to take a look.\u201cAre you \u2018Young Master Wang, the king of Qidian Orphanage\u2019?\u201dThe landlord was a middle-aged rough-looking man. He was wearing beach pants and slippers as he stood at the side of the road. The moment he saw Wang Teng, his question shocked him.\u201cYoung Master Wang, the king\u2026 of Qidian Orphanage?!\u201dHe wondered for a moment before he remembered that this seemed to be his online nickname.He had created the nickname back when he was young and childish. He had long forgotten about it. When he went online in the morning today, he didn\u2019t notice his nickname at all.He didn\u2019t expect someone to recite his nickname out\u2026It was so embarrassing!He wished to disappear on the spot!Deep down inside, he really wanted to find a hole and bury himself in it, but on the surface, he remained exceptionally calm. He nodded.\u201cYou\u2019re the landlord!\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s me. Come, I\u2019ll take you to see the house.\u201d The rough-looking man acted naturally. He didn\u2019t get overly excited.This looked like someone who had been through many experiences in life!He brought Wang Teng in a certain direction.There was an area filled with low-level apartments in front of them. They walked in from the main road and twisted and turned in the small alley. After some time, they finally arrived in front of a house with a courtyard.The outside wall was greyish-white and covered with vines. The landlord opened the metal gates and entered first.\u201cYou can take a look around yourself.\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t hold back and started sizing up the house straight away. The more he looked at it, the more satisfied he felt.The location of the house was quiet. It looked old from the outside, but the decorations inside were all new. It appeared extremely comfortable.There was a small courtyard included. It looked spacious. If he wanted to practice martial arts, he would be able to move freely here.The university town was not far away from this house. It was quiet, but once you stepped outside, you could see the student street in the distance. At night, at around 10 pm, it was still very lively.Most of the people living in this area were ordinary families. Many university students also rented a room here. There weren\u2019t many rotten eggs mixed in.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d asked the landlord when he saw Wang Teng had finished his tour of the house.\u201cNot bad. Tell me about the price.\u201d Wang Teng nodded.The landlord took out a cigarette and placed it in his mouth. At the same time, he passed one to Wang Teng. \u201cDo you want one?\u201dWang Teng accepted it and placed it in his mouth.The landlord lit up the cigarette and took a deep puff. He blew the smoke out slowly and asked, \u201cAre you renting it alone?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Wang Teng nodded.\u201cIf you\u2019re renting it alone, it won\u2019t be cheap. However, I noticed that you drove a sports car over, so you probably don\u2019t lack the money.\u201d The landlord smiled. \u201cHow about this? I won\u2019t charge you more. 5000 a month, can you accept this price?\u201dWang Teng had checked the rent of the houses in this estate coming here. This price was really reasonable.Also, the renovation was not bad. By right, other people would rent the house if the price was slightly higher.Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but glance at the rough-looking man. He was a little astounded.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Do you find it too cheap?\u201d The rough-looking man knew what Wang Teng was thinking at a single glance. He smiled, revealing his yellow teeth.\u201cThe price is alright. I won\u2019t mind if it\u2019s a little higher. However, I have a requirement,\u201d Wang Teng said.\u201cYou have a requirement? Tell me about it!\u201d The rough-looking man raised his eyebrows.\u201cWhen I\u2019m renting the house, no one can enter it, including you,\u201d Wang Teng said.\u201cNo problem! This is reasonable.\u201d The rough-looking man nodded and replied without any hesitation.In the end, the man didn\u2019t ask for more money. He kept his word and rented the house to Wang Teng for 5000 a month. This caused Wang Teng to have a good impression of the man.A month of rent as a deposit and three months of rent paid on the spot.Received on Alipay.The contract was also signed.The rough-looking man took out a bunch of keys and passed them to Wang Teng.\u201cIf you\u2019re worried, I can pass you the spare keys too. I lived in the newly built estate just beside this one. If you\u2019re not in a hurry to leave, I can go back and bring the spare keys for you.\u201d The rough-looking man pointed at an estate that could be seen from here.\u201cI\u2019ll be moving in at night. You can give it to me then.\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t reject his offer.The rough-looking man nodded in agreement. They started walking towards the main road outside. By foot, it only took a few minutes.When they reached the main road and were just about to bid farewell to each other, the rough-looking man\u2019s cell phone rang.\u201cThe vast sky is my love\u2026\u201dThe passionate and unrestrained ringtone echoed in the streets. Many students walking by turned around to look at them.The rate of second glance was 200%!\u201cHello, yes, wife\u2026 Okay, okay, I will come back immediately\u2026 what? Oh, buy a bottle of soy sauce? Sure, I will go and buy it at once.\u201dWang Teng looked at the rough-looking hunk, who was still calm and composed a moment ago. Right now, he looked like a mouse that had met a cat. He was nodding his head and bowing as he answered the call. The fawning intention in his voice was evident. For a moment, his expression was extremely interesting to watch.After some time, the rough-looking man hung up the call and heaved a long sigh.He lit a cigarette to calm his soul.His back started to straighten again.\u201cSigh, I\u2019m a man who has 18 relocated houses. Why did I fall in the hands of a woman?\u201dWang Teng: \u2026Brother, I think you just revealed something terribly serious!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: The Benefit Of Crossing Your Legs And Cultivating\u2014Leg Numb!Wang Teng was enlightened.No wonder this landlord didn\u2019t care about money. No wonder he didn\u2019t care if he was receiving a thousand RMB lesser for his rent.This was how outstanding a man with 18 properties should be!This was how arrogant and amazing he was!One must admit that he had the right to do so!Although he seemed a little scared of his wife, he still put up a strong front. Though deep down inside, Wang Teng could see a weak and heartless soul that had suffered greatly.Amen. Let\u2019s stand in a silent tribute for three seconds!Looking at Wang Teng\u2019s gaze, the rough-looking man opened his mouth.\u201cBrother, you don\u2019t have to say anything. I understand. I respect a man like you too. Hurry up and beat\u2026 Oh, I meant buy soy sauce. Your wife is still waiting for you.\u201dWang Teng patted his shoulder and said earnestly.The rough-looking man opened his mouth again, but he couldn\u2019t say a single word. In the end, he just waved his hand and walked dejectedly towards the convenience stall at the side\u2014to buy soya sauce.This was how a real man should act. He must have the guts to face the female tiger at home.Wang Teng got into his car and glanced at the lonely back view one last time. He sighed before he left, letting his sigh dissipate in the wind.\u2026Wang Teng went back to school. There were ten minutes until the lessons resumed. But, he didn\u2019t plan to go back to his classroom.He felt that it was a waste of time for him to stay in the classroom obediently.He didn\u2019t need to worry about the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers.\u2019 He would take some time every day to farm for attributes. Soon, he would be able to reach full marks.\u201cClass Monitor, please cover for me in the afternoon.\u201dWang Teng said to Lin Chuhan. Under the lady\u2019s helpless gaze, he left the classroom light-heartedly.\u201cThis fellow is so infuriating. He always asks me to cover up for him. I should have ignored him at the start. Why is he asking me again and again? He\u2019s being insatiable.\u201d Lin Chuhan stomped her feet uncontrollably.Actually, all the teachers knew that this rich second generation, Wang Teng, was either skipping classes or playing with his phone in class. However, they had always turned a blind eye to him.In the teachers\u2019 eyes, Wang Teng was a hopeless cause. They were already delighted if he didn\u2019t affect the other students in class.The school bell rang.The noise and clamor inside the school campus slowly quietened down. After some time, only the sound of teachers teaching could be heard.Wang Teng walked along the paths in school. He decided to find a place to cultivate the Force.Ever since he became a martial warrior, he had never practiced formally.Since he had some spare time now, he would use it to practice his Force skill scriptures and see their effects.There was a small patch of forest behind the stadium. Usually, besides a few bad students who went there to smoke, very few would go there.It was lesson time now, so there was no one there at all.Wang Teng thought for a moment and walked towards the small forest.A few bird chips and cries of insects were the only noise in the otherwise silent small forest. This area seemed exceptionally quiet and peaceful.Wang Teng kept walking further in and saw a huge rock. There was just enough space for a person to sit on its surface.He jumped lightly and sat down cross-legged on the rock.The tree shade above him coincidentally blocked the scorching sun for him. But, the temperature was still on the high side. Wang Teng used his ice element Force to create a circle of ice cubes around him.The temperature instantly lowered to a cool spring breeze.Comfortable!Seeing that there was no one around him, Wang Teng closed his eyes and began practicing his Force skill scriptures. He started with the \u2018Red Flame Scripture.\u2019Following the instructions on the scripture, he drew out the fire Force in his Force nucleus and circulated them around his limbs and bones.Wang Teng slowly entered the state of cultivation.All the fire Force in his surroundings surged towards him\u2026Based on the description of \u2018Red Flame Scripture,\u2019 when the Force circled once around the body following the scripture\u2019s instructions and then returned to the Force nucleus, this was considered a cycle.At this moment, the fire Force had already finished one cycle. However, Wang Teng didn\u2019t stop. He continued cultivating.One cycle, two cycles, three cycles\u2026One hour passed very quickly.Wang Teng was exceptionally focused when he was cultivating.An hour later, he slowly opened his eyes. He felt that the fire Force in his body had become much stronger. He was also more well-versed with \u2018Red Flame Scripture.\u2019His gaze landed on his attributes panel.Enlightenment: 83.1Spirit: 20.2Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Beginner stage earth talent (12/300), Spiritual Sight (beginner stage 1.1/10)Force: 63/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)5/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)4/100 Earth (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red Flame Scripture (foundation 5/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 2/100), Earth Loess Skill \u2018Earth Element Shield\u2019 (foundation 2/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (mastery for fist, sword, blade, footwork), Basic Stick Skill (foundation), Gun Skill (small achievement), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 40/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 9/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks)Overall Battle Power: 195Blank Attribute: 0My fire Force only increased by one point!\u00a0Wang Teng\u2019s eyes widened in surprise.He had cultivated for an entire hour, but his fire Force only increased by a single point. He was flabbergasted by the turtle-like speed.Typically, he relied on collecting attributes to raise his points, so his abilities increased exponentially. It couldn\u2019t be any faster.As expected, there was no harm if there was no comparison.It looked like he was really spoiled by the system.What if the system disappeared one day?Once Wang Teng thought of this possibility, his heart constricted. He hurriedly shook his head to dispel the thought.\u00a0No way, no way, I can\u2019t be over-reliant on the system. I must work hard on my cultivation!He took a deep breath and steeled his heart. Wang Teng\u2019s gaze became resolute. After sorting out his thoughts on this matter, he adjusted his mentality and started to be positive.Then, his gaze went down the attributes panel.Red Flame Scripture (foundation 5/100)\u2014His proficiency had increased by three points.Wang Teng nodded silently. If he continued working hard like this, it would only be a matter of time before he achieved his breakthrough.When he reached the next level, his cultivation speed would definitely become faster.He started cultivating again. But, he changed the scripture he was practicing to \u2018Deep Oce Scripture\u2019 and \u2018Earth Loess Skill.\u2019As compared to the fire Force, his ice Force and earth Force were undeniably too weak.Yesterday night, when he was fighting with his opponent, the ice Force had played a decisive role as an unexpected final move that took his opponent by surprise.Thus, there was a need to upgrade these two Forces. In the future, they could be his hidden trump cards.Time passed slowly\u2026For the entire afternoon, Wang Teng sat on the rock and cultivated his Force skill scriptures without moving an inch. When the school bell signaling the end of the last lesson ended, he stopped his cultivation.He glanced at the attributes panel one last time.His ice Force and earth Force had increased by 1.5 points, respectively.At the same time, his \u2018Deep Ice Scripture\u2019 had improved by 4 points and his \u2018Earth Loess Skill\u2019 by 3.The gains are not bad!This time, Wang Teng didn\u2019t look down on the small increase.Yes, his mentality had gotten stable!He wanted to get down from the rock, but his two legs were stiff. He almost fell to the ground.Oh my god, what a huge fright!He grabbed the rock in a flurry and panted.As a martial warrior, he almost fell down from a rock that was only this tall in height. If word spread out, other people would laugh at him.Damn it, novels are fake. Who says that the cultivation results are better when you cross your legs? My legs are numb!He couldn\u2019t move his legs at all. Wang Teng had no choice but to pry his legs open with his hand and let them rest for a while. Only then could he step on the ground and walk. He kept complaining in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Practice Taichi? The Good For Health Kind~After the lesson ended, the school became extremely noisy.The students from the different years walked out of their classrooms. They merged into human streams and surged towards the entrance of the school.Wang Teng went straight to the teachers\u2019 office instead. He was going there to look for his headteacher, Mr. Fan Weiming, to register for the martial arts exam.The office was livelier than what Wang Teng expected. The desks of the headteachers of the year three classes were even more so. They were surrounded by students, making the whole office appear crowded.When Wang Teng knocked on the door, he immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention.After all, Wang Teng was quite famous in the year three cohort.\u201cWhy is it him?\u201d\u201cWhat is he doing here? Did he come to register?\u201d\u201cThe rich second generation wants to participate in the martial arts exam too? Has he even practiced martial arts before? Is he joking around?\u201d\u201cDid he say that he had never practiced martial arts before?\u201dThe sudden rhetorical question caused the people discussing in hushed voices to turn strangely quiet.\u201cWell~ he has never said that before.\u201d\u201cIn that case, what are you all gossiping about?\u201d\u2026O((\u2299_\u2299))oThe conversation was put to an abrupt halt.Then, everyone continued gathering around their headteachers and registered their names seriously. It felt as if nothing had happened.\u201cWang Teng!\u201d Fan Weiming also noticed Wang Teng. His tone carried obvious surprise. \u201cYou came to register too? Come in!\u201dAs a professional headteacher, he clearly knew how many students in his class had chances of entering the martial arts course.Wang Teng was obviously not one of them.Although Wang Teng\u2019s father occasionally gave him gifts, he still had his principles.I will persuade this fellow later. The martial arts exam isn\u2019t something to play with.Fan Weiming thought to himself secretly. Then, he continued, \u201cWait at the side for a moment. I will help them finish their registration first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Wang Teng nodded.His gaze landed on his classmates. There were a few people he was unfamiliar with. Then, there was Yang Jian, who sat in front of him, and\u2026His table buddy and class monitor, Lin Chuhan!Yang Jian was fine. He had an uncle working in the Ministry of Education, so he had gotten some inside scoop a long time ago. He had more time to prepare as compared to other people. Thus, his confidence was explanatory.As for Lin Chuhan, forgetting her ability first, the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 was enough to let her suffer.However, she came to register the next day after the announcement was released.It should be known that many people were still hesitating. They couldn\u2019t decide within such a short time.The martial arts exam was intersected with the regular university entrance exam. If one applied for the martial arts exam, they wouldn\u2019t be able to take part in a few subjects of the standard university entrance exam.It looked like Lin Chuhan\u2019s resolution was quite firm!\u201cLin Chuhan, have you thought about this carefully?\u201d Wang Teng moved towards Lin Chuhan and asked in a low voice.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Class Monitor. The martial arts exam isn\u2019t a child\u2019s play. There\u2019s even a death rate for the actual combat assessment. It\u2019s very dangerous.\u201dYang Jian was in a dilemma just now. He didn\u2019t know how to open his mouth. Hence, when he heard Wang Teng starting this topic, he jumped into the conversation and persuaded Lin Chuhan.\u201cI know. I have given it careful thought,\u201d Lin Chuhan nodded and replied.\u201cYour parents agreed?\u201d Wang Teng asked with a frown.\u201cMy parents\u2026 I can make my own decision!\u201d Lin Chuhan obviously hesitated for a second, but she still replied to them firmly.The corner of Wang Teng\u2019s mouth twitched. So, she didn\u2019t discuss it with her parents. Was this young lady so independent?He wanted to dissuade her again, but when he saw her stubborn and pretty face, he swallowed the words back into his mouth.\u201cSigh, forget it. Everyone has their right to make decisions. Since she has made up her mind, there\u2019s no point in me persuading her otherwise.\u201dYang Jian saw that Wang Teng had shut his mouth. It wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to continue speaking, either.At this moment, all the other students had finished their registration. He walked forward and handed over his registration fee. Then, he filled in the registration form, and just like that, the registration process was done.The process was surprisingly simple!Yang Jian left after he finished his registration. Fan Weiming took the water cup beside him and opened its lid. He blew the water in the cup.With his sharp eyes, Wang Teng noticed the goji berries in the cup flipping their bodies naughtily.\u2500\u2501_\u2500\u2501\u2727Lin Chuhan tried her best to maintain the stern expression on her face.Fan Weiming didn\u2019t sense their change in expression, though. He took a sip of his goji berry tea and looked at the two people in front of him. His head was hurting slightly.One was the top student in his year three class eight. She was one of the best talents in the year three cohort and had the potential to enter The First University.But, this child wanted to participate in the martial arts exam.He wasn\u2019t saying that the martial arts exam was bad; it was just a problem of suitability.In terms of studies, Lin Chuhan was the best in the entire Donghai No. 1 High School. However, speaking of the martial arts exam, if she was really able to pass the exam, her results wouldn\u2019t be high. At least, it wouldn\u2019t be as high as her general papers.Lin Chuhan had rushed over immediately after her lesson ended. He had persuaded her for a long time, but her mind was fixed. He couldn\u2019t convince him no matter how hard he tried. How could Fan Weiming\u2019s head not hurt?As for the other person\u2014Wang Teng!He was a rich second generation. His studies were extremely poor, and there was nothing that could be said about it. But, the martial arts exam wasn\u2019t an ordinary exam. Fan Weiming didn\u2019t want him to joke around with his life.Thus, he said, \u201cWang Teng, I\u2019ve said before that the martial arts exam is dangerous. You didn\u2019t hear me, right?\u201d\u201cTeacher, I heard you alright.\u201d Wang Teng rolled his eyes.\u00a0Why doesn\u2019t he trust me?\u201cYou heard me\u2026 then why do you still want to register for it?\u201d Fan Weiming was frustrated.\u201cTeacher, I understand that you\u2019re doing this for my sake, but I know what I\u2019m doing. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d Wang Teng noticed that his teacher still appeared unconvinced, so he revealed his trump card. \u201cAlso, my father agreed.\u201d\u201cOh! Your father agreed!\u201d Fan Weiming was slightly stunned. He wondered to himself,\u00a0It looks like he has his ways. It\u2019s good to be wealthy\u2026Eventually, he nodded. \u201cIn that case, come over and register.\u201dHe handed the registration form to Wang Teng.Wang Teng paid the fee and signed his big name on the form. Done!At the same time, Fan Weiming addressed Lin Chuhan again. \u201cChuhan, I still hope that you will consider this again. The university entrance exam is a huge turning point in life. You can\u2019t act on impulse.\u201d\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m not acting on impulse. I\u2019ve already thought about this very, very clearly,\u201d Lin Chuhan replied with a bitter smile.She didn\u2019t expect her greatest obstacle to be her headteacher.She knew that he was doing this for her sake, but she really wanted to take part in the martial arts exam. She was very determined, so determined that if she didn\u2019t participate, she would regret it for life.\u201cTeacher, even if I participate in the martial arts exam, I won\u2019t give up my general papers.\u201dLin Chuhan bit her lips and continued, \u201cIf I can\u2019t pass the martial arts exam this year, I will give up wholeheartedly. I will repeat my year and go for the normal university entrance exam.\u201dSince she had already said this, Fan Weiming couldn\u2019t do anything more, no matter how unwilling he was. He just sighed and approved her application.After the two of them left the office, a teacher at the side said to Fan Weiming, \u201cMr. Fan, that\u2019s the top student in your class, right? Are you letting her go just like this?\u201d\u201cWhat else can I do? Her mind is set. Am I supposed to prevent her from registering?\u201d Fan Weiming glanced sideways at the other party.\u201cSigh, that\u2019s true. But, honestly speaking, the attractiveness of the martial arts path is really frightening. If I was a few years younger, I might have wanted to give it a try, too,\u201d said the teacher.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you practice if you\u2019re older? Do you know Taichi? It\u2019s passed down from our planet. After some modifications by the martial warriors, Taichi is now very suitable for old people to practice. Even if you are not a martial warrior, you can use it to strengthen your body.\u201dFan Weiming took a sip of his goji berry tea as he spoke calmly.\u201cOh? Mr. Fan, have you practiced it before?\u201d The teacher\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cHaha, of course.\u201d Fan Weiming was a little proud. His interest was immediately perked up. \u201cLet me tell you, Taichi is excellent for our health. After practicing it, my back doesn\u2019t hurt anymore, and I\u2019m not balding. I\u2019m very energetic at night too!\u201d\u201c\u2570(*\u00b0\u25bd\u00b0*)\u256fMr. Fan, teach me when you\u2019re free (*^\u25bd^*).\u201d\u201cNo problem. Let\u2019s meet in the park in the evening?\u201d\u201cSure, see you at the park!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: A Data ReportAfter coming out of the teachers\u2019 office, Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan walked to the school gates side by side.\u201cClass Monitor, it\u2019s dinner time now. Why don\u2019t I treat you to a meal?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. My mom has already cooked dinner and is waiting for me to go back,\u201d Lin Chuhan rejected him without any hesitation.\u201cAlright, we will part here then.\u201d Wang Teng smiled. He didn\u2019t mind her response.\u201cAlright, goodbye!\u201d replied Lin Chuhan.Wang Teng waved his hand. He sat in his car and drove away alone. Along the way, he called the landlord and informed him that he was going over to the house now.Approximately ten minutes later, in the university town, it was the same pavement beside the main road. The rough-looking man rode his little scooter with a beauty sitting behind him.The scene looked extremely dissolute.It was the same rough-looking man but with an additional beauty hugging his waist. Wang Teng almost couldn\u2019t recognize the guy.He parked his sports car at the side of the road and got down.\u201cLittle Brother Wang, over here.\u201d The landlord waved at him.Wang Teng walked over only after he was called. He said in a meaningful tone, \u201cBrother, I only left for an afternoon, but I almost couldn\u2019t recognize you.\u201dThe landlord obviously knew what he meant. He laughed and said, \u201cLow profile, low profile.\u201dThe beauty behind him rolled her eyes and lifted her hand to pinch his fat waist. \u201cStupid fellow!\u201dOh my, the voice was a little sweet.\u201cOuch!\u201d The rough-looking man gasped in pain.\u201cYou must be \u2018Young Master Wang, the king of Qidian Orphanage,\u2019 right? Old Wang mentioned you before,\u201d the beauty turned to Wang Teng and said.Wang Teng: \u2026The landlord burst out laughing when he saw Wang Teng\u2019s frustrated expression. \u201cAlright, don\u2019t mention this matter anymore. Normal people won\u2019t have the ability to bear with this name.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all youth\u2019s fault!\u201d Wang Teng replied helplessly.\u201cHow old are you?\u201d The beauty covered her mouth and smiled.\u201cLet me introduce her to you. This is my wife. You can call her Sister Han,\u201d said the landlord.\u201cSister Han!\u201d Wang Teng called. Then, he continued, \u201cMy name is Wang Teng. You can call me by my name.\u201d\u201cYou and Old Wang have the same surname,\u201d Sister Han smiled and replied.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Brother has the surname \u2018Wang\u2019 too. Oh right, I don\u2019t know your name yet.\u201d Wang Teng smiled. He felt that this was fate.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to mention my name. I\u2019ll call you Brother Wang, and if you don\u2019t mind, you can call me Old Brother Wang.\u201d Wang Dapao gave a look of contempt when his name was mentioned.Wang Teng didn\u2019t probe further. He nodded and asked, \u201cAre you going out to play?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. This idiot hasn\u2019t brought me out for a long time. He hardly accompanied me out today,\u201d Sister Han said sadly.\u201cOld Brother Wang, this is your fault. Sister Han is so pretty. How can you coop her up at home for so long?\u201d Wang Teng smiled.\u201cDid you hear that? Learn from Little Teng. Look at how smart he is,\u201d Sister Han pinched Wang Dapao\u2019s ears as she said.Wang Dapao\u2019s expression became distorted due to the pain. He glared at Wang Teng with hidden bitterness on his face.\u201cI will not disturb you, then. Old Brother Wang, get along quickly.\u201d Wang Teng pushed Wang Dapao in a friendly manner.\u2026At the same time, in the office building of Jixin Martial House.A young lady around twenty years old was walking towards the principal\u2019s office in haste. There was a piece of paper in her hand. It was a data report.Xiaoming was a staff member of Jixin Martial House. While she was collecting the data of the martial disciples today, something caught her attention.At the principal\u2019s office entrance, Xiaoming adjusted her breathing that had turned a little rapid because of her brisk walk. Then, she knocked on the door.Knock, knock, knock!\u201cCome in.\u201d A deep voice came from inside.Xiaoming pushed the door open and walked in.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe principal was a man around 30 years old. He had short hair that looked like steel spikes on his head. Every single strand of his hair was erected. He wore a stern expression and gave off a fierce and sharp aura.The staff of Jixin Martial House would all feel a little frightened when facing the principal. Xiaoming was no exception. At this moment, she needed to gather her courage before she dared to step forward and place the data report on the principal\u2019s table.\u201cPrincipal, there\u2019s something wrong with this report. I think that you should take a look at it.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201dFu Tiandao raised his eyebrows. He stopped what he was doing and turned his attention to the date report.He took the report and leaned against his chair. He scanned through it twice.\u201cA normal person rose to become an advanced stage martial disciple in less than a month? Hmm, this is interesting!\u201d Fu Tiandao smiled ambiguously.Xiaoming wanted to say something, but Fu Tiandao continued, \u201cYou can leave now. I\u2019ll keep it with me. Also, don\u2019t tell anyone else about the content of this report.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Xiaoming replied in a hurry.Xiaoming didn\u2019t dare to probe further.\u2026After Wang Teng took the keys from the landlord, he placed the crow egg in the bedroom in the house. He then turned on the incubator and slowly incubated the egg.Then, he drove his car home to have dinner. Afterward, as usual, he went to the martial arts academy to pick up some attributes.For the next two days, Wang Teng\u2019s life was very peaceful. He followed the same routine every day.In the morning, he would go to school to collect some \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 attributes. If he didn\u2019t want to attend the lesson, he would go to the little forest to practice his Force skill scriptures.This allowed the proficiency of his Force and skill scriptures to rise.At night, he would visit Jixin Martial House to pick up some attributes to perfect his basic battle techniques and raise his battle power.Of course, he didn\u2019t forget his two main offensive Force battle techniques, Fire Kirin Sword Skill and Phantom Ice Fist.After repeated attempts, Wang Teng realized that he was able to raise 1 point of his battle technique every ten times he practiced.Also, as his enlightenment increased, the speed of his cultivation followed suit.This caused his thirst for enlightenment attributes to grow stronger.Wang Teng also experimented with the defense ability of Earth Element Shield.If he executed it to its fullest potential, Earth Element Shield could block approximately 80% of his attacking power.This was not bad already, keeping in mind that his overall battle power was at 201 points now. This meant that Earth Element Shield was able to neutralize a third to half of a full-fledged attack of a one-star high-class martial warrior.This was enough to save his life in critical times.Furthermore, as long as he had ample earth Force, the defense ability of his earth Force could still be increased.Enlightenment: 90Spirit: 22.8Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Beginner stage earth talent (12/300), Spiritual sight (beginner stage 1.1/10)Force: 64/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)8/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)7/100 Earth (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red Flame Scripture (foundation 20/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 12/100), Earth Loess Skill \u2018Earth Element Shield\u2019 (foundation 15/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (mastery for fist, sword, blade, footwork), Basic Stick Skill (foundation), Gun Skill (small achievement), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 43/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 13/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks), \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 (80 points)Overall Battle Power: 201Blank Attribute: 0Wang Teng nodded in satisfaction when he looked at the changes in his attributes board. It was improving at a visible rate. This was enough to delight him.Besides cultivation, Wang Teng also guarded against the team that the earth element martial warrior had mentioned before his death.The three martial warriors that died were probably just a part of a martial warrior team. Their disappearance would definitely raise the attention of the other team members.He hoped that those people wouldn\u2019t be able to find him out\u2026Friday arrived. \u2018Master Lu\u2019 flagship store, where Wang Teng had ordered his weapon carrier casket, finally responded to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Hurry Up And Become A Certified Martial WarriorMaster Lu: Dear, your little basket is ready (*^_^*)!\u2026What did he mean by little basket!Why can\u2019t he type properly?The happiness in his heart instantly turned into a stomach full of complaints that he couldn\u2019t vent.The other party immediately sent a photo over\u2014Weapon carrier casket.jpgThe appearance of the weapon carrier casket was a little different from the last time he saw it. The color was changed to black. At the same time, there were a few silver runes on the surface. The whole thing looked extremely mysterious.Not bad~ it\u2019s just a little eye-catching.Is this person a runemaster?Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but guess.Wang Teng: You even added runes?Master Lu: That\u2019s right, dear. Relying solely on the mechanism is getting outdated. Hence, I added some runes to add finishing touches. As long as you activate the rune, the weapon you need will spring out with a swoosh. It\u2019s really convenient to use.Wang Teng: Not bad. In that case, the price should be higher, right?Master Lu: The price doesn\u2019t matter. My grandfather will be elated if I\u2019m able to sell this weapon carrier casket. It\u2019s alright to spend some effort on this matter.This was a good person!That\u2019s right, he is a filial and good person!Wang Teng gave him a long-distance good man card.Wang Teng: Alright, I will pay and order now. You can send the casket to me immediately.Master Lu: Sure! Yay (\u8279\u76bf\u8279)Wang Teng noticed that the person on the other end really loved to use emoticons.This person must have graduated from the emoticon university!If that wasn\u2019t the case, the Chinese Academy of emoticons owed him a certificate of graduation.Wang Teng: Why don\u2019t you give yourself another nickname for future use? You can call yourself Crazy for Emoticons!Without requiring the other person\u2019s approval, Wang Teng gave the person a loud and pleasant nickname.The price of the weapon carrier casket had already been changed on Taobao. It was ten thousand now.Wang Teng clicked it to place the order.Suddenly, a prompt popped up\u2014\u2019Sorry, you have not entered the martial warrior identification number. You can\u2019t place the order!\u2019\u201c??\u201dWhat the hell?What is a martial warrior identification number?Why do you need a martial warrior identification number to buy something on Taobao? Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me about this!Wang Teng was stunned. He quickly asked the other party.Wang Teng: You need a martial warrior identification number to buy the things in your shop?Master Lu: Yes, dear!Master Lu: What\u2019s the issue? (\u30fb\u2200\u30fb(\u30fb\u2200\u30fb(\u30fb\u2200\u30fb*)Wang Teng remained silent for a few seconds before asking: What is a martial warrior identification number?Master Lu: It\u2019s the number on your martial warrior credential!\u2026This explanation was amazing. It was the same as not explaining.Wang Teng had no choice but to remain patient. He asked the other party: Where can you get the martial warrior credential?This person must be obtuse.Master Lu: You can take the test at the martial arts association. Dear! Are you saying that you don\u2019t have the credentials?#!Dear, what dear!An asterisk sign suddenly appeared on Wang Teng\u2019s temple. You would definitely get a heart attack when talking to this person.Wang Teng: Why does your shop need the martial warrior identification number?Master Lu: Because our shop is a high-class flagship store. All our products are meant for martial warriors, so we need the martial warrior identification number to prove that you are one. It\u2019s all written in the visitor information. Dear, did you not see it? O_o\u2026Wang Teng hurriedly browsed to the front to take a look. He stared at the screen for a long time before he finally found the visitor information at a corner.@\u00a5#%\u00a5\u2026He suddenly wanted to curse. The guy had hidden this small line of words within the ten thousand words item description. Who would be able to see it?Wang Teng asked: Can you send the item first? I\u2019ll give you the martial warrior identification number afterward.Master Lu: I can\u2019t do that, dear!Wang Teng: Why not?Master Lu: A martial warrior must be certified before he can use rune weapons.Wang Teng: There\u2019s such a rule?Master Lu: Yes. Hurry up and become a certified martial warrior. As long as your background is clean and you don\u2019t have any criminal records, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. The entire process won\u2019t take more than half an hour. It\u2019s very fast.Wang Teng nodded as he contemplated.\u00a0Really?You need to have a clean background and no criminal records to become a certified martial warrior?It looks like the authorities were strict with the standard of martial warriors!But, the martial warriors I met just killed people as and when they liked. Why is that so?Wait! I killed someone too. Is that considered a crime?If no one finds out about it, it shouldn\u2019t\u2026 be considered, right?\u00a0Wang Teng consoled himself by repeating this sentence like a heart mantra.Wang Teng: I will get the certification first then.Master Lu: Alright. When you get your credentials, I can send it out right away. You will be able to receive your baby later tonight (\u3003\u2019\u25bd\u2019\u3003).Wang Teng was shocked. He asked: I can receive it tonight? That\u2019s really fast! What delivery service are you using?Master Lu: You will know when you receive your package~\u2026I have to skip my lesson again!It was morning, and he had just finished two lessons. Yet, something cropped up again.Wang Teng felt a little helpless. He said to Lin Chuhan, who was beside him, \u201cClass Monitor\u2026\u201dLin Chuhan was absent-minded. She wanted to ask Wang Teng for help, but she was hesitating. She didn\u2019t know how to open her mouth.When she heard Wang Teng calling her abruptly, she had a huge shock.\u201cWhat?\u201dLin Chuhan almost jumped out of her seat. She turned her head warily and looked at Wang Teng. She thought that he had noticed her lack of focus and attention.Wang Teng was dumbfounded.I just called you. Do you have to give such a big reaction?He was speechless, but he had to continue, \u201cI need to go out and do something later. You understand.\u201d Wang Teng winked at Lin Chuhan.Lin Chuhan heaved a big sigh of relief. So he didn\u2019t see through her intentions. What a scare!\u201cWait, you want to skip classes again? The university entrance exam is arriving soon. Do you have any sense of urgency at all!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t do anything I\u2019m not confident in.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m leaving!\u201dWang Teng waved his hand and walked out of the classroom.Lin Chuhan was slightly astounded. That was really daring of him.\u00a0Can he really do it? Or was he just boasting?\u2026The martial arts association was an official authority formed by different nations in the world to have unified management of the martial warriors.A martial warrior needed to register with the martial arts association and get the martial warrior credentials to have a legal identity. Then, they would be able to get special privileges not enjoyed by ordinary people.For instance, martial warriors could kill people!Of course, this didn\u2019t mean that they could kill anyone whenever. They needed to have a valid reason. If not, they would be punished by law.Martial warriors could also use rune weapons.In public transportations like high-speed railways and airplanes, ordinary people were not allowed to carry weapons. However, martial warriors were able to keep weapons on them legally if they displayed their martial warrior credentials.There were many other benefits too. It was unwise to list them all one by one.Wang Teng researched online and found all these pieces of information. That was when he knew how important the martial warrior credential was to a martial warrior.Many things would become extremely convenient for him.Of course, if he received the martial warrior credential, it also meant that he was indirectly accepting the country\u2019s supervision. He wouldn\u2019t be able to disobey the law outrightly.This was to protect ordinary civilians.Powerful people used their power to break the law!These weren\u2019t words without evidence.When someone possessed great power, they would start to act without any fear. It was hard to control them.At the start of the martial arts era, many riots had occurred. As time went by, the country sent out a large number of martial warriors to suppress the violence\u2026That was when those people who considered themselves invincible understood that the country was still their country. They couldn\u2019t act unbridledly whenever they wanted.Hence, the martial arts association was indispensable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Congratulations To My Country!Donghai martial arts association.Wang Teng stood at the huge entrance and looked at the building in front of him. The size had left him amazed.This was a high-rise building with a sharp octagon tower. The exterior was unique and iconic. From afar, among all the buildings in this area, the first noticeable thing was definitely this huge octagon building.A large crowd was walking back and forth in front of the building at this moment. Many people left and entered the building too.Wang Teng looked around him. These people were all exuding a faint sense of extraordinary\u2026Most of these people are martial warriors!\u00a0Wang Teng was flabbergasted by his guess as he exclaimed in his heart. He was mostly sure of it.This was the first time he had seen so many martial warriors. Wang Teng got a little nervous. He took a deep breath to calm his nerves. After exhaling, he walked into the huge building.When Wang Teng took a step in, many people focused their gazes at him. There was astonishment in their eyes as they sized him up.However, they couldn\u2019t see Wang Teng\u2019s face. This was because he was wearing an Ultraman mask\u2026Everyone\u2019s gaze was a little strange. Some people indeed wore masks to apply for their martial arts credentials. After all, everyone had secrets. They didn\u2019t want to expose themselves.But, this was the first time they saw someone so strange. He was wearing an Ultraman mask.This person must be a joke!Fortunately, they knew that no one dared to create trouble at the martial arts association.Also, from the aura that Wang Teng released purposely\u2026They could discern that he was a martial warrior!Thus, no matter how weird he seemed, no one would be so bored to create trouble for themselves.\u201cHello, I came to apply for the martial warrior certificate,\u201d Wang Teng came to the front desk and said to the staff opposite him.The staff member raised her head. It wasn\u2019t difficult to imagine her fascinating expression when she saw the Ultraman mask right before her eyes.She forcefully controlled her laughter and nodded sternly. \u201cAlright, follow me.\u201dUnder her guidance, Wang Teng arrived outside another room.\u201cPlease go in. You just need to follow the instructions on the wall and operate the machine. If there\u2019s no problem, the system will enter your particulars into the system, and your martial warrior credentials will be out in less than ten minutes.\u201d The staff raised her hand to signal to him as she explained the procedure to him.Wang Teng nodded while listening intently.After he entered the room, the staff closed the door behind him.Wang Teng scanned his surroundings and saw a machine right next to the wall. It looked like an ATM.A sense of familiarity rose in his heart.Beside the ATM-style machine, there was another machine that looked like the sleeping pod in fantasy movies.Wang Teng had used the physique inspection device at Jixin Martial House before. However, this machine looked much more complicated than the one in the martial arts academy.Still, he knew that this was a physique inspection machine. It was just a machine that was designed for martial warriors.As compared to martial disciples, the physique of martial warriors would undergo huge changes. Thus, their physical inspection was far more complex.The production cost of this machine should be at least a few million. It was more than ten times the cost of the physique inspection machines for martial disciples.Wang Teng took off his Ultraman mask.Based on the procedure, he came in front of the ATM-style machine and placed his identification card in the sensing area.\u201cPlease scan your fingerprint and retina.\u201dWang Teng listened to the instruction and pasted his hands on the two palm drawings in front of him. At the same time, he looked right into the camera in front.\u201cFingerprints collected.\u201d\u201cBeep, retina scanning completed.\u201d\u201cVerifying identity\u2026\u201dApproximately three minutes later, the voice sounded again.\u201cIdentity verified\u2014Wang Teng, 17 years old. Citizen of China. No criminal records. Clean background\u2026 Meet the 108 requirements to become a martial warrior. Verification passed.\u201d\u201cPlease enter the physique inspection device for your physique inspection.\u201dEven though he knew that there was nothing wrong with his identity, Wang Teng was still a little nervous. He only let out a small breath of relief when he heard that he had passed the verification.He stepped into the physique inspection device next.The device\u2019s door closed slowly. It started scanning and inspecting his entire body.Wang Teng didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion, but he felt as though there was an invisible hand touching him from head to toe.At the same time, he felt his Force nucleus tremble slightly for a moment. The Force inside received some stimulation and got a little restless.\u2026The inspection ended very quickly. The automated voice rang in his ears again.\u201cInspection ended.\u201d\u201cWang Teng, congratulations on becoming a martial warrior.\u201d\u201cThe martial warrior credential is being printed. Please wait patiently.\u201d\u2026At this moment, outside the entrance of the martial warrior association, a black sedan stopped slowly. A man with spiky hair that looked like steel spikes came down the car.It was the principal of Jixin Martial House, Fu Tiandao.A refined middle-aged man came forward and welcomed him. He smiled and said, \u201cOld Fu, you\u2019re really hard to meet. I invited you multiple times, but you only agreed to come today.\u201d\u201cThere are many things to take care of at the martial arts academy. I can\u2019t leave as I want,\u201d Fu Tiandao replied concisely.\u201cSeriously.\u201d The refined man felt a little helpless. He raised his fingers and pretended to tap the spiky hair man.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you have prepared top-quality Jade Dragon Tea from Xingwu Continent? Hurry up and lead the way,\u201d Fu Tiandao looked at the refined man sideways as he said.\u201cCome, come, come, I\u2019ve already prepared it. I was just waiting for you to come.\u201d The refined man laughed. He raised his hand and walked into the huge building first.While the two of them were chatting and walking, there was an uproar around them.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the principal of the Donghai branch Jixin Martial House, Fu Tiandao?\u201d\u201cTo see him once is better than to hear about him a hundred times. His aura is overwhelming!\u201d\u201cOf course. Do you know how powerful he is? He\u2019s able to represent the Donghai branch of Jixin Martial House. Donghai City is a huge and important city. This proves how powerful his ability is.\u201d\u201cWho is that refined man? He\u2019s actually able to invite Fu Tiandao over!\u201d\u201cIdiot, that is the president of the Donghai branch martial arts association, President Qin Hanxuan.\u201d\u201cOh my god, I\u2019m blind. The real person is right in front of me, but I didn\u2019t recognize him.\u201d\u201cHe is a powerful figure too\u2026\u201dDiscussions rang out in the vicinity. Even after Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan had left for a long time, everyone was still indulged in talking about their achievements.Everyone knew about their achievements, but as the iconic figures of Donghai City, the citizens of Donghai City never stopped pursuing and flattering them.\u2026Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan chatted with each other as they took the lift to the building\u2019s highest floor. They arrived at Qin Hanxuan\u2019s office.The moment they entered the office, they could see an entire wall of floor-to-ceiling windows.It was right in front of the entrance.From this office, one could get a bird\u2019s eye view of the entire Donghai City. It felt like standing on the highest peak and looking at the smaller mountains below.The coffee table was placed beside the floor-to-ceiling window.\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Qin Hanxuan said casually.\u201cYour place is not bad,\u201d Fu Tiandao said calmly. He walked in front of the floor-to-ceiling window and gazed at the busy streets below.Qin Hanxuan sat down and started making tea in a natural and graceful manner. The faint fragrance of tea wafted in the room.He said, \u201cSigh. It\u2019s lonely to be in a high position. It doesn\u2019t feel good to stay in this office every day.\u201d\u201cPretentious.\u201d Fu Tiandao sneered.\u201cNothing good comes out of your mouth. Have some tea. Have some tea.\u201d Qin Hanxuan felt helpless as he poured tea for Fu Tiandao.Fu Tiandao sat down and took a sip. He savored it with closed eyes. Then, he opened his eyes and said, \u201cIndeed, this is a good tea.\u201d\u201cOf course. I had to put down this old face of mine before I could take some tea from the governor,\u201d Qin Hanxuan said proudly.\u201cWhere is Governor Jiang now?\u201d Fu Tiandao raised his eyebrows and asked.\u201cThe last time I saw him, Governor Jiang was preparing to break through to the general stage.\u201d Qin Hanxuan turned serious.\u201cOh? Is he confident?\u201d Fu Tiandao\u2019s expression changed, and he asked anxiously.\u201cBased on what he said, he\u2019s around 60% confident,\u201d Qin Hanxuan replied.\u201c60%? That\u2019s too low. Why didn\u2019t he wait for a while longer?\u201d Fu Tiandao frowned and took a deep breath.\u201cI heard that Governor Li of Jinlin has already reached general-stage half a month ago.\u201d Qin Hanxuan suddenly dropped an atom bomb.\u201cWhat! Are you serious?\u201d Fu Tiandao jumped to his feet.\u201cSit down; sit down. Of course, it\u2019s real. Do you think I will make such a mistake?\u201d Qin Hanxuan rolled his eyes.\u201cWe have another general now. Congratulations to my country!\u201d Fu Tiandao\u2019s eyes were shimmering.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed a matter worth celebrating.\u201d Qin Hanxuan nodded in agreement.\u201cHowever, Governor Jiang is too reckless. How could he act on impulse?\u201d Fu Tiandao changed the topic back. He seemed a little worried.\u201cYou know that those two have been arch enemies since they were in university. They fought for their entire life. How could Governor Jiang take this matter calmly?\u201d Qin Hanxuan explained with a bitter smile.\u201cThat is true.\u201d Fu Tiandao couldn\u2019t do anything either.\u201cI hope that Governor Jiang will be able to get through this obstacle smoothly. At that time, Donghai will be able to have another general-stage martial warrior\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: The Interest Of The Two BossesWhile Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan were chatting casually, the computer in the office gave off a sound.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Fu Tiandao looked at Qin Hanxuan.\u201cLet me take a look.\u201d Qin Hanxuan got up and walked in front of the computer. He saw a message pop-up on his screen.He scanned the message and felt astounded.\u201cOld Fu, come over and take a look!\u201d he shouted at Fu Tiandao, who was at the side.Fu Tiandao got up and walked over.\u201cThis person became a martial warrior at 17 years old.\u201d Fu Tiandao was also slightly shocked when he saw the message on the screen.Upon reading Wang Teng\u2019s name, he frowned.\u201cWang Teng. This name sounds a little familiar.\u201d\u201cOh, do you know him?\u201d Qin Hanxuan asked in surprise.Fu Tiandao thought for a moment before continuing abruptly, \u201cI remember him. A few days ago, one of my staff handed me a data report. If these two don\u2019t share the same surname and name, I think the report I received was about him.\u201cOpen the surveillance camera to take a look. We will know if it\u2019s the same person.\u201dQin Hanxuan operated his computer, and within a second, the scene in Wang Teng\u2019s room was projected on the opposite wall.\u201cThat\u2019s right; it\u2019s him. He looks the same as his picture.\u201d Fu Tiandao immediately recognized Wang Teng.\u201cOh, right, what report were you talking about just now?\u201d\u201cThe report shows that this fellow rose from a normal person to an advanced stage in less than a month after he joined our martial arts academy,\u201d Fu Tiandao replied.\u201cHaha, Wang Teng must have started his cultivation before he joined your martial arts academy. Look at his background. He\u2019s the third generation of Donghai\u2019s Wang family. His family probably doesn\u2019t lack resources and can let him practice martial arts,\u201d Qin Hanxuan smiled and said.\u201cI think so too. At first, I wanted to observe him for a while more, but he has already become a martial warrior. It looks like he\u2019s really a genius,\u201d Fu Tiandao exclaimed.It was rare to see a 17 years old martial warrior.\u201cSeems like there will be a black horse in the martial arts exam this year.\u201d Qin Hanxuan smiled.\u201cShall we take a look?\u201d Fu Tiandao tried his best to remain calm and indifferent, but he did seem very interested in this young lad.\u201cSure, let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u2026Wang Teng didn\u2019t know that the moment he became a martial warrior, he had received the attention of two bosses. It was really scary!Ten minutes later, the printing of the martial warrior identification was completed.Looking at the black booklet in his hand, he smiled in glee.Wang Teng wore his 3D Ultraman mask and left the martial arts association.When he returned to the school, the last morning lesson hadn\u2019t ended yet. Everyone was still in class, so Wang Teng didn\u2019t disturb the teacher\u2019s lecture.He arrived at the little forest and logged in to his Taobao. He entered his martial warrior credential and placed his order.This \u2018Master Lu\u2019 was quite interesting. He didn\u2019t allow his customers to place orders if they didn\u2019t have a martial warrior credential. You could be stubborn with anything, but when it came to money, one must be flexible!Forget it. Looking at the other party\u2019s tone, he probably doesn\u2019t lack money.After placing the order, Wang Teng sent a message to hurry the stall owner: I\u2019ve already placed my order. Please send the item as soon as possible!\u201dMaster Lu: Alright dear \u03b5=( \u0301\u03bf`*)))The other party responded with one sentence.After some time, the lesson ended. Wang Teng met Xu Jie and his other friends in the cafeteria for lunch. He also saw Li Rongcheng and Yuan Zhenghua, whom he hadn\u2019t seen for a few days.The moment Li Rongcheng saw Wang Teng, his face turned black.After that day, Zhou Baiyun actually came to ask him about Wang Teng.At first, Zhou Baiyun viewed Li Rongcheng with high importance. He felt that he had a chance to win the heart of this third young lady from the Zhou family. He had his whole life ahead planned. He would marry a rich beauty and proceed to the peak of his life.The Zhou family would definitely be a great help to him.At that time, he, Li Rongcheng, would be a famous figure in Donghai City. He wouldn\u2019t just be a rich second generation relying on his father.However, Wang Teng, it just had to be Wang Teng again. This fellow had stolen the limelight that was supposed to be his. Even Zhou Baiyun got interested in Wang Teng.Damn it!Li Rongcheng felt annoyed in his heart.\u201cYoung Master Li, are you here for lunch too?\u201d Wang Teng casually greeted Li Rongcheng when he saw him.\u201cHmph!\u201d Li Rongcheng scoffed. He walked straight ahead.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? How did I provoke him again?\u201d Wang Teng asked Xu Jie, who was beside him, with a confused expression.\u201cWho knows!\u201d Xu Jie shrugged.\u2026During the afternoon rest time, Wang Teng went to practice in the small forest. He only returned to the classroom when the lesson started.It was the last day of the week, so he should give some respect to his teacher.Three lessons ended quickly.After school, Wang Teng got up and prepared to go home. However, Lin Chuhan stopped him.\u201cYou, wait for me.\u201d She bit her lip and seemed a little embarrassed. But, in the end, she still plucked up her courage and called Wang Teng out.Wang Teng had already noticed that she was a little absent-minded. Hence, when he saw her calling him, he stopped in his tracks. He wanted to know what she had on her mind.Lin Chuhan finished packing her bag and went out of the classroom with Wang Teng.The two walked to a secluded spot with no one around.Lin Chuhan started hesitating again, and her expression kept changing. One moment, she seemed helpless, while the next, she looked resolute.\u201cIf you have any difficulties, you can just tell me,\u201d Wang Teng said in a soft voice.Maybe Wang Teng\u2019s gentle attitude had caused Lin Chuhan to cement her resolve. She took a deep breath and said, \u201cCan you\u2026 lend me some money?\u201dAfter she said this sentence, Lin Chuhan seemed dejected. A hint of helplessness and bitterness flashed past her eyes.\u201cHow much do you need?\u201d Wang Teng suddenly felt something touching his heart when he saw her expression.This girl had a hard life!He believed that Lin Chuhan must have reached a state of desperation to look for him to borrow money. If not, with her high self-esteem, she wouldn\u2019t talk to him about this at all.\u201c150\u2026 150 thousand!\u201d Lin Chuhan found it hard to speak. She hurriedly continued, \u201cI know it\u2019s a little too much, but I\u2019ll definitely return the money to you as soon as possible. After the university entrance exam, I will work part-time. Once I have the money, I will\u2026\u201dWang Teng was a little dumbfounded.He was a bit curious about the reason why Lin Chuhan needed such a huge sum of money. However, Wang Teng didn\u2019t probe further. He took out his phone and said, \u201cGive me your Alipay account. I will transfer the money to you now.\u201d\u201c\u2026return the money to you!\u201d Lin Chuhan heard what Wang Teng said before she finished her sentence. Her eyes turned red, and she took a deep breath to calm down. Then, she forced a smile on her face and said, \u201cThank you!\u201cI will return the money to you as soon as possible.\u201dShe emphasized this once again, as if this was the only way she was able to keep the remnants of self-esteem left in her heart.\u201cThere\u2019s no hurry. Just do what your strength allows.\u201d Wang Teng nodded. He scanned her Alipay account and transferred the money over.Many things were different in this world. For instance, Alipay supported transfers of large sums of money. There was no limit to the sum.Lin Chuhan thanked him once again and held her phone tightly. The 150 thousand RMB felt extremely heavy in her hand. Their family didn\u2019t even have this much savings during their prime.To a family like Wang Teng\u2019s, a few hundred thousand might just be their pocket money. However, many normal families might not be able to save this amount of money even after many years.\u201cI wonder what difficulty she\u2019s facing.\u201dWang Teng looked at Lin Chuhan\u2019s back view as he wondered to himself. He felt a little worried, so he followed her secretly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: I Just Came To Get Rid Of A Few FliesWang Teng followed Lin Chuhan all the way and noticed that she was just going home.He saw her entering her house from afar. Just as he was planning to leave, Wang Teng noticed a bunch of people walking over.The leader of the group was a bald man wearing a black suit.There were a few youngsters following him. They looked like gangsters.Wang Teng stopped in his tracks and lit a cigarette. He stood at the side of the road and started smoking.\u201cWhat are you looking at? You little brat!\u201d The bald man wearing a black suit saw Wang Teng staring at them, so he scolded him fiercely.Wang Teng didn\u2019t say anything. He turned his head away.The bald man wearing a black suit didn\u2019t pester him, either. He just walked into Lin Chuhan\u2019s house angrily.Lin Chuhan\u2019s house was a three-floor apartment. It looked really old. The first floor was the shopfront, where they had opened a small convenience stall.The bald man had barged into Lin Chuhan\u2019s family stall. He grabbed a bottle of coke and took a swig.The middle-aged lady in the shop should be Lin Chuhan\u2019s mother. She stood at the side fearfully, not daring to say a single word to stop the man.After burping, the bald man turned and looked at the middle-aged woman. He said, \u201cHow is it? Have you prepared the money?\u201d\u201cBoss, my girl is already borrowing money from our relatives. Please spare us a few more days,\u201d the middle-aged woman pleaded.\u201cSpare a few more days? I\u2019ve already spared you three. Is that not enough? Huh?\u201dThe bald man wearing a black suit glared at the woman and kicked a box filled with candies beside him. The candies instantly flew and scattered everywhere.\u201cI think that you don\u2019t plan to return the money, right?\u201d\u201cBoss, we really have no such intentions. We just haven\u2019t gathered all the money yet. Please give us two or three more days. Please!\u201d The middle-aged woman got frightened and shrank in a corner. Her eyes were red as she spoke.\u201cStop spouting nonsense. If you don\u2019t give me the money today, I\u2019ll destroy your stall!\u201d The bald man didn\u2019t show any intention of softening his attitude.\u201cThis\u2026 you can\u2019t do this. Our entire family relies on this convenience stall for a living. My daughter still needs to take her university entrance exam. If you smash our shop, how are we supposed to live!\u201d The middle-aged woman was so anxious that she started tearing up.\u201cWho cares about your lives! It looks like you can\u2019t return the money today. Do you think I\u2019m doing charity? Hey, destroy this place!\u201dThe bald man wearing a black suit arrogantly sat on the chair and waved his hand. His lackeys were about to smash the shop on his order.\u201cStop!\u201dA voice came from upstairs.Lin Chuhan ran down the stairs. Upon returning home, she went to the bathroom. The moment she came out, she heard the commotion below and came down in a flurry. As expected, those people were here to look for them again.\u201cHey!\u201d The bald man\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw Lin Chuhan.\u201cWhy did you come down?\u201dThe middle-aged woman panicked. She hurriedly pulled Lin Chuhan behind her and said to the bald man wearing a black suit, \u201cBoss, my daughter is still young. This matter has nothing to do with her. Don\u2019t mind what she said.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that she\u2019s young anymore.\u201d The bald man stood up, and his gaze roamed Lin Chuhan\u2019s body, as if a wolf was looking at its prey.Lin Chuhan didn\u2019t back down at all. She stood out from behind the middle-aged woman and said, \u201cMy family owes you 150 thousand, right? I can return it to you now. Take the money and get out of my house.\u201d\u201cHaha, you\u2019re quite bold. How can you have 150 thousand?\u201d The bald man wearing a black suit gave a contemptuous smile.\u201cYou little girl, we don\u2019t have so much money.\u201d Lin Chuhan\u2019s mother frowned. She thought her daughter was fooling around, so she wanted to pull her behind her again.Lin Chuhan\u2019s mother understood the bald man\u2019s gaze too clearly. They weren\u2019t kind people. Her daughter was just a high school student. She couldn\u2019t fight with them at all.Lin Chuhan wasn\u2019t moved. \u201cGive us the receipt for the loan. I will transfer you the money now.\u201d\u201cDid this young lady really manage to get the money? She\u2019s so pretty, so there might really be someone willing to lend her money,\u201d the bald man wearing a black suit muttered to himself softly.He looked at Lin Chuhan\u2019s beautiful face that was full of vitality. His heart was burning with desire. He immediately thought of an idea and sneered.\u201cAlright. As long as you return the money to us, we will leave. However, 150 thousand RMB was three days ago. Three days have passed. Let me calculate. Now, you owe us\u2026 200 thousand!\u201cWhat do you think, little girl? Do you have 200 thousand?\u201d\u201c200 thousand? It\u2019s been only three days. How did it increase to 200 thousand?!\u201d Lin Chuhan\u2019s mother\u2019s face turned pale. It was hard to tell if it was because of fear or anger.\u201cYou\u2019re despicable!\u201d Lin Chuhan\u2019s body trembled in anger.At first, they had only borrowed 100 thousand from these people. Then, they told them that the interest for three months was 50 thousand. Their family couldn\u2019t afford to offend these loan sharks, so they bowed down to fate and went around asking for money.But, after so many years, they had already borrowed money from most of their relatives. All of them knew the condition of Lin Chuhan\u2019s family.Lin Chuhan\u2019s father was paralyzed in bed and didn\u2019t have the ability to work. Her younger sister was down with a strange illness. Only Mother Lin had opened a convenience stall to support the entire family.Lending money to their family was like throwing it into a bottomless pit. They might be able to return small amounts of money, but no one dared to lend them a huge sum.A while ago, when Lin Chuhan took so much effort to put down her ego and borrow 150 thousand from Wang Teng, she thought that she could finally clear this bad debt.She didn\u2019t expect the other party to be so despicable. Now, they wanted to add another 50 thousand RMB because they had delayed payment for three days!\u201cLittle girl, don\u2019t talk nonsense. I\u2019m such a righteous person. How can I be despicable?\u201d the bald man said nonchalantly.\u201cThis is illegal. I can sue you,\u201d Lin Chuhan gritted her teeth.\u201cGo ahead. I won\u2019t stop you. However, it might be hard for you to continue opening your shop in the future.\u201d The bald man sneered.\u201cYou!\u201d Lin Chuhan pointed at him. She was so angry that she couldn\u2019t speak.\u201cIt looks like you still can\u2019t pay us back. This is difficult\u2026 How about this? I don\u2019t have a girlfriend. If you\u2019re willing to be my woman, I can forfeit this loan for your family,\u201d the bald man sniggered and said.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Don\u2019t even think about it. Even if I can\u2019t open my shop anymore, don\u2019t even think about touching my daughter.\u201d Mother Lin was like a tigress exploding in anger. She blocked Lin Chuhan behind her and glared at the bald man wearing a black suit.Lin Chuhan\u2019s expression had also turned ugly. There was a hint of anxiousness in her eyes. She didn\u2019t expect the other party to have this intention. She had underestimated the evilness of a person\u2019s heart.\u201cIn that case, we won\u2019t be polite anymore\u2014\u201dThe bald man gave a sinister smile. However, before he could finish his sentence, a voice sounded behind him.\u201cWhat do you want to be impolite for?\u201dThe bald man turned his head. \u201cBrat, it\u2019s you!\u201d\u201cWang Teng!\u201d Lin Chuhan also saw the newcomer. For some reason, she found a sense of reliance in her heart.\u201cHmph, you know each other.\u201d The bald man wearing a black suit squinted and sized up Wang Teng. \u201cAre you trying to save the beauty?\u201d\u201cSave the beauty? Not really,\u201d Wang Teng thought for a moment before replying.\u201cHahaha, look at how timid he is.\u201d The bald man burst out laughing. His lackeys started mocking and jeering at Wang Teng too.\u201cI just came to get rid of a few flies,\u201d Wang Teng continued calmly.The bald man\u2019s face turned black. He was actually looked down upon. The indifferent expression on this brat\u2019s face irked him tremendously.\u201cYou are courting death!\u201d he said word by word.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Don\u2019t Talk Nonsense When You Planned To Run Away\u201cHmm~ How do I court death?\u201d Wang Teng tilted his head and asked.The bald man wearing a black suit: \u2026The lackeys: \u2026Lin Chuhan kept her face straight and tried her best not to laugh when she saw the confused expression of the gangsters.Mother Lin felt that this child was a little naughty.I wonder whose child he is.The bald man wearing a black suit flared up in anger. He pointed at Wang Teng and shouted, \u201cBeat him! Beat him to death!\u201dThe lackeys rushed towards Wang Teng at once. A few of them even took out knives from their pockets.Wang Teng retreated out of the convenience stall.Once he moved, the gangsters also followed him out. They surrounded Wang Teng. Unfortunately, they were just normal people while Wang Teng was a martial warrior. Even if he had been just a martial disciple, dealing with these weaklings would be a piece of cake.He swung his fist and hit two gangsters at once. He knocked them to the floor, and a few teeth fell out of their mouth.Strength*1Strength*1Spirit*0.1Oh? Normal people will drop attributes too? There\u2019s even the spirit attribute? Wang Teng was surprised.\u201cBe careful! Behind you!\u201d Lin Chuhan rushed out and wanted to help. She was an intermediate stage martial disciple, after all. She could deal with these gangsters.But, Wang Teng didn\u2019t give her a chance to act as he kicked his leg behind. The three gangsters with knives in their hands, who wanted to slash his waist, flew three meters out.They clutched their chests. Blood seeped out of the corner of their lips.Wang Teng hadn\u2019t used his full force. Still, the power of his kick was too much for the gangsters to handle.Strength*1Strength*1Strength*1\u201cYou\u2019re a martial disciple!\u201d The bald man\u2019s expression changed. He didn\u2019t expect that his lackeys couldn\u2019t even take a single blow from Wang Teng.\u201cBrat, you\u2019re forcing me to act.\u201d The bald man wearing a black suit took off his coat and walked in front of Wang Teng.\u201cI\u2019m not forcing you to do anything. You don\u2019t have to fight,\u201d Wang Teng said.The bald man was stunned. He quickly shook his head to clear the unnecessary thoughts before shouting angrily, \u201cF**k, don\u2019t talk glibly.\u201dHe circled Wang Teng, seemingly looking for Wang Teng\u2019s weakness.Wang Teng stood on the spot and waited for him to act first. However, after circling two rounds, the bald man suddenly ran off\u2026He was running away?That was right, he ran away! He ditched his lackeys and ran away without turning back.To show his respect for the man\u2019s action, Wang Teng was slightly shocked.Lin Chuhan and Mother Lin were stunned too.When the bald man\u2019s lackeys saw their boss running away like a happy pig, they suddenly didn\u2019t know what expression to give.\u201cYoung lad, this matter hasn\u2019t ended. Just wait and see!\u201dThe bald man quickly ran to a corner of the road. Once he felt that he was a safe distance, he stopped, turned around, and shouted.Wang Teng shook his head. He scanned the floor around him and picked up a brick.His action scared the bald man. He turned around and ran away in fright.On the other side, Wang Teng calmly weighed the brick. He took aim for a second and threw the brick out.Whee~\u201cAh!\u201dThe bald man screamed in pain and fell to the ground.Spirit*0.1Did it really hit his head? Wang Teng looked at the spirit attribute that just dropped and pondered to himself.For some reason, when the lackeys saw this scene, they felt a little elated.Wang Teng slowly walked forward and squatted down to look at the bald man. \u201cThis is why you shouldn\u2019t talk nonsense when you\u2019re running away.\u201dThe bald man wearing a black suit covered his head. He felt his vision getting blurry. He took some time to get rid of this feeling before he raised his head.He glared at Wang Teng viciously.\u201cYou\u2019re dead, brat. You\u2019re dead. We have martial disciples in our company too. They\u2019re advanced stage martial disciples, and there are a few of them. Just wait to die.\u201d\u201cHmph, you\u2019re quite fierce.\u201d Wang Teng smiled. He raised the brick and smashed it on the bald man\u2019s face again.Crack!Splurt!The bald man\u2019s nose broke, and blood splattered out. It was so painful that he kept screaming shrilly like a pig being slaughtered.Spirit*0.1Wang Teng\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m dead, but I know that you\u2019re definitely dead.\u201dWhile speaking, Wang Teng raised the brick again under the other party\u2019s horrified gaze and smashed it down.At the start, the bald man was still quite tough. His gaze was fierce, and he glared at Wang Teng like a ruthless wolf.But, now, he was scared. This youth in front of him looked like a high school student with a smile on his face. His expression was calm and composed, but when he decided to act, it was really terrifying.\u201cStop hitting me! I\u2019m wrong, I will not do it again, please let me go\u2026\u201dThe bald man\u2019s face was severely bruised and swollen. He couldn\u2019t speak properly, so he sounded a little tongue-tied. There was only fear left in his mind.This young man was too ruthless!He was really ruthless.Ouch~ this is so painful!\u201cI didn\u2019t want to hit you before, but I feel that you\u2019re not very convinced by me. So, I had to hit you reluctantly,\u201d Wang Teng said after he stopped beating the man.He didn\u2019t want to stop hitting the bald man. Instead, he had to stop because after dropping some spirit attributes, the bald man stopped dropping them no matter how much he hit him. What a pity!In total\u2014Spirit*0.4The bald man looked at the sky. Suddenly, he wanted to cry.Since you\u2019re so reluctant, you don\u2019t have to hit me. No one is forcing you.Mom, this person must be a devil! I want to go home!\u201cSo, are you convinced or not?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cYes (Hu)! I\u2019m convinced!\u201d The bald man nodded hurriedly.Wang Teng dumped the brick on his head again.\u201cAh! Why are you hitting me now?\u201d The man screamed in terror. He was confused.\u201cDo you think you\u2019re playing mahjong? Who\u2019s asking you if you \u2018Hu\u2019 (in Chinese, Fu means convinced and \u2018Hu\u2019 means a win in mahjong) or not?\u201d Wang Teng widened his eyes.\u201cI\u2026\u201d The bald man was extremely frustrated. He even wanted to vomit blood. He kept quiet for a long time before saying a single word, \u201cYes (Fu)!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Wang Teng nodded.Bang!Unexpectedly, the bald man suffered a knock on his head again.\u201cWhy?\u201d Tears welled up in his eyes. He felt so wronged, but he had nowhere to vent it.\u201cFor no reason. I just don\u2019t like you,\u201d Wang Teng explained calmly.The bald man: \u2026\u201cGive me the loan receipt.\u201dThe bald man obediently took out the loan receipt. Wang Teng called Lin Chuhan over and passed it to her. \u201cTake a look at it and see if this is the correct one.\u201dLin Chuhan went back and confirmed with her mother. She returned and nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right. This is the one my dad and mom wrote.\u201dWang Teng took it over and scanned it. He then mocked, \u201cThey borrowed 100 thousand, and you wanted them to return 200 thousand? This is much easier than being a robber.\u201dHe squatted down and waved the brick in front of the bald man\u2019s face. \u201cIn the past, I met five people who wanted to rob a bank. They wanted to kill me, but do you know what happened to them in the end?\u201dThe bald man suddenly remembered a piece of news he had heard a few days ago.A few robbers who robbed a bank got killed by someone!He heard that the person who killed them was a hostage. Also, the hostage was a high school student!The bald man looked at Wang Teng in fear. He couldn\u2019t help but tremble, his heart pounding in his chest.\u201cBang!\u201d Wang Teng suddenly exerted force in his fingers and broke the brick in his hand. He said, \u201cLook, this is what happened to them.\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026 I know my mistake. I was really wrong. Please spare me.\u201dThe bald man really wanted to cry. He had come to get a loan back and tease a young lady along the way. Why did he have to offend this devil?He must have forgotten to look at the almanac when he went out this morning!That\u2019s right, this must be the reason.Wang Teng didn\u2019t scare him anymore. He said to Lin Chuhan, \u201cTransfer the money to him. 100,100 RMB. The additional 100 is the interest.\u201d\u201cDo you have any objections?\u201d The last sentence was directed at the bald man wearing a black suit.\u201cNo, no!\u201d The other party shook his head in a hurry. At this moment, he didn\u2019t dare to have any objection. He still wanted his head to be on his neck.He had heard that those robbers\u2019 heads were smashed into meat paste by the hostage\u2026Oh my god, this was so scary!Lin Chuhan hurriedly transferred the money.Wang Teng took out a lighter and lit up the loan receipt right in front of the bald man. He burnt the whole piece of paper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Family BackgroundThe bald man in a black suit left with a swollen and bruised face. His heart was filled with injustice and fear. He needed to go back to answer his boss.He knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the interest for this loan.The other party was a powerful figure, the heartless kind that might shatter your head if he got angry. He couldn\u2019t afford to provoke him.His boss probably didn\u2019t want to offend this kind of person as well, right?Fortunately, he got back the loan amount. This trip wasn\u2019t a waste.But, his face got smashed by the brick for nothing\u2026 Ouch! Pain!Sigh~\u2026After getting rid of the loan sharks, Lin Chuhan heaved a sigh of relief. She said to Wang Teng, \u201cWang Teng, thank you for helping me just now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Wang Teng shook his head. When he kept his lighter, he took the opportunity to light a cigarette.\u201cDon\u2019t smoke anymore,\u201d Lin Chuhan suddenly said.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cSmoking is bad for health,\u201d Lin Chuhan replied.\u201cThat is scary. Let me smoke a bit to calm down,\u201d Wang Teng answered.Lin Chuhan: \u2026\u201cI\u2019m just teasing you.\u201d Wang Teng threw the cigarette on the ground and extinguished it with his feet.It wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to smoke in front of a lady.\u201cOh, right. Why are you here?\u201d Lin Chuhan suddenly asked. She was curious about his perfect timing.\u201cWill you believe me if I say that I followed you?\u201d Wang Teng smiled.Lin Chuhan\u2019s heart jumped. She turned her head and felt her ears turning warm. She put down her hair to cover it up.\u201cI\u2019m not talking to you anymore. I\u2019ll go and take a look at my mum.\u201dLin Chuhan ran back to the convenience store and explained everything to her mother. She told her that the loan sharks were gone and the loan receipt had already been burnt.Mother Lin hugged Lin Chuhan and cried in joy. She almost went crazy from the torment these people had given her the past few days.\u201cOh right, Little Han, who did you borrow the money from? Tell him that even though we don\u2019t have so much money now, we will definitely return it to him as quickly as possible,\u201d Mother Lin wiped her tears and said.\u201cI borrowed it from him.\u201d Lin Chuhan looked in Wang Teng\u2019s direction.\u201cAh, he\u2019s just a young man. Where did he get all the money from?\u201d Mother Lin was surprised.\u201cHis family runs a company,\u201d Lin Chuhan explained.Mother Lin was enlightened. Then, she suddenly thought of something and asked curiously, \u201cLittle Han, you\u2026\u201dLin Chuhan looked at her mother\u2019s expression and immediately knew what she was thinking. She stomped her feet and complained sweetly. \u201cMom~ what are you thinking? He\u2019s my table buddy.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, alright. I\u2019m not thinking about anything. Mom is not thinking of anything,\u201d Mother Lin said quickly.\u201cYou little girl, why aren\u2019t you inviting him to our house? He did our family a huge favor. I want to personally thank him.\u201dLin Chuhan wanted to call Wang Teng over, but she noticed that he was already walking towards them.\u201cMy mom says that she wants to thank you personally,\u201d she told Wang Teng.\u201cThat\u2019s right, Little Teng. I hope you don\u2019t mind me calling you this way. I really have to thank you for this time. If not, our family wouldn\u2019t have known what to do.\u201d Mother Lin was full of gratitude.\u201cI don\u2019t mind. Auntie, Chuhan is my table buddy. She has helped me a lot, so I should help her when she has difficulties,\u201d Wang Teng replied.\u201cGood, good, Little Han is lucky to have a table buddy like you.\u201dThe more Mother Lin looked at Wang Teng, the more she liked him. This was a good child. He was just a little naughty\u2026But, you could tell that he was a responsible person who had a bright future. He was polite, and he took care of Little Han well. If he could be her son-in-law\u2026 that would be great.During the martial arts era, one could get married at 18 years old. Mother Lin felt that she could start considering her daughter\u2019s marriage.\u201cStay here tonight for dinner.\u201d Mother Lin suddenly got enthusiastic. \u201cAuntie will go and buy some ingredients immediately. Little Han, take care of Little Teng.\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she didn\u2019t give Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan any time to react. She directly rushed out of the door.Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan exchanged glances with each other. The atmosphere had become a little strange.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I\u2026 leave first?\u201d said Wang Teng.\u201cLeave your head. My mom has already gone out to buy food. If you leave, how will I explain to her when she comes back?\u201d Lin Chuhan rolled her eyes.\u201cJust find a random excuse. For instance, you can tell her that I have some urgent matters to attend to,\u201d Wang Teng gave her some suggestions.Lin Chuhan looked at Wang Teng.Why doesn\u2019t this fellow want to stay at my house?She was a little embarrassed, for sure, but Wang Teng\u2019s unwilling expression made her a little uncomfortable and unhappy.\u201cYou can explain to her personally if you want to. I\u2019m not explaining.\u201d Lin Chuhan glared at Wang Teng.\u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s just a meal. I, Wang Teng, am not afraid at all.\u201d This was what Wang Teng said, but he looked as though he was going to the execution field.Lin Chuhan finally understood his emotions when she saw his reaction. This fellow wasn\u2019t actually unwilling; he was just a little scared. Usually, he didn\u2019t seem afraid of anything. She almost forgot that he was a teenage boy too.She couldn\u2019t help but laugh secretly behind his back.Wang Teng stood in the shop, uncertain of what to do. He looked at the candies scattered on the ground and went over to pick them up.Lin Chuhan regained her senses. Her gaze turned gentle as she looked at Wang Teng\u2019s back view. She squatted down and started cleaning the candies with him.\u201cI will transfer you the remaining money later,\u201d she remembered the leftover money and said.\u201cOkay!\u201d Wang Teng nodded.\u201cAs for the 100 thousand RMB, I will work part-time during the summer vacation to return it to you,\u201d Lin Chuhan continued.\u201cThat\u2019s not right. It\u2019s 100,100 RMB,\u201d Wang Teng smiled and replied.\u201cYes, yes, yes, it\u2019s 100,100. You\u2019re such a miser.\u201d Lin Chuhan rolled her eyes.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Wang Teng laughed casually. He didn\u2019t mind her reaction.Lin Chuhan didn\u2019t realize that the respect hidden in his words was what allowed them to continue their relationship as normal. They didn\u2019t suffer any estrangement because of this matter.\u2026After some time, Mother Lin came back with the ingredients. She was carrying many bags in her hands and had bought a lot of fish meat.\u201cLittle Teng, you can sit upstairs with Chuhan. I\u2019ll go and make food.\u201d Mother Lin greeted them before she got busy in the kitchen.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201d Lin Chuhan led Wang Teng up the stairs.\u201cIsn\u2019t Uncle around?\u201d Wang Teng asked.Lin Chuhan bit her lips as she said, \u201cHe\u2019s here. I\u2019ll bring you to see him.\u201dWang Teng saw Lin Chuhan\u2019s father. He was a drunk and skinny man, and his legs were gone.\u201cHow did your father\u2026 became like this?\u201d Wang Teng was really shocked.\u201cMy father used to be a martial warrior. One day, after coming back from the Xingwu Continent, he became like this. His teammates managed to save him after much difficulty, but his legs were gone. Even his Force nucleus was broken. He came a crippled,\u201d Lin Chuhan explained in low spirits.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Wang Teng knew that the martial arts world wasn\u2019t as beautiful as the public made it out to be, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be so cruel.He even felt a little frightened when he saw the ghastly wounds on Father Lin\u2019s body.Also, he didn\u2019t think Lin Chuhan\u2019s father could be a martial warrior.\u201cSince you know how brutal the martial arts world is, why do you still practice martial arts? Why do you still want to take part in the martial arts exam?\u201d Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but ask her.\u201cI want to take revenge!\u201d Lin Chuhan closed the door and gritted her teeth as she said.\u201cIt\u2019s caused by someone?\u201d Wang Teng was flabbergasted once again.\u201cMy dad\u2019s teammates say that he became like this because their opponents had set a trap,\u201d Lin Chuhan explained.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Demon Lotus Poison BodyWang Teng suddenly remembered that in his past life, he had heard about Lin Chuhan\u2019s paralyzed father. Unexpectedly, in this lifetime, her situation was still the same.But, in this lifetime, Lin Chuhan\u2019s father was a martial warrior and became paralyzed because of other people\u2019s plots.\u201cOh right, what about your father\u2019s teammates? Don\u2019t they know the situation in your family?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cIn the past, they helped us a lot. However, most of their time is spent in Xingwu Continent. Sometimes, they might not be able to come back for a few months. This time, they are already away for half a year.\u201d\u201cHalf a month ago, my younger sister\u2019s illness suddenly flared up. My mom had no choice. With other people\u2019s recommendation, she could only borrow money from those people to pay for my sister\u2019s treatment fees,\u201d Lin Chuhan said.\u201cYou still have a younger sister? What illness does she have?\u201d Wang Teng realized that he knew nothing about Lin Chuhan\u2019s family.\u201cI always had a younger sister. You just don\u2019t know about her. Her illness\u2026 sigh, it will be good if we could know what illness it is. That way, we won\u2019t be at a loss of what to do.\u201d Lin Chuhan sighed.As she spoke, she brought Wang Teng to the door of another room and knocked. \u201cChuxia, I brought a friend over. Can I come in?\u201d\u201cCome~ in~\u201dA young lady\u2019s faint voice came from the room. The way she spoke was very strange. She spoke a word for word, but there was no break in between the words. She seemed a little feeble and lifeless.If one suddenly heard this voice in the middle of the night in the dark, they would probably pee in their pants.Wang Teng felt goosebumps appearing on his skin.Lin Chuhan gave a dry laugh. \u201cPlease don\u2019t mind her. My sister has always been like this.\u201dShe pushed the door open\u2014Creak~The wooden door gave a shrill screech due to the friction on the hinges. The room was dark. The curtain was closed tightly, and no ounce of light was able to enter the room.Wang Teng scanned the room. There was no human in sight at all.But\u2014He saw a sea of\u2026 bubbles!What is this?Wang Teng was dumbfounded in an instant.Attribute bubbles filled up the entire room. They were on the ground, the table, the chair, the bed, in front of the cupboard\u2026They were everywhere. The room was densely populated with big and small bubbles.Wang Teng swallowed his saliva. He couldn\u2019t wait to enter the room.\u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d Lin Chuhan stopped him in a hurry. Then, she reminded him, \u201cI think you better follow behind me. Remember not to get too close later.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Wang Teng was puzzled.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later,\u201d said Lin Chuhan in a low voice.Then, she entered the room first and spoke to a corner between the legs of the bed and the wall. \u201cChuxia, Sis is coming in.\u201dWang Teng followed her gaze and finally saw a young lady hugging her knees in a blind spot at the corner of the bed. Her head was buried between her knees. She had long black hair, flowing straight down smoothly\u2014The hair was long, black, and straight!He looked at Lin Chuhan. Yes, they looked the same!Then, his focus turned to the attribute bubbles scattered around him. He was already full of anticipation.What kind of attribute bubbles are these?This was the first time he saw a normal person dropping so many attribute bubbles. Even more, these bubbles had dropped naturally. This was very abnormal!Could it be related to Chuhan\u2019s younger sister\u2019s strange illness?Wang Teng guessed secretly. Then, he lightly touched the bubbles beside him\u2014He picked them up!Poison Force*2Poison Force*1Demon Lotus Poison Body*1Instantly, Wang Teng felt something changing in his body. He sensed a strange, rare Force in this world.Poison Force!This kind of force actually existed? Wang Teng was dumbfounded.After that, the poison Force entered Wang Teng\u2019s body. He had never practiced any poison Force skill scriptures before, so the poison Force instantly exploded and started running helter-skelter in his body.Damn it!\u00a0Wang Teng was astounded.If someone observed the skin on his body and his face, they would notice that there was a layer of purple-red color in them.He looked as though he got poisoned.However, the occult energy immediately pacified the poison Force and congregated all of it in the Force nucleus. It soon formed an equilibrium with the other three Forces in the nucleus.The strange color on his skin subsided within a second like the waves of the sea.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Lin Chuhan turned her head and asked.\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Wang Teng regained his composure and smiled.At the same time, the young lady squatting in the corner seemed to have sensed something. She raised her head and curiously looked at Wang Teng.Wang Teng\u2019s heart jumped a little when he saw the young lady\u2019s appearance.The frame of her face was very similar to Lin Chuhan\u2019s. She should be a pretty lady too. However, there were purple-red poison spots on both sides of her cheeks. They covered more than half of her face.The poison spots were rough and bumpy. They looked extremely disgusting. They destroyed all the beauty on the face and even made it hideous and terrifying. It was hard to look at her face for long.Wang Teng stared into the eyes of the young lady. His heart skipped a beat, but he didn\u2019t feel any loathing towards her.He just felt that the young lady was very pitiful. She was at the prime of her life, but she could only hide in the darkness of her room. She couldn\u2019t live like a normal person.She didn\u2019t even dare to take a single step out of her house. Wang Teng could imagine how much hate and jeers she must have received in the past.This should be the strange illness Lin Chuhan was talking about.Demon lotus poison body!This must be a very rare physique. If it wasn\u2019t, Lin Chuhan\u2019s father would have found a cure a long time ago since he was a martial warrior. They wouldn\u2019t be at a loss even until now.If the martial warriors couldn\u2019t find a solution for this kind of physique, the current medical industry wouldn\u2019t be able to find a cure either.The martial arts era and the technology era were two different systems. Before the martial arts era started, this physique had never appeared.Therefore, there were no successful cases of treatment in the medical industry.The solution might only be found in the Xingwu Continent.\u201cSister~ who is he?\u201d The young lady sized up Wang Teng again. However, the feeling she had just now had disappeared. A hint of disappointment flashed in her eyes.\u201cHis name is Wang Teng. He\u2019s my friend.\u201d Lin Chuhan squatted down in front of the young lady, but she didn\u2019t get too close to her. There was at least one meter distance between them.Wang Teng kind of understood why Lin Chuhan didn\u2019t allow him to get close to her younger sister.Right now, he could feel poison Force continuously surging out of the young lady\u2019s body. The air around her was saturated with poison Force.If an ordinary person got too close, they would definitely get affected. If the interaction was too long, they would be poisoned. In severe cases, they might die immediately.This was how horrifying the demon lotus poison body was!\u201cIs he my brother-in-law~\u201d the young lady suddenly asked Lin Chuhan.Pfft!\u201cBrother-in-law!\u201d Lin Chuhan was dumbstruck. Her entire face turned red within a split second. \u201cStupid girl, what are you saying! He\u2019s not your brother-in-law.\u201dWang Teng almost burst out laughing. This young lady was such a good assist!\u201cOh~\u201d The young lady tilted her head and gave an ambiguous response. There were no emotional changes on her face.Lin Chuhan felt helpless. She got up and said to Wang Teng, \u201cThis is my younger sister, Lin Chuxia. Don\u2019t mind what she said.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so nervous?\u201d Wang Teng made fun of her.\u201cI\u2019m not nervous!\u201d Lin Chuhan got nervous because of his stare.Wang Teng smiled. Then, he stepped past Lin Chuhan and walked towards Lin Chuxia.\u201cDon\u2019t go over!\u201d Lin Chuhan wanted to stop him quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201dWang Teng waved his hand. Before Lin Chuhan could block him, he had already squatted down in front of Lin Chuxia. He lifted his hand. \u201cHello!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Am I Walking In The Wrong DirectionLin Chuxia\u2019s eyes widened slightly as she looked at Wang Teng\u2019s stretched-out hand in front of her.Lin Chuhan was also shocked by Wang Teng\u2019s sudden action. She was the one who had the best understanding of her younger sister\u2019s condition. Anyone who got within one meter radius of her would get affected, much less direct body interaction.She wanted to stop Wang Teng, but Lin Chuxia opened her mouth first. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid of me?\u201d\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cAfraid of my face! Afraid of the air around me.\u201d\u201cLook at me. Do you think I seem affected?\u201d Wang Teng smiled and asked.Lin Chuhan, who was standing beside them, was astounded. She stared at Wang Teng in disbelief.Indeed.A normal person would have already felt uncomfortable at such a close distance. Their faces would start turning green too.However, Wang Teng looked unaffected.\u201cWang Teng, you\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably because I always drink goji berry tea, so my immunity is better,\u201d Wang Teng said in all seriousness.Lin Chuhan: \u2026What do you mean by your immunity is stronger because you drink goji berry tea? Do you think I\u2019m stupid?Why can\u2019t you be more serious? This is a serious matter.Lin Chuxia observed him for a long time. At last, her eyes lit up, and she continued, \u201cYou really look alright~\u201dShe slowly stretched out her hand. She was a little hesitant at first, but she still held Wang Teng\u2019s palm.The next second, Lin Chuxia was dumbstruck.She didn\u2019t know how to explain this feeling. A cold stream of air seemed to have stirred up in her body. It started flowing around her limbs and bones, rejuvenating her.Just as she was about to inquire about it, she saw Wang Teng winking at her mysteriously.The words at the edge of her lips stopped right there.Wang Teng smiled gently and released Lin Chuxia\u2019s hand. He then stood up. At the same time, he didn\u2019t forget to collect the attribute bubbles around her.Demon Lotus Poison Body*7Poison Force*15Undoubtedly, the number of attribute bubbles around her body was the most.After picking up everything, Wang Teng felt that the demon lotus poison body within him was becoming more and more complete. The poison Force in his body had also increased.On the other hand, Lin Chuxia felt the pressurizing and sticky feeling in the air around her, which made her feel like there was a layer of liquid covering her, disappear suddenly.But, she didn\u2019t probe further. She just curiously sized up Wang Teng.A bud of hope had bloomed in her heart\u2026Lin Chuhan had been observing Wang Teng from the start. She keenly noticed that he wasn\u2019t affected even after the physical interaction. While she heaved a sigh of relief, she felt even more puzzled.\u201cWang Teng, what on earth is happening? Why aren\u2019t you affected by my sister\u2019s weird illness?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know either. Maybe it\u2019s really because my immunity is stronger.\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t tell Lin Chuhan the truth.Right now, he didn\u2019t know how to solve Lin Chuxia\u2019s illness. If he said anything, it would just make Lin Chuhan happy for nothing.He would tell her when he had some direction. It wouldn\u2019t be too late then.As for Lin Chuxia, he let her know about it because he wanted her to have some hope. If a young lady like her lived her life hopelessly every day, there would be problems sooner or later.Lin Chuhan curiously sized up Wang Teng.\u201cIf you really know something, I hope that you can tell me. This is extremely important to my family,\u201d she said seriously in the end.\u201cSister, don\u2019t make things difficult for Brother-in-law,\u201d said Lin Chuxia.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve already said that he\u2019s not your brother-in-law.\u201d Lin Chuhan was speechless.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If I really have a solution, I will tell you right away,\u201d Wang Teng promised.Lin Chuhan nodded. She seemed a little dejected when she saw that Wang Teng didn\u2019t have a solution.After some time, she lifted up her spirits and squatted down. She then said to Lin Chuxia in a serious tone, \u201cChuxia, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ve already applied for the martial arts exam. I\u2019ll definitely become a martial warrior in the future and help you to find a treatment for your strange illness.\u201d\u201cSister, I thought that Mom doesn\u2019t allow you to practice martial arts?\u201d Lin Chuxia exclaimed in surprise.Lin Chuhan hurriedly raised her forefinger and placed it beside her lips. \u201cShh, speak softer. You can\u2019t let Mom know about this matter.\u201dWang Teng was speechless.\u00a0Why are you asking your younger sister to speak softer? Who was the one speaking so loudly just now?However, he finally understood why Lin Chuhan didn\u2019t tell her mother about her application for the martial arts exam.What happened to Lin Chuhan\u2019s father must have stimulated Mother Lin greatly.As a mother, how could she allow her daughter to follow in her husband\u2019s footsteps? Even if there was just a slight possibility, she would kill the problem in the cradle.Dinner wasn\u2019t ready, so Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan stayed in the room and chatted with her.Lin Chuhan was happy that another person was hanging around with Lin Chuxia. Usually, only Mother Lin and she were able to accompany Lin Chuxia. This young lady was too lonely.Wang Teng used the free time in the middle of the chat to pick up all the attribute bubbles in the room.Demon Lotus Poison Body*5Poison Force*12\u2026He pulled out his attributes panel to take a look.Enlightenment: 90Spirit: 26Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Beginner stage earth talent (12/300), Spiritual Sight (beginner stage 1.1/10), Demon lotus poison body (15/10000)Force: 64/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)8/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)7/100 Earth (one-star soldier level martial warrior)30/100 Poison (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red Flame Scripture (foundation 20/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 12/100), Earth Loess Skill \u2018Earth Element Shield\u2019 (foundation 15/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (mastery for fist, sword, blade, footwork), Basic Stick Skill (foundation), Gun Skill (small achievement), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 43/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 13/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks), \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 (80 points)Overall Battle Power: 218Blank Attribute: 0He could see the additional \u2018demon lotus poison body\u2019 in his talent column. Wang Teng felt that this physique was powerful. He looked at its upper limit\u201410000!How long was he supposed to collect this attribute?But, it also reflected how extraordinary and amazing this demon lotus poison body was.Then, he turned to look at the poison Force. It had already reached 30 points, higher than the ice Force and earth Force.This poison baby Lin Chuxia had plenty of reserves!Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but exclaim to himself. At this moment, he already had a general plan of how to use the poison Force.In the future, while fighting with his opponents, he would secretly mix some poison Force into his other Forces. He would poison his opponents before they could understand what happened!Tsk, this is perfect.He seemed to be walking further and further on the path of becoming a sinister fellow.Am I walking in the wrong direction?\u00a0Wang Teng examined his conscience and asked himself.After some time, Mother Lin finished cooking dinner and called them to eat.When she saw Wang Teng and Lin Chuxia interacting harmoniously, she was elated. She even asked Wang Teng to visit their house more often in the future.On the dinner table, only Mother Lin, Lin Chuhan, and Wang Teng were present. Father Lin was dead drunk. He was unconscious now.Lin Chuxia wasn\u2019t able to join them. Mother Lin had carried the dishes into the room for her.On the dining table, Wang Teng felt really uncomfortable because of Mother Lin\u2019s enthusiasm. The rice bowl in front of him was piled high with rice, looking like a small hill. Wang Teng was dumbstruck.Lin Chuhan laughed secretly at the side when she saw Wang Teng\u2019s awkward expression.After dinner, Wang Teng almost ran away in a flurry.\u201cRemember to come often to play,\u201d Mother Lin reminded him as she sent him to the door.Lin Chuhan and Wang Teng walked to the main road together.Wang Teng\u2019s sports car was parked at the side of the road. He stopped walking and opened the car door. \u201cHurry up and go home.\u201dLin Chuhan nodded. She said, \u201cThank you for everything today!\u201dWang Teng waved his hand and drove away in his car. Lin Chuhan stood rooted on her spot. No one knew what she was thinking. She just blankly stared into space for a long while\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He didn\u2019t dare to tell his parents that he ate at Lin Chuhan\u2019s house.If not, based on how gossipy his parents were, he honestly didn\u2019t know what they would do.He didn\u2019t even dare to think about it!Not long after, he arrived at Jixin Martial House.Wang Teng went straight to the third floor of the training building. He started collecting attribute bubbles.After one night and the accumulation of the previous nights, his Basic Footwork, Basic Blade Skill, Basic Sword Skill, and Basic Fist Skill had finally reached the \u2018presence enlightenment\u2019 stage.Now, a casual punch of his fist, slash of his sword, and wave of his blade came along with the force of presence. In a battle, he was able to frighten his opponent with his presence first.Even his footwork possessed the ability of illusion. It became even harder to predict his movements.Although they were all basic battle techniques, once they reached the \u2018presence enlightenment\u2019 stage, they were able to unleash extraordinary potential.Wang Teng felt relieved. Now, his basic battle techniques had attained the peak. He was unable to upgrade them anymore!He also realized that the attribute bubbles of these battle techniques never appeared again. He wasn\u2019t able to pick them up even if he wanted to.Farewell forever. I will miss you~Besides this, after the past few days of picking up attributes and today\u2019s attribute collection, his Basic Stick Skill reached the big achievement stage.Next would be perfected, mastery, and presence enlightenment.\u2026At 11 pm, Wang Teng left Jixin Martial House and returned home.He finished the supper Li Xiumei had prepared and went upstairs to take a bath. He felt so comfortable that he breathed out and prepared to lie down to rest.Suddenly, a series of knocks came from outside his window.\u201cWhat is it?\u201dWang Teng jumped up and subconsciously used his Spiritual Sight to look out of the window.There was a ball of blue light!It wasn\u2019t strong, but it was indeed the light of Force.Dull blue, what attribute is this?Wang Teng heaved a sigh of relief. This level of Force wasn\u2019t a threat to him. At the same time, he was confused. He had never seen an attribute in this color before.\u201cKnock, knock, knock!\u201dThe living creature outside the window knocked on the window impatiently.I think it\u2019s a bird.\u00a0But, how did it fly here? He went to the window while remaining on full alert.Wang Teng opened the window.It was a Scotland round face fat chicken!He was slightly shocked. Wang Teng shifted his gaze downwards and saw a rectangular object placed beside the feet of this round-face fat chicken. The object was packaged tightly.There was a line on the package\u2014Owl Delivery, Mission Guarantee!??Delivery!And it says mission guarantee!Is this really the martial arts era?This world is not invaded by the magical world?Wang Teng realized that he was really a frog in a well. He took some time to regain his senses before accepting the fact that this was a delivery.Suddenly, he remembered something and hurriedly took out his phone to contact the owner \u2018Master Lu.\u2019 He took a picture and sent it to the owner. Wang Teng: Is this your delivery?Master Lu: Yes, dear. Are you surprised? Are you amazed? Are you happy~The other party responded within a second.Even though it was almost midnight, he still replied immediately.Is this shop owner in front of his computer 24 hours a day?Also, what did he mean by surprised, amazed, and happy? Can he not act so naughty to me!Right now, he finally understood why \u2018Master Lu\u2019 was so secretive. Who would have thought that the delivery would be made by an owl?Was the world of martial warriors so magical?Also, the owner, \u2018Master Lu,\u2019 didn\u2019t lie. This delivery was really fast!It was a trans-provincial delivery. It was sent in the afternoon and actually arrived at night!This was amazing!Wang Teng replied: Can this round face fat chicken be eaten? I suddenly want to eat barbecue!Master Lu: Round face fat chicken?Master Lu: Barbecue?The other party was utterly stunned. At a moment like this, shouldn\u2019t he feel surprised and elated? Why did he want to eat the round-face fat chicken? What kind of mentality was this?Pfft, what round face fat chicken? It was an owl!Master Lu: Why don\u2019t I help you order some food? \u0304\u03c9 \u0304=Wang Teng: \u2026\u00a0The other party actually believed me.At this moment, the round-face fat chicken got even more impatient. It started crowing a few times.It would never guess what kind of evil thoughts the person in front of it had.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Thanks for waiting!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he remembered that this wasn\u2019t a delivery man. It was an owl. However, the owl had a look of disdain on its face!A look of disdain\u2026F**k, who could even imagine an owl giving a look of disdain?Wang Teng took a deep breath and tried his best to gather his broken vision of the world. He then untied the package on the owl\u2019s feet.\u201cCoo, coo~\u201dThere was a small bag hung around the owl\u2019s body. At this moment, the owl used its claws to take a receipt and a pen out from the bag and placed them in front of Wang Teng.This round-face fat chicken was so smart that it made Wang Teng dumbfounded.He scanned through the receipt before signing his name on it. The owl put the receipt and pen back in the bag and cooed. Then, it flew off.It was so swift that it disappeared in the night sky in a blink of an eye.Wang Teng looked at the back view of the round face fat chicken. His mind was filled with the \u2018Owl Delivery, Mission Guarantee!\u2019. The line kept flashing in his mind.He quickly shook his head!Wang Teng closed the window and went back to his bed. He then excitedly opened the package. A black wooden box was revealed.\u201cWeapon carrier casket!\u201dWang Teng stroked the silver runes on the weapon carrier casket. The more he looked at it, the more he liked it.The owner was very thoughtful and even gave him a black handbag as a gift. He was able to carry it in his hand or on his back as a backpack.If he placed the weapon carrier casket in the bag and zipped it, other people wouldn\u2019t be able to tell what was inside.Perfect!\u2026The next day, it was Saturday.Wang Teng continued his routine of visiting Jixin Martial House. Along the way, he greeted the students that he was familiar with\u2026\u201cBrother Peng, you\u2019re really early! How hardworking!\u201d\u201cHey, young man, exercise is youth. Hurry up and start practicing!\u201d Peng Hai had perspiration all over his face. He revealed his bronze skin and raised his thumb as he gave Wang Teng a wide smile.He was the senior brother who had taught Wang Teng the ninth set of radio exercises.When Wang Teng went to the third floor for the first time, he had met Peng Hai not long after. Upon seeing Wang Teng, the guy was extremely shocked.After all, when he first saw Wang Teng, Wang Teng was still a newbie who didn\u2019t know how to do the ninth set of radio exercises properly.Well, he still didn\u2019t know how to do it\u2026But that wasn\u2019t the main point. The most important thing was, Wang Teng became an advanced stage martial disciple?When faced with this question, Wang Teng still used the same reason to slip his way through. He told his senior that he had practiced martial arts before.As for the ninth set of radio exercises, it was all history\u2026Many children from wealthy families didn\u2019t like to do this exercise. After all, it was very embarrassing. They had better ways to train their physique.Thus, Peng Hai didn\u2019t dwell on this too much.\u201cYou little brat came late today. Hurry up and duel with me!\u201d When Zhang Shaoyang saw Wang Teng, his eyes turned into light bulbs. He pulled Wang Teng and wanted to practice his fist skill with him.\u201cHave you forgotten how badly you lost the other time? How could you have the face to fight with me?\u201d Wang Teng teased him.Ever since Wang Teng\u2019s Basic Fist Skill entered the mastery realm, Zhang Shaoyang never beat him anymore.Now, his Basic Fist Skill had reached the \u2018presence enlightenment\u2019 stage. If they had a duel again, hehe\u2026\u201cMy fist skill improved greatly after sparring with you. It\u2019s almost at the mastery stage now. This time, I won\u2019t lose to you again,\u201d Zhang Shaoyang scoffed and said in a proud tone.\u201cSince you are looking for a beating so wholeheartedly, I\u2019ll satisfy you.\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t say anything more. He shook his head and gave him a look of concern, as though he was looking at an idiot.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell who will lose!\u201d Zhang Shaoyang was furious. He clenched his fist and attacked Wang Teng\u2026A few minutes later!Zhang Shaoyang covered his eyes. \u201cF**k, don\u2019t you know that you shouldn\u2019t hit someone\u2019s face? Why are you so vicious!\u201d\u201cYou should feel fortunate that I only hit your face. You attacked the lower part of my body just now. If it was someone I didn\u2019t know, I\u2019d have beaten him up until he questioned his life!\u201d Wang Teng sneered.Zhang Shaoyang laughed awkwardly. \u201cWho asked you to be so perverted? You have actually reached the presence enlightenment stage. There\u2019s no way I can retaliate. That\u2019s why I used this treacherous method. It\u2019s the only thing I could use.\u201d\u201cTsk, so it\u2019s my fault? Who was the one asking for abuse just now?\u201d Wang Teng looked at him with contempt.\u201cF**k!\u201d Zhang Shaoyang was speechless. He indeed seemed to be asking for it just a few minutes ago.He didn\u2019t dare to ask Wang Teng for a duel anymore. He muttered to himself as he walked to the side and started practicing his fist skills on his own.Wang Teng shook his head. The gap between the two of them was getting wider and wider. There was no point in sparring with him.He turned around and saw an attribute bubble that had just disappeared. His heart pained for a second before he started collecting all the other bubbles immediately.I, Wang Teng, have never stopped wanting to become stronger.Strength*2Speed*1Spirit*0.3Basic Stick Skill*3Blank Attribute*3Spirit*0.5\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Teng was shocked.It appeared! The blank attribute appeared again!Blank Attribute*3!Wang Teng thought for a moment and directly added the 3 points of the blank attribute to his Spiritual Sight.Until now, he had never discovered any attributes that were able to raise his Spiritual Sight talent. Hence, he could only use his blank attribute.One day ended. Before he slept, Wang Teng pulled out the attributes panel.Enlightenment: 93Spirit: 31Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Beginner stage earth talent (12/300), Spiritual Sight (beginner stage 1.4/10), Demon lotus poison body (15/10000)Force: 64/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)8/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)7/100 Earth (one-star soldier level martial warrior)30/100 Poison (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red Flame Scripture (foundation 20/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 12/100), Earth Loess Skill \u2018Earth Element Shield\u2019 (foundation 15/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (presence enlightenment for fist, sword, blade, footwork), Basic Stick Skill (perfected), Gun Skill (small achievement), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 43/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 13/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks), \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 (80 points)Overall Battle Power: 221Blank Attribute: 0Wang Teng was satisfied as he looked at the changes on top.Recently, both his enlightenment and spirit had increased, and it had a direct effect on him. His mind felt clearer and sharper, and he seemed to have become quicker in his thinking.After adding 3 blank attributes to his spiritual sight talent, it was at 1.4 points now. The number seemed a little sad, but at least it had increased.Also, because Wang Teng only focused on his Basic Stick Skill today, this technique rose really quickly. After one day of accumulation, it jumped another level and reached the perfected stage.On the other hand, his gun skill remained the same. Ever since killing the bank robbers, he had never seen another gun skill attribute.Rune guns were popular weapons. Many martial warriors practiced gun skills, and their skills had reached a high degree of technical proficiency. Its power was astonishing.Wang Teng didn\u2019t belittle the uses of Gun Skill. This skill had helped him kill a martial warrior in the past.Thus, if he had a chance, he would increase his Gun Skill attribute too.Being a sharpshooter was a good persona~Pew, pew, pew~If he couldn\u2019t solve something with one shot, he\u2019d use two. It was very tiring to be half-dead.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, he stepped into the lobby of the club.The Owl Marksmanship Club was a high-class place for the wealthy of the society.It was extremely famous in Donghai. This was the first choice of many wealthy young masters and rich young ladies who loved to play with guns.As the club was crowded with gun enthusiasts, there must be many attributes that would drop. Although most of them were here for thrill and excitement and were not professionals, there were bound to be some who possessed real skills.Wang Teng went to the front desk to finish the application process. He paid the money and immediately became a member of the club.The staff treated him with respect\u2014This was how amazing it felt to become a member!Under the guidance of a beauty wearing a black sheath dress, Wang Teng arrived at the target field. He scanned the surroundings, and a smile appeared at the corner of his lips.Many attribute bubbles were floating on the ground.One, two, three\u2026Wang Teng knew that he didn\u2019t waste his trip here. He didn\u2019t waste his money to apply for the membership either.The beauty wearing a sheath dress explained some details to him. Then, Wang Teng asked her to leave. He started wandering around the place himself.Gun Skill*2Gun Skill*1Gun Skill*1\u2026Wang Teng almost wanted to laugh out loud when he saw his gun skill attribute increasing continuously.All sorts of marksmanship techniques appeared in his mind. At the same time, his body\u2019s familiarity with guns became stronger and stronger. His eyes grew sharper, and his accuracy increased a whole lot.He felt that as long as he held a gun, he would be able to apply some tricky maneuvers easily. He could also shoot an object a hundred meters away without breaking a sweat.This feeling was exhilarating!As his Gun Skill attribute increased without pausing, Wang Teng\u2019s hand suddenly got itchy when he saw other people having fun.Thus, he ran to the staff and got himself a gun. He found an empty spot and started fulfilling his addiction.Wang Teng first familiarized himself with the gun in his hand.This was a rune gun from the \u2018Owl series.\u2019 The design was rugged and handsome, with a wild kind of beauty to it. Only people who loved guns would be able to appreciate it, though.He raised his gun and aimed at the target.His actions were smooth. He did everything right from the start to the end in a single move. It seemed as though he was a professional who had played with guns for many years.Bang!He pulled the trigger.The body of the gun vibrated. A normal person wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the force of the recoil, but Wang Teng\u2019s hand was extremely stable. It didn\u2019t shake at all.Bang, bang, bang!He didn\u2019t stop at just that. Wang Teng fired a few more shots, and his posture didn\u2019t change the whole time.However, someone with sharp eyes would be able to notice that he adjusted his wrist and elbow slightly every time he fired. He didn\u2019t stay in the same position throughout the entire duration.Ten points!Wang Teng put down his gun while feeling a little unsatisfied.The difficulty was too low. He couldn\u2019t enjoy himself thoroughly.He continued picking up attributes. Occasionally, he would fire a few shots to cover up his actions. If not, he would be too conspicuous, attracting other people\u2019s attention.\u2026\u201cGood! Good gun skill!\u201dA shout was suddenly heard.Wang Teng walked over and noticed a bunch of people gathered together. They were watching a middle-aged man firing his gun.The man had a number two haircut. His face was firm and stern, faintly exuding the aura of a soldier.At this moment, he was hitting the moving targets. He fired occasionally and would hit the bull\u2019s eye every single time.The other non-professionals at the side couldn\u2019t help but cheer for him.Finally, someone who has good skills!\u00a0Wang Teng\u2019s eyes lit up. He squeezed through the crowd and inched closer to the man. He then picked up the attributes on the ground.Gun Skill*10Gun Skill*7Gun Skill*13\u2026Impressive!The attributes this man dropped were equivalent to the combined attributes Wang Teng picked up from more than 10 non-professionals.Master!This must be a master!This was the difference between a master and an amateur.Wang Teng glanced at his attributes panel. His gun skill had finally jumped from small achievement to the big achievement stage. Its strength had increased greatly!\u201cBrother, your gun skill is god-like!\u201dAfter the man finished shooting, someone immediately went forward and started chatting with him.\u201cYou\u2019re speaking too highly of me. My shooting is just slightly more accurate. I don\u2019t deserve such praises. I\u2019m not god-like,\u201d the man replied humbly.\u201cIf you\u2019re not god-like, who is?\u201d A person at the side didn\u2019t believe him.\u201cYou might not believe it, but I\u2019ve seen someone with god-like gun skills before. That person is a real god!\u201d The man was full of exclamations as he recalled some past events.\u201cHow impressive is that?\u201d someone asked curiously.\u201cHave you seen bullets that can change direction in the air?\u201d the man with short hair asked mysteriously.1Wang Teng was attracted by their conversation. At first, he just wanted to pick up attributes, but now, he couldn\u2019t stop himself from listening in on the chatter.Bullets that can change direction?!So incredible?Do you think you\u2019re filming a fantasy movie?Wait, this isn\u2019t a fantasy movie but a martial arts drama!In the martial arts era, anything is possible!The man\u2019s question caused everyone to exchange glances with one another. This bunch of amateurs hadn\u2019t even seen many powerful gun players, much less a god-like player.The man with short hair was immersed in his memory. Then, he sighed and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen a person who can do it. That person is the real god of guns. His shooting skills are god-like, but unfortunately, he\u2019s too arrogant. He fell into other people\u2019s trap and used the skill he was most proud of to kill the woman he loved dearly.\u201dHis words caused everyone to turn flabbergasted. They saw the look of pity on the man\u2019s face. Although they might not have witnessed the scene personally, they felt sad too.\u201cTsk!\u201d Wang Teng clicked his tongue. He didn\u2019t know what kind of expression to give.\u201cWhat happened after that?\u201d someone couldn\u2019t help but ask.The other people looked at the man in anticipation. They were all burning with curiosity, wanting to know the development of this story.\u201cIn the end, he couldn\u2019t bear the stimulation and turned crazy. He\u2019s in the western suburb mental hospital,\u201d the man with short hair said with sorrow.\u201cAh!\u201dNo one had expected this ending. There was a series of agitated sighs.\u201cThe western suburb mental hospital.\u201dWang Teng muttered the name to himself. There was a glimmer in his eyes. No one knew what plans he had up his sleeve.\u2026In the afternoon, after finishing his dinner, Wang Teng went straight to the western suburb mental hospital.The place wasn\u2019t hard to find. He drove to the western suburb under the guidance of his GPS and found his destination easily.Wang Teng parked his car and got down.There was an old building in front of him, mostly black and white. The walls were mottled, and metal railings surrounded the building. The paint on the railings was coming off, revealing the rust underneath. Weeds filled up the corners of the walls. It looked as though no one had cleaned this place for a long time.Wang Teng was slightly surprised by how dilapidated this mental hospital was. It was almost deserted.By right, in the current society, shouldn\u2019t a mental hospital show more emphasis on its environment?Why was this place like a haunted house in a movie!If someone lived here for a long time, they would get mentally ill, even if they weren\u2019t crazy at the start!Wang Teng walked into the mental hospital with his confused thoughts. He didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion, but he felt that it was cold and chilly inside.As a martial warrior, his sense of hearing was sharper than a normal person.He stood at the entrance and could faintly hear someone running in the empty corridor while wearing slippers.Tap, tap, tap\u2026Si!Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but shiver.\u00a0Oh my god.He wondered if he had made the right decision to come to this mental hospital?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She was looking down and playing with her phone.\u201cHello\u2026\u201d Wang Teng remained patient and opened his mouth again.\u201cHello your head!\u201d The nurse suddenly raised her head. Her face was as round as a pie, and her eyes were narrow. She was \u2018glaring\u2019 at Wang Teng.Glaring\u2026Wang Teng: \u2026Suddenly, a thought flashed through his mind. \u201cI think you\u2019ll look amazing if you slim down a bit.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d The nurse\u2019s eyes brightened.\u201cOf course. Everyone who knows me calls me Mr. Humble. You can believe my words,\u201d Wang Teng replied sincerely.\u201cI will definitely slim down and prove to everyone\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s right, prove to everyone!\u201cProve to everyone that I look equally ugly after I slim down. Hahahahaha~\u201d The nurse with a big face suddenly laughed maniacally.Wang Teng: \u2026Are all the staff in this mental hospital this abnormal?Wang Teng looked at the nurse, who was laughing like a lunatic. She laughed until she couldn\u2019t breathe properly. At the same time, the powder on her face kept dropping.\u201cErm, can I see the God of Gun?\u201dHe waited until the nurse slowly came to a halt before asking her carefully.\u201cGod of Guns? Which one are you referring to? We have nine people who claim that they are the God of Gun here!\u201d the nurse said.Wang Teng instantly felt his head hurting.Once again, he suspected whether he had made the right decision to come to this mental hospital or not.\u201cThe one that accidentally killed the woman he loved.\u201d Wang Teng contemplated his words before he spoke.\u201cOh~ You\u2019re talking about that poor, unlucky fellow!\u201d There was no expression on the nurse\u2019s face, but she sounded enlightened.\u201cYes, it\u2019s him. That\u2019s the one!\u201d Wang Teng nodded.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, we forbid anyone from visiting anyone in this hospital.\u201d The nurse with the fat face lowered her head and started playing with her phone again.\u201c??\u201d Wang Teng felt the veins on his forehead bulging up.\u201cForbid anyone from visiting? Why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier?\u201d\u201cOh, I noticed that you had a strong desire to talk, so I forced myself to talk to you for a while~\u201d the nurse replied without raising her head.\u201cI @#%\u00a5#\u00a5\u2026%&amp;amp;*\u2026\u201dF**k, even if I die, I won\u2019t have any desire to talk to you!Wang Teng almost choked to death from his complaints.I have never thought that I, Wang Teng, will fall in the hands of this round-faced lady\u2026Hmph!He snorted angrily and flicked his sleeve as he left.\u2026Wang Teng went back to the marksmanship club and turned his unutterable grief and indignation into motivation. He picked up attributes\u2026Gun Skill*1Gun Skill*2Gun Skill*5\u2026His gun skill, which was at the big achievement stage, was racing towards the perfected stage.Time flew by when you were busy.At night, Wang Teng went home to have dinner. Then, he drove to the house he rented in the university town to pay a visit to his little egg.Well~ it hadn\u2019t hatched.He didn\u2019t go back to the marksmanship club. Instead, he went to Jixin Martial House.He stayed there all the way until 11 pm.Next, Wang Teng went back to the western suburb mental hospital.The western suburb had always been deserted, with few people there. At this time, no trace of humans could be seen. The surroundings were eerily quiet, like a ghost town.Wang Teng felt that this was even more frightening than in the day!In the dark, the mental hospital was like a giant beast lying prone on the ground, waiting for ignorant people to come close. Then, it would devour the person in one bite.Should I go back home? Is it too late to turn around now?He was a little scared, but for the sake of his attributes, Wang Teng took a deep breath and sneaked into the mental hospital. He was resolute and told himself that there was no turning back.There were guards at the entrance, so Wang Teng could only climb the walls.The nurse at the front desk had changed. It wasn\u2019t the lady with a round face anymore. Instead, it was a male nurse now. He was leaning against his chair and watching a drama on the television.\u2014From the noise, it seemed to be some anti-japanese drama.Wang Teng made a sound outside the door. The male nurse instantly lifted his head. \u201cWho is it?\u201dThere was no reply for a long time. The nurse stood up and walked towards the door.Wang Teng could hear his footsteps. The instant he stepped out of the door, he knocked the nurse unconscious with the side of his palm.Then, he dragged the person into a corner and pondered for a moment. He took off the nurse\u2019s coat and wore it.At the end, he put on a mask.Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but give himself a thumbs-up for his wits when he saw his appearance.He lowered his head to evade the cameras and sat down behind the front desk.Wang Teng opened the computer to check the internal records of the mental hospital. He memorized the room number of a few mental patients that seemed like his target.After taking the bunch of keys from the wall, he walked towards the second floor.The corridor was extremely quiet. Wang Teng tried his best to walk softly, but he would still make some slight noises.When the noise entered his ears, he felt a little chilly.The first target, room 203!Wang Teng followed the room numbers and arrived at the entrance of room 203. He glanced through the window. There was a figure lying on the bed, sleeping.He found the keys corresponding to the room and opened the door.A person was lying on the bed and seemed to be in a deep sleep. Beside him, a few attribute bubbles were floating in the air.I didn\u2019t expect there to be attribute bubbles that haven\u2019t disappeared!Wang Teng\u2019s eyes lit up. This was a pleasant and unexpected surprise.These attribute bubbles were probably dropped recently, so they hadn\u2019t vanished yet. He came just in time.He picked them up!Spirit*1Spirit*0.5\u2026He discovered that they were Spirit bubbles, and their points were quite high. Wang Teng was elated.These are all Spirit attributes? Could it be that mental patients will drop the Spirit attribute?Wang Teng felt a little puzzled. If his guess was correct, what kind of weird setting was this?He shook his head and walked over, shaking the person on the bed.\u201d Hey, get up. It\u2019s time for medicine.\u201dThe person muttered in a daze, \u201cI\u2019ve already taken them. Why am I eating again?\u201d\u201cOh, you ate one less medicine just now. When I realized my mistake, I quickly came to give it to you.\u201d Wang Teng spouted nonsense.The person took over the Six Flavor Dihuang Pills from Wang Teng and put them in his mouth. He swallowed them in a single gulp.Wang Teng had especially bought these Six Flavor Dihuang Pills for these poor mental patients to nourish their kidneys.Wang Teng watched him as he swallowed the pills. Then, he asked casually, \u201cI heard that your shooting is very accurate.\u201dThe other party got excited the moment he heard this. \u201cYou actually know about my ability. Let me tell you, my aim is really accurate. I can shoot an airplane down from the sky.\u201dThe moment he talked about shooting airplanes, a morbid excitement could be seen on his face.\u201cReally? Can you show me?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cOf course, watch carefully.\u201d As he spoke, he started to take off his pants\u2026He was actually taking off his pants!Wang Teng: \u2026Just as something disturbing to the eyes was about to happen, Wang Teng hurriedly raised his hand and chopped the person unconscious.Mental patients were indeed frightening!However, at that moment just now, another attribute bubble had dropped from the patient.Spirit*0.5\u2026Maybe he should have let the mental patient continue his demonstration a little longer?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: God Says\u2026Wang Teng hurriedly shook off the image in his mind. That image was so beautiful that he didn\u2019t dare to think about it. He would rather forsake the spirit attribute than see that kind of image.He would grow a sty in his eye!He closed the door and continued to look for the next god-like marksmanship patient.Whether the person earlier is still lying on the ground or not has nothing to do with me~207, 208\u2026The next room was 209. However, when he went past room 208, the lights inside were on.Wang Teng suddenly saw a familiar person\u2014the nurse with a big face!Why was she in the ward?Wang Teng was puzzled. Could it be that\u2026She was actually a patient who sneaked out in the day and pretended to be a nurse at the front desk?He had chatted with a mental patient for such a long time!Wang Teng suddenly felt extremely uncomfortable. The entire mental hospital seemed to be engulfed in an evil aura. It was slowly and silently enshrouding him.How unlucky of me!He cursed silently. Wang Teng didn\u2019t have any desire to investigate this matter further, so he came to room 209 and opened the door. He walked in directly.\u201cPew, pew, pew\u2026\u201d A man was firing in the air in the room.\u201cWho are you? Did my platoon leader ask you to reinforce me?\u201d he asked Wang Teng excitedly the moment he saw him.Wang Teng looked at the ground filled with attribute bubbles and picked them up silently.Spirit*1Spirit*0.8Spirit*1.5\u2026They were all Spirit attributes, without a single Gun Skill attribute anywhere in sight. It looked like this was a fake God of Guns.However, his guess seemed to be right.Mental patients indeed dropped Spirit attributes. The person who thought of this setting must be a genius!Wang Teng took a glance at the ceiling. He was speechless.\u201cHey, why aren\u2019t you replying to me? Could it be that\u2026 you\u2019re a spy?\u201d The man\u2019s face was filled with suspicion when he noticed Wang Teng\u2019s silence. He pretended to raise a gun and aimed it at Wang Teng. It looked as if he would fire and kill Wang Teng if he answered wrongly.That was right, kill him\u2026This drama king!Looking at the man\u2019s expression and the number of Spirit attribute bubbles he had dropped, this person must be incurably sick.There was nothing to reply to a patient who was already hopeless. Wang Teng ended the conversation with a karate chop.\u201cSigh, why is it so hard to find a person?\u201d Wang Teng closed the door and sighed.Let\u2019s continue!He went to the third floor next.The first to the third floor were filled with all kinds of weird patients. Many of them weren\u2019t asleep.Most of the lights in the rooms were lit up. There were different dramas in each room. Wang Teng was caught between laughter and tears, but he also felt a chill in the depths of his heart.So many attribute bubbles!Wang Teng was at a loss of what to do when he saw so many attribute bubbles. Once again, he opened a door casually.He saw a patient squatting on the ground. There were many attribute bubbles scattered around him.\u201cTime to eat medicine! Time to eat medicine!\u201d Wang Teng shouted.\u201cDon\u2019t disturb me.\u201d A faint voice resounded in the room. The person continued squatting in the corner without moving.Wang Teng walked over.He picked up the attributes!Spirit*0.5Spirit*1Spirit*1.2\u2026\u201cWhy are you squatting here?\u201d Wang Teng was extremely curious. He couldn\u2019t help but ask the man.\u201cBecause I\u2019m a pile of cow dung!\u201d The faint voice sounded again.o((\u2299_\u2299))o.\u201cWhy are you a pile of cow dung? Why can\u2019t you be pig dung or sheep dung?\u201d Wang Teng continued.\u201cBecause fresh flowers would only stick on a pile of cow dung (a saying which means a beauty marrying an ugly husband)!\u201d\u201c\u2026That makes sense!\u201dWang Teng picked up the attributes and turned around to leave. He had no common topic with this pile of cow dung.\u00a0Goodbye, I hope to never see you again.Then, he continued looking at the rooms one by one.He finally understood what people meant when they said that there were all sorts of mental patients.The man in front of him was one such example.\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the creator of the world. God says there must be light, so the world has light. God says there must be air in water\u2026\u201d\u201cDid God tell you that you should eat your medicine?\u201d\u2026This was a man who failed at writing online novels. He wanted to become a god. To improve the reading experience of his readers, he decided to immerse himself in the role to write the book. This was a bad move.Then, there was no more story after that.Now, he could be his god in this mental hospital. He wasn\u2019t a popular writer earning millions every year. Marrying wealthy young ladies had nothing to do with him anymore.Next!A patient with fetishism. He was hugging a pillow with an anime beauty on it. He kept rubbing against the pillow while licking it. He was even chatting crazily with the beautiful anime character.Japan owes you an anime beauty.Amen, I hope that the sun will protect you.Next.\u2026My horizons have truly been broadened!Wang Teng lamented to himself. Finally, he arrived outside the door of the last candidate.If this wasn\u2019t the real God of Guns, he was definitely fooled by the short hair man in the morning.Although I discovered a place to collect spirit attributes because of this, I was still fooled. I won\u2019t bear with it!He opened the door!There was a man sitting at the side of the bed in the room. He had long black hair, a good imitation of the instant noodle hairstyle. His beard was untrimmed, and his gaze was melancholy. His expression seemed heavy-hearted.Handsome!This was an extremely handsome and charismatic man.As compared to the other mental patients, this man appeared too normal, so normal that he didn\u2019t seem to belong here.However, Wang Teng raised his vigilance to an all-time high.The more normal a mental patient seemed, the more dangerous he was\u2026 right?\u201cHello,\u201d Wang Teng asked cautiously.\u201cHello.\u201d The man raised his head. His voice was hoarse, but for some reason, one could hear the warmth and gentleness in his tone.He sized up Wang Teng. \u201cYou are not a staff here.\u201d\u201cI came to\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. However, don\u2019t tell me. I might go crazy. I can\u2019t control myself.\u201d He seemed to know what Wang Teng wanted to say. Before Wang Teng could finish speaking, he stopped him.Don\u2019t tell you what? Brother, can you give some hints? If not, how am I supposed to guess?\u00a0Wang Teng was dumbstruck.In the end, he didn\u2019t say anything. But, he already knew that this was the man he was looking for.The thing that couldn\u2019t be mentioned\u2026 If it wasn\u2019t guns, it should be the woman he loved.This is a little hard to settle. If I can\u2019t even say it, what else can I do? This man is no different from a normal person if his illness doesn\u2019t flare up. I can\u2019t trick him.Wang Teng could sense that this man wasn\u2019t an ordinary person. At least when he was facing him, he felt a sense of danger.If he treated this man like how he had treated the other patients, he would probably die a terrible death.\u201cIt looks like you made a futile trip today!\u201d The man smiled and asked, \u201cDo you have a cigarette?\u201dWang Teng was slightly stunned.This change of topic was so sudden that he almost sprained his back.He took out his cigarette pack and passed it to the other party. He then let out a long breath. \u201cSigh, it\u2019s been a little disappointing but not a futile trip.\u201dThe man lit up a cigarette and passed the packet back to Wang Teng.Wang Teng was feeling frustrated, so he lit one up too. The two of them started smoking in the ward.\u201cNot bad. You\u2019ve become a martial warrior at such a young age,\u201d the man suddenly said.Wang Teng was stunned.\u201cHow can you tell?\u201d\u201cFeeling, as well as Force.\u201d\u201cAre you a martial warrior too?\u201dThe man smiled and didn\u2019t say anything. He remained quiet until he finished smoking his cigarette.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that there isn\u2019t any alcohol. I haven\u2019t drunk alcohol in a long time,\u201d said the man finally.\u201cIf you want, I can bring some for you in the future.\u201d Wang Teng got up and prepared to leave.\u201cWait!\u201dWang Teng turned around and saw the man throwing something at him. He caught it in a hurry.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: Gun Kungfu!\u201cUSB!\u201dWang Teng looked at the item in his hand in surprise. At the same time, he had doubts in his heart.\u201cThis is a gift for you. What you want is inside,\u201d the man with curly hair said.\u201cYou\u2019re embarrassing me, to be honest. This is the first time we met, yet you are giving me a gift.\u201dAlthough his mouth refused, Wang Teng\u2019s hands still stuffed the USB into his pants pocket without any hesitation.\u201cYou can take it as payment for the cigarette. Ha~\u201d The man with curly hair yawned and lay down. He waved his hand at Wang Teng. \u201cYou can leave. I want to sleep. Remember to turn off the light for me.\u201dWang Teng threw a last glance at the other party. Then, he put on his mask and turned off the lights. He walked out and left.Once Wang Teng stepped out, the man with curly hair suddenly jumped up from the bed and pasted his face on the door\u2019s glass. He looked for a long time.\u201cDo you think he has left?\u201d he muttered to himself.\u201cHe should have left!\u201dHe confirmed that Wang Teng was already gone.Suddenly, he laughed like crazy. He laughed until he bent forward and backward. He then fell to the ground and started rolling around in laughter. Tears and mucus dripped down his face.\u201cThis is so interesting. This is so interesting. That fellow actually believed me. Hahahaha\u2026 I\u2019m dying from laughter.\u201d\u2026Wang Teng lowered his head and headed down the stairs. Suddenly, a sound was heard behind him.\u201cHey, you, wait for a moment.\u201dWang Teng\u2019s heart dropped. Was there staff on duty at this time? When he came up, he didn\u2019t see anyone!All kinds of ways to tackle the situation appeared in his mind. If he got caught, he could only\u2026Footsteps sounded behind him. That person was getting closer. Wang Teng turned around and saw a thirty years old man walking towards him. He was wearing a long white coat.\u201cAren\u2019t you stationed downstairs? Why did you come up?\u201d He looked at Wang Teng sternly.\u201cOh, I heard a commotion upstairs and thought that something happened. Hence, I came up to take a look,\u201d Wang Teng spouted nonsense without batting an eye.The man\u2019s expression softened a little when he heard this explanation. But, immediately after that, he asked with curiosity, \u201cWhy are you wearing a mask in the middle of the night?\u201d\u201cI have bad breath. If I don\u2019t wear a mask, it will affect other people\u2026\u201dBefore Wang Teng could finish speaking, a loud siren suddenly rang throughout the entire mental hospital.\u201cA patient ran out!\u201dA shout came from downstairs.The man\u2019s expression changed. He pushed Wang Teng away and dashed down. As he ran, he took off the white gown he was wearing and laughed loudly. \u201cCome and catch me. Come and catch me\u2026\u201dWang Teng: \u2026This mental hospital is too scary!I should hurry up and go home!Using the commotion as his cover-up, Wang Teng climbed the wall and left the mental hospital. He drove his car home.It was deep into the night when he reached home.Wang Teng took a bath and went back to his bedroom. He took out the USB and plugged it into his computer. When he opened it, he found a single video in the folder.\u201cDo they use video tutorials to learn martial arts secret scriptures in this era now?\u201d Wang Teng was slightly shocked.He clicked on the video!Instantly, an ambiguous sound came from his speakers. It was enough to make his ears turn red.It was quite loud too!\u201cF**k!\u201d Wang Teng instantly became frantic. He grabbed his mouse and clicked on the screen. Normally, he was able to stop a video with one click, but now, he couldn\u2019t hit the pause button no matter how hard he tried.In his haste, he forcefully shut down his computer.The room finally turned quiet.Wang Teng didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly. His parents\u2019 room was not far away. He was afraid that they would have heard the noise just now.Breathe\u2014That\u2019s good; that\u2019s good. I don\u2019t think I woke them up.\u00a0Wang Teng heaved a huge sigh of relief.I was fooled!Now, he finally had the time to think about this matter properly. He thought of the man with curly hair. He seemed to have been fooled by the man\u2019s appearance\u2026I shouldn\u2019t have trusted him!I must have been blinded by greed. How can I trust a mental patient?!\u00a0Wang Teng gave a bitter smile.But\u2026The video wasn\u2019t that bad. When the scene flashed past his eyes just now, he realized that the female lead was quite pretty. Her figure was good and her skin was fair. Tsk, tsk, tsk!Why don\u2019t I take a look again?Just one look!Wang Teng comforted himself and looked for his earphones. Then, he turned on his computer again and clicked on the video\u2026 Hehehe!Only the computer screen was lit up in the dark room.The entire room was very quiet, and only sinister peals of laughter occasionally sounded. It was a little eerie.Not bad, not bad at all. The storyline is attractive, and the female lead is pretty. However, her voice is really loud. She\u2019s just having a massage. Why does she need to scream so loudly? It gave me a huge fright!Wang Teng finished the video with a critical look.However, just as he was about to turn off his computer and go to sleep, he realized that the progress bar was only at the halfway mark.Wang Teng shifted the mouse away and allowed the video to continue playing.After a few seconds, the scene shifted.Wang Teng\u2019s expression underwent a huge change. In an instant, his sleepiness disappeared, and he stared at the computer screen without blinking his eyes.Half an hour later, the video had finished playing. Wang Teng closed his eyes and pondered for some time. When he reopened his eyes, he gave a dry smile.How tricky! I almost missed the information at the back!I\u2019m so lucky!He felt a little fortunate.Speaking of this, he still had to thank the female lead. The whole reason he watched the video was that the female lead was pretty.If not, he would have thrown the USB away, and the information at the back wouldn\u2019t have the chance to be seen by him.He opened his attributes panel.Enlightenment: 93Spirit: 55Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Beginner stage earth talent (12/300), Spiritual Sight (beginner stage 1.4/10), Demon lotus poison body (15/10000)Force: 64/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)8/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)7/100 Earth (one-star soldier level martial warrior)30/100 Poison (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red Flame Scripture (foundation 20/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 12/100), Earth Loess Skill \u2018Earth Element Shield\u2019 (foundation 15/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (presence enlightenment for fist, sword, blade, footwork), Basic Stick Skill (perfected), Gun Kungfu (foundation 1/10), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 43/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 13/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks), \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 (80 points)Overall Battle Power: 221Blank Attribute: 0In the battle techniques column, his Gun Skill had changed to Gun Kungfu!However, he was still at the foundation stage. Furthermore, the attribute points needed to level up were now displayed behind the skill. Earlier, Gun Skill didn\u2019t have the attribute points displayed behind it, just like the other basic battle techniques.\u2014The system had been looking down on that skill!Thus, based on how the system worked, Gun Kungfu was undoubtedly more advanced than Gun Skill.Wang Teng had never heard of Gun Kungfu in the past, but there was information about it in the second half of the video.The theory of Gun Kungfu came about due to the integration of martial arts and technology.Ever since rune guns were born, the martial warriors on Earth went through many rounds of tests and innovation before creating this Gun Kungfu. It was powerful enough to make people tremble in fear!Tremble in fear!This phrase wasn\u2019t an exaggeration. It had actually happened before.In theory, Gun Kungfu was an amazing ability that incorporated body strength, gun skill, and sword skill into one whole.Many martial warriors specialized in rune guns. At the same time, they also practiced Gun Kungfu. The combination of these two skills was extremely formidable. It could be said to be terrifying!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: UntitledBased on the introduction given by the video, the theory behind Gun Kungfu was a statistical model built and centered around a single person\u2026That was right. Without any mistake, it was a statistical study!If one wanted to learn Gun Kungfu, they needed to master their statistics first. All the poor students had to move aside voluntarily.Moving on with the main topic\u2026The trajectory of the bullets and the position of the enemy were both included In the statistical model.Thus, if the Gun Kungfu was used flexibly, it would be possible to add all the blind spots around the user into the calculation. The user could attack and defend at the same time.It sounded a little complicated. Simply put, martial arts plus gun skills and statistical study to calculate the best firing path!Yep, that was right.Wang Teng placed his hand on his chin and went into deep thought. There was nothing wrong with it. He just felt that Newton might want to rise from his grave~Help! Someone, please press his grave down tightly. Don\u2019t let him get out!This is quite a fantastic skill.However, how am I supposed to increase the attribute for my Gun Kungfu?\u00a0Wang Teng was confused. He contemplated for a moment and felt that he could only find some opportunities in the future to try it out.Since he had received the Gun Kungfu, naturally, he should use it.Gun Kungfu, as the name implied, could only be executed with a gun.Wang Teng did have a rune gun, but he had emptied it on the martial warrior on Mount Bao\u2019an in the past.I should go and buy some bullets. But, from where?\u201cMaster Lu!\u201dWang Teng suddenly remembered this guy. He took out his phone and wanted to contact the other party right away. However, he realized that it was already very late at night, so he gave up.It was indeed very late. Wang Teng yawned uncontrollably. He shook his head, turned off the lights, and went to sleep.Before shutting his eyes, he glanced at his attributes panel.His spirit had reached 55 points! It was an exponential increase.The western suburb mental hospital was a good place. If the patients inside were any friendlier, he wanted to stay there permanently!\u2026The next day.It was Monday, so Wang Teng got up very early.He had hit the bed too late yesterday. When he sat at the table for breakfast, he had dark eye circles around his eyes and kept yawning.Li Xiumei and Wang Shengguo exchanged glances with one another and communicated using their eyes.You do it.Why don\u2019t you say it?Are you going to say it or not? If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll clean the toilet bowl with your toothbrush!Fine, fine, fine, I\u2019ll say it.The eye contact ended with Wang Shengguo as the loser. He put down the spoon in his hand and coughed. \u201cSon!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Wang Teng raised his head and looked at him curiously.\u201cSon, come, eat these two eggs. They\u2019re good for your body.\u201d Li Xiumei passed two eggs to him with a caring look.\u201c\u2026\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t know how he took the eggs over. As he stared at the two eggs in his hand, understanding suddenly dawned on him. He was unable to explain this matter anymore.That stupid man with curly hair!You ruined my reputation in a single night!When I see you again, I\u2019ll bring him some alcohol~I will pee in the alcohol and pour some laxatives inside\u2026 Yes, this is what I will do!Wang Teng left the house as though he was running away from something. He was unable to withstand the gazes of his parents anymore. Wherever he went, he could feel the two pairs of eyes behind his back looking at him with concern.Donghai No. 1 High School.The tense atmosphere in school had reached a peak. In only one week, the university entrance exam would be here. All the students were frantically revising and doing papers.Because of the reformation this year, most of the students taking part in the martial arts exam had burned their boats and were fighting with their backs to the river.\u201cGood morning, class monitor,\u201d Wang Teng sat down on his seat and greeted Lin Chuhan.The other party had arrived very early, just like always.\u201cGood morning,\u201d Lin Chuhan raised her head and replied softly.\u201cI won\u2019t disturb you. Study well.\u201d Ever since Wang Teng learned of Lin Chuhan\u2019s family background, he had started to respect her even more.A little girl like her had endured so much suffering, but she was still able to do the things normal people weren\u2019t able to. She deserved to be respected.Although Lin Chuhan was surprised, she didn\u2019t say anything. She turned her head back and continued revising.Time was really tight. Whenever she was free, she would spare no effort in revising the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers.\u2019 At the same time, she needed to practice too. If not, she wouldn\u2019t be able to pass the actual combat assessment.The \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 was a fixed subject that would be included in the martial arts exam. However, the actual combat assessment was still the most important segment.Since they were practicing martial arts, their skill was naturally the most important!Honestly, Lin Chuhan\u2019s battle prowess wasn\u2019t strong. It was even a little weak.As compared to other intermediate stage martial disciples, she was probably below average.When he pushed Lin Chuhan against the wall in the past, Wang Teng was an advanced stage martial disciple. At that time, he had noticed that her strength was weak, but he didn\u2019t place much emphasis on it. He thought that this was the standard of a normal person.Now, thinking back, one of the reasons he felt this way was because he was too strong. In comparison, Lin Chuhan seemed fragile.The other reason was that he had just started practicing martial arts, so he didn\u2019t know the difference between a normal person and a martial disciple.Hence, he only learned that Lin Chuhan was an intermediate stage martial disciple much later.I wonder if she can pass the martial arts exam successfully?\u00a0Wang Teng glanced at Lin Chuhan worriedly. If she didn\u2019t, it would be a huge blow to her.After all, she wasn\u2019t taking part in the martial arts exam for herself. It was for her father and younger sister.However, Wang Teng knew that he should keep quiet at a time like this.Rather than hurting her confidence, shouldn\u2019t he give her support? There just might be a miracle, right?Wang Teng threw this matter to the side and took out his phone. He sent a message to Master Lu.Wang Teng: Are you there?Master Lu: Yes, dear. I\u2019m here (\u3065 \u03043 \u0304)\u3065\u256d\u2764~Instant reply!Wang Teng: Do you sell bullets in your shop?Master Lu: Yes, we do. What kind of caliber, material, and stats do you need for your bullet?Wang Teng was stunned for two seconds. Why were there so many different options when buying bullets?Thus, he went online and searched for a picture of a gun that looked similar to his. He sent it over.Wang Teng: I need bullets for this gun.Master Lu: Dear, you can use 6.5mm bullets for this gun. What kind of material and attributes do you need?Wang Teng: What kind of material and attributes are there?The other party immediately sent two pictures over. They were a table for the materials and the attributes of the gun, respectively.There were all kinds of materials. Wang Teng had never even heard of many of them, such as Ola alloy, Sapphire alloy, and many others. The ppm, density, and other attributes were listed down beside the names of the materials. They looked really amazing.As for the price, some cost a few thousand while others were tagged at tens of thousands. There were some that cost in six figures!The other attribute list included the familiar attributes, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The effects of runes were included such that the attacking power of the bullets was stronger and more powerful.But, most importantly, it was very expensive!It was extremely expensive!This evil merchant!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: The University Entrance Exam Is ComingEvil merchant!Wang Teng cursed in his heart, but he still bought some rune bullets from the shop.But, he didn\u2019t buy alloy bullets from overseas brands. Instead, he got the bullets from \u2018Zhang Alloy,\u2019 which was created by their own country.We should support local products!Zhang Alloy was ranked 7th in Master Lu\u2019s shop. It wasn\u2019t cheap either.Wang Teng chose ice and fire element rune bullets. They were more powerful than regular alloy bullets.In total, he had spent 300 thousand on these two kinds of bullets. Along with his recent expenses, his fortune was already starting to thin out.He paid the price and initiated the order. Then, he waited for the round-faced fat chicken to deliver his goods to his house.Wang Teng put down his phone and listened to a few lessons. He also picked up \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 attributes.\u2026Time flew. At night, Wang Teng went back home for dinner.The family sat down and chatted occasionally. Unknowingly, they started to talk about the university entrance exam.\u201cThe Ministry of Education had a reform this year and is allowing intermediate stage martial disciples to take part in the martial arts exam. What a pity. You started practicing a little too late.\u201d Wang Shengguo found it unfortunate.Wang Teng had only practiced for less than a month. Wang Shengguo never thought his son would become an intermediate stage martial disciple in this short period.Hence, he didn\u2019t have any hope for the university entrance exam this year.Wang Teng opened his mouth, but he heard his father saying, \u201cHowever, you don\u2019t have to worry. I can help ask your school to allow you to repeat your year. We will still have a chance next year.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Son, your father and I are mentally prepared. You can take the exam again next year. Don\u2019t be stressed,\u201d Li Xiumei agreed with her husband and said.Wang Teng opened his mouth again to speak. In the end, though, he just sighed secretly.Forget it, I will give them a surprise later.He didn\u2019t tell his parents about his ability. After all, it was really hard to explain. It was better to show them results and make them happy.After he finished eating, Wang Teng went out to Jixin Martial House.When he came back at night, the round-faced fat chicken had arrived punctually. Wang Teng received the rune alloy bullets and placed them in his weapon carrier casket along with his rune gun.All that was left was to increase the points of his Gun Kungfu.\u2026During the past few days, Wang Teng had asked someone to investigate Zhao Ganghu\u2019s small team.The result wasn\u2019t very encouraging.The gang was made up of all sorts of people. Most of them had no potential and didn\u2019t have a stable life. They bullied the weak and respected the strong. They would collect protection fees from small companies. It wasn\u2019t something worthy of mentioning.As for Zhao Ganghu, he was already more than thirty years old. He was an advanced stage martial disciple, but his talent was limited.Wang Teng was already a martial warrior. His leveling up speed in the future wouldn\u2019t be slow.He would only get stronger and stronger.Zhao Ganghu would be thrown far behind and wouldn\u2019t be able to catch up with him at all.Thus, in the end, Wang Teng gave up the thought of accepting Zhao Ganghu and his gang.Zhao Ganghu was stunned for a long time when he received his rejection.He didn\u2019t expect Wang Teng to reject the request of an advanced stage martial disciple to be under him.Was it disdain?He\u2019s looking down on me so much!He clenched his fists with an ugly expression.At the side, Zhao Gangbao was secretly elated. That evil person didn\u2019t accept them. As long as he stayed far away from Wang Teng in the future, there was nothing to be afraid of.He was still the second-in-command. Besides his elder brother, all the other subordinates had to listen to him.\u201cBrother, if I have to say, that fellow is blind. He\u2019s not able to see your ability. Why do we have to follow him?\u201d Zhao Gangbao used the opportunity to fan the flames.\u201cDon\u2019t start acting smart.\u201d Zhao Ganghu glared at him.Then, he looked at a subordinate behind him and asked, \u201cHow much money do we have left?\u201d\u201cLess than 8 million,\u201d the subordinate replied.\u201cGo and borrow some more. Make it 10 million. I will give it to him personally,\u201d Zhao Ganghu said.\u201cWhat? Ten million! Brother, are you crazy? He\u2019s not going to bother about us anymore. Why are we still giving him ten million!\u201d Zhao Gangbao jumped up and looked at Zhao Ganghu in disbelief. He wanted to see if his brother had turned crazy from fright.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give anything. I\u2019m not the one who caused trouble. If you meet him again in the future, you can do whatever you want,\u201d Zhao Ganghu sneered and mocked his brother.\u201cErm\u2026\u201dThe moment he thought of Wang Teng, Zhao Gangbao lost his courage. He hesitated and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give him 6 million? That\u2019s a million more than the previous time. He should be satisfied. That way, we won\u2019t have to borrow money from others.\u201d\u201cDo whatever you want. You can solve your own problems. I don\u2019t want to care about it anymore.\u201dZhao Ganghu sighed in his heart. He was filled with disappointment. He shook his head and left the room directly, ignoring his brother.He went to train. He trained even harder than before, as if his life depended on it.\u201cI will make you regret your decision today!\u201dZhao Ganghu promised himself that one day, he must let Wang Teng know that he wasn\u2019t a good-for-nothing.\u2026\u201cYoung Master Wang, there are ten million here. I had to ask many people for help before I managed to borrow all this money. I hope that you can show some mercy and forgive me for what I\u2019ve done.\u201dAt Donghai No. 1 High School entrance, Zhao Gangbao held a bank card in his hand and passed it to Wang Teng respectfully while bending his back and lowering his head.The stubbornness and reluctance he used to have couldn\u2019t be seen now.Heh~ it feels good!\u201cInteresting.\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t expect Zhao Gangbao to know how to behave properly in a situation like this. However, he also knew that this was probably his older brother, Zhao Ganghu\u2019s, idea.Based on Zhao Gangbao\u2019s personality, he might not be so decisive.At first, Wang Teng didn\u2019t plan to take this money. After all, he had already rejected them. There was no point in taking their money.But now that the other party had come to deliver it personally, there was no point in refusing them.Also, his expenses had been really high recently. He didn\u2019t have much savings left. Since they came to deliver the money, it would be a waste if he didn\u2019t take it.\u201cThis matter will end here. Don\u2019t let me see you causing trouble again,\u201d Wang Teng said indifferently as he took the bank card and placed it in his pocket.\u201cI won\u2019t dare do it again. I won\u2019t dare,\u201d Zhao Gangbao gave a forced smile and said.After Wang Teng left, he wiped the cold sweat off his forehead and heaved a long sigh of relief.\u201cMartial warriors are really scary. I wonder if it\u2019s a psychological effect, but his presence is enough to suffocate me. Forget it. I will take it as I\u2019m buying peace and safety.\u201d Zhao Gangbao heaved a breath again as he comforted himself.\u2026After solving the Zhao brothers\u2019 matter, Wang Teng\u2019s life was very peaceful for the next few days.He had almost collected all the attributes for \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers.\u2019 Thus, he didn\u2019t want to go to school and waste his time.He had a lot on his plate every day. Besides cultivating Force, he needed to go to Jixin Martial House to pick up attributes. In the middle of the night, he would visit the mental hospital since Spirit attributes were hard to come by.It took him so much effort to find a place that could give him Spirit attributes. He wouldn\u2019t want to miss it.Besides all these, he would take some time to go to Lin Chuhan\u2019s house to visit the poison baby, Lin Chuxia. Along the way, he would collect the Demon Lotus Poison Body and poison Force attributes she had dropped.Not only was he able to alleviate Lin Chuxia\u2019s suffering, but he was also able to increase his own Demon Lotus Poison Body and poison Force points. It was a win-win situation.Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t able to visit Lin Chuhan\u2019s house too often. He was afraid that Mother Lin would misunderstand his intentions.\u2026What a pity!With so many things to do, Wang Teng\u2019s life was incredibly fulfilling.Attributes panel:Enlightenment: 97Spirit: 91Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Beginner stage earth talent (12/300), Spiritual Sight (beginner stage 1.4/10), Demon lotus poison body (31/10000)Force: 68/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)16/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)15/100 Earth (one-star soldier level martial warrior)46/100 Poison (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red Flame Scripture (foundation 32/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 23/100), Earth Loess Skill \u2018Earth Element Shield\u2019 (foundation 26/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (presence enlightenment for fist, sword, blade, footwork, stick), Gun Kungfu (foundation 1.8/10), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 56/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 28/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks), \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 (full marks)Overall Battle Power: 231Blank Attribute: 0Wang Teng studied his attributes panel. Many of his attributes had increased.Especially the Spirit attribute, it flew to 91 points. Wang Teng felt as if there was a strange force breeding in his brain.Could it be that once the Spirit attribute reached a certain point, there would be a qualitative change? Wang Teng guessed in his heart.He suddenly had a premonition. However, he could only wait for the qualitative change to arrive to know what would happen at that time.He continued looking down. Under Wang Teng\u2019s hard work, all his Force and the proficiency of his scriptures and battle techniques had risen.His ability had increased.One thing to note was that his Basic Stick Skill had reached the presence enlightenment stage.Thus, there was no way to increase any of his basic battle techniques anymore. He didn\u2019t need to waste time collecting the attributes now.Wang Teng also went to the Owl Marksmanship Club and tried picking up Gun Skill attributes to see if it helped his Gun Kungfu attribute.In the end\u2026Gun Kungfu (foundation 1.8/10)It was not difficult to tell how much effect Gun Skill attributes had on Gun Kungfu. After all, it was a part of Gun Kungfu.However, the effect was minimal. Wang Teng had picked up two digits worth of Gun Skill points, but his Gun Kungfu only increased by 0.8.If he wanted to increase his Gun Kungfu points, it would be a long and tedious journey!Friday, after school ended.Their headteacher, Fan Weiming, distributed the examination identity card. First, he distributed the normal university entrance exam identity cards. Then, he gave out the martial arts exam ones.The other students watched their classmates participating in the martial arts exam go forward to get their identity cards. They had jealous expressions on their faces.\u201cOur class monitor is participating in the martial arts exam too!\u201dWhen it was Lin Chuhan\u2019s turn, everyone was shocked.Lin Chuhan was a well-known top student. Her results beat all the other students by a huge gap. She was the top student in Donghai No. 1 High School.But, she was actually going to enter the martial arts exam?!Everyone found this hard to believe and even a bit unacceptable.The last person to receive his identity card was Wang Teng, who came late.\u201cWang Teng is participating in the martial arts exam?\u201d The students who were packing their bags and preparing to go home got a shock again.\u201cHas he learned martial arts before?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of it. Has he been hiding his ability?\u201d\u201cMaybe. He comes from a wealthy family, so he will have an easier time practicing martial arts compared to a normal person,\u201d someone said enviously.\u201cHaha, look at how jealous you are~\u201d someone said with contempt.\u2026After Fan Weiming finished distributing all the examination identity cards, he said to everyone, \u201cTake a good rest tomorrow. Have a routine lifestyle. Don\u2019t sleep too early or too late. Revise appropriately and adjust your mentality. Arrive at your exam locations earlier on the 5th of July. The exam will start at 8 am sharp. Take things easy, and don\u2019t be late!\u201cRemember to bring all your items, especially your examination identity card. Every year, someone forgets to bring theirs. Don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t remind you. If this happens to you, you won\u2019t even be able to cry\u2026\u201dHe kept reminding his students earnestly and patiently.The students laughed and said that he was naggy. However, they didn\u2019t reveal any hint of impatience.Fan Weiming was a responsible and accountable headteacher. Thus, the students treated him with respect.\u201cTake your exams properly, and don\u2019t waste these three years of your life!\u201dFan Weiming said emotionally as he looked at the young and vibrant faces below.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Shock\u2026Three years of hard work for a single chance!Fan Weiming\u2019s words had touched the hearts of many students. Their resolve was even more cemented as they went home with a firm mentality.The university entrance exam was on the 5th of July.After the students left, the entire school was cordoned off.There were many things different about this world as compared to the previous world.For instance, in the previous world, there would be three days of holiday before the university entrance exam. In this world, there was only one off day.But, there was a huge amount of human resources sent out to set up the exam venues. One day was good enough.Donghai No. 1 High School was a top school, so naturally, it was one of the exam venues.The other schools, as well as some famous martial arts academies, were all closed today to prepare for the test.That was right. The martial arts academies were examination venues too. But, they were just used for the martial arts exam.All sorts of devices in the martial arts academies would be used to inspect the physique of the students taking part in the martial arts exam.Wang Teng took his examination identity card and bade farewell to Lin Chuhan. Then, they went back to their homes.\u2026The next day, Saturday, Wang Teng didn\u2019t go anywhere. He rested at home.He had increased all the attributes he needed to increase. One day wouldn\u2019t make a difference.To him, the university entrance exam was just a process. His success was virtually granted, so there was nothing to worry about.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei weren\u2019t like the other parents who were like ants on a hot pan, anxious and worried. Other parents wished that they could take the university entrance exam for their child, but the two of them were extremely calm. They continued doing what they were supposed to do.At night, Wang Shengguo drank some tea and watched the news while Li Xiumei practiced yoga at the side. They were really carefree.Wang Teng came down to get a cup of water. When he saw his parents, he immediately felt speechless.Honestly, can you show some respect to the university entrance exam?What will people think of the university entrance exam if they see you being so carefree?Wang Teng complained in his heart. However, he also knew that they could be so calm because they didn\u2019t have any hope.After the results came out, he wondered what their expressions would be like.It must be quite interesting!\u201cSon, have you prepared all the things you need for your exam tomorrow? Even if you\u2019re just going there for a show, you need to be serious. Don\u2019t get a zero. I\u2019ll be too embarrassed to tell other people about it if they asked me your results,\u201d Li Xiumei stopped for a moment and said.Wang Shengguo took a sip of his tea and closed his eyes to savor it. He then said calmly, \u201cYour mom is right. If you score a zero, I\u2019d rather you don\u2019t go for the exam at all. I can\u2019t afford to embarrass myself like this.\u201d\u2026Wang Teng was speechless. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you have more confidence in me?\u201d\u201cWe want to have more confidence in you too, but you never gave us an opportunity, son!\u201d Wang Shengguo replied.\u201cWait and see how many zeros I score for you.\u201d Wang Teng sniggered.\u201cLittle brat!\u201d Wang Shengguo rolled his eyes at him.At that moment, his phone rang and interrupted their conversation. He took his phone and said to Li Xiumei, \u201cIt\u2019s Elder Brother\u2019s call.\u201d\u201cHello, Brother\u2026\u201d Wang Shengguo took the call and started chatting with Wang Teng\u2019s uncle, Wang Shenghong.Before their conversation ended, Li Xiumei\u2019s phone rang too. She picked it up and said, \u201cHello, Daddy!\u201dA few minutes later, both of them hung up their calls.\u201cSon, they were enquiring about your university entrance exam. Are you stressed?\u201d Wang Shengguo teased his son.\u201cWhy will I be stressed? I\u2019m going there to get a zero, right? If one is not enough, I\u2019ll score two. The ones who will be embarrassed are the two of you anyway,\u201d Wang Teng said nonchalantly.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei\u2019s faces turned black.What was this little brat saying!Just as the three of them started talking, their phones rang again. Wang Teng\u2019s uncles, aunties, cousins\u2026 all of them were expressing their concern for his university entrance exam.Towards the end, Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei\u2019s gazes became more and more dangerous as they looked at Wang Teng.\u201cSon, if you didn\u2019t score a one, two, three, four, or five in this university entrance exam, you can expect a storm from your highness here in the house!\u201d Li Xiumei threatened him.\u201cAs well as your emperor\u2019s violent rage. Are you prepared?\u201d Wang Shengguo glared at Wang Teng.Wang Teng instantly felt a chill rising up to his head.\u201cEmperor, empress, I can\u2019t do it~\u201d\u201cHmph, if you can\u2019t do it, you\u2019re dead\u2026\u201dThe phone rang again.\u2026Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei remained silent for a few seconds. Then, they said simultaneously.\u201cYou can answer it!\u201d\u201cYou can answer it!\u201dThe corners of Wang Teng\u2019s lips twitched. He felt that his parents were almost going crazy because of the tormenting calls.Let\u2019s solve a math question now.What\u2019s the size of the psychological trauma Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei are experiencing at the moment?If you\u2019re right, there\u2019s a reward~Li Xiumei glanced at the caller ID on the phone. She urged her husband, \u201cHurry up. It\u2019s Father!\u201d\u201cHello, Dad!\u201d Wang Shengguo hurriedly picked up the call.\u201cWhy did you answer the call so late?\u201d A loud voice of an old man came from the other end of the call. He sounded a little stern.\u201cOh, I was in the washroom.\u201d Wang Shengguo had the ability to bullshit in front of his father without any hesitation.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m too lazy to talk to you. Is my grandson beside you? Ask him to receive the call,\u201d Grandpa Wang said impatiently.\u201cHere, your grandfather,\u201d Wang Shengguo passed his phone to Wang Teng obediently. He seemed a little jealous.Wang Teng placed the phone beside his ear and greeted, \u201cGrandpa.\u201d\u201cMy dear grandson!\u201dGrandpa Wang\u2019s voice came over immediately. It was still the same person, but he sounded really amiable now.Wang Shengguo\u2019s expression turned even more bitter when he heard the kind tone.Li Xiumei snickered at the side.Wang Teng and Grandpa Wang chatted casually for some time. He mostly asked Wang Teng about his university entrance exam.At the end, Grandpa Wang said, \u201cTake the exam properly. After your exam, I will host a celebration banquet.\u201dWang Teng had always been obedient in front of Grandpa Wang. That was why Grandpa Wang always considered him an obedient and good child. He never suspected that Wang Teng was hopeless in his studies.Wang Teng still remembered that Grandpa Wang had hosted quite a big banquet for him in his past life.In the end, he wasn\u2019t able to hide his results from the prying people, so the banquet turned into a joke in the elite circle. Grandpa Wang almost died from anger.When he thought about this, Wang Teng felt guilty and regretful.Fortunately, in this lifetime, he was a bug in this world.The university entrance exam? Hmph!Wang Teng silently decided that he must give everyone a surprise this time. He would prove himself to those people who had looked down on him in the past.He would show them what surpassing them meant.No one called them again after Grandpa Wang hung up. Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei heaved sighs of relief.At first, they were very calm. Now, though, they had distressed expressions on their faces and felt bitter in their hearts.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d asked Li Xiumei.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we break our son\u2019s leg so that he doesn\u2019t have to take the university entrance exam tomorrow? That way, he won\u2019t have any results.\u201d Wang Shengguo thought up a nasty idea.Li Xiumei\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we give it a try? They say that people who practice martial arts heal faster, so he should be able to recover in a few days. Breaking a leg shouldn\u2019t affect him.\u201d\u2026Are you devils? I am your biological son!\u00a0Wang Teng trembled in fear at the side.Tomorrow, the headlines would be\u2026\u2018Shocking news! A student\u2019s parents broke his leg to prevent him from taking the university entrance exam because he was too poor in his studies. Is this the distortion of human nature or the decline of morality!\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Heading To The Martial Arts ExamWho knew what kind of fear Wang Teng went through the night before the university entrance exam?There was a lesson for everyone in this incident: \u2018Don\u2019t anger your parents. When they get angry, they\u2019re not human.\u2019\u2026The next day, Wang Teng woke up very early. He wanted to sneak out of the house before his parents awoke to prevent them from breaking his leg.Unfortunately, he could never be earlier than his mom!Li Xiumei was wearing an apron as she came out of the kitchen with breakfast in her hands. She was shocked when she saw Wang Teng. \u201cSon, why are there eye bags under your eyes? You didn\u2019t have a good rest yesterday?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Wang Teng expressed his unwillingness to respond.\u201cDid you really think your father and I would break your leg?\u201d Li Xiumei asked in astonishment.\u201cHmph!\u201d\u201cHow can your father and I be so cruel?\u201d Li Xiumei shamelessly ignored the words she had said last night.\u201cHmph!\u201d\u201cHurry up and eat your breakfast, little brat!\u201d Li Xiumei said helplessly.\u2026After finishing breakfast, Wang Shengguo planned to send Wang Teng to the examination venue personally. He didn\u2019t have any hope, but Mr. Wang still viewed the examination with high importance.\u201cSon, did you bring your identification card and your exam identity card?\u201d Before they left, Li Xiumei asked again worriedly.\u201cYes,\u201d Wang Teng replied.\u201cLet me check for you,\u201d Li Xiumei inspected Wang Teng\u2019s identification cards personally before she felt at ease. She then sent the father and son off.\u2026Donghai No. 1 High School.Wang Teng\u2019s standard exam was held at Donghai No. 1 High School.At this moment, there were many small cars parked outside the high school gates. Beyond the blockade line set up by the school, students were gathered in small groups, and discussions could be heard everywhere. The scene seemed exceptionally noisy.A few buses were parked on the other side.Many students gathered below the buses too. They were whispering to one another and seemed more reserved as compared to the others.These students had come from the nearby regions to take part in the university entrance exam.Wang Teng got down from his car and scanned his surroundings. He wanted to see if there was anyone familiar.A voice came from behind him.\u201cYoung Master Wang, over here!\u201d Wang Teng turned his head and saw Yang Jian waving at him while shouting.Lin Chuhan and a few other students from his class were also beside him.\u201cDad, my classmates are calling me. I\u2019ll go over first,\u201d Wang Teng said to Wang Shengguo.\u201cGo ahead. I\u2019ll come and fetch you after your exam.\u201d Wang Shengguo nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. I can go home by myself in the afternoon. You can focus on your work,\u201d replied Wang Teng.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. One day won\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s decided then. I\u2019ll come and fetch you later.\u201d Wang Shengguo drove his car away after he finished speaking.Wang Teng went over and joined Lin Chuhan and his classmates.\u201cHow\u2019s your preparation?\u201d Wang Teng asked Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian casually.\u201cNot bad. The normal exam shouldn\u2019t be a problem for me,\u201d Yang Jian said.\u201cWe are taking the language, math, and English test today. There\u2019s nothing much to worry about. The real headache is the martial arts exam later on,\u201d said Lin Chuhan.The martial arts paper examinations and the actual combat assessment!All the students would take the language, math, and English papers first. Then, the ordinary students would continue with their science papers while those participating in the martial arts exam would start their martial arts papers.This was the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 that they normally studied.Wang Teng nodded. He noticed that Lin Chuhan was alone, so he asked in surprise, \u201cDidn\u2019t Auntie send you to school?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t want her to come,\u201d said Lin Chuhan.Wang Teng didn\u2019t say anything in reply. Lin Chuhan\u2019s family condition was quite special. Her mother was taking care of the entire family, so she was busy as a bee. It was normal that she didn\u2019t come.\u201cWill your language, math, and English papers be alright?\u201d Lin Chuhan changed the topic and asked.Wang Teng had never taken a single lesson properly in the past and his test results were always a single digit. With his score, how was he supposed to pass the exam?But, Lin Chuhan had her doubts when she saw Wang Teng\u2019s confidence. He looked as though getting results wasn\u2019t a difficult thing for him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry.\u201d As expected, Wang Teng acted the same way.\u201cAlright, as long as you\u2019re confident,\u201d said Lin Chuhan.\u201cLittle Jian, are they your classmates?\u201d A middle-aged man beside Yang Jian jumped into the conversation.\u201cYes, Dad, they sit behind me. They are participating in the martial arts exam too,\u201d Yang Jian nodded and replied.\u201cClass monitor, Young Master Wang, this is my father\u2026\u201dYang Jian introduced his father to Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan.\u201cUncle Yang, nice to meet you!\u201d Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan quickly greeted the man.Yang Jian\u2019s father smiled and said, \u201cNice to meet you, too. All of you are taking the martial arts exam, so you might end up going to the same university. You can interact with each other more in the future.\u201d\u201cAlright, Dad, we are going into the exam venue soon. You can go back now,\u201d said Yang Jian.\u201cOkay, okay. I will come and pick you up in the afternoon. Have a good exam.\u201d Yang Jian\u2019s father bade farewell to Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan and drove his car away.The three students stood there and chatted with one another.The other students slowly arrived at the venue. More and more people were standing outside the school gates.\u201cOh no, I forgot to bring my examination identity card!\u201dSuddenly, a wail was heard among the crowd. All the students and their parents shifted their gaze over.It was a slightly plump female student. She was so agitated that she was like an ant on a hot pan. Tears fell down her eyes, and she kept rummaging in her school bag. All the things inside were in a mess.However, the more she panicked, the more anxious she got.Her parents started feeling uneasy too. At the same time, they kept complaining and scolding her.\u201cBefore we left, I reminded you over and over again to check your items to ensure that you\u2019ve prepared everything. Why didn\u2019t you listen to me? What should we do now?\u201dThe student\u2019s mother was a middle-aged lady. At this time, she didn\u2019t know what to do either.\u2026All the students present looked at the female student with pity. The exam was about to start. She wouldn\u2019t be able to make it if she went back to take her identity card now.At the same time, they also started inspecting their possessions. They were afraid that they might have forgotten to bring something and would become a part of this tragedy.Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but inspect his belongings too.The atmosphere would affect a person. The atmosphere at the scene was nervous and fearful, so even though Wang Teng appeared calm and composed, he was also afraid.Fortunately, this kind of thing rarely happened. He wasn\u2019t that unlucky.Speaking of being unlucky, a person not far away from him suddenly sneezed.\u201cDamn it, I accidentally caught a cold yesterday night and got sick today!\u201dThis was quite tragic too. This student got sick during the university entrance exam. It might affect his performance. If he accidentally scored a few points less, he might not be able to enter his desired university.Similar things always happened during the university entrance exam. It wasn\u2019t anything special.All these scenes were the different sides of the university entrance exam.The time was almost here.The blockade line was removed, and the students immediately flooded into the exam venue.Wang Teng split up with Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian. They went to their individual exam venue.He was very familiar with Donghai No. 1 High School. Wang Teng quickly navigated his way around and found the classroom where his exam would be held.He handed over his cell phone and other electronics. Then, he verified his identification card and exam identity card. After that, Wang Teng could finally enter the room.He found his seat and sat down, patiently waiting for the exam to start.After some time, a voice appeared on the school\u2019s broadcasting system. It explained the rules of the exam venue as well as the things to take note of.The students listened to the announcement carefully, afraid of missing a single point.A difference of one point might be enough to rise above an entire classroom of students during the university entrance exam. No mistakes were allowed.When the broadcast ended, the university entrance exam officially started.First up was the language exam.The teacher distributed the papers one by one. Wang Teng smiled when he saw the questions on the paper.The language paper lasted for two and a half hours. Wang Teng only used one and a half hours to finish it. For the remaining one hour, he did nothing.However, he didn\u2019t choose to leave the exam venue. Instead, he waited for the bell to ring before leaving the room with the other students.A crowd of agitated parents was anxiously waiting outside the gates of the high school.The second the students came out and saw their parents, before they could say anything, all the parents asked them directly in the face, \u201cHow was your exam?\u201dSome were happy, while others were sad.After all, this was the university entrance exam. It was the scene of \u2018If you are unhappy, I\u2019m naturally happy!\u2019Wang Shengguo was much calmer as compared to them. He didn\u2019t even ask Wang Teng. He just drove him home.When they returned, Li Xiumei acted in a similar manner. She was so composed that it felt as if she didn\u2019t have a child taking part in the university entrance exam.Wang Teng felt helpless. Weren\u2019t they thinking of breaking his leg yesterday? Why were they acting like nothing had happened now? What could he do when he had such strange parents?The math exam was in the afternoon, and he would be taking his English exam the following day.Wang Teng aced everything without any hiccups.Next, it was the martial arts exam!Wang Teng didn\u2019t need to take part in the exam in the afternoon on the second day. Hence, he went back home early. The martial arts exam was on the third day at another venue.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei were shocked. \u201cYou applied for the martial arts exam?\u201dWang Teng hadn\u2019t told them about this. Thus, when they heard that Wang Teng was going to participate in the martial arts exam, they were caught off guard.\u201cThat\u2019s right. If not, why am I practicing martial arts?\u201d Wang Teng said righteously.\u201cBut you\u2019ve just started learning martial arts and haven\u2019t reached the requirements for an intermediate stage martial disciple. Won\u2019t it be a waste of time if you take the exam now? Also, I\u2019ve heard that the actual combat assessment of the martial arts exam is very dangerous. You will be asking for a beating if you go tomorrow,\u201d Wang Shengguo said with a stern expression.\u201cSon, you mustn\u2019t fool around with your life!\u201d Li Xiumei got nervous when she heard this.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. If I can\u2019t even pass the intermediate stage martial disciple examination tomorrow, I won\u2019t have to take part in the actual combat assessment.\u201d Wang Teng waved his hand.\u201cOh, that\u2019s right.\u201d Wang Shengguo regained his senses. He asked curiously, \u201cIn that case, why did you apply for the exam when you have no hope?\u201d\u201cI want to experience it,\u201d Wang Teng spouted nonsense, just like his father.\u201cOkay, experiencing it beforehand is good. You will know what to do next year,\u201d Wang Shengguo nodded and replied.\u20267th July, the third day of the university entrance exam.In the morning, Wang Teng arrived at Donghai No. 1 High School. The school gates were filled with people as usual.This was the first round of the martial disciple exam, the martial disciple level inspection.This phase wouldn\u2019t be held at the high school. Instead, the various famous martial arts academies would hold the event.At this moment, not far away from the high school entrance, a few buses were parked there. Lin Chuhan and the other students taking part in the martial arts exam were already gathered together.The other ordinary students would occasionally look in that direction and whisper among themselves. There were looks of envy in their eyes.\u201cThey\u2019re the high school students who are taking part in the martial arts exam!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a reform this year, so intermediate stage martial disciples had the chance to apply for the exam too. There are obviously more people compared to last year. Unfortunately, we still don\u2019t have the chance.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dMartial warriors had already become an icon of the upper-class society. Society and times were changing. In the current era, many high-ranking positions could only be held by martial warriors. They were indispensable and important people in society.Normal people didn\u2019t understand the reason behind this, but it didn\u2019t stop them from wanting to climb to the top.Upon becoming a martial warrior, it meant that they had extricated themselves from the average working-class.Who wanted to live in the lower class forever?Wang Teng got out of his car and bid farewell to Wang Shengguo. He was holding his luggage in one hand and carrying a black rectangular item that looked like the case of a cello on his back. He walked towards the buses.If a student passed the martial disciple level inspection, he would head to the military district afterward to continue the rest of the examination.Thus, all the students must bring along a change of clothes and their daily necessities.Wang Shengguo found it a little funny when he saw Wang Teng, who was just going for the experience, bringing along his luggage and looking as though he was all serious about the exam. But, he didn\u2019t say anything. He allowed his son to do whatever he wanted.However, he was a little curious about the long black box that looked like a cello case. What did he put inside?But, since Wang Teng didn\u2019t want to tell him, he couldn\u2019t do anything either!He looked at Wang Teng\u2019s back view as he walked towards the buses. Suddenly, Wang Shengguo realized that his son had become different from the person in the past.His back was straight and firm. He looked like a treasured blade waiting to be pulled out of its sheath!He even had the illusion that his son would cause a tempestuous storm during his trip.Wang Shengguo chuckled and shook his head\u2026On the other side, Wang Teng joined Lin Chuhan and his friends. They stood under the bus and chatted casually.\u201cYoung Master Wang, what\u2019s that behind your back?\u201d Yang Jian sized up the weapon carrier casket on his back curiously.Lin Chuhan looked over too. She scanned the weapon carrier casket with her gaze, but unfortunately, Wang Teng had covered it with a bag. They couldn\u2019t see what was inside.They were itching with curiosity.\u201cSecret weapon!\u201d Wang Teng smiled and replied.\u201cTsk, don\u2019t tell us if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Yang Jian complained.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: A Wolf Among A Pack Of HuskiesWhen the time was up, the blockade line was removed. The students taking part in the normal university entrance exam entered the high school for their exam.Before they left, they glanced longingly at the students going for the martial arts exam. Their expressions were complex.The university entrance exam was a turning point in life.Right at this moment, it felt as though they had reached a crossroads in life.Some people headed to an ordinary path. They might become outstanding in their respective fields, but if they didn\u2019t become a martial warrior, they would just be ordinary people.On the other hand, some people were about to embark on an extraordinary path. Great strength, long lifespan, all these weren\u2019t dreams anymore.Even though the martial arts path wasn\u2019t easy, even though many people collapsed halfway through and died earlier than an ordinary person, even though the peak was hard to climb and most martial warriors remained at the bottom of the mountain, there were still waves and waves of people advancing in this direction\u2026After the ordinary students entered their exam venues, the plaza finally wasn\u2019t so squeezy. However, vehicles from other schools arrived continuously and gathered in front of Donghai No. 1 High School.There weren\u2019t many martial arts examinees. Still, gathering all the examinees from the various schools in this region, there were around 800 of them.The number was high since the requirements for the martial arts exam were lowered this year. Intermediate stage martial disciples could take part now, so it was understandable that the numbers were higher compared to last year.The leaders of the school and the headteachers of the year three classes were all present too.The headteachers were taking attendance for the martial arts examinees.The school leaders, on the other hand, were conversing with the leaders of the other schools as well as a few officials from the Ministry of Education.Fan Weiming finished taking attendance for class eight. Everyone was present.He noticed that there was still time, so he spoke to his students.\u201cSince all of you have decided to apply for the martial arts exam, do your best. Don\u2019t leave any regrets. I hope that you can win glory for the school and gain honor for our class eight one last time.\u201cBut, no matter what, please remember that the safety of your life is still the number one thing!The students were touched by Fan Weiming\u2019s words. Many of them couldn\u2019t control themselves and opened their mouths.\u201cTeacher, don\u2019t worry. Although there are no advanced stage martial disciples in our class, we have many classmates taking part in the exam. We will try our best to become the class that has the most number of passes for the martial arts exam!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. We will win by numbers and beat those classes that have advanced stage martial disciples.\u201d\u2026What the students didn\u2019t know was that they didn\u2019t have an advanced stage martial disciple but a martial warrior in their class!At this moment, Wang Teng\u2019s expression suddenly turned strange.He looked at his classmates talking in front of him and felt that they seemed like a bunch of huskies barking.On the other hand, he was hiding among them like a wolf pretending to know nothing. He felt that he was a little despicable\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Lin Chuhan noticed his weird expression and asked with a puzzled tone.\u201cErm, nothing.\u201d Wang Teng shook his head hurriedly. Lin Chuhan gave him a weirder and even more puzzled gaze as her reply.Fan Weiming felt comforted when he saw his students in high spirits and full of vigor. He couldn\u2019t help but open the water bottle he had brought along with him\u2026And took a gulp of Goji berry tea.\u00a0This feels good!The other headteachers had also finished taking the attendance of their classes.At that moment, the principal walked over and clapped to attract everyone\u2019s attention. \u201cHas everyone finished taking attendance? Are all the students here?\u201dA middle-aged lady took a step forward and said, \u201cOne of our students didn\u2019t come.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the headteacher of class thirteen.\u201d\u201cSomeone from their class didn\u2019t come? Who\u2019s so daring to apply for the exam and not turn up?\u201d The students immediately started discussing among themselves in hushed voices.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The principal frowned and asked.\u201cErm\u2026\u201d The headteacher of class thirteen had a strange expression on her face. She hesitated before replying, \u201cHe trained too hard yesterday night and broke the bone on his arm. His mother called me this morning and told me that he won\u2019t be participating in the martial arts exam this year.\u201d\u201cPfft!\u201dThe students burst out laughing when they heard the excuse.\u201cThis is really amazing. How hard must he have trained to break his arm?\u201d\u201cImpressive, impressive. He\u2019s the role model for our generation. If I was as hardworking as him, I\u2019d have become an advanced stage martial disciple already!\u201d\u201cI feel that same way too! This person is amazing!\u201d\u2026At first, the principal put on a stern face, but now, he almost couldn\u2019t control his expression. He really wanted to cover his face. This was the Donghai No. 1 High School. Yet, there was such a brainless student who did something stupid at such an important moment. He felt so embarrassed!Do you see the unbearable looks on the faces of the officials from the Ministry of Education?Even the leaders from the other schools were laughing secretly. They were laughing at his school!The principal was furious!\u201cIn the future, we must work on the psychological education of our students. What on earth is this?\u201d the principal reprimanded with a black face.\u201cAlright, we don\u2019t have much time left. Since everyone is here, we will make a move.\u201d\u201cI will be the one leading all of you for the martial arts exam this time. My name is Liu Wenshi. You can call me Mr. Liu. Let\u2019s stop wasting time and get into the buses.\u201d An official from the Ministry of Education stepped forward and addressed the students.All the students started boarding the buses. Wang Teng shamelessly sat beside Lin Chuhan, while Yang Jian sat on the seat to his left.Yang Jian turned his head and said, \u201cThat person just now is my uncle who works at the Ministry of Education.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s your uncle.\u201d Wang Teng was surprised.That was such a coincidence. Yang Jian\u2019s uncle was actually in charge of leading the examinees from their region.The male student sitting beside Yang Jian was from class eight too. When he heard that the middle-aged man, whom the principal had to treat with respect, was actually Yang Jian\u2019s uncle, he said excitedly, \u201cYang Jian, your uncle is actually a leader in the Ministry of Education? With you around, he will definitely take care of all of us.\u201dA few other classmates around them agreed with his words.Yang Jian\u2019s face was glowing when he heard them flattering him. He said proudly, \u201cOf course. However, don\u2019t display it too obviously and create trouble for my uncle. This is an unspoken mutual understanding, an unspoken mutual understanding.\u201d\u201cShh~\u201dThe students hurriedly lowered their voices as though they were sharing a common secret.\u2026The bus drove towards the sea.When he saw the familiar road, Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but exclaim at how lucky he was. He was familiar with the exam venue.Jixin Martial House had cleared away all their martial disciples. The entire martial arts academy was quiet.When the examinees arrived, the guards let them in without asking any questions.The bus stopped at the parking lot of the martial arts academy. The students alighted the buses. Many of them had never come to Jixin Martial House before, so they looked at the surroundings curiously.\u201cSo this is Jixin Martial House, one of the top three martial arts academies of China!\u201d\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s extraordinary!\u201d\u201cHeh, those three buildings look strange. They look a little like\u2026 (Refer to chapter 2 for the exact description)\u201dEveryone\u2019s attention was immediately attracted by the buildings. The male students laughed ambiguously while the ladies turned red in embarrassment.\u201cThe principal has a poor sense of humor!\u201d Liu Wenshi came down from his car and saw this scene. He couldn\u2019t help but give a bitter smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: What Are You Looking At?After the buses led by Liu Wenshi arrived at Jixin Martial House, another two groups of buses came in one after another.Approximately one-third of the martial arts examinees from Donghai were gathered here.The examinees alighted the buses and gathered in small groups. They were extremely noisy.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect us to get assigned to Jixin Martial House for our level inspection!\u201d\u201cThere must be many examinees at Leiting Martial House and Bailian Martial House too. These top three martial arts academies place much emphasis on the martial arts exam. Every year, they will fight for the right to become the exam venue so that they can look out for potential examinees to draw over to their side.\u201d\u201cNot only that, but I heard this is a way for the martial arts academies to display their strength.\u201d\u201cThe examinees will be able to witness the ability of the martial arts academies when they take their exams. Thus, when they make their choice in the future, they will naturally lean towards the martial arts academy they took their exam in.\u201d\u2026The students discussed the topic seriously.At this moment, the leaders of the three bus fleets met each other. They were all from the Ministry of Education and knew each other. They just had different missions today.\u201cLine up properly and follow me!\u201dAfter they finished speaking, the examinees quickly queued up in three different lines.Each of the three main groups was then split into eight or nine small teams based on the number of students. Each team was led by a teacher.The three leaders led their groups towards the martial disciple training building.The exam hadn\u2019t started, so no one was allowed to enter the martial disciple training building. They could only wait outside.\u201cThose are the students from Huiying Private High School, right?\u201d\u201cIt should be them. Look at their uniform.\u201d\u201cAlthough it\u2019s a private high school, their school is famous for being strict with their students. I\u2019ve seen it for myself today. They even need to wear school uniforms for their university entrance exam.\u201d\u201cI heard that Huiying is very impressive. They had as many as eight advanced stage martial disciples.\u201d\u201cTsk, what\u2019s so impressive about that? They snatched at least five of them from the other schools using money\u2026\u201dThe conversations between the other students floated into Wang Teng\u2019s ears. He followed their gazes and looked at the group of students on the side.A bunch of examinees wearing blue and white uniforms were standing in a straight line. There seemed to be quite a few of them.The examinees stood there with their chests raised and chins out. All of them were trying their best to display an arrogant expression.The eight students at the front of the line caught most people\u2019s attention, though. Even the other students from Huiying were murmuring about them.Of course, since Donghai No. 1 High School was a top high school, they also became the topic of discussion for the examinees from other schools.\u201cThe examinees from Donghai No. 1 High School don\u2019t seem weaker than those from Huiying High.\u201d\u201cI heard that they have five advanced stage martial disciples, and all of them entered Donghai No. 1 using their results. This is different from Huiying, who bought their students.\u201d\u201cAlso, the number of examinees from Donghai No. 1 High School is around the same as Huiying\u2026\u201dDonghai No. 1 High School and Huiying High School. One was a top public high school, while the other was a strong private high school. It was understandable that people would compare the two.The examinees from Donghai No. 1 High School immediately felt proud.Go ahead and compare. Who\u2019s afraid of you?In an instant, the students from Donghai No. 1 and Huiying couldn\u2019t see eye to eye with one another. As they exchanged gazes, sparks flew everywhere\u2026\u2018What are you looking at?\u2019\u2018Why can\u2019t I look at you?\u2019\u2018How dare you look at me again!\u2019\u2018I will kill you if you continue looking at me\u2026\u2019The students from the other schools became their background. They weren\u2019t very happy and were all holding their anger in their hearts. They would astound the crowd during the inspection.If they were able to surpass Donghai No. 1 and Huiying, that would be even better!Time passed quickly. Soon, the main entrance of the martial disciple training building opened slowly. A few staff stood at the entrance.\u201cThey are from the Office of Inspector General!\u201dSomeone recognized the identity of the staff at the door and exclaimed in surprise.Wang Teng\u2019s expression changed as his gaze landed on the staff. He had long heard of the Office of Inspector General.In the past, when he was researching online, he chanced upon the Office of Inspector General.Just like the City Protection Bureau, the Office of Inspector General was a department ruled by martial warriors. They were in charge of inspections. Any criminal that fell in their hands would suffer terribly even if they didn\u2019t die.Many officials, who were martial warriors, trembled in fear when they met the people from the Office of Inspector General. They were like mice in front of a cat.This powerful department actually appeared at the exam venue of the martial arts exam. Wang Teng was dumbfounded.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that in the early days, there were many cases of cheating. The situation only got better after the Office of Inspector General interfered in the exam,\u201d Yang Jian whispered beside him.Wang Teng nodded in understanding.They followed the group and entered the exam venue. The Office of Inspector General staff verified the identification card and the examination identity card one by one. They also scanned the examinees\u2019 bodies. The entire process was rigorous.When it was Wang Teng\u2019s turn, he successfully passed the scanning without any accidents and entered the exam venue.\u201cI\u2019ll be going in first. See you again after the exam!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian nodded.Wang Teng had come multiple times to this martial disciple training building. He was very familiar with the environment here.However, when he entered the building this time, he realized that the interior had undergone an enormous change.All the different pieces of equipment had been moved. Only the strength inspection devices, speed indicator devices, and physique inspection devices were left.Also, it wasn\u2019t just one or two devices. There were rolls and rolls of them. They filled up the entire training hall.Each group consisted of one strength inspection device, one speed indicator device, and one physique inspection device. There were two staff standing at the side to help with the inspection.There was a number above each set of three devices. The examinees needed to find the corresponding set of devices based on the number on their examination identity card.Wang Teng looked at his examination identity card\u2014Number 8!There was already a long queue in front of the number 8 inspection device. He walked over and queued up behind the crowd.There were many examinees. However, since this was an important event, everyone was conscientious. No one dared to create trouble. Within a short time, they finished forming a queue.The announcement signaling the start of the level inspection sounded on the broadcast system.Every group of staff had a name list in their hands. They started calling out the names of the examinees one by one.\u201cWang Junming!\u201d\u201cQian Zhengxiang!\u201d\u2026The examinees whose name got called went forward and started the inspection.For intermediate stage martial disciples, their strength needed to be between 300-700kg. Their 100-meter sprint must be between five to seven seconds, and their physique had to be between 50 to 80.After the examinee finished his inspection, the staff would announce the result on the spot. The other staff would enter the details into the laptop in his hand.\u201cWang Junming, strength 362, speed 6.8 seconds, physique 56\u2014pass!\u201d\u201cQian Zhengxiang, strength 411, speed 6.2 seconds, physique 61\u2014pass!\u201d\u2026\u201cXXX, strength 298, speed 6.9 seconds, physique 51\u2014fail!\u201dWhen he heard this announcement, the examinee\u2019s face turned pale. He was grief-stricken as if bereaved of his parents. He kept muttering unconsciously, \u201cHow is this possible? How is this possible? I inspected my strength a few days ago. It had exceeded 300kg. Why is it 2kg less now?\u201dThe other examinees looked at him with pity. It was normal to have some fluctuations in one\u2019s strength and speed. It all depended on the person\u2019s performance.It was even more so for people who were hovering at the passing mark. A slight dip in performance would cause them to fail.\u201cNo way, I want to do my inspection again. I didn\u2019t release all my potential. I\u2019m already an intermediate stage martial disciple. I want to do the test again!\u201dThe examinee went a little crazy. He rushed to the inspector and pleaded with him to give him a second chance.\u201cDrag him out,\u201d the inspector said calmly.Every examinee only had one chance for their martial arts exam. Their performance was a test of their mentality too. If they couldn\u2019t perform well, they had no one to blame.Also, the criteria this year were already lowered tremendously. If this examinee couldn\u2019t even hit the requirements, he wouldn\u2019t have any hope of passing the actual combat assessment later on. It would be a waste of time for him to continue.After the inspector finished speaking, a few security guards with stern and cold expressions appeared out of nowhere. They lifted the examinee and dragged him out of the exam venue.\u201cNo, I won\u2019t want to leave. Please give me another chance, please. Give me another chance\u2026\u201dThe examinee was unwilling to accept his fate. He struggled furiously and refused to leave.\u201cIf you continue kicking up a fuss, your martial arts exam right will be removed!\u201d An indifferent voice sounded from the broadcast system.The examinee froze on the spot. He instantly gave up hope and didn\u2019t dare to make any more sounds.The other examinees felt their hearts stopping momentarily. The strictness and inhumane nature of this martial arts exam caused them to tense up. They didn\u2019t dare to slack, treating the inspection even more seriously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: A Potential General-stage TalentThis candidate acted as a warning for the other students. No examinees dared to create trouble anymore.If they couldn\u2019t pass, they accepted the results wholeheartedly. No one yelled or shouted, just walking out of the exam venue dejectedly.The requirements for the exam this time were lowered, so many students had applied with the idea of leaving things to chance. Thus, it was inevitable that there were many weaklings.But, this was also the reason why the inspection requirements were stringent.\u2026In the control room of the martial arts academy.At this time, many people were gathered in the control room. There were staff from the Office of Inspector General and officials from the Ministry of Education\u2026The principal of Jixin Martial House, Fu Tiandao, as well as the president of the martial arts association, Qin Hanxuan, were present too.\u201cPresident Qin, I didn\u2019t expect you to come for the level inspection today,\u201d a slightly plump middle-aged man spoke to Qin Hanxuan.\u201cDirector He, the martial arts talents of Donghai will all be at this martial arts exam. How can I not come?\u201d Qin Hanxuan smiled and replied.\u201cThis level inspection is just a filtering process. The actual combat assessment is the key,\u201d the man called Director He said.\u201cThere are many weak people this year.\u201d Fu Tiandao frowned. He didn\u2019t seem to like this situation.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice. You must have heard about the situation on the other side. We need to try our best to replenish our fresh troops. If not, something bad will happen one day,\u201d Director He said helplessly as he forced a smile on his face.\u201cOld Fu, Director He is right. This is imperative.\u201d Qin Hanxuan agreed.\u201cHmph, even so, what help can these intermediate stage martial disciples give? If you place them in the actual combat assessment, it will only increase the death rate.\u201d Fu Tiandao scoffed.\u201cSigh, how can I not know about this?\u201d Director He sighed. \u201cHowever, we are putting in five times more security for this year\u2019s actual combat assessment. We will try our very best to ensure the safety of our students. We will not neglect this portion.\u201dFu Tiandao\u2019s expression finally softened when he heard this. He didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201cHow many potential talents do you think will appear this year?\u201d Director He changed the topic with a smile.Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan exchanged glances with each other. \u201cWe don\u2019t know about the rest, but we know that there\u2019s a potential general-stage talent!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Director He thought that he had heard wrong.General-stage!If there was really a general-stage talent in this batch of students, it would be a great achievement for him. In the future, he might be able to get financial allocations from the state treasury and a rise in his position!It felt good just thinking about it.\u201cAre you teasing me?\u201d Director He\u2019s hands were trembling as he swallowed a mouth of saliva.The thought was indeed beautiful, but he was afraid that these two bosses in front of him were just teasing him.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, just continue watching.\u201d Qin Hanxuan smiled.\u201cAiya, don\u2019t leave me hanging. Hurry up and tell me.\u201d Director He was on tenterhooks. This would affect his career progress, so it would be odd not to panic.If not, with his many years of experience in the political world, how could he lose his composure and appear so agitated?\u201cThe 8th section!\u201d Fu Tiandao couldn\u2019t bear to see him like this and shook his head.Director He was elated. He quickly looked at the 8th section.Once the scope was narrowed to a single section, it was much easier. The most outstanding person in the group would be the general-stage talent they had mentioned.However, Qin Hanxuan added.\u201cBut, we just have the level inspection today. That brat might not display his full potential.\u201dDirector He\u2019s expression froze at once. He was a little stunned as he asked, \u201cWhy is that so?\u201dHe was puzzled.\u00a0Shouldn\u2019t you try your best in the martial arts exam?You will only get accepted by better universities if your results are better. Why does he need to hide his ability?\u201cThat\u2019s because he will be able to get into a good university even if he didn\u2019t release his full potential,\u201d Qin Hanxuan explained.Director He was dumbfounded. Then, he thought of something. His face was filled with astonishment. \u201cIs he a martial warrior already?!\u201dOnly martial warriors were able to get into a good university without releasing their full potential.That was because the martial arts exam was intended for martial disciples. Thus, one would only need to perform like a top-class martial disciple to earn the top universities\u2019 attention.Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan just smiled and kept quiet. They didn\u2019t reply to Director He.Even so, Director He felt even more certain that he had hit the mark. He was wild with joy.Martial warrior!Martial warrior!There was actually a martial warrior among this batch of examinees!Hahaha\u2026Director He really wanted to laugh three times to show his respect.A 17-year-old martial warrior. This was a student who became a martial warrior before he entered the martial arts course. What did this mean?No wonder Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan both believed that this examinee possessed the potential of becoming a general-stage martial warrior despite having high standards.It was extremely rare to find someone who was able to become a martial warrior at this age.There might be some talented people who became martial warriors soon after they entered the university and enjoyed the resources.But, if they were compared with this young man, it was two entirely different concepts.He remembered that two years ago when a martial warrior examinee appeared during the martial arts exam in Jinlin, even the governor of Jinlin was alerted.The minister of the Ministry of Education of Jinlin had received huge benefits because of this. The governor was proud of the success, and many people were envious of him.No way, I must find this examinee.\u00a0Director He secretly thought to himself.Many influential people would be paying attention to the actual combat assessment later on. If he was able to allow the examinee to amaze the crowd and shine during the actual combat assessment, he would feel proud too. Those bigshots would definitely remember him.The moment he thought of this, Director He stared at the screen displaying the inspection of the 8th section. He didn\u2019t even blink.He was afraid that he would accidentally miss this potential general-stage talent!\u2026The 8th section.\u201cWang Teng!\u201dWhen the inspector called Wang Teng\u2019s name, it was finally his turn to take the test.He stood in front of the strength inspection device and casually released a punch.1000kgBefore this, Wang Teng had already tried a few times and knew how much force he had to use to reach the borderline requirement.Hence, he was able to hit the borderline value of 1000kg with a simple punch.The inspector\u2019s eyes widened in surprise when he saw the screen of the strength inspection device. He looked at Wang Teng in shock.The limiting value of a martial disciple!The examinee in front of him actually reached the limiting value. He took a deep breath and then recorded the number silently.After that, Wang Teng walked to the speed inspection device and started showcasing his speed.Pant\u2026100 meters in three seconds!The inspector didn\u2019t know what to say. Another limiting value. Where did this monster come from? How could he be so powerful?The last step was the physique inspection.Wang Teng entered the physique inspection device. After some time, the results came out.Physique 100!When he saw this result, even Wang Teng was stunned.He was able to control his strength and speed, but he couldn\u2019t control his physique. The device would give whatever value it detected.Before this, he was still worried that his physique would exceed that of a martial disciple by a huge gap, and it would cause unnecessary trouble for him. Now, it seemed that his worry was nonexistent.Oh right, the upper limit of the martial disciple physique inspection device is 100. It\u2019s not able to detect any value above that.\u00a0Wang Teng suddenly remembered this point.While he was thinking about this, the two inspectors at the side exchanged glances with each other when they saw his physique value.Physique 100!A third limiting value!The two of them were used to it now. They were also a little hesitant. They didn\u2019t know if they should announce this result.The examiners conversed using their gazes and then looked at the three devices. Were the devices malfunctioning?That was impossible. Even if one was spoiled, it was impossible for all three to break down.The examinees behind Wang Teng saw that he had already finished his inspection. However, the examiners hadn\u2019t revealed the results even after some time. They started to feel suspicious and whispered among themselves.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201d\u201cIs the machine defective?\u201d\u201cDid he cheat?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be stupid. If he cheated, will they still remain so peaceful? Have you forgotten about the examinee who got dragged out?\u201d\u2026More and more people were starting to notice the situation here. The two inspectors got a little anxious.Fortunately, a voice came from the earpieces they were wearing.\u201cReport the result as it is.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe two inspectors looked at each other. There was astonishment in their gazes. Even the higher authorities had confirmed this result. It looked like there was nothing wrong with this examinee.He was seriously powerful!\u201cWang Teng, strength 1000kg, speed three seconds, physique 100!\u201d\u201c\u2014Pass!\u201dWow!The moment the inspector finished, the entire hall went into an uproar.\u201cAre you kidding!\u201d\u201cHe reached the upper limit for martial disciples for all three inspections, not one less. How is that possible?\u201d\u201cWho is this Wang Teng? I\u2019ve never heard of him before!\u201d\u201cDid he cheat?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. The inspectors didn\u2019t announce the result immediately. They must be confirming it. Since they announced it in the end, it should be accurate!\u201d\u201cAlso, there must be surveillance cameras here. How can he cheat under the eyes of the Office of Inspector General? Do you think they are stupid?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one possibility. This is a hidden boss!\u201d\u2026In an instant, everyone\u2019s gaze congregated on Wang Teng\u2019s body. The sounds of discussions rang around the hall.All the advanced stage martial disciples from the different schools started paying extra attention to Wang Teng.At first, all these advanced stage martial disciples were secretly competing with one another. Now though, an extreme case had appeared and stepped on all of them.This feeling, tsk!It felt as though someone broke their jar of emotions. All kinds of feelings surged into their hearts\u2014sour, bitter, sweet, spicy.Especially the advanced stage martial disciples from Donghai No. 1 High School. All of them stared at Wang Teng, wanting to see which corner or alley this fellow had jumped out from.They had naturally heard of the playful and cocky Young Master Wang before. But, this was the reason why they found it hard to believe the results.Was this really the same person?Li Rongcheng already knew about Wang Teng\u2019s capability, but he also kept his anger and unwillingness bottled in his heart. He wanted to compete with Wang Teng during the university entrance exam to prove to someone that he, Li Rongcheng, was better than this person.In the end, right at the beginning of this competition, he was already a huge distance behind Wang Teng. This was a distance he couldn\u2019t catch up at all.At this moment, Li Rongcheng\u2019s expression was a sight to behold.On the other side, Lin Chuhan\u2019s eyes were wide open as she stared at Wang Teng, who was quite far away, in disbelief. Was this fellow really so strong?Everyone who knew or didn\u2019t know Wang Teng had a flabbergasted expression on their faces. They were in all disbelief and denial. This result was like a nuclear bomb. Everyone was stunned by the explosion.Wang Teng stood on the spot and felt extremely awkward. He glared at the two staff furiously.You are from the Office of Inspector General. Can\u2019t you act calmly? Can\u2019t you be a little more normal?At first, only the people around him should have known his results. Now, the entire hall of people knew it. He felt like a husky surrounded by people looking at him.Do you think it\u2019s easy for me?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: I\u2019ll Walk Towards You On My Knees And Shoot The Ground With My Head!In the control room, Director He couldn\u2019t help but beam with delight. He said to Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan, \u201cThis is the examinee that you are talking about, right?\u201dHowever, Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan just gave him an ambiguous smile. The expression on their faces was expressing a single world\u2014guess!We\u2019re not going to tell you.Sob!Director He felt depressed.\u00a0To hell with guessing.He was so frustrated he wanted to vomit blood. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he couldn\u2019t provoke these two bosses, he really wanted to curse them.Thinking about it, he was someone with real power in Donghai.In Donghai, everyone treated him with respect. Unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t do anything to Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan.Our Director He felt highly frustrated and wronged!But, even though he was frustrated, he was still 90% confident that the person these two bosses were watching was this examinee called Wang Teng.An extreme martial disciple?Hmph, he must be a martial warrior!Extreme martial disciples could be considered prospective martial warriors. However, he keenly observed just now that Wang Teng seemed too relaxed. It felt as though he was just putting on a casual performance.He was able to reach the extreme values in such a relaxed manner. This meant that his ability wasn\u2019t limited to what he displayed.\u2026In the exam venue, the uproar finally started settling down. The rest of the examinees went back to what they were doing and focused on performing during their level inspection.This was a crucial segment of the martial arts exam. Even if Wang Teng\u2019s inspection results gave everyone a considerable stimulation and pressure, they needed to adjust their mentality and continue the exam.Also, while Wang Teng\u2019s result gave the students much stress and pressure, it spurred them to work harder.Especially the advanced stage martial disciple from the various top high schools. They were already reining in their emotions; obviously, they had an excellent mentality. Thus, their performance was good too. Their results were all slightly higher than their typical inspection results.As for people with a slightly weaker mentality, they couldn\u2019t handle the stress and cracked under pressure. But they couldn\u2019t blame anyone.No one would take the blame for them, either.If they couldn\u2019t even cope with this small amount of stress, how were they supposed to continue on the martial arts path? It would just get more difficult in the future.\u2026The exam continued.Suddenly, an inspection result caught many people\u2019s attention.\u201cHe Manrong, strength 834, speed 4.2 seconds, physique 86\u2014pass!\u201dHe Manrong was one of the five advanced stage martial disciples from Donghai No. 1 High School. Many examinees from Donghai No. 1 High School and the other high schools had heard of her before.Everyone\u2019s gaze landed on her figure.Their first impression was that she was pretty and her legs were long.But now, most of their focus was on her results\u2014the standard of an advanced stage martial disciple!Her ability must not be underestimated!The level inspection hadn\u2019t ended, so the examinees weren\u2019t allowed to leave the exam venue. Wang Teng was standing in the waiting area when he heard the lady\u2019s result. He couldn\u2019t help but look towards the girl standing among the crowd.He still remembered that when he had first arrived in this world, the first advanced stage martial disciple he met was He Manrong.Erm\u2026 back then, he had just looked at her from afar, so the other party didn\u2019t know who he was.At that time, Wang Teng was just a normal person. He even felt that He Manrong was very powerful. Now, he was already a martial warrior.If he met He Manrong during the exam, hmm~ he would only use one hand.Time flew by. Batches and batches of examinees went forward to undergo their inspection. At the same time, more and more people got eliminated\u2026At first, Wang Teng wasn\u2019t paying attention to the inspection. They were all martial disciples. They wouldn\u2019t possess any threat to him, so knowing their results wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference.However, an announcement caused him to raise his eyebrows unconsciously. A naughty smile appeared at the corner of his lips.\u201cLi Rongcheng, strength 812, speed 4.8 meters, physique 83\u2014pass!\u201dLi Rongcheng\u2019s results were out!From the data, he had managed to pass the inspection with the standard of an advanced stage martial disciple.However, he knew clearly that the guy hadn\u2019t performed well.The pressure that Wang Teng gave him was too great. There was already a grudge between the two, so the better Wang Teng performed, the more he wanted to overtake him.In the end, not only was he unable to overtake him, he couldn\u2019t even release his full potential.\u201cDamn it!\u201dLi Rongcheng glared in Wang Teng\u2019s direction. Ever since he met this fellow, he had never been lucky.Wang Teng chuckled uncontrollably when he heard this result. He had fought with Li Rongcheng before, so he knew that his true capability was stronger than this.It was obvious that he didn\u2019t perform well this time!\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for that, right?\u201d Wang Teng muttered to himself.Speaking of him, whether in his past life or this lifetime, before the Wang family went downhill, there were no huge grudges between Li Rongcheng and him. They were just rich second generations who didn\u2019t see eye to eye with each other.But, after the Wang family collapsed in his past life, Li Rongcheng didn\u2019t let go of that good opportunity to jeer at him.Not only did he hit him when he was down, he even humiliated him frequently.At that time, Wang Teng was having a hard time. He had to work to support himself. One time, Li Rongcheng bumped into him at work and humiliated him right there. He even framed him for being sticky-fingered and caused him to lose his job\u2026This was how the hatred between them was formed.In this lifetime, Li Rongcheng was quite innocent. He took the blame for something he didn\u2019t do and got beaten up terribly because of it.After that, he kept getting suppressed by Wang Teng wherever he went. This caused him to gnash his teeth with hatred.Every time Wang Teng saw how much Li Rongcheng hated him but was unable to do anything about it, he would recall his past life. This was exactly how he felt back then. This allowed him to understand things at a deeper level.He didn\u2019t care if his past life had any relation to this life. He also didn\u2019t care whether Li Rongcheng had bullied him in this lifetime or not. He just didn\u2019t like Li Rongcheng!Hence, he must be unlucky!I, Wang Teng, am a narrow-minded person!As he recalled his painful past, the inspection slowly drew to a close.Lin Chuhan\u2019s name was closer to the bottom of the name list, but she had ended her inspection too. She managed to pass, even though it was a narrow escape.Her data was quite dangerous.Strength 323, speed 6.8 seconds, physique 55!Wang Teng didn\u2019t know what to say about her results. He never imagined the god-like student, Lin Chuhan, would have a moment like this.Poor, her results were too poor!Hahaha, every dog has its day!Lin Chuhan looked at Wang Teng. He wanted to laugh but didn\u2019t dare to do it. She rolled her eyes uncontrollably. \u201cLaugh if you want to. My martial arts results aren\u2019t as crazy as yours!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not laughing. I\u2019m very serious.\u201d Wang Teng hurriedly denied it.\u00a0Are you kidding? How can I laugh when a lady asks me to laugh? That\u2019s so insensitive.After some time, Yang Jian finished his inspection. He passed too.This fellow had an uncle working in the Ministry of Education, so he had received insider news long before the rest of the students. He had ample time to prepare. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if he didn\u2019t pass.He walked over from afar. When he saw Wang Teng, he rushed over and started shouting, \u201cYoung Master Wang, I\u2019ll walk towards you on my knees and shoot the ground with my head!\u201d\u201c??\u201dWang Teng was dumbstruck.\u201cWhat does he mean?\u201d He turned to look at Lin Chuhan. He wanted to let this star student translate for him.\u201cHe feels like kneeling in front of you,\u201d Lin Chuhan felt speechless as she replied.Yang Jian nodded furiously at the side. \u201cYoung Master Wang, you have my respect. I\u2019m willing to bow down to you. I didn\u2019t know that you\u2019re so impressive! Boss, please accept my knees!\u201d\u201cGo away!\u201d Wang Teng was speechless. This fellow must be crazy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Principal, Do You Have Any Sacred Kungfu To Teach Me?The inspection in the morning lasted until 12 noon.Wang Teng and his friends followed the crowd and left the martial disciple training hall of Jixin Martial House. Many of the students were discussing the results of the inspection just now.\u201cThat Wang Teng from Donghai No. 1, where did he pop out from? He\u2019s so amazing!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s an extreme martial disciple! He\u2019s just one step away from becoming a martial warrior!\u201d\u201cHe must have purposely hidden his true power. He was probably waiting to make his mark during the university entrance exam and attract everyone\u2019s attention. That\u2019s so scheming of him. What a sinister fellow\u2026\u201dAs Wang Teng listened to the conversation, he suddenly felt that it sounded wrong. His face turned black.Do you know how to speak properly?Damn it, how am I a sinister fellow? Don\u2019t leave. Explain what you just said.If Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian hadn\u2019t pulled him back, Wang Teng really wanted to dash forward and pull the examinees into a corner to have a good chat about life.This bunch of little brats hadn\u2019t experienced the brutality of society. They dared to say anything!I, Wang Teng, am an upright and forthright person. How can I be a sinister fellow? What a joke!\u201cAlright, alright, they were just complaining about you. It\u2019s not a huge matter. Why are you so narrow-minded?\u201d Lin Chuhan said while suppressing her laughter.\u201cEasy for you to say. They are not complaining about you.\u201d Wang Teng scoffed.Yang Jian chuckled secretly. He quickly changed the topic and said, \u201cHave you heard the results of the advanced stage martial disciples from Huiying High School just now?\u201d\u201cI heard the announcement of one of them. He was closer to me. His name is Qin Tao, strength 901, speed 3.6 seconds, and physique 90,\u201d Lin Chuhan said with a stern expression.\u201cWow, he\u2019s really strong,\u201d Yang Jian exclaimed in surprise. \u201cI heard one of their results too. Lin Qing, strength 866, speed 4.1 seconds, physique 87.\u201d\u201cIt looks like the martial disciples from Huiying are all quite strong,\u201d Lin Chuhan lamented.\u201cWhat are you afraid of? We have a boss with us. We can definitely beat them. They should be the ones getting worried now.\u201d Yang Jian looked at Wang Teng and smiled.\u201cHow\u2019s the result of the other three advanced stage martial disciples from our school?\u201d Wang Teng ignored Yang Jian\u2019s words and asked.\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I don\u2019t think they were able to take the morning inspection. They probably had to wait until the afternoon.\u201d Lin Chuhan shook her head.\u201cZhou Wu finished his inspection. Strength 915, speed 3.9 seconds, physique 93,\u201d Yang Jian suddenly said.Zhou Wu was one of the five advanced stage martial disciples from Donghai No. 1 High School.\u201cOh, his result is probably the highest, right?\u201d Wang Teng said in surprise.\u201cBrother, how can you say that so shamelessly?\u201d Yang Jian looked at him from the corner of his eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s no point in comparing with me.\u201d Wang Teng pretended to be proud like an old master.\u201cSeriously!\u201d\u201cTsk!\u201dLin Chuhan and Yang Jian expressed their disdain.\u00a0We know you\u2019re powerful, so can you keep your arrogance and self-indulgence to yourself?\u201cOh right, I need to call my mom!\u201d Lin Chuhan suddenly remembered this. She hurriedly took out her phone and called her house.\u201cOh my god, I forgot that I need to tell my parents this piece of good news quickly.\u201d Yang Jian slapped his forehead.The moment they passed the level inspection, they would head to the next exam venue. The examinees would stay there for two to three days.The examinees that didn\u2019t pass would be sent home directly.The ones that passed could only contact their families using their phones to tell them the good news.Wang Teng took out his phone and hesitated for a moment before dialing Li Xiumei\u2019s number.\u201cRing, ring, ring!\u201dAfter a few seconds, the call was picked up.\u201cHey, Son, have you finished your exam? What time are you coming back? I\u2019m cooking now. It\u2019s alright if you didn\u2019t pass. We are mentally prepared. You can come home and prepare to repeat your year obediently\u2026\u201dBefore Wang Teng could open his mouth, Li Xiumei started blabbering nonstop.\u201cMom, I passed the level inspection!\u201d Wang Teng took the chance when Li Xiumei paused between her words and said hurriedly.\u201cYou passed? I knew it. I knew that you won\u2019t be able to pass. Isn\u2019t that very normal\u2014\u201d Li Xiumei suddenly stopped midway. Then, her pitch rose by an octave. \u201cWhat? You passed!\u201d\u201cYes, I accidentally passed,\u201d Wang Teng replied.At this moment, Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian had already finished their calls. When they heard this sentence, they had a new understanding of Wang Teng\u2019s shamelessness.Accidentally!Hmph, where did his face go!Wang Teng spent much effort before he finally managed to convince Li Xiumei that he had really passed the martial disciple level inspection.Li Xiumei was thrilled and worried at the same time. Although passing the inspection was something to be happy about, she had to worry about the actual combat assessment later on.She stopped cooking and wanted to call Wang Shengguo.But, she remembered that he had gone overseas to discuss an important project with a business partner. It was better not to increase his psychological burden at this moment.When Wang Teng went for his martial arts exam, Wang Shengguo left on a business trip. He never expected Wang Teng to pass the inspection.Li Xiumei put down her phone. She was anxious and all alone at home, unable to do anything.She could only silently pray that Wang Teng would return home safe and sound. As for whether he could get into the martial arts course, she didn\u2019t really care.\u2026In the afternoon, the examinees had their lunch in the Jixin Martial House cafeteria.To display the generosity of Jixin Martial House, their lunch was buffet style, and it was free. They allowed the examinees to eat until they were full.Wang Teng, Lin Chuhan, and Yang Jian sat together at a table and ate their lunch.The other martial arts examinees from class eight also gathered around them and greeted Wang Teng as though they were buddies.Before knowing Wang Teng\u2019s ability, all of them had kept their distance from him. Now, when they learned that he had actually reached the stage of an extreme martial disciple, their attitudes changed. They came over to get familiar with him.Even the examinees from other classes walked over to witness our Young Master Wang\u2019s \u2018unmatched demeanor.\u2019 Actually, they just wanted to see how amazing he was.Unfortunately, Young Master Wang put on a cold face throughout the entire time. He seemed even more cold and distant than he was normally.In the past, you gave me the cold shoulder. Today, I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m above your station. Hmph!Also, that person is so ugly. Is that a man or a woman? Oh my god, this person has a body odor. Don\u2019t come close to me\u2014I reject everyone ugly.After lunch, there was an hour of rest.The leaders of Donghai No. 1 High School took this opportunity to walk over together with wide smiles on their faces. \u201cYou must be Wang Teng, right? Indeed, you are a fine-looking man, and you\u2019re extraordinary\u2026\u201d\u201cPrincipal, do you have any sacred kungfu to teach me? Will you ask me to save the world after that?\u201d Wang Teng suddenly asked.The principal: \u2026Lin Chuhan: \u2026Yang Jian: \u2026The students around them: \u2026\u201cHaha, you\u2019re really humorous.\u201d The principal laughed awkwardly.\u201cYou don\u2019t? What a pity!\u201d Wang Teng gave a regretful expression. He looked as though he really wanted to save the world.The principal was speechless. He felt that the professionalism he had accumulated for so many years was about to collapse.Stupid brat, can you be serious? I\u2019m talking about proper business with you. Who\u2019s telling you to save the world?Is that something we need to be concerned about?Wang Teng noticed the bulging veins on the principal\u2019s forehead. He said hurriedly, \u201cPrincipal, what did you want to say just now? Please continue!\u201dThe principal took a deep breath and resumed his amiable and pleasant expression. He said, \u201cI came over to thank you for earning glory for the school. At the same time, I hope that you will continue to work hard in the future segments of the exam and strive to be the top student in the actual combat assessment. We hope that you will win honor for our Donghai No. 1 High School!\u201d\u201cPrincipal, winning honor for the school is what we should do. However, my capability is limited. My results have been a mess in the past, and I\u2019ve always been a hopeless student in the eyes of the teachers. I have the heart, but I lack the ability.\u201d Wang Teng gave a sad face.The principal looked at the student in front of him and realized that he wasn\u2019t like an ordinary high school student. If it was other students, they would have patted their chest and promised to work hard after hearing his compliments.However, Wang Teng wasn\u2019t moved at all. He even dared to act dumb in front of the principal.\u00a0You\u2019re a martial arts examinee. What do your normal results have to do with this?At the very least, even if Wang Teng wasn\u2019t able to pass the papers for the martial arts exam, he just needed to perform better during the actual combat assessment. He was an extreme martial disciple. The top universities would still fight to give him special admission.It looks like this fellow wouldn\u2019t commit himself until he was certain of success.\u201cWang Teng, you don\u2019t know that our school has a reward system for martial arts examinees, right?\u201cIf you\u2019re able to get into the top 50 of the martial arts exam, you will be rewarded with a yellow-rank low-class energy stone. If you get into the top 40, you will get three yellow-rank low-class energy stones. Enter the top 30, and you will get five energy stones. If it\u2019s the top 20, you will get seven. The top 10 will be rewarded with 10 energy stones.\u201cIf you\u2019re the top three of the cohort, you will not only receive energy stones, but you will also have a bottle of spiritual dan.\u201dThe principal looked at Wang Teng and gave him a mysterious smile. He said slowly, \u201cIf you are the first, you will not only get all the rewards I just mentioned but there will be another mystery reward on top that will definitely not disappoint you!\u201dEnergy stone!Spiritual dan!Mystery reward!Wang Teng was immediately hooked. These rewards were getting more and more attractive. Energy stones, spiritual dan\u2026 he didn\u2019t expect Donghai No. 1 to be so rich!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: You\u2019re The Boss, You Can Do What You Want!Wang Teng had done his homework.Energy stones were formed by congregating the Force within the heaven and earth into the minerals. These minerals were buried deep beneath the earth due to the special terrains. After a long period of development, these minerals slowly turned into stones with Force crystals.They were mostly found in the Xingwu Continent.The earth was only invaded by Force 30 years ago. It hadn\u2019t been long enough to form energy stones.As for spiritual dan, they were formed by alchemists who fused all kinds of spiritual herbs and medicines using special methods. These spiritual dans had many different uses.Only martial warriors were able to use these two resources, though. Of course, they also played a vital role for advanced stage martial disciples seeking to breakthrough into martial warriors.To some people, if they weren\u2019t able to absorb enough Force during the process of breaking through to become a martial warrior, all their previous efforts would be wasted.At moments like this, possessing multiple energy stones that contained Force or a piece of spiritual dan was the best guarantee.However, energy stones and spiritual dan were important resources that were only given to the various powerful factions in large quantities.For instance, schools, the military, or top-class martial arts academies. Only martial warriors who belonged to these factions would get to enjoy these resources.As for other smaller factions, the resources they enjoyed were pretty limited. Even in the market, only large brands officially recognized by the government were able to sell these items.After all, if these resources landed in the hands of some conspirators and they groomed a bunch of evil martial warriors, it would be huge trouble.These resources were available in the black market but in minimal quantities. One couldn\u2019t get it even if they had the money.It was undoubtedly extravagant for the principal of Donghai No. 1 High School to give these two items as rewards to his students.As for the mystery reward he mentioned, Wang Teng didn\u2019t know what to say.Was this how these people played?The last time, Zhou Baiyun had acted in a similar manner. Now, even his principal was playing the same game. This was so boring. How old were they?\u201cPrincipal, I think that the reward system is really good. It\u2019s able to stimulate the examinees to do better. I believe that for the university entrance exam this year, our school will definitely achieve good results. You can just prepare the rewards with a calm heart,\u201d Wang Teng said righteously.He didn\u2019t mention a word about himself in his reply.But, the principal\u2019s eyes lit up. He exchanged a glance with Wang Teng and gave a meaningful smile. There was an unspoken mutual understanding.\u201cI can feel at ease now that you\u2019ve given your word.\u201cAlright, I will not disturb your rest anymore. Examinees like you who have completed your inspection can rest in the afternoon. You will head to the next exam venue at night.\u201dThe principal finished speaking and placed his hand behind his back. Then, he left with the other leaders of the school.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard that there are rewards for the martial arts exam before?\u201d Wang Teng asked Lin Chuhan, who was beside him.\u201cThere have always been rewards, but you just didn\u2019t take notice of it. You should be ashamed. In the past, you either skipped classes or didn\u2019t pay attention in class. It will be strange if you know about it.\u201d Lin Chuhan rolled her eyes.\u201cAlright, alright, it\u2019s my fault.\u201d Wang Teng laughed awkwardly.\u201cWhat do you plan to do in the afternoon?\u201d Yang Jian interrupted them at this moment.\u201cThe cafeteria will be having a live broadcast of the level inspection in the afternoon. I\u2019ll pass my time there,\u201d Lin Chuhan suggested.\u201cThis is a good idea. We do have to take note of the level inspection in the afternoon. Who knows? A few black horses might emerge among the remaining examinees.\u201d Yang Jian nodded. He looked at Wang Teng and asked, \u201cYoung Master Wang, what about you? What plans do you have?\u201d\u201cI will find a place to sleep.\u201d Wang Teng yawned.\u201cFine, you\u2019re the boss. You can do whatever you want.\u201d Yang Jian gave in.In the end, Wang Teng didn\u2019t go anywhere. They were still in the middle of their exam, so even though he had completed his assessment, he couldn\u2019t leave.He could only stay in the cafeteria obediently with the rest of the students.One hour of resting time passed quickly.Those that hadn\u2019t taken their level inspection entered the exam venue one after another. A new round of assessment officially kicked off.The students from class eight were all gathered together. They were watching the live broadcast of the inspection. Occasionally, they would give some comments.Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian found the live broadcast very engaging. They soon started discussions with the other classmates.Wang Teng sat at the side and swiped his phone in the midst of his boredom.Actually, most of the examinees were intermediate stage martial disciples. There were comparatively lesser advanced stage martial disciples.Almost half an hour passed before advanced stage martial disciples started appearing.\u201cLook, it\u2019s Yan Peng from Huiying High School. Strength 924, speed 3.6 seconds, physique 93!\u201d Yang Jian suddenly exclaimed.He attracted everyone\u2019s attention with his shout. Instantly, everyone started discussing the guy.\u201cHis results are on par with our school\u2019s Zhou Wu. His strength and speed are even better than Zhou Wu.\u201d\u201cTheir physique is actually the same!\u201d\u201cIf they have a duel, Zhou Wu will be at a disadvantage.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s hard to say. Although Zhou Wu\u2019s strength and speed are weaker, you mustn\u2019t forget that a person\u2019s ability consists of their basic battle techniques too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If Zhou Wu has a better grasp of his basic battle techniques than Yan Peng, it will be tough to say who will win\u2026\u201dEveryone couldn\u2019t help but compare the ability of these two youngsters.When the students from Huiying High School heard the discussions of the students from Donghai No. 1 High School, they revealed a proud expression on their faces.Look, our Huiying has powerful advanced stage martial disciples too. We are as strong as you. Why are you being so arrogant?However, when they saw Wang Teng scrolling through his phone in boredom at the side, they immediately felt depressed. Even when an advanced stage martial disciple like Yan Peng appeared, he didn\u2019t show any hint of concern.The distance between Yan Peng and Wang Teng was still a little wide!With this big boss leading the Donghai No. 1 High School, it would be difficult for Huiying High School to surpass them this year.Infuriating!How did this monster appear in Donghai No. 1 High School?The students from Huiying High School were unhappy, but there was nothing they could do.Their hands were tied, unless a hidden black horse appeared in their school. And this horse had to be as black as Wang Teng.\u2026The level inspection finally came to a close. There were many advanced stage martial disciples toward the end, but none of their abilities exceeded that of Zhou Wu and Yan Peng.Most of these students\u2019 strengths didn\u2019t exceed 900. Their speed was between five to four seconds, and their physique was eighty plus. Only one or two went past the 90-mark. There was still a difference between them and Zhou Wu and Yan Peng.5 pm.The level inspection was all completed.All the examinees were split into two large groups. One group were the failures, who would be sent home immediately. The other group consisted of the people who would be heading to the next exam venue right away.Liu Wenshi stood in front of all the examinees in the plaza of Jixin Martial House. His voice spread throughout the square.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that some of you didn\u2019t manage to pass. However, all of you are still young. You will have another chance next year. As long as the martial arts exam is your ambition and you never give up, I believe that you will pass the martial arts exam and enter a university one day.\u201cOur country is placing more and more importance on martial arts. I\u2019m sure all of you can see this. Thus, don\u2019t give up easily. There are still opportunities for you. I hope that I will see you again next year.\u201dThe unsuccessful students were feeling dejected, and some were even having second thoughts. However, when they heard his words, their thoughts became firm again. If they couldn\u2019t pass this year, they could retake the exam next year or the year after.Martial arts was already the trend of this era. If they couldn\u2019t become martial warriors, they would be lagging. No one wanted to be in the lowest class of society.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Come And Sing, No Need To Feel Shy!The examinees who passed the level inspection were currently sitting in the buses. A long line of buses was formed as they headed towards a certain direction.At the start of the day, there were close to 3000 martial arts examinees. Now, after the level inspection, less than half remained. There were only around 1000 people left.The rejection rate was quite high.The buses drove for approximately an hour before slowing down gradually. During the entire trip, the curtains on the buses were closed, so the examinees didn\u2019t know where they were.\u201cGet down the bus!\u201dAfter the bus stopped, Liu Wenshi\u2019s voice was heard outside.The examinees got down the bus.They soon realized that there was actually a heavily guarded military camp in front of them, with a sentry placed at the entrance. Soldiers stood there with rune rifles in their hands as they scanned the people who came.A solemn atmosphere filled up the air. Instantly, all the examinees became reserved. No one dared to speak loudly.\u201cThe martial arts exam is in a military camp!\u201dHowever, there were still people discussing in hushed voices.\u201cThis is the martial arts exam. It\u2019s much stricter than the normal university entrance exam. Even the exam venue is in the military camp.\u201d\u201cThis is extremely frightening.\u201d\u2026\u201cNo noise is allowed in the military camp. Be quiet.\u201d Liu Wenshi frowned and scolded the examinees.Instantly, the soft discussions that sounded like flies buzzing disappeared entirely.All the examinees looked at him intently.At this moment, a middle-aged man wearing a military uniform walked over.\u201cYou\u2019ve finally arrived.\u201d\u201cSorry to make you wait so long,\u201d said Liu Wenshi politely.\u201cFollow me in. However, you have to park your cars outside.\u201d The man wearing a military uniform didn\u2019t say much. He led the examinees straight into the military camp.The examinees queued up in a long line. Under the lead of Liu Wenshi and the man wearing a military uniform, they walked through the gates. There was a round of checking and scanning before they entered the military camp.The entire military camp seemed exceptionally spacious. It was very quiet, and the atmosphere was solemn. Occasionally, soldiers on duty would walk past them.Three steps a post and five steps a sentry.The straight backs, the stern and resolute faces, and the neat and uniform steps were all exuding the aura soldiers should possess.The examinees finally experienced what was meant by the soldier\u2019s strength of character.\u201cSo handsome!\u201dThe eyes of the ladies lit up when they saw the soldiers, each exuding a unique aura. They almost wanted to rush forward and get their signature.When the man wearing a military uniform in front saw this scene, he burst out laughing. \u201cLadies, if you lay your eyes on any of the soldiers, go ahead and chase them. I guarantee with my conscience that our soldiers are the best and most outstanding men.\u201dThe ladies couldn\u2019t help but feel shy when they heard this.But, who knew what they were thinking deep down?Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but glance at Lin Chuhan. Fortunately, she didn\u2019t get enchanted by the soldiers!The male students were already unhappy when they saw the ladies get infatuated with the soldiers. They got even more furious when they heard the man\u2019s words.You are outstanding, but you are not the most outstanding or the best. There will always be people better than you. If not, where do you place us?These martial arts examinees were naturally all proud and arrogant. How could they admit defeat easily, especially in front of the ladies?\u201cHahaha, you little fellows, if you are not convinced, we can have a competition tonight.\u201d The man wearing a military uniform laughed loudly.The students instantly got excited. They seemed eager to give it a try.\u201cSecond Lieutenant Luo, they still have an exam tomorrow. Please don\u2019t cause trouble for me,\u201d Liu Wenshi said helplessly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? They just have their papers tomorrow. It won\u2019t affect them much,\u201d the man wearing a military uniform replied nonchalantly.\u201cDon\u2019t say this to me. Tell this to your boss. Go and say this to Governor Jiang.\u201d Liu Wenshi rolled his eyes.\u201cBoring!\u201d The man wearing a military uniform pouted.A few moments later, he led everyone in front of a row of wooden houses.\u201cThis is where you will be living. There will be four people in one room. Please find your own roommates.\u201d\u201cI will give you half an hour to tidy up. Half an hour later, we will start dinner on schedule. If anyone misses it, you will have to sleep hungry tonight.\u201cAlso, I have to remind you that you must obey the military rules since you are in the military camp. All the rooms must be neat and tidy. You must place your luggage properly and not throw them everywhere. You have to fold your blankets and your pillows into squares when you\u2019re not sleeping. We will have people checking on you.\u201cIf anyone can\u2019t do this, they will be disqualified from the exam!\u201dAfter the man in a military uniform finished speaking, the students\u2019 expressions changed. They would get disqualified if they didn\u2019t fold their blankets properly?What kind of stupid rule is this!\u201cSecond Lieutenant Luo is right. Since you\u2019ve entered the military camp, you need to obey the military rules. You will be punished if you make a mistake. There will be no exception. Thus, don\u2019t think that you can act fearlessly just because you are talented. I have already reminded you. You can decide what you want to do,\u201d Liu Wenshi nodded and said.\u201cWe have already started counting down. You only have half an hour. Hurry up and move!\u201d Second Lieutenant Luo suddenly shouted.His expression was stern and cold. The amiable feeling a moment ago had vanished into thin air.\u201cGo ahead!\u201dLiu Wenshi instructed the students.The examinees quickly started moving. Half an hour wasn\u2019t too much or too little. Some ladies were extremely slow in tidying up their belongings, so they didn\u2019t dare to waste any more time.The examinees were all in a flurry. The arrogant and proud appearance they put up a while ago were all thrown to the back of their minds now.The man wearing a military uniform smiled and said to Liu Wenshi, \u201cThese fellows lack a beating. Give them to me for a week. I\u2019ll make sure that they become docile and obedient.\u201d\u201cHaha, you\u2019re really not afraid of trouble. Some of them possess the potential to become martial warriors. We don\u2019t know how high they will climb in the future. Aren\u2019t you scared that they will take revenge on you when the time comes?\u201d Liu Wenshi teased him.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve groomed many martial warriors. If there weren\u2019t a hundred, there should be fifty. Why will I be afraid of these little babies?\u201d Second Lieutenant Luo replied in disdain.\u201cFine, fine, fine, you\u2019re impressive.\u201d\u2026Wang Teng and Yang Jian were in the same room. The other two roommates were also from class eight. Everyone knew each other, so it would save much trouble when they lived together.As for Lin Chuhan, she lived with another three female students.She was quite popular in class. Many people looked for her to ask her questions about their studies. Although she was a little quiet and cold, she always helped her classmates whenever they had any problems.Half an hour passed very quickly. Soon, Second Lieutenant Luo\u2019s voice was heard from outside.\u201cCome out and gather!\u201dThe examinees didn\u2019t dare to dawdle around. They quickly ran out.Fortunately, half an hour was enough for them. The ladies didn\u2019t dare to waste any time either and quickly tidied their luggage. Then, they waited to gather.\u201cFrom the front to the back, number off!\u201dThe examinees lined up neatly. When they heard what he said, they immediately started numbering off from the first person.One!Two!Three!\u2026It didn\u2019t take long to complete the attendance. There were a total of 1352 examinees!\u201cVery good, everyone is present. It looks like you remembered what I said.\u201d Second Lieutenant Luo nodded his head in satisfaction. He continued, \u201cNow, follow me to the cafeteria for your dinner!\u201dThe examinees followed Second Lieutenant Luo and arrived at the cafeteria. There were already many soldiers having their meals inside. Only one area was empty. It was obvious that this space was prepared for the examinees.When the soldiers dining there saw this bunch of examinees, they raised their heads and sized them up. However, soon after, they lowered their heads back and continued eating. The entire process was extremely quiet.\u201cHalf an hour. Gather outside when you finish eating.\u201dOnce the order was given, the examinees charged into the cafeteria. They found their seats and sat down to have their dinner.They had only been in the military for a short time, but they had already started executing every order without fail\u2026To hell with executing every order without fail!\u2014They were mainly afraid of getting disqualified from the exam!The examinees had no one to complain to. They had already cursed Second Lieutenant Luo hundreds of times in their hearts. They silently swore that they would never apply for military academies in the future. This was too disgusting!After everyone finished eating, it was already 7.30 pm.The lights in the camp were lit up, and military songs were playing loudly in the field. The solemn military camp appeared a little more lively because of the song.\u201cYoung ladies, young men, are you interested in singing a few songs?\u201d Second Lieutenant Luo smiled and asked.\u201cAre there any beautiful sister soldiers? There\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t sing!\u201dSomeone was exceptionally bold and shouted this sentence. Instantly, there was an uproar among the crowd.\u201cOh\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, are there pretty sister soldiers?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t have a duel, but we can compete in singing!\u201d\u201cGood riddance!\u201d Second Lieutenant Luo laughed in anger. He had never seen such an unbridled bunch of people before. \u201cCome, come, let\u2019s go over and have a competition. If you win, we will let you take a look at our military belle.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t go back on your words!\u201dThe examinees got bolder when they noticed that he didn\u2019t mention getting them disqualified from their martial arts exam. They even dared to challenge Second Lieutenant Luo.Liu Wenshi shook his head when he saw this.This Second Lieutenant Luo wasn\u2019t an easy person to deal with. They still had an exam tomorrow. Would it be alright for them to play so hard at night?But, as he looked at how excited the examinees were, he felt that he should just let them be.\u201cForget it. They can use this chance to relax.\u201d\u201cI wonder how the examinees that went to Bailian Martial House and Leiting Martial House are. What\u2019s the situation in their military camps?\u201d a leader from the Ministry of Education standing beside Liu Wenshi suddenly asked.\u201cThey don\u2019t have an unreliable leader like Second Lieutenant Luo, so they should be fine,\u201d another leader from the Ministry of Education smiled and replied.\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s true.\u201dSecond Lieutenant Luo brought the examinees to the field and shouted at the soldiers who were singing.\u201cBrothers, this bunch of brats heard you singing and felt unconvinced. They want to compete with you. What do you think?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s compete. No one is backing down!\u201d a soldier that looked like the platoon leader walked over and said.\u201cLet\u2019s compete!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s compete!\u201dThe other soldiers got excited too. They didn\u2019t back down and started cheering.\u201cLet\u2019s compete. We\u2019re not afraid of you!\u201dThe competitiveness of the male students was aroused. They wanted to perform well in front of the ladies.Who knew? They might pass the martial arts exam and even return home with a girlfriend!They felt happy just thinking about it.Immediately, singing voices were heard on the field. The sounds of clapping, accompaniments, and cheering merged to become a beautiful symphony. Tonight was a restless night!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: Star Bone!The next day.The exam paper was at 9 am.However, at 7 am, the examinees were woken up by Second Lieutenant Luo\u2019s whistle.Yesterday, they had a really good time.But, in the end, this bunch of examinees couldn\u2019t win against the soldiers. All the soldiers had really loud voices. Their singing skills were not bad, either, and their voices didn\u2019t go hoarse even after two hours of singing.They couldn\u2019t afford to provoke them!Time to leave, time to leave!The male students didn\u2019t manage to see the military belle and had even embarrassed themselves.The examinees woke up with a start when they heard the whistle. They were in a daze. But, when they remembered what Second Lieutenant Luo had said yesterday night, they sprung up immediately.Disqualified from the exam?They were awake!They were entirely awake!Everyone used their fastest speed to tidy themselves up and rushed out of the barracks. They gathered in front of Second Lieutenant Luo.When they looked at Second Lieutenant Luo, everyone had one single expression on their faces\u2014hidden bitterness!But, Second Lieutenant Luo just ignored them. He chatted happily with Liu Wenshi and the other leaders from the Ministry of Education. Occasionally, he would look at this watch. Everyone gritted their teeth in hatred.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s time. Gather and number off.\u201dThe examinees finished numbering off, just like last night. Naturally, no one would fumble the ball at a critical moment like this. Even if they were slower, the student beside them would help.Second Lieutenant Luo brought everyone to the cafeteria for breakfast. Then, he led them to a building. The examinees waited for an entire hour before the exam started.Two hours later, the bell rang. The examinees left the exam venue.The paper exam went smoothly. At least, this was how Wang Teng felt.But, looking at the faces of some examinees, they didn\u2019t seem to have done well. They sighed and moaned the moment they came out.\u201cSigh, I didn\u2019t study some of the exam topics. I\u2019m dead.\u201d\u201cYes. We only had two weeks to prepare. There\u2019s not enough time at all. I do have some impressions of some questions, but I just can\u2019t remember the answer.\u201d\u201cWhat did you choose for the third multiple choice? Is it A?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it B?\u201d\u201cI chose C.\u201d\u201cF**k, I chose D\u2026\u201dWang Teng almost burst out laughing when he heard the students discussing beside him. There were only four choices for a single question. They chose all of them.This was hilarious.\u201cIt looks like you scored quite well.\u201d Wang Teng saw a relaxed smile on Lin Chuhan\u2019s face.\u201cNot bad. It\u2019s not difficult.\u201d Lin Chuhan didn\u2019t deny it. As expected, for a top student like her, exam papers were a piece of cake.\u201cI did say that the paper exam this year wouldn\u2019t be difficult.\u201d Yang Jian ran over and asked for compliments.Before this, he had already told them that the paper wouldn\u2019t be difficult due to the exceptional circumstances this year. Unexpectedly, he was right.\u2026There was nothing to do in the afternoon, so the examinees took a tour around the military camp with Second Lieutenant Luo leading the way. They also looked at the soldiers having their training.Of course, they were not allowed to visit certain confidential areas.While watching the soldiers\u2019 training, Wang Teng picked up some strength and speed attributes.But, he couldn\u2019t get too close, so he couldn\u2019t collect those that were further from him. Also, pure strength and speed attributes didn\u2019t affect him much.To a martial warrior, Force was the foundation.The stronger your Force, the stronger your physique. Your strength and speed would increase along with it.This was the difference between martial warriors and martial disciples.After that, Second Lieutenant Luo brought the examinees to the shooting range to play with guns. He allowed the examinees to have fun.Wang Teng was delighted.He didn\u2019t expect this benefit.Gun Skill*1Gun Skill*1\u2026After a round of collection, Wang Teng\u2019s Gun Kungfu finally changed digits.Gun kungfu, 2/10 (foundation)!It rose from 1.8 to 2 points.\u00a0It\u2019s still better than nothing.\u00a0Wang Teng congratulated and consoled himself at the same time.Unfortunately, even in the military\u2019s shooting range, he didn\u2019t see any Gun Kungfu attributes.\u20269 pm.Wang Teng was just preparing to rest when Liu Wenshi came to look for him.\u201cUncle, why are you here?\u201dYang Jian, who was lying on the bed and about to sleep, sprung up when he saw Liu Wenshi entering the room.\u201cI came to speak to Wang Teng,\u201d said Liu Wenshi.\u201cSpeak to me?\u201d Wang Teng was surprised. He had no interaction with Liu Wenshi. Why was he looking for him?\u201cThat\u2019s right. Wang Teng, can we go outside to speak?\u201d Liu Wenshi nodded.\u2026The two of them walked out of the barracks and found a secluded corner.\u201cUncle Liu, why are you looking for me?\u201d Wang Teng asked.Liu Wenshi was delighted when he heard the way Wang Teng addressed him. This young man had tremendous potential, but he still respected him greatly. He smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m not the one looking for you. Someone wants to meet you.\u201d\u201cSomeone wants to see me? Who is it?\u201d Wang Teng felt even more puzzled.Liu Wenshi tilted his body. A slightly plump middle-aged man walked out from behind the barracks.\u201cIt\u2019s me. Student Wang Teng, it\u2019s not so easy to see you,\u201d the middle-aged man smiled and said.\u201cThis is our Director He,\u201d Liu Wenshi introduced in a respectful tone.\u201cDirector He.\u201d Wang Teng was shocked. He thought of Liu Wenshi\u2019s identity. This Director He must be the highest-ranking official in the Ministry of Education.\u201cMay I know why you are looking for me?\u201d asked Wang Teng.Director He noticed that Wang Teng had already guessed his identity, so he smiled and replied, \u201cWang Teng, you must have already become a martial warrior.\u201dWang Teng was dumbfounded.Have I exposed myself?How did he notice it?That\u2019s impossible. I\u2019ve never revealed any loopholes. Is he trying to fool me?At first, Liu Wenshi was extremely curious. Director He had painstakingly pulled some strings to enter the military camp in the middle of the night just to see Wang Teng. He couldn\u2019t understand why he did this.Although Wang Teng had displayed the abilities of an extreme martial disciple, this was a little overboard!Now, he finally understood Director He\u2019s motive!Wang Teng was actually a martial warrior?!Liu Wenshi started to doubt his hearing. However, Director He wasn\u2019t shooting at random. He was highly likely to have evidence.\u201cDirector He, you must be kidding. I\u2019m just an extreme martial disciple. How can I be a martial warrior?\u201d There was no change in the expression on Wang Teng\u2019s face as he smiled and replied.\u201cIt\u2019s alright if you don\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d Director He smiled nonchalantly. He continued, \u201cBut, I hope that you can become the first in the actual combat assessment tomorrow. I hope that you can perform better and let everyone notice you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. The university entrance exam is very important to me. I will definitely do my best.\u201d Wang Teng was blowing smoke.Try my best.But how can you what\u2019s my best, haha!Director He didn\u2019t say anything. He just took a box out of his pocket. One could tell that he was a little unwilling from his expression, but he still opened it in front of Wang Teng.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dThere was a bone the size of a palm inside the box. It was entirely blackish green and was glittering and translucent, giving off a metallic luster.It looked extremely beautiful.\u201cStar bone!\u201d Liu Wenshi exclaimed.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s a star bone!\u201d Director He nodded. The flesh on his face was trembling slightly\u2014heartpain.jpg!\u201cWhat do you think? If you show the power of a martial warrior during the actual combat assessment, this star bone will be yours!\u201dDirector He said to Wang Teng.Wang Teng took a deep breath. He had heard of the star bone before. It was the part of a star beast\u2019s body that contained the most essence. The chances of it appearing was extremely low.Only those exceptionally talented and powerful star beasts living in special environments would give birth to star bones in their bodies.Also, every star beast would only give birth to one star bone normally.These star bones were not huge. They were only the size of a palm, and some were even as small as a crystal bead.The most important thing was, every single star bone contained special abilities!There were many uses of star bones. They could be used to create weapons. In this case, their additional abilities would be attached to the weapons. These weapons were treasures hard to come by.Thus, one could see how rare and precious star bones were.Why was Director He willing to take it out?\u201cWhy?\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t lose his mind. He stared directly at Director He and asked him.\u201cFor promotion!\u201d Director He smiled slightly. He didn\u2019t hide his intention and said straightforwardly, \u201cI have been in this position for many years. If I don\u2019t find any opportunity, I\u2019ll probably stay in this position until I retire. However, heaven treats me quite well. You are my opportunity.\u201cI have been in the political world for many years and am not young anymore. I\u2019ve already lost the determination to progress further in the martial arts path. If this star bone contained defense abilities, I might have used it for myself. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t. Hence, I plan to use it as a reward to draw people over to my side.\u201cI\u2019ve never found someone worthy of this reward, so it\u2019s still with me. But, you\u2019re different. You\u2019re young and have great potential. You can also help me progress further in my career. The star bone is precious, but in my heart, there are things more important than it.\u201dDirector He was very direct. He even blatantly exposed his ambition.Wang Teng stared at him for a long time, but he didn\u2019t sense anything worth suspecting. That fat face even seemed extremely sincere.This is strange!However, Wang Teng knew that people like them were all sly old foxes. He was still a little hesitant.The star bone was good, but if he exposed his martial warrior ability during such an important occasion, he didn\u2019t know what big trouble it might cause.\u201cI know what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d Director He seemed to be able to read his thoughts. He continued calmly, \u201cLet me advise you as an experienced hand.\u201cA martial warrior must fight!\u201cA martial warrior is different from a martial disciple. The competition between martial warriors is much more intense than the martial disciples. If one martial warrior wants to climb to the peak, he needs to consume an endless amount of resources, more than you can imagine. There will only be more and more martial warriors, but the resources are limited.\u201cWhere do these resources come from?\u201cNaturally, they are earned and snatched from other people!\u201cEven if you don\u2019t fight with others, others will fight with you. It\u2019s alright if you\u2019re ordinary. However, you are outstanding enough and have amazing potential. You will only have even more competitors and stronger opponents. Many geniuses will be fighting with you for resources.\u201cHence, even if you choose to remain low-profile and hide your abilities now, not long after, your true capabilities will still be exposed. Others will force you to display your true power, unless you\u2019re willing to be a coward and give up the resources in your hands without fighting.\u201cYou will not be able to hide it forever.\u201dDirector He\u2019s words enlightened Wang Teng\u2019s ignorance and left him reeling in shock.A martial warrior must fight!Wang Teng remembered the two martial warriors who had fought each other to death over an egg. He also remembered the other martial warrior who came to find him to snatch his companion\u2019s items from him. In the end, he also died.They were all fighting. They were all forcing him to act!Director He\u2019s words seemed to make sense. However, he still felt that something was weird.\u201cWang Teng, you disappoint me. You have great potential, but if you don\u2019t have the right mentality to complement it, you might not be able to walk far in the future.\u201d Director He sighed and revealed a disappointed and regretful expression.\u201cForget it. I won\u2019t make it difficult for you. Pretend that I didn\u2019t come today.\u201dHe turned and left. It seemed as though he didn\u2019t plan to speak to Wang Teng anymore.Wang Teng looked at him as he walked further and further away. He just continued staring at his back.\u201cCough, Wang Teng, why don\u2019t you reconsider?\u201dWhen Wang Teng refused to call him back, Director He cursed in his heart. He had no choice but to turn around and ask in a flattering tone.\u201cHmph, pinhead.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I agree that what you say makes sense. However, there\u2019s a difference between exposing my true abilities earlier and later.\u201cAlso, the situation doesn\u2019t permit me to do so. All the different factions are present during the university entrance exam. If I reveal my martial warrior identity at a time like this, too many people will know about it. I\u2019ll definitely land myself in endless trouble,\u201d Wang Teng continued.Director He was disappointed. This fellow was difficult to satisfy. He couldn\u2019t convince him at all.Never mind. It looked like he had no affinity with a promotion!Although he could announce this piece of news without his consent, it would definitely cause resentment in Wang Teng\u2019s heart.At that time, if Wang Teng turned against him, things would get ugly. He would not only lose his promotion, but he would also leave a bad impression in the hearts of the higher authorities. The loss outweighed the gain.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d At this moment, Wang Teng\u2019s attitude took a turn. \u201cI accept this deal.\u201dDirector He\u2019s eyes turned wide open. He almost choked on his own saliva.\u00a0Little brat, were you playing with me just now?You\u2019re really bold!He squinted and glared at Wang Teng.\u201cHaha, don\u2019t mind me. Let\u2019s continue with the deal just now.\u201d Wang Teng got a fright and laughed awkwardly.\u201cHmph!\u201d Director He took a deep breath and snorted. Then, he said, \u201cI mean what I say. As long as you display the strength of a martial warrior and perform glamorously during the actual combat assessment, this star bone will be yours.\u201d\u201cNo problem. Deal.\u201d Wang Teng stretched out his hand and wanted to take the star bone away from Director He.However, the latter pulled his hand back and kept the star bone again.\u201cYou want to take the reward before the result is out? You must be dreaming.\u201d Director He pouted.\u201cIf you don\u2019t give it to me now, how will I know whether you will keep your word or not?\u201d Wang Teng asked.\u201cI\u2019m not someone who will eat my words,\u201d Director He glared at him and replied.\u201cWho knows?\u201d Wang Teng scorned.Director He felt frustrated, but he couldn\u2019t vent it anywhere. He took another deep breath and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sign an agreement then?\u201dWang Teng was naturally happy to do it.The two signed an agreement and wrote their names on the paper. Then, they left, each having their own thoughts.Liu Wenshi couldn\u2019t say anything throughout the entire process. In his heart, he was lamenting how outstanding the youngsters were nowadays. He was not only able to bargain with Director He, but he even made Director He suffer a little loss. Not everyone was able to do that.Also, Wang Teng was actually a martial warrior!When he went back, he must ask Yang Jian to hug this buddha\u2019s leg tightly.\u2026Wang Teng returned to the barracks. Yang Jian couldn\u2019t control his curiosity and asked, \u201cYoung Master Wang, why did my uncle look for you?\u201d\u201cWhat else can it be? He wants me to perform well and win glory for them,\u201d Wang Teng said casually.\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cAlright, hurry up and sleep. We still have to wake up early tomorrow.\u201dTomorrow was the actual combat assessment. Many examinees didn\u2019t sleep well that night, as they were extremely agitated and worried. The death index seemed to be hanging above everyone\u2019s head like the sword of Damocles.A silent night.The next day, in the early morning, the examinees woke up in the wee hours and finished their breakfast. They gathered in an empty field.A huge unidentified flying object stopped in front of everyone.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s huge!\u201d\u201cIt looks like an airship.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean it looks like an airship? It is an airship. But\u2026 look, there are runes on it.\u201d\u2026The examinees started discussing among themselves. Liu Wenshi scolded them, \u201cAlright, keep quiet.\u201dSecond Lieutenant Luo placed his hand behind his back as he stood in front of the crowd. He waited for them to quieten down before speaking.\u201cNot bad, we have only interacted for a short time, but I\u2019m very happy to know all of you. I hope that all of you will be able to pass your actual combat assessment and hope that everyone\u2026 will come back alive!\u201d1After he finished, he saluted at the crowd.The examinees couldn\u2019t help but straightened their backs\u2014And salute back!\u201cLet\u2019s end it here. Everyone, board the airship. We will be leaving immediately and heading to the venue of the actual combat assessment,\u201d Second Lieutenant Luo continued.He turned and walked up the airship first.The student also lined up and followed after him.When they entered the airship, the examinees looked around curiously. This was their first time in this kind of vehicle, so everyone found it exciting.\u201cTsk tsk, this should be a Force floating airship.\u201d Yang Jian gasped in admiration.\u201cForce floating airship?\u201d Wang Teng was puzzled. He had never heard of this before.\u201cIt\u2019s a huge airship with runes drawn in its carrier to activate Force as its driving force,\u201d Yang Jian explained.\u201cIs this different from the Force cars and Force airplanes?\u201d Wang Teng felt even more confused.\u201cThey\u2019re different. I heard that the Force airship manufacturing technology is from the Xingwu Continent. The internal structure of this airship is vastly different from the current technology we have. I\u2019m not very sure about the details,\u201d Yang Jian replied.\u201cYou spoke for so long, but you\u2019re just a dabbler!\u201d Wang Teng was speechless.\u201cSpeaking of this, are there technology products in Xingwu Continent?\u201d Lin Chuhan joined their conversation.\u201cWho knows? Sometimes, pictures from Xingwu Continent will circulate around, but there\u2019s nothing important. There seem to be restrictions in place. Ordinary people like us won\u2019t know what the other world looks like. However, once we become martial warriors, we will have the opportunity to go to Xingwu Continent.\u201d Yang Jian seemed to be looking forward to it.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you know about this?\u201d Wang Teng looked at Lin Chuhan in surprise.Lin Chuhan\u2019s father was a martial warrior. She should have some understanding of the other continent.Lin Chuhan understood Wang Teng\u2019s meaning. She replied, \u201cHe never told us anything. Also, at that time, I was very young. After that incident, he wouldn\u2019t mention it anymore.\u201dWang Teng nodded.\u2026Yang Jian was confused.\u00a0Fine, what secret do the two of you have? Why didn\u2019t you tell me?1\u2026The floating airship rose into the air. If one looked out from the window, they could see the white clouds floating around the airship. The buildings below were as small as ants now.Despite carrying more than a thousand examinees, the airship was very stable. There was no turbulence at all.Around half an hour later, the airship trembled a little and started to descend.\u201cWe have arrived!\u201dThe examinees hurriedly looked outside. There was actually an island below them. They were in the middle of the sea!\u201cThe venue for the actual combat assessment is on an island!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s unimaginable. No wonder I\u2019ve never heard of the location for the actual combat assessment in the past.\u201d\u201cLook, two other airships are descending over there!\u201dA sudden voice attracted everyone\u2019s attention.Indeed, in the direction the examinee was pointing, two airships were flying over from different directions. They were landing on the island too.\u201cThey must be the students from the other regions in Donghai!\u201d Someone guessed.\u2026The airship landed on the island slowly.The island was quite big, and a wide expanse of land was cleared out for the airships\u2019 landing. There was a huge camping ground in front.The examinees got off the airship and sized up their surroundings.The camp ahead took up a large area. The borders were filled with a large number of heavy rune machine guns, an intimidating sight for the youngsters. Their muzzles were facing the forest on the island and the coastline.The primary island was surrounded by rune metal fencing, and sentries manned all the entrances.At the same time, the other two airships had landed too.A huge number of examinees surged out. Within a few seconds, the empty area in front of the camping ground was filled with people.\u201cLook inside the forest.\u201dThe moment the shout was heard, the roar of a beast echoed in the forest.\u201cRoar\u2014\u201dIn the primary forest, a giant beast roared and charged towards the metal fence. The large number of preys outside had obviously aroused its appetite.Boom!Unfortunately, before it could get close, a loud explosion shook the area.The guards had aimed the cannons at the giant beast and shot it down. The menacing beast was reduced to small pieces of meat.1A piece of flesh landed in front of an examinee with a splat. The poor guy was so frightened his face turned pale.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that there are many mutated beasts in the wild. I finally got to see one today.\u201d\u201cHowever, these should be ordinary mutated beasts that haven\u2019t absorbed Force. Their skins are thicker and they are bulkier, but they aren\u2019t Force star beasts.\u201d\u201cBut, these mutated beasts are scary too. Are we going to face them during our actual combat assessment?\u201dSomeone spoke in fear. The scene just now frightened many people.\u2026\u201cEveryone!\u201cWelcome to the third exam venue for the Donghai region. This time, your actual combat assessment will be held here.\u201cWe have prepared the protective battle uniform and weapons for you. When your name is called later, you can come forward to collect your equipment.\u201cOf course, some people are more comfortable with using their own weapons and have brought them along. You can use your weapons if you pass the inspection and your weapons meet the requirements.\u201cYou have two hours now. Hurry up and get your equipment. Then, you can start your exam!\u201dA man stood on the platform in the camping ground. His voice wasn\u2019t loud, but it entered everyone\u2019s ears clearly.\u201cChen Xiaoming.\u201d\u201cLin Dawei.\u201d\u201cZheng Dong.\u201d\u2026Below the platform, rows and rows of huge cases were lined up. More than ten staff were distributing the weapons at the side. The students whose names got called went forward quickly to collect their items.There was an area beside it for inspecting the examinees\u2019 weapons to see if they met the criteria.Wang Teng walked over and took out his rune weapon carrier casket. He pulled out his weapons one by one. Of course, he didn\u2019t bring his rune gun.It went without thinking that weapons like guns were definitely not allowed to be used during the exam.The inspector was slightly shocked when he saw the weapon carrier casket. \u201cYoung boy, your equipment is not bad. Where did you buy it?\u201d\u201cCustom made on Taobao, the only one of its kind,\u201d Wang Teng replied, a bit proudly.The inspector smiled and didn\u2019t probe further. He started inspecting Wang Teng\u2019s weapons, which were boxing gloves and battle swords.\u201cThey are both one-star rune weapons. No wonder you don\u2019t want to use the weapons we\u2019re distributing,\u201d the inspector glanced at Wang Teng in astonishment.\u201cDo they fulfill the requirements?\u201d Wang Teng asked.\u201cOf course, why won\u2019t they? Only martial warriors can unleash the full potential of one-star rune weapons. In the hands of martial disciples, they are just a bit sharper. Could you be a martial warrior?\u201d asked the inspector.\u201cEven if you are a martial warrior and are able to unleash the full power of these one-star rune weapons, that\u2019s your own ability. It\u2019s not breaking the rules,\u201d another inspector at the side added.Wang Teng nodded. After the inspector confirmed that there was nothing wrong, Wang Teng kept the weapons. He carried his weapon carrier casket and went back to the examinees\u2019 queue.\u201cSo this thing is your weapon!\u201d It suddenly occurred to Lin Chuhan.\u201cI\u2019ve already said that this is my secret weapon,\u201d Wang Teng smiled and replied.\u201cTsk! How is this a secret?\u201d Lin Chuhan said with disdain.\u201cLin Chuhan!\u201d\u201cWang Teng!\u201dAt this moment, their names were finally called. They hurriedly went forward to collect their equipment.Wang Teng said to the staff, \u201cYou can just give me a lighter and more convenient protective battle uniform. I don\u2019t need weapons.\u201d\u201cThis set of battle uniforms is lighter and more convenient, but its defense ability is a little weak.\u201d The staff found a lighter set of black battle uniforms and passed it to Wang Teng.Wang Teng tried the size and nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll take this.\u201d\u2026An hour later, all the examinees had collected their protective battle uniform, battle boots, and the weapons they needed.The battle uniform and battle boots were all military items. They were made from special materials and were very durable.The battle uniform consisted of long pants and a singlet. The defense ability was good. It was able to withstand the sharp claws of a mutated beast and protect the vital organs in the body.As for the weapons, they were military-grade weapons too. There was a wide array of weapons in all forms of sizes.Although they weren\u2019t rune weapons, they were made from high-density high-strength alloys. Tearing the hard skin of a mutated beast wouldn\u2019t be a problem.It was worth mentioning that the weapons used by the examinees were all cold weapons. No guns were allowed.At this moment, all the examinees had changed into their battle uniforms and battle boots. They were getting used to the weapons in their hands. The exam hadn\u2019t started yet. Everyone was waiting patiently at the waiting area.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They kept fiddling with the weapons in their hands, but there was no pattern to it.When the time came, the two of them had started to get nervous like the rest of the students.Well, they couldn\u2019t be blamed either. The angry roar of the mutated beast and the gruesome scene afterward had caused a massive stimulation to the hearts of the examinees.Especially when the mutated beast wanted to charge out from the metal fence. The evil intention in its eyes was obvious. It treated the examinees as its food.There was actually a day when humans were reduced to food?!These examinees were like little flowers and young grasses in the ivory towers.They had never experienced any beating from society nor the brutality of the law of the jungle.Although they had long heard of the ruthlessness and scariness of the mutated beast through various channels, they had never felt it so directly.One could only understand how terrifying it was if they experienced it personally.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but ask when he looked at Lin Chuhan\u2019s expression.Honestly, it would be a little tough for her to fight with the mutated beast based on her ability.\u201cIt\u2019s alright!\u201d Lin Chuhan gritted her teeth and forced herself to remain calm.\u201cI thought that I could face this actual combat assessment without fear, but now, I feel a little frightened,\u201d Yang Jian said with a bitter smile.\u201cIt\u2019s alright to be scared. Look, who isn\u2019t?\u201d Wang Teng pointed to the other people around them.\u201cEven Zhou Wu and He Manrong are nervous. I feel much better now.\u201d Yang Jian heaved a long sigh of relief when he saw the expression on the faces of the advanced stage martial disciples.\u201cSigh\u2026\u201cBut, why do you seem not worried at all?\u201d\u201cI can wipe out these mutated beasts with one punch. What is there to worry about?\u201d Wang Teng said calmly.\u201cAre you kidding? Those mutated beasts have such thick skins. Although your strength is at 1000kg, you might not be able to kill one of them in a single punch.\u201d Yang Jian obviously didn\u2019t believe him.\u201cDo you think that your punch is a cannon?\u201d Lin Chuhan expressed her disdain too.\u201cWhy does no one believe me when I\u2019m speaking the truth?\u201d Wang Teng felt speechless.1\u2026Just like that, the trio chatted casually. After a series of quips and jokes, Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian didn\u2019t seem as nervous as before.\u201cEveryone\u2014\u201dThe youngsters\u2019 gazes shifted to the high platform when they heard the loud voice. The officer who guided the distribution of the battle uniforms was speaking to the examinees.\u201cThe actual combat assessment is about to start. I will be announcing the exam rules now!\u201cFirst, the actual combat assessment will start at 10 am and end at 6 am tomorrow. That means that you will be staying in this primary forest for one day and one night.\u201dWhen they heard this, the examinees\u2019 expressions changed.A day and a night!The primary forest was filled with danger. Yet, they were telling them that they had to stay inside for so long. How were they supposed to stay alive?The officer disregarded the uproar from the examinees below and continued speaking.\u201cDuring this period, you will have to find your own food, water, and your lodging for the night.\u201cAt the same time, if you want to pass the exam, you need to kill at least five mutated beasts. This is the minimum number. The more mutated beasts you kill and the higher the level of beasts, the higher the number of points you will receive. That way, in the future, you will have better choices.\u201cWe will be watching over the whole forest using satellite cameras for the entire exam duration. All of you have a communication device on your battle uniform.\u201cIt is able to track your location to ensure that everyone is under surveillance.\u201cThe level of the mutated beast you kill, as well as the number of mutated beasts you kill, will all be recorded. It will be changed into points and updated in your data.\u201cHowever, you must kill the beasts personally. Other people can\u2019t help you. If not, it will be considered cheating. You will be disqualified from the exam.1\u201cAlso, remember that students are not allowed to cut one another\u2019s throats during the actual combat assessment. However, there is still competition between all of you\u2026 Not only do you have to guard against mutated beasts, but you also need to be vigilant of other examinees.3\u201cThere\u2019s an emergency button on the communication device.\u201cWe have arranged many experienced martial disciples in the forest. There are even three martial warriors.\u201cWhen you press the emergency button, the staff nearest to you will immediately rush to your location based on your GPS.\u201cThe martial arts exam is important, but your life is even more important. Remember not to act rashly and overexert yourself. That is all I have to say.\u201dThe examinees\u2019 didn\u2019t look good when they heard the rules. There was a huge commotion.This actual combat assessment was so difficult.It was even more challenging than everyone thought. It was also much more dangerous than they imagined. Many people wanted to throw the towel right away.\u201cIf you want to give up, you can step forward now,\u201d the officer seemed to have seen through their thoughts and said calmly.The examinees exchanged glances with one another. In the end, a lady really took the initiative and stood up first.\u201cI\u2026 I want to leave.\u201dWhen she said this sentence, she was already sobbing.It was easy to guess how painful it was for her to make this decision.A martial arts examinee must have worked very hard for the martial arts exam, especially the students from ordinary families. Their families had probably scrimped and saved to provide them with the resources to practice martial arts.But now, she was giving up!Some of the students were shocked, while others felt complicated and understood her feelings. They felt as if they were relieved from a huge burden.Since someone had taken the lead, they felt justified and contented.After some disappointment, pain, and struggle, some students made the same decision and gave up.There was too little hope.At first, they wanted to fight for an ounce of hope. But, if they needed to risk their lives for it, their timid hearts didn\u2019t allow them to do it.After a while, the examinees that chose to give up stood sparsely in a corner. There were more than a few hundred people.\u201cDoes anyone else want to give up?\u201dThe officer asked. When he noticed that no other examinees came forward, he continued.\u201cIn that case, the rest of the examinees will be split at random into ten teams. You will enter the forest from different entrances.\u201dSome staff came forward to organize them. The examinees that were familiar with one another were split up into ten teams. Under the lead of the staff, they headed towards different entrances.Wang Teng stood in the middle of a team. There were unfamiliar faces all around him.Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian were in the other teams, so he couldn\u2019t see them anymore. He hoped that they were able to pass the assessment safely.Not long after, Wang Teng\u2019s team reached an entrance.After waiting for some time, the person leading their team looked at his watch and said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost time. You can enter now. Good luck to all of you.\u201dHe signaled to the guard to open the metal gates. Then, they allowed the examinees to enter.All the students remembered what the officer had said before this.There was competition between the examinees, and they needed to be aware of fellow students\u2026 Humans are unpredictable\u2014No one dared to underestimate this sentence.Hence, the second they entered the forest, they parted ways with one another and headed in different directions.Wang Teng chose to enter the depths of the rainforest in a certain direction. He was already wearing his boxing gloves and holding his battle sword in his hand.He did say that this exam was simple for him, but he wasn\u2019t stupid. He wouldn\u2019t let down his guard.There were tall and lush green trees all around him, and the ground was covered with dried fallen leaves. The stench of decaying leaves, along with the refreshing fragrance of grass and leaves, wafted into his nose.Roar\u2014The roars of beasts rose one after another in the distance.The actual combat assessment\u2014Start!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: Hunt For High-Level Mutated BeastsThe actual combat assessment had been going on for an hour.On the island, in the sealed-off forest, all the examinees were scattered and were hunting and fighting with different mutated beasts.The levels of the mutated beasts corresponded to the martial disciples\u2019 levels. They were split into low-level, middle-level, and high-level.The candidates were all intermediate stage and advanced stage martial disciples.The best choice was to kill the weakest low-level mutated beasts.Many people knew that this actual combat assessment wasn\u2019t just an exam. In fact, it was a training for the examinees\u2019 mentality and outdoor survival ability.After all, if they became martial warriors in the future and headed to Xingwu Continent, the environment there was much worse than this forest.In the future, they might not have such a good chance to find a mutated beast to train themselves. At that time, they would be facing terrifying star beasts.Currently, Wang Teng was squatting on a huge tree and staring at a giant forest lizard below him.This was the first mutated beast he had met.And, it was a high-level mutated beast!He didn\u2019t know if he was lucky or not. He had hung around for an hour but didn\u2019t meet any mutated beast. The moment he met one, it was a high-level mutated beast.This beast had mutated from a forest giant lizard. Its body was covered with thick and heavy scales, giving off a metallic glimmer. Its claws were as sharp as knives, and its fangs looked like spikes. They were able to pierce through a person in an instant.At first, Wang Teng thought that it hadn\u2019t noticed him yet. He was planning to sneak an attack on it. Nonetheless, this was the first time he met a mutated beast. Hence, he didn\u2019t act rashly.Out of his expectations, the forest giant lizard swung its tail at him. The huge force cut the tree he was using to hide into two.Boom!The tree cracked and fell.\u201cF**k, it\u2019s so strong?\u201dWang Teng hurriedly stepped on the ground and leaped into the air. Then, he waved his battle sword and exerted strength all over his body. He struck his sword down at the giant forest lizard.Roar!The giant lizard opened its mouth and let out a growl. It swung its tail again and swept it towards him.This tail sweep was extremely powerful. Even the air around it gave off short exploding sounds.Wang Teng\u2019s eyebrows jumped slightly. Naturally, he wasn\u2019t stupid; he wouldn\u2019t receive the attack forcefully. He executed his presence enlightenment stage Basic Footwork and actually managed to turn his body in the air. The maneuver allowed him to evade the attack easily.Wang Teng instantly lowered his center of gravity and landed on the ground. He punched the side of the giant lizard with his fist.Bang!His strength was terrifying. This punch caused the scale armor of the giant lizard to crack open, even hurting the bones underneath.Howl\u2014The giant lizard howled in pain. It opened its mouth and wanted to pounce on Wang Teng. The stinging stench of blood flowed right into Wang Teng\u2019s face.\u201cHmph!\u201dWang Teng snorted. His speed accelerated, and he evaded the giant lizard\u2019s attack. Next, he raised the battle sword in his hand and charged forward.Crack!Fresh blood spurted out!His sword slashed right through the giant lizard\u2019s mouth. It cut off a huge portion of the lizard\u2019s head. The next moment, the giant lizard fell to the ground with a thud. It was dead.\u201cSigh!\u201dWang Teng let out a breath. High-level mutated beasts were harder to deal with than he had imagined. However, it was still a piece of cake for him.He walked towards the giant lizard to take a look.Strength*20Blank Attribute*5Wang Teng instantly felt thrilled.Blank Attribute!He saw blank attributes again!After Wang Teng picked them up, he didn\u2019t use them in a hurry. Instead, he kept them first.Wang Teng looked at the corpse of the giant lizard and went into deep thought.Is there a higher probability of dropping blank attributes if I kill mutated beasts and star beasts?He couldn\u2019t help but remember the giant crow star beast that was killed the other time. That star beast had dropped 60 blank attributes. In contrast, this giant lizard had dropped only 5 points.He had picked up blank attributes from martial disciples in the past before, but the probability was really low. Also, it wasn\u2019t a lot.Sigh, can\u2019t the system explain the settings all at once? Why do I have to figure it out myself?Wang Teng sighed helplessly. He decided to try it on a few more mutated beasts. If his guess was correct, this exam venue for their actual combat assessment would become an excellent place to collect blank attributes!An evil smile immediately appeared on his face.Almost simultaneously, all the mutated beasts in the entire forest felt an evil intention engulfing them.\u2026\u201cReport. An examinee has already killed a high-level mutated beast.\u201dAt the same time, in a huge central control room situated in the island camping ground, computer screens filled up the entire place. All the screens were showing the images of the examinees in the forest.A few hundred staff stared at the screens without blinking. Suddenly, a staff member shouted loudly.The leaders from the Ministry of Education, including Director He, as well as the higher authorities from the top three martial arts academies and the president of the martial arts association, Qin Hanxuan, were all gathered in this room.At first, they were chatting casually. When they heard this shout, though, they immediately turned in that direction.The staff member clicked on his computer and sent the image on his screen to the wall so that everyone could see it clearly.He even replayed the scene just now.\u201cHaha, indeed, it\u2019s that person.\u201d Director He couldn\u2019t help but laugh when he saw the young man standing in front of the giant lizard on the screen.\u201cDirector He, do you know this guy?\u201d The principal of the Donghai branch Leiting Martial House, Jiang Hong, asked.\u201cThis young man is not bad. His battle awareness is really strong,\u201d the principal of the Donghai branch Bailian Martial House, Gu Hefei, complimented Wang Teng.\u201cThis examinee is the only extreme martial disciple from our Donghai this year,\u201d Director He smiled. He secretly glanced at the valiant-looking man sitting properly at the host\u2019s seat.Qin Hanxuan and Fu Tiandao exchanged glances with each other. They didn\u2019t speak.The valiant-looking man calmly glanced at the screen. He didn\u2019t express too many emotions. However, when he heard that this was an extreme martial disciple, he raised his eyebrows slightly.\u201cExtreme martial disciple. Not bad, let\u2019s continue watching,\u201d the man said in a composed manner.Director He was elated. This sentence was enough to prove that Governor Jiang had developed an interest in Wang Teng.This man was the governor-general of Donghai!The last time, Qin Hanxuan and Fu Tiandao had said that he was on the brink of his breakthrough. Now, he had appeared at the martial arts exam\u2026No one else said anything. After all, the exam had just started.However, they couldn\u2019t help but pay more attention to Wang Teng.\u2026Time passed slowly. Gruesome battles were happening in many different corners of the forest.These examinees didn\u2019t have an easy time like Wang Teng. After all, this was their first time facing a mutated beast. Some people couldn\u2019t even release one-fifth of their true power.For an intermediate stage martial disciple to kill a low-level mutated beast, he needed to use a lot of strength and brain. In theory, they knew that they had to target the weak spots, but in an actual battle, everything was thrown to the back of their minds.Some people even cowered right at the start. Before they started fighting, they had already run away in a flurry.Within two to three hours, close to half of the examinees were eliminated.3 pm.On an empty area in the forest, two black figures were engaged in a fight.Slash!After a cold flash of light, the two figures separated from each other. Wang Teng landed on the ground stably. The battle sword in his hand was pointing diagonally at the ground.A trace of blood dripped down the tip of the sword and landed on the leaves-covered earth.The other black figure slammed hard on the ground. Its head flew up high before falling back. A large amount of blood spurted out like a fountain.\u201cThey are both high-level mutated beasts, but this green python was harder to deal with than that forest giant lizard.\u201dWang Teng lamented to himself. Then, he went forward.Speed*15Blank Attribute*6As expected, blank attributes were dropped again. Wang Teng was cheering secretly in his heart.He picked them up.The instant he finished picking up the attribute bubbles, the python head at the side suddenly leaped up and opened its mouth wide, baring its fangs. It wanted to bite Wang Teng.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you,\u201d Wang Teng sneered. He slashed his battle sword sideways and cut the python head into two.In the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019, it was mentioned that mutated snakes had a strong vitality. Even if their heads were chopped off, their central nervous systems would still be functioning for a short period. It would produce certain instinctive reactions. If one wasn\u2019t careful enough, they might be attacked by it when it was at the brink of death.It didn\u2019t mean that the larger mutated beasts were poisonous. If a mutated beast was poisonous before it mutated, not only would its size grow bigger, its poison would become even more deadly.If a person was bitten by it, he might die on the spot.Hence, they needed to be extremely careful.Wang Teng turned around and prepared to leave. Suddenly, the sound of something cutting through the air was heard behind him.Swoosh!The sound was shrill and loud, and one could guess how fast the speed was from the wind. A stinging pain was felt on his leg.Wang Teng reacted almost instantly.His speed increased exponentially, and he executed his footwork with full power. His body moved away slightly from his original position.Boom!A sharp arrow cut through the air beside his leg. It pierced into a huge tree and formed a large hole in it.Examinees weren\u2019t allowed to endanger each other\u2019s lives, but they were able to defeat one another. That way, the mutated beasts that the other party killed would be counted as the winner\u2019s.Just now, that arrow wasn\u2019t aimed at Wang Teng\u2019s vital point. Still, if it had hit his thigh, his battle ability would have decreased greatly.Wang Teng looked at the examinee on the tree far away who had released this arrow. He immediately dashed into the bushes and executed his footwork\u2026The snake walk!The other party wasn\u2019t able to get a lock on him. Then, Wang Teng moved in the direction where his opponent was at.F**K!Are you looking for death!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Your Father Is Ultimately Your Father!The expression of the examinee, who had tried to sneak an attack on Wang Teng, underwent a change when he noticed how fast Wang Teng\u2019s reaction and how decisive he was. The moment he evaded his attack, Wang Teng snuck into the bushes and ran towards him using the bushes as his cover.Retreat!The examinee turned and ran away without any hesitation.The basic battle technique he practiced was Basic Arrow Skill. It was suitable for long-range attacks and not close combats. Just now, when he saw the way Wang Teng fought with the high-level mutated beast, he knew that he would lose if he got caught by the young man.Wang Teng shuttled back and forth in the forest. He executed his footwork, and his figure kept shifting like the clouds. The other party wasn\u2019t able to aim at him.How dare you sneak an attack on me!Do you think I\u2019m easy to bully?Wang Teng\u2019s expression was cold as he increased his speed with every step. He dashed towards the other examinee.\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe other examinee got a fright when he saw Wang Teng rushing over. How could he be so fast?The distance between the two of them got closer and closer.As the guy ran away, he continued shooting arrows behind him. He hoped that he would be able to stall Wang Teng for some time, even if it was just to lower his speed of chasing him.However, even though the arrows he shot caused some obstruction to Wang Teng, the distance between the two of them didn\u2019t get longer. It continued shortening.Wang Teng\u2019s speed was much faster than his, and his arrows were almost finished!After a few seconds, the distance between the two of them was less than 30 meters.\u201cDie!\u201dWang Teng stepped on the ground, and the earth below him cracked. His entire body shot out like a raging bear. His sword formed an arc in the air as he flung it down on the examinee.The examinee was flabbergasted. He raised his bow above his head to block this attack.Clang!When the bow and the sword collided, a metallic tremble rang out.The examinee\u2019s expression changed. He could feel a powerful force boring down on him. He couldn\u2019t control himself and flew backward.Bang!He slammed heavily on the ground. Fresh blood seeped out of the corner of his mouth. He shouted towards the forest beside him, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you all moving? How long are you going to watch the show?\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201d Wang Teng scoffed. He furiously charged at the examinee.\u201cDon\u2019t come over!\u201dThe other party\u2019s expression changed for the umpteenth time. He quickly crawled up from the ground and retreated.Wang Teng punched him without saying anything.\u201cStop!\u201d A loud shout suddenly came from the forest behind him. A strong gust of wind assaulted Wang Teng\u2019s back.Wang Teng evaded the attack as though he had eyes on his back. His hard and sturdy iron fist still smashed into the examinee\u2019s face.Crack! The other party\u2019s nose bridge collapsed. It was quite obvious. Blood splattered everywhere from his nose, and the guy kept screaming in pain.Wang Teng swept his legs this time. The examinee was already dizzy from the punch. Now, his vision turned black, and he wasn\u2019t able to withstand the attack at all. In an instant, he flew away because of the kick.Basic Arrow Skill*10Beginner Stage Arrow Talent*3Huh?\u00a0Wang Teng\u2019s eyes lit up.\u00a0There are talent attributes!The attributes this examinee dropped were quite impressive.He picked them up.The two examinees that had just walked out of the forest didn\u2019t protect their companion when they saw what happened. Instead, they watched Wang Teng injure him without doing anything. Their expressions turned ugly.\u201cWang Teng, you\u2019re too ruthless. We are all examinees. How can you land such a heavy blow!\u201d One of the examinees pointed at Wang Teng and shouted.\u201cI was wondering who it was. So, it\u2019s you, Young Master Li.\u201d Wang Teng turned around and looked at the people who had just appeared.One of them was a complete stranger to him. He didn\u2019t recognize the man. However, the other was an old friend\u2014Li Rongcheng!\u201cWhy? Are you planning to get some of your egos back because you were tortured by me too many times?\u201d Wang Teng smiled at him ambiguously. \u201cWhere did you get these two dumb boys? How did you trick them into seeking death together with you?\u201dLi Rongcheng\u2019s expression turned even worse when Wang Teng exposed his true thoughts. A hint of anxiousness flashed past his eyes.Indeed, he was the one who found these two people.Wang Teng had opposed him many times and caused him to lose his face. Also, he already knew he was beaten up for no reason at that time because of Wang Teng\u2019s framing. He was the one who caused him to carry that blame!This bastard was so sinister!Also, during the level inspection, Wang Teng displayed the ability of an extreme martial disciple. He had amazed the crowd with a single feat and made him exceptionally jealous.Thus, he tricked these two advanced-stage martial disciples from other schools and planned to kick Wang Teng out of the actual combat assessment.Of course, Li Rongcheng was able to convince these two advanced-stage martial disciples because he knew them before. He also promised them certain benefits.Unfortunately, a boss was still a boss. Your father was still your father!The examinee who tried to sneak attack Wang Teng didn\u2019t succeed. Instead, he was beaten up like a dog. He laid on the floor, not able to get up anymore.These guys were already frightened of Wang Teng\u2019s ability. Now, with one person down, only Li Rongcheng and the other advanced stage youngster were left. Their chances of winning were even less.When he heard Wang Teng\u2019s words, the other advanced stage martial disciple glanced at Li Rongcheng. That gaze caused Li Rongcheng\u2019s heart to drop.\u201cSince it has already reached this state, there\u2019s no point in saying anything anymore. Let\u2019s just fight.\u201dSurprisingly, the advanced stage martial disciple was extremely decisive. He knew Li Rongcheng\u2019s intention, but they had already formed a grudge with Wang Teng. Hence, there was probably no point in begging for mercy. They should just work together and get rid of Wang Teng.\u201cAlright.\u201d Li Rongcheng gritted his teeth and didn\u2019t say much. He held his battle blade in his hand and charged towards Wang Teng first.The seed of suspicion was already planted in them. However, they had no choice but to work together now. He must show enough sincerity.As expected, when the advanced stage martial disciple saw him attacking first, his vigilant expression softened a little. Then, he joined the assault on Wang Teng.He held a huge and heavy battle mace in his hand. As he waved it around, the sound of air breaking could be heard. He smashed it viciously at Wang Teng.Li Rongcheng executed his presence enlightenment stage Basic Blade Skill. His blade moved as fast as lightning and covered Wang Teng up entirely.The attack of two advanced stage martial disciples was troublesome and tough to handle, even for an extreme martial disciple.However, Wang Teng\u2019s true ability wasn\u2019t that of an extreme martial disciple. He was a martial warrior!Not only that, all his battle techniques were at a higher stage than the other two martial disciples. Even if he didn\u2019t release his martial warrior ability, he was still able to beat the two people up.He executed his presence enlightenment stage Basic Footwork to its fullest potential. His body spun and turned in the smallest area possible. It was as if he wasn\u2019t moving at all.However, Li Rongcheng\u2019s blade couldn\u2019t even touch the edge of his clothes.\u201cPresence enlightenment stage footwork!\u201dLi Rongcheng was stunned.At this time, the other advanced stage martial disciple\u2019s metal mace had arrived in front of him. A cold smile appeared at the corner of Wang Teng\u2019s lips.He pushed his fists out and took the attack of the mace head-on!Clang~Wang Teng was wearing boxing gloves, so his hands weren\u2019t injured at all. On the other hand, his opponent took a few steps back. His hands that were holding the mace kept trembling.The battle mace almost slipped out of his hands.Wang Teng continued his victorious pursuit and appeared in front of Li Rongcheng in a blink of an eye. Under his astounded gaze, he pushed his fists out.Li Rongcheng wanted to dodge, but he realized that his body couldn\u2019t catch up with his thoughts\u2026 He was defeated in one move!\u201cWhy\u2026 Why is it the same as before?\u201dHis heart was filled with unwillingness. He remembered the previous duel they had in the school\u2019s stadium. An intense bitterness overflowed him.When that advanced stage martial disciple saw that Li Rongcheng couldn\u2019t even handle a single attack from Wang Teng, his pupils constricted. He gritted his teeth and forcefully controlled his trembling hands. Just when he was about to raise his battle mace, a pair of iron fists welcomed him.Boom!The fists landed on his chest, and the overwhelming force threw him back.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d In the instant he flew out, an inconceivable thought appeared in his heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe examinee that got flung back by Wang Teng\u2019s punch was a strength-type advanced stage martial disciple.But, at this moment, even he was amazed by Wang Teng\u2019s strength.A moment ago, Wang Teng had received the attack of his battle mace forcefully with his fists. This time, when Wang Teng punched him, he was unable to retaliate at all.Was this the ability of an extreme martial disciple?The difference was too huge!At first, he was very decisive and felt that since they had already formed a grudge, they should just kick Wang Teng out of the martial arts exam. However, now, he regretted his decision.At the same time, he hated Li Rongcheng terribly. This bastard. How did he provoke such a powerful figure?He wasn\u2019t the only one. At this moment, Li Rongcheng also felt puzzled.The last time, he was defeated in a single blow. Now, the same thing had repeated itself. However, he felt that Wang Teng\u2019s ability had gotten stronger\u2026 His chest was hurting so much!The gap was getting bigger and bigger. How was he supposed to fight with Wang Teng?Wang Teng glanced at the duo. There were a few attribute bubbles dropped around them.Speed*5Strength*12Basic Mace Skill*5\u2026Wang Teng shook his head. These were all very ordinary. As for the Basic Mace Skill, well\u2026 he tried to imagine himself waving the huge mace around\u2026Forget it. This weapon wasn\u2019t suitable for him!Wang Teng was too lazy to pick up the attributes.2Am I getting arrogant, or are they too weak?They must be too weak!Wang Teng questioned himself for a second. His gaze then landed on the examinee who had dropped the Beginner Stage Arrow Skill Talent unconsciously.This was the first time someone dropped a weapon-type talent!This fellow must have some ability. Wickedness slowly filled up his gaze.On the other side, although the examinee was unconscious, he suddenly shivered.Wang Teng walked over and hit the examinee without waking him up.1He especially took care of his head and hit it a few times!Spirit*0.2Beginner Stage Arrow Talent*1Basic Arrow Skill*2Basic Arrow Skill*1Beginner Stage Arrow Talent*1Spirit*0.1\u2026Wang Teng only left the guy alone when the attribute bubbles stopped dropping.The examinee woke up from the pain. He felt as though he had a dream. In his dream, someone tortured and tormented him terribly\u2026 He was really pitiful!But, the moment he woke up, he felt pain all over his body. He couldn\u2019t help but groan in agony.Li Rongcheng and the other examinee had witnessed this brutal act first-hand. The muscles on their faces twitched uncontrollably, and a chill crept up to their hearts.1Oh my god, he must be a devil!He doesn\u2019t even let go of an unconscious guy. How can he bear to be so cruel!Scary!If they weren\u2019t heavily injured, they would have run away like their lives depended on it.Wang Teng suddenly turned his head and glanced at the two examinees. They shuddered in fright, and their expressions warped.Especially when they saw him walking towards them, a sense of uneasiness rose from the depth of their hearts. This devil\u2026\u201cWang Teng, what do you want to do?\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cWe have already lost. What else do you want to do? Stop when you should. Don\u2019t be too outrageous!\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dWhen he heard Wang Teng laughing in disdain, Li Rongcheng\u2019s face turned green. He looked at Wang Teng as he stood right in front of him and shouted in panic, \u201cWang Teng, don\u2019t cut off all your routes of retreat. I suggest you leave some room for yourself!\u201dWang Teng clicked his tongue. He didn\u2019t expect Li Rongcheng to be so good at talking. The guy sure had a glib tongue.He raised his big fist and aimed it at Li Rongcheng\u2019s head.One punch and Li Rongcheng\u2019s vision turned black.Spirit*0.5Oh? Not bad!Continue\u2026Bang, bang, bang!Spirit*0.1Spirit*0.1\u2026Unfortunately, after dropping two more Spirit attributes, he stopped. Li Rongcheng grabbed the opportunity during the interval and hurriedly pressed the emergency button\u2014He would give up the assessment!He didn\u2019t want to make this decision, but if he remained here any longer, he might be beaten half to death\u2026 This devil!Wang Teng wanted to turn to the other examinee, but he realized that the examinee had already pressed the emergency button a long time ago. Now, hurried footsteps were heard not far away from them.The examinee, who had sneak attacked Wang Teng, finally understood what had happened. He pressed the emergency button too.The three of them were forced to give up!Wang Teng shook his head and ignored them. He turned around and left.When the staff of the exam venue arrived and saw the sad plight of the three students, they were stunned. What happened here?\u201d\u2026\u201cThis fellow is a little vicious!\u201dIn the central control room, everyone looked at the scene on the screen with trembling eyelids.\u201cDid you notice that his Basic Footwork has reached the presence enlightenment stage?\u201d The principal of Bailian Martial House, Gu Hefei, suddenly asked.\u201cYou\u2019re right. This Wang Teng is a genius.\u201d The principal of Leiting Martial House, Jiang Hong, nodded.\u201cOur Bailian Martial House wants this examinee. No one is going to snatch him from me,\u201d Gu Hefei said.\u201cHmph, we haven\u2019t even opened our mouth. Why are you in such a hurry?\u201d Jiang Hong complained.\u201cHahaha, there\u2019s no need to fight. Wang Teng is already a member of our Jixin Martial House,\u201d Fu Tiandao couldn\u2019t help but laugh happily.\u201cYou!\u201dGu Hefei and Jiang Hong felt disappointed. At the same time, they glared furiously at Fu Tiandao.They had finally managed to find such a good seedling, but he already belonged to Jixin Martial House!\u2026Time passed by. The massacre in the forest became more and more intense.Many examinees got injured during their first fight with the mutated beasts. Those suffering severe injuries pressed the emergency button and left the exam helplessly. Those that only had light injuries gritted their teeth and persevered. They had experienced a fight already, so they were gradually getting used to it.For many of the candidates, this was their first time facing the mutated beasts. They were strong enough, so even though they felt a little uncomfortable killing mutated beasts, they started to familiarize themselves with the sensation after killing a few of them.Most people chose low-level mutated beasts as their first prey. After getting used to the situation, they would look for middle-level and high-level mutated beasts.Especially those advanced stage martial disciples. These students wanted to enter top universities, so they needed to achieve good results. That was the only way to get the attention of the top universities.Night dawned on the forest.After the fights in the day, most of the students were exhausted and hungry. However, they needed to find their own food and water to fill up their stomachs.They also needed to find a place to rest for the night.At night, the forest was even more dangerous. All kinds of mutated beasts came out to search for prey\u2026The number of mutated beasts seemed to have increased suddenly. Wang Teng stood on a huge tree and looked into the distance. The shadows of many mutated beasts could be seen in the dense forest.He wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed the anomaly. Other examinees had observed this point too.That\u2019s good. I can get more blank attributes.Wang Teng smiled slightly. In the day, he had already killed six high-level mutated beasts. He had also finished off nine middle-level mutated beasts, collecting a total of 43 blank attributes.Let\u2019s find some food first.Just as this thought appeared in his mind, a wild mutated boar suddenly appeared in his vision.Well, it looks edible.Wang Teng jumped down, and the glint from his sword formed an arc in the air.Swoosh\u2014Blood splattered, and this wild boar with thick skin was directly beheaded.In the beginning, Wang Teng had purposely suppressed his ability because he wanted to train with mutated beasts. But, in the end, he changed his opinion.What was more important than collecting attributes?Thus, he decided to let himself go and kill as many mutated beasts as he could.With his ability, this middle-level mutated beast would be finished off in one blow.Wang Teng chopped off a large piece of thigh meat and held it in his hand.He then found a mountain cave and drilled wood to make fire. In the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers,\u2019 this was basic knowledge. He twirled the wood twice, and a small flame appeared.Wang Teng barbecued the wild boar thigh and filled up his stomach. After resting for some time, he walked out of the cave and continued his hunt for mutated beasts.This was a sleepless night.\u2026It was already midnight.In the central control room, the hunting result of the examinees was projected on the wall through the projector.All the leaders were looking at the results silently.\u201cYan Peng from Huiying High School has already killed 13 mutated beasts. Three high-level ones, four middle-level ones, and six low-level beasts. This result is really good,\u201d Gu Hefei said.\u201cZhou Wu from No.1 High School isn\u2019t bad either. He has also killed 13 mutated beasts, three high-level, three middle-level, and seven low-level. He\u2019s just one step behind,\u201d Jiang Hong said.\u201cThere\u2019s also Dong Fei from Shiyan High School. He killed 14 mutated beasts, four high-level, five middle-level, and five low-level.\u201dThe bosses mentioned all the outstanding students from the different schools, but most of their attention was placed on the number one examinee\u2014Wang Teng!They would glance at his results occasionally.It rose again.The same thought appeared in the leaders\u2019 minds almost simultaneously.He had killed a total of 28 mutated beasts\u2014wait, it was 29 mutated beasts now. Another high-level mutated beast had lost its life under his sword.Among them, 18 were high-level mutated beasts. There were even lesser middle-level beasts, only 10.The leaders didn\u2019t know how to describe Wang Teng anymore. It seemed so easy for him to kill the mutated beasts. Most of the time, he would finish them with a single wave of his sword. The most he would do was to add another punch.Of course, they had forgotten about the two mutated beasts Wang Teng killed right at the start. Based on the ability he displayed afterward, he must be fooling around back then.When we were young, were we able to do this?\u00a0All the leaders started asking themselves.The answer was a resounding \u2018no.\u2019 If they really were to fight with the mutated beasts, they might be tormented like crazy.Even Governor Jiang felt the corners of his eyes twitching.The potential this fellow displayed was almost on par with the top figures in society.But it was just his potential\u2026Growth had its consequences. It was impossible to predict what would happen in the future.Another two hours passed. The forest was dark and silent. Occasionally, the roar of a wild animal would shatter the peaceful illusion.No one knew what that was.Although this environment was daunting and taking a toll on their bodies, the examinees gritted their teeth and persevered.Some examinees had already killed five mutated beasts, so they were qualified for the martial arts course. To be safe, they hid in a secluded spot and stopped going out.On the other hand, Wang Teng continued hunting. He was having one hell of a time in this exam. He had already collated 85 blank attributes. It was a huge gain.Currently, multiple agile black figures were surrounding him. They appeared from all different directions.The furs of these mutated beasts were greyish-black. They were able to hide very well under the night sky. Their eyes gave off an eerie green glow, and a low groan could be heard from their mouths.A disgusting stench wafted into his nose.Wang Teng\u2019s figure shuttled around like a butterfly dancing among the flowers. This bunch of jackals and wolves kept missing him. Every time his sword slashed through the air, a life would be lost.After a few minutes, the ground was filled with the corpses of jackals and wolves. Only a few beasts had survived this nightmare. The bedraggled survivors ran away in a flurry. Wang Teng was too lazy to chase after them, though.He collected another eight middle-level mutated beasts!Blank Attribute +16!Wang Teng was about to turn and leave when suddenly, the ground started shaking violently. Small cracks began appearing on the ground\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The entire mountain below his feet seemed to be vibrating.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201dWang Teng\u2019s expression changed. He glanced around him and noticed that the trees were all shaking too. The leaves rustled and fell.The other examinees felt the vibration too.Those further away didn\u2019t feel the shaking as much, so they continued hunting for mutated beasts after a moment of astonishment.However, the examinees in the same mountain as Wang Teng felt the vibration vividly.Their expressions underwent a slight change. The examinees hesitated and wondered if they should leave immediately. However, there were many mutated beasts on this mountain. Those examinees that wanted to achieve good results found it difficult to give up.Also, there were many safe spots on this mountain. The examinees who had hidden inside after meeting the minimum requirements walked out in a daze. They didn\u2019t know what was happening.A few minutes later, the quaking stopped. It seemed as though it had never appeared.In the central control room, Governor Jiang sat in the host\u2019s seat and asked calmly, \u201cWhat happened just now?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an extinct volcano on this island. Some strange movements might have occurred inside the volcano,\u201d the staff below reported in a hurry.1\u201cExtinct volcano?\u201d Governor Jiang looked at him.The staff felt cold sweat pouring down his forehead as the governor stared at him.\u201cGo and investigate immediately. The safety of the examinees is crucial,\u201d Governor Jiang said.\u201cYes, yes. I will arrange someone to investigate it at once,\u201d the staff trembled in fear and replied.\u2026The assessment continued.Boom!Another huge earthquake. This time, it was even more severe.Roar!Howl!\u2026Suddenly, the mutated beasts in the mountains roared and howled. You could almost sense the fear in their voices.Many examinees were fighting with mutated beasts. They exchanged blows with the beasts and were having a ball of a time.When the ground vibrated, the examinees were stunned on the spot. The mutated beasts, though, had already fled in a hurry.They weren\u2019t escaping up the mountains. Instead, they were furiously dashing down.Boom!The examinees soon realized that it wasn\u2019t just one or two beasts escaping. All the mutated beasts were running away from the mountain. The scene was appalling.The peak of the mountain swayed, and the ground vibrated occasionally. In this second, all the examinees finally realized that something frightening was happening.\u201cIs this an earthquake?\u201dMany examinees took a wild guess.In the central control room, Governor Jiang stood up with a stern expression. \u201cEnd the actual combat assessment.\u201dThe people below carried out the order without any delays. The siren blared around the island.The ear-shattering sound of the broadcast system spread through the entire primary forest.\u201cAll examinees, all examinees, a strange activity is detected in the extinct volcano at the exam venue. The actual combat assessment will end early. Please hurry towards the nearest exit at the fastest speed and leave the exam venue!\u201d\u201cRepeat, all examinees\u2026\u201dThe announcement kept repeating to ensure that all the examinees heard it.Extinct volcano!Damn it, why didn\u2019t they mention it earlier?The expressions of the examinees who heard the broadcast changed slightly. They sprinted towards the entrance of the forest at their maximum speeds.Wang Teng\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t any different from the rest. He turned and charged down the mountain without any hesitation. However, he was deep inside the forest, so there was a huge distance between him and the bottom of the mountain.The mutated beasts in the mountain had gone entirely crazy. They surged down the mountain in many different waves. The examinees that couldn\u2019t retreat in time could only make way for the beasts.However, that meant that they would be stuck in the mountain.Some examinees decided to take the risk. They wanted to make use of the chaos to get down the mountain since the mutated beasts wouldn\u2019t bother about them now.Their thoughts were good, but the reality was cruel. The frantic mutated beasts attacked anyone and anything without any difference.Anything that was in their way, whether it was trees, other beasts, or humans, they would smash them away.One examinee got hit by a mutated beast and fell to the ground. Instantly, he was stamped into a pile of minced meat. He didn\u2019t even have the time to scream.The examinees that saw this scene shuddered in fright. They didn\u2019t dare to act rashly anymore.However, this was a picture in one corner of the exam venue. At the moment, tragedies were happening in all corners of the mountain. The number of deaths this year was increasing exponentially.The staff in the exam venue were helpless in the face of this situation. They wanted to help, but there was nothing they could do in front of the waves of mutated beasts.\u2026\u201cEveryone, it\u2019s up to us now.\u201d Governor Jiang\u2019s voice was emotionless as he walked out of the central control room in large strides. His legs weren\u2019t touching the ground.\u201cGotta stretch our legs once in a while.\u201dThe other leaders quickly answered. They walked out of the central control room and leaped out of the camp. Turning into black figures, the bigwigs disappeared into the night sky.\u2026At this moment, Wang Teng was standing on the crown of a huge tree. He was looking at the peak of the mountain in the far distance.Spiritual Sight!He saw fire Force raging at the peak of the mountain. Balls of red lights were spurting out of the crater.Is it going to erupt? Or did something else happen?Wang Teng silently wondered to himself. He looked down at the frantic mutated beasts and frowned uncontrollably.I wonder how Lin Chuhan is.Hmm? Who are they?Suddenly, he saw three figures engulfed entirely in three different color rays. They were actually dashing up the mountain.Three martial warriors!Under his Spiritual Sight, he could see their elements clearly. Yellow, green, and blue\u2014they were earth element, wood element, and water element\u2026The color of the water element was different from the ice element.The ice element was dark blue, while the water element was light blue.These three must be the martial warriors protecting the examinees. Are they planning to go up the mountain to understand the situation!?\u00a0Wang Teng pondered for a moment and guessed their intention.The three martial warriors charged into the beasts\u2019 tide as though there was no resistance. They forcefully cleared a bloody trail.Strength*3Speed*2Blank Attribute*1Blank Attribute*3Speed*2Blank Attribute*1\u2026Many attribute bubbles were dropped amidst the beast tide.Wang Teng thought for a moment.\u00a0Why don\u2019t I pick them up?Hence, he secretly followed the three martial warriors and picked up the attributes dropped along the way.Impressive, impressive!The destructive ability of three martial warriors is indeed amazing!Wang Teng made a comparison silently. He realized that if he were to fight against these three, the chances of winning were minimal.The three martial warriors fought all the way up to the peak of the mountain.Wang Teng followed them behind. When he saw the three martial warriors jumping into the crater, he hesitated. Should he go down with them?What if the volcano suddenly erupted?Forget it. My life is more important!Wang Teng contemplated for a moment and felt the value of his life. He turned and planned to go down the mountain. Suddenly, he felt something under his feet.\u201cAn examination identity card!\u201dHe picked it up. Instantly, he cursed uncontrollably, \u201cF**k!\u201dAt that moment, Wang Teng\u2019s expression turned extremely ugly.\u201cLin Chuhan!\u201dWhy is her examination identity card here?Wang Teng\u2019s gaze landed on the crater unconsciously. Suddenly, he had a bad feeling.\u00a0Could she be so unlucky?Maybe she just dropped it in a moment of panic. She might have already escaped the mountain.\u00a0He consoled himself and forced himself to hurry down the mountain.He took two steps before gritting his teeth.F**k, why did you run all the way here? Aren\u2019t you creating trouble for me?Wang Teng felt a headache coming on. He leaped up and jumped down the crater.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: Volcano SalamanderWang Teng landed on a protruding rock on the rock wall. He scanned the environment inside the crater.Indeed, this looked like an extinct volcano. The walls around him had been eroded by the wind and were fragmented.But, this was what gave him a place to land.Where are they?There was no one in sight.He frowned. Wang Teng could only continue going down. There were many broken layers and blindspots below, so it was tough to see.The three martial warriors that went down a moment ago were nowhere in sight.There must be something underneath!Crack!Suddenly, the protruding rock that Wang Teng was stepping on cracked without any warning. His entire center of gravity dropped, and his body fell uncontrollably.Wang Teng stepped on a falling piece of rock in mid-air.Boom!The rock exploded into fragments.Wang Teng used the recoil to leap onto the nearest rock.Breathe\u2026Just as he heaved a sigh of relief, his pupils suddenly constricted.There\u2019s a cave!On the right side of the place he landed on, he could see a concealed long and narrow entrance of a cave.He wanted to go over, but he stopped abruptly.Spiritual Sight!He executed his talent and saw huge amounts of fire Force seeping out from the cave.Wang Teng scanned his surroundings again and noticed that this was the source of the Force he saw spurting out of the crater.As expected, there\u2019s something wrong with this place!He pondered for a moment before putting his feet forward. He sneaked into the cave.The cave was narrow and long, barely wide enough for one person to walk. Wang Teng moved forward carefully. The vigilance in his heart kept rising.With the help of his Spiritual Sight, he could see the fire Force getting thicker as he walked deeper into the cave. The situation inside must be tricky to handle.Once he entered the cave, he noticed that the temperature was much higher than outside. As he got deeper, the temperature kept rising.Wa\u2026A strange sound suddenly came from the depth of the cave.What sound is that?Wang Teng stopped in his tracks. He hesitated for a second before hastening his pace and rushing towards the depth of the cave.The sound had probably come from some unknown mutated beast. Considering the density of the fire Force in this area, it might even be a star beast!With Lin Chuhan\u2019s ability, if she was inside, the odds were stacked like a mountain against her!What is wrong with the exam board? Why is an accident like this happening during the martial arts exam? They are so unreliable!Not long after, a light appeared in front of Wang Teng. He had reached the end of the tunnel. A red light shone in.The scorching heat overwhelmed him. As he got nearer, he felt the temperature rising exponentially. Wang Teng secretly moved the ice Force around his body.That was the only way to prevent him from feeling like he was in a furnace.Wang Teng tilted his body and stood at the edge of the entrance. He allowed the protruding rock wall to block his body. Then, he peeked inside.There was a massive space inside the cave. In the middle, there was a pit where magma could be seen flowing below. This was the source of the scorching heat.As for the three martial warriors that entered before him, they were fighting with two star beasts!Star beasts!They must be star beasts! They had Force in their bodies!The two star beasts looked a little like salamanders. However, they were enormous, and their entire body was red. They had scale armors covering them, with long horns decorating their heads. They kept giving off \u2018Wa\u2019 sounds that sounded like babies crying.It\u2019s a star beast!Wang Teng was dumbstruck. Didn\u2019t they say that there were only mutated beasts here? Where did star beasts come from?He hurriedly searched for Lin Chuhan\u2019s figure.Lin Chuhan would be helpless in front of these two star beasts. It was the same as serving herself to them on a platter. These two beasts might not even feel full after eating her.However, after searching for one round, he didn\u2019t discover any signs of her\u2026Hmm\u2026 was she eaten? Or was she eaten? Or was she eaten?Or maybe she never came in?Wang Teng was extremely anxious as the same thought kept looping in his mind. At this moment, the fight between the two star beasts and the martial warriors intensified.Boom!The star beast blew Force out of its mouth and formed a round magma ball. The ball flew towards the wood element martial warrior at high speed.Honestly, this wood element martial warrior was restrained by the fire element star beast.He was exhausted during the battle just now, so when the star beast released a powerful move, he was taken by surprise.\u201cMove!\u201dThe earth element martial warrior at the side shouted.The wood martial warrior was guarding against the Force attacks from the star beasts too. He was a little flustered, but he managed to evade the attack precariously.The ball of magma slammed into the rock wall behind him. Its destructive ability was astonishing, as evident from the collapsed rock wall.A huge piece of rock smashed into the back of the wood element martial warrior, bringing with it a frightening impact force.Splurt!The wood element martial warrior vomited a mouthful of blood. His body flew out, and he almost fell into the magma pit in the middle.\u201cLing Dong!\u201dThe earth element martial warrior screamed in fear.\u201cI\u2019m fine. The volcano salamander\u2019s magma burst is extremely powerful. Be careful!\u201d The wood element martial warrior, Ling Dong, wiped the traces of blood off the corner of his lips as he reminded his companions.He struggled to get up from the ground, but he seemed to be heavily injured.Wood Force*1Fire Force*2Oh my god, they dropped Force attributes.\u00a0Wang Teng\u2019s gaze was suddenly fixed on the ground. The impact just now had caused two Force attributes to drop.\u201cWa!\u201dThe volcano salamander noticed that Ling Dong was seriously injured and wanted to kill him first. It moved its huge body and tumbled over.Ling Dong\u2019s expression changed.The earth element martial warrior dashed to Ling Dong\u2019s side. Earth Force exuded out of his body, forming a shield in front of him. He forcefully blocked the volcano salamander\u2019s collision again and again. But, the two of them still flew out because of the impact.\u201cHurry up and leave. These two volcano salamanders are too difficult to deal with. We\u2019ll retreat first.\u201dThe water element martial warrior, who was fighting with another volcano salamander alone, was stronger than the other two. However, the situation was awful, so he rushed towards his comrades.\u201cLeave!\u201dThe earth element martial warrior held Ling Dong up and retreated towards the entrance of the cave.However\u2026Do you think you can come whenever you want and leave when you feel like it? Have you asked me for my opinion?The volcano salamander\u2019s thinking was apparent. It blocked the entrance with its huge body, cutting off the only path of retreat for the three martial warriors.\u201cWa\u2026\u201dThe other volcano salamander attacked them from the back. These two volcano salamanders actually knew how to cooperate with each other.Wang Teng was astounded when he saw this scene.He retracted the aura on his body to prevent the two star beasts from noticing him. At the same time, he felt worried for the three martial warriors. They were in extreme danger!\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe water element martial warrior in the lead couldn\u2019t help but curse. He looked at the two volcano salamanders closing in on them with an ugly expression.\u201cJi Quan, what should we do?\u201dThe other two martial warriors looked at him.\u201cWhat else can we do? We can only fight with our lives!\u201cI hope that the other people will arrive soon. If they come slightly later, they can only bury our corpses for us.\u201dJi Quan\u2019s face turned cold as he said fiercely.\u201cLet\u2019s do it!\u201d Ling Dong and the other earth element martial warrior gritted their teeth.As martial warriors, they had seen all kinds of dangers. They just had to give it their best and fight with their lives.\u00a0If we live, we live. If we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t!The three of them were already prepared to die. They remained alert and combat-ready, seeking the right opportunity to attack.\u201cHowl!\u201dAt this moment, the volcano salamander blocking the entrance suddenly let out a howl of pain.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They stared at the volcano salamander that was howling in pain with stunned faces.The other volcano salamander also looked at its companion in astonishment.\u00a0Brother, are you alright?\u201cWhy are you staring into space? Attack!\u201d A voice suddenly came from behind the wailing volcano salamander.The three martial warriors were elated when they heard the voice. It explained the painful expression on the volcano salamander\u2019s face.The reinforcements were here!The giant body of the volcano salamander was blocking the entrance, so they couldn\u2019t see Wang Teng\u2019s figure. That didn\u2019t prevent them from reacting, though. They quickly executed their battle techniques and teamed up to attack the other volcano salamander.The volcano salamander blocking the entrance twisted its body, as if it was trying to break free from something.Your spirit is quite strong!Wang Teng held a sharp ice spike in his hand and viciously stabbed it into the body of the volcano salamander. He didn\u2019t expect the volcano salamander to be able to struggle so violently. He was slightly surprised.But, I won\u2019t let you escape!He leaped up and landed on the body of the volcano salamander. He smashed his fist at the star beast below him.Phantom Ice Fist!Splurt!The bone-piercing chill on his fist felt like a sharp ice spike. It cracked the scale armor on the volcano salamander\u2019s body and penetrated right into the body.Howl!The volcano salamander howled in agony and started to struggle even more frantically. It swung its body as it attempted to throw Wang Teng off.It spurted magma balls out of its mouth and thrashed around the cave. But, it wasn\u2019t able to hit Wang Teng at all. All its attacks landed on the cliff walls around it.Boom, boom, boom!Large rocks rolled down!The entire cave was shaking.The three martial warriors\u2019 expressions changed when they saw this astonishing destructive power.They evaded the falling stones and increased their attack on the volcano salamander in front of them.Wang Teng stood on the back of the volcano salamander. He was like a skiff in flood, getting tossed and turned all over.He grabbed the horn on the volcano salamander\u2019s head tightly to remain on the back. His other hand wasn\u2019t idle either. He pushed it into the body of the star beast and grabbed its heart.Splat!With a forceful squeeze, the soft organ squashed like a watermelon. Then, the salamander\u2019s body froze, and it lost all its strength.Boom!Wang Teng jumped down from the body of the volcano salamander and allowed the huge corpse to smash into the ground. A loud thud shook the listeners.He had killed it!Wang Teng heaved a sigh of relief.As expected, star beasts weren\u2019t easy to deal with. If he didn\u2019t rely on his ice element that had a natural advantage over the fire element and his sneak attack, he might not have been able to kill it so easily.He looked at his attribute panel and smiled bitterly.Blank Attribute: 27He had managed to earn 81 points of blank attributes by killing mutated beasts in the combat assessment. Now, there were only 27 points left.At first, he planned to use the blank attributes on the attributes that were harder to earn, such as Spirit, Enlightenment, or Spiritual Sight. But\u2026In order to defeat the volcano salamander, he had to inject 54 blank attributes to his ice Force, allowing it to jump directly from 16 to 70 points.70/100 (one-star soldier level martial warrior)!Now, his ice Force exceeded his fire Force by a huge gap.He hoped that he would have some gains from the killing.His gaze landed on the corpse of the volcano salamander.Fire Force*3Strength*15When he saw Fire Force*3, his eyes lit up.Not bad.After picking them up, he looked at the battle circle of the three martial warriors. The trio worked together while the volcano salamander fought alone. It kept retreating, but very soon, it met its doom.With a loud bang, the huge body collapsed, stirring a cloud of dust. The three of them sighed in relief.They turned around and saw the volcano salamander that had already been killed by Wang Teng. They were stunned.That was fast!Then, their gaze landed on Wang Teng\u2026?The three of them looked at each other. What was this? Where did this high school student come from? Where were the reinforcements?\u201cAre you an examinee?\u201d Ji Quan asked in shock, \u201cDid you kill the star beast!?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dWang Teng walked over and pretended to observe the volcano salamander. However, he was actually picking up the dropped attribute bubbles.Wood Force*1Fire Force*2These two were the ones that were dropped first.Wood Force*1Water Force*1Fire Force*1Earth Force*2Water Force*1Water Force*1Fire Force*1Wood Force*1\u2026These attribute bubbles were dropped when the three martial warriors were in a heated battle with the volcano salamander.Wang Teng almost burst out laughing in glee. There were so many Force attributes. Wood, water, fire, and earth, all four elements were present. Out of the four, he didn\u2019t have two elements before.Now, he had six different elements of Force on his attributes panel. They were fire, ice, wood, earth, water, and poison.He wondered if he would be able to summon the chaos dragon after he collected all the attributes and realize his dream.1\u201cYou really killed it!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a martial warrior!\u201dThe three of them looked at Wang Teng in disbelief. They couldn\u2019t believe their eyes.Wang Teng was too lazy to reply to them. He walked to the edge of the pit in the middle of the cave and looked down.\u201cHave y\u2019all seen a lady here?\u201d\u201cLady? Nope!\u201d The three martial warriors were still in shock. When they heard Wang Teng\u2019s question, they exchanged glances with one another and shook their heads.Maybe she didn\u2019t come down. I was thinking too much. Based on her personality, she won\u2019t overestimate her ability.\u00a0Wang Teng thought to himself.\u201cSo the volcano wasn\u2019t erupting. Were these two star beasts up to mischief?\u201d he pointed at the two star beasts and asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right. This extinct volcano shows no sign of \u2018reviving.\u2019 These two star beasts probably stirred up the fire Force at the bottom of this volcano, causing the ground to shake. Of course, if we hadn\u2019t stopped the star beasts in time, there was still a chance that the volcano would have erupted,\u201d Ji Quan explained.Wang Teng nodded. Since he didn\u2019t find Lin Chuhan, he wanted to leave.\u201cIf there isn\u2019t anything else, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201d Ji Quan shouted.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Wang Teng stopped unconsciously.\u201cYou were the one who killed this volcano salamander. The skin on its body and its horns are good materials for making weapons. They are quite expensive. There\u2019s even a chance that there\u2019s a fire element star core in its body. If so, the price will shoot up. According to the rules between martial warriors, it\u2019s yours,\u201d Ji Quan said.\u201cEven if I killed it during my actual combat assessment?\u201d Wang Teng knew this rule. He also knew that the price of star beasts was much higher than mutated beasts.But, he was in the midst of his actual combat assessment, so he chose to give it up unwillingly. He didn\u2019t expect Ji Quan to raise it on his own.\u201cStar beast is not part of the examination. Also, if you hadn\u2019t helped us, the three of us would probably be dead by now. One star beast isn\u2019t much.\u201dJi Quan smiled and replied.The other two martial warriors nodded. They agreed with his words.Also, there was one thing they didn\u2019t say out loud. The young man in front of them was an examinee. He became a martial warrior at such a young age. There was a bright and promising future in front of him.Using a star beast to exchange for his good impression, there was no loss, only gains.Wang Teng nodded. He didn\u2019t say anything and just stabbed the battle sword in his hand into the corpse of the volcano salamander. He lifted his sword slightly, and a fiery red round-shaped object full of bumps and hollows rolled out.\u201cStar core!\u201d The three martial warriors were instantly dumbstruck.Was he so lucky?Although there was a chance that there would be a star core inside, the probability wasn\u2019t high. Sometimes, they might not be able to find one star core even after killing more than ten star beasts.But, look at Wang Teng!He killed one star beast and got one star core. This possibility was atrocious!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: Snatch!When the three martial warriors saw Wang Teng digging up a star core from the corpse of this volcano salamander, they were flabbergasted. They hurriedly went to the one they killed and cut opened its stomach\u2026There was nothing!They searched for a long time, but they didn\u2019t find anything!Was this the difference between a lucky and an unlucky person?Wang Teng looked at the trio and suddenly felt that their faces were a bit black.Ji Quan took a deep breath and looked at the star core in Wang Teng\u2019s hands. He was slightly jealous as he said, \u201cWang Teng, you are really lucky. There are only two star beasts, and one of them actually had a star core. You even killed the one that had it.\u201d\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m more handsome,\u201d Wang Teng replied casually.The three martial warriors: \u2026We\u2019re sorry that we\u2019re ugly!The three martial warriors felt as though a horde of horses had stampeded on their hearts and trampled on their small weak souls.\u201cIt looks like you have already resolved the issue!\u201dAt this moment, a voice came from the entrance of the cave. A valiant-looking man walked out the next instant.Wang Teng turned around and met the man\u2019s gaze. A powerful aura surged towards him, leaving him dumbstruck.What a terrifying aura. Who is this person?The moment this thought appeared in Wang Teng\u2019s mind, the three martial warriors ran forward instantly and bowed in respect.\u201cGovernor!\u201dGovernor!Wang Teng was shocked senseless when he heard this address. A stunned expression was written all over his face.There was only one person in the entire Donghai who had the right to use this address.The governor of Donghai!The most powerful person in the entire Donghai.If Director He was a tycoon, the governor of Donghai was the tycoon among the tycoons.Wang Teng had lived twice. If he hadn\u2019t practiced martial arts the second time, based on his original status and identity, he would never be able to meet someone at this level. However, he met him now, and the person was just in front of his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve seen your performance during the actual combat assessment. Not bad,\u201d Governor Jiang suddenly spoke to Wang Teng.Wang Teng didn\u2019t expect the guy would compliment him. His heart skipped a beat, and he hurriedly replied in a modest tone, \u201cYou\u2019re speaking too highly of me.\u201dGovernor Jiang nodded. He didn\u2019t continue and turned to look at the three martial warriors. \u201cYou killed these two star beasts in time and prevented the volcano from erupting. You will gain merit!\u201dThe three martial warriors were elated. They exchanged glances with one another. Just as they were about to say something, hurried footsteps were heard outside the cave.Director He, Fu Tiandao, and Qin Hanxuan had arrived.\u201cThe examinees have all been sent to safe places. However, there are many deaths,\u201d Director He walked beside Governor Jiang and whispered to him.Governor Jiang nodded expressionlessly.Director He immediately felt pressured. Large beads of perspiration filled up his forehead.He bent down slightly and saw Wang Teng and the two star beasts\u2019 corpses from the corner of his eyes. A glimmer appeared in his eyes.\u201cJi Quan, you killed these two star beasts?\u201d Director He suddenly asked the three martial warriors.Ji Quan smiled bitterly and replied, \u201cGovernor, Director He, we only killed one of the two star beasts. The other star beast was killed by Wang Teng here. Without his help, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to complete this mission.\u201dThe second he finished speaking, everyone was shocked. Their gazes immediately landed on Wang Teng, who was standing at the side, in unplanned unison.Director He had somewhat predicted this situation.He had a clearer understanding of the three martial warriors\u2019 abilities, so he knew that it was difficult for them to tackle two star beasts at once, much less kill them in such a short period.Thus, there was a high possibility that someone had lent them a hand!Besides this little young man, Wang Teng, who hid his true capabilities, he couldn\u2019t think of anyone else.However, he was still astounded and suspicious when he heard that Wang Teng had killed a star beast alone.He wasn\u2019t the only one. Even Fu Tiandao and Qin Hanxuan, who already knew that Wang Teng was a martial warrior, found it surprising.Becoming a martial warrior at his age was impressive enough. If he also possessed the battle prowess to kill a star beast alone, this fellow must be a monster!The two principles of Bailian Martial House and Leiting Martial House were also in disbelief. They stared at the three martial warriors and asked, \u201cAre you sure that this fellow killed the star beast alone?\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Governor Jiang frowned and questioned them too.Martial warrior!And he was able to kill a star beast!Was there really such an amazing and extremely talented genius in this batch of examinees?\u201cJi Quan, you need to be responsible for your words. Don\u2019t compromise your own interest,\u201d Director He reminded him.Although he wished that Wang Teng was able to make a stellar performance and gain Governor Jiang\u2019s attention, he didn\u2019t want the three martial warriors to lie to them.Ji Quan gave a bitter smile and replied, \u201cGovernor Jiang, Director He, how can we lie to you about this? If you don\u2019t believe us, you can take a look at the wound on the volcano salamander\u2019s corpse. It died not long ago, so traces of Force should still be left. The Force on it is different from ours.\u201dGovernor Jiang and the other leaders came beside the corpse. They observed and felt the wound. Soon, they made their judgment.\u201cIndeed, there\u2019s only one Force!\u201d\u201cBut, this Force is\u2026\u201d\u201cIce Force!\u201dThe next moment, Wang Teng felt the intense gazes of multiple powerful bosses landing on his body. An uncomfortable feeling engulfed his entire body, and he shuddered.Ice Force was a special mutated Force outside the five main element Forces, metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.In summary, these five basic Forces were more commonly seen while the other mutated Forces were harder to find. These mutated Forces were powerful, and they also came with special effects.The ability to possess a mutated Force was a sign of his talent. Other people could only be envious.Governor Jiang suddenly burst out laughing. He patted Wang Teng\u2019s shoulder heavily and said, \u201cYou\u2019re good. You\u2019re very good.\u201cOur Donghai will definitely shine this year. Let\u2019s see who dares to look down on us!\u201dThe other leaders were elated too. All of them started chiming in.\u201cThe governor is right. Donghai will definitely make its mark this year!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We\u2019ll show the other large provinces that as a coastal special economic zone, our Donghai is an important city too. We will not lose to them!\u201d\u201cGood boy, are you interested in joining my Leiting Martial House? You can make any request!\u201d\u201cJiang Hong, where is your face? Wang Teng, why don\u2019t you come to my Bailian Martial House? Whatever Leiting Martial House can give you, we can give you more.\u201d\u201cYou two bastards, Wang Teng is a member of my Jixin Martial House. How can you be so shameless and snatch my man right in front of me?\u201dFu Tiandao was jumping around in anger.These two people were so shameless! How could they be so forthright! Were they looking down on him?\u201cI\u2019ve asked my men to check. Wang Teng is just a martial disciple student at your Jixin Martial House. He isn\u2019t an official martial warrior member. He has the right to choose.\u201d Gu Hefei sneered.\u201cThat\u2019s right. He can choose the person who gives him the most benefits. That\u2019s absolutely normal!\u201d Jiang Hong crossed his arms in front of his chest and said calmly.\u201cOh my temper, are you looking for a fight? Come, come, come\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone gave a wry smile. Even Governor Jiang felt his head hurt.\u201cAlright, you all are almost forty years old. Why are you still acting like children snatching a toy? Don\u2019t you find it embarrassing?\u201dOnly Governor Jiang was able to reprimand them.The three principals turned silent at once. However, they continued glaring at one another. They would probably fight after they went back to solve this matter.Wang Teng was in a daze right from the beginning.Why are you snatching me without asking my opinion?Of course, his motive was reached. He had displayed the ability of a martial warrior, and the effect was much better than predicted.Thinking about this, he winked at Director He.Director He remained stern and righteous, as if he didn\u2019t see anything.This was a drama king too!Erm\u2026 why did he say \u2018too\u2019?\u201cSince this issue is solved, let\u2019s go down the mountain. We need to inform the examinees\u2019 parents about what happened during the martial arts exam this time.\u201d Governor Jiang\u2019s tone was a little heavy.Director He\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good either. As the head of the Ministry of Education, he could hardly escape the blame.Fortunately, there was Wang Teng, his life-saver, this year. If not, he wouldn\u2019t be able to keep his position.As for his promotion, there was probably no chance of it anymore!Director He wasn\u2019t in a good mood as he thought of all these.Everyone prepared to leave the mountain.\u201cWang Teng, it\u2019s quite troublesome to deal with the other materials on the body of the star beast. If you trust us, we can help you to take care of them and sell them for you. After that, we will transfer the money to you. What do you think?\u201d asked Ji Quan.The three of them became even more enthusiastic towards Wang Teng after seeing the leaders\u2019 attitude.As expected, this fellow had a huge potential!They could just do it conveniently, so why not!We are suck-ups? Are you kidding? We are martial warriors! Are we that kind of person?\u201cAlright, sorry to trouble you.\u201d Wang Teng nodded. He didn\u2019t reject their help. It would save him the effort of looking for channels to sell the items.He wasn\u2019t worried that the three martial warriors would play small tricks. The star core was already in his hands, and there were so many leaders watching. He felt that they wouldn\u2019t be that stupid to dupe him.Wang Teng told them his bank account number, then followed Governor Jiang and the other leaders down the mountain.Along the way, he saw many mutated beasts\u2019 corpses, as well as the bodies of examinees. The staff at the exam venue were dealing with the aftermath of the accident and carrying the bodies down the mountain.Wang Teng\u2019s heart felt heavy. He felt worried for Lin Chuhan once again.That pile of meat isn\u2019t her, right?Lin Chuhan was so weak. What if she fell into the beast tide? She won\u2019t have any chance of surviving.This is bad. This is very bad\u2026He carried all sorts of bad thoughts in his mind as he returned to the camping ground. The examinees were all sitting on the ground, not caring about their image at all. Bloodstains could be seen on everyone\u2019s body, and they looked extremely disheveled.Some examinees were injured heavily, so there was medical staff attending to them.Sobs could be heard everywhere!The brutality of the martial arts exam this time had a great impact on the examinees. They suffered what they shouldn\u2019t be suffering at this age!Wang Teng attracted everyone\u2019s attention when he came back with Governor Jiang and the other leaders. But, they didn\u2019t have the mood to care about him at this moment. They just glanced at him and then retracted their gazes.\u201cWang Teng!\u201d A voice filled with pleasant surprise suddenly sounded amidst the crowd.Wang Teng turned around and saw Lin Chuhan waving at him.\u201cLeaders, my friend is calling me. I will head over there,\u201d Wang Teng said to Governor Jiang and the others beside him.\u201cGo ahead!\u201dThese old foxes immediately gave him a knowing look as they smiled and replied to him.Wang Teng felt a headache coming on.He couldn\u2019t bear the gazes these big guns were throwing at him.Can you respect your identity as leaders? Do you have to be so gossipy?1Wang Teng walked towards Lin Chuhan helplessly. Looking at the pretty face, he finally heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, nothing terrible had happened.He couldn\u2019t even explain the feeling of relief he was experiencing now.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Lin Chuhan asked him in a hurry the moment he came close.\u201cHow can I not be alright?\u201d Wang Teng replied casually.\u201cYoung Master Wang!\u201d Yang Jian was sitting beside them. His leg was injured and was bandaged, making it twice as thick as normal. He was unable to stand up.\u201cWhat happened to your leg?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cI was scratched by a mutated beast. Fortunately, the principal of Bailian Martial House arrived in time. If not, I would have died there.\u201dYang Jian still had lingering scares. Then, he said with slight excitement, \u201cYou didn\u2019t see how impressive Principal Gu of Bailian Martial House was. He used one move, just one, and the mutated beasts around us were annihilated! There were more than ten mutated beasts!\u201dWang Teng knew that this fellow was fine when he saw his reaction. If he wasn\u2019t, he would be crying for his mom now.He turned and asked Lin Chuhan, \u201cDid you drop something?\u201d\u201cDid I drop something? I don\u2019t think so!\u201d Lin Chuhan shook her head.\u201cCheck if your examination identity card is still there.\u201dWang Teng was speechless. Lin Chuhan hadn\u2019t realized that she had lost her examination identity card even until now.Lin Chuhan hurriedly searched her body. Then, she exclaimed frantically, \u201cOh shit, my identity card is really gone!\u201d\u201cTake it!\u201d Wang Teng took out Lin Chuhan\u2019s examination identity card from his pocket and passed it to her. He shook his head and continued, \u201cYou have my respect. You even lost your examination identity card.\u201d\u201cThank you! Thank you so much!\u201d Lin Chuhan heaved a sigh of relief. \u201cWhere did you find it?\u201d\u201cYeah, about that, what were you doing at the top of the volcano? I found this identity card there. Don\u2019t you know that it\u2019s very dangerous?\u201d Wang Teng was furious.\u201cWho says that it\u2019s dangerous there? If the accident hadn\u2019t happened, it was just an extinct volcano. But, for some reason, I noticed that there were no mutated beasts at the peak of the volcano. It was very safe,\u201d Lin Chuhan refuted with her own logic.\u201cThere is no mutated beast there?\u201d It was Wang Teng\u2019s turn to be shocked now.\u201cThat\u2019s right. After I killed five mutated beasts, I realized that it\u2019s very safe at the peak, so I planned to stay there until the exam ended. I didn\u2019t expect an accident to happen. Fortunately, I followed behind the beast tide. I managed to come back safely,\u201d said Lin Chuhan.2The ordinary mutated beasts probably didn\u2019t dare to go to the peak because of the fire element star beasts. This was Wang Teng\u2019s guess.\u201cWait, you killed five mutated beasts!\u201d He suddenly regained his senses and exclaimed in surprise.\u201cWhy can\u2019t I kill mutated beasts?\u201d Lin Chuhan glared at Wang Teng, feeling that he was belittling her.\u201cThat\u2019s not it. I was just a little stunned because you\u2019re so weak,\u201d Wang Teng teased her.\u201cHmph!\u201d Lin Chuhan scoffed. She said unhappily, \u201cI may not be as strong as you, but I\u2019m smarter.\u201d\u201cAlright, alright, you\u2019re smart. So, how did you kill the five mutated beasts? Smart Ms. Lin, please tell me your glorious deeds,\u201d Wang Teng asked with interest as he crossed his legs and sat down.\u201cWhat do you mean by Smart Ms. Lin? Don\u2019t anyhow give me a nickname.\u201d Lin Chuhan rolled her eyes. But, she still happily told him how she killed the mutated beasts.Wang Teng\u2019s mouth fell wide open after he heard her story. He felt that Lin Chuhan was the real master of being sly.He didn\u2019t expect this righteous person to use such terrifying and chilly means.After Lin Chuhan entered the primary forest, she utilized what she learned in the \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 thoroughly and flexibly.For instance, she wiped her body with a pungent tree juice so that the mutated beasts wouldn\u2019t be able to smell her. Then, she spent three hours looking for a dead mutated beast and hid the poisonous herbs she found in the forest in the mutated beast\u2019s body. She waited for the beast to be eaten.\u2026It was best not to forget that regular examinees weren\u2019t able to think of this method!Also, whether it was recognizing the useful herbs, looking for mutated beasts that died naturally, or waiting for mutated beasts to fall into the trap, all these required a huge amount of time. Without ample patience, one would not be able to do it.Of course, there was an element of luck involved. However, without prior knowledge, strong patience, and the preparations beforehand, luck wouldn\u2019t befall her.Her patience and calculation were impressive.His mother was right. The prettier a lady, the more dangerous she was!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt first glance, Lin Chuhan\u2019s operation didn\u2019t seem like much, but if you thought about it carefully, it was awe-inspiring.Among all the examinees here, even counting generously, not more than five people could come up with this method.This was a safe estimate. It could even be said that Lin Chuhan was the only person who thought of this idea!But\u2026 the things she did to win!Tsk, it feels a little creepy!Lin Chuhan was stunned when she noticed Wang Teng\u2019s gaze turning strange as he looked at her. A second later, she understood what he was thinking.This bastard is always laughing at me!All I wanted was to pass the exam!Don\u2019t you know how smelly the tree juice was when I wiped it on my body? When I was waiting for the mutated beasts to fall into the trap, I got stung by bugs again and again\u2026She felt sad just thinking about it!She glared at Wang Teng furiously.\u201cNo matter what, you will definitely pass the martial arts exam this time. Let me congratulate you first,\u201d Wang Teng coughed awkwardly and said.A hint of happiness appeared on Lin Chuhan\u2019s face. But, she still felt worried. \u201cI still hope that I can get selected by top universities. However, my actual combat assessment result isn\u2019t good. I hope that my papers will be better.\u201dSome top universities emphasized a lot on the result of the written exams. They would admit outstanding students especially, even if their actual combat assessment result was a little lacking.\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Wang Teng consoled her.\u201cHey, do you think that the results this year will be counted after the accident?\u201d Yang Jian suddenly asked.Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan were stunned for a moment when they heard this.1Wang Teng looked at the sky. It was almost dawn. The sky was already turning white, and the first ray of sunlight could be seen on the horizon.\u201cWhen the beast tide appeared, it should be less than an hour until the end of the exam. Its impact on the result shouldn\u2019t be too great. Most likely, they won\u2019t cancel the results.\u201d\u201cAlso, have you forgotten what the purpose of the actual combat assessment is?\u201d Wang Teng asked in a meaningful tone.\u201cIn actual combat, any accidents are assessments!\u201d Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian said simultaneously.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Wang Teng nodded. \u201cI think the performance of the students during the beast tide would also be considered. Thus, those examinees that didn\u2019t kill five mutated beasts but performed well might have a chance.\u201d\u201cThat would be great. I only killed four mutated beasts. When the beast tide happened, I was fighting with my fifth mutated beast. Just as I was about to kill it, it ran away. However, I saved an examinee after that and even got praised by the principal of Bailian Martial House.\u201dYang Jian was still worried. After all, these were just their guesses. What if the examiners were fixated on the numbers?That would be unlucky for them!There was nothing Yang Jian and the other unfortunate examinees could do.Wang Teng and Lin Chuhan stood in silent tribute for a few seconds to express their pity.\u201cOh, right. How did they take care of the beast tide?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cWhat else can they do? They used the cannons and fired at the mutated beasts until the ones behind got so frightened that they didn\u2019t dare to come down anymore,\u201d Lin Chuhan explained.\u201cThere\u2019s a limited number of mutated beasts on the island, so this was just a small-sized beast tide. Once the cannons are put into action, all demons and devils have to retreat!\u201d Yang Jian smiled and said.Wang Teng chatted casually with his friends.On the other side, Governor Jiang and the other leaders went to the central control room and held a meeting for an entire hour. After that, they walked out and came to the platform in the center of the camping ground.Governor Jiang placed his hand behind his back and looked at the depressed examinees below. He opened his mouth and said, \u201cEveryone, I\u2019m the governor of Donghai.\u201dThe governor of Donghai!Everyone looked up when his voice rang out. They stared at him absent-mindedly.Then, an uproar occurred.\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s the governor of Donghai!\u201d\u201cOur governor came personally?\u201d\u201cDid he come to see our actual combat assessment?\u201d\u201cGovernor, how will the result be calculated? Many of us missed the criteria to pass by just a little.\u201d\u201cGovernor, many of our classmates died in the beast tide. It\u2019s really sad\u2026\u201d\u2026The examinees started shouting continuously, as though they had found a pillar of support. Governor Jiang didn\u2019t stop them and allowed them to vent their emotions. He only continued speaking after the voices died down.\u201cIt\u2019s our responsibility and fault that such an accident happened. We will compensate all the examinees that died in this unfortunate incident.1\u201cHowever, you have to remember one thing. The martial warrior path is a thousand times harder and tougher than this. You might have only seen the glamorous and powerful side of martial warriors, but you don\u2019t know the amount of blood and sweat they had to pay. The world of martial warriors is cruel and bloody.\u201cYour performance during the beast tide will be calculated in your results. People who performed well will have additional points, and those that performed badly can only rely on the number of mutated beasts killed for their final result.\u201cNow, let me announce the official ending of the actual combat assessment!\u201dThe instant he finished speaking, a commotion exploded among the examinees.Was the world of martial warriors really so brutal?Before the exam, they had heard of the brutality and viciousness of the martial warriors\u2019 world. After experiencing the beast tide, they realized that what they heard didn\u2019t hold a candle to the real thing.And, this was just the start\u2026Thinking about this, the expressions on many examinees\u2019 faces changed slightly. Some of them had decided to take part in the martial arts exam because they were dazzled by the fame and glamor. They hoped to have good prospects in the future.Now, the dangers of the martial warrior world changed their perception entirely. They were considering whether they wanted to continue walking on this path.There was no free lunch in the world. If you were given a certain position, you needed to bear the relevant responsibility and risk.Of course, to the examinees that were firm and resolute in becoming martial warriors, Governor Jiang\u2019s speech instilled them with even more confidence.Truly powerful people wouldn\u2019t perform badly during the beast tide. Thus, including the performance during the beast tide was beneficial to them.People like Yang Jian, who were on the brink of getting accepted, were happy with this announcement. At least they would be able to get into the martial arts course.As for danger\u2026Looking at how happy Yang Jian was even after getting injured, it was easy to tell that he didn\u2019t take it to heart.\u201cAll examinees, please prepare to return!\u201dA voice came from the platform. It was the officer in charge of the exam. Governor Jiang had already left.The examinees were all covered in blood. Some of it was their own, while some belonged to the mutated beasts. They queued up and boarded the Force floating airship parked on the empty field at the side.A few examinees were in a coma, so they were carried onboard. Others walked up with the help of their friends.\u201cThe\u2026 the dead examinees!\u201dAn examinee suddenly pointed to the stretchers covered with white clothes in front of them. They were carried into the back of the Force floating airship. Normally, that was where the luggage would go.The examinees instantly stood up straight and saluted with their gazes. They looked at the bloodstained white clothes. A dark and oppressive atmosphere pervaded the air around them.They were peers, but these people had reached the end of their lives. The same thought appeared in the examinees\u2019 hearts. They felt complicated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: Are Y\u2019all Getting Arrogant Or Am I Too Weak To Hold A Blade?The atmosphere on the Force floating airship was a little heavy, but gradually, everyone started to discuss the examination result.There were many examinees gathered around the advanced stage martial disciples. They asked them how many mutated beasts they had killed and then gasped in exclamation and admiration.\u201cYan Peng, you actually killed 13 mutated beasts, including three high-level and four middle-level!\u201dOne of the female students looked at the cold and cool-looking young man in a worshipping manner.The young man\u2019s features were well defined, and he was very handsome. However, he exuded a cold and distant aura.Yet, it was even more fatal to the ladies.His ability complemented his looks, so he was highly popular among the ladies.In Huiying High School, Yan Peng had almost been a male idol among the students. As compared to Wang Teng, who was a bottom-feeder, cocky, and playful, the distance between them was equivalent to the distance between the earth and the sky.\u201cTsk, that bunch of bootlickers.\u201d Yang Jian pouted in disdain. Then, he smiled and leaned towards Wang Teng. \u201cYoung Master Wang, tell me your results and let me flatter you too.\u201dLin Chuhan rolled her eyes. She felt so disgusted that goosebumps appeared all over her body. Yang Jian was so shameless!\u201cGet off!\u201dWang Teng glared at Yang Jian speechlessly.\u201cHonestly, Young Master Wang, how many mutated beasts did you kill? You must have killed more than Yan Peng.\u201d Yan Peng sniggered. He was afraid Wang Teng wouldn\u2019t tell him, so he dragged Lin Chuhan onto his boat. \u201cClass Monitor Lin probably wants to hear it too. Class monitor, am I right?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d Lin Chuhan tilted her head and gave a look of contempt.Wang Teng shook his head. He felt that it was nothing worth hiding, so he said directly, \u201c29. 19 of them are high-level mutated beasts, and 10 are middle-level.\u201dYang Jian\u2019s jaws dropped. He stammered, \u201cYoung, Young Master Wang, are you kidding me?\u201dLin Chuhan was stunned for a few seconds before she said, \u201cWang Teng, don\u2019t boast all the time. We know that you\u2019re strong, but you aren\u2019t that strong.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s right,\u201d Yang Jian agreed and nodded.That was 29 mutated beasts, including 19 high-level mutated beasts. How was that possible!They couldn\u2019t believe that Wang Teng was so frighteningly powerful even if they cracked their heads!\u201cLately, I feel that no matter how much truth I say, there are always people who don\u2019t believe me,\u201d Wang Teng said bitterly.\u201cSeriously!\u201d The two still refused to believe him.Wang Teng didn\u2019t explain himself. His result wouldn\u2019t change, and that was all that mattered.Also, if they knew that he even killed a star beast along with all the high-level mutated beasts, they might explode on the spot.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dAt this moment, a peal of laughter sounded suddenly beside them.A young man wearing the Huiying High School uniform was laughing until he bent his back. When he saw everyone shifting their attention to him, he barely restrained his laughter and said, \u201cDid you know what I heard just now?\u201d\u201cThis Wang Teng from No. 1 High School says that he actually killed 29 mutated beasts, including 19 high-level ones. Don\u2019t you think that this is funny?\u201cEven if you want to boast, this isn\u2019t how you do it!\u201dThe other examinees started laughing when they heard his words.\u201cHaha, this is just too much!\u201d\u201cAlthough Wang Teng is an extreme martial disciple, it\u2019s impossible for him to kill 29 mutated beasts.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even talk about high-level mutated beasts. Killing 19 middle-level mutated beasts is tough enough!\u201d\u2026Wang Teng was stunned.He was just chatting casually with Lin Chuhan and Yang Jian. Why did this stupid fellow come out to proclaim his presence?Had he been too kind recently, so anyone dared to bully him?\u201cAre you Wang Teng?\u201d Yan Peng walked over at this instant. \u201cI heard that you are an extreme martial disciple and have almost wanted to have a duel with you. However, looking at how nonsensical you are, your true ability must not be as strong as what they said. I have no interest in dueling with you anymore.\u201d\u201cHmph, I didn\u2019t expect the extreme martial disciple to be like this.\u201d Another ordinary-looking young man walked over. He had a birthmark on his face, so he was easily recognized. He was the advanced stage martial disciple, Dong Fei, from Shiyan High School.\u201cWang Teng, we represent No. 1 High School when we come out. I hope that you can conduct yourself with dignity.\u201d Zhou Wu and Dong Fei from No. 1 High School came forward together. They seemed to know each other. Zhou Wu said to Dong Fei, \u201cPlease excuse our schoolmate.\u201dThe other advanced stage martial disciples also huddled together. Some people didn\u2019t intend to interfere, so they just stood at the side and watched the show with interest.He Manrong frowned and said, \u201cZhou Wu, what you said is too much!\u201d\u201cManrong, how can you say that? We are all students from Donghai No. 1. We must pay attention to the reputation of our school. Also, I\u2019m just reminding Wang Teng.\u201dZhou Wu turned and looked at Wang Teng as he spoke. \u201cWang Teng, am I right?\u201d\u201cThis is ridiculous. We are just chatting casually. What does it have to do with you?\u201d Lin Chuhan stood up and said coldly. Flames of anger burned in her heart.\u201cThat\u2019s right. We were just talking among ourselves and didn\u2019t boast to anyone else. Why are y\u2019all so anxious? I think that you are just jealous that someone is more powerful than you, so you\u2019re finding trouble out of nothing.\u201d Yang Jian despised these people.Li Rongcheng was standing among the crowd. There was hidden enmity in his eyes, but there was also a tinge of fear.When he saw Yan Peng, Zhou Wu, and the other students provoking Wang Teng for no reason, he scoffed in his heart.\u00a0You must have never seen a devil before!Look at how happy you are. You must think that you can bully this extreme martial disciple, right? Yet, you don\u2019t know that you are digging your own grave. You will cry later\u2026Haha, things are getting more and more interesting!Li Rongcheng laughed crazily in his heart. He could see the other people getting tortured by Wang Teng just like him. This was a happy thing.Yan Peng and Dong Fei\u2019s eyes lit up when they saw Lin Chuhan\u2019s beautiful face. For a moment, they were a bit senseless.\u201cMs. Lin Chuhan, you misunderstood me. I\u2019m thinking from our school\u2019s perspective. We are all students from Donghai No. 1. We can\u2019t ruin the reputation of our school. We are not envious of Wang Teng.\u201d Zhou Wu gave a righteous look, as though he really cared about the school and was thinking of it only.He knew Lin Chuhan, but they didn\u2019t have any interaction in the past. Now, when he saw her, he started to get a little restless. The university entrance exam had ended. If he was able to get this beautiful lady to be his girlfriend, it would be great!\u201cYou\u2019re Lin Chuhan, right? I\u2019m Yan Peng from Huiying High School. I\u2019m an advanced stage martial disciple. Nice to meet you. I have no other intention regarding Wang Teng\u2019s issue. I just hope that he can restrain himself. After all, words can cause trouble,\u201d Yan Peng pretended that he was doing everything for Wang Teng\u2019s sake.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I didn\u2019t purposely offend Wang Teng. I just heard that there was an extreme martial disciple in Donghai No. 1, so I had high expectations for this person. I was a little disappointed when I heard him bragging just now. Oh right, I\u2019m Dong Fei from Shiyan High School. Ms. Lin Chuhan, can we exchange WeChat?\u201d Dong Fei was unwilling to back down.Lin Chuhan looked at these people and suddenly felt extremely disgusted by their faces.\u201cPfft\u2026\u201d Wang Teng couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud. He stood up and said, \u201cAre you all getting arrogant, or am I too weak to hold a blade?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: Ug~ Ly~ Ugly!After Wang Teng stood up, a terrifying aura surged out from his body and engulfed the three male students.Boom!His presence surged like the roaring waves in the sea.The three people\u2019s expressions changed immediately. They bent down, and their faces turned as white as paper.\u201cHow, how can he be so strong?\u201dThey were struck dumb from the shock. Astonishment and disbelief filled up their faces.They thought that this was the aura of an extreme martial disciple, but they didn\u2019t know that Wang Teng had already released the power of a martial warrior in his fit of anger.Tap, tap, tap.Wang Teng walked towards them, step by step. Every step he took, his aura increased a little. The pressure it caused on the three people increased correspondingly.Wang Teng stopped in front of Yan Peng.\u201cDid you say that you want to have a duel with me?\u201cWho gave you the confidence to say that?\u201cHave I ever agreed?\u201dThe series of questions caused Yan Peng to throw away his act of disguise. He was extremely furious, and his face turned red like a ripe peach.\u201cHmph, I didn\u2019t say anything, but you have already finished your solo performance. Who gave you the face to do it?\u201dThe last question infuriated Yan Peng so much that he almost vomited blood.Ever since he was a child, he had always been complimented and flattered by others. He had never been humiliated so blatantly by someone before. He wished he could find a hole on the ground and bury himself.Wang Teng ignored him. He walked directly in front of Dong Fei.\u201cDid you say that you were disappointed in me?\u201cWhat does your disappointment have to do with me? Why are you putting on a show in front of me?\u201cAlso, you are so ugly. Where did you get the guts to ask the lady for her WeChat? Did you bring a mirror when you came out? Don\u2019t you know how good-looking you are?\u201cAre you as handsome as me? Do you know that looks can earn you money? If we stand beside each other, I\u2019ll definitely be the one getting chosen by sugar mummies. You can only stay at the side. You\u2019re so ugly!\u201cCome, say it along with me. Ug~ Ly~ Ugly. Ug~ Ly~ Ugly. Do you understand it now?\u201dWang Teng got more furious as he spoke. How dare these bastards lay their eyes on Lin Chuhan. This was something he couldn\u2019t put up with.The students around them ran far away when they saw his aggressive posture. However, when they heard this sentence, they burst out laughing.On the other hand, Dong Fei\u2019s face had already turned green with anger. The birthmark on his face was his biggest pain.Normally, because of his ability, his classmates and friends didn\u2019t dare to say anything. However, they would judge him behind his back.Now, he got humiliated right in front of everyone. His lungs were almost going to explode in anger. He panted heavily.If he wasn\u2019t suppressed by Wang Teng\u2019s aura and he couldn\u2019t move, he would have pounced on Wang Teng and fought with him right then and there.Wang Teng continued to walk to Zhou Wu.Zhou Wu\u2019s expression changed. He instantly felt regretful. Why did he have to run off his darn mouth in front of Wang Teng?However, he didn\u2019t expect the strength of an extreme martial disciple to be so powerful.Was the difference between an extreme martial disciple and an advanced stage martial disciple so huge?\u201cZhou Wu, you have such a strong sense of righteousness.\u201d\u201cWang Teng, there must be some misunderstanding between us. Let\u2019s talk properly,\u201d Zhou Wu said with difficulty.\u201cTalk properly?\u201d As Wang Teng looked at him, a faint smile appeared at the corner of his lips. Then, his expression turned cold, and he continued, \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to talk properly with you!\u201dImmediately, he lifted his leg and swept it in front of him. Zhou Wu\u2019s body flew out like a sandbag in a straight line. He remained in the air for around six meters before slamming heavily on the ground.The examinees at the side dodged in surprise.\u201cCough, cough!\u201dBlood dripped down the corners of Zhou Wu\u2019s lips. He struggled and realized that he couldn\u2019t get up. He was dumbstruck.He\u2019s so powerful.How can he be so powerful?His heart was filled with doubts. Wang Teng\u2019s strength was beyond his wildest imagination. As an advanced stage martial disciple, he was nothing in front of Wang Teng.Wang Teng shifted his gaze away from Zhou Wu and scanned the crowd. He saw the figure hiding secretly at the back.\u201cThat person, come out. Yes, I\u2019m talking about you. Stop hiding. I saw you. Weren\u2019t you laughing really loudly a moment ago? Why are you being a coward now?\u201dThe examinees around the area where Wang Teng was pointing moved away. They were afraid of getting implicated. The examinee had nowhere to hide, so he could only walk forward.\u201cWang Teng\u2026\u201dBang!The moment he spoke, Wang Teng slapped his face.\u201cGet out!\u201d Wang Teng glared at him coldly. This was the examinee that had started everything. If not, none of this would have happened.The young man covered his red face. He didn\u2019t dare to say anything and just ran into the crowd while looking at the ground. No one knew which corner he went to hide.Wang Teng looked around him. In an instant, no one dared to exchange glances with him.For the rest of the journey, the three advanced martial disciples remained quiet. They had seen the difference between them and Wang Teng, so even if they were humiliated, they didn\u2019t dare to seek trouble with him.They could only hide their hatred towards him deep inside their hearts. They would take revenge if there was a chance in the future.The other examinees looked at Wang Teng from afar as they discussed in low tones. There was admiration as well as a hint of fear. But, they were full of respect for this young man.The three advanced stage martial disciples always acted arrogantly in front of them. They had offended many people.Just now, Wang Teng had suppressed the three of them alone. They didn\u2019t even dare to make a peep.It felt so good!There was only one word they could use to describe Wang Teng\u2014Impressive!\u2026The Force floating airship flew towards Donghai. The journey was peaceful throughout, and no commotion arose again.Not long after, the Force floating airship finally floated down gradually over the military district. It stopped on the vast plaza.The examinees disembarked the Force floating airship. Liu Wenshi stood in front of everyone and opened his mouth.\u201cYour exam results will be out in two days. You can use your examination identity number to search for your results on the internet. Then, you can make your application.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you what university you want to apply to. You can also check the cut-off point for the previous year as a reference. I hope that all of you can get into the university you want.\u201cAlright, get into the bus.\u201dThe examinees got onto the bus again. Liu Wenshi came to look for Wang Teng and brought him to a secluded corner.Wang Teng smiled when he saw Director He.\u201cDirector He, I thought that you forgot our agreement!\u201d\u201cLittle brat, who do you think I am?\u201d Director He glared at Wang Teng. Then, he said with lingering fears, \u201cSpeaking about it, I really have to thank you for this time. If not, I would have suffered badly.\u201d\u201cTake this. You deserve it.\u201dHe passed the box containing the star bone to Wang Teng.Wang Teng opened it directly and looked at the contents. He only kept it after confirming that there was nothing wrong with the item.\u201cDon\u2019t you trust me?\u201d Director He asked helplessly.\u201cIt\u2019s better to ensure that everything is fine in the beginning to prevent trouble in the future.\u201d Wang Teng smiled nonchalantly.\u201cMakes sense.\u201d Director He nodded. He was satisfied with Wang Teng\u2019s performance.\u201cDirector He, if there\u2019s nothing else, I will leave first. The other students must be waiting anxiously,\u201d Wang Teng said.\u201cGo ahead.\u201d Director He waved his hand.\u2026After Wang Teng parted with Director He, he boarded the bus with the rest of the examinees. The examinees were all eager to go home. At Liu Wenshi\u2019s command, the bus fleet headed towards the city.They were going home.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Something HappenedWhen Wang Teng reached home, he noticed that his house was locked. He had no choice but to take out his keys and open the door.He took off his shoes and shouted towards the second floor.\u201cMom, I\u2019m back.\u201dHowever, the villa was empty. It was extremely quiet. No one was present.No one\u2019s home?Wang Teng walked up the stairs and noticed that the house was empty. Instantly. he found it strange.Have they gone out to play?Wang Teng shook his head helplessly. He felt that his parents were really carefree.He went back to his room and put down his luggage.Then, he took his clothes and walked into the bathroom. He had a good bath.As the sweat and bloodstains on his body got washed away, Wang Teng immediately felt invigorated. The tiredness he was feeling significantly subsided.There was no one at home, so he laid on his bed and counted his gains this time.Enlightenment: 97Spirit: 92Talent: Beginner stage fire talent (11/300) Beginner stage ice talent (13/300), Beginner stage earth talent (12/300), Spiritual Sight (beginner stage 1.4/10), Demon lotus poison body (31/10000), Beginner Stage Arrow Talent (5/100)Force: 75/100 Fire (one-star soldier level martial warrior)70/100 Ice (one-star soldier level martial warrior)17/100 Earth (one-star soldier level martial warrior)3/100 Wood (one-star soldier level martial warrior)3/100 Water (one-star soldier level martial warrior)46/100 Poison (one-star soldier level martial warrior)Scripture: Red Flame Scripture (foundation 32/100), Deep Ice Scripture (foundation 23/100), Earth Loess Skill \u2018Earth Element Shield\u2019 (foundation 26/100)Battle Techniques: Basic battle techniques (presence enlightenment for fist, sword, blade, footwork, stick), Basic Arrow Skill (foundation), Gun Kungfu (foundation 2/10), Fire Kirin Sword Skill (foundation 56/100), Phantom Ice Fist (foundation 28/100)Knowledge: Basic Subjects (full marks), \u2018Five Years of Martial Arts Exam, Three Years of Mock Papers\u2019 (full marks)Overall Battle Power: 271Blank Attribute: 36Wang Teng scanned his attributes and saw an additional Beginner Stage Arrow Talent in his talent row.At the same time, he got a foundation stage Basic Arrow Skill battle technique!These two new attributes came from the same person.As a long-range attack, the arrow was a pretty good choice. He could upgrade it when he had the chance in the future.As for his Force, he had two additional elements now, wood and water. But, the corresponding skill scriptures and battle techniques gave Wang Teng a headache.It wasn\u2019t a bad thing to have more Force elements. However, finding the corresponding Force skill scriptures and battle techniques required much effort and money.But, he was delighted that his ice Force and fire Force had both crossed 70.The power of these two Forces was impressive. They were able to increase his overall battle power greatly. It had reached 271 now. He was slowly moving towards the top standard of a one-star soldier-level martial warrior.He was also left with 36 blank attributes. At first, after increasing his ice Force, he was left with 27 points. But, when he was climbing down the mountain, he picked up a few attribute bubbles dropped by the dead mutated beasts along the way. There was a vast number of mutated beasts that had died.Unfortunately, he was with Governor Jiang and the other leaders, so he couldn\u2019t collect all the attribute bubbles. If not, he would have gotten more blank attributes!When he killed the star beast, no blank attributes were dropped. He found this a little frustrating.Shouldn\u2019t star beasts have a higher probability of dropping blank attributes?Maybe it\u2019s just a probability problem. Sometimes, there is, and sometimes, there isn\u2019t. But it still gave me a star core!Wang Teng took out the star core and observed it with his Spiritual Sight. A ball of thick fire Force was concentrated in this small star core. The amount of Force inside was quite astonishing.He could use this star core to make dan medicines and refined weapons. It could also be used as a Force core. There was a wide range of applications.No wonder the price of the star core was so high.He didn\u2019t make a loss since he had gained this star core.A smile appeared at the corner of Wang Teng\u2019s lips. He took out the box Director He gave him thereafter. There was a star bone inside.Every time he saw this star bone, he couldn\u2019t help but feel amazed.It was entirely blackish green and was glittering and translucent. It also gave off a metallic luster. Thin line patterns covered its whole surface, so perfect that it looked like a piece of art.Based on what Director He said, this star bone came from a star beast known as the Spirit Shadow Scorpion. It possessed the special ability \u2018spiritual shadow.\u2019 Wang Teng touched his chin, a glimmer flashing in his eyes.There was a piece of paper in the box describing this talent ability of the spirit shadow star bone.Wang Teng was dumbfounded when he read the information on the paper.Spiritual shadow meant being able to move quickly in the dark, as elusive as a ghost or spirit. It was an outstanding ability to catch people off their guards.It would definitely give its opponent unexpected surprises during a battle if it was made into a special weapon.What kind of weapon can it make?\u00a0For a moment, Wang Teng had no idea.Star bones were extremely rare and precious. He didn\u2019t want to rush into this whole thing. It would be a waste of this treasured item.He kept the star core and the star bone properly.Wang Teng went back to his bed. He hadn\u2019t slept for an entire night, so exhaustion was washing over his body in waves. His body had its limits. Soon, he fell asleep.When he woke up, it was already 9 am the following day.The moment he woke up and looked at the time, he got a shock. He had slept for one day and one night.I\u2019m so hungry!He could hear his stomach rumbling. Wang Teng climbed up from his bed and washed up. When he went down the stairs, he saw the helper, Aunt Chen, working in the kitchen instead. He asked in surprise, \u201cAunt Chen, where is my mother? I came back two days ago, but I didn\u2019t see her.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, you\u2019re awake. Madam went out early in the morning,\u201d said Aunt Chen.\u201cShe went out early in the morning? Where did she go?\u201d Wang Teng asked curiously.\u201cSomething seemed to have happened in the company. I\u2019m not sure about it. Madam didn\u2019t tell me the details,\u201d Aunt Chen replied.\u201cSomething at the company?\u201d Wang Teng felt even more puzzled. Suddenly, he got an awful feeling in his heart.\u201cMr. Wang hasn\u2019t come back ever since he went on the business trip,\u201d Aunt Chen hesitated, but she still said it in the end.\u201cWhat!\u201dWang Teng\u2019s expression turned ugly. He was almost certain that something terrible had happened.He turned and ran upstairs. After a while, he came down carrying his weapon carrier casket and rushed out of the house in a hurry.\u201cYoung Master, you haven\u2019t eaten in two days. I heated some buns and soy milk. Bring them along with you.\u201d Aunt Chen chased after him and passed the food in her hands.Wang Teng was indeed hungry. He took the breakfast and thanked Aunt Chen. Then, he drove his car out of the garage and sped towards their company building.Half an hour later, Wang Teng arrived at a business district in his car. He drove the car into the office building\u2019s parking lot.He took the lift and came to the receptionist.The pretty lady at the front desk stood up and asked, \u201cHello, how can I help you?\u201d\u201cI want to look for Li Xiumei,\u201d Wang Teng replied.The pretty lady at the front desk was stunned. \u201cWho is Li Xiumei?\u201dWang Teng was speechless. She didn\u2019t even know her boss\u2019s wife. He looked at the lady\u2019s chest. Was this the legendary large chest but no brain?At this moment, a security guard ran over and shouted hurriedly, \u201cYoung Master Wang! Why are you here?\u201d\u201cYou are?\u201d Wang Teng looked at the security guard who dashed over. He pondered for a moment, but he couldn\u2019t remember the person\u2019s name.\u201cHaha, Young Master Wang, a man of your eminence has a short memory. I\u2019m Old Sun,\u201d the security guard laughed awkwardly.\u201cOh! I remember. Old Sun, the director of the security department!\u201d Wang Teng finally remembered the man.\u201cThat\u2019s me.\u201d Old Sun grinned from ear to ear and nodded. Then, he said to the pretty lady at the front desk, \u201cLittle Mei, this is our Little Boss Wang. Hurry up and greet him!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Wang.\u201d The pretty lady at the front desk was alarmed. She continued in a flurry, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t recognize you just now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s not a huge matter.\u201d Wang Teng waved his hand. He asked Old Sun, \u201cOld Sun, did my mom come to the office? Where is she now?\u201d\u201cMadam should be in the meeting room. Boss Bao from the office opposite just came in with a bunch of people. I think that the Deputy General Manager Jia from our company is planning to change jobs,\u201d Old Sun lowered his voice and answered.\u201cBao Zeqing.\u201d Wang Teng squinted. After the Wang family collapsed in his past life, this bastard came out and divided his father\u2019s company. In this lifetime, he didn\u2019t expect the fellow to jump out before his family met a crisis. It looked like many things had changed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: Rise In RevoltThat stupid Bao Zeqing actually came out in advance to cause trouble!No problem, he would take revenge for the old and new grudges today.A cold glimpse appeared in Wang Teng\u2019s eyes. He walked towards the conference room without any expressions on his face.\u201cYoung Master Wang, wait for me. That Bao Zeqing brought quite a few people. Let me accompany you there. I can call some people along to add to our number.\u201dOld Sun chased after him in a hurry. At the same time, he took off the intercom on his body and shouted. \u201cHello, Chen Ergou, Chen Ergou, can you hear me?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m here. Boss, what orders do you have?\u201d A rough voice appeared on the other end of the intercom. The person seemed to be flattering Old Sun.\u201cHurry up and assemble on the eighth floor. Our enemy has already arrived at our doorstep, but you didn\u2019t notice,\u201d Old Sun shouted angrily.\u201cWhich bastard is so bold and dares to create trouble in our Xinteng? I\u2019ll come immediately.\u201dA loud commotion could be heard on the other end of the intercom. They caught Chen Ergou shouting, \u201cTime to work!\u201d to someone. Then, the line disconnected.Old Sun laughed awkwardly. \u201cYoung Master Wang, this is my nephew. He\u2019s not very educated, but he\u2019s daring and hardworking. You can watch his performance later.\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t reply. He walked into the lift with Old Sun and went up to the eighth floor.He looked at the familiar but unfamiliar structures around him and headed to the meeting room based on the memory deep inside his mind.The instant he reached the meeting room entrance, he heard Li Xiumei\u2019s angry voice inside.\u201cJia Guiren, my husband treated you very well. How can you collude with outsiders to seize the company\u2019s shares when he\u2019s in trouble?\u201d\u201cMrs. Wang, you don\u2019t have to make it sound so bad. Boss Wang indeed treats me well, and I\u2019m grateful to him. However, it is in man\u2019s nature to strive for better. Boss Bao is a man of great talent and bold vision. His company has more potential, so understandably, I\u2019m more willing to work with him.\u201dA man\u2019s voice could be heard after that. He sounded so hypocritical that Wang Teng frowned uncontrollably. His expression turned colder.\u201cThat Deputy Jia seemed like a good person. I didn\u2019t expect him to be a rotten egg,\u201d Old Sun said with disgust.Wang Teng didn\u2019t say anything, just pushing the door of the meeting room.In an instant, everyone looked at him.\u201cLittle Teng, why are you here?\u201d Li Xiumei asked in surprise when she saw Wang Teng. She looked exhausted.\u201cI heard that something happened, so I came to take a look.\u201dWang Teng walked into the meeting room. He glanced at the men who looked like successful people. They were wearing suits and sitting calmly on the chairs.\u201cLittle Boss Wang, this is a matter between adults. There\u2019s no need for you to interfere,\u201d a man who looked around 40 years old said. He was wearing a pair of gold-rimmed glasses.\u201cJia Guiren!\u201dWang Teng smiled calmly and sat down beside Li Xiumei. He pulled the chair for her. \u201cMom, have a seat. Aren\u2019t you tired from standing?\u201dAs he spoke, he noticed that there was a young lady around 20 years old sitting on Li Xiumei\u2019s right.He exclaimed in surprise, \u201cCousin, you\u2019re here too.\u201d\u201cYounger brother.\u201dWang Yanan nodded at Wang Teng. \u201cGrandfather was worried when he heard about this, so he asked me to come and see if I can help.\u201dThis lady was Wang Teng\u2019s uncle, Wang Shenghong\u2019s, daughter. She graduated from a top university. After she completed her postgraduate study, she joined the Rongsheng Group that Wang Teng\u2019s grandfather had founded. Her capabilities were outstanding, and she gained the approval of the higher authorities in the company within two years.She was able to undertake tasks alone now.It was obvious that his uncle sent her over to help because he trusted her ability.Jia Guiren frowned when he saw Wang Teng ignoring him. Anger appeared on his face. In the past, Wang Shengguo had told him about Wang Teng\u2019s playful acts frequently. He listened to them until he felt that callus was going to grow on his ears.This arrogant and useless person actually disregarded him!\u201cHmph, Little Boss Wang is still the same. You don\u2019t have any respect for an elder like me.\u201dA sinister glimpse flashed past Jia Guiren\u2019s eyes. He took the chance to influence the thoughts of the other higher-ups in the company.Look, this is the future heir of Xingten. He shows no respect to his elders and superiors. Are you still going to place your hopes in him?Many of the company\u2019s founding members frowned slightly.They had heard of Wang Teng a long time ago. It was alright if he was just arrogant and playful. He was still young, so it was understandable that he would be wilful because of his parents\u2019 love. After he matured, everything would be fine.But, if he showed no respect to his elders, that was a little disappointing.Li Xiumei and Wang Yanan shook their heads secretly when they saw everyone\u2019s reaction. They exchanged glances and read the helplessness on each other\u2019s faces.Wang Teng\u2019s sudden arrival had caught them off guard.They were already at a disadvantage, but Jia Guiren was now making an issue out of Wang Teng\u2019s character. Any minor problems could be amplified and move the hearts of the company\u2019s founding members. They were in a passive position.\u201cLittle Boss Wang, we are having a meeting. If you have nothing, you can leave first,\u201d a founding member said unhappily. He seemed to think that Wang Teng was kicking up a fuss and embarrassing them.\u201cWhy should I leave?\u201d Wang Teng placed his weapon carrier casket on the ground and put his right hand on it as he said indifferently.\u201cHmph, Mrs. Wang, it looks like your family\u2019s education is really bad. Our Little Boss Wang doesn\u2019t know his manners and shows no respect to his elders at all. Boss Wang\u2019s ability must be limited since he\u2019s unable to teach his child properly.\u201cAlso, our Little Boss Wang isn\u2019t young anymore. It\u2019s time to educate him. If not, he will definitely cause trouble in the future!\u201d The fat middle-aged man sitting beside Jia Guiren laughed as he said.\u201cIf you can\u2019t bear to do it, let me educate him properly for you.\u201dJia Guiren suddenly burst out laughing as though he had heard a funny joke.The other founding members of the company watched the scene indifferently. A few of them wanted to say something, but the situation was still uncertain. They didn\u2019t want to stand out. Bao Zeqing might target them in the future.This time, Bao Zeqing came well-prepared. Wang Shengguo was in trouble, and there was no news of him even until now. The company was in danger.No one knew if the company would be able to survive.If it was really bought over by Bao Zeqing, they would need to work under him. It wasn\u2019t a wise move to stand out now.However, at this moment, a short middle-aged man suddenly stood up and pointed at Bao Zeqing furiously. \u201cBao Zeqing, you are a reputable businessman. Yet, you are attempting to take over Xinteng when our Boss Wang isn\u2019t around. You even bully and humiliate his wife and son. What is this?\u201dBao Zeqing looked at him mockingly. Before he could speak, Jia Guiren opened his mouth first. \u201cHaha, Old Guo, I didn\u2019t know that you were such a loyal dog.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Guo Mingda was so angry he didn\u2019t know what to say.Even a refined lady like Li Xiumei was trembling in anger. Her face was covered with soot. Just as she was about to blow her fuse, Wang Teng held her hand and patted it softly to comfort her.Then, he stood up slowly. Everyone couldn\u2019t help but look at him.He pressed his palm on the marble meeting table in front of him. Force seeped out of his body, and his strength exploded.Boom!Cracks appeared on the entire marble table. Immediately after that, it shattered and smashed on the ground in front of everyone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: Martial Warriors Are Superior!The marble table shattered into pieces and dropped to the ground.Everyone retreated in shock. They were all caught off guard because everything happened so quickly. Some people fell from their chairs, looking extremely bedraggled.Jia Guiren\u2019s foot got smashed by the broken marble table. He screamed in pain, sounding like a pig.Li Xiumei and Wang Yanan were sitting beside Wang Teng, so all the marble pieces were forced away by Wang Teng. They weren\u2019t hurt at all.Even so, they were given a huge scare. They looked at Wang Teng absent-mindedly.Bao Zeqing and the rest of the people were pale in the face. They crawled up from the ground in a disorderly manner. Their suits were dirty from the dust, but they didn\u2019t have the time to clean themselves. They were all staring at Wang Teng in astonishment.\u201cOh my god!\u201d\u201cUncle, look at our Young Master Wang\u2019s ability. He doesn\u2019t need us.\u201dChen Ergou had also hurried over with the rest of the security guards. They were standing outside the door with Old Sun. When they saw this scene, their jaws almost dropped to the ground.Wang Teng walked in front of Bao Zeqing and looked at him. \u201cWhat right do you have to educate me?\u201d\u201cBrat, don\u2019t think that you can be arrogant just because you have some capability.\u201d Bao Zeqing swallowed his saliva and took a step back unconsciously. He shouted, \u201cZou Lei!\u201dA muscular young man rushed out from the corner and aimed his huge fist at Wang Teng.\u201cBe careful!\u201d\u201cSon, be careful!\u201dLi Xiumei and Wang Yanan\u2019s expressions changed. They shouted at the same time.\u201cHmph!\u201dWang Teng snorted. He also raised his fist and welcomed his punch like a man.Crack!The sound of bones cracking spooked everyone at the scene.Li Xiumei and Wang Yanan\u2019s faces turned white. They thought that Wang Teng was hurt.But, the next moment, a scream of agony came out from the muscular young man\u2019s mouth. His entire body flew out like a golf ball and slammed heavily into the wall.His arm was completely distorted.The fats on Bao Zeqing\u2019s face started to tremble uncontrollably when he saw this gruesome sight. Cold sweat kept dripping down his forehead.Wang Teng glanced at the man. Then, he looked out of the window.There was a tall building right opposite.\u201cIs that your company?\u201d Wang Teng asked.\u201cSo what if it is?\u201d Bao Zeqing\u2019s legs were getting weak, but he still forced himself to remain calm.Wang Teng said, \u201cSomeone told me that we can\u2019t keep a low profile forever. When the time comes to display our abilities, we should display them. If not, other people would step on you.\u201cIn the past, I didn\u2019t agree with what he said. Now, I think his words make sense.\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he patted the weapon carrier casket beside him lightly. He took a battle sword out from the casket.\u201cWhat are you planning to do?\u201d Bao Zeqing shouted in fear and astonishment as he retreated continuously.Wang Teng glanced at him without any expression.He walked in front of the floor-to-ceiling window.Suddenly, a red Force exploded out of his body. It seemed as though he was wearing a red gown. The red Force raged in the air.Slash!He waved the sword!The sword light cut the air in half!The window instantly exploded. The red sword glow cut through the walls of the building opposite them, leaving a long and burnt black sword mark.Everyone was flabbergasted. No one spoke for a long time.\u201cMartial\u2026 martial warrior!\u201dBao Zeqing\u2019s face had turned completely white. He kept stuttering and spent a long time before he spat out these two words.\u201cHow is that possible?\u201dJia Guiren looked at Wang Teng in a daze. His mind was filled with Wang Teng\u2019s back view when he was executing his move just now. He was utterly shocked.How could this playful and cocky child be a martial warrior?He wasn\u2019t able to accept that the \u2018useless son\u2019 Wang Shengguo always mentioned was actually a martial warrior!This was so sarcastic!If this was useless, what was useful?A general-rank?All the founding members of the company had the same expression on their faces. None of them could accept the fact that Wang Teng was a martial warrior.This was nonsense!Wang Teng was still so young. How could he become a martial warrior?Li Xiumei and Wang Yanan felt dumbfounded at first. Then, immediately after that, happiness gushed out of their hearts like eternal springs. They understood clearly what it meant to become a martial warrior.Now, as long as Wang Teng was around, their company would never collapse.A martial warrior could suppress his opponent with his abilities if anyone wanted to seize his assets with evil intentions. He could even sue the other person in court. The winner would definitely be the martial warrior.A martial warrior could even kill someone for a valid reason.They could kill first and inform later.This was the rank of martial warriors in society.Martial warriors were superior!\u2026\u201cLook at the cut of the sword clearly. If you dare to play any more tricks, this sword wouldn\u2019t be cutting your building the next time. It will be your body.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re able to withstand one of my attacks.\u201dWang Teng looked at Bao Zeqing and said indifferently.Then, he glanced around him. His gaze landed on Jia Guiren for a second before he looked at other people. However, no one dared to look back at him.\u201cNo matter what your thoughts are, keep a low profile and remain humble until my father comes back. Once he returns, those that want to leave can do so. You can follow whoever you want to follow. I will not stop you.\u201dThe entire meeting room was dead silent. The people that had thoughts of leaving were overwhelmed with regrets.This was a martial warrior.With a martial warrior guarding the Wang family, there was no need to worry about the company\u2019s growth. At that time, as the founding members of the company, their assets would definitely increase exponentially.But, now\u2026After Wang Shengguo came back, there would probably be a massive cleanup.Anyone that harmed them by taking advantage of the situation and those that didn\u2019t have a firm mentality would not be able to stay.No matter how good the prospects were, it had nothing to do with them.How many millions did they lose? Their hearts\u2026 It hurt so much!The most important thing was, they didn\u2019t dare to act rashly now. If not, they would face the revenge of a martial warrior. Their ending would be even worse than the reformation that would happen after Wang Shengguo came back.Jia Guiren\u2019s face turned green.He was the person who had offended the Wang family the most.Bao Zeqing had promised to give him 10% of the company shares. That was why he agreed to make the shares of the company drop so that it was easier for a merger to happen.Looking at the situation now, everything he did was for nothing!He wouldn\u2019t have any shares of the new company, and his journey in Xinteng had come to an end. Very soon, he would get kicked out by Wang Shengguo, and he might even seek revenge. He probably wouldn\u2019t be able to survive in Donghai anymore.\u2026Wang Teng disregarded these people who had different thoughts. He brought Li Xiumei out of the room and asked, \u201cMom, what happened to Dad?\u201d\u201cYour dad went to the neighboring province to discuss a project. There was an issue with the interests of both sides, so he wasn\u2019t able to reach an agreement. However, the other party broke the rules and detained your father with the help of a local tyrant. They won\u2019t release him unless he agrees to sign the contract,\u201d Li Xiumei explained with a worried expression.Wang Teng had already displayed the ability of a martial warrior, so she no longer treated him as a child.\u201cGrandfather has already sent people over to help, but there haven\u2019t been any results,\u201d Wang Yanan added at the side.\u201cWhat project is it? Why is Dad so stupid. He can just agree to them. We might lose some money, but life is more important,\u201d Wang Teng frowned and said.\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple. There\u2019s something wrong with this project. It has huge implications. They want to use your father as the scapegoat,\u201d Li Xiumei knew some things, but she didn\u2019t know the exact details.\u201cHuh?\u201d Wang Teng sensed that there was something strange. Was this a scheme by those people inside? However, in his past life, they only attacked the Wang family after he attended university.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: The Boss\u2019s Privacy\u201cI will make a trip personally.\u201dWang Teng\u2019s mind worked at full cylinders. It didn\u2019t matter if it was a scheme by those people inside. His father was detained, and he must fetch his back.\u201cWill there be a problem?\u201d Li Xiumei was still a little worried.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mom. You have seen your son\u2019s ability. I didn\u2019t even release one-tenth of my potential just now,\u201d Wang Teng comforted her.\u201cIn that case, be careful. Don\u2019t get hurt.\u201dOne was her son, while the other was her husband. She was worried about both, but she could only rely on her son now.Fortunately, her son had already grown up. When the pillar of the house collapsed, he was able to support the family.Wang Teng nodded. He turned and prepared to leave.\u201cI will go with you. It will be more convenient for me to contact Grandfather\u2019s men,\u201d Wang Yanan suddenly said.\u201cThat\u2019s right, you can go together. You can take care of each other too.\u201d Li Xiumei nodded.Since Li Xiumei had already agreed, Wang Teng had nothing to say.The two of them got in the car and left Donghai City. They entered the expressway and headed towards Jiang City in the neighboring province.\u2026Along the way, Wang Yanan glanced at the rearview mirror with the corner of her eyes while driving to size up Wang Teng.Wang Teng was sitting in the back seat at this moment. He had his eyes closed and was holding the rectangular casket with one hand. He wasn\u2019t moving at all. He was extremely quiet, and there were no emotions on his face.He really felt like a different person now.Whether it was his aura or his way of doing things, they were worlds apart from the past Wang Teng.In the past, everyone just felt that he was playful, ignorant, bossy, arrogant\u2026 But today, when she saw him again, his performance surprised her.The most important thing was, her younger cousin was actually a powerful martial warrior.Martial warrior!If grandfather knew that her young cousin Wang Teng was a martial warrior, he would be so happy that he wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep.Honestly speaking, when you suddenly realize that someone whom you were familiar with, someone you thought was ordinary, was actually extremely powerful, the feeling was indescribable.At this moment, she recalled the scene when Wang Teng had swung his sword. Everyone was dumbstruck at that second.All the schemes and tricks were useless in front of true power.In the future, their Wang family would have a martial warrior guarding them. The Wang family would definitely climb to a higher position.Also, if Wang Teng continued to become more powerful, the future of the Wang family\u2026Wang Yanan shook her head. She shouldn\u2019t be thinking so far ahead. She should save her second uncle first.It shouldn\u2019t be a problem since her martial warrior cousin had come personally.\u2026They drove for five hours and finally reached Jian City.Along the way, Wang Yanan didn\u2019t interrupt Wang Teng. She drove for the entire journey, so she seemed a little tired now.\u201cHave we reached?\u201dWang Teng felt the car stop. He opened his eyes and asked.\u201cYes. Let\u2019s find the person whom grandfather sent to negotiate first to understand the whole situation.\u201d Wang Yanan parked the car outside a hotel and brought Wang Teng into a room.A man around 30 years old greeted them. \u201cManager Wang.\u201d\u201cTell me about the situation,\u201d Wang Yanan went directly to the point.The man nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not working. No matter what conditions we promise them, the other party is unwilling to let him go. They seemed to have other motives.\u201d\u201cWhat is the background of the other party?\u201d Wang Teng frowned and asked.\u201cIron Fist Clan. They have more than ten advanced stage martial disciples. No one dares to provoke them,\u201d the man replied with a solemn expression.\u201cIn that case, there shouldn\u2019t be a problem if we uproot them completely, right?\u201d Wang Teng asked nonchalantly.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the man nodded and replied.The moment he finished speaking, he suddenly realized what he had said.What did this young man mean?He looked at Wang Teng with a puzzled and shocked gaze.Wang Yanan was looking at Wang Teng in astonishment too. Uproot them completely? Was this what her cousin was thinking?If those people know that they had offended a martial warrior, they would probably be overwhelmed with regret.\u201cThere are too many people in the day. Let\u2019s act at night.\u201dIt was already past three in the afternoon. They could only wait slowly.Although he wanted to save Wang Shengguo as soon as possible, Wang Teng knew that he mustn\u2019t act rashly.Also, based on Wang Yanan\u2019s guess, the other party wouldn\u2019t hurt Wang Shengguo since they wanted to use him as their scapegoat.Hence, he was temporarily safe. There was no need to worry.Wang Yanan was tired after driving for a long time. She booked a room and took a rest.In the evening, the three of them had dinner and waited until 10 pm before heading to the headquarters of the Iron Fist Clan. Wang Shengguo was locked up there all this while.The headquarters of the Iron Fist Clan was not far away. A black sedan stopped in the dark, and Wang Teng got out of the car.\u201cWait for me here. I will be back soon.\u201dHe spoke to Wang Yanan and then carried his weapon carrier casket, heading towards the entrance of the Iron Fist Clan.\u201cManager Wang, is Young Master Wang planning to save his father all alone?\u201d The man that came along didn\u2019t understand the situation.He found Wang Teng a little daring as he looked at his back view.Would he be alright?The other party was the Iron Fist Clan. They had more than ten advanced stage martial disciples. This Young Master Wang seemed like an ordinary person. How was he able to deal with those powerful advanced stage martial disciples?\u201cWatch and see!\u201d Wang Yanan was also worried, but she felt proud for some reason. This was her younger cousin.What will he do?A question popped up in her mind. Wang Yanan couldn\u2019t help but look at the entrance of the Iron Fist Clan, which was enshrouded in darkness.Wang Teng walked to the entrance and knocked on the metal door outside.\u201cWho is it?\u201d A vigilant voice came from inside.\u201cDelivery man!\u201dWang Teng\u2019s figure was hidden in the dark.\u201cWho are you kidding? What delivery can you make at this time of the night? Say, what is your intention?\u201d The person behind the door obviously didn\u2019t believe him.\u201cBrother, this is something your boss ordered.\u201d\u201cSomething the boss ordered? What is it?\u201d the person was suspicious, but he still asked.What if it was really something their boss ordered and he didn\u2019t open the door? If the item wasn\u2019t delivered, his boss would look for him for answers.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s private,\u201d Wang Teng replied.\u201cYou\u2019re still trying to fool me. Tell me what it is. If you can\u2019t, you must have been sent by the other factions to create trouble for our Iron Fist Clan.\u201d The person sneered.\u201cAre you sure you want me to say it?\u201d\u201cSay it!\u201d\u201cAlright, since you asked so sincerely, I will show mercy and tell you. He ordered\u2026 \u2018I love a matchstick\u2019 (an aphrodisiac that got its name from a novel).\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d The person didn\u2019t manage to react in time.\u201cI love a matchstick!\u201d Wang Teng shouted.\u201cI love a matchstick\u2026 oh my god.\u201d The person remembered something and gasped in shock.Their boss\u2019s fetish was indescribable!\u201cYou\u2019re afraid now, right? This is your boss\u2019s privacy. It\u2019s not good if you know too much,\u201d Wang Teng said slowly.\u201cWait, brother, listen to me\u2026\u201d The man hurriedly opened the door and dashed in front of Wang Teng. He was agitated. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask anything just now, and you didn\u2019t say anything\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, you asked, and I answered,\u201d Wang Teng said honestly.\u2026The young man who came out of the door turned green in anger. Damn it, can you speak properly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: I Don\u2019t Mind\u2026 Falling To Hell!\u201cBrother, let\u2019s talk at the side.\u201d The young man held Wang Teng\u2019s arm and seemed very enthusiastic.\u201cOh right, what is inside the rectangular box you\u2019re carrying?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but ask when he saw the weapon carrier casket behind Wang Teng\u2019s back.\u201cOh, this is the delivery box. Do you want to look at the contents?\u201d asked Wang Teng calmly.\u201cNo, no.\u201d The young man shook his head like a rattle drum.He pulled Wang Teng to a corner and took out a few hundred dollars from his pockets. \u201cBrother, it must be difficult for you to run around in the middle of the night to support yourself. This is my sincerity. I didn\u2019t ask you anything just now, right?\u201dWang Teng rubbed the hundred dollar notes in his hand and pretended to be a money lover. He nodded and said, \u201cI think that you didn\u2019t ask me anything.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I didn\u2019t ask, and you didn\u2019t answer. Let\u2019s live harmoniously in peace.\u201d The young man nodded his head in satisfaction.\u201cCan I enter now?\u201d Wang Teng asked.\u201cGo ahead, go ahead.\u201d The young man waved his hand. Then, he asked again, \u201cOh right, do you know where our boss lives?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d Wang Teng shook his head.\u201cHe lives at\u2026 Never mind, I\u2019ll bring you there.\u201d The young man seemed a little worried, so he turned around and locked the door. Then, he personally led Wang Teng into the headquarters.It was late at night. There was no one walking around the place. The young man took the lead, and soon, they arrived outside a door.\u201cOur boss lives here. Remember, I didn\u2019t ask anything.\u201d The young man still felt disturned, so he reminded Wang Teng again like a nagging mother.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your boss won\u2019t know anything.\u201d Wang Teng gave a mysterious expression and nodded.Knock, knock, knock!The young man finally knocked on the door. A sound was heard from inside the room. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cBoss, it\u2019s me, Little Wu. There\u2019s a delivery here for you.\u201d\u201cLittle Wu? Oh, the one guarding the door? What is it?\u201dThe voice inside turned suspicious. The footsteps came closer and reached the door. Then, the doorknob turned.The door was about to open.However, suddenly\u2026Boom!A huge force surged out from inside. The door burst into pieces, and a figure holding a battle blade dashed out.Wang Teng was slightly shocked. But, he reacted in time.He activated the runes on his weapon carrier casket.Clang!The battle sword jumped out and landed in his hand. Wang Teng turned around and blocked the battle blade that was aimed at him.Clang!Sparks flew everywhere.The two of them separated instantly. The muscular man, who flew out of the room, glared at Wang Teng. \u201cThere\u2019s indeed a problem. Who sent you?\u201dOn the other side, the young man called Little Wu was shocked, looking at the two people in a daze. He didn\u2019t know what was happening.Wasn\u2019t he here to send \u2018I love a matchstick\u2019?What are you doing?This rectangular box isn\u2019t the delivery item? Why did a weapon jump out of it?Are you bullying me because I didn\u2019t study well?Little Wu wanted to cry. At the moment, he had turned into a curious little baby with a thousand questions in his heart.\u201cIdiot, how dare you let outsiders in so easily. I will take care of you later,\u201d the muscular man shouted at Little Wu. Little Wu shrunk his neck in fear.I\u2019m dead.I angered the boss. What should I do? I\u2019m so nervous. Please help!At the same time, loud footsteps were heard from different directions. The other members of the Iron Fist Clan had obviously received the news and were rushing over.Within a few seconds, the place was packed with people.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the boss of the Iron Fist Clan to be an extreme martial disciple,\u201d Wang Teng said in surprise.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have the ability, how could I sit in this position?\u201cYou amazed me too. You are so young, but you are already so powerful. You should have a bright future ahead. What a pity. You will die here today.\u201dThe boss of the Iron Fist Clan was quite self-absorbed. He started shaking his head in pity.He looked at Wang Teng and wanted to catch any hints of fear or panic on his face. Unfortunately, there was nothing.In such a situation, the young man opposite him remained calm and composed. There was no uneasiness in his gaze.\u201cAre all your men here?\u201d asked Wang Teng in a soft voice.The boss of the Iron Fist Clan could sense the contempt in his nonchalant voice. He was so angry that he smiled. \u201cThese people are enough to chop you into a pile of meat.\u201dThen, his face turned cold, and his expression became sinister.\u201cKill him!\u201dThe clan members swarm towards Wang Teng. They were all holding weapons in their hands, and they smashed them on Wang Teng\u2019s body.Boom!Wang Teng\u2019s gaze turned cold as the Force inside his body exploded. It dispersed around him like shockwaves, throwing off the people charging at the front.Wang Teng held the battle sword in his hand and charged into the crowd.At this moment, his heart was exceptionally cold and hard. Every slash of his sword was a life lost. Every fist he punched broke his opponent\u2019s bones. Blood splattered everywhere, and the scene was extremely tragic.He didn\u2019t want to kill anyone, but since they wanted to kill him, he decided to have a good time killing them.He would kill until these people were fearful of him!\u201cMartial warrior!\u201dThe boss of the Iron Fist Clan was struck dumb with astonishment and shock. His voice was shrill as he shouted in terror. He looked as though he had seen a ghost.The other members of the clan finally knew what kind of opponent they were facing. They turned pale with fright.\u201cRun!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a martial warrior. We can\u2019t beat him.\u201d\u201cDamn it, how did we provoke this powerful figure?\u201dIn the end, some people started escaping in a flurry. They didn\u2019t even have the courage to face Wang Teng.However, Wang Teng was immersed in the killing. He was like a raging bear charging into a pack of wolves. He didn\u2019t care who he killed.Wherever he went, cries of pain followed.On the other side, the boss of the Iron Fist Clan knew that he couldn\u2019t defeat Wang Teng, so he attempted to run away amidst the chaos.Wang Teng stepped on the ground, and his entire body shot into the air like a cannonball. He landed heavily in front of the boss of the Iron Fist Clan and swung his sword at him.\u201cDie!\u201dThe boss of the Iron Fist Clan was panic-stricken. He raised his blade to block the attack.The next instant, a massive force like the weight of a mountain bore down on him. His battle blade cracked and broke on the spot.Splurt!He vomited a mouthful of blood. The boss of the Iron Fist Clan couldn\u2019t control his body and kept stepping back. He had to take six to seven steps to get his footing.Wang Teng had shown mercy this time.\u201cWho asked you to catch Wang Shengguo?\u201d Wang Teng asked.\u201cWang Shengguo?\u201dThe boss of the Iron Fist Clan finally knew the source of the disaster. Afraid that he would infuriate Wang Teng if he spoke a second too late, he hurriedly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know either. I think they come from Capital Xia. The leader of the group is a martial warrior too. I have no ability to resist. That\u2019s why I laid my hands on Wang Shengguo.\u201d\u201cCapital Xia. Martial warrior.\u201d Wang Teng squinted.\u201cI had no other choice. Please spare my life,\u201d the boss of the Iron Fist Clan pleaded.\u201cSigh!\u201d Wang Teng heaved a breath. \u201cI want to spare your life, but my heart doesn\u2019t allow me to.\u201dThe next moment, fire Force spurted out. The terrifying flames engulfed the boss of the Iron Fist Clan.\u201cNo!\u201dThe boss of the Iron Fist Clan shouted in fear. But soon, his shouts were replaced by screams of agony.\u201cAh\u2026 please show mercy!\u201dWang Teng\u2019s expression remained indifferent. He displayed no emotions on his face as he watched the boss getting engulfed by the flames.At this instant, his heartlessness was displayed blatantly.He was never soft-hearted towards his enemies.\u201cBoss\u2026 is dead.\u201dThe bunch of clan members that wanted to fight with Wang Teng until death swallowed their salivas when they saw this scene. They felt their lips turning dry.A chill ran through their entire body.Wang Teng turned and scanned the crowd. In an instant, he charged between them and started his massacre.Leave no chance for revival!\u201cAh, hurry up and run! This person is crazy. He wants to kill us all,\u201d someone cried shrilly. The terrified voice echoed throughout the Iron Fist Clan headquarters.\u201cDevil, you are a devil!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t kill me, don\u2019t kill me. I just joined the clan. I have never killed anyone.\u201d\u201cDevil, you will go to hell sooner or later. We will be waiting for you below\u2026\u201dAt this moment, Wang Teng turned into a demon and destroyed everything in its path. He would kill anyone that posed a threat to his family.Normally, he could laugh and fool around, but he wouldn\u2019t be soft-hearted at this moment!In order to allow my family to live under the sun, I don\u2019t mind\u2026 falling to hell!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: Dad, Mom Is Asking You To Go Home For Dinner!\u201cWhat is happening?\u201dWang Shengguo was tied in a room. He could faintly hear the commotion outside, but he couldn\u2019t figure out the exact details.Sigh, I wonder how they are doing?\u00a0He couldn\u2019t help but think of Li Xiumei and Wang Teng.\u00a0They must be worried sick.How did those people find me? There are no grudges between us, so it\u2019s impossible that they will make me their scapegoat for no reason.Wang Shengguo pondered about the cause and the consequences, but he couldn\u2019t find any reason. He had seen the document. If he signed his name on it, the entire Xinteng Group, including their Wang family, would suffer terribly\u2026Wait, the Wang family!Is their target the Wang family?\u00a0A chill ran through his body when he thought of this possibility.They are cutting the ground under our foot. They want to destroy the entire Wang family!At first, he didn\u2019t want to implicate his wife and son. However, after straightening his thoughts, there was even more reason for him not to sign the document.Just as he was thinking about this, he suddenly heard the door opening.His eyes were covered with a black cloth, so he couldn\u2019t see the person walking in. He could only raise his head and turn in the direction of the door.\u201cDad, Mom is asking you to go home for dinner.\u201dA familiar voice entered Wang Shengguo\u2019s ears.\u201cLittle Teng!\u201d Wang Shengguo thought that his hearing was going wild. However, this playful tone really sounded like his son.A second later, the black cloth was removed.He finally saw the person who came. It really was Wang Teng!\u201cSon, what are you doing here?\u201d Wang Shengguo was stunned.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t come, you might have been locked here for god knows how long,\u201d Wang Teng replied helplessly.He cut the ropes binding Wang Shengguo and helped him up. \u201cAlright, let\u2019s go home. Mom must be worried.\u201dWhen Wang Shengguo stood up and tried to walk, he staggered. He had been tied up for a long time, so his legs were numb.Wang Teng hurriedly held him. At the same time, he didn\u2019t forget to tease his father, \u201cDad, you haven\u2019t reached 50, but your legs are already out of shape.\u201d\u201cBullshit, your dad is very healthy. I won\u2019t pant even if I climb ten flights of stairs,\u201d Wang Shengguo refuted furiously.\u201cYou\u2019re really free. Why are you climbing the stairs when you can take the lift?\u201d Wang Teng complained.\u2026Wang Shengguo was speechless. He felt that his intelligence would drop drastically whenever he talked to this brat.\u201cYou haven\u2019t told me how you came in? Did they agree to let me go? Did you promise them something?\u201dWang Shengguo immediately got anxious when he thought of the document. \u201cDid they ask you to sign a document? You must never sign it. That\u2019s a huge trap. If we drop inside, our Wang family will be doomed.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not so stupid.\u201cThe people from the Iron Fist Clan are very easy to talk to. I shared the truth and reasoned with them. I also chatted with them about life and ambitions. It took so much effort before they finally recognized their mistakes and agreed to let you go.\u201dWang Teng spouted nonsense.\u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Wang Shengguo\u2019s expression turned strange.Share the truth?Reasoned with them?Talking about life and ambitions?Can you reason with the Iron Fist Clan? Are they so free that they will chat about life and ambition with you?Wang Shengguo suddenly felt like hitting him.\u00a0Are you trying to fool me? Do you think I\u2019m stupid?\u201cWhy do you think they let you go?\u201d Wang Teng retorted. Then, he walked out of the room with Wang Shengguo.He purposely evaded the areas with corpses. He had even changed into clean clothes before he met Wang Shengguo.Soon, he brought Wang Shengguo out of the Iron Fist Clan.Wang Shengguo couldn\u2019t get anything out of Wang Teng\u2019s mouth. In the end, he turned around and curiously glanced at the Iron Fist Clan. It was so quiet he felt uneasy.\u2026The two of them met Wang Yanan.\u201cUncle!\u201d Wang Yanan heaved a sigh of relief when she saw them. At the same time, she had a new understanding of Wang Teng\u2019s capability.He had gone in the tiger\u2019s den, the Iron Fist Clan, alone and came out unscathed. He even brought his father out safely. This wasn\u2019t something ordinary people could achieve.\u201cYanan, sorry to trouble you to make a trip here.\u201d Wang Shengguo thanked Wang Yanan.\u201cUncle, there\u2019s no need to be polite with me. We are family,\u201d Wang Yanan smiled and said.The man who came along with them was still in shock.\u00a0Mr. Wang\u2019s son is a diamond in the rough.\u00a0Glancing at the abnormally silent Iron Fist Clan, his head turned numb.Wang Teng had gone in for merely less than half an hour. How could those people agree to let Wang Shengguo go in such a short period? Could it be\u2026He thought of a possibility. He secretly glanced at Wang Teng with his hair standing on the ends.Gasp!\u201cMr. Wang, should we rest in Jiang City for the night or go back to Donghai?\u201d the man asked.\u201cLet\u2019s go back to Donghai.\u201d Wang Shengguo was eager to go back, so he replied without hesitation.The other party nodded. He drove the car to the highway and sped their way back to Donghai.\u2026They only returned to Donghai at six in the morning.The car stopped outside the Fuhua Villa District. Wang Teng and Wang Shengguo got off the car.\u201cUncle, I will be going back first. I can inform Grandfather too in case he\u2019s worried,\u201d Wang Yanan lowered the car window and said.\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t keep you anymore. You had a long day. Go back and have a good rest.\u201d Wang Shengguo nodded.Wang Yanan also nodded in return. She then waved at Wang Teng. \u201cCousin, I\u2019ll be leaving first. Let\u2019s meet up when we\u2019re free. Our families should get to know each other better.\u201d\u201cOkay, Elder Sister. Have a safe journey!\u201d Wang Teng smiled and nodded.Wang Yanan was right about one thing. They were relatives; blood was thicker than water.In his past life, their relatives would argue with one another, but in times of crisis, for instance, when the Wang family collapsed, they still helped each other out. This was something outsiders couldn\u2019t do.Wang Shengguo was stunned by Wang Yanan\u2019s attitude towards Wang Teng.In the past, Wang Yanan treated Wang Teng with disdain. After all, she was the favored child of God, outstanding in all areas.Wang Teng was different. He was useless and playful, so he couldn\u2019t merge into their small circle at all.But, now, Wang Yanan was exceptionally gentle towards Wang Teng. This attitude made Wang Shengguo relieved and gratified.After Wang Yanan left, Wang Shengguo and Wang Teng went home.Li Xiumei didn\u2019t sleep the entire night. She was waiting on the sofa in the living room, her face rife with worry and agitation.Aunt Lee didn\u2019t go home, either. She kept Li Xiumei company in case she felt alone.She instantly noticed Wang Teng and his father when they opened the door and walked in. She cried happily, \u201cMadam, Mr. Wang and Young Master Wang are back!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dLi Xiumei raised her head. The instant she saw Wang Shengguo, tears almost gushed out of her eyes.Wang Shengguo walked forward and hugged Li Xiumei. He patted her back gently. \u201cI\u2019m back. I\u2019m sorry for making you worry.\u201d\u201cHa~ Mom, Dad, stop this PDA. My goosebumps are dropping all over the floor.\u201d Wang Teng yawned and rolled his eyes.Li Xiumei struggled out of Wang Shengguo\u2019s arms with a red face.\u201cStupid brat.\u201d Wang Shengguo glared at Wang Teng.\u201cMr. Wang, have a seat. I will make some food,\u201d Aunt Chen smiled as she said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: I\u2019m Gifted!At home, Aunt Chen finished cooking breakfast. Wang Teng and his family sat down and had breakfast together.\u201cWhat? Our son is a martial warrior?\u201dWang Shengguo almost spat out the food in his mouth, as though he had heard some shocking news. He stared at Li Xiumei in astonishment.\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can ask your son yourself,\u201d said Li Xiumei.\u201cSon, your mom is lying to me, right?\u201d Wang Shengguo stared at Wang Teng without blinking.Wang Teng didn\u2019t say anything. He just stuck out his finger, and a strand of fire Force appeared at the tip. The flame silently burned in the air, a spectacle for the three. Wang Shengguo was shocked.\u201cForce. You really are a martial warrior!\u201d\u201cBut, how did you become a martial warrior? It\u2019s been only days since you started practicing martial arts!\u201d He was still in disbelief.The main thing was Wang Teng\u2019s short training time.Everyone knew that martial arts was an arduous path. It was still manageable at the martial disciple stages, but many people were unable to step over the threshold to become martial warriors.Now, Wang Teng had already taken that step. This jump was a little too fast, though.\u00a0Are you telling us that the obstacles are fake?Wang Shengguo suddenly remembered the dead silent Iron Fist Clan.\u00a0Did this child\u2026Never mind, he has already become a martial warrior, so I can\u2019t judge his actions like that of a normal person.Also, those people were bad too.\u201cWill you believe me if I tell you that I met an old man who reluctantly took me in as his disciple because he noticed that I\u2019m extremely talented in martial arts? He imparted a formidable skill to me. That\u2019s how I improved so quickly,\u201d Wang Teng ate and smoked at the same time.\u201cThis child is spouting nonsense again.\u201d Li Xiumei rolled her eyes at him.Wang Shengguo was speechless too. He obviously didn\u2019t believe his son.\u201cThere\u2019s only one explanation then. I\u2019m extremely gifted!\u201d said Wang Teng helplessly.\u201cIndeed, my son is a genius. As expected of my son,\u201d Wang Shengguo nodded with a proud expression.\u201cWhat do you mean by your son? Didn\u2019t he come out of my womb?\u201d Li Xiumei refused to admit defeat. She glared at her husband and continued, \u201cWithout my outstanding bloodline, how can the Wang family have such a gifted child?\u201dWang Teng looked at the couple as they boasted about their outstanding bloodlines. They even pulled out their ancestors as examples.One said that their Li family had groomed a powerful official in the past, while the other reasoned that their Wang family had an amazing general ancestor.No one knew if they were speaking the truth, but Wang Teng felt that the system would definitely be unhappy.You take all the credit. What am I?Hmph!\u2026The breakfast was lively. Li Xiumei took the chance to tell Wang Shengguo what happened in the company in the past few days.\u201cBao Zeqing, that coward. He doesn\u2019t even dare to make a sound in front of me. Yet, the moment something happened to me, he sprung out like a toad and caused trouble. It looks like I have to settle the accounts with him once and for all.\u201dWang Shengguo wasn\u2019t easy to bully. This time, he was really angered by those people, so some upheaval in the company was to be expected.\u201cJia Guiren too. I treated him so well. I promoted him and gave him shares, but he was helping others under the table to destroy our company. That ungrateful fellow!\u201dWhen he talked about Jia Guiren, Wang Shengguo felt even more furious. The feeling of getting betrayed was stifling and uncomfortable. It was as if something was pressing down on his heart.\u201cForget it. Don\u2019t get too angry. At least our son managed to salvage the situation. You don\u2019t know how frightened everyone was at that time. They didn\u2019t even dare to let out a peep. Also, this time, there are gains for us too. We were able to see their true natures and know who\u2019s trustworthy and who\u2019s not,\u201d Li Xiumei said.\u201cYou\u2019re right. This is a good chance to clean up the people in the company. They have pulled many of their relatives over throughout the years, so the employees are diverse and jumbled. We can kick out useless people and get some fresh blood in.\u201d Wang Shengguo nodded in agreement.They chatted casually for some time before going back to rest.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei hadn\u2019t slept properly for many days, so they were spent. If they didn\u2019t rest soon, their bodies would collapse.In the noon, Wang Teng woke up. He laid on his bed and felt a little absent-minded.\u201cSigh!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t help but heave a long sigh.So many things had happened recently, one after another. He couldn\u2019t even have the time to rest and experience the joy of carefreely picking up attributes.He climbed down from his bed and pulled the curtains open. Sunlight shone into the room. It was a little glaring. He squinted his eyes unconsciously.Speaking of attributes, when he killed the members of the Iron Fist Clan, he had picked up quite a lot of attributes.Spirit*3Enlightenment*1.5Now, his Enlightenment had reached 98.5, and his Spirit was at 95. They were both close to a hundred.Wang Teng suddenly felt excited.\u00a0What changes would occur when these two attributes hit 100?As for the rest, they were mostly strength and speed attributes. After all, those people were just martial disciples.Most of them used blade skills, sword skills, fist skills, and other basic battle techniques. Wang Teng had already reached the peak for these skills, so no related attributes would drop anymore.But, there was one thing that surprised Wang Teng. Killing people would give blank attributes too.Blank Attribute*8These were the blank attributes the members of the Iron Fist Clan had contributed with their deaths. It was little, but Wang Teng still appreciated it.They are all good people.He had 35 blank attributes now. He contemplated for a moment and decided to save them.Ever since I was young, my teachers taught us the good habit of saving.As for his Spirit and Enlightenment, he could go to the mental hospital and the martial arts academy to gather them. He only needed a few points to reach 100. It wasn\u2019t that difficult.He scanned the attributes panel again before going downstairs. Li Xiumei and Wang Shengguo had already woken up.\u201cDad, Mom, why are you awake? Why don\u2019t you sleep more?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cWe\u2019re getting old, so we can\u2019t sleep too long,\u201d Wang Shengguo replied.\u201cOld people,\u201d Wang Teng raised his eyebrows and teased them.\u201cGet off!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, your mom is still young,\u201d Li Xiumei said as she walked out of the kitchen with the dishes.\u201cI\u2019m talking about Dad. Mom, you\u2019re forever 18,\u201d Wang Teng flattered her.\u201cYou used the word \u2018old\u2019 so smoothly. I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d Li Xiumei glanced at him from the corner of his eyes.\u2026Wang Teng was speechless. He was used to calling them this way,[1] but his mother still found faults in his words. As expected, women were all narrow-minded.They couldn\u2019t afford to provoke them!Wang Shengguo laughed secretly.\u201cOh right, your martial arts exam result should be out, right?\u201d he suddenly remembered this and asked Wang Teng.At first, he didn\u2019t have any hope, but Wang Teng had suddenly become a martial warrior. In that case, the martial arts exam was a piece of cake for him.If he didn\u2019t top the assessment, he couldn\u2019t explain his martial warrior\u2019s ability!The top student! No matter how successful he was as a businessman, achieving the first position of the cohort was still something that would bring glory to their family and ancestors.\u201cIt should be out today.\u201d Wang Teng almost forgot about it.\u201cWhat do you mean by should? If you aren\u2019t certain, hurry up and call your headteacher.\u201d Wang Shengguo was speechless.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll call and ask my classmate.\u201dHe called Lin Chuhan and asked her for the time. He confirmed that the results would be out at noon.He looked at the clock hanging on the wall. It was 11.48 am. There were still 12 minutes left. Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei could only wait anxiously.[1] (in Chinese, a way of calling mother is \u2018old woman.\u2019 This is how Wang Teng calls his mom)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Caught And Cut Into Pieces For ResearchIn the living room.\u201cSon, the time is here. Hurry up and enter your examination identity number.\u201dWang Shengguo kept staring at the clock for a long time. The instant the second hand jumped to 12:00, he urged Wang Teng.\u201cDad, is there a need to be so anxious?\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t know what to say.There was a laptop placed in front of him, and the login page was already opened on the screen. All that was left was to enter the examination identity number.\u201cHey, move to the side. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Li Xiumei was even more impatient than Wang Shengguo. She pushed Wang Teng away and took his identity card to enter the number.After verifying the information, she clicked the submit button.Language: 136Math: 141English: 143Level Inspection: Extreme martial disciple (one-star soldier level martial warrior \u2013 actual)Martial arts written: 145 (out of 150)Actual combat assessment: 100+20 (out of 100)\u2026When they saw the information on the screen, Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei weren\u2019t able to speak for a long time.Then, Li Xiumei logged out and logged in again. This time, she rechecked Wang Teng\u2019s identity number and made sure that it was the same before she clicked the submit button.The results didn\u2019t change.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei exchanged glances with each other. In the end, Wang Shengguo said, \u201cLog in again. I\u2019ll do it this time.\u201dLi Xiumei passed the identity card to him and moved away from the seat. She allowed Wang Shengguo to operate the laptop.Wang Teng: \u2026The two of them logged in three times, but Wang Teng\u2019s result didn\u2019t change at all. The numbers were still the same as before.\u201cThis is enough. Am I even your biological son? I just scored a little better, but you don\u2019t believe me at all.\u201dWang Teng rolled his eyes when he saw that they were still at it. He looked at them with an \u2018I\u2019m extremely hurt\u2019 expression.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei smiled awkwardly. They suddenly felt that they had indeed gone a little overboard there.\u201cSon, you can\u2019t blame us. Your results are hard to decipher!\u201d Wang Shengguo exclaimed.\u201cAlso, how did you manage to score so well? I never saw you studying. Tell me, did you see the exam questions beforehand?\u201d Li Xiumei leaned forward and asked him mysteriously.\u201cSeriously? Will I be able to know the questions for the university entrance exam so easily?\u201dWang Teng felt helpless. He had predicted this, though, so he could only explain patiently, \u201cAfter I started practicing martial arts, especially after I became a martial warrior, I felt that my brain started to work better and better, and my memory increased. I\u2019m able to memorize any information after reading it a few times. My brain spins furiously now. This is one of my secrets. Don\u2019t tell anyone about it.\u201cIf I get caught and get cut into pieces for research, you will lose a genius son.\u201dHe purposely sounded more serious because he hoped that his parents would cooperate with him and help him lie to outsiders.\u201cPfft, what do you mean by getting cut for research? You love to talk nonsense,\u201d Li Xiumei said angrily.\u201cI think I\u2019ve heard of a situation like yours before. Your brain started getting clearer probably due to the increase in spiritual power. Oh right, someone\u2019s daughter participated in the martial arts exam two years ago and astounded the crowd with her unexpected results.\u201d Wang Shengguo thought for a moment before touching his chin and opening his mouth.\u201cSpiritual power?!\u201d Wang Teng repeated the words. He wondered if spiritual power had anything to do with Spirit.\u201cThis thing sounds a little unreliable and magical. I\u2019m not clear on the details, but I heard that there are very few people who are born with spiritual power. They are all special talents,\u201d Wang Shengguo said confidently. It seemed that he had only heard of rumors regarding this thing.\u201cThat means that our son\u2019s condition isn\u2019t a huge secret. He might even be the special talent you mentioned.\u201d Li Xiumei heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cThat\u2019s right. However, before we ascertain the facts, let\u2019s not announce it to everyone. Let Little Teng take care of his matter himself,\u201d Wang Shengguo said.Li Xiumei nodded. She looked at the results on the screen and smiled uncontrollably.\u201cOur son\u2019s ability will probably scare a lot of people.\u201d\u201cHaha, they should be scared. I will show everyone that my son isn\u2019t worse than anyone. He is even more outstanding than the self-proclaimed geniuses out there.\u201d Wang Shengguo felt relieved and exceptionally proud. However, he didn\u2019t lose his cool. He continued, \u201cBut, we must tell other people that our Little Teng is very hardworking at home. That way, it won\u2019t sound so astonishing.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. If he\u2019s too outstanding, he might be caught and cut into pieces for research. His brain has finally started spinning faster. It\u2019d be a waste if it was cut.\u201d Li Xiumei nodded in agreement as she rubbed Wang Teng\u2019s head.Wang Teng: \u2026This feeling wasn\u2019t good.However, his parents ignored him and continued complimenting the results on the laptop screen. They couldn\u2019t get enough of it.\u201cSon, what\u2019s wrong with the result of your level inspection and your actual combat assessment?\u201d Wang Shengguo asked curiously.\u201cDuring the level inspection, I only displayed the power of an extreme martial disciple, but during the actual combat assessment, I released my true ability as a martial warrior. Governor Jiang saw it, so that might be why they added a bracket behind the result,\u201d Wang Teng explained.\u201cYou even met Governor Jiang?\u201d Wang Shengguo was flabbergasted.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cOh my god, your face is even bigger than your dad\u2019s. I have never seen Governor Jiang before,\u201d Wang Shengguo lamented in envy.\u201cOld Wang, yours is too low. Let me bring you out to see the world when I\u2019m free.\u201d Wang Teng patted Wang Shengguo\u2019s shoulder like an elder.\u201cGet off me, you little brat. Why are you laughing at your dad?\u201d Wang Shengguo slapped his hand away angrily.Then, he continued asking, \u201cWhy about your actual combat assessment result. The total score is 100, but you got an additional 20 points.\u201dWang Teng touched his chin. He guessed, \u201cMaybe they added additional points because I killed a star beast.\u201dActually, he wasn\u2019t sure either.\u201cStar beast!\u201d Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei exclaimed, \u201cWhy is there a star beast during the actual combat assessment?\u201d\u201cAn accident.\u201d Wang Teng smiled awkwardly and told the whole story.\u201cOh my god, it looks like many examinees were killed. I didn\u2019t expect the actual combat assessment to be so dangerous. Are you hurt?\u201d Li Xiumei was filled with worry when she finished listening to Wang Teng.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Look at me. That was just an accident. In the past few years, the examinees only got injured. No one died.\u201d Wang Teng hurriedly consoled his mother.\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Wang Shengguo chimed in from the side.At this moment, Wang Teng\u2019s phone rang. It was a call from Lin Chuhan.He picked up the call. \u201cHello, class monitor. How is your result?\u201d\u201cWang Teng, I passed! I actually got 80 for my actual combat assessment. 80 points, Do you know that I scored 80?!\u201dLin Chuhan\u2019s voice on the other end was filled with excitement. This was the first time Wang Teng saw her losing her composure.Wang Teng was stunned too. Lin Chuhan had only managed to kill five mutated beasts, and four of them were even low-level. Only one was a middle-level mutated beast.Also, she didn\u2019t rely on her ability to kill them. Her method could be considered a little scheming.But, she managed to achieve good results. It seemed that this result wasn\u2019t just based on the number of mutated beasts one killed. There were also other elements involved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Pfft, Shameless!Wang Teng felt happy for Lin Chuhan too. Getting into the martial arts course was her goal. With her points, she would surely enter a good university.\u201cWhat about your other subjects?\u201d asked Wang Teng.\u201cLanguage 138, Math 143, English 146, martial arts written 148.\u201d\u201cOh my god, you must be cheating!\u201d Wang Teng was sincerely astounded.Lin Chuhan\u2019s results were even higher than his. He didn\u2019t put in his entire effort, but he did cheat. However, Lin Chuhan could be on par with a cheater like him. If she wasn\u2019t a bug, what was she?On the other side, Lin Chuhan instantly felt speechless.But, she could tell that Wang Teng was amazed by her results. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a little proud.Although you are powerful, the results of my general papers are much higher than yours!She asked, \u201cHow about you? How much did you score?\u201d\u201cLanguage 136, Math 141, English 143, martial arts written 145.\u201dLin Chuhan\u2019s jaws dropped as Wang Teng told her the results of his exam one by one.After some time, she finally said, \u201cYou are the cheater.\u201dAt first, she thought she would be able to beat him with her general paper results since the gap between their abilities was too huge. That way, she could gain back some standing ground. In the end, she was the one who thought too much.This result didn\u2019t make any sense.Wang Teng could imagine Lin Chuhan\u2019s flabbergasted expression. He laughed uncontrollably.\u201cHow did you do your papers? No, I\u2019m not suspecting you. I just feel that you never study normally, so how can you score so well during the exam?\u201d Lin Chuhan asked.\u201cThat\u2019s simple. I\u2019m a genius!\u201d Wang Teng replied shamelessly.\u201cGenius is not enough to describe you. You are a monster!\u201d Lin Chuhan complained.\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201d\u201cOh right, what\u2019s the score for your actual combat assessment? It must be very high, right?\u201d Lin Chuhan asked again curiously.\u201cFull marks\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed, you are a monster. You are able to score full marks in the actual combat assessment! Wang Teng, you amaze me,\u201d Lin Chuhan exclaimed.\u201cWith an additional 20 points,\u201d Wang Teng continued.Lin Chuhan didn\u2019t know what to say anymore. Her words were stuck in her throat for a long time before they came out of her mouth. She asked, \u201cWhat the hell are additional points? And you got 20!\u201d\u201cSigh, it can\u2019t be helped. I can\u2019t hide how outstanding I am. The examiner just had to give me 20 additional points,\u201d Wang Teng said in a helpless tone.??Lin Chuhan was full of respect for Wang Teng\u2019s shamelessness. Normal people\u2019s skin couldn\u2019t be so thick.\u201cPfft, you\u2019re so thick-skinned.\u201dLin Chuhan hung up the call in frustration.When she saw her results, she wanted to share her joy with Wang Teng for some reason.However, after sharing her joy, all she got back was a basket of frustration and stimulation. This fellow was infuriating.\u2026The moment Wang Teng put down his phone, it rang again.This time, it was Yang Jian.\u201cHahaha, Wang Teng, guess how much I scored for my actual combat assessment?\u201d The moment he picked up the call, Yang Jian\u2019s duck-like laughter came from the other side of the phone.\u201c65!\u201d Wang Teng picked a number casually.\u201cErm\u2026 how did you know?\u201d Yang Jian\u2019s laughter stopped abruptly. He sounded as though he had seen a ghost.Wang Teng: \u2026Wang Teng didn\u2019t expect to hit the jackpot, either. He was just making a casual guess.\u201cWhat\u2019s so good about scoring 65 points? Why do you have to laugh so happily,\u201d Wang Teng pretended to look down on him.\u201cF**k, Wang Teng, the wearer knows best where the shoe pinches. I\u2019m delighted with my marks. At least I\u2019m able to get into the martial arts course.\u201d Yang Jian was pretty satisfied with his score. He continued, \u201cHow\u2019s your assessment?\u201dWhen Wang Teng listed out his score, the other party turned silent.\u201cBoss, you are impressive. I should get going\u2026 beep, beep, beep.\u201dHe directly hung up the call. Yang Jian was very satisfied with his results, but comparisons were always scary. Whenever there was a comparison, someone would be hurt.The harm that Wang Teng\u2019s result had on him could be calculated by the tons!\u2026\u201cWas the first caller a female student?\u201dThe moment Wang Teng hung up, Li Xiumei, who was sitting on the sofa, leaned over and asked ambiguously.Wang Teng got a fright. He patted his chest and said guiltily, \u201cIt\u2019s my table buddy.\u201d\u201cIs it the one that your dad asked Mr. Fan to arrange for you? What\u2019s her name? Lin\u2026 Lin something. She\u2019s very pretty and outstanding.\u201d Li Xiumei\u2019s eyes lit up instantly.Wang Shengguo looked over too. The expression on his face was the same as Li Xiumei\u2019s.Wang Teng knew that something bad was about to happen. He forgot that his parents knew about Lin Chuhan being his table buddy. In the end, he could only summon up his courage and reply, \u201cHer name is Lin Chuhan.\u201d\u201cOh right, Lin Chuhan. Her name sounds pretty too.\u201d Li Xiumei complimented. Then, she chuckled and said, \u201cSon, it looks like your relationship with her is not bad.\u201d\u201cMom, what are you thinking? We have been table buddies for so long. It\u2019s normal for us to have a good relationship,\u201d Wang Teng explained.\u201cI understand, I understand. It\u2019s good that your relationship with her is good. Ask her to come to our house to play someday. Mom will make good food for y\u2019all.\u201d Li Xiumei didn\u2019t continue probing. However, the expression on her face made Wang Teng feel numb. He felt that his mother was hatching a plot.Wang Teng immediately turned on his vigilance. At this moment, his phone rang again.After that, Bai Wei, Xu Jie, and his other friends called him to ask about his results one after another. When they knew that he was able to get into a top martial arts university, they congratulated him.They decided to find a time to come out and celebrate. Wang Teng agreed readily.After a few calls, Wang Teng let out a huge sigh.\u201cYour exam has ended, so you should go out and meet your friends adequately. But, the most important thing you have to do is to consider which university you want to apply to. With your results, you will be able to get into The First University if you apply for it,\u201d said Wang Shengguo.\u201cI haven\u2019t thought of the university I want to go to. Actually, our Donghai University is the no. 3 university in the country. It\u2019s a good choice too, and it\u2019s closer to home,\u201d Wang Teng said.\u201cHave you considered military academies?\u201d Wang Shengguo nodded and continued asking.\u201cThere are many restrictions in the military academies. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s suitable for me.\u201d Wang Teng was a little hesitant.As the two of them were speaking, the doorbell rang.\u201cI\u2019ll open the door.\u201dLi Xiumei stood up and walked to the main door. When she opened the door, she was surprised by the visitors. \u201cPrincipal Yu, Mr. Fan, why are you here?\u201d\u201cHahaha, the top scholar of the martial arts exam is from our school, so I\u2019m here to congratulate you,\u201d Principal Yu smiled and said.\u201cTop scholar for the martial arts exam? Our Little Teng is the top scholar for the martial arts exam?\u201dLi Xiumei was astounded and elated when she heard this news.Wang Shengguo hurriedly got up and welcomed them. \u201cPrincipal Yu, Mr. Fan, come in. Please come in.\u201d\u201cHaha, we came without informing you. Sorry to disturb you.\u201dPrincipal Yu and Mr. Fan walked in. There was a whole bunch of school leaders behind them. The scale was so large that people might think they were here to cause a ruckus.\u201cPrincipal Yu, Mr. Fan,\u201d Wang Teng got up and greeted them.\u201cLittle Teng, go and take out my tea leaves from the third layer of the cabinet in the kitchen,\u201d Wang Shengguo said to Wang Teng as he called the leaders to take a seat.\u201cMr. Wang, you have a good son!\u201d Principal Yu praised Wang Teng, who was going to the kitchen to take the tea leaves, with a huge smile on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe tea was soon served.Wang Shengguo and the school leaders chatted casually with one another while Wang Teng sat at the side with a bored expression.The atmosphere was very lively.Principal Yu and the other leaders didn\u2019t put on their stern and fierce expressions this time. Instead, they were all smiling amiably and throwing all kinds of praises on Wang Teng as though they were free, which they were.Incomparably talented, dignified-looking, promising future\u2026 They were commending him in all kinds of ways.It was amazing how they could come up with so many phrases. They were indeed well educated.After chatting about unrelated things for some time, Principal Yu turned and said to Wang Teng, \u201cWang Teng, have you decided which university you want to apply to?\u201d\u201cWe were just discussing this a moment ago,\u201d Wang Shengguo smiled and said.\u201cI haven\u2019t made my decision yet.\u201d Wang Teng shook his head.\u201cYou can slowly think about it. With your results, you can choose any school in the country anyway.\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand, you can ask the teachers in school. They have been in the education industry for many years, so they are experienced in applying for universities,\u201d Principal Yu said kindly.\u201cOkay, I will. Thank you, principal,\u201d Wang Teng replied.\u201cOh right, do you still remember the rewards I mentioned the other time?\u201d Principal Yu smiled and asked.Wang Teng immediately got excited. He sniggered and replied, \u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cYou little brat.\u201d Principal Yu pointed at him and laughed. Then, he took out a few items and placed them on the table.\u201cTake a look at it. These are all for you.\u201dThe items were laid out in a single row on the table.There was a small black string pouch.A small jade bottle.And finally, a box that was slightly smaller than a palm.Wang Teng studied all three of them.Principal Yu smiled and said, \u201cOpen them and take a look.\u201dWang Teng didn\u2019t act polite anymore. He opened the black pouch first. There were ten small crystals the size of a thumb inside, all glittering brightly.These crystals were ice-blue, and they looked as if they were made by congregating natural ice crystals. They shone brightly under the lamp.\u201cThese are energy stones!\u201dPrincipal Yu said, \u201cI heard that you are an ice element martial warrior. I especially asked someone to find ten ice element yellow-rank low-class energy stones for you. You can use them for your personal cultivation and other things.\u201dIce element martial warrior.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei exchanged glances when they heard this. They were puzzled.Wasn\u2019t Wang Teng a fire element martial warrior?But, this wasn\u2019t the time to probe further. They could only suppress their curiosity in their hearts.\u201cPrincipal, you\u2019re so thoughtful,\u201d Wang Teng exclaimed uncontrollably.Then, he opened the small jade bottle. Three dark blue pills rolled out from the bottle.When these small pills landed on his palm, a cool and refreshing fragrance wafted into his nose and made him feel invigorated.\u201cThis is ice spiritual dan. It\u2019s an ice element spiritual dan, and it\u2019s first-class low-rank. It can help with your cultivation,\u201d Principal Yu introduced the spiritual dan to him.Another ice element!Wang Teng felt that Principal Yu was an interesting guy. Once he knew that he was an ice element martial warrior, he immediately prepared all these ice element items useful for ice element martial warriors.Although they were rewards, he more or less owed him a favor.Principal Yu opened his mouth again. \u201cIf you\u2019re not in a hurry to use them, you can keep them in the jade bottle to prevent their effects from dissipating.\u201dWang Teng nodded. He placed the three pills back into the small jade bottle.The last one was the black box. This must be the mysterious gift Principal Yu was talking about. He wondered what was inside.He was already satisfied with the first two rewards, so he couldn\u2019t help but look forward to the third reward.This box was around the size of his palm. Wang Teng opened the box and noticed a pitch-black stone sitting in the middle.A bone-piercing chill was exuding from the stone.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Wang Teng asked curiously.\u201cDark ice stone!\u201dPrincipal Yu slowly said these three words, as if the dark ice stone was some precious treasure. A faint boastful aura could be felt from his expression.Unfortunately, no one present had heard of this before. Wang Teng was also looking at him in a daze.He was boasting to a bunch of people who didn\u2019t understand him at all!Principal Yu smiled awkwardly and said, \u201cThis dark ice stone is an ice element heavenly treasure. I accidentally got hold of it. It can be used to forge weapons. Speaking about it, it\u2019s a real coincidence. You\u2019re an ice element martial warrior, so this is just right for you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too small!\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t know how precious the dark ice stone was, so he complained softly when he saw its small size.\u201cCough, cough!\u201dPrincipal Yu coughed awkwardly. \u201cI only have this small dark ice stone. It\u2019s indeed a little small, but you can supplement it with other materials. I\u2019m sure that the quality of the weapon forged will increase exponentially.\u201dIf this dark ice stone wasn\u2019t so small that it couldn\u2019t forge a complete weapon, it would be impossible to evaluate its value!Principal Yu wouldn\u2019t have given it to other people either.Wang Teng furrowed his brows. He felt that this item was quite useless.Based on Principal Yu\u2019s statement, this stone was very precious. But, since it was small, its value was heavily discounted.It couldn\u2019t be used to forge a complete weapon, and it might not be suitable to act as a supplement material.After all, forging weapons wasn\u2019t just combining a bunch of different materials casually. You needed to melt the materials that complemented one another.There might be conflicts between some materials, or their compatibility might not be high.Especially for a rare material like the dark ice stone, finding highly compatible material with it was going to be a hassle.When Principal Yu noticed Wang Teng\u2019s lack of reaction for a long time, he knew that he might not have liked the reward. Hence, he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want this dark ice stone, I can change it for you.\u201dWang Teng smiled calmly. \u201cI like it. I\u2019ll take this. There\u2019s no need to change.\u201dAs he spoke, he kept the dark ice stone.Looking at the two rewards, he could tell that Principal Yu had put much effort into this.For a top scholar of the martial arts exam, the principal of Donghai No.1 High School had personally put in the effort to prepare these rewards that were suitable for him.Wang Teng was very grateful.Principal Yu immediately smiled happily when he saw Wang Teng accepting the gifts.The rewards weren\u2019t just encouragement for the outstanding students. It was an investment too.An investment in their future. Thus, if they achieved good results when they grew up, they would naturally repay their old school.He had high hopes for Wang Teng. If Wang Teng didn\u2019t like the dark ice stone, the effects of these rewards would be heavily discounted.You couldn\u2019t say that he was flattering a student even though he was the principal of Donghai No. 1. He just knew that if he missed such an outstanding student, he would regret it.Wang Teng was already a martial warrior. His achievements in the future were unimaginable.When the time came, if he was willing to give back to his old school, the repayment would exceed his rewards greatly.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you like it. I have given my rewards. I will not be disturbing you anymore.\u201d Principal Yu got up and prepared to leave.\u201cPrincipal Yu, fellow teachers, why don\u2019t you sit for a while longer?\u201d Wang Shengguo urged them to stay.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Many things are waiting for me to settle in school,\u201d Principal Yu said tactfully.Thus, Wang Shengguo sent Principal Yu and the other leaders of the school, who came along, to the entrance. He watched as they drove their cars and left. His expression was a little complicated as he stood at the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Was The Game Not Fun Anymore, Or Was The Alcohol Not Nice?After seeing Principal Yu and the school leaders off, Wang Shengguo stood at the door, a lot of emotions brewing inside him.\u201cWhy are you standing here in a daze looking as though you can die without any regrets?\u201dLi Xiumei popped her head out from his back and looked at him curiously.\u2026The atmosphere was destroyed in an instant.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wang Shengguo took a deep breath. In the end, he didn\u2019t say anything. He just walked into the living room in frustration.He saw Wang Teng examining the rewards on the table.He exclaimed, \u201cThese are not ordinary items at all. It looks like your principal put in a lot of effort this time.\u201d\u201cIf our son was not outstanding enough, why would they gift him these precious items?\u201d Li Xiumei said proudly.\u2026Wang Teng ignored his parents\u2019 boasting. As their son, he felt that he shouldn\u2019t cruelly deprive them of the only joy left in their lives.He looked at the three items in front of him, especially the dark ice stone in the box. Principal Yu said that it was extremely precious, but he didn\u2019t have an exact idea of its value.It looks like I have to find some time to research it or ask someone who knows about it.Wang Teng kept the black stone.The family of three could finally sit down and have their meal.\u2026At the same time, in Jiang City, the news that the Iron Fist Clan was annihilated couldn\u2019t stay hidden anymore.The members of the Iron Fist Clan who were out to do business had gotten lucky and managed to escape the ordeal. When they returned to their headquarters, they noticed that the main entrance was wide open and the entire building was dead silent.Then, they saw the scene that they would never be able to remove from their memory.Gruesome!Corpses covered the entire floor with a fearful expression on their faces; they didn\u2019t die peacefully.The fortunate survivors were scared out of their wits.Some people wanted to look at the surveillance footage to find out what happened, but all the cameras were destroyed. No evidence was life behind.All the cash and expensive items had disappeared.The Iron Fist Clan was left with an empty shell.\u201cThat hostage was saved by someone. Could it be someone from his side?\u201d a person suddenly said.\u201cWhether it is or not, all the advanced stage martial disciples in the headquarters have been killed. Do you think we can regain our previous standing just by ourselves?\u201d another person trembled with fear and said.\u201cAlso, the news that the Iron Fist Clan has been annihilated will spread soon. Our enemies won\u2019t let us go so easily.\u201d\u201cWhere are those people from Capital Xia? They have a martial warrior among them. If it\u2019s really done by the hostage\u2019s men, the plight of our Iron Fist Clan is all caused by them.\u201d\u201cAre you planning to find them for revenge?\u201d Someone sneered.\u201cLet\u2019s disperse. The Iron Fist Clan no longer exists\u2026\u201d someone said weakly.Everyone\u2019s gazes landed on that guy. He laughed awkwardly and said, \u201cI\u2019m just making a casual suggestion. Don\u2019t look at me.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s disperse.\u201d\u201cRight, let\u2019s disperse.\u201d\u201cGoodbye, everyone. I hope that I won\u2019t see any of you again in the future\u2026\u201dEveryone scattered in an instant. They left without showing any signs of hesitation. Only the person who came up with the suggestion was left standing on the spot in a daze.\u2026\u201cThe Iron Fist Clan is gone.\u201dIn a hotel\u2019s luxurious presidential suite in Jiang City, a man spoke.In front of this middle-aged man, a twenty years old young man with short hair was sitting on a chair. He was wearing a bathrobe and swirling the wine glass in his hand.The red wine in the glass spun lightly. The young man said calmly, \u201cOh?\u201d\u201cI made a trip personally. Almost everyone was killed with a single blow, including the advanced stage martial disciples.\u201cThe boss of the Iron Fist Clan is also gone. However, there are burnt marks found at the scene,\u201d the middle-aged man continued.\u201cMartial warrior?\u201cFire element martial warrior?\u201dThe young man raised his eyebrows. He finished the red wine in his hand in a single gulp.\u201cThat is my guess too,\u201d the middle-aged man nodded and replied.\u201cPfft, let\u2019s go back to Capital Xia. Let other people take care of these miscellaneous things. I\u2019m irritated.\u201d The young man stretched his back and scoffed.\u201cAren\u2019t you\u2026 going to act?\u201d The middle-aged man asked.\u201cI said that I\u2019m going back to Capital Xia!\u201d the young man said coldly.\u201cYes!\u201d\u2026Wang Teng didn\u2019t know the scenes going on in Jiang City.Regarding Wang Shengguo\u2019s predicament, he knew from the boss of the Iron Fist Clan that the other party was from Capital Xia.In his previous life, the people that had wiped the Wang family were from Capital Xia too.Although the timing wasn\u2019t right, it was most likely the same people.This was the martial arts era, and there was a martial warrior on the opposite side\u2026 That made sense. Based on how powerful they were, they would definitely have a martial warrior.In front of them, the Wang family was as weak as an ant.But, he was the variable.Now, Wang Teng was the top scholar of the martial arts exam. Even Governor Jiang knew who he was.The other party wouldn\u2019t dare to touch the Wang family easily. The Wang family wouldn\u2019t have any life-threatening danger in Donghai.If not, the headlines the next day would be\u2014The top scholar of the martial arts exam in Donghai got exterminated?This wasn\u2019t just a slap to Donghai\u2019s face. It was a challenge to the authority of China\u2019s law. No matter how powerful the other party was, they couldn\u2019t act without any fear.Hence, the Wang family was temporarily safe.However, he still needed to guard against the other party\u2019s secret acts. As long as it was within the rules, these acts were allowed.The Wang family wasn\u2019t able to evade it.Wang Shengguo and Wang Teng\u2019s grandfather were all wily old foxes in the business world. Naturally, they wouldn\u2019t sit and wait for their enemies to look for them without making any preparations.Wang Teng didn\u2019t have to worry about the company.Now, what he needed to do was to increase his capabilities as fast as possible. If he was powerful enough, he could kill all his enemies with a single slash of his sword.The only thing that Wang Teng couldn\u2019t understand was how the Wang family managed to provoke those people. After all, the other party had a huge and powerful background.He asked Wang Shengguo the same question before, but his father didn\u2019t know the answer. He was kidnapped for no reason, so he was utterly confused too.\u2026At this moment, Wang Teng met Xu Jie and his other friends in a quiet bar. There were beers, fruit juices, and all kinds of snacks on the table.They were all chatting and laughing.\u201cTop scholar for the martial arts exam!\u201d suddenly, Xu Jie shouted in surprise.The three of them stared at Wang Teng in astonishment. Before this, they had heard that his result was not bad, but they only knew that he was the top scholar now.This\u2026For a moment, they just stared at each other, not knowing what to say.Wang Teng was already used to this kind of reaction. Everyone who heard the piece of news for the first time would be dumbstruck.Sigh, he was a failure!Fortunately, the system didn\u2019t abandon him.Wang Teng sighed in his heart. He started eating snacks all alone and let the trio continue their astonishment. After they regained their senses, they would continue the conversation.A few minutes later, the three people finally snapped back to their senses.\u201cCongratulations, Brother Wang Teng!\u201d Xu Jie said in a complicated tone.In the past, they were all useless and cocky rich second generations in other people\u2019s eyes. But now, Wang Teng had soared up into the sky with one leap. Xu Jie felt hurt.Wasn\u2019t it good to stay together like a loving family and fail the exam together?Was the game not fun anymore, or was the wine not nice?Why did he need to immerse himself in his studies? Why did he become the star student that he always hated?Xu Jie started doubting his life. The lonely feeling of being abandoned engulfed his entire body, and a dark grey aura spread around him.Wang Teng: \u2026Bai Wei: \u2026Yu Hao: \u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

For some time, he felt poor in spirit.He had already decided to repeat his year three and practice his martial arts properly. He must take the martial arts exam next year.He wasn\u2019t unhappy that Wang Teng managed to pass. He was just a little envious.Actually, he had predicted this result beforehand. After all, Wang Teng had already displayed the ability of an advanced stage martial disciple in front of him.But, this time, Wang Teng scored a little too well, so well that he started doubting his life.Their results used to be equal. Now, one had to repeat his year, while the other managed to get into a university.Even so, he still had the hope that he would catch up with him and not lagged too far behind.However, if Wang Teng got into a university like The First University, he knew that no matter how hard he worked, he would never be able to catch up. The distance caused him to feel despair.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, you\u2019re really a monster. I don\u2019t dare to compare myself to you.\u201d Xu Jie sighed and took a huge swig of beer.\u201cDon\u2019t think like that. If you don\u2019t compare, how do you know that you won\u2019t be able to beat me?\u201d Wang Teng said.1Xu Jie thought that Wang Teng was consoling him and felt a little happy. But, unexpectedly, Wang Teng continued, \u201cYou will only know that you can\u2019t win after you have compared.\u201dXu Jie: \u2026\u201cYou don\u2019t have to console me, but why are you hurting me? Can we still be good friends?\u201d\u201cOnly friends will tell you the truth. Trust me, life isn\u2019t just about resigning to circumstances now. There\u2019s also resignation to fate in the future,\u201d Wang Teng said.\u201cPfft!\u201dBai Wei spat out a mouth of fruit juice when she heard this sentence.Yu Hao choked and coughed without stopping.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, the saying goes like this: \u2018Life isn\u2019t just about resigning to circumstance now, there\u2019s also poetry and the future.\u201d Bai Wei rolled her eyes at Wang Teng. Why didn\u2019t she notice how cheeky he was in the past?\u201cI\u2019m comforting Xu Jie. After all, there are many stimulations in life. He needs to get used to them earlier. After a few shocks, you will get used to them,\u201d Wang Teng said.There was a ball of air stuck in Xu Jie\u2019s chest. He felt extremely frustrated. His pupils moved, and he suddenly said, \u201cMy sister is coming back soon.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dThis time, it was Wang Teng\u2019s turn to put on an ugly expression. His face changed immediately. It was quite interesting to watch.Xu Jie smiled naughtily.\u201cSister Xu Hui is back?\u201d Bai Wei was pleasantly surprised.\u201cThat female devil!\u201d Wang Teng gritted his teeth.Xu Hui was Xu Jie\u2019s older sister. They had known each other since they were children, but the memories weren\u2019t very good\u2026Anyone who got their pants taken off and their little bird flicked when they were a child wouldn\u2019t have any fond memory about it!1No, he must stay as far away from her as possible.He mustn\u2019t let the devil see him. If not, he couldn\u2019t predict what she might do.\u201cBrother Wang Teng, my sister has always been talking about you. She even said that after she returns, she must drag you out for a meetup,\u201d Xu Jie said.Bai Wei and Yu Hao sniggered at the side. They never had this kind of treatment before. Xu Hui always treated Wang Teng exceptionally well (in reality, she always tormented him).Wang Teng\u2019s face turned green. \u201cI\u2019m not free. Tell her that I\u2019m not free. Don\u2019t look for me if there\u2019s nothing important.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t make the decision. If she goes to your house to look for you, I can\u2019t help you.\u201d Xu Jie shrugged.\u201cOh shit!\u201d Wang Teng said in frustration.\u201cI don\u2019t have shit, but I have an older sister!\u201d Xu Jie smiled evilly.He felt that he had finally gained some of his ego back. He felt comfortable for some reason.He had no pressure betraying his older sister!Bai Wei and Yu Hao burst out laughing. It was hard to make Wang Teng suffer a setback. This kind of interesting scene rarely occurred.After fooling around for some time, Bai Wei asked, \u201cI heard that Sister Xu Hui has already reached the peak of an advanced stage martial disciple. Is she at her breakthrough now?\u201d\u201cShe successfully advanced to martial warrior half a month ago.\u201d Xu Jie was a little proud. He said enthusiastically, \u201cAfter she comes back this time, I plan to ask her to train me properly. I don\u2019t have much hope of becoming an advanced stage martial disciple, but I must become an intermediate stage martial disciple.\u201d\u201cMartial warrior!\u201d Wang Teng was a little surprised. His memory of Xu Hui stopped at his past life. He didn\u2019t expect the female devil to be a martial warrior in this life.Damn it, she would be harder to deal with!This was what he was thinking, but he said, \u201cWith a martial warrior guiding you and the resources your family is putting on you, there\u2019s a high chance that you will become an intermediate stage martial disciple within a year.\u201d\u201cI hope so. When my dad heard that I wanted to practice martial arts, he was so happy that he couldn\u2019t sleep for an entire night. He even decided to take out his private savings to sponsor me,\u201d Xu Jie smiled and said.Wang Teng gave him a thumbs-up. \u201cUncle Xu is amazing. He\u2019s able to have a private stash under the eyes of your mom.\u201d\u201cCough, cough!\u201dXu Jie was caught between laughter and tears.\u00a0Your point of concern is a little off.\u201cXu Jie, we can practice together. After Sister Xu Hui comes back, can you ask her to teach me too?\u201d Yu Hao said in anticipation.\u201cThis is a small matter. You can just come to my house in the future,\u201d Xu Jie said generously.Bai Wei listened to them discussing martial arts at the side. Suddenly, she felt a little depressed. Even Xu Jie had a target. What about her?Wang Teng would be entering university soon as the top scholar of the martial arts exam. He would definitely soar higher in the future. Would she only be able to watch him fly?Bai Wei questioned her own heart. For a second, she was speechless.\u2026They chatted until late at night.Wang Teng only returned home past 11 pm. He took a bath and directly hit the bed.2His Spirit was close to 100. Wang Teng planned to go to the mental hospital and collect another round of attributes.However, it was hard to sneak into the mental hospital in the day, so he could only secretly enter after midnight.But, his university entrance exam had just ended. It was a rare relaxing moment for him, so he decided to wait for a few days first. The mental hospital wouldn\u2019t run away.A silent night.The next day, Wang Teng went to the house he had rented in the university town. The crow egg still looked the same. There were no signs of hatching at all.He sent a WeChat message to the beautiful shop owner, Lu Zhiqing, whom he met at the pet shop.Lu Zhiqing: It\u2019s normal. Don\u2019t worry. The oviparous animals now have a more complicated hatching process after being influenced by Force. Their developmental cycle is longer.Wang Teng pondered for a moment. Normal animals were already like this, much less the egg of a star beast. It was reasonable that its hatching process would be longer. He decided to let it take its time.Wang Teng: Alright. Thank you!Wang Teng replied with a WeChat message to express his gratitude.Lu Zhiqing: I should be the one thanking you. If you hadn\u2019t saved me in the past, I would definitely have gotten hurt\u2026\u201dLu Zhiqing hesitated for a moment before she sent the next message.Lu Zhiqing: Are you free? Let me treat you to a meal.Wang Teng: There\u2019s no need for that. Anyone else will do the same thing.Wang Teng felt embarrassed. If the other party knew that the giant crow came to Donghai because of him and everything that happened after that was his fault, how would she feel?Lu Zhiqing: There\u2019s a need for it. If you don\u2019t let me treat you, this will always be on my mind.Lu Zhiqing\u2019s tone seemed serious.Wang Teng: Alright\u2026 you can tell me the address and the time. We\u2019ll meet and have a casual meal. There\u2019s no need to spend too much.Wang Teng felt helpless, but he still agreed. This beautiful sister was a little straightforward!But\u2026 since she was a beauty, he could feast his eyes. It would be a waste if he didn\u2019t go for the meal!Lu Zhiqing: Alright, it\u2019s decided then!Lu Zhiqing hurriedly sent the time and the address over. She seemed to have prepared it long ago.Yida Plaza.Wang Teng looked at the address and the time. It was good for him.He replied: Okay, I will be on time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Complete Martial Arts AttributesCH 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the afternoon, Wang Teng arrived at a seafood buffet restaurant as planned on the fourth floor of Yida Plaza.He scanned the restaurant and saw Lu Zhiqing waving at him. He nodded at her and walked over.Wang Teng said, \u201cWhy are you so early!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the one treating, so I have to come early.\u201d Lu Zhiqing pulled her hair back and smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re too polite. Actually, there\u2019s no need to do this. You also answered my queries on the incubation of eggs. Actually, I\u2019ll still have to trouble you in the future.\u201d.\u201cLet\u2019s stop thanking each other. If you have any questions, go ahead and ask me. Come, let\u2019s take a look at the food first.\u201d Lu Zhiqing passed the menu to Wang Teng.The two of them ordered some dishes.The service of this restaurant was fast. The dishes they ordered came continuously. Wang Teng and Lu Zhiqing chatted as they ate the seafood.Suddenly, Wang Teng heard something and asked in surprise, \u201cDo you know about mutated beasts and star beasts too?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s hard to do pet business now. More and more people are raising mutated beasts. They want to appear high-class, so I also have to focus on high-class products related to mutated beasts and star beasts,\u201d Lu Zhiqing said.\u201cThat\u2019s not easy. Mutated beasts and star beasts can be fatal. You are just a normal person. It will be hard for you to handle them.\u201d Wang Teng frowned.\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t plan to sell large-sized mutated beasts. I\u2019ll target the small ones, and they can only be cubs. Actually, mutated beasts are similar to normal animals. If you start training them when they are cubs, they won\u2019t normally harm their master,\u201d Lu Zhiqing replied.\u201cSome are naturally ferocious. You need to be careful.\u201d Wang Teng didn\u2019t say much and just reminded her.\u201cOkay, I will take note of it.\u201d Lu Zhiqing nodded and smiled.Both of them enjoyed the meal. Wang Teng and Lu Zhiqing\u2019s relationship got slightly closer. In the past, they were just acquaintances, but now, they could be considered friends.At least Wang Teng felt that he was able to look for Lu Zhiqing and asked about incubation matters more comfortably now.\u201cIf you need any help in the future, you can look for me,\u201d Wang Teng said to Lu Zhiqing before they parted.\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t be polite with you.\u201d Lu Zhiqing smiled.She had already witnessed Wang Teng\u2019s ability, so she knew how important this connection was.After the two of them bade farewell, Wang Teng went back home.However, he didn\u2019t expect the atmosphere at home to be so strange.The three principals of the top three martial arts academies in Donghai were sitting in his living room right now, staring at each other awkwardly.Wang Shengguo and Li Xiumei sat at the side, looking at each other in silence.Donghai was one of the top few important cities in China. The principals of the top three martial arts academies were not only powerful, but they also held great influence.You could say that they were part of the upper echelon of Donghai.You could even say that they had control over the city.The status of the Wang family was nothing compared to them. It was like the difference between an elephant and an ant.Hence, Wang Shengguo was in a dilemma. He couldn\u2019t afford to offend any one of them.When they saw Wang Teng coming home, the two of them heaved a sigh of relief. Wang Shengguo said, \u201cMy son is back. Why don\u2019t you all look for him?\u201dHe pushed the burden smoothly without any hesitation.Wang Teng immediately felt the gazes of the principals landing on him. They were so intense that it felt as though they wanted to peel off his skin.Cough, cough.Bosses, I\u2019m not gay!\u201cWang Teng, let\u2019s not beat around the bush. Today, the three of us have come for you. You can take a look at our conditions and make a decision.\u201d The principal of Leiting Martial House was an impatient guy. He couldn\u2019t accept indecisive people, so he was very straightforward.\u201cThat\u2019s right. A martial warrior should be decisive. Look at our proposals and choose your academy,\u201d Fu Tiandao agreed and said.He didn\u2019t mention that Wang Teng was already a martial disciple of Jixin Martial House. After all, martial disciples and martial warriors were different. He wouldn\u2019t use this to confuse Wang Teng.Also, even if he was a martial warrior of Jixin Martial House, he could still be snatched by other martial academies. Ultimately, it depended on everyone\u2019s conditions.The one who could give better conditions would be the winner.Wang Teng was the top scholar of the martial arts exam, and he had become a martial warrior at such a young age. The three principals were determined to get him.Talents were rare in the martial warriors\u2019 era.Incredible talents were even rarer.There were less than ten people in China who were able to become martial warriors at his age. This was the sum of all the recent years combined.The most important thing was, most of these young people came from martial warrior families. They had ample resources with personal guidance from martial warriors.Wang Teng couldn\u2019t be compared with them. Also, he was able to kill a star beast not long after he became a martial warrior.Based on what they knew, only one or two of those talents were able to achieve this. Most of them just followed behind their seniors and gained experience. They didn\u2019t do much.This was why they had high hopes for Wang Teng\u2019s future.He had high potential and he was powerful. His background wasn\u2019t very complicated either. Who wouldn\u2019t like him?Thus, the three of them asked their superiors for the best conditions and benefits they could offer. Bargaining wouldn\u2019t work in this case.They immediately gave Wang Teng the best they could at the first meeting. It was a game of who was more daring.Wang Teng smiled when he saw them being so direct and giving the \u2018we are very rich, you can ask for anything\u2019 expression.\u201cBoss, have some tea.\u201dWang Teng sat down in front of them and poured tea for them. Then, he asked the question he had in his mind, \u201cWill there be a conflict between the martial arts academy and the school?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about this. The school is a public organization. It will not conflict with the interest of the martial arts academy. Even if you apply for a military college where the rules are stringent, we will let you prioritize your college. All these can be written in the proposal. Many powerful warriors in colleges and even the military have their names under our academy,\u201d Fu Tiandao explained.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Jiang Hong and Gu Hefei nodded in agreement.Wang Teng nodded. He picked up the three proposals on the table and took a look. The names of the three martial arts academies were written on the top.He skipped the first proposal that Jixin Martial House prepared and looked at Leiting Martial House\u2019s proposal first.The principals of Leiting Martial House and Bailian Martial House raised eyebrows immediately.This was unequal treatment.It was obvious that Wang Teng preferred Jixin Martial House.He read their proposals first and left the Jixin Martial House\u2019s proposal for the last.If the three proposals had similar content, Wang Teng would definitely choose Jixin Martial House.This was indeed the case. After all, Wang Teng had been training at Jixin Martial House for some time, so he was familiar with the environment there.Fu Tiandao saw Wang Teng picking up Jixin Martial House\u2019s proposal and reading it silently after he finished scrolling through the other two proposals. He raised his eyebrows at Jiang Hong and Gu Hefei. A confident and delighted smile appeared at the corner of his lips.Jiang Hong and Gu Heifei instantly had a bad feeling.Wang Teng finally finished reading all the proposals. He put down the proposals in his hand and sighed. Everyone\u2019s gaze landed on him.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Wang Shengguo asked agitatedly. Actually, he really wanted to look at the content of the proposals.\u201cMr. Wang can take a look too.\u201d Fu Tiandao smiled and passed the proposals to him.After Wang Shengguo finished reading them, he knew that Wang Teng probably had already made his decision. If it was him, he would make the same decision too.\u201cI choose Jixin Martial House.\u201d As expected, Wang Teng said his answer without any hesitation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: SSS Grade Proposal By Jixin Martial House\u201cI choose Jixin Martial House!\u201dThe moment Wang Teng finished speaking, the principals of Leiting Martial House and Bailian Martial House turned silent.Fu Tiandao laughed loudly. \u201cGuys, thank you.\u201d\u201cCan we take a look at your proposal?\u201d Jiang Hong asked unwillingly.He needed to know why he lost.Gu Hefei looked at Fu Tiandao with the same expression.The three martial arts academies were competitors. Any lost talents were their loss.\u201cPlease,\u201d Fu Tiandao said nonchalantly.The two principals instantly took Jixin Martial House\u2019s proposal and leaned together. They read the proposal quickly.\u201cFu Tiandao, you\u2019re insane!\u201d Jiang Hong\u2019s eyes turned wide with astonishment when he saw the proposal.\u201cDo you know what this proposal means?\u201d Gu Hefei couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cI gave this proposal to the headquarters, and our president approved it personally. That\u2019s how it got decided. What do you think? Do you accept defeat?\u201d Fu Tiandao asked.\u201cYour president approved it personally!\u201d\u201cYou win.\u201d\u201cImpressive.\u201dThe two of them exchanged glances. They could only show their respect.What was the difference?When they reported their proposal to the headquarters, they wasted much saliva before they finally managed to get this S-grade proposal.What about Jixin Martial House?They immediately gave the highest level SSS-grade proposal.The difference only seemed to be two levels, but it was a chasm.In their memories, the top three martial arts academies had only approved 23 SS-grade proposals in the past few years. Now, these people were all powerful characters.All of them had the potential to reach the general stage!Actually, the principals also wanted to apply for the SS-grade proposal for Wang Teng. They felt that Wang Teng had this potential.But, the people above had their doubts.They felt that the future was full of accidents and probabilities. They should invest in talent, but they mustn\u2019t invest too much at once.Hence, they suggested giving him the S-grade proposal first. After he entered their martial arts academy, they would observe him for some time. If his performance was outstanding, they would consider changing his proposal to SS-grade.Most of the talents that signed an SS-grade proposal went through this route. Very few of them were offered SS-grade proposals right away.As for SSS-grade proposals, there were less than five of them.Those five people were all general-stage martial warriors now!All of them were younger than 35 years old, so they would definitely become important pillars of China in the future.This was the difference!Jixin Martial House gave Wang Teng an SSS-grade proposal, while Leiting Martial House and Bailian Martial House could only give an S-grade proposal.They appeared a little stingy in comparison.Jiang Hong and Gu Hefei felt a little dejected. They had no mood to compare anymore.\u201cThat\u2019s vicious of you!\u201dBut, they still glared at Fu Tiandao.The two of them were a little embarrassed. They said to Wang Teng, \u201cWe\u2019re sorry for our proposals.\u201dThey had witnessed Wang Teng\u2019s actual combat assessment personally and were confident about his future. Unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t make the decision alone.It was a pity that they missed this talent!\u201cYou\u2019re being too polite. I\u2019m grateful that you think so highly of me,\u201d Wang Teng replied hurriedly.The two principals felt much better because of Wang Teng\u2019s modesty. Fu Tiandao nodded his head secretly when he saw this scene at the side.Displaying his skills when he should and keeping humble at the right time\u2014this was the indication of a good character.He was delighted with Wang Teng\u2019s performance.\u201cSince you have already made your decision, we won\u2019t disturb you anymore.\u201d The two of them got up and left.After sending them off, Wang Teng came back to the living room.\u201cSign this proposal in case accidents happen,\u201d Fu Tiandao said.\u201cPrincipal Fu, do you have so much confidence in me?\u201d Wang Teng wasn\u2019t in a hurry. Instead, he asked him back.\u201cHaha, I\u2019m not the only one who has confidence in you. Our president has high hopes for you too. You have been training in our martial arts academy. Don\u2019t think that you can hide it from me.\u201d Fu Tiandao smiled mysteriously.Wang Teng\u2019s heart skipped a beat.\u201cBut, you don\u2019t have to worry. Everyone has their secrets, especially martial warriors; they have even more secrets.\u201d Fu Tiandao seemed to know what he was thinking, so he reassured him indifferently.Wang Teng didn\u2019t say much. He signed his name on the proposal.Fu Tiandao nodded in satisfaction. He passed a black wristwatch to Wang Teng.\u201cThis is the Force wristwatch invented by the martial warriors. It is made of a special material and won\u2019t get affected by water or fire. It can even withstand the attack from a martial warrior without breaking.\u201d\u201cOnce you enter your personal information, you can log in to our martial arts academy\u2019s internal web\u2014Jixin.\u201cThe billion-dollar worth of resources mentioned in the proposal will be transferred into your account batch by batch. You can buy the resources you want from our martial arts academy\u2019s internal web.\u201cBut, you must consider carefully. Don\u2019t waste this huge amount of money. If you fully utilize it, you can significantly enhance your skills.\u201cAlso, you have three chances to seek guidance from our president. This is a rare opportunity. Many talents aren\u2019t able to get this chance. You should take advantage of it.\u201cFinally, this is the right to purchase a house in \u2018Deer Garden.\u2019 The people living there are all family members of martial warriors. The \u2018Deer Garden\u2019 is under the name of the top three martial arts academies, so the security there is very high. So far, no one has dared to create trouble there. I know that your family met some trouble recently, so if you move there, you won\u2019t have to worry about their safety.\u201dWang Teng listened with rapt attention. These were all written in the proposal, but Fu Tiandao\u2019s reminder was worth pondering over.The offers were all generous, especially the last one. It was just what he wanted. If his parents moved to \u2018Deer Garden,\u2019 he would feel more at ease too.Li Xiumei hadn\u2019t looked at the proposal just now, so when she heard Fu Tiandao\u2019s explanation, she was flabbergasted.A billion dollars worth of resources!Her son\u2019s assets had surpassed her husband\u2019s many years of hard work. It was hard not to be astounded.Were martial warriors all so wealthy?Wang Shengguo felt a little depressed. By right, getting surpassed by your son should be a happy thing\u2026But, this money was so easy to earn!It was so easy that it stimulated him greatly!However, the right to purchase a house at \u2018Deer Garden\u2019 caused his eyes to light up too. A man was only able to move forward without worry if his family was safe.\u201cYou will need to apply for your university tomorrow. Have you decided which one you want to go to?\u201d Fu Tiandao asked.\u201cNot yet. I looked at the cut-off point of the universities this year. I think I\u2019ll be able to get into all of them,\u201d said Wang Teng.After the result came out, all the schools had released their cut-off points immediately.The martial arts exam was different from the normal university entrance exam. For the normal university entrance exam, the cut-off points for the schools would only be released after the application process. Many students couldn\u2019t apply for the right universities and weren\u2019t able to get into the universities they wanted. It was a pity.As for the martial arts exam, the schools weren\u2019t the only ones choosing the students. The students were choosing the universities too. Thus, the cut-off points were released early.\u201cWith your score, you won\u2019t have a problem entering any university. The problem is choosing the one that\u2019s most suitable for you. Your exam result has already been sent to all the top universities. As long as they are not blind, I believe that they will look for you soon. They might even look for you at your school tomorrow,\u201d Fu Tiandao smiled and said.\u201cThat\u2019s so troublesome.\u201d Wang Teng gave a bitter smile. He suddenly thought of something and asked, \u201cPrincipal, do you have any suggestions?\u201dFu Tiandao smiled and replied, \u201cThe resources, atmosphere, and ability of the teachers of the top few universities are all around the same.\u201cResources are earned through competition. The more outstanding a person is, the more resources the country would distribute to him. Hence, good students never lack resources.\u201cIn recent years, the Donghai University and the Huanghai Military College are inching their way up. There\u2019s not much difference between them and The First University. They were even able to beat the other universities in the martial arts grand competition a few times and claimed the championship.\u201cComparing the military college and normal universities, military colleges are stricter. They have more control over the student\u2019s freedom, but there\u2019s an advantage.\u201dFu Tiandao paused for a moment at this point. He only continued when he saw Wang Teng looking over.\u201cThe military college is a quick route to gain power. If you are outstanding enough and you earn military exploits, you might be able to take charge of an army in the future. You will have great influence.\u201cEspecially in the Xingwu Continent. I don\u2019t mind telling you that we are currently forming large troops. We need to send fresh troops there urgently\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
