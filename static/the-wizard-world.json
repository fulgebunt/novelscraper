    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: ReincarnationTranslator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThere were no white clouds that could be seen in the endless sky, making it seem like a borderless blue gem.Several black-colored birds flew across the sky; a large forest underneath them looked verdant and thriving. There were many twisted small paths between the trees. A carriage with golden straws was moving forwards in a slow pace, and you could even hear the rhythmic echoes of the hooves stomping on the ground.There was a teenager lying over the golden straws on the carriage. Judging by his appearance, he was about thirteen- or fourteen-years old. The teenager had short brown hair, and he had an average-looking appearance.The teenager\u2019s eyes were closed as though he was sleeping. The coachman at the front was driving carefully with his old horse. It seemed that the coachman was trying not to interrupt the teenager\u2019s dream as he tried to steer the carriage skillfully.BANG!!!With a loud noise, the wheels of the carriage toppled over a sharp stone on the road. The whole carriage stopped after the collision.Ye Song was woken up by the commotion. He opened his eyes slowly, and his scrunched face was of a yellow hue just like wax.\u201cWhere am I?\u201d The teenager asked; his voice was very faint and it sounded weak.He inhaled once; he could smell the fragrance of lush green grass. The teenager looked at his surroundings in confusion.\u201cI apologize for disrupting your sweet dream, Second Young Master Angele. The carriage collided on a stone.\u201d The coachman turned back and apologized after he saw Ye Song was woken up by the accident. He took out his tools and started to check if the wheels were damaged by the stone.The coachman was past his prime, yet he still looked strong and full of vigor in his grey linen outfit.\u201cSecond Young Master Angele?\u201d Ye Song was confused; he looked around, thinking the coachman was talking to someone else, but he was the only one there.\u201cThat\u2019s me?\u201d He pointed his finger towards his nose.\u201cYes, Second Young Master.\u201d The coachman nodded while checking the wheels.\u201cYou just fell off the horse and got hurt pretty badly. You need more rest. I was the only one left in the city, and I could not find a decent carriage for you. I am sorry you have to lie on this.\u201d The middle-aged man smiled at Ye; his skin looked well-tanned by the sun.It seemed like Ye Song realized something as his facial expression changed.\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Ye whispered to himself and looked at his body.The hunting suit he was wearing fitted him very well, and he also had a red belt around his waist. There was a black leather whip tied to his belt.His body was weak, and his palm white. He could also feel the pain coming from his knees and the back of his head.Suddenly, bunch of memories flashed in Ye Song\u2019s mind after a strong pain hit his head. Ye Song fell straight down to the straws as he lost his consciousness; he could hear the coachman yelling in panic.Ye Song finally woke up slowly after some time passed. His brain was filled with memories from someone else\u2019s. The second son of some random countryside noble family was named Angele Rio, and apparently the guy was just an average noble child from the family.Angele was riding on his horse with his gang during his free time before falling off it. Ye Song took over his body at that moment. Ye Song also gained some of Angele\u2019s memories, and he had a basic understanding of the current situation.The world was identical to the Medieval Europe he knew. Right now, he was in a country called the Rudin Empire. It was a huge country, and Rio Family was actually a relatively rich noble family at the countryside, but it still cannot be compared to those in the inner parts of the country.Rio Family\u2019s territory was at the edge of a large forest in the Yala Province. According to Angele\u2019s memory, the only thing Ye Song knew was that his father Baron Rio\u2019s territory included three knights\u2019 lands and five towns. There were about five thousand people living there, and it would take some time to go from one side to the other with a horse, which is about an hour. It was a huge territory.Angele Rio was the second son of Baron Rio, and his standing was the highest among the younger generation in the Rio Family. The eldest son left the family and joined the army; if he does not come back, it is very likely that Angele would be the one to take over the family after.\u201cA child from a noble family\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I reincarnated\u2026\u201d Ye Song scratched his head, and realized he was lying down on a small bed. His clothes had been changed to a white robe, and was covered by a thin layer of white blanket.The bedroom was bright and spacious. There were two high chairs, one bed, and a writing desk painted white in the room. The window facing the bed was opened, and Ye Song could hear some noise coming from the streets.The wind brought the aroma of pancakes into the room. Ye Song felt really hungry after getting a whiff of such redolence in.\u201cIs anyone here?\u201d Ye Song knew this was the family\u2019s only house in the town according to Angele\u2019s memory.The door was opened with a squeaky sound. A middle-aged man in a red noble suit with a serious face walked in quickly. He was holding a small silver bowl and there was an appetizing smell of meat coming from it.\u201cAngele, do you feel better?\u201d The man walked to the bed while knitting his eyebrows. He put the small bowl on the bedside cabinet, and touched Ye Song\u2019s forehead with his large palm.\u201cNot hot anymore. Drink the meat soup, you are way too weak right now.\u201d The man said.Ye Song quickly found out who the man was through Angele\u2019s memory.Karl Rio, the current leader in the Rio Family and the baron of the territory. Though he was just a great father in the memories of Angele.\u201cI think I told you before,\u201d Baron Karl lowered his voice, \u201cstay away from those punks from the city, even if you are classmates in the knight\u2019s courses. Don\u2019t even play with them.\u201d The baron said.\u201cIt is all my fault, father.\u201d Ye Song said with a faint voice, and he lowered his head. It was not out of Ye Song\u2019s intention to do this. It was more like a reflex from the body\u2019s original owner.\u201cYou were lucky you didn\u2019t break any bone after falling off from a horse that went berserk.\u201d The baron said, and he seemed to have relaxed a bit. He saw his son lowering his own head and could feel his son\u2019s sadness.\u201cYour elder brother left the family and joined the army, I am not even sure if he will come back. You are the hope of Rio family. I can\u2019t imagine what will happen if you get hurt again\u2026\u201d The baron sighed, and stopped talking.Ye Song knew the baron\u2019s personality from Angele\u2019s memory. He was a strong baron when facing others; he was also cold-blooded and strict. Many people in the family had been ordered to be executed due to some small mistakes they committed. The baron also took many beautiful women into the family from his territory, and he has had many kids.More importantly, he made a series of plans last year, and he used his army to take over a large land. His territory size now became twice the original.Outsiders often gossiped about how cruel and strong the baron was. They gossiped about his insidiousness and his cold-blooded heart. However, the baron was treating Angele very well because he loved Angele\u2019s mother so much before she passed away. He held special feelings for her. Thus, Angele\u2019s standing was the highest among his brothers and sisters. The baron would try to give Angele whatever he wanted.\u201cRemember, Angele. No matter what, as the future leader of the Rio Family, you should think twice before doing anything.\u201d Baron Karl advised Ye Song with a deep voice.\u201cI will, father.\u201d Ye Song nodded seriously.\u201cWell, not Catherine though, that other girl you wanted before. I have sent her to your room. You can play with her, but you are still very young, if I find out you are addicted to this\u2026\u201d The baron stopped for a second, and Ye Song could see the coldness from his eyes, \u201cyou know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Ye Song nodded quickly; he felt scared for a second. Though the baron loved him so much, this time he had done something unacceptable.\u201cAlright, get some rest after you finish the soup. I still have some things that I have to deal with. Old Wade will send someone to bring you back to the castle. I have to leave now.\u201d The baron said as left right away.Before the door of the bedroom was closed, Ye Song took a peek at the fully armored knight outside. He knew the knight; the best warrior the baron had, Knight Audis. Knight Audis loved to stomp on the enemy\u2019s heads and smash them into pulp like watermelons. People in the territory called him \u201cDevil Knight\u201d.The door of the bedroom was forcefully closed. Ye Song could hear the baron and the knight whispering while walking in the yard. The sounds of whispering disappeared after they went farther. Ye Song looked at the meat soup on his bedside cabinet. He knew the soup was special when he saw the baron bringing it in. If it was just some ordinary soup, it would\u2019ve been brought by someone else.The meat inside the soup was from a fish called Round Snapper. The legend said, \u201cA wizard turned the children that became lost into this kind of fish\u201d, Angele had it even before when he was hurt. Ye Song took the silver bowl and looked at its inside. A finger-long silver fish was floating in the milky soup, and the head of the fish looked exactly like a human\u2019s face.\u201cFish with a child\u2019s face\u2026\u201d Ye Song talked to himself, and he felt nauseated after looking at the pained expression of the face.\u201cIt is not the world I used to know anymore\u2026\u201d Ye Song thought.Ye Song sat on the bed, and it took him a long time to decide to drink the soup. He held his breath and drank all the soup in one go with the exception of the head of the fish. He took it apart and left it in the bowl; it was way too horrifying for him to eat.He lied down on the bed for a while after finishing the soup. He decided to organize the memories in his brain. The teenager named Angele was loved by his father. Though he had trouble making decisions and his personality was submissive, he was good at finding ways to entertain himself. He was actually much better than others when it came to playing.The baron would get him anything he wanted such as gears, pets, money, and even people. It made Angele fearless, and this made him have the desire to take anything he found charming. In other words, he was just a rich playboy.As a Baron-level territory, the size of the land was about a county-level city at where Ye Song came from. Though the population was much smaller, the baron was the god in the territory and he could do anything he wanted. Angele shared a part of the baron\u2019s rights.In this chaotic age, the Rudin Empire was not stable at all. Nobility had always been the symbol of wealth and power. However, no matter how strong Baron Karl was, his beloved son, Angele, still did something unacceptable. Angele found an attractive noble girl in his knight course class, and the girl was named Catherine Candia. She was the most beloved child of Viscount Candia, and Viscount Candia was of a status higher than Baron Karl.Angele tried to show off his riding skills and decided to accept the challenge against another male classmate of his. Angele\u2019s saddle had been modified by his competitor before the race. As a result, Angele disappeared from this world permanently when he fell off the horse.\u201cIt was just for a girl\u2026\u201d Ye Song felt speechless when he was scrounging the memories in his mind. \u201cThis world makes me speechless. A fourteen-year-old teenager would actually fight against others just for a girl\u2026\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: ReorganizingTranslator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter lying on the bed for about half a day, Ye Song decided to get up. He could hear noises from the people outside the wall of their yard. It seemed like someone was gathering the boisterous crowd. Ye Song knew that his father was chasing the wanted criminals with the guards.A group of criminals that came from nowhere was robbing random people around, and they\u2019ve already murdered ten whole families. People in the territory were extremely terrified because of this. Knight Audis took the order, and was searching around the city with his guards.Outside the bedroom, Ye Song saw a small grey yard with a small pond located in the middle. The yard was definitely not well-maintained; there were weeds growing everywhere. Two conversing middle-aged guards were standing by the pond, and they saluted Ye Song right after they saw him. They were under the direct order of the baron, and they looked tall and strong.\u201cYoung Master Angele, how was your rest?\u201d The guard with whisker asked in a light tone. He wore a heavy golden leather armor, and a huge axe was being carried on his back. He looked extremely intimidating with those gear.The other guard looked thinner, and he only wore a half-length leather armor. There was a crossguard sword hanging from his waist; he did not look very strong but the light gear made him seem agile, and Ye Song could feel the steadiness in his eyes.Ye Song took a glance at the edge of the crossguard sword that still had dark-colored blood smeared on it. Ye Song decided not to look at it anymore.\u201cDid Uncle Audis send you here?\u201d Ye asked.\u201cYes, we will take you back to the castle, and we still have to go back to our duty after. Let\u2019s be on our way, we don\u2019t have much spare time.\u201d The thinner guard answered with a deep voice.\u201cIt seems that you have already acquired the information about those wanted criminals?\u201d Ye Song nodded and asked.\u201cYes, we found their temporary hideout this morning, and leader has brought the army there and surrounded them.\u201d The thinner guard answered as he nodded.\u201cOkay, I am going to change right now.\u201d Ye Song said. He went back to the bedroom and took off his robe. He wore an appropriate suit and stepped out of the room. Ye Song looked for the two guards and left the place with them.The house was just a place for Ye Song\u2019s family to stay when they are in the town. The place was not that good for Ye Song to rest and heal. Outside the house was the street, many people were walking around. They were all wearing dull grey linen clothes, and the whole street looked filthy.Some merchants were selling various things by the streetside, and they were advertising their products with loud voices. There were people selling fruits, wooden toys, and even vegetables. Some women were checking the goods while holding baskets.Ye Song quickly noticed the differences between him and the people walking by right after he left the house. His clothes had a different color than anyone else on the street. He was wearing black, and the others were wearing grey. The reason was that only nobles were allowed to wear clothes of other colors, and common people were restricted to only grey-colored clothes in this world. It was one of the special rights of nobility; if anyone tried to violate the rule, they might be sentenced to death right away. It was, after all, a serious offense. But even then, there were still color restrictions between the nobles, and the colors they could wear were determined by their status.Ye Song talked with the two guards along the way. He noticed that people would salute to him every time they saw him, and their faces always showed an expression of fear. He felt like he was a lion walking among a flock of sheeps.\u201cYou are still not used to that, Young Master Angele?\u201d The thinner guard laughed.From their conversations, Ye Song learnt the two guards\u2019 name. The thinner guard was called Carter, and he was an adventurer that lived around here. He was recruited into the army, and he was actually lucky. Adventurers were pretty much just people with no actual jobs. They were very low in terms of social standing, and being a guard in the army was like being a policeman in a police station on Earth. His standing became much higher than common people, and he gained a lot of benefits from his job.The strong guard was called Miro, and he grew up in the Baron Rio\u2019s territory. Miro was talented, and he was immensely powerful.\u201cYea\u2026 The Candia City is much larger than this little town.\u201d Carter said and laughed, he did not even wait for Ye Song to respond. Carter grabbed a tomato from a vendor they passed by and took a large bite off it; the owner did not seem to be happy about it. Ye Song knitted his eyebrows a little bit, but he did not say anything.Ye Song thought those family guards were used to taking things from the vendors without paying. They probably had an awful reputation in the territory. But it reminded Ye Song of his old self.Ye Song talked with the guards about random things on their way out, and it did not take an ample amount of time for them to get out of the town. They could see a black carriage waiting outside the fences of the town. The coachman got off the carriage quickly when he saw Ye Song and two guards coming. The coachman greeted them and waited at the side.The group of three got on the carriage, and they let Carter drive it. The carriage got to the main road at full speed quickly.It took them about twenty minutes to reach their destination, which was the main base for the Rio Family, the Karl Castle.Ye Song got out of the carriage carefully, and raised his head to get a view of the castle in front of him. The castle was built within a green forest, and it looked like a manor from ancient times to him.The whole Karl Castle is surrounded by the moat. It would be more precise to describe it as a city surrounded by high walls than a castle.The grey castle did not look so former to Ye Song, and it did not fit Ye Song\u2019s imagination about castles at all. It was about the height of a five-storey building. There were two guards with iron swords on their back in front the main entrance, the bridge was lowered over the moat, and the guards were staring at the group of three confusedly.It was right before sunset, and the castle looked red with the huge sun in the back. Ye Song did not know where it came from, but he could smell the scent of flowers.Ye Song took a deep breath. The sun almost went down, and it was getting cold.\u201cIs Old Wade here?\u201d Ye Song asked in a faint tone.\u201cHe is here, we brought you here safely, and we need to get back to work now.\u201d Carter nodded and said.Ye Song agreed, and he saw the two guards go back to the carriage. It did not take a long time for them disappear from Ye Song\u2019s sight.Ye Song started walking towards the castle, and there was an old man wearing a black coat walking out of the castle. The old man\u2019s hair was completely white, and he was walking towards Ye Song with several female guards following behind him.\u201cOld Wade, I am back!\u201d Ye Song yelled, and he started to walk faster.Wade was a butler that works for Baron Karl, he was in charge of general inquires within the territory, and he has been working here for about 30 years. He knew Baron Karl since the baron was very young.\u201cI told the baron a long time ago, he should\u2019ve let Audis take care of the Young Master, but he didn\u2019t listen. Now, the Young Master is hurt; he should\u2019ve taken my advice\u2026\u201d The thin old man talked while walking close to Ye Song.Ye Song had his official smile on his face, and he followed the people welcoming him into the castle.Wade complained for a while then suddenly stopped.\u201cYoung Master, this time you should just stay in the castle and let Audis teach you all the necessary knowledge.\u201d Wade said.\u201cDid Father say that?\u201d Ye Song asked.\u201cYes, the situation outside is not good right now. We don\u2019t think letting you live outside alone is a good idea. More importantly, you suffered a lot this time. We will get our revenge for sure, even if the opponent is Viscount Candia.\u201d Wade said. Ye Song could feel how serious the old butler was.\u201cI am fine with Father\u2019s decision.\u201d Ye Song agreed.Ye Song followed Wade into the main hall, and there were two maids together with them too.Two young girls wearing white farthingales were waiting there, and they bowed together when they saw Wade bringing Ye Song in.\u201cBrother Angele.\u201d The girls said together.\u201cCelia and Maggie!\u201d Ye Song searched through his memory quickly.Celia was Angele\u2019s young sister, and they have the same father. Maggie came from a poor relative, and she came seeking help from the Rio Family; Maggie\u2019s family declined a long time ago. They were all younger than Ye Song so they called Angele \u2018brother\u2019.Angele had a crucial position in the family, so relatives like Celia and Maggie must be careful when dealing with him. There were many other girls like them in the castle, but they didn\u2019t have high status. The baron did not really care about those girls. Celia\u2019s life in the castle was actually pretty decent; she could get a certain amount of money to spend every month, and had maids to do the housework for her. She was at the same level as the leader of the maids.Maggie\u2019s life was easy, though. Her parents worked for the baron in the castle, and they could easily get some money to survive. They were just like regular workers in the castle, maybe they were even treated a bit better than the ones at the lowest status. There were many poor relatives trying to seek help from the Rio Family, and Maggie\u2019s family was just one of them.\u201cIt has been a long time.\u201d Ye Song said, and he smiled. He played well with the two girls because they were relatively good-looking, and they had nice styles. He treated them well whenever he was around, and the two girls had thought they found someone that they could rely on so they were willing to stay with Angele.\u201cWe heard you were injured, and we decided to wait here to welcome you back. Are you feeling better now?\u201d Maggie asked. She was thirteen years old and her voice sounded young, but her body was developed quite well. Maggie had a nice style and a cute face. Her waist was slim, and her breasts were large. Ye Song was attracted to her, and he stared at her for a while.It seemed like Maggie knew Ye Song was looking at her, and she started to blush. She did not act like she noticed Ye Song\u2019s gaze, but she tried to make her breasts become more enticingly apparent to his eyes.Celia\u2019s body was a bit underdeveloped compared to Maggie, and she was very shy. Celia looked at Ye Song like a young deer, having a tinge of fear in her eyes. She put her hands over her stomach, seemingly showing nervousness as well. Ye Song could feel her innocence.There were actually more people trying to welcome Ye Song back to the castle, but the two girls thought about the situation and decided to come earlier than others. People would think they were close to Ye Song if they were the first ones to welcome him. Maybe their parents asked them to do so.\u201cI feel much better now, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Ye Song nodded his head, and talked a bit with the girls.Wade left quietly to do other jobs, and Ye Song followed the two girls into the inner hall. After many people in the castle sent their greetings there, Ye finally got some time to take a rest.He went back to his own bedroom, and he took a deep breath.There was a writing desk inside the room beside the bed. On the desk was a piece of yellow parchment lying there. A feather ink pen was placed beside the ink bottle at the side, with three lighted candles arranged into the shape of a mountain. Ye Song could smell the special fragrance wafting off the candles.Ye Song pulled the chair out and sat down. He started to read the paper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: OpeningTranslator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe yellow parchment paper was half-full with well-written words on it. Ye Song touched the paper, and he felt it was thin and soft.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Suddenly a soft voice came from the corner of the bedroom. Ye Song finally remembered the girl whom his father mentioned a while ago.He looked at the dark corner where the sound came from, and a girl with long hair was sitting there while holding her knees. Ye Song was not so sure if he remembered correctly, but he pretty much knew who she was.\u201cYou are Cecilia?\u201d Ye Song stood up, and he walked towards the girl. He remembered her name.\u201cYea\u2026Yes.\u201d The girl was scared, and she tried to get closer to the corner. Ye Song could see her tumid eyes; she was definitely crying. Ye Song could see the dried tears on her face.\u201cYoung Master Angele, is there anything I could do for you?\u201d She asked in a faint tone.Ye Song took a glance at her developing body, and he shook his head. He knew this world was close to the medieval age of Europe, and people there were not against having sex from a young age. But there was a twenty-year-old soul inside Ye Song and he was not going to do anything to a girl that was about fifteen years old.There were still many things he needed to do, and he had no time for this.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t need anything right now.\u201d Ye Song said. \u201cMaggie! Maggie!\u201d Ye Song yelled, and he clapped his hands loudly.The door of the bedroom opened, a lady in grey maid uniform came in politely.\u201cHow may I help you?\u201d The maid asked.\u201cGet this young girl out of here, and get her a room. I have not\u2026\u201d Ye Song stopped for a second; he was worried that his father would do something to the girl because it might look like he just kicked Cecilia out of the room. The baron was cold-blooded, and he pretty much forced Cecilia\u2019s family to send her here. If she just got kicked out by Ye Song, she would not leave the castle alive. She would be sent to the guards as a slave, and that\u2019s merely the best scenario.Ye Song took a glance at the girl in the corner, and her face was full of fear.\u201cI am not in the mood today; take her out and let her rest. I will deal with her later.\u201d Ye Song said.The maid bowed to Ye Song politely, and she took Cecilia out of the bedroom.Ye Song could finally get some rest. He did not actually know what to do ever since he reincarnated.Ye Song sat in front of the writing desk, and he grabbed the white feather pen. The pen had an unseamed texture, and there was a bit of red at the end of the feather. He did not know what bird\u2019s feather this was, and it was actually pretty heavy.The feather reflected some of the candle\u2019s light; it had a dark yellow light, and it looked beautiful.\u2018I thought I was dead for sure, then I ended up in someone else\u2019s body in a totally different universe.\u2019 Ye Song played with the pen in his hand, and he thought about the experience.According to Angele\u2019s memory, the people in this world still wielded cold weapons, and they were still using bow and arrows as long-range weapons. There was no gunpowder at all, and Angele never heard of it too. If an strong individual joined a battle, he could absolutely turn the tides of the battle just by his own will.The reason why Angele\u2019s father, Baron Karl, could still have a great life while being arrogant and cold-blooded lied in his skill and power in battle. Baron Karl was a hero of the Redbud Battle, and it was one of Rudin Empire\u2019s most brutal battles against its enemies. That was a famous battle that damaged Rudin Empire\u2019s base. Baron Karl survived that using his own skills.Baron Karl had a strong body, a special set of fighting skills and smooth crossguard sword skills. He had killed fifteen heavy armored knights consequently during the battle. With Knight Audis, they could easily make Viscount Candia tremble in fear.Peerage did not represent the power ranking in the current state of Rudin Empire. Instead, one\u2019s skills and abilities in battle was something that determined who the superior one would be.The power of the army! The power of a strong individual!Those were the things that made people fearless.In this chaotic age, there were skirmishes and wars happening all the time. Even if Baron Karl was so cruel and arrogant, people still never moved out of his territory. After all, people needed to rely on someone that was strong enough to protect them for their own survival.Without the protection of a lord, people wouldn\u2019t be able to survive outside for a long time because there were bandits everywhere. Some bandits even resorted to cannibalism if they could not find food. Travelling from one territory to another without protection was pretty much looking to die. People would not survive with just having a stout heart.The situation in Baron Karl\u2019s territory was different. The bandit groups around the territory were raided and cleared out by the guards led by the baron. Not only common people were afraid of him, bandits would even run away just after hearing his name. The baron\u2019s territory together with half of the Candia City were actually supported by the baron, and bandits were utterly terrified of the baron\u2019s power. This was also the reason why Old Wade wasn\u2019t so concerned regarding Viscount Candia\u2019s title.People living in the territory did not die randomly; the only thing they had to suffer was living under the dominion of the baron. No matter how cruel the baron was, only a certain amount of people were affected by that. There were countless people in the territory, and people did not think they would be the next one. Ye Song tried guessing the thoughts of the people living in the territory.Ye Song grabbed the parchment paper on the desk; he had never seen such language. It looked like English, but it also looked like the ancient Chinese Tibetan Language.\u2018It would be very hard to learn this language if I didn\u2019t have Angele\u2019s memory.\u2019 Ye Song thought, and thanks to Angele, Ye Song could speak and understand this language just fine. The language part in Angele\u2019s brain remained there, and it would generate proper words whenever Ye Song tried to express something.\u2018The structure of the words looks well-developed here\u2026\u2019 Ye Song thought while reading the paper Angele had copied down the history of the family on it.\u2018If only I could get my biological chip to work, it would be much easier for me to learn and comprehend the knowledge here since the language structure is perfect.\u2019 Ye Song thought. He touched his left temple; it was where his biological chip used to be at. He had been implanted with the chip when he was still alive on Earth.Di!!The sound of biological activation echoed in Ye Song\u2019s ear. He recognized it because he had already heard it for thousands of times.\u201cBiological chip no.18907 at your service. I am made by Chinese Fei Teng Company, and supervised by the Artificial Intelligence Department.\u201d A sweet Chinese female voice was speaking within Ye Song\u2019s head.Ye Song was not surprised by it because he knew it was the advertisement sound of the chip. It was just like the welcome message that would appear whenever you turned the TV screen on. The chip itself, however, did not have any intelligence.Biological chip was the invention of the 23rd century, and it had two major functions: analysis and storage.The analysis function was very basic. It used different information to do a logical analysis on the structures of certain things, and the result would be automatically inputted into the storage.The chip itself had no intelligence because scientists were concerned about the effect it would have on the human brain. The biological function would make the chip become a part of the brain, which meant the chip could not be simply taken out once implanted.The storage function was separated from the original memory system of the brain. It had a much larger capacity than the human brain, and it could store over one thousand years worth of information in it. The human brain could only store about one hundred fifty years worth of information.\u2018The chip reincarnated with me?\u2019 Ye Song simply could not believe it, and he was breathing heavily. He sat on the chair for a long time to think this over.\u2018But it could be possible, my chip was the newest version, and it was said to have been integrated into my gene. If it is broken, it will repair itself just like my organs. So\u2026 My gene got carried over to this body?\u2019 Ye Song guessed.\u201cPlease name the chip.\u201d The sweet voice spoke again.\u201cZero.\u201d Ye Song did not even think; he just used the old name.\u201cName confirmed, chip Zero\u2019s auto support system will be destroyed now. Enjoy the chip, please call 40355627 if you have any complaints. Thanks for using\u2014\u201d The voice stopped here.Ye Song knew that this would be the last time he would hear that sweet voice from the chip. There would only be a mechanically-generated voice afterwards, and the sound would be created by his memory function.Ye Song was excited, and he kept on breathing heavily.The chip would be a great asset in this era where cold weapons reigned supreme.The candle\u2019s yellow light was reflected on Ye Song\u2019s face, and it started to glowing. There was a window over the writing desk, and a thin white paper was stuck at the wooden frame. Most of the windows on the castle were like this.Ye Song stood up and opened the window.The wooden frame was pushed outwards with a long \u201cchi\u201d sound.Ye Song reached his head outside the window. He wanted to cool himself down for a bit.The wind in the night blew across his own face, and he could smell the scent of grasses.His bedroom was at the fourth floor, and he could see the large, dark forest outside. The trees were just like shades, and he could hear the sounds the insects were making along with the sound of the tree leaves being blown by the wind.Two crescent moons hung over the night sky, and the moonlight poured onto the ground.Suddenly, Ye Song heard the sound of hooves stomping on the ground from the only main road linked to the town outside, and the road was just in between the forest he was looking at.Ye Song felt much better with the help of the cold breeze. In the moonlight, he saw a group of dark-armored knights heading to the castle from the end of the road.Some of the knights were holding lit-up torches, and the horses they were riding on neighed, making noises.Ye Song could see the one leading the group was talking with the others behind him, and he was laughing about something.With the help of the light of the torches, Ye Song could finally saw what the leader looked like.The leader had a serious face with some black goat beard on his chin, and his long flaxen hair draped all over his shoulder. He looked very strong in his silver armor. He looked a bit rude, but still noble.\u201cIt is father, Baron Karl.\u201d Ye Song immediately recognized him because he just saw him not too long ago. Angele also had deeply-etched memories of him.The baron wore black leather gloves on his hands that were holding the reins. He looked back at Ye Song, when the latter was still trying to figure out who he was.The baron saw Ye Song looking at him by the window, and he took off one of the gloves and waved towards the latter. Ye Song also smiled in response, and he nodded at him. The baron then shook the reins lightly, urging the horse to move faster.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Life (Part 1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe group of knights arrived at the castle quickly, and they got into the castle after passing through the already-lowered drawbridge.Ye Song had his sights on them until they completely passed through the gateway, and then he sat on his chair again. Ye Song had already gathered enough information about his father through Angele\u2019s memory. Though people considered the baron as a cruel lord, he treated Angele really well. He was strict about the rules, but he had never beaten Angele even once.\u2018I should go and greet my father.\u2019 Ye Song thought. Before he stood up, someone started to knock on his door.\u201cYoung Master Angele, the baron is summoning you.\u201d Maid Maggie said outside the door.\u201cAlright, I am coming.\u201d Ye Song yelled.He stood up quickly, and he opened the door. Maid Maggie was waiting outside while holding a candle on a stand. Ye Song followed Maggie through the hallway, and they went down the spiral stairs. They reached the stairs on the second floor. At the end of the hallway, there was a room with a half-opened door. Ye Song could see the light leaking out of it.\u201cI will be waiting here, Young Master.\u201d Maggie said after bowing to Ye Song politely.Ye Song nodded and walked into the room.Baron\u2019s deep voice became louder as Ye Song walked closer.\u201c\u2026In the territory, no one has the balls to ignore my order. Those criminals must be outsiders.\u201d The baron said, but Ye Song only caught the second half.Another deep voice came from the inside of the room, and it was Knight Audis.\u201cI am not so sure about that. Based on the criminals\u2019 appearances, they are definitely from the east, and it must be the Saladin Empire. Their styles of clothes and weapons are all very similar to the east. They were also fighting like a trained army, not some random criminals. I suppose they are taking revenge for the event that occurred four years ago.\u201d Audis said.\u201cIt will take the best horses to travel from Saladin Empire to my territory within half a year, and there is a huge forest in between. The possibility of that being them is miniscule. However, I think that it could\u2019ve been that old punk Candia.\u201d Baron Karl said, and his voice sounded cold. \u201cThat is the last thing he could do.\u201d\u201cTrue, and the chances are high here. We were pushing him too hard recently\u2026\u201d Audis said.Ye Song did not knock on the door, and he only stood outside. He knew that his father and Audis had already heard his footsteps a while ago. The only thing he needed to do was to wait outside.\u201cHowever, there is one more possibility \u2013 Lasga.\u201d Audis guessed.\u201cLasga? I\u2019ve been there about ten years ago, how is the place now? Is the mad woman Sally still there?\u201d Karl asked.\u201cI think she is still there. Well, let\u2019s leave it here. You can come in, Angele.\u201d Knight Audis said loudly.\u201cComing.\u201d Ye Song said, and he opened the door.It was a study room; there were two shelves full of books by the wall, and Ye Song could see the fire dancing slowly in the wall fireplace.The baron and Knight Audis were sitting by a table, and they both had white cups in front of them.Ye Song took a glance at the inside of the cup, and the cup was filled up with black liquid; it had a nice mint smell.\u201cFather and Uncle Audis, I am here.\u201d Ye Song greeted them politely as the memories of the former Angele resurfaced within his mind.Karl and Audis were two of the four strongest people in the Rio Territory. Baron Karl did not treat Audis as a mere knight, but more like a friend of him. They were two top swordsmen that survived the Redbud Battle.There were no warrior rankings in this world, and there was only one way for a knight to show how strong he was, which was fighting battles.\u201cTake a seat.\u201d The baron said while pointing at a chair nearby.Ye Song nodded, and he sat down quietly.\u201cThe situation outside is not going well. The Saladin Empire is very likely to put up a fight with us, the Rudin Empire. Our territory is right between the two country\u2019s borders, and this place is going to be the frontline. I asked my guy to contact one of my old gangs at the harbour, and ordered some brand new gears from him. The armors and weapons should be on their way here\u2026\u201d The baron started talking to Audis again.Ye Song sat by the side and started to examine the two people in front of him.He was already familiar with the baron, and there was nothing more he could find about him.But he never actually analyzed Audis before. Audis really looked like a bear, and he was huge even while just sitting there. He was about the height of two adult males. The iron armor worn by him was all black and shiny. He was bald, and his head looked like a lightbulb. He also had a silver earring worn on his left ear, and with all of that combined, it made him look barbaric because of the outfit and the accessories he wore.\u2018Analyze their fighting skills based on my sensory information.\u2019 Ye Song gave an order to Zero with his thoughts.Suddenly, Ye Song could see information running down in front of his eyes like a waterfall. The words were blue, and they were very intense and complex.Ye Song knew that an individual\u2019s fighting ability was very important in this world. He learnt from Angele\u2019s memory that unrivalled power was the only thing that would help him fulfill his desires. Also, becoming powerful would help Ye Song protect himself, so he decided to analyze the fighting skills of the two.The baron and Audis kept talking about external affairs. But Ye Song noticed that the baron sometimes had his eyes on him, and the baron showed a disappointed expression whenever he saw that Ye Song was not completely listening.They were trying to get Ye Song involved in the discussion in order to help Ye Song become prepared to be the next leader, but Ye Song\u2019s facial expression while analyzing the results made it seem like he was uninterested, and it made the two very disappointed.Ye Song did not really understand the point, but at least he got the results.\u2018Karl Rio, results based on sensory information: Strength is higher than 2, Agility is higher than 2, and Stamina is higher than 2. Audis, results based on sensory information: Strength is higher than 3, Agility is about 1, and Stamina is higher than 3.\u2019 Zero reported in Ye Song\u2019s brain.Ye Song was surprised\u2026Having 1 point in an attribute was equivalent to having the ability of a regular male adult, and this was based on the information from Earth.According to the results, Ye Song\u2019s father and Knight Audis were pretty much the Superman he knew from the movie. Their strength points were higher than 2 and 3, which meant that they had the power of two or three ordinary adult males. Stamina referred to the ability of taking hits, poison resistance, recovery and endurance.\u2018I am sure I am out of Earth right now\u2026\u2019 Ye Song was speechless.\u2018Zero, do the analysis on me.\u2019 Ye Song sent the order.Blue-colored information appeared in front of Ye Song\u2019s eyes.\u2018Angele Rio, ability analysis results: Strength is lower than 0.3, Agility is lower than 0.4, and Stamina is lower than 0.7.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018\u2026\u2019 Ye Song became speechless once again.Even for a fourteen-year-old body, the data was way too low. A normal teen at this age on Earth would have a strength level at 0.5, and agility level at 1.2. Angele was taking knight\u2019s training, yet his data was still below average. How was that even possible?Maybe Ye Song was still injured, and he should first wait for a full recovery.The baron stopped talking with Audis about their plan. They turned their sights to Ye Song.\u201cStarting from tomorrow, Angele, you will be learning the basic fighting skills with Audis. There will be some other boys in the castle training with you. \u201c The baron said.\u201cUnderstood, father.\u201d Ye Song said.\u201cYou are weak in terms of physical abilities. I want you to at least get to an average level, so I want you to learn the basic fighting skills.\u201d Ye Song could see the worry from the baron\u2019s eyes.Ye Song knew that if Angele\u2019s body was strong, he would not simply fall off the horse and die.\u201cI understand.\u201d Ye Song nodded.\u201cHow is your recovery? Are you getting better?\u201d Audis asked kindly.\u201cI would be fine with the basic training.\u201d Ye Song answered.\u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Audis nodded.\u201cSpeak to Annker if you want any specific dish to eat; she is the leader of the maids. We got a horned bull the day before, so you will recover faster if you eat some of it. Well, go and rest for now.\u201d The baron said.Ye Song stood up and saluted before quickly walking out of the room.Maggie was still waiting by the staircase while holding the candle stand. She stood in the dark alone until Ye Song finished his thing.Ye Song quickly walked towards her.\u201cNo one is around during this time? Why is there no light?\u201d Ye Song asked.\u201cIt is the living quarters; most of the people in the castle are at the training grounds and the bar. There are not many people here, so we are not wasting candles here.\u201d Maggie shook her head and answered.\u201cOkay.\u201d Ye Song nodded.According to Angele\u2019s memory, the castle was divided to several areas.Living quarters, activity area, and the areas for miscellaneous activities.The activity area included the training grounds and the arena. The other areas included the bar, blacksmith shop, and the stable, etc.The castle was about the size of an average university on Earth, but there were only about two hundred people in it. Only strong knights, swordsmen, and lancers were allowed to live in the castle, and there were only about a hundred of them.\u201cLet\u2019s head back.\u201d Ye Song stopped thinking.Maggie led Ye Song back to his bedroom.Ye Song saw Cecilia hiding in the corner as he opened the door.\u201cYou filthy rat, how did you enter Young Master Angele\u2019s room?!\u201d Maggie saw her, and she started yelling.Cecilia moved closer to the corner, trying to hide.\u201cIt is fine, and you can leave now.\u201d Ye Song stopped Maggie from rushing inside his room.\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d Maggie immediately stopped her actions, and she left the room.The door of the bedroom was closed.Ye Song walked towards the girl at the corner. He looked at her for a while.She wore a white-greyish dress, and her shoulders were exposed; her skin was white and smooth; also, her hair was long and black. If she was not crying, she would actually be a beautiful young girl.Ye Song did not really want to do anything. He took the silk sheet on his bed, and threw it over to her. Ye Song decided to just lie down on the bed because he was really tired after all that.\u201cHa\u2026\u2026\u201d Ye Song breathed deeply.\u2018Based on the current situation, I am in a good position. As long as the baron is there for me, there is nothing I need to worry about, but I can\u2019t predict the future, and I need to prepare for the unexpected things. This world does not seem peaceful at all.\u2019 Ye Song thought, and he fell into slumber right after.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Life (Part 2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeYe Song was woken up by some noise after sleeping for a long time.Ye Song got up slowly after opening his eyes. A white silky sheet slid off his body.\u2018I thought I gave the sheet to someone else?\u2019 Ye Song rubbed his eyes. He knew he gave the sheet to Cecilia last night.Suddenly, Ye Song\u2019s shoulder was touched by a small hand.Ye Song looked at his bed, and he saw Cecilia was sleeping by his side. It looked like she was having a nice dream.Also, Ye Song noticed that his socks and coat were taken off by someone.\u2018Well, it looks like she did that for me.\u2019 Ye Song guessed it right.Based on Angele\u2019s memory, he met with Cecilia for the first time while hunting outside. Cecilia was a shepherd on that mountain, and Angele became attracted to her appearance. The baron then took her back to the castle, and he sent her to Angele as a gift.The girl came from a farmer\u2019s family, so she actually knew how to help the family out. Her parents would be able to live a much better life if Young Master Angele was attracted to her. Also, she was not the only child in the family, and she also had an elder brother and a younger sister. She was not forced to be sent to Angele, but instead made the decision herself.Ye Song learnt those things when he was checking out Angele\u2019s memory, and he knew it was Cecilia that helped him take off his socks and his coat.It was early in the morning, and the light went inside the bedroom through the windows. The air was a bit cold actually. The noise Ye Song heard earlier was from the guards\u2019 training. Ye Song got off the bed, and he stretched for a bit. Ye Song got a morning wood like any other normal man, making him feel slightly awkward. Also, it showed that he was recovering well, stamina-wise at least.Ye Song also woke the girl up as he left the bed, and Cecilia\u2019s line of sight was right at his morning wood. She started to blush, and she did not know what she should do.\u201cYoung Master Angele\u2026 Is there anything I could do for you?\u201d She asked in a light tone.Ye Song almost lost control when Cecilia asked with such a cute voice.\u201cDo you know the basics of housework? If you do, get me some water; I need to wash my face.\u201d Ye Song tried his best to stay calm.\u201cYea\u2026 I do\u2026\u201d The girl was a bit scared, and she got off the bed in panic. Cecilia then ran outside the bedroom to get water.Ye Song finally relaxed for a bit. Though Cecilia was sent as a gift to him, she was too young for him. Ye Song did not want to do anything to the young girl because his sense of morality did not allow it.More importantly, he was just fourteen years old, and he needed to recover from an injury. Having sex too early could impact the development of his body and make him weaker.Though he could do anything he wanted to Cecilia, Ye Song successfully controlled himself with his reasoning. He also calmed down a lot after Cecilia left the room.Ye Song was too tired to wash last night as he did not feel very well. He used to wash his face before going to sleep.\u2018There is not much water around here, and it seems like people only wash themselves once a day. It is problematic that I cannot waste any water.\u2019 Ye Song thought.Ye Song walked towards the opened window, and he reached out to look down. There was a huge empty ground in front of the forest, and a group of guards in black armor were jogging. They were wearing heavy black full armors, and there were large crossguard blades carried on their backs. Each blade had a palm-sized width. They were doing their morning routine, and Ye Song could see yellow dust being blown behind their jogging paths.\u201cEleven!\u201d The guard that was leading the group yelled.\u201cEleven!\u201d Everyone else yelled after the leader. They sounded loud, but not perfectly synchronized. Ye Song could also hear the chirps of birds mixed in them.Ye Song felt refreshed just by looking at them, and he was not sleepy anymore.\u2018It is time to think of ways that could help build my body a strong foundation.\u2019 Ye Song thought while looking at the guards, and then he rubbed his chin.\u2018My chip has two main functions: one is analysis, and the other is storage. For Zero to do the analysis precisely, it is necessary to gather a huge amount of data. Yesterday\u2019s results of my father and Audis were very inaccurate. The data was based on my sensory information. The storage can store a lot of data, and it works like a hard disk. It can\u2019t replace my memory, however, so I need to find a way to transfer the data into my brain.\u2019 Ye Song thought for a while.\u2018If I want to strengthen my own body, the best way will be to train more, and the analysis function of my chip can help me find the best way to exercise.\u2019 Ye Song kept thinking.Ye Song waited for a while, and Cecilia brought him water and towel. He washed himself for a while, then afterwards asked Cecilia to stay in his room. Ye Song went down the spiral staircase after leaving the room.It was still early in the morning, and there was not much light in the castle. It was still pretty dark around the stairs, and Ye Song carefully walked down while holding the wooden handrail.Starting after going down from the fourth floor, a small window could be found by the stairs around every corner. Ye Song saw maids opening the window to get some fresh air while walking down.\u201cGood morning, Young Master Angele.\u201d A maid greeted politely when she saw Ye Song.Ye Song could still hear the noise of the guards\u2019 training through the window. He looked at the maid, and she looked just like a normal girl under the age of twenty. The maids in the castle were selected by the baron himself. Only the cute and smart ones were permitted to stay and work, so Ye Song actually felt pretty good around those girls.\u201cWho are those guards training outside?\u201d Ye Song asked.\u201cIt\u2019s Knight Anry\u2019s cavalry squad.\u201d The maid answered respectfully.\u201cKnight Anry?\u201d Ye Song asked.\u201cKnight Anry is the adjutant of Knight Audis. It is possible that you don\u2019t know him, he was just recruited not so long ago.\u201d The maid spoke in a light tone.\u201cOkay, got it.\u201d Ye Song nodded, and he started to walk downstairs again.Outside the living area was a large, empty ground. The castle was built with a series of buildings, and in the middle of it was the activity area.The early sunlight went through the small openings between the buildings. The golden lights looked like pillars, which stood on the ground.The activity ground was a white-greyish playground.There were boys and girls training there already. Most of them were wearing grey and white clothes; Ye Song could even hear them yelling.Boys were using wooden swords to train chopping and slashing motions. The girls were training using small wooden short bows, aiming for the target at a thirty-meter range.A burly man was standing by the edge of the activity ground.Ye Song looked at the man, and he was wearing grey top with black pants. His body looked weaker than Audis, but he still looked pretty strong. He had his hands over his chest, looking at the children quietly. He was very calm.The man noticed Ye Song looking at him, and he waved his hands towards Ye Song.\u201cHey!\u201d The man yelled. \u201cStop for a second! Come here everyone!\u201dThe children that were training looked at him, one of the boys did a strong chopping motion before coming over, and it sounded like the blowing wind. Several girls looked at the boy, and the boy smiled happily.\u201cI said stop! Gelug, are you disobeying my order?\u201d The man had an angry expression on his face.\u201cYea, Yea, Yea, my dear Master Alad.\u201d The boy answered uncaringly, and he put his wooden sword down. He started to walk towards the man slowly.When everyone gathered together, Ye Song moved to the front of the group, and he stood aside quietly.\u201cWe are welcoming a new member today.\u201d Alad clapped his hands several times; the sound was evanescent but stentorian. \u201cThis is Young Master Angele. He just came back from Candia City, and you might have seen his face yesterday on the welcoming party.\u201dNo one talked. The boys did not seem to care, but the girls were looking at Ye Song curiously. The situation was a bit awkward.Ye Song was a bit disappointed. He was not here for the introduction; he just wanted to do the morning training.\u201cMaster Alad\u2026\u201d Ye Song said.\u201cJust call me Alad.\u201d The middle-aged man said politely.\u201cOkay, Alad, let\u2019s not waste everyone\u2019s time. I am still recovering from the injury, and I want to start from the basics. Can you show me all the general exercises?\u201d Ye Song asked.Alad was surprised for a second because he had told Ye Song how the general exercises should be done a while ago. Angele was trained before he went to Candia City, and he wanted to see all the basics again?\u201cDon\u2019t tell me he doesn\u2019t even know how to do the basic exercises\u2026\u201d Someone murmured.\u201cStop!\u201d Others were trying to stop the kid from being disrespectful.However, some of the kids were looking down on Ye Song. In the chaotic age, everyone admired and respected the strong ones. People usually looked down on the ones who were weak.Bunch of kids stared at Ye Song, looking at him like they were seeing a rare animal. Ye Song was trying to control his emotions, so he focused his mind on Alad. Angele himself actually did not remember the general exercises quite well, so Ye Song had no idea how to do those now. Ye Song would not be in such an awkward position if Angele wasn\u2019t such a dumb playboy.\u201cCould you do that for me, Alad?\u201d Ye Song repeated.\u201cYea\u2026Sure.\u201d Alad nodded after being confused for a second.\u201cBut I only know the basics. If you want advanced skills, it would be better to ask the baron and Knight Audis. They are very skilled with their swords.\u201d Alad said.It was probably true that Ye Song could learn advanced skills from his father and Audis, but Ye Song needed to practice the basics first. It was pretty much impossible to start from the advanced skills for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: Life (Part 3)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAn experienced warrior was pretty much just a veteran, but if one wanted to become a knight, he needed much more than just experience. He needed to experience many blood for blood battles, to finish all the impossible trainings, and to develop his own fighting style. After the stimulation of his true potential, he would be able to get the Life Energy Seed, and the seed would help him reach another level. With the help of the seed, he would become a knight after contributing to important tasks.The Life Energy Seed was the most important thing for a warrior, and one would not become a true legend without the help of the seed.Ye Song learnt some knowledge about it from Angele\u2019s memory.The Life Energy Seed was actually the Qi a fighter could develop from inside his body by training himself in the most extreme ways. It somewhat worked like a skill on the earth that could help you take hits without getting hurt. The baron once explained the whole process on getting the seed to Angele, so Ye Song was able to get a detailed comparison and reach a conclusion.Also, not everyone could develop the seed. Only the talented ones could have the potential to do it, but the rate of success was still very low. Some of the strong warriors with the seed tried to help more people to develop it, and they came up with a specific method, which was by channeling their own Qi into others. People who got the Qi would be able to develop their seed slowly.This method increased the possibilities of the development of the seed, and it also reduced the risks significantly. People could die from trying to do the extreme trainings, and this method helped some people obtain the seed from the beginning.But still, this method could not help everyone become great warriors. The rate of success was increased, and two-thirds of them could actually benefit from this method, but the remaining one-third was still not able to take the seed in. If people\u2019s bodies could not take in the life energy, the energy would just leak out of them, no matter how much was put into them.Unfortunately, Angele was included in the one-third. He could not take in the seed by this special method, and that was the main reason why he did not train a lot. He became lazy, and he just wanted to be a playboy. Otherwise, the baron would\u2019ve just pushed his Qi into Angele and helped him become a strong warrior. At least, Angele would have had the ability to protect himself.Alad stared at Ye Song for a while, and it seemed he remembered Angele\u2019s situation. He knew why Angele did not remember the basic training routines; Angele already gave up a long time ago.\u201cWell, let\u2019s start the morning training again. Young Master Angele, please follow me this way.\u201d Alad clapped his hands loudly, and Ye Song followed.The children returned to their positions and started to do the exercises again. The boys started practicing slashing, and the girls started to practice shooting with their short bows. Ye Song followed Alad to a corner.\u201cThough it will be hard for you to become a knight level warrior, more exercises will still help build your body. Please try to do the routine every day.\u201d Alad said while walking.\u201cI understand. Thank you, Alad.\u201d Ye Song nodded, and he smiled. \u201cThe second son of Baron Karl isn\u2019t talented enough to become a great warrior; I know it is a widely told story.\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201d Alad stopped talking.\u201cAre those children on the grounds gifted?\u201d Ye Song asked.\u201cYoung Master, they got the seeds from the baron and Knight Audis. They are training using the special methods taught by the two.\u201d Alad answered.Ye Song knew it was better for children to get the seeds when they were young. If they obtain the seeds at an early age, the seeds would grow stronger with the children. The stronger their seeds were, the stronger their bodies would be, and when they became adults, they would have well-developed bodies.The baron and Knight Audis took the seeds when they were very young, too. Ye Song understood this point, but there was nothing he could do about it. Angele was not gifted, so Ye Song could not get the seed from the baron anyways.At least Ye Song still had the biological chip in him, so he was not totally hopeless.Alad led Ye Song to an empty ground at the corner. There was a shelf with long wooden swords on it, and most of these had been taken by the boys to practice.Alad grabbed a sword, and he threw it to Ye Song. Ye Song caught it, but he felt the heavy weight of the sword. The wooden swords were actually heavy, and it was about three kilograms each. The length of the sword was about one meter, and the handguard made a cross with the blade. It looked like the most common crossguard sword.Ye Song waved the sword several times, and he was able to hear the slashing sound in the air. Alad also grabbed a sword for himself, and he slashed once. A white flash appeared in front of him.\u201cThe basics are simple, but not everyone can finish the whole set easily.\u201d Alad said, and he performed a front slash while holding the sword with both his hands.Hue!Ye Song felt the air blow over his face, and his hair got slightly blown to the back. The chip in Ye Song\u2019s brain started to analyze the data automatically. A line of blue-colored data was shown in front of his eyes quickly.\u2018Alad, Strength higher than 1, Agility higher than 2, Stamina higher than 2.\u2019 Zero reported.\u201cThis is the front slash. Please focus your strength on the lower edge of the blade. It will help you deal more damage to the opponent, and it will make the blade last longer too.\u201d Alad explained, and he started to show different slashing skills.Front slash, up slash, horizontal slash, point strike, and down slash were the five basic ways of wielding a sword. Alad demonstrated all of those one by one to Ye Song. Every time Alad performed a slash, there would be some air blowing all over the place.Ye Song watched Alad\u2019s actions carefully, and his chip was also recording the data in the meantime.The chip finished its recording process when Alad finished the demonstrations.\u201cWhat do you think? Those skills are very simple, but it is still hard to master them. If you do them incorrectly, it might even hurt your joints. Please make sure you are doing them properly.\u201d Alad said in a serious tone.Ye Song nodded lightly.\u2018Recording finished.\u2019 Zero reported. \u2018Please name the dataset.\u2019\u2018Basic sword skills.\u2019 Ye Song confirmed the name.\u2018Name confirmed as basic sword skills.\u2019 The mechanical sound stopped after the confirmation.Ye Song tried to select the data with his mind, and the data was shown within his brain. Alad\u2019s demonstration was well-recorded, and he could see the images and hear the sound without any issue.\u201cI remember those skills, I have learnt them before.\u201d Ye Song told Alad after making sure the data was stored properly.Alad was a bit confused; he stared at Ye Song, and he tried to make sure that Ye Song was serious.\u201cSince you still remember them, please practice them more. Knight Audis should be teaching you today, but he left for duty. Please try doing the basic routine and get used to it. I have to go to the training grounds, please let me know if you need something else.\u201d Alad said, and he left quickly after these words.Ye Song smiled after Alad left. He waved the wooden sword for a bit. The chip helped him to analyze the process, and all the data was stored on it, but he still needed to do the exercises by himself. The chip was merely a tool for assistance after all.Ye Song started to exercise following the demonstrations.\u2018First, front slash.\u2019 Ye Song thought.\u2018Your action had a 31% deviation from the original data.\u2019 The chip reported to Ye Song as he was trying to do the slash while holding the sword with both of his hands.Ye Song was happy about the support function the chip had. It could compare his action with the data and make sure he was doing the slash properly.Ye Song tried to modify his slash position.\u201825% deviation detected.\u2019 The chip reported.Ye Song modified his position multiple times with the help of the data, and he became close to the original data finally. He held the sword steadily, and he modified his position. He performed the slash when the difference was less than 5%, and he felt his action was very smooth.\u2018Checking body condition, the action you just performed is enhancing the number 5, number 3, and number 11 groups of the muscle. Repeat the action 10526 times to increase the strength by 1.\u2019 The chip reported.\u2018Great\u2026 Only ten thousand times.\u2019 Ye Song thought.He started to practice intensely. The chip helped him to control his body condition well. It was much easier for him to exercise with the help of the data.Hue! Hue! Hue!Ye Song repeated the basic routine many times, and he could finally perform the skills smoothly and quickly. He also started to hear the blowing sound of the air, and it meant that he was getting closer to the results he wanted.Ye Song was totally enjoying the practice, and he was trying his best to improve the basics.Step forward, front slash, up slash, down slash, and horizontal slash. Ye Song was trying to do them in different directions.His actions became smoother, and the sound got lighter after a while. Ye Song could feel himself improving. He totally got used to the basic routine of sword, and he could perform the actions precisely even without the help of the data.Angele probably trained himself without telling others.Dang Dang Dang! Ye Song heard the sound of the gong.\u201cResting time! Dismiss!\u201d Alad\u2019s voice was very loud, and Ye Song could easily hear it.Ye Song stopped his training, and he looked over at the middle of the grounds. He saw Alad hitting a gong with his hand, and the sound was loud and sharp.The children on the training ground became loud after. They found their friends and started to walk towards the living area, and some of them went to grab a bite. There were also some children by Alad\u2019s side, it seemed like they were asking him something.Ye Song did not move, and the sweat was visible on his forehead. His face was red, and he was sweating everywhere. His vest was completely soaked.Ye Song was doing the basic routine smoothly, but it was just the basics. Most of the children could do them easily. He didn\u2019t get noticed by the others, because they thought that he should be able to the basic routine smoothly.\u2018Show me my body condition.\u2019 Ye Song said in his mind.\u2018Body condition: Your right hand\u2019s muscle group was slightly hurt, and your legs need rest. It would take about 24 hours for you to recover.\u2019 The chip reported.Ye Song was satisfied with the result, and he wiped the sweat with his hands. He was wearing the black suit from yesterday that looked like a hunting suit. There was a red belt around his waist. Ye Song looked nice and clean in the suit but the suit became completely wet after the training.\u2018I will become a strong warrior without the seed.\u2019 Ye Song thought calmly.He stood alone in the corner, and no one tried to talk to him. Ye Song looked around the training grounds, and everyone was trying to avoid his sight. It was pretty clear that the children were looking down at him, but they could not do anything to him. Ye Song was the son of the baron, so they decided to just avoid him.Ye Song was not concerned about this at all because he was not interested about the kids anyways. He put the sword back to the shelf, and he went towards the living quarters.\u201cBrother.\u201d Ye Song heard a sweet sound from behind.Ye Song turned back.Maggie was there with a smile on her face. The fourteen-year-old girl was wearing a white top and a short skirt. The skirt could barely cover her leg. She looked very sexy with the skirt.Ye Song thought Maggie\u2019s clothes looked like the OL\u00b9 suit on the earth. Though Maggie was not allowed to wear colorful clothes, she still tried her best to make herself look cute.---[1] OL is a slang for office lady.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Approaching (Part 1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeMaggie was one of Ye Song\u2019s best friends, and Ye Song decided to treat her like how he should.\u201cMaggie, what\u2019s going on? Need any help?\u201d Ye Song greeted.\u201cJust trying to have a nice, little conversation with you.\u201d Maggie said, and she walked towards Ye Song quickly. She grabbed Ye Song\u2019s hand, and she pressed her breasts on Ye Song\u2019s arm.\u201cWell, actually I do need some help\u2026 Could you do me a favor?\u201d Maggie got closer, and she asked.Ye Song had just finished his training, and he was still pretty excited. He could feel the blood rushing in his veins, and he found Maggie pretty seductive.\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Ye Song asked. He knew Maggie came to the castle not so long ago according to Angele\u2019s memory. Angele treated her both as a friend and a cousin, but Maggie wanted more than that. Also, it was actually common for cousins to have a relationship in the noble world, and there was no law restricting it.Maggie had been trying to make herself look glamorous. She loved beautiful clothes, and she was enjoying her life. She did not want to just be a common person all her life; she wanted to be in a higher position. Maggie could also help her parents get better jobs if she had a relationship with Angele. That was what she was trying to accomplish.The other young sister Angele had, Celia, was trying to get closer with Angele, too. Though her mother was one of the baron\u2019s wives, her mother came from a worker\u2019s family. Their rank in the family was much lower than Angele.The situation in the family was a bit complicated. The eldest son joined the army and never came back after. Though the second son was not allowed to inherit the peerage, the Rudin Empire was in chaos and had no time to enforce the rules. Nobles were trying to make their territory independent, and the baron could even give the name to Angele if he wanted to. It was very likely that Angele would become the next baron, and Celia\u2019s family would be under his control. Angele could force them to leave if he wanted to. Celia\u2019s family did not want such thing to happen, so Celia decided to become close friends with Angele. They were preparing for the future. Ye Song would probably not choose Celia to be his wife, but if Celia could at least be in a relationship with him, her family would be able to keep their current position in the castle.Maggie walked with Ye Song towards the living quarters, holding Ye Song\u2019s hand the whole time. Some people were looking at them in envy, but some others were staring at them scornfully. Ye Song did not care anyways.\u201cMy mother\u2019s legs were hurting recently, and I am wondering if you could give her some easier work to do\u2026\u201d Maggie spoke in a light tone while not looking at Ye Song directly.Ye Song did not answer her question, but he nodded his head to show that he heard her words. He walked back to his bedroom with Maggie quickly.Cecilia stayed in the bedroom quietly and did not leave the place at all. It looked like she did what Ye Song asked. Cecilia\u2019s face blushed when she saw Ye Song walking in with Maggie. Ye Song opened his closet, and he changed his clothes.\u201cMaggie, could you take her to the dining room to eat some food, and take her to the bath. Also, tell the leader of the maids to get her an individual room. Just say it was my order if she questions you.\u201d Ye Song said.Maggie thought Ye Song was going to have some fun with her as he brought her back to the bedroom. She did not expect such easy task. She looked at Cecilia and found out she had larger breasts than Cecilia. She was happy about it at least.Maggie followed Ye Song\u2019s order because she did not want to disappoint Ye Song. She grabbed Cecilia\u2019s hands, though Cecilia was kind of scared.\u201cCome find me when you are done. I will tell Wade about your mother\u2019s situation.\u201d Ye Song said calmly, and he controlled himself very well. He actually wanted to do something to Maggie, but being in this world, Ye Song needed to control his desire.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Maggie was happy about Ye Song\u2019s words. She bowed and left the room with Cecilia. Ye Song rubbed her breast for a second when they were trying to leave. He could feel the softness of it through his palm. Maggie was scared for a second, but she giggled right after.\u2018Well, a little touching should be fine.\u2019 Ye Song smiled. He did not want to get sick from controlling his desire too hard.Ye Song went to practice his basic sword skills everyday after. He utilized his chip well and made his actions much more accurate. It did not take him a long time to finish the 10 thousand times of practice. Ye Song checked his body condition, and he did get a 0.1 increase in strength.He also collected some data from the people that had similar age as him around. However, those teenagers all had the seeds, and their average body data was over 0.8; gender did not matter. He spent all those time to get the 0.1 increase but it did not even help get to the average level.The baron and Knight Audis were busy dealing with those random criminals, and they had no time to mentor Ye Song. They gave the duty to Alad. Ye Song was actually happy about it because he needed the basics the most at this point.For Maggie, Ye Song did not do anything to her after the incident of groping her breasts lightly. He wanted to learn to control his desire. Ye Song told Wade about her mother though, and she got a lighter job. Maggie was thankful about it.Four days later.It was early in the dining room of the Rio Castle.The main members of the family were having the breakfast quietly on a long rectangle wooden table. Ye Song sat on the second seat because he was the one with the most power if the baron was not there. There were two other middle-aged women by his side, and they were the 3rd and 4th wives of the baron.They looked gentle and beautiful. They were still very polite even when the baron was not here. There were also some children on the table, and they were all wearing noble suits with a black-red color. Celia was also there, and also the boy named Glue Ye Song met on the training grounds.There were about a total of ten boys and girls there, and they all looked pure and pretty. They sat on their seats and were eating quietly. The only sound Ye Song could hear was the sound of the silverwares made.Ye Song cut his steak into small pieces, and took a glance around the table. Old Wade was standing behind him, and Wade was the one who would enforce the rights of Ye Song when the baron was not here. Wade was a very skilled fighter, and the baron gave him the order of supporting Ye Song. He was here to make sure no one could rebel against Ye Song.People around the table were the ones with enough power to be allowed to dine with Ye Song. Maggie and her parents were definitely not in the list.Angele ate a piece of the beef, and had a sip of the soup.\u201cWhat is in today\u2019s soup? It has a very different fragrance than before.\u201d Ye Song asked because he found the taste of the soup a bit interesting.\u201cThe baron caught some red single-eyed snakes the day before, and the chief put them into the soup with some mushrooms.\u201d Old Wade answered politely from the back.\u201cIt has an indescribable taste, but I like it. Red single-eyed snakes? We have those in the forest around the castle?\u201d Ye Song nodded, and he asked.\u201cYes, and there are many of them. The snake is filled up with its venom, and it would be very hard to find a cure if you get bitten by it. Hunters hate them. We barely have them on the table too.\u201d Old Wade answered.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Angele grabbed the bowl and took a sip again. His mouth was filled with the soup, and he could taste the umami from it. The soup was creamy and thick, and there were chopped scallions floating on it.\u201cI want to go out for a while after the breakfast.\u201d Ye Song said.\u201cIt is not safe outside right now, it will be better if you can just stay in the castle\u2026\u201d Old Wade said; he did not like Ye Song\u2019s decision.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I won\u2019t go too far away. I just want to check out the cavalries\u2019 training ground.\u201d Angele said.\u201cYou can send some people to go with me if you are worried.\u201d Ye Song insisted his decision.\u201cOkay, please just don\u2019t stay too long out there.\u201d Old Wade nodded his head.Ye Song nodded his head to show that he understood.No one talked after their conversation, and the table stayed silent for the rest of the breakfast time.After having breakfast, Ye Song went straight to the door with two guards following him. Ye Song was considering his plan. He had a crossguard sword on his belt, and a bow with arrows on his back. There were about 50 white-feathered arrows there.\u201cAre you going to hunt?\u201d A guard asked in a light tone.\u201cNo, just trying to find some small animals to practice my skills.\u201d Ye Song shook his head, and he answered. He was actually staring at the blue-colored data in front of his eyes.\u2018Special food resource detected. Type: Meat, snake, named as red single-eyed snake. If you eat 109 of its eyes, your agility will increase by 1.\u2019 Zero reported. This was the reason why Ye Song went out. One agility increase was huge to him. Ye Song would choose this over strength for now. He also wanted to check out his training results after these days, and he wanted to know how much he could do.It was early in the morning, and there was still fog in the forest. There was an empty ground by the forest, and the cavalry team was already jogging around the ground.Ye Song went around the ground with the two guards, and they went into the forest. There was only one main road outside the castle, and there were forests on both sides. Ye Song could see mountains far away from here. The cavalry squad did not notice Ye Song and his guards because they were used to it. They had seen Ye Song go out numerous times. However, some of them still saw Ye Song trying to get into the forest.They were looking at Ye Song curiously. In the castle, many people were unsatisfied with the rules. They did not like Angele because they knew he was very weak. They did not want their castle to be ruined by a playboy like Angele. The cavalrymen that saw Ye Song did not come to greet him, and they would even become happy if Angele died in the forest.Ye Song did not notice them as he was completely focused on his hunting plans. He did not have great strength, but with the help of the chip, he could perform many actions accurately. Especially his archery skills, he had almost 100% accuracy with the help of the chip. He practiced aiming on the training grounds at night when no one else was around. He could shoot an arrow with absolute precision at a range of 50 metres, and he thought hunting would be no problem to him.It was about twenty meters in, and one of the guards stopped Ye Song from advancing.\u201cWe should stop here Young Master Angele; we may not be able to protect you if we go in deeper.\u201d The guard said.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s stop here.\u201d Angele said and smiled. He took his bow out, and grabbed a white-feathered arrow. He then nocked the arrow at the bowstring.\u201cStand aside, you two. I am trying to find some targets.\u201d Ye Song ordered.The two guards looked at each other, and they decided to sit down. They did not want to block Angele\u2019s vision. It was not a deep forest anyway, and it was not dangerous. They were not too worried about it.\u201cThe only creatures here are the red single-eyed snakes and rabbit-umbrella squirrels. Let\u2019s just make sure that no single-eyed snakes will get close.\u201d One of the guards whispered to the other.The other guard nodded his head.Ye Song stood on the grass, and he surveyed the surroundings.\u201cI think my father once hunted a mountain black bear in the forest. Though he got injured severely, the skin of the bear is now a symbol of his power in the castle.\u201d Ye Song said calmly.\u201cA mountain black bear is one of the strongest animals in the forest, and it is the king of the outer forest. But there is nothing to be worried here, we are two hours away from its activity space. We need to climb over that small hill over there.\u201d One of the guards said but they did not know what Ye Song was trying to say.One day in this world was 25 hours. Other than that, it was pretty much similar to the \u201ctime\u201d on Earth.\u201cThat\u2019s good to know.\u201d Ye Song nodded, and he continued checking his surroundings carefully.\u201cThough I was not able to take the seed, I am still pretty confident about my archery skills. I think I will get something nice this time.\u201d Ye Song said.He turned back quickly and shot an arrow right after speaking.The arrow turned into a white flash in the air, and it hit the tree about ten meters away.A grey small snake was pinned on the tree, which died within seconds.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Approaching (Part 2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele ran towards the tree immediately. The two guards did not expect Angele to hit anything, and they were confused for a second before walking towards the tree.\u201cIt\u2019s a single-eyed snake, a red one!\u201d Angele checked the information about the snake before.The small snake on the tree was about the width of a finger, and it had a bloody red eye on its forehead; that was where its name originated. The color of its skin was very similar to the color of the tree. If it was not pinned by the arrow, the guards probably could not find it.Angele took out his sword and hit the snake\u2019s head precisely with the hand guard. The snake fainted right after, and it stopped moving.\u201cI heard its eye is good for me, I am going to eat it.\u201d Angele said in a light tone.The two guards did not know if they should stop their Young Master or not.Angele took out a hunting knife from his belt, and he spent some time trying to gouge the snake\u2019s eye out. Finally, he had the red bloody eye in his hand, and he threw it into his mouth right away. Angele did not chew it, but only swallowed it.Though the snake had strong venom in its teeth, its eye had no venom at all. The two guards decided not to stop Angele because they did not want to disappoint the Young Master.They watched Angele swallow the eye, and they saw a weird expression from his face.\u201cLet\u2019s keep moving.\u201d Angele said, and threw the dead snake to one of the guards. The guard took out a linen bag and placed the snake in it.The guards had no idea what was going on, and they soon heard the sound of an arrow hitting the tree again. Angele smiled, and he quickly ran to the tree that wasn\u2019t too far away. The guards saw another single-eyed snake pinned to the body of the tree.\u201cYoung Master, splendid shot!\u201d One of the guards said, \u201cWe couldn\u2019t even see the snake on the tree from such a distance.\u201d He was surprised actually.Angele heard the praise, but he did not say anything; he just smiled.He walked to the tree, and retrieved the arrow back into his quiver. This time he hit the snake\u2019s eye, and it was a mistake. If the eye was hit, it would not be edible anymore.Though the chip could help him modify his action after finding the target, he still needed a lot of practice to master it. When he was on Earth, people were competing with their archery skills one kilometer away from their targets. They used mechanical bows, and they could hit targets from a long distance. People all had chips assisting them, so the ones who practiced more had a better chance in winning the competitions.\u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201d Angele said.The group of three started to look for targets in the forest, and Angele had a hit rate of 60%. The two guards were kind of used to his performance. 60% hit rate was more like an average performance in a forest with so many trees. Angele did not have the seed, and he needed more strength to unleash the full potential of his high quality longbow. He would be no threat to a strong warrior; he was more like a common archer.Half an hour later, the two guards had their linen bags full. The bags were full of animals Angele hunted, such as squirrels, grey rabbits, and single-eyed snakes. The guards could barely carry anything else.\u201cGo back and put those down, I will wait for you here.\u201d Angele said. \u201cI am just going to take a rest here.\u201d He threw the snake he had just gotten to the guards while speaking. Angele stabbed the snake\u2019s mouth, and he took the white venom sac out of it before the guards put it away.The guards grabbed the dead snake, and they looked at each other for a second.\u201cHank will take those back; I will stay here with you.\u201d One of them said.\u201cThat\u2019s fine too.\u201d Angele nodded. He was kind of tired, so he sat down by a tree. He had eaten about forty snake\u2019s eyes. He could feel there was something warm in his body, and he felt he could perform actions faster now.One of the guards took the animals back to the castle, and the other one sat on the grass by him.\u201cActually, we\u2019ve already heard about the benefits of the snake\u2019s eye. Someone once tried it before, but nothing happened.\u201d The guard smiled, and he said.\u201cNothing happened?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYes, they had a bad time in the toilet, but nothing else happened.\u201d The guard answered.Angele nodded; he knew that this method would probably not work for everybody. The report from Zero stated that this method was only compatible to certain people. The raw eye balls of the snake had a special element in it, and it could help Angele increase his agility. People had their differences for sure, and the method might only work at a certain age range.Angele was happy with what he obtained today. He missed several shots on purpose because he did not want to astonish the guards too much. He could easily hit every shot with the help of the chip.\u201cI am done for today, let\u2019s head back.\u201d Angele said after resting for awhile.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The guard said.They went back through the route they came.The next fifteen days, Angele went hunting every day in the forest, and the people in the castle began hearing of his superb archery skills. People weren\u2019t surprised anymore about the huge amount of animals he could hunt every time.*****************It was high noon in the forest, and the shades that was created by the sunlight underneath the trees were sliced into pieces by the leaves.A white-feathered arrow was shot by a man.Another single-eyed snake was pinned on a branch.Following some tense footsteps, a teenager in a green hunting suit appeared, and he held a black short bow in his hand. He came out of the high grass, and two young warriors wearing grey armors were behind him.\u201cAnother one.\u201d One of the young warriors said, and he smiled.The teenager nodded and walked towards the branch. He took the arrow out, and grabbed the snake. He took the snake\u2019s eye out quickly with his hunting knife, and he swallowed it right after.He could feel the warmth coming from his body, and he felt comfortable in his mind.\u201cAre we done today, Young Master Angele?\u201d One of the guards asked.Angele closed his eyes, and he smiled.\u201cI am going to find some more today; you two can go back and put things down first. I can probably find a black deer.\u201d He said.The two guards knew that Angele\u2019s ability was enough for the outer forest, and there was barely any animal that could hurt him. They grabbed their bags, and they returned at a slow pace.\u2018Check my body condition.\u2019 Angele said in his mind after the two guards left.\u2018Angele Rio. Strength 0.8, Agility 2.4, Stamina 1.6.\u2019 Zero reported.Angele was satisfied with the result.He had already eaten hundreds of bloody red eyes by now. It seemed like he had reached the maximum amount he needed, and eating more wasn\u2019t going to be helpful anymore. However, he had improved his agility to a very high level, and he was satisfied. The training also helped him improve his stamina.Even without the help of the seed, Angele had achieved a lot. However, his explosiveness was still horrendous; he could\u2019ve done better if he had the seed. The seed probably could\u2019ve doubled or tripled his fighting power, but there was nothing he could do about it.\u2018But\u2026\u2019 Angele thought.He smiled, and he drew his sword. He performed a front slash so quick that it was nearly inaudible in the air. The branch in front of him broke into pieces and fell down. His speed was faster than Alad\u2019s demonstration at the training grounds.\u2018And\u2026\u2019 He thought.Angele looked at the broken branch, and there was a fly on it. He was actually aiming at the fly\u2019s wings, and its wings were cut off precisely. The fly was still moving on the branch.\u201cI am not a weak ass playboy anymore.\u201d Angele sheathed his sword, and he ecstatically laughed.******************A guy in grey was drawing closer to Angele from about one hundred meters away. He tried not to make any noise as he stepped on the grass quietly. There were birds and insects making noises in the forest, so Angele probably did not hear anything at all.\u201cRight here?\u201d The guy stopped, and he tried to hide himself behind a tree.The guy was named Dice, and he was a member of the assassin guild called Dark Emblem. He was an extremely careful man, and he would make sure he collected enough information about his target before starting his mission. Though he had the skill of a knight, he was still very careful, and that was the reason why he barely failed any mission.\u2018Assassination target, Baron Rio. Decapitate his head off as proof. According to the information, Karl Rio has the level of a knight. He took down ten heavy-armored cavalrymen on his own before, and he escaped successfully after.\u2019 He went through his mission in his mind one more time, and he was not too concerned about the baron\u2019s power.\u2018Ten heavy-armored cavalry? That means nothing\u2026 That\u2019s why I hate the countryside. They are like the frogs trapped in a deep well and know nothing about the world. Ha.\u2019 Dice thought; he had just killed twenty heavy-armored cavalrymen and a knight consecutively not so long ago.He was trying to follow the order; otherwise, he would\u2019ve probably just rushed straight into the castle and left after killing everyone.\u2018Such an easy mission\u2026 Killing a random lord at the countryside, and just a regular knight\u2026\u2019 Dice had killed numerous knights in his life, and he really did not think this one would be any different.*******************Inside the castle, the conference hall.The baron was sitting on the chair with a disappointed face, but he did not say anything.Audis and Wade were sitting by his side, and they both had solemn expressions on their faces.\u201cAn assassin from the Dark Emblem, who might be the one behind this? He probably paid them really good.\u201d Wade said. \u201cDark Emblem is a huge organization, and they are all over the country. Their members are all very strong. Big trouble this time.\u201d He was really worried.\u201cThey sent me a letter saying they are coming for me.\u201d The baron said in a deep tone, \u201cThey are telling me when I am going to die. There is one thing I don\u2019t understand, though. It takes thousands of gold coins for one to buy a kill from them, yet my whole territory only makes several hundreds of gold coins per year\u2026 Am I really worth that much?\u201d The baron wondered.\u201cThere is nothing to fear. We have three knights sitting here waiting for them.\u201d Audis said.The baron was still angry about it. He was playing with the letter he received. The letter was all black, which only had a bloody red spider symbol shining occasionally on it. It made the letter look strange and beautiful at the same time.[TL Note: Author replaced Ye Song to Angele starting from this chapter for some reason; I am following the original text for now.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: DangerTranslator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele walked towards the deep forest while holding his bow. He was already quite familiar with the area after hunting for half a month. He once met a white-scaled boar in the deeper area, but he dealt with it easily, so he wasn\u2019t too worried about going deeper.\u2018Strange target detected. Proceed with caution.\u2019 Blue-colored information appeared in front of Angele\u2019s eyes.\u2018Something new appeared?\u2019 Angele was excited, and he grabbed a white-feathered arrow. He nocked the arrow on his bow, and aimed it slowly towards the blue point marked by Zero.He firmly applied force by pulling the bowstring along with the arrow backwards, with the black arrowhead reflecting the sunlight. Angele completely drew the bow and released the bowstring.BAM!The arrow flew into the air like a white flash.DANG!Angele suddenly had an extremely bizarre feeling in his mind. He sensed danger creeping up on him, and he felt fear. He felt as if the arrow was going to fly back and strike him right in the face.Suddenly, some data was sent to his brain by Zero, but he had no time to check. Angele rolled towards the left side with his full strength, and he hid behind a tree.BOOM!It sounded like something exploded inside the woods. The tree was still shaking after the collision, and Angele could see tree leaves falling down like it was raining.\u201cWhat?\u201d A deep voice came from the other side, and it sounded like the man was surprised that Angele didn\u2019t get struck.Angele was still in shock, and his face turned pale. He was still behind the tree, and he was breathing heavily. His forehead was soaked in cold sweat.If he didn\u2019t roll towards the back of the tree, his head would\u2019ve probably been smashed right now if he was even just one second late. The chip saved his life at this instance where Angele was so close to death.\u2018Shit, what should I do?\u2019 Angele could not think of anything.\u2018I don\u2019t want to die again\u2026 I can\u2019t just die again like this!\u2019 Angele thought.Angele was still panicking, and his face turned paler.Angele was just a normal young man before reincarnating into this world, and he was living in a peaceful place on Earth. He would even consider hunting as a dangerous activity back then, and now he was in a much worse situation.\u2018Run! Yea! Run back! I will be safe after reaching the castle!\u2019 Angele suddenly realized the situation. He did not hear any noise after the explosion, and he felt a bit worried.The desire to return back to the castle pushed him to start moving again. He lowered his body and slowly moved towards the direction he came from. Suddenly, the chip alerted him again.\u2018Right side! Leg!\u2019 Angele knew where the attack would be coming from, and he rolled towards the front quickly. His head hit something on the ground during the process, but there was no time for him to think. He stood up and swiftly ran towards the route he came from.BANG!Angele heard the sound of something hitting the ground he was at.\u201cDamn!\u201d The man was cursing at the other side. \u201cSecond fucking time!\u201dAngele ran like crazy, and the trees on both sides seemed like were flying. He knew the place pretty well through all the hunting he had done. Even though the forest\u2019s route was pretty complex, Angele was not slowing down at all.However, he had this chilly feeling from his behind. He quickly rolled towards the front again, and he could still feel the chill from his back. Angele decided to hide behind a tree again but the chill just would not go away.He was getting panicked again. He bit his teeth hard, and he kept rolling around. Angele\u2019s body was getting hurt by the rocks and branches on the ground, but he did not care. He just could not escape the chilly feeling on his back.\u2018Turn back and block.\u2019 Zero reported.However, Angele was too scared to turn back. He ran around like crazy. He was still about 100 meters away from the cavalry\u2019s training grounds because he had gone too deep into the forest. The 100-meter distance felt like a thousand to him.\u2018Turn back and block.\u2019 Zero kept reporting.HUE!Angele rolled again.He could hear the sounds of a metal chain from behind. The chain had the thickness of a human arm. It went around the tree in front of Angele and wrapped around it. The chain blocked Angele\u2019s escape route.\u201cKeep running, you little rat!\u201d The man\u2019s voice came from back. \u201cFuck, what is going on today?!\u201d He seemed enraged.Angele wanted to start running again, but he decided to roll towards the right. The chain flew right beside him again, and was pinned on the tree in the front.\u2018I... I can\u2019t run anymore\u2026\u2019 Angele felt hopeless. He was unable move due to the chill that kept him from thinking clearly.\u2018I am going to die again?\u2019 He slowly stood up and turned around.A man in the black showed up from the bushes. The middle-aged man was covered in black, and he wore a black mask. His eyebrows were blonde, and he was holding the two chains in his hands.\u201cYour end is coming.\u201d The man released one of his chains, and a black flash flew out of his hand. Its speed was way faster than the previous attacks. Angele could hear the sound it made.Angele stood at his current position, and he could imagine how painful it was going to be.\u201cI don\u2019t want to die\u2026\u201d He was talking to himself.Angele kept repeating those words, and the voice of his own self echoed continuously within his mind. The chain was getting closer and closer. It became a black point from Angele\u2019s view.\u2018Lower your body and draw your sword, block it beside your head.\u2019 Zero reported again.Angele\u2019s desire to stay alive made him act. He drew the sword quickly, and he tried to block the oncoming chain.DANG!The force of the chain was way too strong, and Angele could feel it from his sword. His face turned red, and he spat some blood out of his mouth.The shock from the hit woke him up. If he had no way to run anymore, he would have to fight to survive! Angele focused on the enemy, and his heart kept on beating rapidly.\u201cYou are lucky, young man!\u201d The man in black said, and he waved his hand. Two chains were somehow released from the tree, and it started to return to his hands.The man stared at Angele for a second, and he disappeared in the bush. Angele did not move until he could not see the man anymore. He knew that if the man did not leave, he would\u2019ve been a corpse by now. Even with the help of the chip, he could not keep up with the chain\u2019s speed. Angele had never fought a true battle before, and his current opponent seemed to be a veteran fighter. If he did not follow the chip\u2019s report, he would\u2019ve already died even before the chase began.After resting for a while, he found a black card on the ground and picked it up. The card had a black background color and a bloody red spider symbol in the middle; it was kind of shiny.******************Dice\u2019s arm was hurt before the fight ensued.He was trying to get the young man; unfortunately, he was injured by the arrow. He did not expect an arrow to be coming. Though he blocked it in time, but his right arm still got affected. For some reason, he was losing strength, and he felt awful after being struck.\u201cDamn!\u201d Dice touched his forehead and noticed that he had a fever. \u201cThe arrow actually had poison on it! That little fucking bitch! He dipped the arrow with venom! How sinister he is!\u201d He kept cursing, and then he took out a yellow tiny paper bag. He opened it and ate the white powder inside it.\u201cAlmost lost my life here\u2026 Thank god, it was just the venom of a red single-eyed snake, and I prepared for it.\u201d Dice said, but he still felt sick. The arduous actions he did after being struck made the venom travel faster through his body. It might take hours for the medicine to work.\u201cNext time I will get you first!\u201d Dice yelled. \u201cA black card is not enough, you almost made my mission fail!\u201dHe stepped on a branch, and he fell to the ground. A sharp stone injured his head, and he started to bleed.\u201cWhat the\u2026!\u201d Dice was so mad. \u201cFucking piece of shit!\u201dHe was completely enraged.*******************In the washroom.Angele closed the door and sank himself into the bathtub. The warm water surrounded him, and he felt rested. He did not realize how dangerous this world was until today.He had basic sword skills and the assistance of the chip. He even increased his stamina, and he had believed he was very close to a post-knight. However, having the skills was very different from knowing how to fight against them.He poured water over his face, and he thought of the black card the man left.\u201cThe card means he will come back for me?\u201d He talked to himself; he knew something similar from Earth. He became nervous from just thinking about it. The unknown had always brought fear and mystery. He wanted to know what the card actually meant.He got out of the bathtub and used a towel to wipe himself dry. He changed his clothes right after.\u201cYoung Master, do you still need hot water?\u201d Maggie\u2019s voice came from outside the door.\u201cI am fine.\u201d Angele wiped his hair, and he opened the door.He went out of the living quarters right after finishing the shower.It was night.There were still children on the training grounds practicing. The wind blew across Angele\u2019s body, and he felt very comfortable. He went across the training grounds and then to the main building. The baron\u2019s book collection was there inside a special library.Besides the baron, Audis, and Wade, only Angele had the key to the special library, therefore showing how important he was. In this world, books represented knowledge, and books were objects of extravagance and wealth. Only nobles were allowed to read books. A single book costs about forty gold coins. Though people were willing to buy books, people rarely sell them.There were two guards guarding the main building. They saluted to Angele after seeing him coming.\u201cYoung Master Angele.\u201d They greeted.\u201cIs father here?\u201d Angele nodded, and he asked.\u201cThe baron is not back yet, but Knight Audis just left with Kerry.\u201d They answered. Kerry was the son of Knight Audis. There was also an arena in the main building, and the two trained in the arena regularly.\u201cAlright.\u201d Angele walked into the main hall.Besides the elders, there were only two types of people in the castle: those who wanted something from Angele and those who did not. Kerry was the second type. He had the talent of a knight, and he was just acting respectful to Angele. Kerry was actually looking down on him, and he kind of represented the opinion of other post-knights in the castle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Furious (Part 1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeIt did not take too long for Angele to reach the special library on the third floor. He took out the key and unlocked the door. The room had no light at all, and it was very dark. Angele closed the door carefully, and he locked it. He lit the candle on the table, then finally seeing the room clearly.There were three bookshelves in the room, but they were not completely filled up with books. The books were made out of leather; they looked heavy, and were very thick. Angele walked to the back of the third bookshelf. According to his memory, there was a strange book at the back of the bookshelf that was full of bizarre information, and he sometimes read it to kill time.He also took out someone\u2019s biography, and he walked to a reading desk. He started to read carefully. After a while, the candle was nearly out. He finally found a page with an image of the black card he had obtained. He took out his card and compared them carefully, and they were completely similar.\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Angele said, and he started checking the words at the side of the image.Dark Emblem, an assassin organization across several countries. Their targets would receive black cards before the assassins would actually kill them. There was only one sentence by its side, but it was enough for Angele to understand what was going on.\u201cThat guy will be coming for me.\u201d Angele said, and he started to worry again.\u2018Fear won\u2019t help me anyway. I need to find a way to deal with him.\u2019 He calmed down quickly this time and thought clearly. He thought over his day when he was in the bathroom, and he could calm down much faster now.\u2018I\u2019ve died once. It\u2019s fine if I die again.\u2019 He laughed.\u2018Zero, did you get the data of the man that attacked me?\u2019 He asked Zero in his mind.\u2018Data collected and marked as Dataset 1. Name Unknown: Strength 4, Agility 1.5, Stamina 5. Weapon category: chain hook, longsword, knife.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Holy, how did I survive that\u2026\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018He was poisoned before engaging.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Poisoned?\u2019 Angele was trying to remember what happened before the chase. He shot an arrow, and it probably hit the man. He started dipping his arrowheads with the venom sacs he had found from red single-eyed snakes, and he could easily track down the preys if they were hit. He would burn the wounds to remove the poison if he wanted to eat them.Angele started to scan through the biography quickly and used the chip to store all the information. He could search the data easily after, and it was like he only needed one second to scan all the words on the pages.Besides the information about the black card, Angele also had something else he wanted to know. There was a record of a certain small flower. The author stated that there was a flower could make people become very strong within a duration. However, the aftermath was brutal as the people who ate the flower to fight their enemies all died afterwards. It looked like they died due to sudden heart attacks.Angele stored the picture of the flower into his chip, and the flower had a fire-like red color. He went through the two books again before putting them back. He heard the footsteps of someone before he tried putting out the candle.The door opened with a \u2018Ka Cha\u2019 sound, and the baron walked in with a serious face. He did not expect someone to be in the library, and he looked at Angele.\u201cAngele, still reading?\u201d The baron asked.\u201cYes, father.\u201d Angele saluted, and he spoke with a light voice. \u201cI am heading back.\u201d He said.\u201cAlright.\u201d The baron was not in the mood to talk. His hair was all over his shoulders, and he looked very tired.Angele did not know what to say, and he decided to just leave instead.\u201cWait.\u201d The baron asked before Angele could go down the stairs. \u201cI will send you to the Noman city, your aunt\u2019s place. I am pretty busy recently, and I probably won\u2019t have time for you. You can have a good rest there. What do you think?\u201d He asked.Angele turned back; it was actually a charming offer. He might escape the assassin if that man came for him.\u201cWhat\u2019s this smell? Some fragrance from women? Angele, you need to control yourself, don\u2019t spend too much time on it.\u201d Before Angele could answer, the baron stopped him and said that.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Angele was trying to explain.\u201cWell, never mind. Go have some rest.\u201d The baron stopped him.Angele did not say anything; he left the room after seeing the baron waving his hands. Angele could hear his own footsteps in the darkness.Angele walked down the stairs; he could see light coming out of the special library. He was a bit confused.\u2018Check my body condition.\u2019 Angele said.\u2018Angele Rio. Body condition: Strength 0.8, Agility 2.4, Stamina 1.6. Status: Healthy, but with a special fragrance.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Special fragrance?\u2019 Angele was surprised. \u2018When did I get it, and where did it come from?\u2019 He asked.\u2018You got it before leaving the forest, and the smell comes from your right feet.\u2019 Zero reported, and it showed Angele the graph of his body. Angele could see some blue circles around his right feet.Angele confirmed his guess; the man in black left it on him. It was probably used for tracking. He ran into the bathroom again and asked the maid to bring him a bucket of water. He put his right feet into the bucket and started to wash thoroughly.\u2018Is it still on my feet?\u2019 Angele asked after washing for a while.\u2018The concentration was not lowered.\u2019 Chip replied.\u2018I knew it would not be gone that easy.\u2019 He thought; the fragrance was probably made for tracking.\u2018He really wants me dead\u2026\u2019 He thought.\u201cLet\u2019s see who is going to survive next time\u2026\u201d Angele whispered, and his face became solemn.******************It was the next morning, and Angele woke up before it got bright outside. He changed his clothes to a white hunting suit and walked down to the training grounds. Some people were already training there.Dang!A half-naked strong old man was hitting the forge with a large black iron hammer. There was a teenager standing by his side listening to the words of the old man, and they noticed Angele\u2019s appearance right away. The old man put down his hammer, and he walked towards Angele.\u201cHow may I help you, Young Master Angele?\u201d The old man\u2019s voice was deep.Angele looked around the shop.\u201cI want a good complete set of body armor.\u201d He said.\u201cGood complete set of body armor?\u201d The old man was a bit speechless. \u201cI have that, but it probably won\u2019t fit you very well\u2026\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t fit my size?\u201d Angele was confused.\u201cThe lightest set has a weight of over forty pounds.\u201d The old man said.Angele understood the reason. Based on his current strength level, forty pounds was probably too much for him, and his agility would then be greatly impacted. It was not a great idea for him to wear such a heavy armor.\u201cWell, can I just get some iron balls then? The ones that can pull the carriages?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cWe have a whole bunch of that here.\u201d The old man pointed towards the corner of the shop.\u201cYou can take as many as you want since they are made out of leftover iron. They\u2019re perfect for parking the carriages.\u201d The old man said.Angele nodded, and he looked at the corner. There were a lot of round black iron balls there, about twenty or thirty of those. They were about the size of a hand, and it seemed burdensome to carry. They were forged to help store the iron in an easier way, and they could be used in many situations.Angele thought of telling the baron about the fragrance on him, but he wanted to decide his own destiny. Also, he saw the baron had the same black card as he did, and he thought it was totally his fault.\u2018If I can\u2019t take care of myself in this world, I won\u2019t live long. I can\u2019t just rely on others all the time; I have to do this myself.\u2019 Angele thought calmly. Since the baron had the card too, he was probably one of Dark Emblem\u2019s targets too. Also, the baron was not stronger than the man in black he met; the baron\u2019s data was even a bit lower. The baron looked apprehensive last night, and Angele did not want to make things more complex. Angele had advantages on agility, and he could probably try to retaliate with it. Last time, he wasn\u2019t prepared, and he was trying to figure out a plan this time.Angele asked several workers to carry the iron balls for him, and he took about ten of those balls. He also asked the maids to bind the balls with linen ropes and hang them over the beam inside his room.He spent a long time to do everything, and it was already dinner time when he realized it. The red sunlight came through the window and poured onto the ground. There were about ten iron balls over Angele\u2019s head right now. They looked like a bunch of cannonballs, and they were hung in a certain arrangement.Angele stood in the middle of his room, and he examined those iron balls calmly. He took a deep breath, and he locked the door.\u201cLet\u2019s get started.\u201d He said, and he walked toward the first iron ball at the other end. He pushed the ball, and the ball started to swing. The iron ball matrix. This was exactly what he wanted. It was a game he played when he was on Earth, and he was pretty good at it. He could stay in the matrix for over an hour.However, he played it with the AI on Earth, and now he was trying to use it physically. It was not easy, but the chip\u2019s report said it would help him with his body\u2019s development.PONG!An iron ball hit Angele\u2019s chest when it swung back, and Angele lost his balance right away. The other balls started to hit him following the first one. He was simply knocked away from his original position.\u2018How long do I need to recover?\u2019 Angele checked with Zero after the fifth time he was struck by a bunch of iron balls.\u201920 minutes.\u2019 Zero answered.Angele nodded, and he walked out of the door. He ran to the training grounds quickly; it was already a bit dark outside. Kerry and his father Audis were sparring against each other on the grounds. Both of them were using crossguard swords. Kerry seemed to be trying his best, and there was sweat all over him. Audis was very calm, blocking Kerry\u2019s attacks easily.There were many people watching the sparring, and people were all cheering for them. The place was boisterous.Angele stood at a place slightly far away from the audience. He watched them spar carefully. Audis sometimes picked people to train with him in order to give them battle experience. Angele watched all of them, and he collected the opponents\u2019 datasets. After half a month, he got the data of every strong fighter in the castle.\u2018Are we done, Zero?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Data completed: 70%. Audis, Karl Rio, and Kerry\u2019s sword skill data are complete.\u2019 Zero reported.Angele stopped watching, and he walked towards the dining area. He already gathered what he needed. Most of the workers in the dining area were out at the training grounds, cheering. There were only several maids cleaning there. One of them saw Angele coming, and she walked towards him.\u201cYoung Master Angele, the things you\u2019ve ordered are here. But I am not sure if I got them all, I did not have enough time.\u201d The maid said, and she looked a bit nervous.\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Angele asked the others to leave.\u201cIn the kitchen.\u201d The maid answered.They walked into the kitchen quickly. Many fruits, vegetables, and meat were placed on a large table in the middle of the kitchen.\u201cThis was all I could find.\u201d The maid said.\u201cAlright, you can leave now.\u201d Angele said, and he walked towards the large table quickly. He wanted to sample all the food in this world, because he was trying to find something else that could boost his attributes. He then asked a maid to try collecting all the food she could find in the castle.He gave two silver coins to the maid, and she seemed ecstatic about it. She bowed and left the kitchen after closing the door. There was a candlestand in the kitchen, and the place was a bit dark even with the light from the candle.Angele grabbed a purple fruit on the table. It looked like a purple orange, and he took a bite on it. The taste of its juice was a bit spicy and sweet.\u2018Analyze the fruits. Let me know if you can find anything that will boost my stamina.\u2019 He ordered.\u2018Analyzing contents\u2026\u2019 Zero started to work.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Furious (Part 2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappePurple fruits, red veggies, blue-colored meat, and several nuts of different types; Angele had eaten a whole bunch of those. He stood in the kitchen waiting for Zero\u2019s analysis.\u2018No enhancement effect detected.\u2019 Zero kept repeating those words.After half an hour, Angele finally found some usable veggies.\u2018Good for strength enhancement. Possible negative effect: Diarrhea. Please name the data.\u2019 Zero reported. Angele was not sure if he should be happy about the result. He finally found a helpful veggie, but it would give him diarrhea.\u2018Name it as Blue Bamboo Shoot.\u2019 Angele said while looking at the veggie.It looked really like the normal bamboo shoots on earth, but it was blue. It had a soft, but crunchy taste, and Angele could smell some flower-like aroma from it.\u2018Naming finished, Blue Bamboo Shoots. Consume three times a day; a total of 30 times will increase your strength by about 2 points.\u2019 Zero reported. Angele looked at the blue-colored data, and a graph of the bamboo shoots was shown. It also indicated the head part of the bamboo shoot contained most of the essence, which could increase his strength.\u201cBamboo shoots\u2019 heads\u2026?\u2019 Angele grabbed one of the bamboo shoots and took a bite on its head. It tasted slightly bitter at first, but turned slightly sweet after. This vegetable was used as a digestive support by the locals, but no one knew that it could increase people\u2019s strength. However, Angele had to eat it more than 30 times and no less than 150 grams every time.\u2018Alright, analyze the data of the sword skills gathered recently. Combine them all and find the most suitable set for me.\u2019 Angele ordered. The chip worked best when Angele gave proper orders.\u2018I hope the chip could multitask\u2026 It could save me a whole lot of time.\u2019 Angele thought while eating the bamboo shoots. After finishing 150 grams of the bamboo shoots, Angele still wanted to try some other food. However, he found nothing useful after that.He left the dining area, and he returned to his bedroom; Angele started to train with the iron balls again. Maggie and Celia were trying to converse with him recently, but he tried his best to avoid them. He absolutely had no time for them. He followed his plan for the next several days.PONG!Angele blocked an iron ball with his right palm. It was early in the morning, and the light outside the window were all over him. He was alone in the bedroom with the door locked.\u2018Is the sword skill set finished?\u2019 Angele asked while breathing heavily.\u2018It was finished three hours ago, please name the set.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Basic sword skill set.\u2019 Angele randomly named it.\u2018Name saved. Would you like a visual demonstration?\u2019 Zero asked.\u2018Yea.\u2019 Angele said.Zero inputted the images into Angele\u2019s brain. Angele started to see simulations within his mind, and there was a guy standing there. He looked similar to Angele, and he used the sword to make a front slash. He then attacked the front side and followed up with a left slash, right pointing slash, and a low slash. He was attacking the same point, and the whole process only took two seconds to finish.The speed was very fast, and Angele felt like he was seeing an illusion attacking the same point with four slashes. Right after that, the man demonstrated blocking techniques, advancing techniques, full power strikes, parrying skills, and evasive maneuvers along with many other basic sword skills. Everything was fast and simple, and it looked very smooth.After the simulation was finished, Angele was able to see his bedroom again, and he started to contemplate about the whole skill set.\u2018This would probably be the best set I could use at the moment, and the chip made sure I could perform all those.\u2019 Angele thought, and he grabbed the crossguard sword by the desk. There was an insignia of the Rio Family on the handguard of the sword. It looked like an eagle trying to fly out of the thorns, and the body of the sword had a silver color. It looked very shiny.Angele drew the sword carefully, and he started practicing. Suddenly, Angele heard the sound of horses stomping the ground outside. He opened the window immediately. At the main way out, the baron was riding on a white horse. He wore a complete silver-colored armor set, and there was a huge black sword being carried on his back. The blade had a width of a human\u2019s head. There were ten cavalrymen behind the baron.They left the castle as a squad quickly. Angele looked at them until he couldn\u2019t see them anymore.\u201cMaggie!\u201d Angele yelled after closing the window.The maid knocked on the door quickly, and Angele opened the door.\u201cWhat happened, Young Master?\u201d The maid was still wiping her hands; it seemed like she was washing something.\u201cWhere is my father headed to?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cThere was some trouble over the silver mine, and the baron was going to check it out.\u201d The maid answered.\u201cOkay.\u201d Angele nodded. \u201cYou may continue with your own thing now. Oh wait, how is Cecilia doing?\u201d He asked.\u201cI asked her to keep your bedroom clean.\u201d The maid replied politely.\u201cOkay.\u201d Angele said.\u201cYoung Master, Knight Audis has returned to his territory this morning, and Wade has been recruiting new maids recently. Several thieves were sentenced to death not so long ago; it could get noisy in the castle after, so he asked me to inform you about it.\u201d Maggie said.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Angele nodded, and he closed the door. It was November, and it was usually the time to recruit and calculate taxes. November was the busiest month of the year.Angele checked his body condition after closing the door. His strength had gone from 0.8 to 1.4, and it seemed the Blue Bamboo Shoots were working distinctly well.\u2018It\u2019s about time. I need three or four more days to finish my preparation.\u2019 Angele thought. \u201cThere is only one last thing to do.\u201d He looked at the iron balls and said.******************In the forest outside the castle, Dice was standing on a branch and gazing at the castle.\u201cHa, Angele Rio, I am going get you first before the mission. You played me like a fiddle last time, where can you hide now?\u201d He said. Dice found out who the young man was when he got back. He could not believe that he did not get the playboy, and his pride could not allow that.He was well-prepared before heading to the castle again and thought his plan was perfect. Dice saw the baron left the castle, so he decided to kill Angele first and get the baron on his way back. He crouched on the branch, and he waited patiently for the entrance to be opened.Suddenly, the door was lowered. A young man came out of the castle with two guards, and they were walking towards the forest. Dice got angry after he saw the young man\u2019s pale face.\u201cThat\u2019s him! This little punk! Great\u2026\u201d Dice laughed, and he left the branch. He disappeared into the forest.******************Angele had his sword on his belt and his longbow on his back. There was also a black ring that he was using to protect his finger.Angele walked towards the forest alone, and the guards were sent back by him after a long conversation. They were already used Angele\u2019s habits, so they did not think it would be dangerous to leave him alone in the forest.But this time, Angele had something important to do, and he could not let them know. He walked across the training grounds and entered the forest.\u2018Unknown suspect in front, prepare to defend.\u2019 Zero reported right away.Angele felt a chill similar to last time again, and he rolled towards the front without thinking. A silver knife flew towards his original position right after; he would\u2019ve died already if he did not roll forward.\u2018That\u2019s him!\u2019 The situation reminded Angele about what happened last time. He felt infuriated because he had no way to fight back that time.\u2018Let me know where he is.\u2019 Angele asked. He stood up quickly and hid behind a tree. He took out an arrow from the quiver as planned. He also dipped poison on the arrowhead and shot it right towards the enemy.\u2018It isn\u2019t snake venom this time\u2026\u2019 Angele was completely focused, trying to hear any movement.\u201cDie!\u201d He said. He fired an arrow again, and he once again hid behind the tree afterwards.The arrow looked like a white flash, and it was fired into a cluster of high grass. Angele could hear the sound of blocking. He was getting excited as he knew his life was in danger.Angele heard the sound of the metal chain. He did not hesitate and fired another arrow, and he then ran out of the brush. He was running in an \u201cS\u201d like route to avoid potential attacks.Angele could hear swift footsteps from behind; the opponent was chasing him. He kept firing arrows and rolling around. He found a downhill slope, and he rolled down to the ground. Angele drew his sword right after; he had no time to take care of the mud on his face.\u2018I am still not good enough, but at least I can try retaliating now.\u2019 Angele thought while holding his sword with both hands. The blade was also dipped with poison.He could hear the footsteps from above getting closer. Angele took a deep breath, and he gathered all his strength. He glared towards uphill like a snake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: The Fight (Part 1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe footsteps were getting closer. Angele was gripping the sword tighter and tighter, and he was trying to hide his body out of the opponent\u2019s sight. Angele jumped up after the footsteps stopped, and he raised his sword above his head to block. A black shadow appeared on top of him, and the sound of metals clashing with each other resounded in the air.DANG!Angele blocked the chain with his blade, and then he jumped back right away. His face turned red, and he looked at the man in front of him calmly. The man stopped his attack and pulled his metal chain back.\u201cAngele Rio, I heard you were a dumb playboy with absolutely zero talent. I did not expect you to be able to handle my attacks. It seems that rumors are not always accurate\u2026\u201d The man in black took his mask off. He looked like an average middle-aged man, and there was a big scar on his face. It looked like his face had been bitten off by some beasts.\u201cWho are you? Are you from the Dark Emblem?\u201d Angele did not lower his guard.\u201cYou know about the Dark Emblem? Ha.\u201d The man laughed, \u201cMy name is Dice.\u201d He held his chains on his left hand.\u201cWell, it is just my codename. I can\u2019t tell you my real name for sure. I thought it was just a coincidence that your arrow got me last time. Based on your performance, it was probably not just a simple coincidence.\u201d Dice said.\u201cYea?\u201d Angele started to survey the surroundings while listening to Dice. They were at a natural groove, and the mud there was wet and soft. The smell was not good at all.\u201cAre you trying to run?\u201d Dice laughed. \u201cSadly, you can\u2019t run away from me this time.\u201dHe leapt towards Angele after finishing the conversation.DANG!Angele slashed Dice\u2019s hands, but the black metal gloves on Dice\u2019s hands protected him.\u2018Support function enabled. Jump towards the back and slash right after.\u2019 Zero said in Angele\u2019s mind.Angele jumped back a little bit, and he slashed at the front right away.\u201cDamn!\u201d Dice was surprised; he had to dodge the attack. He was almost struck in the chest, and he started to sweat. Dice unsheathed his sword after dodging the attack.\u201cLittle punk, you are making me an\u2026\u201d Dice didn\u2019t have the chance to finish his words.Angele tried to do a downward slash and followed it with an upward slash. However, his attacks were all blocked by Dice, but still, he was able to prevent Dice from attacking him.Top-right, and then switch position; top-left, and then switch again. Angele was moving flawlessly. Once his attack was blocked, he just switched positions. He was trying to strike Dice\u2019s weak point. With the chip\u2019s assistance, Angele could perform his skills rapidly and precisely. His combos were flawless, and he looked like a dancer in the woods.He was using his advantages well. Even though his strength was still lower than Dice, he could force Dice to defend for awhile. Dice could only try and keep up with Angele\u2019s pace. Angele\u2019s combos were improving faster and faster that he did not need the chip\u2019s assistance anymore. Even if he got blocked, he would find a way to attack Dice\u2019s other weak points.DANGDANGDANGDANG!The sound of swords clashing with each other became louder and louder. Angele was attacking from different angles, and he was borrowing the force exerted by Dice to counterattack. Dice\u2019s face finally turned red as well, as he did not expect Angele to have the advantage. He was way too slow to strike back; though he was an experienced killer, he could not react to Angele\u2019s speed.A melee fight was not in Dice\u2019s favor. He had no time to talk at all because he saw that Angele\u2019s blade had a weird blue tint to it. He did not want to touch it at all.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Dice was becoming completely enraged. He suddenly jumped far back away and took out five silver-colored knives from his pouch at the back. He threw all of them towards Angele; two were aimed towards the chest, and the rest were aimed towards the head.Angele became surprised by the knives\u2019 appearance, and he had no time to dodge. He had to roll to the left and block the front with his sword. Two of those knives were blocked by the sword, but two other ones grazed his shoulders. His shoulders started to bleed, and the last one hit his left arm.The last knife embedded into Angele\u2019s left arm, and he was bleeding badly. It was very painful. Angele\u2019s face got pale, and he took the knife out of his arm. Then, he rolled towards the left to dodge the chain, and he started to run towards the forest.\u201cWhere are you going?!\u201d Dice yelled, and he started chasing.Dice could not keep with Angele\u2019s speed, and Angele dodged several chain hits with the help of the chip. Dice slowed himself down while trying to attack.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u201d Dice screamed in anger, and he ceased chasing.He could not see Angele in his sight anymore, and he was breathing heavily. He did not have enough stamina to pursue him.\u201cI should\u2019ve poisoned my knives.\u201d Dice felt regret. He was not a fan of applying poison to his weapons. He had no idea why Angele could predict his attacks, and why Angele was much faster than him. He felt infuriated about it. However, he had found Angele\u2019s weakness.\u201cWell, if you could read my attacks, I will not give you time to do it\u2026\u201d Dice smiled, and he wiped the sweat off his face. He started to walk back.Suddenly, the sound of the wind came from Dice\u2019s back. He stopped right away and threw his chain towards the back. However, it was a bit too late. The shiny blue blade struck his right shoulder. He turned back and saw Angele who had a pale face. Angele somehow made it back within such a short duration. Dice totally thought he had run away already, and the stench of blood covered the fragrance of the tracking chemical.Dice wore leather armor, but his shoulder got injured as the blade cut through his skin. Dice became anxious as he knew that he got poisoned.\u201cYou are done\u2026\u201d Angele smiled, and he said.BAM!Dice punched Angele right in the chest. Angele was not able to dodge it, and he flew towards the bush on the side. There was blood everywhere. Some was on the tree, the grass, the black mud, and on Dice himself.Dice took out a small paper bag quickly, and he swallowed all the powder in it, but he could still feel something going on in his body. The poison Angele used took effect quickly.\u201cI have to go.\u201d Dice said as he felt danger.Angele stood up, and he was severely hurt after taking the punch. He could barely see things clearly.\u2018Check my body condition.\u2019 Angele ordered.\u2018Several broken ribs and gastrorrhagia. You are losing about 5% of your total blood.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Not a very big deal.\u2019 Angele was relieved. He stood up using his sword and looked at Dice. The assassin from the Dark Emblem was not having a good time, and his face looked completely blue. Angele mixed the snake venom with an assortment of other random poison to make his special blade enchantment, and there was definitely no cure for it.He tried the poison on a chicken, and it died with three minutes. He was not sure about how it would affect humans though, but it looked quite effective on Dice at least. Dice felt like he was getting paralyzed, and he decided to retreat after glaring Angele for a while. He wanted to get healed first since he wasn\u2019t sure what was going on in his body.His shadow steps and ranged attacks were not effective at all. His powerful melee attacks were useless due to Angele\u2019s high speed and precise sword skills. Dice also ended up being poisoned, and his best medicine could not really help him. He was very upset about the result because he really had no way to deal with Angele.\u201cAre you trying to run away?\u201d Angele noticed Dice\u2019s plan, and he spoke.\u201cI have one question before I leave, how did you find out where I was?\u201d Dice asked with a deep voice.\u201cI just knew it. Ha.\u201d Angele laughed, and he leapt towards Dice.DANG!The two swords clashed against each other once again. Dice couldn\u2019t handle Angele\u2019s force, and he stepped back for the first time.\u201cAH!\u201d Dice screamed and tried slashing Angele with all his remaining power. He did not even try to block the sword coming towards his face; he was just trying to trade his life with Angele\u2019s.The two swords struck each other at the same time, and blood started to come out of them. Angele and Dice held each others\u2019 shoulders to keep themselves standing. The blood was dripping down their clothes quickly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: The Fight (Part 2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeDice found it unbelievable that a young teenager had the nerve to trade hits with him. Angele\u2019s sword stabbed into Dice\u2019s right eye, and the blade came out of the back of his head. Angele exerted everything in this strike. Angele\u2019s left shoulder was severely injured; though he tried to avoid the sword that was going for his head, his shoulder was still grazed. Some parts of his flesh had been sliced off, and his bones became visible on the wound.Angele noticed that Dice was trying to retreat, and he saw Dice holding his chains in his hand. Dice was trying to use the chain as bait, and he\u2019d just run away afterwards. When Dice was focusing on his chains, Angele decided to advance towards him instead of avoiding the chain. That was probably his only chance, and if he let Dice go, Dice would come back for revenge later. With the help of the chip, he won the gamble and Dice was killed.\u201cI won! HAHAHAH!\u201d Angele laughed. He stepped back, and took his sword back. The blood made the eagle insignia look crimson. Dice staggered backwards and fell down to the ground.\u2018Leave the place within 5 minutes, the stench of blood will attract beasts.\u2019 The chip reported. It would warn Angele about dangerous situations automatically. Angele was so happy about his victory that he almost ignored the warning. He held his wound on his shoulder with a piece of cloth, and he slowly walked towards the body of Dice.\u201cI just won the fight\u2026 I need some trophy.\u201d Angele said. He was not so comfortable with looting the body, but he had to do it. There was one knife left in his pouch and an antique-looking emerald ring. The emerald had cracks on it, and there was also a small pouch of coins on Dice.Angele took everything and also grabbed the two metal chains. He also took Dice\u2019s sword, and he started to leave.\u201cWooooooo!\u201d A beast started howling in the forest. Angele heard it after walking only several steps. He became terrified, and he started to run back to the castle. The sound came from the place Angele just left, and he could die if he stayed any longer. The beast sounded much stronger than the boar he encountered earlier, and it might even be a mountain bear.The beast kept howling in the forest, and many birds flew out of the trees. Angele did not stop for even a single second and ran out of the forest at full speed. He thought Dice\u2019s body should be taken care of by the beast, and it probably saved him some time later.Angele saw the two guards when he had just left the forest. The two were worried about him and came back to check the situation. They probably heard the howl of the beast, becoming too nervous.\u201cYoung Master Angele! God! What happened?\u201d The two stared at the severely injured Angele running out of the forest.\u201cTake me back to the castle!\u201d Angele said while breathing heavily. He could barely stand still, and the two guards held his arms to support him. The cavalrymen on the training grounds saw the situation and quickly came to help. They helped Angele get back to the castle, and their training was stopped due to the loud disturbance created by the beast.*****************Rumors quickly spread in the castle. Some said that Angele was hurt while hunting, and some others said that Angele was robbed by the criminals. Some even thought Angele met the legendary mountain black bear.The maids, workers, and future knights were all gossiping about the rumor in their free time. Angele was placed down on his bed in the bedroom in the afternoon, and the doctors came to check his wounds. They carefully patched him up and told Angele the things he ought to do before leaving. Angele looked like a mummy lying down on the bed, and the light of sunset made the room look bright.Cecilia was sitting by Angele\u2019s bed. She decided to take care of Angele, and she was preparing some fruits for him. Angele slept for a long time after he got back, and he felt much better after resting and the wounds weren\u2019t that painful anymore. The iron balls in his room were taken by Cecilia and placed into a corner. The items Angele looted from the body were also cleaned up and placed on his bedstand.\u201cDid anyone come by when I was sleeping?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cMaster Wade was here awhile ago, and he saw you sleeping. He told me to take good care of you before leaving. Ms. Maggie and Ms. Celia also came to check on you.\u201d Cecilia answered.Angele nodded, but he did not say anything. The baron probably did not know about his injury. It would take about five days for him to get back from the silver mine. Even if someone was passing the information to the baron, it would still take several days. The silver mine was at the edge of Rio Family\u2019s territory and the castle was located at the middle of their territory.\u201cAlso, Master Wade said that the beast you encountered may have been an adult mountain bear. It is much stronger than the mountain black bear, and it is the king in the forest.\u201d Cecilia said.\u201cAdult mountain bear?\u201d Angele licked his lips and said. He knew it from the book in the special library. It looked identical to a mountain black bear, but it had much greater strength. Though it was slower than mountain black bear, it had an indurated skin and a strong resistance to poison. It was one of the top ranked beasts in the whole Rudin Empire. The mountain bear could probably fight two to four knights on its own, and it would get even stronger if it became enraged..The baron hunted a regular mountain black bear before, yet it was already a great achievement. If Angele met the mountain bear, he would be dead for sure.\u201cWell, I was lucky.\u201d Angele said. He was pretty scared when recalling the whole situation. He lied to the doctors when he was getting treated. He said he met someone that was fighting with the mountain bear and a sword flew over to his shoulder. A knife then hit him after the sword, nearly killing him there. He ended up grabbing some items on the side and went back with severe injuries. This was also the source of the rumors.The head of the doctors said Angele was extremely lucky that he did not lose his life there. He had no idea on how to explain what exactly happened to him recently. He got stronger within a short amount of time, and people would probably not believe eating random food could boost their attributes. Also, it was generally impossible for ordinary people to learn sword skill sets with such absurd speed. If he said he killed an assassin from Dark Emblem, it would become a really big news, and he would get into more trouble instead.Karl, Wade, and Audis would regularly check on Angele\u2019s progress before the time he fell off the horse, therefore they knew his capability. He practiced the sword skills with his father the day before he fell off the horse, so it would be difficult to explain why he was able to learn a whole set of skill recently. He needed to do something to make things seem more reasonable.Angele grabbed the items he looted and put them on the bed. A silver-colored crossguard sword, two metal chains, and a knife. There was also a ring and a leather money pouch. He opened the pouch first, and there were several coins in it. Some were gold and some were silver, however, it meant nothing to Angele because his monthly allowance was more than ten gold coins. Ten silver coins was equal to one gold coin, so Angele was not concerned about them.He put the money pouch aside and grabbed the metal chain. The chain was completely black, and had a claw on its end. It had some special paint on it, which made it shine during the night. It was also very sharp, and it slashed the bedsheet open when Angele put it down.The long sword had no insignia on it, and the blade was very sharp, too. It was made out of high quality materials. The body had no cracks at all even after the fight.\u201cGreat material.\u201d Angele said, and he decided to use it as his weapon.The last was the ring. He grabbed the ring, and it must be something special because Dice carried it with him the whole time.The ring had a copper-like color, but Angele was not exactly sure what the metal was. There was also no insignia on it, and it looked very simple. The ring itself had a rough surface, and it looked like someone rubbed it several times. In the middle was a round emerald, and it had cracks all over it.\u201cIt seems broken?\u201d Angele wondered, and he looked at it carefully. Cecilia was looking at him curiously before, but now, she was more curious about the ring.\u201cYou may leave the room for now.\u201d Angele said.\u201cOh\u2026 Okay.\u201d Cecilia was a bit surprised, and she put the fruits on the plate. She bowed to Angele and left the room.Angele started to examine the ring again after the door was closed. He had this special feeling that he could ascertain that the ring must be something notable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: The Kill (Part 1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele put the copper-colored ring on his palm. The emerald on the ring had the size of a nail. If it was not cracked, it would probably be clear and beautiful. It looked as if it was about to fall out of the ring. Aside from the cracks, Angele also saw some white patterns engraved on its surface.\u201cThere must be something special about it.\u201d Angele thought as he found it interesting. It was Dice\u2019s ring; he would not carry it with him all the time if it was not important. He looked at the surface carefully, and realized there was a word engraved on it.\u201cMa\u2026ss.\u201d The word was written in the universal language, so Angele could still read it.\u201cMass?\u201d Angele wasn\u2019t too sure if he was correct. \u201cThere might be another way to read it, like\u2026 Manss?\u201d The emerald started to shine right after Angele said the word.\u201cUnknown energy detected! Unknown radiation detected! Affected area or entity unknown!\u201d Zero started sending warning messages.Angele was surprised; he stared at the shiny green ring without doing anything else. The green color made his upper body look green as well. The whole room looked very weird as the green light filled it up. Angele could feel some chill wind blowing within his palm, and the wind was twisting. It felt like he was holding a mini tornado in his hand.\u201cWhat is this\u2026\u201d Angele was shocked, and the green light started flowing like a river. He could even smell the fragrance of the sea.\u201cUnknown energy is disappearing. Absorb it or not?\u201d the chip asked.\u201cWait? I can absorb it?\u201d Angele had no idea that the chip had this function besides passive support.\u201cWill there be any impact on me?\u201d he asked.\u201cNot enough data. It will have a positive radiation effect on your body. I can store the energy source,\u201d Zero said.\u201cAbsorb it!\u201d Angele had no time to hesitate because the green light was becoming fainter.The green light disappeared after some faint noise.KA!The emerald on the ring was now completely cracked, and it lost its luster. It looked like a normal green stone now. Angele held the ring in his hand, still thinking about the things that had just occurred.\u201cThis power\u2026\u201d Angele remembered something from the biography he read. It mentioned that there was once a group of people that were stronger than the knights. They could control lightning and wind. They could bring disasters, but they could also bring hope. They knew everything, and they had the same level of power as the legendary monsters.They called themselves Wizards, and they once existed in this world.\u201cThat was the power of the Wizards\u2026?\u201d Angele took a deep breath; he was getting excited.\u201cAbsorption complete. The energy can enhance your body slowly. I can start the enhance process if you want to, it will be very slow,\u201d the chip reported.\u201cEnhancement? How does it work?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cParts related to your agility,\u201d the chip reported.\u201cWait, don\u2019t do it yet.\u201d Angele thought of the Blue Bamboo Shoots. The enhancement process of the Blue Bamboo Shoots wasn\u2019t completed yet, and he could still use the bamboo shoots first. Though it gave him diarrhea, he could have as many bamboo shoots as he wanted. The mysterious energy was not unlimited, and it would be better for him to keep it first.\u201cOh, how long does the enhancement process take exactly?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cAbout 76 hours.\u201d Zero answered.Angele slightly nodded his head and grabbed the ring again. He wanted to check if the power was really gone.\u201cManss\u2026 It means light like the wind. That was probably the function of the ring?\u201d He was not sure, but he felt his body becoming lighter when he said the word. Maybe the enhancing effect was too small, and it could not help him in a real fight.\u201cManss! Manss!\u201d He said the word twice, but the ring did not shine at all. Though he knew the energy was gone already, he was still a bit disappointed. He decided to store the ring in his pouch.\u201cZero, tell me what food will help me recover faster,\u201d he ordered.\u201cStarting analysis\u2026\u201d Zero reported. The chip could easily find out what was best for Angele right now, and proper food selection would help him recover better than others.Angele stayed on the bed for about three days, and he was recovering fast. With the food selection that the chip provided, he asked the maid to bring him the right dishes, and it helped to recover faster. On the fourth day, the chip finally confirmed that he could now do some basic exercises.He could only barely walk recently, and all of his activities were in his bedroom. He could not go to the dining area to eat the bamboo shoots. He did not want to get diarrhea during the recovery period. Angele stood up and looked outside the window.\u201cIt has been a long time\u2026\u201d Angele said, and he shook his head. He grabbed the silver crossguard sword on the side; it was Dice\u2019s sword. His sword got broken after the fight, so he sent it to the blacksmith have it repaired. He left the room after changing to a white swordsman suit.Cecilia took Angele\u2019s dirty clothes to the washroom, and the maids at the stairs greeted Angele constantly. It was very quiet in the living area because the knights and the future knights went back to their own homes for the New Year\u2019s celebration. There were only few students left in the castle because they had no family.Those students needed to work in order to stay in the castle. They needed to guard the castle and patrol around the territory. After they became knights, they would need to work for the baron for five years before leaving. Most of them had the seeds, and they would probably become strong warriors in the future. It was like trading their services towards the chances to study in the castle.Angele learned from his memory that this was a common thing in the world. Some lords abused this tradition by forcing the future knights to do the most difficult tasks for them, and the students revolted after they became real knights. Those things actually helped the tradition to be fairer after because now, the lords knew how they should treat the students properly.Angele walked down to the training grounds, and he was the only one there. It was early in the morning and there were many clouds over in the sky. He felt a bit depressed.\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain.\u201d Angele said after glancing at the sky.He did not care if there were many students in the castle because he had no interest in them, and the students were not interested in him, too. The baron was young and strong; he could probably live for another fifty years, and those future knights were of no threat to him. He also did not care about others\u2019 thoughts towards him.The workers were in the bar drinking and chatting, and the girls were playing chess together. For noble children such as Celia, they were probably playing with some musical instruments. People barely had any entertainment at this age, so they spent most of their time working and studying.\u201cMaggie is probably playing chess right now.\u201d Angele guessed. In his memory, many people had dogs as pets in the Candia City. Nobles like Viscount Candia loved a dog called Haball; it came from some other country and its fur was white. Angele thought it looked like the German shepherd on Earth.However, the baron did not like pets, and no one was allowed to have one in the castle. Angele also heard that nobles from Rudin City loved to train eagles as pets, but he had never actually seen any.Angele walked towards the door of the castle, and there were two guards by it. They saluted to Angele when they saw him.\u201cAre you heading out, Young Master?\u201d One of the guards asked.\u201cYea, I need some exercise. Is Master Wade back yet?\u201d He nodded, and he asked.\u201cYes, Master Wade is on his way back, and it seems like he is bringing back many people. It will take him a while.\u201d One of the guards said in a light tone.\u201cMaster Wade told us to make sure you don\u2019t go too far away from the castle\u2026 Like the deep forest.\u201d He said.Angele smiled. Wade knew Angele would not listen to anybody other than the baron, so he only gave him a simple warning. Wade was just following the baron\u2019s order, and he was actually not too concerned about Angele because he did not have high expectations in Angele anyway. Also, Wade was not too worried due to Angele\u2019s archery skills.Angele left the castle alone, and he held his sword tightly. He practiced his sword skill set at the empty ground, and then walked into the forest. He started to run after entering the forest, and headed straight to the location where he fought Dice.About half an hour later, he saw the familiar downhill slope. There were still traces of dried blood on branches around. Two knives were still in the bush. Angele walked down towards the ditch and looked at the place that Dice was killed. There was nothing left besides some blood, and he could see the trail of the blood that went deep into the forest.Angele walked towards the blood trail and dipped it with his finger.\u201cHe was dragged into the forest.\u201d He whispered.Angele stood up and checked around. He took his quiver and longbow back, and took a glance at the blood trail again. After what happened with the green ring, Angele found this world much more mysterious than he thought. There was much for him to learn and explore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: The Kill (Part 2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele decided to head back to the castle, but suddenly heard people talking from his right side.\u2018Unknown targets detected, number of targets is two,\u2019 the chip warned. Angele quietened his footsteps and crouched. He then moved towards the right side slowly. He was able to hear them clearly from a closer distance, but Angele only caught some of the words being spoken.\"\u2026It has been 4 days\u2026We won\u2019t make it from here\u2026\" A man said with a deep voice.\"It\u2019s fine\u2026 We will make it before he comes back from the silver mine\u2026 We can just wait a bit longer\u2026but the time\u2026\" Another one was a lady with a sharp voice.Angele hid behind a large terrain and crouched behind the bush. He listened to the conversation quietly, but the two were moving, and the voices disappeared in the forest shortly. The two reminded Angele of the criminals the baron mentioned before. Knight Audis said the criminals were like trained military members since they were not acting like typical criminals. They had strong fighting skills.The baron was trying to capture those criminals when Angele first returned to the castle after being inflicted with severe injuries. He did not hear anything about the results. If they could succeed, there would be a celebration party, but if they failed, the baron would give out pensions to the families of the dead soldiers. It seemed that they just did not find any criminal when they arrived at the location.Angele did not fear fights any longer after the battle with Dice, and he was actually a bit excited at the thought of it. He had the help of the chip, and he acquired a strong set of sword skills. He had also increased his stamina and strength and was now very close to the level of a knight. With the help of his archery skills, he had become a decent fighter, and all he needed now was another chance to gain more experience.Though he had slain Dice, it was the poisoned blade that contributed the most. Angele decided to follow the two after thinking for a while. He followed the direction that the sound came from with the assistance provided by the chip. After about ten minutes, he found some footprints on the ground. The forest was soaked after the rain, so the footprints were easily visible to him.Angele walked faster after he found the footprints. He could smell the aroma of roasted meat in the air after a while, and he stopped there. He surveyed his surroundings. The trees here were tall, and the leaves pretty much blocked the sky. Only a few streaks of sunlight passed through the small gaps of the branches. Even if it was morning, Angele could feel the chill of a dark night.Angele took out his longbow and nocked a white-feathered arrow upon it. He dipped the arrowhead with poison as usual because he wanted to make sure that every shot would kill. Though he had a weapon on hand, he was focusing on the situation carefully.If the criminals were really the military members of the Saladin Empire, he could easily get spotted by them. Saladin Empire was a country located within a large forest, and most of the people there were impressive archers. They were familiar with forests, and they were the best fighters in such landscape. The king of the Saladin Empire was said to have been a descendant of elves.Angele was moving forward carefully, and the aroma of the meat was getting stronger. He was very close to their camp.KA!He accidentally stepped on something.\"Someone is here! Look out!\" Someone yelled. Angele could understand their language since Saladin Empire used a similar language to Rudin Empire anyways. Angele knew he had been detected.\u201911 enemies ahead,\u2019 the chip reported.Angele scanned the people and could see blue-colored lines marked on them. They were hiding in the bush and moving towards him quickly. They were like snakes, silent but swift.Some of them were trying to shoot their arrows at Angele, and their arrows had a green color that made them hard to spot. Angele had no way to run, so he decided to retaliate. He fired an arrow and it hit one of their archers. He could hear the screams of the archer. Angele then hid behind a tree, and nocked another arrow on his bow. However, he first decided to lure some enemies out, so he kicked a stone to the air.Three green arrows hit the stone at the same time, and all the arrows flew to the ground after the collision. Angele was surprised by the force applied on the arrow. They were no ordinary soldiers for sure, and they were probably close to the knight level. People could only fire such strong and accurate arrows after having body enhancements.Angele fired his arrow right after they hit the stone and another man was hit. The man started to scream too.\"Surround him!\" A man with a deep voice started to yell orders.Angele could hear them drawing their swords, and it seemed like they have given up on ranged attacks. They were trying to use the advantage of numbers. Angele was getting excited, and he put down his bow and quiver on the ground quietly. He then drew his sword. Though there were no footsteps that could be heard, Angele knew they were getting closer.Ding!He blocked an attack that came from his right. The swords they were using were very thin and slim, only about the width of a finger. After blocking, Angele applied force on the sword to make the man lose his balance, then he sliced the man\u2019s neck off.Angele\u2019s strength became powerful after eating a bunch of bamboo shoots. Dice\u2019s sword made him even stronger. After he finished the first one, he moved to the left and dodged another attack from his back. He then pointed his sword towards the back without looking, and the man from behind was stabbed right in the chest.\"Harry!\" A lady yelled.Angele licked his lips and ran towards the front. He jumped towards the left side and slashed his sword towards the source of the voice. The lady blocked Angele\u2019s first two attacks, but Angele easily sliced her head off. She died right away.The chip\u2019s analysis helped Angele catch every movement in the battlefield. There were eight people left, and they finally trapped him in the middle. They all wore green suits with tree leaves on them. The men all had handsome faces, and the females were all superbly attractive. Angele would probably hire them if they were not his enemies because he liked good-looking people for some reason.Though he was trapped, he was not nervous at all. He realized that he was much faster than them during the fight. With the help of the chip, he could dodge every single attack easily.\"Angele! It\u2019s Angele Rio! The son of Karl Rio!\" A girl yelled in rage. She looked like she was about 17 years old, yet she was already participating in such operation.\"How is that even possible!\" They were getting nervous.Angele smiled as he started to enjoy the feeling of playing with fire. He rushed towards the girl in but a second and slashed her neck open. Blood splashed into the air, and her head dropped to the ground. She died with a surprised expression on her face with her green eyes wide open.\"Kill him! God! He just killed Elena!\" Several men ran towards him in frenzy.Angele slightly moved his body towards the side, and he dodged two oncoming slim swords. He also blocked an attack from the front and borrowed the force from the attacker to counter slash. He turned back and slashed through a man\u2019s waist. The man got separated into two pieces and fell down to the ground. The blood coming out of him flooded the place.The rest of them were surprised by his reaction speed. Before Angele moved to the next target, he suddenly raised his sword above his head.DANG!Angele blocked a black arrow and was pushed back from his position.\"I will make you pay!\" A man screamed, rushing towards him from a bush. He was holding a black slim sword and started attacking Angele from multiple angles.\u2018A knight!\u2019 Angele thought as he became a bit surprised. However, since they escaped the baron, it was quite likely that they have knights with them, and Angele calmed down quickly.He blocked the attacks with his crossguard sword quickly, and he found that the man had faster attacks than him. However, the man\u2019s sword skills were lacking effectiveness. Sometimes it seemed like the man could be faster, but his unnecessary movements slowed him down. Angele blocked another arrow coming from the side and quickly checked the data.\u2018Unknown target: Strength is greater than 2, Agility is greater than 3, Stamina is lower than 2, but is greater than 1. He is using his full potential.\u2019 Zero reported.Angele stepped back and crouched right away. He pointed his sword upwards without even sparing a look.\"It\u2019s over.\" Angele said while jumping back.The man stood in his original position like a fiddle. Angele\u2019s sword went through his head from his chin, and blood came out like a line of water.\"No! Master Rica!\" Some people were screaming in agony.\u2018That\u2019s the power of my sword skill set,\u2019 Angele thought. His skill set was created by the chip, and it was pretty much like cheating because other regular skill sets always had certain flaws in them. The knight-level man fell down to the ground and died.\u2018This is the first knight level warrior I killed all by myself!\u2019 Angele was very excited, but he did not know why. He held his sword and rushed towards the other ones remaining. After the noises of metal clashing against each other, those people screamed as they died.The forest restored its tranquility once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Peace (Part 1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter a while, Angele wiped his sword on a corpse\u2019s clothes, trying to clean its blade. He looked around; there were decapitated body parts everywhere. His face looked a bit pale; though he had already killed someone, the current scene was too much of a shock to him.A breeze blew across the tree, and the leaves started to make noises. The sunlight mixed with shadows on the ground looked like the river flowing. Angele\u2019s silver sword shone under the sunlight as he walked towards the knight level warrior. He checked the man\u2019s belongings and found nothing aside from a coin pouch.\u201cThey were trying to hide their identities during the mission maybe?\u201d Angele guessed. He stood up, and he could smell the blood in the air. When Angele was about to leave, he saw a shadow coming from his right side. He did not expect it coming, and had no time to react, so he slashed towards it heavily.The \u201cshadow\u201d had a very bad smell, and it made Angele sick. He ran into the thing, and he was pushed far away from it. He rolled about ten meters away, but he did not get hurt. Angele finally got the chance to look at the thing.It was a huge black bear. The bear was about 3 meters tall and was standing straight. It was going to attack Angele again. From Angele\u2019s perspective, he felt like he was looking at a small hill.\u201cCrazy Mountain Bear\u2026\u201d Angele was scared after he realized what the \u201cthing\u201d actually was. An average Mountain Black Bear was about half of its size, and the baron had one of the Mountain Black Bear\u2019s skin in his hall as a trophy, so Angele was familiar with the beast.He did not have time to think, so he jumped backwards swiftly. He then pointed his sword at the bear\u2019s left eye. Though the bear was huge, it was still very fast and it simply slapped Angele\u2019s sword to make him lose his balance.\u201cCrazy Mountain Bear: Strength greater than 6, Agility greater than 2, Stamina greater than 10,\u201d Zero reported. Angele could not hear the report until the bear stopped roaring.When the opponent was much stronger than Angele, the chip\u2019s data was unable to help him win the fight. The chip was able to report the enemy\u2019s location to Angele because the opponents were at least close to him in terms of attributes.The chip\u2019s analysis was based on Angele\u2019s sensory information, and it would get stronger if Angele himself was stronger. The Crazy Mountain Bear had extremely high strength and stamina. Angele tried to fight the bear with his high agility. However, he could only barely damage the bear and his slashes did pretty much nothing to it. The bear\u2019s skin felt like thick metal, and his sword could not slash through it.Angele decided to run away quickly as there was nothing he could do. The bear did not chase him because it knew the target was much faster than it. The bear walked towards the bodies, and it started to have a nice meal.Angele examined the bear for a while, and it shook his head.\u201cIts skin is way too thick. I need some legendary weapon for it, or maybe higher strength would do as well? I can\u2019t damage it at all for now,\u201d Angele thought. The bear was eating, but it did not lower its defences. Angele saw that the bear was about to chase him, so he just left the place.Angele was satisfied with today\u2019s result. At least he gained some fighting experience, and he had gotten a better understanding of his own ability.\u201cMaybe I can go for the bear next time. I need to eat some more bamboo shoots.\u201d He thought as he left the forest.He killed some Saladin\u2019s troops and slew a knight level warrior. Angele thought his fighting ability had already reached the knight level, which meant he had similar power with the baron. He felt a bit relaxed as he knew he could protect himself now. Power was the only thing that matters in this world.The knight he killed was at a similar level as Wade and Audis. If Angele and the baron were at the top level among the knights, Wade and Audis would be at the middle level. The gap between the top and middle was huge. Dice would\u2019ve probably been at the top level, so he had the confidence in taking the mission of assassinating the baron. He was killed by Angele because his assassination skills weren\u2019t too effective on melee fights. Angele used poison and also had the chip\u2019s assistance. If they engaged in a regular fight, Angele would be the one dying.Average future knights with seeds would improve a lot during the first several months, and most of them would stay at the low and middle level after they became knights. They rarely gained top level power. Angele focused his training more on the skill side, unlike other great warriors who instead focused more on pure power. People in this world thought that if one was faster and stronger than the others, one would not even need skills to defeat them.Angele spent about ten days to conclude his recent fights after he got back to the castle. He was trying to figure out his mistakes during the recent battles, and he started to eat the Blue Bamboo Shoots after he recovered. The baron also returned to the castle, and he heard that Angele was nearly killed by the Crazy Mountain Bear in the forest.Fifteen days later.Angele was reading some random history book in the special library. He was using the chip to store everything in his brain. There were several hundred books in the room, and they were like a priceless treasure in this world. The Rio Family spent a long time to collect them.The book was all copied by hand, and the paper looked old, but still had a nice feeling to it.\u201cI wonder what material was used for those papers. Some books are still completely readable even after a hundred years,\u201d Angele thought. It was noon, and the sunlight went into the room through the window. Angele could see the dust in the air with the light.\u201cAngele.\u201d The baron opened the door, and he said. He had his long hair draped over his shoulders, looking shiny in the sunlight. Karl had a handsome face, but currently had a serious expression. There was a golden short sword on his waist, and he looked strong but gentle.\u201cFather.\u201d Angele quickly stood up and greeted the baron politely. He knew the baron treated him very well, so he wanted to at least show his gratefulness. Sometimes, Angele could see the worry in the baron\u2019s eyes, and he knew that the baron was just worried about his future.\u201cI heard you met the Crazy Mountain Bear in the forest?\u201d The baron said with a deep voice.\u201cYou heard about it? I was just trying to\u2026\u201d Angele spoke in a light tone.\u201cTell me the location!\u201d The baron stopped Angele from talking.\u201cFather\u2026\u201d Angele said.\u201cDon\u2019t make me repeat!\u201d The baron was a bit disappointed, and he had a cold look on his face.\u201cAbout 200 meters away from the north of the castle. I don\u2019t know the exact location\u2026\u201d Angele felt a chill from his back and told the baron the location. It was Angele\u2019s natural reaction since he just couldn\u2019t handle the pressure from his father.The baron glanced at Angele for a second and left the room.BAM!The door was slammed shut.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Peace (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele ran down the stairs right away after taking a while to understand what was going on. By the time he had arrived, the baron had already gathered and was overseeing a squad of heavy armored swordsmen on the training grounds.\u201cWho went to the forest with Angele that day?\u201d the baron spoke with a very deep voice.Some of the swordsmen looked at each other in panic, but no one responded.\u201cIf you hand yourselves in now, I will not go too hard on you. You know you did not protect your Young Master well,\u201d the baron took a deep breath, and he said slowly, \u201cAs per the rules, 20 lashes for now. However, if I have to find out who it was myself, I will make you suffer.\u201dIt seemed like the swordsmen became relieved after hearing the baron\u2019s words and two of them walked out of the group.\u201cBaron Karl, it was me and Hank. Please punish us!\u201d One of them spoke loudly.\u201cSomeone bring me my whip!\u201d The baron nodded as he said.One of the workers started to run to get the baron his whip. Suddenly, the baron drew his sword and stabbed it right through the heads of the two swordsmen. Everything happened in but a mere moment. The two swordsmen fell down to the ground, and blood started to trickle out of their heads.The training grounds became deathly silent.\u201cAngele is my son! If he dies, who is going to lead the Rio Family in the future?!\u201d The baron yelled with a cold smile on his face.\u201cYou should\u2019ve never let my son go into the deep forest alone. Are you trying to kill my son?! I could\u2019ve killed your whole families, but I\u2019ve already known you two for a long time. That\u2019s it for this time,\u201d the baron said.\u201cI hope I don\u2019t have to do this again.\u201d The baron looked at the other swordsmen as he spoke.\u201cSomeone burn their bodies!\u201d he yelled. Everyone watching the scene could not make a sound. People could not even breathe in such a situation, and they were trying their best not to make the baron angrier. Two of the swordsmen went to retrieve and carry the bodies away.\u201cGet me my weapon and my armor; I need to go to the forest,\u201d the baron said.\u201cYes!\u201d One of the workers said with a pale face, and he ran to the armory.Angele was at the side of the training grounds the whole time, and he witnessed the two guards that helped him recently die in front of him. He felt slightly forlorn, and at the same time scared. He also had a better understanding of the baron\u2019s temper.Angele saw the baron put on his golden leather armor and grab his greatsword. The baron left the castle and headed towards the forest. Angele knew the baron was going to hunt the Crazy Mountain Bear.\u201cFather\u2026\u201d Angele said with a faint voice, and he tightly gripped his sword with his right hand. He could feel the weight of his father\u2019s love in his mind, and it was very heavy. Angele knew his father was trying to convey a message to him that people needed to think about the consequences of their behavior by slaying the two guards.**********************Half an hour later, Angele heard the roars of the bear from the forest, and then he heard the sounds of battle. After a while, the baron walked out of the forest. There was blood coming out of his mouth and his left arm looked broken. However, he was smiling.The soldiers and workers were waiting for the baron outside the castle. Old Wade, the baron\u2019s sons and daughters, and Angele all stood there quietly and looked at the baron walking towards them. The baron was holding a thick black hide, which belonged to the Crazy Mountain Bear Angele encountered before.Angele was the only one who fought against the bear before, and he knew how hard it would be for someone to skin the bear. The baron must have had a good fight.\u201cFind the doctor now!\u201d Wade yelled, and the people around started to create a commotion. Some of them ran back to the castle, and some others tried to help the baron. Angele became teary-eyed after seeing his father fight the bear for him.Angele walked towards his father and assisted him with his hands. He looked at the baron, and he felt like he was looking at his father back on Earth.\u201cAngele.\u201d The baron smiled as he looked at him.\u201cI will protect you till the day I die.\u201d He said, and Angele felt extremely emotional. Angele had always felt the baron was his stepfather, but now it felt like the baron was the sole person who gave him his life.***********************Ten days had passed since the baron killed the Crazy Mountain Bear.Angele kept eating the bamboo shoots to increase his attributes during these days. He was trying to serve the bamboo shoots to his father too, but the chip reported that the enhancement effect was solely effective to Angele himself. It seemed like his body was distinctly different from other people around him. The bamboo shoots might help him a lot, but they would only make the baron\u2019s stomach ache. Angele felt slightly disappointed about the result.Angele thought that others just didn\u2019t know about the effects of the food, but it seemed that his body was special. He also felt worried that someone would know his secret of the food he had been eating, but no one seemed to care.It was lunchtime.Angele sat at the opposite side of the baron. The baron\u2019s wives, sons and daughters were sitting by the two sides. Not all of the baron\u2019s wives got to sit on the table, the only ones around were favored by him. There were about ten dishes on the table. There were meat stew, pan fried vegetables, steamed fish, and a huge piece of roasted beef that was sitting in the middle.The baron was cutting the beef on his plate and eating quietly. Each person had a maid standing behind them, and their duty was to serve them the food they wanted. Wade stood behind the baron, wearing a black noble suit. His white hair looked very flat.The baron was the only one with the highest authority on the dining table, and if he did not talk, then no one else could, except for Angele. But Angele had pretty much nothing to say.The people on the table only ate their food in silence; the current atmosphere being emanated was a tad bit heavy. Angele heard about a new rumor about the baron from some guards. He was able to hear them from a long distance away, most likely due to the increase in his abilities. He heard people talking about how the baron killed the Crazy Mountain Bear, and how the baron fought the king of the forest as a human being. People were also talking about how cruel the baron was and how they started calling him as \u201cThe Devil Baron\u201d.Being titled as \u201cThe Devil Baron\u201d meant that the baron was all-powerful, yet mysterious, like a devil. People began fearing him, and they even started to think that Wade and Audis were evil as well.Angele took a bite on the mushroom. Although he yearned for Chinese food back on Earth, the dishes here were ingenious and tasty. The only thing that made him sad was that people here did not eat rice, and there was only bread available in the castle. The nobles ate white bread while the maids ate black bread. Drinking soup while eating bread was typical here, but it took Angele a while to get used to it.Their lunchtime lasted for more than twenty minutes. When the baron almost finished his meal, a guard in leather armor suddenly rushed into the dining hall. The guard was blocked by a maid, and Wade went to investigate the situation. Angele saw the change of expression on Wade\u2019s face, and Wade whispered something to the baron.No one heard the information, but Angele was able to capture the words said with the help of his chip.\u201cAudis discovered plenty of iron ore veins in his territory, and it would be nice if you could check it out yourself,\u201d Wade whispered.\u201cIron ores?\u201d the baron became excited. If he could build a mine there, he would earn a lot of coins. After all, iron was also an essential commodity especially during wartime.\u201cNo time was wasted after the discovery. It would be better if we could head there now.\u201d Wade said.The baron thought for a while as he held his left arm. He hadn\u2019t yet recovered from the injury, but the discovery of an iron mine was an extremely crucial matter to him.\u201cYou stay in the castle. I will go there now.\u201d The baron said\u201cGot it.\u201d Wade became slightly surprised with the order, but he still followed it.\u201cI think I should go with you as you haven\u2019t fully recovered yet,\u201d he said.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d The baron waved his hands and said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: Intent to Kill (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cThough my left arm is not fully recovered yet, I think I will be fine on the road,\u201d the baron said. He completely drank the soup and stood up.\u201cI am leaving,\u201d he said, \u201cAngele, stay in the castle. Just don\u2019t go out until I am back. Understood?\u201d The baron looked at Angele.\u201cYes, father.\u201d Angele answered as he nodded in affirmation.\u201cUm\u2026 I think this trip will take me about half a month. The situation is terrible outside the territory. Wade, take good care of the castle.\u201d The baron turned back and said to Wade.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will protect the castle and Young Master Angele when you are out there,\u201d Wade said.The baron nodded his head and left the dining hall. His wives and children stood up and bowed to him until they could not hear his footsteps anymore. They sat down and started talking, the atmosphere becoming much more relaxed.Angele sat on his seat, and it looked like he was thinking of something. He was actually looking at the baron\u2019s body data Zero provided. The blue-colored information were presented in front of his eyes clearly.\u201cKarl Rio, analyzed 19 times. Body condition: Strength is around 2-4, Agility is around 3.4, and Stamina is around 3.9. Healthy. Attributes naturally increasing.\u201d Zero reported. Angele smiled after seeing the report. \u2018Healthy\u2019 meant the baron had already fully recovered, but for some reason he was trying to hide it.\u201cFather\u2019s arm was already fine, yet he pretended to still be injured. Maybe he realized something.\u201d Angele thought. He felt relaxed now after knowing the truth. The baron was stronger than ordinary top level knights and was probably also stronger than some of the assassins from the Dark Emblem. However, assassins like Dice were experts of stealth combat; they might be able to win a fight against the baron in certain situations.Angele started to eat again; he put a piece of fish into his mouth.\u201cI have finished my meal. Brother Angele, take your time.\u201d One of the girl on the left side said and bowed to Angele. She had silk-like red hair.\u201cI am done, too.\u201d A girl in black named Chia said, and she bowed to Angele. They left the table together.Angele nodded and let them leave. The two girls were about 11 years old, and their mothers were the baron\u2019s maids. They looked pretty cute, and the baron liked them. Their mothers were not maids anymore, so they were allowed to sit on the table. Though they were still not real nobles, but their position in the castle was higher than Maggie\u2019s family.People started to leave the dining hall after they finished their meals. Only Angele and some other teenagers remained after ten minutes, and he saw Celia was there too. She was sipping the thick, white fish soup, and she took a glance at Angele. Angele left the table after finishing his food, but someone stopped him before he left the dining hall.\u201cBrother Angele.\u201d Celia said, her voice was cute and crispy.\u201cYea?\u201d Angele turned back and looked at her.\u201cI heard Maggie went to your room several times recently\u2026\u201d Celia walked towards Angele quickly and said; she was blushing.\u201cWell, is there anything wrong with that?\u201d Angele asked. He did not touch Maggie at all, and even if he did, there was nothing wrong with it. It was a convenient way for smaller noble families to build relationships with noble families that were in higher positions.\u201cI was trying to wash myself in the bathroom, but the hot water there is not constant, and I am wondering if I could\u2026\u201d Celia said with a very faint voice. Angele smiled; he knew what was going on. In the castle, there was a special bathroom built for people like Angele, while the low rank peasants could only go to a large bathroom. In the large bathroom, there were some individual rooms built for people like Celia.The castle made sure the high-ranked nobles could have nice showers. For Celia, she could only use the individual rooms in the large bathroom. For the baron, Audis, and Angele, they had totally separated individual bathrooms, and there were maids making sure they could get constantly hot water. It would take the maids some effort to keep the water warm, so only a small amount of high-ranked people could enjoy their showers.However, Celia wanted more than just a shower. She wanted to shower with Angele. Angele looked at Celia; he could see her long black hair. The red one piece she was wearing made her look gentle but beautiful. She did not have a sexy body like Maggie, but she was still very cute. Angele stared at her white skin, and he could smell the fragrance she used.\u201cSure, I think I am going to get rid of the dust on me, too.\u201d Angele was enthralled by Celia and spoke with a smile on his face. Celia gave Angele a hug; Angele could see her face blushing heavily. Some of the girls in the room were jealous of Celia, while some of the boys were looking down on her. However, everyone was trying to maintain eye contact with Angele because no one wanted any trouble.\u201cLet's go.\u201d Angele put his arms on Celia\u2019s shoulder and said.\u201cO\u2026Okay.\u201d Celia answered.Angele knew Celia wanted something from him, so he decided to take advantage of her. He was not actually trying to have s*x with her, but he still wanted to have some fun. He avoided s*x because he wanted to make sure his body could develop properly.They left the dining hall together and went towards the living area after crossing the training grounds. Angele\u2019s individual bathroom was in the living area, and he asked all the maids to leave them alone. He also told Cecilia to stay in her room.Angele led Celia to his bathroom. Angele thought the bathroom looked like a standard washroom on Earth, just without the toilet part. The floor was built with shaped stones, and the whole room looked grey. There were white towels on a stone-made stand.Angele ended up taking the shower by himself because he was afraid that he\u2019d lose control if he took a shower with Celia, so he asked Celia to wait outside the room. Also, Celia already told Angele what she wanted.*****************************************************************************************************************************An hour later.Angele felt refreshed as he walked out of the bathroom. Celia was still waiting outside quietly.\u201cI will ask Wade to help you with the things you asked,\u201d Angele said, \u201chave some rest.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Okay\u2026\u201d Celia did not look at Angele directly and answered.\u201cMaggie!\u201d Angele yelled. Afterwards, he heard the footsteps of the maid.\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d Maggie said.\u201cTake Miss Celia back to her room. Go across the training grounds.\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYes.\u201d The maid said, and she left the place with Celia.Angele wanted people to know that he had \u2018slept\u2019 with Celia by asking the maid to take Celia back through the training grounds. There were many people there usually, and someone would often spread rumors. He was trying to help Celia get into a higher rank in the castle.\u201cWell, since I promised her, I\u2019d better move.\u201d Angele smiled as he said. He walked down the stairs after shaking his head. He went down from the fourth floor to the third floor, expecting Wade to be there. He wanted to tell Wade about the thing that Celia asked.Angele went to Wade\u2019s room and knocked on the door, but no one answered. Suddenly, he heard someone talking outside the window before he was about to leave. He then slowed his footsteps and walked to the window. The sound was coming from below.\u201c\u2026 Is that true?\u201d Wade asked. Angele, however, did not catch the first half.\u201cYes, Master.\u201d The guard said.Angele saw Wade talking to a guard at a corner through the gap of the window. He was a bit too late, and their conversation was already over. Angele could see Wade worrying about something, and the guard by his side remained standing quietly.\u201cWell, you can leave now.\u201d Wade sighed as he spoke.\u201cYes, Master.\u201d The guard answered and left afterwards.Wade stood at the corner for a while and left the place after sighing again. Angele could see him walking towards the living area.\u201cWade would tell me if there is something I need to know about. This must be something I cannot help with.\u201d Angele thought, and he decided to go down the stairs.Angele met up with Wade right after he went down to the first floor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You look worried.\u201d Angele asked.\u201cNothing special. I am just too busy recently, and I am already old you know.\u201d Wade said.\u201cAlright, could you do me a favor?\u201d Angele asked before telling Wade about the thing Celia asked. Her mother, Miss Katyusha, wanted Angele to remove her fruit import tax.\u201cSure, I can do that. I will remove the tax, but the amount of fruits she needs to import will not change.\u201d Wade said and smiled.\u201cYea, sure, thanks.\u201d Angele smiled as well.\u201cNow I have something I have to take a look at\u2026\u201d Wade said.\u201cSure, you can go.\u201d Angele had nothing else to say anyways. Wade went up stairs quickly, and Angele decided not to ask what actually was going on.\u201cWell, I will just keep increasing my attributes. I want power. Zero, check my body condition.\u2019\u201d Angele thought.\u201cAngele Rio: Strength 2.1 to 2.6, Agility 2.5, Stamina 2.2.\u201d Zero reported.The Blue Bamboo Shoots were working well for him. His strength increased from 0.8 to 2.6. That was the maximum number the bamboo shoots could help him reach. Angele could feel that his body was resisting its efficacy, and he did not find any other helpful food after.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s about time to use that power\u2026\u201d Angele made the decision in his mind.********************Ten days later in Audis\u2019s territory.It was early in the morning, and the sky was clear. There was a clean river running through the verdant forest, and the cobble in the river looked nice and colorful. A group of soldiers were letting their horses drink water by the riverside; the baron stood underneath a tree and looking at the route. A middle-aged man was standing beside the baron; his hair was already white. There was a silver long sword on his waist, and he looked relaxed.\u201cI did not expect to see you here, Chris,\u201d the baron said in a light tone, \u201cI still remember the moments where you fought by my side during the wars.\u201d\u201cYea, and you are always on the frontline. You also taught me several fighting techniques. I\u2019d be dead a long time ago if you did not help me,\u201d Chris said.\u201cWait, why are you here again? I thought you went to the north,\u201d the baron asked.\u201cKarl, did you get the letter from the Dark Emblem?\u201d Chris asked, \u201cThat\u2019s why I am here. There is something I have to let you know about. Come with me,\u201d he said.\u201cSure, I haven\u2019t seen you for a long time. We could chat for a bit, too.\u201d The baron said as he started to walk towards the forest. Chris also started to walk, and they disappeared in everyone else\u2019s sight quickly.\u201cI think no one else is here, tell me why you are here.\u201d The baron stopped after walking a while and asked with a deep voice.\u201cKarl\u2026 I!\u201d Chris remained quiet for a second and said.KA!Suddenly, Chris drew his sword and stabbed it right into the baron\u2019s waist, but somehow his attack got deflected by something.\u201cChris! You!\u201d The baron did not expect him to attack, and he yelled, but Chris did not talk as he continued attacking the baron again.\u201cTraitor...!\u201d The baron grabbed the greatsword from his back with his eyes filled to the brim in anger.********************In the forest outside the castle.Angele was disappointed as he walked out of the deep forest with his longbow in hand. It was already his fourth attempt in searching for the Crazy Mountain Bear. He wanted to slay it after he increased his attributes. He wanted to make it pay for what it did to his father. However, the thing never showed up even once. Angele had even tried to lure it out using blood.There was nothing Angele could actually do if it just didn\u2019t show up, so he decided to walk back to the castle. He changed his clothes and headed to the special library after he returned. That was the place he loved the most in the castle because it was quiet and peaceful, and he could enjoy his own time there.********************In the forest, the baron laughed as he raised his greatsword.\u201cFarewell, Chris!\u201d The baron said as he tried to attack.\u201cAhhh!\u201d Suddenly the baron\u2019s right eye was struck by an arrow from the bush. Blood started to ooze out of his eye, continuously dripping to the ground. A green arrow hit the baron\u2019s eye, making him drop his greatsword while in pain.Chris took this chance to roll away and stood up quickly. Though the baron was badly injured, he still tried to remain cautious.\u201cLisa! It\u2019s you! AHHH!\u201d The baron was yelling like crazy. He grabbed the arrow in his eye and pulled it out. Blood rushed out of the wound and spilled all over the grass. Two people walked out of the bush. One of them was a middle-aged woman who had a small bow in her hands. There was a black ring worn around one of her fingers.\u201cLong time no see, Rio.\u201d The woman was very calm.The other man made the baron become even more flabbergasted.\u201cAudis\u2026 You too?!\u201d The baron could not believe what happened, but Audis stood beside Lisa quietly and did not say anything.\u201cRio, you had such a high expectations for your future. You wanted too much! And the things you did for your son made too many people unhappy!\u201d Chris laughed and yelled.\u201cKnight Audis\u2019s son\u2019s girl was abused to death in your castle, and the reason why it happened was because your son said he wanted that girl. You need to pay for what you have done!\u201d Chris kept saying.\u201cWait\u2026 You guys waited until I was on my way to the mine. Wade is in this too?!\u201d The baron said. He stood up with his eye still bleeding.\u201cYes, otherwise someone will at least notice you are missing. My sister was killed by you, and my father! Today is the day you pay for all this!\u201d Lisa said.The baron stopped talking. He was going through his memories with the people in front of him. The woman he loved, the man he saved, and the young warrior who admired him were all trying to kill him now.\u201cKirin\u2026\u201d He also remembered the one he loved the most.It was a chance for the three, and they looked at each other before attacking.\u201cGo!\u201d Lisa yelled.The three grabbed their weapons and started attacking.****************\u201cFather\u2026\u201d For some reason Angele just felt that something was going on with his father. He had just met his new father after the reincarnation, but he could really feel the love from him. He held his silver family insignia in his hand. There was an eagle surrounded by some thorns on the insignia.\u201cSomething is wrong here\u2026 Wade was really worried there, and it seemed like my father knew nothing about it. Father had the most power in the castle so he should at least know if anything was wrong\u2026\u201d Angele felt so confused as if he felt like he missed something important.\u201cWhat am I missing\u2026?\u201d Angele said as he looked around the family insignia.PONG!The door of the study was pushed open. Angele turned back and saw Wade standing there, smiling. There were four heavy armored swordsmen standing behind him.\u201cYoung Master Angele.\u201d Wade said. The four swordsmen drew their swords from their backs, and the atmosphere became heavy in the room right after. Angele stayed in his seat and put down the insignia.\u201cWhat are you doing, Wade?\u201d He was surprised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Near (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cThe baron is not doing his job well. He does whatever he wants in the territory, and the taxes are way too heavy. I decided to do something about it to make the Rio territory peaceful again.\u201d Wade smiled as he spoke.Angele stared at them in surprise. He finally realized that they had betrayed the baron.\u201cWade, you decided to betray my father, too?\u201d Angele felt a bit sad because he actually liked Wade.\u201cToo? Ha, Young Master Angele knew about this already?\u201d Wade was a bit surprised. Angele looked way too calm, so he felt a bit worried.\u201cWell, since Young Master already knows about this, we could make things easier for you.\u201d Wade said.\u201cEasier? Ha?\u201d Angele laughed. He then drew his sword slowly and disappeared from their sight.\u201cAH!\u201d Suddenly, two guards outside the door yelled. Angele slashed their neck open, and they died without knowing what happened. Their blood splattered all over the ground.\u201cI have no need for traitors.\u201d Angele said.Wade never expected this kind of scene to unfold, so he forgot to react. He started to sweat profusely. Angele could see the sweat all over his forehead. Wade could not figure out what Angele just did. He was a mid-level knight, yet Angele was much faster than him.\u201cTop level knight?!\u201d Wade said, his voice shaking.Angele lowered his sword with a facial expression that screamed indifference, seemingly uncaring at all. He had slain two guards in but a second, and he really did not think Wade could do anything to him. There was a wide disparity between each level.\u201cYou are a top level knight?!\u201d Wade stepped back with a pale face. The young man just killed two guards easily, and at this moment, he was nonchalantly trying to wipe off the blood on his sword. It was as if the act of killing was something of a normal occurrence to him.\u201cI really\u2026 did not expect you to be a top level knight\u2026\u201d Wade knew he could not escape Angele\u2019s sword, so he just stood there.\u201cHow could Angele Rio\u2026\u201d He finally made up his mind and took out a black iron claw.\u201cYou took care of me for so many years. I will do it swiftly.\u201d Angele looked at Wade and said.\u201cHeh\u2026\u201d Wade knew his plan failed because no one would\u2019ve expected a playboy to be a top level knight.\u201cYou can kill me, but you can\u2019t save Karl.\u201d Wade calmed down, and he laughed.\u201cYea?\u201d Angele asked coldly.Wade yelled and started to run down the stairs like a ghost. He also threw something towards Angele\u2019s waist.Dang!Angele blocked the black knife easily, and the knife flew towards the stone wall. He then rushed towards Wade like a white flash, which was much faster than Wade. The two ran out of the living quarters and reached the training grounds. It was early in the morning and there were about thirty people training there.The two ran outside the castle quickly, and they were so fast that they looked like two shadows. One of them was white, while the other was black. The white shadow occasionally struck the black shadow, and people around could hear the noise of metal clashing against each other. No one actually knew who the two were, but they knew the two were at knight-level.The training grounds became lively, and the students were completely interested in the identities of the two. Only several teachers saw the clothes that the two were wearing, but they never thought that the two were actually Angele and Wade.Angele was right behind Wade. He had trouble reaching him. He could kill a mid-level knight, but if Wade was just trying to run away, Angele would not be able to kill him like how he killed the two guards. They kept running, and they were already several kilometers away from the castle. Angele was going so fast that the trees on the side became blurry.\u201cWade, you think you can run away from me? I am young and you are old. You won\u2019t last too long. How about you stop and tell me your whole plan. I can probably let you go. You served the family well all those years, after all.\u201d Angele said while chasing.\u201cLet me go?\u201d Wade laughed and stopped talking. Wade thought Angele was just like his father, so he really did not think that Angele could keep promises. The baron had just killed two guards after making promises at the training grounds. There was no way for Wade to trust Angele.If Wade kept running, he could probably escape Angele. Angele was a bit nervous. Though Wade was old, he still had his seed. The seed could help him increase his power within certain duration, and it could also boost his speed. Angele also wanted to make Wade spill the beans about the situation of his father.Angele grabbed something from his pouch and threw it right towards Wade. Wade heard something was coming and tried to avoid by leaning to the right, but his left arm was still grazed by it.\u201cIt\u2019s poisoned!\u201d Wade screamed and jumped away. He stopped at a large stone by the roadside. Angele stopped there, too, and looked at the old man that served Rio Family for so many years. He was having complex feelings about Wade.\u201cAny last words?\u201d Angele asked calmly. Wade tried to make his wound stop bleeding, but it seemed like nothing was working. He knew the poison was going to kill him.\u201cI guess I am done here. I did not expect a result like this, I just\u2026\u201d Wade laughed.\u201cI will leave you here, but I will take care of your family. Also, I did not kill you.\u201d Angele sighed, and he took out a black card. There was a bloody red spider shining on the card.\u201cYou are an assassin from the Dark Emblem? You are just fourteen years old and you already have ability like this\u2026 How talented you are.\u201d Though Wade was not sure if Angele was the assassin, or if Angele killed the assassin and grabbed the card, he knew he could not win this fight.Wade took a deep breath; the poison had already paralyzed half of his body.\u201cI will tell you where the baron is, and the actual situation. Just make sure my family is taken care of.\u201d Wade said, and then he started to tell Angele of all the things he knew.**************************BOOM!Audis was blown away and flew towards the bush on the side. His blood that splattered on the ground left a trail. In the forest, the baron was holding his greatsword while still standing. Blood was still trickling out of right eye slowly, and there were wounds all over his body. He had a crazed expression on his face while glancing around.\u201cWe were the best group in the army, but now\u2026\u201d The baron suddenly started laughing. Chris and Lisa were standing by the trees, and the three formed a triangle. Chris had a wound on his left arm, but it was not deep.Lisa was severely injured and her waist was almost cut open.\u201cKarl, everything has to end today!\u201d Lisa yelled in pain, her shaking voice apparent. Audis finally stood up in the bush and spat out some blood. He tried to support his weight using his sword. It looked like he was hurt, too.\u201cI thought we were on the same level\u2026\u201d Audis laughed.The baron\u2019s long hair was covered in blood, which made it look like it was glued together. However, he still looked wild and gentle.\u201cI treated you like my own blood, Audis! You\u2019ve really disappointed me\u2026\u201d The baron said.\u201cDisappointed?\u201d Audis laughed.\u201cYou had all the power in your hand, and you had Kirin, too! I gave you my silver mine and my son\u2019s girl! Why?! Why did I do all those things?! You are going to die!\u201d Audis yelled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Near (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeIt looked like the baron was trying to say something, but he decided not to talk. The wound on his eye made him lose a lot of blood, and he knew there was not much time left for him. If he did not take the arrow before the fight started, he could probably handle three knights easily, but now, he was trying his best to stay alive.'I can't give up my life here, Angele still needs me.' Karl thought. The most important person to him was his son, and the beautiful woman he could sometimes meet in his dream.\"Why? Karl, are you afraid of death?\" Lisa asked coldly, and she saw the baron was trying to escape. \"Today is our best chance. You are not going anywhere!\" She yelled.The three surrounded the baron, but no one wanted to be the first one to attack again. They were hurt during the first several attacks, and the baron's power was out of their expectation. The baron was dying, and they could probably just hold their positions. The baron might try to at least get some of them if they started to attack again. At this point, no one wanted to make a dangerous move.*********************Angele was running towards his father as fast as possible. He was so fast that he could barely see the trees by his sides, and he was only looking at the front. Angele learnt the location of the baron from the dying old Wade. Angele was actually familiar with the location, and he still remembered the days he spent there when he was young.Knight Audis took him to hunt there many times, and Angele knew the location when Wade said the name. He knew he had no time to waste, and his father's life was on the line. Angele almost reached the limit of his speed. He had an agility of 2.5, and it was about twice of an ordinary human being. However, it would take him a lot of stamina to maintain his speed, and he had to take some rest along the way.Angele knew he needed stamina to help his father, and if he used up all his stamina, he might just die with his father. He also took the poisoned dagger back, and he wanted to use it as a secret weapon.*********************The baron slashed forward.DANG!There were sparks flying off in all directions.Audis blocked the attack right away, but his whole body was shaking, and there was blood coming out of his mouth. Audis's face was soaked with blood and sweat, and it looked horrifying. On the side, Lisa kept firing arrows towards the baron, but the baron dodged them easily by leaning to the sides.Chris quietly moved his position, and stabbed the baron in the back. His slim sword went into the baron's strong muscle, but got stuck there. The baron used his elbow to fight back, and his attack landed on Chris's chest. Chris screamed and fell down to the ground; he spitted out a good amount of blood. It was looked like a bear pushing a human away.The baron then pushed Audis back, and turned around. He ran into the forest behind him.\"He is trying to escape!\" Lisa yelled. The three got excited, because they knew it meant the baron could not handle the attacks anymore.Without hesitation, they followed the baron into the forest.**********************Angele ran to a high ground in the front, and he wanted to view the whole forest. The location he got was part of the forest and he needed some other intel. Luckily, his chip could do the job, and he decided to scan the area for living beings.The high ground looked like an empty ground, and there were only some stones on it. No grass or plant could be seen. Angele had a great view of the area on it.\"Zero, scan for human beings, and try to recognize Karl Rio if you find any.\" He said.\"Scanning...\" Zero reported.Suddenly Angele's sight was covered with blue colored information and data. Human beings were being marked as red dot in the forest.A group of merchants, two men walking around the forest, some robbers, and several red dots were shown by the edge of Angele's sight.'Scan completed, Karl Rio was located, about 13.4 kilometers from here.' Zero reported.'How's his situation?' Angele got excited.'Losing blood, chasing by three knight level people.' Zero reported.Angele left the high ground right away, and started to running towards the location at full speed.*********************In the forest.The baron was running around some small paths. He started to feel the weight of his greatsword, and it was not a good sign. He could easily carry it for days if he was not hurt. The leather armor on him was broken into pieces.There were three people following him in the back, and they were his best friends. But now the three were just trying to take his life away. The baron's face was getting paler and paler, and he was sweating heavily. Some of the sweats got into his wound, and he felt extremely painful.His right eye was not bleeding anymore due to his excellent recovering speed, but the wound looked infected. The three in the back were not trying to get close, and it looked like they just wanted to waste the baron's stamina. However, the baron could not stop even though he knew their plan.Suddenly an arrow was fired towards him, and the baron dodged it easily. The arrow hit the tree by the side, and dropped to the ground.\"You are not going anywhere, Karl!\" Lisa's voice came from the back, and she sounded very tired.\"You guys are going to die too!\" The baron yelled, and he knew it was a competition of their stamina levels.Chris started to accelerate, and got very close to the baron quickly. He again tried to stab the baron's back, and Audis tried to attack with his greatsword from another angle. His greatsword was very heavy, and the baron could hear the sound it makes.The baron rolled back and dodged the attacks. He then hit Chris and Audis with greatsword, and they flew to the side. The baron did not control his strength well, and the blade went into a tree on the side.At this moment, Lisa jumped to front and tried to stab the baron with her black dagger. She was light and fast, and the baron was still trying to take his greatsword out of the tree. He looked at the coming dagger, and somehow he was very calm. He saw the angry face of Lisa, and he was not scared at all, he was actually thinking of someone else.\"Angele... How are you going to survive this world alone...?\" The baron said while staring at Lisa.DANG!Lisa's dagger was hit by a silver flash, and the two weapon sparked a little in the air. The silver dagger was thrown with extreme power, and Lisa's balance was broken in the air, she fell down to a bush on the right.A familiar face appeared from the shadow, and everyone there was surprised.Angele was breathing heavily, and there was sweat all over him. He was holding his sword tight.\"Father...\" Angele said. The baron stared at his son, and he thought he was dreaming.\"I am getting you out of here, father!\" Angele finally smiled after seeing his father was still alive.\"And I will kill everyone who is trying to hurt you! I am going to hang their heads over the entrance of the castle!\" Angele yelled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Leaving (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele's words silenced the three people behind. Audis looked at Angele and tried to figure out how strong he was.\"Good, I didn't know a playboy like you actually had such strong power. However, it is too late!\" Audis said.\"What do you even mean by that?\" Angele walked forward and stood by his father's side. He lowered his silver sword.\"It's simple.\" Chris coughed and said.\"You really think Karl is our only target? I think your castle is in chaos right now. We brought an army there.\" Chris said as he laughed coldly.\"Wade... And?\" The baron asked.\"Karl, aside from your son, almost everyone in the castle is on our side. Just give up already.\" Lisa said. Her abdomen was greatly injured but she still maintained a calm demeanor.\"Also, Saladin's soldiers will arrive here tonight and their first target is your castle!\" Lisa said.\"You are with the Saladin Empire?!\" The baron got angry, and said. Angele had mixed feelings about this because he knew the Saladin soldiers he had killed were up to something.Angele drew his sword and jumped towards Chris, trying to mount a surprise attack on him.DANG!Chris was able to block Angele's slash, but he still took a hit. Angele then quickly attacked Chris with a low kick, smashing against his abdomen. Chris lost his balance and stepped back to stabilize his body. His face turned pale and stared at Angele with a surprised expression. Angele immediately seized this chance to finish him off, but his path was blocked by a greatsword.Without hesitation, Audis tried to chop Angele's head off with a quick but precise attack. The baron saw the situation and tried to help, but Lisa jumped on him. Angele dodged the slash with ease and aimed his sword toward Audis's right chest, but his sword was blocked by Chris's slim sword.Angele had just travelled a long distance at full speed on foot so he was out of stamina. After his attack was blocked, he had to step back and keep his distance with the two. Angele could deal with Audis by himself because the latter was already severely hurt. Audis had high strength while Chris had high agility; their abilities complemented each other.The two became surprised at Angele's speed, and then they stopped attacking. Angele was gazing at them intently and trying to formulate a plan to win the battle.\"Master Audis, I never thought we would be in a fight like this. I actually find it funny...\" Angele said as he was trying to recover his stamina.\"Me too. I didn't know you were so strong. Karl has a good son.\" Audis said in a light tone, and it seemed that he was trying to recover some stamina. He decided to have a little chat with Angele.Angele smiled. Though he was stronger than Audis and Chris, he was still having trouble fighting the two at the same time. However, he had stored a great amount of data about Audis in his chip.'Analyze the situation and devise a plan to execute Knight Audis.' Angele ordered.'Beginning analysis... Gathering data... Finished. Plan completed.' Zero reported.'Show me the plan.' Angele thought.'Visible data placed in front of you.' Zero reported.Angele started to see the blue colored information points in front of him and his vision was covered with helpful hints. Audis's weak points were marked with red dots and the plan devised by Zero was sent to Angele's brain. Zero suggested possible ways of attacking and the possible counterattacks Angele might face.Zero could easily do that if it had enough data. Angele raised his sword and rushed towards Audis, and he struck Audis's greatsword three times in a row. He then turned around and dodged the attack from Chris. After dodging the attack, he rolled to the right and hit Audis on the ribs with his left elbow.\"Shit...\" Audis failed to dodge it due to the weight of his greatsword, but he managed to punch Angele right in the chest in retaliation. Angele and Audis jumped back again with the latter's face turning pale. The strike inflicted on his rib was right at the wound the baron inflicted on him. Audis felt really sick and really wanted to vomit.\"Damn...\" Angele stepped back right after he got punched. Chris chased him down and started attacking him again.They both had high agility and they kept blocking each other's blades. Suddenly, they backed off after trading hits. Chris had his hands covered over his neck as he sat down by a tree. His face was drenched in sweat, and Angele could see blood leaking out of Chris's neck. Angele almost cut Chris's neck open, but Chris somehow dodged the deadly attack.Angele's left side of his waist was stabbed and the wound looked like a bloody hole. He successfully stopped Audis, but he still had trouble dealing with Chris after. Audis and Chris were very close to the top level, and if they were not hurt before the fight, Angele would have a hard time.However, the tides of the battle had been turned. Audis probably lost the ability to fight and was in great pain. He held his stomach with his hands, his organs were injured. Angele had twice the strength of a normal human being, and his low kick had been aimed right at Audis's weak point. Even if Audis could survive this, he would probably sit on a wheelchair for the rest of his life.Angele looked at Audis and stopped his wound from bleeding by putting pressure around it. He grabbed his sword with his right hand and turned toward Chris. They both took a hit, but Chris was still bleeding badly and his face turned paler and paler.On the other side, the baron kicked Lisa on the waist and the woman flew toward a tree on the side. Leaves fell down after the impact and were soaked with the blood coming out of Lisa.\"It's over.\" Angele said. Though he was hurt, he still looked better than the other three. He won the fights with his sword skills and the help of the chip. Angele's body was not as strong as the baron so the baron could take more hits than him. He had to dodge as many attacks as he could because his body just could not ignore any wounds.\"Yeah, it's over.\" The baron walked over and looked at the three with mixed feelings.\"Heh... Karl... Your victory means nothing.\" Lisa laughed and said. She raised her head and stared at the baron in the eyes.\"The Saladin Empire is coming. They will take everything from you. All these years you spent will be burned into ashes... All...\" She did not finish her words and spat out a lot of blood out of her mouth.\"So what?!\" The baron laughed coldly and kicked Lisa right in the waist again. It was not a light kick, making Lisa roll several meters away. The blood was all over her body.\"Lisa, I will take 'good' care of your son and two daughters.\" The baron stared at her and said.The woman on the ground wanted to say more, but her mouth was filled with blood. Every time she tried to talk, the only thing that came out was her blood. She was dying.\"Father, just finish them off. The Saladin soldiers are coming. We have to head back and deal with them.\" Angele said.The baron was satisfied with how his son handled things.\"You head back first. I will be right back when I am done here.\" The baron said.Angele looked at Chris and Audis. Chris was losing a lot of blood and Audis probably could not fight back anymore. He thought his father was not in danger anymore and now he needed to formulate a plan to deal with the Saladin Empire. Angele thought they needed to go back to the castle as soon as possible and get all the traitors. If this did not happen, they could probably fight the Saladin soldiers back. Now that the baron and Angele were injured and the castle was filled with traitors, the best plan would be leaving the castle with whatever was left.Angele again looked at the three on the ground and nodded his head. He left the place quickly while keeping the pressure on his wound. The other traitors in the castle would not be able to fight him even if he was hurt. A normal warrior could probably never win a fight against a normal knight. Also, since their leaders were all dead, they would probably just surround him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Leaving (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeIf Saladin Empire really sent an army here, Angele would try to grab whatever he could before escaping. Anyways, he needed to check the situation in the castle. Angele chose the route he came from and found a horse on the way. The horse was probably from the criminals he saw earlier and it helped him save some stamina.It still took him a while to get back to the castle, and it was already afternoon. Angele went across the training grounds outside the castle and he saw the door of the entrance was already lowered. There were bodies and blood everywhere and he could still hear people fighting inside.\"The situation isn't so bad.\" Angele got off the horse and said. He was still applying pressure on his wound to prevent it from bleeding. His face was pale, but he had no problem walking. Angele drew his sword and walked inside the castle quickly. Some of the bodies were the guards and some were the post knights. Dark blood stains were everywhere and Angele even saw two post knights trading their lives by stabbing each other in the neck.It looked like not everyone was trying to betray the baron. Angele walked towards the training ground beside the living area, and there were people fighting. Over the main tower, one blonde man and some of his followers were carrying out tons of coins and jewelry. They were yelling and laughing. In the living quarters, several students were trying to guard the entrance while the guards were trying to break in.Angele looked around and rushed to the training grounds with his sword on hand. One of the student heard his footsteps and tried to attack him. Angele dodged the attack easily and slashed the student's neck open. The student fell down to the ground and died. Those post knights were just too weak and very slow. Angele felt like they were moving in slow motion, and he just killed everyone who tried to point their swords at him.People around finally realized who he was.\"It's Angele!\" They yelled. Many people watched him dancing around the traitors and cutting their necks open. The guards and students that were trying to protect the castle started cheering for him. The people in the living quarters were watching the situation through the windows and they saw how strong Angele had become.\"Wo...Woah...\" Celia and Maggie were surprised. The others around were speechless, too. The ones who were looking down on Angele felt ashamed.The battle did not last too long and many traitors started to run for their lives after knowing that Angele was at a knight's level. They threw away the valuables and just tried to escape. They needed some heavy weapon to actually deal with Angele. The blonde man ran away first and without him, the rest all escaped quickly.Some guards went out to chase and were able to kill about ten of them. They returned to the castle while cheering. Angele asked the doctors who were still alive to help the injured ones. The baron had just returned to the castle as well and asked the workers to start packing up all the valuables. He also awarded the ones who defended the castle a huge amount of coins. After dismissing some of them, the baron gathered the main members of the family and about twenty loyal guards.Angele sat down on a chair and took a break. He watched the baron organizing the things in the castle. Maggie and Celia stood with their parents, deciding to leave the castle with the baron. Several other children of the baron decided to leave, too. Everyone else were either killed or have already escaped the castle.Cecilia survived as well. She hid in a large water tank this whole time. Her clothes were soaked with water and she was standing beside Angele. The baron glanced on the group he just gathered and looked at his son for several seconds.\"Tonight, the army from Saladin Empire will be invading my territory. We have to leave this place forever. We might not be able to come back in the future. If anyone of you wants to leave with me, then you only have this one chance. If not, you may leave the castle now.\" The baron solemnly spoke with a deep voice.The survivors started chattering and some of them decided to leave right away. The twenty guards decided to leave with the baron and only about 12 people from the family decided to depart with him. The castle once had hundreds of people living in it, but now, only 32 people decided to stay with the baron. Angele and his father had mixed feelings about it.Maggie's father pushed her on the shoulder and she understood what her father was trying to tell her what to do right away. She saw Angele sitting on a chair with a cold expression on his face. His sword was lying beside the chair and he could grab it quickly if he wanted to. Maggie felt her heart beating very fast as the current Angele did not seem like a playboy at all. He looked like a totally different person.Celia ran towards Angele and gave him a hug. The girl looked like a bird that just got scared and started crying.\"Angele, are you alright?\" Maggie walked towards them quickly and asked. Her face was blushing. Angele looked at the two girls and the people around him. They all lowered their heads and looked at him with a tinge of fear on their faces.\"Maggie and Celia, are you leaving the place with me and my father?\" Angele asked calmly.\"Yes!\" Maggie replied without hesitation. She knew that this would be what her parents wished. Angele had already shown his power and he had huge potential. Maggie's parents saw his performance and were very happy that they asked Maggie to become close with him.\"Me too.\" Celia said in a light tone.The baron was conversing with the guards on the other side, planning their escape route and resources. He recovered fast thanks to his high stamina. Though he lost an eye, it was not a very big deal. The baron felt much better after taking some special medicine. The doctors cleaned his wound on the eye and covered it with cloth.He was yelling at the workers for the preparations and sent some of the guards out as scouts. He wanted to make sure that the Saladin army haven't arrived yet. Angele was just talking to some of his brothers and sisters on the side. Angele also understood his father's plan after listening to his orders.The baron decided to leave the Rudin Empire together with whoever wanted to follow him and go east to the Andes Alliance's dock called Marua. His young sister, Maria Rio, lived there. She got married with a noble there a long time ago, and they had a close relationship with the Rio Territory. They communicated with letters from time to time. The baron wanted to take some good rest there and also wanted to plan for the future. He lost almost everything today and it was impossible for him to stay in the Rudin Empire. Andes Alliance was a better choice for him at present.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: On the Way (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe baron\u2019s plan was based on the fact that the Saladin Empire would invade the castle tonight. The sun had not set yet, but it was getting dark. The sky looked beautiful while the sun going down. Outside the castle, the baron was standing by a large stone in the training ground. He was looking towards the west, and it was where he sent the sentries to. The others already packed up their belongings and there were three large carriages on the road. About twenty people were just standing there and waited.Angele asked the leader of the guards, Mark, about the route to the Andes Alliance. Cecilia was standing beside them, and looking at Angele. She was sold to the family, and there was nowhere for her to go back.\u201cI heard the Andes Alliance is a very different country than the Rudin Empire?\u201d Angele asked.Mark was in his mid-forties, and had some thick beard on his chin. His face looked like yellow wax, and one of his ears was broken. He lost half of that ear to a Saladin Soldier during the early war.\u201cYes, I have been there once, and I was escorting Miss Maria to her new home. It was a great trip.\u201d Mark said.\u201cEmpires such as Rudin and Saladin put all the power in the king\u2019s hand. The Andes Alliance has a king too, but they also have the house of commons. The king could not do whatever he wants. Also, the Marua Harbour is a very nice place to stay. It\u2019s much better than our territory, and it might even be better than the Candia City!\u201d Mark said, and he looked excited.\u201cThe streets there were so f*cking clean. Many races lived together, and you could buy whatever you wanted. There were many stores, and crap ton of ships. The place was\u2026 probably the most beautiful city I had ever been too.\u201d Mark said.\u201cReally?\u201d Angele got curious, and people around were also attracted by Mark\u2019s description.\u201cIf we get on the road right away, it will take us about half a year to get there. It is pretty close actually. We need to travel across the Anser Plain, and we will see the border there. We have the baron and Young Master Angele in our team, and we could easily deal with the robbers on the way.\u201d Mark got very excited and said.\u201cThere are robbers on the way?\u201d Angele scrunched his eyebrows and asked.\u201cYea, not many. The situation is much better now.\u201d One of the guard on the side said.\u201cI am from the Andes Alliance. When I arrived here a long time ago, I encountered several robbers on the way, and they killed half of my team.\u201d He kept saying.\u201cWell, it sounds dangerous.\u201d Angele said with a light tone.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d Someone said, and people looked over to the direction the sound came from. The baron was walking here with a serious face, and a guard was following behind him. The guard looked very tired.\u201cGet ready everyone! Those Saladin skunks already crossed the border, and they will be here in 15 minutes!\u201d The baron yelled.Angele grabbed his long bow and quiver, and checked his sword on his waist. He was ready.The three large carriages started to move on the road. Angele and the baron sat on the first carriage, and they were the only people in that one.\u201cFather, it would take us half a year to get to the Marua Harbour? How far is it from here exactly\u2026?\u201d Angele wondered. Angele could travel through the whole Asia on the earth for half a year. He was really curious about the size of this world.\u201cYea, it took me about six or seven months last time.\u201d The baron scrunched his eye brows, and answered.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we have enough money. We will take two stops on the way, and we could get some supplies there. The worst case we can still hunt in the forest.\u201d He said.\u201cHow was your eye?\u201d Angele nodded and asked.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I can still live with one eye.\u201d The baron said. Angele stopped talking and asked Zero to examine the baron\u2019s body condition.\u2018Karl Rio: Strength about 2.2, agility about 2.4, stamina about 2.1. Condition: Injured, strength and stamina will increase after the burst. The agility lowers.\u2019 Zero reported, and it surprised Angele. The numbers were much lower than the last time. He just could not believe that.\u2018Get me the previous data.\u2019 He thought.\u2018Karl Rio before the injury: Strength 2 to 4, agility 3.4, stamina 3.9.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Why did the numbers decrease?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Permanent organ damages.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Any chance of recovery?\u2019 He asked.\u2018Had a recovery chance of 11%. Many highly processed medicines are necessary.\u2019 Zero reported, and listed a whole bunch of medicine names. There was no way for Angele to find those, and he probably could not help the baron right now. He took a deep breath, and sighed.**************************5 days had past since they started to trip. There were only trees around the team, and they were still on the way. Angele and the baron had the first carriage, and the other two were full of supplies besides carrying people. Mainly food and water. Some of the girls had to walk for a while to let the horses rest.Angele just sat on the carriage and he was recovering. He was badly hurt during the fight, and he needed good rest. The chip made him a recovering plan, and that helped him a lot. He could do some general activities on the fifth day.Angele woke up from the dream, and sat in the carriage. His body was shaking as the road was a bit bumpy. He could hear the hooves stomping on the ground. The sunlight made the carriage very warm inside, and Angele grabbed some water to drink. The drink got warm too, and he opened the door to get some fresh air. He decided to sit by the coachman.The sun light was really burning, and Angele just kept drinking water. The coachman was very slim and thin. His name was Ant, and he was one of the baron\u2019s relatives. He looked weak in the grey suit. Ant smiled when he saw Angele sat by his side.\u201cYoung Master Angele, you woke up.\u201d Ant greeted.\u201cWhere are we now?\u201d Angele yarned and asked.\u201cTwo more days and we will be out of the forest. The baron said there is a river ahead, and we could get some water there.\u201d Ant answered politely.Angele nodded his head, and started to look at the trees on the side. The carriage sometimes bumped due to the stones on the road. The wind was hot, and it was blowing all over his brown short hair. Angele still felt very hot, and he knew the baron was probably having some \u2018fun\u2019 with one of his wives in the back there. He was a bit speechless when he thought about it.\u2018Zero, how was my body condition.\u2019 He asked.\u201920 secs of activity will blow up your wound. Estimated recovering time: 15 days.\u201d Zero reported honestly.\u201cThat\u2019s going to take a while\u2026\u201d Angele said, and suddenly he smelled something.\u201cThe smell of blood!\u201d Angele sensed the smell from the warm wind, and yelled.\u201cAnt, stop the carriages!\u201d He ordered.Ant nodded right after he heard Angele\u2019s words, and grabbed the long stick on the side. The stick had a whiter cloth on top of it, and Ant waved the stick several times. It was the signal to stop the carriages. The three carriages slowly stopped, and the people got a bit nervous about the situation.\u201cRock, Berries, you two go take a look on the side, and the rest get ready!\u201d Mark smelled the blood too, and ordered. Angele grabbed his gear and jumped off the carriage. Angele was checking his gear, and he saw the baron got off one of the carriages in the back. He was still putting on his clothes.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The baron asked with a light tone.\u201cSomething happened in the front, I smelled the blood.\u201d Angele said.The way was forked in the front, and there were some blood stains on the left side. The blood was on the grass, and it made a trail to the side bush. It was the route they were going to choose.People got noisy, and were trying to figure out what was going wrong. Angele and the baron got serious when they saw a broken wooden shield beside the blood stain. There was an owl and axe sigil on the shield, and it was enhanced with black iron. Apparently the shield did not help its master, it was broken, and it was covered by blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: On the Way (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cThat is a thick wooden shield forged with black iron. I can\u2019t even break through it even if I am uninjured\u2026\u201d the baron said in a serious tone.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Angele got nervous. Though he was a top level knight, he could not break a shield like that; at this moment, he could even imagine a sinister scene coming into fruition.\u201cOwl and axe; it is the insignia of Viscount Candia,\u201d the baron said.\u201cNo one here could break a shield like that, so it is probably someone from the Saladin Empire. Angele, come with me,\u201d the baron said with a deep voice.Angele nodded his head. Only he and the baron were the knights in their caravan. Even though Angele was merely 14 years old, in such situations, age became a meaningless constituent. They commanded the guards to maintain a circumspect behavior and walked towards the wooden shield carefully.They saw a corpse equipped with black armor lying there; the engraved insignia on the armor was visible to them.\u201cIt\u2019s Ruhr\u2026\u201d the baron said. Ruhr was the strongest knight under Viscount Candia. The man\u2019s corpse was then turned over by the baron using his feet. Countless flies plagued around him, and a rotten stench leaked out of his corpse; the corpse had already become pallid from its post mortem state. His head had been split open with a wound the size of a finger\u2019s width.Angele felt a bit nauseated as he looked at the corpse. The man had a huge physique; he was slightly fatter but shorter than Knight Audis. His head injury was so deep that Angele could even see small chunks of brain matter coming out of it. The grass around the corpse was dyed red, and several roving insects were all around it.\u201cHe was not assassinated,\u201d The baron said as he inspected the corpse; he seemed to be unaffected by the repugnant stench.\u201cIt took the opponent about two hits to finish Ruhr off. Only a grand knight could do something like that,\u201d the baron said after checking for a while.\u201cGrand knight?\u201d Angele never heard of that before.\u201cWhat kind of knight is a grand knight, father?\u201d he asked.\u201cA grand knight can kill me without incurring injuries,\u201d the baron said.\u201cThe last time I saw one was during the Orchid War. Saladin Empire is being serious this time. They even sent out a Grand Knight to lead the attack\u2026\u201d the baron said in a worried tone.\u201cWhat should we\u2014\u201d Angele\u2019s words were cut off by the baron. The baron examined the trail of blood and traced it into a corner. After about 5 minutes, he asked Angele to slow down while he hid into a bush on the side. Angele, too, realized that something was amiss at their front.It sounded as if people were in a battle within the close proximity of the two. Angele left the bush together with the baron as they trod uphill. They lowered their bodies and peered down, gazing at an empty ground beneath the hill.There was a fight taking place in that area. A long-haired man in a brown leather suit was surrounded by a small army in the middle of the ground. About 10 swordsmen were also with him, but all of them were wounded. They all had green-striped cloth tied around their arms. On the other hand, the soldiers surrounding them all wore black iron armors and they numbered about several hundreds. Two knights in white armor stood at the forefront, looking at the long-haired man. Many had been killed already, such that their lifeless bodies were strewn all over the ground. It seemed that the battle was already way past its crescendo.\u201cIt\u2019s the black army of Rudin while the ones in the middle are from Saladin.\u201d the baron explained in a low voice.\u201cJust surrender already, Martin Francis. You don\u2019t want to lose your life here as a Grand Knight. That would be a pity.\u201d One of the knights in white armor said calmly as though he was very confident.\u201cYou think that\u2019s possible?\u201d the long-haired man laughed. He had a strange accent and a voice that sounded like he was singing.\u201cI am just the leader of the Third Vanguards from the Saladin Empire. There are more to come. You guys are done, Jones. How about joining us? Master Andre will treat you well.\u201d the long-haired man laughed and said.For some reason, the knight named Jones did not order his men to attack and only kept trading words with the man named Martin. Angele and the baron listened to their conversation for a while, and then decided to first go back.\u201cThey have many archers there, and the grand knight won\u2019t be able to deal with them.\u201d the baron said.\u201cArchers? You mean the ones outside the circle?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYea, I was a leader in the sentry squad during the war. I once saw a grand knight being slain by a group of archers; it only took several seconds for him to go down. A whole group of archers is a powerful force. Well, let\u2019s go back and choose a different route since we don\u2019t have much time to spare. Though the black army is from our country, they might still attack us.\u201d the baron said.Angele nodded, but did not say anything.\u201cThe Saladin Empire is serious this time. The Rudin Empire and Saladin Empire have thousands of miles gap between their border lines. They need more than three grand knights to be the vanguards and countless knights to follow up. If the Forest Knights are here, the Rudin Empire won\u2019t be able to do much\u2026\u201d the baron kept saying; he looked despondent and at the same time, uneasy.Angele could understand why the baron was worried. Knights were rare in small noble territories, but there were countless knights in the whole country. Knights were mere elites of an army and there could be thousands of them. The Rudin Empire never recovered from the previous wars, so it would not be able to handle the Saladin invasion this time.Suddenly, they heard the sound of archers firing arrows in the back and the battle cry of the grand knight. Angele asked the chip to analyze the grand knight\u2019s ability right away.[Rough analysis of the grand knight: Strength is around 7 to 9, Agility is 6 to 7, Stamina is 5 to 8. Attributes might increase greatly during the potential burst.] Zero reported. The data was based on the ongoing fight.[How is that even possible\u2026] Though Angele knew the numbers were going to be high, he did not expect such higher numbers. He bit on his lips as he became worried. The man was probably much stronger than the Crazy Mountain Bear because he was a trained warrior, and he had battle skills the bear did not have.[Zero, show me my numbers.] he asked.[Angele Rio, injured. Strength is around 2.1 to 2.6, Agility is 2.7, and Stamina is 1.8, it should be 2 normally.] Zero reported.Angele was again in shock. He was proud that he could kill a knight and also of the fact that he didn\u2019t have the feeling of helplessness from before. However, based on the differences of the attributes between him and the grand knight, he would be killed easily just by their pure strength and speed. He would not have a better ending than Ruhr if he were to engage him in a battle.\u201cI am still so weak\u2026 The grand knight was a leader of a whole troop and he was not the only one.\u201d Angele said. He felt that the situation was really bad.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Angele. Your body has certain limits due to various reasons, but if you focus on improving sword skills and archery skills, you can still be very strong. However, the grand knights are definitely out of our concern, especially when they all have very strong backgrounds supporting them.\u201d The baron saw Angele\u2019s expression, and said. He did not know how Angele increased his attributes in such a short period. Though he tried to give Angele the Life Energy Seed, his son did not have the potential to accept it. The baron was still trying to cheer Angele up anyways.Without the seed, people could never become a grand knight. Human beings had limits to their body developments and their attributes would eventually reach the limitations. They needed the seed to break past the limitation and condense battle aura around them. Angele read about it in the special library.\u201cAll hail the Saladin!\u201d the voice was extremely loud.Angele and the baron were shocked by the voice and so turned back to the battlefield. They knew it was the last words of the grand knight. Saladin Empire just lost one of their greatest warriors.\u201cIf I was not injured this time, I can probably become a grand knight in ten years. But\u2026\u201d the baron said. He sounded a bit forlorn. However, his injury was severe to the point that he could never recover to his original state.\u201cMy hopes are on you now, son\u2026\u201d The baron stared at his son. Angele knew his father was looking at him, but he did not stop his footsteps. He walked towards the front quickly.[Zero, how much agility will I gain from the emerald\u2019s energy?] Angele asked.[About 2.1, and 0.3 stamina. It will take 11 days. The remaining energy is about 1/12.] Zero answered.[Remaining energy? What do you mean?] Angele was surprised.[Body development is reaching the limit. The limit is set by your gene. Only the special energy will remain.] Zero reported.[You mean I can never become a grand knight?] Angele asked.[94.53% probability that you will not become a grand knight.] Zero reported.Angele suddenly gripped his sword tightly and stopped walking. He started to stare at the sky, but his sight was blocked by the tree leaves and sunlight. The sunlight was hot and dense, which Angele could feel with his hands. However, he felt a bit bleak from hopelessness.\u201cWhat happened? Angele?\u201d the baron asked from behind.\u201cNothing. It\u2019s nothing. Let\u2019s get back and start move again, father.\u201d Angele answered.\u201cYea.\u201d the baron said.Angele suddenly thought of the ring, the mysterious ring that had special engravings on it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Coincidence (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeIt had been four days since the baron\u2019s caravan avoided the battleground and had chosen another route. Trees were becoming sparse as they continued to advance, which meant that they were nearing the outskirts of the forest.Night slowly descended. The baron was driving one of their own carriages with Angele seated beside him. He steered the horse with its reins, occasionally glancing at his leather-made map as he navigated through their preordained route. Twilight was falling, and blanket of darkness and shadows gradually covered the forest bit by bit. Angele raised his head and looked at the sky. The clouds could still be seen with the naked eye. It hid the sun behind, which caused these clouds to be dyed red by the color of dusk.The wind was blowing across Angele\u2019s face, carrying with it was the fragrance of flowers that wafted into his nostrils. The heat from the day could no longer be felt much, but it was still there. Some random insects began to produce noises, signaling the overture of their concert at night \u2014 a scene that reminded him of Earth. Angele laid on his back at the edge of the carriage, lethargy slowly creeping toward him.\u201cFather, are we out of the forest now?\u201d he asked.\u201cAlmost, we will enter the Anser Plain by tomorrow at noontime. We are around Vlasov Woodland now,\u201d the baron answered Angele\u2019s question. While he did so, he kept track of their current location on the map.\u201cVlasov Woodland? What is this place?\u201d Angele became curious.\u201cAfter we turn left here and advance for about five kilometers, we\u2019ll start seeing a bunch of maple trees. There is an abandoned manor there, formerly owned by a noble from Vlasov. It had been burnt down during the war. There are rumors saying that only ghosts lived there now. I\u2019ve never entered it when I passed by several times during my travels before,\u201d the baron said in a fearful tone.\u201cThere is something amiss with the manor. I don\u2019t know, but I just think it\u2019s dangerous to enter,\u201d he said. Angele felt that he had read about it on a book once somewhere, but he just couldn\u2019t recall which book it was.\u201cWait, how could\u2019ve those Saladin armies traveled so fast? We didn\u2019t even see them overtake us,\u201d Angele asked.\u201cThey are after the major territories. Some of them had gone too deep and gotten themselves killed instead just like the grand knight we just met.\u201d the baron explained as he kept the map back into his pouch. A well-drawn map was like a precious treasure in this era.\u201cVlasov Empire was once a tyrannical power. Now, it has been turned into ashes. Nothing can contend with the passage of time, not even such a powerful empire\u2026\u201d The baron emotionally sighed.Angele stopped talking. They continue to sit side by side. The only ones making noises were the horses. It was becoming dark, and the air was becoming chilly. Many miniscule shiny objects flew around the carriages, each of it about the size of a nail. This painted a scene as though they were traveling with a blue halo around them.Angele\u2019s eyes became wide open as he looked at this mesmerizing scene.\u201cWhat is this?\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but grab one of these objects. The blue object was the size of a piece of nail that fell down on his palm. As he looked closely, it seemed like a seed of a dandelion. It was tiny, and had a shiny blue color on it. The seed would\u2019ve looked just like any other plants\u2019 seed if it wasn\u2019t shiny. Angele could only barely feel it even when this blue seed laid on his palm. Its blue light reflected on his face, which made him look slightly blue as well.\u201cIt\u2019s a Green Ear Masa. In the Volasov language, it means \u2018the umbrella of the sea\u2019. The Volasov people consider themselves as the sons of the sea that they even think that this plant is sent by the mother sea to protect them on land. It has been a while since I last saw the \u2018Rain of the Masa\u2019.\u201d It seemed as though the Masa reminded the baron of something.\u201cThe road is now barely visible from the darkness. Let\u2019s set up camp here.\u201d Baron Karl shook his head as he spoke.\u201cAlright.\u201d Angele said. The carriages slowed down as it afterward stopped, and were then parked beside the camp area. They found a suitable empty ground to camp, and some guards decided to survey the area. Several people picked up branches to be used for the campfire while some dragged the carriages to form a triangle formation around the campsite. It was a good formation for defence in case something happened.It took about ten minutes for them to set up everything. One campfire was lit up in the middle while three were lit up around the outer perimeter. The guards were assigned to take turns for the nightwatch. Meanwhile, the women and the workers settled in the middle area. They began to take out the cooking equipments and food to be prepared for dinner. The camp became lively quickly.The baron went inside on of the carriages and had his wound on the eye checked by a doctor. The latter also reapplied some medicine on the wound for the baron. For the time being, Angele grabbed a blanket, placed it over a stone and sat on it. His longbow and quiver were carried on his back, his unsheathed sword by his waist, and the silver daggers in his pouch. Also, he tied the chain claws on the back of his waist. Angele wore his leather hunting suit since it was more suitable in such an environment. The suit was lightweight and it had moderate defensive power. Wearing a heavy armor in a forest would only make him an easy, slow moving target.Angele sat on the stone and looked over the sky.\u201cHow beautiful\u2026\u201d he said while feeling relaxed. He looked over the gap of the carriages and saw Maggie organizing their things together with Celia and some other girls. Mark was checking the situation of the area with the guards. Several guards were adding branches into the fire, and they lit several torches after. They did so to increase and ensure the safety of the people in their caravan.No one checked on Angele because people knew that he loved to sit by the side alone. He had asked the people not to disturb him, so they followed his request. Angele took out a necklace that had chained the emerald ring. He held the ring in his hand, and started walking around the camp. He kept glancing over the bushes at the side.After walking for awhile, he suddenly lowered his body by a small bush. There were several small, round red fruits borne on it. This plant had long, hard leaves, and he could even see small insects moving on it. There were also several shiny Masa seeds that dropped on the bush. Angele took one of these red fruits and threw it into his mouth. It tasted quite sour and at the same time, bitter.\u2018Angele, this wild fruit contains moderate poison. Data obtained from the Wild Plant Record. No enhancement effect detected,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele became disgruntled as he heard this and spat out the remaining. \u2018It\u2019s a no-go. I really want to find something useful,\u2019 Angele thought as he stood up. He walked around for awhile, yet he found nothing special. The chip did not find anything useful to him. Angele still desired to reach the apex as fast as he could even after knowing that his body had a certain limit. He wanted to become stronger, and the easiest way to gain strength was, still, eating food. He didn\u2019t need to actually eat them, though. He only had to put the item he wanted to analyze into his mouth to get the result. Otherwise, he would\u2019ve already consumed many poisonous plants.Angele was still curious about this world, so he was quite interested in everything. He had always felt refreshed whenever he encountered something new to him.Nothing much occurred that night, and in the next morning, their caravan vacated the place. Angele felt as though they were about to leave the forest because the trees around them weren\u2019t as many as before. The baron was sitting in the first carriage, and he opened the window to check.\u201cWe are almost out of the forest. The Anser Plain is just ahead,\u201d he said.\u201cIt means there might be some bandits around the intersection, right?\u201d Angele asked while he wiped his sword with an oiled cloth.\u201cYea, that\u2019s why we must stay alert,\u201d the baron said.Angele nodded and put his sword back into the sheath. His agility had reached the limit with the help of the mysterious energy.\u2018What\u2019s my body condition.\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Angele Rio: Strength is around 2.1 to 2.6. Agility is 4.1. Stamina is 2.2.\u2019 Zero reported. Angele felt slightly despondent, but at least his agility now could be considered eminently high by him. He should be stronger than the him of the past ten days, nearly reaching the level of an uninjured Baron Karl. He had far better sword skills, so he might even be stronger than the baron himself in certain situations.However, he knew that he was still considered pretty weak in this world. The grand knight from before was much stronger than him, but even then, he couldn\u2019t survive a barrage of arrows from a whole troop of archers. He thought of the emerald ring again and the mysterious power that might\u2019ve come from the wizards of the ancient times. Angele still had qualms about the source of this power, but he knew the ring was enchanted.He suddenly heard sounds of people fighting up ahead, and he stopped thinking right away.\u201cSomething is going on there!\u201d The baron asked the coachman to slow down. The carriages slowed down, trying to lessen the noise.\u201cFather, I am going to take a look.\u201d Angele jumped out of the carriage and said. The baron nodded his head as he knew that Angele was good enough for such a task. Angele quickly rushed forward, leaving the forest right away. He hid himself in a bushed and surveyed up ahead.A caravan of five carriages was surrounded by bandits who each wore grey scarves on their heads. The guards of the caravan were fighting against them. Three knights mounted on horses were fighting against five bandits who seemed to be the leaders in the encirclement of carriages. Angele sharply sensed from the battle in that area that the people there were far stronger than the others outside of the encirclement.\u2018Get me their data.\u2019 Angele ordered.Zero put up the blue data in front of his eyes right away, and Angele looked over to one of the knights.\u2018Target unknown: Strength greater than 4. Agility greater than 2. Stamina greater than 3.\u2019 The data read.\u2018A knight with such strength is actually in trouble? \u2026 Just how strong are those bandits?\u2019 Angele was surprised. The baron once told him that people with knight-level strength existed amongst bandits, so lords would definitely hire any knight-level warrior. The knights would live much better lives than being bandits.On their way to Marua Harbor, bandits were usually in groups of ten, and the strongest ones were probably close to post knights. But the ones ahead of Angele looked quite different. Angele looked at one of the bandit leaders. He saw the blue data popping out on the side.\u2018Target unknown: Strength greater than 4. Agility greater than 4. Stamina greater than 3. Burst potential is close to Karl Rio\u2019s, about 72% similarity detected.\u2019 Zero reported.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: Coincidence (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele had difficulty in ascertaining the current situation, so he checked the other leaders\u2019 statuses. The weakest of the five bandit leaders was a mid-level knight while the rest were all top-level knights. There were also another ten knight level bandits who fought with the caravan guards. Meanwhile, the caravan only had two top-level knights and a single normal knight, which undoubtedly showed the dire straits they were in.Angele had also noticed that those bandits didn\u2019t seem like the typical bandits he knew of. They carried out orders in a precise manner and fought differently compared to typical bandits \u2014 much like how armies fought in skirmishes. It seemed as though they were authentic soldiers who were disguised as bandits. Thus, Angele was able to deduce their identities as well as their motives for doing so. It might be that they lacked supplies, which was why they were raiding supplies from travelers and caravans. With that, Angele gained a highly probable idea of the situation from his deductions. He then withdrew and returned back to their caravan. It didn\u2019t take him a long time to inform the baron of the situation. The baron became surprised after hearing the current situation. Subsequently, he made a decision to change routes again so as to avoid getting in conflict with those \u201cbandits\u201d.\u201cIt must be the Ukusas Empire Border Army!\u201d the baron said.\u201cThey must\u2019ve heard of the invasion plans of Saladin Empire, thus they decided to raid several fleeing Rudin nobles. That caravan must\u2019ve originally been from a major city since they even have three top-level knights. Yet, they are still having trouble escaping.\u201d he continued. Angele was concurrently feeling nervous, even having his senses keener as he tried to catch every sound he could hear. He wanted to guarantee that those bandits did not notice their existence.Angele also did not forget to get intel on some of the weaker bandits while he was scouting from within the bush. It seemed as though that not only were they raiding, but they were also training at the same time. An average knight could handle around five post knights. If those bandits found out the location of Angele\u2019s caravan, they could easily wipe the caravan with the bandit leaders\u2019 assistance.Angele finally realized that in a countryside territory like Rio Territory, knight-level warriors could already be considered rare. However, larger families in major cities could easily train hundreds of post knights and half of them could even become real knights. This showed the stark contrast between them.***********************The bandit leaders were overseeing the fight while conversing with one another.\u201cMaster Ceylon, a young guy in the bush observed us for a while. He could be a scout of the enemy!\u201d One of the bandits with a grey scarf on their heads came in and reported.\u201cA young guy? Those Rudin bastards really don\u2019t learn. Ha, Caster, you want to take a look? Otherwise, I am going.\u201d The man named Ceylon turned to another man and said.\u201cYou go. Just make it quick since we don\u2019t have much time left. We still need to meet up with the leader, and we definitely can\u2019t those royal members from Rudin escape. We\u2019re going to be in deep trouble if we fail our actual mission,\u201d the man called Caster, who had a gentle disposition, calmly said.\u201cSure! I will finish him in 20 minutes. It\u2019s just the countryside, so how strong can a young man from the countryside be? Hahaha.\u201d Ceylon wiped his bald head with a piece of blanket and grabbed his greatsword.\u201cI need five men. Anker, Hasis, come with me!\u201d he yelled.\u201cAffirmative! Master Ceylon!\u201d Two knights wearing black-greenish leather suit stepped out. Both of them held a broadsword in their hands.\u201cI\u2019ll accompany you. Things are finished here.\u201d Another leader stepped out.\u201cOrisis, why do you always seem to get in my way?\u201d Ceylon said as he looked at the man named Orisis. The latter smiled without responding. Orisis carried a metal longbow on his back and his quiver hung on his horse\u2019s saddle.\u201cHow can that be, Master Ceylon? You do know that I admire your strength and skills.\u201d Orisis said while still smiling.\u201cWhatever! Let\u2019s go!\u201d Ceylon cut off the conversation then waved his hand. The two knights followed him from behind, at the same time bringing about ten horse riders. Ceylon\u2019s company started traveling toward the eastern direction relative to them swiftly.\u201cMaster Ceylon, we have two top-level knights here. Why are you so nervous? No one can escape my arrow, you know?\u201d Orisis said, his tone light and his voice slightly feminine. It was a voice that could make people uncomfortable.Ceylon didn\u2019t respond. Instead, he continued to increase his speed.**********************In the forest.Three carriages were moving slowly between the trees. The gaps between the trees were wide enough for them to get through. The atmosphere in the caravan was quite tense since not even a single person was talking \u2014 only the sounds made by horses resounded throughout. This signified just how nervous they were with the current circumstance. The guards around the carriages carefully scrutinized the surroundings constantly, apparently showing their increased vigilance.A fully-equipped teenager with short brown hair was sitting on the coachman\u2019s seat. A wooden longbow was being held in his hand. A silver crossguard sword hung by his waist as well as a quiver of arrows that was being carried upon his back. He wore a leather suit as his armor and also had a pouch with him. There was something inside the pouch, but no one knew of its contents. This teenager was also keeping track of the surroundings in a careful manner.Their traveling pace wasn\u2019t too slow nor was it too fast. Yet, the highest possible speed had already been reached to its limits. A man jumped into the carriage and sat beside the teenager. The man who had a long brown hair had his hair draped all over his shoulders. This man was the baron, Karl Rio, who still had his right eye covered with a bandage.\u201cAngele, ten more minutes then we\u2019ll make a turn and enter the Anser Plain. Our current location is nearly at the border of the drawn map. Beyond that, we have no way to navigate the path, so we cannot afford to lose the right direction,\u201d the baron said with a deep voice.\u201cSure, Father,\u201d Angele said as he nodded in affirmation. He looked the inside of the carriage and saw the girls who seemed quite nervous. The guards around the caravan already had themselves prepared for battle.*******************At the intersection between the plain and the forest.With the sound of hooves stomping on the ground, a company of mounted bandits arrived at the location that Angele\u2019s caravan had recently passed through.\u201cSomeone was just here. There are traces of passing carriages on the ground. You guys, go search for them!\u201d Ceylon yelled after he took a glance at the ground.\u201cNo need. I can track their general direction,\u201d Orisis yelled. He got off his horse and started to carefully observe the leftover traces.\u201cThey\u2019ve most probably already found us and tried to change routes. Let\u2019s go after them!\u201d He said as he pointed at the direction the baron had chosen.\u201cHuh! Nice tracking skills, let\u2019s go!\u201d Ceylon had to admit that Orisis was a skilled tracker, even though he was still quite unhappy with him.Suddenly, they heard the intense noises of fleeing carriages moving at high speed.\u201cA big group! About ten carriages! We could obtain a lot from them!\u201d Orisis, Ceylon, and everyone else accompanying the two looked excited.\u201cHasis, Anker, you two go take out the small fry! The rest, just follow me!\u201d He raised his greatsword and advanced onward.\u201cI am in this, too!\u201d Orisis said as he followed suit. Hasis, Anker, and the other four bandits became speechless after being left behind by the two.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go for the small fry. I hope we don\u2019t bump into someone strong.\u201d Hasis said after shaking his head.\u201cWhat are you afraid of? We have the best weapons in our arsenal you know.\u201d Anker laughed and subsequently took out a brown crossbow.The rest of the mounted bandits retrieved their own crossbows from the bag of their own horse\u2019s saddles.\u201cNo one will know it\u2019s us if we clean up the scene properly,\u201d Anker said.\u201cSounds like a plan. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Hasis nodded his head and said.They started their pursuit toward the origin of the sounds.*******************\u2018Enemy detected. Six mounted bandits are getting close.\u2019 Zero reported. Angele had already noticed them actually.\u2018In the end, we were still tracked.\u2019 Angele thought as he jumped off the carriage.\u201cKeep going! Don\u2019t stop!\u201d he yelled. The guards were becoming more and more high strung, and yet, no one made any sound. They were, after all, well-trained and would faithfully carry out orders.\u201cWhat happened, Angele?\u201d The baron saw Angele jumping off the carriage, so he asked.\u201cFather, some people are pursuing us, so I am going to stall them to gain ourselves more time. You guys, just keep advancing.\u201d Angele calmly said.\u201cNo, you go with them. Let me be the one to stall them!\u201d The baron jumped off the carriage and walked toward Angele.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I\u2019m just going to shoot arrows at them. I\u2019ll catch up shortly after,\u201d Angele said while smiling.\u201cFather, just keep an eye on the caravan. It will be easier for me to escape if I am alone. Besides, I won\u2019t directly engage with them,\u201d Angele said. The baron looked at Angele. He knew the latter had great skills in archery and thought the latter would be fine if he found a good vantage position to shoot from.\u201cI\u2019ll stay with you,\u201d the baron said in a deep tone.\u201cOur whole family is in the carriages, Father. It will be better if you stay with them. I will catch up shortly, so don\u2019t worry,\u201d Angele said.The baron looked at his son for a while. At a short distance, the sound of their fleeing carriages was gradually becoming further.\u201cI\u2019ll give you 15 minutes. If I don\u2019t see you back after that time, I\u2019ll come and find you,\u201d the baron said.\u201cSure!\u201d Angele nodded.The baron knew that his son was competent enough to handle himself. However, the location of the enemies was unknown at present, so he still felt worried.Angele made sure that his father left with the carriages before turning back. At this time, he could already see the mounted bandits emerging from the forest. He nocked an arrow on his longbow and pulled the bowstring as he drew it until the phantom of a full moon came forth from the fully drawn bow. Sunlight shone upon the arrowhead, which caused an azure hue to be reflected on its surface.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Mystery (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeCHI!Angele shot the arrow drawn by him with his longbow. The target who was one of the mounted bandits cursed in surprise as he fell off the horse after being struck by Angele\u2019s arrow, which the latter heard through the chip. He stayed calm as he grabbed another arrow from his quiver, nocking it once again on his longbow. He was about 200 to 300 meters away from the mounted bandits, but with his chip\u2019s assistance, his accuracy and precision had reached 100%. That was an advantage he had over his opponents.Angele focused on his targets while he pulled the bowstring to a full moon. He kept switching positions accordingly using the information provided by the chip. Suddenly, Angele felt a pain coming from his left arm, and he lost his balance along with his bow. The white-feathered arrow he had nocked on his longbow was dropped on the ground. A black crossbow bolt pierced his left arm, such that it nearly went through it.\u2018It\u2019s a crossbow!\u2019 Angele became surprised at this realization, and without hesitation, he rolled away.CHI!CHI!CHI!Three crossbow bolts sank onto the land Angele had formerly been, leaving only half of the shafts visible.\u2018How\u2026 Crossbows are actually impressive in this world!\u2019 Angele thought. He ran and hid behind a tree while applying pressure to his wound.\u2018The person who shot from such a distance must be strong and might even be a knight.\u2019 Angele tried to withstand the pain and grabbed the chain claw from his back. He cut the bolt head and the fletchings along with a part of the shaft, leaving the remaining part of the bolt in his arm.\u2018Zero, any good plan?\u2019 Angele thought as he cut the bolt to prevent his wound from continuously bleeding.\u2018Thank god they didn\u2019t poison their arrows. I\u2019d already be dead if they had done so.\u2019 Angele felt lucky. It would seem that people in this world frowned at the notion of using poison, or he just hadn\u2019t encountered one. The chip analyzed his wound right away and sent the data to his mind.\u2018The head of the bolt has the shape of a rhombus, thus making you bleed constantly. You are losing blood at a rate of 1% per minute. Please finish the fight within 10 minutes.\u2019 Zero provided the most optimal plan.\u2018Damn! They have rhombus bolts!\u2019 Angele thought as he checked the battle record from the chip. He saw the warning of the incoming crossbow bolt, but because it was way too fast, it got overwritten by the data regarding the inflicted wound.\u2018The chip won\u2019t be helpful if it\u2019s an attack that has absurd speed.\u2019 Angele grabbed another arrow from his quiver after he thought of this matter. He was in great pain. Nevertheless, he still fully drew the longbow. His face was covered in beads of sweat from feeling the pain coming from his left arm at a constant rate. With a difficulty like this, he needed to double his focus in maintaining his accuracy.The sound of hooves stomping on the ground became louder as the mounted bandits pursued him closely. He suddenly jumped out of the cover toward his left and shot the arrow when he was still in the air. It struck only empty space, then pinned itself onto the tree beside a mounted bandit. The wound on his arm and this situation he had never encountered before lowered his accuracy. He had also never practiced such maneuver, thus it only made the horse scared. Two horses at the forefront stopped and raised their hooves, neighing as they tried to flee, yet their riders held the reins tightly to stop them.\u201cHe can\u2019t run from us! Anker, let\u2019s go!\u201d One of the mounted bandits yelled.\u201cGot it!\u201d Two other mounted bandits increased their speed, rushing toward Angele. Each drew their respective broadsword on the way. As Angele heard the sound of swords being unsheathed, he threw his longbow right away and grabbed the chain claw.Angele listened intently to the sound of the hooves drawing closer to his position. He momentarily shut his eyes and pinned one side of the chain to the tree he was hiding in. When the sound reached Angele\u2019s position, he threw the chain towards that direction quickly. The black chain claw flew to the thick branches and twined around it, thus making a simple trap to trip the horses.The two horses, being unable to slow down in the slightest, rushed toward the trap.BANG!The branches broke into pieces and the horses crashed down with the chain on their feet. The horses neighed in pain resulting from their front legs being broken from the impact.\u201cCrap!\u201d One of the mounted bandits fell off the horse and smashed his head against a stone on the ground. Angele became ecstatic in the effectiveness of the trap. He dropped the chain and unsheathed his sword, slashing the mounted bandit who rolled toward him after he stepped forward.DANG!The mounted bandit blocked Angele\u2019s sword and attempted to kick the latter in retaliation. Angele stepped back but felt a chill from behind before he could attack again. He leaned to the side, successfully dodging a slash.\u201cLittle f*cking bitch!\u201d The mounted bandit behind cursed loudly, his accent resembling to that of a resident of Saladin. Angele could easily understand him because the language of Saladin resembled that of Rudin\u2019s. The dialects might be different, but it wasn\u2019t hard to understand. The mounted bandit who nearly got pummeled by Angele took this chance to stand up and waved his sword toward Angele right away, perfectly complementing the other mounted bandit\u2019s attack. Angele couldn\u2019t retaliate and even had to retreat.These two mounted bandits flawlessly kept on attacking Angele in perfect coordination, such that they began to increase their pace. Although Angele blocked nearly every attack, he started having trouble in handling the strength of his opponents.\u2018These two have impressive coordination with each other, and they are definitely close to a top-level knight. Even Audis will have trouble facing them.\u2019 Angele seemed calm on the outside, but he was actually getting overwrought.PONG!Angele was blown away by the impact of a kick that he had failed to dodge. Since he himself knew he couldn\u2019t stop moving, he rolled toward the side. His high agility helped him dodge four crossbow bolts when he rolled, but his wound had gotten worse in return, which left a trail of blood on the ground. Angele hid in a bush and ran behind another tree to take a breather. He started to breathe heavily and beads of sweat even dripped down his chin.\u2018What should I do in such situation\u2026?!\u2019 Angele was really nervous. He even thought it was already the end of the line for him.Two knights that were close to top-level and superb coordination skills. About four crossbows aimed from the side. With these factors, he couldn\u2019t take chances in fleeing with his speed. Also, he wouldn\u2019t be able to win against the two knights head-on. Angele racked his brain for ideas, but he couldn\u2019t come up with a plan. He was starting to become frustrated at his helpless situation, especially when his current circumstance was much worse than his encounter with Dice. Dice\u2019s knives were much slower than the crossbows that greatly hindered him from reading the information gathered by the chip. The first bolt had already taught him of the lesson.\u2018Zero, give me a plan.\u2019 Angele ordered.\u2018Stamina dropping quickly. Please take out the ranged enemies and escape right away.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018I wouldn\u2019t ask this question if I could deal with these goddamn crossbows!\u2019 Angele got angry.\u2018The left part of your head will be hit after one second,\u2019 the chip warned. Angele lowered his head and counterattacked with his sword. He blocked the attack successfully, but the opponent blocked his slash easily. The two mounted bandits performed pincer movements with perfect coordination. Angele was forced to remain encircled by their attacks and the sword skills he was proud of couldn\u2019t do anything. Those two mounted bandits also had some well-practiced sword skills, leaving little or no unnecessary actions in their movements. Angele couldn\u2019t find the chance to retaliate since after one of the two mounted bandits missed an attack, the other would fill the gap right away.The two continued striking Angele, such that the three had already exchanged no small number of blows within a short span of time. Actually, Angele was being forced out of his cover due to the pressure they were exerting on him.\u2018The crossbows will easily get me from any angle once I\u2019m out of the bush. They don\u2019t even need to get close.\u2019 Angele grasped the situation correctly, but the two weren\u2019t letting him move freely. Angele was being forced backward due to the impacts of the blows that the two mounted bandits showed especially since it was because they had a similar strength level as him.Angele would\u2019ve already been long dead if he didn\u2019t have the special sword skill set constructed by the chip. There was barely any unnecessary movement in the set, which made him gain the ability to block the attacks perfectly. However, Angele\u2019s wounds were inevitably opening because of his actions. The kick also injured his left arm and he was losing blood and stamina at a fast rate. His blocking capability was becoming weak and his eyesight was getting blurry. Sweat even dripped down into his eyes.\u201cYou are very strong as a teenager. Are you some child of big noble family?\u201d One of the bandits laughed and said.\u201cOnly those kids have the chance to learn grand knight level sword skills and your attributes are quite high for your age. It must be nice to be a kid in a big family.\u201d He continued.\u201cIf Master Ceylon was here, this kid would\u2019ve died already.\u201d The other bandit said, not even slowing one bit. Their swords seemed like two silver flashes in their hands as they continued attacking Angele from both sides. Every attack was accompanied by another, showing no flaws at all. Angele tried to find an opportunity, and yet he failed to do so. He wanted to take out his knives, but he had absolutely no time to spare.CHI!One of them slash Angele\u2019s chest, resulting to an injury about 10 centimeters long.\u201cIt\u2019s over!\u201d One of the bandits yelled as he slashed toward Angele with his full strength.Angele did his utmost to block the attack with his crossguard sword, but he was still blown away to the ground. He couldn\u2019t stand up after the impact. His plan had failed and the power of the crossbows was something he hadn\u2019t expected. Angele had already experienced death before, and at this instance where death had once again chanced upon him, he actually calmed down completely. However, he was out of strength and severely injured, even losing no small amounts of blood and stamina.There was no way for him to stand against two bandits with strength of a top-level knight and four crossbows. His eyesight was already too hazy, but he could still see the bandits slowly walking toward him while shaking the blood off their broadswords.\u2018Zero, any plan left for me?\u2019 Angele thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Mystery (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u2018Chances of survival: 5.15%. No plan available other than the reserved one.\u2019 Zero\u2019s reply made Angele lose all hope.Angele wasn\u2019t surprised at the result, but it seemed as if he would have to use the reserved plan as his last resort. He had plans on increasing his growth speed using the special energy, also deciding to save the energy for future research. However, he probably had to use it now, otherwise, he would just have himself killed here. Angele wanted to at least slow them down.\u2018Commence the plan,\u2019 Angele said. He was lying on the ground and staring at the sky. Several clouds moved slowly and a black bird flew over while chirping.\u2018The sky looks like a pure gem\u2026\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Wait, gem?\u2019 Angele stopped thinking for a second as he remembered the magical word.\u201cManss!\u201d Angele didn\u2019t think too much and yelled out the word.Suddenly, intense green light covered him and made him look like a shining sun \u2014 a scene strange enough for one to witness.\u201cEnchanted item! Back off!\u201d The two bandits looked surprised that they even backed off right away. It was as though they had seen something horrifying.KA!Time ceased its incessant passing as everything turned black and white. The bandit was frozen in his motion with one of his feet still in the air. The leaves that were falling off the tree hadn\u2019t reached the ground. One mounted bandit was still aiming his crossbow at Angele. The golden sunlight turned into a black and white flash. No sounds could be heard, and even then, the wind that should\u2019ve been blowing came to a halt.Angele laid on the ground quietly. Green light perpetually emanated out of his body. Everything around him had come to a stop, such that the only thing in motion was nothing. Angele could somewhat smell something fishy, reminding him of the smell of the sea. He felt his body being covered by gentle wind.\u2018Warning! Warning! Radiation is infecting your body. Stored energy is being consumed quickly\u2026 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%...\u2019 Zero kept reporting. Angele finally realized that he was still alive, and then he stood up quickly. Successive ripples flowing like the waves of the sea was the current state of the green light on his body. Then, he walked toward the two bandits.CHI! CHI!Suddenly, the monochromatic state of black and white returned to its former hue, and even the movements of all things returned. The footsteps of the bandits, the noise of wind blowing through the trees, and the chirping of birds \u2014 all came back like nothing happened. The green light dissipated from Angele\u2019s body, and the world was once again dyed in its original color.The two bandits were still retreating, but their heads suddenly dropped to the ground and rolled backward. Blood spurted out of their necks, and the remains of their existence dropped to the ground.\u201cThat was the power of\u2026 wizards?\u201d Angele was completely dumbstruck and he couldn\u2019t believe what he just did. He looked at the two decapitated heads that had their eyes still open.\u2018Energy level reduced to zero.\u2019 Zero reported. Angele thought for a moment that he\u2019d only been dreaming however fleeting of a moment it was. Still, he lowered his body quickly, evading three crossbow bolts that flew over his head. He retrieved his daggers and threw it toward the remaining mounted bandits. One of the mounted bandits screamed in response to being struck while the other three fled on their horses with fear in tow.Angele looted the money pouch on the two dead bandits and headed back to the caravan. He felt his body paralyzed, unable to feel pain from all the wounds he had. However, he felt pain coming constantly from his brain. His vision was already too blurry, yet he ran onward to the direction of the caravan to return.Angele thought that the power he wielded was different to the one he had before, but he was more confounded at the fact that time had been frozen still. The power was too great and mysterious that it made him feel more fearful. He kept on running, uncertain of how much time had passed. Finally, from Angele\u2019s hazy vision, he saw someone he was familiar with.\u201cAngele! God!\u201d The baron\u2019s voice was shaky.Angele saw the surprised expression of the baron after he slumped on the latter\u2019s arms. The baron looked very nervous, and even people around them were screaming. Angele felt the pain in his brain getting worse. He saw his own reflection in the baron\u2019s eyes.Blood was coming out of Angele\u2019s orifices. His face was pale, eyes unfocused. The chip was sending information to him, but he could only hear nothing. The pain coming from his brain hindered him from thinking.*******************Fifteen days later.In the endless plain, three black carriages were slowly advancing through the grass like ants. The wind was blowing across like the billowing waves of the sea. In the carriage at the forefront, a teenager with brown hair was looking outside the window. His body was covered with gray bandages and his face looked pale.\u201cAngele, are you feeling any better?\u201d A man asked with a deep voice.\u201cMuch better, Father. I think I will fully recover shortly.\u201d Angele nodded and said.\u201cThat\u2019s good. Next time, I am not letting you fight alone.\u201d The baron looked relieved as he said this.Angele smiled with mixed feelings. It had been 15 days since they left the forest. He was in a coma for two days, but he slowly awakened. According to the chip, his muscle was badly injured, and he lost a lot of blood. The bone in his both arms were fractured, and also had moderate concussion and stroke.People in this world had general better physiques than the ones on Earth. It only took Angele 15 days to recover from such injury, instead of taking at least two months in the hospital on Earth. He was recovering very fast with the fruits of his daily training giving him assistance. Angele put his hand on the edge of the window and looked at the beautiful scenery. Although in reality, he was checking some information on the chip. He spent a long time trying to find out what actually happened that day.He had a general idea about the situation. The ring was found on Dice\u2019s body, but he never used it before he died. If he had used the energy, Angele would\u2019ve been dead for sure. He spent several days on analyzing the energy consumption and compared it to the moderate use he did before. Angele finally understood why Dice did not activate the ring.\u2018The radiation energy can only be used if the owner already has a certain amount of similar energy in the body, and it could only be activated using the command. The first time, the ring only brought some green light and agility enhancement, but it was nothing like that after. I guess the ring must have some sort of system to limit its power output.\u2019 Angele thought.Angele used the radiation power to increase his attribute, and his chip helped him store a certain amount of the power in his body, which fitted the condition for using the ring. The chip extracted all the power and broke the limitation set on the ring. That day, he successfully activated the power by yelling the proper command. The radiation power was released from the chip in full and consumed it all. The result was strong but horrifying.\u2018Dice probably had only obtained it recently, or else he could\u2019ve used the power before he died. Obviously, he could not activate it himself, so he kept it with him to store some radiation power into his body to fulfill the requirement of utilizing the ring.\u2019 Angele guessed.\u2018I finally understand why Dice didn\u2019t use the ring. The horrifying power damaged my muscle that day, probably due to the freezing of time. My speed was boosted to an impossible level, making me faster than time itself. Why did everything become black and white though? Maybe it was the radiation that changed the color around.\u2019 The carriage was moving slowly with Angele still making conjectures.\u2018Zero, show me the light spectrum that day.\u2019 Angele ordered.\u2018The color of the sunlight was removed by the radiation energy, leaving nothing but white. The shadows remained black, so you could only see black and white.\u2019 Zero reported and showed a graph of light spectrum to him. The columns on the graph kept changing to demonstrate the changes during that time.\u2018Why were there green lights on my body?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018You were the source of those lights.\u2019 Zero reported. It could analyze Angele\u2019s questions quickly, so it instantly sent the conclusions to him.Angele nodded his head slowly, finally having a general idea of the power. However, he used up the stored radiation energy.\u2018If the chip did not extract the energy, I wouldn\u2019t be able to use the ring myself. It requires the owner to have the similar energy as the ring, which means the owner must be a source of such energy already. People with such energy must be the Wizards.\u2019 Angele thought as he grabbed the ring on his necklace.\u2018It\u2019s most likely the case that the ring can only be activated by wizards. The two bandits spoke of it being an enchanted item. It might be the name for treasures such as this.\u2019 Angele looked at the ring carefully while using his finger to rub the emerald gently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Sequela (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele played with the emerald ring for a while and tied it back to his necklace. He tried to hide the whole thing inside his clothes. The carriages were moving forward ever so slowly, constantly bumping by the small stones on the road.The baron sat opposite to Angele in the leading carriage while holding a black canteen full of wine.\u201cIt\u2019s nice that we found a river to wash ourselves and our clothes. Otherwise, the whole caravan would not smell good.\u201d The baron drank some wine from the canteen and laughed after.\u201cOur water supply is still limited. It would be lucky for us if we could find another river in ten days. I can now smell the sweat from everyone the caravan.\u201d Angele laughed too.\u201cWell, according to the map, we are already on a shortcut to another river.\u201d The baron tried his best to find the best route. Angele looked at his father\u2019s tired face. The baron was still strong, but the wounds and the sequela were affecting his mental state. He had lost everything and all his friends had betrayed him not so long ago.Angele sighed. He knew Knight Audis\u2019s betrayal was a big shock to the baron, but there wasn\u2019t much he could do. Only time could heal the baron\u2019s broken heart.\u201cFather, I am going to check the other carriages.\u201d Angele said with a light tone.\u201cSure, just don\u2019t do any intense activities.\u201d The baron nodded before saying. Angele nodded in response and looked at the baron\u2019s face for a second. He opened the door and jumped off the carriage.The sunlight poured into the carriage after Angele opened the door, making the baron\u2019s hair look darker than before. He was looking at somewhere far outside the window as though he was reminiscing about the past. Angele somehow felt a bit sad after looking at his father, so he just walked towards the second carriage quickly.\u201cHi, Young Master Angele.\u201d One of the guards greeted.\u201cWant some fresh air, eh?\u201d Another one greeted him. Angele liked those guards more than the post knights and he trusted them more. Angele nodded and smiled before jumping onto the second carriage. Maggie\u2019s mother, Mrs. Jacklyn, was driving the carriage. This middle-aged woman was not attractive anymore, and Angele could see the wrinkles over her face. She looked like any other women in their mid-forties.\u201cYoung Master Angele, you are here.\u201d Mrs. Jacklyn smiled and greeted.\u201cYea, are they ready?\u201d Angele opened the door and asked.\u201cI heard they\u2019re prepared.\u201d Mrs. Jacklyn answered.\u201cGood.\u201d Angele nodded and got inside the carriage.The carriage was big, about the size of a large RV on Earth. It was like a large bedroom. Maggie, Celia and seven other people \u2014 10 in total including Mrs. Jacklyn \u2014 could easily stay in the carriage together.Angele had been surprised when he first saw one of those carriages, but he understood the reason when he realized that the size of a horse here was twice that of the ones on Earth. In the carriage, Maggie and Celia were organizing plucked flowers in the corner. They also caught insects and picked up fruits on the way. Those insects and fruits were piled up at the corner, emphasizing their colorful features. As Angele glanced around, he also saw other people sitting in other corners.Besides Maggie and Celia, there were Maggie\u2019s father, Celia\u2019s mother, and three other children of the baron: two boys and one girl. The children were playing with some ants. A pharmacist named Henry was also on the carriage sleeping with a tired face. Cecilia, who was covered with a blanket, was sleeping as well in the corner.The three children were Angele\u2019s brothers and sister, but they lowered their heads to greet when they saw Angele going in. It was their show of respect to him, especially when they were made aware of how strong Angele was after the recent events.\u201cAngele!\u201d Celia and Maggie put down the purple roots in their hands and came over to greet him.\u201cHow\u2019s the collection going?\u201d Angele had a glance on the random things in the corner.\u201cAs you ordered, we collected hundreds of different plants and insects these days. Everything is here besides the toxic ones.\u201d Maggie proudly answered before Celia could even talk.\u201cYou two did a great job.\u201d Angele kneaded Maggie\u2019s butt and also kissed Celia on her lips after praising the two of them. He didn\u2019t care what the spectators would think anyway.\u201cYou two can take a good rest now.\u201d Angele put those plants and insects into a larger bag. He then jumped off the carriage and got into the last one. The last carriage\u2019s coachman was Captain Mark, but no one else was in it. It was carrying all the supplies, such as food and water.\u201cDid my father come by recently? With Miss Katyusha?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cThe baron looked depressed recently, and Young Master, you should talk to him about it if you got time.\u201d Mark shook his head and said. Angele nodded. Miss Katyusha was the mother of Celia; she was wise and sexy. There were many beautiful ladies in the castle, but only she chose to stay with the baron when the baron asked this time. The baron began to like her more after that, and they even had some good time in the third carriage on the way. After Angele became injured last time, the baron barely came to the third carriage with her.\u201cFather is a bit stressed recently. Don\u2019t worry, he will get himself together.\u201d Angele said.\u201cYea\u2026\u201d Mark sighed and stopped talking after. Angele opened the door and got into the carriage. Besides the supplies, there was an empty space in the middle. Angele sat down by a wooden box and put down the bag in his hand. He took some purple leaves out of the bag and put them into his mouth. Angele\u2019s face scrunched after chewing those leaves since it didn\u2019t taste quite well. He looked disappointed after a while as he spat everything out on a piece of cloth he prepared earlier. Angele then grabbed a large green caterpillar that looked exactly like the ones on the earth, but it had two heads. It looked like a forked branch, but with its heads moving around in Angele\u2019s heads and it having a lot of wrinkles on its skin, it looked very unappetizing.Angele felt a bit sick. He applied a bit of strength on the caterpillar. The caterpillar died in a second and some of its green juice oozed out of its body. Angele dipped his finger in the juice and put it into his mouth.\u201cCrap!\u201d Angele\u2019s eyebrows scrunched, still looking disappointed. He kept trying different plants and insects, and it took him a while to empty the bag.\u201cFound two useful ones.\u201d Angele said with a light tone. He put some black tree berries back into the bag and some triangle leaves as well.He discovered about twenty different things that could increase his attributes, and he tried about thousands of different plants and insects. 4 out of 20 had no side-effects while the others all had something that would make Angele sick, so he only took the 4 with him. However, all the information was still stored in the chip including the useless ones. He merely wanted to keep adding things to his database that might be useful to him later on.He spat out the remaining of the things he tried on a piece of cloth beside him, and dumped all of them onto the ground outside after.\u2018How much information was recorded, Zero?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018About 2341 types of plants, 49 types of insects, 21 types of animal tissues.\u2019 Zero reported precisely.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot\u2026\u201d Angele took a deep breath and started thinking.\u201cAngele? Are you there?\u201d Maggie\u2019s voice came from outside.\u201cCome in.\u201d Angele stopped thinking and said. A girl got inside the carriage quickly. Maggie\u2019s body looked very attractive for her age, and yet only she was about 13 years old. Angele thought she looked like an 18-year-old girl on the earth. Additionally, she had decent sized breasts, attractive butt, and a slim waist. She was only wearing a gray one-piece and a pair of boots, but she still managed to show off what she was proud of. Her legs were fair and they looked shiny under the sunlight.\u201cAngele, I am here to change my clothes.\u201d Maggie\u2019s voice was very faint as she stood in front of Angele.\u201cChanging your clothes?\u201d He whispered beside Maggie\u2019s ear. Angele felt a bit aroused, but he still asked Maggie to sit in front of him.\u201cYea\u2026 Changing my\u2026 underwear\u2026 if you are asking.\u201d Maggie was blushing. Obviously, she wanted something else. Angele touched her long hair around her shoulder and smelled the fragrance on her.\u201cI will leave you here then.\u201d Angele smiled and said in a light tone.\u201cCould you\u2026 do it for me?\u201d Maggie shook her head, her expression very bashful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Sequela (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeTwo months later. Somewhere in the endless Anser Plain.Three black carriages with an insignia of an \u201ceagle around thorns\u201d engraved on both sides were moving slowly against the wind. The sun was in its highest as it was midday. Billowing clouds were obscuring the sky and even deterring the sunlight from pouring down the earth. Blustery was the wind that was blowing all over the grass throughout.Angele was sitting in the leading carriage looking outside the window. It was as though he was thinking of something. He used the plants and insects he had collected to slowly boost his attributes, but the sequela from his last injury brought him inconvenience. Though his body was strengthening according to the data, his limbs sprained several times during recent practices. The doctor informed him that he had osteoporosis after check-up and would take about a month for him to recover.Angele, who was wearing a black hunting suit, sat by the window of the carriage. He was learning to distinguish different sounds from the outside and catch the crucial information from the noises through the chip\u2019s assistance. He foresaw many possible bandit attacks, which helped their caravan to tread upon a safer path.They encountered several bandit groups, both big and small, but most of them were cleared by the baron. Larger bandit groups were all avoided because of the warnings given by Angele.About five or six encounters with the bandits went terribly bad. In one of these encounters, one of Angele\u2019s brothers took an arrow to his neck and died right away. That was the worst experience they had. During that fight, the bandits were robbing a noble convoy. They had mounted archers, and they were quite agile and proficient in executing the orders of their leader. Angele also took an arrow to himself as he witnessed the knights of the noble convoy being slain in an onslaught of countless arrows.The knights had attempted to charge forward, but many of them died from the shower of arrows. Several guards in the noble convoy burst out their potential in the final exchange, successfully driving away the bandits. Angele\u2019s caravan could\u2019ve been wiped off the face of the earth if they were the ones targeted by those bandits.On the way, Angele\u2019s caravan passed by many remnants of battlefields that were full of corpses. He could imagine just how intense the fights were. The baron also saw the corpse of someone he once knew, a grand knight from the capital city. The people in their caravan had become very scared after seeing those gruesome scenes, but after about ten days, they finally calmed down,Angele finally grasped the gist on how strong he actually was in this world. In the best fight he had, Angele slew 28 bandits with his bow and arrows and his sword all by himself. It was an impressive feat, but he still couldn\u2019t deal with mounted archers. He killed about 15 bandits in the fight that also had mounted archers in their ranks. He kept doing damage to them until he took an arrow to his right arm. The mounted bandits were very fast and agile as they kept on dodging the arrows upon the horses, making Angele use all of his arrows. Angele wouldn\u2019t have secured so many kills without the help of the chip.They had also been attacked by soldiers masquerading as bandits. The leader of those soldiers was a knight, and he shot multiple arrows that took out eight guards in the baron\u2019s caravan. He, however, was still slain with the coordinated attacks of the baron and Angele.\u2018Knights in this world are like the generals in ancient China. Just one of them can deal with hundreds of regular soldiers, though they still need good equipments. Without it, they are weak and they cannot deal with great numbers of ranged weapons.\u2019 Angele thought as he had now a better idea of knight-level warriors.\u2018Well, basically, knights are strong people with better fighting skills. However, I am still not the best.\u2019 Angele concluded, thinking that he wouldn\u2019t be able to contribute to anything in a real war.\u2018Check my body condition,\u2019 Angele ordered.\u2018Checking\u2026 completed. Angele Rio: Strength 2.7. Agility 3.0. Stamina 1.2.\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Damn sequela... My attributes are almost halved by it. I am not recovering so well,\u2019 Angele thought.\u201cSome people are fighting up ahead, stop the carriages!\u201d After about half an hour, Angele suddenly stood up and yelled. He detected another situation up ahead just by his hearing.\u201cMounted bandits?\u201d Baron looked over and asked.\u201cProbably, but it\u2019s just a small group.\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d The baron scrunched his eyebrows and said. He put on the silver chain armors on the side and grabbed his black greatsword. The baron opened the door and jumped off the carriage after it slowed down.\u201cAngele, some Rudin nobles are being surrounded by the bandits. Let\u2019s take another route.\u201d The baron yelled outside after a while. Angele was about to reply, but he heard something again and the expression on his face changed.\u201cNo, too late. Some of them are coming for us. Our carriages are much slower than their horses, prepare for battle!\u201d Angele yelled and put on his leather armor quickly. He also put his bow on his back and grabbed his silver crossguard sword before jumping off the carriage.Up ahead their caravan, sounds of battle resounded as two groups were fighting on the grassland, which were the noises Angele heard.\u201cHA~!\u201d A team of mounted bandits were screaming and traveling towards them. They had their bright blades raised up in the air.\u201cGet ready to fight!\u201d Captain Mark yelled as he drew his sword. After some noises that were made by the unsheathing of swords from the scabbards, all the guards had drawn their swords and prepared for the incoming fight. Angele held his longbow in his hand, completely focused on the situation. He had used up his white-feather arrows, so he was now using some random wooden arrows picked up from various battlefields. Though the wooden arrows dealt less damage, he had still collected plenty of them. In such a situation they were currently in, quantity was far better than quality in regards to its practicality. Angele had the best archery skills in the caravan, so the guards handed all their quivers to him.Angele grabbed a wooden arrow and nocked it onto his bow. The baron who wore his own chain armor stood in front of Angele. He had all bases covered just to block any ranged attacks that would threaten his son.BAM!A mounted bandit took the arrow with his body and fell right off his horse. As Angele kept releasing arrows one by one, about ten bandits who were on their way to the carriages died. Only two survived and they began to retreat.The baron looked at the noble convoy that had just been attacked. He saw the silver rose insignia on their carriages.\u201cThat\u2019s a silver insignia, so they must be some high class noble in Rudin Empire. At least at the rank of a duke. The rose insignia\u2026 They are of royal blood, so we can probably receive help when we arrive to Marua if we can save them,\u201d the baron said.\u201cHelp? What help? There are so many nobles of royal blood in this empire. I heard the royal court of Rudin Empire are split into four main factions and there are about ten sub-factions governed by each main faction. Who knows which one they belong to\u2026?\u201d Angele said, wholly showing that he wasn\u2019t impressed.\u201cBut we should take chances. After all, they at least have a silver insignia,\u201d the baron said with a deep voice.\u201cThe members of Rudin\u2019s royal court have good relationship with the Andes Alliance. Those ones are most likely intending to join some relatives there since many high-class Rudin nobles had connections with the Andes nobles through bonds of matrimony.\u201cAlso, there aren\u2019t too many mounted bandits and it looked like they were just some vanguards of a larger group,\u201d the baron continued.\u201cIf you say so, let\u2019s finish them off. We could use some of their equipments and we are also running out of weapon oils anyway.\u201d Angele scrunched his eyebrows and said.The carriages drew closer, making Angele get a clearer view on the nobles that were being attacked. Beside a small black carriage were two heavy armored knights who wielded heavy swords trying to protect a handsome young man behind them. The two were clad in silver plate armor, all at knight level. Their sword skills were dazzling, but it wasn\u2019t too effective in actual combat. The two were sweating heavily, seemingly unable to hold on any longer. The man being protected had fear etched all over his face. He was wearing luxurious clothes, looking as though he was a child from a high class noble family.About twenty mounted bandits were attacking the convoy in groups. There were 7 or 8 dead bandits lying on the ground, probably killed by the two knights. Angele once again scrunched his eyebrows again and grabbed the wooden arrows. Three bandits up ahead were pinned down by down. Three bandits were pinned down by him alone. Captain Mark rushed in with the baron while screaming, easily killing five of them.Chaos ensued. The bandits didn\u2019t expect this situation. One of the knight-level leaders from the bandit group attacked the baron once, but got blocked by him instead. Angele took this opportunity to shoot an arrow to the bandit leader in his right chest. It resulted in the man turning around and trying to run after being scared completely.The baron yelled and attacked him with his greatsword. The bandit leader\u2019s head was decapitated and it dropped to the grassland after. The rest of the bandits saw this scene and they started to retreat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Philip (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe three walked toward them after all the bandits fled.\u201cYou\u2019re looking at Count Philip, son of Marquis Syrias, of the Rudin Empire!\u201d One of the knights yelled while walking. The young man behind was busy fixing his own clothes, seemingly too concerned about his appearance.\u201cCount Philip, I\u2019m Baron Rio from the south. You grace us with your presence.\u201d The baron stepped forward and bowed to Philip. Angele smiled and followed suit. The rest of the guards in the baron\u2019s caravan became restless after hearing that the young man was a count. They, too, also bowed after seeing the baron and Angele. Some lowered their heads, some knelt, and some just drew their swords to show respect. The baron and Angele became speechless after seeing their guards\u2019 behaviors.\u201cKarl Rio, I thank you for saving me from danger. I shall repay you back sometime in the future.\u201d The young man in luxurious clothes seemed not concerned with the guards\u2019 actions, only stepping forward and speaking loudly. His voice was loud but clear, sounding like those singers on Earth.\u201cCount Philip, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, I wonder where you\u2019re heading to?\u201d Baron Karl straightened his posture and asked.Count Philip looked at the two knights for a second, unsure of whether he should answer or not.\u201cWe are heading to Marua Harbor wherein my father\u2019s best friend is the governor there. The situation is bad right now, so we\u2019re planning on joining him there,\u201d Philip smilingly said. He maintained a bit of a distance from the baron because he knew his status was higher and thought the baron was seeking something from him.\u201cOh, Count Philip, we\u2019re also traveling to Marua Harbor. If you don\u2019t mind, you can join my caravan. After all, more men will make the trip much safer.\u201d The baron was happy, but he didn\u2019t let it show on his face. Philip felt elated. He was actually thinking of the same thing after he saw the baron\u2019s strength.\u201cFine, I was about to return to my father\u2019s convoy. But since you asked, I\u2019ll accompany you for now,\u201d he said while nodding after a young knight whispered something to his ear.\u2018Dumb*ss! If you could return to your father\u2019s convoy, why would you join a random, low-class noble\u2019s caravan? You need better excuses. Obviously, you lost contact with your father. Those mounted bandits brought you enough trouble I suppose,\u2019 Angele thought. He looked at the two knights for a while. Their equipment was good-looking, but he doubted the effectiveness of those.\u2018Two male peacocks\u2026\u2019 Angele concluded.The baron went back to their caravan alongside the three. People got off the carriages to greet them. However, Philip didn\u2019t talk much, only nodding several times in response to their greetings. Angele scrunched his eyebrows as he watched the baron conversing with them about recent events and whatnot in Rudin Empire. Somehow, they found themselves sharing experiences, which further increased the familiarity with each other. It was also because they had friends that were similarly friends with both of them. And so, Philip\u2019s carriage joined the caravan.Angele stood by Captain Mark on the sidelines. With his status, he couldn\u2019t join the conversation, so he just stood there and listened.\u201cMr. Karl, I\u2019m a bit sleepy so I\u2019m going to take some rest now,\u201d Philip yawned after talking for a while.\u201cSure, we\u2019ll make sure no one disturbs your dream,\u201d the baron said while smiling. Philip nodded in response and followed one of the knights back to his carriage. The other knight told the baron something.\u201cI know, please wait a second,\u201d the baron nodded while the knight went back to the carriage with a satisfied expression. Angele clearly heard the knight\u2019s words, checking whether the caravan had enough food and water.\u201cFather, although we just got enough water for the next month, we still need to cut everyone\u2019s daily ration. Also, we\u2019re short on food\u2026\u201d Angele said after the three left.\u201cWe saved Count Philip, so we\u2019ll get something in return when we get to Marua Harbor. We\u2019ll live a much better life later if we can save some food and water for them now,\u201d the baron said after stopping Angele from talking.\u201cWe don\u2019t even know if they\u2019re actually high-class nobles\u2026\u201d Angele said and scrunched his eyebrows.\u201cI\u2019ve heard of his name. He\u2019s one of the most beloved sons of Marquis Syrias. He has two knights guarding him, so I was certain he\u2019s someone important at least,\u201d the baron explained.\u201cThose two\u2026 They didn\u2019t look like they were at knight level,\u201d Angele was still wondering.\u201cThey\u2019re wielding the royal sword skills, which are mostly for show. These skills are used for performing in front of high-class nobles, but the skills aren\u2019t effective in actual combat. They probably had some rare resources to help them reach knight level. They could\u2019ve even had decent backgrounds as well,\u201d the baron laughed as he said.\u201cReally?\u201d Angele said. It looked like he realized something.\u201cWell, let\u2019s just try to treat them well. Thanks to the mounted bandits, we got enough horses for the rotation on the way. We can travel much faster now, though it will take us about two months to reach the border of Andes. It\u2019s only two months, then we\u2019ll be fine after,\u201d the baron said after tapping on Angele\u2019s shoulder lightly.Angele nodded and he stopped talking.Two guards brought food and water to the count. Meanwhile, others collected the horses from the dead bandits to use those horses as spares. Angele walked toward the bandits he had killed using arrows and checked the wooden arrows. Most of them were broken into pieces and couldn\u2019t be reused. The bandits didn\u2019t carry arrows with them, so Angele was a bit disappointed. He grabbed a cracked dark brown wooden arrow, and it snapped after Angele lightly applied force on it.\u201cDamn. I need more wooden arrows now,\u201d Angele looked a bit nervous.*********************Three days later, somewhere in the Anser Plain.The sky was bleak as it rained. A caravan was moving forward slowly along the endless plains. Of all the carriages of that caravan, the second carriage had better decorations compared to the other three. Meanwhile, a brown-haired teenager who was in the leading carriage was chewing on something. Purple wildberries were in his hand. The teenager wasn\u2019t handsome, but his countenance showed a calm and reliable personality. He was Angele, who was wearing a black hunting suit, and he had been trying his utmost to recover completely.He grabbed a berry and threw it into his mouth. It had a very sour taste but was still manageable by Angele. There was a black water canteen on the table beside him and around it lied a bunch of berries. Angele kept eating the berries while looking outside the window. In about ten minutes, he finished eating all the berries and drank water right after.The door was opened by someone outside. With scrunched eyebrows, there came in a bearded middle-aged man with long blonde hair wearing a black-red noble suit. The man was Baron Karl.\u201cAngele, we\u2019re in trouble. Our food and water supply are nearly in the gutters. This will last us only for about half a month,\u201d the baron said.\u201cWell, three people joined our caravan not too long ago. Father, what\u2019s your plan?\u201d Angele said with a serious expression.\u201cWe can kill some horses if we have to. We got four horses from the bandits anyway,\u201d the baron said.\u201cThat\u2019s the last thing we want to do. Horse meat tastes sour and it smells bad. People won\u2019t even bother with it unless they\u2019re completely starving,\u201d Angele said in a light voice. The baron stopped talking and began thinking of plausible alternatives.\u201cYesterday, I saw the count pouring off a whole bucket of water from his carriage. I think he used it to shower. Also, they never finished the white bread and meat soup we gave them. They just threw out whatever they didn\u2019t want. If we let them waste our supplies like that, we won\u2019t last for long,\u201d Angele said.\u201cIf we don\u2019t fulfill their requirements, they\u2019ll most likely become dissatisfied. They\u2019re used to the extravagant lifestyle they had in the city. They just asked me for oil and to do the maintenance for their equipment. We don\u2019t even have enough oil for cooking, and yet, they want to use it for their equipment!\u201d The baron wryly laughed, disappointment apparent in his expression.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll try to bear with them. However, it\u2019d be nice if you could try talking to them about the situation, Father. Otherwise, with the amount of food that we have, it won\u2019t even last us for five days,\u201d Angele said.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll talk to them about it,\u201d the baron nodded and left the carriage.Angele sighed. After grabbing his water canteen that was half-full, he jumped off the carriage. He walked toward the back and got on the last carriage. Captain Mark, who was the coachman for the last carriage, was in low spirits. He forced a smile on his face when he saw Angele coming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: Philip (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cCaptain Mark, I\u2019m here to get water.\u201d Angele smiled while shaking his water canteen.\u201cWe don\u2019t have much left. One knight just took another bucket of water. He said he was going to wash clothes,\u201d Mark said in a helpless tone.\u201cWashing clothes? On a rainy day? He can just save some rain water in his bucket easily. Whatever, I need some jam and white bread. I\u2019m a bit hungry,\u201d Angele scrunched his eyebrows and said.\u201cWell, only black bread is left. The loaves of white bread were taken by the two knights,\u201d Mark said with a bitter smile on his face.\u201cThey took everything?\u201d Angele was a bit surprised.\u201cYep.\u201d Mark nodded. Knowing about that, Angele felt slightly angry.\u201cI\u2019ll take a look myself.\u201d Angele opened the door and got into the carriage.The carriage that had been full of supplies before now looked empty. The brown wooden barrels were only half-filled. Angele walked straight toward one of the water barrels. Empty. He opened the second one. Empty again. Angele continued checking. The third, fourth, and the fifth were all empty as well and only the last two water barrels were half-filled. Those barrels were supposed to easily last the whole caravan for about a week, but now, it\u2019s nearly gone. Angele became infuriated.Angele scooped some water into his water canteen and covered the water barrels with the lids after. He then opened the barrel that contained food such as bread, jam, and meat jerky. Black bread filled the barrel while not much meat jerky was left inside. Angele took a loaf of black bread and some meat jerky. He put the lid back after scrunching his eyebrows and headed back to the leading carriage right away.The baron wasn\u2019t back yet. Angele sat at the table alone and looked at the black bread in his hand. The size was about half an arm and had a hardness comparable to a piece of wood. It had two yellow scars on its surface. Contrary to its outer appearance, its inside was white. Angele grabbed the bread and took a bit. It was very hard that it even made sounds akin to cutting through a board. White bread crumbs fell off the ground. As Angele ate it, he felt quite unhappy. It was hard, had a dislikable texture and no taste. Angele\u2019s mood worsened as every minute passed.HUA!Angele heard someone pouring out water at the back, so he opened the window to check. One of the knights in silver armor was returning to the count\u2019s carriage with a silver plate in his hand. On the ground, Angele could see spilled soup and pieces of white bread that were only half-eaten. It seemed they only ate the softest part of the bread and threw the remains away. It was really a waste.Angele alternately looked at the black bread in his hand and the white bread on the ground, his mind in turmoil about the things that should be done. Horrifyingly enough, his face had already contorted to that of a demon that embodied wrath. But then, he took a deep breath and closed the window. Angele quickly finished the black bread and ate all the meat jerky he had taken. He then drank some water quickly, and finally, he felt a bit better.Angele calmed himself down and leaned his back on the wall. He decided not to think of the count too much and started checking his own condition instead.\u2018Zero, check my body condition,\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Checking\u2026 Angele Rio: Strength 2.9. Agility 4.1. Stamina 2.5. You have reached the limits set by your gene. Health condition: Good.\u2019 Zero finished analyzing quickly.\u2018I reached my limit\u2026\u2019 Angele thought while feeling disappointed. His attributes were nothing compared to the strong warriors in this world, but at least he could protect himself against random scrubs. He, however, had mixed feelings about his situation. He took the emerald ring tied upon his necklace. Its gem had already lost its hue and cracks were all over it. The words engraved on the ring were also broken by the cracks. Angele rubbed on the surface of the ring slowly.\u201cIf I cannot increase my attributes anymore, this mysterious power will be my only chance to obtain power,\u201d Angele said while carefully staring at the emerald.He examined the ring over hundreds of times, but the only new thing he discovered was the sentence engraved on it, which meant \u2018The Ramsoda College \u2013 Venis\u2019.\u201cThe Ramsoda College\u2026 Where is this place?\u201d Angele asked in a faint voice\u201cThis Venis might be the original owner of the ring, and he could actually be a real wizard,\u201dAngele fiddled with the ring for a while, but he didn\u2019t discover anything else. He put it back to the necklace and hid it on his chest underneath his clothes. Though the energy in it had been completely consumed, this was still the one and only object that connected him to the world of wizards. Angele felt like he\u2019d still obtain more clues from the ring, so he had it kept safe.The carriages kept moving toward their destination, and then another two days had passed. The caravan members were in dire need of clean water, so people had begun filtering the water on the ground using gauzes.The caravan stopped by a water puddle. At present, thick, heavy clouds blanketed the sky.\u201cWhy are we stopping? Let\u2019s keep moving. We\u2019re already very close to the border. Also, the bandits are most likely still searching for us!\u201d A knight in silver armor said with a disappointed face. He even put his arms in front of his chest.Angele and the baron were standing at the back without a noise, but they were already completely enraged. The three took about three buckets of clean water from their supply carriage, which was the main reason why they were now lacking water. They didn\u2019t want to drink the water in the water puddles, thinking that they could get poisoned if they were to do so.\u201cIt won\u2019t take long, so please wait a second,\u201d the baron said in a light tone, his fury completely masked. The guards and the maids were busy scooping water into the wooden barrels from the water puddles. The water was dirty and the puddles were full of grass and mud. However, that was what they could only find. The water would become clean if filtered properly, anyway.Count Philip got off the carriage while rubbing his eyes and looked at the people around the water puddles.\u201cWhy are we not moving?\u201d He walked toward them and spoke with a deep voice. One of the knights explained the reason, which resulted in the count scrunching his eyebrows.\u201cReally!\u201d the count said. He glanced at the group and saw someone who made him a bit excited.\u201cMr. Karl,\u201d he yelled.\u201cAnything I can do for you? Count Philip?\u201d the baron turned around and bowed.\u201cWell, I need a few maids to organize my carriage. Get those two into mine. That won\u2019t be an issue to you, right?\u201d Philip asked as he pointed at Maggie and Celia. The baron became unhappy when he looked over.\u201cWell, it would be an issue actually,\u201d Angele said, hindering his father from trying to talk.\u201cThose two have their jobs. I\u2019m afraid they won't be able to serve you well, Count Philip,\u201d Angele smiled and said. He knew what Philip truly wanted. Obviously, he merely wanted to have fun with the two girls. However, Angele had already considered the two girls as his own lovers a long time ago. With these facts laid out, he should\u2019ve already unleashed his fury, but he controlled his anger well.\u201cI remember you. You killed about ten mounted bandits using your bow that day. You\u2019re good. I like warriors like you,\u201d Philip said in a light tone after carefully looking at Angele.\u201cThanks for your praise, Count Philip,\u201d Angele bowed and said.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, so just bring the two girls to me after. I\u2019m tired so I\u2019m returning to my carriage.\u201d Philip started to walk back to his carriage with the two knights following him at his back.Angele and the baron finally unmasked their rage on their faces. Angele placed his hand on the sheath, about to draw his sword, but the baron stopped him and shook his head.\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d the baron said.\u201cI know, Father.\u201d Angele put down the sheath after he calmed down for a bit. He tried to smile, only to look slightly funny.\u201cLet me handle this, I\u2019ll talk to them. Think twice before you act, you know it\u2019s not worth it,\u201d the baron said with a light voice. Angele nodded and deeply breathed to calm his rage.The baron continued talking with Angele for a while, after which, the former walked toward the count\u2019s carriage. The baron knew his relationships between Maggie and Celia, so he\u2019d be able to handle this matter well. Angele took a deep breath and licked his lips. He then turned over to look at the water puddles. Maggie and Celia were carefully scooping water into the wooden barrels. The wind was blowing all over, making their hair flying about in the wind. Their clothes looked tighter because of the wind, thus emphasizing their sexy figures. Angele calmed down and even felt a bit better after looking at them.\u201cIt\u2019s done,\u201d the baron walked towards Angele and nodded.\u201cThank you, Father,\u201d Angele felt relieved.\u201cDon\u2019t make Philip mad. The only thing we need from him is the relationship that he has with the high-class nobles in the Marua Harbor,\u201d the baron said.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Angele nodded and took a glance on the count\u2019s carriage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Clue (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter filling up the barrels, Angele and his father returned to the carriage and persisted along their present route once again in a slow pace. Outside was still cloudy and darkness covered the interior of the carriage, too. Angele and the baron sat opposite to each other around the table.\u201cAngele, why do you care so much about those two girls? You can get anything you want when we arrive at Marua Harbor. There\u2019s no point in disappointing Philip especially now,\u201d the baron said with his eyebrows scrunched.\u201cI understand, Father. I know what\u2019s more important, don\u2019t worry,\u201d Angele smiled and nodded.\u201cRemember, you\u2019re the most important person to me. Don\u2019t get yourself into dangerous situations easily,\u201d the baron said, staring at his son for a brief period. Angele nodded in response. He knew that his father thought that arguing with the count over two girls wasn\u2019t worth it. This kind of situation was fine if his family had its former strength. But now that their family had considerably weakened, they needed a wall to lean on. Namely, the count.However, as a being that formerly lived on Earth, Angele disliked just handing over his girls to someone else. The thought of doing such things would hurt his pride. Angele sat in his seat continuously listening to his father\u2019s ramblings. This conversation of their lasted for about half an hour.\u201cIf you make up your mind to give up something, just make sure your sacrifice won\u2019t be in vain. Don\u2019t blow it,\u201d the baron ended the conversation with this statement. He left the carriage to verify the route they needed to pass through. This was something he had been doing every day since their trip began.\u201cPhilip isn\u2019t going to give up easily. Also, I can\u2019t do anything to him with these many people around. If anyone were to leak the information when we arrive at Marua Harbor, I\u2019ll be in deep trouble,\u201d Angele said with a solemn expression on his face. This time, he was alone in the carriage contemplating over a matter. Angele thought for a while, but he couldn\u2019t figure out a plan. He once again took out the emerald ring and stared at its gem. The emerald retained its color, yet its brilliance was already lost and had cracks all over its surface. Looking at the ring somehow calmed him down.\u201cAh!\u201d Suddenly, someone screamed from one of the carriages at the back.\u201cIt\u2019s Maggie! That son of a bitch!\u201d Angele jumped out of the carriages and got into the third carriage. He opened the door and saw Maggie\u2019s hand that had gotten injured by one of the plants in front of her and Celia. It seemed that they were organizing different plants, and Maggie\u2019s finger was punctured by a thorn.\u201cYoung Master Angele?\u201d Maggie became surprised at Angele\u2019s abrupt appearance, which undoubtedly made people assume that something must\u2019ve happened. Angele looked over the people inside the carriage. He felt relieved when he saw not a presence of Philip and his knights here.\u201cWell, I heard your scream, so I\u2019m just checking if anything happened. Maggie seems fine, though. I\u2019m returning to my carriage,\u201d Angele said and went outside without waiting for a chance of them to talk. He closed the door and walked toward the leading carriage quickly.The speed of the caravan wasn\u2019t too fast, making it possible for Angele to easily outrun the carriages. While passing by Philip and his knights\u2019 carriage, he witnessed Philip looking outside the window carelessly. He nodded his head when he saw Angele passing by, seemingly unconcerned about the two girls any longer. Angele saw his actions, thus he smiled at him in response.\u201cWait a second, Young Master Angele,\u201d someone with a deep voice said. Angele knew it was Philip, so he bowed to him after turning around.\u201cCount Philip, is there anything I can help you with?\u201d Angele said as he slowed his walking pace to keep up with the carriage.\u201cThe ring on your necklace caught my attention.\u201d Philip stared at the ring on Angele\u2019s neck.\u201cYou know something about this ring?\u201d Angele was in a hurry, so he forgot to place the ring underneath his clothes. Philip inadvertently saw it when Angele was passing by.\u201cIt\u2019s just a ring that my father had given me, like a special memento.\u201d Angele quickly returned it underneath his clothes and said.\u201cCould you take a look for me if you know something about this? It could be something rare, I suppose,\u201d Angele thought for a second before handing the ring over to Philip. Philip scrunched his eyebrows, but he saw Angele smiling at him. He then nodded and grabbed the ring. Philip looked at the words engraved on the ring, and in an instant, his facial expression changed.\u201cDid you discover something?\u201d Angele was looking at him, feeling elated that Philip probably knew something about it.\u201cGive me a price, I want this ring,\u201d Philip said with a light tone.\u201cWell, if you find it charming, just consider it my gift to you. Can you just introduce my family to the governor after we arrive at Marua Harbor?\u201d Angele said with his smile retained. For some reason, Philip found Angele\u2019s smile ice-cold. But he didn\u2019t let his suspicion show on his face, still nodding in response.\u201cNo problem at all. Thanks, Young Master Angele. You guys saved me. I\u2019ll make sure you live a better life there. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2026\u201d Philip closed the window and lowered the curtain.Angele stopped walking and looked at Philip\u2019s carriage. A plan was formulated.***************It was night. The caravan decided to camp under a hill, and so made an encirclement out of their carriages. Philip sat inside his own carriage, carefully looking at the ring.\u201cAn enchanted ring! Yet, that dumbass just gave it away. Even one without energy could be traded for a hundred soldiers\u2019 equipment!\u201d One of the knights beside him spoke in a tone brimming with excitement.\u201cIt\u2019s a ring the Ramsoda College has. If you want to get into this college, you\u2019ll need a special recommendation from the Andes Alliance School\u2026 If I were to show this ring to the school, I\u2019ll get admitted right away.\u201d Philip excitedly nodded. He was looking at the ring as though it was a priceless treasure.\u201cIf you can get admitted into the Alliance school, the marquis will treat you much better,\u201d another knight said, his happiness for him apparent.The oil lamp brought light over the emerald on the ring. Green light reflected into the eyes of the three.\u201cRings like this were trophies the school gave out before. I heard I could use it to get in without taking the exam. If this is one of those, the value will be extremely high!\u201d Philip said with a light tone. He wasn\u2019t laughing, but the knights knew he was elated.\u201cThat young guy is unlucky, knowing none of it. He treated it like an ordinary ring. Ha.\u201d One of the knights laughed.\u201cWell, he\u2019s just a low-class noble from the countryside and has no way to obtain such information. He probably doesn\u2019t even know of the Andes Alliance School, and you expect him to know about those trophies? And take it to the school?\u201d Philip said after shaking his head.HUA!The door of the carriage was opened by someone.\u201cAndes Alliance School? Trophies?\u201d Angele spoke in a gentle tone as he walked into the carriage with a smiling face. His black hunting suit blended into the shadows of the dark night; his brown hair rustled in the wind.\u201cYou were spying on us?\u201d The three became surprised, and Philip became furious.\u201cI\u2019m not, ha. My hearing is just too keen, so your voices just lingered onto me. I didn\u2019t expect something so interesting though,\u201d Angele said as he continued to smile. The two knights looked at each other for a second and unsheathed the swords by their side at the same time.BANG! BANG!Angele drew his sword in but a second and moved around in the carriage as though he was dancing. His sword had blood smeared on it when he returned to his original position. The two knights started screaming as their hands were dismembered. They fell down to the ground after Angele managed to exploit the gaps in their armor.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d Philip yelled. He was trying to maintain a calm demeanor, however, his eyes betrayed such expectations as fear shone upon it.\u201cI am the son of Marquis Syrias, how dare you! I\u2019m going to kill your whole family unless you kill everyone that\u2019ll know of this!\u201d he continued.\u201cAngele! What are you doing!\u201d The baron rushed into the carriage with a disappointed look. He saw the two knights screaming on the ground. Angele was about to explain, however, Philip threw his teapot that contained hot water inside toward them. Philip jumped out of the window, fleeing with a speed at the knight level.\u201cHuh!\u201d Angele dodged the teapot and jumped off the carriage right away. He saw Philip mounting on a horse, clearly attempting to flee.\u2018Analyzing the distance, modifying the range\u2026\u2019 Blue-colored information showed up in front of Angele. A red dot was marked on Philip\u2019s body.\u2018Analyzing necessary strength, modifying\u2026\u2019\u2018Completed.\u2019 Zero did a series of analysis and reported it to Angele.Angele smiled and aimed his sword at the red dot. He threw it toward Philip at full strength, and the silver crossguard sword struck the right side of Philip\u2019s waist after spinning for a while. Philip screamed and fell off the horse.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: Clue (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe baron jumped off the carriage, looked at Philip, and threw the two knights to the ground. What Angele had just done upset him. Everyone around became startled, and people stopped what they were doing to check on the situation.\u201cYoung Master, Baron\u2026 What\u2019s going on?\u201d Captain Mark walked toward them with a surprised look.\u201cEveryone! Come here!\u201d Angele yelled instead of answering his query. He grabbed Philip by his arm and threw him near the two knights.\u201cYou! You want to die?! My father is Marquis Syrias. He\u2019ll hunt down every single one of you if you kill me!\u201d Philip was hysterically screaming out of fear. Angele laughed before taking out the ring out of Philip\u2019s pocket. He hid it in his palm so no one else could see it and placed it inside his own pouch.Angele looked at the baron and saw the latter feeling unhappy. They stared at each other for a second and started laughing after.\u201cI assume you have a plan,\u201d the baron said with a deep voice.\u201cYes, Father,\u201d Angele nodded and smiled.People walked over and encircled the three. No one said a word. Killing a count was probably too heavy a burden for them.Angele looked around and clapped his hands.\u201cAlright, we\u2019re all in the same boat here. The trip is tough, but it makes us stronger. Now, I have a good method for us to deepen our relationships.\u201d Angele looked around and said while clapping his hands. The baron who looked relaxed threw his iron dagger to his son.\u201cMark!\u201d Angele grabbed the dagger and called the captain.\u201cYes!\u201d Captain Mark swallowed hard and took the dagger Angele handed over to him.\u201cEach one of you will cut them once, don\u2019t aim at the vital points,\u201d Angele smiled and said. Mark looked at Angele and felt a chill on his back from his smile. He kept nodding, and after he lowered down his body, Mark gashed a deep wound on Philip.\u201cAh! You! You! Damn!\u201d Philip was screaming like crazy.\u201cMy father will do me justice!\u201d he continued.\u201cNext,\u201d Angele yelled with such calmness. Another guard took the dagger and\u2026 The three kept screaming and cursing on the ground. After 5 minutes, everyone including the women and teenagers had already cut them once.\u201cGood, we\u2019re a very tight team now,\u201d Angele clapped and smiled. Philip and his knights had wounds all over their bodies and were losing too much blood. They were not cursing anymore, and instead, they kept begging for their lives with weak voices.\u201cBurn them. We need to continue on our way,\u201d Angele said as he glanced at the caravan members, but people were afraid to look at him.\u201cI don\u2019t know why you decided to kill them, but the result is fine. Let\u2019s just forget about what happened today.\u201d The baron sighed and stood on the side.\u201cI messed up your plan, Father. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Angele lowered his head and apologized.\u201cYou\u2019ve got your reasons. However, our family is weak now and there are many high-class nobles in a large city like Marua. As I said before, make sure you think twice before acting,\u201d the baron put his arm on Angele\u2019s shoulder and said.\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Angele nodded. They started a fire and threw the three into it. The three screamed for a second from the scorching pain until they were burnt to death quickly. The armors of the knights had become red and smoldering hot from the fire.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d the baron looked at the fire and left. No one spoke a word as they returned to their own carriages. They decided to keep moving during the night. The thing that had happened today was too scary and people needed the time keep it off their minds. Teenagers like Maggie and Celia used the dagger too; their faces still looked pale from fright.People heard the howls of wolves from the place they just left.\u201cTimberwolves, they will eat up the bodies there. They don\u2019t even fear the fire,\u201d the baron opened the window to take a look and said. Angele nodded. He learned about the Timberwolves from one of the books in the special library, and they were very different from the ones on earth. Timberwolf here usually lived alone and was the size of a buffalo. It had black fur and had no fear of fire.\u201cWe left their carriage there, would that be fine?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, so many Rudin nobles were killed in the plain. People would think it was the bandits\u2019 work, and we even left some money in the carriage. Bandits passing by will rob it clean, and they\u2019ll become the main targets of whoever attempts to search for Philip,\u201d the baron said. It was as though he had a lot of experience about such situations.\u201cWe\u2019ll be safe after we cross the border in half a month,\u201d he continued. Angele looked outside the window. It was already dark, only the moon that hung in the sky and the grass on the ground near the carriage could be seen.\u201cFather, have you ever heard of the Andes Alliance School?\u201d Angele suddenly asked.\u201cHow do you know about it? Barely anyone knows of it,\u201d the baron said with a surprised expression.\u201cI heard it from the count,\u201d Angele said.\u201cWell, for him, it could be possible,\u201d the baron said before he drank some water from his water canteen.\u201cAndes Alliance School is the best school in the whole Andes. Its duty is to train elites in the country, only taking a small number of students in each year. People who graduated from the school all become influential people of the country. They all become high-class nobles. This school is vastly different from ordinary noble schools as it has high standards for admission. Also, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a farmer or a noble. As long as you\u2019re talented, you\u2019ll get the chance. I thought of sending you to that school, but your body wasn\u2019t capable of accepting the Life Energy Seed\u2026\u201d the baron said with faint despondency on his face.\u201cWell, I found a ring not so long ago, and Philip said the ring could help me get into that school with exam exemption,\u201d Angele laughed and took out the ring. The baron was surprised and grabbed it to examine it.\u201cIf it\u2019s true, this will be our family\u2019s only hope,\u201d the baron said with a tone that seemed a bit excited.\u201cI think it\u2019s true. The problem is, we need to find the location of the school and the way it tests its students,\u201d Angele said.\u201cPhilip saw the ring and tried to take it from me. I thought he was going to kill us all after we arrive at the Marua Harbor just to make sure I wouldn\u2019t disrupt his plan,\u201d Angele made his own conjecture.\u201cThat is very possible, especially since those high-class nobles are quite likely to do something like that. However, I think you showed the ring to him on purpose, right? Or were you trying to figure out how much it worth? Wait, did you do it for the girls? Angele, I really can\u2019t guess what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d the baron said.\u201cA bit of each. I\u2019ll make sure to think twice before acting in the future,\u201d Angele lowered his head and said. The baron actually knew him well.\u201cI\u2019ve decided. When we arrive at Marua, I\u2019ll ask your aunt to find the information about the Andes Alliance School. If you get accepted as a student\u2026.\u201d the baron didn\u2019t finish his sentence. He just began smiling.***************************Ten days later, the caravan entered the border of Andes.Outside the Anser Plain were many hills around and thriving trees. There were also many different plants and animals. Angele could sometimes see some abandoned iron mines, and he started seeing other caravans traveling toward Marua. Most of them were merchants while some were Rudin nobles that were trying to join their relatives in Marua.Angele kept analyzing different species and stored their information in the chip. Though his attributes wouldn\u2019t increase any longer, the information could still be useful in the future if he could get into the school. With the help of the chip, he would be learning much faster than others and he would never forget anything he saw. Studying wouldn\u2019t pose a problem to him. After all, what he only needed was the sources. Others probably had to go through many mistakes to find out the truth, but Angele only needed the chip to rule out all the false information. He would be able to find the easiest way to comprehend the materials.\u201cIf I can get into that school, I\u2019ll probably be able to find the Ramsoda College mentioned on the ring. That college is connected to the wizards for sure.\u201d Angele was getting excited. Recently, he kept looking at the ring at least several times in a small span of time. He, however, was a bit disappointed that Philip didn\u2019t carry anything like that with him. It seemed that enchanted items were very rare, so Angele wondered how Dice managed to get one. Angele was curious, and he really wanted to know who Dice really was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: School (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele felt relaxed ever since they crossed the border. It didn\u2019t take long for them to reach Marua Harbor. Outside of its main city were merchants of great numbers gathered around. It seemed as though this faith of merchants had created small markets that encircled Marua. Many people walked around to and fro, showing that the markets were all bustling in activities.It was about 3 pm in the afternoon when Angele\u2019s caravan arrived. The sky was cloudy and beneath it were carriages that were slowly moving through the bustling markets. They were together with a large merchant caravan that dealt with sea salt business. About two days ago, they joined with them. The baron paid 50 gold coins to the leader of the merchant caravan, so they could enter the city easily with the help of the merchants.The baron was sitting in the leading carriage and gazing upon the huge city. He was met with gray city walls of towering height, and from his angle, it seemed as though it were endless. The entrance ahead of him was wide open that he could clearly see people busily partaking in their own activities inside. Some carriages were heading out of the city with heavy goods on their carts at the back while some were conversing with the guards to gain passage into the city. The guards were fully geared. Black iron armors covered and protected them. Lances were each held in their hands.\u201cThis is Marua City?\u201d Angele asked. He got out of the carriage and sat beside his father.\u201cYes, we can head to the outer city once we pass through here. With the help of the merchant caravan, we can get in easily such that they don\u2019t to screen us individually anymore,\u201d the baron smiled upon saying this.\u201cIf we didn\u2019t join the merchants, it would\u2019ve taken us a long time just to get in. Although we ourselves have entry passes, the screening process would\u2019ve been a pain,\u201d he continued.Angele nodded before he glanced around. All the carriages he saw were quite similar to theirs. The guards took off their gears and stored them in the supply cart. When they arrived at the entrance, a fat young man got off from the red wooden carriage at the forefront. The man wore a black coat, and rather than looking like a businessman, he seemed more like a chef.The man conversed with the guards for several seconds while maintaining a smiling face, after which he put a small pouch in one of the guards\u2019 hand. The guard then laughed and waved his hands to signal a legitimate entry. However, Angele noticed the guards taking a glance for a while on their caravan. They probably knew of their identities, but they couldn\u2019t be bothered with it.The caravan entered the city swiftly. What they witnessed was the sight of a clean and tidy street, which had a minuscule amount of litters on the ground. Both sides of the street were filled with vendors selling countless different merchandise such as salt, seafood, and even some people were buying second-hand goods. Pearls were also being sold while some had strange animals that Angele had never seen before as merchandise. Occasionally, he could see some people haggling with the store owners.Angele\u2019s caravan was moving in the middle of the street. A few of them looked at the streets with curious gazes. Some of the officers of the harbor were slowly going around the stalls and stores, collecting management fees. For a few times, several carts that carried massive amounts of salt passed by Angele\u2019s carriage.They continued along for about half an hour and went past several streets before reaching an intersection. Alongside a gray stone building, a plump middle-aged noblewoman was standing with three workers.\u201cMy lovely sister Maria, long time no see. It feels great to see you doing well,\u201d he yelled.\u201cDear brother, I\u2019m happy to meet you too.\u201d The woman smiled gently and they hugged each other. The baron then asked Angele to step outside.\u201cThis is Angele, my second son. He was born after you got married. I think you\u2019ve never seen each other before,\u201d the baron said as he patted Angele\u2019s shoulder. Maria looked at Angele for a while as though she was checking him all over.\u201cGood kid, I hope you can get along with my son Buster, your cousin.\u201d Maria smiled and said.\u201cThanks, Aunt Maria,\u201d Angele lowered his head and replied politely.\u201cAlright, I have prepared a party for you guys at the manor. Also, the Rose Garden has been emptied for you, so you can move in anytime you want. But brother, I thought you\u2019d bring a lot more people than this. Where\u2019s old Wade?\u201d Maria nodded and asked.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later, let\u2019s get back first,\u201d the baron said with a deep voice, sadness hinted in his tone.\u201cSure, let\u2019s get back. Anger, lead the way for the baron.\u201d Maria stopped for a second then nodded after.\u201cYes, Ma\u2019am,\u201d one of the workers answered. Angele didn\u2019t follow his father to the leading carriage. Instead, he got on the second one. He knew his father hadn\u2019t seen his sister for years, so they must have a lot to say to each other. Maggie, Celia, their relatives, the pharmacist, and Captain Mark all looked a bit worried. However, their anxiousness dissipated after seeing Angele getting on their carriage.\u201cYoung Master Angele, what work can we do at the harbor? I know nothing besides killing\u2026\u201d Mark said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry; you\u2019ve been with my father since long ago. He\u2019ll make sure you get a job you want,\u201d Angele smiled.Maggie and Celia were sitting by his side with nervous expressions. They were now in a new environment. The baron needed to rebuild his base here. After he obtained what he wanted, he would only care about Angele while the others, especially the ones with mediocre talent, wouldn\u2019t be cared for anymore. Also, the baron had lost his territory and source of income. Because of that, they could no longer live the life they used to have, a reasonable outlook for the people as they started becoming worried for their future.Angele sat in the carriage, thinking of ways to calm their unease. Suddenly, the carriages slowed down.\u201cAngele, get off the carriage,\u201d the baron yelled from outside. Angele was confused, but he still got off the carriage. He saw Aunt Maria and his father standing at the side, both looking excited.\u201cWhat happened, Father, Aunt Maria?\u201d Angele asked. The carriages stopped by the side while others who were in the carriages started unloading the supplies. Angele walked toward the two.\u201cYou father told me you want to enter the school. I think it\u2019s good for you, and your father supports this decision as well. You\u2019re lucky this time. Marua Harbor School is taking in new students. You can register as long as you reach the requirements,\u201d Maria said with a smiling face.\u201cMarua Harbor School?\u201d Angele had never heard of it before. He looked at his father.\u201cThat school has a long history, and teach nearly everything such as fighting skills, field experiences, music, literature, dancing, and painting. Also, they\u2019re qualified to recommend a number of students to the Andes Alliance School each year,\u201d the baron smiled as he walked close to Angele.\u201cIf you want to learn about the Alliance School and how to get admitted into it, this step is necessary!\u201d he whispered by Angele\u2019s ear.\u201cIt\u2019s going to expensive, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Angele asked.\u201c100 gold coins for the registration and additional expenses for the courses you want to enroll. However, it\u2019s nothing compared to all the things you can learn,\u201d the baron said.Angele felt slightly relieved because they looted the treasures of the bandits they had encountered along the way and also Count Philip\u2019s possessions. They obtained about 200 gold coins from the bandits and 1000 gold coins from Philip, so Angele was actually pretty rich at present.\u201cToday is the last day of registration. You\u2019ll surely be admitted if you go to the registration area now,\u201d Maria explained.\u201cYour father told me you want to go to Andes Alliance School. If you achieve good grades at the harbor school, you\u2019ll be recommended to the Alliance School after,\u201d she continued.\u201cAunt, please ask someone to lead me there. I\u2019ll go register now!\u201d Angele said.\u201cSir Siva is there working at the registration office. Not so long ago, his son wanted Bowater to do something for him. I\u2019ll let him know that I sent you there,\u201d Maria said after nodding her head. Bowater was her husband and also Angele\u2019s uncle. He was an officer at the harbor\u2019s inspector department.\u201cThank you, Aunt!\u201d Angele felt elated upon knowing this, thus politely giving her his sincere thanks.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s a boarding school. You\u2019ll need to bring your own things there such as your clothes,\u201d Maria said.\u201cGot it, I\u2019ll get on it right away,\u201d Angele said. Maria then asked a worker named Anderson to lead the way for Angele. Before leaving, the baron patted Angele\u2019s shoulder hard. He didn\u2019t say anything, but Angele could see the hope in his eyes. Maggie and Celia got off the carriage to wish Angele good luck. Angele kissed them in front of everyone to show that they were under his wing before leaving with Anderson.Angele felt he was caught in a hurry, but the opportunity was right there. He knew his body had long reached the limits and knew what he needed to accomplish in the school.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: School (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeBy the west of Marua City, there laid upon mountains of great numbers. Valleys that were naturally formed between these mountains made up a two-lane road network used in transportation. These white carriages\u2019 paths looked endless, ultimately leading into the forest after several twists and turns. It was a cloudy afternoon. Many carriages were traveling on the road; some entered the forest while some exited. Owners of different carriages being politely greeted by whom they were acquainted with was a common scene and courtesy along the way.An average-looking teenager with short brown hair was sitting in a white carriage, gazing at the carriages passing by. Many carriages had those luxurious insignias, yet Angele barely knew any of those. Clean, silky white shirt and a small gray linen coat; long blue pants and a pair of tight black boots were being worn by him. He looked just like any other noble child from the countryside and seemed as though he attempted to be fashionable yet knew nothing in that regard.A bald coachman wearing gray worker clothes made from linen was sitting by the teenager. These two were Angele and Anderson, respectively, who were heading to the registration office in the school. Anderson started explaining the situation in the harbor school as the carriage moved forward at a swift pace.\u201cYoung Master Angele, the madam asked me to tell you this. Please only take the necessary courses in school since the price of some courses might be too high for you at present\u2026\u201d Anderson didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but Angele knew what he meant.\u201cI understand. To get admitted into the harbor school, the only thing needed is money?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cNever heard of anyone getting rejected after paying enough. I think so,\u201d Anderson licked his lips and answered.Showing a tacit understanding of the situation, Angele nodded. The harbor school was most likely similar to those private schools on Earth where you need to pay a certain amount to get admitted. However, unlike on Earth, the quality of education in this world varied. For Angele, his sentiment was of needing not to waste time in the castle any longer, at least. He could actually learn something, and with the chip\u2019s assistance were many things that he could now do.\u201cAlso, the registration fee isn\u2019t very high. Even children of merchants are studying in it, too. Some people couldn\u2019t afford the fee, thus they chose to pay the students to teach them instead. It\u2019s a cheaper alternative and moreover, such things are common in the school. You can consider doing the same if you don\u2019t have enough money to spare,\u201d Anderson kindly said.\u201cThank you, I\u2019ll think about it,\u201d Angele smiled, no longer talking after. He was aware of the fact that just paying those students with money wouldn\u2019t be enough. He probably needed to be extremely polite to them while begging them for knowledge. This was something Angele wouldn\u2019t do. This would save him some money; however, he had the chip. He could do the things normal people couldn\u2019t.The carriage entered the deep forest in a short span. Ahead of them was a 10-meter wide, large iron door waiting at the end of the road. Beside the entrance were towering walls going straight toward the mountains endlessly. Outside the door was a vast empty ground where several small carriages were parked. Several typical and ostentatious carriages easily distinguishable with just the insignias on them were there. From time to time, people wearing luxurious clothes went out through the door and got into the carriages. Teenagers ranging from 12 to 16 years old and of differing statures got out of the carriages, most likely here to register as well. It seemed the school didn\u2019t have age restrictions.After parking the carriage, Angele followed after Anderson as they entered through the door. Just like any other students, Angele had the same spark of curiosity in him, proven by his actions as his eyes kept darting around. The first scene he witnessed was a grassy land and many white buildings that were about 5-6 floors tall. A stone path directed them toward one of the white buildings ahead.Besides the path, there were copper statues that each had words engraved on it. Angele looked at one of the statues and saw words engraved. It read, \u2018Count Albert Parrington donated 20000 gold coins to the school on Year 1307. Angele became speechless because he thought those statues were created for successful entities that had greatly contributed to the school\u2019s reputation. He checked several others wherein he saw that they had donated at least 10000 gold coins to the school. By then he had already stopped looking and instead followed Anderson to the first floor of the white building.A middle-aged man with a goatee was sitting in the middle of a hall that was decorated with glamorous furnishings as though there was a party. He was jotting down the names of students who came to register with a quill pen. Angele moved behind the 20 to 30 people who were lined up in front of him. Meanwhile, Anderson took the recommendation letter to Sir Siva, which caused people around Angele to have contemptuous looks and distance from him.It didn\u2019t take long for Anderson to bring a blonde curly-haired man to Angele. The man took Angele straight to a room at the side of the hall.Angele paid the fee in but a short moment and obtained the certification that would prove his identity. It was colored white and was made out of leather. Written on it were his student number, grade, room number, and his personal information. A red seal that represented the clearance of his payment had been stamped at the bottom of the paper. Anderson left right after he assisted Angele in the registration.Angele headed to a building to the left according to the explanation on the paper. This building was the dorm. Many rooms were still open, but the hallway was crowded with students walking to and fro, looking for their own rooms. It was a lively scene that reminded Angele of the post knights in the castle. Most of the students here were vastly different, of course, as they wore luxurious clothes. People here also talked in a slow and gentle manner, which made Angele think they were a bit phony.Also, Angele wasn\u2019t actually a noble here because he was from Rudin Empire, a dying country. His father had left his hometown and came to Andes because he decided to give up on his status there. Angele was a mere student now, yet Andes didn\u2019t set restrictions on the color of the clothes. He could still wear colorful clothes, even white clothes. On the contrary, he would\u2019ve been in deep trouble if he had done so back in Rudin.Each room could only fit one student because the school knew that noble children wouldn\u2019t like to share a room with others. The bedroom only had one bed, a desk, and a chair. Everything was made out of brown wood, and no paint was applied. Angele could smell the fragrance of wood in the air. He decided to settle down his possessions and change his clothes.\u201cNew schedule is out!\u201d A boy yelled outside the room.\u201cIt was just posted outside the 5th building. The price is 5 gold coins!\u201d he continued.\u201cWe need to pay at least 100 gold coins; otherwise, we won\u2019t get our money\u2019s worth!\u201d Another person said.\u201cThe price is set by Master Banner. If you have any question, go talk to him. I\u2019m merely a messenger,\u201d the boy said. By then, the students in the building were stirred, becoming noisy.DONG! DONG! DONG!Someone knocked on the door of Angele\u2019s room. He opened it right away. A black-haired boy wearing a red-yellow noble suit was standing outside.\u201cYou\u2019re new here? You heard the price?\u201d This black-haired boy who also had freckles all over his face asked. Angele nodded his head.\u201cGood, it\u2019s the price set by Master Banner. If you want to teach the poor students for money, that\u2019s the number of coins you can ask for. You must follow the rules, understood?\u201d he continued, and Angele nodded again.\u201cSure,\u201d Angele said. After all, he wasn\u2019t planning on earning money by doing this anyway.\u201cGood,\u201d the boy looked satisfied.\u201cNot bad for a newcomer. Remember to pay the fee stated on the back of the schedule,\u201d the boy said before leaving. Angele closed the door and thought of something. He took the paper and turned it over. The schedule was very long, each price was written beside each course. It was slightly blurry, probably not handwritten. Angele wouldn\u2019t have known of the schedule if it weren\u2019t for the boy who had informed him.The price and course were as follows:Music \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 20 gold coins.Drawing \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 20 gold coins.Dancing \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 20 gold coins.Equestrianism \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 20 gold coins.Free Combat Training \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 30 gold coins.History of The Alliance \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 10 gold coins.War Strategies \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 50 gold coins.Sword Skills \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 20 gold coins.Katana Skills \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 20 gold coins.Dual-wielding Heavy Weapon Skills \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 30 gold coins.Archery \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 50 gold coins.Language \u2013 2 classes, 1 hour in total. 20 gold coins.The total number of classes necessary was about 10. The time schedule of the classes would be decided before the start of the courses. Payments were mandatory to be paid on the same day.Angele scrunched his eyebrows. It would take him about 100 gold coins to finish one course. This was already costly to him. Though he brought only two high gold cards, it was still a lot. One high gold card could be exchanged with 1000 gold coins, which would be handed out by the school. Angele could convert it to gold coins whenever he wanted at the service department of the school.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Adolf (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeTwo thousand gold coins were already a lot to Angele since it could even completely fill a big, heavy bag. When he was still in the Rio Territory, he could buy plenty of things with that amount of money. But in Marua, he needed even more.\u2018Aunt Maria was right,\u2019 Angele thought. He read the course list once again. However, as he didn\u2019t find anything useful to him, he could only scrunch his eyebrows. Only the words at the bottom caught his attention:\u201cThe recommendation exam will be held by the end of September. Students who pass three of their courses will be qualified.\u201d\u201cPass three of them?\u201d Angele muttered while re-reading over the selections he had.\u201cI\u2019ll take sword skills, archery, and language then. I\u2019m good at those. The chip will help me get through the language course easily.\u201d Angele finally made his decision and put the sheet back into his pouch after.People outside the room were still noisy. Angele could hear some of them laughing as they talked. He donned his favorite black hunting suit and checked the things he had brought. Angele put them aside before leaving the room. There were many students around, each forming their own groups. They were either gossiping about certain teachers or about some well-known students. Some were merely talking about the new jewelry and clothes that had just been imported into the city.Angele walked across the hall, feeling alienated in the atmosphere around him.\u2018This place is so peaceful. I guess I\u2019ll need some time to get used to it. I fought too many battles back then at the plains.\u2019 Angele thought. He didn\u2019t plan on staying at this place for too long. After all, there was no point in interacting with the children of high-class nobles or merchants.Angele walked out of the dorm and looked at the schedule that was pinned on the wall by his side. He took a note of the locations and timetables of the courses he wanted. He then walked straight toward the study area at the back. He could see that all the school buildings were indeed white. Angele headed into the most crowded area \u2014 the dining hall. He saw white bread, wine, fish soups, and pan-fried mussels there. He quickly finished his lunch and returned back to his room to get some rest.The second morning, Angele woke up early. He changed his clothes and quickly finished washing his face and brushing his teeth. Many students hadn\u2019t woken up yet, which was the reason why the dorm was eerily quiet. Angele walked around the hall and saw several students coming from up ahead. They didn\u2019t wear luxurious suits, signifying that they most likely originated from small merchant families. It was likely that they were the most hardworking students in the school. Angele studied hard as well, but only a few nobles would try hard like him.Angele walked out of the dorm. It was still a bit dark and the area was empty. He could barely see any people. The morning breeze blowing over him was still chilly, and chirping of birds could be heard.\u2018My first class is Language, and it\u2019s taught by Master Adolf. Location is at Building 19 Room 304,\u2019 Angele stored the information in the chip earlier, so he quickly found the location after seeing the black mark on the building.It was a three-story building located at the rear end of the school. There were only five rooms on each floor. Outside the building was a board standing there. The words written on it were Rudin and two other languages Angele couldn\u2019t recognize. These words meant \u2018Language\u2019. These words were written in an art form, similar to that of Chinese calligraphy on Earth.The building was surrounded by wooden fences and between them was an empty ground. A young girl sitting by a red wooden desk that had a label \u2018Fee and Registration\u2019 was yawning. Angele looked around, only to find that he seemed to be the only one around.\u201cYou\u2019re here for the Language course?\u201d she asked while yawning. She who was dressed in red saw Angele standing outside the fences.\u201cYea, can I register now?\u201d Angele walked in and took out his high gold card.\u201cYep, you\u2019re a new student? You don\u2019t know me?\u201d she asked.\u201cI was just admitted yesterday,\u201d Angele nodded honestly. He handed over his card to her, and the girl wrote down his card number and personal information. She also wrote \u2018-20 gold coins\u2019 beside it before returning the card to Angele.\u201cHaven\u2019t seen formal students waking up so early in a while. I\u2019m the daughter of your language teacher, Adolf Runsol. You can call me Sophia. You can go inside now, my father is already in the room,\u201d the girl said as she looked at Angele.Angele couldn\u2019t find any chance to speak. It was likely that she didn\u2019t want to talk to him too much. He nodded and walked into the small building.The building was white, yet there was a hint of it being grayish. The stairs were located at the right-hand side of the building. By the end of the passage, there was a half-opened door with a label \u2018304\u2019 that indicated Room 304. Angele walked in and saw a white-haired old man reading a book. The old man heard the footsteps and looked over Angele\u2019s direction. He didn\u2019t say anything, only staring at Angele for a while.\u2018A scholar with a specific daily routine, I suppose,\u2019 Angele thought. He sat down in the front row, waiting for the course to begin. After half an hour, students started pouring in from outside, but they still looked drowsy. When there were about 13 students, the old man closed his book and stood up.\u201cI\u2019m Adolf, invited by the school to teach Language. You may or may not know about me, but let\u2019s just pretend we don\u2019t know each other. I\u2019ll earn some cash by teaching you while you kids pay to stay in this class. That\u2019s it. Any questions?\u201d the old man said, his tone serious and stubborn.\u201cWe know Master Adolf\u2019s rule. Please start the class,\u201d one of the girls sitting in the front row said. Her skin seemed a bit too pale white for a human being.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get started,\u201d Adolf went straight to the point, not wasting any time.\u201cI\u2019ll be teaching the universal language from one of Andes\u2019s neighbors, Polen Empire. I\u2019ll also be teaching the language of Holy Anmag Empire. Especially the second one, it\u2019s very useful and important. We use it in many different areas such as Marua, the capital, and many more cities,\u201d Adolf said.\u2018Zero, analyze all language-related information,\u2019 Angele ordered while looking at Adolf.\u2018Mission established. Analysis beginning\u2026\u2019 Zero said. There were only about 10 students there, but Adolf was treating his job seriously. He talked about the basic structure of the two languages and the history of their developments. He also taught about the basic components of the words. Angele felt as if the time in the two classes flowed very quickly.\u201cTwo days later, I have an applied course. To attend or not is your choice,\u201d Adolf said in a serious tone before leaving the room with books in his hand.After Language, Angele attended the sword skills and archery courses. The two courses had everything Angele expected. The content was way too easy for him, but it was a chance for him to practice. He attended a class once, but then realized there was no point for him to attend again. The teachings were less useful compared to the ones he had found in the castle. The skills they taught weren\u2019t practical. They looked cool, but it wouldn\u2019t help Angele survive in a real battle. The sword skills of his father and Knight Audis were much better than the ones taught here.\u2018Well, at least the teachers are knights. However, they\u2019re just average.\u2019 Angele knew knights were still elites here. They were ones that students couldn\u2019t meet all day. With the help of the chip, Angele found the strongest person in this school. He was dumbfounded because the strongest was a teacher who had about the level of a mid-knight. There were not even many post knights here. Barely any people had experiences in actual combat. Most students were akin to flowers in a greenhouse living happy lives. They liked funny stories, fashion, and beautiful sword dances, but they were not interested in participating in a real war.\u2018This is the place rich kids want. Pay for some certificates and make themselves look better. No wonder why money is the only thing I needed to get admitted here,\u2019 Angele concluded. In the next ten days, Angele didn\u2019t do anything other than studying, eating, and sleeping. He had already mastered the two languages Adolf had taught. It took 6 classes for him to achieve this, and it cost him 60 gold coins. He was well-behaved in class and could answer the questions asked by the teacher. Adolf thought he was pretty good and smart.\u201cThat\u2019s it for today. Come to my desk if you have any questions,\u201d Adolf said. Only 6 students were still inside the classroom. Angele was at the front row where he sat quietly. He was considered as the most hardworking student in the class. He raised his hand after hearing the words Adolf said.\u201cMaster, I got a question. I wonder if you could teach me some other language besides those two?\u201d Angele asked. He knew Adolf had mastered more than ten languages. He was, after all, the most renowned polyglot in Marua. People highly respected him in the academic world.\u201cOther languages? Angele, were the two I taught not enough for you?\u201d Adolf said while scrunching his eyebrows.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Angele was about to continue speaking, but several other students started asking questions. Adolf was instantly surrounded by several students. They just kept asking basic questions. Obviously, they were fawning on Adolf. Angele shook his head, only sitting there as he waited for them to finish.Adolf\u2019s patience was running out, but he finished conversing with the students nonetheless. He saw Angele still waiting inside the classroom.\u201cWhat else do you want to know, Angele?\u201d Adolf felt goodwill toward Angele, so he remembered his name.\u201cYou haven\u2019t mastered the two languages I taught, yet. Don\u2019t be greedy,\u201d he continued.\u201cMaster, may I ask what the language requirement is for the Andes Alliance School?\u201d Angele asked after he stood up.\u201cLanguage requirement? You want to get into the alliance school? What do you want to do there? That\u2019s just a place for people who are wealthier than most,\u201d Adolf said while staring at Angele.\u2018Warning! Warning! Target is using an unknown magnetic field to scan your mind.\u2019 Zero suddenly warned before Angele could answer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: Adolf (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u2018Unknown magnetic field?\u2019 Angele was both surprised and excited. He heard Adolf questioning him. He was feeling elated, but he tried to stay calm.\u201cMaster Adolf, I\u2019m just interested in the legendary power the Wizards have and I want to get into a better school. I think my research would progress faster,\u201d Angele quickly and honestly answered.\u201cWizard?\u201d Adolf stopped for a second and thought for a while.\u201cIt is\u2026 very nostalgic\u2026\u201d He sighed with a sad look on his face. Adolf looked at Angele for a while with a face as though he had mixed feelings about the situation. Angele was nearly becoming scared.\u201cI think you\u2019re honest because you\u2019re telling the truth. Follow me.\u201d Adolf broke the silence and slowly left the classroom. Angele followed him from behind. Outside the door, Adolf\u2019s daughter who was wearing a tight red one piece, Sophia, was looking at Angele with mixed feelings as well. She didn\u2019t say anything. It seemed that she didn\u2019t overhear their conversation.Adolf walked down the building with Angele and his daughter. Outside was a large red carriage that could easily fit three people awaiting them. The insignia looked like the Scales.\u201cGet on the carriage,\u201d Adolf said while pointing at it.\u201cYes, master.\u201d Angele politely got inside the carriage.Inside the carriage, Angele sat opposite to Adolf and Sophia. The coachman started driving the carriage, moving forward quickly. No one talked, but Angele noticed that Adolf was thinking about something. The carriage left the school and moved to the downtown area of Marua. They arrived at a block full of large houses and stopped in front of a red-white house. They had left the school at morning and by the time they had arrived, it was already noon.Adolf still didn\u2019t say anything as he led Angele and Sophia into the house. They went to the study on the second floor and while they did so, several workers greeted them.\u201cSit down.\u201d Adolf sat on a sofa by the desk. Angele looked around and saw two shelves full of books on the side. The book covers were all made of red leather and the words written on it were hard to read. It was highly likely that Master Adolf wrote it. On the desk was a golden oil lamp, a white quill pen, and a bottle of black ink. There was also a round silver seal above an opened letter.\u201cOny, bring this young guest of mine a glass of Marconi. Also, you know what Sophia and I want,\u201d Adolf loudly said. Sophia was sitting beside her father with a face that seemed unconcerned about Adolf\u2019s decision. A chubby middle-aged woman brought 3 glasses of drink to them and closed the door quietly.Angele smelled the fragrance of the drink in front of him. It looked like dark chocolate, yet it smelled like a lemon mixed with orange. It was nice and warm.\u201cTell me about your decision. I mean, why are you looking for the Wizards?\u201d Adolf asked.\u201cI think you know that the path to the Wizards\u2019 world is too difficult to find, and you need perseverance for it. You can\u2019t imagine the amount of effort you need,\u201d he continued in a deep tone.\u201cMaster Adolf, to be honest with you, my body isn\u2019t capable of accepting Life Energy Seed. There\u2019s no way for me to become a grand knight. However, I witnessed the power of a wizard, and I found it incredible. I want to find out if the wizards could help me get stronger in a different way,\u201d Angele unhesitatingly said. He had his own plans, so he decided to tell Adolf everything he knew. It wasn\u2019t, after all, a big secret in any case.\u201cYou witnessed the power of a wizard? There are still wizards around here?\u201d Adolf was taken aback and even Sophia was curiously looking at Angele.\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see a real wizard in front of me. I saw someone using an energy from a cracked enchanted item,\u201d Angele said.\u201cThat person must be a wizard then! Only a wizard is capable of wielding enchanted items,\u201d Adolf nodded.\u201cYou\u2019re very honest. However, the talent requirement in becoming a wizard is far greater than of a grand knight\u2019s. Are you sure you have such talent?\u201d Adolf asked.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know until I try,\u201d Angele smiled.\u201cI think I should at least try. If I don\u2019t, then I will never know if I\u2019m gifted or not,\u201d Angele said. He had successfully utilized the power of the ring, so he felt confident about it.\u201cVery good,\u201d Adolf started laughing.\u201cYou\u2019re just like me. When I was young, I never gave up,\u201d Adolf continued.\u201cWait, you\u2019re a\u2026\u201d Angele became excited.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not a wizard. I\u2019m just an ordinary person who admires them.\u201d Adolf sighed, then he became silent.\u201cSorry, I\u2019m tired. I need to take some rest. Come by here next time,\u201d Adolf said.\u201cThanks for inviting me here. I\u2019m leaving now.\u201d Angele still had something to say, but he decided to leave.\u201cSophia, see him off.\u201d Adolf stood up and grabbed a book from the shelf.\u201cIt\u2019s a book of Erathia\u2019s language. You can read it first. Come here tomorrow and I\u2019ll teach you the language privately. If I see any potential from you, I\u2019ll consider recommending you to the alliance school,\u201d Adolf said.\u201cThank you, Master Adolf!\u201d Angele was jubilant upon seeing Adolf handing the book to him.\u201cYea.\u201d Adolf waved his hands and ceased talking. Angele walked out of the study with Sophia and they went down the stairs. Angele got inside the carriage when they left the house.\u201cFather has expectations on you and he\u2019ll know if you\u2019re lying. I respect his decision, but I hope you don\u2019t disappoint him,\u201d Sophia said in a serious manner.\u201cI understand.\u201d Angele nodded politely.**************Half a year later\u2026Adolf\u2019s house.\u201cIf we can replace the word \u2018Kafka\u2019 with \u2018single wheel\u2019, it will be impossible when using the grammar of Anmag language,\u201d Adolf said while looking at a paper. He scrunched his eyebrows and pointed to the paper using his finger while making an encircling gesture around the word.\u201cAnd here, the word choice is poor. It should be replaced with the Rudin word \u2018ignite\u2019,\u201d he continued. Angele was sitting there quietly while listening to Adolf\u2019s advice. After the passing of half a year, the two became really close. Angele used the chip to help him study the languages and the results were great. He learned much faster than others. Actually, he had already mastered the first two languages in the first week, but he didn\u2019t want too much attention, so he spent half a year to make it look like he was just progressing fast. He had mastered three different languages in half a year wherein this made Adolf think he was a genius.Adolf was testing Angele\u2019s familiarity with different languages now, so he combined different languages into sentences to make sure that Angele understood each of them.\u201cYou\u2019re right. I didn\u2019t notice that.\u201d Angele said as he lowered his head. Actually, he made these mistakes on purpose.\u201cYou still need to improve, but\u2026 you passed the tests for the three languages.\u201d Adolf put down the paper before he smiled. Angele seemed relieved, but he already knew the results beforehand. Adolf carefully looked at Angele, and he even felt proud of him.\u201cAngele, you studied with me for more than half a year now?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes, Master,\u201d Angele said.\u201cI think you know who I really am?\u201d Adolf smiled.\u201cAs the assistant director of the security department, I did some research on you,\u201d he continued. Angele nodded, though he didn\u2019t say anything. He knew Adolf being an influential personage, but that wasn\u2019t his purpose. Adolf looked at Angele, unable to see even the slightest change in Angele\u2019s facial expression after hearing about his position. Adolf felt happy at the fact that his power and influence didn\u2019t affect how Angele treated him.\u201cWell, that\u2019s not important anyway. You and I have a larger target,\u201d Adolf said.Angele knew that Adolf was about to show him something, which was exactly the opportunity he was looking for. Adolf stood up and handed him a book. Angele took the book and looked at its title, \u201cJourney of Heart by Buckwill Henry\u201d.\u201cMaster, what is this?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cThis is the biography of the great thinker, Master Buckwill Henry,\u201d Adolf said, and he smiled. He liked Angele because the latter had mastered three different languages within half a year. Adolf thought that Angele was gifted. Therefore, he thought that he must put great effort in studying languages.\u201cBut no one knew that not only was Master Buckwill a great thinker, he was also a mysterious person,\u201d he continued.\u201cHe\u2019s a wizard?\u201d Angele guessed. The thought of it got him excited.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Take it back and read it. Let me know if you have any questions.\u201d Adolf nodded with a satisfied look on his face.\u201cThank you, Master!\u201d Angele said. He knew that he was going to learn something of significance from the book.\u201cPeople from Andes Alliance School will come to recruit after half a month. Prepare for it,\u201d Adolf said.\u201cYes. Now if you would excuse me.\u201d Angele stood up, holding the book in his hands. He knew Adolf wouldn\u2019t give him any meaningless thing, but he didn\u2019t expect being given a book written by a real wizard.\u201cI\u2019m too old for this now. It\u2019s your time to shine.\u201d Adolf nodded while laughing.\u201cYes, Master!\u201d Angele nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: Book of the Wizard (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele left the house with the book Adolf gave him and got on a carriage that took him back to the school. A staff member by the entrance of the dorm stopped Angele before he entered the building.\u201cYoung Master Angele, here\u2019s a letter for you. Also, a worker left something here for you. Please take all of those with you,\u201d the staff member who looked drunk said. The staff member was a middle-aged man who was a heavy drinker. Angele could barely understand what the man was saying.\u201cThanks, House.\u201d Angele smiled as he nodded. He headed into a small room by the entrance and took a black bag along with a letter.Angele quickly returned to his room and carefully closed the door. Angele put down the bag and letter. He sat in front of his desk and placed the book he had just gotten on it. He inhaled once and tried to calm himself before he\u2019d start checking the book. Brown was the color of its cover and an earmark was sealed on it. This mark was quite large and was made out of black silk. There was a small line of words written on the bottom-right side that said, \u201cBy Buckwill\u201d. The book was thick and heavy, such that it even looked like a large dictionary. It was about 2 to 3 kilograms. Angele collected himself and sat straight before opening the book.\u2018Zero, start recording the information,\u2019 he thought.\u2018Recording started.\u2019 The chip started working quickly.There was only one line on the first page: \u201cI am listening\u2026\u201dThe words were written in a special manner, which made it slightly hard to read. They looked like special runes, but they were actually just regular Anmag words. It looked like the page had a bunch of tadpoles lined up in the middle. Angele stared at those words and started thinking. He scrunched his eyebrows, remaining at this page for a long time. Dusk was nearly upon him and darkness had begun creeping everywhere. Moonlight poured into the room, dyeing and reflecting light upon everything inside with its pale white hue. The oil lamp on the desk reflected yellow light over Angele\u2019s face. Shadows under his eyes and nose began flickering.Angele finally moved to page 2 after thinking for a long time, but he still scrunched his eyebrows. There was a colorful painting on the second page. It was a noble lady wearing a white one piece and a red round hat. She was sitting in front of a mirror quietly with a gentle demeanor. Her face was fair and beautiful, and it looked like she was staring into Angele\u2019s eyes. The painting itself was vibrant and it made it seem as if the lady was alive. Angele felt something strange about it, so he moved the book closer. He scrutinized the painting such that he could even see the pores on her face.The wind was blowing into the room from outside.DONG! The window made a loud noise as it was blown open. Angele stood up and closed it. He returned and sat down again, looking at the painting. He was surprised because the mouth of the lady in the painting was now slightly opened. He was certain that it was closed before. She stared at Angele, seemingly trying to say something.\u201cI am listening\u2026\u201d Angele was suddenly reminded of the words on page 1 and felt slightly scared. The room was silent and people who were talking outside couldn\u2019t be heard. Even the insects outside had gone silent. The atmosphere in the room felt heavy and constrained.Angele felt goosebumps and instantly put his right hand over the crossguard sword by the side. He sensed danger and thought something was closing in on him.\u2018Zero, analyze the situation around. Report to me immediately if you find anything wrong,\u2019 Angele ordered.\u2018Mission established. Analyzing\u2026\u2019 Zero reported. However, the chip didn\u2019t report back to him, so Angele felt relieved. He looked back at the painting, once again becoming surprised. The lady\u2019s mouth was slightly more opened compared before as though she was in pain. She now had a hopeless expression on her face, not staring at Angele anymore. Angele couldn\u2019t see anything in her eyes. Angele felt more goosebumps and also a chill coming from his back.He quickly moved on to the next page.\u201cI am listening\u2026\u201d He saw the words again where it was still in the middle of the page.\u2018Warning! Strange magnetic field discovered! Please move away from the source! At least 50 meters!\u2019 Suddenly, the chip started giving out warnings.\u2018You will see a different world from this book if you are qualified to become a Wizard.\u2019 A strange message somehow appeared in Angele\u2019s mind. It wasn\u2019t written in the book, only going straight into Angele\u2019s consciousness.Angele was paralyzed; sweat was all over his face.GA!A black bird that looked like a crow flew by his window and made a strange noise. Angele was still feeling shocked, but he was alerted by the sound. He quickly stood up and wiped off the sweat on his face with his hands. Angele saw his own reflection on the glass of the window. His reflection had white pupils and the mouth was opened as though his reflection was trying to say something. The facial expression of his reflection perfectly depicted that of the lady in the painting.\u201cDamn!\u201d Angele screamed as he pushed the chair down. He bumped the door open and ran out to the hallway. The whole world outside looked strange. Angele felt the loss of balance, and the hallway itself seemed distorted. No one was around, not even any student in the dorm could be seen.\u2018Your body is currently experiencing an abnormal condition. Your blood flow rate is 3x greater than normal, and your blood vessels are rupturing,\u2019 Zero kept warning.HU!Angele inhaled once, trying to suck air into his lungs. The warning of the chip woke him up. Angele opened his eyes where he found himself sleeping on the book. The window was still open, the wind coming from outside could still be felt by him. Angele was covered in sweat, and he found the wind to be soothing.\u201cI fell asleep?\u201d Angele said as he looked at the book below his chest. He was still on page 1 of the book, the words still quietly lying in the middle of the page.I am listening\u2026\u201cEverything was an illusion?\u201d Angele wondered, so he decided to check the record on the chip.\u2018Your body is currently experiencing an abnormal condition. Your blood flow rate is 3x greater than normal, and your blood vessels are rupturing.\u2018Magnetic field has weakened. You are now waking up.\u2018Radiation energy has disappeared. Magnetic field has disappeared.\u2018You are having trouble understanding space and time.\u2019\u201cNope, not a dream,\u201d Angele said.Angele looked at the crystal clock he had bought not too long ago and seen that it was already 9 o\u2019clock in the evening. The words on the book suddenly disappeared and words suddenly appeared in the air. They were blurry in the beginning, but now, Angele could easily read them.\u2018Congratulations, love. You passed the mental examination of the book,\u2019 it said. The book suddenly started shining with a light akin to a silver water flowing around. Angele could barely see anything from the brightness. The light stayed for about 5 seconds before disappearing.Angele opened his eyes once again and looked at the book on his desk. The cover of the book change, though the color did not. Many strange runes appeared in the middle of the cover and the earmark was no longer there. Under the runes was a black door shaking slightly. Angele could even hear the noise it created; it felt like watching a 3D movie on Earth.The color of the cover was still brown, but the material seemed to have changed. Angele had mixed feelings about this and was hesitant. The illusion he had experienced warned him on how dangerous the book was. However, the book was the only clue he had about the Wizards, so he didn\u2019t want to give it up. Angele could now hear the noises of people talking and doors opening and closing from the hallway. He slowly calmed down as he sought solace in such an environment. It was the dorm he was familiar with.\u2018Zero, check the book and tell me if it\u2019s still dangerous,\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Analysis beginning\u2026 Item unknown. Danger unknown. Please proceed with caution.\u2019 Hearing Zero\u2019s report made Angele hesitate again. He turned the book to its second page. Nothing happened, but the painting of the lady had disappeared. Instead, Angele saw a page full of words. There was a title on top of the page, which told Angele of what the book actually was.\u2018This is just a starter meditation handbook.\u2019Following the title, it said:\u2018This book will help you lay the foundation. If you want more, head to Marilodan. I heard that the market there would open every 50 years. I just don\u2019t want to write down high-level skills in this one as I\u2019m still researching. For your own safety, I suggest you do not attempt to touch the high-level meditation handbooks.\u2019The words were written in Anmag language, which made it surprisingly easy for Angele to understand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Book of the Wizard (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele became relieved as he calmed down. It seemed that he had survived the dangerous part of the book. Zero had also stopped giving out warnings. Angele read the next several lines where it all referred to the method how the meditation worked. The actual method was nearly identical to the one being used for training Qi back on Earth. However, the meditation in this world needed some special objects to support the process. It was also mentioned that before reaching the Wizard level, there were three different stages.The stages were labeled using simple numbers: stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3. According to the book, the Wizardry practices were all about accuracy even when the targets could only be vaguely explained. All wizards were great scholars and their accuracy in evaluation could help them determine the stage they were at. Wizards were serious on their research endeavors that they would attempt to make everything proper and stable, including the book Angele had.The author listed possible encounters during each stage and possible misunderstandings that might happen in the information on the book. Also, it had even a list of the possible reactions of people of differing mental states after reading the book. Every word in the book was helpful, not a single space was wasted. Angele spent about half an hour storing all the information on the chip in order for it to help him focus on the information he needed.\u2018Analyze and find the information I need.\u2019 Angele ordered as Zero started working on it right away.\u201992.15% of unnecessary information was removed. Start transferring the rest?\u2019 Zero asked.\u2018Yes,\u2019 Angele thought. He sat in front of the desk and closed his eyes. His temples were slowly throbbing like a beating heart; it looked very strange. The words on the book started evanescing like an ink dropped into a vast expanse of clean water. It continued to evanesce on the paper until nothing was left. It took about 10 seconds to wipe out everything on the book. Lines of words started appearing on the pages again. Everything was written in Anmag language, and the content had been changed into the biography of the scholar named Buckwill.\u2018So this is meditation. I can sense special elements in nature and I can approach them myself. Those special elements could bring people different sensations. People who could feel them and even lead them must be gifted. The number of elements they could feel and the speed of being able to adapt to them determined how gifted people were. That was\u2026\u2019 Angele opened his eyes after a while and thought. He shook his head from being unable to find a proper word to describe it. However, he obtained the method of meditation, a chance he had to grasp.Angele found the part pertaining as to how to start basic meditation. It said that there was one necessary supporting medicine called Dead Soul Grass. This plant grew upon graves and was something too difficult to find. It looked like a four-leaf clover, but it had a black color instead of green. Angele needed the leaves of the grass and put one into his mouth before initiating the meditation. Without the leaves, one couldn\u2019t sense the special elements even if it were the most gifted ones.\u201cThe Dead Soul Grass?\u201d Angele muttered. He closed the book and began thinking.The book was now useless to Angele, so he placed it back inside the bag. Without the grass, he wouldn\u2019t be able to start the meditation. It seemed that there wasn\u2019t much that he could do for now. Angele checked the time; it was already 3 o\u2019clock in the morning. He never thought that it was already this late, so he took the black bag he got earlier from the bed. It was from his father, and there was a letter. Angele opened it and saw that it was pretty much about the recent situation of his family.During the past half-year, the baron had bought a small manor outside the city with the assistance of Maria. However, he wasn\u2019t a \u2018baron\u2019 anymore due to the situation in Rudin Empire. His territory was gone, and there was no more income being generated there. The baron had funded a mercenary corporation with the guards that he had brought here. They took orders from the mercenary guild, harbor guild, and the governor\u2019s office. They were actually doing well and were even famous among the mercenary groups. The baron still had the skills of a mid-level knight. As a knight, he would be welcomed in any lord\u2019s territory and get a decent amount of territory. The baron was at the mid-level and could easily help post knights to obtain Life Energy Seeds. More post knights meant greater strength for a territory, so all the lords would appreciate that.However, when a knight helped others get Life Energy Seeds, he would lose a small amount of stamina himself. The children would get higher base stamina if the one helping them was at a higher level. It was possible for the post knights to have similar attributes as a real knight, so the lords wanted as many knights as possible in their territories. The baron\u2019s pride didn\u2019t allow him to serve others, so he decided not to join under anyone\u2019s wing. Instead, he had funded a mercenary corporation to take orders such that he even made a decent amount of money with it. It was nearly the same to the income he had been earning back in the castle. The baron had mentioned the recent changes in the manor and also the new mission he had gotten. He would be escorting an influential character to the Anser Plain along with more than ten other mercenary groups. Only one of the groups was weaker than the baron\u2019s, while the rest was as strong as they were. The baron said they might encounter mounted bandits from Saladin Empire during this mission, so the governor was paying them with a considerable amount.The situations of Maggie and Celia were also mentioned in the letter. It was said that Celia was showing her talent in music, so the baron sent her to a good teacher to learn. There was nothing wrong with learning more anyway. However, Maggie showed absolutely no talent in the different fields that she had tried. If it were not for her having an intimate relationship with Angele, the baron would\u2019ve just treated her like a normal worker. The only reason why she was living a decent life was due to Angele.The rest of the letter was just greetings from his aunt and uncle. As he reached the end, written on the last line was: \u2018To my dearest son, Angele. 1541. 12. 11. 2 am\u2019. The letter had been written last night. After Angele finished reading it, he returned it inside his pouch. He thought of how time quickly flew past by. It had now been three years since he reincarnated into this body. Angele opened the black bag and saw some daily necessities, some white blankets, some papers, new ink bottles, pens, and also a dagger with a brown leather sheath. With a small black diamond-like gem embedded into the handle, it looked strangely beautiful.Angele didn\u2019t spend too much money, so he still had more than 800 gold coins. He became renowned in the school due to his close relationship with Master Adolf such that it caused many students to pay for his tutoring services in Language. He charged students about 100 gold coins each time, which was enough for him to pay for the classes. He spent most of his money on other objects, such as strange trinkets from the market. The crystal clock on his desk was one of the strange trinkets he had bought. Marua Harbor was, after all, the largest harbor by the country\u2019s border, so countless merchants parked their ships here. They brought various goods to the city that you could buy anything you want, even slaves. As long as you had enough money, that is.Angele played with the dagger that was a trophy the baron received from a mission for a while. He sent it to Angele as a birthday gift. Angele sometimes returned to the manor to meet with his father and some other people, but he only stayed for a brief duration. Most of his time was spent in the school and in Adolf\u2019s residence. He studied in school and practiced his skills whenever he had a spare time. Life there was definitely not fun, but at least, he didn\u2019t waste any time.His attributes didn\u2019t increase during the half-year that had passed, everything staying the same. Angele still was a mid-level knight. He would\u2019ve been weaker if he didn\u2019t have all the strong sword skills. His skill in archery had also improved a lot, gaining the capability of simultaneously firing two arrows without losing accuracy. At school, most of the students weren\u2019t interested in fighting skills such as archery and horse riding. They only used those skills to show off during classes. No one would even practice after. The training ground was always nearly empty, and only the poor students sometimes trained there. Though, most of their time was spent on working, so they could pay for the fees in school. Barely anyone was like Angele, who went to the training ground every single day to train his fighting skills using the free weapons the school provided. After the countless of times Angele trained, he improved his sword skills again. Even his skill in archery was getting better as well.Angele put back everything and went to wash his face and brush his teeth. He put out the oil lamp and lied down on his bed. According to the information on the book, the Dead Soul Grass was considerably rare and would only grow in a graveyard with a lot of graves. Angele was thinking of the things needed to be done tomorrow as he slowly fell into slumber shortly after.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Dead Soul Grass (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAt the second day, Angele was asleep until it was 10 o\u2019clock in the morning. He stayed up too late last night, so it took him 7 hours to recover. Angele finished his breakfast quickly. He greeted the guard at the entrance when he was writing his leave notice. He then hired a coachman and traveled to Red Rock Hill Graveyard.It was already afternoon when Angele arrived at his destination. The sunlight made everything look as if it was dyed in red that even the clouds passing over him had a golden orange hue. The hill was outside the vicinity of Marua City. A huge sloping ground was made atop it. Many graves were on the ground surrounded by thriving trees. If you looked at the hill from a far side, the entirety of the graveyard would be on a slope.There were many people visiting the graveyard right now, and one of them was a young man from a noble family. He was looking through the grass around the graveyard instead of the tombstones, sometimes walking from one stone to another as though he didn\u2019t come to mourn. Following him around was a middle-aged man who seemed to be his coachman.\u201cMaster Angele, it\u2019s pretty late. Shall we head back?\u201d the coachman spoke with a light voice. For about two hours, he had been following him around. Angele paid him two gold coins, equivalent to the amount he would get for transporting 20 people. The coachman knew that Angele paid him quite well, but it was taking way too long.\u201cGetting dark already?\u201d Angele finally noticed the situation. With scrunched eyebrows, he took one final look around only to feel disappointed.\u201cFine, let\u2019s head back,\u201d Angele said. They started walking back to the entrance of the graveyard.\u201cDo you know how Rudin Empire is holding up? Is Saladin Empire still invading?\u201d Angele threw out several random questions.\u201cIn a tavern, I met several people who escaped from Rudin Empire. They said the only city left intact was the capital. Other places were pretty much conquered by neighboring countries. There aren\u2019t too many Saladins here, so I\u2019m not quite sure what events had unfolded. I\u2019m just a low-class coachman anyway. People like me have no right to ask such questions,\u201d the coachman said before laughing.\u201cYea, but I think many Rudins have come to the harbor? Any big name you\u2019ve heard of?\u201d Angele asked. He knew coachmen were a great source of information as they dealt and talked a lot with their customers. The coachman didn\u2019t answer, only keeping a smile on his face. Angele took out a gold coin and threw it to the man.\u201cWell, I might have the information you need actually. I\u2019ve heard two passengers saying that there weren\u2019t many people from Rudin Empire. Most of them were small noble families. The larger ones were hindered by the Saladins along their way, and the royal members were attacked by forces of several different countries. I can\u2019t even imagine\u2026\u201d The coachman grabbed the coin, and he said.\u201cYea?\u201d Angele nodded. It seemed that Marquis Syrias didn\u2019t make it. However, he wasn\u2019t going to completely trust the coachman because the source itself was suspicious. If it was true, he wouldn\u2019t need to worry about Philip anymore.\u201cWait, ever heard of the Dead Soul Grass?\u201d Suddenly, Angele asked as he took out several more gold coins.\u201cDead Soul Grass? Could you describe its appearance? I might have seen it somewhere before, but with a different name.\u201d The coachman looked at the coins with a greedy expression such that Angele could see it clearly.\u201cIt looks similar to a clover, but it has a black color,\u201d Angele said.\u201cA clover that is black? Do you mean Black Clovers? It only grows upon graveyards. You\u2019re here for those things?\u201d the coachman said.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint you, but I\u2019ve only heard of it being sold in pharmacies. It\u2019s very expensive. I\u2019m afraid you wouldn\u2019t find any at this place since people wouldn\u2019t leave something so valuable on the ground,\u201d he continued.\u201cPharmacy?\u201d Angele nodded, \u201cDrive me there.\u201d Angele threw another two gold coins to the coachman who happily grabbed them.\u201cNo problem,\u201d the coachman said.\u201cAs fast as you can,\u201d Angele said.\u201cWe\u2019ll be there in half an hour!\u201d The coachman laughed.About 20 minutes later, Angele arrived at a pharmacy by the harbor. Around the place was bustling with noises from carriages and people minding their own matters. A banner with words written in Rudin language was placed outside of the pharmacy that said: Mass\u2019s Small Pharmacy. There were some herbs drawn on the side.The pharmacy was located between two other stores on the first floor of a white building, its appearance furnished with simplicity. Many people dressed up in some strange suits were walking in and out of the pharmacy. All of them were different people of different statures. The pharmacy looked popular as it was recommended by the coachman, saying that the price here was fair.Angele had his black-red noble hunting suit worn, which made him stick out in the midst of people like a sore thumb. People would glance at him for a second before entering the store. Angele stood outside for a while before entering. The owner was handing herbs over to two mercenaries that looked like a couple. The owner was a kind-looking old man with white beard on his chin. Angele knew that the old was an experienced pharmacist with just the initial impression. Several clerks were handling customers by the side, and one of them walked to Angele after he entered the store.\u201cWelcome, Young Master. Not feeling well? What do you need?\u201d The young man had his business smile on.\u201cI want some Black Clovers. You have them here?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cBlack Clovers? You must be jesting. They\u2019re so rare that even the largest pharmacy in the city doesn\u2019t have them in stock,\u201d the young man answered.\u201cReally?\u201d Angele asked with scrunched eyebrows.\u201cYes, one Black Clover would cost you thousands of gold coins. It isn\u2019t something you see every day. People only auction them, and some of them are in the hands of some collectors. This herb has been restricted by the alliance more than ten years ago. Low-class citizens would be hanged just for purchasing it.\u201d The young man nodded as he said with a serious tone.\u201cYea?\u201d Angele felt a bit speechless. He was only at the 1st Stage, but he\u2019s already having difficulties. He didn\u2019t know what to expect after. He couldn\u2019t afford even just a single Black Clover as it would cost thousands of gold coins. It was already dark outside when Angele left the store. He asked the coachman to get him to Master Adolf\u2019s house.The only thing he could do now was to seek help from the Master because Adolf was the one who had given the book to him, thus he must know something about it. The Dead Soul Grass, or Black Clover, wasn\u2019t something Angele would be able to obtain at present. Judging by the bell at the harbor, it was already 7 o\u2019clock in the evening when Angele arrived at the house. The street lights by the roadside were already lit.Angele got off the carriage and saw Sophia watering the garden. Four oil lamps hung around the entrance of the house. The visibility for a normal person was low, but Angele could see things clearly.\u201cAngele, you\u2019re early today.\u201d Sophia looked surprised when she saw Angele arriving, but it seemed as though she had already expected this.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Father\u2019s inside the study on the second floor.\u201d Sophia opened the entrance for Angele as she said. Angele nodded, going straight into the house. He need not Sophia to lead the way because he was already completely familiar with the place.Angele lightly knocked on the door.\u201cCome in, it\u2019s open,\u201d Adolf said with a deep tone. Angele carefully opened the door and saw Adolf lying down on a reclined chair made of bamboo. He was wearing a white robe and had a book placed on his stomach.\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Adolf said. Angele bowed before sitting on a sofa by the side.\u201cMaster, it looks like you already know I would come to seek help?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYou didn\u2019t disappoint me. Did the book scare you?\u201d Adolf opened his eyes and smiled.\u201cIt actually caught me off guard.\u201d Angele stopped for a second before laughing.\u201cIt means you have the potential to become a wizard if you can see its true form. I have lent the book to many young students, but you\u2019re the only one who passed the challenge. You would indeed come to me the next day if you know what you\u2019re looking for. People don\u2019t usually finish the book in such a short duration if they were to read it as a normal biography.\u201d Adolf laughed as he said this.\u201cYou know I passed the trial?\u201d Angele was still wondering.\u201cYou just went to the Red Rock Hill Graveyard, am I right?\u201d Adolf laughed.\u201cI\u2019m not just a mere scholar in Marua,\u201d he continued.Angele felt relived. It seemed that his master knew everything about him.\u201cMaster, please tell me how I can get my hands on the Dead Soul Grass, or Black Clover. I heard that it\u2019s quite difficult to find,\u201d Angele said.\u201cI obtained one several years ago. You can use it,\u201d Adolf said while smiling.\u201cWell, how can I pay for it then?\u201d Angele calmly asked. Though Adolf liked him a lot, it was still something of great value. Angele didn\u2019t expect to get it for free.\u201cI\u2019m not expecting you to pay me anything right now. Though thousands of gold coins are not a small amount, I can still afford it. You have the potential to become one of the greatest, so I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d Adolf stopped smiling as he spoke in a serious tone.\u201cMarry, get Sophia in my room,\u201d Adolf yelled toward the door. Within a few minutes, Sophia walked in without any idea of what was going on. She looked at Angele and Adolf before closing the door carefully.\u201cAngele, you think she\u2019s attractive?\u201d Adolf asked.Sophia, who had a pretty face, was just about 20 years of age. She wore a red one piece and had her hazelnut, curly hair over her shoulders; her arms and neck along with her well-proportioned body were attractive to one\u2019s eyes. Angele looked at Sophia without saying anything. When Angele first saw her, he already knew she was kind and clever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Dead Soul Grass (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cShe\u2019s indeed beautiful and\u2026 very attractive.\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d Adolf laughed.\u201cWait, Father! You can\u2019t be serious!\u201d Sophia stopped her father from continuing.\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t like him?\u201d Adolf stopped smiling and instead had a serious expression on his face.\u201cAngele is nice, but he\u2019s just not my type. Father, please let me at least make my own decisions.\u201d Sophia seemed adamant on this, so she insisted.\u201cYour type? You mean that bard from Westwind? The only thing he has is a pretty face!\u201d Adolf spoke in a reprimanding tone, but Sophia kept looking at him, showing how serious she was about this.\u201cSince Sophia already has someone in her mind, how about just letting me treat you like my own father?\u201d Angele quickly stood up and interrupted their conversation. Adolf still looked angry, but he stopped glaring at his own daughter.\u201cWell then\u2026 I\u2019ll just treat you like my own son,\u201d Adolf said. It looked like he now felt slightly better.\u201cMaster, my father and aunt could use some help sometimes. Would you mind?\u201d Angele said, trying to ease the anger of Adolf and make him feel comfortable. If he asked Adolf to help his family, Adolf would know someday that Angele would repay him well. Adolf looked much better after hearing the request.\u201cGet out of here, you\u2019re making me mad,\u201d Adolf yelled as he turned to his daughter. Sophia didn\u2019t say anything, only slamming the door close. Angele could hear her going down the stairs furiously.\u201cI\u2019ll keep an eye out for your father, and if he needs any help, I\u2019ll try my best. I think that will help deepen our relationship,\u201d Adolf said as he began smiling again. He stood up and opened the drawer on the desk. Adolf then took out a tiny, well-decorated box. There was a ruby embedded in the black box. Angele thought the box alone would nearly be as valuable as the grass.\u201cThis box is made of Agilawood. It prevents the herb from losing its efficacy. I\u2019m giving this to you as well.\u201d Adolf smiled, not caring whether Angele was his son or not. If Angele\u2019s family was in his reach, Angele wouldn\u2019t do anything stupid. Even if Angele gave up his whole family, the only thing Adolf would waste was time and money.Adolf had wanted to make Sophia marry Angele since the union in matrimony would help them develop a close relationship, but his daughter was just unhappy with the decision. Adolf loved his daughter quite dearly, so he didn\u2019t want to disappoint her too much. He was just faking his anger to make sure that Angele understood the situation.\u201cI\u2019m still just a low-level wizard apprentice. It\u2019s probably too late for me to pursue my own dream. However, I found you, Angele. I hope you will walk a bit further on this path.\u201d Angele handed over the box to Angele before he seriously said this.\u201cI\u2019ll try my best,\u201d Angele said after accepting the box.Both of them knew it was an investment. Adolf was betting on Angele, thinking that he had a huge potential. Even if Angele were to die during the process, Adolf would just stop giving help to the former\u2019s family. However, if Angele were to succeed, he would never forget Adolf who had greatly helped him. It was a chance Adolf had to take.Angele held the box that was the size of a fist in his hand. He carefully opened it, and lying inside it was a Black Clover. It looked exactly as the book described, and Angele could even see its roots. Angele closed the box, unable to wait in beginning the formal meditation.\u201cWait, is there something important hanging around your neck?\u201d Adolf suddenly asked, his sight falling on Angele\u2019s neck.\u201cCan\u2019t hide anything under your eyes, eh?\u201d Angele smiled. He wasn\u2019t trying to hide it anyway. They had the same goal right now, which was to help Angele become a wizard, but Angele was afraid of laying bare everything he had to Adolf. He took the emerald ring carefully and handed it over to Adolf. The latter rubbed the ring several times, beginning to scrutinize it.\u201cThe energy in this enchanted ring is gone, and the emerald is already cracked. It comes from\u2026 Ramsoda College? I\u2019ve never heard of it. An ancient wizard organization, perhaps? This ring is going to help you get on the ship. With this, you\u2019ll be taken into consideration by whichever this wizard organization is. Lucky guy.\u201d Adolf laughed, looking quite jubilant.\u201cI think the luckiest thing that happened to me was meeting you, Master.\u201d Angele politely said, both of them laughing for a while.\u201cWait, which ship are we talking about?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cHalf a month later, there will be a boat coming by. It will be full of wizard apprentices. Our harbor has been given the chance to recommend several students to them, so I can recommend one too. The boat will take you to the place where numerous wizard organizations are established. If you get into one of them, you will obtain the chance to read the books about the higher stages. It\u2019s a chance for you. I was planning on begging someone I knew, but I didn\u2019t know you have an enchanted ring. It\u2019ll save me much time and money,\u201d Adolf said.\u201cSounds like those organizations are far away from here?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYea, you will be traveling for a while. The ship will only take you to another land, and then you need to travel for another two months. However, this is a chance you cannot pass if you want to become a wizard,\u201d Adolf said with a deep tone.\u201cI understand. I\u2019ll talk to my family and finish other matters before I leave,\u201d Angele said as he nodded.\u201cGood.\u201d Adolf smiled. \u201cIf you want to become a great person, you must keep going forward. You\u2019ll be staying there for a very long time. Spend more time with you family before you go,\u201d he continued.\u201cAlso, there will be about 100 other people from our harbor on the boat. There are also some things I must let you know before you go. I\u2019ll inform you of those later,\u201d Adolf added.\u201cAlright, I got it. Thank you, Master.\u201d Angele nodded.It was already 10 o\u2019clock in the evening when Angele left Adolf\u2019s house. He hired a carriage and returned straight to the school. It was still early, but he wanted to try meditating. Angele rushed back to his room after getting off the carriage, instantly closing the door. He double-checked if he locked the door and the window before taking out the box which contained Black Clover inside it. He went to wash and took off his boots and socks. He sat on the bed and began preparing for the meditation as the book had said.He crossed his legs and opened the small box. He took out the clover and grabbed one of its black leaves. Angele put the leaf that tasted very bitter inside his mouth. Angele couldn\u2019t help but scrunch his eyebrows because it stank. He put the rest back inside the box and put it on the side. He finally started following the steps mentioned in the book, constantly imagining the runes in his mind. Those runes were called the \u2018Runes of Will\u2019 as recorded in the book.Ordinary human beings could keep 3 to 7 runes in their mind, while the gifted ones could keep 8 to 12. People could train their mentality by imagining those runes constantly. When a person reached the 1st stage, he would gain the ability to sense various types of energy in the space. He would be capable of discovering the energy he should be focusing on by separating the one he could sense the most from the other energies. The number of runes one could keep in their mind determined which stage one was at.Angele remained on his bed with his eyes closed. He could feel the passing of time, the noise outside subsiding as the students went to their beds. It was already 2 o\u2019clock in the morning. Angele\u2019s eyes suddenly started shining with a green light. His eyelids were shaking as though he was currently having a nightmare. His eyes shone for about half an hour with Angele\u2019s face slowly becoming gray-colored. Another half an hour later, Angele\u2019s face turned black, even having an awful stench on him.Angele started sweating black fluid. It was very sticky, and his clothes were soaked wet by this. Suddenly, Angele opened his eyes and spat out a considerable amount of black blood onto the ground. The blood stank, but Angele\u2019s face had an expression of relief after discharging everything.\u201cThe combination of Black Clover and meditation somehow increased my attributes. I can feel it. After spitting out all those blood, I felt very comfortable,\u201d Angele said. He was clearly in good spirits and not even tired at all. The clover had already dissolved in his mouth, most likely flowing into his blood vessels.\u2018Zero, did you record my brain activity?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Everything was recorded and stored in the database,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Show me my body condition,\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Angele Rio: Strength 2.9. Agility 4.1. Stamina 2.8. Status: Healthy. Genetic limit reached,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018My stamina has increased by 0.3!\u2019 Angele was simultaneously flabbergasted and exultant. His stamina was formerly 2.5 when he checked several days ago. Meditating caused it to increase it by 0.3, a huge amount to consider. He had already reached his gene limit some time ago, yet the meditation was changing his body on a genetic level.\u2018I can\u2019t believe wizards developed such a training method!\u2019 Angele was absolutely elated, even feeling more expectant from it. He thought that not only was he training but was also evolving. Angele felt curious about the things he could do in the future.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Departure (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter meditating, Angele changed his clothes and opened the window to let the air circulate. Whatever that was left on his body didn\u2019t smell pleasant. He grabbed his blanket and opened the door. There was no light in the hallway, and all the rooms were quiet. Angele could only hear the snoring of people and the noises made by the beds. There was a chilling wind blowing through the hallways, making Angele feel much better after walking out of his room.Angele went straight to the bathroom at the end of the hallway and took a shower. He then returned to his room and wiped off the black blood on his clothes. Angele felt refreshed, then putting all his dirty clothes at the corner.\u2018As a wizard apprentice, I can only meditate for a certain duration each day. Otherwise, my body wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the pressure. There are still three leaves on the Dead Soul Grass, and when I finish all three, my body will change. By then, I won\u2019t need to find new grass anymore,\u2019 Angele recalled the information from the book. The maximum number of hours he could now do was 5 hours per day. He carefully put the box containing the grass beneath his pillow and fell asleep right after.The second morning.Angele awoke at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning, brimming with strength and energy. He got off the bed and looked at the Wizard\u2019s book on the desk.\u2018The dorm isn\u2019t safe enough a place for this. I should ask Master to keep them for me,\u2019 Angele thought. He placed the book and the box inside a black bag and left the room with it.It was still early in the morning, and no carriage for hire was there yet. He didn\u2019t return to his bed and instead walked toward the sword training ground. He passed by the dorm and dining hall before heading toward a hill west of the building. Built upon it was a platform, the place clearly being the sword training ground. Batches of equipment were stored in a gray stone house behind the platform, and more than 30 wooden training dummies stood on the ground, green grass surrounding the ground all over. It was still a bit dark, making the place seemed eerie. Insects cried and sang in the forest nearby.Angele tied the bag around an arm of a dummy before grabbing a wooden sword from the stone house. He heard noises in the air as he did several basic slashes. Angele felt satisfied. He walked toward the dummy that had his bag tied on it and decided to start practicing.\u2018Unknown human beings approaching. Distance: 103 meters. Numbers: 3,\u2019 Zero suddenly reported. Angele didn\u2019t know that people would come so early just to hone their sword skills, but he wasn\u2019t too concerned about them. He knew several students who occasionally practiced very early. There were three males chatting while walking, slowly drawing near to Angele. With Angele\u2019s excellent hearing, he could easily hear their conversation.\u201c \u2026 I heard that several new faces joined the school\u2019s grand tournament, each of which was very strong,\u201d one of them said.\u201cWhatever, those people are always the champions. Asma\u2019s Storm Sword skill is way too strong. I heard he was selected to be the future leader of the harbor\u2019s police department, and Geline was working at the patrol already. There are some people who have exceptional sword skills such as Allen, Albert, Nancy, and Alger. They won\u2019t be easily defeated by newcomers,\u201d someone else said.\u201cThey may be strong, but no one can stand a chance against Asma. He won the sword skill competition at Westwind, making the other contestants look like a joke. I choose to be a swordsman because I admire him. Also, I heard that Alger has been practicing at the training ground very early recently. We might meet him there,\u201d another one said.As the footsteps were getting close, Angele shook his head after hearing their conversation. He laughed because he had seen Asma using a sword before. He was very strong and his skill set was refined. It might even be stronger than Angele\u2019s basic sword skill set. Angele met him once at this training ground, and he must be from a high-class family. Angele used his chip to collect data on Asma\u2019s Storm Sword skills, concluding after that those skills required the Life Energy Seed to unlock the full potential. The set was at the level of a grand knight, but it was useless to Angele.Compared to the storm set\u2019s burst potential, Angele\u2019s basic skills were focused on technique and precision. If Angele tried to practice the set, he would just get a backlash as he didn\u2019t meet the requirement for it. After all, he didn\u2019t have the Life Energy Seed. The Grand Sword Tournament was a tradition of the Andes Alliance, which was held every other year. The school would become raucous during the tournament. Some high-class nobles would be invited to be the judges. Not only were the contestants the students in the school, even the alumni participated since the prize itself was tempting.Angele never cared about it as his goal was reaching stage one as a wizard apprentice and awaiting the boat of the Wizard organizations. Angele stopped listening to their conversation, deciding to focus on practicing instead. He raised his wooden sword and initiated a front slash on the dummy \u2014 something which he kept repeating. As the three students arrived at the training ground, they became surprised when they saw Angele.\u201cIt\u2019s Angele, the language genius! I heard he\u2019s Master Adolf\u2019s favorite student, and he even taught Angele privately,\u201d one of them said with a faint voice.\u201cShall we greet him?\u201d he continued.\u201cNope, let\u2019s not disturb him. I heard he\u2019s also an impressive archer such that many students said that he has a 90% accuracy rate even when the targets are 100 meters away! If we have a tournament for archery, he\u2019ll be at the top 3 for sure! Also, I heard he doesn\u2019t like other students, very self-centered, and even has a bad temper. Some students once said in public that they don\u2019t like him, but after a while, they suddenly stopped saying things like that. They probably had a \u2018great time\u2019 with Angele,\u201d the other one said.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s just stay away from him. Just don\u2019t anger him,\u201d the one who was at the front said.The three talked for a while, though they tried avoiding any eye contact with Angele. They picked a place far from him, and then began training with wooden swords they had taken. Angele found it funny when he heard their gossip while practicing. He thought he didn\u2019t attract any attention in school, but apparently, he was well-known. The students who didn\u2019t like Angele were just random small fry who knew a little bit about fighting skills trying to fight him. Angele taught them a lesson within several seconds. They left him alone after learning that he was Adolf\u2019s student. After that incident, rumors spread saying that Angele wasn\u2019t one to be trifled with.Angele didn\u2019t too deeply about it. However, people were saying how he was self-centered and had a bad temper, making Angele speechless. He shook his head and decided to continue training.In the next several days, the school became very busy as many activities organized by students were ongoing. Angele saw many students walking to and fro with swords tied to their waists. Many timbers were being carried to the training ground. It seemed that the tournament would be held there wherein the school was building the audience area.Angele heard students talking about the champion candidates in the dorm many times, but he never cared about it. He continued his daily routine, but he now meditated instead of sleeping. He couldn\u2019t go to the sword training ground due to the recent event, so he instead went to the archery training ground. His meditation wasn\u2019t progressing quite well after his first experience. Angele\u2019s attributes didn\u2019t increase the same amount as the former 0.3 increment in stamina, but he could feel his body becoming stronger. The chip wasn\u2019t giving him exact numbers, but he could feel it was slowly but constantly increasing. Angele felt great as he could keep 8 runes in his mind now. His mind was clearer than before even without sleep.*****************************The 3rd dorm building in the school. Inside a random room.Several students were chatting together.\u201cHey! Caesar, I didn\u2019t know Angele was in this school too!\u201d one guy said.\u201cAngele? Angele Rio? That dumb playboy?\u201d The young man named Caesar seemed surprised.\u201cYea, him.\u201d The guys laughed.\u201cLucky guy. He didn\u2019t get killed while running away? He was weak as a snail,\u201d a girl with short hair said, and laughed. She was eating something that looked like sunflower seeds, which looked tasty.\u201cCaitlyn, what courses will you and your brother choose? The fees here are really expensive, so I\u2019ll just stick with painting,\u201d she asked as she turned to a girl behind her. A beautiful girl with blonde hair draped all over the shoulders was sitting beside her, drinking some tea slowly.\u201cAngele Rio? I heard there\u2019s a talented student named Angele. Is that him?\u201d The blonde girl didn\u2019t answer the question. She was more concerned about the previous topic.\u201cYep, that\u2019s him.\u201d The first guy laughed.\u201cThat prick is doing well. I hear he\u2019s studying under Master Adolf. He\u2019s a mere one lucky bastard. Who the hell does he think he is? Damn!\u201d he continued. It was as though he didn\u2019t care, but people who knew him knew he was just jealous.\u201cYea, Angele was never a smart guy,\u201d Caitlyn said as she laughed.*****************************Five days later\u2026\u201cAngele, do you know a girl named Caitlyn?\u201d Roger, who lived alongside Angele in the dorm, suddenly asked. He was currently having dinner with Angele.Angele didn\u2019t know Roger too well, but they occasionally had dinner together and would chat for a while. Roger was most likely the only person who would talk to Angele aside from Sophia in school. He was also the same person who told Angele about the course schedule at the dorm.\u201cCaitlyn? Why do you ask?\u201d Angele thought for a second before answering. He remembered that the viscount\u2019s daughter was also named Caitlyn. The original Angele died when he fell off the horse during the competition, which was indirectly caused by her. Roger spread butter over his bread and grabbed the strawberry jam by the side.\u201cShe just registered, but I heard that she and her brother got entangled in some trouble. They messed with Vivak, thus the latter surrounded them with his gang. They had no way out, so Caitlyn said you were her fianc\u00e9 in front of everyone. Vivak was unwilling to fight you, so he left them alone after,\u201d Roger said before he laughed.\u201cNow it seems like you don\u2019t know her at all. Things will become hilarious, I suppose,\u201d Roger continued. He wasn\u2019t from a very large family, but he was certainly better than the typical Rudin nobles who fled from their own country.\u201cYea?\u201d Angele didn\u2019t want to say too much, so he just laughed. He grabbed an apple-like fruit and took a bite on it. The Candia family didn\u2019t prepare for the Saladin invasion, so their main forces were killed on their way to escape. They now had lost territory. Angele once saw one of the corpses of their dead men on the way, but he couldn\u2019t even remember the person\u2019s name. Viscount Candia was lucky enough to reach Marua alive.\u201cWhat\u2019s the girl\u2019s full name?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cCaitlyn Candia,\u201d Roger said, then took a big bite on his toast.\u2018That\u2019s her,\u2019 Angele thought. He smiled at Roger, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Departure (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeTwo days later\u2026The ship from the Wizard\u2019s organization was still on the way, more than five days away from here. Angele returned to his family\u2019s manor once, planning on talking to his father. However, the baron was already out on the mission on the Anser Plain, so he instead had some fun time with Maggie and Celia. He also left a letter addressed to his father. He decided to stay in the school awaiting the ship while continuing to train his sword and archery skills. As he also meditated every day, he felt as though he was living a quality life.After lunch, Angele went to the archery skill training ground. The training platform was grassy and many targets were built under a large tent. Each person had an individual line in front with the bows hanging at the side. The grass shone as it reflected the light under the sun. A breeze blew over Angele, but the only thing he could feel was the heat from the sun.There were already some people practicing in the archery training ground when Angele entered. He selected the line by the right far end like he used to. He took the brown wooden bow on the side and pulled the bowstring several times.\u201cNice, someone is taking good care of these bows,\u201d Angele said and nodded. Several girls walked into the training ground, but they stayed at the lines at the left side. Angle could still hear their conversation.\u201cMary, would you like to try it?\u201d one of the girls asked.\u201cSure,\u201d the girl name Mary answered. Angele heard the sound a bowstring would make when it was fully drawn. Angele felt slightly curious and looked over to their line. He saw a wooden arrow flying across the line, but it didn\u2019t even pass the 20-meter mark before dropping down to the ground.\u201cNice shot!\u201d\u201cSuch skills!\u201d\u201cMary, you\u2019re so good!\u201dThe girls around Mary looked surprised, an expression unable to be faked. They clearly thought the result was great.\u201c20 meters is most likely the best result I can get, yet Mary made it look so easy!\u201d\u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cMary Sauron, you are such an archer!\u201d The girls kept praising Mary.\u201cYou guys are making fun of me, right?\u201d Mary asked jokingly.\u201cWe\u2019re not. Haha.\u201d The girls started laughing.\u201cIf my brother was here, he would at least hit the target. 100 meters is nothing to him,\u201d Mary said.\u201cYea? My sister can do it too. She can easily hit the 5th ring.\u201d The targets they used in school were the standard 9-ring ones with the bullseye located right in the middle. An average student could barely hit the target. If one were to hit the 5th ring, however, he would get a high mark in the archery course.\u201cTalking about archery skills, I hear Angele\u2019s impressive at it. He could hit the 9th ring 9 out of 10 times. Some even said he was one of the best in the school. Is that true, Caitlyn?\u201d one of the girls asked.\u201cAngele could easily do that. He brought me to the shooting range several times when we were dating. Hitting the 9th ring at a 100-meter distance didn\u2019t pose any problem to him,\u201d a girl said with a calm voice, but she sounded prideful.Angele felt a bit awkward after having recognized the voice right away. That was the girl whom the original Angele fell in love with, thus he decided not to listen to her nonsense. He grabbed an arrow from his quiver and nocked it onto his bow. Angele didn\u2019t ask the chip to assist in aiming; only shooting the arrow by relying on his intuition and muscle memory. Before, he could only shoot countless arrows accurately and precisely by relying on the chip. But now, he could aim targets precisely without requiring its assistance any longer. The wooden arrow he shot struck the bullseye from 100 meters away, an outstanding feat compared to other students\u2019. Some of them began cheering as they barely had any chance to see someone with such accuracy and precision.Angele didn\u2019t cease continuing to shoot arrows, but he stopped aiming for the bullseye and only choosing to hit the 3rd or 4th ring. He still landed every shot, but people stopped watching him. Angele didn\u2019t want to attract too much attention since he merely wanted to do some basic training. After about 15 minutes, he grabbed the blanket to wipe off his sweat after emptying three quivers. Angele didn\u2019t use the protective thumb ring because his finger was as strong as a knight\u2019s.Angele put down the bow and walked along the hallway. He decided to greet the girls when he passed by them. It was the girl the original Angele liked, so he thought he should at least make things clear. Angele turned back, walking toward them. Five pretty girls were still happily chatting.\u201cAnything we could help you with?\u201d one of the girls asked.\u201cYou\u2019re Caitlyn, right? Long time no see. How are you doing?\u201d Angele walked toward a blonde girl and asked with a gentle smile on his face. They stopped talking for a while, looking at each other confusedly.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not Caitlyn. She is\u2026\u201d the blonde girl said, pointing to another blonde girl on her right while having a strange expression.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Angele showed a speechless face before he started smiling again.\u201cI\u2019m Angele. Caitlyn, long time no see,\u201d Angele said as he turned to the girl on his left. Caitlyn was blushing, unable to maintain eye contact with Angele. She knew her lie had been unraveled and could feel her \u2018friends\u2019 looking at her disdainfully.Angele\u2019s mission had been accomplished, so he became satisfied. He wanted to show to these girls that he wasn\u2019t familiar with Caitlyn. They would spread the rumor for him after. Angele died for this girl during the challenge, but she didn\u2019t even come to visit after. A worker placed him on a carriage and brought him back to the castle alone. Though Angele was a completely different person now, he didn\u2019t want her using his name to avoid troubles. Angele had been angered when he first heard what Caitlyn said when she was dealing with Vivak. The situation became awkward and in the end, Caitlyn ran away from the scene without looking back.\u201cAngele, Caitlyn said that you were her fianc\u00e9. Is that true?\u201d the blonde girl asked.\u201cNo way.\u201d Angele shook his head, \u201cWe were just classmates learning from the same teacher back in Rudin. I have no idea why she would say something like that,\u201d Angele continued before laughing.\u201cI knew it. Angele, you\u2019re quite famous in our school and we all know you\u2019re proficient in archery and language,\u201d Mary, the girl with short black hair, said. Angele talked with the girls for a while and returned to the dorm after. He had reached his goal, so he didn\u2019t want to waste time on them anymore.Angele knew what Caitlyn was thinking and knew how much of a phony she was. Caitlyn most likely thought that Angele would be more than happy to come back to her if she said something like \u2018Angele is my fianc\u00e9\u2019 and try to make it seem as if Angele couldn\u2019t live without her. Dating Angele would increase her reputation and incur the admiration of other students since many students admired Angele at present. She thought Angele still dearly loved her, never giving up the chance to be with her. However, Angele wasn\u2019t the same weak playboy anymore and knew exactly what he ought to do.After the rumor spread out, nothing much changed. However, people started treating the Candias\u2019 and their friends like a joke. No one treated them seriously any longer such that they would gossip about them during dinner. Vivak didn\u2019t try to teach them a lesson after hearing the truth, only warning them several times. He said it was because they used to know Angele. But no matter what, Angele didn\u2019t want to entangle himself into this anymore.A week\u2019s time quickly passed, and Angele\u2019s stamina increased to 2.9. The galleon from the Wizard organizations finally arrived at the harbor.Somewhere at Marua Harbor was a small path made of stone that led toward the sea. A thick layer of black stones was upon it with the ocean right beside the path. The waves ceaselessly crashed against the docks. Angele was waiting there along with ten other people. He had his white swordsman suit worn, a black backpack on his back and the silver crossguard sword by his waist. Angele\u2019s body was well-toned and robust, which somehow contributed to his charm. Adolf and two bodyguards were standing beside him. They were here because only they knew which galleon was of the Wizard organizations. Adolf wanted to ensure everything goes as he planned.Noontime it was, with the sun pouring rays of light constantly as though it was about to scorch the ground. Heat came like the waves of the sea, making the people unable to stop wiping the sweat off their faces. Finally, a fleet of merchant galleons appeared on the horizon as it headed slowly toward the docks. All had the \u2018whale and trident\u2019 insignia on their flags and most of the galleons carried a lot of cargos.\u201cThose are the merchant galleons of Sea View Trading Company. Make sure you board the last one, don\u2019t screw up,\u201d Adolf whispered by Angele\u2019s ear with a serious tone.\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Angele said as he nodded in understanding.Angele slightly raised his head and looked at the arriving galleons. The sky and the ocean were akin to sapphire, identical in color as though they had converged as one. The galleons that were adorned in blue and white were slowly drawing near to the docks. The wind was very strong, carrying Angele\u2019s hair with its every whim. Angele could also hear the constant noise of the waves hitting the docks.Two white seabirds chirped and flew over the crowd. People around were talking. It seemed that they came here to board the trading company\u2019s galleons. There were about a hundred people on this 100-meter-long path lined up on the dock.\u201cStop looking, those people are just here as a fa\u00e7ade. Not many of them will actually board the galleon,\u201d Adolf said as he patted Angele\u2019s shoulders.\u201cThe truth? How many are people here like me? Do you know, Master?\u201d Angele understood what Adolf was trying to say, so he asked.\u201cI\u2019m not sure, but the young ones who board the last galleon probably have the same purpose as you. You\u2019ll know once you board it. Someone will explain everything to you,\u201d Adolf shook his head as he said. The galleons were drawing near. From afar the horizon, they seemed like dots in their perspective, but as they drew nearer, they looked humongous. The merchant galleons were of the same size as the cruisers of Earth.\u201cWow\u2026 What do they use to power those things\u2026?\u201d Angele was surprised at the size.\u201cThey use something special. No way the sails are making them move. The sails are probably just for saving \u2018energy\u2019.\u201d Adolf looked at the incoming merchant galleons and said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: On the Ship (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeTen minutes later, the fleet of merchant galleons had already set ashore. Workers began unloading wooden cargo boxes from nearly all the galleons and piled everything on the docks. Despite the weather condition, the workers were still doing their utmost to fulfill their tasks. Several merchants wearing luxurious clothes disembarked as well, and they started conversing with the people who were responsible for the clearance procedures of the newly-arrived goods. They were waiting to make sure everything was going well.The last galleon in the fleet stopped by the dock where Angele was waiting. Several teenagers whom of which were mostly rich were looking at him and the dock itself through the windows of the galleon. Their faces were brimming with curiosity and at the same time, traces of arrogance were noticeable on their faces, something that Angele could clearly see. Large wooden planks had been oiled and secured at the dock as a catwalk for the people. These wooden planks were of black and red color, about 50 cm thick and had a width of about 7 to 8 meters.A middle-aged man standing on the deck alongside several sailors yelled toward the crowd on the dock, \u201cGet aboard the galleon!\u201d With that as the signal, people started boarding the galleon one by one. Angele expressed his farewell by nodding to Master Adolf before boarding.\u201cDon\u2019t forget to talk to Nancy. She\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d Adolf said with a voice that only Angele could hear. Angele was already on the wooden catwalk when he heard this. He kept nodding to let his master know he got the message. There were about 40 people with him in total, partly having teenagers among of which 7 to 8 of them looked extremely young. They all looked calm and collected, trying to search for people of similar age among the crowd as well. Angele thought of the probability of them being a wizard apprentice just like him, while the rest were only fa\u00e7ades to prevent the leakage of the galleon\u2019s true form and purpose.Most of the people went to unload the cargos; only about 10 teenagers remained on deck. There was a handsome red-haired boy about 18 years of age standing beside Angele. He stood with a blonde boy, both carefully looking at others. On the right side of the deck was a girl wearing a white one piece a lace at its bottom. She was about 14 to 15 years old, and though her dress was beautiful, she didn\u2019t blend quite well with the people on the galleon and was also checking on others.Angele had his sights on two of the teenagers because they had auras different to others. One of them was a ponytailed, blonde young man wearing a gold-white noble suit. His chin raised slightly in a proud fashion as though he was enjoying becoming the center of attention. The saber by his waist was supposedly used for fencing, yet he was merely carrying it as a decoration.The other one was a girl who had a serious expression on her face. She looked like someone who wasn\u2019t fond of smiling a lot. Angele thought that she must be a hardworking student. Same as the young man, the girl also had a long, blonde ponytail. She had a slim but well-proportioned body and was wearing white clothes. What caught people\u2019s attention were her arm guards. The young men around the ship deck couldn\u2019t help but look at her. However, the girl didn\u2019t know how attractive she was to these men, thus it was clear how dense she was.Angele obviously knew who the girl was. It was Nancy, the girl that Master Adolf had spoken of and the same person who would take care of him. Her father was a duke in Andes Alliance while her mother was a princess of a smaller country. Nancy was famous in the school and respected by nearly everyone there. She once studied the Anmag language under Adolf when she was young, and she respected him a lot. That was the main reason why she decided to help.Nancy noticed Angele\u2019s gaze, then she walked toward Angele right away.\u201cYou\u2019re Angele Rio?\u201d Nancy asked in a cold tone.\u201cYes, you\u2019re Nancy, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019ve heard about you many times in school,\u201d Angele politely answered. When Nancy drew close to him, Zero sent out a warning as it sensed strong radiation energy from her and reported that the probability of her possessing an enchanted item was 79%. Angele knew the power of enchanted items. At present, he currently had no methods of dealing with such power even with his knight level strength since it meant nothing against anyone who possessed such items.\u201cNancy? I\u2019ve heard your name before.\u201d The young man with a ponytail walked toward them while smiling.\u201cMy name is Ali Van Norman. I assume you know who I am,\u201d he continued.\u201cYes. Ali, the son of Prince Amn,\u201d Nancy said politely as she turned to him. No one dared to ignore a son of the Prince.\u201cSo he\u2019s the second son of the Prince\u2026\u201d\u201cI knew it was him.\u201d People around began buzzing around in discussions about Ali. When Ali approached, Zero warned Angele again in the same manner as what had happened when Nancy neared him. Apparently, he possessed an enchanted item as well.Zero could sense strong radiation energy emanating from them, which meant that their items could be wielded anytime. The enchanted items alone would place their strength levels at the top, far stronger than anyone else on deck at this point. Angele knew the real of such items, able to change the tides of a battle in but a mere moment. The two knights he had encountered before began to flee as soon as they saw Angele take out the ring. Nonetheless, they were still slain. A grand knight most likely could stand a chance of surviving such ordeal, but the possibility of that to occur was close to nil.Ali and Nancy started having a small conversation. Soon after, other students from high-class families also joined in the conversation. But because of the two\u2019s ranking in the hierarchy, they were quite reserved and barely had the chance to speak. After talking for a while, a man in a black robe appeared on deck along with the teenagers Angele saw before following the man from behind. The man had his body completely concealed by his robe such that Angele could only see his face.\u201cStudents of Marua, I assume you know about the rules,\u201d the man said in a light tone.\u201cYes, Master. Take the test and quietly wait before getting off the boat,\u201d Ali stepped forward as he bowed before speaking. The others seemed like they had no idea of what to do.\u201cThe rule is simple. I know some of you hate each other, but on this boat, no one shall be your enemy. Don\u2019t do anything stupid just because you see someone you dislike,\u201d the man nodded as he said.\u201cYou guys, head to the hall of the 4th floor,\u201d the man said while pointing at the entrance by the side.\u201cFollow me,\u201d Nancy looked at Angele and said.Angele knew Nancy would help him out, and it was wise to stay with someone who had enchanted items. He nodded and followed her from behind. They went inside the cabin through the entrance. Without doing anything else, the ones who came with the man merely spectated as they stood there. Some of them were laughing and talking, and two girls who looked like twins caught Angele\u2019s attention as they were very cute. Zero warned him about enchanted items several times while he was being watched. It seemed that they possessed enchanted items, too.The galleon traveled across many countries, picking up all the elites on the way. They most likely came from famous families as most of them were wearing luxurious clothes. From a perspective, it was as though the Wizard organizations were isolating normal people from their world. Even if the children of average families had the talent in becoming a wizard, they would never make it through this recruitment process. It was quite likely that Angele wouldn\u2019t have been able to get on the galleon if not for Adolf\u2019s recommendation.Inside the cabin, they went down the stairs as the man in black robe led the way, quickly reaching the hall of the 4th floor. The walls were made of redwood and many beautiful paintings hung on them. There was also a large crystal chandelier at the ceiling; many unlit candles sat upon it. The hall was completely empty, not even a chair or a desk. After the man walked right into the middle of the hall, he turned around facing them.\u201cIs there any stage 3 apprentice below 18 years of age here? If there is, please stand behind me,\u201d he said in a gentle manner as though he was quite careful to not offend apprentices with such talent. Four people stepped forward and stood behind the man. Ali and Nancy were part of the four. Angele had already seen the other two before; one was the girl wearing a white one piece and the other was a black-haired boy. However, he was wearing clothes befitting of an average noble, so he barely caught anyone\u2019s attention. Never would Angele have expected him to be a stage 3 apprentice.\u201cName and age?\u201d the man in black robe asked.\u201cAli, 17.\u201d\u201cNance, 16.\u201d\u201cGaben, 16.\u201d\u201cJared, 14.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d People around were all surprised, and they inspected on the black-haired boy. Even the man in a black robe was completely shocked, unable to prevent himself from examining the boy more closely.\u201cAre you really 14?\u201d he asked.\u201cYep, my birthday was last month. Is there any problem?\u201d Jared calmly asked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: On the Ship (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeEveryone looked at Jared with mixed feelings. Angele was surprised, too. After all, Jared was nearly a year younger than him, but Jared already reached stage 3. Angele realized that he really had no idea just how vast this mysterious world was.\u201cNo, impressive actually. Jared, right? Can you spare some time after the test, so we could talk?\u201d the man asked with an excited look on his face.\u201cSure.\u201d Jared nodded, still having a calm demeanor.\u201cStage 2 wizard apprentices under the age of 18, please stand by my left side.\u201d The man nodded before he turned back to the rest. Seven more people stepped forward while four people remained uncalled, not including Angele.\u201cGood, stage 3 wizard apprentices won\u2019t be tested. The rest of you, come with me,\u201d the man said before nodding.\u201cCome in here one by one. Stage 2 wizard apprentices first.\u201d He walked through a wooden door at the end of the hall. Angele attempted to peek, but he couldn\u2019t see anything but darkness inside. The stage 2 wizard apprentices went inside first. Within 20 seconds, they went out with different expressions on their faces. Some of them looked happy, while some looked despondent.Angele didn\u2019t need to wait for long before it was their turn. He hadn\u2019t even reached stage 1 yet, but the man didn\u2019t seem to care. There were four apprentices who were at stage 1. The first one who went inside was a black-haired girl with a ponytail. She went in and after just a few seconds, she got out with a disappointed expression and tears in her eyes. Only a few who went in got out with happy expressions while the rest all looked disappointed. As they knew of this fact, Angele and the other two became nervous, merely looking at each other without doing anything. It was clear that no one wanted to go in first.\u201cHurry up! Next!\u201d the man yelled. He was speaking in Rudin, but he had a strange accent whenever he got nervous. Angele looked at the other two before deciding to head in first. He hesitated for a second when he was right in front of the wooden door, and then he went into the darkness. He inhaled once and smelled something fishy. It was the volcano grass, something that Angele had on his way to Marua.\u201cCan you sense my location?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was coming from all directions. Angele listened carefully and used the chip to enhance his sensation.\u2018Analyzing\u2026 The sound waves are coming from all directions. The number of sources is 4. No actual location detected\u2026\u2019 Zero reported. Angele scrunched his eyebrows as there was nothing else he could do.\u201cYea, you can\u2019t.\u201d The man stopped for a moment before he started writing down something.\u201cWhich directions does my voice come from?\u201d he asked.\u201cAll directions,\u201d Angele answered.\u201cHow about up and down?\u201d the man asked.\u201cNope,\u201d Angele said.\u201cGood, you\u2019re being honest. Your name?\u201d he asked again.\u201cAngele Rio,\u201d Angele said.\u201cThere are five different levels of talent. You\u2019re at level 2, slightly better compared to level 1. You may leave now,\u201d the man said.Angele felt a bit disappointed. Before leaving the room, he bowed toward the darkness.The two outside the room saw Angele\u2019s expression, causing their anxiety levels to escalate. Nonetheless, they still went inside and took the test, but they had a lachrymose expression. After the test was finished, the man in black robe walked out of the room and locked the door. He then turned around and looked at all the apprentices.\u201cStage 3 wizard apprentices, your rooms are on the 1st floor. Stage 2 wizard apprentices\u2019 rooms will be on the 2nd floor. The rest, just go to the 5th floor and pick any room you want. Dining room and bathrooms will be on this floor. The rooms above the deck are all full, and people there are from other countries. Don\u2019t go upstairs if you don\u2019t have any reason to do so. You do not want to mess with some of the terrible ones. As long as you don\u2019t go up there yourself, they won\u2019t come down here. I shall oversee the deck, and if you have any questions, you can talk to me there. You may leave now. I\u2019ll post the list later. You can come and check if you want,\u201d the man in black robe said before leaving the hall.\u201cWell, shall we go find ourselves some rooms?\u201d Others all agreed when someone said this. The wizard apprentices of Marua Harbor were already divided into three groups: stage 3 wizard apprentices, stage 2 wizard apprentices, and stage 1 wizard apprentices. They didn\u2019t live on the same floors, and Angele needed to go to the lowest floor. They bade farewell to each other before going to their respective floors.The passage here was very narrow and wet. Angele kept hearing footsteps coming from above, but he didn\u2019t see anyone other than his fellow wizard apprentices. Angele was behind the group of people. The one in front of him was a handsome-looking red-haired boy, and second in the line was a blonde boy. These two were the ones who were beside Angele back on the docks. The one leading their group was the girl who had her black hair tied pony tail and was wearing swordsman armor. She didn\u2019t let her emotions become apparent on her face, but she looked cool and beautiful. She wore tight shirt and pants under her armor, making Angele think that she looked like a European fencing player.The tight clothes she wore made her look very sexy, especially the tight pants. She had a different style of beauty compared to Nancy. If Angele were to see her from a distance, he would\u2019ve just thought she was wearing normal swordsman suit. However, the girl\u2019s body turned a normal suit into something charming such that the boys who were following her from behind couldn\u2019t help but stare at her butt. The four kept walking down in silence, but then, the talkative blonde boy finally decided to say something.\u201cWell, since we\u2019re all stage 1 wizard apprentice, we\u2019re all in the same boat now. How about introducing ourselves?\u201d he smiled.\u201cMy name is Lando Luc, 15 years old. Let\u2019s not talk about family though, they don\u2019t care how big a background you have there anyway,\u201d he continued.\u201cI\u2019m Yuri, 15 years old. Talent level 2. I think we\u2019re the weakest in this ship,\u201d the red-haired boy spoke after his best friend. When he spoke, he had a bitter smile on his face.\u201cAngele, 14 years old. Talent level 2. I don\u2019t think talent matters that much. We\u2019re young so we still have a chance,\u201d Angele smiled while trying to uplift the atmosphere.\u201cDon\u2019t talk if you have no idea about what you\u2019re saying!\u201d the girl turned around and spoke coldly.\u201cDo you know how long it takes for a stage 1 wizard apprentice to reach stage 2? We need to spend at least two years because we\u2019re not too talented! Compared to those who are already at stage 2 or 3, they\u2019re way ahead of us. Two years\u2019 time can help them become real wizards already. The school and organizations will allocate more resources to them. We really can\u2019t do anything!\u201d The girl was almost yelling.\u201cYou know how to become a real wizard?\u201d Angele scrunched his eyebrows as he became a bit mad.\u201cAt least they\u2019re more talented, and they\u2019ll get there faster than us.\u201d The girl calmed down.\u201cI apologize for my attitude. I was just feeling a bit sad,\u201d she said.\u201cNo worries. As of now, we\u2019re in the same boat, and we might need to help out each other in the future. Don\u2019t get too upset.\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cCalm down guys. Girl, could you introduce yourself to us? We still don\u2019t know your name,\u201d Yuri said while smiling. The girl turned around and stopped looking at them.\u201cVelvet, 16 years old. Talent level\u2026 1,\u201d the girl hesitated for a second before she spoke. Yuri and Lando Luc ceased talking. They now felt pity toward the girl.\u201cTalent level 1\u2026 No wonder she was so upset,\u201d Lando turned to face Angele and spoke with a light voice.\u201cCan you tell me how much of a difference is between each talent level? I really have no idea about it,\u201d Angele asked.\u201cAccording to some of the Wizardry books, the level is decided by your rate of progress in meditation. The best ones have level 5 talents, and they can become a stage 3 wizard apprentice within a year. They\u2019re quite likely to become real wizards, even barely failing the promotion tests. Only half of talent level 4 apprentices can become real wizards. Anything below level 4 is tragic. 4% chance for the ones who have talent level 3 and 1% chance for the ones who have talent level 2. For the ones who have talent level 1\u2026 maybe one out of a thousand or ten thousand chance and they progress very slowly. A month\u2019s time for some with talent level 1 is equivalent to one day for the ones with talent levels 2 and 3. That is definitely a huge difference,\u201d Lando smiled as he explained.Angele nodded, feeling a bit sad.\u201cActually, wizards don\u2019t really care about the ones with talent level 1, so they just place those who aren\u2019t too talented altogether. It\u2019s not a surprise,\u201d Lando continued.\u201cSo, Velvet is hopeless now?\u201d Yuri joined the conversation.\u201cPretty much,\u201d Lando said. Angele stopped talking. He looked at the girl in front of him and saw her shaking shoulders. She must have heard what they were saying.\u201cShe probably spent five years meditating to reach stage 1. Such a pity,\u201d Lando said as he looked at the girl. It wasn\u2019t that he was looking down on her; it was just because he really felt sorry for her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Nancy (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThey didn\u2019t say anything else after their last conversation because the topic about talent levels only made everyone upset. They went down the stairs quickly and reached the 5th floor. There wasn\u2019t even a single candle lit on the 5th floor and the passage itself was completely dark. Velvet didn\u2019t hesitate to keep walking forward. She had two small black stones in her hands. After she struck the black stone against the other, both started to shine as though both were shining gems. Finally, the four could see things clearly.\u201cWhat are those?\u201d Lando Luc asked while staring at the stones curiously.\u201cLight stones. Basic wizard item,\u201d Velvet answered in a light voice. Angele looked at the stones and asked Zero to analyze it. The result showed that both contained a certain amount of radiation energy that would make them shine after impact, but the amount of energy was too small for it to do anything other than lighting the way.They reached the living quarters quickly. Neither light nor other people were around. Angele opened the door to one of the rooms, immediately inhaling the stench of mold inside. The room was also very wet, and nothing was visible. No one was afraid of darkness, so they picked their rooms right away. It seemed that there were only four people on this 5th floor, so they decided to live opposite each others\u2019 room in case something happened.Lando Luc chose the room opposite to Angele and Velvet chose the room opposite to Yuri\u2019s that was beside Angele\u2019s. Angele lit the oil lamp on the desk and put the cover back on it. He took a quick look around the room. It was a very normal room: one single bed, two chairs, and a small wooden desk. Molds were all over the desk, walls, and on the ground.\u201cJust because we don\u2019t have much talent?\u201d Angele shook his head and left the room with his nose squeezed. He saw others leaving their rooms too, doing the same as him.\u201cLet\u2019s clean our rooms first,\u201d Yuri said.\u201cSure.\u201d Everyone agreed. Except for Yuri, all of them knew how to do the cleaning, and they quickly cleaned up their rooms after finding the tools from the washroom. Lando Luc ended up doing the cleaning for Yuri. Their rooms now looked a bit better. At least there were no more molds everywhere. After that, they returned to their respective rooms to meditate, and slowly, the ship left the shore.In the following days, Angele barely communicated with other apprentices because they pretty much stayed in their rooms meditating and reading the books they had brought. He could only see others when it was mealtime and when he went up the deck to get some natural light and fresh air. Angele didn\u2019t do anything else apart from reading books and meditating. Every day, he saw Velvet, who always seemed to be in pain, on deck. Lando Luc once told him that some wizard apprentices with talent level 1 would experience strange pains during the meditation process. It seemed that Velvet was one of those wizard apprentices. Angele would never know how painful that could be since he had a talent level of 2.Angele felt sorry for her, but he didn\u2019t care about others. Recently, his meditation was progressing well. He also found out that the method of meditation had to be obtained either by reading a Wizardry book or feeling a specific spell\u2019s effect. It was impossible for him to teach someone the meditation procedures through talking. Also, the runes were stored in the minds of wizard apprentices, and they had no idea how to describe them by words.Also, Yuri told Angele that there was an age restriction in studying the runes. Anyone below the age of 12 wouldn\u2019t qualify to read and memorize the runes. If they were to try to read and memorize the runes, it was highly likely for them to lose their own minds. After five days of meditation, Angele could finally keep 10 runes in his mind, but the speed was average due to his talent level. The man in a black robe didn\u2019t even ask anything about the stage 1 apprentices because they were nearly close to normal people, just with a stronger mentality.Another half-month passed. The galleon only stopped once on a dock and took in more than 10 new wizard apprentices. Only one girl was added to the 5th floor after the test. For the others, Angele didn\u2019t have any information on them. The new girl was green-haired and a bit dark-skinned and had a longbow on her back. She didn\u2019t look like she was in the mood to talk, so the four left her alone, and she just found herself a room at the end of the passage.********************\u201cDamn\u2026 12 finally.\u201d Angele crossed his legs and sat on the bed with a face that looked slightly pale. He had stayed on the cold, wet floor for too long. His skin had also become paler and whiter than before due to the absence of sunlight. For some reason, however, he did look as healthy as before.\u201cI reached stage 1, so now I need to sense the unknown energies in the space. If I can lead them into my body, I\u2019ll reach stage 2,\u201d Angele excitedly muttered as he was searching for the information stored on the chip.\u2018It took me about one month to get here. According to Yuri, becoming a stage 1 wizard apprentice in a month is the average speed. Progressing after that is going to become hard. The youngest stage 3 apprentice, Jared, spent two years to reach stage 3. I probably need a lot more time than that,\u2019 Angele thought as he prepared himself for the future. Angele had once taken a peek at the list on the ship deck. He saw Jared having a talent level of 4 while Nancy and Ali having a talent level of 3. He stopped thinking and looked at the crystal clock he had brought. It was already 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, so he could meditate for just one more hour. Angele closed his eyes and began meditating again.Angele wasn\u2019t thinking about the runes anymore, and instead, he was trying to sense any special energy in the air. The energy should be mysterious and difficult to find. The type of energy Angele could sense would determine his future. Within the darkness, Angele had his legs crossed, sitting on the bed. His eyes were closed and his eyes weren\u2019t shining like when he was trying to memorize the runes. It looked like he was just sleeping.\u2018Zero, catch energy signals in the air and use any information you need,\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Commencing mission\u2026 Now searching\u2026\u2019 Zero started consuming Angele\u2019s stamina, trying to do the analysis as quick as possible. Yet, nothing happened in the next 10 minutes. Angele could no longer wait, so he opened his eyes.\u2018I should be more patient, I guess,\u2019 Angele rubbed his chin and started to think.\u2018Even the chip couldn\u2019t catch any energy signal in the air. This is going to take a while, I guess. Wait, I have the enchanted ring. The chip can absorb and store the radiation energy. If I have another enchanted item, I can probably release its energy around me and I\u2019ll become a stage 2 apprentice,\u2019 Angele kept thinking.\u2018However, the process of searching for the energy is probably the whole purpose of this training. My foundation in the basics will not be solid if I try this gimmick. Well, I guess I\u2019ll stick with the proper method.\u2019 Angele felt a bit disappointed, so he sighed. He closed his eyes and started to meditate again.Anyway, Angele could still utilize enchanted items even without reaching stage 2, so he was happy about it. If he had an enchanted item, he would be safer in any environment. There were just too many things he had no idea aboutThe next day, Angele was woken up by frantic footsteps. He heard people speaking of Nancy and Ali fighting on the ship deck.\u2018Nancy?\u2019 Angele knew it was the girl whom Adolf had talked about and the person who would help him out on the galleon. She was the daughter of a duke.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Angele got up quickly and put on his clothes. He locked the door and followed the others to the stairs. He saw everyone running to the deck on the way. It looked like all of them heard about the fight.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Angele asked Yuri while running.\u201cNancy and Ali are fighting. I heard that Ali had his eyes set on a girl and approached her in a\u2026 bad way. Nancy saw it unfold and they started to fight after trading remarks,\u201d Yuri answered while running as well.\u201cThey all have enchanted items, so we have to watch the fight,\u201d Lando Luc turned his head behind and said with an excited expression. Angele followed the crowd to the deck and saw Nancy\u2019s hands placed on her crossguard sword. Ali was standing opposite to her. Many wizard apprentices were watching the fight. Nancy, who still had her white suit and tight pants donned, stood on the ship deck with a serious expression with the wind blowing her ponytail up in the air.\u201cAli, take back what you just said, and I\u2019ll treat it like nothing happened,\u201d Nancy said.\u201cTake back my words? Ha,\u201d Ali said before laughing fearlessly. He looked fierce as he had a pair of long black daggers in his hands and was in his gold-white swordsman suit. Each had an eye-shaped ruby embedded in the blade and many complex patterns engraved on it. The daggers looked exceptional.\u201cNancy, we\u2019re on the sea. Duke Rocky won\u2019t be here for you. We\u2019re here because we\u2019re strong, but if you don\u2019t agree with the way of dealing with this girl, you must convince me using your power,\u201d Ali said with a loud voice, his pretty face having a tinge of arrogance on it.\u201cWith my power, huh?\u201d Nancy held her sword tight.\u201cAs you wish! ELVIN!\u201d After the utterance of the word, the bronze ring around her right hand\u2019s middle finger started shining. The light was white and too bright that Angele could barely open his eyes. Ali moved his hands and aimed the rubies on his daggers at Nancy.\u201cMAKASA!\u201d The rubies started to shine and began to look as though there were two bloody eyeballs. Nancy lowered her body and rushed toward Ali. Ali raised his daggers and rushed to meet with Nancy\u2019s offense head-on. When they collided, they began trading countless strikes. Angele could only hear a light metal hitting noise and saw red and white lights flashing in front of his sight.After a second, Angele saw Nancy\u2019s sword placed right beside Ali\u2019s neck. A barely visible thin barrier around Ali\u2019s neck was hindering the blade from advancing, but Nancy\u2019s left shoulder was injured. Angele could see blood flowing out of the part stabbed by the daggers.\u201cYou win.\u201d Ali smiled before he pushed the sword away from his neck.\u201cI take back my words. That girl is yours,\u201d he said while pointing at a girl who was sitting on the ground at the side. She looked beautiful with her short hair.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Nancy (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeNancy looked at him before returning her sword back into its sheath slowly.\u201cI just don\u2019t like the way you deal with the girl. I\u2019m done with you.\u201d Nancy was seemingly calm, and then she started to walk toward Angele. Angele was standing in the crowd while feeling a bit confused.\u201cYou,\u201d Nancy said as she pointed at him.\u201cCome help me tend my wounds,\u201d she continued to say while maintaining a calm demeanor. It was as though she was talking to an old friend.\u201cMe?\u201d Angele pointed at himself to make sure Nancy was talking to him. Suddenly, he saw a lot of blood oozing out of Ali\u2019s mouth. It seemed that Ali\u2019s organs had been injured during the fight, making Angele realize that Nancy wasn\u2019t the only one who got hurt. Though he didn\u2019t like the way Nancy approached him, he still decided to step forward due to her relationship with Master Adolf.People around weren\u2019t surprised because everyone witnessed Nancy talking to Angele when they first met. Nancy walked into the cabin with Angele following her. Wizard apprentices weren\u2019t allowed to bring maids with them, so they had to do everything by themselves. Nancy trusted Angele because he was one of Adolf\u2019s students like her. They went into the dark staircase. Nancy could barely stand properly, almost falling down. Angele grabbed her uninjured shoulder to prevent her from falling down the stairs.\u201cHelp me get to my room. He poisoned his dagger.\u201d Nancy, who had a pale face, gritted her teeth. Angele finally realized how serious her wound was. When she faced Ali, she was trying her utmost not to show vulnerability. Angele decided to help her first, so he took her back to her room. Nancy was sweating buckets when they walked down to the 1st floor. After reaching the room, she opened the door slowly. Angele assisted her to sit on a chair.\u201cYou can leave now,\u201d Nancy said with a weak voice. Angele scrunched his eyebrows; he could smell the strange stench coming from Nancy\u2019s left shoulder.\u201cThe poison on the dagger originated from the Snake Root Flower. If you handle it erroneously, you\u2019ll be paralyzed for days. By then, Ali can do whatever he wants to you,\u201d Angele said. He had confirmed the source of the poison after smelling some spiciness from the stench. Nancy\u2019s expression abruptly changed after hearing Angele\u2019s words and quickly grabbed a small leather pouch from the drawer. She took out a little paper bag out of the pouch and opened it carefully. There was some light yellow powder inside. When Angele saw the powder, it immediately reminded him of some data he had stored on the chip before.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Angele quickly stepped forward, but he blacked out before he could even finish speaking.Angele woke up with a silver crossguard sword held against his neck. Nancy was coldly glaring at him. The blade already made contact with his skin, a thin line of blood slowly trickling down his neck. Angele felt his hair all over his body raising and he could feel the pain coming from his neck. He was already at knight level and had decent attributes among the knights, yet he didn\u2019t have enough time to react after seeing that powder. She must have used her enchanted item to catch Angele off-guard. Zero couldn\u2019t help him under such occasion.\u201cWait, the dagger actually had mixed poisons on it. One thing I could distinguish is the poison from the Bolan Grass. If you don\u2019t deal with it within five hours, your whole left arm will be rendered unusable. I\u2019m just trying to warn you about it, so don\u2019t get too angry.\u201d Angele raised his hands and slowly pushed the sword away.\u201cThe man in the black robe wouldn\u2019t allow murder on this galleon. Besides, losing a left arm is probably nothing to a wizard,\u201d he continued. Nancy let Angele push her sword away, sheathing the sword right after. She was still staring at him coldly as though she wasn\u2019t too concerned about what Angele was saying. She decided to pour all the powder into her mouth.\u201cUniversal antidote? Your premium item probably has the root of Gerro in it, but it will only slow down the mixed poison from spreading.\u201d Angele smiled, \u201cYou still need to give up your left arm.\u201d This made Nancy\u2019s expression change again, thus forcing her to swallow all the powder with some water.\u201cDo you have the cure? I can forgive your rude behavior if you do,\u201d Nancy spoke emotionlessly.\u201cEven if I do have it, why should I?\u201d Angele had an evil smile on his face.\u201cYour father, Karl Rio, lives at Marua Harbor now, right? You also have an aunt there,\u201d Nancy said.\u201cI don\u2019t think you have the right to refuse,\u201d she continued.\u201cThreatening me?\u201d Angele spoke as he squinted his eyes.\u201cI probably won\u2019t win a fight against you, but I can opt to not help you,\u201d he continued.\u201cNo. One. Shall. Threaten. Me!\u201d Angele said this word for word while glaring into Nancy\u2019s eyes. Their gazes intersected for a while. Then, Angele stood up after deciding to leave.\u201cYou\u2019re going to lose your arm. Oh, wait. Also, enjoy being paralyzed for three days. You might die from excessive blood loss,\u201d Angele said while opening the door.\u201cWait! What do you want? Just tell me,\u201d Nancy said as she stopped him. Angele turned around and looked at her again.\u201cBeg me for it,\u201d Angele said while looking at her with an amused expression.\u201cYou\u2019re dead!\u201d Nancy grabbed her sword again. Angele knew how serious she was, so he decided not to further anger her.\u201cJust a joke. However, I really don\u2019t like the way you talk to me. I\u2019m not your servant,\u201d Angele said when he ceased smiling. Nancy slowly put down her sword after hearing his words.\u201cFine, I apologize for my earlier remarks. Now tell me, what do you want?\u201d Nancy said. The paper bag that had the antidote in it was twisted broken in her hands as she tried to calm down.\u201cDon\u2019t say anything that\u2019s not going to happen. I\u2019ll talk to the man in the black robe if I have to,\u201d Nancy said.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to do anything about it. Last time, two apprentices fought each other on the ship deck. One had his leg broken while the other, his arm. They begged the man to heal them, but he did nothing. You think you\u2019re an exception?\u201d Angele saw through her lie right away.\u201cYou\u2019re testing my patience,\u201d Nancy said in a deep tone.\u201cGive me an enchanted item,\u201d Angele said.\u201cNo way!\u201d Nancy didn\u2019t even think about the offer.\u201cLosing your left arm it is.\u201d Angele turned back and tried to leave.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Nancy said. For the second time, Angele felt a pain in his neck.\u201cGive me the cure and I\u2019ll give you something in return. Otherwise, I\u2019ll kill you before I lose my arm.\u201d Nancy coldly glared at Angele while drawing her own sword slowly.\u201cYou have two enchanted items on you. I just want one of them.\u201d Angele was now barely smiling because he knew that she meant it. The girl had seen blood without a change in expression and behavior, thus confirming that she had killed someone before. He was just trying to get an enchanted item from her, but he didn\u2019t know how important they were to her.\u201cAgain, No way!\u201d Nancy said in a serious tone.\u201cMany people in my family sacrificed their own lives for them, so I can\u2019t just give one to you. You can\u2019t use it at your current level anyway. Instead, someone might just take it off your hand,\u201d she continued. There wasn\u2019t much Angele could do at present, and threatening her could put himself in danger.\u201cWell, what do you have for me then?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cTen Glass Gems, worth 10000 gold coins,\u201d Nancy answered right away.\u201cAside from that, can I at least have a look at your enchanted item? I\u2019ll stay in this room, just so I won\u2019t be able to take it away under your nose,\u201d Angele said.\u201cFine.\u201d Nancy thought for a while before she slowly nodded.\u201cDeal.\u201d Angele clapped his hands and smiled.\u201cI\u2019ll give you the cure before it is too late, but you need to go first,\u201d Angele said. Nancy nodded before taking out 10 small purple gems from the leather pouch. She then took out a silver necklace from her pocket. It seemed that the ring on her finger was just for decoration. Nancy put everything on her palm and handed them over to Angele.\u201cAlso, you need to swear that you won\u2019t harm me after I give you the cure,\u201d Angele added.\u201cThen you need to swear that the cure you\u2019ll give me will fully heal me,\u201d Nancy said.\u201cSure,\u201d Angele said before taking an oath to the gods upon their names. According to the rules of the wizards, one must never break promises after making an oath upon their full names. The worst a noble or a wizard could do was to break one\u2019s promises. Though Angele didn\u2019t believe in such a thing, he knew Nancy was a person who would keep promises. She could fight for a stranger just because of Ali\u2019s wrongdoings. Angele was just trying to take a look at the enchanted item. He wasn\u2019t going to take away anything important to her. Ten thousand gold coins were of a significant amount to Angele, but Nancy was the daughter of a duke, so she probably never cared.Meanwhile, Angele was a son of a baron who only had several thousands of people in his territory. The Andes Alliance was much larger than Rudin Empire, thus a duke\u2019s territory was probably the size of half a Rudin. She would\u2019ve had the power of a princess if she was a Rudin. Ten thousand gold coins were probably her allowance, so she wouldn\u2019t think too much of it.Angele decided to treat her after taking a look at enchanted items. He knew the certainty of him being able to cure her. He had tried those two plants back when he was traveling, and Zero assisted him to find the easiest way to detoxify. It was the reason why he was so certain that he had the cure. Angele had tried thousands of plants and insects before storing all the data on the chip. Zero analyzed the data and found various ways for Angele to detoxify. What he was about to do was one of the methods.However, he found Nancy being completely rude to him, thus he didn\u2019t like her. Angele decided to apply the most uncomfortable way to her.\u201cNow, lie down on the bed. Lie on your stomach, so I can have a look at your wound,\u201d Angele said with a light tone. The wound was behind her shoulder where the dagger had struck her in reverse. Nancy looked at him for a second before lying down on her stomach. She still had her hands on her sword, clearly signifying that she still didn\u2019t trust Angele too much.Angele saw her lying down and unwittingly took a glance at her butt. In her white tight pants, it looked quite nice and sexy. Angele could barely see any gaps between her slim, long legs. He stood by the bed for a while, feeling an urge to touch her legs. They were just too enticing for him. Angele wanted to see how Nancy would react if he suddenly touched her legs and butt. However, he decided not to after seeing the sword in her right hand.\u201cHurry up!\u201d Nancy got a bit nervous and said.Angele ceased staring at her body and started treating her wound quickly. He first spat some saliva over the wound and sprinkled some sawdust on it. The process was easy and fast, but it was too painful for the person being treated.\u201cIf this doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ll absolutely kill you,\u201d Nancy said while she was in pain after standing up. She didn\u2019t show her emotion on her face, but Angele knew how mad she currently was.\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Angele smiled. He threw the silver necklace to her.\u201cTake a rest and bandage your wound,\u201d Angele said as he opened the door.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Ramsoda (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter leaving Nancy\u2019s room, Angele took a deep breath. His smile was gone, now replaced with solemnness. He surveyed the passage; there were no other wizard apprentices around. He could only hear footsteps above him. Angele covered his wound on the neck with his collar and quickly descended the stairs.\u2018Zero, how much radiation energy did you absorb?\u2019 Angele asked.\u20181.35% from the necklace. The item\u2019s surface was perfectly secured, thus the energy stored in it was barely leaking,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018That\u2019s enough. She\u2019ll find out if we take too much,\u2019 Angele thought. By then, he had already arrived at the 5th floor. He just reached stage 1 not too long ago, so he didn\u2019t want to waste time after obtaining that energy from the enchanted item.\u2018Nancy won\u2019t be happy about this, but I don\u2019t really care whether she likes me or not. I don\u2019t even know when I\u2019ll return to the city. Master Adolf said the letters would only be shipped out with the newbie recruitment ship. It will take about four years for me to communicate to the ones in the city. By then, she would\u2019ve already forgotten about it,\u2019 Angele thought.He got back to his room quickly and locked the door. He was very excited, instantly taking out the book Adolf had given him. Angele turned to the page where he left last time. The content written on it wasn\u2019t about meditation. Instead, it was the author\u2019s biography. He needed to calm down because being excited wouldn\u2019t help him with meditation.\u2018However, I need to wait until I can sense the energy by myself. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to train my basic skills,\u2019 Angele thought. He knew just how crucial the basics were to him.**********************Fifteen days later, the galleon containing all the apprentices separated from the fleet, setting and turning its path toward land. It then stopped at a beach, and at that place, there was a man in a black robe waiting by the shore. He led the apprentices who were part of their respective organizations to someplace else. Ali, Nancy, and Jared left with them. Lando Luc left as well because the location of the organization he would be part of was here. The only ones who stayed on the ship were Angele, Yuri, and Velvet. When the ship departed once again, more than 10 wizard apprentices remained.The wind carried the fishy and salty stench of the ocean. The sunlight brought just enough heat to the deck. Angele could feel the transition between the chill from the wind after the warmth of the sunlight. The sunset made the whole world look golden. Quietly, Angele stood on the deck, watching the light beyond the horizon quietly disappearing. Yuri was by his side, standing there as well. Golden sunlight was reflected all over the waves around the galleon.\u201cThe galleon really is empty without them. I just don\u2019t see anyone around,\u201d Yuri said as he scratched his head.\u201cWe\u2019ll probably never see them again,\u201d Angele calmly said.\u201cTrue. I heard our destination is more than ten thousand kilometers away from here,\u201d Yuri said. He had mixed feelings about leaving his friend.\u201cWhich organization are you heading to? We probably have the same destination,\u201d Yuri asked.\u201cThe Ramsoda College,\u201d Angele answered.\u201cRamsoda College? Never heard of it\u2026\u201d Yuri was confused.\u201cIt\u2019s possible that you don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d They heard a girl\u2019s voice coming from behind. They turned around and saw Velvet walking toward them. She was wearing a white one piece and holding a long sword in her hand. Her black ponytail rustled in the air. Although she was breathing heavily since she had just finished training her sword skills, she still looked clean and pretty.\u201cThere are many secret Wizard organizations in this world, so there\u2019s no way for you to know all of them. Also, if it\u2019s a college, it could be an ancient name formerly used by that Wizard organization. It\u2019s quite likely that the organization already changed its name,\u201d she continued.\u201cYou\u2019re so knowledgeable,\u201d Yuri said while smiling.\u201cMy father\u2019s a wizard, and he told me a lot about this world. My destination is the Six Ring High Tower,\u201d Velvet spoke in a light tone.\u201cI\u2019m heading to White Tooth Castle, an organization settling at the White Tooth Highland. I heard it\u2019s a strong organization,\u201d Yuri said as he laughed. He was easy to approach even as a noble\u2019s child. He never paid much heed about fame or anything, and he was a very nice and honest person.\u201cWe\u2019re good as long as the man in a black robe knows about them,\u201d Angele said before he laughed.\u201cLando Luc told me that the Six Ring High Tower and the White Tooth Castle are at the same place. Even the man in a black robe told me to get off there as well. Since we\u2019re close to each other, we need to keep in touch and help each other if necessary,\u201d Angele continued.\u201cSure,\u201d Yuri said.\u201cAll of us who boarded the galleon are from Marua, so we need to unite after we get into a new environment,\u201d he continued before smiling happily.\u201cYou guys don\u2019t care that I only have a talent level of 1?\u201d Velvet bit her lips as she asked.\u201cTalent is just a base. It\u2019s not the most important thing to a wizard. We need to keep studying, research, and do whatever we can to imagine and create. That\u2019s what a wizard needs,\u201d Yuri said after his expression became solemn.\u201cIt\u2019s my grandfather\u2019s words. He\u2019s a wizard in White Tooth Castle,\u201d he continued.Velvet looked at him for a second before nodding. Tears had started forming in her eyes.\u2018Yuri is correct based on my current understanding of wizard. Talent may be the basic requirement, but it\u2019s not the most important. According to the book, talent itself will give me a good head start, but after that, I have to keep learning and researching. Knowledge is my power and my treasure. However, with a talent level of 1, it\u2019ll take Velvet tremendous amount of time to complete the basics and reach stage 3 by the age of 30 if everything goes as he plans,\u2019 Angele thought. He agreed with Yuri\u2019s points, but he wasn\u2019t sure if Yuri was just giving Velvet false hope.He didn\u2019t speak out his thoughts, only telling Velvet some kind words before going back inside the cabin. He ate some food on the 4th floor and returned to his room. Angele already sensed some trial of unknown energy particles last night, but he wasn\u2019t certain if that was the energy particle he wanted.Angele crossed his legs and sat on the bed. He closed his eyes and entered meditation. The crystal clock on the desk kept ticking. He had begun meditating at 6 o\u2019clock in the evening. Now, it was already 10 o\u2019clock in the evening. The room was dark, but suddenly, a speck of green light appeared near Angele\u2019s face. The speck of light was the size of a sesame seed that quickly went away. The speck of green light kept flickering, appearing and disappearing around Angele for about half an hour. Angele\u2019s eyelids were rapidly twitching, even starting to sweat. He woke up as soon as the green light completely disappeared, fatigue nearly overcoming him when he opened his eyes.\u201cFinally, I reached stage 2. My progression will become smoother after I become capable of sensing those energy particles. Now, I must help my body adapt to those radiation particles,\u201d Angele said.\u2018Zero, use the stored radiation energy and release it at a rate my body can handle.\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Mission commenced\u2026 Using the energy\u2026 it will take 271 hours 43 minutes and 12 seconds to consume all of it,\u2019 Zero replied.\u2018More than ten days? Great.\u2019 Angele nodded as he was satisfied with the result. When the chip finished intoning, some green light appeared on the surface of Angele\u2019s skin. It disappeared quickly and nothing happened after, but Angele knew the chip was still releasing radiation energy. He could feel the life energy coming from inside his body constantly. Like a small sun in his body, he could feel the warmth of it. Angele felt very comfortable as he could no longer feel the chill inside his room. There was a grass-like taste in his mouth and a refreshing feeling all around his body.\u201cPositive energy of the plants.\u201d Angele determined the source based on the knowledge learned from the book and Adolf. Only energy from the plants had such positive power. According to the wizardry book, the world was filled with basic energy particles in the air. The term for such energy that could help plants grow or heal had been coined Plant Energy by wizards. They also labeled different energy into two categories: Positive Energy and Negative Energy. The wizards had also discovered different types of energy particles and classified them based on their effects.The energy particles Angele absorbed from Nancy\u2019s necklace was definitely the Plant Energy; most of its effects were positive. Some of the plant particles, however, might have a negative impact such as destroying the balance of nature. There were just too many energy particles in the air, and the wizards hadn\u2019t understood each of them yet. Wizards had trouble proving the existence of negative energy particles until one of the wizards discovered the particles during his research hundreds of years ago.\u2018Zero, can you make a rating list for the radiation energies?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Please set the unit name and the equation,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Unit name: Degree. One degree of radiation energy is equivalent to the amount of energy produced by burning one match. Show me the stored energy amount using this equation,\u2019 Angele asked. Degree was the most common unit used by wizards and the equation itself came from the book. Angele set it as the universal unit to help the chip calculate the data for him properly.\u2018Calculation finished. 17.4 degrees of energy has been stored. Consumption is in progress,\u2019 Zero reported.Angele nodded with a satisfied look.\u2018At this rate, if I can get the radiation going for the next half-year, I\u2019ll be able to lead the particles into my body and make them circulate. It will be much faster than just following the steps listed in the book,\u2019 Angele thought as he did the calculations in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Ramsoda (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeTen more days later, the ship had once again stopped at another dock. Yuri disembarked together with Velvet and several other wizard apprentices. Just like last time, someone was waiting for them by the shore. Only four people were left on the galleon: Angele, the two other wizard apprentices, and the man in a black robe. After two days of sailing, the ship had finally arrived at the final destination, Aikenhain. The name Aikenhain meant \u2018where the sun rises\u2019.\u201cThis is the end of the route. Disembark now.\u201d The man in a black robe pressed a button on the side of the ship and the landing ladder was quickly lowered down to the dock.\u201cThere are two Wizard organizations here, Ramsoda College and Liliado\u2019s Cabin. You can follow the road signs for directions. They aren\u2019t too far from here, and the roads are safe,\u201d he said before leaving the three on the beach. He then embarked the ship once again and left the place right after.There was no one else on the beach aside from the three. It was early in the morning; the sand seemed shiny under the golden sunlight. Angele looked at the other two. He had no idea who they were, so he didn\u2019t say anything. He saw a path on the beach, probably built by the people who walked on it. There was a road sign in the tropical forest not too far from them. There, a man in a white robe stood there awaiting their arrival.Half an hour later\u2026Angele, along with the other two wizard apprentices, followed the man in a white robe to a humongous abandoned castle. The surface of the walls looked gross; it was dark gray and had green vines all over the walls. Several large, dark tree roots covered the surface of the road. From the sky, Angele could hear strange noises resounding throughout.\u201cThis is the Ramsoda College you\u2019re looking for. You two follow me,\u201d the man said with a light tone. Angele stood there, watching the others leave. He was on a stone bridge just outside the castle, standing on green mosses and cracked stone pieces. Angele walked forward and took out his enchanted ring carefully. He then put it down on a small stone platform by the left side of the entrance.Suddenly, a black crow flew over and stood on the platform while staring at the ring. It touched the ring with its claw.\u201cYoung man, it\u2019s a newcomer. New blood.\u201d The crow started talking with a voice that sounded deep but sharp as though it had a hand in its throat.\u201cMy name is Moroco, the watcher here. According to the rules, you can enter if you have the enchanted item. You\u2019re the first one here in recent years,\u201d the crow said as it turned to Angele; it was speaking in Anmag.\u201cNice meeting you, Master Watcher Moroco.\u201d Angele bowed to the crow and took the ring back, returning it to his necklace.\u201cI\u2019ll be entering now,\u201d he said before walking into the entrance. Angele heard the sound of the crow flying away behind him.The ancient castle looked as if it was modeled with sand. The walls and its passages had all been corroded by the wind with the passage of time. Tiny holes were all over the castle\u2019s body. Angele felt like he was walking into an ancient city in Egypt since the only color in his view was yellow. The wind blew away the dust on the ground into the air, and several dried leaves rolled around the corner with a few becoming stuck onto Angele\u2019s tall, black boots.\u201cYou\u2019re the new blood?\u201d A stranger\u2019s voice came from Angele\u2019s left. He looked over and saw a tall man standing in the corner. He was a gray-robed man who waved his hand toward Angele. The man had a wide shoulder and a messy hair. His face looked like a barbarian from some tale that made Angele think he wasn\u2019t a wizard.\u201cMaster Moroco informed us of your arrival. He said you have the trophy of our school?\u201d the man asked. Angele walked toward him quickly before nodding his head. He handed the ring over after pulling it off the necklace.\u201cFollow me, I\u2019ll bring you there. So many apprentices this year, more than 20, including you. However, you\u2019re the only one from overseas,\u201d the man said.\u201cYea? I thought this is the school?\u201d Angele looked around and noticed that they were the only ones here.\u201cHow can our school be built upon a ruin? Though we\u2019re now weaker than before, we still have a decent place. My name is Aluta, you can call me Alu. I\u2019m the guy that leads the new blood to the school,\u201d Alu said.\u201cMy name is Angele, you can just call me with that,\u201d Angele replied politely.\u201cWell, I\u2019m just an apprentice like you and only 14 years old,\u201d Alu said. He didn\u2019t like the way Angele spoke to him.14 years old\u2026Angele looked at Alu speechlessly. Alu didn\u2019t have a friendly look. He was about 2 meters tall and had wide shoulders, most likely weighing 150 kilograms. Alu had the size of two Angele\u2019s. His footsteps were quite heavy that Angele could see the holes on the ground created by his footsteps.\u201cAlright\u2026 Alu, right? Can I just call you that?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYea.\u201d Alu was pretty cold to him, still looking disappointed for some reason.They turned around several corners in the city before arriving at a small house. A tunnel leading underground was in the middle of the house. In front of them was a door made of black stone and had two yellow, diamond-shaped gems embedded in it, each having the size of a fist. Alu walked toward the door and did a strange gesture.\u201cAloda Sinba,\u201d he whispered. The door slowly opened, revealing to Angele the stairs leading underground. The underground tunnel was illuminated with torches placed on both sides of the walls. Alu quickly entered, and Angele followed from behind.The door closed right after they entered. The passage that was built using gray bricks looked old as it aged after its conception. The same material was used for the floor, but some of the bricks of the passage had now been cracked. The ground was constructed in such a way that it was completely organized without any uneven parts. The light from the torches dyed the whole place yellow. As the two walked together in the underground tunnel, a strange smell wafted from below, but Angele couldn\u2019t determine the source. It smelled like mold and sweet olive mixed together.\u201cYou\u2019re lucky that you\u2019re assigned to the same Master as mine. That\u2019s why I came to welcome you. We\u2019ll be \u2018classmates\u2019 after,\u201d Alu finally spoke after walking for a while.\u201cYea? Assigned? How do they do that exactly?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYea. They give the lists to the Masters and arrange the names in a random order to make everything fair,\u201d Alu explained.\u201cWe\u2019re going to meet Master now. Master will let you choose one course you\u2019re interested in at first. Not the freebies though, you must pay for that. Just a friendly reminder, think twice, it\u2019s important. If you want to choose another course by yourself, you\u2019ll have to spend some magic stones or exchange record points from completing missions,\u201d Alu continued.\u201cThank you.\u201d Angele was quite confused, but he knew Alu was trying to give him some tips so he kept them in mind. The conversation was cut off here before continuing forward. They went across the passage and turned left, reaching a hallway with several rooms on both sides after passing through two forked routes. There was a large, unopened door at the end of the dark hallway.Alu led Angele to the large door and knocked on it lightly.\u201cMaster, one new guy for you. I brought him here,\u201d he said.\u201cCome in.\u201d A hollow voice came from inside as the door slightly opened by itself. Alu pushed the door open and went inside the room together with Angele. The room looked like a normal study. A man in a black robe was standing between two big shelves filled with books. The man was reading a thick book.\u201cFor me? You mean assigned to me?\u201d Angele was surprised by the voice. He noticed that the \u2018man\u2019 sounded like a young girl. It was unexpected to him that it was a girl.\u201cYea,\u201d Alu answered. Suddenly, the candle lamp on the desk made an exploding noise.\u201cTake him to Freydoni, my time is up,\u201d she said.\u201cGot it,\u201d Alu said. Angele was so confused as he watched Alu walking out of the room. Still, he followed Alu from behind. He took one last glance at the girl in a black robe. The girl already had turned toward them with her head raised, so Angele got to see her face clearly.The \u2018girl\u2019 was actually an old woman who was smiling. Angele felt shocked and even scared at the fact that the woman didn\u2019t have her left eyeball. Instead, there was a bronze pocket watch embedded in the eye sockets. There was also a long scar across her face, and she looked like a patched-up doll. Without the sewing, she might even fall apart.Angele tried his best to calm down and turn around.\u2018I\u2019ll be learning from such a horrifying wizard? At least, she looked scary,\u2019 Angele thought. He had already witnessed a lot of murders as he once killed plenty himself, but he was still scared witless just by looking at her face.\u201cScary, eh? Master Liliana was severely injured during a spell experiment, so she now has this horrifying look,\u201d Alu explained after seeing Angele\u2019s expression.\u201cActually, she\u2019s very kind, and among others, she\u2019s the most patient teacher. She tries her best to explain everything clearly, though not many wizard apprentices attend her class,\u201d Alu continued, his tone sounding slightly sorrowful.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Angele tried to smile.The master looked like a body that was patched up, so he thought people would try whatever it takes to stay away from her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Magic (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele left the room together with Alu, walking down the tunnel once again. He began seeing people wearing gray robes walking to and fro, most of them greeting Alu. Some smiled and spoke with him while some just nodded their heads without speaking a word. After walking for about 100 meters, he faced a large, black wooden door in front of him.PONG!Alu knocked hard three times; the door opened a gap that would let one man pass through. Angele peeked through the gap and saw a huge underground cave inside.\u201cLet\u2019s go get your supplies first,\u201d Alu spoke with a low voice as he turned his head to Angele. Angele nodded, following Alu through the door.Angele felt much better after walking into the door. He saw a huge cave that would easily fit an aircraft carrier inside. There were many holes, passages through the wall that twisted around the cave. Angele could see people wearing gray and white robes there with some entering the holes. It was highly likely that those holes were entrances leading to other areas. A huge 3-level glass chandelier hung over in the middle of the cave; many oil lamps sat on each level. It was the only thing that illuminated the cave.\u201cThis way.\u201d Alu led Angele, who continued to follow from behind, toward the left.The ground wasn\u2019t decorated at all and the roads were made of stone. Everything had become light yellow-colored under the large chandelier. The two\u2019s shadows shook and dance on the bumpy walls, seemingly mysterious and strange. They entered another path once again and then walked into a hallway. There were several people waiting; all of them had people without robes by their sides.Alu talked to one of the men before taking Angele to wait at the end of the line. It took them several minutes to enter the door at the end of the hallway. Various types of linen bags and wooden barrels were inside the room. An old man who had a goatee was sitting behind a desk by the door, holding a feathered pen in his hand. On the desk were a small notebook, a candle stand, and an ink bottle.\u201cAlu, another one?\u201d the old asked after laughing.\u201cYea, he just arrived here today. He came here by ship, so it took him a long time to get here,\u201d Alu said with a smiling face.\u201cTell him your name, stage level, and talent level,\u201d Alu said to Angele after turning to him.\u201cAngele Rio, 15 years old, stage 1, talent level 2.\u201d Angele stepped forward after nodding.\u201cTalent level 2, better than nothing.\u201d The old man nodded, and he wrote down something on his notebook.\u201cYou got a trophy?\u201d the old man asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Angele said before handing over his ring to the old man.The old man scrutinized the ring, his expression changing several times. In the end, he had a piteous expression as though he was feeling sorry for the item.\u201cSuch a pity. Agility Boost Ring with a high-level spell. If it\u2019s complete, it will be considered as a mid-level enchanted item at least. It\u2019s from the past, at least 500 years old. We were still referred to as a college back then,\u201d the old man said.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll take the trophy. You\u2019ll be exempted in your entrance exam,\u201d he continued speaking as he grabbed a small gray pouch from the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s your basic pouch.\u201d The old man handed the gray pouch to Angele.\u201cThank you.\u201d Angele carefully received the pouch.\u201cOne gray apprentice robe, one stage 1 wizard apprentice badge, one emergency magic stone, and your wizard apprentice number card. Don\u2019t lose any of those. There\u2019s a clean spell enchanted on the robe. It will clean itself once a day. It costs ten thousand gold coins outside, so don\u2019t break it. Otherwise, you\u2019ll have to reimburse it using magic stones or record points,\u201d the old man said.\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Angele replied. Alu toured Angele to the dormitory area, classrooms, laboratories, gardens, and various places after obtaining the supply. He led Angele back to the first hallway after everything. Angele thought of how the whole school was akin to a secret base underground. It was huge and its depth was unknown to Angele.\u201cFirst course is free. Make sure you make it count. Take care, my job here is done.\u201d Alu shrugged his shoulders and left after. He disappeared at a corner by the end of the hallway.Angele took a deep breath before he walked to his new master\u2019s room and lightly knocked on the door.\u201cI\u2019m the new apprentice, Angele Rio. Master Liliana, may I come in?\u201d Angele asked politely.\u201cCome in, please.\u201d Liliana\u2019s voice still sounded like a young girl. The door opened by itself right away. Angele walked in and the door closed by itself. His new master was writing something on a paper using her black-feathered pen.\u201cHere for the free course?\u201d Liliana raised her head and asked. Angele saw her horrifying face once again, the bronze pocket watch embedded in her left eye still ticking.\u201cYes.\u201d Angele attempted to use the chip to analyze her attributes, but some unknown power hindered the chip from doing so.Liliana smiled. However, she looked like she was crying to Angele. She moved the items on the table, making an empty space. She then put several things on the desk, but Angele didn\u2019t know where they came from. From left to right, the items on the desk were: a red banana-like fruit, a fresh eyeball of some animal, and a black leather pouch.\u201cThe one on the left represents the basic shifting skill I\u2019m good at. The eyeball in the middle represents the fundamentals of advanced dissection skills, while the last one represents biology. These are the options I offer, you can choose one to learn for free. You have one minute to think about it,\u201d Liliana smiled as she said.Angele nodded. He started thinking while looking at the three items. Liliana didn\u2019t feel restless, only sitting there as she waited.\u201cOne minute,\u201d Liliana said. Angele hesitated for a second. With a serious look on his face, he placed his hand on the black pouch.\u201cI\u2019ll go with this one,\u201d Angele said while looking at his master. Suddenly, the pouch started shaking as a swarm of black insects came out of it. Angele became surprised, immediately drawing back his hands. The insects were black, looking like medium-sized roaches. The pouch was, but the number of insects came out of it was great. In just a short time, they were all over the desk.Angele\u2019s hand that made contact with the bag felt itchy. Liliana was still smiling toward Angele, whose face was pale. She took out a small mirror and placed it in front of him. From the mirror\u2019s reflection, Angele saw blisters all over his body; his arms, neck, and face all full of blisters. The blisters were large, shiny, and full of red pus.\u201cThat\u2019s your choice.\u201d His new master\u2019s smile looked mysterious. Angele touched his face with his hands, but he could only feel nothing, only the flatness, and smoothness of his face.Angele\u2019s face was pale; his mouth and nose stank. He saw a black human-like shadow in Liliana\u2019s right eye before he plunged into darkness. When he recovered his vision, he found himself in deep water. Though there was a white light over his head, he could see nothing around. It was dark and cold, even making Angele feel suffocated that he could barely breathe.Angele tried to reach the light above him, yet something was pulling down his feet as he sunk. He looked down only to see pure darkness. He felt like he would never come back if he kept sinking.\u2018It\u2019s an illusion\u2026\u2019 Angele kept convincing himself, but he couldn\u2019t stop the growing fear inside of him.\u201cYou should come back.\u201d Liliana\u2019s voice echoed in his ears.\u201cThe knowledge has been transferred into your brain. Go back and drink a potion that will help you stabilize your mind. This transfer spell has been harmful to you. Make sure you don\u2019t get any sequela,\u201d Liliana said.\u201cYou can go now,\u201d she said as she waved her hand.Angele, who was soaked in sweat, tried to calm down. He bowed and opened the door.Angele left right away. Recalling the transference, the first line of the knowledge in his brain said: Necromancy.******************The following days, Angele attended the free courses just like any other new wizard apprentices and went to the library after classes. He went to the sections open to stage 1 wizard apprentices. He focused on several different subjects such as Dissection, Neuroscience, Fundamentals of Negative Energy, Spell Models, Source of Mentality, and Fundamentals of Pharmacy, basic subjects, and many different languages. Angele could learn all of those for free.Angele finally understood the meaning of the word \u2018Ramsoda\u2019. In dragonish, it meant shadow and death. The most well-renowned researches the college had ever done were about necromancy and curses. The school had been considered to have the best shadow spells in the Wizard world.The free course he chose was Necromancy wherein the main focus lied in studying the negative energy\u2019s impact on living beings. It was the core of utilizing spells created from negative energy, which was something he must learn. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be able to build the model for the negative energy spells. This course was one of the most expensive courses in the school considering how dangerous researching negative energy was. Because of how high the expenditure would be for someone to take this course, Angele was thinking of trading Necromancy knowledge with other wizard apprentices.Angele learned the fundamentals of spell utilization from the basic spell model book. One had to use mentality to build the spell model and release the energy using a special method. Some spells even required certain materials as catalysts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Magic (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeMentality model was the engine. Elemental energy was the gas. Both combined together to produce other forms of energies. It was the most basic of all spells, and there were much to be researched on such as the different effects produced by different models, the loss between each transfer, the strength of the final result, and the necessary mentality strength in constructing the model. Those were the factors that determined the level a wizard apprentice or a wizard had in spell manipulation. Being able to use a spell didn\u2019t mean one could control it well as most of the existing spells had been further improved by numerous wizards from each successive generation in the past.Besides attending classes, Angele helped his master organize the laboratories, clean the spell room, and assist her in potion making. Also, he helped take care of the rare plants in the garden. However, Angele was progressing slowly, and there was only so much he could learn every day as his master only put a certain amount of content each day, though he could finish other works properly. It took Angele more than 4 months to be able to lead the energy particles into his body during meditation. Zero\u2019s radiation had doubled his speed.********************\u201cToday\u2019s 1st class is the Theory of Everything taught by Master Angelina,\u201d a girl said. She who had a long brown hair over her shoulders was sitting beside Angele.\u201cThe Theory of Everything is too difficult to understand. I always feel like I have no idea what she\u2019s saying,\u201d a black-haired boy said. He was wearing glasses and was sitting beside the girl. The three sat together at a corner, creating a small group just like other wizard apprentices in the school.\u201cAnsett, why is Master Angelina wearing a white robe, while other masters are wearing black?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cIt\u2019s based on their specialization, whether it\u2019s positive energy or negative energy,\u201d Ansett answered. She was an average-looking girl. However, with her long brown hair combined with a shapely body, it made her very attractive.\u201cMasters who specialize in positive energy wear white and masters who specialize in negative energy wear black. That\u2019s the rule. You came from overseas and you never heard of it?\u201d the boy with glasses asked.\u201cWe barely have any wizards there. How would I obtain information like this?\u201d Angele had the feeling similar to that of studying in a university on Earth. However, the students here had at least one magic stone with them while Angele had nothing. He didn\u2019t enroll in any other course except for the free one he had gotten at the beginning.Magic stones were the main currency here. It was a black mineral that had a crystal-like appearance, which contained special energy that could help boost mentality. Many wizard apprentices kept enrolling in courses, thus gaining a huge amount of knowledge. Angele became nervous because he knew wizard apprentices who had more knowledge would be likely able to use spells and even advance to become real Wizards. Knowledge also helped them construct more spell models. Wizard apprentices who had more knowledge would\u2019ve had more spells in their repertoire.The good thing was, enrolling in a course didn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t have to learn by themselves. Of course, their rate of comprehending the knowledge would\u2019ve had a similar speed to that of reading a book. With the exploitation of the chip, Angele could use to reach twice their speed. The problem was Angele didn\u2019t have any magic stone with him.\u201cAngele, you said you\u2019re very close to advancing to stage 2. Is that true?\u201d Ansett asked.\u201cYea, very close.\u201d Angele nodded. There was no point in concealing it. Any master could distinguish the wizard apprentices\u2019 stages just by looking at them. Only wizards could block information probing by setting up their own force fields.\u201cThat\u2019s fast\u2026 and yet, you\u2019re only 14,\u201d Ansett said, expressing admiration for him.\u201cI already spent a long time trying to reach stage 2. Now, I\u2019m just very close to it,\u201d Angele said. He would never tell them he had started meditating only a year ago.\u201cI\u2019m almost there, too,\u201d the boy with glasses calmly said.\u201cAngele, I remember you saying that you need a magic stone, right? I\u2019ve got an extra here when my family sent some to me. How about I give it to you and you help me with the course?\u201d he continued.\u201cExtra magic stone? Manas, are you sure about this?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cSure, your Theory of Everything is far better than mine. I need your help with that, and I have major problems with several basic structures,\u201d Manas said with a calm expression.\u201cI\u2019m not as talented as you guys, so I have to work harder,\u201d he continued.\u201cNo problem. I need magic stone anyway,\u201d Angele said. Trading was something common here. Wizards normally didn\u2019t develop deep relationships with others, though they loved trading objects. Wizard apprentices were like this too. Though magic stones were a very rare commodity to normal people Manas, who came from a large local family, could easily obtain them with his background.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a magic stone, too. I\u2019ll listen to your explanation together with Manas. I don\u2019t want to be left behind,\u201d Ansett said after hearing Manas\u2019s words. She wanted to keep up with the class. Angele smiled as he himself knew they couldn\u2019t jot down everything their masters taught. If they missed some notes, it would be very difficult for them to understand the material. The masters didn\u2019t care if the wizard apprentices understood the class or not because they were too busy with their own research. They were teaching only for the money the school had paid them, and they would leave the class right after they finished.Angele thought that trading his knowledge for magic stones was a great idea.\u201cManas, do you know how to obtain magic stones fast?\u201d he asked.\u201cYou can go accept some assignments given by the school and obtain record points after completion. The record points can be used to exchange magic stones and other items. You\u2019ll get one magic stone for one record point,\u201d Manas said.\u201cHowever, the assignments are difficult, so you need to think twice before accepting any of it. We need to reach stage 2 to be able to use enchanted items,\u201d he added. The three of them banded together not because they had close relationships to each other, but because they were the weakest wizard apprentices in their class. Manas was kind enough to tell Angele something like this. Angele could already lead the energy particles into his body, but he needed some herbs to make the Sensory Potion to assist him in reaching stage 2. He could also buy one from the school, but the problem lied in the number of magic stones needed for purchase.\u201cMaster Angele is here,\u201d Ansett spoke in a low voice as he sat properly. The wizard apprentices ceased talking and everyone had their gazes fall on the entrance of the classroom. A stunning blonde lady appeared, wearing a white robe with a gray wooden wand in hand. As she quickly walked inside the classroom, the wizard apprentices could see her blue eyes, hair all over her shoulders, and a smile on her face.\u201cI am Angelina. It\u2019s my pleasure in teaching you, future wizards. Let\u2019s not waste any time. I\u2019m going to teach you the plant section of the Theory of Everything. It doesn\u2019t matter what type of spells you use in the future. You\u2019ll need to understand different types of spells. Otherwise, you\u2019ll never learn the Spell Analysis skill,\u201d the lady said.\u201cMaster, we already learned some basic models about botanical spells. The problem is how to transfer the pure energy to the real world. I\u2019m wondering if you could demonstrate the process to us,\u201d someone said.\u201cMaster Angelina, you\u2019re the best botanical spell user in our school,\u201d he continued.\u201cVader, you sure know how to flatter people\u2026\u201d She shook her head as she looked at the wizard apprentice. Angele thought it was quite likely that she knew the one who was speaking from the way she was looking at him.\u201cIt\u2019s Vader, her younger brother. Master Angelina raised him since young, so they\u2019re more like mother and son,\u201d Ansett explained with a faintly discernible voice.\u201cYea.\u201d Angele nodded his head.\u201cSince Vader asked, I\u2019ll demonstrate one spell to you guys today,\u201d Angelina said.She smiled and raised her left hand up. Angele could see a black seed in the middle of her palm. Angelina dropped the seed to the ground and chanted,\u201cI control you, a new form of life.\u201dWith a few noises, the seed started sprouting as it quickly grew into a green sapling. It didn\u2019t cease there, still growing incessantly. The roots twisted with the vines as it kept ascending. At its topmost was a white bud.\u201cBloom.\u201d Angelina pointed her wand at the bud, and then the bud started to slowly bloom. In the middle of the flower, there was a shiny, white fleck. The white light it brought was gentle and warm.\u201cThe Light of Life, something that could make your wishes come true.\u201d Angelina smiled.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s a joke. I\u2019m just making it shine using the Botanical Light Spell. I tried my best to slow down its process,\u201d she continued.Angele sat in his seat watching the demonstrating, staring at the shining flower.\u201cA wonderful spell\u2026\u201d He praised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: The Cost (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeIn one minute, the strange flower that had the height of an average human blossomed. Angele was surprised by this scene. To him, it was really impressive. The wizard apprentices in the classroom started clapping, and Master Angelina waved her hand again. The light dot in the flower flew into the air, causing the plant below to wilt and die within a second. The whole thing fell apart and became a pile of black ash.\u201cThis spell is for increasing the growth rate of the plant to its maximum. It\u2019s actually a botanical spell that consumes negative energy. If anyone is interested, you can come and purchase the basic spell model from me. Of course, only I have the right to sell the spell model. If I find anyone trying to sell it privately, I will hang him,\u201d Angele said in a serious tone.Angele became nervous for a second. He planned on trading his knowledge about Necromancy for resources, but he didn\u2019t know about the \u2018copyright\u2019 issue beforehand. Thus, he had to abort his plan.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll just do my thing then. Meditating and earning magic stones are the top two priorities now,\u201d Angele said before shaking his head.*******************Half a year later\u2026Above the Ramsoda College.In the morning, a group of people in gray robes were slowly advancing along a path in the large forest. They had various weapons on them such as swords and bows, while some had short, black wooden wands in their hands. There were black cross insignias on the back of their robes \u2014 the insignia of Ramsoda College. One of them carried a white, wooden longbow on his back and a silver crossguard sword tied to his waist. It was Angele, who didn\u2019t look attractive with his short brown hair. He was surveying his surroundings consistently just like what other wizard apprentices in the group did.\u201cGreen, don\u2019t be so nervous. At least we\u2019re still in Ramsoda\u2019s territory, and people don\u2019t have the guts to invade us. They\u2019ll try to avoid us,\u201d a black-haired man said. He was about 20 years old and had a pair of green eyes.\u201cLast time I went on patrol, I got sneak attacked, and don\u2019t call me Green. I don\u2019t like it,\u201d Angele said as he smiled. Half a year ago, he joined the patrol squad, which had a monthly wage of one magic stone. He also tried to become familiar with the neighboring areas.Ramsoda College was located at a wasteland. There were barely any people around such that only numerous dangerous beasts inhabited the place. Even if people were strong enough, they would be randomly assaulted by a swarm of flies. That was the reason why there weren\u2019t many people living here, even those adventurous people. The patrol squad\u2019s mission was to prevent those dangerous animals from breaching the school perimeter. Though this didn\u2019t pay very well, Angele could witness real wizards and high stage wizard apprentices fight, even obtaining some experiences.\u201cAlert! Human-eating Lizards!\u201d one of the men at the front yelled.\u201cAlert! Watch out for weakness-focused attacks. Masha, get in defensive position.\u201d The black-haired man who was the leader started giving out orders with a serious expression on his face.\u201cGreen, use your bow. Andrew, assist Masha in defense. Get in your positions and watch out. Don\u2019t waste our antidotes,\u201d he continued yelling. The five got into formation and a huge lizard emerged from the bush in front of them. This lizard had a green skin that made it easily possible to camouflage. It was looking at the five with its brown eyes.\u201cOnly one. Take it out quickly.\u201d The black-haired man looked relieved.\u201cNarus!\u201d He cast a spell as he invoked the incantation, and dark light covered his body. He drew his short sword and rushed toward the lizard, stabbing his sword right at its head. Another wizard apprentice cast a spell to enhance the power of Angele\u2019s arrows, making the arrowheads shine with a strange dark light. The arrow flew out at a breakneck speed as Angele shot it right toward the lizard\u2019s right eye.The sword and the arrow struck its head simultaneously, creating a huge hole in the middle of its head and the arrow piercing its eye. The lizard\u2019s green blood started flowing to the ground; its wound started to rot quickly. A red laser came out of the short sword, killing the lizard right after. The black-haired man stepped back and reassembled with the team.\u201cAnother lizard came from outside. People around all know this is our territory,\u201d he said while shaking his head.\u201cI can extract some infective poison from it. I\u2019m recently doing a research on it. I think it is fine for me to have its body?\u201d the man asked.\u201cOne magic stone for each of us, and we\u2019ll let you have it,\u201d the girl who cast spell on Angele\u2019s arrow said.\u201cNo problem,\u201d the black-haired man said. This was a bonus for the patrol members. If they wanted something valuable from what they found, they must pay others. Angele smiled; he knew the magic stone would help him in the future. They needed to spend a lot of magic stones and record points every year. If he didn\u2019t get enough magic stone, he wouldn\u2019t be able to continue studying.Nothing else happened after this encounter, which was very normal for them. Angele finished his shift by noontime. He returned to his room in the school. It was a small room, having the same size of a dorm room back in the harbor school. The only thing special was the oil lamp on the wall. It had been said by some that the oil in it would never run out. In actuality, it was a spell cast by a real wizard to make it bring light to a room incessantly. Angele sat cross-legged on his bed and took out a small pouch which he poured its contents onto the bed. Five black crystals and a tiny red pearl were there. Angele took the pearl and stared at it for a while, but he didn\u2019t do anything to it.He played with the magic stones for a while before placing them back into the pouch carefully. He began meditating again. He was already a stage 2 wizard apprentice, and he was going for stage 3. Angele had earned enough magic stones in order to purchase the new meditation method from the school. After that, his progress became much smoother. However, it had begun slowing down a bit recently. The red pearl he looked at earlier was obtained from a Red Pearl Bird when he was on patrol duty. It was something he obtained by paying a lot. This pearl could help him in his meditation, but he could only use it once.He had trouble with meditation, so he wanted to use the pearl. Angele meditated for a while and asked Zero to show him his body condition.\u2018Zero, show me my body condition.\u2019\u2018Angele Rio: Strength 2.9. Agility 4.1. Stamina 3.5. Status: Healthy,\u2019 Zero reported quickly.\u2018Did you get enough data to show the mentality as numbers?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Yes. Your mentality could now be presented in a numerical format at any time you wish,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele collected a lot of data to make it possible because he wanted to measure the strength of other wizard apprentices and wizards.\u2018Show me my mentality,\u2019 Angele asked with a serious expression on his face.\u2018Database created. Comparing data. Initiating\u2026\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Angele Rio: Mentality 3.1.\u2019 Zero gave the result within a mere moment.\u20183.1\u2026 Zero, show me the requirements needed to reach stage 3,\u2019 Angele asked after thinking for a while.\u2018Mission created, collecting data\u2026 finished. Model created, simulations beginning\u2026\u2019 Zero created a slowly rotating, light blue human body model in front of Angele. Inside the model, there were many silver lines flowing.\u2018Analysis initiated\u2026 Most optimal plan: Reach 6.0 in Mentality. Comprehend more than two spell models. 500 ml of Black Lead Potion. Success rate: 79.43%,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Your mentality is not being gathered. Analyzing\u2026 Please focus on increasing the density of your mentality,\u2019 Zero warned.\u2018I knew it!\u2019 Angele thought before he smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: The Cost (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe best function of the chip was that it could analyze known data and give Angele the optimal plan. It could even list all the requirements and calculate its success rate. This function was extremely valuable to Angele. Many wizard apprentices had to spend a huge amount of time searching for the reason of their progress being hindered and must check the issue many times to confirm its authenticity. If they made any mistakes during the process, they would waste too much time and money, and they wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with the set timeframe. No matter how talented one was, one had to discover the correct path by oneself.Angele could find out in time the reason for his progress slowing down due to the chip he had. He kept advancing and wasted no time. Those were all of his advantages.\u2018Increase my mentality points to 6 first, and then I\u2019ll buy two basic spell models. Training in the construction of the spell models will also help me increase my mentality. One model will cost me two magic stones. I can buy two right away. The problem lies with the 500 ml Black Lead Potion,\u2019 Angele thought.Black Lead Potion was made of special stones and ink. It could aid people in increasing their sensitivity, rendering the sensing of energy particles easier. It could also help people focus, but it had some side effects on the user\u2019s stamina. After using it, wizards or wizard apprentices needed to stay in bed for at least two days. The damage done to their stamina was permanent. It was one of the most effective low-level potions, but it had the worst side effect. If the chip didn\u2019t even mention it, Angele would\u2019ve never thought of using it.Angele sat cross-legged on his bed. He considered his following plan carefully before he got up. He wiped the dust off his gray robe and tied the pouch to his waist. He then opened the door and left his room.More than 10 minutes later\u2026Angele stood in front of a huge stone wall with his head raised high to check the price list. Several other wizard apprentices in gray robes were around him staring at the list as well. There were about 30 people there, but no one made any noise. They just stood there and quietly looked at the stone wall. After some time, a few would leave and a few would join.\u2018I took the Necromancy course for free from Master Liliana, and it was one of the basics required for using spells with negative energy. If I want to go for the spells with positive energy now, I\u2019ll have to purchase new basic knowledge. It\u2019s probably better for me to just stay with spells that use negative energy. One course will already cost me more than 10 magic stones, and that\u2019s just too much for me. I can save some resources by doing so, and I\u2019ll even progress faster.\u201d Angele made up his mind and started checking the courses listed under the negative energy category.Only three basic negative energy spell models were currently open:1. Poisonous Cloud: Paid course. Necromancy and Basics of Negative Energy2. The Hand of Exhaustion: Paid course. Necromancy and Neuroscience3. Stun Spell: Paid course. Advanced Dissection and NeuroscienceAngele looked at the options and started thinking.Basic spells models were the simplest models that most wizard apprentices could learn. As for improved advanced spell models, wizards would often keep them a secret. The same spell could\u2019ve differing effects when different wizards used it. The spell duration, effect radius, casting speed, casting distance, the weaknesses, and the damage done by stun effects might all be different. The basic models were the only spell models wizard apprentices could purchase. They were easy to understand and had practical uses in certain situations.Angele kept thinking for a while before deciding which one to buy. He walked toward a small window by the side, right when the wizard apprentice in front of him just finished his own activity.\u201cWhich one you want?\u201d Inside the window, an old man with white eyebrows asked.\u201cThe Hand of Exhaustion and the Stun Spell from the negative energy category.\u201d Angele took out his magic stones and handed them over to the old man.\u201cThat will be four magic stones, alright.\u201d The old man nodded and took the magic stones from Angele\u2019s hands. He then gave Angele two leather-covered books, and Angele saw the names of the spells on the books. Angele took the book and kept it inside his pouch.\u201cHey, Angele,\u201d someone called his name from the side. Angele looked over only to see Manas, who was also wearing his gray robe and was quickly walking toward him. He saw Ansett following Manas at the back and found her looking at him with a strange expression.\u201cYou came here for spell models?\u201d Ansett asked. Learning spell models meant Angele had been progressing fast as a stage 2 wizard apprentice. Meanwhile, she was still a mere stage 1 wizard apprentice. She and Manas were just checking out the spells, not expecting for Angele to buy spells from the store. Manas wasn\u2019t good enough to learn the spell models yet. If he tried to draw the spell model without sufficient comprehension on it, he would only get hurt.The three of them started together, and yet Angele was progressing much faster than the two. Manas and Ansett both had mixed feelings about this.\u201cYea. I think I\u2019ll start constructing spell models, so I decided to buy two basic ones. How about you, Manas? I think you\u2019re nearly at that point as well.\u201d Angele heard Ansett asking, so he answered.\u201cNot yet. I need more time. I want the Hand of Mage spell, but I need to finish learning the Energy Cycle and the Force Field Transformation first. I have enough mentality, but\u2026\u201d he said as he slightly raised his eyebrows. It looked like there wasn\u2019t much he could do about it.\u201cWell, just don\u2019t get frustrated. Make sure you\u2019re fully prepared,\u201d Ansett said. She was trying to remind Angele about the importance of comprehending the spell models before starting.\u201cI know. I won\u2019t start constructing them before I could understand everything.\u201d Angele nodded and smiled.\u201cSigh\u2026 I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll be able to reach stage 3\u2026 People with talent level like us will spend at least three years for it. I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s possible for me to become a wizard,\u201d Manas said.\u201cDo you know Bell Mini? He was promoted several days ago. He\u2019s now a wizard and he\u2019s only 19 years old\u2026 He was in our class\u2026 The Mini Family has all those resources for him to use and has a wizard in his family to guide him. The only thing we could do was to ask other talented wizard apprentices\u2026\u201d he continued.\u201cHe\u2019s from one of the three largest families. Of course, he\u2019ll be faster than us. His talent level was improved by using advanced wizard technologies and was much stronger than us from the beginning,\u201d Ansett muttered. Angele finally knew why they were so upset. It was too difficult for stage 2 and 3 wizard apprentices to reach the wizard level, and the possibility of becoming one was most likely just 1 out of 50. It meant most of the apprentices would stay at stage 3 their whole lives. Then, they would just return to their hometowns or choose to stay at the school to contribute in other ways. The old man with white eyebrows was at stage 3. A long time had already passed after reaching that stage. He had tried breaking past his limits multiple times, but he never succeeded. Many people had similar circumstances with the old man in this school.There were less than 50 Wizards in the school, but ever since Angele arrived at this people, he had never seen the president. Angele\u2019s situation was different because he had the chip. Before breaking the limit, the chip would help him formulate the most optimal plan. If the possibility of success was too low, he could keep studying until the success rate increased.\u201cI have to go see my master now. I\u2019ll see you guys in the evening.\u201d Angele talked to them for a while before leaving.\u201cSee you.\u201d The two left after bidding farewell.Several minutes later.In a dark room of the Negative Energy Research Center.Many strange runes were engraved on the ground and many complex magic arrays were drawn on them. The ground was black while everything on it was silver. There was a square stone platform in the middle of the room, and an old lady with a bronze pocket watch embedded in her left eye was standing beside it with a staff in her hand. She was pouring some white dust over the platform carefully.A ray of yellow light descended from the hole above them, making the whole room illuminated. Angele stood by the door, waiting for his master to summon him. There was another apprentice inside the room, though he only looked at Angele once. He just kept watching the things Master Liliana was doing.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d the man asked with a light voice.\u201cMe?\u201d Liliana poured all the dust onto the platform before raising her head.\u201cDo whatever you want. It\u2019s your own choice,\u201d she said while staring at the man in a gray robe.\u201cUnderstood, I\u2019ll leave now, Mother.\u201d The man bowed and left after.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Liliana finally looked at Angele and asked.\u201cYou\u2019re one of my students?\u201d She didn\u2019t seem to remember him.\u201cYes, Master Liliana. I was accepted in the school last year,\u201d Angele introduced himself after stepping forward.\u201cTell me what you want. I\u2019m busy,\u201d she said.\u201cI would like to ask about the Black Lead Potion,\u201d Angele politely said.\u201cBlack Lead Potion? Its side effect is the worst. Don\u2019t tell me you want to drink some?\u201d Liliana seemed surprised.\u201cYes, I would like to try it,\u201d Angele said.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to make and it\u2019s expensive. I have one in my storage, but you better prepare enough magic stones for it.\u201d Liliana began to smile.\u201cHow many?\u201d Angele asked in a low voice.\u201c120 regular ones or 12 mid-level ones,\u201d she answered.\u201c120\u2026\u201d Angele had already expected it to be expensive, but he was still surprised by the price tag. He could purchase some low-level enchanted items with 120 regular magic stones.\u201cIt\u2019s the best offer I could give. I already put a discount on it since you\u2019re my student. If you ask other masters, it\u2019ll cost you at least 200. You can check the price at the trading hall,\u201d she said.\u201cYou may leave now. My time is up.\u201d The bronze pocket watch in her eye ticked once. Angele took a deep breath, and then nodded his head. He turned back and left the room.\u2018What\u2019s the best way for me to earn magic stones\u2026?\u2019 Angele kept pondering over this question.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Mission (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele heard a beast-like roar coming from the room after he closed the door. He quickly left the place.\u2018This happens once a day. The sequela is really terrifying,\u2019 Angele thought as he shook his head.***************One month later\u2026Trading hall, underground.The place was completely crowded. Most of the people were looking at the stone wall. The mission information was displayed on the wall, and the information pages looked like paintings. The pages were automatically changing as though it was a slideshow. Most of the people here were wearing gray robes. Only several of them were wearing black and white. No one stayed near the ones in black, but Angele could see people greeting the ones in white.Some people were talking, while some were just staring at the mission information pages.\u201cLevel 3 mission! Is that even possible!\u201d a wizard apprentice yelled, and the hall became noisy.\u201cThis one has the best reward?\u201d someone asked.\u201cIt\u2019s level 3! Mary, shall we\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe leader is Khedira\u2026\u201d Several other wizard apprentices were discussing.Most of the people here were concerned about the leader. Even one of the male wizard apprentices in the corner also looked hesitant. Two wizard apprentices beside him started talking about Khedira.\u201cI can\u2019t believe the leader is Master Khedira. He had a talent level of 4, and last year, he became a wizard. He\u2019s one of the top wizard apprentices. How about joining the mission? The mission has no restrictions on the number of people and the reward is 50 magic stones per person,\u201d one of them said.\u201c50 magic stones\u2026 The mission must be very difficult. It has no number limit, so it means the mission is most likely not for young wizard apprentices like us,\u201d the other guy said as his expression changed.Angele was carefully listening to their conversations from the sidelines. He was trying to take some suitable missions to earn enough magic stones for the potion. The missions had decent rewards. Angele had already finished 3 of the easier missions this month, earning him 30 magic stones. However, he almost died during one of the missions. The information page stated that the main purpose of that mission was to check on some dying trees around the school. Angele joined a 5-man group for it. Four of them got injured, while one of them died. The reward for the missions was good, but all of them were risky.\u201c50 magic stones\u2026\u201d Angele muttered. He couldn\u2019t give up such a great opportunity to earn a decent amount of magic stones. Although he knew the mission was going to be dangerous, he thought he would do a good job at ranged attacks. Usually, a group protected the ranged attackers well. That was the reason why he survived the first several missions. Angele\u2019s arrow became more powerful when enchanted with spells that could buff its damage.\u2018I have Zero aiding me in the surveillance, and it can check a larger area than an average wizard apprentice could. I can easily escape a stage 3 wizard apprentice if he isn\u2019t too close to me,\u2019 Angele thought. He saw a young man in a black robe walking into the hall. The man had a handsome-looking face, but he had a cold expression on his face. He was about 1.8 meters tall, and in his hand was an even taller black staff.\u201cMy name is Khedira. Guys, an unfortunate event just happened 10 minutes ago under the Achslach Mountain.\u201d He lowered his head as he held his staff tightly. Angele could see his hands shaking from too much grip.\u201cMy younger brother, Asan, a genius stage 3 wizard apprentice from our school, just got killed after he completed the mission,\u201d he spoke in a very sorrowful tone.\u201cThis level 3 mission was announced by the masters after I begged them.\u201d Khedira raised his head, his eyes clearly emanating that of a person who dearly wished to exact vengeance.\u201cSomeone killed my brother! He was one of the best wizard apprentices in the Ramsoda College! He was the second inheritor of the Caesar Family!\u201d He glanced around the hall. Suddenly, his eyes began to gleam.\u201cNo matter whom the murderer is! I\u2019ll make him pay!\u201d he yelled, eyes looking red as it had been filled with bloodlust. Khedira quickly left the hall after saying these words.\u201cSomeone is provoking us!\u201d someone said with a deep voice.\u201cAsan died\u2026 The Caesar Family will send people there, too.\u201d\u201cIt could be infighting with their own family. I don\u2019t want to be part of this.\u201d\u201cTrue, the Caesar Family now\u2026\u201d People began discussing the situation.Angele stood in the corner, raising his head to take a final glance at the mission information page on the wall:Vengeance: Make whoever disrespected lives from Ramsoda pay for their sins!Basic Reward: 50 regular magic stones.Danger Level: High.Number Limitation: None.The words were written in red; whoever wrote it was seeking the life of the murderer. Angele stared at the page for a while, and then he made up his mind. He touched the silver crossguard sword by his waist before he disappeared into the dark hallway.**********************One month later.Abandoned Ancient City, above the Ramsoda College.It was early in the morning. Angele could barely see the rising sun. By the entrance of the city, a group of people was standing on the bridge. Some of them were wearing gray robes, while some were wearing black. All of them had black cross insignias on the back of their robes and all had their hoods on, covering most of their features. The man leading the group had a tall, black staff in his hand and a black pigeon standing on the man\u2019s right shoulder.The man knocked his staff on the ground, attracting everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cEveryone.\u201d the man had a deep voice.\u201cI\u2019m not going to mention how dangerous this mission is again. Please use whatever secret weapon you have. If we complete the mission, my family will double the reward,\u201d he continued.\u201cDouble? You have that many magic stones left?\u201d one of the men in black robes asked.\u201cHow do we know that you aren\u2019t lying to us?\u201d he asked.\u201cI know the Caesar Family has become weaker at present, but we\u2019re not short on magic stones,\u201d the leader said in a light tone.\u201cWe trust your promises, Wizard Khedira. Let\u2019s move then, don\u2019t waste any time,\u201d a wizard in a white robe said.The three were the only wizards in this group, while the rest were all wizard apprentices. They could only follow the three\u2019s plan. There were about 10 people in the group; most of them were very young. Angele was in the middle of the formation, carrying a metal bow on his back. He looked like an average wizard apprentice in the group.Three black carriages came to pick them up. The coachmen were three gnomes wearing gray linen clothes. They were too scared to look at the wizards and the wizard apprentices.They started to board the carriages. Angele chose the one in the middle. There were four other wizard apprentices riding in the same carriage as him, two females and two males.\u2018Zero, can you check the attributes of these people?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Within range. Checking\u2026 Information is being shown in front of you,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele closed his eyes before opening again. Everything in his vision was coated with some light blue color. He looked at a male wizard apprentice in front of him.\u201cGreetings, I am Angele. I\u2019m from the Faculty of Negative Energy. I\u2019m adept at ranged attacks. I think I\u2019ll later need your cover,\u201d Angele said as he smiled.\u201cSure. No worries. We should help each other. I\u2019m Andre from the Faculty of Mutation.\u201d The man looked surprised; it seemed that he wasn\u2019t used to communicating with others.\u2018Andre. Strength 0.9. Agility 1.1. Stamina 3.1. Mentality 4.7. Stage 2 Wizard Apprentice.\u2019 Andre\u2019s attributes showed up beside him. Angele then greeted the others, but all of them seemed slightly uncomfortable with conversing with others. Angele\u2019s purpose was to gain intel on their attributes. Without the protection of force fields, Zero could easily obtain data like this within a certain distance. People who joined mission like this were usually poor, but they were confident with their skills. Zero had even found an enchanted item on a girl named Marylin.Angele tried to start a conversation, but no one was in the mood to talk. Thus, he decided to stay silent. Everyone was at stage 2, though the girl named Marylin was probably the strongest in their group as she possessed an enchanted item. The rest of them were above average just like Angele.The other girl was called Griffia. Both of the two girls weren\u2019t very good looking. Marylin was slightly plump while Griffia looked sexy. Griffia attracted the eyes of the males in the carriage. Andre and Griffia had no special items on them. Their gray robes looked like it had been patched up several times already. It was clear that the cleaning spell on their robes was weakening.\u2018They\u2019re really poor,\u2019 Angele thought as he shook his head. However, he himself would also not spend 5 magic stones just for a new robe. He would rather spend 1 magic stone and ask a stage 3 wizard apprentice to fix it. That was probably what the two in front of him did.Half a month later.The carriages entered a small town by the school at night. Several noble-like people were patiently and politely waiting outside the town for them. They welcomed the group to the town and led them to a private manor. The group stayed for the night before they left, heading to the place where Asan got murdered.They traveled for another day and reached a canyon. It was a cloudy day, fog filling the valley.The ground had dying grasses all over. There were some green trees with small leaves around. Angele could barely see the mountains on both sides as they had been canopied by the fog. The stones that were quietly lying on the ground looked strange. Occasionally, small animals passed across the grass, making them noticeable due to the movements of the grasses. By the entrance of the valley, a group of swordsmen who were all wearing iron armors was waiting. A man from the group walked toward the man in a black robe. He seemed to be the leader of the group.\u201cMaster Khedira, you\u2019re here. We already blocked the whole valley such that not even a bird could escape,\u201d the man said.\u201cGood, keep guarding the entrance. We\u2019ll head in and deal with this,\u201d Khedira said as he nodded. The leader also nodded and took a glance on the people behind Khedira. He respected the wizards, but he also feared them.Angele became surprised when he checked the attributes of the leader. The leader was a top-level knight. After entering the valley, Angele stayed in the innermost middle part of the formation. He nocked a black-feathered arrow on his metal bow while scouting the surroundings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Mission (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe rest of the group stayed alert as well. Due to the members being used to walking on the road, no one complained about walking in the valley. Everyone was checking the surroundings. No one seemed to be tired from doing so. If typical noble children had joined missions like this, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle it.Clouds had completely filled the sky, and suddenly, the sound of thunder crackled. Khedira, who was leading the group, looked above.\u201cIt\u2019s going to rain. We\u2019re very close to our destination. Stay alert, everyone,\u201d he spoke after he turned his head around.\u201cYou two, please scout the surroundings. I\u2019ll track the murderer using my spell,\u201d Khedira said as he turned to the two wizards.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. You gave us the two items we wanted. We\u2019ll serve you well,\u201d the one in a black robe laughingly said. The white-robed wizard nodded his head but didn\u2019t say anything.After walking for a while, they reached a pit. Its depth was about half a meter and looked like a huge bowl; its surface actually looked very smooth.\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Khedira raised his hand, signaling the group to cease advancing.\u201cGet in your positions and stay alert. Make sure no one touches Khedira!\u201d the black-robed man yelled. The apprentices nodded in response before they formed an encircling formation with the three wizards in the center.Angele was standing inside the encirclement, holding his longbow. He utilized the sensory function of the chip to survey the area. He took a glance at Khedira. Khedira was holding his staff over his head and stood in the middle of the pit. Angele could see tiny tornados appearing under his feet, these wind gradually increasing in strength. The tornados ran into each other and surrounded Khedira. The grasses being uprooted and the branches being dragged from the ground began flying into the air. The sound of the wind howling gradually became louder as everything around was being drawn toward Khedira.This strange scene lasted more than 10 seconds before the gray tornados started weakening. Finally, Angele could once again see Khedira, who still held his staff over his head but had an exhausted demeanor.\u201cYou can\u2019t escape from me!\u201d Khedira yelled with a cruel expression showing on his face.\u201cEveryone, there\u2019s a tunnel on our left side. Our friends are hiding in there. Let\u2019s welcome these f*ckers\u2026\u201d he continued.From a tree close to the pit, a white-feathered arrow whistled toward Khedira after he finished speaking. A green silhouette jumped off the tree and ran into the forest after shooting the arrow. Before it could even reach Khedira\u2019s eye, the arrow ceased its movement in midair. An invisible barrier was protecting him.\u201cCome at me! You sons of bitches!\u201d Khedira yelled with a frightening expression.\u201cEveryone, there are 18 males, 5 females, and 8 kids. Those disgusting green f*ckers. I\u2019ll put their souls on the colorless crosses. Kill all adults and do whatever you want to the kids! It\u2019s fine if you want yourselves some elf slaves,\u201d he continued.Khedira grasped the arrow in the air and broke it into pieces. Angele saw a shining ring on Khedira\u2019s finger.\u201cElves? Don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re wood elves,\u201d Andre, who was standing beside Angele, said.\u201cThey\u2019re wood elves. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t murder Asan. Races other than them don\u2019t have the guts to do something like this,\u201d Griffia spoke in a low voice. They talked while following the wizards from behind, quickly walking toward the tunnel. They wouldn\u2019t bother too much with an average archer, but if the archer had superb skills, they would instantly change targets to the archer.\u201cColorless crosses? Damn, that\u2019ll make their souls suffer. The stronger their faith, the more they\u2019ll suffer. Master Khedira is completely enraged right now,\u201d one of the male wizard apprentices murmured.\u201cThere are elves living here?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cIn my country, they only exist in tales,\u201d he added.\u201cReally? Although there aren\u2019t many elves around, we catch several ones every year. I hope I can obtain some today. Elf slaves can be sold for a significant sum,\u201d Marylin excitedly said as she tightly gripped her wand. Others also had excited expressions. Angele made a conjecture about the wood elves having more worth than he had previously thought.The group quickly discovered the entrance to the tunnel. It was covered with some branches and dried grasses. Khedira stood by the entrance and glanced at the white-robed wizard beside him. As if they already had something planned, the wizard nodded his head and stepped forward. He raised his hand and pointed toward the dark cave as he started to cast a spell.Angele scrunched his eyebrows. He had never heard languages such as this. Only several languages could be used to cast spells, and Angele only knew two of the most common: Anmag and Advanced Elf Language. The wizard\u2019s incantations echoed in the valley. Fog began flowing out of his hand, spreading deep into the cave.Khedira didn\u2019t merely stay there and watch, he was whispering something to the pigeon on his shoulder. After touching the feather of the pigeon, it flew into the darkness.\u201cFound them. They only have one knight and an enchanted item. They haven\u2019t eaten for days,\u201d Khedira said and laughed after.\u201cThe Sleeping Fog will make those wood elves fall into slumber quickly. This seems like an easy mission to me,\u201d the white-robed wizard said in a ridiculing tone.\u201cTrue. The only thing we\u2026\u201d The black-robed wizard looked relieved as well.PONG!Suddenly, the white wizard\u2019s head splattered into pieces like a watermelon and blood spilled everywhere. Everyone became stunned at that scene. After wiping off the blood on his face with his hands, Khedira still hadn\u2019t figured out what had happened. Then, a strange voice casting a spell resounded from nowhere.\u201cKano! How dare you! You killed Kano!\u201d The black-robed wizard finally realized what happened, which caused his eyes to be filled with anger. He patted his chest with his head, white light began coming out of his eyes.\u201cCalm down! It\u2019s an illusion!\u201d Khedira struck the ground with his staff and cast a spell. Gray waves appeared under his feet and spread out, billowing across everyone. Angele, who stood in the middle of the formation, felt dizzy when the waves passed him. The scene ahead of them changed after they became clear-headed.Not too far away, he saw the white-robed wizard who had had his back against the wall and been surrounded by a white barrier. A tiny, green girl who had wings similar to a fly\u2019s was in the air flying around him, slapping the barrier several with her claws and laughing with a high-pitched voice.The girl was the size of a human head and wasn\u2019t wearing any clothes. She looked exactly like a human being but had a dark green skin. Her short hair was also green. Green liquid was dripping from her body, which had an irritating stench.Angele saw the grass corroded within seconds after it fell onto the ground. Some had even turned into black ashes after making contact with the liquid. It looked like it had been burnt to ashes.\u201cIt\u2019s the Green Spirit!\u201d Someone yelled after being able to successfully recognize the identity of the flying girl.The wizard apprentice then cast a spell toward the Green Spirit. Angele saw a white laser materializing out of the wizard apprentice\u2019s hand, hitting the Green Spirit\u2019s chest. However, Angele saw something that successfully blocked the attack. In front of the Green Spirit\u2019s chest, a piece of green ice had appeared before it fell to the ground after blocking the laser. Angele quickly shot an arrow right toward the Green Spirit, causing a hole to appear on her body. She kept laughing with her high-pitched voice, not caring about the injury in the slightest. The Green Spirit moved away from the wizard and flew toward the wizard apprentices. Seeing this, Angele knew they were in danger.\u2018Unknown particle approaching in high speed\u2026 Optimal plan: Step back and crouch,\u2019 Zero warned in time. Angele had no time to waste; he instantly stepped back and crouched.\u2018Unknown living being within range. Analyzing\u2026 Force field detected. Analysis failed. Danger. Please escape.\u2019 Zero kept reporting, but Angele had no time to listen to it. The wizard apprentices present in the scene were screaming in fear, including Andre.Angele glanced around. About 7 of them were struck by her claws in the face, causing them to fall to the ground while screaming. Only one blocked the attack with some sort of spell. Similar reaction to that of the grasses occurred to them and they turned to black ashes in seconds.\u201cAnya! I know it\u2019s you!\u201d Khedira yelled.\u201cHAHA!\u201d The Green Spirit kept laughing. After the first attack, she stopped attacking and instead flew to the left and landed on someone\u2019s shoulder. A black-robed lady suddenly appeared behind them. She wore a silver headband and had an attractive face and long blonde hair. The lady looked like a forest goddess. The Green Spirit stopped releasing the green liquid and sat on the lady\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI knew it\u2026\u201d Khedira\u2019s expression was ice-cold. The other two wizards who were standing behind him looked at the lady in fear.\u201cYou killed my brother?\u201d Khedira asked.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d The lady laughed without a care.The lady was a wizard, and similar to the other wizards, none of them cared about the dead wizard apprentices. Angele felt slightly uncomfortable as he looked at the ones who had survived the attack. Most of their faces were pale and they were hiding in the bush without making any movements.\u201cYou guys can leave now.\u201d Khedira talked with the lady for a while before saying that to the wizard apprentices. The wizard apprentices stood up with relieved expressions. They retreated carefully while staring at the lady. Angele walked away with them.The lady didn\u2019t even spare a glance at them, only talking with the three wizards. The wizard apprentices continued to retreat, only stopping when they could no longer see the four in their sights.\u201cThat woman can control the Green Spirit. Holy\u2026\u201d One of them said with a low voice.\u201cWhat should we do? Go back?\u201d Marylin held her wand tightly, clearly feeling scared.\u201cLet\u2019s wait for the master wizards,\u201d Angele said.After this, not a single one of them talked because of the shock they just experienced. This was the most dangerous situation Angele had ever encountered since he began taking missions. A single drop of the green liquid could turn him into ashes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Crisis (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cWe can\u2019t just dawdle here and wait. We need to help Khedira kill that woman. The Green Spirit is one of the best familiars in the Northland Alliance. Since she controls the spirit, she must be someone special,\u201d Marylin finally stood up as she said with a worried expression.\u201cYou can go. We\u2019ll stay here,\u201d one of the male wizard apprentices said. He absolutely didn\u2019t want to return to that place.\u201cYou clearly don\u2019t understand! If Khedira dies, we won\u2019t escape that woman\u2019s attack!\u201d Marylin yelled.\u201cBut if we go, we\u2019ll end up becoming a pile of ash!\u201d the male wizard apprentice answered.\u201cKhedira told us to leave because there\u2019s nothing we can do to help. Even if we go back, the situation won\u2019t change. I suggest we go back to the entrance and inform Khedira\u2019s knights of what happened,\u201d Griffia said with a calm demeanor.\u201cYea! I agree with that,\u201d the male wizard apprentice said.Angele never spoke, only standing there while listening to their exchange.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go to the entrance then,\u201d Marylin said. She began returning from the path whence they originally came while the rest of their group followed. In just a short span of time, they reached the entrance. What met their sights was the darkness that had begun covering the surroundings. The metal blockades were still there, however, none of the knights that were supposedly guarding the area was there. Even traces of battle were non-existent.\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Marylin asked. She had an enchanted item and was the strongest here; therefore, no one questioned her leadership in the group. They sought for clues around the entrance, yet they never found anything of use.Suddenly, a bird began hooting from somewhere. The wizard apprentices searched for the origin, only to see a snow-white owl standing on a stone edge of the mountain. With its narrow eyes, it was merely overseeing them. However, to the group, it felt as though it wasn\u2019t the owl that was watching them. A strange sensation surfaced within Angele as he looked at the owl. Without making anyone notice, he immediately took a black-feathered arrow from his quiver. He nocked the arrow on the bow and pulled the bowstring.\u201cWhite owl,\u201d This reminded Marylin of something, and she yelled in panic, \u201cNorthland Alliance! It\u2019s the wizards from Northland Alliance!\u201d\u201cHarryus!\u201d With a face that had already begun to pale, she cast a spell toward the owl with her wand. Marylin chanted, and a speck of green light appeared on the tip of her wand. A slime-like, green substance separated from the tip and became a fist-sized green sphere. She waved her wand; the ball shot toward the owl, thus creating a green arc in the air as it flew.Angele aimed right at the owl and loosened the bowstring, successfully launching the arrow. A silver dagger was thrown right toward it by someone at the exact moment Angele shot an arrow. The owl flapped its wings and began ascending. A small tornado suddenly appeared beside it, blocking and even pushing away the arrow and the dagger that successfully made their trajectories miss their target. Even the slime-like green sphere had been affected, causing it to fall onto a piece of stone beside the owl. At the place where the sphere landed, Angele could see green steam coming out of it.The owl hooted and flew into the valley before it turned at a corner and disappeared.\u201cWe have to go!\u201d Griffia yelled, gasping for air. It seemed that the dagger was hers to begin with.\u201cRetreat to the school,\u201d Angele said in a grave tone.\u201cThe guards here had already been killed. There\u2019s nothing we can do even if we stay,\u201d he continued. Apart from Marylin, who still wanted to say something, everyone else agreed with Angele\u2019s suggestion.\u201cWe don\u2019t give a damn whether you love Khedira or not, just don\u2019t get us killed!\u201d Griffia yelled. Marylin, whose face was pale, held her wand tightly in her hand. She bit her lips but ultimately didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s go. We already got detected by that owl. If we don\u2019t leave now, we\u2019ll all die. Angele decided not to waste time in other things, quickly taking out the map and finding the path back to their school. He began heading back to the school with others. No one bothered with Marylin anymore as she stood in place, unmoving.They walked for a long time but didn\u2019t see Marylin catching up to them. It seemed that she went back into the valley by herself. A large forest lied in between the valley and the school. If the wizards decided to chase them, their group wouldn\u2019t be able to escape. However, not even a person pursued them, and instead let them leave.It was nighttime. Everyone eased up a bit after making sure no one was tailing them. Originally, ten people were initially alive and kicking in their group, but now, only five remained. A campfire was lit; the light of the fire dyed Angele face red as he was reading the map beside it. He was trying to pinpoint their current location based on their initial route chosen. Others were also reading their maps.One of the male wizard apprentices poured something like black seeds around the campfire.\u201cWe should be around 10 days away from the school. I think we need to take night shifts to guard the camp in case wizards come after us,\u201d Griffia said with a low voice.\u201cIt\u2019s not a revenge mission anymore since Northland Alliance itself is involved. We must return to the school and report this,\u201d one of the female wizard apprentices said.\u201cIt seems like no one\u2019s tailing us, but they probably did it on purpose. They want us to send a message to our school. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t let us go,\u201d she continued. Angele and the other male wizard apprentice didn\u2019t speak upon hearing this.\u201cI poured some Flash Seeds around. If intruders breach within the 100-meter radius, it will explode and warn us.\u201d A male wizard apprentice sat down by the campfire, and said. He had been the one pouring those seeds.\u201cThank you, Orio.\u201d Griffia nodded.\u201cThere\u2019s still a long way to go. We need to make sure we have enough food and water,\u201d she continued.\u201cYea. There\u2019s a small town ahead, but we have to hunt before we reach that place,\u201d Orio said.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I used to hunt a lot when I was still with my family,\u201d the male wizard apprentice said. They stopped thinking about the wizards and started talking about other matters. Angele only sat there and listened, not even joining the conversation. He was busy checking the data the chip recorded from today\u2019s events, and he was arranging his personal data in order.Today, he was able to take a glimpse at the true prowess of a wizard. He thought that he wouldn\u2019t have the power to contend against a wizard given his current abilities. The chip could increase his chances of survival, but it wouldn\u2019t help in fighting against familiars like the Green Spirit.The fights between wizards all lied in their spells. If Khedira hadn\u2019t broken the illusion, their whole group would\u2019ve been completely decimated. Because of that, Angele finally saw the gap between a wizard and a wizard apprentice.\u2018I need to start constructing mentality models. With that, I\u2019ll at least be able to protect myself,\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Zero, simulate the process of constructing spell models,\u2019 he ordered.\u2018Mission created. Known spell models: 1. The Hand of Exhaustion. 2. The Stun Spell. Please choose,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele stood up and walked toward a nearby large tree. He sat down by the tree, causing others to think he was pondering over something. His line of sight remained at the direction of his fellow wizard apprentices, but he was actually communicating with the chip.\u2018I\u2019ll go with the Stun Spell,\u2019 Angele thought. He hadn\u2019t done anything else recently beside regular meditation. Anything related to the construction of spell models was left untouched. Before he could touch upon that subject, he had initially learned the complete fundamental knowledge necessary for the spell models. The courses for these fundamental subjects had been bought by him and stored on the chip. When Angele was traveling, most of his time was spent on revising and perfecting all the stored knowledge, and he tried his utmost to learn everything.Constructing the spell models required a lot of mentality. Once he failed in the process, the consumed mentality would be lost. Therefore, Angele had decided to be patient in delving into the construction of spell models. He thought the chip and his skills in archery would help him survive this mission, yet never did he expect to face such strong enemies.After seeing the battle between wizards, he began to realize how necessary it was to know a spell in order to counter other spells hostile to him. He completely comprehended the knowledge necessary for the two spells in his possession when their group reached the valley after fleeing. Angele had decided not to wait after they escaped. He wanted to at least be able to use one spell first. Also, he was very close to being promoted to stage 3; he looked forward to becoming a wizard in the future.\u2018Simulation initiated. 2 points of mentality will be consumed. Duration: 30 minutes.\u2019 Zero\u2019s mechanical voice echoed within Angele\u2019s mind.He leaned against the tree and pulled up his collar in order to cover his neck. The forest had long been wrapped in darkness. The strange noises created by insects could be heard.Angele opened his eyes and focused his sight on the grass. He started to see some thin blue lines forming various magic arrays right in front of his eyes. There were waves that only wizards could detect surrounding him, becoming stronger. However, the other wizard apprentices were unable to notice such changes. The magic arrays disappeared after half an hour\u2019s time had passed. Angele blinked his eyes after exerting such effort, so he felt relieved.\u2018Simulation completed. 2 points of mentality has been consumed. The model of Stun Spell has been constructed successfully. Every time you cast it, 1 point of mana and mentality will be consumed,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele had named the elemental particles in his body as mana, the energy wizards needed in casting spells.\u2018Check my current condition,\u2019 Angele ordered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: Crisis (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u2018Angele Rio: Strength 2.9. Agility 4.1. Stamina 3.7. Mentality 3.3. Mana 3.0 (Mana is contingent on Mentality). Status: Healthy,\u2019 Zero reported.Mana was a new attribute, which Angele had found before coining it with the term after reaching stage 2. This was the unit Angele had set for measuring energy particles \u2014 the particles stored on the chip and inside his body after reaching the new stage. He could store 3 degrees of energy in his body and more than 17 degrees on the chip. Angele had absorbed about 17 degrees of energy from Nancy\u2019s enchanted item, but he had yet to discover the maximum amount of energy he could store on the chip.\u20183 Mentality and 3 Mana must mean I can cast three basic spells,\u2019 Angele thought while the chip kept reporting.\u2018Listing the data of Stun Spell:Stun Spell (Basic) \u2013 Spell Level: 0Cost: 1 Mentality and 1 ManaEffect: Stun the target for a duration of 1 to 3 secondsEffective Distance: Within 1.5 metersYou need to cast it within 5 seconds. Otherwise, it will fail.Weak Point: If the target has high Stamina, the effect of the spell will be greatly reduced.\u2019 Zero reported.Level 0 spells had a basic-level spell model and could be learned by wizard apprentices. Wizards place different spells into different levels based on their cost, damage, and area-of-effect. There were several different levels upon which level 9 was the highest.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect for the process to be so fast. Now, I just need to practice more after the chip finished sending me the data. I can easily learn the whole because of the chip. If I didn\u2019t have it, I might have thought of going to spell laboratories to experiment only to fail no small number of times and waste a lot of mana and mentality. Sleeping is the only way to recover those. Most likely, I can only experiment in the laboratory for 2 or 3 times. No matter how smart a wizard apprentice is, he\u2019ll need at least 25 days just to learn a Level 0 Spell. I heard the record was set by Garman, Jr. of the Faculty of Enchantment.\u2019 Angele thought. The result was something he was already satisfied with.Angele didn\u2019t expect for the chip to show such a marvelous performance. He had been planning on going with it in a careful manner, even wanting to make sure he could use the spell before returning to the school. He never knew that he\u2019d be successful on the first attempt.\u2018Improve the spell structure?\u2019 Zero asked. Angele became surprised upon hearing this, not believing it was possible to do so.\u2018Improve the spell structure?\u2019 Zero asked again. Angele finally realized the capabilities of the chip, causing him no small amount of excitement to fill him at this moment.\u2018What\u2019s the requirement for it?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018It will cost you 14 Mentality, 14 Mana, 18 days 13 hours and 42 minutes. Currently, the requirement hasn\u2019t been met,\u2019 Zero answered.\u2018Why did you even ask then?\u2019 Angele felt a bit speechless.\u2018Will the 14 Mentality be consumed at once?\u2019 he asked.\u2018Yes,\u2019 Zero answered. Angele instantly abandoned this idea because he needed to increase his Mentality to over 14, something which was impossible for him right now. He needed to become a wizard first before he could improve the spell.After simulating the Stun Spell, Angele felt very tired. No one brought tents, so he had to sleep by the campfire. Angele calmed down for a bit before he began meditating by the campfire.The next morning.The five caught a few rabbits and squirrels in the forest. They finally caught some meat, but they didn\u2019t bring any salt, making it harder for them to eat. Normally, they would have decent food in the school. At this time, however, they had no choice but to bear with the tasteless food. After breakfast, they began traveling back to their again. The Ramsoda College was located in the middle of nowhere with only one small town nearby. After all, people wouldn\u2019t think of living near a school specializing in necromancy. On their way back, Angele\u2019s group of five didn\u2019t encounter any trouble. When they became hungry, they would hunt wild animals. As for quenching their thirst, their water supply was obtained from the rivers they passed by.Angele continued studying the information regarding fundamental knowledge on everything stored on his chip. He also learned the necessary information for the construction of his other spell model, the Hand of Exhaustion. He purchased the required course ahead of time and even stored everything on the chip. Angele had no time to read through the courses before, but now, he had some spare time to do so while on the road. He was planning on simulating the second spell model upon returning to the school.****************More than ten days later\u2026On the surface area of the Ramsoda College.The heat from the sunlight caused the ground to become burnt. The entirety of the abandoned city seemed golden under the sunlight. The wind was blowing the dust into the air. On the bridge, a group of wizard apprentices was walking. The one who led the group raised his head up to look at the city.\u201cFinally. We must report the situation immediately,\u201d he spoke in an excited tone. A black crow landed on the handrail and looked at the wizard apprentices. The crow didn\u2019t speak and only flew away. The wizard apprentice at the front was trying to say something, only to be hindered by the one behind him.\u201cDon\u2019t, Master Moroco won\u2019t care. He promised the president he would guard the entrance, but he never was one of us,\u201d the other wizard apprentice said.\u201cFine.\u201d The leading wizard apprentice nodded.Angele was at the back of their group with his face covered with dust and leaves. He followed the other wizard apprentices and reached the tunnels of the school. Angele and the other two male wizard apprentices walked to the door first, along with Griffia and the other girl following from behind.\u201cI\u2019ll inform Master Luas. He knows the assistant dean of the resource department. With him, he\u2019ll be able to quickly pass the information to the other masters. I hope Khedira made it out,\u201d Griffia said with a low voice.\u201cInform your masters about what happened in the valley. They\u2019ll share the information to other wizards,\u201d she continued.Angele and the others nodded in response. When he was heading to Master Liliana\u2019s study, he met a wizard apprentice named Yale, whom by a strange coincidence, was similarly a student of Master Liliana. There were many forked paths between the tunnels. Sometimes, there would even be a room with benches inside between the tunnels. People often used this for rest, and the room was usually connected to more than two tunnels. Angele and Yale entered one of those rooms, and they saw someone else coming from the other side.It was a white-robed man whose face was devoid of expression. A silver shoulder guard was on his left and also wore a large, white cape that covered his back.\u201cIt\u2019s Master Ur!\u201d Yale happily said.\u201cYale, it\u2019s you. I thought you\u2019re still on Khedira\u2019s mission?\u201d Ur asked.\u201cThis is what happened\u2026\u201d Yale walked toward Ur quickly and then told him everything. Angele stood by the side and listened. Master Ur Caesar was one of the top wizards in the school and was titled \u2018The Ice Mind Reader\u2019. As Yale reported the situation, Ur\u2019s expression changed, clearly understanding the severity of the situation.\u201cThe lady you encountered wore a silver headband and had a Green Spirit on her shoulder?\u201d Ur asked in a grim tone.\u201cYes, the Green Spirit killed 5 of us in a second! I would never forget!\u201d Yale answered.\u201cIt\u2019s the Northland Alliance,\u201d Ur said nervously.\u201cYou two, report the situation to President Kyler now. He should be around the trading hall. I\u2019ll check if Khedira\u2019s sign is still intact. If the sign disappears, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d Ur spoke in a worried tone.\u201cYes, Master Ur.\u201d Yale and Angele bowed before they walked toward the door. Ur looked at the two with a thoughtful expression. His eyes began gleaming, and he suddenly raised his right hand. There was a barely visible ball twisting in his palm.\u201cDamn! How dare you disrespect me!\u201d Ur\u2019s yells echoed.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ur yelled before reaching out to Angele. His hand became strangely huge, completely blocking the light inside the room. Both Angele and Yale became horrified because of that scene. What made it worse was that they had no idea why Ur was trying to hurt them. The words Ur had spoken were too unreasonable, but they had done nothing disrespectful against him.\u201cUr, they\u2019re my students!\u201d A high-pitched female voice came from behind, and an old woman suddenly appeared from their shadows. Two forces clashed against each other \u2014 darkness against frost. Many shadow-formed claws were flying toward Ur in the air, but the white, cold air around Ur froze the claws before breaking them into pieces.\u201cLiliana\u2026\u201d Ur had an apathetic look on his face. He looked at the horrible-looking old woman in fear as though he had no wish of fighting her.\u201cHuh!\u201d He lowered his hand, opened the wooden door, and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Tranquility (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cYou two, come to the study.\u201d Liliana\u2019s voice echoed in the room before disappearing into the shadows again. The room became still once again as though everything that had just occurred was but an illusion. Yet, Angele could still feel the coldness emanating from Ur. He looked at Yale only to see his shocked face.They walked down the passage that led to Liliana\u2019s study silently. No one had the mood to talk anymore. Master Liliana was one of the top wizards in Ramsoda College, but it wasn\u2019t due to her horrifying look. It would be fine for them to just report the situation to her.The study was devoid of light and heat. Angele and Yale stood by the door as they had already finished informing Liliana about everything they knew. Master Liliana didn\u2019t show any other particular expression apart from a thoughtful one. Time passed in silence inside the study.\u201cYou two can leave now. Let me handle this. The Northland Alliance really has nothing else to do,\u201d Liliana finally spoke after a while. She knocked on her desk several times and looked at the two.Angele and Yale had nothing else to say, so they carefully left the room and returned to their own dormitory. They had already passed the message. Apart from this, there wasn\u2019t much that they could do about the situation since they were merely wizard apprentices.Angele felt relieved after returning to his room. He took off his equipment and placed it on the floor, and then he lied down on the bed. He was extremely exhausted, so he stayed in his bed for a long time.\u201cI should be more careful when picking missions to take. High returns are always accompanied with high risks,\u201d he murmured.\u2018That was really a difficult mission. If the chip didn\u2019t warn me about the attack, I would\u2019ve become a pile of ash. I should have taken it slow. I\u2019ve been too greedy,\u2019 he thought as he shook his head. Angele got up and looked at the crystal clock. It was 2:15 p.m.\u2018My sword skills and archery was useless in the mission. Fights between wizards are focused on spells. If I want to use physical attacks, I\u2019ll have to break through their force fields first. I need to find a way to do it, but the Anti-Force Field spell can only be studied by wizards. I\u2019m only a stage 2 wizard apprentice. There\u2019s still a long way to go, but if I were to encounter a situation like this again, I\u2019ll need to find a way to protect myself. Ur Caesar and the Northland Wizards could kill me with a breath\u2026 Why did Ur attack us\u2026?\u2019 Angele thought. He sat on his bed with his legs crossed.\u2018I need to find a way to make myself stronger.\u2019 Angele began thinking again.\u2018High-level spells will be too much for me to handle. Enchanted items are too expensive. After reaching stage 3, I\u2019ll be able to learn more spells, but I need to somehow increase my mentality. What if I can use my sword skills during battle\u2026?\u2019 He suddenly remembered the first time he used the spell on the ring.\u2018The Agility Boost Ring\u2019s energy had already been fully absorbed by the chip, but something occurred after I spoke the incantation. It was like I cast a spell using the stored energy. How is that even possible? The burst of energy helped me cast a strong spell unconsciously?\u2019 Angele thought. He wanted to get to the root of what happened during the process.\u2018It\u2019s like I skipped several steps in casting that spell. Zero, can you find out how the auto-casting occurred?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Agility Boost\u2026 Analyzing\u2026 Conclusion: After the absorption of the energy of an enchanted item, the spell model on the ring had been stored on the chip as well. The spell can be auto-cast when necessary.\u2019 Zero reported.Angele was surprised for a second, and then finally understood what had happened.\u2018So the whole spell from the enchanted item will be stored on the chip? Does that apply to normal spells?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Yes.\u2019 Zero answered.\u2018It\u2019s actually very helpful if I have several enchanted items. However, I can store my learned spells on it and even instant cast them when necessary.\u2019 Angele scrunched his eyebrows as he thought.\u2018Find me a way to break the force fields using physical attacks.\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Mission established. Beginning analysis\u2026\u2019 Zero reported.Angele decided to leave the chip to its own devices and started meditating on his bed. After a while, his body started to shine, his skin and clothes all covered with green light. The green light illuminated for about half an hour before disappearing, and then some red spots of light appeared around him. These tiny red spots fell onto Angele\u2019s skin like the rain.\u2018Mission completed.\u2019 Zero suddenly reported. The red spots disappeared in the air and everything returned to normal as though nothing happened. Angele opened his eyes, red and green light still being reflected from his eyes.\u2018I chose the wind particles and fire particles when I reached stage 2. I used the other elemental particles to help lead these two types of particles into my body. I think I need to focus on studying one of them, though. It will be more efficient.\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Show me the result.\u2019 He asked.\u2018Plan A: Enchanted potions. Not restricted by the level of a wizard apprentice or a wizard, and has the capability of breaking some basic spells. With the help of your archery skill, you\u2019ll be able to injure a wizard, and an average wizard apprentice without enchanted items in possession won\u2019t be able to handle your attacks.Plan B: Obtain an elemental familiar. Some elemental familiars have special spell powers. They\u2019ll be able to block some spells for you.\u2019 Zero listed two plans in front of Angele\u2019s sight. Looking at the data of the two plans formulated by Zero, Angele scrunched his eyebrows.The second plan was practically unviable. Angele couldn\u2019t afford an elemental familiar since one cost more than a hundred magic stones. Therefore, he selected the first plan. Basic knowledge on Potion Study was free, and there were several tested formulas Angele could use. However, merely knowing the formula didn\u2019t mean he could actually concoct a potion.Potions were too difficult to concoct. In Ramsoda College, only two out of all wizards could concoct potions. Their success rate in potion concocting was about 40%, which was already very high compared to others. One would have a higher success rate if one had plenty of recourses.The steps in concocting potions were easy to follow. First, Angele would need enough mentality and enough control in mana usage. He also needed to learn all about the raw materials and how to deal with the occurring changes during the concoction process. However, he couldn\u2019t learn any of those from the masters because he still needed to try concocting by himself even if he had already learned the fundamentals. Experience was most vital in potion concoction.That was also the reason why potions were too expensive. The potions of lowest quality were worth at least 10 magic stones.\u2018If I can master the art of potion concocting, I\u2019ll be able to earn a lot more magic stones in comparison to taking missions. While an ordinary wizard doesn\u2019t have the assistance of the chip, I have the capability of using the raw materials with utmost efficiency with the help of Zero.\u2019 Angele thought. He wasn\u2019t certain if it was a good plan, but at the very least, he had hopes of making this work.\u2018Also, I hear that some potions could help increase my mentality. It\u2019s worth a shot.\u2019 Angele made the decision.\u2018First, I need to get my hands on a set of potion concocting equipment,\u2019 he thought.****************Twenty minutes later\u2026At the underground trading square.The trading square was the size of a football court. Many small wooden houses were built upon it, though they weren\u2019t too organized. Each house had a wooden board placed beside it with the list of goods and prices written on the board. Some wizard apprentices were moving from one house to another. Only one or two wizards were around.There were three wizard apprentices lined up in front of a wooden house by the left. Two of them were male, while the other one was a female. The male wizard apprentice in front of the line looked as though he was about 15 or 16 years old and had a strapping outlook. His shoulders were nearly covered by his brown hair, and it seemed that he hadn\u2019t had a haircut for a while.It was Angele, who was carefully looking at the goods on the shelves. This store only sold equipment for concocting potions, and everything here was being sold cheap. A set of potion concocting equipment only cost one magic stone. However, the materials and colors of the sets differed from one another as some were second-hand sets of equipment.The store owner was similarly a wizard apprentice who was about 30 years of age. He was currently sitting inside the house with his arms crossed and had an impatient look.\u201cYou can see the price on the board, one magic stone for each set. Leave if you\u2019re not buying. Just don\u2019t waste my time,\u201d the owner yelled. He never once saw a wizard apprentice becoming successful in learning the potion concoction, so he would his patience for those wizard apprentices every time. He had bought these sets of potion concocting equipment through special networks from the Potion Study students. The new sets kept becoming worse than the secondhand sets. Rich wizard apprentices would never buy items from him, anyway.Angele took a glance on the sets on the shelves, finally stopping his sight upon a secondhand set made of light red glasses.\u201cI\u2019ll take this one.\u201d Angele handed over a magic stone. The store owner grabbed the magic stone and threw it into the wooden basket under the shelves.\u201cHelp yourself,\u201d the owner said.\u201cSure. Wait, do you have raw materials for basic potions?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cOne magic stone per box. Each box has enough materials for you to practice concocting a Hemostasis Potion for about 10 times,\u201d the store owner answered right away. He clearly knew what wizard apprentices usually came here for.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: Tranquility (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cI\u2019ll take one please.\u201d Angele nodded as he put down another magic stone. The store owner looked at the magic stone before handing a black box to him.\u201cI\u2019ll take one, too,\u201d the male wizard apprentice standing beside Angele said. He was a blonde person who had an average face and narrow eyes. It seemed that he was about 20 years old.\u201cFailed again? Without someone teaching you, you\u2019re just wasting your money.\u201d The store owner looked at him and gave him a wooden box. The male wizard apprentice smiled but didn\u2019t bother responding. He took the box with him and placed down a magic stone. Only after he left did the female wizard apprentice behind him started browsing the store.Angele watched the male wizard apprentice leave with a thoughtful expression for a moment. Then, he carried everything back to his room. There were many faculties in the school, and for every faculty, about 20 wizard apprentices occupied it. The underground area was as vast as an average-sized city. Angele barely knew people from other faculties, only familiar with the ones in the same classes he attended. He heard stage 3 wizard apprentices studied in other areas. After that instance where Alu had shown him around the school, Angele hadn\u2019t seen him at all.Angele returned to his room with the items he had bought. Just after he sat down, someone knocked on his door.\u201cAngele, you there?\u201d Ansett\u2019s voice came from outside the door.\u201cYea.\u201d Angele stood up and opened the door.\u201cYour letter, from the White Tooth Castle,\u201d Ansett said, handing over a letter to him. She looked very attractive in her black hunting suit. Angele looked at the letter and saw that it was from Yuri.\u201cYuri\u2026 Thanks, Ansett.\u201d Angele remembered the blonde boy who liked smiling often.\u201cNo worries. You weren\u2019t here when the mailman came, so I received it for you,\u201d Ansett said. Her gaze fell on the potion concocting equipment as she closed the door.\u201cAngele, I heard you joined Khedira\u2019s mission?\u201d She sat on the chair gently.\u201cYea. I just got back. You heard about what happened there?\u201d Angele nodded. He sat on his bed, seeing that Ansett occupied the only chair inside the room.\u201cI heard your group encountered the wizards of the Northland Alliance. Is that true?\u201d Ansett asked. She was filled with curiosity, curiosity in everything related to wizards.\u201cYea. I think the mission report will be announced to the public in several days.\u201d Angele looked at Ansett, noticing that she had another motive for coming here.\u201cAngele, you reached stage 2 not too long ago, right? How are you progressing recently?\u201d Ansett asked but became flustered after noticing Angele\u2019s expression changing.\u201cSorry,\u201d she apologized. She knew how impolite it was to ask such a sensitive question. Wizard apprentices and wizards didn\u2019t like others probing them when it could breach their privacy.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Angele said. He knew Ansett well, but he became flabbergasted when Ansett suddenly asked him that kind of question.\u201cIf you need help, just ask.\u201d Angele would help her if he could since they were friends.\u201cI probably have to drop out of school\u2026\u201d While saying this, Ansett\u2019s expression changed.\u201cWhy?\u201d Angele asked in a surprised tone.\u201cI\u2019m still at stage 1. I don\u2019t even know when I\u2019ll be able to reach stage 2. My family wants me to return and get married,\u201d Ansett replied with a sorrowful demeanor.\u201cUnlike you and Manas, my talent level is just 1, and I\u2019m already 18 years old. It\u2019s most likely impossible for me to reach stage 3 before my 19th birthday. I\u2019ll never become a wizard if I can\u2019t reach stage 3 before 18 years old. I think you know how much money and resources we need just to stay in the school. There\u2019s no way I could pay the fees here by myself,\u201d Ansett spoke with a weak voice.\u201cSo\u2026 your family will no longer support you if you refuse to return?\u201d Angele asked as he scrunched his eyebrows. He wished to help, but there was nothing much he could help with in this kind of matter. Ansett wanted to reach stage 3 in a year\u2019s time and it had to be done by herself. Though Angele could impart to her his acquired knowledge, she still needed to learn and comprehend it by herself. Also, she, by herself, needed to find out how to lead energy particles into her body in order for her to reach stage 2.\u201cActually, if I can find someone who could help me support my family name\u2026 I\u2019ll be able to stay,\u201d Ansett said, depression apparent on her face. Angele remained silent but had his eyebrows scrunched.\u201cManas already has a fianc\u00e9e who has a higher talent level compared to mine.\u201d Ansett raised her head and looked at Angele.\u201cI\u2019m not going to get engaged with you. I\u2019ll return to my homeland in the future, so I can\u2019t promise you anything. Becoming my fianc\u00e9e won\u2019t do your family any good,\u201d Angele said.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to get married. Just tell everyone that I\u2019m your lover, and my family will then provide everything you need to become a wizard. You know I\u2019m from the Carter Family, one of the top 5 families in the school. I think should consider my offer,\u201d Ansett shook her head and said.\u201cYou\u2019re not the only wizard apprentice sent here by your family?\u201d After thinking for a second, Angele asked.\u201cYea, there are two more, but they\u2019re the same as me. There aren\u2019t that many wizard apprentices who can reach stage 3 before turning 18 years old,\u201d Ansett answered.\u201cWhy me?\u201d Angele wondered.\u201cYou\u2019re only 15 years old, yet you\u2019re about to reach stage 3 while Manas is still at stage 2. Furthermore, you survived such a dangerous mission. I think you\u2019re a suitable choice for me,\u201d Ansett said.\u201cSign the contract with me and take an oath, then I and another girl will belong to you. I can assure you the other girl is also\u2026 attractive,\u201d Ansett continued.Angele remained his sight on her. The offer she had given was something worthy to be considered for him. After all, he needed the support from a local family and he needed magic stones. He could also play with two attractive girls. This was definitely an offer that he had no reason to decline.\u201cThat\u2019s an attractive offer, but I\u2019m still wondering as to why you came to me,\u201d Angele said.\u201cYou are the most talented apprentice I know,\u201d Ansett said.\u201cOnly several wizard apprentices in our school reached stage 3 before the age of 15. You aren\u2019t the most talented one, but you can be considered to be one of the best wizard apprentices in Ramsoda College,\u201d she continued.\u201cI thought Alu reached stage 3 when he was 14,\u201d Angele said.\u201cHe\u2019s different. People like him had high-level wizards in their family increase their talent levels using special methods. We call them Blood Inheritors, but their children won\u2019t be as talented as they are. My family does not wish to have their children married to Blood Inheritors.\u201d Ansett shook her head.\u201cFine, I only see benefits in your offer. I\u2019ll sign the contract.\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cGreat! I\u2019ll be able to stay in school then.\u201d Ansett happily took out a contract from her pouch. She obviously had come prepared.\u201cThis is the contract. You can take a look.\u201d Ansett handed the contract over to Angele.\u201cYou\u2019re similarly signing contracts with other people, right? I mean others from your family.\u201d Angele checked the contract and found nothing suspicious.\u201cYea. There are many beautiful girls in other Wizard organizations that are from my family. If they can\u2019t reach a high stage, they\u2019ll try to marry the talented ones. You\u2019ve no idea how large my family is.\u201d Ansett nodded.\u201cHowever, you\u2019re the first in Ramsoda College. If you sign it now, I and another girl will move into your room tomorrow,\u201d Ansett said while blushing.\u201cCan you leave the contract here? I\u2019ll read it carefully tonight. I\u2019ll sign it tomorrow if I see no strange rules I need to follow.\u201d Angele waved the contract in the air.\u201cSure.\u201d With a relieved expression, Ansett bowed to Angele.\u201cI\u2019m counting on you.\u201d She drew nearer toward Angele and embraced him. Angele could feel it, her decent sized breasts.\u201cDon\u2019t make me wait,\u201d Ansett whispered. Angele became slightly aroused. He attempted to grope her butt, but she backed off right before his hand could reach it. She bowed again before leaving. Angele closed the door and placed the contract down while smiling.His thoughts still lingered on that arousing sensation of her soft breasts. Angele had been too occupied with his thoughts about the mission ever since he returned, but because of what had just transpired a moment ago, the thoughts about the mission was finally out of his mind. He calmed down and looked at the equipment on his desk before taking the chair and sitting down.Angele opened the black wooden box. Two different herbs were contained within it. The one on the left was a red herb called Dried Grass Root. The one on the right was a fruit that looked like an orange. Those fruits had been cut in half, showing contrasting colors of the light yellow surface and its bloody red inside. Both herbs were dried already.Angele set the equipment up. There was one retort bottle, one alembic, one glass conduit pipe, and several test tubes and beakers. They were placed in a large linen bag filled with cotton when Angele bought the set.He assembled everything on the desk.\u2018Zero, show me all the necessary data for potion concoction and simulate the crafting process of Hemostasis Potion,\u2019 Angele ordered.\u2018Mission initialized. Simulation initialized. Duration: 2 hours and 15 minutes. Success rate: 15%,\u2019 Zero reported.\u201815%.\u2019 Angele was satisfied with the success rate.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect it to be this easy. It\u2019s my first time simulating the concoction of a potion,\u2019 Angele thought.The success rate was calculated based on Angele\u2019s current mentality, mana, and other condition. With the assistance of the chip and a proper formula, Angele had a very high success rate. An average Potion Study wizard apprentice only had a 5% success rate, while Angele had a 15% success rate mainly due to the chip.The only thing he needed to do was to wait for the simulation result. The chip would enhance the success rate after the simulation finished. After that, he would be able to obtain an even higher success rate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Defection (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter two hours, Zero finished the simulation of the potion concoction process. Angele stood in front of the desk and measured the necessary amount of herbs in accordance with the results of the simulation. He put everything into the beaker and began heating it using an oil burner.The oil burner in this world was akin to the Bunsen burner on Earth, but it used oil as its fuel instead. The blue flame of the burner had a much higher temperature compared to normal oil lamps. Angele added some water into the beaker, which soaked everything inside, and then he covered the beaker with the lid. It took about 2 minutes for the water to boil, and the herbs inside had changed colors. The boiling water inside the beaker turned light purple as steam kept leaking out of the lid, thus causing the room to be filled with a sour smell.Angele silently watched over the beaker, occasionally checking the crystal clock on the side. He maintained calmness and silence such that the only sound that could be heard was the sound of the boiling water. Ten minutes later, Angele took some cotton from the bag and removed the lid off the beaker, causing the white steam to rise in the air.Angele stared at the liquid inside the beaker and ordered Zero to display the information of what was inside. The beaker turned into a blue hologram in the air with the data listed beside it. The data continuously changed, showing the temperature, changes, activities, and elemental shifts.Angele looked at the beaker carefully. Suddenly, he flicked his finger and a red object was shot into the water. Angele\u2019s lips were shaking as he kept invoking the incantation. His voice was sometimes high and sometimes deep. With the changes in his tone, the liquid inside the beaker began to change, and it suddenly stopped boiling. The bubbles and the steam disappeared slowly as well.No matter how strong the heat was, the surface of the liquid started freezing. This strange reaction lasted for about 10 minutes. Finally, the flames under the beaker extinguished by itself, and Angele stopped chanting. He bit his lips, scrunched his eyebrows, and stared at the beaker. The liquid inside it started boiling again, even the color stopped changing.\u201cDid I fail?\u201d Angele muttered. He grasped the beaker and dumped everything inside into the sink. The washroom and the toilet were separated into two sections in the room, and his desk was close to the washroom.\u2018Zero, tell me why I failed,\u2019 Angele ordered.\u2018Your mentality wasn\u2019t synthesizing with the materials\u2019 activities well,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Well, let\u2019s keep going,\u2019 Angele thought as he took a breath. He placed the beaker back on the oil burner.************************************In the evening, Angele held two test tubes filled with green liquid in his hands with a bitter smile on his face. Angele had spent 8 hours attempting to concoct the potions, yet he only succeeded twice out of ten attempts.\u201cA single Hemostasis Potion can be sold for more than 10 magic stones. I paid two magic stones for everything, but I can earn 20 magic stones, a 90% gross profit margin. Not bad at all. However, even with the assistance of the chip, I could only concoct two potions successfully.\u201d Angele murmured as he shook his head. He felt slightly disappointed, but he now knew the reason why potions were so rare.\u2018Good thing Zero is extremely helpful in tasks like this. This is my advantage, and if I continue learning, I\u2019ll earn a lot of magic stones with all the potions I concoct.\u2019 Angele spent the whole time concocting potions. At present, his mood was pretty good because of the fact that he wouldn\u2019t be worrying about magic stones soon.\u2018However, Ansett will come tomorrow, and she\u2019ll find out about this. It\u2019s impossible for an average wizard apprentice to have such a high success rate, so she\u2019ll try to spread rumors in order to increase the reputation of her family. I need to find another place for me to concoct potions. Should I just keep her out of my room or should I apply for a potion concocting station in the laboratory?\u2019 Angele thought.He shook his head. He needed to figure out a better plan and hide the two potions he had concocted. He never learned from a Potion Master, but he could already concoct potions. People might attempt to assassinate him just to obtain the formulas. Angele didn\u2019t want too much attention to be drawn to him. He wondered what might happen if someone were to discover his secret chip.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll just hide these potions for now and sell them at a later time. It takes years for a wizard apprentice to successfully concoct potions, and I\u2019ll need a ton of resources. Maybe I should wait for several years before showing others my potion concoction skills. I can keep practicing and try the formula for the mentality potion, but I must find a source to collect all the necessary materials,\u2019 Angele thought as he decided to conceal his potion concoction skills to others.Angele placed the two potions inside his pouch and started reading the contract Ansett had given him. No strange clauses were written on it, so he signed the contract right away. After signing the contract, he saw the letter sent by Yuri and opened it:\u2018Dear Angele, how\u2019s your life in Ramsoda? I hear your school is famous for Necromancy, and that it\u2019s a cruel place. I hope there are no skeletons or corpses interrupting your dreams during the night\u2026\u2019 Angele laughed as he read this, and continued along.\u2018I didn\u2019t expect for the White Tooth Castle to be in such a bad shape. I worked very hard just to get admitted only to discover that the organization\u2019s relationships with two other top organizations to be awful. Apparently, only you can receive my letter as the other letters I had sent had all gone missing. There are two large countries barring us, so I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t meet in a while. By the time you read this letter, I would\u2019ve already left the castle for a mission. In order to obtain resources here, there\u2019s no other way than to complete missions. I don\u2019t know where my next mission will be, but I hope that I will see you in the future.\u2019 The letter ended there, but suddenly, a silver dot appeared below the last line and drew a signature that says \u2018Yuri Safeco\u2019.\u2018Arcane Insignia.\u2019 Angele knew this trick that was particularly easy to do. Yuri merely left some energy particles on the paper, only revealing themselves upon meeting specific conditions. Any decent stage 1 or 2 wizard apprentices could do it. Angele closed the letter and returned it into the envelope. He sat by the desk and thought for a while before heading to bed.The next morning.Ansett knocked on Angele\u2019s door early.Angele opened his eyes and got off the bed still a bit sleepy. He looked at the crystal clock on the side and saw that it was 7 o\u2019clock in the morning. The problem he had in studying in an underground school was that he never knew if it was daytime or nighttime. Angele put his clothes on and opened the door.Ansett stood by the door with a smile on her face. Wizard apprentices were passing by in the hallway.\u201cDid I interrupt your sweet dream?\u201d Ansett looked at Angele as she asked. She stepped into the room and closed the door.\u201cDid you sign the contract?\u201d she asked.\u201cDone.\u201d Angele took the contract from the desk and handed it over.Ansett took the contract with a jubilant face. She was still wearing her tight hunting suit, but she had changed the leather pants into a short skirt. Her legs were long and slim, looking quite nicely in her long black boots.\u201cYou want me now?\u201d She latched herself into Angele\u2019s arms and stared at him from below. She also moved Angele\u2019s arms onto her breasts.\u201cI have a Reflection Course with Professor Vivian in a few minutes.\u201d Angele calmed down and said with a low voice.\u201cWe have more than enough time this evening,\u201d he continued. He reached his hands into Ansett\u2019s skirt and groped her butt several times.\u201cI knew you would choose the class over me. I like a man who can control himself.\u201d Ansett said as she smiled.\u201cThanks, I guess.\u201d Angele slightly pushed her away.**************************************************Ansett stayed in Angele\u2019s rooms for the night. Since their rooms had excellent noise isolation, no one heard them having sex. Angele awoke with complete satisfaction the next day, but he decided not to have sex often as he had much more important tasks to do. He joined many different classes.He attended and listened to several different lectures for the free courses in the next 10 days just like any other wizard apprentice. Angele went to the library to check the additional information he needed and also joined some spell laboratory to practice his spells. He was doing the tasks he must do and was also working hard to increase his mentality.As a wizard apprentice, Angele\u2019s talent level had been average, but he had the chip assisting him in memorizing and storing the knowledge he had learned. However, other wizard apprentices didn\u2019t have the chip, so they needed to invest more time into comprehending everything.Some wizard apprentices had to spend a whole month learning one language used for incantations, while some would need more than a year for it. Most of them had sufficient mentality and mana, but they failed reaching the next stage due to the lack of fundamental knowledge and they had trouble dealing with the changes which occurred during meditation. They clearly had no idea how to solve these problems, thus they were unable to reach the next stage.Angele spent his day doing the tasks any other wizard apprentice would, while he spent the night testing different potion formulas. With the chip\u2019s assistance, he already learned the second spell model. He hadn\u2019t shown off his achievements, but he had already become one of the top wizard apprentices in Ramsoda College.Angele could store the spell models on his chip and use them like a one-time enchanted item. However, Angele could only use the spells he learned and instantly cast them when necessary. No incantations were required; therefore the instant casting was faster than activating the enchanted items.Only wizards were capable of instant casting, but the chip could only store one learned spell model at a time. Angele once tried storing two, but the spells failed to combine, leaving only pure energy. Still, it was extremely helpful to Angele since it was as though he had something that could be used to store the spells.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Defection (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeBasic spell storage items cost 2000 magic stones in the market, but Angele needn\u2019t purchase any of those at present. The other girl came over one after Angele had signed the contract, but he wasn\u2019t too interested in her as he thought that having Ansett was enough. Furthermore, Ansett\u2019s family had already sent him plenty of magic stones, resources, and some paid courses. Angele was satisfied with what he received upon signing the contract. The only thing he needed to do was to show others that he was related to Ansett\u2019s family.Another half-month passed. Yet, Angele could only store the Stun Spell on his chip. The Hand of Exhaustion required Root Dust in supplementing the casting, and Angele couldn\u2019t simply store it on the chip.\u201cWhat! Manas defected to another organization?!\u201d Angele was so surprised that he stood up while eating. Other wizard apprentices looked over for a brief moment with unconcerned faces, checking if there was a commotion. Ansett had told him the news, but he himself had never thought of something like this happening.\u201cWell, it\u2019s true. It happened yesterday.\u201d Ansett seemed a bit despondent.\u201cHe defected with Ur Caesar, the \u2018Ice Mind Reader\u2019, and several others,\u201d she continued.\u201cWhat happened? He has no reason to do so.\u201d Angele inhaled once first before he slowly sat down.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I heard that all people related to Manas\u2019s family defected. Something big is going on, we just don\u2019t know it yet,\u201d Ansett said as she shook her head.\u201cA storm is coming.\u201d Angele\u2019s expression changed upon realizing something. Angele looked at Ansett, the girl whom he had a sexual relationship and had sex with occasionally. Ansett would rather spend more time meditating in order to reach stage 2. They were more than friends, but that was pretty much it.\u201cWhat do you think? I hear we\u2019re on the losing side against the Northland Alliance,\u201d Ansett asked in a low voice.\u201cHow about you?\u201d Angele asked back instead of answering her question. Angele hadn\u2019t spent too much time with Ansett since his purpose was to obtain resources from her family.\u201cI\u2019m afraid I have to return to my family. The situation here is making my parents worried,\u201d Ansett said.\u201cYou want to stay with me? I\u2019m going to apply for a position at Ramsoda Empire\u2019s border. I think the border is relatively safe. Only normal citizens live there and there are no important resources around that area, so wizards won\u2019t care too much about it. I don\u2019t think a war could change the situation at the border,\u201d Angele spoke in a faint voice.\u201cMe? I think I\u2019ll stay with my family. My parents, brothers, and sisters are all there. I\u2019m not going to leave them,\u201d Ansett answered after chuckling.\u201cYea?\u201d Angele stopped speaking. Both of them knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to visit each other in a long time if they decided to choose different paths. Based on the contract, Angele must help Ansett\u2019s family once he became a wizard, but such thing wouldn\u2019t seem to happen anytime soon. Ansett spoke about going back to her family without mentioning an ounce about the contract, which meant her family had already made the decision to terminate the contract with Angele.Ansett\u2019s conversation with Angele didn\u2019t involve anything about the contract. Angele could understand her underlying intent during the conversation. Her family was no longer going to support him anymore, and Angele didn\u2019t have to return anything the family had given him. The family wasn\u2019t going to wait for Angele to become a wizard due to the current situation of the school.\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want to stay with me?\u201d Angele asked again. Ansett hesitated for a second. She was weighing the pros and cons of each option she had. After a while, she shook her head thinking that going back to her family was still the better option.They finished their food in a silent manner before leaving the dining hall. Angele headed straight to his master\u2019s office after lunch. Master Liliana, who was wearing a black robe that completely covered her body, sat in the middle of the study. Angele saw that the door was open, and then a lady in a white robe exited the study.Angele bowed and glanced at her face. Seeing that she was wearing a white robe, she was definitely a wizard.The lady seemed lifeless. Her eyeshades were black; if she closed her eyes, it would look like there were two black holes as her eye sockets. There were many scars on her skin but instead of her scars having a pinkish red color, it looked like black rotten meat.\u2018A dead body that escaped its grave,\u2019 Angele thought. The lady didn\u2019t even look at Angele, only disappearing around the corner.\u201cAngele, right? Come in.\u201d Liliana\u2019s voice came from the room. Angele walked into the study and closed the door after hearing his master\u2019s words.\u201cThat was Wizard Christina, also a student of mine,\u201d Liliana said as she smiled, however, she looked even more terrifying after smiling.\u201cMaster, I\u2026\u201d Angele interrupted her.\u201cI know. You wish to go to the border, right? You\u2019re the 15th student to come here today with everyone having the same purpose as you. I only have 18 students, yet 15 of you want to leave the school.\u201d Liliana sighed.\u201cI knew you survived Khedira\u2019s mission and every day, the school\u2019s situation is becoming worse. I think your choice is right. Though there aren\u2019t many resources at the border, safety is guaranteed and you won\u2019t get involved in wizards\u2019 battles,\u201d she continued.\u201cThanks for your understanding, Master,\u201d Angele said as he lowered his head.\u201cThere are many countries around the border, which one do you want to go to? The ones close to the school? Like Ramsoda Empire? Or somewhere farther? Like Santiago?\u201d Liliana asked.\u201cRamsoda Empire, then. I might return here someday,\u201d Angele said.\u201cGood, but there are 24 provinces in Ramsoda Empire; most of the students applied to somewhere else. There are only two people who decided to go to Ramsoda Empire. You\u2019re the 3rd one. It\u2019s a huge country. I doubt you\u2019ll meet each other in the future. You\u2019re on your own out there. You need to obtain all the resources you need by yourself,\u201d Liliana said.\u201cAt least I don\u2019t need to return to my homeland. There\u2019s barely any magical resource overseas. Also, I\u2019ve earned enough magic stones, could you still sell the Black Lead Potion to me\u2026?\u201d Angele smiled, and he asked.\u201cSure, it\u2019s right here.\u201d Liliana smiled before taking out a small silver bottle from the drawer. Angele became ecstatic upon seeing this. He gave her one high-class magic stone. One high-class magic stone was equivalent to more than 10 mid-class magic stones, which was more than sufficient to but the Black Lead Potion. Angele bowed again after obtaining the potion.\u201cI\u2019ll talk to the guard so that they won\u2019t stop you from leaving. You can go now,\u201d Liliana said.\u201cThank you, Master.\u201d Angele bade his farewell before leaving the room.Angele felt a bit down. He joined the school not so long ago but had to leave now. He would need to search for resources by himself after. The good thing was, he had already stored all the information he needed on the chip. All the information had been obtained from Ansett\u2019s family, and it was enough for him until he became a wizard. However, he still needed to make plans for his future.If Angele reached stage 3, he could become a disciple of Master Liliana. He would then have free access to many things such as the Black Lead Potion. However, people like Angele were merely normal wizard apprentices who paid tuition fees in order to stay in the school. The school didn\u2019t give them too much attention, and the school wouldn\u2019t hinder them from leaving.\u201cLeaving the school could be good for me,\u201d Angele muttered as he walked down the hallway.\u2018Zero, how\u2019s my mentality?\u2019 he asked.\u2018Your Mentality is 3.4. You need 6 Mentality to reach the next stage,\u2019 Zero reported.\u201cI think I\u2019ll visit the market before I leave,\u201d Angele thought aloud.**********************************************The underground market.Many stores were already gone. Angele could no longer find the man who sold him the potion concocting equipment. There were fewer wizard apprentices checking around as well compared before. Six stores remained at the square. Silence loomed all over the place with the lack of people within the vicinity. The only thing Angele could hear was the noise coming from the wall torches.There was much garbage left on the stone ground. Angele could see cracked glass equipment, broken bronze rings, and torn apart gray robes. He could even see traces of blood on the ground. This made Angele scrunch his eyebrows as he walked in a small store. Several wizard apprentices were gossiping about the present situation in the school and the desertions.Angele decided not to listen, quickly walking into the store instead. He looked over the goods and took a small pouch with silver dust inside.\u201cPhosphorescence Powder, two magic stones.\u201d The owner was a wizard apprentice who had a goatee. Angele nodded before putting down two magic stone. He began browsing the inventory, intending to take everything he could because he didn\u2019t know when he was going to see a Wizard market like this again.Another wizard apprentice entered the store. It was the blonde boy he had seen last time. His features hadn\u2019t changed at all.\u201cOwner, I got something of value here, can you check and buy if you\u2019re interested in it?\u201d the blonde boy yelled.\u201cYou again. I told you last time, your items weren\u2019t valuable at all. I only gave you three magic stones because we have the same master,\u201d the owner answered with an annoyed expression.\u201cTake a look, please. Perhaps there\u2019s something you need.\u201d With a nervous face, the blonde boy opened his bag.\u201cI told you, I don\u2019t need anything related to Potion Study. There\u2019s barely anyone buying those things. I told you not to spend your magic stones like that. There\u2019s nothing more I can do for you now,\u201d the owner spoke kindly after calming down.\u2018Items related to Potion Study?\u2019 Angele thought.\u201cCan I take a look? I\u2019m looking for items related to potion concocting,\u201d Angele asked. He was now certain that it was the same blonde boy he had met at the time he was buying the potion concocting equipment.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d The blonde boy looked at Angele, and he asked.\u201cYea, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Angele still had around 5 magic stones, anyway. He had no other ways of using them when he leaves the school. Seeing that the blonde boy was trying to trade his items for magic stones or other materials, it could easily be speculated that the situation in the school was becoming worse, therefore causing him to have no time in studying potions anymore.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: The Journey (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cYou want them?\u201d The blonde boy looked happy.\u201cYou can have these in exchange for three magic stones.\u201d He handed over a bag. Taking the bag, Angele peeked at the contents inside. Several leather scrolls, some potion concocting equipment, and other random items were inside.\u201cA whole set of equipment? And the formulas?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYea, two formulas, and my equipment. Some are broken though,\u201d the boy answered right away. Angele took one of the scrolls and opened it. The title said, \u2018Awareness Potion\u2019.\u201cThis is an entry-level potion.\u201d Seeing this made Angele scrunch his eyebrows.\u201cAnd it\u2019s a formal entry-level formula. Not many people can craft this, I think?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cWell, you can put it into your\u2026 collection?\u201d The blonde boy looked nervous.\u201cYou know what, the school\u2019s already transporting the books out of the library for protection. You won\u2019t find any other formulas. I wrote my personal experiences on the two scrolls, too, so that\u2019ll improve your success rate for sure. Also, you\u2019ll find my notes much easier to understand than the information you can find in the library,\u201d the blonde boy kept explaining.Angele didn\u2019t want to waste time, so he read through the notes. The boy was indeed speaking the truth. It was entirely because Angele had already stored most of the information he could find in the library on the chip, and the blonde boy\u2019s notes included information he didn\u2019t know. The boy also added some helpful notes about the Awareness Potion.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll take these.\u201d Angele had no time to finish reading everything, so he placed the scrolls back inside the bag. He handed three magic stones to the blonde boy, causing the latter to become relieved.\u201cThanks. Wait, I think you\u2019re one of the departing wizard apprentices, right? You\u2019re a decent guy, I have a copy of the local map. I\u2019ll charge you only one magic stone for it, what do you think?\u201d The blonde boy lowered his voice as he asked.\u201cYou have a copy of the local map?\u201d Angele was surprised. He had been searching for a map ever since he first arrived in the school, but the only thing he found from the library was the information of the surrounding areas. He knew nothing else besides that, and now, the blonde boy was offering him a map. If the map was accurate, this would really be a great help to him.He could\u2019ve asked for a copy from Ansett\u2019s family, but the situation escalated too quickly.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Angele also lowered his voice as he asked back.\u201cI\u2019m sure.\u201d The blonde boy nodded his head.\u201cLet\u2019s find someplace else to talk.\u201d Angele led the blonde boy to a corner.Ten minutes later.Angele returned to his room with the bag and the map.Unlike before, the dormitory wasn\u2019t as noisy as before because there was barely anyone remaining. Most of the wizard apprentices were gone; Angele hadn\u2019t seen anyone else in such a big school. He lit the oil lamp and sat down in front of the desk. He then began reading the map.The middle of the map was the Ramsoda College marked with a big, red dot. Many hills and forests surrounded it. By the northern direction of Ramsoda College, there was another Wizard organization called Liliado\u2019s House, which controlled a vast area at the north.At the western direction of Ramsoda College, there was a sea that only had a single harbor. It was called \u2018Nick Dock\u2019, and written by its side were the words: \u2018Once every 4 years\u2019. The Ramsoda Empire was located in the eastern direction of the college with only one forest lying in between them. The map was easy to read as many routes were marked on the map.\u201cLiliado\u2019s House is north, the sea is west, Ramsoda Empire is east, and the mountains are south.\u201d Angele finally gained a general idea about the country\u2019s terrain and its different locations.Angele kept reading the map, but then, he scrunched his eyebrows. Apparently, the one who drew the map only knew of the situation around the school, and there were no details. The most valuable information were the two routes between Ramsoda College and Ramsoda Empire because Angele didn\u2019t know of it. He started searching through the information stored on the chip.\u2018The royalty here is pretty much controlled by wizard families. The wizards themselves are ruling the land. Countries with more resources will be controlled by stronger wizard organizations. If I want to lay low and live a decent life, I\u2019ll need to find a place that doesn\u2019t have many resources, but I still need the wizards. Otherwise, it will be difficult for me to become a wizard,\u2019 Angele thought. His finger was tracing around the map as he checked the route that would lead him to the Ramsoda Empire.\u2018I should head to the empire first, then go to the provinces that are close to the school. I need to find a quiet place. I hear the Ramsoda Empire has two neighbors, Northland Alliance and Janika Empire. Other countries barely have Wizard Rift, so the wizards didn\u2019t take any interest in them. I won\u2019t be able to buy any materials if I go there. I\u2019m not even sure if the area is similar to my homeland\u2026\u2019 Angele kept thinking.Wizard Rifts were places suitable for wizards to stay. Since these places were usually good for growing magic materials, wizards labeled those areas as Wizard Rifts. There were many materials in each Rift, and some of the stronger Wizard organizations monopolized and mined in those places. Wizard Rifts were also the restricted areas in the wizards\u2019 world.Angele learned everything from books. He understood why some places had a great number of wizards while some had little or no wizards, even causing the inhabitants in those places to think that wizards only appeared in legends. Wizard Rifts were the main reason for this. Wizard apprentices and wizards had to go to places that had the materials they needed. Otherwise, they would die without being promoted to a higher stage. In places that had good weather condition and various materials, many wizards lived here. Most of them barely had the need to travel to other areas, except for the hopeless wizard apprentices. They were everywhere.Angele confirmed the route and returned the map inside the bag. He took out the two scrolls he had bought and spread them on the desk.The first scroll was the Awareness Potion and the second was the Tranquility Potion. Both potions could aid people in increasing their mentality. The blonde boy was trying to increase his mentality by concocting the said potions. Many wizard apprentices had attempted to concoct these two potions, yet not many succeeded.An above average Potion Study wizard apprentice could make one potion using a large amount of materials, and this alone would already cost them 100 magic stones. However, the potions were only worth 20 magic stones. Just the cost already far surpassed the benefit it was supposed to give.Angele nodded his head in satisfaction from the items he had bought. He put the two scrolls inside the bag. Although he had already stored everything on the chip, he still wanted to keep the copies.Angele stood up and placed every important item he had on his desk. There were the maps, the formulas, his silver crossguard sword, his metal longbow and quiver, his chain claw, several poisoned daggers, the box containing the Dead Soul Grass, the wizard\u2019s book, the crystal dagger, the red pearl, two magic tones, and a small leather pouch containing around 20 Hemostasis Potions. These were all very important to him.He placed the survival tools and clothes onto the ground. There were some meat jerkies, two large bags of dried vegetables and fruits. These could keep him going for about three weeks.\u2018Three weeks\u2019 worth of supply is enough. I can hunt more if needed,\u2019 Angele thought before he started checking all his weapons.**********************************************The second morning, Angele woke up early and packed everything up. He left the school and reached the entrance of the abandoned city. There were several wizard apprentices selling horses there as they knew many people were leaving. Angele spent one magic stone to buy two strong horses and a bag of horse beans. He tied everything to the horses\u2019 saddles and leaped onto one of the horses. Just like the others, he quickly disappeared by the end of the road as he departed.Four days later\u2026It was raining and the clouds covered the sky.Two horses were galloping fast along a twisted path between the dark green forest. Under the gray sky, the sound of hooves stomping echoed throughout along with the sound of the wind blowing the tree leaves and the noise of the rain.A young man in a gray robe was riding one of the horses wherein the other one had a lot of luggage tied upon it. The bags were covered with gray linen to prevent them from being soaked.The young man had an average face and brown hair that flew about in the air due to the strong gust of wind. He had a crossguard sword tied to his waist and a black metal bow and quiver filled with black arrows carried on his back. The young man was wearing a tight black suit, looking very clean.The young man was Angele. It was already the fourth day on the road since he left the school and was on his way to the Ramsoda Empire. He continued along the path for another half-hour before slowing down and deciding to rest.Angele glanced around his surroundings while mounted on his horse, and then he took a black silk scarf out of the bag to wipe the water off his face.The chilling gust of wind mixed with the rain blew across his face. The two horses were galloping forward slowly. Yellow mud flew into the air from the impact of the hooves stomping on the ground. From Angele\u2019s left, he could hear people talking and he could smell the meat those people were grilling. He also heard the crackling noise created by the campfire.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: The Journey (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele turned his head around and peeked through the gaps in the trees. Two men wearing brown leather armor were grilling meat around the campfire. They also had a pot of white soup sitting by the side. Angele could smell the fragrance of the mushrooms from hundred meters away. As the two men heard the noises produced by the horses, they looked over to check.\u2018They\u2019re also leaving the school,\u2019 Angele assumed. He had met many wizard apprentices like then along the way, but he never greeted anyone of them. All of them had different destinations and they didn\u2019t know each other. Trusting others was a pointless task to them.Angele didn\u2019t stop as he continued to advance through the path slowly. He wanted to let the horses rest a bit. After a while, he increased the speed of the horses but suddenly heard someone coming toward him.Angele lowered his body on the back of his horse and looked at the road in front of him. A young man wearing a white leather armor mounted on a brown horse appeared. After seeing Angele, he became surprised but tried to hide his surprised by changing his expression before slowing down. Angele slowed down as well.\u201cCould you tell me how far the Nick Dock is from here?\u201d the man asked.\u201cWith your speed, you\u2019ll arrive in 5 or 6 days,\u201d Angele answered as he smiled. The man likewise smiled and nodded. Both of them started urging their horses to speed up again.Suddenly, Angele drew his sword. The sound of the sword being unsheathed scared the horses. Angele didn\u2019t hesitate to slash his sword toward the man, which caused the latter to fall to the ground and die in a second. Angele had cut his stomach open, dyeing the mud on the ground with blood.Angele looked at the body for a while and scrounged through it. He then turned back and left the places as fast as possible. He disappeared in the rain quickly.**************************************With a pale face, Angele put his crossguard sword back into the sheath and reached toward his back with his hand. He could feel the bleeding hole there. Angele took out a Hemostasis Potion and removed the wooden plug off the tube. He poured some onto his palm and applied it on the wound.Green steam rose out of it as the wound absorbed the fluid.\u201cThat guy was a rank 3 wizard apprentice. If I didn\u2019t hear him chanting, I\u2019d be dead already,\u201d Angele murmured. He still felt shocked as he tried recalling the appearance of the wizard apprentice he just killed. The wizard apprentice was wearing a white leather armor suit that had an insignia of a silver ring.\u2018It was a wizard apprentice of the Northland Alliance. I didn\u2019t know they were so close. It\u2019s likely that they are trying to surround the college. I need to leave,\u2019 Angele thought. He bit his lips and shook the reins.\u201cGiddy up!\u201d Angele yelled. The horse neighed and began galloping faster.**********************************The corpse of the man in a white armor suit was split in half and was lying on the muddy ground. The brown horse circled the corpse for a while before it left the place, heading to a certain location. The rain was becoming heavier. Around 20 minutes later, a man in a white robe appeared from the forest.The man seemed old and had no expression on his face. He walked toward the body and squatted by its side. He dipped his finger into the blood and put it on his tongue. He turned and stared at the route that led to the Ramsoda Empire.The man looked slightly disappointed, but he didn\u2019t speak, only standing up and wiping his hands.**********************************Angele was breathing heavily. He lowered his body on the back of his horse. He slowed down before stopping by the roadside after half an hour. He led the two horses into the forest and tied them to a tree. Angele sat down and applied some pressure to the wound using his hands.He just killed an enemy with but a mere second, but it wasn\u2019t as easy as it seemed. If he had hesitated for even half a second, he would\u2019ve been the one to die.\u2018Zero, did you identify which spell the man used?\u2019 Angele leaned against a tree before asking.\u2018The possibility of the spell being Launch Bolt is 92.7%. The weapon he used was a metal needle,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Launch bolt\u2026\u2019 Angele bitterly smiled as he checked the wound. It had already stopped bleeding a while ago. The Hemostasis Potion was a great help, but he needed to take out the needle out of the wound. Angele took off his clothes and began checking his wound. With a dagger in hand, he tried to use it to search for the needle.\u2018Zero, can you help me see my wound better?\u2019 Angele asked. Zero quickly showed his wound as a hologram in front of his sight, which helped Angele find the needle\u2019s location within a short span of time. The black, thin needle nearly penetrated his stomach.Angele bore the pain, cut the wound open, and used his fingers to pull out the needle. He once again applied some of the potion to the wound right after, and it stopped bleeding right after the fluid was absorbed.Angele\u2019s hand was drenched with his own blood as he grasped the needle he had just pulled out.\u2018Zero, can you identify its components?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Analyzing\u2026 Material is unknown. It\u2019s hard and highly conductive. No information on it can be found in the database,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018I should\u2019ve searched his body\u2026 but I had to play safe,\u2019 Angele thought as he shook his head in disappointment.Angele rested for a while. He took some meat jerky and dried veggies out of the bag and ate them with the water he had. He also fed the horses with the horse beans. He didn\u2019t wish to tarry for too long, so he left after feeding the horses.For centuries, the Ramsoda College and the Northland Alliance had been mortal enemies, but no one remembered the cause for their enmity. The Northland Alliance started the war, yet Angele still had no grasp of the whole picture. He never even figured out why Manas betrayed the school. The man Angele had killed started casting a spell after realizing Angele was a wizard apprentice from Ramsoda College. He didn\u2019t even hesitate.\u2018It\u2019s sad how I\u2019m not allowed to look at classified information in the library as a wizard apprentice,\u2019 Angele thought.Angele knew there were 5 different stages and 3 different ranks for wizard apprentices, but he wasn\u2019t sure how wizards were ranked. He knew that any wizard was much stronger than a wizard apprentice. He had already seen wizards battle but didn\u2019t know the strength hierarchy.The wizard apprentices\u2019 stage was determined by the abilities they have while the ranks determine the strength and power of a wizard apprentice.Rank 1 wizard apprentices belonged to the weakest, merely having a higher mentality and better spell resistance than normal people. Knight-level warriors might even be stronger than them.Rank 2 wizard apprentices were much stronger than rank 1s. They had energy particles inside their bodies, which could help in strengthening themselves. They had also learned basic spells and could easily contend against top knights.Rank 3 wizard apprentices were the best wizard apprentices. They knew about 5 spells and were capable of using energy particles in blocking incoming spells or physical attacks. Rank 3 wizard apprentices were also capable of improving spell incantations, making them faster to cast. Wizard apprentices rated as rank 3 vastly outstrip others\u2019 strength as they only required seconds of time to slay their opponents with various spells. If they knew physical skills, they could use buff spells and make themselves invincible during battles.The man Angele met used improved incantation. When Angele heard him chant, Angele drew his sword right away. Angele was already a top-level knight before becoming a wizard apprentice, so he was still a bit faster than his opponent. If he had hesitated, giving the man time to use more spells, he would be dead within seconds.Every wizard apprentice had their own combination spells. There were a countless number of spells in the world; the Ramsoda College had at least a hundred. Strong spells were usually very difficult to learn, so wizard apprentices would instead combine basic spells to make their combination attack stronger. Wizard organizations were also creating new spells, so it was nearly impossible for a person to recognize every spell.Angele thought for a while before stopping again. He set up a tent by the tree quickly and covered it with the linen clothes that wrapped the bags. He had gotten all of these from Ansett\u2019s family, yet he didn\u2019t expect to use them so soon.He put more leaves on the branches above to block the rain and he tied the horses to the trunk under the tree. Angele took the bags off the horses and put them inside the gray tent. The downpour of rain was becoming heavier and heavier.Angele sat inside the tent with his legs crossed while peeking outside through the small window. The wind was blowing across the tree, causing the branches to shake. No one else was around. It was dark, cold, and silent.Angele suddenly thought of his father. He knew the baron was already out for a mission on the Anser Plain before he embarked on the ship. Angele never heard anything from him after. He started thinking about everyone he knew as it was getting darker and darker outside.He wondered what made Manas decide to betray the school, and also thought of Ansett, who returned to her family after he left the school.\u2018Master Liliana, Yuri, Nancy\u2026\u2019 Angele didn\u2019t know why, but he kept thinking about everyone he knew. He didn\u2019t know what lied ahead of him and when he would be able to settle. For the first time, Angele felt loneliness and isolation spreading deep in his heart.\u2018Damn rain\u2026\u2019 he thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: Encounter (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele finally stopped thinking after a while, then he rubbed his temples and closed his eyes. The raindrops kept hitting the tent such that he could only barely hear the horses neighing. It was dark inside the tent. Angele calmed down and started to meditate. He was breathing rhythmically.\u2018Warning! Warning!\u2019 Zero suddenly reported. Angele was alerted when he felt his own wound itching.\u2018Infection?\u2019 Angele opened his eyes and looked at the wound.He saw that there were still leftover fluids of the potion on it. The wound wasn\u2019t bleeding, but the area around the wound looked dark red.\u2018How should I deal with it?\u2019 Angele asked calmly.\u2018Analyzing\u2026\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Required materials: Golden Flower, 15 grams. Single-eyed Deer\u2019s eyes, 180 grams. The Bighead Fish, 520 grams\u2026\u2019 Zero kept listing the necessary ingredients of the medicine that could stop the infection, but Angele looked disappointed.\u2018Where can I find all those random things in a forest?\u2019 Angele checked his wound again and saw some tiny stones growing rapidly around the wound. They were about the size of sesames; some were white and some were black. The infection was getting worse every second.The tiny stones almost covered the wound. It looked quite grotesquely disgusting that Angele didn\u2019t even want to stare at it.\u2018I need to do something.\u2019 Angele bit his lips and started to pack up. He needed to get all those materials quickly. He had no idea what would happen if the infection wasn\u2019t cured.***********************************Five days later.It was noon.Two robust horses were slowly advancing between the trees along a path. Angele, who was still in his tight hunting suit, was lying on the back of the first horse, but he was in low spirits. It was the fifth day since he had been inflicted with an infected wound. His face was pale and he was exhausted to the point of barely having any strength to control his horse.\u201cAt least I found something to slow down the infection, but I still need a cure,\u201d he murmured. Angele had covered the wound with a handful of a black substance, preventing the tiny stones to spread outside the covered area.Angele got off the horse after a while and decided to take a rest. He led the horses to a tree, then sat on the grass as he grabbed some food and started eating.\u2018How strong those bacteria are\u2026 They\u2019re much stronger than the ones on Earth, at least,\u2019 Angele thought as he drank some water from his canteen. He started to miss the world that had all the antibiotics people needed.\u201cI think I already crossed the border, so I should be in the Ramsoda Empire now. The map no longer has details of it; I can\u2019t rely on it anymore. I really want to know when I\u2019ll reach the closest town,\u201d Angele muttered. He stared ahead, but he could only see the sea of trees and the road between them.Angele turned his head and saw a twisted path through the gaps in the bushes, yet he couldn\u2019t see the end of it.The trees suddenly veiled itself within the mist, and at the same time, Angele\u2019s vision became fuzzy.***********************************Noises of hooves stomping on the ground echoed within the forest as two white large carriages appeared from the thick fog. Each carriage had two white horses in front. On one of the two carriages, there was a middle-aged coachman who was at his mid-forties. He was a pudgy man who wore a gray hat on his head. The man was holding the reins, skillfully showing his control on the carriage.The two carriages were painted in white, but some painted parts were peeling which revealed the dark-red wood.\u201cFather, how long until we reach Lennon City?\u201d a girl from the leading carriage asked. Her voice seemed to belong to a young girl.\u201cTen more days, maybe? We\u2019re half-way there, why do you ask?\u201d a man answered.\u201cTen more days?! Really\u2026\u201d The girl sounded disappointed.\u201cYea. Our territory is far from Lennon City. There\u2019s nothing we can do about it,\u201d the man said.\u201cBut we can\u2026\u201d The girl was trying to say something, but she was interrupted by the coachman.\u201cMilord, I can see a young man lying on the ground. I think he\u2019s dying,\u201d the coachman yelled.\u201cA young man? Where?\u201d the man asked, opening the window to take a look. The man inside the carriage wore a white noble suit. He looked kind and respectable.\u201cRight there,\u201d the coachman said as he pointed to the left. The man turned his gaze at the direction the coachman was pointing at and saw a young man lying on the ground beside two black horses.\u201cWhat happened? Mark?\u201d a lady asked.\u201cWe saw a young man lying on the ground. He looked unwell,\u201d the man named Mark answered.\u201cA young man? Let me see!\u201d the girl yelled.\u201cIs he from our territory? I haven\u2019t seen people from other countries in a while,\u201d she continued.\u201cStop! Let\u2019s go and help him!\u201d the girl kept yelling. The two carriages slowed down. A sinewy man in black plate armor got off the second carriage and walked toward the first carriage. He helped the girl get off the carriage. The girl was wearing a white one piece and had a pretty-looking face.\u201cDunleavy, can you go with me?\u201d The girl\u2019s skin was white and her blonde hair looked silky smooth, as though she was someone who came from a fairy tale.\u201cSure,\u201d the man named Dunleavy replied. With a seemingly heavy beard, he began walking toward the unconscious young man while holding the left hand of the girl.\u201cDunleavy, stay alert,\u201d the nobleman said. He helped the beautiful noble lady to get off the carriage.\u201cNo worries, my lord.\u201d Dunleavy nodded.They walked toward the young man with quick steps. As they arrived near to him, Dunleavy lowered his body to check on the young man and saw the wound on the young man\u2019s waist; it had a black color and produced an awful stench.\u201cHe has an infected injury,\u201d Dunleavy said in a grave tone.\u201cIs he alright?\u201d the blonde girl curiously asked after she jogged toward Dunleavy. Her appearance was akin to a princess\u2019s.\u201cI thought people scream after getting hurt. Why isn\u2019t he screaming?\u201d the girl said as she tried pushing the unconscious young man.\u201cHis wound is infected. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s conscious. His breathing is weak, and he\u2019s dying,\u201d Dunleavy smiled before explaining.\u201cHe\u2019s dying?\u201d With a nervous face, the girl asked.\u201cYes,\u201d Dunleavy replied.\u201cWe need to help him! We\u2019re close to Lennon City, anyway,\u201d the girl said.\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t\u2026 Ask your father,\u201d Dunleavy said. The nobleman was already slowly heading in their direction with his wife.\u201cWe\u2019ve no idea who this man is. If he\u2019s a spy, we\u2019ll be in trouble,\u201d the man said with a soft-spoken voice.\u201cAlso, he\u2019s injured. Whoever injured him is probably still looking for him. If we help him, we\u2019ll become the targets instead,\u201d he continued.\u201cBut Father\u2026\u201d The girl tried to say something.\u201cNo means no!\u201d the man said.\u201cGet back inside the carriage, Avril!\u201d He was nearly yelling.\u201cBut Father, what if he\u2019s a prince of another country? If we save him, he will\u2026 he will\u2026\u201d the girl replied.\u201cYou told me a lot of stories like that! That\u2019s how princes meet their lovers!\u201d she yelled.\u201cWell\u2026 stories aren\u2019t real.\u201d The man looked speechless.\u201cAvril, listen to your father, get back inside the carriage. We need to hurry.\u201d The lady stepped forward to intervene.\u201cNo!\u201d Avril refused to move.\u201cI can guarantee you that this young man isn\u2019t a prince. Let\u2019s go,\u201d the nobleman said.\u201cIf you don\u2019t help him, I\u2019ll stay here forever!\u201d the girl yelled as she stared at the other three.Ten minutes later\u2026There were two black horses following the white carriages in the back.\u201cWhere am I\u2026?\u201d Angele opened his eyes slowly and looked around. He was inside a carriage, and two swordsmen in black plate armor suits were sitting right beside him. Avril was sitting beside one of the swordsmen, looking at Angele curiously.\u201cWe saw you unconscious near a bush, so I saved you,\u201d Avril said, her face showing a \u2018thank me already\u2019 expression.\u201cReally? Thank you,\u201d Angele said after he smiled. In actuality, he was conscious the whole time and could still see and hear things clearly. However, he was too weak to do anything. He wanted to continue traveling, but he caught a fever so he decided to lie down for a while. Angele wanted to move after he woke up, but his fever became worse and his wound began aching. He knew that two carriages were coming and even heard everything those people said, yet he really couldn\u2019t stand up nor could he move his lips at that time.Angele was uncertain about what caused the fever. It could be the infection, but it could also be the weather. Although he had the chip, Angele needed to search for the medicine by himself. He was lucky that someone stopped to help him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Encounter (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele had been lying down in a relatively busy route and seeing several other carriages passing by, yet no one had stopped to help him. He never expected people to stop and help a total stranger like him until Avril\u2019s group came. The girl reacted happily after seeing Angele wake up\u201cActually, other people had seen me lying there but none stopped for me. Only a lovely princess like you would help a stranger,\u201d Angele smiled as he said this. The girl looked pleased after hearing him say that.\u201cI only did what I thought I should do\u2026\u201d With a blushing face, she spoke. Angele conversed with the young girl for a while. She was about 11 or 12 years old. While chatting with Angele, she noticed that he was still too weak.\u201cYou\u2019re hurt and your wound is infected. Also, your fever isn\u2019t gone yet, you better get some rest. We can talk later,\u201d Avril kindly said, and then she asked the two swordsmen to leave the carriage. She wanted to make sure Angele could rest well.The carriage fell silent after Avril closed the door. Angele lied down on the bed with a very tired face.\u2018Check my situation,\u201d Angele inhaled once, and he asked.\u2018You\u2019re infected with unknown bacteria. The infection is controlled by an effective drug. You caught an unknown flu and your body is weak. You need about 5 days and 14 hours to recover,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018When can I at least be able to move?\u2019 Angele asked something that was a significant issue to him. He needed to have the capability to react when threats approach. At this point, he was too weak to do anything. It was even more impossible for him to pick up any weapon. Angele felt so helpless because the infection and the fever made him weaker than a normal person.\u2018If you consume enough food and have enough rest, it will take 41 hours and 23 minutes,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018That\u2019s a long time\u2026\u2019 Angele sighed in disappointment.\u2018One hit from a rank 3 wizard apprentice and I nearly lost my life. I need to become stronger\u2026\u2019 Angele thought.****************************************************After Avril\u2019s carriages left.A young female deer slowly walked toward the place Angele had rested on and lowered its head to inhale Angele\u2019s scent. A white owl flew toward the deer and stood on a branch by the side. Its whole body was white, yet its eyes were deep and dark.\u201cWizard Renee, this is the end of the trail. The Tracking won\u2019t work anymore,\u201d the owl began talking with the voice of an old man. The deer walked around the place for a while before it raised its head to look at the owl.\u201cBased on the scent, he\u2019s a fleeing wizard apprentice of Ramsoda College. I think he was just lucky. Otherwise, there\u2019s no way he could kill Bahamut. If we can\u2019t track him anymore, there\u2019s nothing we can do. Bahamut\u2019s death won\u2019t affect anything, anyway,\u201d the deer began talking as well.\u201cWe need to stop focusing on matters that aren\u2019t important,\u201d the owl said.\u201cIt isn\u2019t the time to break the Treaty of Grimgar yet. Catherine and her crew already arrived at the destination. We mustn\u2019t let Ramsoda\u2019s main force live,\u201d it continued.\u201cWaki sent a message to us from Acrylic. It says Liliado is making a new Rift,\u201d the deer said.\u201cYea, we need to help the Northland Alliance to finish the job quickly. I think Liliado already noticed the situation. Santiago also sent some of their wizards here,\u201d the owl said.\u201cWe\u2019ll get the Shadow Pearl this time! No matter how many opponents we have!\u201d The deer\u2019s eyes gleamed.***********************The two moons quietly hung over the night sky. The clouds were slowly moving along the sky and there were several visible stars beside them. Angele was still lying on the bed, slowly eating his meat jerky while drinking some water.He could hear the crackling noise created by the campfire outside and could see the fire through the window. Angele smelled the fragrance of meat stew being cooked. His gaze fell onto the meat jerky in his hand, but he decided not to ask for food. The only one who treated him well in the group was Avril.Others were still against letting Angele stay with their group. They acted cold to him, and Angele knew the reason why as he overheard some of their gossips. If Avril hadn\u2019t insisted on using the expensive Anti-Infection Drug on him, he wouldn\u2019t have recovered quickly. He was supposed to be dropped off by the road after he woke up.Outside the carriage, a swordsman who had been sitting near the campfire suddenly stood up.\u201cHey, Gandhi, where are you going?\u201d a man asked.\u201cIt\u2019s almost my turn to patrol.\u201d Gandhi patted the long sword hanging by his waist and smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t go too far,\u201d Dunleavy said. He was sitting by the campfire and applying oil to his crossguard sword.Gandhi walked toward the back of the carriage while looking at the campfire and the carriages to make sure no one noticed him. He slowed down his footsteps and walked around before approaching the two strong, black horses. His face showed a jubilant reaction after seeing the horses carrying several pieces of luggage, thinking that there might be some valuable items inside.Gandhi checked the bags and saw a smaller but more delicate one. It was the bag that contained Angele\u2019s most important items. Inside the bag, there was the red pearl, Hemostasis Potions, the first Wizardry book he received, and the Black Lead Potion. At this point in time, the Black Lead Potion was most likely the most important item to him.Gandhi rubbed on the small bag laughing.\u201cFound it!\u201d he muttered in a low voice.*******************************Inside the first carriage.\u201cFather, I want to stroll around,\u201d Avril said. She was trying to tie a ponytail, so she was looking for the headband on the table.\u201cStay in the carriage. Don\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d the nobleman looked at her, and spoke with a silvery voice.\u201cI\u2019ll be back in 10 minutes.\u201d However, Avril didn\u2019t seem to care. As she found the black headband, she quickly tied her hair into a ponytail and jumped off the carriage.\u201cAvril\u2026\u201d the nobleman said as he looked at his wife. Their daughter was giving them headaches.Avril saw people gathering around the campfire talking, so she wanted to join the conversation. But suddenly, she stopped as she thought of Angele who was about 15 years old and was also saved by her not so long ago.\u201cHe isn\u2019t so handsome, but he looks smart,\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time leaving home. I feel like I\u2019m like the princesses in stories.\u201d She was in a good mood, so she began singing random songs. Avril turned and walked to the second carriage quickly. Suddenly, she saw someone sneaking around the two black horses, not knowing what the man was doing.\u201cGandhi?\u201d Avril recognized the man right away.\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d she yelled.Gandhi was scared witless after hearing someone called his name. He turned around and saw Avril walking toward him. His face became pale since he knew what would happen if the lord were to find out that he was stealing. Avril had realized what Gandhi was trying to do, so her expression turned cold.\u201cGandhi, do you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d she asked.\u201cI\u2019m just lollygagging.\u201d Gandhi tried his best to smile.\u201cWhatever. Why don\u2019t you stay close to the camp instead of wandering around?\u201d Avril smiled.\u201cI won\u2019t report you to my father if you leave now,\u201d she continued.\u201cThanks\u2026 I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Gandhi hadn\u2019t opened the bag yet. He smiled and left right away.Avril organized the bags on the horses and walked toward the second carriage.Angele knew Gandhi was trying to steal his items. He had heard everything, but he wasn\u2019t in the state to move. He needed to wait two days in order to secure his valuable possessions. It would\u2019ve been too late if Avril didn\u2019t stop Gandhi.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Avril opened the door and got into the carriage.\u201cPretty good actually, thanks to you.\u201d Angele liked the kind girl, so he wanted to thank her for everything she did for him.\u201cCan you tell me your full name?\u201d I am Angele, Angele Rio,\u201d Angele said.\u201cMy name is Avril Zolota Hasrim. What\u2019s your middle name?\u201d the girl asked curiously.\u201cWe don\u2019t have middle names. It\u2019s the tradition of my homeland.\u201d Angele said while shrugging his shoulder. That was one of the minor movements he could still do.\u201cI thought you were from Ramsoda?\u201d Avril asked.\u201cNo, I\u2019m from the other side of the sea. Where are you heading to?\u201d Angele smiled.\u201cLennon City, we need to bring my grandpa back to our territory. He\u2019s ill and it\u2019s getting worse,\u201d Avril answered with a sad expression, not hiding anything from him. They chatted for a while. Angele told her that he got lost and got injured by bandits. He said he was also heading to Lennon City and even told her interesting stories about his homeland. They enjoyed their chat.Avril wished to stay longer with Angele, but someone was calling her from outside the carriage, so she had to leave. Angele finally had the chance to meditate. It was imperative that he meditate every day and couldn\u2019t let others know what he was doing.The good thing was, he didn\u2019t have to be in a certain position to meditate. He could just do it while lying on the bed, sufficient for others to think he was merely resting. He wasn\u2019t sure what the locals thought about wizards, especially when he was from the Ramsoda College that was famous for Necromancy. For now, he decided not to tell anyone that he was a wizard apprentice since he still needed to recover from the injury.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Dragon Scale Flower (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeBy the end of the forest, there were two tall black bunkers sitting on both sides of the main road and endless black city walls were connected to them. A large wooden door was opened between the two bunkers, several guards in white leather suit patrolling around it. Some of them were questioning the coachmen on the carriages that were trying to enter the door. The guards\u2019 iron helmets looked like hats, most of them looked a bit chubby, and they all had the goatee on their chins. There were V-shaped red signs marked on their chest pieces, and none of them looked like experienced fighters.Two large carriages were waiting to enter the door while slowly moving forward. A cute blonde girl stuck her head out of the first carriage\u2019s window, looking around curiously. In the second carriage, Angele was peeking through the window with no expression on his face.He was recovering well after resting for several days. His attributes were climbing back to normal, and he felt much better. Angele could finally pick up weapons and he could finally protect himself. He was now in a much lighter mood, but he still needed some time until he could do whatever he wanted.Several swordsmen were following the carriages by the side and Dunleavy was one of them. The guards saw the noble insignia on the carriage, so they just let them through, not even checking with the coachman.The carriages entered the outer area of Lennon City without issues. Many paths laid between the trees. Angele could see pedestrians and other carriages on the road. They continued along and Angele began seeing houses and mansions.He saw a small river running down the roadside and a wooden waterwheel moving slowly on the other side. There were people carrying water buckets back to their houses and women washing clothes by the river. Several farmers were working hard on the cropland. It was noon and the sunlight was strong enough to make everything look golden.Angele sat on a chair and looked out the window, feeling pleased with the scenery.\u201cPeaceful, eh?\u201d Dunleavy asked, walking by the second carriage with his greatsword on his shoulder.\u201cYea, it\u2019s a different world for me.\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d he continued.\u201cLennon City is the safest city in the territory and Lord Melos is very kind. I\u2019ve always wanted to settle down here,\u201d Dunleavy said.Angele nodded his head and looked ahead. There were several kids playing with the water by the river, and he could hear them laughing.\u201cIt\u2019s a peaceful place. I think I\u2019ll just stay here.\u201d Angele smiled.\u201cReally?\u201d Dunleavy looked at him in confusion.\u201cWell, it\u2019s pretty hard to get a residential permit here,\u201d he said. Dunleavy wasn\u2019t sure if the young man impulsively decided just now.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It being hard doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s impossible, right?\u201d Angele shook his head before speaking. There were 20 provinces in the Ramsoda Empire. Angele thought Lennon City was great. This was the first city he visited in this country, and he liked it a lot so he decided right away. In this place, no one knew who he was, and it would take him only half a month to reach the harbor. Wizards would give their utmost not to hurt civilians, so they wouldn\u2019t fight in such a peaceful city.After Angele told Dunleavy of his plan, the latter caught up with the first carriage and told the owner. The carriages suddenly stopped and Avril\u2019s family quickly got off the carriage. Angele did the same.\u201cAngele, right?\u201d The nobleman smiled.\u201cYou decided to settle down here?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes. The environment here is great and I like it a lot,\u201d Angele bowed as he answered. They saved him, so he wanted to show them his gratefulness.\u201cI think you know how to protect yourself right? What\u2019s your actual plan?\u201d the nobleman asked.\u201cYes, I can protect myself. I was just traveling around and I was attacked by the bandits on the way. It\u2019s my first time in Lennon City, but I think it\u2019s a great place for me to settle down for now,\u201d Angele replied.\u201cSince you have made your decision, I think you wouldn\u2019t mind dropping you off here,\u201d the man nodded before he said.\u201cThank you for saving me. If there\u2019s anything I can\u2026\u201d Angele planning on returning the favor, but the man didn\u2019t let him finish speaking.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. We don\u2019t want anything from you,\u201d he said before returning to their own carriage. Avril followed him from behind with a disappointed face.\u201cThank you! For everything you did for me.\u201d Angele bowed again. He knew that if it wasn\u2019t Avril, the nobleman wouldn\u2019t stop and help him. He really wanted to do something for them, but it seemed like they didn\u2019t care. Angele waited by the side and shook his head. The guards brought him his black horses, and Angele held the reins in his hand.He understood why the nobleman wanted to stay away from him. He was a total stranger and the nobleman probably knew that he was lying about the bandits. The nobleman still didn\u2019t want to become the target of whoever was tracking Angele down. Avril had a disappointed look on her face. Angele guessed that she had tried convincing her parents to let Angele stay with them but she failed.The nobleman helped Angele, but he didn\u2019t want anything in return because he didn\u2019t care. He thought the less relationship he had with Angele, the safer his family would be. Angele watched the carriages leaving, only stopping after another team of merchants walked pass him.He had prepared some valuable items that he was going to give to Avril, but they left so quickly that he didn\u2019t get the chance to give it. Angele stood on the grass by the side. He heard horses neighing, wheels rolling, and people chatting. He felt everything was so real. He took a breath once, inhaling the fresh air.There were several white flowers mixed in the grass and several insects moving around. Angele raised his head and looked ahead. The road seemed endless; there were many farmlands and ranches around. The wind was gentle, causing Angele to feel refreshed.\u2018Zero, check my body condition,\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Analyzing\u2026 Angele Rio: Strength 2.9. Agility 4.1. Stamina 3.9. Mentality 3.8. Mana 3. Status: Healthy,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Good, I recovered a lot\u2026\u2019 Angele thought smilingly.\u2018Great, my mentality also increased. Haven\u2019t checked it for a while.\u2019 He was satisfied with the result. Angele\u2019s mentality was 3.5 before, and it took him about ten days to increase it to 3.8. An average rank 2 wizard apprentice would need 20 days to achieve it. If Angele could continue to increase his mentality like this, he would reach rank 3 in a year. He could feel the change brought by increasing the mentality. He could sense things better than before.\u2018I need to find a place to live. Although wizard resources are hard to find, the chip can help me build a new database. I can make some basic medicines to make a living here. Also, I can try to look for new materials as substitutes so that I can reach rank 3 much faster.\u2019 Angele planned as he kept moving forward on the road.More and more houses appeared by the roadside as Angele advanced further into the city. There were also more pedestrians and the road was much better than the outer areas of the city which was pretty much just mud. Angele entered the downtown area with his horses.The street was busy and most of the people around were wearing gray-white clothes. Some women were checking around the vendors with large buckets hanging on their arms. Every building was medieval-style, either having white or gray color.Two drunk men were drinking by the entrance of a pub Angele passed by, barely could understand what they were saying. Angele walked down the street slowly fully geared. The people around him tried to stay away from him after seeing what he was carrying.The street was wide and Angele kept checking around different stores. He saw bakeries, pubs, cloth shops, spice shops, drug stores, grocery stores, and crepe stands. It was the most advanced city Angele had ever been to. It was better than Marua Harbor because everything was well-organized here. The place was busy but people were following the rules.Angele found what he was looking for quickly as he entered an alley. It was dark and quiet, but the air here smelled sour. Angele saw a middle-aged woman asking two young men to carry wooden barrels out of her shop. There was a paper pinned on the board of the store that read \u2018Shop for Sale\u2019.\u201cExcuse me, are you the owner? Is the shop for sale?\u201d Angele asked. The woman heard Angele asking and walked toward him.\u201cI am. Are you interested?\u201d she smiled as she asked.\u201cI almost cleaned it up. You just need to pay me the money, show me your identity card, and sign the contract. After signing the contract, the shop will be all yours,\u201d she continued.\u201cIdentity card?\u201d Angele scrunched his eyebrows.\u201cI just got here, where can I get it?\u201d Angele asked. He had enough money; he learned that the magic stone was actually a commodity that could be used everywhere. He acquired this information on his way here. Initially, he had thought that he wouldn\u2019t be able to use the magic stones after he left the school. Angele also learned that one magic stone could be exchanged for a lot of money. Avril told him about the exchange rate and what a magic stone could get him. Its value was very high.\u201cThat could be an issue\u2026\u201d the owner said. She suddenly saw the black magic stone in Angele\u2019s hand and stopped for a second.\u201cBut for a rich guy like you, it would not be a lot of trouble,\u201d she continued.\u201cGood.\u201d Angele smiled. It seemed that his plan would work.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: Dragon Scale Flower (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe owner only wanted a fragment of a regular magic stone. However, Angele didn\u2019t know that magic stones could be broken into pieces. She then asked for Angele\u2019s information and quickly ran out of the shop. Half an hour later, the owner returned with an identity card and a commercial lease agreement in her hands.She handed the card over to Angele and asked him to sign the contract. The owner left with her crew after everything was done as though she didn\u2019t want to stay here any longer. Angele wasn\u2019t sure if he was ripped off, but he was surprised that he could get the identity card so easily.Dunleavy told him that a residential permit was hard to get and the identity card that would grant him the right to be a resident here according to the shop owner. Angele knew the magic stone had a high value, but he didn\u2019t expect to get the identity card and the shop with just one piece of the regular magic stone.Angele put the card and the contract into his bag, and he checked around the shop again. He decided to do some cleaning and he wanted to close the door. Suddenly, he heard people walking towards his shop.\u201cGet out,\u201d a man yelled. Angele raised his head and saw five strong men standing by the door. They had daggers or axes in their hands, and they were covered in sweat and awful smell.\u201cWho are you?\u201d Angele scrunched his eyebrows, and he asked.\u201cYou\u2019re the new owner?\u201d The man stepped forward before he asked. His skin was darker and there was a scar on his face. The guy looked tough especially when he kept swinging his axe with his hand.\u201cYea.\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cGood. Do you know the rules?\u201d the man asked.\u201cRules? What rules?\u201d Angele scrunched his eyebrows before asking.\u201cTwenty gold coins per month and the bad guys will leave your shop alone,\u201d the man stepped into the shop as he said.\u201cTwenty gold coins? Fine.\u201d Angele nodded. He was still a stranger to the place, so he wanted to stay out of trouble. He still needed time to adapt to the new environment.\u201cAlso, since you\u2019re new here, we need to charge you a little extra. It will be a one-time fee. 2000 gold coins.\u201d The man got greedier after seeing Angele agreeing to pay 20 gold coins each month without hesitation.\u201c2000?\u201d Angele asked with a disappointed face.\u201cYea. Why? You don\u2019t want to mess with us.\u201d The man raised his axe and waved it in the air. The other men started to laugh, staring at Angele in mockery.\u201cYoung man, pay the money and we\u2019ll protect you from any trouble, but if you don't\u2026\u201d\u201cHeh, hurry up!\u201d\u201cI saw your sword, but you don\u2019t look like a swordsman at all,\u201d they started to yell. 20 gold coins was fine, but 2000 gold coins would be a huge amount to anyone. Those thugs wanted to blackmail him. Angele looked outside through the showcase, unable to see anyone walking by.\u201cI suggest you guys leave right now and I will forget what happened.\u201d Angele stared at them and said with a deep voice.The leader hadn\u2019t expected Angele to threaten them. He looked at the sword that was hanging by Angele\u2019s waist carefully and realized the young man probably knew how to fight. The leader saw Angele\u2019s sheath that had some blood stain on it, which made his expression change.\u201cYou little punk! How dare you try to threaten us! Do you know we\u2019re with Roddie\u2019s Sword?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s f*ck him up!\u201d\u201cWe need to let him know who the real boss is!\u201d The other thugs didn\u2019t see their leader\u2019s expression, only continuously yelling.Angele suddenly stepped forward and grabbed someone\u2019s neck. He then threw him toward the wall, which made the man faint right after hitting the wall. The other thugs were still wondering what just happened. One of their members was taken out within a second and the only thing they saw was Angele putting his hand around the fainted man\u2019s neck.Angele had the speed of a knight, so these thugs stood no chance against him. He wasted no time and put down the other four men left. They rolled around grimacing in pain.\u201cGive me all your money,\u201d Angele talked to the leader. Angele was trying to stay out of trouble, but since he already beat them up, he decided to collect some pocket money.\u201cHow dare you! You know we\u2019re with Roddie\u2019s Sword, right?\u201d the leader said as he glared at Angele.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t care. You know you won\u2019t win a fight against me.\u201d Angele said with a mocking tone as he kicked the leader\u2019s waist.The leader winced in pain as he rolled around. Angele grabbed the black leather pouch that the leader dropped on the ground. There were about 40 gold coins, some silver coins, and some random items inside it. There were also two egg-sized yellow balls which looked strange.Angele thought they were made from mud and also noticed that the weight of the gold coins here was lower than where he came from. He grabbed one of the yellow balls and squeezed it with his fingers.\u2018Umm?\u2019 Angele found something strange about it. The ball had a smooth surface and he could smell the fragrance of herbs from it. It was surprisingly tough, but he got more surprised after figuring out what it was made from.\u2018It can\u2019t be\u2026\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Zero, compare the fragrance to the one in the database,\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Comparing,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Comparing results: Rubra 94%. Viper Skin Grass 79%. Dragon Scale Flower 71%. Lizard Flower 13%.\u2019 It took Zero several minutes to search the database.\u2018I knew it\u2026 If it really contains Dragon Scale Flower, it must be the real Rubra. Those balls are Rubra, and I can use them to increase my Mentality. Also, if there were Dragon Scale Flowers growing around the city, I will be able to make them by myself,\u2019 Angele smiled after thinking of this.The leader was lying on the ground, glaring at Angele with hatred, but Angele found him likable after finding the information he needed from the pouch.\u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d Angele asked as he hid his excitement in his mind.\u201cIf you touch my boss again, I will\u2026\u201d a thug lying beside his leader yelled. Angele didn\u2019t want to waste any time, so he kicked the thug in the head. The thug flew out of the door and stopped moving after hitting the ground. Blood was coming out of his head. No one knew if he was dead or alive.The others were silent after seeing what Angele just did, while the leader looked scared.\u201cOne of my men stole a bag of goods and this was one of the items I found inside the bag.\u201d The leader looked at the Rubra as he said.\u201cDid you see a flower that has white petals and black pistils?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cYes! I did!\u201d The leader nodded his head rapidly.\u201cGive it to me.\u201d Angele was really excited, but he tried not to show what he was feeling on his face.\u201cI don\u2019t have it with me\u2026 I left it at home,\u201d the leader said.\u201cGet up everyone. Take me to your home.\u201d Angele looked around. He wanted to make sure no one escaped. Angele wasn\u2019t sure what exactly Roddie\u2019s Sword was, but if one of them called for reinforcements, he could be in trouble.If he could find the Dragon Scale Flowers, he would be able to craft the Rubra. The Dragon Scale Flowers were the rarest material, but the rest weren\u2019t hard to find. A good amount of Rubra could help reduce the time he needed to reach rank 3 by half and the Rubra would still be helpful even after reaching rank 3.Angele saw the Dragon Scale Flower once when he was still in the school because one of the masters showed it to them in a class. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have it in the database. Zero recorded the Flower\u2019s properties when Angele saw it in class.The thugs got up from the ground and one of them grabbed the unconscious on the ground. Angele took his most important bag with him and followed the leader into the deeper alley.They spent about half an hour in the alley and finally arrived at the leader\u2019s home.\u201cWe are here,\u201d the leader said in a light tone. There were barely any people around, but Angele could see prostitutes with heavy make-ups walking around and he also heard drunken people singing random songs. The ground here was covered with dirt and it was very sticky. The place really stank.\u201cMove, everyone.\u201d Angele stared at the leader and the other thugs followed them into a small building. The leader grabbed a small bag from his disorganized bedroom and took out a flower that had white petals and black pistils.\u201cThat\u2019s the one!\u201d Angele yelled.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 what you want?\u201d The leader started at Angele.\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Angele said.The leader suddenly looked behind Angele. His eyes were wide open and had a horrified expression on the face. Angele was so excited that he forgot Zero to report if anyone appeared behind him, so he just turned back to check. It was too late when he realized what the leader was trying to do.The man threw the flower into his mouth and swallowed the whole thing. He had a smile on his face as though he was proud of what he just did.\u201cF*ck you!\u201d the leader swore and stepped back.\u201cKandra, kill him!\u201d he yelled.A man jumped into the bedroom from the window, trying to attack Angele. Angele saw the flower was gone. He felt the blood rushing into his head, turning his excitement into pure rage.\u201cNo! My flower! You will pay for this! You filthy insect!\u201d Angele felt his temples boiling from the blood.\u201cHow dare you!\u201d he yelled.Angele had never been so enraged. Even the wizards thought the flower was rare as one Dragon Scale Follow could be made into a great amount of Rubra. It would cost Angele more than a thousand regular magic stones to get it, yet the thug merely ate it in front of him.Anger boiled deep in Angele, not expecting a thug to have the guts to do something like this. Also, Zero didn\u2019t detect the guy who just jumped into the bedroom. He must\u2019ve hidden extremely well.\u201cYou are going to die!\u201d Angele screamed, and his voice echoed.\u2018Elimination plan initiated. Sensory integration enhanced. Targets locked,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele\u2019s eyes started to shine, and the blue flashes produced lit up the whole room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Settling Down (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele\u2019s blood was boiling; he drew the sword and slashed forward with great force.*DANG*The man\u2019s dagger blocked Angele\u2019s attack. The noises created by the clashing of weapons echoed in the room.Angele yelled and applied more force to his sword; the dagger was pushed back to the man\u2019s face. Suddenly, a stream of blood appeared in the air and the man\u2019s head was cut open. The man dropped his dagger and Angele slashed down with his sword. He could feel the sensation of cutting the man\u2019s body open, and the noise sounded a bit horrifying.The leader thought his plan worked, only standing there and laughing, but after seeing what Angele just did, his expression changed and he decided to run. However, he suddenly lost his balance when he turned back. His legs were aching.\u201cAh! My legs!\u201d the leader screamed in pain and he fell to the ground. There were lines of blood coming out of his ankles slowly. Angele kicked him in the waist again.The man with a dagger dropped to the ground and the stench of blood permeated all over the room. The man didn\u2019t suffer for too long, dying after several seconds.\u201cEven Kandlean can\u2019t fight him\u2026\u201d one thug said with a shaky voice. Angele didn\u2019t say anything, only turning around and stepping forward. He cut the two thugs\u2019 necks open before they could escape, causing them to just fall to the ground and die.\u201cYou don\u2019t run after destroying my Dragon Scale Flower!\u201d Angele\u2019s eyes were still shining and his blood vessels were visible around his temples. The blue light coming out of his eyes made him look horrifying. Two thugs outside the door knew that things went wrong, quickly putting down the injured thug and deciding to run. Angele grabbed the daggers the dead thugs dropped to the ground right away.\u2018Target locked. Adjusting force. Adjusting parabola,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele could see two blue points marked on the escaping thugs with in front of him.\u2018Done,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele threw the two daggers toward the thugs.The daggers flew through the air and pierced the two thugs\u2019 back. They screamed as they fell to the ground. Their bodies were twitching after Angele had aimed for their vertebras. Even if they survived, they would be paralyzed for the rest of their lives.Angele turned back and finished the unconscious thug off with his sword. Angele then glared at the leader that was lying on the ground and pointed at his neck with his sword. The blood on Angele\u2019s sword kept dripping onto the leader\u2019s neck.\u201cNo! No! No! You need me! Don\u2019t!\u201d the leaders yelled. His tears mixed with the snot were running down his face.\u201cYou want the Dragon Scale Flower, right? The one I ate was fake! It was a fake!\u201d he kept yelling.\u201cWhat?\u201d Angele was still pointing his sword at the leader.\u201cIt\u2019s fake?\u201d He grabbed the leader\u2019s neck before he asked.\u201cSay that again?\u201d Angele glared at him.\u201cI\u2019m a member of the Snake of the Sand Forest, so you\u2026 you should let me live!\u201d the leader stuttered. He could see the blue light coming out of Angele\u2019s eyes, causing him to nearly piss his pants. Angele leaned toward the leader and he didn\u2019t smell the fragrance of the Dragon Scale Flower. The flower the man ate was probably something else as he probably just tried to lure Angele into an ambush.Angele calmed down a bit and pulled the leader up.\u201cWhere\u2019s the real Dragon Scale Flower?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cAnd what\u2019s the Snake of the Sand Forest?\u201d He added.\u201cMaster Wizard, we\u2019re just low-ranked members of the organization. The flower I just ate isn\u2019t the real Dragon Scale Flower. It\u2019s something that we use to trick the buyers. We don\u2019t have any Dragon Scale Flowers at all. The Snake of the Sand Forest is the name of our organization. I know nothing else\u2026\u201d the leader explained quickly. He was still staring fearfully at Angele\u2019s sword. There was still something suspicious, but Angele knew most of his words were true.The Dragon Scale Flower was a well-known treasure and most nobles knew about it. Angele knew he wouldn\u2019t be so lucky, but he wondered why he got so angry after seeing the man eating the flower. He felt that he was too greedy, so he decided to be more careful next time.\u201cDo you know where I can find the real Dragon Scale Flower?\u201d Angele asked in a low voice.\u201cI\u2019m just collecting the protection racket and I really know nothing about it\u2026\u201d The man was sweating that Angele could see beads of sweat running down his face. The man knew that if he couldn\u2019t make Angele satisfied, he would become a dead body just like the others. He decided to at least give something else to Angele.\u201cAlso, Master Wizard, I still have the fake flower I ate. Would you like some of that?\u201d the leader asked.\u201cYou still have those?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cIt\u2019s right here, in the storage chest.\u201d The leader was not lying.Angele looked around. There was a broken wooden bed in the room; the floor was dark and wet with blood all over it. He could see spider webs in the corner and could smell the horrid stench. Angele found a gray iron chest filled with the fake Dragon Scale Flowers by the window. He grabbed one of the flowers; the flower was soft and it had a good fragrance. The pistil was black and the petals were white, but its shape was a bit different from the real Dragon Scale Flowers.The Dragon Scale Flowers had sharp edges on its petals, while this one had round petals. If Angele didn\u2019t take a closer look, he wouldn\u2019t notice the difference.\u201cIt\u2019s fake\u2026\u201d Angele felt a bit disappointed. He couldn\u2019t imagine how much progress he could make if the chest was filled with real Dragon Scale Flowers.\u2018Searching the database\u2026 Similar match: Lizard Flower,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele put his hands into the chest and he confirmed that it only had Lizard Flowers in it. He looked disappointed.Angele stood up and left the bedroom. The leader was still lying on the ground and he looked scared. Angele walked toward the man that jumped into the room through the window. He finally knew what the man looked like.The man was wearing a black suit. His face was covered with a black facemask. He was bald and his skin had a weird skin tone. It was green mixed with gray, and the green parts looked like mold. Angele almost sliced his head off, and the man also received a deep wound on his chest.Angele scrunched his eyebrows and searched the body. He found a small leather pouch tied to the man\u2019s waist, seemingly full. Angele took it down and opened it. There were some gold coins and silver coins. Angele also found a piece of paper inside, and there were several words written in Anmag on it.\u201818th\u2026 Afternoon\u2026 Restfor\u2026 When the Hallows of the Sun disappear\u2026\u2019 Angele read the paper, finding out that it looked like some sort of plan. There was a red dagger mark below the words.\u201cIt looks like they\u2019re trying to kill someone else with this plan. The ambush is set for someone else, yet the leader had to use it on me. That\u2019s why they didn\u2019t say anything about the fake flower on the way,\u201d Angele said while reading the plan.\u2018The Lizard Flowers and the Dragon Scale Flowers looks very similar, but Lizard Flowers are just flowers, while the Dragon Scale Flowers were great materials for Wizards. The fragrance of the yellow balls is probably created by some spice master. I should have used the chip to scan the flower when I saw it.\u2019 Angele thought. He stood up with a disappointed look on his face.\u201cThis is just part of the plan, right?\u201d Angele turned back and asked the leader.\u201cYes\u2026 There were ten more ambushes set up in different areas of the city, and that\u2019s all I know. I didn\u2019t know you are a wizard.\u201d he said.\u201cSo you\u2019re just looking for people who are rich enough to buy the Dragon Scale Flowers and lure them to the ambush?\u201d Angele threw the paper on the floor, and he asked.\u201cYou\u2019re right. I thought you were just a rich traveler\u2026\u201d The leader regretted what he did.\u201cI don't really care about you. I just want to know where the real Dragon Scale Flower is, and why the man in black could stay undetected,\u201d Angele said with a cold smile on his face.Ten minutes later\u2026Angele walked out of the alley and he could see no one around. People probably ran away after hearing the commotion. Angele looked at the item in his hand in satisfaction. It was a small scroll that the leader had given to Angele before he died. It was the secret skill of the assassin\u2019s guild \u2018Snake of the Sand Forest\u2019, and this was the skill the man in black used, even Angele could not detect his presence.\u2018The plan was made by the Snake of the Sand Forest, and it has nothing to do with me. Though I didn\u2019t get the Dragon Scale Flower this time, I still obtained the secret skill,\u2019 Angele thought as he put the scroll back into his pouch carefully.\u2018Warning! A large group of people is approaching. Please stay alert. 150 meters\u2026148 meters\u2026145 meters\u2026\u2019 Zero warned. Angele looked around, walked into an alley and disappeared.Ten seconds later, a group of guards gathered around the building, and they were wearing white leather armor suits. Most of them were overweight, only moving slowly with the heavy armor suits. It seemed that only the two leading men in the team were capable of fighting.\u201cThat\u2019s the place,\u201d a man with a war hammer said with a light voice.\u201cBut someone already took care of the problem.\u201d He kicked one of the bodies on the ground hard, causing the blood to be spilled everywhere.\u201cLet\u2019s check the place,\u201d one of the leaders walked inside, and he said.\u201cFollow me!\u201d he yelled.Several minutes later, the two leaders stood around the body of the assassin. They had serious expressions on their faces.\u201cIt\u2019s a member of the Snake of Sand Forest. Furthermore, he\u2019s a Black-Mask Assassin. It looks like they messed with the wrong guy,\u201d one of the leaders said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I can also sense a mysterious power around here,\u201d the other man spoke in a low voice. He took off his helmet, showing a blue face. The man had fin-like ears, blue skin, and white pupils \u2014 clearly not a human being.\u201cYou Merfolk are so sensitive to mysterious powers. Since you mentioned it, the Snake of Sand Dust must be dealing with a\u2026\u201d The other man didn\u2019t finish his sentence, but his reaction was etched with fear.\u201cYou\u2019re right. The first time I encountered such mysterious power was around 13 years ago. I can still recall it.\u201d The merman nodded with a serious face.\u201cI suggest we leave this master alone\u2026\u201d he continued.\u201cI will report the situation to the Senior Officer,\u201d the other man said.\u201cIt\u2019s been so long since I last discovered this mysterious power,\u201d the merman stood up, and he said.\u201cLet\u2019s move. We still have work to do. Take several guards with you and report our findings to the senior officer,\u201d he said.*****************************Angele had been hiding in the shadows behind the building all along. After a few moments, he heard the guards leaving.\u201cMerfolk could be a problem\u2026\u201d Angele murmured as he scrunched his eyebrows.\u2018But they didn\u2019t seem to care about the guys I killed. What\u2019s more, it looks they fear the power of wizards,\u2019 Angele thought. He lowered his footsteps and walked out of the alley.He followed the way he came from, quickly reaching his newly-bought shop. No one else was around, but he could still see the leftover footprints of the thugs. Someone had stolen his horses. However, Angele took everything important before leaving, so he didn\u2019t care about it anymore.Angele walked into the shop, put down the bows and quivers, and his bag. Before leaving, he locked the door. Angele had taken a decent amount of coins from the thugs. His dried food rations were gone, so he had to buy something to eat.He found a pie store by the street, which had a sign outside that had \u2018Darling\u2019s Pie House\u2019 written on it. Angele carried his sword on his back as he walked into the store. The store had white counters, and there were about 7 to 8 tables arranged in a neat manner, showing a clean and well-organized store. Several workers were handing packed pies purchased by customers on the line.Angele could smell the delectable scent of a freshly baked meat pie, making him salivate from hunger. He inhaled once, relishing the smell before sitting at an empty table. Albeit busy, the place wasn\u2019t crowded; several waiters and waitresses were entertaining the customers.\u201cHello, what would you like to order?\u201d A waitress saw Angele sitting down, so she came over to take his order. She wiped her hands on her white apron.\u201cWhat do you have?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cOur signature dish is the Scallion Meat Pie. We also have the Sesame Sweet Bread, Deep Fried Doughs, and the Vegetable Pies,\u201d the waitress said, her voice crisp.\u201cCan I have a Scallion Meat pie, please? How much is that?\u201d Angele asked.\u201cTwo silver coins,\u201d the waitress replied. Angele took out two silver coins from his leather pouch and handed it to the waitress as payment. It took about 10 minutes for the dish to arrive. The meat pie had a golden crispy exterior; the minced meat and scallion were mixed up inside its filling. Angele sliced it into pieces and put some into his mouth with a fork. The texture was great, the pastry layer was crispy, and the fillings were savory: not greasy and not too salty. The wholesome and succulent taste instantly turned Angele into a fan of the meat pie.He ordered another portion after he finished eating it and even quickly finished the second serving. Angele stood up and walked toward the counter. Lunchtime had already passed, so there weren't that many customers at present.\u201cHow can I help you, Sir?\u201d a clerk asked.\"Do you deliver? Can I have meat pies delivered to me every day? I'll give you the time and location,\" Angele asked.\u201cSure, we can do that,\u201d the clerk replied.\u201cAlso, bring a glass of milk and some juice, too,\u201d Angele added.Twenty minutes later.Angele didn't need to worry about purchasing food every day after placing orders at the pie store. He returned to his newly-bought shop again, and then he decided to start meditating after closing the door. His shop was still empty, without any merchandise to sell. Angele didn't bother with it for now. He just sat on the floor with his legs crossed and began to meditate. Angele was a knight-level warrior, and as long as the environment wasn't too bad, he would be able to meditate.The infection which inflicted him along the way was most likely due to the black needle. Otherwise, he wouldn't be infected so easily. However, there was no data about the black needle found in the chip's database, so he had no way to test it. He needed several types of equipment for him to obtain data on the black needle, but he was out in the wild with no ways of having access to a full set of equipment.After about an hour of meditation, Angele stored the Stun Spell in the chip and decided to go shopping. He wanted to buy a bed, some basic furniture, and some daily supplies. Also, Angele wanted some new clothes and boots.It seemed he needed to be a noble at this place for him to purchase and wear colorful clothes. Angele could prove he was a noble, so this wasn't a problem to him.************************************In the next half-month, Angele lived in his shop, and the only thing he did besides sleeping and eating was meditating. The only times he'd go out was for shopping, which was merely for several instances. At present, Angele finally had the time to study the information stored on the chip. He had also tried to learn the secret skill of the Snake of Sand Forest. Angele thought it was worth it considering how it helped the assassin stay undetected within the radius of the chip.Angele already learned the basics of the Hand of Exhaustion, and he needed a huge amount of mentality for the chip to improve the spell. He had no way of increasing his mentality at this point, so he decided to take it slow.*Tap tap tap*Someone knocked on the door while Angele was training his sword skills. Only after wiping the sweat off his face did he open the door. A 10-year-old girl with a ponytail and was wearing a polka dot apron and a white headband was standing by the door with a black metal box in her hands.\"Mr. Angele, here's your pie,\" the girl politely said.\"You can leave it on the table.\" Angele turned back and walked to the backyard since he wanted to train in the basic sword skill set. The backyard had plenty of space for him to work around, and there was a well in the middle if he became thirsty.Angele held his crossguard sword, training his front slash, vertical slash, and horizontal slash. He kept training in these three basic slashes with a speed so fast there was barely any noise generated in the moving sword. It was as though a silver triangle's conception was made possible because of the sword moves.\"You're not leaving?\" Angele suddenly sheathed his sword, turned around and looked at the door. The girl was peeking through the gap with a face filled with interest in sword skills. The girl's face turned pale after noticing Angele's gaze.\"I am very sorry.\" She stepped forward and bowed to Angele.\u201cMr. Angele, I was just wondering what you were doing\u2026\u201d she said in a wobbly voice. Angele looked at the girl. Her height was average for her age, and she was a bit too thin as though she was malnourished. The girl was the one who had been delivering food for Angele every day. She was very polite, never late, and always showed respect to Angele. Angele liked her attitude \u2014 he thought people must be humble and hardworking in becoming successful in life.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I'm not mad. Do you like swords?\u201d He walked toward the girl slowly, and he asked in a manner that wouldn't scare her.\u201cYes, Sir. I am just\u2026 curious. Please forgive me for walking into your backyard without permission!\u201d The girl bowed again, apologizing nervously.\u201cYou are lucky, girl. I'm in a good mood today. What\u2019s your name?\u201d Angele asked. His understanding of the secret skill of the Snake of the Sand Forest was close to perfection, so he was currently feeling enraptured.\u201cTia. My name is Tia,\u201d the girl answered right away.\u201cNext time you deliver the food, you can stay here and watch me train.\u201d Angele knew Tia wasn't merely curious; she also had the desire to learn. Angele had seen her expression and realized that for a long time, she must've wanted to learn the sword. Angele didn't care if others were to attempt to copy his sword skill set as he wasn't a phony noble like others. Instead, he would love it if he could give others the chance to control their destinies. Tia looked extremely excited upon hearing Angele's words. She was so happy that she forgot to thank Angele. She merely stood there, not knowing what she should say.\u201cOkay, watch my movements carefully,\u201d Angele said. He walked back to the backyard and started to teach Tia the fundamentals. Angele had always thought that fundamental was important. Although fundamentals were easy to understand, mastering it was too difficult.For generations, humans had dedicated their whole lives just to improve the fundamentals. One had to master the basics first before one could learn anything else. If one didn't pay too much attention to the basics, one's bones could break, and one's joints would suffer, resulting in a lifetime impairment.This world was completely different to Earth. The weapons Angele saw were all far superior to Earth's counterparts. The swords, bows, and crossbows were too heavy, and their damage output was nearing the extremity. If he could wield a 50-pound sword in the same speed and agility as he could with a 20-pound sword, he would be far stronger. The only problem Angele had was that he needed to spend more time training.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: Invitation (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeHalf an hour passed.Angele showed Tia several different basic sword maneuvers and thought it was enough for the day. He returned the sword to its sheath carefully before he gazed at the sky. It was covered with billowing clouds as though a storm was coming.A chilling wind blew into the backyard, deprived of the sun's warmth, as darkness took over. The weather had been scorching hot in the past several days, yet now all the heat was gone. Angele walked toward the well, put down his sword, and wiped the sweat off his face with a black towel.\"Why are you still here? Go home and think about what you learned today,\" Angele turned back, and he said. Tia was still standing by the door filled with disbelief from Angele letting her stay. She nodded after she heard what Angele said, her face filled with happiness.\u201cYes, Master. Thank you very much! I'm leaving now!\u201d Tia said. As she turned to leave, her path was blocked by several strong men. Two men in plate armor suits pushed Tia away and stared at Angele.\u201cExcuse me. Are you Angele Rio?\u201d one of the men asked.\u201cWho let you in?\u201d Angele asked with a grim tone.\u201cI'm a noble, still, and you're on my private property. I didn't know the guards of Lennon City were this insolent,\u201d he continued.\"We're just doing our job. I don't think it's appropriate for you to accuse of us being rude!\" the other man replied with a deep voice.\u201cScum.\u201d Angele had a cold expression on his face.\u201cSay that again, and I'll make you pay for your arrogance!\u201d the first man yelled, his hands placed on the handle of his sword.\"Try me, scum.\" Angele grasped his crossguard sword, taunting the guard mockingly.\u201cCome on, Morph. We\u2019re still on a mission!\u201d One of the men stopped the guard named Morph as he calmed Morph down.\u201cWe apologize for trespassing in your backyard without permitted entry, it\u2019s our fault,\u201d the man turned around, and he said as he bowed slightly to Angele.\u201cWe are the City Guards. We\u2019re here to check your residential permit. We do this occasionally, so please be considerate. If you show us the permit, it would be nice,\u201d the man said.\u201cYea, that\u2019s the attitude I like. However, you still violated my privacy, causing my mood to worsen now, so I don\u2019t want to show you my permit. You may leave now,\u201d Angele calmed down a bit, and he said.\u201cYou!\u201d Morph glared at Angele in anger, intent on drawing his sword.\u201cMorph!\u201d The man stopped Morph again.\u201cCalm down! You'll be punished again if you keep acting like this!\u201d the man yelled.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I think you already did your job here,\u201d Angele said in a low voice as he looked at the two guards. Suddenly, they heard people in heavy armor marching into the backyard.\u201cGet out of my way, son.\u201d The two guards were pushed away by a huge swordsman.\u201cI\u2026!\u201d Morph got mad again, but the other guard pulled him back.\u201cThis is the place.\u201d A group of heavily armored swordsmen marched into the backyard. Their leader was a person that had a black feather on his helmet. He didn't seem to care about the guards he pushed aside just now.\u201cSorry, Master Angele. We saw the door already opened, and we could hear people arguing inside, so we entered to see if there was anything we can help you with.\u201d The leader bowed, his tone sounded like he respected Angele a lot.\u201cYou\u2019re too slow.\u201d Angele shook his head, put down the black towel, and walked toward the door with the crossguard sword in his hand.\u201cGet out of here. I need to change,\u201d Angele said.\u201cYou!\u201d Morph was still infuriated. He had just been pushed aside by the leader of this group of heavy armored swordsmen, but he knew that Angele and the swordsmen probably had a higher stature than the City Guards. The other guard knew that there was nothing they could do, and instead just tried his best to calm Morph down.These heavy armored swordsmen were the guards of the Lord Mayor of Lennon\u2019s mansion. The leader was named Gerac, a knight-level warrior. He guarded the city\u2019s entrance for five minutes alone during the War of Andrew. Thousands of enemies invaded the city, yet not even one of them was able to enter the city. Gerac killed countless enemies, and the slain corpses stockpiled until it nearly blocked the entrance.The citizens called Gerac 'The Tiger of Lennon', so the City Guards decided not to cross with Angele after witnessing Gerac showing respect to this noble who had just arrived in this city not too long ago.Gerac yelled; the guards quickly left the backyard one by one. Tia was the only one who remained in the place. Angele looked at the girl and saw her pale face. It seemed that she was scared witless by what just happened.\u201cWell, it looks like they misunderstood our relationship,\u201d Angele said. Tia looked at him in confusion, unable to make heads or tails of what Angele was saying.\u201cIt could be a good thing for you.\u201d Angele didn\u2019t explain, only walking into his room and closing the door.\u201cMaster Angele\u2026 He must be someone influential\u2026\u201d Tia stood in the backyard alone, not knowing what to do. She was just a girl who had a very frail body and an average-looking appearance. Tia didn\u2019t think Angele would become interested in her.Tia knew that Angele didn\u2019t want anything from her as he was merely teaching her basic sword moves. Because of that, she felt very grateful to him. Her father was a drunkard, while her mother disappeared during childhood. Tia had known that she needed to do everything by herself since she was very young, that no one would be there for her if anything were to happen to her. One day, when she was nine, her father left the house and never came back.She lost her home and lived on the streets for a while before she gained a job at the pie store. She only wanted food and shelter, so the owner never paid her actual money as her wage. Every day, she needed to work more than 12 hours, and if she ever made any mistakes, the owner would beat her up.Still, Tia endured every pain she suffered. During work time, she would listen to the customers\u2019 conversations as her hobby. She learned that people feared the ones who carried weapons and knew that people who could fight would at least be able to protect themselves.Tia dearly wished to become someone who could use weapons one day, so she tried training in the sword using tree branches whenever she had spare time. However, due to her lack of knowledge in wielding swords, her right hand got injured.Angele corrected her moves, thus preventing her from damaging her right arm's muscles. If she hadn't met Angele, it would lead to her right arm becoming completely disabled one day. She wanted to gain power, so she trained every day no matter how hard her situation was.Angele realized her right hand was in pain when he saw her the first time, but he never thought that the girl had been learning to use a sword without teaching her. He liked the girl's unyielding nature. After all, Tia wanted to become stronger, and she tried to reach her goal as if nothing could deter her. Angele thought that even if she couldn\u2019t become a knight, she would still become a great warrior.Angele wanted the guards to have misconceptions about his relationship with Tia because he knew it was better for her. No matter what Gerac thought of their relationship, it would make people treat her better. However, Angele didn\u2019t want anything in exchange; he merely wanted to do something for her.It wasn\u2019t a big deal to Angele, but what he had done would drastically change the girl\u2019s life.************************Half an hour later.Angele had his clothes changed and all the valuable items kept inside his pouch. He was wearing a white suit with his sword tied to his waist. Angele walked out of his room and saw Tia standing in the middle of the shop; it looked like she didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not leaving, you better practice what I just taught you. I\u2019ll be back by nighttime,\u201d Angele said.\u201cI will, Master Angele,\u201d Tia said as she bowed to Angele. His words uplifted her mood.Angele was planning on taking her in as a disciple. He discovered that she had the potential to become a knight upon analyzing her attributes with the chip. Though the chances were at a low point, she had better talent than Angele. Angele wanted to pass down his sword skills and archery, and he also needed some people to help him out while living in the city. He needed people he could trust and people who would obey his bidding. Angele could do everything by himself, but he wanted to spend more time studying and experimenting.Tia was still young, but she was already hardworking, and she had a great potential. Angele had some spare time to spend. It would be nice if the girl became a knight, but it was alright if she didn\u2019t. Angele planned on just doing whatever he wanted.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Angele walked toward Gerac, and he said after.\u201cThe Lord is awaiting you in his mansion,\u201d Gerac said politely. Angele knew the Lord was going to make a move after discovering the mysterious power Angele had. There was a black carriage waiting near the entrance of the store. It had a \u2018white bird and sunflower\u2019 insignia. The sunflower looked like jimsonweed, but it had a golden hue. Surrounded by the flowers was the white bird at flight.Angele was surprised that the Lord himself had invited him to the mansion. It looked like they paid much attention to the mysterious power they discovered. Angele rode on the carriage and closed the door. The carriage started to move forward at a slow pace, escorted by the heavy armored swordsmen beside the carriage.They left the alley right away. When Angele peeked outside the window, he saw the street bustling with activity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: Invitation (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter the peak hour, the street had gotten much quieter, proven by how there were merely several noble carriages traveling along the way. Angele began to hear thunder rumbling from the sky as the clouds became much thicker; the street became darker as shadows loomed over the surroundings. It was as if nighttime descended, yet it was still noon.The wind that had its temperature dropped screamed as it blew into Angele's carriage through the window. Angele slightly pulled up his collar to combat the chill; to no avail, however. It was because Angele was wearing a high neck collar luxury suit, which had silver flowers embroidered on the edge of the collar. If it wasn't for the night banquet he was going to attend, Angele wouldn't wear such impractical clothes.Angele's white, high-neck collar suit looked a bit like a commander's suit but with fewer decorations. This suit he was wearing was similarly one commonly used by swordsmen.The carriage kept advancing for another half an hour in peace only to be disturbed by a roaring sound. Angele heard this sound drawing near. He looked out through the window and found himself going uphill along a mountain path.Angele glanced around. At the opposite side, there were mountains, and as he looked down, he found a river leading to a large waterfall at its end. This waterfall was the source of the sound Angele heard earlier. Large pieces of wet stones shined below.The carriage he was on was advancing on the twisted hill road, which was beside the waterfall.\"We're almost there!\" Gerac yelled outside. The noise created by the waterfall had almost muffled his voice completely, so he had to increase the volume of his voice to let everyone hear what he said. Angele nodded, pulling down the curtain to keep his suit from getting wet. Angele now missed his gray robe allocated by the college. The robe had a spell enchant, which maintained a new look and cleanliness. Thus, he never needed to wash it. Ever since he arrived at Lennon City, he hadn't heard any news about the school's situation at all.\u201cI\u2019m already 16\u2026\u201d Angele closed his eyes and sighed. Many things had happened to him since he reincarnated into this world. He knew he needed to think twice before making decisions, but there were still some decisions he regretted. Angele inhaled the cold and humid air, making him feel refreshed. He stopped thinking about the past.The carriage quickly arrived at the hilltop. A large, gray castle sat atop the hill surrounded by tall, thick walls. There was a large gate upon the castle walls, which was the only entrance to the castle. The carriage and the escorts stopped when they reached the gate. Angele opened the door and got off the carriage.Angele hadn't had a haircut for a while, so his long hair flew about in the air as the wind blew. With him wearing a white suit that showed his robust body and his long hair, it gave off a wild yet gentle impression.\"I'll notify them of our arrival.\" Gerac bowed to Angele before walking into the gate. Angele waited outside along with the other guards.Angele looked around as he remained standing by the carriage. He could see another hill at the opposite side of the waterfall, and built atop it was a large, gray castle. It had a slightly smaller size compared to the one in front of him, and there were sentry towers built along the hill roads heavily guarding the castle.The scenery where the large waterfall lay in between the two castles looked magnificent.\"Great place,\" Angele praised.\"You think so too?\" Angele turned his sight to the gate when he heard a voice coming from it. His eyes fell onto a muscular old man wearing a large, white leather coat. He sat in a wheelchair with a pale face, but he seemed to be in good spirits.\"Welcome to Lennon City. I haven't seen such a person with mysterious powers for years. We wouldn't have known you arrived in the city if it weren't for our Merfolk friend who sensed your power,\" the old man smiled, and he said before asking the maid to push the wheelchair toward Angele.\"Nice to meet you, my name is Alford Reed, Lord of Lennon City,\" the old man said.\"I'm Angele, pleasant meeting you too.\" Angele placed his left hand on his chest and bowed in courtesy.\"The night banquet is about to start, please come and join us,\" Alford said.Angele nodded in response, and he followed the old man into the castle. Gerac and another white-armored swordsman walked alongside the Lord, while the rest of the guards followed them in the back. Angele had just entered the gate when he heard noises of arriving carriages coming from behind.\"Father! Why did you not tell me there would be a guest today?\" a young man said. Angele turned around and saw a blonde man walking toward him with a smiling face. The blonde man had a beautiful face and a soft and smooth skin. Angele thought it was a woman until the blonde man walked closer to him. There was a whole group of guards behind him.Before the carriage could stop, the young man jumped off it. Alford's facial expression became strange when he saw the young man, but it only lasted for a fleeting moment.\"My son, I didn't get the chance to tell you about Master Angele. I only saw the report today. I decided to invite him to my castle right after,\" Alford replied with a smile.\"You can call me Tinos, Tinos Reed. Welcome to Lennon City,\" the blonde man nodded as he said this to Angele. The latter caught the lord's strange expression. It looked like Alford feared his son.For some reason, Angele couldn't help but do a double-take upon glancing at Tinos. The young man had a feminine face, fair white skin, and a clean, short hair. He was wearing a tight black leather suit. When he smiled, his purple lips caught people's attention. Tinos was strangely beautiful. If Angele were to associate him with something, it would be a thorny purple rose coated with deadly poison.Angele glanced at the two guards behind Tinos. One of them was taller than the other. Both of them were wearing leather armor. The taller guard was similarly smiling. His white hair was left untied over his shoulders, and he was handsome. He was holding a black dagger.The shorter one was a lady who had her face covered with a black mask holding two small stones in her hands. Her eyes and hair color were black. Complemented with the leather suit she wore, her attractiveness reached another level. Ten more guards stood behind them, all of which were beauties or handsome men.\"Nice to meet you, Mr. Tinos,\" Angele said as he gently smiled.\"I left the castle right away after hearing Master Angele was in Lennon City. Sadly, my father arrived first,\" Tinos said. Angele found Tinos's smile charming, causing him to feel a slight jealousy over Tinos's appearance. Angele, who had an average-looking face, had never cared about his appearance before but standing beside Tinos made him feel uncomfortably inferior.\"It's going to rain, why don't we enter the castle first? I hear the Lord has already prepared a banquet,\" Tinos continued.\"Sure,\" Alford replied, and Tinos nodded in response. Alford led the way; Angele and Tinos followed him. Some guards were dismissed, leaving the remaining guards to escort them to the castle.Angele still wished to confirm his suspicions in regards to the strange feeling he had with Tinos. The young man didn't even have a beard, and his skin was smoother compared to other ladies. Angele could smell the woman-like fragrance coming from Tinos, causing him to have second thoughts. Angele kept convincing himself he was looking at a man.They walked for a while. Every time Angele moved closer to Tinos, he found out the latter trying to stay away from him. It was as though Tinos was doing his best to have minimal contact with Angele.\u2018Zero, check Tinos\u2019s body condition and identify his gender,\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Analyzing\u2026 Tinos Reed: Strength 2.0. Agility 2.7. Stamina 2.4. Mentality 1.2. Mana 0. Gene limit hasn\u2019t reached the peak. Status: Healthy. Gender: Male,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018So he\u2019s a man\u2026 and his attributes are on a knight-level,\u2019 Angele thought. Tinos\u2019s attributes were on a mid-level knight\u2019s, but Angele wasn\u2019t certain of Tinos being a knight-level warrior. The chip was capable of gaining intel on Tinos's attributes, but it couldn't gain intel on Tinos's battle experiences and unique physical skills.After Angele had become stronger, the results the chip showed had become more accurate. At present, he was 1 or 2 meters away from Tinos, and he decided to check everyone within a 5-meter radius. The two guards in black leather armor had knight-level attributes, and their Agility attribute was relatively high. The other guards had the same attributes as ordinary people's, and it was quite likely that they're worse than the city guards.Angele hadn't expected to see many knight-level warriors here. However, the most important personage in Lennon City was living here, so the security level of this place must be the highest in the city.\u2018Well, it\u2019s likely that Tinos just likes handsome men and beautiful women. Perhaps he even hates average-looking people,\u2019 Angele made his conjecture. Lord Alford had an extremely high Strength attribute of about 5.0, but his Agility attribute was merely 0.5 and also, his Stamina attribute was only about 1.0. It seemed that Alford could no longer walk as he had been sitting in his wheelchair the whole time. Angele assumed that Alford would have been at least a top-level knight before getting crippled into his current state.Angele also noticed that Gerac and the other white-armored guard kept looking at the guards behind Tinos. Instead, they kept a certain level of vigilance toward these guards. As Angele thought of this, he realized that there were still things he needed to figure out.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014ED Note(s): I apologize for the inactivity during these past few days.

    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74: Success (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAs they passed through the garden, Alford whispered something to the guard beside him.They weren't speaking in Anmag. It made Angele furrow his brows. Though he could hear what they were saying, he couldn't understand a single word.The guard nodded in response before separating with the group and walking toward the right side of the garden. The garden was huge, and only after walking for more than 10 minutes did they finally reach the exit.Angele finally saw the castle gate after walking past an ornamental pond. The gate was already open, and standing on both sides were maids and servants awaiting their arrival. It was still dark outside, but Angele could see the warm lights coming from inside the castle.\u201cFather, were you looking for me?\u201d someone asked from behind.\u201cMy son, you're finally here!\u201d Alford exclaimed. This time, he had a face filled with gentleness \u2014 unlike when he was dealing with Tinos.Outside the corner of Angele's eyes, he witnessed Tinos looking at his brother respectfully. After hearing his brother's voice, however, Tinos stopped looking at him nor showed any emotion on his face.A blonde young man appeared from the corner of the garden and walked straight toward Alford. Angele looked at the man, his countenance turning stern. He was smiling; he had blue eyes and a balanced body. The man was handsome, and he looked identical to Tinos but was different. Angele could notice his eyes filled with confidence.The young man's steps were heavy and steady. Angele felt like he was looking at a lion strolling in its territory. His expression turned more serious after that. Upon smelling a tinge of blood coming from the young man, Angele realized that this young man was a person who knew how to kill. The confidence radiating from his eyes indicated that he thought he's capable of anything. It was clear that the man's forged bloodlust wasn't a pretense. He must've had no small amounts of blood on his hands from his past experiences, which in turn numbed him toward violence.\u201cThis is my other son, Harland Reed.\u201d Alford introduced the man young to Angele.\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure, Mr. Harland.\u201d Angele smiled and nodded.Harland still held a garden shear in his hands. It seemed like he could care less about the presence of a man with mysterious power. He took pride in his power. Harland glanced at Angele for a second before nodding as a welcome gesture but spoke none of such greetings. However, after glancing at Angele, Harland did a double-take, and he became surprised.\u201cMy apologies. I never thought my father's guest was a strong warrior,\u201d Harland said these words slowly. For a while, he looked at Angele, his face becoming solemn after.\u201cHaha, you're flattering me...\u201d Angele replied, not understanding the underlying implication of Harland's words.Harland handed the garden shear over to a worker at the side and walked toward Angele. He intentionally looked at Angele's sword for a moment, causing Angele to think Harland already had the knowledge of him being a top-level knight.\u2018Zero, show me Harland\u2019s information,\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Analyzing\u2026 Harland Reed: Strength 8.2. Agility 6.1. Stamina 5.8. Genetic information: Unknown. Your possibility of surviving Harland\u2019s attack within a 50-meter range is 48.22%,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Holy\u2026\u2019 Angele was surprised. It meant Angele would lose to Harland even with the assistance from his spells. Also, his attributes were extremely high.\u2018A grand knight\u2026 That\u2019s why he looks so confident,\u2019 Angele thought. He knew there were many strong warriors here, but he didn\u2019t expect to meet a grand knight with such high attributes.Mid-level knights' attributes scaled between 2 to 3 in average, and top-level knights nearly had no contrast in attributes from mid-level knights. However, top-level knights had the burst potential that could increase their attributes dramatically. It was the reason why Angele became a top-level knight.However, the situation was different for a grand knight. All of them were talented, and it was possible for them to have extremely high attributes. When dealing with an average knight, a grand knight could easily dispatch them in a battle because they have greater strength and agility. Also, grand knights had high resistance against physical attacks and their power after enkindling their burst potential was immeasurable.One grand knight could fight against a whole army, and only archers and crossbow users would give them trouble. Average infantry stood no chance against one grand knight.Harland met Angele for the first time today, but he had already shown great intrigue in Angele. They converse about everything, and they had a lot of drinks to boot.Tinos and Alford didn't join in their conversation; the latter only sat there with a smile on his face. He was listening to the two talking about their experiences, but Tinos was disappointed. When Tinos tried to join in the conversation, Harland denied him.After the night banquet, Harland asked the coachman to drive Angele back using his private carriage. He tried to invite Angele to stay the night in the castle, but Angele only smiled and declined his invitation. Harland didn't seem to be bothered by it, only being mindful of Angele's decision.On his way back, Angele talked with the guards who were walking alongside the carriage. From their conversations, he learned a few things about Harland.Harland Reed was the only grand knight in Lennon City, and the citizens called him the Molten Lion. He had a youthful face, but he was already 30 years old. Of the three major wars in the country, he took part in all of them. Harland gained a lot of great achievements during the wars. Subsequently, the king conferred upon him the title of 'Southwest Lion' and a decent-sized territory. The territory he gained was smaller than Lennon City but could still be considered a large one.Harland showed Angele a gesture of goodwill by lending him his private carriage. This gesture caused Angele to try and make sense of whatever Harland wanted from him. The two of them both considered each other a threat unless Angele sided with Harland, which the latter indicated it to be a great thing. If Angele refused to do so, however, Harland would no longer treat him in a friendly manner.Harland mentioned a lot about the rich reserves he discovered outside the city, and he even showed his desire of expanding his territory. He wasn't satisfied with what he had, so he desired more. To Harland, it was an infallible certainty for him to obtain whatever he wanted if he tried.Angele had decided to settle down here, so he thought it was alright to join Harland's side. Still, he would rather initially ascertain the benefits in doing so.Angele returned to his shop. He was surprised to see Tia still training with a twig in the backyard. She kept repeating the basic movements Angele taught today.\"That's enough, Tia. You should go back and have a good rest. Don't go too hard on yourself. Your right hand is still recovering,\" Angele told her after he threw a dry towel over.\"Understood, Master,\" Tia replied.\"Just call me Teacher.\" Angele corrected her.\"Yes, Teacher!\" Tia enthusiastically said. She wiped the sweat off her body and refilled the water bucket at the well. Before leaving, she cleaned the towel first before returning it to Angele.Angele found out that Tia had cleaned all the rooms for him and even mopped the floor. Because of that, Angele felt satisfied with the student he took in.**************************Time flew.Angele stayed most of his time in his shop. He meditated, studied, trained his sword skills, and also tried to learn the secret skill he obtained before from the Snake of Sand Forest. Angele spent most of his spare time teaching Tia, and he went hunting with Harland twice. This new acquaintance of his invited him several times to private wine parties. At night, Angele would craft new potions using all the materials he could get his hands into the city as he tried to further his knowledge in Potion Study.Harland had somehow found the horses Angele lost before and sent it back to him. Right after, the two horse thieves were arrested and sentenced to death with their carcasses getting discarded in the forest.Angele had always known he wasn't that talented. He needed a long time to become a rank 3 Wizard apprentice, so he began to search for the Dragon Scale Flower and the Spartame Blue Stone. The Spartame Blue Stone was another rare mineral that could help Angele increase his mentality, and also difficult to obtain.Though Angele didn't have high expectations of finding any of the two, he still amassed all the information he could find around the city. If he found one of them, the path to becoming a rank 3 Wizard apprentice would be much easier.Angele kept doing those things for the next two months.***************************Crack*The sound of a beaker breaking into pieces was loud. Angele looked disappointed as he disposed the broken glass fragments into the garbage bin. The bin was already full of broken glass.\u201cAnother one, gone,\u201d Angele mumbled. He started to think while staring at the equipment on the desk. Angele's desk was round, having a diameter of 3 meters. It was the largest object inside the shop. There were several different types of potion concocting equipment arranged on the desk, most of which had a red hue while the rest were transparent.\u201cThe standard of the equipment is worse than the ones in school. Most of these can barely handle just one experiment,\u201d Angele said. He took another transparent beaker out of a wooden box from under the desk.There were three large crates underneath, all made of black wood. One contained equipment, while the other two contained herbs. Angele segregated the fresh herbs and the dried herbs into these two crates.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: Success (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele took a dark red herb from the crate. He initially sniffed it before he put some of its leaves inside his mouth. After several seconds, Angele threw away the herb without saying a word and took out a mud-like material from the other crate.Angele tasted it, only to throw the whole piece away afterward. He kept repeating this procedure until he finally found something of use to him.Angele looked surprised but was also happy. He was currently holding an egg-sized yellow ball full of holes, scrutinizing it with his eyes.\u201cI hope this one works.\u201d Angele stared at this yellow ball.He placed it inside a large beaker by the right side of the desk and grabbed a small glass bottle filled with some white, slimy liquid. He then poured some of the liquid into the large beaker.Angele had a serious face while pouring the liquid, his eyes glowing with blue, shiny spots. With the chip's assistance, Angele could easily measure the number of materials and amount he needed. Angele closed off the glass bottle with a lid and put it down. He turned around, walking toward a small, black wooden box from the corner of the room. Inside the box was filled with green powder.Angele scooped a bit of the green powder and sprinkled it into the beaker, white steam coming out of it right away. The green powder had begun to coagulate upon contact with the white liquid and burn from the flame that turned blue. The fire heated up the yellow ball and continuously produced steam out of it.Angele maintained calmness as he poured some water onto the ball. With the vapor filling up the entirety of the room, he could barely see anything.Angele waved his left index finger in the air and chanted.*Whoosh*Angele controlled the energy particles in the air and created a wind to blow away the steam out of his room.Angele could finally see what remained in the beaker. The yellow ball had now melted, resulting in some slimy liquid that looked like a pile of mud mixed with water. The surface of the yellow liquid glowed under the light.Angele looked excited, and the blue light spots in his eyes brightened.\u2018Successfully synthesized the substitute material. Usage of such material in the concoction of Awakening Potion is now possible. Please name the new material.\u2019 Angele heard Zero\u2019s voice resounding in his mind.'Name it Green Water.' Green had been Angele's nickname, and he decided to use it as the name of the byproduct of the synthesis. He had collected more than one thousand types of materials, and with the assistance of the chip, he attempted to synthesize different materials to fabricate new types of materials. Finally, he had been able to create a substitute for the main component in the formula of Awakening Potion, and it gave him hope.\u2018Show me the comparison of Green Water and Dragon Scale Flower and tell me how similar they are.\u2019 Angele was extremely excited at this point. He tried to calm down as he ordered Zero.\u2018Comparing... inputting the formula... more information on the Dragon Scale Flower required... more practical data required... simulation model created.\u2019 Zero maintained its task unabatingly.\u2018Analyzing the results... If you use the Green Water as a substitute for the Dragon Scale Flower, the possibility of reaching half the effect of the original formula is 81.5%.\u2019Angele nodded his head. The result could already be considered good enough. Though the yellow ball called the Night Honeycomb was expensive, it was still much easier to obtain compared to the Dragon Scale Flower. Also, wizards uncommonly used Night Honeycombs in their researches and experiments, so he could easily purchase it from typical merchants.Also, Angele needed the chip to monitor the material creation process. Otherwise, it would be difficult for him to control the temperature and amount of water. Every step must be done accurately and timed accordingly.Without the chip, even a formal wizard wouldn't be capable of recreating the formula of Green Water. Angele didn't need to hide the formula. Even if he decided to teach the concoction process to someone else, it was nigh impossible for someone to concoct it successfully.The concocting process involved the use of mentality. As each person had differing types of Mentality, this had become a critical factor in potion concoction, albeit how minuscule the difference was. Zero had formulated the plan based on Angele's mentality. It would be a farfetched idea for someone to obtain similar results as him. Only Angele could use a particular method in synthesizing substitute materials.\u2018Zero, begin the simulation.\u2019 Angele held the beaker in his hand and looked at the slimy, yellow liquid while smiling.\u2018Initializing simulation\u2026 Time required: 15 minutes.\u2019\u2018Also, show me my body model.\u2019A blue hologram appeared in front of Angele's vision right away. The simulated model of his body was rotating horizontally, bits of information shown beside it. The information contained Angele's heart rate, brain activity, and all his attributes. Some of his body statistics were interminably changing, but most remained within a certain numerical range.\u20184.0 Mentality already?\u2019 Angele looked at his attributes bar, 4.0 showing beside Mentality. The values after the decimal point were ever-changing but still relatively stable.\u2018My body is stronger than before, my genes are improving, and even the chip has become more accurate with its calculations. Initially, it could only monitor up to the hundredths. Now, it could now calculate values up to the billionth,\u2019 Angele thought.However, my mentality didn't increase significantly. I'll need to concoct an Awakening Potion. I'm 16 years old already, so if I can't reach stage 3, I'll never become a wizard in the future. I must hurry.' Using the Awakening Potion was his best chance.Ten minutes later.\u2018Simulation finished. The success rate of concocting the Awakening Potion is 23.15%.' Angele became relieved upon hearing Zero's report.\u2018The rate is decent. I'll at least succeed once every five tries... Okay... Zero, show me the procedures.\u2019 Angele's expression changed, turning that of solemnness.\u2018Step 1\u2026\u2019**************************Half an hour later\u2026Angele walked out of his room and entered the backyard. He took a deep breath and smiled. He raised his arm and there was a small silver bottle in his right hand.\u201cFinally, the first Awakening Potion! The amount I used was enough to be used for four attempts, yet I only succeeded once. I need to get my hands on more Night Honeycombs,\u201d Angele spoke in a solemn tone.\u2018Now, let me give this a try.\u2019 Angele locked all the doors and windows. He didn\u2019t want anyone to interrupt him.He returned to his room and sat on his bed with his legs crossed. Angele pulled the glass cork out of the bottle carefully. The dark, slimy liquid suffused a chocolate-like fragrance from its container throughout the room.\u2018Well, it smells like chocolate. I hope it tastes like an actual one, too.\u2019 Angele shook his head before pouring everything into his mouth.*Clang*Angele dropped the small bottle, causing it to hit the wall. He had a pained expression on his face.The potion tasted nothing like chocolate. It was salty and spicy, and it tasted like a hot seafood soup with a strange aftertaste. It was the most pungent liquid Angele ever drank. Sweat was rolling down his face, and his clothes were completely soaked.Angele's face turned red caused by the burning sensation he was feeling in his throat and stomach.\u2018Show me my Mentality, Zero.\u2019 Angele tried his best not to throw up.\u2018Monitoring the Mentality\u2026Your Mentality is increasing.4.1\u20264.15\u2026\u2019\u2026Angele had no idea how much time passed, but he finally began feeling better soon after. His clothes and bed, however, were wet.\u2018Zero, what\u2019s the new value of my Mentality?\u2019 Angele got out of his bed and stood up with a tired face.\u2018Your Mentality attribute is 4.2 units.\u2019 Angele inhaled once. He felt a bit relieved after hearing the result.\u2018One Awakening Potion increased my Mentality by 0.2 units, yet this one that I concocted only had half the effect of the original formula. To enhance my Mentality to 6 units and reach the next rank, I need ten potions. I need to keep looking for substitute materials and concoct more potions to drink.\u2019 Angele looked at his wet clothes.\u2018But it tasted extremely awful\u2026\u2019 Angele still felt a lingering fear toward it.\u2018Wait\u2026 I haven\u2019t used the Black Lead Potion yet\u2026\u2019 The Awakening Potion was the first potion Angele tried, but at this moment, he didn't want to even think about potions.The potion was extremely spicy. Angele's throat and stomach were still aching. He could tolerate the pain but not the feeling of nausea. Angele didn't have any other choice, so he had to stick with potions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76: Promotion (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cSold out?\u201d Angele stood beside the counter with his brows furrowed.\u201cYes, sorry, the ones you purchased last time was all we had,\u201d the lady at the counter tactfully answered.\u201cI apologize once again.\u201d She bowed.Angele stood in front of a counter in a large herb store. The rays of the sun at noon came right through the entrance, causing his boots to shine.There were eight clerks taking orders of the customers, and Angele was talking to one of them.\"I heard Grace Herb Store is the best in the city. Can you double-check with other branches to see if they still have stock?\" Angele didn't want to give up.\u201cI am afraid they don\u2019t. The one you bought last time was the last Night Honeycomb we had. I am sorry to disappoint you, but we don\u2019t have anything in stock right now.\u201d The clerk apologized again.\u201cCan you tell me where you get the Night Honeycombs from?\u201d Angele already spent the whole trying to buy the Night Honeycombs, and this one was his last hope.\u201cWe buy them from the people living around here. If you truly need it now, I'd suggest you check the forest around the city. If you are lucky, you'll find the Night Bees. We don't have people who can collect them, so we can only purchase them from others,\u201d the clerk explained.\u201cFine.\u201d Angele nodded.Angele left the store and began to head back to his shop. He was still contemplating to figure out a way to obtain more Night Honeycombs. Angele had successfully concocted his first Awakening Potion last month and spent the rest of the month trying to buy Night Honeycombs from the herb stores in the city. However, he was only able to buy two, and none of the stores had the channels to purchase more for him.Angele's luck was good as he was able to concoct three potions out of the two Night Honeycombs. His Mentality reached 4.9 units within one month after drinking the two potions and meditating every day. If he could get five or six more Night Honeycombs, it would be enough for him to reach the next rank. However, there was no more stock left in the city. It was quite likely that he had to go to the forest and obtain them by himself.The problem lied in the Night Bees. With their needles coated with deadly venom, no one would be able to take the honeycombs if they were present in the vicinity. Night Bees were nocturnal creatures, and their dark outer shells made it difficult to detect them in the hours of darkness. Night Bees took several lives every year: they were dangerous since they attacked anyone who wandered in their territories.Additionally, the Night Bees' honeycombs were small, and they would carry their honeycombs with them while moving to other areas.Angele returned to his shop only to find a carriage parked right in front of the entrance. Engraved on the body of the carriage was an insignia depicting a sunflower and a white bird. It was from the lord's castle.A group of full-armored guards stood beside the carriage, and among them were several people who seemed like officers. The alley was much cleaner than it was before, and the awful stench that reeked was gone. Tia was standing outside the door, looking at the carriage curiously. She was here to deliver food.The officers walked toward Angele right after they saw him.\u201cMaster Angele, you're back. Mr. Harland is waiting for you. We've arrived here since an hour ago,\u201d one of the officers spoke in a respectful tone. They were in-charge of the area, and they didn't want to mistreat Harland's guest.The guards knew that the young man in front of them was someone invited to banquets in the Lord's castle. Thus, they realized that Angele was a person they couldn't afford to offend. They once visited the shop before, and Angele told them that he disliked being disturbed, so they decided to improve the environment around the alley instead.\u201cMr. Harland?\u201d Angele was confused for a second, and then he looked at the carriage.\u201cAngele, I hear you've been looking for Night Honeycombs. You should've just asked me instead. We're friends, right?\u201d Harland got off the carriage with a smile. He was wearing a white cape.\u201cOf course, we are.\u201d Angele smiled.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t an urgent matter, so I decided to check the herb stores first.\u201d\"Well, I hope you still need more.\" As Harland waved his right hand, a guard stepped forward holding a black wooden box.Harland took it and handed it over to Angele.\u201cThere are several Night Honeycombs inside. You can take it if you want.\u201d Harland had an honest smile on his face.Angele opened the box and saw eight Night Honeycombs inside, each wrapped in black clothes. The way it was packed looked great.\"I do need them. Thanks.\" Angele looked happy. He slowly nodded as he closed the box.\"Glad I could help.\" Harland nodded.\"I have to go now. I still got some work to do.\"\"Sure.\" Angele stood there watching them depart.After they had left the alley, Angele reopened the box. He looked at the Night Honeycombs; seven of them seemed to be aged, probably sitting inside the storage for years. However, one of them looked fresh \u2014 its color was bright. He saw some blood stains on its surface.Angele furrowed his brows. He grabbed the honeycomb and sniffed it.\"It is blood. A weighty gift,\" Angele murmured.He wondered why Harland decided to collect a fresh one aside from the seven old ones. Doing so most likely resulted in Harland losing several people. Though Harland tried to erase the traces of bloodstain, Angele had stronger and keener senses than average people, so he detected the blood on it with ease.Based on the information he obtained from the clerks of herb stores, Night Bees had twice the speed of an adult male, and only knight-level warriors were capable of dodging some of their attacks. Furthermore, they were tiny, and their needles could easily penetrate leather armor. If they had decided to don heavy armor, they wouldn't be able to catch up with the bees' speed.The Night Bees were nocturnal, which made them even harder for people to capture. A knight-level warrior probably left the bloodstain on it wherein causing Angele to think of it as a weighty gift.\u2018Though they obtained Night Honeycombs, Harland most likely didn't find the other materials I requested. I can't go to Rifts, and those materials are too difficult to obtain.\u2019 Angele shook his head and entered the shop with the box in his hands.Angele told Tia to train in the backyard. Afterward, he sat by the table and took the Night Honeycombs out of the box. He placed those honeycombs inside a large glass bottle filled with clear liquid.Angele had obtained the materials he needed, so he wanted to pay attention to the concoction of potions. Eight Night Honeycombs were enough to concoct eight Awakening Potions. With these potions and the supplement of meditation, he could easily grow his Mentality to 6 units.************************************************Time flew.A week later.Angele sat on his bed with his legs crossed, his expression calm. He had been unlucky these days. He only successfully concocted seven Awakening Potions, though he still managed to increase his Mentality to 6.2 units. Angele had initially expected to attain a 6.3 Mentality. However, his body seemingly began to resist the potion's effects.\u2018Well, at least I met the requirements.\u2019 Angele was relieved.Angele asked Tia to take two days off. He didn't want anyone to interrupt him during the process.Angele looked at the crystal clock on the table. It was 2:10 p.m. Angele got off the bed and took out the Black Lead Potion from the bag.The bottle was the length of a palm and made from some silver metal. The rim of the bottle was sealed using a brown stopper. Angele placed the Black Lead Potion on the table before he took the tinderbox out of the drawer and struck the flint to light up the oil lamp. The oil lamp used a different type of fuel \u2014 one that looked like solid, white fat.Angele set a beaker onto the metal holder over the flame and poured some light red liquid into it. He then grabbed a test tube that had yellow powder contained inside.Angele sprinkled some yellow powder into the beaker, causing the red liquid inside to turn blue and cloudy within a second. He heated the beaker right after.Ten minutes later.The blue liquid inside the beaker was no longer boiling as it was before, but its color turned darker into something nearly black. When Angele began to smell a fragrance of flowers in the room, he thought that everything was prepared accordingly and nodded his head. He then grabbed the Black Lead Potion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Promotion (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeWith a serious face, Angele held the bottle in one hand and the glass pliers in the other. He carefully removed the stopper from the bottle, barely escaping the onslaught of smoke coming out of it.Slowly, the green smoke amassed itself in the air, forming into a hazy outline of a woman's face. A pungent odor replaced the fleeting fragrance of flowers that pervaded the air. Angele had his brows furrowed as he pointed at the woman's forehead with his finger.The woman opened her mouth slowly as soon as Angele's finger made contact with her forehead, and then a black beetle crawled out of it. On the back of the beetle was a white crying face about the size of a nail. Angele grabbed this insect and quickly threw it into the large beaker nearby.*Waah*Suddenly, Angele heard wailing sounds from the blue liquid, actually originating from the black beetle. Its screams sounded like an infant crying from agonizing pain. As this continued to occur, the beetle was melting inside the beaker while the blue liquid continually dissolved it.Angele furrowed his brows. When he further increased the temperature, the light of the fire dyed his face red. The noise produced by the beetle gradually grew fainter and disappeared after several seconds.The blue liquid inside the beaker finally started to boil. The green smoke slowly returned to the bottle and the outline of a woman's face dissipated at the same time. Angele kept his sight on the beaker as he poured the rest of the potion into it. Upon contact, the green substance mixed the blue liquid that had become darker and turned completely black after several seconds.Angele stirred the solution with a glass rod. He was satisfied with the result. He didn't care if the beaker was still hot, taking it and drinking all of its contents. Angele put down the beaker, not feeling any change.\u2018Your condition is currently unstable.\u2019\u2018Mentality is increasing\u2026 being influenced by radiation energy\u2026\u2019\u2018Unknown radiation energy is damaging your body. Emergency plan activated, releasing energy particles for defense.\u2019\u2018Special radiation energy expelled, 45% of total energy particles consumed, attempting to extract discharged radiation energy... Attempt unsuccessful.\u2019 Angele was reading the event log recorded by Zero after he drank the potion. He checked the hologram of his body to see the changes.He could see the dark energy particles flowing through his body, damaging all the organs it passed. The emergency measure Angele set was enabled. The energy stored in his body forced the dark energy out, but the dark energy was fast, still leaving traces inside Angele's body.\u2018A portion of the dark energy is still inside my body. That is a problem,\u2019 Angele thought.\u2018Zero, show me my condition.\u2019 Angele felt cold, and his body was aching.\u2018Body tissues are 5% damaged. Leftover dark energy is influencing the growth of your Mentality. Your gene strands are unstable, some already breaking. Use more energy particles to force the remaining dark energy out?\u2019\u2018No!\u2019 Angele's face was stern as he looked at the growing Mentality value.\u20186.46.56.66.76.86.9\u2026\u2019Suddenly, the value rose from 6.9 to 10, and it was still increasing.\u201810.110.210.3\u2026\u2019\u2018Warning! 14% of your body tissue is damaged. It will become fatal once it exceeds 30%. Please take action.\u2019 Zero's mechanical voice echoed within Angele's mind.\u201820% damaged.\u2019 As Angele focused on the percentage value, he began to sweat.Angele wanted the number to rise again since it was his best chance. The first jump increased his Mentality from 7 to 10 units. It was probably the best result he could get from drinking the Black Lead Potion, but he wanted to wait for the second jump.Theoretically speaking, the Black Lead Potion could increase one's Mentality dramatically, but people who had taken one couldn't handle the side effects.\u2018Based on my calculations, the second jump has better results than the first one! I have to take this opportunity\u2026\u2019 Angele was nervous. He no longer felt any pain from his body that had gone paralyzed, and he could barely stay conscious.\u201825% damaged. Increased Mentality to 10.5.\u2019\u201828% damaged. Increased Mentality to 10.8.\u2019\u201829% damaged.\u2019At this point, Angele could no longer handle it, \u2018Cleanse my body of the remaining dark energy!\u2019\u2018Releasing all the stored energy particles. Cleansing has begun.\u2019 Right before Zero released the energy particles, the value of Angele's Mentality jumped once again, from 10.8 to 15. Angele, who saw this change, felt relieved before he closed his eyes and fell to the ground.Angele laid on the ground motionlessly. Suddenly, a horrifying scene ensued as his body began to spasm violently, his muscles started to cramp, and his skin turned red; his eyes had long rolled back into his head.Looking closely, black specks of light covered by red and green light were coming out of Angele's body. The light particles vanished in the air after leaving his skin.\u2018Finally, I succeeded.\u2019 Angele was still suffering, but he was feeling excited about the results.All of a sudden, the temperature of the room dropped to the extent that Angele felt cold.*Kata-kata*Angele heard light footsteps coming toward him.Only after exerting great effort did Angele somehow turned his head toward the source of the sound. He witnessed a group of zombified monsters approaching him. They surrounded Angele \u2014 some were enemies Angele had long slain before while some were bizarre creatures he had never seen before.There was nothing Angele could do. After all, he was still in a paralyzed state. He could only lay there as he watched the zombies closing in. The one closest to him was already rotten in a way that Angele could barely recognize its face. It was releasing a disgusting stench, even dripping with a slimy fluid of some kind. Black beetles were crawling out of its right arm.Angele exerted a lot of effort to move, but all he could do was turn his head. Ultimately, those creatures reached him. They bit Angele's neck hard with their sharp teeth, and blood cascaded out of his wounds. Angele never felt any pain. He only observed them as they devoured him. With his body torn apart and his bones piled atop his head, Angele watched this entire process with unabating clarity.Fear pressed against Angele like cushion over his mouth and nose, barely able to breathe. He couldn't comprehend what was happening.*Chi*Everything disappeared after a slight noise sounded out. It was as though nothing had happened. The room became warm and peaceful again.Only after half an hour did Angele recover finally from the fear he felt.\u2018Finally... it's over,\u2019 Angele thought.Everything had just been an illusion. Angele was still in one piece, and he started to feel his limbs again.Angele remained still on the ground lying down. He tried to move his arms. After he successfully touched his face, he felt relieved. It meant the side effects of the potion was gone.\u2018The Black Lead Potion must have some secrets to it. It can't be as simple as what the book mentioned. This potion is cursed and filled with hatred. It may even contain souls.\u2019 Angele still felt horrified upon thinking of what had just transpired.\u2018Zero, search the database and get me all the information related to the concoction of Black Lead Potion,\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Searching... finished. Data is incomplete.\u2019 Zero finished its job immediately.\u2018Black Lead Potion's fake formula: Sivia Bird, Soul Eater Beetle, Heart of the Alice Tree, Lead Solution.\u2019\u2018Fake?\u2019 Angele wasn't surprised.\u2018So, does it contain something strange? Show me the real formula.\u2019Zero started to show the data before Angele's eyes:\u2018Real formula: 18-year-old female, pregnant for five months. Soul Eater Beetles and various unknown materials.\u2019\u2018Possible concoction procedure: First, make the pregnant female die in fear and preserve her body. Second, inject the Black Lead solution into her womb and melt the fetus. Third, extract the melted fetus and turn it into a solution. The obtained solution can be used to concoct 5 Black Lead Potions. Actual procedure unknown but likely to be nearly identical.\u2019\u201cWhat the...!\u201d Angele started vomiting upon learning the truth.When Angele realized he had drunk a solution concocted from a dead fetus, his abdominal wall muscles had begun to contract violently.\u201cI swear! I'll make sure the formula is real... HUUUURGGEHH\u2026\u201d Angele kneeled on the ground and continued vomiting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78: The Hunt (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter the congealed contents of his stomach emerged onto the ground, Angele almost collapsed. He stood up slowly and sat on the chair. The puke on the ground made the whole shop smell bad.Angele rested for a while, then found the tools to clean up the ground. He dumped all the mess into the garbage bin and mopped the ground several times. He then threw the garbage bin to the waste collection place on the street.\u201cI\u2019m a rank 3 apprentice now.\u201d Angele sat down again, feeling much better after finishing cleaning the shop.\u2018Zero, record the mentality cost of the spells I cast,\u2019 Angele said.\u2018Recording\u2026\u2019Everything turned blue in Angele\u2019s view for a second, then returned to normal right after.\u2018Start the regular experimenting mode.\u2019Regular experimenting mode was a mode designed by Angele. He could monitor all the data related to his experiment under this mode while the blue indicators would stay hidden to avoid blocking his sight.\u201cFirst, the Hand of Exhaustion.\u201dFrom his pouch, Angele took out a finger-sized bottle which was filled with white powder.Angele removed the stopper, poured some powder onto his palm, and put the bottle back into his pouch. He clasped his hands together and rubbed them once. It sounded like he was rubbing glass shards between his palms.Angele stayed calm and started to chant the incantation. It kept on coming out of his mouth in a weird tone. Slowly, his hands\u2019 color started to turn from white to a darker color, and after several seconds, they became red like blood.Angele stopped casting the spell and started to carefully observe the changes that had happened to his hands. His skin had turned red, and his nails were shining, but he had to look closely to see the red shiny dots on the edges of his nails.Angele was staring at the data showed in front of his eyes. He was reading the temperature, hardness, radiation, spectrum, duration, and various other properties of the spell. Most of the numbers were stable, but some were changing rapidly.Angele compared the data to the ones from previous experiments, finding that the power of the spell had generally increased, and he had spent less time channeling the spell.\u2018Zero, I have enough mentality to improve level 0 spells, right?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018Requirements are met. Mentality 15.0. One level 0 spell can be improved.\u2019\u2018Can you improve the Hand of Exhaustion? It\u2019s better if I can skip the spell powder.\u2019\u2018Improvement plan for Hand of Exhaustion created\u2026 Expected results after the improvement:The Hand of Exhaustion (Improved) \u2013 Spell level 0Cost: 1.5 mentality points. 1.5 mana points.Effect: Strike the enemies with negative energy and exhaust them.Effective distance: Direct contact.Casting Time: 3 seconds. Spell fails if interrupted.Weaknesses: Enemies with high Stamina can resist the exhaustion effect.Improvements: Spell can be casted without spell powder. Casting time will be reduced by one second.Information acquired from: Fundamentals of Spells, Fundamentals of Negative Energy, Casting and Channeling, Touch of Solomon - Explanations on all the Level 0 Direct Contacting Spells.Angele had a satisfied look on his face. \u2018How long will it take to improve the spell? Can you improve the spell again after the first improvement is done? Also, can you turn it into a ranged spell?\u2019\u2018Based on the current information in the database, it is impossible to improve it again. The improvement will take 152 hours, and it will cost 14.2 mentality points.\u2019Angele was not disappointed; he was satisfied with the results of the first improvement. He had learnt the Hand of Exhaustion because he wanted to strike before the enemy could react. Though the casting time was long, and he would not be able to use it against a prepared opponent, it was still a good spell in terms of its effect\u2019s duration and power. It would take effect the moment Angele touched an enemy with his hands.He had tried it on a Single Horn Bull, and the bull lost its ability to fight right after Angele touched its body. The bull\u2019s Stamina was about 3 or 4, but it could not resist the exhaustion. The Hand of Exhaustion was one of the most useful low-level spells he could get.\u2018I need to acquire more knowledge before I can ask the chip to improve the spell again. I probably need more books about the fundamentals of the spells,\u2019 Angele thought.Once the opponent was exhausted by the spell, the exhaustion would last for about an hour, but it was possible for the enemy to remove the negative energy while still being exhausted.Angele clapped his hands, and some red mist appeared in the air, then disappeared after Angele\u2019s hands turned back to their normal color.\u2018Now I can learn as many level 0 spells as I want. However, I need to figure out how I want to use them, otherwise, the spells may even slow down my speed. Wasting mentality points during a fight will never be a good idea.\u2019Angele knew what he needed to do.\u201cI need to focus on one specific type of spells!\u201dAngele made up his mind.\u2018The spells I learnt were all from the negative energy category, but the energy particles I can store in my body are Air and Fire. I barely stored any negative energy particles, and that\u2019s the problem. I should\u2019ve bought some Air and Fire spells when I was still in the school. I\u2019m sure I could enhance those spells while casting them,\u2019 he thought.\u2018The school is in chaos right now, so it\u2019s impossible for me to buy basic spells there. What should I do?\u2019Angele scrunched his eyebrows, trying to figure out a way to buy more spells. He finally reached rank 3, but he needed more resources. When he was at the school, he did not have enough magic stones to buy everything he wanted.\u2018Master Adolf was an apprentice, and he lived as a professor in the Marua Harbour. It\u2019s totally possible that there are people like him living in the Ramsoda Empire, so I just need to find them and exchange resources with them. That could solve my spell model problem.\u2019 Angele kept thinking. \u2018Also, there must be books like the Wizard\u2019s book that I have. I should try and find some. For now, I will make my Mentality more stable, and improve the Hand of Exhaustion.\u2019The next thing Angele wanted to know was how the increase of Mentality changed him.In order to calculate the casting time of a spell, Angele needed to create the model and stop right before casting the spell. After he reached rank 3, he could cast spells much faster than before. Previously, he needed three seconds to cast the Stun Spell, but now he only needed two. Angele could store spells on his chip so the improvement on casting speed was not significant.However, the next point was important.Angele could cast more spells during fights with higher Mentality, and the spells became more powerful than before. The reason was simple, if one considered Mentality as Strength. A man with higher Strength would be able to strike harder with the same weapon compared to a man with an average Strength, that way, a Wizard with higher Mentality would be able to cast a more powerful spell.Also, Angele increased his Mentality to 15, and it met the Mentality requirement of becoming a Wizard. It was something Angele hadn\u2019t expected the potion to be able to do.Being promoted to Wizard was not just about how high the apprentice\u2019s Mentality was, he would also need the help from outside. Angele\u2019s Mentality was 15, and it was probably the limit for human beings. If he wanted to increase it again, he would need to break the limit. Wizards did research and found out that they could combine certain materials to produce a new substance that could help apprentices break the Mentality limit.The apprentices that successfully broke the limit could become Wizards, and the substance that helped them break through it was named the Water of Asu. The word \u2018Asu\u2019 meant breaking the limit.The Water of Asu was one requirement for an apprentice to become a Wizard, while the other one was to obtain as much knowledge as possible. The apprentice needed to know how to handle the various situations that could happen during the breaking of the limit.Also, obtaining more knowledge would help Angele to learn to solidify the mentality models.Angele raised his hands and touched his palms. He felt his whole body was in his control, and he could react to things much quicker.\u2018Water of Asu, solid mentality models, those two requirements are a pain\u2026 I can buy the Water of Asu from any large Wizard organization, but I need to choose a spell structure and use my mentality to solidify the model. After I acquire the solid mentality model, I will be able to make it my Talent Spell. It\u2019s better if I can make a solid defensive mentality model, otherwise, it won\u2019t be too helpful during fights.\u2019Angele had a lot of problems to worry about. He needed more basic spells, and he also needed a good defensive spell that suited his fighting style. He would be weaker than other Wizards if he chose the wrong defensive spell.The reason why Wizards were so strong was the defensive Talent Spell they had. A Wizard always had a force field blocking attacks for him, and since it is a Talent Spell, he did not need to cast it. It was like a passive defensive skill. Some Wizards tried to harden their skin to prevent basic physical attacks, something apprentices could not do. Also, the Talent Spell barely cost a Wizard any mentality, and some Wizards could keep the force field around themselves permanently.\u2018I wonder how\u2019s the situation in the school.\u2019 Angele started to miss the life in the school. \u2018After the war, the school might call us apprentices back since it\u2019s not the first time that they get invaded by the Northland Wizards. It\u2019s happened several times in the history of the school.\u2019He took the gray robe out of the wardrobe and turned it over; there was a black cross sign on the back of it. This black cross sign would shine when the school wanted to call all the apprentices back. This was one of the reasons why the school let all the apprentices leave\u2014the president could order them back whenever he wanted to.\u2018I hope they can solve the problem quickly.\u2019 Angele knew there was nothing he could do. \u2018But I heard it\u2019s very hard to break the limit. I just reached rank 3 and I should take my time to prepare.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: The Hunt (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeOne month later.In the library of the Lennon City Lord\u2019s castle.The marble tiled floor was smooth, colorful, and had a brown circle pattern on it. All the small circles were inside a large red circle. There were more than ten bookshelves in the room, and yellow oil lamps were glowing gently on the walls. A young man in a white suit was standing next to one of the shelves reading a thick book carefully.The young man had an average-looking face, and his skin was a bit pale. His short brown hair barely covered his ears, and he looked just like any other noble playboy, though the suit he was wearing did not cover his muscular body.That young man was Angele, who looked wild but gentle.He had gotten the permission to enter the lord\u2019s library and read the books the lord had collected. It was to try and find more books like the Wizard\u2019s book he had.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Angele sighed and closed the book. \u201cThis one isn\u2019t made by a Wizard, either.\u201dAngele was disappointed, and he put down the last book he had wanted to check.*Creak*Someone opened the door.\u201cMaster Angele, have you found anything useful to you?\u201dA man with a pretty face walked into the room. It was Tinos, and he was still wearing a black leather suit, his short blonde hair combed to one side.Angele could still not believe that Tinos was male. He couldn\u2019t imagine how attractive the man would be if he tried to wear some female clothing. Angele thought for a second and carefully returned the book back to its place on the shelf. He then turned back and smiled.\u201cMr. Tinos, what brings you here? Although there are plenty of books here, I failed to find the ones I wanted,\u201d Angele said.Tinos closed the door and slowly walked towards Angele with a red leather whip in his hands.\u201cMaster Angele, you\u2019ve changed your hairstyle? Last time I saw you, you still had long hair, and I think you looked great with it,\u201d Tinos noted, his words focused on some irrelevant things first. \u201cMy scout has reported that he found a Glowing Beast in the forest around the Lennon City. It had attacked several teams of merchants and also injured a number of hunters. My father and my brother are going to hunt it down, I am wondering if you are interested?\u201d\u201cGlowing Beast?\u201d Angele lowered his head and started to think.The Glowing Beast\u2019s name came from its appearance\u2014the beast was blue and its skin was always glowing. Based on the description found in the books, an adult Glowing Beast was three meters tall and three to four meters long. It was about the size of a below-average Asian Elephant. The beast was very special to Wizards and their apprentices due to the value of its heart. Both Wizards and their apprentices could easily make it into a basic enchanted item.Wizards or their apprentices could use the enchanted item to cast Glowing Fire Strikes, and the cooldown of the item was one day. The Glowing Beast\u2019s skin could also be made into high-quality leather armor suits. The beast was relatively easy to find on this land.\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never seen a Glowing Beast in real life, so I will join them.\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cThey will be leaving this afternoon. I will let them know you are interested right away.\u201d Tinos smiled, turned back, and quickly left the room.Recently, Tinos had begun to try and find all the reasons he could to spend time with Angele, and Angele knew Tinos wanted him to joins his side. Angele was not so sure about the reason but Tinos and Harland did not like each other, and Tinos was a bit nervous after learning that Harland was building a friendship with Angele.However, Angele liked Harland more because he was much stronger than Tinos.\u2018Glowing Beast\u2026\u2019 Angele was happy. \u2018If I can take its heart, I will be able to make a basic enchanted item.\u2019**************************Outside the west forest.A team of mounted soldiers in white plate armor suits left the city through the west city gate. That gate was not as busy as the main one, and there were not as many people around there.There were about twenty people in the team, and the leader was a handsome young man riding a white horse. The blonde man\u2019s body looked balanced and strong, his skin smooth like a marble sculpture\u2019s. He was leading the team, and two men were following after him on black horses. The man on the left was wearing a black hunting suit and the man on the right had a pretty face.Following the three, there were four fully geared knights and about ten mounted soldiers in white plate armor suits. The team was heading to the last location the Glowing beast had appeared at.The leading Knight was Harland Reed, and Angele and Tinos were following right after him. The fully geared knights were knight-level warriors, and the soldiers in white plate armor suits were some of the best in the lord\u2019s army.Harland kept checking the surroundings while slowly advancing. He saw the washbasin sized footprints on the grassland around the bridge, and he also saw some blood stains on the grasses.\u201cLast night, that Glowing Beast went to the west city gate and attacked several pedestrians. That\u2019s why you did not see many people around the gate. The footprints are easy to find, and the only thing we need to do is follow the trail,\u201d Harland said in a deep voice. \u201cThe Glowing Beast\u2019s skin is very hard, and I brought the best short iron spears I could find this time. After initiating with the spears, the four Knights need to step forward and try to block its attacks. The rest of you can act freely depending on the situation, and I will prevent it from escaping to the side.\u201cWhat about me? Brother? I am a Knight too? Where\u2019s the order for me?\u201d Tinos asked.\u201cTinos, you stay with Master Angele. Although people like Master Angele are very strong, they need time to prepare their spells, and you need to make sure the beast does not get anywhere close to him.\u201dHarland was not expecting Tinos to contribute to the team, so he asked him to stay with Angele, knowing that Angele would be able to protect him.\u201cThanks in advance for your help, Mr. Tinos.\u201d Angele smiled.\u201cI\u2019ve slain several Glowing Beasts during the war. They\u2019re not scary, but we still need to be careful with its Flame Breath.\u201d Harland patted the tower shield that was hanging on his saddle. The tower shield looked luxurious with the \u2018sunflower and white bird\u2019 emblem engraved in the middle of it.Angele kept smiling, he looked gentle and harmless. He tied his crossguard sword to his waist, no longer nervous while staying around a Grand Knight after having reached rank 3. Last time Zero had said that Angele had less than 50% chance to win a fight against Harland, but this time it had increased to 70%. Angele felt that he was much stronger than before based on the numbers.Harland waved his right hand, and one of the Knights moved towards him right away. They started to talk about how they should handle the various types of attacks from the Glowing Beast.Tinos was also talking with another Knight, but they were speaking in a language that Angele could not understand, and it made Angele feel a bit uncomfortable.The team entered the forest and followed the large footprints on the ground.Angele followed behind Harland, who was still talking to a Knight called Anthony. Angele heard some of the things they were talking about: they were planning on training the mounted soldiers later, and they were trying to eliminate all the possible threats within the territory.No one seemed nervous about hunting the Glowing Beast. The two other Knights behind Angele were talking about the new clubs that had opened up in the city recently.\u201cMaster Angele!\u201d Tinos finished his conversation with the Knight and turned back. \u201cMy Knight just told me that a ship full of rare goods just arrived at the Ricky Dock this morning, and they are auctioning some of the herbs tomorrow. I was wondering if you would be interested.\u201d\u201cAn auction, huh?\u201d Angele thought for a second. \u201cWill there be something like the Dragon Scale Flower?\u201d\u201cI am afraid not\u2026\u201d Tinos had a bitter smile on his face. \u201cThe Dragon Scale Flower is so rare that only people like you would have access to it. However, I heard the legendary body armor, Sun of the Tribe, would be auctioned tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThe Sun of the Tribe? How is that even possible?\u201d Angele was surprised, \u201cThat was the armor suit worn by the legendary Duke Stagger Plat.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not the original for sure. It\u2019s a replica,\u201d Tinos explained. \u201cThe genuine suit would not come to a city like Lennon. Merchants would bring it to the capital if they somehow got their hands on it. But there will be some rare goods from the Merfolk and several Water Fairy slaves on the auction. I\u2019m sure you will find something you like.\u201dTinos smiled, and he was blushing a bit. With his purple lips, Angele found him a bit coquettish.\u2018Do those Water Fairies look more pretty than you?\u2019 Angele really wanted to ask.But he decided not to ask a disrespectful question like that, and it would sound very weird anyway.Tinos did not notice what Angele was thinking.\u201cLast time I asked Sir Henry of the Ricky Merchant Association to bring me some special skin care products, and I heard those were the favorites of the Merfolk Princesses. I hope my order arrived with the ship this time. My skin is very dry recently,\u201d Tinos continued, and he sounded distressed.Angele decided not to comment on that. He did not want to question his own sexual orientation.\u201cAlso, Viscount Sparks from Loran City sent me some well-crafted weapons last month, some of them sharp and pretty. After we finish the Glowing Beast off, you can come by my castle and take several of them if you want. I haven\u2019t gotten the chance to send you a gift since we met, while I heard my brother gifted you some Night Honeycombs, and I think I need to prepare something, too,\u201d Tinos said.\u201cThank you for your kindness, but I like my sword,\u201d Angele declined the offer. \u201cWe\u2019re very close to the Glowing Beast so we need to stay alerted now.\u201dTinos was going to say something else, but he stopped after hearing Angele\u2019s words. \u201cSure, we can discuss it later.\u201dThe team arrived at the logging area, the place looking empty without all the trees. There were countless tree stumps on the ground.It was afternoon, the sunlight had weakened, and the area was extremely quiet.\u201cThis is one of Lennon City\u2019s official logging areas, and the sawmill is not too far from here. It was the first location that was attacked by the Glowing Beast,\u201d Harland said loudly. \u201cThe city\u2019s major source of income is the export of lumber, thus, even if we fail to kill the beast, we still need to make sure it doesn\u2019t stay in our territory. Workers fear it, and if they don\u2019t log, our financial situation will get worse.\u201dHarland\u2019s voice was loud and clear. Several birds were scared by his voice and flew away.\u201cUnderstood!\u201d all the soldiers yelled out.\u201cIt\u2019s getting close!\u201dHarland held his silver axe tight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80: The Hunt (3)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe sun was setting, and the team stopped advancing under the dimming light. Soldiers got off their horses and equipped themselves with the heavy weapons and shields they brought here. They then tied their horses beside a tree.Angele let one of the soldiers take care of his black horse and then walked straight toward the logging area to check the surroundings. He saw red flowers growing beside the bushes between the tree stumps. The place was misty and the visibility around was a bit poor.It was sultry, and the smell of blood mixed with the fragrance of grass was floating in the air. The Knights and the soldiers were trying to find traces of the beast in the bushes. Angele could hear something howling in the forest from a distance.\u201cDamn Ghost Birds, they\u2019re really making some disgusting noises!\u201d a soldier said in a light tone as he walked passed Angele.\u201cBut they\u2019re tasty.\u201d Another soldier laughed.\u201cHow about we catch some for dinner after we finish the beast off?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s take care of the beast first,\u201d a knight said, walking over. \u201cYou can catch as many as you want when we start the group training. Stay alert for now.\u201dThe soldiers around got noisy after hearing what the Knight said, some even clapping their hands while laughing.\u201cStop. We are on a mission.\u201d Harland waved his right hand.Angele was walking around the tree stumps alone. He sensed the presence of something dangerous, and he thought the place was way too quiet. They were deep in the forest, but he did not hear any insects making noise.He looked at Harland and saw a serious look on the Grand Knight\u2019s face. The man held his axe tight and was checking the surroundings with his eyebrows scrunched. He knew that something was wrong as well.Harland walked towards Angele and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Glowing Beast.\u201d He was still looking at the trees that were not cut down yet, wanting to make sure he was prepared for the oncoming threat.\u201c \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Angele nodded. \u201cGlowing Beasts are not cunning, they will come for us once they know we are here, but this one hid itself well.\u201dHarland nodded. He was wielding a large axe and a tower shield. Before he could respond, someone suddenly yelled, \u201cI found it! It\u2019s here! \u2026 AH!\u201d*Bang*A man was hit by something, and he was blown away by the impact. He screamed and died within seconds.\u201cWatch out!\u201d Harland yelled and rushed towards the soldier that just got killed. Several other soldiers also quickly ran to the body. There was a basketball-sized hole on the dead soldier\u2019s chest. It looked like the man was hit by something with extremely high temperature because there not a single drop of blood could be seen on the grass around him. The man\u2019s wound was clearly burned closed.\u201cGoddamn! It\u2019s Aurens\u2026\u201d A soldier who knew the man tried not to stare at the body.\u201cHis chest piece didn\u2019t do shit.\u201d Another soldier sighed.\u201cDamn! It\u2019s the Glowing Elephant! Not Glowing Beast!\u201d Harland had seen a similar wound before, and his expression changed. \u201cEveryone, rally to me!\u201dThe soldiers and Knights heard Harland yelling, and they quickly started to move towards his location. The situation was intense. No one was talking, and they all looked serious.\u201cJack, Belem!\u201dTwo strong Knights stepped forward after hearing Harland\u2019s order.\u201cYou guys go check that bush. Raise your shields and don\u2019t go too fast. Glowing Elephants are very strong. I just want you two to confirm its location, don\u2019t do anything stupid.\u201d Harland pointed at the bush that Aurens was attacked at.\u201cAffirmative!\u201dThe two started to walk slowly towards the bush.Angele and Tinos were at the end of the formation.Although there were two knights protecting Tinos, he was nervous, and he was holding his sword so tight that his knuckles turned white.Angele scrunched his eyebrows, listening carefully. \u2018Zero, do you know anything about the Glowing Elephant?\u2019\u2018Glowing Elephant: a mutant. Its size is about the same as the Glowing Beast\u2019s, but it is much faster. The Glowing Elephant prefers to attack its prey with its sharp tusks. You can make low-level enchanted items with its heart,\u2019 Zero answered quickly.\u2018Faster than the Glowing Beast?\u2019 Angele drew his sword, trying to figure out a plan.\u201cMaster Angele, please go to the top of that small hill with Tinos. We will take care of it,\u201d Harland spoke in a deep voice.Tinos gritted his teeth. \u201cMaster Angele, let\u2019s go. My brother can handle it, and there is nothing we can do here.\u201dAngele wanted to stay, but he did not have enough information about the Glowing Elephant, and Zero only showed him some common knowledge about it. It seemed that Harland had experience of fighting one in the past, and he wanted Angele to make sure Tinos did not get hurt. It also meant that Harland wasn\u2019t sure if he could protect his brother during the battle.They had seen how Aurens died at the logging site, and how the plate armor had done nothing for him. The Glowing Elephant had to have some exceptional strength to able to do something like that.\u201cAll right, let\u2019s go.\u201dAngele nodded, and they started to retreat with the two Knights by their side. They were heading to the top of a small hill not too far away; the Glowing Elephant was huge, and it would not be able to climb up a hill like that.They could also survey the battlefield from the top of the hill.The four looked down and saw another dead soldier. He was also penetrated by the Glowing Elephant\u2019s tusks. Angele heard Harland shout out a loud battle cry, and then the man rushed into the bush with two Knights covering the sides. There were many things going on, and the sounds made by the weapons were intense.The visibility down there was still bad.Angele suddenly heard the loud trumpet from the Glowing Elephant. Right after that, a shining red elephant stomped into the logging site, and the trees on its way were easily knocked down by it. The elephant was about four meters tall, five meters long, and it looked more like a mammoth than an elephant. Its hair was red, and its tusks were long and sharp.The elephant looked really strange with its glowing red hair, like the light was coming from inside its body, and it was almost translucent. The Glowing Elephant trumpeted again and grabbed a tree with its long trunk. It wielded the tree like a weapon, trying to hit the soldiers with it.*BAM*A Knight tried to block the attack with his greatsword, but he was not able to handle the elephant\u2019s force and was pushed back. The Knight hit a tree and stopped, his face pale.Harlan roared like a lion and jumped forward. He then hit one of the elephant\u2019s feet, hard. The elephant had just finished attacking with the tree and failed to defend. Right away, blood spurted from the wound. Harland raised his tower shield and quickly backed off.\u201cThrow the spears!\u201d he yelled while retreating.The soldiers around started to throw the short spears toward the elephant. The spears hit the elephant\u2019s skin but dealt almost no damage. The skin was extremely hard, and normal attacks would not do anything to it.The Glowing Elephant trumpeted in anger, and Angele felt the ground shaking.*Boom*The elephant rushed towards Harland and hit his shield. He was knocked back several meters, and the centre of his tower shield was dented.The soldiers did not stop throwing the spears, but most of them just dropped to the ground after hitting the elephant\u2019s skin, not even scratching it.\u201cDamn!\u201d Harland turned his head back and yelled, \u201cJack! You do it!\u201dThe Knight named Jack nodded and grabbed a short spear. He aimed at the elephant and threw the spear towards it at full speed.The short spear howled through the air, accurately hitting the right side of the elephant\u2019s body, and the spearhead finally cut the skin open. But there was barely any blood leaking from the wound because the elephant somehow moved its muscles to pressure the cut. It then rushed to the right and five soldiers were blown away. Even elite soldiers could not deal with the elephant\u2019s strength.The elephant then swung its tusks, and two of the soldiers failed to dodge the attack, getting skewered.*Sizzle*It sounded like their bodies were being roasted. The elephant swung its tusks again, and the dead soldiers were thrown back to the ground. Their chests were penetrated, but there was no blood coming out of the wounds.\u201cDon\u2019t get hit by its tusks, they\u2019re ablaze!\u201d Harland yelled. \u201cKnights, follow me! Others back off!\u201dHarland inhaled once, and it looked like his body was coated with white light.\u201cFor victory!\u201dHarland\u2019s angry battle cry echoed through the forest. He raised his tower shield and charged forward. His strength was so strong that the ground started to shake, and his footsteps sounded like thunder. He was approaching the Glowing Elephant at full speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: The Hunt (4)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeIt seemed like the huge creature had figured out who the real threat was to him. The Glowing Elephant turned back and lowered its head. It then aimed at Harland with its tusks and charged toward him.\u201cHA!\u201dHarland roared and struck the elephant with his tower shield.*BOOM*The loud sound of collision made everyone\u2019s ears ache.Harland\u2019s tower shield was almost broken, and it had barely blocked the elephant\u2019s tusks. The Grand Knight\u2019s left arm was bent at a strange angle, the elephant\u2019s attack probably having broken his bone. However, the injury did not stop him from striking the elephant\u2019s stomach with his axe.Harland and the elephant were both struggling. The Glowing Elephant was in deep pain. It raised its head and roared. A translucent green fireball suddenly appeared between its tusks.The fireball was growing bigger and bigger, quickly expanding to the size of a basketball. The elephant swung its head and threw the fireball toward Harland. Harland stayed calm and stepped back immediately after seeing the elephant\u2019s actions. He tried his best to raise the tower shield in the air and hide his whole body behind the shield by leaning toward the right.The fireball hit Harland\u2019s tower shield, and the green flame splashed everywhere. Some of it dropped onto the grass, and a lot of smoke spread into the air.Angele, Tinos, and the two Knights were still surveying the battleground from the top of the hill. The battleground was lighted up by the elephant\u2019s green fireball attack. Although the visibility was still bad, Angele could see the green light dots through the smoke.\u201cMy brother will be fine,\u201d Tinos said with mixed feelings.Angele looked at him but did not say a word.\u2018Zero, did you collect enough data to calculate the elephant\u2019s statuses?\u2019 Angele asked. He was more than five meters away from the elephant, so Zero would not be able to directly obtain the creature\u2019s data. It had to collect relative information and do the analysis.\u2018Estimated Results:Glowing Elephant: Strength larger than 8. Agility larger than 4. Stamina larger than 15. Mentality larger than 7. Talent Skill: Blazing Tusks (Damage Increased), Glowing Strike (By draining energy from the heart, it can make fireballs).\u2019Angele read the information, and he was surprised by how high the elephant\u2019s attributes were. He was also impressed by Harland\u2019s ability to fight. Angele wondered what he could become if he could break his gene limit, however, there was no way for him to do it, and he would never become a Grand Knight.At the moment, Harland was still fighting with the Glowing Elephant, and the other two Knights were supporting him from the sides. They had slashed at the elephant several times with their swords, but most of the time, they were just dodging its attacks.Three soldiers failed to dodge another green fireball thrown by the elephant, and they were burnt to death in seconds. The situation was getting worse.\u201cYou two! Go help them,\u201d Tinos ordered, turning his head back.The two Knights looked at each other, hesitating. \u201cMr. Tinos, our skills are not based on strength, I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t be able to provide any support\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, just distract the elephant,\u201d Tinos said in a serious tone. \u201cJust go.\u201d\u201cRoger that.\u201dThey drew their swords and ran down the hill.Angele noticed the swords in the Knights\u2019 hands were slim and would do no damage to a creature with such high defense. Their Agility was definitely high, so they needed lighter weapons to unleash the full potential of their skills. The order they had received was probably just to protect Tinos.Only Angele and Tinos were standing on the top of the hill after the Knights left.Angele thought Tinos and Harland hated each other when he first time met them, but now Angele realized that they were just expressing their love in a strange way. Tinos admired Harland, and he was sometimes jealous of what Harland could do, but he still wanted to help his brother when Harland was in trouble.Tinos was just childish. He wanted to become stronger and better than his brother one day, but at the same time, he was still relying on Harland a lot. He admired Harland and regarded him as his role model. Tinos always hid his feelings when he was with Harland, and he did not want others to know how he thought about his brother.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the elephant is dying,\u201d Angele said, trying to comfort Tinos.\u201cIs it?\u201d Tinos looked relieved. \u201cWait, I\u2019m not worried about him!\u201d he then yelled after realizing what Angele was implying.Angele did not respond. He just smiled.\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d Tinos stared at Angele. \u201cI can\u2019t let him die because my father will be sad if he\u2019s killed by the Glowing Elephant!\u201d\u201cI know, I know.\u201d Angele nodded, knowing that Tinos was just shy.\u201cYou\u2026 Whatever!\u201d Tinos decided not to explain any further.Angele quietly put his crossguard sword back into the sheath.\u201cThe fight is almost over. The Glowing Elephant is losing a great amount of blood, and it\u2019s dying,\u201d Angele said with a light tone.Tinos immediately looked at the battlefield after hearing Angele\u2019 words.The Glowing Elephant\u2019s attacks were no longer as powerful as before. The loss of blood was making it weaker and weaker. It tried to fight back, but it could no longer hit Harland or the Knights. The elephant tried to use Glowing Strike again but did not have enough power to create the fireball.Angele started to think about the information he had recently collected about Tinos.Tinos\u2019s father was Lord Alford, and his mother was a daughter of a Duke. She left home due to an argument with her parents and got married to Lord Alford, but later she went back to the Duke\u2019s territory. Now, she had great power in the country, and the army was also in her control.Harland once told Angele that his father, Lord Alford, actually feared Tinos\u2019 mother due to various reasons. The woman would do anything to acquire the things she wanted, and she was not satisfied with what she already had. She loved Tinos a lot, but for some reason, she left her son with Alford.Tinos never respected Alford and never cared if the man liked what he was doing. Before Angele had visited them, Tinos had once found out that Alford had affairs with two women in the city and slain them right in front of Harland\u2019s mother. Harland\u2019s mother had never known about Alford\u2019s affairs prior to this. She left her husband and went to live with Harland after what Tinos did, never coming back to Lennon City.Alford begged Harland to stay with him to no avail, and that was the reason why Angele thought the relationship between the father and the sons was strange when he first time visited the castle.*BOOM*The Glowing Elephant fell to the ground.Angele\u2019s expression suddenly changed. He stopped thinking due to the noise he just heard.\u201cWait! Another one! One more Glowing Elephant is coming for us!\u201dHe suddenly turned his head back and saw the crying Glowing Elephant that was charging toward Harland.Tinos did not understand what Angele was talking about. He quickly turned back and looked in the direction Angele was staring at. His face turned pale after seeing the other Glowing Elephant. Harland and the rest of the team had just finished their battle, and they did not expect another one to come for them. They were injured and tired. Although Harland was strong, he would not be able to block the charge from an angry Glowing Elephant at this moment.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Tinos wanted to say something, but he saw Angele quickly running down the hill and disappearing into the bushes. He gritted his teeth, drew his sword, and followed Angele down.********************Angele had no expression on his face. He lowered his body, moving quickly through the bushes.Leaves kept dropping down on Angele\u2019s head, twisting in the air due to Angele\u2019s extreme moving speed. He could sense the danger in front of him and see the giant shadow of the elephant.Angele\u2019s eyes started to shine. He put his hand on the handle of his sword.\u2018Approaching the target\u2026\u2019\u2018Show me the plan.\u2019\u2018Target locked: Glowing Elephant. Analyzing\u2026 Plan confirmed\u2026\u2019\u2018Battle mode: On.\u2019Various types of blue holograms appeared in Angele\u2019s sight, and a lot of information was displayed beside the objects he saw.Angele drew his sword and increased his speed again. He was so fast that his body blurred.He rushed out of the bush and passed the Glowing Elephant. He easily cut open its skin, making it wince in pain.*Trumpet*The Glowing Elephant stopped and roared. Its eyes turned bloody red, and it turned around right away, starting to chase Angele.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82: The Chase (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele kept running, and the elephant kept on following him. Countless trees were knocked by the huge elephant on the way. It tried to throw stones and trees at Angele with its trunk, but Angele easily dodged all the projectiles.He kept running, no longer sure how far he was from his original position.The Glowing Elephant\u2019s wound had begun to heal. There was still some blood coming out of the cut, but it did not impact the elephant\u2019s ability to run.Angele knew the elephant\u2019s Stamina was 15 but still thought its healing ability was impressive. He looked at the edge of his blade while running, noticing that it was already cracked after that one hit he had made.Angele was still using the silver crossguard sword he had obtained from Dice, and he liked it a lot. He felt a bit sad that the blade was cracked by the elephant\u2019s skin.\u2018I have to get a new sword after this, damn.\u2019 Angele shook his head. \u2018But first, let me figure out a way to deal with this creature.\u2019He regretted leaving his poisoned weapons at the shop, but the elephant\u2019s Stamina was over 15, and the venoms he had were not strong enough for it anyways.The elephant\u2019s Stamina was so high that it would be hard for Angele to deal any physical damage to it during a short period of time. He needed to keep attacking it like what Harland had done. The best way would be to open a deep wound on its body while having people to cover for him, but there was no one else around him right now.The elephant trumpeted again and raised its head. A green fireball appeared between its tusks, and it threw the fireball toward Angele. Angele had a serious look on his face. He turned right and rushed behind a large tree.*BAM*The fireball hit the tree and exploded, drops of green flame alighting the grasses around. A basketball-sized hole was left on the body of the tree.\u2018Damn. I guess Stun Spell won\u2019t work on a target with such high Stamina. Let me try the Hand of Exhaustion. At least, it should reduce its speed.\u2019 Angele kept running, he put the sword back into its sheath and clapped his hands. They turned red within seconds.************************At the logging site.Harland hit the elephant\u2019s feet again with his axe, and the axe stuck deep into its skin.*PONG*The elephant hit Harland with its trunk, and he fell onto the ground, not able to handle its force. Harland struggled to stand up. He spat out some blood and quickly looked around. Most of his team were either dead or injured.The two Knights that had retreated with Tinos were now trying to attract the elephant\u2019s attention. The Glowing Elephant had wounds all over its body, and there was blood dripping down its skin. The elephant was about to die, but it was still trying its best to survive.\u201cJack! You go!\u201d Harland yelled.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d The Knight named Jack was injured too, but he could still fight. He tightened his grip on his great sword and rushed towards the elephant.Suddenly, a white-feathered arrow blocked Jack\u2019s way.\u201cWho\u2019s there!\u201dSurprised by the attack, Jack raised his greatsword and looked in the direction that the arrow had come from.The others were alerted by the arrow as well, and they started to check the surroundings.Harland dropped his broken tower shield on the ground and grabbed the axe with his right hand. \u201cI knew it. Two Glowing Elephants won\u2019t randomly appear around Lennon City!\u201d he yelled. \u201cReveal yourselves!\u201dHarland heard the noise made by the armor pieces right away, and three men slowly walked out of the bush. Two of them were fully armored warriors: one bald and the other with short brown hair. He was also tall and strong. The man following the two was wearing a leather armor suit with a black robe over it, and his hair was silver. It was not a common sight to see people with silver hair around Lennon City.\u201cHarland, long time no see, haha.\u201d The bald man laughed.\u201cI and my brother missed you.\u201d The man with the short brown hair was also laughing.\u201cVince brothers, you guys really can\u2019t give up Vader City, huh? Where is Kaiser? Why didn\u2019t he come here?\u201d Harland laughed emotionlessly. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had the ability to control the Glowing Elephants. I guess a man with the mysterious power is helping you?\u201dHarland was talking to the two warriors, but he was looking at the man with silver hair.\u201cYou are right.\u201d The man with silver hair smiled. \u201cVader City did me a huge favor during a recent event, and I am here to pay it back. I thought I lured two Glowing Elephants here, where is the other one? Someone else drew it away?\u201d\u2018I guess he is the one with the mysterious power.\u2019Harland stayed on guard. People with mysterious power used different ways to fight, and he was not sure what skills the man in front of him had. He was not scared, but he sensed something different from the man with silver hair.Harland kept staring the man, knowing that the man was dangerous just by looking at him. There was a strange aura around him.\u201cYou are not a Wizard yet,\u201d Harland said.\u201cSo what?\u201d the man with silver hair said.\u201cYou really think I can\u2019t deal with two Knights and an apprentice?\u201d Harland smiled.\u201cOf course not. But you are injured now. Although you are a Grand Knight, you\u2019re no threat to me if you can barely use your left arm.\u201d The man with silver hair nodded. \u201cI\u2019m just here for the Glowing Elephants\u2019 hearts, and I don\u2019t care about you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re using us to kill the elephants for you?\u201d Tinos stepped forward and asked in anger.\u201cBingo, ha,\u201d the man mocked him. \u201cSadly, the other one is gone, otherwise I could have gotten two hearts.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Tinos was trying to hold his anger.\u201cGood job, you guys can leave now,\u201d the man said in a calm voice and smiled. \u201cWe will gratefully clean up the mess for you.\u201dHarland narrowed his eyes and stared at the man. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d he yelled out.The two Knights that were still fighting with the elephant backed off, and the soldiers that had survived the fight looked disappointed, but they all knew that the best choice they had at the moment was to leave.\u3002The badly wounded elephant just stood there, unmoving; it was not trying to attack anymore. The elephant started to back off, it looked weak and was probably trying to escape.Harland suddenly stopped after giving the order. It seemed like the arrow had reminded him of something, and he stared at the man with silver hair with hatred in his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d Harland said.\u201cYea, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s about time you recognized the arrow I shot,\u201d the man said. \u201cAlso, I killed several mice in the forest on my way here. I\u2019m not sure if they were your pets, but I will apologize anyways.\u201d\u201cI respect your power,\u201d Harland said with a deep tone. \u201cThat\u2019s why my Crossbow Soldiers did not show up. 15 Crossbow Soldiers...\u201dHarland gritted his teeth. Only post-Knights could meet the requirements of becoming Crossbow Soldiers. They needed to be strong and practice both crossbow and stealth skills, too. He spent a long-time training each one of them, so he did not expect for them to be killed so easily. The large loss of his elite soldiers in this mission made him feel sad.\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan, brother?\u201d Tinos asked in a light tone.\u201cLet\u2019s wait for Master Angele to come back,\u201d Harland replied. They paid a great price to deal with the Glowing Elephant, and he would not let it go so easily.He knew the heart of the elephant had some special value to the Wizards and that every part of the elephant could be sold for a good amount of gold coins in the market. The skin of the elephant was used to make top-class leather armor pieces, while its meat was very nutritious and its tusks were almost priceless.The Glowing Elephant could easily be sold for more than ten million gold coins.*********************In an area not so far from the logging site.The sunlight was blocked by the leaves, and the shadows on the ground were dancing when the wind passed by.A tall and strong man with a beard slowly walked out of the shadow. He was wearing a black chest piece, and he had two silver great swords on his back.The man checked the surroundings and took out a white shell out of his pouch. He opened the shell, and there was one white lively string twisting in the water. Its head always pointed in one direction, no matter how the man rotated the shell.\u201cThat\u2019s it. It\u2019s Harland from Lennon City,\u201d the man said as he closed the shell and put it back into his pouch.The man drew out his two swords and ran in the direction the string in the shell had pointed at; it was the location of Harland and his soldiers. He disappeared in the forest after several seconds.*********************Harland had a serious look on his face. He knew that if he wanted to escape the three would not be able to stop him, but it looked like they were waiting for their reinforcements to arrive as well.\u2018Who\u2019s coming? We\u2019re right outside Lennon City, but it seems like they don\u2019t even care.\u2019 One man\u2019s name appeared in Harland\u2019s mind. \u2018It can\u2019t be.\u2019He knew there was a Grand Knight in Vader City. Lennon City and Vader City were two of the largest cities in the province, and Harland was the Grand Knight of Lennon. The other Grand Knight was named Campbell. He was the Grand Knight of Vader, and he wielded two great swords.\u2018I hope it\u2019s not him\u2026\u2019 Harland was not sure if he was making the right decision, but he just did not want to hand over the elephant to the three.The soldiers stopped after they realized Harland was not moving. They did not really care about the injured elephant because they knew it would not go too far with all these wounds, and they could easily track it down after the problem was dealt with.**********************Huff*Angele took a deep breath. He stood between the trees and looked at the Glowing Elephant that was trapped in the soft mud by the river.\u2018It\u2019ll need more than a minute to get out of the mud. The Hand of Exhaustion had actually worked, I could probably kill it by myself if I had the time. Damn.\u2019The Glowing Elephant was still trumpeting. Although it was still dragging a large tree with its trunk, it was slowly getting out of the mud.Angele gave it one last look and started to head back the way he had come.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: The Chase (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeZero had sensed people hiding in the shadows when Angele had run down to lure the elephant away. The people hiding behind the bushes probably did not think Angele would notice them, but they did not know Angele had a chip that could record anything it detected.\u2018I need to go back. There is no way two Glowing Elephants just randomly appeared outside the city. Also, those people in the bushes\u2026 Maybe they\u2019re after Harland.\u2019 Angel\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. \u2018According to the data, Glowing Elephants are intelligent enough to make decisions, and they are cunning, but the two I saw here were different. Their eyes were red, and they had no reason to fight to their last breath. Maybe someone casted Bloodlust on them.\u2019Bloodlust was one of the basic water type spells. It was a level zero spell that had a similar effect to the Berserk Potion, but its effect was a bit weaker than the potion\u2019s. Bloodlust would only make the creatures lose their mind, without boosting their attributes. The Bloodlust model was displayed in the school as well, but Angele did not buy it; he only recorded the free data he had access to.Angele stopped thinking and increased his speed. He was sure something went wrong.************************The logging site.The last rays of sunlight made everything on the ground look red and shiny. With the white mist in the forest, the area was dreamy.\u201cWhy are you still here?\u201d the man with silver hair yelled out. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m not sure if I can kill you, you won\u2019t stop us from taking the elephant. Also, I think you already know who\u2019s coming.\u201d\u201cCampbell, right? The man that dual wields swords,\u201d Harland said in a deep voice. It seemed like he was still having trouble with his left arm.\u201cYour left arm was not fractured. Why are you faking it?\u201d The man looked at Harland\u2019s left arm.\u201cWell\u201d\u2014Harland straightened his back and stretched his arms\u2014 \u201cI was planning to lure you out, but I guess I\u2019m bad at acting.\u201d He smiled.\u201cOne on one, Campbell will lose. However, what about you versus me and Campbell?\u201d The man chuckled.\u201cI will lose for sure,\u201d Harland answered without hesitation.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Harland waved his hands. \u201cI will retreat today. However, make sure you stay alert on your way back. The deep forest is probably more dangerous than you think\u2026\u201d\u201cWe will see.\u201d The man smiled and stepped on Harland\u2019s broken tower shield.\u201cYou will regret this\u2026\u201d Tinos stared at the three in anger. The soldiers behind him helped each other to stand up before starting to walk towards their horses.Harland fell back with his axe in hand, still staring at the man\u2019s hands. He had fought with the people that could use the mysterious power before and knew that they could cast strange spells just with incantations or hand gestures.Harland kept moving back until he reached a large tree. A silver greatsword suddenly appeared behind his head, but for some reason, Harland did not notice it at all.*Clank*A crossguard sword appeared before the man who was trying to slash Harland, but the man blocked the attack with another great sword in his other hand.The two men dropped down from the trees and stepped back.\u201cCampbell!\u201d Harland broke out in cold sweat. He hadn\u2019t noticed the stealth attack at all.\u201cHow is that even possible? Did you cast some stealth spell on him?\u201d Harland was staring at Campbell, but he was talking to the man with silver hair.The man who tried to attack Harland was wielding two silver great swords. He was rubbing the back of his neck where there was a short line of blood dripping down. Angele was standing opposite the man with a thick beard, holding his sword and looking calm.\u201cYou\u2019re fast. You can use mysterious power too?\u201d Campbell laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why Harland hasn\u2019t given up yet, right?\u201dThe soldiers hadn\u2019t noticed Campbell until he traded attacks with Angele. They were surprised by how fast and accurate Campbell\u2019s attack was. Tinos\u2019 face turned pale, and he held the sword in his hand tight, his eyes filled up with fear.\u201cYou really think there is nothing I can do?\u201d Harland asked. He raised his axe and charged towards Campbell. His footsteps were heavy, and the ground was almost shaking.Campbell jumped and backflipped to a tree behind. \u201cHarland, long time no see. That\u2019s how you welcome an old friend?\u201d*Clink*He swung his swords and sliced two daggers that were coming toward him into pieces.Angele lowered his arms, and there was a serious look on his face, \u201cImpressive.\u201dHe drew his crossguard sword and stepped forward, but his way was blocked by the man with silver hair.\u201cYou\u2019re an apprentice too, huh? I will be your opponent.\u201dThe soldiers were still trying to figure out what was going on when the Vinci Brothers had already blocked them from moving toward Harland. Thus, the battlefield was divided into three parts: Harland against Campbell, Angele against the man with silver hair, and the rest of Harland\u2019s team against the Vinci Brothers.The man with silver hair smiled. \u201cThis place is too narrow for us, follow me.\u201dHe turned around and rushed into the deep forest in seconds.Angele followed after the man, controlling his speed to keep a distance from his opponent, and they both disappeared in the mist.***********************On one of the main roads outside Lennon City.The carriage lane was made from gray mud. Three black carriages were stopped by the bandits, and about ten guards of the carriage team were fighting them.There were people screaming and yelling everywhere around the carriages.A bandit laughed and stabbed into one of the guards\u2019 chests, the blade easily penetrating the white leather chest piece, and blood spurted out of the wound once the bandit pulled his blade out.All the bandits were wearing white masks and gray scarfs. Their faces were covered very well.Inside one of the carriages, Avril\u2019s mother embraced Avril in her arms while they peeked outside through the window. Avril\u2019s father held his commander sword in hand and was finishing off the bandits that had broken their defense formation. It seemed that her father knew how to fight, and he looked wild with the blood stains on his clothes.\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know who you are? Damn Terrio\u2019s puppies! I will not give up my life here, and you will never take my territory from me!\u201d Avril\u2019s father was yelling in anger.Avril hugged her mother tighter after hearing her father\u2019s words.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here for you so no one will hurt you,\u201d Avril\u2019s mother whispered, but Avril could barely understand what she was saying.\u201cMom, dad will win, right?\u201d she asked in a light tone.\u201cYea\u2026 He will, your father is the strongest man in the world,\u201d her mother responded.Suddenly, someone groaned outside the carriage.The man with the commander sword in hand was staring at another man in front him, and his eyes were filled with surprise. There was a dagger protruding from his stomach, and the blood coming out of the wound was dripping down to the ground.\u201cWhy\u2026 Dunleavy\u2026 Why did you\u2026\u201d the man asked in pain, but there was no expression on Dunleavy\u2019s face.\u201cDon\u2019t blame me,\u201d Dunleavy answered in a deep voice.\u201cAvril, stay here!\u201d The lady had a strange expression on her face as she released her daughter from her arms. \u201cOnce you find the chance, run, and\u2026 you will be alright!\u201dThe lady patted the girl\u2019s head and pushed her away. She stood up, grabbing the silver sword lying by her side, opened the door and jumped off the carriage.Avril stayed in the carriage alone, crouching down since she did not know what else to do. She was the only one left in the carriage, her parents gone.Avril was in shock. She could hear people screaming outside while the bandits were approaching her carriage.\u201cMother\u2026\u201d Avril was holding her knees on the floor, and a flood of tears gushed down her cheeks.\u201cRun\u2026 Mother told me to run\u2026\u201d She suddenly realized what she should do and quickly opened a hidden exit on the floor. There was mud down there.********************Angele and the man with silver hair were already several kilometers away from Harland and the others. They were so quick that the objects around them looked like slideshows.Suddenly, they both heard some people fighting.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe man with silver hair hesitated for a second. He then quickly changed his direction and ran toward the source of the noise.Through the gap between trees, he could see several carriages being attacked by a group bandits with gray scarfs. The man with silver hair was trying to say something before approaching the carriages, but his expression suddenly changed, and he blocked Angele\u2019s slash with something black in his hands.*Dang*Angele\u2019s strike hit the man hard, but he floated in the air almost like a feather and flew through the carriages into the other side of the forest. It was almost like he had blocked the attack and used Angele\u2019s force to retreat.Angele walked out of the forest slowly and swung his sword towards the road.\u201cLet\u2019s do it here.\u201dHe was calm, and there were green dots floating around him. He looked ghastly and bloodcurdling with the glowing green light.\u201cI don\u2019t really care.\u201dThe man with silver hair smiled. He walked out of the bush and raised his right hand. There was blue lightning sparking around his palm.The carriages and bandits were right between Angele and the man with silver hair. Both parties stopped fighting after the two appeared.\u201cWizards\u2026\u201d someone said in a shaky voice.The place suddenly became silent, and everyone was dazed.Some of them started to tremble.Avril was under one of the carriages, looking for a chance to escape. She knew something had happened, and then saw Angele walk out of the forest.Angele looked at the carriages and scrunched his eyebrows. He knew those carriages.\u201cAvril\u2019s carriage.\u201dHe narrowed his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84: Intense Battle (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u2018Why is Avril here?\u2019 Angele wondered. It seemed like her carriage was being attacked by the bandits.Avril had saved him once, and Angele had not yet found a chance to repay it. So since she was in trouble, he would try his best to help her.Angele stopped thinking and instead returned his stare to the man with silver hair while dragging the green dots toward himself.He was releasing the Wind energy particles into the air so they would help him act faster. Although using the particles was not as effective as casting Agility Burst, they could still provide him with a decent buff while increasing his magic resistance. It was one the advantage of being a rank 3 apprentice. Rank 2 apprentices would never be able to control the particles so accurately due to the limitations of their Mentality.The man with silver hair clasped his hands, and a large electric arc appeared between his palms. The noise made by the lightning sparking was loud, and its arc made everything around look blue.\u201cDie!\u201dThe man with silver hair chuckled and released the thick electric arc from his hands. It jumped toward Angele\u2019s head like a blue flash within a second.Angele\u2019s expression changed, but he quickly reacted to the attack by swinging his sword toward the incoming electric arc, and the electricity was absorbed by the blade. Angele\u2019s sword turned blue, and he could still see tiny lightning sparks flickering around the blade.Angele could barely hold the handle of his sword\u2014it was blazing hot\u2014and his right hand was almost burning. He quickly gathered the green particles towards his sword, and the Wind energy particles weakened the Lightning particles around the sword.If the man\u2019s electric arc had hit a normal person, they would have been paralyzed and burnt to ashes.Angele quickly thrust his sword into the ground, and the rest of the electricity disappeared in seconds. White smoke was coming out of Angele\u2019s body. He was injured by the heat from the electricity, and his clothes were burning.\u2018Thank god the electricity was from the Lightning particles, which is slow. If it was a real lightning strike, I\u2019d be dead already.\u2019 Angele thought he was lucky, and he began to pay more attention to the man on the opposite side of the road.Zero was not fast enough to calculate a plan for Angele when the man had released the electric arc, and he had to deal with the attack by himself. The chip was useless in fights between Wizards since the spells were way too fast for it to collect necessary data and figure out a counter.After Angele dealt with the electricity, he charged toward the man with silver hair with a raised hand. A white flash appeared in the air and flew towards the man\u2019s chest.The man with silver hair had seemed to know the lightning spell would not work on Angele and had lowered his head to start another incantation.Angele could see the man waving his hand in the air, and there were blue runes appearing around it. He had to be preparing to cast some powerful spell.The man was not concerned about the daggers flying toward him. He moved one step to the left and dodged them easily, still preparing for the next spell.Suddenly, the man raised his hands in the air and a pentagram magic circle slowly appeared under his feet. Its dazzling blue light almost blinded Angele.He then pointed at Angele, and a finger-sized blue laser was generated by the magic circle which then shot toward Angele. The Lightning particles were gathered together and became a laser. There were also unstable tiny lightning sparks around it. The laser could easily paralyze and penetrate anything on its way.The laser was about six meters long, and it looked like a blue spear. The blue spear was slowly traveling through the air, but it seemed like the man was still channeling the spell so the laser would not disappear after landing on the target.The man with silver hair was enjoying the fight. The magic circle was specially designed for him by his master. Besides creating lasers, it could also help the man block incoming projectiles. His skill level was very close to a formal Wizard\u2019s with the defensive enchanted item he was using.Most bandits had already fled due to the fear of the Wizards, but some unlucky ones were still penetrated by the laser. They fell to the ground, paralyzed.Knight Dunleavy took a last glance at the carriages before escaping, but someone on the ground grabbed his ankle and stopped him from leaving. It was Avril\u2019s father. There was blood all over his face, and it made his smile scary.*CHI*Dunleavy was hit by the lightning sparking from the laser, and he was paralyzed by it.Angele passed by him while charging toward the man with silver hair, and he cut Dunleavy\u2019s throat open. A line of blood spurted out of Dunleavy\u2019s neck. He stood there for several seconds, then fell to the ground. There he trembled for several seconds and died before realizing what had actually happened.Angele threw a green potion to Avril\u2019s mother after cutting Dunleavy\u2019s throat open.\u201cApply the potion to his wound. It will stop the bleeding,\u201d Angele ordered in passing. He was still charging toward the man with silver hair.Avril\u2019s mother held her left arm tight and rushed towards the carriage after seeing what Angele just did. She helped her daughter that was hiding beneath the carriage to get out and wiped the dust off Avril\u2019s clothes.\u201cMother\u2026 What about dad? We need to help him!\u201d Avril was almost yelling, her face still covered with tears.Avril\u2019s mother picked up the green potion with gritted her teeth. \u201cYour father will be fine,\u201d she said, then quickly pulled the stopper off the potion.After another lightning bolt struck the bushes, Angele and the man with silver hair disappeared into the forest once again. The blue light was getting farther and farther. It seemed like one of them was chasing the other.\u201cDamn! Not this again!\u201dAngele missed another slash, and he was getting nervous. The man with silver hair kept dodging his attacks with ease while chuckling all the time. The magic circle moved when he moved, and it buffed his speed as well.After missing the hit, Angele rolled to the left right away and dodged the incoming laser attack. Everything where he had been standing just a moment ago got burnt to ashes in seconds.\u2018Such power\u2026\u2019Cold sweat poured down Angele\u2019s back. He was certain he\u2019d be dead if he had gotten hit by the laser.He could dodge the lasers because they were slow, but the tiny electric pulse around the laser was still a problem.Angele bent down and kept moving, but the lasers easily located him every time he changed locations. There were burn marks everywhere in the bushes now.Angele tried his best to dodge everything, but he was still hit by the pulse and became paralyzed for a second.*RIZZZ*His right arm was hit by the laser and got burnt due to the extremely high temperature. The pain made Angele even more nervous.\u2018He\u2019s a rank 3 apprentice too, but he is much stronger than me. If only I had access to more spell models\u2026\u201dAngele dodged another blue electric arc and finally got closer to the man with silver hair.He jumped toward the man and aimed at the man\u2019s neck with his sword.Again, Angele\u2019s attack missed, and he hit a tree on the side, slicing off several pieces of wood.The man with silver hair smiled and pointed at Angele. An electric arc burst from the tip of his finger and hit Angele\u2019s chest.Although the arc was much weaker than the laser, it still left a burn mark on his chest. Cold sweat was still running down his back, and his actions were becoming slower due to the pain.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you understand? You can\u2019t even touch me since I only use ranged spells. I can crush you like an insect if you can\u2019t get close to me,\u201d the man said in a light tone, sounding both contemptuous and arrogant.Angele\u2019s expression did not change. He kept attacking the man with his sword skills, even if he was yet to land a single hit.*RIZZZ*Angele\u2019s left arm was hit by the electric arc again.\u201cDo you even know how to cast spells? You\u2019re just like an average warrior with your weak physical skills. If you focused on close combat spells, you should at least learn to deal with ranged spells. Pathetic,\u201d the man with silver hair started to mock Angele. \u201cHow long can you hide? Your endurance is good, almost like a Knight\u2019s, but it won\u2019t help you.\u201d*HUFF*Angele was breathing hard.The man had paused his attacks to talk, and Angele finally had time to recover a bit. He threw the last dagger he had with his left hand, aiming right at the face of the man with silver hair.\u201cThat\u2019s all you got?\u201d the man with silver hair taunted and raised his hands again. Countless electric arcs appeared in the air, and they all started to rotate around him. The dagger was slowed down and eventually stopped by the electricity after entering the magic circle.The dagger had still slowed the man for a second, and Angele used that moment to jump at the man again. He started to strike the man from different angles with his sword skills. Although the man was still dodged most of Angele\u2019s slashes, he had managed to hit him several times, and there was blood spurting out of his wounds.After losing some blood, the man\u2019s face turned pale, and the lightning pulse generated by the magic circles became less and less. It seemed like the man did not have enough Mentality and Mana to keep the magic circle up.*BAM*The man suddenly got knocked back, and he dropped to the ground after hitting a tree. He coughed up some blood and kneeled on the ground.The mist that was floating around Angele disappeared. He had done everything he could but still failed to kill the opponent.He was uncertain if the man had really lost his ability to fight and could no longer make another electric arc. Even though it seemed like he was badly injured after taking all the hits, Angele still decided not to take a step closer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: Intense Battle (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe man with silver hair pointed his finger at Angele again, a blue electric laser appearing at the tip of his finger, and was about to unleash it towards him. Suddenly, a crossguard sword hit the laser and stabbed into the ground beside the man. The rest of the electric pulse spread into the ground, and there were energy particles leaking everywhere. The sounds made by the sparks were extremely loud and intense.Soon, the magic circle under the man collapsed.The man\u2019s expression changed. He just now noticed that Angele was only several meters away from him.Angele\u2019s hands were bloody red as if their skin was peeled off. Green dots of light around his feet were protecting him from the electric pulses.\u201cYou think you can\u2026\u201d The man did not finish his words, a wave of dizziness washing over him. \u201cIt\u2019s the Stun Spell!\u201dThe man tried to leap away, but it was too late.Angele was extremely calm at the moment. The closer he was to victory, the more careful he needed to be. He wanted to make sure he did not mess this up.There was a black dagger in his right hand, his father\u2019s gift. It was the first time he was going to put it to use.He held his dagger tight and leaned forward.\u201cAh!\u201d He groaned.\u201cYou thought I didn\u2019t know what you were going to do? You thought I didn\u2019t know metals were conductive?\u201d The man leaped away and landed on his feet. He stared at Angele and sneered.Countless tiny electric arcs were climbing up Angele\u2019s body like insects. There were many green and red light dots coming out of Angele\u2019s body, protecting him from getting hurt by the blue electric arcs. But Angele was not feeling well. He was paralyzed.\u201cHowever, it\u2019s quite impressive that you broke my magic circle.\u201d The man stopped smiling. \u201cI mean, for a rat like you, it\u2019s truly impressive. I was planning to finish you off quickly and grab the parts I needed from the elephant, but oh well. I will become a Wizard after I return to my school so I\u2019m happy that I found you. I gained some practical experience.\u201dThe man raised his hand again, and another blue electric arc flew toward Angele.He rolled to the right, but he was too slow to dodge the attack, and the electric arc hit his shoulders. He trembled and barely able to stand still.\u201cNow who\u2019s laughing?\u201d The man sneered. \u201cCome at me.\u201dAngele charged toward him after pulling his crossguard sword out of the ground.The man applied a speed buff on himself and leaped back, easily dodging Angele\u2019s attack. He waved his hand and hit Angele with another electric arc, but without the help of the magic circle, the electricity didn\u2019t deal as much damage as before.\u201cYou\u2019re a coward,\u201d Angele suddenly said.He stared at the man, holding his sword tight. There were still electric pulses moving around his body. Many burns marked his skin, and Zero kept warning him about how badly wounded he was. He would die if he kept getting hit by the electric arcs.\u201cDumbass! I\u2019m not good at close combat.\u201d The man knew Angele was taunting him. \u201cIt won\u2019t work. You should tell me your last wish. I can make it come true if I\u2019ll feel like it, hahahahah.\u201dAngele had no expression on his face. He charged toward the man again and threw his dagger at the man\u2019s chest. The dagger was thrown with his full strength, and it drew a black line in the air.\u201cI told you it won\u2019t work!\u201dOnce more the man blocked Angele\u2019s attack with the black thing he had used earlier. The dagger hit the thing and dropped to the ground.A black chain flew towards the man and bounded him. He hadn\u2019t known Angele had so many different weapons. Having failed to dodge the chain, he looked surprised.However, the man smiled and chopped the chain to pieces with the black blinking thing.\u201cThat\u2019s all you got?\u201dThe man chuckled and dodged Angele\u2019s front slash again.\u201cDamn!\u201d The man was really getting on Angele\u2019s nerves. \u201cYou little monkey!\u201d\u201cRetard!\u201dThe man with silver hair started to use incantations again, but he looked tired. A fist-sized blue electric ball appeared beside him. There were many electric arcs in the ball as it floated in the air.\u201cWait! You\u2019re from Manchester School too, right?\u201d Angele asked, calming down.\u201cHuh?\u201d The man hesitated, confused. \u201cYou are an apprentice from Manchester?\u201d He wondered why Angele suddenly brought this up, but he had rules to follow. \u201cShow me your sigil.\u201dManchester School was a strong Wizard organization, and fights between rank 3 apprentices were against the rule there. The punishment for rule violations was very hard, and the man did not want to risk it.Angele smiled.\u2018Warning! Warning! Your heart rate is way too high, and your bioelectricity is being interfered with. If you take another electric attack in the next hour, your heart will stop!\u2019 Zero reported.\u201cI didn\u2019t know we\u2019re from the same school. There must be some misunderstanding between us.\u201dAngele kept smiling.\u201cShow me your sigil,\u201d the man said in a deep voice. \u201cIf you\u2019re lying, I\u2019ll kill all your relatives, and I have my own ways to find them.\u201dAngele nodded and slowly walked toward the man. He put his right hand into the pouch on the back of his waist. It looked like he was trying to take something out of it.One more electric arc and Angele would be dead. However, he was not scared for some reason, rather he was even getting excited. Angele felt like he was in a trance at that moment. The pain from the wounds, the numbness from the electric attacks, and the chilling wind blowing in the forest - all of them made him feel like everything was so real. He could actually sense his presence in this world.Angele knew that he was not a normal man that lived on Earth anymore, and he needed to do whatever he could to survive in this new world.He suddenly realized something, and the objects around him became vivid. The memories of the earth became a slideshow in front of his eyes.Angele was still smiling, and he looked relaxed. It seemed like the man with silver hair believed what he just said after seeing his natural smile and canceled the spell he was going to cast. He thought a lying man would never show a smile like that.\u201cShow me your sigil. Why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier that you were from Manchester?\u201dThe man looked relieved.Angele looked at him with a strange expression on his face as black smoke kept coming from his body.\u201cI guess you don\u2019t have a lot of mana left?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe man\u2019s expression changed. He had been trying to say something when he saw Angele charging toward him, ready to cut his throat with the silver crossguard sword.\u201cHow dare you!\u201d he yelled out and quickly leaped backward. Again, an electric ball appeared on his right hand, but his face turned pale. He had just wasted most of his mana and mentality on the previous spell he had cast and had barely any mana left.Angele\u2019s assumption was right\u2014the man was out of mana. He drew the electricity toward his sword and threw it toward the man. His opponent leaned left, trying his best to avoid the sword, but it still hit his right shoulder, and the electricity on the sword paralyzed him for several seconds.\u201cThe black enchanted item you were using probably reached its limit for the day too.\u201dAngele smiled and walked toward the man.The man\u2019s face turned serious. He pulled the crossguard sword out of his shoulder and dropped it to the ground. The heat from the electric pulses burnt his wound and stopped it from bleeding.\u201cYou\u2019re smart. I don\u2019t even know why I trusted you for a second. I don\u2019t have much mana left, but your wounds are severe. You still think you can win?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Angele charged forward and picked up the crossguard sword from the ground. The blade became blurry as Angele rushed aiming at multiple weak points on the man\u2019s body.The gloomy electric ball exploded, and the man groaned as he stepped back. His stomach was almost penetrated by Angele\u2019s sword. He held the wound with his hands, but there was blood leaking out through the gaps between his fingers.Angele swung his sword and the electric pulses dropped to the ground. The black smoke was protecting him from taking any lightning damage, and it was formed by the last negative energy particles in his body. The stored wind and fire energy particles were all gone so the negative energy particles were all he had left, but they would not last long. Zero told him that he had about ten seconds before all the negative energy particles would be consumed.\u201cFool! Didn\u2019t your master tell you, once you use up all your mana, you can easily be killed by a close combat spell user?\u201dAngele was slowly approaching the man, trying to make sure that his opponent did not have another enchanted item or special spell prepared. It was a cautious advance.The fights between Wizards were all about the stability of their minds. If a Wizard could easily be disturbed by the words his opponent was saying, he would not be able to form any spell models. If that happened, no matter how high his Mentality was, he would not be able to cast any spells.Angele and the man with silver hair tried to test each other\u2019s stability of mind by cursing or saying weird things, but it seemed like both of their minds were stable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86: Standoff (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele was standing several meters away from the man, and the man was lying on the ground. Both of them stopped moving and just stared at each other.\u201cArrogant rat!\u201d Angele sneered. \u201cYou said you were going to kill all my relatives? What happened? Why are you lying on the floor like a dog? Are you trying to beg for your life?\u201d\u201cKill me if you can.\u201d The man\u2019s expression did not change. He remained calm. \u201cA punk like you will be able to hurt me? Come, come at me!\u201dAngele threw his crossguard sword toward the man, aiming for his chest, but the man leaned to the left, and the sword pinned his right hand to the ground. The grass around his hand became soaked in blood.\u201cYou\u2019re provoking me.\u201d Angele narrowed his eyes. \u201cI will skin you alive and sink your body into a cesspit filled with maggots.\u201d\u201cYou can try,\u201d the man said in a light tone.He was losing a lot of blood, and his face had turned pale, but Angele could see the determination in his eyes. The man was staring at Angele like a hawk. He then pulled the crossguard sword out of the ground, quickly took out a green potion from his pouch, and carefully applied the liquid on the wound. It stopped bleeding right after some liquid reached it.Angele just stood there and watched, still paralyzed by the electric pulse after all the negative energy particles were gone.The man was weak as well, lying quietly on the ground after patching up his wound.Time went by, but the two did not move. One was standing, and the other still lying on the ground.\u201cMonkey, how do you feel? You are weak. You lost a lot of blood and don\u2019t have any mana left. I guess your head is aching too,\u201d Angele gloated.\u201cYou\u2019re paralyzed, and your body is being corroded by the negative energy particles. It surprises me that you can still talk.\u201dThe man didn\u2019t really care about what Angele had just said.\u201cWell, neither of us can move now anyways,\u201d Angele said.\u201cDumbass!\u201dThe man rolled his eyes.\u201cRetard!\u201dThe two were arguing like kids.Time flew, and it was getting dark. Strange noises were coming from the forest, and there were birds twittering. Groups of shiny white mushrooms were growing under the trees, making the forest bright.\u201cIf I wasn\u2019t paralyzed\u2026\u201dAngele stared at the man.\u201cIf I did not fall for your lie and finished casting my spell\u2026\u201d the man on the ground said in a deep voice.\u201cYou..!\u201dAngele was a bit mad. It was the first time he had met someone that was so tenacious.\u201cCome and get me!\u201d the man said in a chilling tone. \u201cWhy did you even use the negative energy particles to increase your magic resistance, you\u2019re lucky you survived the black smoke.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t lose your mind after overdrawing your mentality to cast that last spell.\u201dAngele didn\u2019t want to lose this war of words.Time was still passing, but the two were not recovering. They were still very weak and did not have the strength to fight at the moment.\u201cI\u2019ve killed more than eight rank 3 apprentices, and you are the very first one that survived my attacks,\u201d the man suddenly said.\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you just let me finish you off then? I really don\u2019t want to waste any more time.\u201dAngele looked at the man.They stopped talking again, both of them trying their best to recover.Two hours later, the two finally calmed down a bit.The man with silver hair hesitated for a second, then asked, \u201cHey, I just realized I don\u2019t even know your name. I don\u2019t want to admit it, but you\u2019re a worthy opponent, and after I\u2019ve slain you, I will make sure to write down your name in my book.\u201d\u201cI will live longer than you, so you should tell me your name first before asking for mine.\u201d\u201cYou punk\u2026\u201d The man shook his head. \u201cMy name is Benedict, and I guess you already know I main lightning spells. Where are you from? You\u2019re pretty good.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Angele, and I main Necromancy,\u201d Angele said in a light tone.\u201cNecromancy\u2026 and you\u2019re using Wind energy particles?\u201d Benedict was a bit speechless. \u201cWell\u2026 Maybe you\u2019re talented, but don\u2019t tell me you only know two spells. I didn\u2019t see you use any other spell besides those two close combat ones.\u201d\u201cReally\u2026 What a freak!\u201d Benedict did not know what else to say.\u201c\u2026\u201d Angele didn\u2019t know how to respond, either.Benedict\u2019s headache got even worse. He looked at Angele curiously.\u201cHey! Angele, are you from the Ramsoda School?\u201d\u201cYou know Ramsoda?\u201d Angele nodded. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect an apprentice from Manchester to appear in the Ramsoda Empire.\u201d\u201cI came from the docks, and I was planning to head back to school after taking the hearts of the elephants, but I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d encounter a freak like you.\u201d Benedict sighed and inhaled. \u201cYou know what, since we both can\u2019t move, what if the bandits or beasts come by here? They can finish us off easily, and two future Wizards will die. Two rank 3 apprentices killed by bandits in a forest. It will become the biggest news among the organizations this year.\u201dAngele did not say anything.After several seconds, his expression suddenly changed.\u201cF*ck\u2026 You jinx!\u201d He was almost yelling.\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Benedict heard someone\u2019s footsteps approaching as well, and he had a bitter smile on his face.\u201cHey, are you still paralyzed?\u201d Benedict asked in a light tone.\u201cYea. Totally paralyzed. What now?\u201dAngele stared at him.\u201cWell, my head is still aching, and I can\u2019t do sh*t right now. However, I\u2019d rather die with honor!\u201d Benedict\u2019s expression turned serious, and he slowly took a yellow scroll out of his pouch.\u201cA real spell scroll\u2026\u201d Angele gasped. \u201cSince it\u2019s on a scroll, it must at least be a level 1 spell. Why didn\u2019t you use it earlier?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll die for sure If I use it,\u201d Benedict answered. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most mentality-hungry level 1 spells, and right now I don\u2019t have enough mentality to open the scroll and cast it. I can only release it, and we will all become its targets.\u201dAngele was speechless.\u201cWait, you could probably survive with your magic resistance. If you survived it, can you do me a favor?\u201d Benedict asked.\u201cSay it.\u201d\u201cTell Princess Lydia of Santiago not to wait for me to come back.\u201d\u201cI will do it if I survive.\u201d Angele was not mad anymore. He felt pity instead that a strong apprentice will end his life like this. \u201cBut if I die too, we will become a joke for other apprentices.\u201d\u201cSadly, I really want to come back to my hometown and watch the stars.\u201d Benedict looked a bit sad and lonely while putting his hands on the scroll.\u201cWait, wait. It seems like your dream will come true,\u201d Angele hurried to say, stopping him from releasing the spell. \u201cWe\u2019re lucky, they aren\u2019t bandits. They were just passing by and didn\u2019t notice us.\u201dAfter several minutes, they could no longer hear the footsteps anymore.\u201cAlright\u2026 It\u2019s awkward,\u201d Benedict said. \u201cYou know what, we should probably let this go and stop fighting.\u201d\u201cRetarded lightning monkey, you think I will fall for this?\u201d Angele sneered. \u201cIf I knew more spells, you would be dead in seconds. You even thought I was really from Manchester. How naive are you?\u201dBenedict started to blush. \u201cYou damn dumbass, you\u2019re a rank 3 apprentice and you only know two spells, are you kidding me?\u201d He got nervous and did not find anything else to say.\u201cAre you praising me?\u201d Angele smiled. \u201cOr do you admit that you\u2019re retarded? I know only two spells and I almost killed you.\u201d\u201cYou..!\u201d Benedict was mad but it was true that he had almost lost to an apprentice that only knew two spells. He had also canceled an important spell because he\u2019d believed Angele\u2019s words.They argued for several hours, and it was already midnight.The two suddenly stopped talking at the same time.Benedict spoke up again. \u201cActually\u2026 I like you.\u201d\u201cWell, you\u2019re not that retarded I guess.\u201dAngele smiled.They both realized something and stared at each other while laughing.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to do so much for the people from Vader City. We\u2019ll both become Wizards in the future, but now we\u2019re fighting for some worthless materials, is it even worth the effort?\u201d Angele asked, laughing.\u201cI can say the same to you. We\u2019re strangers, and there is no point for us to kill each other. I don\u2019t even know why I wanted to kill you when I first saw you back there.\u201d Benedict laughed. \u201cNice to meet you, Angele.\u201d He smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re strong enough to be my friend.\u201d\u201cI will never waste my time with weaklings.\u201dAngele also smiled.He suddenly charged toward Benedict, picking up his crossguard sword, and slashed at his opponent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: Standoff (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe*DANG*Benedict blocked Angele\u2019s slash with the black enchanted item he had and leaped backward.Standing several meters away from each other, they stopped fighting.\u201cMonkeys are fast,\u201d Angele said in a light tone.\u201cMusclehead\u2026\u201d Benedict wiped the dust off his robe. \u201cSince we both recovered, there is no point to stay here anymore.\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d Angele nodded.**********************It took them awhile to travel back to the logging site.Angele and Benedict came up with the conclusion that there was no point for them to die for the people that were not even directly related to the Wizard organizations and got to know each other on their way back.Benedict was from Manchester School and focused on learning Lightning Spells. He was also very good at the fundamentals of spells; his original plan was to travel back to Manchester and prepare to become a Wizard. Although Angele was a bit behind in his studies of the fundamentals and learned a lot from what Benedict told him, he knew a lot of things Benedict had never heard of. Thus, they both acquired some helpful information from each other.They returned to the logging site to see that the body of the first Glowing Elephant was already gone. Its blood was everywhere: the grass and tree stumps were all soaked in it. Large groups of flies were attracted to the place by the stinky smell here.Angele crouched beside a large area stained by blood and touched it with his right palm, asking Zero to analyze the sample. \u201cI think they left right after we started to fight. Campbell didn\u2019t start a real battle with Harland, and they both took some of the elephant\u2019s body.\u201d\u201cI think the other elephant is still around. Why don\u2019t we kill it together? What do you think?\u201d Benedict asked, walking out of the bushes.\u201cYou know where to find it?\u201d Angele asked, turning back.\u201cOf course.\u201d Benedict nodded. \u201cAlso, can you give me the model of your improved Hand of Exhaustion? It\u2019s a viable close combat spell after your improved it, and I\u2019m really interested.\u201dAngele nodded. \u201cSure, I can give it to you, but I want two of your basic knowledge models. What do you say?\u201d\u201cVery fair,\u201d Benedict responded.He took out a small crystal orb from his pouch\u2014it was about the size of a walnut. The orb was very clear, and its surface was very smooth.Angele knew it was a Memory Orbuculum, a rare magical item that was used to store knowledge and spell models. Usually, it could only be obtained by Wizards, so he was a bit surprised to see Benedict owning one.\u201cWhich two models do you want?\u201d Benedict asked.\u201cDo you have the Basic Enchantment Knowledge Model in there?\u201dAngele had seen Benedict apply a buff to Campbell\u2019s sword with the energy particles, which helped Campbell to perform a sneak attack. During the conversation they had earlier, Angele had learned that Benedict knew a lot about item enchantment, and his Master was also a legendary item enchanter.\u201cYea, I do, what else do you want?\u201d\u201cRanged spells. What do you have?\u201dBenedict patted the orbuculum lightly, and four rays of white light came out of it. Each ray of light demonstrated the basic property of a spell model.There was a blue electrical ball, a lightning laser, a blue electrical bird, and a blinking lightning rune shown in the light.Those models looked like holograms, and they were floating around Angele.\u201cThose are the ranged spells I know, pick one.\u201d Benedict shrugged.Angele nodded and looked at the spell models. He made the decision quickly and put his right hand on the lightning rune. It disappeared right after it contacted Angele\u2019s hand.\u201cLightning Rune, it\u2019s a great buff spell for ranged weapons and is also a powerful ranged spell. Good choice.\u201d Benedict smiled.\u201cI know what\u2019s best for me.\u201d Angele laughed.\u201cGood, let\u2019s trade then.\u201d Benedict threw the orbuculum into the air, and it started to float around them. There were many things appearing and disappearing inside the orbuculum; it looked like a slideshow.Angele had read about the process in one of the books in the library, so he put his right hand\u2019s first finger on the surface of the orbuculum and closed his eyes. Benedict did the same thing right after.\u2018Mentality Tunnel created\u2026 Target, Benedict,\u2019 Zero reported.\u2018Transferring information through the tunnel. Improved Hand of Exhaustion model, transferred. Collecting: Lightning Rune model, Basic Enchantment Knowledge model. Done.\u2019 Zero was monitoring the information transfer process.About ten seconds later, they both put down their fingers.\u201cHow convenient.\u201d Angele sighed with pleasure.\u201cOf course. I killed three rank 3 apprentices for this.\u201d Benedict opened his eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s exchange our sigils so we can communicate through letters after we get the magic pets.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dAngele drew a black rune in the air with energy particles. It solidified within seconds, was about the size of an egg, and was translucent. The black rune looked like a twisted snake with its mouth open while leaning forward to initiate a strike.This was Angele\u2019s sigil he had created based on an Ancient Baren Word.Benedict drew his sigil in the air too. It was a special round magic circle with blue electric pulses sparking around it.They pushed the sigils, and the two sank into each other\u2019s bodies after a short travel through the air.\u201cLet\u2019s finish off the other Glowing Elephant. We need to hurry because I don\u2019t have much time left. I need to head back to the school,\u201d Benedict said.\u201cSure.\u201d\u201cMake sure you write to me after you become a Wizard.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d*******************Two hours later\u2026Angele was holding a glowing heart in his hands. Its edge was red, but the center of it was green.Benedict said goodbye and disappeared into the forest.Benedict had said that Angele needed the heart more than he did, so he only took the elephant\u2019s tusks and left the heart.Angele had never thought he would become friends with his enemy. Benedict was strong and knowledgeable about spells. Angele really wanted to ask him a lot of things about enchanting, but he had to leave after taking the elephant out. So Angele decided to communicate with Benedict later, certain that he would be able to provide him some support later as a wizard.Benedict had also told Angele that he would be able to become a Wizard sooner or later, but he himself would try to break the limit after he went back to the school. If he succeeded, he would become a Wizard right away.Angele shook his head and stopped thinking, staring at the heart in his hands. The glowing heart was still beating, and it looked like there was a green flame inside. He could feel the heat just by holding it in his hands. Strangely, there was no blood on the surface of the heart; it was very dry.Angele made a small bag from the skin of the elephant and put the heart inside it. He started to walk toward the Lennon City since he needed someone to carry the body of the elephant back.It was early in the morning, and Angele heard people yelling his name after traveling some distance through the forest. They probably were people from Lennon City. He quickly headed toward the source of the voices.It took him several minutes to go across the bushes and reach several soldiers walking around with extinguished torches in their hands.\u201cIt\u2019s Master Angele! We found him!\u201d a soldier yelled in excitement.\u201cWhere is Mr. Harland and Mr. Tinos?\u201d Angele asked in a deep voice.\u201cThey\u2019re still looking for you,\u201d the soldier answered politely.\u201cWhat?\u201d Angele was surprised. He thought they would have returned to the city already. \u201cThey\u2019re still here?\u201d\u201cYes, they\u2019ve been looking for you since last night,\u201d another soldier said.\u201cReally?\u201d Angele blinked his eyes. \u201cTake me to them.\u201dTen minutes later.The soldiers brought Angele to Harland and Tinos. Tinos\u2019s arm was hurt, and he looked tired. There was a bandage on Harland\u2019s right shoulder, and Angele could still see a hint of blood on it.\u201cFinally!\u201d Harland walked over and hugged Angele. \u201cI got you the heart of the elephant.\u201d\u201cFor real? Thank you a lot! I thought the people from Vader City got it.\u201dAngele smiled.\u201cI knew you needed it so we insisted on taking the heart. You need to buy me a drink after.\u201dHarland laughed.\u201cNo problem.\u201dAngele turned back and hugged Tinos.\u201cWhere is the other apprentice?\u201d Tinos asked.\u201cHe was not with the people from Vader City, just doing them a favor. I\u2019m not his enemy, so we ended up finishing off the other elephant. Its body is extremely heavy, so I\u2019ll need some help to carry it back.\u201d\u201cThe other one is dead too?\u201d Harland was a bit surprised. \u201cThat\u2019s great news. I\u2019ll send some people there.\u201dHarland handed over the heart he got to Angele, and Angele was satisfied with what he received. However, he had wasted too much time fighting Benedict and was exhausted. He told Harland about the location of the other Glowing Elephant, then went back to his shop with the hearts.He needed some good rest before he could make at least one low-level enchanted item with the two hearts. The procedure was relatively easy, and he could try again if his first attempt failed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88: The Auction (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele closed the door carefully, took off his clothes, and lied in bed. There was still blood and sweat on his body, but he could not resist the comfy bed.\u2018Zero, check my body condition,\u2019 he thought.\u2018Checking\u2026 Various burns caused by electricity and lightning damage. Negative energy particles have damaged your nerve system, and your ability to use spells is impaired. Your organs are failing, please take action as soon as possible, otherwise you will get some serious sequela.\u2019It was not as bad as Angele had thought. He had known that his body won\u2019t be able to handle all the negative necromantic energy particles that he used to increase his magic resistance for a short duration. The organ damages were caused by those electric arcs he had taken during the fight. In other words, everything was just as he had expected.Angele struggled for a while and got out of the bed. He was drowsy, but he had to take care of his injuries first. Walking to the herb box, he grabbed some purple beans from it. He then put them into the stone-made grinding bowl on the table and started to grind the beans into powder.It took him about a minute to make the beans into rough purple powder.Angele opened the drawer, and there were many small test tubes lined up on a wooden rack. Most of the tubes were filled with green, blue, and red liquid or powder.He grabbed a tube that had blue powder in it and closed the drawer. He then removed its stopper and poured all the powder into the grinding bowl. After putting down the empty test tube, he started to grind again.After several seconds, white smoke started to come out of the grinding bowl, and Angele could smell the acrid fumes in the air.*CHI*Angele poured some water into the bowl, and the smoke quickly disappeared. He then spooned some thickened liquid from the bowl and put it into his mouth.The liquid was bitter and spicy, and it wasn\u2019t pleasant tasting at all.\u2018Positive Particle Neutralizer consumed. Time until the negative energy particles are neutralized: 17 hours,\u2019 Zero reported. Angele put down the spoon, satisfied with the result.The Positive Particle Neutralizer was usually used to heal injuries caused by necromancy spells, and it could be easily made. Neutralizers were mostly used on normal people, thus, Angele had never thought he\u2019d need one of them.He didn\u2019t need to worry about the negative energy damage for now, so he looked at the elephant hearts on the table. They were the most valuable items he had obtained during the mission.\u201cI need to have a good rest first.\u201dAngele shook his head, deciding not to start the procedure of making them into enchanted items yet. He threw the used bowls into the sink and walked into the backyard. There, he fetched a basket of water from the well and poured it over his head.The chilling water from the well made him feel refreshed, and his underwear was soaked. He put down the water bucket and pointed in the air.A light red rune appeared on the tip of his finger, then disappeared within a second.\u201cOssell,\u201d Angele muttered.Tiny red particles began glowing on his skin, and there was steam coming from his underwear. After about ten seconds, his underwear was dried and clean.\u2018That\u2019s one advantage of being a rank 3 apprentice. Using energy particles really helps my daily life.\u2019 Angele could use Wind energy particles to increase his moving speed, Fire energy particles to dry the clothes up, and Life Energy Particles to make plants grow faster.He sat down on the ground and started to meditate. After ten minutes, there were green light dots floating around him. The backyard seethed and teemed with life energy.He opened his eyes and pointed at the burn marks on his body. Groups of green light dots gathered and covered them up.Those Life energy particles could help Angele recover faster and heal his wounds better. He was not sure if using them on himself too often would cause any side-effects, but the only thing he noticed was the itchiness coming from the wounds. He returned back to his room after patching himself up.After entering the room, Angele suddenly had a strange feeling that something was approaching him, and it was something dangerous. He scrunched his eyebrows and every object in the room became marked with blue lines by Zero.\u2018Boosting your five senses\u2026 Searching for unknown signals\u2026\u2019\u2018Strange signal detected, marking it now\u2026\u2019A tiny red dot dropped on the corner of the room, the distance to the signal and various other information listed by it. Angele had thought it was an object, but it was a man that was crouching on the other side of the wall.Angele stayed calm, reading all the information about the man. The stranger was obviously stalking him, and his mission was probably to collect as much information as possible.The stalker was using the same skill he had obtained from the thugs he\u2019d encountered when he first came to the city, and it was the skill he had been practicing.\u2018Snake of the Sand Forest?\u2019 Angele guessed.He had wondered why those people had never come to him to avenge their killed members.Angele had taken the scroll with their secret stealth skill recorded on it from the assassin, killed those thugs in a brutal way, and had expected the organization to take revenge on him. They probably knew that Angele was weak at this moment and so decided to take action.Angele was severely wounded and was still recovering. Those thugs probably thought it was the best chance for them to try to attack him.However, they probably hadn\u2019t expected Angele to learn the secret stealth skill so fast that he could already detect their assassin\u2019s presence.Angele pointed his finger at the wall, and some black smoke came out of his fingertip. The smoke went through the gap of the window and hit the assassin. Angele heard the assassin groaning while trying to escape, and the man quickly left the place.What Angele had released was a small amount of necromantic energy; it would not do any damage to the knight-level assassins, but he was just trying to let them know that he could easily detect their presences.Angele\u2019s expression changed. He wanted to go after the man, but he was not sure if they had something else waiting for him, and he wasn\u2019t fully prepared to fight yet. Also, he was actually happy that the organization had finally approached him\u2014he still wanted to know if they really had the Dragon Scale Flower. Although the assassin escaped this time, Angele had special ways to trace the negative energy he had released.But still, Angele decided to be more cautious about things.*******************Twelve days later.\u201cHa!\u201dTia yelled and swung her crossguard sword toward Angele.*Clang*Angele easily blocked the slash with a black saber, barely moving his body.They were practicing sword skills in the backyard together, and Tia kept attacking while Angele kept blocking. However, Angele was predicting all of Tia\u2019s moves without breaking a sweat. Still, he was happy that Tia had improved a lot after he taught her his sword skills.\u201cVery good, you\u2019re improving a lot,\u201d Angele praised Tia, smiling. \u201cTake a rest, and let\u2019s have breakfast.\u201d\u201cYes, Master!\u201dTia was still panting. She put down her sword and bowed to Angele. It had been awhile since Angele had taken her in as his student.She was a hard-working girl and learned things fast. She practiced every day after being taught his sword skills and was passionate about learning.Angele wanted to know if Tia really trusted him and decided to test her by teaching her wrong ways of using certain skills. Although she looked confused for a second, she started to practice those skills without asking any questions, and Angele stopped her right away.He trusted her a lot now. Tia was the perfect student for him, and he asked her to leave the pie house. He decided to pay her for bills and ask her to focus on practicing sword skills.Watching Tia practicing his sword skill set reminded Angele of the days back at the Rudin Empire.He had developed his own set of sword skills with the help of the chip, and that was the reason why he had become strong quickly. Besides the attributes, Tia was very close to the old Angele.He slowly walked to the dining room, and Tia entered the room before him. She carefully laid down the sword and put the vegetable pancakes Angele had ordered into the plates. She also poured a glass of milk for Angele before stopping to stand by the table.Angele liked the girl a lot. She was very thoughtful, and she always had a serious expression on her face.After breakfast, Tia did the dishes and left. Angele decided to meditate in his room for a while.He had already fully recovered from the injuries and now wanted to convert those hearts he had gotten from the mission to enchanted items.\u2018Zero, how\u2019s the progress of analyzing the Lightning Rune? Also, report the progress on all other missions.\u2019\u2018Lightning Rune: 54% complete.Enchantment Procedure Simulation: 31% complete.Potion of Tranquility: 11% complete.\u2019Angele scrunched his eyebrows. \u2018How long do you need for the completion of the formula for Potion of Tranquility?\u201d\u201915 days.\u2019 Zero\u2019s answer was a bit disappointing.Potion of Tranquility had similar effects to Awakening Potion\u2014they could both help Angele increase his Mentality. The problem was that he had run out of the materials for crafting more Awakening Potions, and his body was already resisting its effect, so he decided to find the formula for Potion of Tranquility.High Mentality would help Angele break the limit. He also needed to find the Water of Asu and the defense spell model, but he didn\u2019t have any leads on those at the moment. Benedict had only offensive ranged spells, and his defense came from his enchanted items and the special magic circle.Angele walked toward a bookshelf by the wall and took a book from it. There was a piece of yellowed paper in the middle of it, and the words on it were all written in a special language, which normal people would never be able to read.It was the formula for Potion of Tranquility, but it was encrypted with the Nier Code. Angele had burnt the original version and made a new one with the encryption.He read the formula again. It was scanned and stored in the chip, but the way it was written caught his attention, and he wanted to look at it with his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: The Auction (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeHe had had the same feeling while reading the formula of Awakening Potion. The formula itself had no secret, but it was the arrangement of runes and words that made Angele feel like those formulas were from the ancient times.The strange feeling only occurred when Angele was reading the formula with his eyes, and he did not feel anything while checking it in the chip\u2019s storage.He stared at the formula for a while, but could not come to any conclusion. Putting the formula back, he pushed the book into the shelf. He applied some negative energy particles onto the book, so only Wizards would be able to open it without getting hurt.\u2018This place is not safe enough, I probably need to find a new place to live. I can still use the shop to sell the potions I crafted and make some good money off it.\u2019The shop was quiet and nice, but Angele thought security was a major issue. Also, he had a lot more equipment and materials that needed a larger storage space.The brown bookshelf had two levels. The first level had all the books in it, and two boxes were sitting on the second level. The smaller one had the red pearls Angele had obtained through the school missions. He took the other, the large black one, off the shelf with many strange lines and runes drawn on its surface.Angele opened the box carefully. There were two beating hearts inside it, and the strange-looking hearts were glowing due to all the green flames raising out of them.\u201cHearts of Glowing Elephants\u2026 I can make them into enchanted items, but I feel like it\u2019s a waste. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll find anything like them again,\u201d Angele mumbled. \u201cIf I have all the necessary information, I should be able to use them for the cores of my servants.\u201dAngele shook his head and grabbed the two hearts.\u2018Zero, do you have a better plan than making them into enchanted items?\u2019 he inquired.\u2018Analyzing\u2026Enchantment Plan A: Low-level enchanted items.Enchantment Plan B: One-time enchanted items.\u2019\u2018One-time enchanted items\u2026 I never thought of that. Are they powerful?\u2019 Angele asked.\u2018They will be 12.7 times more powerful than low-level enchanted items.\u2019Angele narrowed his eyes. \u2018I will make one low-level enchanted item first. If I can succeed in the first try, I will be able to\u2026\u2019\u2018Mission created, time required: 7.12 days. Energy consumed: 11.4 degrees. Mentality consumed: 9.\u2019*****************Ten days later\u2026Night.Carriages filled up the parking lot in front of the Mincola Auction Market of Lennon City, and many nobles were entering the auction market.Two heavily armored swordsmen were guarding the entrance of the market. The other guards beside were well-trained and were bowing to the customers who entered through the gate.A white carriage slowly stopped by the side of the street but did not enter the parking lot. A man with a pretty face opened the door and jumped off the carriage. He was wearing a black suit with a decorative silver chain on the right side of his chest; he looked gentle and quiet.Another man with short brown hair got off the carriage as well. He was wearing a white tight suit, and it almost looked like he was showing off his strong muscles. The man was glancing around the crowd, and the others were all trying to avoid eye contact with him. They felt uncomfortable just by looking at the man. Their instincts told them that he was dangerous.\u201cTinos, I\u2019m in the middle of an important experiment, and the urgent matter you said was the auction?\u201dAngele was a bit disappointed. He stopped looking around and stared at Tinos.\u201cYou know we missed the last auction due to my injury, but we won\u2019t miss this time.\u201d Tinos smiled. \u201cAngele, my brother already took care of the spies from Snake of Sand Forest in the city, and their family properties are being auctioned here. Those people were rich, and they had a lot of collectibles. I think there might be something valuable to you so I asked you to come. Today is the only day that you can place bids, so it is actually urgent.\u201dHe looked at Angele and winked.Angele shuddered and backed off a bit immediately.\u201cWell, I hope so. Did you find any decent house for me?\u201dAngele walked toward the gate of the auction market.\u201cI thought you forgot about it already. I found a nice manor several days ago. It is remote, and I heard there are ghosts living in it. Buyers backed off after hearing the rumors, so the price is great. I think that one fits your requirements,\u201d Tinos answered.\u201cI\u2019ll take it then,\u201d Angele said. \u201cGhosts may be scary to the normal citizens, but they are no problem for me.\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d Tinos nodded.He caught up and entered through the gate with Angele. Several nobles ahead of them turned around and greeted them. Most of the nobles in the city knew Tinos, and they had seen Angele talking to Harland many times, so he became famous too.Tinos scorned. \u201cWhen the Glowing Elephants were threating the citizens\u2019 lives, only the Knights in the army decided to help, while those nobles did not even provide any resources for the mission. The only thing they know is to purchase expensive decorations to make their houses look better. Without me and my brother, I can\u2019t even imagine what this city would become.\u201cThere are three major power holders in Lennon: me, my brother, and our father. Besides us, there is a dwarf Knight, who\u2019s the leader of the infantry. When the citizens were attacked by the Glowing Elephants, he did not send even a single soldier because he wanted to make sure none of his people died. I doubt they could have dealt with the Glowing Elephants if we weren\u2019t here.\u201dAfter the mission, Tinos became much closer to Angele and started to talk about all kinds of events with him.\u201cReally?\u201dAngele had wondered why they had only sent a small team to deal with such dangerous beasts, and it seemed the soldiers with them thought it was an easy mission. They probably trusted the Grand Knight Harland too much, or Harland just took whoever volunteered to come with him. It seemed he was not in control of the whole army.They walked down the hallway. The floor was covered by a red carpet, and there were oil lamps hanging on both sides of the wall. Solid fat was burning inside them, and there were more than enough lamps to make the place bright.Angele could smell the incense in the air.They reached a large hall after walking down the hallway.There were many chandeliers hanging on the roof, and there were rows of red chairs in the hall. Many customers were already sitting, so the place was a bit noisy.There was a large sign standing beside the auction block, which said \u2018Mincola Auction\u2019 in Anmag. The words were very well written. It was almost like they had asked someone to write the words in a special way.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go to my private room.\u201dTinos led Angele to the left, where they entered a door and saw a staircase. They went up two floors and reached a door by the end of the corridor. A maid in red was standing there. She bowed after seeing Angele and Tinos coming.\u201cOnly I have access to this room,\u201d Tinos explained, smiling.After entering the room, Angele found himself at the top left corner of the auction hall. There was a large glass wall in front of him through which he could easily survey the whole hall.There were a large sofa and several red leather chairs in the room. A large piece of white high-quality carpet was on the floor, and an incense stand was on a rectangular table. There were three incense sticks burning on the stand, and the smoke coming from the tip of the sticks made the room smell good.\u201cDo you like it? You can see everything in the hall from here.\u201d Tinos sat on the sofa and laughed.The maid brought them water and some high-quality fruit wine. She bowed and left the room quickly after depositing everything on the table. Angele poured himself some wine and shook the glass lightly. The fruit wine was green, and he could smell the fragrance of fruits. It was fall, so it seemed the maid had heated the wine a bit. Angele thought it was great to have something like this on a cold day.\u201cThere is another reason I asked you to come here.\u201d Tinos had a mysterious smile on his face. He stretched his legs and lied on the sofa, Angele just could not stop considering him as a \u2018lady\u2019.He had that strange uncomfortable feeling again and decided to stop staring at Tinos.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cTwo families will be fighting for their names here. They are almost done, and it is a story full of love and hate. The two families are enemies of each other, but their son and daughter fell in love.\u201d Tinos chuckled.\u201cA young leader of the family decided to sacrifice the family\u2019s fame for the girl he loved, but he failed, and his name was removed from the genealogy. However, the young man took the most important item in the family and sent it to this auction, so this put a price on his head. At the same time, this item is what the girl from the other family needs. I think she will be here tonight and try to save her love from the danger. She will try to convince the young man to cancel the auction of the item, but the young man\u2019s family has already set up traps everywhere around here. How touching...\u201d Tinos wiped off the non-existent tears from his face and faked a sad impression.\u201cYea, yea. Touching love story. How beautiful.\u201dAngele was speechless. He stood up and walked toward the glass to check the situation down below. He sipped some wine. It was smooth as silk, and he could barely feel the liquid going down his throat, but there was still a distinctly sweet flavor of the fruits in his mouth.Angele closed his eyes, enjoying the apple-like flavor.\u201cI don\u2019t care about things like this. The only thing I care is if I can find something useful to me.\u201d\u201cYou will, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Tinos yawned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90: The Auction (3)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele stopped talking and stood quietly in front of the glass, sipping the fruit wine slowly.The room\u2019s temperature was higher than outside, and Angele decided to loosen his collar. His strong chest was exposed to the air while he looked attentively at the auction hall.The hall got noisier as more people entered through the door. After about ten minutes, all the red chairs in the hall were filled up and the door was closed. Two guards in black heavy armor suits with axes in their hands stood on both sides of the door.An old man wearing glasses walked toward the auction block. His hair was all white, even the on his beard. The man had a serious look on his face, and there was a gavel in his hand.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, welcome to the Mincola Auction Market. I am Pierre from the Nalin Street, and I will be your auctioneer today. I think you all already know where today\u2019s items came from, so I will stop it here. All right, everyone, the auction starts now!\u201d The old man wasted no time and hit the sound block with the gavel.The auction hall quieted down after several seconds, most of the people staring at the auction block. Some people were still whispering, but they were not disturbing the auctioneer.\u201cFirst item to start the auction is the Silver Sand from Merfolk. It\u2019s beautiful and very valuable,\u201d the old man shouted out.Two strong half-naked men carried in a black metal box with two swordsmen escorting them. The latter were wearing leather armor pieces and kept glancing around.The black box was put down by the block, and one of the men opened it quickly. The box was filled up with silver sand. The sand was very smooth and shined under the light.\u201cSilver Sand is one of the Merfolk\u2019s major exports. It\u2019s very rare, and it will make your skin smoother if you apply some on your body during showers. It is also great for general skin care.\u201dBefore the old man could finish his words, the ladies and girls were already getting excited.\u201c2000 gold coins!\u201d a middle-aged noble lady shouted out, swinging the number sign in her hand.\u201c2200!\u201d A young girl raised her sign.\u201c2300!\u201d someone else shouted.The number kept increasing during the next several minutes, and many people were still bidding.Finally, several bidders gave up because the number was getting a bit ridiculous, but there were still people bidding.\u201c5000 gold coins!\u201d a young noble man stood up and yelled out.\u201c6000,\u201d someone in the first private room on the second floor said.\u201c7000.\u201d The young man looked at the private room and increased the bid again.\u201c8000 gold coins.\u201d The man in the private room did not stop.The hall became quiet after hearing the number, but the young man was still standing. He wiped off the number on the sign and wrote down something else.\u201c10 000!\u201d he yelled and raised the sign. \u201cI will pay 10 000 gold coins.\u201dMost of the nobles shook their heads and lowered down the signs. A full box of Silver Sand cost about 6000 gold coins in regular luxury markets. It was hard to find, but they would not pay 10 000 for the sand in an auction market.**********************Inside the first private room.Tinos grunted. \u201cSeriously? 10 000 gold coins for a box of Silver Sand? Whatever. Silver Sand will be shipped to the auction market every month. Why can\u2019t this guy just let it go?\u201dIt seemed like Tinos did not care for the sand but just wanted to win the bid.Angele shook his head. Actually, he felt relaxed when Tinos was around. The pretty man was a bit selfish and stubborn, but he was very simple. He did not like to be treated as a high-class noble, but people would not do such thing just because Tinos asked. Most of the nobles feared him due to his position.Beside Angele and his relatives, no one would treat him like an ordinary friend.Tinos considered Angele as his real friend after the encounter with the Glowing Elephants. He liked Angele a lot because he did not care about his position, and Tinos thought that Angele was the only good friend he had.\u201cDumb*ss!\u201d Tinos gave the young man a hard look.*********************The hammer came down. No one else bid so the hammer price was 10 000 gold, and the box of Silver Sand now belonged to the young man.\u201cWait!\u201d the young man suddenly yelled. \u201cI would like to let everyone know that I will gift this box of Silver Sand to the one and only, Mr. Tinos! I admire him!\u201dThe young man bowed in the direction of the first private room. \u201cMr. Tinos, please accept the heartfelt wishes from a humble admirer!\u201dPeople in the hall started laughing and clapping their hands.\u201cRogen, you are so generous.\u201d Some of the people knew the young man.The noble girls and ladies around were staring at him enviously.*********************In the first private room.Angele could not help laughing. He turned back and looked at Tinos.\u201cSomeone\u2019s trying to please you. I\u2019d be happy if someone just gave me 10 000 gold coins, whatever his reason may be.\u201dTinos had an elated look on his face.\u201cHumph, at least he is tactful.\u201d Although Tinos did not say anything about the young man, he looked happy, and his vanity was gratified by the young man\u2019s gift.This was just an interesting episode to Angele. Rogen from the Michelle Family paid 10 000 gold just to please Tinos, and everyone in the city would learn about the story within one day.The next item was an antique black goose-neck vase. The auctioneer said that the vase was more than a thousand years old and was from the Vlasov\u2019s era.Angele was not interested in antiques at all, and Tinos did not place any bid, either. The hammer price for the vase was 2000 gold coins.Half an hour passed. The next four items were all antiques, nothing catching Angele\u2019s attention.\u201cNext one is a treasure from the owner of the previous antiques. It\u2019s a leather book from the Vlasov\u2019s era, and it is more than a thousand years old!\u201d the auctioneer introduced the item in a loud voice.A young girl in a white one-piece walked to the stage with a silver plate. There was a dictionary-sized book lying on the plate. Its cover was brown, and the book was sealed with a leather band.\u201cThe book is more than a thousand years old, and it represents the knowledge of the mysterious Vlasov people. Collectors of books will not want to miss an item like this!\u201d the auctioneer shouted.Angele stood in front of the glass and looked at the thick book, still sipping the fruit wine. He remembered seeing the Green Ear Masa for the first time when he was on the way to Marua Harbor. His father had told him about the Vlasov people. It all felt like it had just happened yesterday.Angele recalled the sad look his father had in the ruins of Masa.\u201cAngele, do you know this language? I mean the Vlasov,\u201d Tinos asked, curious.\u201cA little bit.\u201d Angele stopped thinking and nodded.\u201cWhat\u2019s in that book then? Can you understand the words on the cover?\u201d Tinos questioned.\u201cOn the cover, it says \u2018My dearest Paul, God bless you\u2019. It looks like a book that lists codes for certain rituals, or it may be a memoir,\u201d Angele responded.\u201cIt\u2019s crap then.\u201d Tinos shrugged.The bid already increased to 20 000 gold coins, and people in the other three private rooms also placed their bids. There were only four private rooms in the hall. Besides Angele and Tinos, everyone else joined the bid. The hall was noisy, and the nobles all had the excited looks on their faces.*Thwack*The hammer came down.\u201c34 000 gold coins. Congratulations to Mr. Cains. The book is yours,\u201d the auctioneer shouted.After the book, a heavy-looking white box was slowly carried to the block by four people.\u201cThe next item is the most wanted item in this auction.\u201d The auctioneer corrected his glasses and grabbed an information sheet from the table.\u201cThe incredible jewelry that represents liberty and dream, the most beautiful and rarest, Stone of Lisa!\u201dThe box was quickly opened after the auctioneer finished his words. There was another smaller box inside the large box, and a girl opened the smaller box with a key, but there was another box inside.Another girl opened the box with a different key, and a black rhombus box was sitting inside. There were many complex patterns engraved on the center of the box, and the combination of the patterns looked like a silver-blue rose.The last girl opened the black box with a weird-looking key and opened it slowly. Rays of bright light shot out of the box when the girl lifting the lid.People in the hall gasped after the box was completely opened.\u201cImpossible\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the most wonderful gem I\u2019ve ever seen in my whole life\u2026\u201d\u201cStone of Lisa\u2026 It\u2019s true that this is the most beautiful gem in the world\u2026\u201dThe noble ladies were in shock, forgetting to close their mouths. People stood up, and everyone praised the gem.An egg-sized oval gem was lying on the black silk quietly, and the light it reflected was like a rainbow.Angele stared at the gem, but he did not feel the excitement the others were experiencing. He had seen better gems on Earth, and they even looked better than this one, so he did not lose himself.However, Tinos was fascinated by the gem.\u201cStone of Lisa, the purest gem in the world. You can display it at your castle for sure, but what else can it do?\u201d Angele shrugged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: The Auction (4)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cI will feel happy just by looking at it, and it will bring fame to my whole family. I\u2019m sure If I can win the auction, my life will be more complete!\u201dTinos was so excited that he almost jumped out of the sofa.Angele shook his head, speechless.*BAM*Someone pushed the door open from outside while everyone was still staring at the gem.People finally stopped looking and turned back to see what was going on. They also started chatting again. A young girl in a black one-piece appeared by the door, slowly walking toward the auction block. She looked calm, and it seemed the two guards knew who she was. They hesitated to stop the girl from advancing.\u201cNess! Do you know what you are doing!\u201d a deep voice came from the third private room.\u201cNess? The daughter of\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her\u2026\u201dThe nobles started to talk about the girl. It seemed like most of them knew her.Tinos stood up and walked toward Angele. He looked down the glass.\u201cThat\u2019s Ness Zweig, the girl I told you about. Finally, it begins.\u201dTinos had a delighted smile on his face.\u201cI really don\u2019t care\u2026 It\u2019s just an average sad love story.\u201dAngele poured himself another glass of fruit wine.\u201cCome on, it\u2019s not just that. I wouldn\u2019t bring you here if it was just a dumb story.\u201d Tinos smiled, \u201cNess\u2019 lover is named Anyua, and the treasure he took from his family was really important. The item was almost the cornerstone of his family.\u201d\u201cHuh? Really? I thought it was the gem.\u201dAngele was a bit surprised.\u201cYou know about the concept gears, right?\u201d Tinos swirled his glass and sipped some milk. Some white liquid stuck to the corner of his mouth, and he licked it off. The scene was a bit frustrating to watch.Angele turned to the other side and nodded. \u201cI heard the Sun of the Tribe was a concept gear, and such gears were crafted by the Wizards or Alchemists from the Vlasov\u2019s era. The amount of time required to equip the gear was reduced to the minimum, but the crafting method was long gone.\u201d\u201cThis treasure is related to concept gears.\u201dTinos had a mysterious smile no his face.\u201cIs it? Finally, something exciting.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d*************************\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing?\u201d the man kept repeating this sentence.\u201cI do actually, father,\u201d the girl answered in a calm tone.\u201cSomeone, take her away!\u201d the man yelled in anger. It seemed like something in the private rooms was making his voice clearer.Several guards rushed out through the small doors on both sides of the hall, charging toward the girl.\u201cAnyua! It\u2019s a trap! Run! The auction market colluded with them, so they already know you\u2019re here!\u201d the girl suddenly started to yell.She struggled, trying her best to dodge the incoming guards. They did not want to really hurt her, so they were holding back.\u201cNess!\u201d A man suddenly stood up and rushed toward the girl. He quickly put down several guards, grabbed her hand, and started running toward the exit.The handsome man had red hair and black pupils. He looked nervous. However, their route to the exit was blocked by a tall man, and the handsome man pushed Anyua back.The tall man was wearing plate armor pieces, and his gloves were made from metal as well. The man\u2019s black hair was short, and there was no emotion shown on his face. He looked extremely strong.The two and the tall man were not moving.A middle-aged man in a black noble\u2019s suit walked out of the door from the side and stopped by the tall man. He was staring at the coupleThe middle-aged man had a serious look on his face, and his appearance was relatively identical to Ness\u2019. Most importantly, Angele knew the man had blood on his hands just by looking at him.\u201cKnight Zweig, the only Knight stronger than him in the city is my brother,\u201d Tino explained. \u201cHe is Ness\u2019 father, and he\u2019ll become a Grand Knight sooner or later. Besides my brother, Knight Zweig has the most power in the city and a lot of Knight level warriors working for him.\u201d\u201cHuh, sounds scary.\u201d Angele nodded. \u201cHow about the one in heavy plate armor?\u201d\u201cKnight Ali, a top-level Knight. Knight Zweig saved the man\u2019s life many times during the war, so Ali decided to work for him later. His loyalty to Zweig is unquestionable.\u201dMore and more people started talking in the hall.Angele slowly sat down on a chair and leaned back.\u201cThe young ones are in trouble,\u201d Angele said calmly.\u201cSounds like you are much older than them.\u201d Tinos laughed and looked at Angele.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Angele remembered he was only 16 years old and smiled.The young man was grabbed by several guards, and they hit him hard. Knight Zweig held Ness\u2019 hands tight while she was trying her best to help Anyua. She cried, screamed, but could not move at all.\u201cPlease! Please! I beg you! Stop hitting him!\u201d Ness\u2019s voice was raspy, and there were tears dropping down her face.Zweig looked at one of the guards, and the guard hit the back of Anyua\u2019s head with the iron bar in his hands.*BAM*\u201cNo! Anyua!\u201d Ness had tears all over her face, and she almost passed out after seeing Anyua get hit in the head.Anyua lay on the ground. It seemed like he could barely move, but he was still trying to reach out to Ness. The blood kept dripping down his chin, and the red carpet on the ground looked darker after soaking the blood.Zweig did not care what his daughter thought and continued to tightly hold Ness\u2019s arms.\u201cI told you already. You\u2019ll pay for what you did. Anyua, if you hadn\u2019t ignored my warning, none of this would have happened.\u201dZweig stepped on Anyua\u2019s head.Knight Ali handed a sword over to Zweig. The Knight raised it into the air, aiming at Anyua\u2019s heart.\u201cFarewell, Anyua.\u201dThe sword started coming down.Suddenly, the right side of Anyua\u2019s neck started shining. A twisted red rune appeared on his neck within several seconds.\u201cThe rune!\u201dZweig\u2019s expression changed.Inside the first private room.Angele almost jumped up.\u201cThat rune\u2026\u201dHe was surprised, and his face looked serious.*CHI*Rays of red light started coming out of Anyua.Someone\u2019s strange singing echoed in the hall, sounding like the voice of a siren. The ethereal voice sounded clean and attractive.Zweig and the guards backed off quickly, staring at Anyua with fear clear on their faces.\u201cIt\u2019s the curse!\u201d one of the nobles in the hall suddenly shouted. \u201cThat\u2019s the curse from Holy Gear!\u201dAnyua was floating in the air, and the Stone of Lisa started shining as well. It disappeared from the box, turning into a red line. The red line quickly flew into Anyua\u2019s hand.The light became more intense, almost blinding everyone in the hall. After reaching Anyua\u2019s hand, the red line turned into some bloody red liquid which covered up Anyua\u2019s whole body. Within five seconds, the liquid solidified and became a suit of red crystal armor. There were thorns on the suit\u2019s shoulder and arm pieces. The whole suit was horrifying.Anyua looked like a strong warrior inside the red crystal armor suit.\u201cHoly Gear! Let\u2019s finish him off before he learns how to use it!\u201d Zweig yelled, drew his own sword, and charged toward Anyua. Knight Ali followed after him, and the other guards started charging as well.Anyua\u2019s eyes turned white, and he raised his hands.*Crack*The time stopped in this space after the noise.Everything stopped moving: the people, objects, tears on Ness\u2019 face, the blood, the falling glasses, and even the people charging toward him.It was almost like they were frozen. The colors in the space were gone, and everything turned black or white.Anyua\u2019s suit was still shining. It looked like he had already passed out, something else controlling his behavior. He summoned a red crystal dagger to his right hand.He stepped forward, about to stab Zweig in the chest. Suddenly, some green light dots from the first private room caught his attention.Anyua then turned back and looked at the second floor. Through the glass, he could see Angele moving green light dots around.Angele stared at Anyua calmly. They were the only ones in the hall that still had color on their bodies.The place was deadly silent.Angele suddenly felt depressed and lonely. He felt like everyone around was dead, and the strange feeling made his heart pump fast.The two stopped looking at each other at the same time, and the dagger in Anyua\u2019s hand was absorbed into his armor. Anyua grabbed the frozen Ness and slowly walked toward the exit.*Crack*After they left the place, colors returned to the auction room, and everything started moving again.\u201cHoly Gear? That gem is the Holy Gear?\u201d Tinos jumped up and shouted.Angele sat on the chair quietly and narrowed his eyes. He held the handles tight, finally having experienced a similar power to the green gem again. The power that could stop time.\u201cBut, it\u2019s not the Agility Burst\u2026\u201d Angele mumbled. He stood up, looked at the place where the couple had hugged each other for several seconds, and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92: Interrogation (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAfter what happened at the auction market, Angele asked Harland and Tinos to track down the young man named Anyua, however, there was no trace left.It seemed like the two big families came to an agreement and stopped fighting in the city. They did not announce anything regarding Ness and Anyua\u2019s disappearance.One month later.In the reading room of Tinos\u2019 manor.Angele was sitting in a chair with his legs crossed, sipping green fruit wine from a glass.Tinos and a middle-aged nobleman sat on the other side, calmly discussing the Holy Gear.\u201cHoly Gear is a high-rank concept gear. However, the man disappeared before we could even notice it in the auction hall. Effects like that were probably not from the life energy drained by the concept gear. Only Wizards can manage to do something like that,\u201d the nobleman said, scrunching his eyebrows.People like him hadn\u2019t noticed the time stopping at that moment. The only thing they knew was that Anyua and Ness disappeared in front of their eyes.\u201cStone of Lisa was the concept gear, that was the most surprising thing to me,\u201d Tinos said. \u201cA witness said he saw Anyua and Ness leave the city and go into the forest. I think we should just let them go. Legendary gears like that won\u2019t suddenly come to us, and we shouldn\u2019t waste too much time on them. Also, the curse on the Holy Gear will turn its owner into a killing machine. I don\u2019t really want it anyways.\u201d\u201cWithout the gear, Anyua\u2019s family is definitely weakened,\u201d the nobleman sighed. \u201cA concept gear changes the destiny of the whole family.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s leave it there. How long will you stay in Lennon, Mr. Monti?\u201d Tinos asked.\u201cMore than ten days I think. I\u2019m waiting for my people to come back from the docks.\u201d Monti scrunched his eyebrows again. \u201cMaster Angele, I heard you were from Ramsoda College. May I ask you a question about a strange plague?\u201d He turned to the side and stared at Angele.\u201cSure.\u201d Angele nodded, he was listening to their conversation quietly.Monti sighed. \u201cIn the southern provinces, there is a plague going on. Within three days, blisters will grow all over the infected patients\u2019 skin, and inside the blisters, it would be not body fluid but blood. After the three days, all the blisters will explode, and the patient will die due to blood loss. Have you ever heard of a plague like that?\u201dAngele\u2019s expression turned serious after hearing Monti\u2019s description.\u201cAre you sure it is blood inside the blisters?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Monti nodded. \u201cThe high-class nobles have already noticed how serious this plague is, and they sent a bunch of doctors to check the situation in the infected area, but none of them have figured out what caused the infection. I think thousands of people are already infected, so the situation is bad. The plague has already wiped out a large territory.\u201dAngele still had the serious look on his face.\u201cMr. Monti, please trust me on this. Don\u2019t go close to the infected areas,\u201d Angele said in a deep voice. \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, the plague is called Blood Boil Blisters. One must have a body similar to a Knight level warrior\u2019s to survive that.\u201dMonti\u2019s expression changed again, and he nodded. \u201cI will make sure I don\u2019t go there. I feel uncomfortable just by listening to the rumors.\u201d\u201cI think about 100 years ago, around the year 1430, there was a Blood Boil Blisters breakout in Santiago, and about 100,000 people died. Many people escaped Santiago, and it took a long time for it to recover. I\u2019d suggest controlling the infection area as soon as possible, otherwise\u2026\u201d Angele did not finish his sentence, but the other two knew what he was trying to say.\u201cI understand. The plague is being controlled,\u201d Monti explained. \u201cThe quarantine area has already been set up.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cAlso, I collected some potion formulas you asked for a while ago. I\u2019m not sure if they are what you were looking for,\u201d Monti continued. \u201cI collected them on my way here from the capital. I didn\u2019t know why Tinos suddenly asked me to look for potion formulas until I met you.\u201dAngele smiled. \u201cHow many formulas have you got there?\u201d\u201cMore than 30.\u201d Monti smiled. \u201cI will ask someone to send them to your place.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the price?\u201d Angele nodded.\u201cMr. Tinos will take care of that. He will pay me by the end of the year.\u201d Monti was not even a Knight, just a normal noble, and so was interested in meeting people with special talents. He would not ask Tinos to pay him because money was the easiest thing for him to get. He knew that it was best to do them a favor for free.Angele earned a lot of gold coins by selling the parts he obtained from the Glowing Elephants and had decided to ask Tinos to get him some potion formulas. He knew Tinos\u2019 friend, Sir Monti, was coming from the capital, and he would be able to collect the formulas along the way. Angele had already prepared the money, not knowing that Tinos would pay for it.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money, Angele, you are my friend you know?\u201d Tinos smiled.\u201cStill, thanks a lot,\u201d Angele responded.Those potion formulas had nothing to do with the Wizard potions. They were used to craft basic potions for daily use. Angele wanted to collect data from them. They would cost him several thousand gold coins at the most.*****************After leaving Tinos\u2019 manor, Angele jumped into a black carriage, heading to the manor he had just purchased.He had moved from his shop to the manor this month after paying about 10,000 gold for it. He had earned about 500,000 gold coins from the Glowing Elephants, so 10,000 gold coins were not a big deal to him. As dor the meditation, his Mentality was much more stable compared to before with the help from the potions. However, his Stamina decreased by one due to the side effects of Black Lead Potion and the sequela of the negative energy infection.Angele did nothing besides experimenting with potions and spells recently. He also meditated and taught Tia sword skills several times. His only social activities were all related to Harland and Tinos.Angele\u2019s Mentality stopped increasing awhile ago. Although he had gotten some more Night Honeycombs, it seemed like his body had started to resist the potion\u2019s effects, and meditating did nothing to him as well. Angele thought he had already reached the limit of an apprentice and already met the requirements to become a Wizard. For that reason, he was preparing to make sure he did not miss the summons of his school.He still needed the Water of Asu and the defensive spell in order to break the limit. Returning to the school would be the fastest and easiest way for him to acquire them. However, there were no rumors about Ramsoda College, and Angele did not want to miss any valuable information.It was already winter. Angele sat in the carriage, rays of sunlight hitting his hands through the window, but he could barely feel the warmth they brought. The chilling wind was blowing over his face.\u201cIt\u2019s 1542 already\u2026 Winter is not the most pleasant season for me.\u201d Angele pulled his collar up and peeked outside through the window.Most of the leaves had already fallen off the trees, and the pedestrians were wearing thick coats. Everything looked gray and white, even the sunlight was pale as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s the date today, Tom?\u201d Angele asked.Tom was the coachman specially hired for Angele by Alford. He did not know his last name and thought \u2018Tom\u2019 was probably just a codename.\u201cNovember the 18th, Master,\u201d Tom responded.\u201c18th? I think Harland is prepared then.\u201d Angele nodded. \u201cTake me to Twisted Blue Prison. I\u2019m not going home yet.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Master.\u201dThe carriage sped up and turned left at the next fork in the road. Its wheels made the dry leaves dance on the ground.***********************Twisted Blue Prison, the only prison that held prisoners that would be executed.The prison was at a remote location, surrounded by the forest. Many buildings were built for it, and the place was deadly silent.Those buildings had sharp roofs, their appearances identical to those of churches. Wood fences were built outside the buildings, and there were teams of guards patrolling the area. The guards had no expressions on their faces as they walked wearing heavy black armor suits. Most of them held swords in their hands, while others had iron hammers on their back.There were prisoners being executed every hour, and their dying screams could be heard from outside the buildings.A black carriage was traveling toward the prison, then slowly stopped in the parking area.\u201cWe are here, Master.\u201d The coachman was a tanned middle-aged man.Angele opened the door and jumped off the carriage. He was wearing a black hunting suit with long leather boots.A team of guards walked toward the carriage.\u201cMaster Angele?\u201d the leader asked.Angele nodded.\u201cMr. Harland already informed us, so you\u2019re allowed to enter the prison. However, the coachman needs to stay outside.\u201d The leader\u2019s face was covered by the helmet, and his voice was a bit unclear.\u201cI know.\u201d Angele walked past the fences and headed towards one of the buildings inside. He could hear prisoners yelling and screaming.The atmosphere here was cold and heavy.Angele looked around and asked Zero to analyze the energy flow in the area.\u201cNecromantic negative energy particles. Concentration: 65.72%.\u201d\u201cNice place,\u201d Angele mumbled.The lawn was soft, and Angele felt like walking on a carpet. He stopped by a building and knocked on the thick brown gate.*Knock Knock*A small window on the door was opened, and a guard peeked through it.\u201cMaster Angele, you are finally here. She\u2019s dying,\u201d the guard said and quickly unlocked the door.\u201cIt\u2019s good as long as she\u2019s still alive,\u201d Angele responded in a cold voice.Inside, there was a hallway with black stone flooring and sunlight coming through the small windows from both sides. The place did not smell good; it was wet and cold.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: Interrogation (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele scrunched his eyebrows.\u201cThat\u2019s how this place smells, I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d The guard smiled. \u201cYou can take this lamp with you, and it\u2019ll warm you up.\u201d He tried to hand over the lamp in his hand.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Angele pulled his collar up again and walked inside.He quickly reached a stone cell after walking down the hallway. In the middle of the cell, there was a staircase leading underground. It looked like a cracked well. Angele looked down and saw torches on the walls making the underground area bright.He could hear screams from the prisoners clearer here.He stepped on the stairs and walked down. There were rows of empty cells on the sides. Angele could see feces and blood stains inside them. There was a rotten smell in the underground area; the place stank.Several patrolling guards walked toward Angele and bowed to him. The captain asked the others to keep patrolling while he led the way for Angele.They turned right after several intersections, and the smell got even worse.The captain stopped by a cell on the left and opened it with one of the keys he carried.\u201cThe person you\u2019re looking for is in this cell, but I suggest you don\u2019t stay here for too long. She is dying, and I doubt she\u2019ll survive the night,\u201d the captain said in a low voice.Angele nodded and walked inside the cell.The only \u2018bed\u2019 inside was a pile of wheat straws. A woman in black lay on those straws, unmoving. The stink from the feces mixed with the rotting wound smell and filled up the air. Angele\u2019s eyebrows came together again, and he felt a bit sick.\u201cStill breathing?\u201d Angele kicked the woman with his boot.The woman moved a bit and struggled for a while. She turned her head over and opened her eyes slowly. \u201cWho are you...?\u201d She groaned, sounding extremely weak.Angele just noticed that the woman had a balanced body. Although her face was covered by a mask, he thought she must be a beautiful woman just by the look of her eyes.However, he did not care if the woman was beautiful or not\u2014she was just an object that would help him reach his goal. Also, he could not think of anything else in such a ridiculous environment.\u201cThe last hideout of Snake of Sand Forest has been destroyed. You would\u2019ve been tortured to death if I hadn\u2019t asked them to let you live,\u201d Angele said in a light tone. \u201cApparently, they misunderstood my order and saved the most beautiful woman for me. However, I just wanted a living one that could speak.\u201dThe woman on the ground stared at Angele. \u201cAre you asking me to thank you for saving my life? Ha\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you laughing at? As a mortal, you should learn to appreciate my kindness.\u201dAngele narrowed his eyes.\u201cGo kill yourself! You phony bastard! Insect! You think I'll trust your crap?\u201d The woman tried her best to increase her voice. It seemed like the anger made her head clear.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your problems with the Lennon City. The only thing I care about is the Dragon Scale Flower,\u201d Angele said calmly.\u201cHeh\u2026 Do you really think Snake of Sand Forest is all we\u2019ve got?\u201d The woman sneered, still staring at Angele. \u201cWait for it, Vansalla will bring the hope to us!\u201d\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t care about what you do. The only thing I need is the intel about Dragon Scale Flower. Tell me where to find it, and I can think about letting you go.\u201dAngele looked at her. Although he no longer needed the Dragon Scale Flower, he still wanted to use it to trade for other resources after he returned to the school.For that reason, he was trying his best to find clues about the flower.\u201cBastard!\u201d the woman cursed.\u201cI already told you, I can let you leave if you tell me where I can find it,\u201d Angele repeated his words.\u201cI know where you can find it, but why should I trust you? Scum like you never keeps their promises!\u201d The woman turned her head toward the wall.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Angele was getting nervous.\u201cDo whatever you want! Scum! I\u2019d rather feed the flower to a dog than give it to you!\u201d\u201cWhat do you want? Say it.\u201dAngele calmed down.The woman did not know Angele was serious and thought for a while.\u201cTake me out first. It\u2019s too dirty here,\u201d she said.\u201cHumph.\u201dAngele turned back, walked out, and talked to the guards.Ten minutes later.They were taken to a lounge with a campfire burning in the middle of the room, and Angele asked the guards to leave.The woman lied down on a long chair. Angele stared at her and said in a cold voice, \u201cTell me about the flower now.\u201d\u201cNot yet,\u201d the woman responded in a cold tone as well. \u201cGive me a glass of milk and some bread, I\u2019m hungry.\u201dThe guards brought her white bread and milk quickly after Angele asked.He sat in a chair with his legs crossed, watching the woman devour the bread. She almost choked on it several times.\u201cWhat else do you want? Speak.\u201dThe woman raised her head and looked at Angele. \u201cFirst, let me take a shower. Second, get me out of here. I will tell you everything I know about the Dragon Scale Flower after.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dAngele thought the woman was not asking too much.\u201cWho gives you the right to release a prisoner, Master Angele!\u201d someone shouted.The door of the lounge was pushed open, and a tall man in white leather armor suit walked in. The man put his right hand on the handle of his sword, not looking happy.\u201cWho gives you the right to question me like that? Knight Ali\u2026\u201d Angele\u2019s expression changed, and he stood up.Knight Ali worked for the Zweig family. He was also at the auction hall that day, but for some reason, he did not like Angele from the moment they met. And since he oversaw this prison, he had rushed into the room after hearing Angele was trying to release a prisoner.\u201cWithout my approval, no prisoner will be released!\u201d Ali said in a cold voice.\u201cWithout your approval? Who are you? You\u2019re nothing but a dog from Zweig Family! How dare you question my decision.\u201dAli suddenly drew his sword after hearing Angele\u2019s words and stared at Angele in anger.Before Ali could charge towards him, he heard the guards\u2019 voices coming from outside the door.\u201cMr. Siv.\u201d\u201cMr. Siv, you\u2019re back.\u201dAli returned his sword to the sheath. \u201cYou are lucky Siv is back, otherwise I would kick your arrogant ass, scum.\u201dAngele sneered, \u201cI can say the same.\u201dAli stared at Angele for a while, then turned back.*CHI*Ali swung his right hand and a silver flash flew toward the woman on the chair\u2014it was a silver dagger.\u201cYou\u2019re dead!\u201d Angele yelled in anger.He quickly kicked the chair down and knocked the woman off it. His reaction was fast enough to save the woman\u2019s life.Angele covered his right hand with negative energy particles and tried to hit Ali\u2019s face with it.Ali knew Angele would go for him and quickly backed off.*Clank*A silver broadsword blocked Angele\u2019s attack, and his hand hit the blade. The black smoke disappeared after the contact.\u201cMaster Angele, please calm down. Knight Ali didn\u2019t mean it.\u201dA man stood in front of Ali, wearing a white armor suit, and he started returning his broadsword back to the sheath.\u201cDidn\u2019t mean it? Knight Siv, I thought you were neutral in situations like this? What? You want to protect Ali?\u201d Angele lowered his hand and spoke in a cold voice.\u201cI\u2019m just following the codes. This is an important prison, and no fights are allowed here.\u201d Siv\u2019s face was covered by the helmet, and he was speaking with no emotion.Ali\u2019s face turned pale. He stood behind Siv, finally aware that the rumors about Angele were real.\u201cWhat was that black smoke? Knight Siv, did you see that? He was trying to kill me. That black smoke must be some vicious curse. This man was trying to attack a formal Knight. I will report the event to Harland for sure!\u201d\u201cKnight Ali, please calm down,\u201d Knight Siv said calmly.Ali held the handle of his sword tight, giving Angele a hard look.Angele did not care. \u201cI was granted the right to give orders to the city by Lord Alford, and releasing a prisoner isn\u2019t a violation of any rule to me. You can report to whoever you want, but if you try to attack me again, I will make you pay.\u201dAli opened his mouth and wanted to say something in return, but he hesitated and ended up saying nothing. He knew Angele was seriously trying to kill him and decided not to provoke him any further.He had thought that the rumors of Angele slaying a Glowing Elephant were exaggerating, but he now knew that Angele was strong after facing him in person. The power Angele had was not something Ali could handle. For the first time, he experienced the fear of fighting against a man that had a mysterious power.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Ali shouted and left. Siv bowed to Angele before leaving, and it seemed like he had business with Ali.Angele blinked his eyes and walked around.He finally sat down after a while. The woman had already picked herself up and laid her back against the wall beside the fireplace. She was thinking about something while watching Angele moving around.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94: Next (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cWhy are you looking at me?\u201d Angele said. \u201cTell me your name.\u201dThe woman blinked, then scrunched her eyebrows.\u201cJolin, just call me Jolin.\u201d It seemed she had calmed down. \u201cYou intentionally let Siv block your attack, right?\u201dAngele was surprised, but his expression did not change.\u201cI was blocked.\u201dHe did not admit it.\u201cWell, I think you were telling the truth. You are not interested in the political fight in the city,\u201d Jolin said. \u201cI guess you know who\u2019s behind the Zweig family, and I can understand why you don\u2019t want to mess with them.\u201d\u201cYou know a lot, huh?\u201d Angele smiled., \u201cI warned them already, and it didn\u2019t mean I was scared. There is no point for me to go into war with their whole family just for a prisoner. The loss wouldn\u2019t justify the gains.\u201dHe was still an apprentice of Ramsoda School. As long as the school wasn\u2019t wiped off the map by Northland Alliance, it would help him fight against a large family in the empire, but there were more things he needed to consider.Also, Angele always assumed that those top families had Wizards helping them due to their knowledge about mysterious power, but it seemed Knight Ali had no idea how strong the power was until Angele attacked him. Angele decided not to fight against them until he could figure everything out.That was also the reason why he didn\u2019t kill Ali\u2014 he was just trying to send out the message. If Ali died, Zweig would avenge him for the honor of his family, and Angele did not want that.\u201cGo wash yourself now, I will take you out of here.\u201d He stood up. \u201cHowever, don\u2019t even think about lying to me. I will show you what hell looks like if you do anything dumb.\u201d*************************Inside Zweig\u2019s manor.\u201cMr. Zweig! What Angele did was over the line! Twisted Blue Prison has always been under our family\u2019s control, who gives him the right to release the prisoner? Also, that woman...!\u201d Knight Ali stood in the middle of the meeting room and was shouting in anger.\u201cEnough!\u201d Zweig suddenly yelled. \u201cAli, you\u2019re way too impulsive for your age. We\u2019re not done with Anyua yet, and people only care about the Holy Gear at the moment! I don\u2019t care what\u2019s your agreement with Snake of the Sand Forest, but you shouldn\u2019t spend too much time on a prisoner. Also, Angele already warned you. He didn\u2019t kill you because he didn\u2019t want to mess up with the whole Zweig family. Do you really think Harland has no idea about what you\u2019re doing?\u201dAli opened his mouth again, still mad. \u201cKill me? If he didn\u2019t catch me off guard...!\u201d\u201cI said\u2026 enough!\u201d Zweig\u2019s expression changed. He walked toward Ali and touched his neck with his right hand.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, rubbing the right side of Ali\u2019s neck. There was blood on his fingertips. \u201cIt was very close. If Siv hadn\u2019t shown up and Angele did not stop intentionally, you\u2019d already be dead.\u201dAli suddenly realized that his neck had been wounded by Angele\u2019s attack. It was a slim cut, and if no pressure was applied to it, he could not even feel the pain. There was little blood leaking out of it, and it was barely visible on his skin. It was almost like the wound was already treated, and he could no longer feel anything.Suddenly, Ali had a chilling feeling from his back. He trembled a bit.\u201cHow\u2026 How is that even possible!\u201d He stepped back, his eyes were filled with fear.\u201cI know what Angele is trying to tell me. Don\u2019t provoke him anymore. I heard this man was from Ramsoda College, and Wizards from that school are known for their cruelty,\u201d Zweig said in a deep voice.\u201cSo, we just let him take the prisoner away?\u201d Ali gnashed his teeth.\u201cWe don\u2019t have a Wizard helping us, so we\u2019re no threat to him. You can go fight him if you don\u2019t care about your life. Harland asked Angele to go into our territory, and his intention was obvious. He wanted us to fight, or at least make us hate each other. The timing was excellent too, his plan was almost perfect\u2026\u201d Zweig said in a cold voice. \u201cWe need to find Anyua as soon as possible! The Holy Gear was almost in our hands. I didn\u2019t expect Ness to show up there!\u201d***********************Outside Lennon City, Angele and Jolin walked side by side in a forest.Leaves blocked most of the sunlight, and everything around them was dark green. They stopped by an abandoned ruin.The walls were cracked, and the staircases were covered by moss. A stone house was built upon a platform, and there were many climbing veins on its surface.Angele carefully stepped on the stairs which were made extremely slippery by the moss. The place was cold and wet, and he could smell the mold in the air.Angele\u2019s black dagger was hanging by his waist, and the metal bow was on his back. The crossguard sword was unrepairable after so many fights, so Angele had stopped carrying it a while ago.Jolin followed Angele without saying a word. She still covered her face with a black mask but had changed her clothes to a brown leather suit after the shower. There were two leather strips on her legs, and eight iron daggers filled up the slots on the strips.\u201cThis is the place?\u201d Angele turned back and asked.\u201cYea.\u201d Jolin nodded, her face pale, as she continued walking slowly.\u201cYou\u2019re getting worse and need to get treated by the best doctors within four days, otherwise you\u2019ll die,\u201d Angele said lightly. \u201cAlright, talk, what\u2019s the relationship between this house and the Dragon Scale Flower?\u201dJolin struggled for a while until finally reaching a platform. She glanced around, seemingly searching for something, but a disappointed look quickly showed up on her face.She then reached to her chest and took out a small glass tube. There was a piece of black cloth inside it.Angele looked at her, surprised. \u201cI thought they took away all your belongings after they caught you. Where did you hide it? How was that even possible?\u201dJolin blushed after hearing the question.\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business.\u201d She threw the glass tube toward Angele. \u201cThat\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for. The location of the Dragon Scale Flower. We found it during a mission. However, the place is dangerous. Our organization sent four groups of people to collect the flowers, a total of 100 people, but only one survived, obtaining only one flower. The others were all dead.\u201dAngele grabbed the glass tube; it was still warm. He scrunched his eyebrows, guessing the possible location that she could hide it at, and decided not to think about it anymore.\u201cHow can I trust you?\u201d He lowered his voice.\u201cBelieve or not, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got.\u201d Jolin was very calm.Angele thought for a while and removed the stopper from the tube. He then unfolded the black cloth carefully.There was a map drawn in white on the cloth, with many words written beside various points.There was a skull mark on the map, and it was marked as \u2018Moon Gin Manor\u2019 in red.Angele also found Lennon City on the map, but it was very far from the skull mark.He scrunched his eyebrows. \u201cSo, the cloth was put inside the tube about a week ago, but the map was corrected various times before that. You guys put a lot of effort into it, so I will trust you for that.\u201d Angele raised his head and saw Jolin staring at him in shock. Apparently, Angele had guessed everything right.\u201cJust by looking at it? You\u2019re pretty good\u2026 I\u2019m glad we decided not to attack you.\u201dThere was fear in her eyes.\u201cGood, you can leave now.\u201dAngele did not care about what she said.\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201dShe had not expected Angele to let her live.\u201cOf course.\u201d Angele nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re of no use to me anymore, and I will keep my promise.\u201dJolin stared at Angele for a while, then made sure he was not going to attack her. Only after that did she slowly back off. Upon reached the forest, she turned away once the forest and quickly disappeared in the bushes.Angele stood there, looking at the black cloth in his hands.\u201cI hope you didn\u2019t lie to me,\u201d he mumbled and drew a red rune in the air. The rune floated for a bit, then started glowing.Inside the forest, a red rune appeared on Jolin\u2019s back, and it looked just like the one Angele had drawn in the air. The rune was glowing as well, but Jolin did not notice its presence.*************************In the evening.At some quiet housing area in Lennon City.All the manors here were built from red stone blocks, and the streets were covered with black slate. There was a bronze goddess statue in the middle of an intersection. The goddess was holding a vase, and she was holding it down toward the ground. Many flowers were growing around the goddess, some white and some yellow.The streets were deadly silent during the night. There wasn\u2019t a single carriage or pedestrian around. The only noise was made by wind blowing over the trees and flowers.Several dry leaves dropped to the ground, then were blown away by the wind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95: Next (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeOn the second floor of a manor opposite the statue, Angele was standing on a balcony with a cup of hot chocolate in hand. He was wearing black pajamas and taking sips from the cup.He put his other hand on the railing and looked down. Only Tia and he lived in the manor. She cleaned the whole manor every day, did grocery shopping, and also cooked food for Angele. Tia took care of many things for him, and he sometimes thought he was getting lazy.This manor, or actually the whole housing area, was haunted according to Tinos. The price of the manors here had dropped a lot, and most of the owners had moved to other places, so Angele purchased all the manors in the area.There were about ten of them, and Angele purchased them all. He built up the mental fences around the manors and hired guards to patrol. He was paying for pretty much everything, including the workers\u2019 salaries, street cleaning, and garden maintenance.Rumors said those manors were haunted, but Angele had not encountered any strange events yet.*HOO*The wind was chilling. Angele sipped some more hot chocolate and walked inside the room. The hot chocolate he was drinking was made from a special plant he fell in love with it after having it in Master Adolf\u2019s house.He returned to his bedroom and sat down beside the desk. There was flame dancing in the glass oil lamp on top of it.Beside the oil lamp, there was a leather scroll sealed with a tight red line. Angele picked it up and broke the seal.There were two glass sticks on both edges of the scroll, so he could open it easily by rolling them to the side.On the scroll, some data was written with black ink:\u201821st: East side of the city, four unknown targets disappeared.22nd: Three carriages disappeared by the dock.23rd: Hunters reported a man in a black robe disappearing by the logging site.24th: Merchants heard beasts roaring by the west side of the forest.27th: Three man in white cloaks left the city quickly after buying supplies.\u202615th November: Merchants found bodies of bandits outside the city.\u2019Angele kept reading all the logs, his brow furrowed. He spent a hefty amount of money on these logs from the mercenary guild, and almost every event that had happened inside or outside the city in the last two months was written down on it.People in Lennon didn\u2019t know that the Wizard organization that was famous for its Necromancy and cruelty, Ramsoda College, was very close to their city. Those strange events the mercenaries had encountered did not bother them since they had no idea what those people were doing.However, Angele knew those strange events could mean the situation had changed in his school.\u201cIt looks like the war is almost over.\u201dHe carefully sealed the scroll with the red line again and put it into the drawer.Based on that information, Angele concluded that some of the Wizards and apprentices that left the school were returning to it.\u2018Before that, I need to go to the Moon Gin Manor first. It\u2019s better if I can obtain the Dragon Scale Flowers before going back to the school,\u2019 Angele he decided, establishing the plan.\u2018I need something more valuable than what I have in hand to trade for the Water of Asu and the defensive spell model.\u2019 He scrunched his eyebrows again. \u2018Without resources, I won\u2019t get anything from the school. I need to get enough items to obtain Water of Asu and the defensive spell model first. I\u2019ll be able to try to break the limit after everything is prepared.\u2019***********************The next morning, it was cloudy, and it looked like rain would fall soon.A black carriage quietly left the city along with the others, heading to the northwest province Karin.The black carriage was advancing slowly between golden wheat fields. Tthe wheat was already harvested, and the two horses in the front neighed from time to time. Angele sat in the carriage, looking at the wheat field.Some farmers were piling up the straws, and some were burning the ones that were already piled up. Red flame mixed with dark smoke that curled and danced upon the ashes. Several people sat with their legs crossed, having some food while watching the straws burn.The mountains were covered by a green rug of trees, and they were endless.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s going to rain. Shall we find a shelter first?\u201d Tom shouted.\u201cSure,\u201d Angele responded.\u201cThere\u2019s a mill in the front, we can use that,\u201d Tom continued.Angele heard Tom\u2019s words and stuck his head out of the window to see a yellow windmill sitting on the right side of their carriage. It was built in the middle of the wheat field.The windmill was slowly rotating in the wind, and Angele saw two one-horse carriages already parked by its side. One of them was red and the other white.He could smell a hint of wheat in the air and shouted out, \u201cSome people are already in there, park beside their carriages, Tom.\u201d\u201cSure, Master.\u201dAngele was in a two-horse black carriage without any family sigil engraved on its body.Two people walked out of the windmill after seeing Angele\u2019s carriage approach. They pointed at it and seemed like they were talking about something.After several minutes, Tom parked the carriage right beside the red one-horse carriage. Angele opened the door and jumped off. He then wiped some dust off his suit, still wearing the black hunting one with black boots and the dagger tied to his red belt. He looked like a high-ranking soldier with the clean suit and a serious look on his face.The two that were looking at him turned back and walked into the windmill without greeting him. It was a middle-aged man and an old woman. The man was helping the woman walk; it looked as though she was his mother.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Tom. It\u2019ll rain soon.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m good, Master, I\u2019ll take care of the carriage.\u201dTom smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The carriage will be fine.\u201dAngele smiled as well. He patted the door, and some black smoke slowly went into the carriage through the gap.\u201cI\u2019m fine, Master. I will just stay here.\u201dTom shook his head.Angele watched him take out a raincoat from a chest and knew he was not going to leave the carriage.He shook his head. \u201cWell, alright.\u201dAngele stretched a bit and walked toward the windmill.There was a huge cogwheel rotating inside it which connected the windmill to the grinder. The sounds made by the grinder were getting louder as the wind was getting stronger.The room was about the size of a bedroom with a closed tight window on the side. A young girl in red stood by it, peaking outside through the glass.There were two wooden tables and some chairs in the corner. The two from before were sitting by one of the tables. The man was carefully pouring some tea into the cup for the woman, and the aroma of the tea filled up the narrow space.Angele sniffed several times, the tea smelled like the one Tinos had gifted him a while ago. It was some expensive black tea, and he was a bit addicted to it. The aroma triggered his desire for some good tea.Two coachmen sat in the opposite corner, whispering about something.Angele checked the surroundings: spider webs were everywhere, and some flour was still on the ground.People in the room looked at Angele for several seconds after he first entered the place, but no one greeted nor talked to him.The young girl turned around and stared at him curiously. She was wearing a red one-piece and a pair of red boots, even her belt was also red. She looked like any other noble teenager, and she was holding a thin book in her hand.The book was open, so Angele looked at it, noticing several lines. \u2018Griffin kissed Felica, holding tight her waist. It looked like he was not satisfied yet\u2026\u2019It was just a love novel. Those love fantasies were very popular among noble girls.The girl realized Angele saw what was in her book and blushed. She quickly closed it, walked toward the old woman, and started massaging her back.Angele did not say anything, but walked toward the window and looked at the sky.The rain got heavier quickly, falling in furious drops, and the daylight was gone. The wheat filled was flooded, objects in it hardly discernible.Angele asked Zero to analyze the range and duration of the rain. Lists of information were shown in front of his eyes.\u201cThe rain will stop at 10:12 am,\u201d Angele mumbled. The estimated time was given by Zero, and the margin of error was about five percent.The girl heard his voice and looked at him again curiously. She took out a pocket watch out from her pouch and checked the time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: Initiation (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele did not care that the girl had heard his words. He just opened the window and looked at the heavy rain. It splashed onto the window, and some of the rain drops wetted the surface of his clothes.Suddenly, Angele heard bird twittering and wings shaking by the door.A human-sized large white bird dropped down by the door, shaking the rain off its feathers. The bird looked like a white eagle with a red beak and slowly walked into the windmill. Its translucent beak looked like a ruby, and its black eyes were human-like.The bird looked at the humans in the room after entering the windmill.\u201cThe rain is heavy, and I have to stay here for a while. I hope you don\u2019t mind, humans.\u201dThe bird spoke Anmag, his voice steady and deep, and he sounded like a middle-aged man.\u201cYou can stay as long as you want, it\u2019s a public room, Handsome Eagle of Byrutium,\u201d the girl in red said after stepping forward and bowing. The middle-aged man and the old woman also bowed to the eagle.The two coachmen stood up immediately and bowed as well; there was fear in their eyes.The eagle nodded. It seemed like he was respected by the citizens. Then he turned his head and looked at Angele.\u201cMy name is Conbass, you can call me Mr. Conbass. I\u2019m going after an Ember Mouse found in Lennon City. Please report to me if you\u2019ve seen it, and the King will honor you for your contribution.\u201dAngele scrunched his eyebrows after hearing the eagle\u2019s words.\u201cYou mean the mouse that has a fire burning around its body? The one that will leave a trail of ash behind itself as it moves?\u201d he suddenly asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t know creatures like that still existed.\u201d\u201cYou know about it too?\u201d Conbass asked Angele politely, looking surprised.Although Conbass was one of the races that guarded the empire, it was still necessary for him to show respect to the ones that were stronger than him. Creatures from gifted races were usually born with knight-level power.Ember Mouse was an ancient creature, and people who knew it either had a lot of knowledge or they were strong adventurers. Conbass thought people with wisdom and knowledge were respectable.\u201cYes, I read about it in a book.\u201d Angele nodded. \u201cBased on what I know, Ember Mouse\u2019s fecundity is extremely low, and they were hunted to extinction hundreds of years ago. Yet you said you\u2019re going after one...?\u201dConbass nodded. \u201cYou are right. This Ember Mouse is very important for treating the plague, but I don\u2019t know the details. I\u2019m just doing what I was told to do.\u201d\u201cThe plague\u2026 Sorry, I didn\u2019t see it. The only thing I know is you should check the fireplaces in the city, Ember Mouse loves living in human houses.\u201dAngele smiled.\u201cReally? That\u2019s some great information.\u201d Conbass looked at Angele. \u201cPlease tell me your name. If I can find it in any of the fireplaces, I\u2019ll pay you back one day.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Angele. Angele Rio.\u201dHe smiled.The others had no idea what the two were talking about and were quietly listening to the conversation. Apparently, those people did not expect Angele to be so knowledgeable, and they were now staring at him respectfully.Angele talked with Conbass for a while, then sat down to wait for the rain to stop.Eagle of Byrutium was a guardian race in Ramsoda Empire. These eagles were given high ranks in the country by the royals since their intelligence level was very close to that of humans, and they all had strong bodies. They could easily hunt large beasts with their sharp claws.These creatures shared the land with human beings, something Angele had never seen back in his hometown. Only humans lived in his father\u2019s territory, so he thought that other races with high intelligence had probably moved to other lands. He only encountered them in ancient book collections.Eagle of Byrutium had low fecundity as well, but their situation had gotten much better in the recent years. People could see them flying around by the capital from time to time.The rain started ceasing as time passed.At 10:12 am., the rain stopped.Angele wiped off the dust from his suit and walked out of the windmill. Conbass and the others followed behind him.He opened the door and entered his carriage, asking Tom to start driving.\u201cPlease wait for a second, Mr. Angele,\u201d Conbass\u2019s voice came from the side. He stood on top of the carriage.\u201cYou need anything?\u201d Angele asked.Conbass pulled out a white feather with his beak and threw it down. Angele reached his hands out and caught it in the air.\u201cThis is my feather. I may have some more questions for you later, so please accept it as a gift.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dAngele nodded. He held the feather in his hand, watching Conbass fly into the sky. He was fast and disappeared in the distance within seconds.Angele observed the feather. Its size was much larger than of the average birds, and it was also very hard. The tip of the feather was sharp, and it actually looked like a piece of a huge leaf.The feather\u2019s color was pure white, and it looked charming.\u2018I heard Eagles of Byrutium can find the location of the feathers they drop, but the effect only lasts for three days,\u2019 Angele recalled the information he had acquired from the books in the library.\u2018The main usage of the feather is to expel insects. Normal insects will naturally try to avoid it, so carrying it will prevent me from getting bitten by flies.\u2019Angele sniffed at the feather, it was minty.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Tom,\u201d he said, putting the feather in his pouchTom immediately pulled on the reins, turning away from where he was watching Conbass leaving.\u201cAs you wish, Master.\u201dThe horses stomped on the ground and the carriage slowly left the windmill. They were moving toward the main road.**************************Tom and Angele traveled for more than ten days after leaving the windmill. They stopped at a town to buy supplies, then left for the northwest again after they got everything they wanted.It was always raining on the way, and the temperature was getting lower and lower. Trees and grasses were no longer green, more and more white stones appeared on the roadside. They were not in the plains area anymore. The roads in the valleys were bumpy.They met a lot of travelers, merchants, and carriages after just leaving the city, but there were barely any people around after traveling for several days.15 days later\u2026Snow covered the mountains, and the valleys were misty. The black two-horse carriage was slowly advancing on a twisted road.*BOOM*One of the wheels hit a sharp stone, and the carriage started shaking. The horses neighed due to pain, scaring many birds who flew into the sky.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Angele asked, waking up and opening the door to stick his head out.\u201cMaster. One of the wheels cracked, and I need to replace it with a backup one. We need to stop for a while,\u201d Tom answered in a shout.Angele scrunched his eyebrows and jumped off the carriage.There were only pine trees in the forest. They were all very tall, and their leaves were still green. The ground was covered by both small and large stones. Some grasses under the stones were still green, but the air in the valley was cold and dry.Chilling wind blew over Angele\u2019s face, and his skin tightened up.\u201cHow long do you need? We are at the Moss Mountain from where it\u2019ll take us five days to reach the closest town. It\u2019s not a good idea to stay here for too long.\u201dTom shrugged. \u201cMaster, I will need one hour at the most.\u201d\u201cAlright. It\u2019s great to have you with me. I will double your salary after we get back,\u201d Angele said. \u201cI\u2019ll go for a walk. Just yell if anything happens. I\u2019ll be able to hear it, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Tom smiled, then walked to the back of the carriage and started taking down the backup wheel.Angele felt a bit cold and put on a white coat. The collar covered his neck completely, and he felt much better. He equipped the dagger and the bow before leaving the carriage.He spent a lot of time gathering data on the way, wanting to check the plants around here to maybe find some not yet recorded in the database.Angele walked for a while before suddenly lowering his head. He laid his back against a black pine tree and started observing a black umbrella mushroom. There were several yellow flying ants moving around it.Those ants left quickly after Angele crouched down; the feather from the eagle was very effective.\u201cOutsider, please leave my Black Point Mushroom alone,\u201d a young voice came from the top.Angele raised his head and saw a brown squirrel standing on a branch. There was a hint of whiteness on the tip of its tail.\u201cYou\u2019re growing it?\u201d Angele asked. \u201cBut you\u2019re just a squirrel, a squirrel that can speak. That\u2019s a first time for me.\u201cOf course. This is Ramsoda Empire. Many intelligent races moved here a long time ago. Not all of us enjoy city life.\u201dThe squirrel shook its butt and jumped down from the tree.*PA*It successfully landed by the Black Point Mushroom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97: Initiation (2)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/Frappe\u201cI\u2019m just a Light Squirrel. Traveler, you\u2019re at Moss Mountain, and if you keep advancing, you\u2019ll reach the Moon Gin Manor. I assume that's your destination after seeing your gear.\u201dAngele lowered his head and looked at the squirrel. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019m heading to the Moon Gin Manor, can you offer me any help? I need as much intel as possible. I\u2019ll give you some white bread and salty peanuts in return.\u201d\u201cI already traded my intel for food with three groups of adventurers, however, none of them came back. It\u2019s not too late to go back,\u201d Light Squirrel responded.\u201cJust tell me everything you know. I\u2019ll make the decision myself.\u201dAngele smiled.\u201cFine.\u201dThe squirrel shrugged and sat down by the Black Point Mushroom.\u201cI don\u2019t know who built the Moon Gin Manor. I usually call it the Moon Gin Garden. During a specific time of year, I can smell a highly-concentrated flower based fragrance from it. Also, only humans tried to enter that place, the other species feared its mysterious aura. A Knight took his team into the garden not so long ago, and only one soldier survived. He escaped with a face covered in blood, and lost his mind later on.\u201d\u201cI heard there are Dragon Scale Flower inside?\u201d Angele said.\u201cNot just Dragon Scale Flowers, there are also many other rare plants like Star Light Grass, Hardin Grass, and Single Eye Flower.\u201d Squirrel nodded. \u201cAlso\u2026\u201dAngele had a general idea about the place based on the squirrel\u2019s description.He furrowed his eyebrows a bit. \u2018It\u2019s either an undeveloped resource point or some Wizard\u2019s abandoned private resource point. The Wizard left the place and the barrier spell weakened, but he didn\u2019t disarm all the traps. Then Snake of the Sand Forest found it due to luck and somehow managed to snatch a Dragon Scale Flower from it.\u2019The squirrel finished explaining everything to Angele, and he started thinking. Only a formal Wizard could create a resource point like that since it seemed like this point was still hidden, and its barrier remained. People needed to wait for it to open if they wished to enter.\u201cSo\u2026 The gap appears once a year? Do you know when it will open again?\u201d Angele asked again.The squirrel did some calculations on the ground. \u201cYou need to wait another month. Birds will fly out of the manor when the gap appears, and they will rotate around this area for about an hour. This is the amount of time the gap stays open, so you need to get out before it closes. Otherwise you\u2019ll be trapped inside the garden, forced to wait for the next time the gap appears.\u201d\u201cOne more month, huh?\u201d Angele thought for a while and stood up. \u201cPlease follow me to my carriage. I will give you the food that I promised you, and thanks.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u2026 hehe.\u201dThe squirrel raised its claws, a weird smile on its face. It followed Angele, repeatedly shaking its tail.Angele gave it a whole bag of snacks, and it happily went back into the forest. Angele watched Tom replace the wheel, but he was thinking about something else.It took Tom a while to make sure everything was done correctly. He put the tools back and stood up.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s done.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAngele nodded and jumped onto the carriage. They started advancing again.Inside the carriage, Angele was not sleepy anymore. He looked out the window. The only things he could see were pine trees with no other travelers around. There were white stones lying on the grasses, and Angele saw strange creatures jumping between the bushes from time to time.They traveled for about an hour until a fork appeared in the road ahead of them. There was a brown sign indicating the location names of the two places the different roads led to.Angele asked Tom to stop and carefully checked the sign. Moon Gin Manor was on the left, and Moss Town was on the right.He looked at the ground. There were prints of wheels, hooves, and footprints on the way to the right, but the way to the left was covered by weeds.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the Moss Town first. Stay there and wait for me, I have some things to deal with,\u201d Angele ordered.\u201cGot it.\u201dTom nodded. Before he started the trip, Angele had already paid him 200 gold coins, and it was just a bonus besides the monthly salary. Those gold coins had helped his family a lot for which he was grateful. But he knew the trip was dangerous, so he decided to follow Angele\u2019s instructions carefully.****************Moss town was in a remote area, and it was quiet. There was only one main street in the town, and about ten wooden houses built on both sides of the street. About 100 people lived in the town, and there was only one bar, one grocery store, and one hotel.Angele had learned this before leaving for the trip.People in the town usually poured the wastewater straight on the street, which made the gray road wet and dirty. The brown wooden houses were built close to one another on the street\u2019s sides.There were barely any people on it, but Angele knew people in the houses were staring at him.Near the end of the street, there was a three-storey building on the right side built from yellow bricks. A black horse was tied nearby and was eating grasses. A two-horse carriage was parked beside the horse. It was white with a black scale emblem engraved on its door.Two workers were chatting beside the carriage. Angele was walking in the front and Tom following after him with the carriage. The noise made by the horses\u2019 hooves caught the workers\u2019 attention, and one of them ran into the building to report.Angele walked closer to the building and read the sign that was hanging on the fence. It said \u2018Hotel\u2019 but the word was poorly written in Anmag.Two young men walked out of the building. One of them was wearing gray linen clothes, had short brown hair, and was smiling. It looked like he was the owner of the place. The other guy wore a dark red robe and had no expression on his face, but for some reason, Angele could barely sense his presence. It was a strange feeling, and Angele stared at him but still did not feel like the man was in his sight.\u201cWelcome, travelers. My name is Steven, and I\u2019m the owner of the hotel. Are you looking for a place to stay?\u201d Steven asked in a loud voice after stepping forward.\u201cYea, we are. What\u2019s the price?\u201dTom jumped off the carriage and started to negotiate the price with Steven.\u201c15 silver coins per night for one person.\u201d\u201cHow about 14? That\u2019s more reasonable.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I never give discounts, and the price is always 15 silver coins.\u201d\u201c14 silver coins per night, and we will pay upfront.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dTom kept trying to get a better price, and Angele kept looking at the man in the red robe. He saw a red flame sigil on the man\u2019s collar.\u201cGreetings.\u201dThe man stepped forward.Angele smiled. \u201cSantiago?\u201d he asked in a lowered his voice.The man shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should talk about it here.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dAngele nodded.The man stepped to the side. \u201cThere are three of us. I don\u2019t care where you\u2019re from, but I believe we share the same goal. Let\u2019s get in first.\u201dAngele did not hesitate and entered the first floor of the hotel.There were three round red wooden tables, and two groups of people were sitting beside two different tables.A person covered by a black cloak was on the left. Angele was not sure about his gender due to the mask on his face. An old man with a young girl in hunting suit was sitting next to the other table.The old man and the girl narrowed their eyes when they saw Angele entering the room. It seemed like they did not want people like Angele showing up here.Angele walked toward the empty table and sat down. The atmosphere here was a bit awkward and heavy. The man in the red robe sat down by the man in the black cloak and closed his eyes. He was probably meditating.It looked like people in the room were following a certain rule, and no one wanted to talk.Angele sensed traces of energy particles from the others, which meant they were at least rank 2 apprentices. They probably already knew how dangerous the Moon Gin Manor was but still came.It took Tom a while to get the price he wanted. He walked into the room, talked to Angele for several seconds, and then went to take care of the carriage again. Tom wanted to make sure no one touched the items in it.During the lunchtime, a woman in gray apron walked into the room with several dishes and put down food on the tables.There was some black meat jerky, several pieces of wheat cake, and a bowl of hot mushroom soup in front of Angele. He grabbed a piece of the wheat cake and was surprised by its texture. It was crispy like a soda cracker and salty.The meat jerky was barely edible. Angele spent five minutes chewing it before ending up just swallowing everything down. The soup was good compared to the other dishes. He threw everything into the soup and finished it all.The owner waited quietly by the side, wanting to talk after Angele finished his food. They went up to the second floor once he was full.Angele\u2019s room was on the right side by the end of the hallway. Inside, there was only a bed and a desk and a smell of dust everywhere. He couldn\u2019t see it, however, so the room must have been just cleaned.Angele and Tom rented two rooms for two months and paid right away. After receiving the payment, the owner walked out of the room, counting the coins in his hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: Initiation (3)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele rested for a while in the room and started meditating.There were many ways for apprentices to meditate, and the meditation methods differed from one organization to another, but they all had similar effects.Besides the rank and talent requirements, apprentices needed knowledge and resources to help them break the limit and ultimately become Wizards. Angele still needed Water of Asu and a suitable defensive spell. The meditation method he used was learned from Ramsoda School, and he found that its results were very close to the method\u2019s he had learned from the Wizard book that Adolf had given him.Nothing special happened during Angele\u2019s stay in the hotel.He barely communicated with others, and he did not even know their names. Most of the people in the hotel had the same purpose as Angele and spent their time checking the environment around the Moon Gin Manor every day. They weren\u2019t interested in others, so no one tried to have a conversation with Angele. So besides meditating, he spent most of his time investigating the area, wanting to make sure he was relatively well prepared for entering the manor.Angele found one strange thing about it - there were no animals that could be seen around it, not even insects. The grasses, trees, and any other plants also were non-existent. It looked like the whole area was \u2018dead\u2019. The only objects beside the manor\u2019s cracked walls were black stones.He investigated around the wall several times but gave up on the idea of going deeper after sensing the strange aura. He asked Zero to check the area, but sadly, nothing could be detected by the chip.The chip was just a support tool and could not do everything for Angele. It buffed his five senses, but he still found no valuable information about the manor, which meant the mysterious power protecting the place was beyond his understanding. After several investigations, he decided to stay in the hotel and wait for the day to come.Time flew, and the gap finally appeared on the date the squirrel mentioned.****************************The gray completely carpeted the sky, not a single ray of sunlight could penetrate the heavy clouds.Angele got out of bed and eyed the sky through the window. He saw nothing but the dark and dense clouds. The forest was quiet and birds were not twittering like usual.\u201cFinally.\u201dHe inhaled once and put on his hunting suit, then quickly equipped himself with the bow and the dagger.Angele opened the door quietly and saw a person standing in the hallway. The man was still wearing the black cloak and robe. He was wiping the dust off his clothes. It seemed like he had just woken up as well.The man saw Angele and nodded. Angele still had not seen the man\u2019s face since he never left his room without a mask and the oversized cloak.The hallway was dark, and Angele\u2019s brow furrowed but nodded in reply. He locked his door and walked down the stairs.The man in the red robe and the old man and the young girl were already in the lounge. They were drinking hot milk the servers had brought them.Angele sat down by an empty table, grabbed several biscuits, and drank some milk.\u201cSince everyone is here, I guess I\u2019ll start talking,\u201d the old man said in a deep voice after standing up.He looked around, making sure he had everyone\u2019s attention and cleared his throat. \u201cI don\u2019t care how you guys fond out about this place, but we need to work together in the garden if we want to take the treasures out of it. There is only five of us, so it will be hard for sure.\u201d\u201cTrue. I think everyone here knows what\u2019s coming, and you are all well prepared for it,\u201d the man in the red robe said. \u201cMessi, are you sure you want to take your granddaughter there?\u201d He looked at the girl in a brown hunting suit.\u201cThis is my last try, and you know my situation can\u2019t be any worse.\u201d The old man named Messi shrugged. \u201cMoon Gin Garden is an ancient resource point, and it\u2019s full of traps. I wouldn\u2019t take her there if the situation allowed it, but it\u2019s probably better for us both to die inside the garden at this point.\u201dMessi looked at his granddaughter, his eyes filled with sadness.\u201cWhatever, old man, I don\u2019t care. We know the place is extremely dangerous already. Just tell us the plan!\u201d the man in the black cloak interrupted.\u201cThe plan is easy. We move together and get in through the gap and make sure no one triggers unnecessary traps,\u201d Messi said turning to face him.\u201cCool.\u201d The man in the black cloak nodded. His voice was hoarse, but Angele could not tell if he was male or female.The man in the red robe nodded as well. \u201cI agree.\u201dAngele listened to their conversation quietly. It seemed like they were quite familiar with the garden, whereas he barely knew anything about it. So he decided to collect some information first, and he had nothing against the plan.\u201cI\u2019m fine with it too,\u201d Angele said in a light tone.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s move then. We need to enter it before 10 a.m. Let\u2019s face the challenges together and reach the true garden. Take whatever resource you want, as long as you are capable of doing it by yourself,\u201d Messi added.\u201cFor sure.\u201d The man in the black cloak nodded.Messi\u2019s granddaughter looked nervous. She held his hand tight as they walked out through the door together.Angele double-checked everything he needed was inside the pouch and followed after the others.It was deadly silent outside, no one was on the street, and no birds or insects could be seen.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It\u2019s way too quiet.\u201d The man in the red robe scrunched his eyebrows.\u201cI poured some Sleep Dust into the main well yesterday. I don\u2019t want anyone to bother us; they\u2019ll be sleeping for the whole day,\u201d the man in the black cloak explained.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 helpful.\u201d The red robe looked at the black cloak and did not finish his words.The five of them slowly walked down the street.Angele noticed his horses were sleeping as well when he walked out of the hotel. It seemed like the man in the black cloak had drugged everything in the town. Sleep Dust was extremely effective on normal people, but it would only make the ones with high Stamina points sleepy.The five quickly left the town and arrived at the fork in the road.The sign was shaking in the air due to the wind. It was still dark and cloudy.Messi looked at the sign and walked to the path to the garden with his granddaughter. Angele was the last in the team. He looked at the sign and saw something strange.The word \u2018Moon Gin Manor\u2019 was no longer on the sign. It was replaced with \u2018Death\u2019. The word was red and written with blood. It was fresh, and the blood was still dripping down the wooden board.Angele hesitated for a second, then hastened his pace. The team was advancing slowly and carefully. They were walking upon the dried grass. No one tried to start a conversation, and Angele could hear people breathing heavily.After a while, he realized that the gray sky was turning red.\u201cPrepare yourselves,\u201d Messi suddenly yelled. \u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201dEveryone else\u2019s expression changed after hearing the words, but they did not say anything.Angele grabbed his metal bow and slowly pulled a black arrow out of the quiver. He thought he had checked all the routes around the manor during his investigations, but nothing looked familiar here. He slowed down and stayed alert.Time kept passing. The team did not stop for a single second and kept advancing. The road was straight, and there was no grass on the ground anymore.The sky was already bloody red, and it made everything under it look horrifying. The atmosphere was getting heavier and heavier.Angele sniffed the air, and a fishy smell was left in his nose.\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d the man in the red robe said.\u201cWe traveled for about 15 minutes and passed through the gap already. Stay alert, everyone,\u201d Messi advised.The entrance to the garden appeared in front of them. The garden itself was surrounded by a black metal fence, and the gate was half open. It was the end of the road, and Angele could see the tall trees and plants inside behind the fence.The color in the sky started changing again. It was not red anymore, but turned back to gray after they reached the gate.Messi stood in front of the gate and pointed his finger in the air.*Ding*The air rippled, and a red cross, which started glowing, appeared on the tip of his finger. The cross solidified in the air, and it had the same height and width as the gate.Messi used some incantation and snapped his fingers. A white flame appeared on his palm and burned quietly. The old man waited several seconds, then pushed the flame forward.It was pushed into the middle of the cross.*Crack*Everything disappeared after the flame contacted the cross, and the gate returned to normal.\u201cGood, I checked the gap, it will last for about one hour and a half this time. We can go in now,\u201d Messi muttered, looking tired.\u201cHeh,\u201d the man in the black cloak sneered and walked in.The man in the red robe looked at Angele for a second, then entered through the gate as well, but he did not say anything.Angele knew that he had to stay alert all the time, but he didn\u2019t show any emotion on his face. He just followed after the two.Messi and his granddaughter went in after him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Initiation (4)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeThe size of the plants inside the garden was humongous.Angele could see tree leaves that were the size of a washbasin and huge sunflowers about the size of an adult.Angele stepped forward and carefully observed one of the sunflowers. He saw a human face right in the middle of the flower; its eyes were closed, and it wasn\u2019t breathing. Neither eyebrows nor mustaches could be seen. Angele looked around and saw the same faces on all the sunflowers. It was almost as if the face was the flower itself, with petals growing around it.The path was surrounded by huge sunflowers. He didn\u2019t know when these faces would open their eyes. Just by looking at them, Angele could already feel a chill creeping upon him.The others didn\u2019t seem concerned about it; only the girl was slightly scared. It was probably that they already knew of the existence of those flowers.It was a short path, so they went across it quickly. Before leaving, Angele decided to take several flowers with him for research purposes.They entered the iron gate by the end of the flower path. There, they saw another path lying between the bushes. Gray stone chairs sat on both sides of the path; even the ground had been constructed with gray bricks. Again, a gate laid by the end of this path, yet this time, the gate was made from stone.As the five of them stepped on these bricks, the ground began shaking.*Clank*The bricks stood up one by one, with feet suddenly appearing on their bodies.\u201cAh!\u201dThose bricks screamed at the top of their lungs, doing so while running away quickly. All the bricks disappeared from their sights within a single minute, almost like they were running for their lives.The five stood there as they watched the bricks leave until nothing was left on the ground. They were all speechless.Suddenly, the white stone gate by the end of the path dissipated in the air, breaking down just like soap bubbles.\u201cWait! Those are Screaming Bricks. They\u2019ll lead us to the next destination. Without them, we won\u2019t be able to proceed. We need to get them back!\u201d the black-robed man shouted.\u201cHow? Those bricks are fast, we have no way of tracking them down.\u201d The red-robed man had his brows scrunched up.\u201cThey love Earth element energy particles. Anyone? Please,\u201d Messi slowly spoke.\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d The red-robed man stepped forward. He closed his eyes and raised his palm.He began invoking incantations. As he did so, groups of brown spots of light quickly gathered onto his palm. Those spots of light were of dense and heavy property.The spots of light looked like sesame seeds. Slowly, it formed an egg-sized, black ball on the man\u2019s palm and started glowing.Right after the man opened his eyes and stopped the incantation, he threw the ball down in a careful manner.The black ball dropped down and sank into the mud.*CHI*The ball liquefied and turned into black-brown oil, which covered the entirety of the area the bricks formerly had been, and a black path appeared in front of them.*Kata-kata*Angele heard intense footsteps coming from all angles. It sounded like a group of people running at full speed.All the bricks that had escaped returned to their original position within minutes and an amusing scene took form. They were licking the liquefied Earth element energy particles; they even started talking. It was as though they were praising the taste of the particles. Angele couldn\u2019t understand a single word they spoke, but he could easily identify their genders; the place became noisier and noisier.As the bricks returned to their position, the white gate by the end of the path revealed itself slowly.\u201cMove! Don\u2019t waste any time,\u201d Messi advised.They quickly stepped on the bricks and rushed toward the white gate.\u201cOh!\u201d Angele stepped onto a brick, causing it to moan in pleasure. Angele felt uncomfortable upon hearing such strange sounds, so he increased his pace.Every brick that had been stepped on began moaning, nearly sounding as though they were having orgasms.Messi stepped onto the last piece of brick. It moaned several times before it ceased moving.Messi became flustered and had goosebumps all over his body. His granddaughter was laughing from the side after seeing what just transpired.\u201cDamn bricks!\u201d He swore, and the others started laughing as well.\u201cWho the hell creates a spell like this! Some of the Ancient Wizards were really sick.\u201d The black-robed man chuckled.\u201cHumph!\u201d Messi looked ashamed, and he entered the gate first.The others followed him from behind, then arrived at an empty patio. Nothing was around besides the dried leaves on the ground. The place was deadly silent.Within the confines of the gray walls was a pool in the middle of the patio. The exit was located right beside it. By the exit, Angele could see various plants and flowers flourish.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d Messi\u2019s granddaughter looked at the exit and shouted in excitement, \u201cI see the Byro Flower! Grandpa, we finally found it and\u2026\u201d*ROAR*The violent cry from the lions broke the fleeting peace, interrupting Messi\u2019s granddaughter from finishing her words.Two golden lions jumped off the wall and landed in front of the five. They were standing upright on their hind legs. Silver sabers and black chain hammers being held in their hands.These lions were bare naked and their body extremely strong. They looked like two bullnecked beefy men. Their dense mane waved in the air, following their own movements.\u201cThe Guardians!\u201d The black-robed man placed his hand into his pouch and stepped back.The five started preparing for battle right away. The red-robed man rubbed the silver ring on his left middle finger and mumbled incantations.Messi took out a short, white wand with a sapphire embedded on its end. The sapphire started glowing with light as he slightly swung it in the air. At the same time, his granddaughter lowered her head and began casting a spell. A lump of steaming green slime slowly formed in front of her.Angele recognized the spell; it was Acid Strike. Angele raised his bow and quickly retreated to the back, aiming at the lion man on the left with the arrow.*ROAR*The lion man roared again and charged toward the red-robed man.\u201cExplosion!\u201d The red-robed man shouted right before the lion\u2019s saber could strike him.A red dot of light appeared in front of him and exploded. An orange flame about the size of a human head smashed against it as it moved through the air.The attack caused the lion man to force itself back, even causing it to become stunned. The red-robed man turned pale as he withdrew; the explosion had been too close to him. The black-robed man came to help immediately and prevented him from falling to the ground.The other lion man started to battle Messi and his granddaughter.The black-robed man made sure that the red-robed man was fine before he turned around. His incantation ceased, and he pointed at the lion man in front. The lion man that had survived the explosion was about to charge toward them, only to be struck with another spell and once again becoming stunned.Angele took this opportunity to shoot an arrow quickly.The arrow struck hard against the lion man\u2019s forehead and penetrated his brain. The attack was accurate and powerful. Blood was dripping down the arrow. The lion man was knocked back and fell to the ground right after. He trembled for several seconds before he stopped breathing.The black-robed man began preparing his next spell after the lion man was killed. He didn\u2019t notice the other lion man jumping toward him, thus he took a hit from the chain hammer it wielded. The severity of this blow caused the man\u2019s eye to roll to the back, blood spitting out of his mouth. This strike most likely broke several of his bones.At that moment, Messi quickly charged toward the back of the lion man and struck him with the palm. The lion man was immediately paralyzed and tumbled down.Messi quickly drew his dagger and stabbed the lion man right in the neck. Streams of blood spurted out of the wound, forming a small pool of blood on the ground.\u201cThis is just the beginning. Stay alert guys. Based on the logs of the other adventurers, guardians will appear randomly, and the creatures they had encountered were completely different. We\u2019ll have to force our way through,\u201d Messi spoke in a grim tone as he stood up.The black-robed man coughed. He was severely injured; it seemed his right arm had been broken by the hammer.\u201cMessi\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you warn me?! You were fighting with that one!\u201d The man questioned in anger.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2026\u201d Messi shrugged.\u201cCome on, stop. We don\u2019t care if you die or not. You should be more careful during the battles.\u201d The red-robed man addressed, seemingly uncaring that the black-robed man helped him during that fight.\u201cYou!\u201d The black-robed man was breathing heavily, trying his best to hold it back.Angele was still checking the surroundings. He nocked another black arrow onto his bow and pulled the bowstring. He was aiming at the pool.\u201cGuys. It\u2019s not a good time to start an argument. We need to deal with this thing first,\u201d he spoke in a low voice.The others stopped talking and looked at the direction his bow was pointing at.A strong naked man slowly emerged out of the pool with water dripping down his body. Although the man looked like an adult male, he had no male genitalia between his legs. Every muscle on his torso was like a work of art. The entirety of his body was covered with a golden glow.The man had no hands. Instead, he had two huge crab claws.His hair was messy, and he was swinging the claws in the air.\u201cIntruders\u2026 Die\u2026\u201d he muttered in Vlasov.*CHI*The golden glow around the man turned into a barrier.\u201cIt\u2019s the Crab Man\u2026 I mean, Claw Warrior! We are in trouble\u2026\u201d Angele knew this creature, causing his expression to change, \u201cAdult Claw Warriors are able to use force fields\u2026\u201d\u201cClaw Warrior\u2026\u201d The others gasped.\u201cWell, shit\u2026\u201d Messi\u2019s face turned pale, \u201cGuys, prepare your most powerful spells and do whatever you can. Otherwise, we won\u2019t be able to leave the garden in one piece.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Manor (1)Translator: Leo Editor: DarkGem/FrappeAngele held the bowstring tightly and aimed at the Claw Warrior. There were tiny, blue light dots flashing in front of his eyes.\"Zero, can you show me the weak point of its force field?\" he mumbled.From his perspective, the Claw Warrior was covered with a blue translucent grid. Rows of data were shown beside its body.\u2018Mission failed. More data required.' Zero reported and stopped analyzing.Angele narrowed his eyes. He turned his head around and tried to search the gate, but it was no longer there. Instead, a gray wall blocked their path.He stepped back and leaned his back against the wall. He wanted to make sure it wasn't just an illusion.The red-robed man was still at the frontlines. Once again, he started rubbing his ring.\"Explosion!\" he shouted.A red light dot appeared in front of him, which quickly expanded into a ball of flame. The red-robed man didn't seem to bother with the sparks, only pushing the fireball forward. It flew toward the Claw Warrior. The speed was slow from Angele's point of view. It was similar to watching someone throw an object.When the fireball successfully caught the Claw Warrior's attention, the red-robed man quickly took out a small glass bottle from his pouch. The bottle was about the size of a finger which contained purple liquid. An explosion occurred right after the red-robed man threw the bottle to the ground.*Crack*Thick smoke from the broken bottle completely pervaded the atmosphere, quickly shrouding everyone's vision.Messi took out a silver dagger and started drawing something on the ground in a slow manner. Many complex patterns were engraved onto the handle of the dagger, but in reality, those were runes mixed with twisted lines. His granddaughter stood by the side with a helpless look, in addition to her feeling nervous.After several seconds, Messi stood up and started mumbling. He quickly disappeared along with his granddaughter. Apart from them, the black-robed man struggled for a while before walking toward the corner of the patio.Angele looked at the corner. There, he saw a small wooden door that had appeared out of nowhere; it was shaking. In but an instant, Angele became the only one left on the patio.\"The hell?\" he knew what the others were planning. They had known Angele not being well-prepared for this, much less having an idea on how to survive such a situation. They wanted to make Angele fight the Claw Warrior first as the bait. If he died, they could then finish off the creature that would already be weakened due to Angele.\"Come with me.\" Angele heard someone whispering from behind.Angele turned back and saw someone reaching out to him. There was a hand at the location Messi and his granddaughter disappeared. Based on the sleeves\u2019 appearance, it was Messi's granddaughter.\"Don't! It's none of your business!\" Messi was shouting.\u2018She's so kind.'Angele smiled, yet he did all but move. It was too late, as the Claw Warrior had already detected him. Moreover, according to the information given by Zero, Angele didn't think he could outrun this creature.\"HA!\" Claw Warrior yelled and raised its claws. The fireball from the red robe was easily blocked and vanished in the air quickly.The Claw Warrior swung its claws in the air several times. It left the pool and charged toward Angele, leaving a wet trail on the ground; its skin was as hard as a metal shell. The Claw Warrior was akin to heavy machinery, causing the ground to start shaking as it ran.Angele released the bowstring and shot the arrow. He turned around and ran toward the other corner without checking if the arrow successfully hit its target. When a wooden door appeared at the corner, he was already running much faster than the black-robed man. Angele quickly took out the enchanted item he had made earlier from his pouch while escaping. He turned around and squeezed the heart-shaped item, aiming at the Claw Warrior.A ray of green flame sprouted out of the middle of the heart and rushed toward it.Angele clearly was doing his utmost in distracting the creature. He turned around again and disappeared after entering the door.*DING*The black arrow struck the Claw Warrior's forehead, yet it didn't even scratch its skin. It dropped to the ground after the momentary contact.Against all odds, however, the green flame pulse had actually scared it. It made the Claw Warrior stop charging; it leaned toward the left, dodging the attack. Yet, this was a chance Angele had caught so he could escape.Some of the green sparks dropped onto the Claw Warrior's skin, creating a noise that sounded like something was being barbecued. Some green smoke rose from the part of the skin that was struck, yet it did no damage.The Claw Warrior had been provoked, but Angele had long disappeared. It roared as it tried to find the next target. The red-robed man had already escaped by entering the same door as the black-robed man. If not for him hiding well within the thick smoke, the Claw Warrior would have long detected him before he could reach the door.Messi and his granddaughter were invisible. They stood there and watched the whole time.\"What now, Grandpa?\" the girl asked, her voice shaky. They already learned that this creature's magic resistance was very high, and it almost completely resisted physical attacks. Its skin was so hard that most weapons could not even scratch it.Messi looked at the door on his right side and then the left. Angele had chosen the left door, while the other two entered using the right door. He gritted his teeth as he hesitated.Another Claw Warrior appeared in the pool. This time, it was a female. Its nipples were covered by two, white shells, and she didn't have any genitalia just like the male one. The female Claw Warrior's body, however, was more balanced and attractive.\"Ah!\" The female Claw Warrior cried, and about seven more Claw Warriors rose from the pool. Some were males and some were females. Their skin was all covered with a golden glow.Messi's time was running out. A female Claw Warrior had already detected their position and it stared at them.\"Move!\" he shouted as he rushed toward the door to the right. They revealed themselves as they moved.However, Messi's granddaughter was rushing toward the door to the left, the one Angele entered. Only after several seconds did they realize they were moving in opposite directions. Messi had forgotten to give clear instructions.\"Grandpa! Here! That young man asked us to follow him!\" the girl yelled nervously.\"He's alone there and he knows nothing about the place! Why!\"Messi hesitated for a second. He was trying to say something else, but the Claw Warriors were charging toward them and they had to move. He waved to his granddaughter before entering the door.The girl's eyes were completely filled with tears. She really wanted to go back, but the Claw Warriors were already fast approaching. She could only turn around quickly and enter through the door ahead of her.*****************Angele went across several bushes and he was still running. He arrived at an abandoned graveyard after entering through the door. There were several white gravestones on the field, each covered in weeds and bushes.\u2018Claw Warriors never act alone, they act in groups.' Angele learned this information from Zero's database.\u2018There were at least four of them. I can probably deal with two.' Angele placed the heart back into the pouch. He had brought three pouches that each contained different items.Angele thought for a while before taking out a small ball from one of the pouches. It looked like a green egg from some creature. It was translucent and had the size of an adult's fist.He told the girl to follow him into the door before leaving the pool. The girl had been kind to him and even tried to help him, so he decided to pay her back. Angele wasn't sure if the girl would trust a stranger, but he did whatever he could.Angele had also checked the statuses of the black-robed man and the red-robed man using the chip before leaving. The red-robed man was a rank 2 Wizard apprentice, and he survived the first wave due to the enchanted ring on his finger. He already triggered its effect twice, so it was unlikely he could trigger it again. The black-robed had been using potions, but his Stamina was low and it didn't seem like he had any enchanted items with him. Angele doubted they could even make it out alive.\u2018If that girl actually listened to my advice and followed me here, I can probably learn some information about this place from her.' Angele jumped over a bush and rolled several times. He had activated Zero's scan function and started waiting.Angele ceased advancing and quietly stayed inside the 2-meter-tall bush. He crouched down and made sure no one could see him.The sky was gray, and the clouds had already thickened. It was probable that it was going to rain.There were some black flies inside the bush and they were flying around Angele.The reason why Angele chose this place was due to those black flies. According to the database, those flies were common in the plains and they weren't poisonous. The environment here was strange and Angele would rather stay in someplace he was familiar with.Angele heard some intense footsteps after a while.Three living beings were approaching his location. One of them sounded nervous, while the other two were completely furious. Angele lowered his body again and asked Zero to mark the targets with blue lines so he didn't have to get out of the bush to check.Based on the shape of their bodies and their footsteps, Angele learned that the girl was being chased by two Claw Warriors.He was about 30 meters away from the door, and it was the only path beside it. The Claw Warriors were catching up the girl as Angele had expected. Their speed, after all, was extremely fast.The footsteps were drawing nearer and nearer. Angele lowered his head and closed his eyes, checking the information sent to him by Zero.He placed his right hand on the dagger's handle and slowly pulled it out of the sheath. The place was silent, and the only things that echoed in the area were the footsteps. Angele calmed down and began focusing on his targets.*Kata-kata*The footsteps finally reached his location.Suddenly, Angele opened his eyes and jumped out of the bush.*CHI*\"AHHH!\" a female Claw Warrior screamed.It placed its claws on one of its eyes; blood was dripping down to the ground.Angele held his dagger in right hand and stood there quietly. There were blue light dots flashing in front of his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
