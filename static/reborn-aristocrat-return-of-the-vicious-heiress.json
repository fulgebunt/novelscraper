When they saw Wen Xinya, they swarmed towards her like bees to honey. There were camera flashes all around. Wen Xinya tried hiding her face with her hands, screaming, \u201cStop\u2026 Stop taking pictures!\u201d\u201cMiss Wen, are you the person in the video clip that went viral on the internet?\u201d\u201cMiss Wen, is it true that your enemies\u2019 retaliation has caused you to lead a wandering life not long after you were born? It was said that you started swindling and stealing at five-years-old, haunted the streets as a thug at ten-years-old, and had affairs with many different men when you were fifteen-years-old. Is it true?\u201d\u201cMiss Wen, someone said your unruly behavior continued after you returned to the Wen Family, and even got addicted to drugs. How long have you been taking drugs?\u201d\u201cMiss Wen, please answer our questions\u2026\u201dFinally, Wen Xinya got away from the reporters, exhausted. She came into the living room of the mansion. There was her stepmother Ning Shuqian, her stepsister Wen Yuya, and Xia Ruya, who had replaced and took away everything from Wen Xinya during the 15 years of her disappearance.Wen Xinya looked anxious. She frantically asked, \u201cWhere is Grandpa? I want to see Grandpa.\u201d\u201cYour Grandpa has already made the announcement to sever all ties between the Wen Family and you. You no longer belong to the Wen Family, and he will never see you again,\u201d said Ning Shuqian with a cold smile and evil look in her eyes.Wen Xinya looked dejected. She unconsciously shook her head and mumbled to herself, \u201cNo\u2026 No way! Grandpa would never treat me like this. I am the eldest daughter, the only descendant of the Wen Family and the only rightful heir. He would not do this to me\u2026\u201dSuddenly, she froze her stumbling body and yelled at Ning Shuqian, \u201cGrandpa would not do this to me. You\u2019re lying! You must be lying, slut!\u201dNing Shuqian walked to Wen Xinya and stood in front of her with a look of contempt on her face. She said with a sarcastic smile, \u201cYour video clip is still being circulated on the internet. You are a loose woman, and your actions have caused much disgrace to the family. What a cheap slut!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wen Xinya stared at Ning Shuqian with her eyes wide open. She felt like slapping Ning Shuqian hard on her face.Wen Yuya stepped in between them to defend Ning Shuqian. She caught Wen Xinya by the wrist and gave her a vicious look.\u201cYou are one poor and pitiful stupid wretch. Who are you to act snobbishly here?\u201d Wen Yuya said coldly.Boom!To Wen Xinya it felt like something had snapped within her.\u201cKeep quiet! You have no right to talk to me like that. You set me up and caused me to become what I am today.\u201dNot long after Wen Xinya had just returned to the Wen Family at age 15 she was coaxed to a bar, where she was then drugged and raped. There were even photographs taken of her indecent acts.The entire Wen Family came to know about it. Grandpa was extremely disappointed in her, Grandma loathed her, Wen Haowen reproved her, and even the servants despised her.At age 18, she was kidnapped and had a large amount of liquid drug injected into her body. This was how she got her drug addiction. She had tried almost all methods within her means to quit on drugs, but failed at every attempt as there was always someone trying to intervene. In the end, she gave up quitting as her drug addiction became stronger and started to sink into a life of utter depravity.She was forced to give up her dreams of pursuing jewelry design.The man she loved so dearly had also left her\u2026***Scenes from the past started to appear before her. Her heart was filled with hatred, and it devoured her mind every day and night. She worked hard to give up on her drug addiction, behaving like a walking corpse and struggling with every breath to survive. Her only goal was to have her\u2026Revenge!What a pity! Her plan for revenge had just started, but it was intercepted and she felt too weak to carry on.From spiking her drink to capturing her on video with a few disgusting men and having the video published on the internet, it was meticulously planned to set her up. The objective was to turn Wen Xinya into a loose woman and destroy her reputation so that she would be condemned by everyone, including the Wen Family.Wen Yuya smiled radiantly. She looked as if she was a beautiful carnivorous flower opening a mouth full of saw-like teeth, waiting to devour Wen Xinya anytime.\u201cDo you know who spiked your drink not long ago, captured you on video with a few other men and had it published on the internet, causing your reputation to go down the drain?\u201d asked Wen Yuya.\u201cWho could it be?\u201d Wen Xinya thought as she slowly closed her eyes. The voices sounded as cold as the howling of the devils from hell.She could feel her back shivering with hatred. The three people in front of her became the greatest villains of her life, waiting for her final judgment.How could she not be aware of their acts?But it did not make any difference.She was alone, without any influence or power. There was little she could do to challenge them!\u201cIt was me!\u201d exclaimed Xia Ruya as she walked gracefully towards them.Her movements were very elegant, and she looked even more distinguished than usual.Wen Xinya watched Xia Ruya as she moved trippingly like a butterfly. Her actions were classy and refined. She wore a pink dress and had a slender silhouette of her back that resembled a stalk of a beautiful pink lotus.She had beautiful features, comparable to the delicacy of a pink lotus. As perfect and spotless as she was, her eyes seemed to reveal traces of devilish enchantment.The dew-like pupils in her eyes reflected Wen Xinya\u2019s embarrassment, insanity, and ugliness as she held a disdainful attitude towards her.In contrast to her own elegance, Xia Ruya despised her uncouth behavior and felt that Wen Xinya was pitiful, unfortunate, and ridiculous\u2026Wen Xinya started laughing out loud. \u201cHa Ha Ha\u2026\u201d She had a scrawny face caused by years of drug abuse.\u201cEveryone said Xia Ruya is a pure, kind-hearted and elegant lady. I think you are just a devil covered in human skin. You are ugly, greedy, disgusting, dirty\u2026\u201d she said with a devilish fierce look on her face.This was her life, filled with drama and tragedy.Wen Xinya was born with a silver spoon in her mouth and was supposed to be the rightful heir to the family\u2019s wealth and privilege. But with a twist of fate, she had led a wandering life for 15 years enduring the bitterness of life.Finally, when she was found and returned home, it turned out that she became the shame of the family.On the other hand, what about Xia Ruya?She was an illegitimate daughter who had replaced Wen Xinya and took away all that had rightfully belonged to her\u2014identity, status, education, and kinships.Xia Ruya gave her a cold look and said, \u201cYou have failed to live up to our expectations. It wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201dWen Xinya gave a perfunctory smile. \u201cHehe\u2026\u201d She replied in an eerily cold voice, \u201cFor all that you have done, the objective was to cut my ties with the Wen Family as the heir so that you could inherit all of the Wen Family\u2019s wealth. Now you have finally achieved your goal!\u201dShe thought she was unable to accept an outcome like this. But she realized she was able to stay calmer than she would have thought. It had been 10 years and she was exhausted\u2026Suddenly, she started losing consciousness. That familiar feeling of utter misery returned to attack her, and it felt like her heart was being ripped apart. The pain was so intense that she started to have difficulty breathing. Her body was trembling with a total loss of dignity.Lying on the floor with her body curled up, Wen Xinya saw flashbacks of a scene where she was brought back to the Wen Family 10 years ago. There she was standing in the majestic living room, feeling a great sense of pride and with a confident look on her face, she told herself, \u201cZhang Xiaolan, go for it! One day you will become a worthy descendant of a prestigious family.\u201dSoon afterward, she saw Xia Ruya who took everything that originally belonged to her.Xia Ruya was honorable, she was unrefined.Xia Ruya was elegant, she was insignificant.Xia Ruya was pure, she was immoral.Xia Ruya was kind-hearted, she was evil.Xia Ruya was a princess of the Wen Family, she was the shame of the Wen Family.There she was, frequently being compared with Xia Ruya.She finally understood it wasn\u2019t easy to be part of an aristocratic family. Returning to the Wen Family made her feel like she was falling into another trap. She was constantly being framed, slandered, despised\u2026She should have had it all: kinship, attention and being doted on. But now she had to work hard and fight for what should have belonged to her. Without any recognition for her efforts, she wasn\u2019t accepted no matter how hard she tried. This pushed her into greater despair and hopelessness.It had been 10 years, had her struggles finally come to an end?Ning Shuqian appeared before her and pinched her cheek so hard that it forced Wen Xinya to look back at her. Ning Shuqian said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t my fault. If you must, blame it on your fate that you are Mo Yunyao\u2019s daughter. What is so good about that Mo Yunyao bitch? Why is everyone making comparisons between us? Haha\u2026 I just can\u2019t stand it! As outstanding as she was, I will make her daughter her greatest humiliation. Her daughter\u2019s life shall be ruined by drug-abuse, alcohol, fights, adultery, hahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cI will not forgive you for insulting my Mother!\u201d said Wen Xinya as she pounced on Ning Shuqian. Both of them fell to the ground. She had bitten on Ning Shuqian\u2019s ear as hard as she could, not aware of how much strength she had used. There was a bloody taste in her mouth as a loud moan of pain rang in her ears.Still dazed, she could feel someone pulling her away with extreme strength, and then she was beaten up viciously.Xia Ruya bent down in front of her and said gently, \u201cOh I almost forgot to inform you that Jingnan and I are getting married soon. We will have the most magnificent wedding ceremony. Xinya\u2026 do give me your blessing!\u201d\u201cJing\u2026 Jingnan!\u201d Wen Xinya immediately remembered that handsome, young man who had already become Xia Ruya\u2019s fianc\u00e9.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUsing a gentle voice that was as calming as the heavenly sound of nature, Xia Ruya said, \u201cXinya, I am grateful to you. You know, I took over everything that used to be rightfully yours. Please be assured that I will continue to live a blessed life, and enjoy all the happiness on your behalf\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Xia Ruya took a syringe and stabbed it into Wen Xinya\u2019s arm. She said, \u201cPlease\u2026 rest in peace! Remember to bless Jingnan and me from heaven.\u201dAs the drug entered Wen Xinya\u2019s bloodstream, she started losing consciousness. The chandelier in the hallway seemed to become a rainbow as it colored her eyes. With her last breath, she clenched her teeth and shouted, \u201cYou have destroyed my life, I will come back to haunt you even if I die\u2026\u201dOn this day, the eldest daughter of the Wen Family was pronounced dead due to a drug overdose.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

She unmindfully pressed her hands against her forehead and could feel the numbing effects of alcohol gushing into her brain. After jolting her head twice with great strength, she started to regain some consciousness. As if she was in a nightmare, her entire world was being torn apart between the deafening DJ music in a devilish beat and the flickering disco light.Her head was heavy with dizziness, and she could feel her stomach cramping. Covering her mouth with her hands, she dashed into the public washroom like a madwoman and threw up all the food inside her together with some gastric fluid and bile. Feeling much better after, Wen Xinya turned on the tap and splashed the running water onto her face, trying to keep herself awake.Feeling refreshed, a question sprung to her mind\u2014wasn\u2019t she already dead?Raising her head slowly from the basin, she could see a pretty, young face from the reflection in the mirror. It was not covered in thick layers of cosmetics. No eye bags or eye rings could be found beneath the pair of beautiful eyes. The pair of eyes had sparkles and brightness in them, instead of being dull and colorless caused by long-term alcohol abuse. There was also a waist length of soft, silky hair attached to the pretty face, rather than a set of bright red spiky hair.It was like time had been reversed and everything was back to the beginning!Wen Xinya touched her face with trembling hands. The baby-soft skin on her face belonged to a young teenage girl.She darted out of the washroom recklessly. Seeing a waiter passing by with a tray in his hands, she grabbed him by the arm and asked, \u201cWhich year are we in right now? What is the date today?\u201dThe waiter looked at her with his eyes wide open as if she was a lunatic, and replied, \u201cMarch 28, 2010.\u201dYear 2010, it was the year she returned to the Wen Family at age 15!Did she just experience a rebirth and went back to the year when she turned 15?Wen Xinya couldn\u2019t believe it. She ran dementedly into the crowd, grabbed a woman on the dance floor, and asked, \u201cWhich year are we in right now? What is the date today?\u201dThe woman pushed her hands away and said, \u201cLunatic. Today, March 28, 2010.\u201dAgain, it was March 28, 2010.\u201cWhich year are we in right now? What is the date today?\u201d\u201cWhich year are we in right now? What is the date today?\u201dWen Xinya kept on asking anyone she could find. People in the club treated her as if she was a madwoman and shunned her away wherever she went.Indeed! She just had a rebirth and returned to the year when she was fifteen-years-old.She had not lost her virginity underage, no drug abuse, and no spiked drinks that caused her to be caught on video acting indecently. The tragedy had not yet begun.Wen Xinya felt enormous youth and power in her younger body. It was a feeling she had not experienced in 10 years! She smiled and cried with joy. Thank God she was able to return to when she was a 15-year-old. She was going to have a second chance. She decided she would live on her own terms.While Wen Xinya was still in her own thoughts, she vaguely saw a man walking away from the crowd towards her. She stared at him with her eyes wide open. She would recognize this man even if he turned into ashes.It was him\u2026 who destroyed her life and caused her to suffer 10 years of agony!She recalled that today was the day when Xia Ruya visited Grandpa and Grandma at the Wen Family. The whole family was happy at her presence and surrounded her, while Wen Xinya hid in her own shadows with envy and jealousy as if she had stolen someone else\u2019s happiness.Xia Ruya was elegant while Wen Xinya was unrefined. She couldn\u2019t help but feel ashamed of her own inferiority.When Wen Xinya chanced upon Xia Ruya in the garden afterward, her uncouth behavior complementing Xia Ruya\u2019s elegance.Xia Ruya even humiliated her. \u201cYou are just a little sparrow, don\u2019t even dream of becoming a phoenix.\u201dAs a 15-year-old teenage girl, Wen Xinya was rebellious and impulsive. She never tolerated any insult. She lost her cool and fought Xia Ruya, accidentally causing Xia Ruya to fall into the water. The servants saw what happened and the news quickly spread to the rest of the Wen Family. Grandpa reprimanded her for being rebellious. Grandma blamed her for being vicious. Father regretted having her as a daughter.Wen Xinya used her ruthlessness to complement Xia Ruya\u2019s elegance.At the same time, Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya showed concern toward her. The 15-year-old Wen Xinya was innocent and naive. She was immensely touched by their kindness. Soon after, when her stepsister Wen Yuya brought her to a bar for relaxation, it was then that Wen Xinya got drunk and lost her virginity.The man took nude pictures of her and blackmailed her for 5 hundred thousand dollars. She had just returned to the Wen Family at that time and did not have that much money. In the end, Grandpa and Grandma got to know about this matter. Grandpa was disappointed in her, and Grandma felt disgusted.That man in the bar suddenly grabbed Wen Xinya from the back and said, \u201cHey Hey! Young girl, how much for a night? Let\u2019s go! Follow me and let\u2019s have some fun. I promise I\u2019ll make you extremely happy as if you\u2019re in the seventh heaven.\u201d The man\u2019s lips landed on the back of her ears, trying to kiss and sniff her. He had a strong smell of alcohol mixed with body odor, making her feel sick.There was a burning hatred within Wen Xinya. She had red bloodshot eyes from drinking too much alcohol. With a ferocious burst of energy, she reached to her waist and grabbed the man\u2019s hand by one of his fingers and swang it downwards forcefully.The man let out a loud cry of pain. \u201cArgh!\u201d But it was soon covered by the thunderous DJ music.Wen Xinya followed up with a back kick, causing the man to fall to the ground. Putting one leg in between the man\u2019s thighs, she gave a cold smile and threatened. \u201cIf you want to court death, I shall grant your wish. I\u2019ll let you experience what \u2018crotch pain\u2019 means.\u201dFeeling the increasing pressure between his thighs, the man immediately became sober. His face turned pale with fear, perspiring profusely on his forehead. Realizing he was dealing with an overbearing, intractable girl, he quickly pleaded for mercy. \u201cI\u2026 I won\u2019t dare do it again\u2026 Please let me go\u2026\u201dWen Xinya knew she had caused the man to have urinary incontinence when she noticed that the middle of his pants became wet. She turned her leg with force and heard the man cry in deep pain. With such a level of strength, the man was unlikely able to create further harm to other women in the future.With his hands covering his groin, the man rolled on the floor in pain. He screamed, \u201cBitch, I will not let you off! I\u2019m going to sue you for this.\u201dWen Xinya bent over, pinched his face, and said with a cold smile, \u201cI did this as a form of defense. It\u2019s just too bad that I couldn\u2019t control my leg\u2019s strength. But are you\u2026 able to go through the investigation? You\u2019d better not take any chances!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe man had finally understood that he was facing an intractable young girl. Now he couldn\u2019t help but hate the person who had sent him those anonymous photographs and messages.Wen Xinya moved closer and said in a harsh tone, \u201cI don\u2019t care what Ning Shuqian, Xia Ruya, and Wen Yuya have instructed you to do to me, but remember the one who\u2019s right in front of you now. You\u2019d better learn your lesson and avoid me whenever you see me later, and then I might just let you go.\u201d\u201cMy dear Missus, please let me go. It was my fault offending you. I will not dare to do it ever again.\u201d The man pleaded bitterly. The sharp pain between his legs made it difficult for him to be rational, but he was able to regain awareness and abruptly recalled the name of these three people. It must have been them who sent him the anonymous messages, informing him where he could find a woman for pleasure and telling him to blackmail her with nude pictures. Otherwise, he would not have met with this nemesis.At last, she would be able to take revenge for what happened to her in her previous lifetime. Wen Xinya\u2019s sorrow started to disappear as her eyes burned with hatred. Memories of the moments before her death came flooding back to her and paused right at the scene of her last breath. She clenched her fists so hard that the joints on her fingers turned colorless. Her nails pierced through her palms until they turned bloody. She decided she would not let go of those who had done her wrong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Wen Family\u2019s old mansion was built with a lavish European-style structure, mixed with an internal Chinese-style courtyard. This type of mansion was unique and was a popular topic to talk about in the capital city.Wen Xinya could recall clearly when she was brought back to the Wen Family in her previous life, she was deeply amazed by how grand and majestic the mansion appeared to be. During that time she was inspired and motivated, and yet at the same time felt worried and doubtful. She questioned herself repeatedly if this was really going to be her future home.However, little did she expect that the Wen Family members were keeping watchful eyes on her. Materialistic\u2014this was the first impression she had given to the Wen Family. They felt disgraced by such behavior. From then onwards, no matter how hard she tried, it was difficult to change their perspective of her.Wen Xinya arrived back home at eight-thirty sharp. She grinned with satisfaction as she was back just in time when she saw the clock.Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya were sitting in the living room. They were shocked to see her.Unable to suppress her astonishment, Wen Yuya asked, \u201cWhy\u2026 Why are you back so early?\u201dShe certainly remembered she had made Wen Xinya drink till she was dead drunk. Shouldn\u2019t she be in one of the private rooms in Black Sunday being violated and having her nude pictures taken? Why was she back so early?Wen Xinya coldly smirked. \u201cYou are not being nice, Sister. You brought me to Black Sunday and left me there alone. Luckily, I got sober just in time. It\u2019s hard to imagine what could have happened at such a sleazy place!\u201dWen Yuya stared with eyes wide open, not expecting Wen Xinya to respond in this manner. She exclaimed, \u201cNonsense! How could I have brought you to such a sleazy place like Black Sunday? Don\u2019t malign me!\u201d\u201cSister, you know what kind of place Black Sunday is?\u201d asked Wen Xinya without expression.Wen Yuya was tongue-tied. Glaring at Wen Xinya, she said angrily, \u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense! How could I possibly know what kind of place Black Sunday is?\u201dJust with a few words, she got Wen Yuya trapped. Wen Xinya stood there quietly, calm like a viburnum tree, filled with confidence. Her face was fair and smooth just like a viburnum flower, magnificent and enchanting, radiant and elegant. She looked as pure as the white snow.She was stunning and mesmerizing in white!Is this the cowardly, inferior and stupid Wen Xinya?Ning Shuqian instantly noticed she was a changed person.Could it be the personality traits of descendants from a scholar family? Even though she had been leading a wandering life on the streets at a young age, her uncouth behavior was unable to match her elegant and classy characteristics.Ning Shuqian instantly diverted her thoughts. She brought a warm smile to her face and asked tenderly, \u201cXinya, it\u2019s late. Are you hungry? Shall I get the servants to prepare some food for you?\u201dThough at the age of 35, Ning Shuqian was glowing with a beautiful and flawless complexion. The few fine lines at the corner of her eyes were like beautiful extensions from her willow leaf-shaped eyebrows. There were almost no traces of age on her charming and seductive face.It was no wonder Father was attracted to this bewitching woman and had an affair with her while Wen Xinya\u2019s Mother was pregnant with her. Within six months from her Mother\u2019s death by dystocia, Father had remarried Ning Shuqian, who brought into the Wen Family her own child who was two months younger than Wen Xinya.Wen Xinya remembered how she used to be easily deceived by Ning Shuqian\u2019s caring and warm character. She drooped her head slightly, attempting to conceal the hatred in her eyes. \u201cAunt Ning, I am not feeling well and do not have any appetite,\u201d she said while raising her head with a sincere smile on her face.Seeing her innocence again, it was just like the same Wen Xinya that she knew. Ning Shuqian thought she was probably overly worried. \u201cOh, you are unwell. Do you need me to fetch the family doctor for you?\u201d she asked.Wen Xinya shook her head and responded, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I probably had too much alcohol just now. I think I should be fine after some rest.\u201dNing Shuqian gave a sigh of relief. She said with a broad smile on her face, \u201cI\u2019m glad you are fine. You smell of alcohol. If Grandpa and Grandma find out, they will not be happy about it.\u201dWen Xinya used to feel that these words from Ning Shuqian were words of concern. But after her rebirth, she saw through Ning Shuqian\u2019s ulterior motive. She must be afraid of Grandpa finding out that Wen Yuya brought Wen Xinya to Black Sunday. She also knew that Wen Xinya would want to get into Grandpa and Grandma\u2019s good books and not make them upset. Therefore, by putting it to her this way, Wen Xinya would definitely not mention this incident to Grandpa and Grandma.Wen Xinya looked anxious and worried. Noticing how easily shaken she was and how she lacked the charisma of an affluent family\u2019s daughter, Ning Shuqian felt at ease. \u201cI don\u2019t know what sort of place is Black Sunday, but it surely doesn\u2019t sound like a nice place. In our circle of life, there are no boundaries on how we should enjoy ourselves or where we should have fun. Most importantly, Grandpa and Grandma must not find out about this incident.\u201d she said with a sense of sarcasm.Wen Xinya acknowledged. \u201cAunt Ning, I understand. Thank you for reminding me!\u201d It sounded like a gentle reminder earlier, but now it surely served as a stern warning. This was what Ning Shuqian was capable of. She could make a warning sound like a moving speech.Wen Xinya had been wandering on the streets at a very young age. She had lost all the opportunities to learn the good qualities a girl from a respectable family should possess\u2014charisma, virtue, education and values. She did not even know how she should behave as a daughter from an affluent family. Ning Shuqian had been trying to mislead her by saying words like \u201cthere are no boundaries on how and where she could have fun\u201d.Ning Shuqian saw her obedience. She held Wen Xinya\u2019s hands and said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you know. You just returned to the Wen Family and are not familiar with many things from around here. Grandpa and Grandma are old, I do not wish to see you agitating them with any of your bad behaviors. It wasn\u2019t easy for you to reunite with the Wen Family. It could be daunting to constantly be worried for the children. Let\u2019s not trouble them with all these unnecessary matters.\u201dWen Xinya looked like she only had a hazy notion of Aunt Ning\u2019s words. She said with her eyes wide open, \u201cAunt Ning, I understand that Grandpa and Grandma have spent a great deal of time and effort to look for me. I will not let them down.\u201dWen Xinya smirked. Previously, she had said the same thing. And that was the reason why she had tried to hide the unhappy incidents from Grandpa and Grandma and dealt with them all by herself. In the end, she was mistaken by everyone in the Wen Family and was unable to seek any understanding nor praises no matter how hard she tried.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing Shuqian looked extremely satisfied. \u201cI\u2019m glad that you understand. You just returned to Wen Family, so approach me for any matters if you need,\u201d she assured.Wen Xinya smiled back and answered gratefully, \u201cThank you, Aunt Ning!\u201d\u201cPromptly return to your room and have a good rest since you are not feeling well. Wake up early tomorrow morning for breakfast with Grandpa and Grandma. This is one of the traditions of the Wen Family.\u201d Ning Shuqian told her in a gentle tone.Wen Xinya left the living room after wishing both Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya goodnight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She strolled leisurely in the courtyard at the back of the Wen Family\u2019s old mansion. In the courtyard, there was a viburnum tree with branches evenly spread apart. It looked spectacular. It was a warm spring season this year, and the pure white flowers had already started appearing on the branches before the arrival of summer. The petals swayed gracefully under the mild breeze, resembling dancing butterflies. It was a magnificent view.Upon her return to the Wen Family, she fell in love at first sight by the romantic ambiance created by this viburnum tree. When given a choice to which room she would like to stay in, she told Grandpa she wanted a room closest to this tree.At this moment, the night breeze blew on her face, still warm from the booze she had earlier. It was an indescribable feeling of comfort.She took a deep breath and noticed the mild fragrance of the viburnum flowers that greeted her nose. It helped her to instantly calm her raging heart that was full of vengeance.How long had it been since the last time she enjoyed the pleasant night breeze?It had been 10 years!That\u2019s right! It was 10 years ago when she returned to the Wen Family for the first time. And then experienced death by heart failure at age 25 when Wen Ruya injected a high dosage of drugs into her body. It had been 10 years of suffering where she lived in someone else\u2019s shadow. She was always at the mercy of others and constantly being plotted against, causing her to fall into despair.Wen Xinya opened her arms and raised her head. Looking at the sky, she thought to herself:I am back. Are you ready?\u201cWhere did you go? Why did you come back so late?\u201dIt was a deep, stern voice, sounding cold and harsh. Wen Xinya froze. She stood right at the same position, feeling stiff. She did not even have the courage to turn her head! This was the old man who cared about her, and he was also the one who gave up on her in her previous life.Old Mr. Wen said, \u201cYou have just returned to the Wen Family. You\u2019d better stay at home and not loiter away. The media has their attention focused on you now. You have to watch your behavior carefully and not act as you wish like last time.\u201d There was disapproval in his voice. He knew about Wen Xinya\u2019s shameful past but had insisted to fetch her back to the Wen Family on account that Wen Xinya was his descendant. After all, he could not bear to see her continue living astray. Little did he expect that Wen Xinya had not changed for the better and was disappointed in her when he found out she pushed Ruya into the water.Wen Xinya gently wiped the tears in her eyes and turned slowly towards him, acknowledging. \u201cYes, Grandpa, I know. I will stay at home more often from now onwards.\u201dOld Mr. Wen walked towards her. He frowned when he detected a strong smell of alcohol from afar. He warned. \u201cYou have no excuse to get drunk no matter what happened. You are no longer the Zhang Xiaolan who used to lead a thug life, but the prestigious Miss Wen Xinya of the Wen Family. I do not care if you are able to adapt to your current lifestyle, but you need to learn how to behave like the descendant of an affluent family.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, how should the descendant of an affluent family behave? Is it just like how Xia Ruya behaves?\u201d Wen Xinya asked Grandpa in a soft tone, with a strong feeling of being wronged.She had just returned to the Wen Family and never had the opportunity to live with Grandpa. On the other hand, though Xia Ruya was adopted, she had been living with Grandpa for 20 years and therefore had a closer relationship with him. Wen Xinya hoped Grandpa would realize who was the genuine eldest daughter of the Wen Family.Old Mr. Wen was at a loss for words. He had just recognized the fact that Wen Xinya had lived a stray life for the past 15 years, unlike Ruya who had the opportunity to learn the virtues and values of being part of an affluent family.Looking at the speechless old Mr. Wen, Wen Xinya lowered her head, pulling the edge of her skirt sadly. She said, \u201cGrandpa, am I a disgrace to the Wen Family? Do you regret fetching me back?\u201d There was anxiousness on her face when she continued, \u201cI did not push Ruya into the water deliberately. Please believe me, Grandpa, it wasn\u2019t deliberate. Please don\u2019t send me away\u2026\u201dOld Mr. Wen frowned deeply and said, \u201cWhen did I say I wanted to send you away? You are the eldest daughter of the Wen Family. Now that you are back home I have no intention to send you away.\u201dWen Xinya mustered her courage. Looking at Grandpa, she said, \u201cBut Grandpa, I don\u2019t know what I should do to be like Xia Ruya. Does it really not matter?\u201dOld Mr. Wen got angrier. He said, \u201cYou and Ruya are different, do not compare yourself with her. She stayed in the Wen Family at a very young age and have had a very different upbringing than you. You just came back, thus you will have to start learning from scratch.\u201dWen Xinya started sobbing and felt sorry for herself. She replied, \u201cEveryone has been comparing me with Xia Ruya, feeling that I am uncouth and lack her good virtues.\u201dIn this lifetime, she had made up her mind not to be compared with Xia Ruya anymore. She would go all out to create better opportunities for herself. From now onwards, she wanted her Grandpa to be full of compassion for her and stand by her side.Old Mr. Wen recalled the scene where Xia Ruya came to visit the family. Everyone surrounded her, happy to see her. While Wen Xinya was hiding in a corner, feeling envious. He had chosen to act as if nothing had happened. Now, he felt sorry about this incident, and told her, \u201cYou just returned to the Wen Family and have not adapted yet. Soon I\u2019ll get a teacher to teach you all about etiquette.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes lit up with excitement and happiness. She asked, \u201cGrandpa, do you mean that I will have the opportunity to learn and work on skills like social etiquette, social dancing, wear high heels and red wine tasting?\u201d\u201cYup, and a lot more\u2026\u201d replied old Mr. Wen. He suddenly had mixed feelings. Having been away for 15 years, Wen Xinya had lost all the time and love she would have with the family. She should have been given the right education and the chance to learn about good virtues. Old Mr. Wen realized his impatience. He had neglected the child\u2019s feelings by wanting her to act by his standards without giving her more time to learn.After hearing this, Wen Xinya had a sparkle in her eyes. She said happily, \u201cGrandpa, please be assured, I will put in my best effort to learn these skills. I will become the prestigious Wen Family\u2019s daughter and not let you down.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe young girl glowed with determination. She was wearing a red dress that did not fit her. The dress was too tight for her hips, and too long for her height. It made her look extremely weak and small. Old Mr. Wen recollected this was the dress Ning Shuqian had recently bought from France as a present for Ruya. Ruya only wore it only twice and did not wear it again. He did not expect this dress to end up with his precious granddaughter.It had been almost five days since Wen Xinya returned home and she did not even have clothes that belonged to her! The Wen Family had truly neglected her. It was hard to blame her for her actions today.She was his genuine granddaughter and the Wen Family\u2019s eldest daughter! Old Mr. Wen realized he had not been a good Grandpa.Wen Xinya felt a sense of hope. She just returned to the Wen Family, and Grandpa\u2019s attitude towards her would determine her status in the family. She knew she could not behave too aggressively or show her determination to fight for Grandpa\u2019s attention. Either way, she would easily be compared to Xia Ruya. If she remained calm and innocent, she would be able to get everyone\u2019s acceptance easily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Family (Part 1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5: Family (Part 1)Atlas StudiosThe orange and red sunlight of the early morning arrived with clouds of mist, causing the viburnum tree from outside the windows to pass through the light blue screenings, infiltrating the bedroom. The light, warm yellow shadows brought rays of soft light.With a rare good night\u2019s sleep, Wen Xinya sat up in her bed and stretched. Getting up, she walked to the window and opened the light blue colored screenings. A branch of viburnum flowers peeked out. All she had to do was stretch her arm and touch it.The morning was slightly cold, and the viburnum flowers outside the window were in full bloom, inviting Xinya with the slightly cold moisture in the surrounding atmosphere. The warm sun refracted brightly and beautifully.Today would be a wonderful day!With that thought in mind, she turned and went to the bathroom to wash up. She changed into a white gown, which was left behind by Xia Ruya. Xia Ruya was dressed and fed like royalty, so even at 15 years old, she was already 163 centimeters tall. Even the growth of her body had good proportions. Unlike Xinya, who was starved as a child and grew up to be only 158 centimeters tall. With a skinny body, her growth could not be considered great. Wearing Xia Ruya\u2019s clothes was really not a good fit for her.When she first arrived in the Wen Family, she was mesmerized by the variety of beautiful clothes in the wardrobe and did not care about whether they fit her. Hence, the Wen Family did not think that she needed new, fitting clothes.However, now, she would not be moved like she was in the past. Whatever belonged to her, she would fiercely fight for it!As she arrived in the living room, Grandpa and Father were reading the newspaper, Grandma was talking to Ning Shuqian, and Wen Yuya was happily playing games on her phone. Xinya smiled and greeted, \u201cGrandpa, Grandma, good morning! Father, Aunt Ning, good morning! Sister Yu, good morning!\u201dGrandpa put down the newspaper, glanced at the dress that did not fit her and frowned. He then gently asked, \u201cDid you sleep well last night?\u201d\u201cI slept well!\u201d As Wen Xinya caught sight of his tightly knitted brows, she lowered her head to inspect herself. Then, she cowardly went to sit next to Wen Yuya.Grandpa nodded and returned to his newspaper.Grandma only glanced at her once, then returned to talking with Ning Shuqing.Ning Shuqing smiled towards her then turned away.Only Wen Yuya kept her head down, playing games on her phone, acting as though Wen Xinya did not exist.Wen Xinya did not mind either.However, Grandpa frowned. He put down the newspaper in his hands and shouted, \u201cDid you not hear your older sister greet you? Did you feed the manners you were taught to the dog?\u201dPa!Grandpa\u2019s cold words scared Wen Yuya until she turned white and dropped her phone on the floor.Although Grandma did not seem to like Wen Xinya much, Xinya was still the Wen family\u2019s blood and kin. Grandma could not stand the ignorance of a towing oil bottle. \u201cThe Wen family has raised you for many years, even changing your surname. When you see the eldest daughter of the Wen Family, it would not be too unreasonable to greet her, would it!\u201dWen Yuya felt wronged deep inside. Why should she greet this uncouth sl*t? Before Wen Xinya returned to the Wen Family, though Grandma did not treat her cheerfully, at least Grandma would not give her looks of disapproval. Grandpa did not interact with her much, but he would never have scolded her. Ever since the return of Wen Xinya, everything changed.Ning Shuqing was shocked and hurried to say something. \u201cFather! Mother! It\u2019s Yuya\u2019s fault. Xinya just returned to the Wen Family, so she might not be used to it yet. I\u2019ll lecture her later.\u201d She then turned towards Wen Xinya with an apologetic expression. \u201cXinya, your sister is still young and immature. Please do not mind her insensitivity. Aunt Ning apologizes to you.\u201dWen Xinya was uneasy. \u201cAunt Ning, have I done something wrong? Is that why sister is ignoring me on purpose? Was it because of last night\u2026\u201dA piercing glare landed on her and caused Wen Xinya to immediately stop talking. As she slowly looked towards Ning Shuqing, her gaze immediately softened. If she were to look closely, she could see the deeply hidden warning in Ning Shuqing\u2019s eyes.At this moment, Ning Shuqing softly said, \u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense! Yesterday you were not happy, but she still brought you out to have some fun, didn\u2019t she?\u201d She then pulled Wen Yuya and sternly said, \u201cGreet your sister!\u201dWen Yuya did not expect her own mother to stand on the side of this sl*t. Still feeling wronged, she bowed her head and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sister!\u201dWen Haowen put down his newspaper and said, \u201cAlright! We are all family, there\u2019s no need to be so fussy.\u201dDespite saying that, he glanced sideways at Wen Xinya, his eyes bringing a hint of warning.Wen Xinya acted like she did not see it.Grandpa knitted his brows and glanced at Wen Yuya, then shifted his glance towards Ning Shuqing. His stern glare brought a hint of coldness. \u201cYou joined the Wen Family for 15 years, but not only did you not expand the family, but you are also unfilial. At this point, I can only hope that you put all your efforts into taking care of Xinya. After all, she is the Wen Family\u2019s only heir.\u201dGrandpa\u2019s words were stern, causing Ning Shuqing\u2019s face to turn white. She forced herself to keep her smile. \u201cFather, since Xinya returned, I treated her like she was my own daughter. If you do not believe me, you can ask Haowen.\u201dWen Haowen glanced at his wife, whose face was white with a grievance. Those eyes of hers that held autumn\u2019s water seemed to be brimming with tears, brightening with every passing second. She had an enchanting, flirtatious feeling, and he felt the heat of his own passion. \u201cFather, even though she did not give the Wen family an heir, ever since Shuqing married into our family, she gave her best effort into taking care of you and Mother. She\u2019s been taking care of Xinya wholeheartedly since Xinya returned. How could you speak to her like that!\u201dGoing against him in front of the whole family made Grandpa livid with rage. \u201cScoundrel! You\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGrandma saw that both father and son were about to quarrel, so she quickly stepped in. \u201cAlright, Haowen, your father is getting old, so don\u2019t provoke him.\u201d She also saw that Ning Shuqing\u2019s eyes were filled with indignation. \u201cShuqing, don\u2019t you know to diffuse the situation, seeing that Haowen went against his father for you?\u201d Then, Grandma lowered her voice to pacify Grandpa. \u201cOld Wen, you are already old. Where are you getting this temper from? Be careful of your health.\u201dGrandpa shot Ning Shuqing a meaningful glance. \u201cAfter eating, bring Xinya to buy some fitting clothing and let her dress up a little. She has been back for a week already but is still wearing Ruya\u2019s clothes. Their figures are different, so wearing Ruya\u2019s clothes are not a fit for her. I thought you, as her stepmother, would have thought of it. I never thought this old man would have to point it out.\u201dObviously an insult, Wen Haowen reddened, and then he glanced at Wen Xinya. He only now realized that her dress was too big for her, as he then pretended to cough and hardened his face. \u201cFather is right. This is your mistake as a stepmother. Later, keep Ruya\u2019s belongings in a guest room. Buy whatever Xinya needs for her everyday use using my own money.\u201dA gloomy look flashed in Ning Shuqing\u2019s eyes, and her expression was distress at its maximum. She forced a smile and said, \u201cFather, this is all because of my negligence, causing such an inconvenience to Xinya.\u201d She then looked at Xinya once more and apologized. \u201cXinya, ever since you returned you kept yourself to your room. Aunt Ning did not know how to interact with you, causing this oversight. You wouldn\u2019t be angry at Aunt Ning, would you?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She felt that it was incredible as Wen Xinya picked herself up and shook her head in disbelief.Back in those days, she wore Xia Ruya\u2019s clothing for a whole year, and the clothes that did not fit her body clung to her identity like a shadow. Even though she was the eldest daughter of the Wen Family, she still had to wear the clothes of the Wen Family\u2019s adopted daughter, Xia Ruya. To others, Wen Xinya was an unpresentable eldest daughter who was not loved. It was natural that everyone looked down on her.The Wen Family did not notice it at first. When they finally did, they were manipulated by Ning Shuqing saying that the reason Xinya wore Ruya\u2019s clothes was that she was jealous of Ruya, causing her to be loathed by the family even more.In this life, she would not allow that to happen again!Wen Haowen retrieved a bank card from his own wallet. \u201cThis is your allowance. Yuya gets 10 thousand a month, thus you will get 20 thousand a month since you are the eldest daughter. However, considering that you wandered outside for many years and endured many hardships, I\u2019m giving you 30 thousand a month. The allowance for the past 15 years will also be credited into your account, so just get whatever you need.\u201dWen Yuya\u2019s eyes nearly popped from all her glaring. There was deep jealousy hidden in her eyes.\u201cThank you, Father!\u201d Wen Xinya accepted the bank card with mixed feelings. This situation was exactly the same as the previous time.The fifteen years worth of allowance totaled to a little more than 500,000. Imagine a wandering girl who had never seen this much money in her life suddenly possessing such a huge amount of money. How would she be able to suppress such monstrous wealth? With a heart that constantly compared herself to Xia Ruya, in addition to the bad teachings of Ning Shuqing and Wen Yuya, how could she not have gone astray!The previous time, the outside world must have viewed her as vulgar, extravagant, arrogant, and an idiot!In this life, this money would become the capital for her transformation.Wen Haowen nodded and said nothing more.The breakfast was served today was Western cuisine. The combination of bacon, turkey eggs, bread, and milk was very appetizing. Ignoring the cutlery in front of them would make the scene even more perfect than it already was.Ning Shuqing was indeed trying to manipulate the Wen Family into having the impression that Xinya was uncouth. In her previous life, Xinya embarrassed herself at this very Western meal, causing Grandma to excuse herself from breakfast out of disgust, Father to coldly take his office bag and leave for work, and Grandpa to reluctantly finish his breakfast and return to the study. Her stepmother and stepsister then comforted her before leaving.She observed the coldness in the entire hall. Behind her back, the servants were gathered together, gossiping and mocking her.In her anger, she brushed the whole table of barely touched food to the floor. The sound of the plates shattering was deafening, but she had gained an even more irritable reputation.She only saw how vulgar she was that day after a long time, so she worked hard to learn all forms of manners. Her mannerisms got no worse than Xia Ruya\u2019s, but by then, she already had a coarse impression carved into everyone\u2019s heart. So no matter what she did, she could not replace Xia Ruya\u2019s place in the hearts of the Wen Family members. Naturally, she could not surpass Xia Ruya despite her best efforts.That was the reason why she was so dejected, even giving up on herself in the end!Something as small as etiquette during a Western meal could not daunt her, but at the moment, she was supposed to have just returned to the Wen Family. Naturally, she could not expose herself.Grandpa thought about what Xinya said last night and was thinking of asking the servants to prepare two sets of Chinese cuisine breakfast. That was when he saw that Wen Xinya used her hands to pick up the bread on the table and began eating. She ate it really slow. The way she was eating was not refined nor elegant, but at least it was calm!Ning Shuqing and Wen Yuya were secretly paying attention to her the whole time, quietly waiting for her to embarrass herself in front of everyone.Wen Xinya finished eating the bread, gulped down her milk, and then shyly announced. \u201cGrandpa, Grandma, Father, Aunt Ning, I\u2019ve eaten my fill!\u201dShe did not even touch the cutlery in front of her! Ning Shuqing hurried and said, \u201cWhy does this child eat so little? Is it because the breakfast was not to your liking? Do you want me to get the kitchen staff to prepare something else?\u201dWen Xinya shook her head and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to trouble you, Aunt Ning. Breakfast was delicious, but I really am full. I\u2026\u201d Wen Xinya was actually feeling a little down, so she coughed a little before adding, \u201cI have never eaten such a delicious breakfast!\u201dGrandpa put down the cutlery in his hands, losing his appetite in the scrumptious meal before him. \u201cI\u2019m also done with breakfast. Xinya, help me to the study.\u201dEveryone at the dining table looked at one another, noticing that Grandpa did not even touch his breakfast. His health was in top form, he certainly did not need anyone to help him!Wen Xinya stood up, gently pulled her chair aside to walk to Grandpa\u2019s side, and gently supported his arm as they left the dining hall.When they arrived at the study, Grandpa called for the servants and asked for the desserts to be brought to the study.Grandpa patted her hand, comforting her. \u201cIt\u2019s okay to not know about Western dining etiquette. No one is born with the knowledge of dining etiquette. In a few days, I will get Secretary Cao to arrange etiquette classes for you.\u201dWen Xinya was touched. \u201cGrandpa, I know. I was simply afraid that you would reject me before I even had the chance to prove myself.\u201dIn her past life, that was exactly what happened. She did not even have the chance to prove herself before being rejected by the Wen Family.Grandpa petted her hair in pity. \u201cYou silly girl. You are my family\u2019s only heir. As long as you don\u2019t bring loss to the family, I will never reject you.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes were red in seconds, as tears as large as beans fell one by one. Exactly how disappointed was Grandpa in the past life to have rejected her!Grandpa\u2019s wrinkled hands clumsily wiped her tears. \u201cYou\u2019re already so old, yet you still act like a child, crying at the tiniest thing!\u201dGrandpa\u2019s hand was like the bark of a eucalyptus tree, tough and rough. But to Wen Xinya, it was the world\u2019s warmest pair of hands. \u201cI\u2019m not. It\u2019s just sand in my eyes.\u201dShe never knew that Grandpa, who was stern and cold, would show such warmth to her.He did not know whether to laugh or cry at her stubbornness. \u201cBrat. How would there be sand in the house?\u201dWen Xinya lowered her head in embarrassment.At this moment, Mother Wang brought several intricate desserts into the study. Mother Wang was more than 50 years old and had been working for the Wen Family for over 30 years. She could very well be the oldest servant the Wen Family had. In Xinya\u2019s last life, this old lady was the only other person besides Grandpa who cared for her. But at that time, she was like an arrogant peacock, looking down on the servant. Afterward, Mother Wang retired and was never seen again.When Mother Wang smiled, her round face looked kind. \u201cMiss, I don\u2019t know what kind of dessert you like, so I simply made a few. If there is anything you like, do let me know and I will make it for you next time.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya thanked her gratefully. \u201cThank you, Mother Wang!\u201dMother Wang looked at her clean, young little face and remarked. \u201cMiss looks so much like her mother.\u201dAfter Mother Wang left, Grandpa sighed. \u201cYour mother was a warm and beautiful girl. After marrying into the Wen Family, everyone loved her. It\u2019s a pity that she lived such a short life. Until today, many servants still miss her!\u201dIt was no wonder that in her past life Mother Wang cared so much about her. It was because Mother Wang loved her mother too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Grandpa had arranged for his own personal driver, Old Tao, to send them.They arrived shortly at Pearl Mall and saw Xia Ruya at the entrance.Xia Ruya wore a lotus green dress tailor-made by Fan Sizhe. Matched with an entire set of diamond jewelry, she looked slender and elegant.Even if Xia Ruya was back to square one, she continued to have a good life. Everyone will have a nemesis in their lifetime. Just like Xia Ruya was Wen Xinya\u2019s nemesis.Wen Xinya had a faint rose-shaped birthmark on her chest. When her mother Mo Yunyao passed away soon after giving birth, everyone was devastated and had not paid much attention to the newborn baby. It was that moment of negligence that caused a tragedy that lasted 15 years. The newborn Wen Xinya was carried away by an enemy and abandoned at a club\u2019s entrance.The Wen Family used up all their resources to trace their precious little granddaughter. After three years, they finally found a female baby with a faint rose-shaped birthmark on her chest. Because of how much they had missed their lost granddaughter, they immediately took this baby girl back and named her Wen Ruya without even doing any DNA tests.Wen Ruya had a minor accident at the age of 14 and required a blood transfusion due to a huge amount of blood loss. Her blood belonged to a rare Rh-negative type, and the hospital did not have such a blood type in their reserve. The hospital had asked the members of the Wen Family for help, but not one in the family nor the late Madam Wen had the Rh-negative blood type. It was at that moment they realized Wen Ruya was not the granddaughter they were looking for.However, Wen Ruya knew how to turn things to her advantage. Though she wasn\u2019t the Wen Family\u2019s granddaughter, she continually made Grandma happy, so she did not mind if Ruya wasn\u2019t her genuine granddaughter. On the other hand, old Mr. Wen didn\u2019t want to give up looking for his lost descendant. He also had a sense of guilt towards Wen Ruya and therefore secretly helped her look for her lost family.Due to the rarity of the Rh-negative blood type, they easily traced her back to the Xia Family. Xia Ruya was the illegitimate daughter of Xia Haolin, the CEO of the Xia Emporium Group.The Xia Emporium Group had malls built in every corner of the country. Though the Xia Family was considered wealthy, they were incomparable to the Wen Family\u2019s wealth. The Xia Family quickly agreed to fetch Xia Ruya back on the accord that the Wen Family groom her to be a well-mannered and elegant young girl for many years. Furthermore, this would be a good excuse for them to be connected to the prestigious Wen Family. They even wanted to please the Wen Family by just changing Ruya\u2019s surname to Xia and not the original name the Wen Family gave her.Xia Ruya always had lady luck on her side. After living a life of high status for 12 years, she continued to be a wealthy family\u2019s daughter even after she had to leave the Wen Family.Xia Ruya happily walked towards Wen Xinya and the rest when she saw them. She said excitedly, \u201cAunt Ning, Yuya, Xinya, I\u2019m glad to see you here. Shall we go shopping together?\u201dWen Xinya laughed with sarcasm in her heart. She knew it was not a coincidence to see Xia Ruya here. It must be Ning Shuqian who had informed her.Ning Shuqian showed an expression of unwillingness and glanced towards Wen Xinya\u2019s direction. She said, \u201cWe\u2019re here today for Xinya. We need to get her clothes and other accessories, therefore\u2026\u201dWen Xinya grinned and thought to herself:What a hypocrite!By saying that Ning Shuqian wanted to bring out the contrast between Xia Ruya\u2019s gracefulness and Wen Xinya\u2019s uncouthness.Wen Yuya was happy to see her too. She tightly held Xia Ruya\u2019s arm and said, \u201cSister Ruya, what a coincidence! You have such an affinity with the Wen Family that we ran into each other even on the streets.\u201dWen Xinya felt disgusted watching these three women\u2019s acting. She then said with sarcasm, \u201cOf course there\u2019s a strong affinity, so strong that she had been an adopted daughter to the Wen Family for 12 years.\u201dXia Ruya did not expect to hear this. Her head drooped with a sense of wrongness and said, \u201cXinya, I know you dislike me and think I was the one who took everything from you. But it wasn\u2019t my fault! I was also very sad when I had to leave my beloved Grandpa, Grandma, Father, and Aunt, as well as my dearest little sister.\u201dWen Yuya could not stand it any further. She stared at Wen Xinya, blaming her, \u201cWen Xinya, you think you have truly become the Wen Family\u2019s eldest daughter? Look at you. Your uncivilized behavior does not even make you close to being part of the Wen Family. You are just a little gangster from the streets. But Sister Ruya is different. Although she isn\u2019t the real Wen Family\u2019s daughter, she is so much better than you! Do you really think you have become a phoenix? You are just a little sparrow in disguise.\u201dPearl Mall was a well-known luxurious shopping mall. It was frequented by the wealthy. In her previous lifetime, Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya had brought her there as well. And similarly, they had also met Xia Ruya there. After exchanging a few sarcastic and offensive words, the previous Wen Xinya could not hold her temper and started fighting with Xia Ruya on the spot, thus attracting a lot of attention. It was at that time that she got a bad reputation for being a shrew, and then became a laughing stock to the other wealthy ladies.With no expression on her face, Wen Xinya said to the both of them, \u201cSister Yuya, why are you agitated? I have not finished my sentence. I mean to say that since the Wen Family can have one daughter, of course we wouldn\u2019t mind having another one.\u201dThese words drove Wen Yuya mad. She looked at Wen Xinya\u2019s expressionless face and really felt like giving her a hard slap!Meanwhile, Xia Ruya was observing Wen Xinya closely. She noticed the change in Wen Xinya overnight. She was able to keep her cool and stand quietly. Her face was clear of cosmetics, showing her real beauty from within. This reminded Xia Ruya of the old viburnum tree in the Wen Family\u2019s old mansion. Wen Xinya was beautiful, calm and pure, just like that tree.Realizing that her initial plan to shame Wen Xinya had failed, Ning Shuqian stepped up and pulled Wen Yuya aside, worried that she might embarrass herself at a public place. She added, \u201cWe are going upstairs to help Xinya select a few nice outfits. Ruya, do join us!\u201dXia Ruya replied with a smile, \u201cI haven\u2019t shopped with Aunt Ning for ages. I would definitely like to join you!\u201d She then turned to Wen Xinya and said, \u201cXinya, you wouldn\u2019t mind, would you?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya frowned slightly, \u201cAunt Ning is our elder. I have no objectives since it\u2019s her idea.\u201dNing Shuqian happily pulled Xia Ruya along. She said, \u201cRuya has an eye for style. Her comments will be useful! I am already over 30. My taste for clothes would be different from younger girls like you.\u201dWen Yuya also went up close to Xia Ruya and exclaimed, \u201cIndeed! Sister Ruya has good taste. She has helped me to choose a lot of nice outfits.\u201dThe three of them spoke with perfect synchronization, leaving Wen Xinya behind all by herself. Wen Xinya didn\u2019t mind. She would just enjoy their act.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did You Brush Your Teeth?Atlas StudiosNing Shuqian brought the girls to a shop named Jo-ramst. It was a luxury brand owned by the Wen Corporation that was nominated as one of the top 10 international luxurious brands. The brand carried products like clothing, perfumes, cosmetics, ladies\u2019 shoes, jewelry and purses that were extremely popular.Speaking of this brand, it had a great association with Wen Xinya. When Mo Yunyao was pregnant with the eldest grandchild of the Wen Family, old Mr. Wen had high expectations for the child regardless of the gender. Therefore, he created the Jo-ramst brand.For the past 15 years, this luxury brand successfully created its own trend by strictly following Country Z\u2019s traditional and contemporary clothing style. It had since become one of the top brands in the world.Wen Xinya looked lost. Ning Shuqian thought to herself sarcastically:Wen Xinya\u2019s behavior shows that she\u2019s green and inexperienced. She isn\u2019t able to catch up with the trend. What a disgrace!Wen Yuya sneered. \u201cDo you know what is the name of this brand?\u201dWen Xinya responded replied, \u201cSister Yuya, you know French? You are indeed knowledgeable.\u201dWen Yuya was stunned. This brand\u2019s name was French, but she knew nothing about French. But how could she not be aware of the brand since it was owned by the Wen Corporation?Xia Ruya held Wen Yuya gently by her arm and smilingly said, \u201cSister Yuya doesn\u2019t know anything about French, but she frequently shops at Jo-ramst and therefore knows this brand well.\u201dHaving Xia Ruya speaking up for her, Wen Yuya became arrogant again and mocked Wen Xinya. \u201cThis is one of the brand luxury shops belonging to the Wen Corporation. I bet this is the first time you\u2019re here!\u201dKnowing Wen Yuya\u2019s intention to scoff at her, Wen Xinya didn\u2019t mind at all. She looked at Ning Shuqian and smiled. \u201cI will need to trouble Aunt Ning to bring me here more frequently in the future so that I can catch up with the trend.\u201dNing Shuqian turned stiff. She tried to hide it quickly by pulling Wen Xinya\u2019s hand gently with a wide, warm smile. \u201cYes, of course! Your mother has passed away, and since I am your stepmother, I will definitely bring you out shopping more frequently!\u201dNoticing that they were in a public area, Ning Shuqian knew she had to present herself well.Wen Yuya clenched her teeth tightly and stared at Wen Xinya, hating her to the core!Xia Ruya was shocked to find out that the actual Wen Family\u2019s eldest daughter had only returned home for barely a week and could already completely adapt and blend into the lifestyle of an affluent family. The old uncouth Wen Xinya who was full of vulgarity and vicious words and got into fights easily had totally disappeared.Ning Shuqian brought them into the shop.A shop assistant came forward and greeted them enthusiastically. \u201cWelcome, Madam Wen and the two young Misses Wen! How can I assist you today?\u201d She wore a tight-fitting black outfit.The two \u201cyoung Misses Wen\u201d she greeted were Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya. Wen Xinya was walking behind, wearing a dress that did not even fit her. She was being completely ignored.Wen Yuya whispered to Wen Xinya cockily, \u201cSee? I was right! You\u2019re just an unworthy sparrow. Don\u2019t ever think you can become a phoenix. You are not even fit to be compared to Sister Ruya. You don\u2019t possess a single bit of the aura of a Wen Family\u2019s daughter. Having you visit such a luxurious shop just enhances your unworthiness.\u201dWen Xinya suddenly turned away and used her hands to fan in front of her nose. She blurted out, \u201cIt stinks! Where did that smell come from? Sister Yuya, did you brush your teeth this morning?!\u201dWen Yuya turned pale with anger and tried to rebuke. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201dNing Shuqian tugged Wen Yuya lightly and introduced Wen Xinya with a broad smile. \u201cThis is our Wen Family\u2019s eldest daughter, Wen Xinya!\u201dThe shop assistant looked puzzled. She thought to herself:Isn\u2019t the Wen Family\u2019s eldest daughter Miss Wen Ruya? Who is this Wen Xinya?As a shop assistant, she had to be far more observant than anyone else. This was the first time she saw Wen Xinya and had already noticed her natural beauty and elegance within despite her wearing a loose dress that barely fitted her.She immediately shifted her attention without feeling embarrassed about her mistake, as she then said to Wen Xinya with a wide smile, \u201cWelcome, Miss Wen!\u201dWen Xinya nodded lightly.The shop assistant then looked at Xia Ruya, wondering about her identity. Wen Yuya gave the shop assistant a hard stare and said in an arrogant tone, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Though Sister Ruya is not part of the Wen Family, she is still the prestigious daughter of the owner of the Xia Emporium Group. She is still much worthier than you.\u201dThe shop assistant remained calm with a smile on her face. But she knew in her heart that the Xia Emporium Group and the Wen Corporation were far apart in terms of size and wealth.Xia Ruya felt a little embarrassed. She signaled for Wen Yuya to stop and tried turning the attention back to Wen Xinya, saying, \u201cXinya, do you have in mind which type of clothes you like? Do you need any recommendations?\u201dWen Xinya shook her head. \u201cI\u2019d like to decide on my own. I can make better choices of clothing that suit me best.\u201dIn such a situation, Ning Shuqian had to display her demeanor as a stepmother. She said in agreement, \u201cSure, go ahead and make your own selection. We are here to help if you need us.\u201dNing Shuqian was harboring the intention of letting Wen Xinya make a fool of herself. After all, what good of a choice could a green and inexperienced boorish bitch make?Wen Xinya nodded and started walking towards the shelves to choose an outfit for herself and quickly found a light-blue mini-skirt that she liked.The shop assistant exclaimed, \u201cMiss Wen has a very nice curvy figure that captures attention, especially your legs! They display all the gracefulness that a woman should possess. I\u2019ve never seen such a perfect pair of legs!\u201dWen Xinya wasn\u2019t tall and slim like Wen Yuya, nor was she as voluptuous as Xia Ruya, but she had a nice bone structure, a long neck of a swan, and a rounded, petite shoulder. Though she was not as busty as she should be at her age, she had an attractive slim waist and a young and innocent aura.She had a pair of long slim legs that glowed and looked as pure as ivory. She was able to carry herself well in these legs and they brought out the sexiness in her.It reminded Ning Shuqian of Mo Yunyao, and she suddenly felt a sense of unconcealable fear. Trying to remain in her usual gentle outer self, she remarked. \u201cThis outfit looks really nice on Xinya!\u201dIn the beginning, Wen Haowen had chosen to marry Mo Yunyao over her. Mo Yunyao had a better family background and was more presentable and prettier than Ning Shuqian. After Ning Shuqian entered the Wen Family as Haowen\u2019s wife, the media made numerous comparisons between the two. Therefore, Mo Yunyao was her most hated person.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe shop assistant tried to be sensitive. She wasn\u2019t sure if the compliment was directed to Wen Xinya or the outfit.Xia Ruya bit her lip in abomination. She then said with reluctance, \u201cXinya is indeed beautiful.\u201d She could sense Wen Xinya\u2019s beauty when she first saw her. However, at that time Wen Xinya was behaving in an unrefined manner and bad temper. This behavior was a mismatch to her beauty. Now that she was a changed person, Xia Ruya felt a strong sense of shame.Wen Yuya criticized. \u201cThe saying that \u2018the clothes make the man\u2019 is true indeed. Even if worn by a mother hen, such a beautiful outfit would still be able to bring out the elegance in her.\u201dLittle did Wen Yuya expect that a bitch like Wen Xinya could look stunning after dressing up. She felt a strong hatred and jealousy in her heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hearing what Wen Yuya said, Wen Xinya turned and walked gracefully towards her. She displayed a strong characteristic of elegance and inner beauty within her. With each step, she had brought out the class of high status coupled with a high level of confidence.\u201cWhat\u2026 What do you want?\u201d Wen Yuya stammered with anxiety. She suddenly felt flustered and did not dare to look at Wen Xinya in the eyes.Wen Xinya raised the corners of her lips. She looked sharp\u2014beautiful as a flower and calm as snow; as if a strong breeze of courage just swept through her.At this moment she was glowing with charm. It felt like the refracted light from the chandelier brought her elegance into the limelight, making it difficult to look at her directly without the glaring light hurting the eyes. Only the contour of her face was slightly visible.Wen Xinya stopped right in front of Wen Yuya. She lowered her body slowly until she was in a squatted position. She then looked up to Wen Yuya like a devoted believer looking up at God.Except she did not have the gracefulness of God. Anyone under this beautiful light became so attractive that was able to touch the soul. Even though Wen Xinya was looking up from a lower position it felt like she was the one calling the shots.\u201cWhat\u2026 What are you doing, bitch? Get away from me\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya started stuttering. She was panicking and her heart was beating faster and faster.Lub-dub! Lub-dub!Ning Shuqian was certain that Wen Xinya wouldn\u2019t do anything silly in front of her at this moment. Therefore, she didn\u2019t mind her actions. However, seeing her own daughter turning pale and panicky with sweat all over her forehead, she felt something wasn\u2019t right. She had to interfere. \u201cXinya, what are you doing?\u201dWen Xinya did not respond. She raised her hands towards Wen Yuya\u2019s cheek and combed her hair with her slim, long fingers. Wen Yuya could feel the unfriendliness from the touch of her hands. She almost froze and didn\u2019t dare move an inch, asking in a trembling voice, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dWen Xinya placed her fair and slim fingers on Wen Yuya\u2019s cheeks gently and moved slowly downwards along her rounded cheeks. Then, she held Wen Yuya\u2019s chin authoritatively and lifted her head. \u201cI just wanted to see if you looked like a mother hen too. We are from the same chicken coop, so it doesn\u2019t make sense if I look like a mother hen and you don\u2019t,\u201d she told her.\u201cArgh! Get lost\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya started screaming nervously while trying to push Wen Xinya\u2019s hands away.Wen Xinya took her time to stand up. She adjusted her clothes in a tranquil manner. She turned towards the shivering Wen Yuya and gave her an icy look that pierced through her heart like a knife.Ning Shuqian and Xia Ruya who were watching by the side had chills running down their spines.\u201cHow dare you challenge me? \u2014 Umm?\u201d Wen Xinya said in a domineering voice. There was no way to defend against her words that attacked like a secret weapon.The \u201cUmm\u201d even sounded with great power of influence.Wen Yuya bit her lips tightly. She looked at Wen Xinya with a pair of eyes that were filled with bitterness and resentment. She hated Wen Xinya to the bone.Ning Shuqian couldn\u2019t believe that she was stunned by a 15-year-old\u2019s words. She quickly recovered from her shock and reproached. \u201cXinya, Yuya is your sister. How can you treat her this way?\u201dUnbothered, Wen Xinya turned to Ning Shuqian, asking her, \u201cWhat have I done to her? I did not beat or scold her, did I?\u201dNing Shuqian was speechless. Indeed, Wen Xinya had done nothing to harm Wen Yuya physically. She could only look at her poor daughter suffering in fear and hatred after being browbeaten by Wen Xinya\u2019s words. Yet, there was nothing she could do to help except feel sorry and harbor a great sense of enmity towards Wen Xinya.She had underestimated this little bitch!Seeing Ning Shuqian suffering from humiliation, Xia Ruya had to step in. \u201cXinya, Sister Yuya is someone who speaks from the heart. She is so outspoken and direct that sometimes even Aunt Ning cannot do anything about it. You\u2019ll get to know her better after some time.\u201dXia Ruya managed to catch her breath. She almost felt breathless earlier when Wen Xinya walked towards Wen Yuya with such an unspoken power of authority. Her brain was screaming for her to escape. To Xia Ruya, Wen Xinya was as scary as a devil that came from hell.Wen Xinya answered, \u201cYes, I have just returned to the Wen Family. Hence, I don\u2019t know her as well as you do.\u201d Then she looked at Ning Shuqian and apologized respectfully. \u201cAunt Ning and Sister Yuya, please pardon me if I have offended you in any way.\u201dWhen Ning Shuqian was just feeling a little better and wanted to display her broad-mindedness, Wen Xinya interrupted. \u201cAunt Ning, pardon my honesty. There is nothing good about being direct and outspoken. Calling others names like \u2018mother hen\u2019 or \u2018bitch\u2019 won\u2019t do any good to Sister Yuya\u2019s reputation as an adopted daughter of the Wen Family, and could even do a discredit to the Wen Family. Fortunately, it was me who was being scolded by Sister Yuya today. I won\u2019t hold it against her, naturally, but it could be a different story if she did it to someone else.\u201dShe then spoke to Wen Yuya in a lecturing tone. \u201cSister Yuya, you have to take note of this. The Wen Family could buy anything you want, but not your reputation.\u201dNing Shuqian almost spat blood onto Wen Xinya\u2019s face. She never expected to be lectured by this little bitch. She became so speechless that it felt like almost nothing she said was going to make things right.By now, Wen Yuya who was seated at the sofa, feeling extremely pissed. As she heard this, she sprung up from the sofa. However, Ning Shuqian swiftly grabbed her hands and said in a moderate tone, \u201cYour sister is right. You are an adopted daughter of the Wen Family. You grew up with a civilized upbringing. Do watch your behavior as a daughter of the Wen Family.\u201dAfter hearing Ning Shuqian\u2019s words, Wen Yuya tilted her head up high. She was 1.66 meters tall and looked tougher than Wen Xinya, who was only 1.58 meters tall. She felt a sense of great contentment from within.Wen Xinya chose to ignore such attempts to ridicule her. She turned around and walked away.Wen Xinya did not realize there was a man sitting at the resting area at a short distance away. With a magazine in his hands, this man had seen everything that just happened.That beautiful silhouette of Wen Xinya looked slim and charming under the refracted lights from the chandelier. The man had captured the act of this enchanting character in his eyes. He mumbled to himself, \u201cIs this the eldest daughter of the Wen Family?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter seeing what just happened, the shop assistant was trembling with horror. It was the first time she saw someone being able to attack relentlessly with her words and still maintain a class of high status and elegance.

You have long beautiful legs and will definitely look nice in them.\u201dIt had been a common misconception that long dresses are made especially for ladies with shorter legs to conceal them.

They looked fresh and enchanting. Wen Xinya was immediately attracted to this batch of long dresses. She chose a light-green colored dress with peach-blossoms of her size and went on into the fitting room.Wen Xinya got changed and came out very quickly. The shop assistant couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. Green was such a seductive color, but it matched Wen Xinya so well that it was as if it was custom-made just for her. The dress brought out the class and charm in her. The shop assistant added, \u201cYou look nice! Adding some matching accessories should make it better. Please wait a while, let me pick a few accessories to go with this dress.\u201dThe shop assistant came to the accessories section that was right beside the rest area. She saw the VIP customer who came in the morning. He was standing at the accessories section browsing around.That customer looked dark, cold, and malicious, thus the shop assistant kept a distance from him. She didn\u2019t even have the courage to look up at him in the eyes.She secretly stared at his hands. He had nice long fingers with some long fingernails. From his actions, these fingers looked hard and felt as if there were some unlimited powers hidden within.Within a couple of minutes, the man had already selected at least five pieces of accessories, including headwear, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.The shop assistant caught herself drifting and suddenly realized she was here to pick up some accessories for Miss Wen. She then hurriedly resumed her actions to pick the accessories from the shelf.Jo-ramst was a brand that carried nostalgic clothing that followed Country Z\u2019s traditional style. It also had a lot of matching retro-styled jewelry and accessories. Therefore, this brand was extremely popular amongst the ladies of the upper class. Moreover, the jewelry shop owned by the Wen Corporation was also well known internationally. Both their articles of clothing and jewelry were often sold in matching pieces. The shop assistant focused her attention on the shelf that displayed jade. She thought:Miss Wen has a simplistic and elegant charm, thus a piece of jade accessory will look perfect on her!\u201cGive these accessories to Miss Wen,\u201d said the man in a thin but powerful voice, sounding distant.\u201cYes!\u201d The shop assistant took over the tray of accessories. When she looked up at the man, he had already left the rest area through its glass door. She watched the back of the man slowly disappearing away from her as he moved away in steady steps.Who was this man? What was his relationship with Miss Wen and why did he choose the accessories for her?The shop assistant examined the accessories in the tray. These pieces were the main selection for the current season. They were sold in this shop because it was the shop with the top sales in the entire country.Selecting matching accessories to go with the outfits was one of the successful sales strategies used by the Wen Corporation. On the one hand, it attracted customers. And on the other hand, it also helped to promote new jewelry. Therefore, this branch had the opportunity to display the most expensive and newest selection of each season\u2019s trend.This shop even carried one of the most expensive jewelry that the entire corporation had on sale\u2014the pigeon-blood ruby.The shop assistant returned with the tray of accessories in a daze. Miss Wen was already trying a second outfit. It was a yellow long skirt, with a white petals design. She looked so pure and innocent, exactly like what a 15-year-old should be.\u201cMiss Wen, a man has selected these five pieces of accessories on your behalf. Please see if you like them,\u201d said the shop assistant while putting the tray on a white marble table with a light-purple orchid design.Wen Xinya asked curiously, \u201cMan? What man?\u201dThe shop assistant said with a puzzled look on her face, \u201cHe was quite tall, and had a very decent and simple look. I\u2019m not sure who he is, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be an ordinary man.\u201dWen Xinya just returned to the Wen Family. For the past 15 years, she had only seen gangsters and lower-income people who were always slogging away, not including those from her previous life. After hearing the shop assistant\u2019s description of the man, he seemed to be someone with wealth and influence. Wen Xinya thought it was unlikely that she knew someone with such status. Therefore, she didn\u2019t give extra thought and focused on the accessories in the tray.There it was, the pigeon-blood ruby sitting right in the tray. It looked like the ruby was covered in bright red pigeon\u2019s blood, glowing and as bright as a burning flame. The burning flame effect was greatly enhanced by the way it was polished.These pieces of jewelry added up to 10-carat of gems. Combining the cost of all these earrings, necklace, ring, bracelet, and the most expensive pigeon-blood ruby, they were worth a total of 10 million plus dollars\u2026Wen Xinya\u2019s heart sank. She knew the prices of these pieces of jewelry was much more than she could afford.After taking a quick glance, she looked away and said, \u201cJust help me find some simple accessories.\u201dThe shop assistant suddenly recovered from her trance. She realized she had made a big mistake. She knew that if Miss Wen had wanted all the five pieces of jewelry, she would have a hard time explaining to the management. Although this shop belonged to the Wen Corporation, Miss Wen would still have to pay for the items she bought. Even if she was given a 50% discount, these few pieces would still have cost a bomb. She would not be able to make such a big decision on the shop\u2019s behalf.She then selected some other matching accessories that could match Wen Xinya\u2019s status.Wen Xinya was pretty satisfied.Apart from outfits, Wen Xinya also selected matching shoes and bags to go with.When Ning Shuqian received the bill from the cashier, her face turned as black as coal, because she was the one to foot the bill. The billed items included clothing, accessories, shoes, cosmetics, perfume, and a hat. It cost her over two hundred thousand dollars even after a 50% discount.She turned to look at Wen Xinya who was still hanging out at the perfume area. Grinding her teeth with anger, she passed her credit card to the cashier for payment.Wen Yuya was mad too. \u201cFather gave you a credit card this morning, didn\u2019t he? Why don\u2019t you pay the bill yourself?\u201d she reprimanded.Wen Xinya looked sorry and uncertain as she replied, \u201cI am not sure as I have just returned to the Wen Family. Father had asked Aunt Ning to get me new outfits this morning. Grandpa also asked Aunt Ning to take care of me. I\u2026\u201dAs Ning Shuqian noticed that the employees of the shop were watching, she then instantly told Wen Yuya off. \u201cYuya, how can you say that? Although Xinya isn\u2019t my birth daughter, there is nothing wrong with me buying things for her as a stepmother. Quickly apologize to your sister.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Yuya was full of hatred. She looked at Wen Xinya and apologized reluctantly, \u201cI\u2026 am\u2026 sorry!\u201dWen Xinya gave a cold smile without saying anything. She kept challenging Wen Yuya not because she felt that she was stupid, but because she had a quick-witted mother.Xia Ruya tried to break the awkward silence by saying, \u201cXinya has just returned to the Wen Family, so I guess she hasn\u2019t bought any daily necessities. Let\u2019s go to the female section and see if there\u2019s anything she needs.\u201dNing Shuqian appreciated Xia Ruya\u2019s quick thinking. Xia Ruya was indeed a sweetheart to the Wen Family. She grew up in the family and always knew when to do the right thing. It was no wonder Grandma liked her so much. Ning Shuqian added, \u201cOf course, let\u2019s go to another shop.

The shop assistants greeted her one after another. \u201cHello, Manager!\u201dThe woman nodded, commanding the shop assistant who was previously serving Wen Xinya. \u201cTake the five pieces of jewelry that Miss Wen had seen previously and wrap them up. In a while, we will send them to the Wens\u2019 mansion for Miss Wen. She must receive them personally.\u201dThe shop assistant was surprised, suddenly realizing that the total cost of the five accessories would amount close to a million dollars. What did the manager mean by wrapping them up? Even with thoughts like these, she was not slow, quickly wrapping the valuable pieces of jewelry up exquisitely.This was when Ning Shuqing had already paid, and the cashier was handing over the receipt to Ning Shuqing. Ning Shuqing instructed the shop assistant to deliver the things to the Wen Mansion. Although she was distressed, she could use this chance to ask Haowen for reimbursement. At the same time, she could portray herself as gentle and generous in front of Old Mr. Wen, so she had to perform well today.Then, the shop\u2019s manager walked over elegantly. \u201cMissus Wen! How come you have the time to come here today?\u201dNing Shuqing was a regular of this store, so she was very acquainted with the store manager, Li Mengjie, who was a competent woman. Ning Shuqing did not dare to look down on her. \u201cToday\u2019s main agenda was to accompany Xinya shopping for some clothes.\u201dAs she spoke, she pulled Wen Xinya closer and introduced. \u201cThis is our Wen Family\u2019s eldest daughter, Wen Xinya. She just returned to the Wen Family a few days ago.\u201dLi Mengjie smiled and reached out. \u201cHello, Miss Wen. I\u2019m this store\u2019s manager, Li Mengjie.\u201dLi Mengjie sized up the Miss Wen in front of her, who was wearing the goose-yellow gauze skirt she just bought. The hem of the long skirt was sewn with light blue flower patterns, bringing about a sense of delicateness and vigor. She paired her outfit with an apple-green jade ornament, portraying an aura of certainty.Li Mengjie subtly glanced at Wen Yuya and Xia Ruya. Wen Yuya had a tall frame, choosing to play the beautiful character, looking much older than she actually was when she dressed up. Xia Ruya took the elegant path of grandeur, dressing appropriately but lacking the youthfulness a 15-year-old girl should have.When one dresses according to their age, one puts themselves in a position that suits them best. This Miss Wen is not simple-minded!Wen Xinya was not bothered by Li Mengjie\u2019s evaluation of her, gently shaking the tip of her hand and greeting her back. \u201cManager Li, hello!\u201d\u201cNext month we will have a new batch of the latest designs. Miss Wen, be sure to come and take a look.\u201d Li Mengjie announced.\u201cOf course!\u201d Though she had no idea why this store manager was so attentive towards her, naturally, she did not know how to reject such a friendly invitation.Li Mengjie watched Wen Xinya leave the store with an odd expression on her face.

There is no room for carelessness.\u201dWith regards to the drama happening within the Wen Family, it had already started circulating within their social circle. Everyone was extremely curious about the legitimate eldest daughter of the Wen Family.Her 15 years of history was dug out by people, and even the high society could differentiate between rumors and the truth were spreading about Missy Wen\u2019s unruliness, bad temper, and extravagant habits. She was not like the other young daughters of wealthy, classy families. She was more like a little hooligan of the streets. She was just a fraud.However, it was apparent that the rumors were not true. If the Miss Wen now and the Miss Wen from before were to stand together, one with an appearance of grace, the other with a spirit of elegance, which is to say which is the better one? Only those with an excellent eye would be able to tell.To be able to be that person, Miss Wen\u2019s value as a person naturally rose.Dawdling for a while, Ning Shuqian brought Wen Xinya to a western cuisine restaurant. Wen Xinya eyes lit up with ridicule. In the morning she avoided embarrassment, but now this?Looking at the cutlery and the 70% cooked steak in front of her, Wen Xinya laughed and said to Xia Ruya, \u201cRuya, I just returned to the Wen Family and have yet to learn how to use western cutlery. Do you mind helping me cut the steak?\u201dXia Ruya had to present herself as a gentle and kind person at all times so she would not refuse her.Xia Ruya\u2019s face stiffened a little, then smiled. \u201cSure!\u201dThe knife in Ning Shuqian\u2019s hand paused for a bit, as she lifted her head to look towards Wen Xinya. Her gaze was soft as dawn, but when she felt her gaze on her, she turned slightly towards her. In her eyes, there was a shocking coldness.Ning Shuqian withdrew her gaze. How could a 15-year-old young girl have such a scary gaze? It must be her imagination. With that thought in mind, she looked at Xinya with her peripheral vision. Sure enough, this time, Wen Xinya had taken up the knife and fork and was copying Xia Ruya exactly.Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes were filled with disdain. \u201cThe dignified Miss Wen cannot even cut up a steak by herself. She doesn\u2019t even know a single thing about western etiquette. This is beyond hilarious.\u201dAt this, the knife in Wen Xinya\u2019s hand actually slipped and flew towards Wen Yuya!Ning Shuqian was greatly shocked and shouted. \u201cYuya!\u201dWen Yuya was so shocked that all the color drained from her face. In her panic to dodge, she accidentally brushed the cup in front of her onto the floor.Clang!The loud sound echoed in the profound western restaurant in seconds. Even though there were not many people around in the afternoon, there were still a few tables filled, and the commotion had attracted everyone\u2019s attention immediately.Wen Yuya burned a bright shade of red, but then saw that the knife that had made her cower in fear was stuck right in front of her. Under the crystal lights, the refraction of the blade shone harshly.Wen Yuya panicked and looked at Ning Shuqian with a wronged expression. Ning Shuqian turned pale. She was quite sure that Wen Xinya, that little b*tch, did it on purpose. \u201cXinya, how could you be so careless? What if the knife landed on Yuya\u2019s body and hurt Yuya?\u201dWen Xinya looked at Wen Yuya with eyes filled with regret. \u201cAunt Ning, I\u2019m really sorry. I\u2019m not good with the cutlery, so with a slip of the hand, I nearly hurt Yuya. I hope you will not mind.\u201d She then turned to Wen Yuya with a sincere look and said, \u201cSister Yuya, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYou obviously did it on purpose,\u201d said Wen Yuya angrily.Xia Ruya hurried to comfort her. \u201cSister Yuya, don\u2019t you love the steak from this restaurant? The steak is turning cold, and when it\u2019s cold, it will not be as good.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Yuya was prepared to say something, but the look in Ning Shuqian\u2019s eyes stopped her.After being played by Wen Xinya like that, a western meal that was originally delicious tasted like wax in the mouth now. The soft, comfortable sofa felt as uncomfortable as though she was sitting on needles. She would never dare to bring her to another western restaurant.At this time, Xia Ruya had cut up the steak and served it to Wen Xinya. \u201cXinya, do you want me to teach you western etiquette?\u201d\u201cNo need, in two days Grandpa will arrange an etiquette instructor for me.\u201d Wen Xinya hid a sense of warning in her voice. Yesterday, Xia Ruya still provoked her about everything. Today, it was evident that she was on the same team with Ning Shuqian and her daughter, but afterward, she acted like a bystander, taking no sides. Now she was even voluntarily offering her help? It looks like she had underestimated her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They had bought over 20 sets of outfits from several different shops, together with matching jewelry accessories, shoes, cosmetics, bathroom accessories and more. Ning Shuqian had spent a lot of money on that day.They returned to the Wen Family at about 8 p.m. and found Old Mr. Wen sitting in the living room waiting for them.Wen Xinya was wearing her new yellow dress, looking young, neat and elegant. Old Mr. Wen nodded slightly in approval. Indeed, clothes make the man. He asked, \u201cYou are back. Have you had dinner?\u201dNing Shuqian felt flattered. She answered, \u201cYes, we had homemade cooking for dinner. It was good.\u201dThe more Old Mr. Wen looked at Wen Xinya, the more he was satisfied. \u201cAfter an entire day of shopping, you must be tired. Go back to your rooms to rest! Xinya, stay behind.\u201dNing Shuqian smiled reluctantly and agreed. \u201cYes, Father. You have an early rest too.\u201dWen Yuya clenched her teeth tightly. She wondered if she received different treatment because she was an adopted daughter.\u201cAunt Ning, sorry to trouble you for the whole day. Goodnight and sweet dreams!\u201d said Wen Xinya smilingly.Ning Shuqian dragged the angry Wen Yuya as they left the living room together.Only Old Mr. Wen and Wen Xinya remained in the living room. He said, \u201cThe things you purchased have been delivered. I asked Mother Wang to pack them on your behalf.\u201d\u201cThank you, Grandpa!\u201d Wen Xinya thanked him with appreciation.\u201cI\u2019ve done some serious thinking when you were out. I plan to organize an evening banquet three months later to make the official announcement about you returning to the Wen Family. I\u2019ll get Secretary Cao to arrange some etiquette-related classes for you. You have to prove your worthiness as the eldest daughter from an affluent family in three months time. Can you do that?\u201d old Mr. Wen informed her with a stern look in his eyes.To prove her worthiness as the eldest daughter from an affluent family within three months would be a daunting task for her previous life Wen Xinya. But for the new reborn Wen Xinya, it would be a piece of cake. \u201cGrandpa, please believe me. I will prove my worthiness as the eldest daughter of the Wen Family and make you proud,\u201d she promised.The smile on Wen Xinya\u2019s face was as beautiful as the blooming flowers on the cliff-wall. It made Old Mr. Wen thought he had made the right choice.Old Mr. Wen turned around and returned to his room.At this moment, Mother Wang brought a man who was wearing a blue uniform to the living room. \u201cMiss Wen, this is the delivery from the shop you visited earlier today, Jo-ramst. I have asked someone to send them to your room for packing. But the delivery man said he needed you to sign-off and receive a few items personally,\u201d she informed.Wen Xinya nodded and walked over to them. The man in the blue uniform handed her the receipt respectfully.Wen Xinya just took a quick glance at it. She knew what were the items she had purchased earlier. Therefore, she quickly signed and took over the big rectangle box from Mother Wang\u2019s hands.Wen Xinya returned to her room and opened the big box mindlessly. There were five smaller boxes of premium packaging inside. From the premium packaging, she could tell these boxes contained expensive items. As she doubtfully opened the five boxes one by one, she found the boxes contained the five pieces of expensive jewelry accessories she saw earlier. She was shocked.She then immediately dialed to the main number of Jo-ramst. Within a short while, someone picked up the line. \u201cI\u2019m Wen Xinya. Can I speak to Manager Ye, Ye Mengjie?\u201d she requested.\u201cI am Wen Xinya\u201d versus \u201cMy name is Wen Xinya\u201d were two different ways of speaking, and they conveyed very different meanings. The first way communicated to the listener ample faith, as if he or she must know who Wen Xinya was. While the latter would present to the listener an introduction with a lack of confidence. The choice between these two messages would also affect the way the listener judged her.Within seconds, Ye Mengjie answered her call. \u201cHi, Miss Wen, you\u2019ve called me at a late hour. How can I help you?\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s reply was direct. \u201cI have seen five pieces of jewelry in the shop earlier but I did not purchase them. Did you deliver them to my place by mistake?\u201dYe Mengjie responded with a chuckle. \u201cMiss Wen, you are kidding with me, aren\u2019t you? At Jo-ramst we\u2019d never make such a mistake. That five pieces of jewelry and accessories were the latest collection from the new season and were transferred to us directly from the main branch of the Wen Corporation\u2019s jewelry shop. It was originally designed to match Gu Yihan, Master Gu\u2019s five award-winning sets of clothes in Paris. They were the sculptured White-jaded rose, Pigeon-blood red ruby, South-Ocean powdered pearl, Burmese wreath gem, and South African liquid diamond. They are worth a hundred and sixty-five million dollars. The Pigeon-blood red ruby was the most expensive amongst them all. It has a 10-carat ruby and is worth eighty-five million dollars. These are gifts to Miss Wen by a Mister, and he has already paid for them.\u201dGu Yihan was the top designer in the Wen Corporation, and she had won the fashion competition championship in Paris for three consecutive years. The fashion pieces designed by her carried the unique nostalgic trend of Z-Country\u2019s style. This style was popular and highly sought after internationally.It was actually late Madam Wen\u2019s idea to cross-sell matching outfits with jewelry and accessories. All these years Wen Corporation did remarkably well with this strategy.Each of these five pieces of jewelry was highly-priced, specifically created to match Master Gu\u2019s five award-winning pieces of clothes. This cross-sell strategy worked well and saved them a huge amount of advertising fees.Wen Xinya instantly recalled the man whom the shop assistant mentioned, but she didn\u2019t put it to heart earlier. \u201cWho is that Mister?\u201d she asked. Now she found it difficult to make any linkage to this man.Ye Mengjie laughed. \u201cSorry, I\u2019m unable to disclose his identity. However, Miss Wen shall find out when the time comes. But I can let you know, it will be of great fortune to be able to know this man.\u201dWen Xinya returned coldly. \u201cAlthough I wasn\u2019t well educated, I\u2019m well aware of the concept of not accepting any form of reward that I do not deserve. I will get someone to send these back. You can decide what to do with them!\u201dIf this mysterious man had guessed that Wen Xinya would be elated to receive these pieces of expensive jewelry, then he had guessed wrong. No pain, no gain. Wen Xinya believed there must be a secret intention for sending her such expensive gifts.Ye Mengjie rubbed her forehead, thinking to herself this Miss Wen was a tough nut to crack. \u201cMiss Wen shouldn\u2019t take it to heart. One hundred and sixty-five million dollars may sound like a huge amount of money, but it\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg for that Mister. Maybe there was something about you that attracted and made him admire, hence he just randomly picked a few items as gifts for you. That\u2019s all,\u201d she persuaded.Wen Xinya did not get the answer she was seeking, but from Ye Mengjie\u2019s words, she felt a great level of suspense. If even as an employee of the Wen Corporation Ye Mengjie had chosen to hide the man\u2019s identity, there must be something going on. That man must be of higher status than the Wen Family.\u201cBuying jewelry from the Wen Corporation and sending them to me as gifts? I bet he must have some ulterior motives!\u201d she exclaimed. Everyone knew that she just returned to the Wen Family and would not be able to afford such expensive jewelry. If Grandpa, Grandma or Father found out about this matter, it would create a perfect opportunity for Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya to make a molehill out of a mountain!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYe Mengjie knew that she was carrying a heavy responsibility of convincing Miss Wen. \u201cReceiving gifts from an anonymous person would certainly cause someone to be uneasy, but I suggest you keep these pieces of jewelry properly. If you insist on returning them and unintentionally offend that Mister in the process, it won\u2019t do you or the Wen Family any good,\u201d she advised.Wen Xinya didn\u2019t feel good after hearing Ye Mengjie, but she was no longer the same Wen Xinya of her previous life. \u201cOkay, I understand. I hope you can help me keep this a secret,\u201d she requested.Ye Mengjie acknowledged with a huge sigh of relief. \u201cI will. Definitely.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone, Wen Xinya decided not to let this matter bother her anymore. She covered the big box and left it in the cloakroom. Out of sight, out of mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The servants saw her and kept as quiet as a cicada in winter. They were scared to even greet her.A few older servants got together and whispered to each other, \u201cDo you know why Madam is so angry?\u201d\u201cIt must have something to do with Miss Xinya. Since she returned to the Wen Family, Madam is never happy.\u201d\u201cThe late Madam was much nicer. When she was around, everything in the Wen Mansion was organized and smooth under her care. She discriminated one\u2019s rewards and punishments and never treated the servants badly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This Madam always takes it out on the servants. She always puts up a false front and tries to act as though she\u2019s an easygoing person, trying to imitate our late Madam.\u201d\u201cBut Master Wen buys it. We should be careful with our words from now on! Otherwise, if she hears us gossiping, who knows what evil plan she will hatch. Do you remember Mother Zhang\u2019s incident? She just happened to say something bad about Madam and was asked to leave. Even Old Master Wen was unable to help.\u201dBack in the room, Ning Shuqian advised Wen Yuya with concern. \u201cYuya, that little bitch Xinya grew up on the streets with a gangster culture. She is arrogant and despicable. Do not confront her head on in the future. We really don\u2019t know what she is capable of doing. Mother is afraid that she could do something to hurt you!\u201dWen Yuya felt sorry for herself and started crying. \u201cMother, I just can\u2019t let it go. What makes that little bitch Xinya so worthy that she is able to get so much love and attention from Grandpa when she has just returned to the Wen Family, and then immediately became the beloved Miss Wen. I have been staying in the Wen Family for 15 years, and yet, I\u2019ve got nothing. Father is also biased towards her. My monthly allowance is only 10,000 yuan, while that wretch Xinya who had been living a thug\u2019s life has a monthly allowance of 30,000 yuan.\u201dNing Shuqian gave a loud sigh. What other reason could it be other than Wen Xinya having the blood of the Wen Family flowing in her? Ning Shuqian married into the Wen Family when Yuya was only four months old. They even changed Yuya\u2019s family name to Wen. It had been 15 years. Wen Yuya might have already considered herself the real Missus of the Wen Family. It was very difficult to change her mindset.At the thought of Wen Xinya\u2019s looks and temperament greatly resembling that of her late mother, it made Ning Shuqian uneasy. Besides, she was irritated that she wasn\u2019t able to get an edge over Wen Xinya that day. She continued, \u201cYuya, she has just returned to the Wen Family and is at the peak of her time now. You will be the one losing out if you keep going against her. Let her have her way for this period. After some time she will show her true colors and start to lose Grandpa\u2019s love and attention.\u201dWen Yuya wasn\u2019t truly convinced. \u201cBut\u2026\u201dNing Shuqian gently wiped off her tears. \u201cSilly child, a chicken is a chicken, it will never become a true phoenix. To be a true Missus of an affluent family, one must acquire a good personality and temperament. What characteristics does Xinya possess?\u201dWen Yuya shook her head. \u201cBut these are skills that one could pick up. She mentioned that Grandpa will hire a teacher to teach her about etiquette, didn\u2019t she?\u201dNing Shuqian snickered. \u201cSilly child, if it was that easy to learn, then there wouldn\u2019t be any difference between high and low status in society. To display good character and temperament of a Missus of an affluent family, it must be instilled into her from a young age. It\u2019s not a simple skill that anyone can easily pick up.\u201dWen Yuya pouted and fell into Ning Shuqian\u2019s arm like a little kid. \u201cI don\u2019t care whether she\u2019s a chicken or a phoenix, I just don\u2019t want to see that little bitch Xinya again. Mother, please think of a way to get rid of her!\u201dNing Shuqian frowned. \u201cWhy are you behaving like a little kid? She is, after all, a progeny of the Wen Family. How can we just get rid of her easily?\u201dWen Yuya didn\u2019t budge. \u201cMother, you\u2019ve seen how she treated me today. She has gone against me in every way and even threw a knife at me. If she stays on I might even lose an arm or a leg.\u201dWen Yuya recalled when they were at Jo-ramst earlier, the aura Wen Xinya carried when she walked towards her made her feel suffocated. It was like she had been under her control. Every step Wen Xinya took added torture on her emotionally.There was no word to describe that feeling. She knew Wen Xinya was her nemesis in life.Once Ning Shuqian was back in her room, she was pulled into a passionate hug.Ning Shuqian interrupted their passionate moment with a concerned voice. \u201cHaowen, I met Madam Xu today. She told me a rumor concerning Xinya. I\u2019m afraid this might have a negative impact on the Wen Family\u2019s reputation.\u201d\u201cWhat is this about?\u201d Wen Haowen asked.\u201cYou know who Xu Zhenyu is, don\u2019t you? He\u2019s the second eldest son of the Xu Family!\u201cMister Xu was well known for his unruly behavior. He is one of the rich playboys in the Capital city.\u201cMadam Xu mentioned to me that Mister Xu thought he had seen Xinya at a club called Black Sunday. She was very drunk. Everyone in the Capital city has been rumoring about how arrogant and unruly she behaved,\u201d she explained. Ning Shuqian wasn\u2019t worried at all about Wen Haowen\u2019s suspicion that she couldn\u2019t get along well with Wen Xinya. One of the reasons was that she was aware of how much Wen Haowen disliked his daughter. Another reason was that she used to have a good relationship with Ruya, so it made no sense that she could get along with Ruya but couldn\u2019t tolerate Wen Xinya.Wen Haowen was always sensitive to his reputation. After hearing Ning Shuqian, his face turned sour. \u201cWhen Father found her, I took a look at how she has been living for the past 15 years and didn\u2019t agree to let her return to the Wen Family. But Father persisted on acknowledging her as part of the family. We all know what kind of a sleazy place Black Sunday is. A club filled with vices. If the media came to know about it, I don\u2019t dare imagine what they are going to write about us, destroying the Wen Family\u2019s reputation.\u201dNing Shuqian smiled. Contented with Wen Haowen\u2019s reaction, she added, \u201cHaowen, Xinya is still a child\u2026 She isn\u2019t bad to the core, probably just a little unruly in her behavior. I think if we guide her well, she should be able to\u2026\u201dWen Haowen interrupted furiously. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to speak up for her. Just look at her upbringing for the past 15 years. Cheating and stealing, getting into fights\u2026 All these are gangster behavior. She doesn\u2019t possess the quality and temperament of what a Missus from the Wen Family should have.\u201dNing Shuqian acted as if she understood the seriousness of the problem. She said in a panicked voice, \u201cThen what shall we do? The previous incident of a wrong acknowledgment to Ruya had already made an ugly impact on the Wen Family\u2019s reputation. If this time round Xinya isn\u2019t able to show some good behavior, we will definitely become a laughing stock in the high-status society.\u201dShe had hit the nail with her words. An affluent family always valued its reputation the most. Wen Haowen was exasperated. \u201cWe can\u2019t possibly lock her at home all day long and not let her go out, can we?\u201d he said.Ning Shuqian brightened up at the great idea. \u201cHow about sending her to study abroad? Let her start afresh. Xinya didn\u2019t have a chance to complete secondary education and isn\u2019t able to go to university. The education system of other countries is very different from ours. Let her experience a change in environment for a few years and give her a chance to kick all her bad habits.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Haowen thought this was an excellent idea. \u201cYes, you are right. I will discuss it with Father tomorrow,\u201d he agreed.Ning Shuqian\u2019s eyes sparkled with happiness. She added, \u201cIt will be difficult for Xinya to stay in a foreign country alone. The living expenses are high. We cannot skimp on her allowances.\u201dWith money, there would be ample opportunity of going astray.\u201cYes, of course.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On her ears were a pair of jade-rose earrings. The silver earring-findings had precious yellow jades on the tips as decoration, and they extended through these rose petals hooked onto her earlobes. These were beautiful earrings with thin translucent sculpted rose petals, quivering along as she moved.The way she dressed up made her look even more pure and elegant.Wen Xinya greeted everyone with a warm smile on her face. \u201cGrandpa, Grandma, Father and Aunt Ning, good morning!\u201dOld Mr. Wen nodded. The originally stern face had softened. \u201cCome and sit beside Grandpa,\u201d he told Wen Xinya.She walked over with a big smile.The ambiance in the living room became weird. Wen Xinya had opened up, thus Ning Shuqian and her daughter did not have an edge over her the day before. They wouldn\u2019t let the matter rest. In this family, Old Madam Wen loved her son dearly, and Wen Haowen was willing to listen to Ning Shuqian.\u201cSister, why do you wake up so late every morning. The entire family has to wait for you.\u201d Wen Yuya remarked with an evil smile.Ning Shuqian glared at her, signaling her to stop. \u201cDo not make jokes about your sister.\u201d Then she looked at Wen Xinya. \u201cXinya, do not mind your sister. You know that she has an outspoken character. Oh yes! Did you have a good night\u2019s sleep?\u201d she asked in a warm tone and with a smile.With a simple statement, she had turned Wen Yuya\u2019s original intention of a challenge into a silly joke. And with another simple sentence, she changed the topic smoothly. Wen Xinya had no reason to show displeasure towards Wen Yuya. \u201cThank you for your concern, Aunt Ning. After shopping for the whole day, I was so tired that I fell asleep very soon. All the way until this morning,\u201d she replied.Ning Shuqian slowly turned towards Wen Haowen and looked at him gently with a deeper smile.Wen Haowen glanced at Wen Xinya. She looked like a totally different person with her new outfit. She looked much more charming and elegant. But what difference would it make? Though she managed to change her outlook, it didn\u2019t mean it would also change her unrefined nature.\u201cYou are the eldest daughter of the Wen Family. Your actions and every word you say represents the Wen Family. You have just returned to the Wen Family, thus you need to be aware that some actions are considered appropriate while others are considered inappropriate. Do not display your past gangster-behavior in the family. Otherwise, it would cause a disgrace to the Wen Family.\u201d\u201cYes, Father, I understand!\u201d Wen Xinya dropped her head, feeling wronged. It must be Ning Shuqian who had spoken badly about her to Wen Haowen last night.Wen Haowen felt angry after detecting her feelings of being wronged. \u201cIf you understand, why did you visit those sleazy places? If the media finds out, they will make a molehill out of a mountain. You would then have caused damage to the Wen Family\u2019s reputation.\u201dWen Xinya was taken aback by Wen Haowen\u2019s anger. She raised her head and looked at him. There was confusion in her almond-shaped eyes, as if she did not understand what he\u2019d said. \u201cFather, did I do something wrong?\u201d she asked innocently.Wen Haowen was even more agitated by Wen Xinya\u2019s innocent look. Just when he had decided to lecture her, Old Mr. Wen interrupted with apasound by pounding the table with the newspaper in his hands. \u201cXinya is your daughter. Can\u2019t you talk things out nicely? Do you need to create a big fuss early in the morning?\u201d he reprimanded.Wen Haowen gave a quick hard stare at Wen Xinya, then looked at Old Mr. Wen with displeasure. \u201cFather, can\u2019t I even lecture her as her father? Why didn\u2019t you ask her what she has done? Now it became known to the media, that our Miss Wen is an arrogant and unrefined person.\u201d\u201cXinya has just returned home for a few days, and yet there\u2019s already bad rumors about her spreading. Did you analyze this matter with your brain? It is obvious that someone has been trying to make use of this pretext to create a big fuss.\u201dOld Mr. Wen felt disappointed in Wen Haowen. Xinya was his birth daughter, after all, his own flesh and blood. Although she had been living a wandering life outside for 15 years and there weren\u2019t many bonds between them, but he did not have any reason to detest his own daughter.Wen Haowen begged to differ. \u201cIf she didn\u2019t have a past like that, no one would be able to bad-mouth her.\u201dOld Mr. Wen sighed. \u201cRegarding Xinya\u2019s past, the Wen Family owns her much. She didn\u2019t have a choice to live like that. Let\u2019s not bring this matter up anymore.\u201dAfter finishing his sentence, Old Mr. Wen stood up and walked to the study room upstairs.\u201cFather!\u201d Wen Haowen pursued.\u201cWhat a disaster! Since you returned to the Wen Family, we have not had a day of peace.Sigh. It was a very different situation than when Ruya was around.\u201d Old Madam Wen stared hard at Wen Xinya. She followed them immediately as she was afraid that Wen Haowen and his father would start quarreling.Only Wen Xinya, Ning Shuqian, and Wen Yuya remained in the living room.Wen Yuya raised her eyebrow and seemed content at what had just happened. She said, \u201cDon\u2019t ever think you are the real Miss Wen despite having returned to the Wen Family. In this family, only Grandpa acknowledges you.\u201dWen Xinya clenched her fists so tightly that her fingers turned colorless. Her sharp fingernails pressed against her palms, the pain almost piercing through her heart. She took a deep breath and forced her tears back. \u201cI\u2019m the eldest Miss Wen. This is an undeniable truth.\u201dEvery word sounded strong and crisp. Her voice had a hidden strength that was unchallengeable. She looked cold and unshakable. Wen Yuya was stunned and didn\u2019t know how to react.\u201cWhy are you always against me? Are you jealous of me?\u201d Her expression turned from gentle to cold and unbothered, especially at the last few words.Wen Yuya unconsciously shivered and slowly recovered from her daze. Wen Xinya\u2019s words were like a sharp arrow that shot right through her heart, making Wen Yuya turn pale. She responded angrily, \u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense! Why do I have to be jealous of you? Do you know your etiquette on the dining table? Do you know social dancing? How about red wine tasting? I know all that you don\u2019t. You are just an unrefined girl, a gangster from the streets. Don\u2019t think too highly of yourself.\u201dWen Xinya smiled coldly and said, \u201cYes, I am indeed not worthy. But the title of \u2018eldest Miss Wen\u2019 is well worthy.\u201dWen Yuya suddenly jumped up from the sofa and wanted to rebuke. \u201cYou\u2026\u201dNing Shuqian held and patted Wen Yuya\u2019s hand, trying to console her. She said, \u201cThe title of \u2018eldest Miss Wen\u2019 is indeed worthy. But not everyone is able to match this title.\u201dWen Yuya realized her mother was right. Her anger was gone. She started to gloat over Wen Xinya\u2019s misfortune with a wide smile on her face. \u201cWhat is the point of arguing? There\u2019s nothing you can do. It doesn\u2019t help to put a false front. You will soon get into deep trouble.\u201dWen Yuya\u2019s words acted as a reminder to Wen Xinya. She felt a strong sense of danger coming to her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMother Wang, please get someone to send breakfast to my backyard shortly,\u201d said Ning Shuqian while pulling Wen Yuya away.Now, only Wen Xinya was left in the living room. She saw Mother Wang walking towards upstairs with breakfast in her hands. \u201cMother Wang, is this Grandpa\u2019s breakfast? Please pass it to me! I will bring it upstairs,\u201d she requested.Mother Wang gladly passed the breakfast to Wen Xinya.Wen Xinya brought breakfast to Old Mr. Wen\u2019s study room.

You are such a heartless creature! Xinya led a wandering life for 15 years. She just came back and you want to send her abroad. How can you be so ruthless?\u201d reproached Old Mr. Wen. He already knew that Wen Haowen despised Wen Xinya for her unglamorous past. But he\u2019d never expected him to be so heartless.\u201cFather, Xinya\u2019s past will definitely become the media\u2019s weapon to attack the Wen Family. I am just worried about our family\u2019s reputation.\u201d Wen Haowen argued.Old Mr. Wen held the corner of his study table firmly. The veins were clearly visible on the back of his hands. \u201cShe is just a child and has a lot to learn. We can teach her slowly. There\u2019s no need to condemn her before she even has the chance to prove herself,\u201d said Old Mr. Wen.Wen Haowen didn\u2019t expect his father to be so stubborn. Suppressing his anger, he tried explaining further. \u201cFather, I am also concerned about Xinya. She is just an ordinary child. If someone makes use of the opportunity to bring her into the limelight, how can she withstand all the criticism? If she goes abroad to study for a few years, the education she receives will also do the family and herself proud.\u201d\u201cYou sound so reasonable by saying you have good intentions for the Wen Corporation and for Xinya. Do you really think I don\u2019t know your real motives? You\u2019re just afraid that Xinya\u2019s behavior will be a disgrace to you, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Old Mr. Wen in a cold voice.Old Madam Wen added, \u201cOld man, I think what Haowen said makes sense. Xinya does have a weird temperament. I\u2019ve also heard some bad rumors about Xinya amongst some of my friends. That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t been eager to join their group activities recently. Especially that Madam Guo, she\u2019s been asking me a lot about Xinya lately. Everyone knows Xinya has had an unglamorous past. It has become a laughingstock and a topic for them to gossip about. It does no harm to send Xinya abroad and let her come back after a few years when this topic has settled down.\u201dOld Mr. Wen was extremely disappointed to see the mother and son arguing against him in synchronization. He said, \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing wrong with Xinya. She may be a dull and ordinary piece of jade now, with a bit of mischievous temperament. Given enough time and opportunities, she will become a piece of beautiful glowing jade ornament after putting in hard work.\u201dOld Mr. Wen recalled that night when Xinya stood beneath the viburnum tree, that young and beautiful face that stood out from the branches full of viburnum flowers. She looked plain and simple but had a hidden charm and poise that resembled a great deal of her late mother, Mo Yunyao.Old Madam Wen wasn\u2019t happy when she heard what he said. \u201cI can\u2019t see anything good in her. She\u2019s rough and unrefined. She even pushed Ruya into the lake. I am an old woman who has lived for more than half a century, but I have never seen any wealthy family\u2019s daughter like her, who acts violently and is full of profanity. We all know Ruya\u2019s kind and delicate nature, yet Xinya treated her so badly. It shows what a wicked person she is,\u201d she replied.Old Mr. Wen said in a frustrated tone of voice, \u201cThat\u2019s already a matter of the past, why can\u2019t you just let it go? Both Xinya and Ruya are young, getting into fights and arguments is very common for the youngsters. Who hasn\u2019t made any mistakes when they were young? When Haowen was about the age of Xinya now, he also frequently got into fights and trouble, didn\u2019t he?\u201dOld Madam Wen was speechless. Indeed, when Haowen was at that age, he was even more rebellious than Xinya.Wen Haowen saw how his father was putting in all the good words for Wen Xinya and knew he wouldn\u2019t give in easily. He finally softened his tone. \u201cFather, I know you love Xinya and couldn\u2019t bear to let her stay abroad by herself. But the media will always find a chance to hound her for having such an unglamorous past, this will be a great disadvantage to her.\u201dOld Madam Wen quickly continued, \u201cWhat Haowen said makes sense.\u201dOld Mr. Wen pointed at Old Madam Wen and Wen Haowen and said in a quivering voice, \u201cHow can you be so ruthless towards the Wen Family\u2019s own flesh and blood?\u201dOld Madam Wen was unhappy to hear that. She said, \u201cOld man, what are you saying? How are we ruthless towards her? If she behaves herself, how will I not love her? Though she has just returned to the family and isn\u2019t close to me, she has already caused so much trouble and unhappiness within the family. She\u2019s not even half as good as Ruya.\u201dOld Mr. Wen was feeling more frustrated and felt the injustice for Xinya. \u201cXinya is the true flesh and blood of the Wen Family, but all of you have been constantly showing concern only towards Ruya, calling her a few times a day asking whether she has been eating and sleeping well. On the contrary, you have been treating Xinya like an outsider. Do you think Xinya isn\u2019t aware of the way you\u2019re treating her? You said she isn\u2019t close to you. In fact, you haven\u2019t been treating her well enough,\u201d he responded.Old Madam Wen said, blushing, \u201cRuya has been by my side for the past 12 years. Even though she isn\u2019t the true daughter of the Wen Family, I still love and care about her. Though Xinya is the flesh and blood of the Wen Family, there is no relationship between us\u2026\u201dOld Mr. Wen asked angrily, \u201cSo, is not having a relationship a valid reason to send her abroad? Out of sight, out of mind?\u201d\u201cFather, this is not what Mother and I meant\u2026\u201d Wen Haowen explained frantically.Old Mr. Wen noticed the pale and expressionless look on Wen Haowen\u2019s face. \u201cShe is your own flesh and blood. No matter what happens, there\u2019s Wen Family\u2019s blood flowing in her body. How can you treat her this way? Have you lost your conscience? I think the breeze by the pillow has blown you conscience away and you cannot even differentiate between right and wrong,\u201d he commented.Wen Haowen felt embarrassed. Sending Wen Xinya abroad was indeed Ning Shuqian\u2019s idea.Old Madam Wen was always over-protective towards her son and she wouldn\u2019t let him suffer any form of humiliation. She stared at Old Mr. Wen with dissatisfaction. \u201cOld man, is this the way you should talk? Haowen manages a large corporation like the Wen Corporation successfully. Does he look like someone who isn\u2019t clear-minded?\u201dOld Madam Wen\u2019s words gave Wen Haowen some confidence. \u201cFather, why don\u2019t we ask Xinya for her opinion? Who knows, she might even agree to the idea,\u201d he said.\u201cI am telling you, Xinya is not going anywhere. She will be staying by my side. If you cannot stand it, you can move out of the Wen Mansion. As long as I\u2019m alive, you can forget about sending Xinya away.\u201d Old Mr. Wen warned coldly.\u201cOld man\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough said, leave now!\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d\u201cGet out!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Haowen could suppress his anger no more. \u201cFather, you are too stubborn. One day the reputation of the Wen Family will perish in your hands,\u201d he blurted.Old Mr. Wen laughed coldly. \u201cIf that happens, I am only destroying the Wen Family\u2019s reputation. But you want me to destroy the continuation of our family line. If you were able to provide offspring to the Wen Family, would I have spent that much effort to search for Xinya?\u201dWen Haowen was stunned. Not having another child had always been one of his biggest regrets. He had secretly gone for medical check-ups at a male-only hospital, and also let Ning Shuqian do her medical check-ups. The results had shown no problems with either of them. He wasn\u2019t totally at fault for not being able to let Ning Shuqian conceive.At this moment, Wen Haowen swung the door hard and stomped out in anger. He then saw Wen Xinya standing outside with breakfast in her hands.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had already experienced in her previous life the heartless treatment from the Wen Family. She thought she wouldn\u2019t mind this time, yet she couldn\u2019t help but feel a strong sense of humiliation, anger, and resentment.What wrong have I done? I was not given any opportunity to prove myself before I was condemned.Wen Haowen saw how plain and simple Wen Xinya dressed, and the charm and poise she possessed. The tears welling up in her eyes was as clear as the morning dew. The movement of her quivering eyelashes was like petals of a flower exposed in the cold wind of winter. She looked helpless and pitiful. He was reminded of his late wife, as if she was there standing outside the study room hearing every word he said. He instantly felt at a loss.However, that feeling of loss was quickly replaced by anger. \u201cThe adults are talking, why are you eavesdropping at the door? You have no manners,\u201d he reprimanded.Wen Xinya closed her eyes slowly. A drop of tear fell from her eyes onto her cheek and then slid down onto her lips. She could taste the bitterness and pain\u2026She told herself, this would be the last time she\u2019d shed a tear for the Wen Family.When she finally opened her eyes, she saw brightness with some refraction from the tears, like dew from the snowflake. She bitterly said, \u201cYes, I have no manners indeed. That\u2019s because of you\u2026 because the Wen Family has never raised and taught me before.\u201dTherefore you have no right to blame me for it!Wen Haowen interpreted her words and expression. He became even angrier. \u201cYou ungrateful child! Is there anything wrong with me lecturing you as your Father?\u201dWen Xinya replied plainly, \u201cFather has every right to lecture me.\u201dWen Haowen\u2019s words instantly lost power in her plain and calm reply, as if punching a piece of cotton. He swung his arms backward and stomped off.The door of the study room was opened once again. Old Madam Wen barged out in anger and saw Wen Xinya standing by the door. \u201cAll because of you, the Wen Family has not had any peace. Are you happy now?\u201d she asked coldly.Wen Xinya was flustered. She replied while shaking her head. \u201cGrandma, I\u2026\u201dJust when Old Madam Wen was going to continue with her lecture, they heard the voice of Old Mr. Wen from the study room. He sighed. \u201cXinya, come on in!\u201dWen Xinya gave Old Madam Wen an apologetic look and walked into the room dropping her head. \u201cGrandpa, you haven\u2019t had your breakfast yet. I have brought it here for you,\u201d she said.Old Mr. Wen saw sorrow on her face. She was acting with caution as if she was an outsider. He knew she heard their conversation. \u201cI have no appetite. I\u2019m not having breakfast,\u201d he answered.After some consideration, Haowen\u2019s suggestion to send Xinya abroad wasn\u2019t a bad one, even though his original intention was selfish and ruthless, and it might actually be beneficial to both the Wen Corporation and Xinya. The education system abroad was indeed better than the local one. Letting her receive education abroad and experience a different culture might do her good. It could also be a good chance for Old Mr. Wen to see if she could grow and transform into the true Wen Family\u2019s daughter, and hence be the Wen Corporation\u2019s heir.Wen Xinya lowered her head. Her eyelashes quivered and she remained silent.Old Mr. Wen sighed. \u201cXinya, would you\u2026\u201dWould you like to go abroad?Wen Xinya looked up at her Grandpa abruptly and interrupted. \u201cGrandpa, I heard from Mother Wang by chance that I have a maternal grandfather. Grampy. I think I would like to meet him.\u201dIt seemed like Grandpa was already shaken. He sounded as if he was asking for her opinion, but in his heart, he was almost convinced by Wen Haowen\u2019s suggestion. It was hard for Wen Xinya to get Grandpa\u2019s approval and support, thus she couldn\u2019t let Ning Shuqian create more obstacles by sending her abroad. Staying with her Grampy for a while might be a way out.Wen Haowen and Ning Shuqian\u2019s original intention was to send Wen Xinya abroad. However, they didn\u2019t manage to convince Grandpa, thus Ning Shuqian would definitely try other methods to get rid of her. At the thought of what Ning Shuqian did to her in her previous life, doing all she could to chase Wen Xinya out of the Wen Family, she felt bitterly disappointed and tired of having to constantly raise her guard. This probably would also give her an opportunity to avoid Ning Shuqian for the time being.After saying that, Wen Xinya felt a little more courage on her own decision. She looked at Grandpa and repeated her intention, \u201cGrandpa, I would like to stay with Grampy for a short period of time.\u201dFrom the memory of her previous life, Wen Xinya knew that her father was very afraid of her Grampy. Many had fear and respect for Grampy too, for he was highly regarded in the literary world. If she stayed with her Grampy, Wen Haowen wouldn\u2019t dare to insist his way on Wen Xinya. And no matter how scheming Ning Shuqian was, she too wouldn\u2019t insist on her way without Wen Haowen\u2019s support.Grandpa had an even greater sense of guilt towards Wen Xinya\u2019s for her understanding and making approaches to give in. If Ning Shuqian continued to hatch any evil plans in the future, Grandpa would be more decisive and firm, and not let her have her way easily.Old Mr. Wen was taken aback. The silence went on for a while, until he took a deep breath and then replied, \u201cOkay, your Grampy called me a few days ago, saying he wanted to see you. But I rejected him as you had just returned. I was planning to let you meet him after some time when you\u2019re settled. I\u2019ve not thought about\u2026\u201dHe did not continue. Wen Xinya did not mention anything about the earlier conversation in the study room, so he wouldn\u2019t bring it up either. Although Old Mr. Wen had the intention to send her abroad, he would still respect her decision. Now that she had suggested that she wanted to stay in the Mo Family, he would definitely give his approval.\u201cThank you, Grandpa! Mother Wang told me I was Grampy\u2019s only kin. I had always wanted to visit him. Now my wish has come true,\u201d said Wen Xinya with a smile, but her voice was shaking with sadness and tears in her eyes were being held back. It was as if her tears had strong determination like her, welling up in her eyes without falling down.She was saving her Grandpa from embarrassment despite her own bitterness. Old Mr. Wen had mixed feelings for his granddaughter. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s great that you can accompany your Grampy. He only had a daughter, but ever since your mother passed away, he has no other family. Previously, he and Ru\u2026 also weren\u2019t close at all.\u201d\u201cI will accompany Grampy more often and show filial piety to him on Mother\u2019s behalf,\u201d she said with resentment in her voice. She was able to see things from a different perspective after rebirth. In her previous life, it was Ning Shuqian, Wen Yuya and Xia Ruya who pushed her towards a path of no return. If the Wen Family hadn\u2019t placed the priority of their interests and benefits over everything, she could have a different outcome.Old Mr. Wen felt consoled. \u201cYou are a good child!\u201d he said.Wen Xinya continued to fight her tears in silence.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLooking at her drooping head and shoulders, Old Mr. Wen felt a sense of injustice. \u201cYour Grampy is a very knowledgeable man, I am sure you will learn a great deal from him,\u201d he continued, as if trying to further convince himself.\u201cI\u2026 I know!\u201dOld Mr. Wen pulled her into his arms, fondling her head and saying, \u201cI am old and useless. There are many things in the family that I have no say anymore, hence letting you suffer. Let me get Mother Wang to start packing for you. I\u2019ll send you over to Grampy later.\u201dWen Xinya just returned to the Wen Family. She was well aware that she had not done anything to impress her Grandpa yet. And Grandpa had doubts if she could really ditch her past and live up to everyone\u2019s expectations, becoming the true Wen Family\u2019s daughter. So he had chosen to abandon her temporarily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She felt lost!Mother Wang saw the dejected Miss Wen who was sitting on the bed. She felt sorry for her. She was the late Madam\u2019s only daughter, who led a wandering life on the streets for 15 years. Now that she\u2019s finally back to the Wen Family she was immediately being sent away.Mother Wang recalled the initial moments when Miss Wen had just returned, she was like a wounded hedgehog \u2014 impatient and helpless, always guarding against everyone in the Wen Family. Old Madam Wen only cared about Miss Ruya and neglected Miss Xinya. Ning Shuqian looked like an easy-going person but was scheming at heart. Wen Yuya and her were always making things difficult for Wen Xinya. Old Mr. Wen was also cold towards her.That day in the backyard, she saw that it was Miss Ruya who accidentally fell into the lake, but she had insisted that it was Miss Xinya who pushed her. With a few servants supporting Miss Ruya\u2019s words, Old Mr. Wen, Old Madam Wen, and Master Wen Haowen concluded it was Miss Xinya\u2019s fault and gave her a good lecture.\u201cMiss Xinya, your things are all packed.\u201dDrying her tears, Wen Xinya slowly recovered a clear vision. She saw there were two pieces of clothing and some jewelry in the cupboard. She smirked. \u201cI do not have many belongings anyway, I\u2019ll bring all the remaining items! Otherwise, I might have to trouble Grampy to buy more things for me if there\u2019s anything missing.\u201dMother Wang felt teary. \u201cMy pitiful Miss Xinya, late Madam will be watching you from the heavens. She\u2019ll bless you to have a good life,\u201d she said, feeling sorry for her.Wen Xinya recovered from her lost state. She said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s right! Mother is watching me from heaven\u2026\u201dShe must have seen the pain and suffering I had gone through, hence giving me a chance to rebirth so that I can control my own destiny.Mother Wang finished packing. Wen Xinya stared at the empty room. There wasn\u2019t anything left that belonged to her, as if she was just a guest who had rented the room. She changed her emotion and spoke lightly into the air:I will be back!Yes, she will be back!Mother Wang ordered the servants to carry Wen Xinya\u2019s luggage to the living room. Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya were there sitting on the sofa watching the busy servants carrying her luggage and stuff. They were secretly happy in their hearts.Wen Yuya asked in an elated tone, \u201cYo Sister, where are you going? Why the luggage and parcels?\u201dWen Xinya ignored her.Wen Yuya continued rubbing salt on the wound. \u201cYou\u2019ve just returned to the Wen Family for a few days and now you\u2019re leaving with your luggage. Did Grandpa chase you out?\u201dAt this moment, Old Mr. Wen was standing at the stairway on the second floor. He was so mad that it caused pain to his chest when he saw how the true Wen Family\u2019s daughter was being bullied by a lowly adopted daughter, and yet she had to suffer in silence.The nice easy-going daughter-in-law who was sitting on the sofa also looked jubilant, as if she was gloating over Wen Xinya\u2019s misfortune. \u201cDid you really wish for Xinya to be driven out of the Wen Family by me?\u201dHearing a deep and furious voice, Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya felt a chill. They looked up and saw Old Mr. Wen standing at the stairways, hearing everything Wen Yuya said earlier.Ning Shuqian could feel the authority in his eyes from afar, coupled with anger and coldness. Old Mr. Wen was known for his influence and decisiveness during his younger days. This power of authority had not reduced at all years after he had left the business world.Ning Shuqian turned pale and quickly reacted, \u201cFather, that\u2019s not what Yuya meant. She\u2019s just an innocent and outspoken child. She might have said the wrong things. Please don\u2019t hold it against her.\u201dWen Yuya froze with fear. \u201cGrandpa, I\u2026\u201dOld Mr. Wen softened slightly. He said, \u201cI am sorry to disappoint the two of you. Xinya\u2019s Grampy called and asked me to bring her over so that she can stay with him for a while. She will return.\u201dNing Shuqian was puzzled. Why wasn\u2019t she being sent abroad? Why did the plan change to her staying in the Mo Family?Ning Shuqian tried to explain. \u201cFather\u2026\u201dOld Mr. Wen had a ferocious look in his eyes. \u201cWhen Xinya is away, if you create any more trouble, you will not get away with it. Either I or someone else will take care of you.\u201dNing Shuqian shivered at the thought of how clear-minded Old Mr. Wen was. There were almost no evil intentions that could escape his eyes. She turned and looked at Wen Xinya, who was grinning with numbness. She had almost forgotten Wen Xinya had a connection with Old Mr. Mo.Ning Shuqian suddenly regretted making the suggestion to let Wen Xinya go abroad. She had unintentionally created an excuse for her to go to the Mo Family. Old Mr. Mo held high-status in the literary world and everyone feared and respected him. Going to the Mo Family would be like adding wings to Wen Xinya\u2019s back.She started panicking just at the thought of it.But she also remembered Old Mr. Mo had a cold temperament. When Ruya entered the Wen Family years ago, he didn\u2019t treat her very well. They only met during special occasions and did not have a close relationship. All these years Ruya didn\u2019t receive any benefits from the Mo Family.In comparison, Wen Xinya was even more unrefined. It\u2019s unlikely Old Mr. Mo would be nice to her, and she too wouldn\u2019t receive any benefits from the Mo Family.Old Mr. Wen looked at Wen Yuya sharply. \u201cWhatever the Wen Family has given to you, we can also take it back easily. If that ever happens, even your stepfather wouldn\u2019t be able to protect you.\u201dHe emphasized the word 'stepfather\u201d with purpose, signaling her to take his words as a severe warning.Wen Yuya turned pale with fear. She clenched her fists hard. Hatred filled her eyes. It was all that bitch, Wen Xinya\u2019s fault. Otherwise, Grandpa wouldn\u2019t treat her badly.Wen Xinya, watch and see. I will not let you die in peace!Old Mr. Wen knew what they were thinking. Xinya was away for 15 years and had an unglamorous past. She had no relationship with the Wen Family. Moreover, Old Madam Wen and Wen Haowen didn\u2019t like her. Once they succeeded in making the Wen Family detest Xinya, they would be the rightful heirs to the Wen Family\u2019s wealth.Xinya\u2019s return had triggered Ning Shuqian and her daughter\u2019s greed! And it created an opportunity for them to act in accordance with the greed within.Old Mr. Wen stomped out of the living room furiously.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya slowly walked towards Ning Shuqian and stood in front of her. She bent down and whispered into her ear, \u201cHold on, I will be back! There are\u2026 plenty of opportunities!\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s light breathing landed on her ears. It felt itchy and irritating, as if a caterpillar was crawling on her ears. Ning Shuqian said with a forced smile, \u201cXinya, I don\u2019t understand what you mean.\u201dWen Xinya came face to face with her expressionless. Her lengthy fingers pointed at her chest and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.

The Mo Mansion was a multi-story bungalow built based on a foreign style structure. It had six Ionia-styled pillars in the front porch, with all the walls painted in a cream-white color. The design was exquisite.Wen Xinya felt teary when she saw the familiar building in front of her.The Mo Family were descendants of a scholar family since the period of the Qing Dynasty. It had a much deeper heritage in comparison to the Wen Family. During the Japanese occupation, the ancestor of the Mo Family was assigned as the principal of the Capital University and was tasked to spread and educate the concept of strengthening society by studying. The Mo Family suffered relentless attacks and most of the Mo Family members were killed. When it reached Grampy, he was the only descendant of the family. Grampy had a very close relationship to Granny and he became a father at middle-age. So when Granny died of dystocia like Mother, he decided not to remarry.Although the Mo Family suffered a decline of influence, everyone still respected them. Apart from the Mo Family\u2019s deep heritage, Grampy had also established himself as an influential figure in the literary world. No one dared to show him any disrespect.In her previous life, when Wen Xinya had just returned to the Wen Family, Grampy, a white-haired old man, had fetched her over for a short stay. He saw how unrefined she was, so he decided to teach her skills in poetry, chess, and painting. He had been strict with her. At that time she thought she was already the true Wen Family\u2019s daughter and hence her behavior was arrogant and impatient. She wouldn\u2019t withstand any discipline, so she secretly returned to the Wen Family. When Ning Shuqian sowed discord afterward, her relationship with Grampy got worse.After that Grampy came to visit Wen Xinya a few times at the Wen Family. Then he suffered a heart attack and died at home, alone. His body was only discovered by his student three days later when he was unable to contact him.Wen Xinya regretted how unfilial she had been in her previous life. She decided to stay by Grampy this time and see him enjoy longevity.\u201cXinya, Xinya\u2026\u201dWen Xinya held back her tears. \u201cGrandpa!\u201dOld Mr. Wen noticed her low spirits. He recalled this morning\u2019s incident and had a sense of guilt and pity towards her. \u201cWe have arrived. What are you thinking about? You were so deep in thought that you didn\u2019t hear me calling you,\u201d he asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I just had a strong feeling when I saw this building. It seems like it has gone through the vicissitudes of life.\u201d That\u2019s right! This building had a rich heritage in history. It has witnessed the well-off Mo Family through its misfortunes, and also witnessed Grampy\u2019s lonely life.Old Mr. Wen sighed. \u201cThis bungalow has been built since the era of the warlords. From that time until the Japanese occupation, and then till the communist wars, it has been more than 90 years. It has been renovated and part of it was reconstructed several times. It\u2019s your Grampy\u2019s wish to stay here.\u201dOld Tao, the driver, opened the door for Old Mr. Wen. Wen Xinya went over and held him by his arm.Roses were growing on the black metal gate. There were red, white, peach-colored and pink roses, beautiful and magnificent. The surrounding was filled with the fragrance of fresh flowers. It was an enchanting moment.A quinquagenarian and a sharp looking white-haired old man came out together.Wen Xinya immediately recognized them. The quinquagenarian was Uncle Zhang, the housekeeper of the Mo Family, and the white-haired old man was Grampy, Mo Xianqi.Uncle Zhang quickly came to open the metal gate. He stared at Wen Xinya, who was quietly standing there, with tears welling up in his eyes. \u201cShe looks\u2026 very much alike\u2026\u201d he exclaimed.He then realized it was rude of him to let the guests stand outside. He instantly opened the gate wider and greeted them. \u201cOld Wen, Miss young lady, please come in!\u201dWen Xinya thanked Uncle Zhang with a nod and continued holding Grandpa into the courtyard. She raised her head and saw Grampy observing her from head to toe. His eyes were filled with complex emotions. She didn\u2019t know how to react.Old Mr. Wen greeted with laughter. \u201cOld Mo, we haven\u2019t seen each other for a while. You are still the same, old but strong and fit.\u201dGrandpa and Grampy were good friends when they were young. Grampy was happy to let his daughter marry into the Wen Family. However, after Wen Xinya\u2019s mother had passed away, the two families seldom saw each other.\u201cThank you!\u201d Old Mr. Mo looked stern as he stood there quietly, as sturdy as a cypress tree with a sense of unwavering pride.With just two simple words he brought Old Mr. Wen a sense of guilt. He slowly walked over, pulling Wen Xinya along, and introduced. \u201cThis is Xinya, our dear granddaughter. I\u2019ve brought her over to see you.\u201d\u201cShe looks exactly like Yao-er, from looks to behavior.\u201d Old Mr. Mo looked carefully at his granddaughter, who was standing behind the gate that was full of roses. Wen Xinya was wearing a light-green peach-blossomed dress with green jade gems accessories. She just stood there quietly. Old Mr. Mo recognized his granddaughter at the very first sight because she resembled greatly her late mother. This was probably the power of kinship.These words of affirmation gave her confidence. She recovered instantly from her daze and greeted. \u201cGrampy!\u201d\u201cGreat! Great! Great!\u201d He was overjoyed and said the word \u2018great\u2019 consecutively three times with complex emotions. He touched her hair with his trembling hands, unable to control his intense feelings.Tears welled up in Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes again.Seeing this scene of how Grampy was overjoyed to see his granddaughter again, Old Mr. Wen was touched by the power of kinship.Years ago when Ruya came to visit Old Mr. Mo, he didn\u2019t like her. No matter how Ruya tried to please him, he had always given her the cold shoulder. Their relationship turned sour over time.Old Mr. Mo turned to Uncle Zhang and said, \u201cOld Zhang, get the servants to carry Miss Wen\u2019s luggage to her room, and bring her back to rest.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, Grampy! Please have a chat while I go to my room to unpack.\u201d She followed Uncle Zhang obediently into the bungalow. She excused herself and left the two elders to their chat.On the way back to her room, Uncle Zhang was observing this new Young Mistress who had just returned. To his surprise, Young Mistress was very much different from the rumors he had heard about her. Instead of behaving in an unrefined manner, she was as graceful as her late mother, observing her new environment in the bungalow. It showed that she was a respectful and observant person.Uncle Zhang remembered when Xia Ruya first came over. Though she looked classy and presentable, she didn\u2019t look like Mistress at all. Xia Ruya had a sense of greed in her eyes when she saw the exquisite design and expensive furniture in the house. This made Old Mr. Mo extremely disappointed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNever did they expect that she was actually an imitation. Fortunately, Old Mr. Mo was wise enough to not to be deceived by her.Uncle Zhang looked at the Young Mistress in front of him again. She was the true daughter of the late Mistress, backed by a DNA test result. She was indeed the offspring of the Wen and Mo Families, hence she had a unique temperament. \u201cYoung Mistress, that room in front belonged to the late Mistress. Old Master Mo has instructed me to clean it up for your stay,\u201d he informed.Wen Xinya looked up and saw a blooming viburnum tree dancing gracefully in the wind. The petals were beautiful like snow. It was such a magnificent and enchanting moment.White can be enchanting too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She planted this viburnum tree in front of her room at a very young age. You are her daughter, no wonder you like viburnum flowers so much. It has since been more than 30 years.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d The viburnum tree in the Mo Family\u2019s bungalow was more beautiful than the one in the Wen\u2019s mansion. Grampy had been taking good care of it since it was her Mother\u2019s favorite.Uncle Zhang led Wen Xinya into the room. \u201cYoung Mistress, please feel free to let me know if you need anything else,\u201d he said.\u201cThank you, Uncle Zhang,\u201d said Wen Xinya, thankful.Uncle Zhang ordered the servants to unpack Wen Xinya\u2019s luggage. \u201cThe Wen Family was too much. Young Mistress is back for not more than a week and yet she has so little belongings with a few pieces of jewelry. There isn\u2019t even a piece of representable jewelry.\u201dWen Xinya felt warmth in her heart. In her previous life, Uncle Zhang had treated her well too, but she didn\u2019t take it to heart. He returned back to his own village soon after for personal reasons.Wen Xinya looked around the room. There was a huge bed made of agarwood, its dark wooden surface shining with polish. The natural wood markings and chiseled marks were uneven but beautiful. Mild crack lines extended around the surface, and she could smell the mild fragrance of the agarwood.Agarwood has a unique fragrance smell, which was commonly known for its ability to ward off evil, boost mental consciousness, maintain health, keep bugs away and even keep the wood dry from moisture. This type of wood is less commonly found nowadays.This huge bed made of agarwood was a dowry for Granny\u2019s wedding years ago.Granny was from the Ren Family, who was also of influential status in the literary world. The ancestors of the Ren Family used to be officials with high-status in the court. The two families, Ren and Mo, had close relationships and the Ren Family also suffered a similar fate as the Mo Family. The Ren Family did not have any descendants at present.The dressing table, boxes, and combs were a complete set of dowry made from yellow rosewood. This type of wood was the most expensive of Z Country\u2019s top four wood and it was very valuable.The cloakroom was hidden behind an embroidery screen with flowers and birds. Its size was about 30 square meters!She felt enchanted as if she had walked into an exquisite harem of ancient times!She could see Grampy\u2019s love for Mother everywhere in the bungalow.She recalled in her previous life when she came to Grampy\u2019s house for the first time, she didn\u2019t know how valuable the dowry was. Grampy was furious when she accidentally broke one of the combs made with yellow rosewood.At that time, she was angry about Grampy\u2019s reaction. \u201cIt\u2019s just another lousy comb, isn\u2019t it? What\u2019s so fabulous about it?\u201dGrampy was infuriated. She ran away and went back to the Wen Family on the same day.In this lifetime she could better understand why Grampy was furious. This yellow rosewood set was Granny\u2019s dowry and belonged to Granny and Mother for two generations. Now that Granny and Mother were gone, these items were full of sentimental values, thus Grampy treasured them. Hence, when Wen Xinya didn\u2019t value these items he was sad and devastated.Moreover, Grampy had acknowledged and loved her dearly, unlike others who thought she was unrefined. Therefore, he had willingly passed these valuable items to Wen Xinya. But she didn\u2019t treasure them and broke the comb instead, thus disappointing him.Grampy was the only one in the world who really cared about her.Wen Xinya touched the jewelry box on the dressing table carefully. Then she touched the comb and put it into the jewelry box with great care.She turned around and saw Grampy at the door, looking at her. She greeted him cheerfully. \u201cGrampy!\u201d\u201cThis room belonged to your Mother, do you like it?\u201d he asked. His mixed emotions earlier had turned into joy and consolation when he saw how she treasured and carefully handled the items that belonged to her Mother. This scene reminded him of his late wife and daughter.\u201cYes, I like it! When I just stepped in I had a moment of confusion, as if I had stepped into a different time. I felt like I was a Mistress from ancient times.\u201d She spoke with astonishment as she looked around and observed the decoration of the room.\u201cThis room was decorated by your Granny. Most of the decorations are part of your Granny\u2019s dowry. When your Mother got married years ago, I had the intention of sending them to the Wen Family, but your Mother refused. She wanted the items to stay and keep me company.\u201d He had realized that fortunately these items weren\u2019t sent to the Wen Family. Otherwise, it would have benefitted someone else.\u201cWhen Mother got married, Grampy was the only one left in this bungalow. If there was nothing left for you, you would feel lonely.\u201d Wen Xinya seemed to understand her Mother\u2019s intentions.Old Mr. Mo let go of the stern look on his face. He said, \u201cThe decoration in this room was according to your Mother\u2019s liking. You can rearrange them if you like.\u201dWen Xinya took a quick glance at each corner of the room and then shook her head. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. I like it. The decorations here represented Grampy and Granny\u2019s efforts and love for Mother. I wouldn\u2019t want to change it.\u201dOld Mr. Mo frowned and said, \u201cI heard from Uncle Zhang that you did not bring a lot of belongings over. If there\u2019s anything you need, just let him know and he\u2019ll get it for you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Grampy!\u201d Wen Xinya nodded.Old Mr. Mo smiled. \u201cThis is also your home, you can stay here comfortably. There are not too many restrictions around here. Grampy is no stranger.\u201dThis time Wen Xinya couldn\u2019t control her tears anymore. Soon, she started crying. \u201cYes, Grampy!\u201dOld Mr. Mo pulled Wen Xinya into his arms and patted her back with his wrinkled hands. \u201cThese few years it has been hard on you.\u201dSometimes, feelings about someone can be strangely accurate. When Grampy first saw Xia Ruya, he had negative feelings about her. Even though she presented herself well at a young age, but there was greed in her eyes.He was disappointed whenever he thought about the negative feelings his granddaughter gave him, and over time their relationship remained plain. Little did he expect that this person who gave him a bad feeling wasn\u2019t his true granddaughter.Xinya was a good child. The Wen Family thought she was unrefined and did not see the good in her.Wen Xinya cried uncontrollably in Grampy\u2019s arms.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOld Mr. Mo could feel her suffering. \u201cIt does not matter whether the Wen Family loves you or not. You can stay with Grampy as long as you like. You are Grampy\u2019s only kin, I will not let you suffer anymore,\u201d he said.Wen Zhihang was someone who only cared about monetary benefits. Qin Shulan was selfish. Wen Haowen was heartless. Her stepmother Ning Shuqian was cunning. While her stepsister Wen Yuya was arrogant. And then there was also Xia Ruya, who was a scheming person. The Wen Family was a place full of danger indeed.\u201cI got it, Grampy!\u201d Wen Xinya was touched. She couldn\u2019t understand her foolish behavior and why she chose to treat Grampy badly under Ning Shuqian\u2019s influence in her previous life. She took Grampy\u2019s love for granted and hurt him terribly, causing him a miserable death while she focused all her energy to gain the trust and love of the Wen Family.In this lifetime she would not let Grampy get hurt again. She would protect those she loved and those who loved her. She would not let Grampy go through that painful experience again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although the memory had long faded, he vividly remembered Yao-er wearing a white long dress with a pink butterfly knot tied to her waist.He remembered they sat beneath a tree and the little girl kept asking, \u201cFather, Father, when will the viburnum tree grow taller?\u201d\u201cFather, Father, it was mentioned in the books that the petals of viburnum flowers are big, pure as jade and look magnificent when they blossom. The center of a viburnum flower looks like a white pearl, surrounded by five petals and the flowers grow in multiples of eight. The books described it as beautiful as butterflies surrounding the pearl, thus it was also known as butterfly flower. There\u2019s also another name\u2014the eight deities flower because it also resembled eight deities dancing elegantly. Liu Chang expressed in his poem: Millions of oriental plants competing for distinction, but none can compete with the viburnum flower! I wonder when we can see the flowers blossom?\u201dMore than 30 years had passed, and this viburnum tree had grown and blossomed with the most beautiful flowers. It was just as innocent as the smile on the face of the little girl who danced around this tree years ago.The servants gathered around and their conversations could be heard from a distance away.\u201cYoung Mistress really resemble the late Mistress in terms of looks and temperament. She\u2019s very different from Wen Ruya. When Wen Ruya first came to the Mo Family, though she looked obedient and adorable, her rounded eyes seemed to harbor evil intentions. It just made us feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. Every time she visited the Mo Family\u2019s bungalow, she had her eyes on the valuable antiques. We all knew she wasn\u2019t a simple girl.\u201d\u201cWe really didn\u2019t like the way she behaved. Though she was such a young girl, she always displayed arrogance as if she was above us all. There wasn\u2019t any resemblance of the late Mistress. I already had a strong feeling that she wasn\u2019t the late Mistress\u2019 child.\u201d\u201cStop saying nonsense. How can she even be compared to Mistress? Both Old Master Mo and the late Old Madam are descendants from literary families. They value virtue above anything else. Mistress had been brought up in such a positive environment, thus she had acquired good virtues and ethics. How can that wild sparrow have the same quality standards just because she was lucky enough to enter a phoenix\u2019s nest?\u201d\u201cExactly, she\u2019s just a wild sparrow.\u201dAt this point, everyone felt contempt for this person and stopped commenting.\u201cUncle Zhang, do you know what\u2019s Young Mistress\u2019 favorite food? So that we can prepare some. The late Mistress used to like to eat dessert after a meal, do you know if Young Mistress has the same habit? Oh no\u2026 youngsters nowadays prefer to remain slim, they might not like to eat dessert, especially at night\u2026\u201d\u201cI saw that Young Mistress is very skinny. She must have suffered during all these years. Let me prepare some red date black chicken soup to give her some nourishment.\u201d\u201cThere was a student of Old Master who gave him wild ginseng as a gift. I heard it was extracted from the Baekdu Mountains. Shall I add some of this ginseng and angelica to the soup? It\u2019ll greatly enhance the nutritional value.\u201d\u201cI think not! Young Mistress is still young, over-nourishment might not do her good. Maybe she should drink more soup filled with different vitamins, and over time her health will improve.\u201dUncle Zhang was gladdened to see everyone\u2019s excitement. They had started to prepare for dinner early that day. \u201cLet me check with Young Mistress what\u2019s her favorite dishes. Please carry on with the preparation. Don\u2019t forget about Old Master\u2019s favorite dishes too. He must be elated about Young Mistress coming home today and may have a good appetite,\u201d he said.\u201cExactly right. Since Mistress left, I\u2019ve not seen Old Master as happy as today. I hope Young Mistress can continue to stay here as long as possible.\u201d\u201cWe never know, Young Mistress may be staying here for good. Look at the way the Wen Family treated her. I doubt Old Master will let her return to the Wen Family and let her suffer.\u201dOld Master Mo never imagined the Mo Family would be this lively again. Wen Xinya\u2019s return had an ecstatic effect on the dead and silent Mo\u2019s bungalow.Uncle Zhang looked up and noticed Old Master Mo standing at a distance away from them, thus he immediately walked towards his Master.\u201cOld Zhang, come and take a walk with me!\u201d Old Master Mo said plainly.Uncle Zhang agreeably walked beside him.Old Master Mo abruptly commented. \u201cShe is a good child.\u201dUncle Zhang smiled. \u201cYes, indeed. Young Mistress has a good temperament. Though she does not have the virtues of late Mistress yet, I can see the potential of turning her into a great piece of gem with some training.\u201dOld Master Mo laughed. \u201cYes, you are right. I think she has a stronger character than Yao-er. Though Yao-er had good virtues, she had an unyielding character with no intention to compete for anything. She did not even fight for the man she loved, thus losing his love for her. Xinya is quite unlike her Mother. When I found out from Old Mr. Wen she was the one who wanted to come and stay with the Mo Family, I knew she was different!\u201dWen Xinya knew how to make concessions in order to gain some advantages, and not everyone could do it as well as her.\u201cYoung Mistress led a wandering life starting a very young age. She has been through hardships and sufferings. Therefore, she knows better how to protect herself. The late Mistress grew up under your care. She never had to experience the cruelty of the outside world and hence became an unyielding and less petty-minded person.\u201dOld Master Mo sighed. \u201cYour observation makes good sense.\u201dUncle Zhang responded with a smile.Old Master Mo felt emotional. \u201cDuring my younger days, my mother brought me to a fortune-teller. He told me I am the reincarnation of the Star of Wisdom. He said I would achieve great success in life, but my kinship with my family would suffer a different fate and I am destined to be alone. I was young then and chose not to believe in destiny. Who would have expected both Yuqian and Yao-er to die from dystocia, and my only granddaughter went missing. I had no choice but to resign to fate. When I saw in her eyes the trust and faith Xinya has in me, I knew that was the family bond I was waiting for. Though I am not blessed to have many children and grandchildren, having the accompany of one granddaughter is all I can ask for,\u201d he said.What Old Master Mo didn\u2019t know was, he did die a lonely death in her previous life.Uncle Zhang saw the look of satisfaction in Old Master Mo\u2019s eyes. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in destiny either. However, I believe a good person will be rewarded. You are a well-respected person and will be blessed with good fortune.\u201d\u201cIn fact, due to my negative experience with Xia Ruya, this time I did not carry high hopes for Xinya either. Though I was aware she returned to the Wen Family recently, I only watched her closely from far away. I didn\u2019t do much other than that and let the poor child suffer in the Wen Family,\u201d Old Master Mo said with regret, knowing his granddaughter was almost driven out from the Wen Family.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUncle Zhang frowned and agreed. \u201cThe Wen Family fetched Young Mistress back but did not treat her well. When I saw the servants unpack her luggage, she had very little belongings. I feel sorry for Young Mistress.\u201dOld Master Mo\u2019s face turned sour. \u201cThe people in the Wen Family have always placed their own benefits as the priority. Xinya has an unglamorous past, thus the Wen Family naturally won\u2019t accept her. Moreover, she has a stepmother and stepsister with evil and greedy intentions. They will definitely hatch some plans to make the people in the Wen Family detest her while she doesn\u2019t have any strong relationships with the family. In this way, they will become the rightful heirs to the Wen Family\u2019s wealth!\u201dUncle Zhang sighed. \u201cYoung Mistress\u2019 fate is pitiful. She started leaving a stray life at a young age. Finally, when she had the opportunity to reunite with the Wen Family it turned out to be a dragon and tiger\u2019s den. One wrong move and it could cause her to go on a path of no return.\u201dOld Master Mo said coldly, \u201cIt depends on how Xinya sees it.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thus, in the afternoon, she stayed in her room, drawing, and writing, thinking and thinking as time flew by.It was only because Uncle Zhang came personally to call for her that she even knew it was time for dinner.The Mo Family\u2019s dining hall and kitchen were only partitioned by a wall, separating the rooms from the great hall. This detail followed the specialty of the ancient architectural style.Upon arriving at the dining hall, Grampy was sitting at a long table made of Nanmu wood. Two servants sat at the table too, approximately at the 50 years old mark. Wen Xinya recognized them at a glance. That was Mother He and Mother Jiang; they were both old servants of the Wen Family. They had served Granny in the past, then they brought up Mother safely. Grandpa was grateful to them, so he never once treated them like servants.In her past life, when she came to the Mo Family, these two Mothers were extremely kind to her. But at the time, she was arrogant and viewed herself highly, thus looking down on them. She did not even want to eat at the same table as them. Grampy was beyond angry at her attitude, but they had never truly gotten mad at her, always letting her have her way and endured her temperament. Subsequently, because of her attitude towards them, Grampy felt guilty and embarrassed. He gave each of them a sum of money and requested them to return to their home villages. That was the reason why Grampy had such a miserable ending.In this life, seeing them again, Wen Xinya was very pleased, because that means that in this life there were two more people to love her!\u201cLittle\u2026 Little Miss!\u201d Mother He and Mother Jiang saw Wen Xinya staring at them, and for a moment, they did not know what they should do or how they should act. They were scared and immediately stood up. They knew it was not the norm for servants and masters to eat at the same table. However, after all these years, their lonely old Master ate alone, so when he asked them to join him they did not refuse.Since Little Miss is back, Old Master has someone to eat with. Naturally, he would not require their presence.Old Master Mo raised his brows toward Wen Xinya as an introduction. \u201cThis is Mother He and Mother Jiang. Back in the day, they served your Granny. Thanks to them, your mother grew up well, thus they are not strangers. The Mo Family does not have so many rules.\u201dWen Xinya smiled at them. \u201cMother He, Mother Jiang, hello! Please sit!\u201dMother He and Mother Jiang\u2019s eyes were as wide as saucers, feeling flattered. \u201cLittle Miss, hurry and sit. We don\u2019t know what you like to eat so we intended to ask Old Zhang, but he said you were busy the whole afternoon. Hence, we did not disturb you and simply made some of our signature dishes, but we are not sure if it is to your liking.\u201dLittle did they know that the Little Miss was so approachable and did not mind the status of servants, just like their Missy. She was not like Wen Ruya, that thought herself too highly to even eat at the same table as them.Wen Xinya looked at the nine dishes and the soup on the table and smiled. Every dish was exquisite. \u201cThe dinner is luxurious. I\u2019m sure it will be delicious.\u201dIt was indeed sumptuous, despite only having nine dishes and a soup. However, these were the eight signature dishes of Country Z. Furthermore, the dishes complemented one another, showing the effort put into making the whole dinner.Attaining affirmation, Mother He and Mother Jiang happily took up their chopsticks and starting piling Wen Xinya\u2019s bowl with food. \u201cLittle Miss, you have to eat a lot. You have gone through a lot of hardships outside. Look at how skinny you are! Though girls look good when they are skinny, you are still going through puberty. You must not ruin your body just to look pretty or you will not be able to fix it next time.\u201dWen Xinya looked at her bowl which was filled with a mountain of food and felt her eyes water, holding back her tears stubbornly. She took a pile of vegetables and served it into Grampy\u2019s bowl. \u201cGrampy, you eat too.\u201d\u201cMother He, Mother Jiang, don\u2019t just serve me food, you eat too!\u201d Having that said, she also served food into their bowls.Old Man Mo and Uncle Zhang were beyond happy.Cough cough!Uncle Zhang looked at the empty bowl before him and softly coughed twice.Wen Xinya smiled, still in tears, and served him a piece of pork. \u201cUncle Zhang, you eat too. This slice of pork is not only rich in vitamins, but it can also beautify you. Do eat more.\u201dMother He laughed. \u201cLook at that flowery face of his. If he eats any more pork, it will only be a waste.\u201dMother Jiang agreed. \u201cI\u2019d rather keep it for Little Miss to eat. She will definitely grow up to be a fair lady.\u201dWith words like that, Uncle Zhang\u2019s reputation was no more. \u201cGreat, all of you just make fun of me.\u201dThe whole house was filled with sounds of happiness and laughter, making Old Man Mo feel whole again. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long since the house was this lively.\u201dOld Man Mo\u2019s words quietened the atmosphere.Wen Xinya smiled. \u201cEveryone, let\u2019s dig in. The food is getting cold. Grampy, let\u2019s eat.\u201dThe way Wen Xinya ate was somewhat elegant. She did not need to hide in the Mo Family.Old Man Mo watched her every move as she ate, surprised at her grace and elegance. He sure was surprised, but it allowed him to dwell in quiet understanding that Wen Xinya was not the shallow person the magazines described.Uncle Zhang also had a fleeting moment of surprise.Only Mother He and Mother Jiang did not think much of it because, in their hearts, Missy was as such, so Little Miss naturally was as such.Very soon, Old Man Mo and the rest soon learned of Wen Xinya\u2019s eating behavior. They looked at the remaining vegetables and the empty platter of meat and felt their hearts swell tremendously.Wen Xinya helped herself to another bowl of rice. Mother He and Mother Jiang could not eat anymore and gently placed their chopsticks down. This was Little Miss\u2019 third bowl of rice. Every bowl was filled to the brim and when she was done eating, there was not a single grain of rice left.It was not known when it started to be a trend for the ladies in the established households to leave half a bowl of rice, as though it showed how rich and classy they were. There was no missus who was like their Little Miss.Old Man Mo held the chopsticks in his hand, trembling just a bit, unable to take in any more food.Uncle Zhang stared at Wen Xinya. Once she started eating, it was as though she was deep in concentration. His heart swelled uncomfortably.Wen Xinya was eating happily until she felt everyone\u2019s gaze upon her. She lifted her head and said, \u201cWhy has everyone stopped eating? Don\u2019t just stare at me eat!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMother Jiang forced a smile. \u201cWe are simply happy to see that you enjoyed the dishes we made.\u201dWen Xinya vaguely understood why they were being like that and smiled shyly. \u201cThe dishes that Mother He and Mother Jiang made are delicious. I have never eaten something this delicious before. At the Wen Family, I did not dare to openly eat to my heart\u2019s content. My appetite is larger than most, so I usually only feel satisfied after three bowls\u2026\u201d Nearing the end, she felt guilty. At this age, which family\u2019s daughter would have such a big appetite?Old Man Mo was not happy. \u201cJust eat what you want. The Mo Family has enough to feed your appetite. We at the Mo Family are not as pretentious as the Wen Family.\u201d After saying that, he looked towards Uncle Zhang, then to Mother He and Mother Jiang. \u201cYou all as well. Whoever does not eat three bowls worth of rice will not be allowed to leave the table.\u201dWen Xinya did not know whether to laugh or cry. This is the feeling of a family! Wen Xinya felt comfortable, unknowingly letting down her walls and showing them her truest self.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She pulled the curtain that was embroidered with flowers and birds and gently opened the windows. An extended branch from the viburnum tree, beautiful with pure white flowers, appeared in front of her. Wen Xinya stretched herself out from the window and sniffed. She could smell the morning dew that carried a mild fragrance from the viburnum flowers. She felt refreshed as the fragrance captured her heart.She went to the bathroom to wash up after some light stretching. After 20 minutes she was in her tracksuit. She then went out from the back gate of the Mo Family\u2019s bungalow and started jogging along the main road behind the bungalow.In her previous life, she smoked and abused drugs and alcohol, seriously degrading her health. After her rebirth, she knew better than anyone that health was the most important asset that one could have.After jogging for about an hour, Wen Xinya returned to the bungalow almost out of breath.After a bath and changing into new clothes, she heard Mother He calling her, \u201cYoung Mistress, breakfast is ready.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be out in a while.\u201d Wen Xinya looked at the young lady in the mirror. She looked young and healthy and had rosy cheeks after a good exercise. She smiled at her own reflection with satisfaction and stepped out of the room.Grampy and the rest were sitting around the dining table. Wen Xinya greeted everyone cheerfully. \u201cGood morning, Grampy, Uncle Zhang, Mother He, Mother Jiang!\u201dOld Master Mo saw her rosy cheeks and her beautiful eyes that gleamed with high spirits. He then commented with a smile, \u201cUncle Zhang mentioned you were up early to exercise. This is a very good habit. Maintaining a healthy body is good preparation for the fight ahead!\u201dWen Xinya stuck her tongue out. \u201cHmm, I know! Maintaining a healthy body is like having good capital for the fight ahead!\u201dAfter breakfast, Wen Xinya accompanied Grampy on a stroll in the backyard. Though both remained silent, Wen Xinya enjoyed the peaceful ambiance.There was an indus tree in the backyard. The tree trunk had no burl, standing tall and huge. It had jade green leaves that branched out like a huge umbrella, looking majestic and magnificent. This indus tree had been through many seasons and remained sturdy. During spring and winter, its fallen leaves experienced the joy of integration with mother nature; during summer and autumn, it displayed its power of influence by providing shade under the heat. Indus tree knew the \u201cleap year\u201d and \u201cautumn\u201d. It also had a beautiful, legendary story. It was said that the Phoenix only landed on an indus tree. It was no ordinary tree.Old Master Mo asked, \u201cXinya, how do you see the Wen Family?\u201dWen Xinya replied plainly, \u201cI will definitely return to the Wen Family.\u201d\u201cDo not force yourself. If you don\u2019t wish to return you can stay with Grampy! Though Grampy might not be able to give you a huge amount of wealth, I will not provide you less than the Wen Family can. With Grampy\u2019s care and protection, nobody from the Wen Family can bully you.\u201d Old Master Mo looked at her innocent face, thinking how could he let his young granddaughter go back to the dragon and tiger\u2019s den and suffer the fate of constant power struggle.Wen Xinya looked at Grampy with persistence in her eyes. \u201cGrampy, I have already been to the dragon and tiger\u2019s den. I will fight for what belongs to me. This is my principle in life and I will not give in easily by hiding behind your protection. I will become a tall and strong tree that no one is able to uproot. The people in the Wen Family can insult, ridicule, laugh or scold me. But I will prove to them that I am the one and only irreplaceable daughter of the Wen Family,\u201d she said.She wanted those who had done her wrong to get what they deserved!\u201cGreat! This is how my granddaughter should be!\u201d Old Master Mo felt consoled. If Wen Xinya had chosen to stay by his side, he would naturally continue to shower her with love and care. Now that she had chosen a different path, a path that would display her courage, he already perceived her differently.There was a sparkle in Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes. \u201cOf course! I am a tiger granddaughter who took after a tiger Grampy.\u201dOld Master Mo couldn\u2019t hide his laughter. \u201cYou little girl. Look at the way you\u2019ve put it.\u201dWen Xinya replied, \u201cYou know what I meant.\u201dOld Master Mo sighed. \u201cXinya, you are much stronger than your mother. She hated and avoided power-struggles, that\u2019s why she ended up with nothing. It is only natural to compete for power in the human world. However, Grampy hopes that you do not lose your good heart in the presence of wealth and power. Do not be discouraged by failure, and do not become unscrupulous in order to achieve your goals.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll remember that, Grampy.\u201d From her previous life experience, Wen Xinya understood the importance of the lesson Grampy was trying to teach her. In her previous life, she had a bad ending because she lost her good heart.Old Master Mo patted her hand with satisfaction. \u201cWhat are your plans?\u201d\u201cI have drafted a plan for my own education. I want to complete my Secondary School Level Three\u2019s studies in six months. In this way, I will be able to return to school in six months,\u201d replied Wen Xinya.Old Master Mo frowned in doubt. \u201cWithin six months? Are you sure?\u201d\u201cYes, I am absolutely sure!\u201d Wen Xinya was confident in herself because she had already been through the courses for Secondary School in her previous life. Though her results weren\u2019t excellent, but given a chance to learn again, she would be able to do it better this time. She had a good memory in her previous life, and she realized she had a better memory after rebirth. She was able to memorize simple articles just by reading them once. For articles with a higher level of difficulty, she might take two to three attempts before memorizing them. With the gift of good memory, it was almost like cheating.\u201cRegarding learning, you can take it easy.\u201d Though Old Master Mo hoped that she could achieve good results in her education, he didn\u2019t want her to be over-ambitious.Wen Xinya looked at Grampy with confidence and sincerity. \u201cGrampy, you gotta believe that your granddaughter isn\u2019t so weak.\u201dSeeing the firmness in her eyes, Old Master Mo recalled the natural charisma she displayed during dinner the previous night, thus his confidence in her grew. \u201cGrampy believes in you,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya saw the trust in Grampy\u2019s eyes. It reminded her of how the Wen Family had rejected her. She started to understand and realize that if someone truly loved her, he would believe in her no matter what.Suddenly, Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes glowed. \u201cGrampy, why don\u2019t you teach me about chess and music? In fact, I am very intelligent. Please give me some guidance,\u201d she requested.Old Master Mo was taken aback by her ambition. \u201cYou want to complete three years\u2019 worth of courses together with chess and music? That\u2019s being too greedy. All these courses and activities take years to master and are best taught from a young age. You\u2019re now overaged. If you can\u2019t master anything, that is equivalent to not learning at all,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya pulled Grampy\u2019s arm coquettishly. \u201cGrampy, setting big goals can greatly increase learning efficiency. I have to start learning as much as I can. Moreover, I am your granddaughter. Though I\u2019m starting late, I have the intelligence. Who knows? I might be able to pick these skills up within a short time!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOld Master Mo finally gave in. \u201cSince you have the intention to learn, I\u2019ll teach you. You\u2019ll realize what is called \u2018hard work\u2019.\u201dWen Xinya was elated and she kissed Grampy on his cheek.\u201dThank you, Grampy! You are the best!\u201dOld Master Mo remembered that Yao-er growing up had not been this close to him. He was confused by Wen Xinya\u2019s playful temperament.Right at this moment, Uncle Zhang walked towards them. \u201cMaster, Mr. Du is here. He is waiting for you at the living room,\u201d he said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The ancient-style decorated bungalow was filled with antiques. The furniture and shelves were made with Phoebe Zhennan wood, and these shelves had numerous valuable antiques and ancient jades on display. There was an agarwood tea table on one side. On the tea table was an exquisite Ruku porcelain tea set. It was as clear as a piece of crystal jade.On the wall was an eye-catching piece of an ancient antique painting by the famous painter of the Ming Dynasty, Dong Qichang. It was named \u201cSnowy Guan Mountain\u201d. In this painting, the mountains were magnificent and had a three-dimensional effect. It also had a deep and borderless forest. The brush strokes were thick and powerful, commanding a sense of strength and authority.There was a traditional Chinese chess set beside the windows. The chess board was made with purple rosewood, with black and white pieces of chess seeds made of jade that glowed with purity under the warm sunlight.Wen Xinya took a deep breath. The Mo Family was considered an affluent family, and they valued good virtues and were uncorrupted. Though they possessed a good amount of valuables and antiques, they appreciated the traditional values rather than the monetary values.Mr. Du sat beside the tea table on a chair made with Phoebe Zhennan wood. As he started brewing tea, the room was instantly filled with fragrance from the tea leaves.Old Master Mo walked over with Wen Xinya and introduced. \u201cXinya, this is Du Shinan. You may call him Grandpa Du. He is an influential figure in the world of Traditional Chinese Medicine.\u201d He then turned over and introduced Wen Xinya to Du Shinan. \u201cThis is my granddaughter, Wen Xinya.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Du, nice to meet you!\u201d Du Shinan seemed to be older than Grampy by a few years, with grey hair and a long beard. Indeed, he seemed to be very knowledgeable and looked like someone of high and influential status. She had a positive feeling about the relationship between the two elders.Grampy did the same thing in her previous life. He had also invited the highly-respected Old Doctor Du to check on Wen Xinya\u2019s health by taking her pulse diagnostically the very next day after her arrival in the Mo Family.Du Shinan looked at Wen Xinya from head to toe. She looked beautifully plain and innocent. She had a tall and slim figure, with long, thin limbs like the branches of a tree. Elegant yet enchanting. She wore a long white dress with silver flowers scattered all across, colorful and brilliant.Her plain and innocent look matched her bright dress, which beautifully contrasted her temperament.Du Shinan carefully placed the purple teapot on the table. \u201cShe has the good qualities of a Mo Family\u2019s offspring,\u201d he commented while stroking the beard below his chin, nodding his head with satisfaction.Du Shinan was reminded of Wen Ruya, whom he thought did not possess any good virtues.Wen Xinya was happy to receive such comments. This was a good affirmation for her. In her previous life, Old Doctor Du only checked her pulse diagnostically but did not say anything.Old Master Mo pulled Wen Xinya to the Phoebe Zhennan wooden chairs beside the tea table. \u201cOld Du, you\u2019re early today,\u201d he said.Du Shinan took a quick glance at him. \u201cYou called me early in the morning and asked me to come over to check your granddaughter\u2019s pulse. You\u2019ve expected me to come early, didn\u2019t you?\u201d he said while using the first brew of hot tea to rinse the Ruku porcelain teacups with a pair of wooden tweezers.Cough, cough!Old Master Mo pretended to cough as he felt embarrassed by his remark.Wen Xinya thought it was funny, but she put up a serious expression and observed closely what Grandpa Du was doing. She thought Country Z\u2019s tea ceremony was profound and was very interested.Du Shinan noticed her interest and how focused she was. He then intentionally slowed down.It was his smooth actions that captured Wen Xinya\u2019s attention. She was amazed by his skilled and natural moves like the flow of water. Compared to other countries, Country Z\u2019s sequential tea ceremony steps represented purity, simplicity, elegance, and grace. Tea ceremony also emphasized its formality and embodied the meaning of religion and health, but lacked spirituality.Du Shinan placed the brewed teapot in front of Wen Xinya as he looked at Old Master Mo with envy. \u201cShe is an intelligent child.\u201d\u201cOf course. She is my granddaughter.\u201d Old Master Mo had underestimated her intelligence and determination, thus he was seriously reconsidering her earlier request to learn about music and chess from him now.Wen Xinya looked carefully at the cup of tea. It was brewed with superior Biluo tea leaves, clear as crystal. The tea leaves were nicely spread out. It was a cup of elegantly brewed tea. She took a small sip. It was smooth, and the tea fragrance lingered in her mouth.Du Shinan put the teacup in his hand on the table. \u201cGirl, show me your tongue,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya stuck her tongue out obediently.Du Shinan took a look and said, \u201cYour tongue has some white substances, signifying a weak spleen and liver. Give me your right hand.\u201dWen Xinya put out her right hand.Du Shinan placed his fingers on her wrist. After a while, he said with a slight frown, \u201cLong-term malnutrition has caused your body to become weak. Your body is of a \u2018cold\u2019 nature, and your menstrual cycle is irregular. This is a female sickness.\u201dOld Master Mo\u2019s face turned serious. A weak body could be improved with Chinese medicine. However, a \u201ccold\u201d based body was inborn. Yuqian and Yao-er used to have a similar diagnosis. Thus, they were extremely weak when they conceived, and this was also the main reason that caused them to\u2026Never did he expect Wen Xinya to inherit this sickness.Du Shinan saw the worry on Old Master Mo\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. All these years I have worked a great deal on female sickness, and I\u2019ve seen some good results in recent years. Xinya is young. I will give her a few prescriptions that can help her improve her condition. There shouldn\u2019t be any major issues.\u201dOld Master Mo felt comforted and nodded.Wen Xinya already knew it, thus she wasn\u2019t surprised. This was what happened in her previous life too. There was still a long way to go for her to get married and give birth. These were of least concern to her as she wanted to achieve other more important goals in her life.Du Shinan knew that Wen Xinya understood that her condition could be improved over time with the help of Chinese medicine. He turned to Old Master Mo and said, \u201cLook at you. You\u2019re already at such an old age, yet a young little girl sees things more thoroughly than you.\u201dOld Master Mo sighed. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be more concerned and worried as we grow older. How can that be compared to the youngsters who have higher ambitions?\u201dDu Shinan sighed too.\u201cGrandpa Du, can you teach me some knowledge about Chinese medicine?\u201d Wen Xinya asked with a smile.Old Master Mo was baffled. He didn\u2019t know whether to react with a smile or with anger. Other than the courses for Secondary Three level in school, music, and chess, she had requested to learn about Chinese medicine now. Did she really think she had three heads and six arms? Moreover, it was Du Shinan she was asking to. He wasn\u2019t someone who taught easily. Wen Xinya was really being frank and outspoken.Du Shinan looked at the unhappy Old Master Mo, laughing in his heart. \u201cCan you tell me why do you want to learn about Chinese medicine?\u201dWen Xinya answered with confidence, \u201cThere\u2019s no limit to learning. I should try to acquire more knowledge while I\u2019m still young.\u201d\u201cDo you know how many students I have?\u201dWen Xinya raised her nose bridge and replied, \u201cMy intention is not to be a female expert in the medical world. I just want to learn some basic knowledge which could be useful in the future.\u201dHer real intention of learning the basics of Chinese medicine was to be able to help Grampy in improving his health.Du Shinan was taken aback. He had a positive impression of this intelligent young girl, and since she was also the granddaughter of his good friend, he initially thought to agree to take her as his student if she sincerely wanted to learn about Chinese medicine. Who would have expected that Wen Xinya actually had no intention to formally become his apprentice, but only wanted to acquire some basic knowledge?Old Master Mo looked at the sour-faced Du Shinan as if he was being rejected. He couldn\u2019t help himself and burst out laughing. \u201cSo, are you willing to teach her?\u201dThis young girl knew her limits. There was nothing wrong acquiring some basic Chinese medicine knowledge.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDu Shinan had mixed feelings of love and hate towards this pair of Grampy and granddaughter. \u201cCome to my medical hall every Sunday at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya was elated. \u201cThank you, Grandpa Du!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t thank me too early. Even though you are just learning some simple basic knowledge, I expect you to put in hard work and effort.\u201d Du Shinan reminded.\u201cI know, Grandpa Du!

In the morning, she had zither class. In the afternoon, it was calligraphy class with two hours of Chinese chess, and then she used the remaining time for reading. In the evening she went through the courses of Secondary Three. Her schedule was packed and accomplishing, and she felt herself growing every day. This, to her, was the feeling of being able to control her future by grasping every learning opportunity in her own hands. She became obsessed and more committed over time.Wen Xinya sat under the viburnum tree, looking at the chess manual and feeling the comfortable light breeze. Sunlight shone through the branches of viburnum flowers on her, like moving pieces of glowing elves dancing on her body.The scene reminded her of an idiom: A peaceful life and a healthy body were the best you could have.\u201cXinya!\u201d Grampy called for her in a low voice.Wen Xinya looked up, still in a daze. \u201cWhat is it, Grampy?\u201dOld Master Mo introduced someone to her. \u201cThis is Si Yiyan. He is my guest and will be staying at my bungalow for a short period of time. He was my apprentice for a few years before, so he can be considered half a student of mine.\u201dIt was then that Wen Xinya noticed a handsome and delicate young man standing beside Grampy. He was around 20-year-old and had a well-built figure, with an estimated height of 1.83 meters. He had thick, long eyebrows extended towards his sideburns, with a pair of gimlet eyes that commanded passion, making people feel uncomfortable with direct eye-contact. His thin lips were firm and distinct, which made him possess a unique, enchanting charisma.What a handsome, enchanting young man full of pride and charisma!Wen Xinya\u2019s pupils contracted. She tried looking away while stretching out her hand, \u201cMr. Si, nice to meet you. I am Wen Xinya. Looking forward to your guidance in the future.\u201dThough that was what she said, Wen Xinya wished to keep a distance from him. She sensed danger from this man, who seemed to have a powerful, mysterious charm. This was a strange feeling beyond her control, and it could lead her to a very different path. She didn\u2019t like this feeling.Si Yiyan, she tried hard to recall from her memory in her previous life. She was quite certain that this name wasn\u2019t a part of her previous life\u2019s memory. She had decided to avoid contact with anyone who was new and uncertain to her.Si Yiyan displayed a flirtatious smile on his face and shook Wen Xinya\u2019s hand. \u201cNice to meet you too, Miss Wen my lady. It\u2019s my honor to finally meet you in person.\u201dShe wore a light pink dress. There were branches of blossomed peach flowers on her dress and it matched her perfectly, bringing out the beauty and charm in her.Wen Xinya frowned. She felt that the words \u201cMiss Wen my lady\u201d that came out from his mouth sounded additionally flirtatious. Could she have heard wrongly? He sounded as if he knew her.\u201cXinya, Yiyan has a great talent for calligraphy and Chinese chess. If you need guidance you can approach him.\u201d Old Master Mo frowned while looking at the two of them conversing. It was as if he was totally out of the picture.Wen Xinya nodded. \u201cI will do so, Grampy!\u201dSi Yiyan sensed the neglection towards him. There was coldness in his eyes.Wen Xinya took a quick glance at Si Yiyan from the corner of her eyes. His thick eyebrows showed power, and his thin lips had the strength and sharpness of a razor. Just by standing there quietly, he conveyed an irresistible power of influence from his posture.Wen Xinya thought to herself, such a powerful character whom she had only met once this lifetime. Is he really a student of Grampy?This character seemed to command some power of influence in some areas. Why did he choose to stay over at Grampy\u2019s place? What could be his motive?Old Master Mo could sense Wen Xinya was on guard against Si Yiyan, thus he quickly added, \u201cXinya, tomorrow I will go to the Southern City for a seminar and will stay there for seven days. When I am not around, you must continue to work hard. I will check your homework when I return.\u201dWen Xinya went up to Grampy and held his arms. \u201cYou want to go to the Southern City for a seminar? Why haven\u2019t I heard you mention it before? You will be away for a week, I will definitely miss you.\u201dOld Master Mo was so distracted by her that he almost forgot Si Yiyan was right beside him. \u201cPreviously I was worried that if I went away no one would be around to guide you along on your homework. But now that Yiyan is here, I am glad he can help by guiding you.\u201dWen Xinya looked at Si Yiyan with displeasure and said, \u201cGrampy, you are putting my care into an outsider\u2019s hands. What could be better if you were to guide me yourself?\u201dThe displeased look she gave him made Si Yiyan feel uncomfortable. He could also sense that she was trying to keep a distance from him. \u201cThis seminar at Southern City is an important event. All the participants are highly-respected influential figures in the literary world. These people are usually very busy and seldom attend such events. Therefore, Old Master naturally wouldn\u2019t want to miss such a significance seminar,\u201d he said.Old Master Mo continued with a smile, \u201cYiyan is right. It is extremely difficult to gather those old men in one event. I have no excuse not to turn up. You be good and stay at home. I\u2019ll be bringing presents for you when I return.\u201dWen Xinya was unhappy and annoyed that Grampy spoke up for an outsider and treated her like a little girl.Looking at Wen Xinya\u2019s miserable face, Si Yiyan said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will be here to accompany you. You won\u2019t feel lonely.\u201dThese words just didn\u2019t feel right to Wen Xinya. They sounded weird and flirty. She peeped at Grampy to see his reaction, but he acted as if he didn\u2019t hear any of these. It couldn\u2019t be her ears that were playing out on her. \u201cUncle, the word \u2018lonely\u2019 doesn\u2019t suit me,\u201d she said.\u201cAre you calling me \u2018Uncle\u2019, hmm?\u201d Si Yiyan squinted his eyes were filled with a chill.The word \u201chmm\u201d was full of twists and turns. It seemed to contain hidden meanings of danger and uncertainty.\u201cIs there anyone here who matches the description of \u2018Uncle\u2019?\u201d Wen Xinya looked left and right, without looking at Si Yiyan. She recalled she had used this tone to speak to Wen Yuya earlier in Jo-ramst at Pearl Mall. At that time she had very much wanted to strangle Wen Yuya and see her struggle in her own hands.Wen Xinya was quick-witted and responded quickly to his remarks, showing her intelligence and flexibility. This made Si Yiyan raised his chest, feeling contented. \u201cDo not deny, I knew you were calling me,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019ve acknowledged it. Remember to maintain this good practice!\u201dWen Xinya acted calmly, though she had a sense of guilt in her. \u201cI haven\u2019t finished reading Grampy\u2019s chess manual. Please continue your chat while I make a move,\u201d she said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe immediately left after finishing her sentence.\u201cShe is a mischievous child and likes to joke around. Please do not take it to heart!\u201d Old Master Mo laughed. He thought of the scene earlier where Wen Xinya stood with Si Yiyan, she instantly became a small little girl. Si Yiyan did look like an \u2018Uncle\u2019 to her.Si Yiyan looked at Wen Xinya\u2019s diminishing shadow. She was as brilliant and enchanting as the viburnum tree. He had a good feeling about her.She appeared to be calm and rational, but she also displayed some mild characteristics of the internal wild and reckless character developed from her gangster life in the past. This Missus Wen seemed to be able to manage such conflicting behaviors well. He suspected Missus Wen would be able to conceal those bad characteristics well as time went by. This young lady indeed was unique in her own way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wen Xinya was glad that he had the accompaniment of Uncle Zhang. After sending Grampy away, Wen Xinya remembered the shop that belonged to the Wen Corporation at Pearl Mall, Jo-ramst, had launched a few new items this month. Previously she had also promised to Manager Li she would visit the shop to take a look. She almost forgot about it due to her busy learning schedule. She decided to drop by today since she was free.Wen Xinya hailed a taxi and stopped right in front of the mall. She took the lift directly to the shop at level three. The shop was unusually crowded due to the new launches. The moment she set foot into Jo-ramst, she saw Ning Shuqian sitting on a couch at the resting area with a magazine in her hands.Ning Shuqian saw her too. She stood up slowly from her cross-legged position and walked gracefully towards Wen Xinya. \u201cXinya, what a coincidence! I did not expect to see you here,\u201d she said.Ning Shuqian looked at her from head to toes. She seemed to be a totally changed person from half a month ago as if she had successfully morphed from an impatient and childish character into a silent and elegant lady.Wen Xinya displayed a plain smile. \u201cAunt Ning, did you come to shop for new clothes?\u201dHer plain smile accompanied by an unconcealable gracefulness made Ning Shuqian uncomfortable. \u201cMm, I accompanied Yuya and Ruya here to shop for new clothes. They are in the fitting room now.\u201dWen Xinya plainly nodded in acknowledgment.Ning Shuqian asked with concern, \u201cAre you used to staying at your Grampy\u2019s place?\u201dWen Xinya nodded coldly. \u201cThere\u2019s no need for Aunt Ning to worry. Grampy treats me very well. I am happy staying with him.\u201dNing Shuqian showed displeasure in her eyes.Old Master Mo was known for treating everyone coldly. What could she get out of the Mo Family? She must be putting up a false front.She said, \u201cYour Grandpa misses you a lot. Do visit him when you are free.\u201dWen Xinya looked up into her eyes that were full of evil intention and coldness. But Ning Shuqian always managed to conceal her internal motives. \u201cAunt Ning, what do you mean? I am the Missus Wen of the Wen Family. It is also my home. Of course I will return to visit Grandpa,\u201d she said.Wen Xinya had intentionally emphasized strongly on the word \u201creturn.\u201dIndeed, Ning Shuqian\u2019s face turned sour and she almost couldn\u2019t manage her emotions. She looked at Wen Xinya as if she was going to burst into tears. \u201cXinya, I do not understand why you feel such a strong hatred towards me and misunderstood my words. But I really hope you will return to visit your Grandpa more often. You were always on his mind all these years, and he has had a hard time looking for you. Now that he has finally found you he would naturally hope that you stay by his side.\u201dNing Shuqian was trying to beat around the bush with the intention of saying she was unfilial. How could Wen Xinya swallow such a huge criticism?Ning Shuqian, you want to challenge me? Let me play along with you and see who wins.\u201cAunt Ning, I also wanted to visit Grandpa, but Sister Yuya\u2026\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s expression was like a flower in autumn. Though powerless, it was pitiful and yet beautiful as if it had some unspoken emotions waiting to be unleashed. This sorrowful emotion was captured in her eyes.To an outsider, it seemed like the real Missus Wen was being bullied by an adopted daughter, and she wouldn\u2019t dare to reveal her hurt feelings in front of her stepmother.As if just as expected, the door of one of the cubicles opened, and out of it came Wen Yuya with a bright red dress. The red was attention-grabbing and overbearing, yet elegant. Her eyes almost popped out when she saw Wen Xinya. \u201cWen Xinya, why are you here?\u201d she asked.With such an arrogant tone, it got the attention of the other Madams and ladies in the shop. They instantly looked at Wen Yuya differently.Wen Xinya drooped her head, trying to explain. \u201cSister Yuya, I\u2026\u201dNing Shuqian knew this wasn\u2019t going to turn out right.Wen Yuya had a tall and slim figure. Now that she was wearing a pair of 10 centimeters tall high-heeled shoes, it made her look even more dominant. She walked gracefully towards Wen Xinya and looked down at her. \u201cYou came to Jo-ramst for the new launches too?\u201d she said while looking at Wen Xinya from head to toe. Then she continued to mock at her. \u201cCan you afford it? The previous time you had my mum pay for your purchases. This time around, you wouldn\u2019t expect her to pay for you again, would you?\u201dWen Xinya shook her head with panic. There was sorry and pity in her eyes. \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t\u2026 Previously it was because I had just returned to the Wen Family for only about a week and had no fitting clothes. Grandpa and Father asked Aunt Ning to accompany me to purchase new outfits and Father had agreed to pay for my purchases. I did not ask Aunt Ning to pay for me\u2026\u201dThe other Madams and Ladies in the shop saw what happened. They looked at Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya with despise. They pitied the real Missus Wen, who was the only heir to the Wen Family and yet was being bullied by her stepmother and stepsister. The Old Mr. Wen even had to outwardly give instructions to make new purchases for his granddaughter.All the old rumors about how arrogant and unrefined Wen Xinya was seemed to be untrue. Those rumors were intentionally spread to badmouth her! It must be those from their same social circle. Every family has its own troubles, but now it seemed clear to everyone who was evil and who was kind-hearted.Ning Shuqian quickly pulled Wen Yuya to stop her. \u201cYuya, quit spouting nonsense. I know there has been some misunderstanding between you and Xinya, but you shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201dNing Shuqian managed to use her words to turn the situation around. Now it became a misunderstanding between them, thus the negative attitude from Wen Yuya towards her sister. It was absolutely normal for two young teenagers to have misunderstandings and arguments.Xia Ruya also rendered help. \u201cYou are just unhappy about Aunt Ning buying more beautiful clothes for Xinya last time. You thought Aunt Ning had forgotten all about you and only cares about Xinya, thus the negative feeling towards her. There\u2019s nothing wrong with Aunt Ning being nice to Xinya since she has suffered a great deal from her wandering life starting from a young age.\u201dThough Wen Yuya was arrogant by nature, she wasn\u2019t stupid. She noticed the other ladies in the shop and immediately understood. She started to act sorry for herself and pouted. \u201cSince Xinya returned to the Wen Family, Mother has neglected me.\u201dNing Shuqian held Wen Yuya\u2019s arm and comforted her. \u201cRuya is right. Xinya had just returned to the Wen Family, so I had to pay more attention and look after her. You are my daughter, how would I not love you?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing Shuqian looked at Xia Ruya with gratefulness and warmth in her eyes. She was such an intelligent child. With just a few words she managed to change Ning Shuqian\u2019s image from a bad stepmother into a caring stepmother who treated her stepdaughter nicer than her own daughter.There was a saying: Three women create a show. It was indeed true. The Madams and Ladies in the shop seemed to finally understand what was going on. Wen Xinya had surely underestimated these three women.This was Xia Ruya, who always had a way to position herself as a pure, elegant and kind-hearted person. Ning Shuqian also constantly portrayed a positive image of herself as a graceful and nice person. Thus Wen Yuya was able to be arrogant but not foolish, relying upon her witty mother.Now that Wen Xinya had seen the true colors of these three people in front of her, she had to raise her guard against them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She is just an outspoken child. Please do not hold it against her,\u201d she said.Wen Xinya replied with a fake smile, \u201cIt is my fault. I have caused unnecessary worry to Aunt Ning and Sister Ruya since my return to the Wen Family. Please don\u2019t hold it against me.\u201dCompared to the ill-mannered Wen Yuya, Wen Xinya displayed a kind-hearted and easy-going temperament. This was the appropriate demeanor for the true daughter of the Wen Family. Ning Shuqian felt uneasy as if she had swallowed a fly. She could see the meanness in Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes.It seemed like someone was praising Wen Xinya. Xia Ruya raised her head and saw Wen Xinya trying to conceal her smile, but continued to look pitiful. Xia Ruya immediately tried switching topics. \u201cXinya, there are quite a few new launches this month. In fact, the shop assistant just showed us a few pieces of long dresses that suit your size. They were asking about why you didn\u2019t come with us. And what a coincidence, here you are!\u201dWen Xinya glanced at Xia Ruya. She really knew when to make advances and when to retreat. \u201cOh! Really? I will give it a try later,\u201d she responded.Ning Shuqian looked at Xia Ruya with gratefulness and said, \u201cXinya, go on and try them out. If you like any of these dresses just ask the shop assistants to wrap them up for you.\u201dIt seemed that Ning Shuqian was hinting that she would be footing the bill. Wen Xinya thought she would be stupid not to take advantage. She replied without hesitation, \u201cThank you, Aunt Ning.\u201dWen Xinya turned around to make her selection.Ning Shuqian looked at Wen Xinya\u2019s back with bitterness in her eyes.\u201cMother, why are you paying for her again?\u201d Wen Yuya stared angrily at Wen Xinya who had her back facing them, wanting to swallow her alive.Ning Shuqian pulled her to the resting area where no one was around and explained to her with a frown, \u201cHow many times have I told you not to clash with Wen Xinya directly? You just won\u2019t listen. Think about it, when have you ever successfully took advantage over her? Every time it was me who had to step in to save you after suffering a humiliation. Why can\u2019t you just remember what I say?\u201dNing Shuqian did not want to have such a conversation with her daughter in a public place like this. However, she was also afraid that Wen Yuya might do further silly things later on. Thus, she had no choice.Wen Yuya felt sorry for herself. \u201cMother, didn\u2019t you told me she was just another \u2018fake Missus\u2019 who just returned to the Wen Family and I wouldn\u2019t have to care about her. Why are you asking me to leave her alone now?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this little bitch to be so difficult. I think there is something going on with her. Do you remember when she just returned to the Wen Family she was a rough and unrefined little girl? Her words and actions were full of vulgarity. We just had to be a little nice to her and she would treat us like her benefactors.\u201dWen Yuya agreed. \u201cMother, you are right. I feel there\u2019s something weird going on with her too. She used to be simple-minded and believed in whatever I said. I even managed to trick her to go to Black Sunday without any difficulty! Soon after she seemed to become a totally changed person. Now she always goes against me in everything I say, as if there is great enmity between her and us.\u201dAt this instant, Wen Yuya suddenly got closer to Ning Shuqian. \u201cMother, do you think she knows something she shouldn\u2019t?\u201d she asked.\u201cImpossible!\u201d Ning Shuqian replied with firmness. In her mind, she suddenly recalled the scene where Wen Xinya left the Wen Family\u2019s mansion. Wen Xinya whispered these words into her ear,\u201cI will be back! There are\u2026 plenty of opportunities!\u201dThe question is, \u201cwhen\u201d?\u201cBut, if she didn\u2019t come to know of anything that she shouldn\u2019t have, why the great enmity toward us? Previously it was still alright\u2026\u201dNing Shuqian turned her head and look towards the fitting rooms\u2019 area. She saw Wen Xinya wearing a light purple dress. Light purple represents mysterious and elegance. She looked even more radiant in this dress. Ning Shuqian suddenly felt she wasn\u2019t able to read this person\u2019s mind.She regretted her earlier suggestion to send Wen Xinya abroad. This gave her an opportunity to go to the Mo Family instead. Though if Wen Xinya continued to stay with the Wen Family, Ning Shuqian knew she would be unhappy living with her under the same roof, but at least she would be able to monitor and be aware of everything she did. Now that she was sent to live with the Mo Family, she had completely broken free from Ning Shuqian\u2019s control.At the same time, Xia Ruya was also quietly observing Wen Xinya. She was graceful, calm and had a classy charisma. She was also decisive and had a good sense of taste with the clothes she chose, which were good fits for her and matched her style. Only someone who was used to shopping with such luxury brands over time could make such good choices.When she had just returned to the Wen Family, her behaviors were unrefined and rough. She acted exactly like how a street gangster would behave. Why the sudden change? Could it be that she was just putting an act previously?If this was true, then Wen Xinya would turn out to be a very scheming person.Wen Xinya tried one outfit after another. For those that fitted her nicely, she asked the shop assistants to add to her shopping cart.Women\u2019s love for shoes was far stronger than for jewelry. This was the same for Wen Xinya. She noticed a pair of high-heeled shoes on display. It had a beautiful design without any accessories, its light golden surface glittered and looked glaring under the lights from the chandelier.\u201cMiss, please get a size 34 of this pair of shoes for me to try on,\u201d said two different voices.Wen Xinya turned over and saw another teenage girl a few steps from her. She was around 16 or 17 years of age, wearing a pink princess dress. She had light brown curly hair with a princess\u2019 perm and a butterfly knot. Though she was pretty, she had a bad dressing sense. Wen Xinya thought she looked very familiar but just couldn\u2019t recall who she was in that moment.The shop assistant replied with a worried look on her face, \u201cThere\u2019s only one pair for each of the sizes. Why don\u2019t the two Missus look around for other designs?\u201d\u201cI just want this pair, who dares compete with me?\u201d The young teenage girl was arrogant. She gave Wen Xinya a hard stare.Wen Xinya originally didn\u2019t have any intention to fight with her over a pair of shoes. However, her behavior was unacceptable. Wen Xinya felt she was openly challenged by this teenage girl and she would become a laughing stock if she were to give in. \u201cPlease get me the pair of shoes to try on,\u201d she said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith such a commanding tone, it was hard for the shop assistant to say \u201cno\u201d. Right at this moment, the shop assistant who served Wen Xinya previously came over. She said with a smile, \u201cMissus Wen like this pair of shoes, you have good taste! This is the latest design from the Wen Corporation.\u201d After saying that, she turned to the first shop assistant and told her, \u201cWang, go get the correct size for Missus Wen to try it on.\u201d\u201cYes, Sister Yang!\u201d Wang glanced at Wen Xinya with fear.The teenage girl in pink looked at Wen Xinya and finally realized who she was. \u201cSo you are the Missus Wen who had a wandering life for the past 15 years and chased my younger sister out of the Wen Family once you returned!\u201dWen Xinya had a sudden flash of memory and remembered who she was. She was Xia Ruxue, the half-sister of Xia Ruya. In her previous life, Xia Ruxue had tried making things difficult for Wen Xinya under the influence of Xia Ruya. She even got some gangsters to abduct Wen Xinya. It was because of her thick makeup that Wen Xinya didn\u2019t manage to recognize her immediately.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had obviously noted the commotion over here but acted as if nothing had happened and continued to select her clothes.True enough, as soon as Wen Xinya finished her sentence, Xia Ruya came rushing over. \u201cSister, Xinya, what happened?\u201d she asked with a curious look.When Xia Ruxue was just about to speak, Wen Xinya interrupted with a smile. \u201cYour sister said I was the one who chased you out of the Wen Family.\u201dXia Ruya tried to correct the misunderstanding. \u201cSister, you are mistaken. I am not the true daughter of the Wen Family. Now that Uncle Wen\u2019s child has been found, I cannot possibly continue to stay in the Wen Family forever. However, I was fortunate enough that the Wen Family took care of me for the past 12 years. If not for them, I cannot imagine what would have happened to me.\u201dXia Ruxue gave Wen Xinya a hard stare. Then she looked at Xia Ruya and said, \u201cSister, you are being too kind-hearted. That is why she\u2019s been bullying you. Do you remember the last time you visited her at the Wen Family? She did not show appreciation and even pushed you into the pond.\u201dXia Ruya quickly explained, \u201cXinya didn\u2019t do it on purpose. I am not angry with her. Moreover, I have taken away the kinship that rightfully belonged to her for the past 12 years. It\u2019s me who has done her wrong.\u201dXia Ruxue said angrily, \u201cSister, you are really making me mad.\u201dWen Xinya stood aside watching the drama put up by this pair of sisters. She thought Xia Ruya had perfect acting skills. She could most certainly win the \u201cBest Actress\u201d award. It would be a waste of talent that she wasn\u2019t into acting.Right at this moment, Wang returned hastily with the pair of shoes.Xia Ruxue stepped over swiftly and grabbed the pair of shoes. She looked at Wen Xinya with arrogance and said, \u201cMy Sister is afraid of you, but not me. Don\u2019t ever think of taking away things that belong to me.\u201dXia Ruya tried to stop her sister. \u201cSister, Xinya likes this pair of shoes. Let\u2019s not fight with her. I\u2019ll get you a better pair of shoes later.\u201dXia Ruxue wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cIt was me who saw this pair of shoes first. Why should I give in to her just because she likes it?\u201dBoth shopping assistants Sister Yang and Wang didn\u2019t know how to react. They looked at Wen Xinya nervously.Wen Xinya\u2019s lips widened and her smile slowly got broader, until she was smiling brightly. Then, her smile suddenly disappeared in an instant. Under the lights from the chandelier, there was a chilly coldness deep in her eyes, as if there were limitless evil intentions in them.Xia Ruxue held her breath tensely. It almost felt like Wen Xinya could release numerous cold arrows from her eyes at that very next moment and they would pierce through her.Wen Xinya slowly walked towards Xia Ruxue and pried open her fingers one by one! Then she removed the shoes from her hands. Instead of performing these moves in a fierce and forceful manner, Wen Xinya was able to do it so gracefully that she appeared as if nothing was wrong with her actions.Everyone was stunned, especially Xia Ruya. Only a street gangster would forcefully snatch something away from someone else. However, Wen Xinya did it with such a smooth flow of actions that nobody was able to react in time.Wen Xinya sat on the sofa, kicked off the shoes she was originally wearing and put on the new pair of light golden shoes. She had a pair of beautiful, pure-white legs with defining contours. The shoes matched her perfectly, as if they were custom made for her. Under the lights from the chandelier, the light-golden surface shone and glittered with style. Though there weren\u2019t any extravagant accessories, they carried a style of simplistic elegance.Miss Yang couldn\u2019t resist her urge to comment, \u201cThis pair of shoes looks perfect on you, as if they were specially custom made for you.\u201dWen Xinya kicked the light-golden shoes away. She wouldn\u2019t give them another look, as if she was determined to get rid of it. After putting back her own shoes, she came in front of Xia Ruxue and said coldly, \u201cA gentleman shouldn\u2019t take away what someone loves. Since Miss Xia loves them so much, I shall let you have it.\u201dYou can have it if I don\u2019t want it anymore! This was obviously issuing a challenge right in her face!Xia Ruxue\u2019s face turned red with anger. \u201cBitch! So what if you are Missus Wen from the Wen Family? A chick will always remain a chick. You will never turn into a phoenix even if you manage to make your way into a phoenix\u2019s nest. You cannot be compared to my sister.\u201dWen Xinya abruptly took out her cell phone and played the video of Xia Ruxue insulting her. Then she gently shook the cell phone in her hands and said, \u201cXia Ruya, you saw your sister insulting me but yet did nothing to help. I\u2019m curious, if this video was shown to Grandpa, what would he think? Would he become dissatisfied of the Xia Family and hence cause the relationship of both families to turn sour?\u201dWen Xinya knew that the Wen Family had rendered tremendous help on the Xia Family\u2019s business because of the relationship with Xia Ruya. In her previous life, because of the Wen Family\u2019s help, the Xia Corporation did extremely well in their business and became a world famous organization, almost on par with the Wen Corporation.Of course, Wen Xinya wouldn\u2019t want Grandpa to see this video clip. She wanted to keep it as a last resort and only use it when it was absolutely necessary.Xia Ruya did not expect her to do this. She turned pale and quickly pulled Xia Ruxue aside. \u201cMy sister acts rash at times, and sometimes I can\u2019t do anything about it. Xinya, how can you put the blame on me? I\u2019ve asked her not to fight with you over the shoes earlier,\u201d she said.Xia Ruxue added furiously, \u201cWen Xinya, come at me if you dare. Don\u2019t you bully my sister.\u201d\u201cFoolish.\u201d Wen Xinya simply ignored her. She did not feel sorry at all. Xia Ruxue reminded her of how Wen Yuya treated her in her previous life. She could only blame her own foolishness for putting her trust in Wen Yuya.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Xia Ruxue fumed with anger.Wen Xinya slowly walked towards Xia Ruya. She didn\u2019t want to continue her hypocrite act. \u201cYou wanted to make use of your sister to malign me? Xia Ruya, are you really that kind and elegant as you\u2019ve portrayed yourself to be?\u201dIf Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya were the main culprits of causing her immense sufferings in her previous life, then Xia Ruya would be the one who led her to the path of destruction. She took everything away from her\u2014kinship, friendship, love, wealth and identity. Xia Ruya spent all her efforts snatching everything that belonged to Wen Xinya, leaving her with nothing but a bad reputation. Wen Xinya was always living in the shadows, while Xia Ruya would step on her even more, pushing her into a hell of misery!Xia Ruya was the person she hated the most!At this moment, Xia Ruya was still trying to look innocent. She replied with a confused look on her face, \u201cI\u2026 I do not understand what you are saying.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou really don\u2019t understand?\u201d Wen Xinya asked with a cold smile, staring straight into her eyes.Xia Ruya felt an unspoken power from her stare, piercing straight into her soul. A chill ran down her spine, rendering her speechless.After tearing the mask of pretense from this hypocrite, Wen Xinya couldn\u2019t be bothered with further argument. She walked directly to the cashier for payment.She requested the cashier to pass the bill to Ning Shuqian, provided the Mo Family\u2019s address for the items to be delivered, and then left Jo-ramst.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She was reminded that she had been traveling on public transport for the past 15 years. How long had she not been on public transport since her rebirth?Wen Xinya thought really hard for a while. It was almost 10 years since she had taken public transport!She slowly grabbed the handle on the door and ascended the bus. Inside the bus, it was crowded with people and filled with a mixed stench from cigarettes, perspiration, and gas. She felt uncomfortable.She moved towards a less crowded area and stood there. When the vehicle started moving, she almost lost her balance and fell forward. Fortunately, she did not fall to the ground as she was holding onto the handle.Right at this moment, a creepy looking man moved towards her. He stood right behind her and grabbed the backing of the chairs, trapping Wen Xinya between his body and his arms.Wen Xinya slowly turned over and faced the man. \u201cIf you dare move forward an inch, I will destroy you!\u201d she threatened.The man turned pale and panted heavily. A drop of sweat trickled down from his forehead. \u201cMy lady, no! Please! I won\u2019t dare to, please remove your hands\u2026\u201d he pleaded.The man was scared stiff and didn\u2019t dare move an inch. He slowly looked down at the hairpin between his legs. It had an extremely sharp edge. With just a slight push, it could almost penetrate his private part.\u201cThe previous person who tried to molest me had his hand broken and his private part severely injured.\u201d Wen Xinya stared at him without moving her hands.The man could see the extreme coldness in her eyes, sending chills down his spine. He realized she was not kidding. His body became numb with fear and lost his grip on the chair, causing him to fall backward. At the same time, the bus made a turn and he fell right on the ground, knocking against the handle on the rear door.Wen Xinya was staring at him all this while.The man tried picking himself up with horror, but the bus had just arrived at the next stop and stopped with a sudden break, depositing him on the floor once again.Many in the bus saw the scene of him trying to take advantage of an underage teenage girl. Now they were gloating over his misfortune, mumbling to each other about how he deserved this.He dashed right out from the bus the moment the doors were opened.With a frown on her face, she found a seat by the window. The cool breeze of April blew gently on her face, easing her discomfort.The bus had come to its final stop. Wen Xinya alighted and found herself in a familiar environment. She was astonished! She was standing right in front of the street leading to the place where she used to live for the past 15 years.Life is full of coincidences. She was just strolling along mindlessly and hopped on a random bus, which took her to the place where it all started. She suddenly had the intention to return to the old place to take a look.With this intention, she followed the trail from the small lane as if her legs were out of her control.There were low-rise houses in bad shape along the two sides of the lane, with heaps of rubbish all over the place, causing a strong stench of mold to permeate the area.She had this unfathomable feeling. As if everything had just happened yesterday \u2014 a house full of alcoholic smell and irritable noises of quarrels and things being thrown around. And the physical abuse coupled with nasty scoldings. She remembered during the last day she was here, her evil adopted parents had wanted to sell her to the illegal money-lender, Brother Wu. Luckily the Wen Family got to her before that happened. Otherwise, she couldn\u2019t imagine how her life would turn out.What happened to the evil adopted parents? Where were they now?Wen Xinya searched her memories from her previous life. Oh yes, the Wen Family had given her adopted parents a sum of money and forbid them to reveal any information about Wen Xinya. They were sent away shortly after, but she had no idea where the couple was sent to. She only knew that during the 10 years in her previous life, the couple had never appeared in front of her.\u201cOuyang Feng, you have another three days to clear your debt with Brother Wu. Otherwise, I will break your arms.\u201d Followed by some sound of hitting and cursing.Wen Xinya looked over. She saw a group of stray teenagers with colorful hairstyles and weird clothing cursing viciously at a man and beating him up violently.She had seen too much of such scenes before and wasn\u2019t surprised at all. However, the name \u201cFeng\u201d caught her interest.This \u201cOuyang Feng,\u201d could it be the same \u201cOuyang Feng\u201d she knew?\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d One of the teenagers in black dismissed his gang after kicking Ouyang Feng a few more times.Wen Xinya walked out from the shade and came towards Ouyang Feng, slowly squatting beside him. She gently pushed him with her finger, asking, \u201cWei, are you dead?\u201dOuyang Feng was beaten brutally with blood covering his face. He looked horrible. Feeling the gentle push, he opened his eyes and saw a young teenage girl of around 15 or 16 years of age squatting beside him.Seeing that he was able to open his eyes, Wen Xinya asked with an innocent look, \u201cAre you Ouyang Feng?\u201d\u201cYes, I am Ouyang Feng!\u201d He used his bit of last strength to push himself up, leaning against the wall. Squinting his eyes, he carefully looked at the teenage girl in front of him. This girl was wearing an expensive white dress with an embroidered design of branches with blossomed flowers. She looked so pure and elegant, with the innocence of a teenage girl. From her dressing, he could tell that she was from a wealthy family. At the same time, he was also curious why she was in the slums.\u201cAre you the financial genius, Ouyang Feng?\u201d Wen Xinya questioned. That\u2019s right! She had known an Ouyang Feng who was a genius in the financial world, though she only read about him from the magazines and did not know him personally. At that time he already owned an investment company, which helped his clients trade internationally. To become his clients, they had to be of a certain level in their status rather than just being wealthy alone. The level of entry was high beyond imagination.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn her previous life, she did not pay too much attention to any of his news, thus she did not know much about him. However, she vaguely remembered that he had started an investment company with a few friends during his younger days. After that, he was set up by his friends, who used the company for money laundering activities. This caused him to suffer a loss in reputation and he was jailed for three years. It was said that he had a good performance and behaved well in jail, therefore he was released one year before his sentence was completed. Due to his jail record, his life went downhill from then onwards. Looking at his current situation, it was most likely things didn\u2019t go well for him after he was released from jail.Ouyang Feng\u2019s eyes brightened from the earlier confused state. \u201cHow do you know my identity?\u201dDuring the days where he studied abroad, he was known as the financial genius. Moreover, this nickname was only known to his overseas schoolmates. Within a year after graduation, he returned home and started a small investment company with his friends. And not long after, he was jailed because of his company\u2019s involvement in the money laundering case. He had never thought anyone else would know about his nickname of \u201cfinancial genius.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s face lit up with excitement. From Ouyang Feng\u2019s expression, she could tell that this was the Ouyang Feng she knew. She looked at him sharply and replied, \u201cI have my ways. You don\u2019t need to know.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She could remain calm even with the piercing look in his eyes. \u201cLittle girl, I can see from your dressing that you are from a well-to-do family. This is not a place you should be. Please leave!\u201d he said.Wen Xinya could sense that Ouyang Feng was avoiding direct eye contact. \u201cOuyang Feng, would you believe me if I said I came here especially for you?\u201d she said with a serious expression as if she truly meant it.There was a glimpse of hope in Ouyang Feng\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou came for me? Why?\u201dIt was hard for Ouyang Feng not to believe her. She had just called out his name and seemed to know about his identity. Could there be such a coincidence in the world? However, he felt that she was just too young and innocent for him to believe that.Wen Xinya replied firmly, \u201cThat\u2019s because you are a financial genius.\u201d\u201cYou want me to work for you?\u201d Ouyang Feng squinted his eyes and carefully looked at this young lady again. She remained calm and quiet, with great sincerity in her eyes. She had a sense of serenity in her that was different from the other daughters from wealthy families.\u201cYes, I have such intention in mind, but I will respect your decision,\u201d she responded with composure, showing she would not force him to do anything against his will.Ouyang Feng was hesitant. He was wondering if he should place his bets on an underage teenage girl. On the other hand, he knew he had to repay his debts as fast as possible. Otherwise, the sum of money he owed would grow exponentially with compounded interests.Wen Xinya noticed his hesitation. She said with a smile, \u201cIf you agree to work for me, I will clear all your debts. What do you think?\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s words had hit the nail. This was exactly what he needed. But he couldn\u2019t accept the thought of having to work for an underage teenage girl. He looked at her innocently youthful face and sarcastically asked, \u201cHow old are you? Fifteen or Sixteen?\u201dWen Xinya realized what was holding him back. She slowly stood up and looked at him from her height. \u201cOuyang Feng, listen well. I am 15-years-old this year,\u201d she said.With her eyebrows slightly raised and looking at him from the top, she displayed a sense of authority. Ouyang Feng saw a matured and rational soul from her eyes. He instantly knew that he shouldn\u2019t judge this young lady by her age.Noticing he was a little off guard now, Wen Xinya added, \u201cOuyang Feng, rest assured that I am only interested in your talent in investment. I will not get you involved in any illegal activities.\u201dThis was indeed what Ouyang Feng was worried about. After hearing her assurance, he couldn\u2019t find any other reasons to reject her. He took a deep breath and replied, \u201cYoung lady, are you aware that I am a jailbird? I just came out from prison and am currently on probation.\u201dThere were sorrow and pain from life experiences in Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes. She looked at him coldly and said, \u201cWhat does it matter?\u201dOuyang Feng was touched. Since his release from prison, she was the first person who did not despise him after hearing his unglamorous story. \u201cAre you worried that since I have a bad record, I might give you endless troubles or might even betray you?\u201d he asked.Wen Xinya replied plainly, \u201cWhat I see in you is your capabilities. If I have decided to work with you, I will have to accept everything about you, including the troubles you mentioned. With regards to betrayal, I can only say that it is me who has to manage and control you. It\u2019s not something you should worry about.\u201dOuyang Feng looked at this young lady with amazement. From her expression, she communicated such confidence, elegance, and authority. Though she was only 15-years-old, from her words he could sense that she was someone with intelligence and courage surpassing those around her age, with an extraordinary character. He found no reason not to agree.\u201cOkay, I agree!\u201dThese few words carried firmness in them and were his assurance to her.\u201cHi, Ouyang Feng. I am Wen Xinya!\u201d She looked at Ouyang Feng, who had bruises all over his face. Though she couldn\u2019t clearly see his expression under his bruises, there was solidity in his words. She respected him.\u201cHi, nice to meet you!\u201d Ouyang Feng stretched out his trembling hands. He seemed to have guessed her identity. The surname \u201cWen\u201d wasn\u2019t a common one. There were very few families in the Capital city with this surname, and there was only one Wen Family that was well known.And Wen Xinya\u2026 He vaguely remembered seeing her on the news. The lost daughter of the Wen Family who had led a wandering life for the past 15 years. She was the only rightful heir of the family. He suddenly felt lucky, feeling that he might have hit the jackpot.From his expression, Wen Xinya knew that he had guessed her identity. She stretched her hand towards Ouyang Feng. \u201cA pleasant cooperation.\u201d\u201cA pleasant cooperation!\u201d Ouyang Feng shook her thin, beautiful hand.With their deal official, it made him feel respected. It had also cleared his worries.Wen Xinya asked, \u201cHow much do you owe the illegal money-lenders?\u201dAt the moment, she could make use of the pocket money Wen Haowen gave her. If the amount exceeded what she could afford, she decided to borrow from Grampy. She was determined to recruit Ouyang Feng at all costs.\u201cI had initially borrowed 50 thousand dollars from them. However, including compounded interests, the amount of debt has grown to three hundred thousand dollars.\u201d Three hundred thousand dollars might be the tip of the iceberg to the daughter of the Wen Family, but to Ouyang Feng, it was a matter of life and death. He was nervous, thinking that this young lady might go back on her words.Wen Xinya sighed deeply. The future-to-be King of Investment was worth over billions 10 years later. Who would have known he would land himself in such a sorry state this day with a sum of three hundred thousand dollars. \u201cPlease rest assured, I will clear your debt for you,\u201d she promised.\u201cThank you!\u201d Ouyang Feng was grateful from the bottom of his heart.\u201cNo need to thank me. We are partners.\u201d Wen Xinya looked at Ouyang Feng with a smile. With his capabilities, she did not want to appear superior in front of him.\u201cPartners\u2026\u201d Ouyang Feng looked at her smile with sincerity.We are partners? I am not your subordinate or just another tool that you have bought over?\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Wen Xinya asked with confusion.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNothing\u2026 Nothing! Thank you!\u201d Ouyang Feng felt warmth in his heart.Wen Xinya lent him a hand and pulled him up. \u201cYour injuries look serious. Let me send you to the hospital. We\u2019ll discuss further details after you have recovered,\u201d she said.Ouyang Feng was appreciative but he replied, \u201cI can still walk on my own.\u201dMany years later, when Ouyang Feng became a globally well-known figure, he recalled this day when he met Wen Xinya. This was how he described it:When I was just released from prison, I had a bad record and couldn\u2019t find a job. I had no choice but to borrow money from the illegal money-lenders for trading. However, I lost it all to the stock market. They haunted me every day, forcing me to repay my debts. One day I was lucky to meet her, who was like an angel appearing right in front of me. She gave me hope and respected me as a person. I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I knew I would be willing to do anything for her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He should be fine after two nights of observation. Wen Xinya left shortly after.Wen Xinya looked at the time and realized it was already afternoon. Grampy should have arrived at the Southern City. She then gave him a call from her cell phone. The call was answered instantly, \u201cHello, is this Xinya? Old Zhang and I have arrived in Southern City. We have just checked into our hotel. Do not worry.\u201dFrom his powerful voice, Wen Xinya knew he was doing well and was relieved. \u201cGrampy, please take care of yourself and remember to rest well,\u201d she said.Old Master Mo acknowledged. \u201cYes, I know. How come you are as long-winded as Old Zhang?\u201dWen Xinya replied with an offended tone, \u201cGrampy, that\u2019s too much! I am just being concerned about your health and here you are, complaining about my long-windedness.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just kidding. I know you are concerned about my health and am elated. How will I ever find you long-winded?\u201d Old Master Mo said jokingly.Wen Xinya decided to let him off the hook. \u201cGrampy, please help me find a trusted lawyer! I have to handle a situation.\u201dShe knew that it wouldn\u2019t be convenient for her to show up to the illegal money-lenders whom Ouyang Feng owed his debts to. She had decided to engage a lawyer to front the matter on her behalf. Other than preventing herself from getting into trouble, working through a lawyer also represented authority towards the money-lenders. Grampy enjoyed a high level of status in the literary world, thus it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to introduce her to a few good lawyers.Though Old Master Mo was curious, he didn\u2019t ask for the motive. He told Wen Xinya, \u201cBoth your mother and I have worked with the same lawyer. He is a reliable person. You can get him to help you. I\u2019ll give him a call shortly and let him arrange a meeting with you.\u201dWen Xinya replied happily, \u201cThank you, Grampy!\u201dWhen she returned to the Mo Family\u2019s bungalow, Wen Xinya saw Si Yiyan speaking to another man. This man was around 30 years of age, with well-defined features and wearing a suit. She guessed that he should be the lawyer Grampy was talking about.Just as expected, the suited man stood up when he saw Wen Xinya and introduced himself, \u201cMissus Wen, nice to meet you. I am Qiu Yifan, an attorney from the Chaofan Lawyer Corporation. Please feel free to let me know if there\u2019s anything I can help with.\u201d Then he respectfully handed her his business card.Wen Xinya received it with both hands. \u201cAttorney Qiu, nice to meet you. I do have a favor to ask you.\u201dQiu Yifan responded with a serious expression on his face, \u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure to be of service to Missus Wen.\u201dWen Xinya looked towards Si Yiyan.Si Yiyan understood her gesture. He slowly stood up from his chair and excused himself, \u201cPlease carry on with your conversation. I\u2019m going to the backyard for a stroll.\u201dWen Xinya was pretty satisfied with Si Yiyan\u2019s understanding. After he had exited from the living room, Wen Xinya looked at Qiu Yifan with a smile. \u201cAttorney Qiu, please take a seat.\u201dQiu Yifan got seated with care and a stern look on his face.Wen Xinya started brewing from the teapot. Her actions were as smooth as the flow of water, as if she had practiced the same move for a thousand times. There were quality and calmness in every move. Qiu Yifan started to think differently about this teenage girl.Wen Xinya poured him a cup of tea. She said, \u201cI have just recently picked up tea-brewing and am still learning. Please pardon me if I\u2019ve made any mistakes.\u201dQiu Yifan laughed. \u201cMissus Wen, your tea-brewing skills are amazing.\u201dWith the firmness in his tone and expression, Wen Xinya was almost convinced that she had perfected her tea-brewing skills. That\u2019s the talent of lawyers. They are able to speak with conviction. \u201cI have a friend who borrowed some money from illegal money-lenders. I would like you to front this matter,\u201d she said.Qiu Yifan answered with assurance, \u201cThat is a small matter. I will get it done for you, Missus Wen.\u201dWen Xinya passed him the bank card Wen Haowen gave to her and said, \u201cThank you, Attorney Qiu. I will get my friend to contact you.\u201dQiu Yifan replied, \u201cYou are most welcomed, Missus Wen.\u201dWen Xinya raised the teacup in front of her with respect. \u201cAttorney Qiu, please give me your guidance in the future.\u201dLawyers have another unique capability of judging people with accuracy. He noticed that the Missus Wen from the Wen Family had portrayed an attractive charisma and knew she would become an influential character one day.The Qiu Family had been lawyers for two generations and had been serving the Mo Family since. Naturally, the two families had developed a positive relationship and Qiu Yifan was happy for Old Master Mo for having a capable granddaughter who displayed such unique characteristics at a young age.Wen Xinya accompanied Attorney Qiu to the door during his departure. When she returned to the living room, Si Yiyan was sitting at her seat. He took her unfinished cup of tea and sniffed.With his eyes half-closed, he enjoyed the fragrance from the remaining tea. He did it with a graceful movement. However, there seemed to be a flirtatious meaning behind it.Wen Xinya blushed. \u201cThat was my teacup. I\u2019ve drunk from it earlier,\u201d she said angrily.Si Yiyan smiled plainly. \u201cI know. There isn\u2019t anything unique about the tea itself, but it carried a fragrance from something else.\u201dHe rotated the teacup in his hands while speaking. Wen Xinya noticed a barely visible mark of her pink lipstick on one side of the Ruku porcelain cup.Wen Xinya froze, as if she had been struck by lightning and wasn\u2019t able to react in time. She felt like someone had taken advantage of her. Was that really what happened?Si Yiyan was smiling. His mesmerizing eyes sparkled with glitter, like a glass placed under a colorful light. His vision focused on her while he continued rotating the teacup. Then he placed the side with the lipstick into contact with his own lips.Wen Xinya couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. Was this considered kissing? She couldn\u2019t fathom why he was behaving this way. He was openly flirting with her in such an elegant way. It felt like it was perfectly natural for him to take advantage of her.Wen Xinya instantly recovered from her daze, overcoming her shock from his flirtatious act. It was true that he had taken advantage of her. She snatched the teacup from him angrily. \u201cReturn my teacup to me.\u201dSi Yiyan leaned back against the chair. Wen Xinya lost her balance and fell right onto his chest. He held her waist with one arm and said, \u201cThrowing yourself into my arms, hmm?\u201dWen Xinya was slim. Holding her in his arms felt comfortable, and he could smell the mild fragrance from her body, except she was boney. It would have been better if\u2026\u201cGo to hell. I am seriously warning you, you\u2019d better let go of me. Otherwise, I will not be nice to you.\u201d Wen Xinya panicked. She detected a nice bamboo smell from his body. She tried hitting and kicking non-stop, struggling to get herself up, almost forgetting the way she dealt with the molester earlier.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSi Yiyan knew she was really angry now, thus he immediately let go of her. \u201cThrough my actions earlier, I just wanted to let you know it is impolite to leave your lipstick on the teacup. This is an act of not showing respect to the owner,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya\u2019s anger was dissipated by his words. She controlled her emotions and stared at him with eyes wide open. \u201cSo, does it mean I should thank you for sacrificing your body to give me such a valuable lesson?\u201dSi Yiyan replied coldly, \u201cNo need to thank me. But I hope the next time you want to go out or have other arrangements, please do inform me in advance. Have you forgotten we have a calligraphy lesson this afternoon?\u201dWen Xinya was feeling a little embarrassed now by his cold reply. She remembered Grampy had indeed requested Si Yiyan to manage her learning schedules for calligraphy and chess. It was impolite of her to loiter outside without informing him. \u201cI understand. I just went shopping earlier and bought some clothes,\u201d she said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Si Yiyan was amazed by Wen Xinya\u2019s talent in the game. She merely read through a few chess manuals and seemed to be able to figure out a few strategies on her own. When he tried giving her some tips, she was able to understand quickly and even devised advanced techniques from them!\u201cHave you decided?\u201d Si Yiyan looked at Wen Xinya, who was deep in thought, with a piece of black chess seed between her thin, long fingers. The black seed contrasted with her pure, fair skin. The chess game had reached a difficult stage. As a beginner, it was already quite impressive of her to arrive at this stage.\u201cHere?\u201d Wen Xinya placed the seed on the chess board without releasing it. She looked up to see Si Yiyan\u2019s reaction.Si Yiyan laughed with amusement. Does this young lady know the rules of Chinese chess? It was an unspoken rule that once the chess piece hit the chess board, it was considered a move and could not be undone. She still had a lot to learn about the etiquette of Chinese chess. However, Si Yiyan was amazed by her child-like nature and playfulness. \u201cHmm. This is a good move. As long as I don\u2019t interfere with the pieces in this area you will be able to conquer it.\u201dWen Xinya happily retracted her hand. It\u2019s considered a move and cannot be undone. Then she asked as if she suddenly thinking of something, \u201cWhat if you choose to interfere?\u201d\u201cIf I were to interfere\u2026\u201d Si Yiyan looked at her smilingly and then pointed to the position right beside her chess piece.Wen Xinya glanced towards the position he was pointing at. She immediately withdrew the black chess piece she placed earlier, realizing the possibility of losing all of her other black chess seeds with that move. \u201cHow can you cheat!\u201dSi Yiyan laughed harder at her furious expression. He took a piece of white chess seed and placed it at another position.Wen Xinya happily removed a few seeds from the chessboard and counted them. She then took another piece of black chess seed and asked, \u201cSo, what should be my next move?\u201dSi Yiyan looked at her but remained silent.Wen Xinya then placed the seed in her hand on the chessboard and peeped at Si Yiyan to see him frowning slightly. She retracted her hand, content that she had made a good move.Si Yiyan was well aware of everything she did, though she thought she was discreet. He was just playing along. It was a bad move that caused a great downfall to the black seeds.Wen Xinya looked at the defeated black seeds and it became clear to her that she was being misled. \u201cYou did it on purpose,\u201d she said angrily.Si Yiyan responded with a smile, \u201cThis strategy is known as \u2018luring the opponent with an illusion\u2019. The concept of Chinese chess strategies is similar to deploying troops on a battlefield. Deceiving the enemy is a tactic commonly used.\u201dWen Xinya was devastated. He was giving her guidance earlier so that she would be off guard and he could defeat her in a single move. \u201cYou are cunning.\u201dAt this moment, Mother He led Qiu Yifan and Ouyang Feng into the living room.Wen Xinya walked over with a smile. She invited them to the agarwood chairs beside the tea table for a seat. \u201cAttorney Qiu, Ouyang Feng, please take a seat.\u201dFrom this situation, Si Yiyan knew she was going to have a serious discussion with the gentlemen and would prefer not to have an outsider around. He looked carefully at Ouyang Feng. He was around 25 or 26 years of age with a sturdy built. Though his face was swollen, it was obvious that he had defined features and looked quite handsome. When did she come to know this young man?Si Yiyan took his time to clear the chess board before moving to the backyard.Wen Xinya brewed some tea with smooth and skillful moves, then served the tea to Qiu Yifan and Ouyang Feng.Ouyang Feng was taken aback by the affluent status of the Mo Family. During his stay at the hospital, he had secretly investigated Wen Xinya\u2019s identity. He found out she was the lost granddaughter of the Wen Family and had just returned recently, and was now staying temporarily with her Grampy Mo Xianqi.Though he had already guessed that her identity was unique, what he found out from the investigations was far more shocking.Qiu Yifan took a sip from the teacup. Then he pulled out the agreement of debt from his briefcase and handed it over to Wen Xinya together with her bank card. \u201cIt has been my honor. The matter has been settled.\u201dWen Xinya received the items without even looking carefully at them and said, \u201cI have absolute trust in Attorney Qiu to handle this. I think it was overkill for your talent to deal with such a small task.\u201dQiu Yifan laughed. \u201cIt is an attorney\u2019s duty to deal with all tasks assigned by our clients. It won\u2019t matter how big or small the task is.\u201dWen Xinya smiled with satisfaction and replied, \u201cI would like Attorney Qiu to become my personal lawyer. What do you think?\u201dQiu Yifan said, \u201cI have been serving both your Grampy and Mother for their personal properties and other matters. I have no objection to Missus Wen\u2019s request.\u201dWen Xinya raised her teacup with respect and said to Qiu Yifan, \u201cI look forward to our pleasant cooperation!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll have a pleasant cooperation!\u201d Qiu Yifan cheered.Wen Xinya turned to Ouyang Feng and said, \u201cI have the intention to start an investment firm. Based on your experience, how much capital do I need to start with?\u201dHer thought of starting an investment firm only came about after she met Ouyang Feng, and she had given it some serious consideration. Firstly, she would be able to quickly get some cash flow. And secondly, an investment firm could be diversified, hence minimizing her risks. It would also allow her to sharpen her financial and business skills by closely monitoring the direction of market demand. With the help of the future internationally famous financial genius, she wasn\u2019t worried at all.And the most important reason of all it would be once the investment firm was set up, there will be future opportunities for her company to work with other influential businesses and wealthy individuals, providing mutually beneficial relationships in the financial world. Building such strong connections would be an important asset for Wen Xinya.After all, her objective was to build assets and capital for herself.Ouyang Feng wasn\u2019t surprised at all. However, he was a little amazed by her decisiveness. \u201cFor the investment firm, which categories of clients will it be serving?\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cGlobal enterprises, well-known tycoons and some rich and powerful people.\u201dRight from the beginning, she locked her vision on what Ouyang Feng had achieved in her previous life about 10 years from this day. With this goal in mind, she believed she could attain it with his help.Ouyang Feng was shocked by her ambition. \u201cThe startup capital is estimated to be around 20 million dollars.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya frowned. She had just returned to the Wen Family, and the amount of money currently in her possession was the sum of 15 years\u2019 living expenses her Father had given to her. That was approximately five million dollars, far from the required 20 million dollars. Though Grampy was wealthy and 20 million dollars to him was only the tip of the iceberg, she felt sorry at the thought of him having to sell off his antiques in order to get this amount of money.Was borrowing from Grampy her only option?Previously she was almost driven out from the Wen Family, and Grandpa was guilty towards her for this incident. If she were to borrow from him, he wouldn\u2019t reject her. But on the other hand, she didn\u2019t want Grandpa to know she was starting her own investment company.Ouyang Feng also guessed that Wen Xinya was vexed over the amount of money required to start the investment company. He wouldn\u2019t expect her to have that much money on hand. Though she was Missus Wen from the Wen Family, she had only just returned recently and did not have a strong relationship with the family. It would be difficult for her to raise 20 million dollars in a short amount of time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In Country M, there were numerous investment companies on Wall Street alone. They were just like money-printing machines. The amount transacted in one business day was as huge as 20 billion dollars.In recent years, interest in investment and trading within Country Z was also rising. However, trades were mostly handled by investment companies acting as middlemen. They transacted most of these funds to international markets, causing an increasing outflow of clients\u2019 funds.When Wen Xinya suggested starting an investment company it wasn\u2019t on impulse. She had done her research on Ouyang Feng\u2019s background and knew that he was a financial genius who graduated from the Royal University from the United Kingdom. From internship to completing his doctorate studies, he had done it within three years. After returning to his home country, he started an investment firm with his friends and the firm became successful within two years. Unfortunately, he was jailed because of his company\u2019s involvement in money-laundering activities and was just released from jail recently.It wasn\u2019t difficult for Wen Xinya to come up with the idea of starting an investment company when she knew she had the support of a financial genius.She was confident they could be very successful with the company.She must have possessed extraordinary courage, vision and planning to be able to display such decisiveness.As a professional lawyer employed personally by Wen Xinya, Qiu Yifan felt obliged to provide her with the best legal advice within his responsibilities. \u201cMissus Wen, you have an official document of a will at the Chaofan Lawyer Corporation awaiting your acknowledgment and acceptance.\u201dWen Xinya was confused. \u201cWhat document is that?\u201d\u201cYour Mother, Madam Mo Yunyao, drafted a will on the Year 1995 December 24th, appointing Chaofan Lawyer Corporation to be in charge of it. In the will she stated that you will inherit all her assets, including savings, real estate, stocks, and shares. However, you will not be able to access them until you reach 18-years-old,\u201d Qiu Yifan explained.Wen Xinya gasped. Year 1995 December 24th, it was when Mother was about seven months pregnant. She drafted the will a few months before delivery. Could it be because Granny died of dystocia, therefore she\u2026Wen Xinya became emotional. December 24th, it was Christmas Eve. Mother choosing to draft her will on this day seemed like she hoped to give Wen Xinya her good blessings.\u201cIs Xia Ruya aware of the existence of this will?\u201d Wen Xinya asked.Qiu Yifan replied, \u201cShe isn\u2019t aware of it. Chaofan Lawyer Corporation will keep the will confidential until there\u2019s a DNA test result proving the heir\u2019s identity.\u201dWen Xinya immediately understood the situation. When Xia Ruya returned to the Wen Family, she did not carry out any DNA test. Therefore, Chaofan Lawyer Corporation didn\u2019t have any records of her test result and hence wouldn\u2019t reveal to her about the will\u2019s existence. \u201cIn that case, how can I access the funds?\u201dThis child was intelligent. She did not ask whether she could access the funds. Instead, she skipped this question and directly asked what were the options she had to access the funds. She could sense Qiu Yifan\u2019s hint that there were certain ways for her to access these funds. He replied, covering up with a cough, \u201cThough according to the will you cannot access the money now, there are some loopholes. You can mortgage the real estate and stocks to the bank for a loan. The paperwork will be a bit of a hassle, but that shouldn\u2019t be a big problem.Cough!\u201dWen Xinya thanked him with her eyes wide open. \u201cThank you for your assistance, Attorney Qiu.\u201d She realized what it meant by \u201cnever judge a book by its cover.\u201d The stern-looking Attorney Qiu was teaching her how to make use of the loopholes of the law.Qiu Yifan adjusted his drooping spectacles. \u201cThis will was done 15 years ago. We\u2019ll need to re-evaluate the value of the assets, thus it might take a while,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya acknowledged. \u201cWhat can I do to help?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll need a copy of a complete business proposal. It\u2019ll be useful when getting a loan from the bank. Nothing else apart from that. If there is, I\u2019ll let you know again,\u201d said Qiu Yifan.Wen Xinya smiled. \u201cI will get it done soon.\u201dQiu Yifan\u2019s support gave her even more confidence. She thought of how successful Ouyang Feng\u2019s investment company was in her previous life. It was a globally known company and a pioneer of its kind in the trading industry. It also had access to political resources and was managing up to 15 billion US Dollars, thus becoming one of the top 10 investment companies in the world.Qiu Yifan stood up and bid farewell. \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I would like to make a move and start working on the matters we\u2019ve discussed earlier.\u201dWen Xinya stood up too. \u201cAttorney Qiu, let me accompany you to the door.\u201dAfter sending Qiu Yifan away, Wen Xinya returned to her seat. She told Ouyang Feng, \u201cI am not familiar with investments or trading. As for the proposal which Attorney Qiu mentioned earlier, I\u2019ll leave that to you. And because I am not 18 yet, we shall name you as the Director of the company. We\u2019ll amend that when I\u2019ve reached the legal age of 18.\u201dHer unwavering trust in him made him feel appreciated, but also pressured at the same time. \u201cXinya, there\u2019s no rush in building the company. You\u2019re aware that I have a criminal record and was recently released from jail. A person\u2019s character is an extremely important factor in the investment career. I\u2019m afraid I might cause you to lose money.\u201dWhen Ouyang Feng was just released from jail, and his relatives and friends had severed ties with him. Whenever someone heard about his criminal record, they immediately looked at him differently. He just wasn\u2019t confident in managing a large organization.Wen Xinya shook her head. \u201cNo. I have a clear vision and know what I want to achieve. I will not be affected by such unrealistic concerns. I\u2019m sure you are well aware of my situation. An investment firm is just a stepping stone for me to accumulate my assets. Most importantly, we will do whatever it takes to succeed.\u201dOuyang Feng was amazed by her ambition. \u201cBut\u2026\u201dWen Xinya stared straight into his eyes. \u201cIs my pace too fast that it makes you feel I am too goal-oriented?\u201dOuyang Feng nodded. \u201cThat is how I feel.\u201dWen Xinya laughed. \u201cThat is the difference between you and me. You came from a lower-income family and had to prove yourself by putting in hard work to create an extraordinary life. From now onwards, you will also move towards success with your effort. As for me, I am the Missus Wen from the Wen Family. Right from the moment I returned to the Wen Family, my starting point reached an unimaginable height. I shall make good use of my new starting point to strategize my future and career.\u201dOuyang Feng smiled bitterly. She was right. He shouldn\u2019t judge her based on his own experience. \u201cOk, I understand.\u201dWen Xinya pushed herself up with both arms on the tea table, leaned towards Ouyang Feng and looked firmly into his eyes. \u201cI want to hear from you, do you have the confidence?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer eyes were gleaming like a clear crystal, filled with confidence and determination. He couldn\u2019t avoid her eye-contact. \u201cYes!\u201d he replied.Wen Xinya\u2019s lips raised slowly in a smile, like snow melting in the spring. And it turned into a warm smile as beautiful as a spring blossomed flower. \u201cI knew it. I have put my trust in the right person. You only need to focus on moving towards our goal and leave all other matters to me. There\u2019s nothing else you need to worry about except achieving success.\u201dHer warm smile and passion were contagious, and he could feel the enthusiasm from within his body. He nodded firmly and said, \u201cGreat!\u201dWen Xinya lightly patted on his shoulder. \u201cWe will definitely succeed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With the help of the financial genius, Ouyang Feng, it became much easier for her. Qiu Yifan also did a re-evaluation on her mother\u2019s real estates and stocks. They were worth about fifty million dollars.Ouyang Feng did not disappoint her as well. He completed the required business proposal within three days. Even Qiu Yifan praised, saying that the proposal was well done. Qiu Yifan was able to apply for a loan from the bank with this proposal. Though the paperwork was tedious, Qiu Yifan had everything under control. Things were progressing smoothly as Wen Xinya had expected.\u201cLet\u2019s name the company \u2018Lanxin\u2019!\u201d Wen Xinya suggested. In her previous life, the next 25 years spent in the Wen Family after her return, she was still the street gangster Zhang Xiaolan. Though she was renamed Wen Xinya, she had been Zhang Xiaolan for another 25 years! In this lifetime, she could only be Wen Xinya. She wanted to use her past experience as a reminder, to become independent and stronger in this lifetime.Ouyang Feng had no objection!Now they had to decide on the business address and the company\u2019s registration. Wen Xinya pointed out a location within the Capital city on the map. \u201cThis will be the location of our company.\u201dOuyang Feng frowned. \u201cThis area is near the West Coast and is a little remote. I think it would be more convenient to set up our company in the business district area.\u201dWen Xinya smiled but remained silent. Though this was a remote location, she was aware that the Government would be announcing a new project for building the East-West train route in May next year. This new line of train stations would greatly increase the valuation of the lands in the West Coast area, almost making it into a land of gold. And with this new train line, there will be increasing numbers of new commercial buildings in the area connecting to the Southern part. The location she pointed was the conjunction between the Western and Southern parts, which would become the golden commercial district in the near future. There couldn\u2019t be a more suitable location than this.Wen Xinya was hoping Ouyang Feng could quickly earn enough capital for her to acquire the land in the West Coast area so that she could profit from the rise in valuation.Ouyang Feng looked at her expression. She seemed to know something that he wasn\u2019t aware of. He asked with confusion, \u201cWe have enough capital. Why don\u2019t we choose a better location?\u201dWen Xinya looked at him with a serious look. \u201cOuyang Feng, our country\u2019s economy is progressing, and this helps the development of the city. The theme of a developing city is \u2018convenient\u2019 and \u2018economical\u2019.\u201dOuyang Feng wasn\u2019t convinced. He looked closely at the map again. There seemed to be a hidden meaning in her words, but he wasn\u2019t able to understand. It was too bad that he didn\u2019t have the power to predict the future like Wen Xinya, who was given the opportunity of rebirth.Now that most of the company\u2019s setup was done, Wen Xinya was relieved. \u201cRegarding the new company, I\u2019ll leave it to you to manage. Tomorrow Grampy will return from the Southern City. When he\u2019s back, my learning schedule will be packed and I might not have enough time. If you have any law-related queries, you can look for Qiu Yifan,\u201d she said.Ouyang Feng nodded. \u201cPlease do not worry. I will take care of the remaining tasks.\u201dAfter Ouyang Feng left, Wen Xinya went over to Chaofan Lawyer Corporation after informing Si Yiyan. She had made an appointment to meet another attorney who was introduced by Qiu Yifan at 2 o\u2019clock.Wen Xinya arrived at Chaofan Lawyer Corporation at ten before 2 o\u2019clock. \u201cGood afternoon. How can I help you?\u201d asked the receptionist with a sweet smile.Wen Xinya replied, \u201cI am looking for Attorney Cheng, Cheng Ziyi. I have an appointment with him at 2 o\u2019clock.\u201d\u201cPlease wait for a moment. I\u2019ll call Attorney Cheng for confirmation.\u201d The receptionist was a little surprised. The great Attorney Cheng was no ordinary lawyer. He was a well known and sought after attorney, and he was extremely selective on clients who can meet his criteria.Wen Xinya nodded. She had learned about this Attorney Cheng Ziyi, knowing that he was one of the top four lawyers in Chaofan Lawyer Corporation and had expertise in criminal cases. He had a good track record of not losing a single case and had a high prominence in the industry.The receptionist hung up the phone. \u201cHello, Missus Wen! Attorney Cheng is available now. Let me show you the way to Conference Room Number Four.\u201dThe receptionist led Wen Xinya to the third floor through an escalator. Then they arrived at Conference Room Number Four. Cheng Ziyi was already sitting in the meeting room with a stack of documents in his hands, waiting for her.Wen Xinya knocked the door lightly twice before walking slowly into the Conference Room.\u201cSit!\u201d Cheng Ziyi was busy looking at the documents and did not even take a glance at her.For others, they might find him arrogant and unreasonable. But as for Wen Xinya, she could feel that he took pride and was serious about his work. She walked towards the round table and sat down, then randomly picked a law magazine from the shelf and started reading.\u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d Cheng Ziyi asked while still flipping through the documents in his hands.\u201cTea, please. Thank you!\u201d Wen Xinya replied with a smile.Cheng Ziyi pressed the intercom button on the telephone on top of the round table. \u201cChen, bring me a cup of hot tea.\u201dCheng Ziyi was looking at the file for a money-laundering case of a partnership company that happened during 2008. This was the reason Wen Xinya came for.Cheng Ziyi was around his 30s. He was quite good-looking, wearing a dark blue shirt with two buttons unbuttoned at the chest level, revealing his bronze-colored skin. The sleeves of his shirt were rolled up to the elbows, showing his muscular forearms, fully displaying the charm of a mature man.Cheng Ziyi placed the file on the table. \u201cI have read through the case and studied it carefully. There shouldn\u2019t be any major problems submitting this case for an appeal. However, I would like to see the main involved party to find out more details from him. And I may even be able to discover new evidence.\u201d\u201cThank you, Attorney Cheng, for agreeing to help me.\u201d What a diplomatic answer! Wen Xinya could detect from his tone that he wasn\u2019t too keen on taking up the case. His capabilities were overkill for such a small case. The reason he agreed to do so was probably out of goodwill towards Qiu Yifan.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI would like to know, what are your views on this case?\u201d Cheng Ziyi looked straight into the young lady\u2019s eyes, who was only 15-years-old. He had found out from Qiu Yifan earlier that she was working with Ouyang Feng to set up an investment company. That was why she requested his help to appeal on Ouyang Feng\u2019s behalf, hoping to help erase Ouyang Feng\u2019s criminal records.Frankly speaking, he admired the decisiveness and determination of this young lady. What appealed to him, even more, was her identity as the missing granddaughter of the Wen Family and the only grandchild of Old Master Mo. He also had great respect for Old Master Mo, that was why he had agreed to do Wen Xinya a favor.\u201cI only needed to know if Ouyang Feng was innocent. I know Attorney Cheng is someone who stands by your principles. You wouldn\u2019t allow someone to make his own gains by making use of the loopholes in the law system.\u201d In other words, Cheng Ziyi too believed Ouyang Feng was innocent. That was why he agreed to take on the case. He would definitely do his best, and a small case like this wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him. In fact, her opinion on the case didn\u2019t matter at all.\u201cYou are indeed extraordinary,\u201d replied Cheng Ziyi with a smile. When Qiu Yifan approached him earlier, he was curious as to why Qiu Yifan would agree to help a young teenage girl who was only 15-years-old. It couldn\u2019t be solely based on the relationship between the Qiu Family and the Mo Family. Qiu Yifan told him that this young lady was extraordinary and it was interesting working with her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The amount of the loan was 30 million dollars. Wen Xinya, together with Qiu Yifan and Ouyang Feng, went to the bank and settled the paperwork, successfully transferring the money to an account that was registered under Grampy\u2019s name.With Qiu Yifan\u2019s assistance, the set up of the company was a breeze.\u201cWhat are you thinking about? The ink slab will be destroyed if you continue to grind it.\u201d Si Yiyan placed the calligraphy brush on the table and focused his vision on her.Though he wasn\u2019t sure what was the content of their discussion a few days ago, he had guessed that there was something going on, as she had been frequently meeting with Qiu Yifan and Ouyang Feng in recent days.Si Yiyan had investigated about Ouyang Feng and knew his background. It wasn\u2019t difficult to guess her intention of starting an investment company with him.Once again Wen Xinya had impressed Si Yiyan with her decisiveness and courage and was able to devise a concrete plan of actions based on her vision. He was able to clearly see her change, from a young street gangster to an entrepreneur who had a great ambition of building her own financial career through starting an investment company.\u201cHow is it possible for me to destroy an ink slab? You are just being difficult with me!\u201d Wen Xinya was deep in thought about her earlier meeting at the Chaofan Lawyer Corporation. She recovered from her daze and controlled her emotions when she heard Si Yiyan.Si Yiyan remained silent. He took another ink slab from the shelf, added a small amount of water on it and started grinding with the right amount of strength. Then, he picked up his calligraphy brush and started writing the word \u201cxin\u201d on a piece of paper. \u201cPlease look carefully.\u201dThe word \u201cxin\u201d appeared gracefully on paper in the Liu-calligraphy font. It was simple yet elegant. With such expressive and harmonious strokes, in unity with his skillful writing, Si Yiyan was able to display the toughness in his strokes, accomplishing exactly what the Liu-calligraphy font represented.Grampy had mentioned this before, the Liu-calligraphy font was one that could most accurately present the temperament of the writer. He had to focus on his brush strokes with absolute purity of mind. The font was thin but had power in every stroke, expressing the beauty and gracefulness of the bamboo. When she started learning about calligraphy, Grampy asked her which font she would like to start with. She chose Liu-calligraphy font without hesitation.\u201cWhat did you notice?\u201d asked Si Yiyan plainly.\u201cI know you have good calligraphy skills. You don\u2019t have to show off in front of me.\u201d Wen Xinya looked at the nicely written word in Liu-calligraphy font and secretly admired it with envy and jealousy.\u201cI am not referring to the font. I am asking if you have noticed any difference between using the two ink slabs.\u201d Si Yiyan knocked her forehead lightly with his hand.Wen Xinya took a closer look and immediately noticed the difference. Words written with the ink from the ink slab she used were dull. There was no power in her strokes and the dampness from the ink permeated the paper. As for the word written with Si Yiyan\u2019s ink slab, its black ink glowed and there was power in each stroke. There wasn\u2019t any ink permeation on the paper he used. \u201cWhy is that so?\u201dSi Yiyan replied with a smile, \u201cThere is also great knowledge behind the skill of ink slab grinding. You want to learn?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Wen Xinya looked at Si Yiyan with a sparkle in her eyes.\u201cCome over and stand beside me!\u201d Si Yiyan waved and signaled for her to come over. His eyes gleamed as if he had finally achieved what he wanted.Wen Xinya only had a great desire to learn about the skills of using an ink slab, so she didn\u2019t notice anything on his expression. When he waved to her, she immediately went over and stood beside him. \u201cWill you teach me?\u201d\u201cMmm. I will only teach you once, and I want you to pay full attention.\u201d Si Yiyan emphasized the last two words.Wen Xinya expressed her sincerity. \u201cI will pay full attention.\u201dDeepening his smile, Si Yiyan repositioned himself and stood behind Wen Xinya. He placed his chest against Wen Xinya\u2019s back and he could feel her boney figure from behind.Wen Xinya suddenly felt the warmth from behind. It almost caused her to miss a heartbeat. She tried to move aside with a panic. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to teach me how to use the ink slab, why are you\u2026\u201dSi Yiyan stretched his hand over hers that was holding an ink stick. \u201cLet me show you once how to do it properly so that you can experience the correct grinding tempo.\u201dHearing his explanation, Wen Xinya heaved a sigh of relief. Though she continued to feel the warmth from his hug from behind and it seemed to be tempting her to lean backward, she didn\u2019t feel as nervous as before.\u201cRelax your body. Your arm is too stiff. Hold it naturally with your fingers.\u201d Si Yiyan was smiling while busy correcting her posture. He adjusted her waist with one hand and patted her arm with another.\u201cIs this correct?\u201d Wen Xinya did not allow her thoughts to run wild. She followed his instructions and adjusted herself accordingly, though she wasn\u2019t completely aware that he was almost giving her a close hug in that posture.Si Yiyan continued holding her waist with an arm as a matter of course, guiding her hand in the grinding action on the ink slab. \u201cThe amount of strength used is important. Not too hard nor too soft. Do it with the correct tempo, do not rush. Ensure the ink is evenly spread across the surface.\u201dHis warm breath landed on the back of her ears. It made her thoughts run wild. The low and manly voice spoke right into her ear. She could almost feel the exact movement of his tongue\u2014lifting, curling, suppressing with every word coming out from his mouth. From her back, she could feel his heartbeat\u2014lub-dub, lub-dub\u2014from his chest. Wen Xinya\u2019s heart rate suddenly increased.This felt weird, as if he was flirting with her!She thought.Wen Xinya turned her head slightly and secretly peeped at him. He had locked his vision on their hands that were stacked on top of each other, focused on guiding her hands in the correct tempo while explaining to her the right techniques to use.He looked so serious that it made Wen Xinya doubt herself for letting her mind run wild, causing her to be unable to concentrate. She immediately directed her attention back to the lesson.Noticing that her attention was diverted, Si Yiyan let go fully of the deep breath he was holding and embraced Wen Xinya\u2019s mild fragrance. He too found himself unable to concentrate.\u201cYou have a sweaty palm. Are you feeling hot?\u201d Wen Xinya asked abruptly. He had a big palm, with well-defined lines on his long fingers. The hard skin on his palm was lightly brushing against the smooth skin on the back of her hand. Both of their palms were getting warm with perspiration and unconsciously aroused.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSi Yiyan suddenly came back to his senses and quickly let go of her hand. He then spoke in a serious tone. \u201cNow that you are aware of how to use the ink slab better, you just need to put in more practice. Do not belittle the importance of the grinding of the ink on the ink slab. It requires a lot of practice and techniques. On the surface, it seems like we are grinding the ink sticks into ink. At the same time, it is also training our patience, hence improving our temperament.\u201dWen Xinya felt empowered with Si Yiyan\u2019s words! She nodded and said, \u201cI understand now.\u201dBefore Wen Xinya could react, Si Yiyan suddenly stretched one of his hand towards her back and pushed her waist slightly towards him to correct her posture. Their bodies were in close contact once again. \u201cGrinding on the ink slab requires proper techniques and a proper posture!\u201dSuch righteousness in his words! However, with his actions, she felt that he was the one with an improper posture.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Grampy\u2019s flight would arrive in another 30 minutes.She was waiting in the VIP lounge, looking outside through the glass window. An airplane was about to take off from the runway outside the departure hall. Once it left the ground, it flew diagonally to the sky and slowly disappeared into the clouds with only its silhouette visible from the ground.\u201cMother, it is true that I am at the airport to pick a friend. I did not go out to have fun\u2026\u201d It came from an impatient voice which sounded a little coarse due to puberty. However, it sounded manly and was actually quite charming.Wen Xinya was captured. She turned eagerly to look at the teenager from a short distance away. He had short hair dyed in grey and bright yellow, with a few long strands of fringe covering his forehead and eyes partially. The outer corners of his almond-shaped eyes were raised slightly, displaying a charming personality. He had a row of blinking ear studs on the outer loop of his left ear consisting of seven colors \u2014 black, silver, red, yellow, blue, green and magenta, further exhibiting his youth and rebellious character.Wen Xinya\u2019s vision suddenly became blurred with teary eyes. The vivid unsettling and rebellious character in her memory matched the silhouette of the teenager in front of her.He should be around 17-years-old this year!During those four years of companionship, he had accompanied her in her short lifetime, and it was the only warmth she could recall.\u201cMother, if you don\u2019t believe me, I\u2019ll get someone to talk to you.\u201d By now, the teenager was extremely impatient. He was holding his cell phone and looking around for someone to help when, suddenly, he saw Wen Xinya.The way this teenage girl looked at him was strange. She seemed to have mixed emotions of indescribable feelings. Though there were tears in her eyes, she gave him a warm smile while looking at him as if they had known each other for a long time.Without conscious effort, he walked towards this teenage girl and said, \u201cHey, help me answer this call.\u201dWen Xinya wiped her tears with a smile on her face and took the cell phone from his hand. There were a few minutes of rumbling on the other side of the line. Then she replied, \u201cThis is indeed the VIP lounge of the airport. I am here to fetch someone\u2026\u201dAfter a conversation of about 10 minutes, the person on the other side of the line finally allowed her to return the cell phone to the teenager. Wen Xinya passed the phone back to him after keying a few numbers on it.The teenager took over the cell phone, relieved, and said, \u201cMother, do you believe me now?\u201dAfter more rumbling from the other end, the teenager finally hanged up impatiently.Wen Xinya said with envy, \u201cYour Mother is nice to you.\u201dThe teenager replied while combing his hair, \u201cShe\u2019s always interfering over my matters. It\u2019s very irritating.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s face turned sour. \u201cI did not have a Mother starting from a very young age. I don\u2019t know what it feels like to have a Mother.\u201dThe young man pouted for a while, not knowing what to say. He then realized he had not thanked her for her help. \u201cOh yes, thank you for what you did earlier. My name is Xu Zhenyu. What\u2019s yours?\u201dThe Xu Family was a well-known military family in the Capital city. Xu Zhenyu\u2019s Grandpa, Old Master Xu, enjoyed a prestigious status, while his Father, Xu Wenfeng, was successful in his political career. Xu Zhenyu had an elder brother, Xu Zhenhao, who was also a politician. Hence, Old Master Xu had always wished for his youngest grandson to carry on their family\u2019s tradition as civil servants and serve the military. However, Xu Zhenyu was a disappointment to the family and was far from what his Grandpa had wished for. He loved hanging out with bad company at sleazy places like Black Sunday Bar, causing the Xu Family to worry.\u201cMy name is Wen Xinya!\u201d Wen Xinya replied with a smile. In her previous life, she met Xu Zhenyu at Black Sunday Bar. At that time, he was there with his gang and she was there as well. His bad friends challenged him with some cocaine and he obliged, sniffing in the drugs through his nose.At that time, Wen Xinya was already heavily addicted to cocaine, and she was tortured every day by her drug addiction. When she saw another young teenager being coerced into taking drugs by his friends, she couldn\u2019t help feeling a strong impulsive and dragging Xu Zhenyu into an empty VIP room beside them.After the door was closed, she heaved a huge sigh of relief. With a serious face, she reprimanded him. \u201cAre you really that innocent? You are courting death! Just because you accepted your friends\u2019 challenge you\u2019re going to pay for it with your life? Do you know what that stuff was? Do you really think you\u2019ll fly by taking a sniff or two?\u201dXu Zhenyu replied with tremendous anger, \u201cYou bitch! Who are you to interfere with my matter?\u201dWhen he turned around and was about to leave, Wen Xinya grabbed his hand. \u201cHold on for another 10 minutes. If after that you still decide to carry on sniffing that harmful stuff, I will not stop you.\u201dAfter 10 minutes, Wen Xinya started having a drug seizure. She tried coping with it in the beginning, but as time went by, it became more and more difficult for her to control herself. Her entire body was curled up on the sofa, then she started rolling on the floor. It was so unbearable that she kept throwing things to distract herself. She lost all her dignity and grabbed onto Xu Zhenyu\u2019s legs, begging him\u2026The scene of her drug seizure had scared Xu Zhenyu stiff. He just stood still as if he was in a deep trance, looking at her.After that, she hadn\u2019t seen him back in Black Sunday Bar for a very long time. The next time she saw him there was when he came specially to look for her, wanting to thank her for what she did for him.From then on, Xu Zhenyu stayed by her side. He understood her sufferings and devastation. When she had drug seizures he would stay by her side, and then even attempted to help her surpass her drug addiction. However, her addiction was so strong that he never succeeded. Since then, he had used all his savings to buy cocaine for her until he was caught for possessing illegal drugs. The Xu Family chased him out and he was sentenced to a term of three years in jail.After rebirth, she had the opportunity to meet Xu Zhenyu three years earlier. She was determined to not let him go down the same path again.Xu Zhenyu stared at her with his eyes wide open. Pointing at her, he asked, \u201cYou\u2026 You are the lost granddaughter of the Wen Family who wandered in the streets for past 15 years and only now returned to the Wen Family recently?\u201dWen Xinya nodded. \u201cMmm. Is there a problem?\u201dXu Zhenyu was tongue-tied. He replied after a while, \u201cNo\u2026 No problem!\u201dRumors were indeed misleading. They had described such a young beautiful teenager to be an unrefined street gangster full of vulgarity, who was seen to behave and talk rudely.\u201cWhat would you do to show your appreciation for my help?\u201d Wen Xinya slowly raised her head and look at him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXu Zhenyu was offended. \u201cIt was just answering a phone call, it\u2019s not considered a big help. You have the cheek to ask me for a return of favor?\u201dWen Xinya replied plainly, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard of the saying \u2018to return a small favor with huge gratitude\u2019? If it wasn\u2019t for me, would you be able to stop your mum\u2019s questioning?\u201dXu Zhenyu was speechless. After a while, he said reluctantly, \u201cJust tell me what you want from me!\u201dWen Xinya looked up and said, \u201cI like the ear studs you\u2019re wearing on your left ear.

Each of them had a natural diamond on it and they were worth a lot. During the process of acquiring them, he had spent all his savings and even had to rob from the Xu Family members. In her previous life, he sold all these precious ear studs in order to buy more cocaine for Wen Xinya.Xu Zhenyu was angry and reacted like a provoked cat in fight mode. \u201cWhatever for? I should give them to you just because you like them? Do you know how much these seven precious ear studs cost? They\u2019re worth more than 20 million dollars! This is unreasonable, I can have you arrested for conning.\u201dWen Xinya casually picked up her cell phone and started playing games on it. \u201cSo you don\u2019t intend to return the favor? You don\u2019t show appreciation to someone who helped you when you were in need and want to arrest me instead! Do you still consider yourself a man?\u201dXu Zhenyu\u2019s face was flushed with anger. \u201cOf course I am a man! I\u2019m just giving a casual remark, I have no real intention of arresting you. It\u2019s not that I do not wish to return the favor, it\u2019s just that your request is too unreasonable,\u201d he stammered.Wen Xinya stepped forward and stood right in front of him. \u201cHow is my request unreasonable? Is it that you are unable to fulfill my request, or did I make you act against your conscience or do an illegal act?\u201d she said in an aggressive tone.\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201d Xu Zhenyu was slowly forced into the trail of thought she wanted him to be in, but he just felt that something wasn\u2019t right. Her aggressive tone and the sparkle in her eyes made him feel guilty, with his heart rate increasing. He uncontrollably thought of the scene earlier when she looked at him with her teary eyes, making him feel sorry for her. It seemed like she had the right to demand anything from him.\u201cIf not, then\u2026 give them to me!\u201d Wen Xinya stretched out her fair palm as if everything was normal.Everyone Xu Zhenyu knew, including his bad friends, was always extremely polite towards him. Even his Grandpa, parents and elder brother showered him with love and care. In his entire lifetime, he had not been treated this way nor seen anyone talk to him in such an aggressive tone. He was caught in a trance and obliged to her request before he realized what he was doing. \u201cJust one?\u201d He asked.\u201cMmm-hmm!\u201d Wen Xinya held her palm closer to him.Xu Zhenyu looked at her palm; it was fair and as pure as jade with long, thin fingers. Her fingernails had clear nail polish and were well maintained, reflecting a beautiful, healthy pinkish color\u2026He started taking deeper breaths with a rising heart rate as his ears started to blush.Raising her eyebrow, Wen Xinya asked, \u201cWhat? You can\u2019t bear to give it away?\u201dFlustered, he removed the red diamond ear stud and placed it on her palm. He then spoke in a fierce tone to attempt to conceal his agitation, \u201cWho said so? It\u2019s just an ear stud. I\u2019m giving it to you now.\u201dWhile still in panic mode, his finger brushed against the tender skin of her palm, feeling soft and smooth. As his heart almost jumped out from his mouth, the blush spread from his ears to his face.\u201cI can see your sincerity, so I shall accept it gracefully.\u201d Wen Xinya happily received the ear stud. She took a closer look and had a sense of unspeakable mixed emotions. He gave the same red diamond ear stud to her as a gift in her previous life. But\u2026 she used it to exchange for cocaine when she couldn\u2019t control her urge.Though she had asked for it, she acted as if it didn\u2019t matter to her, making Xu Zhenyu feel disgusted. \u201cAren\u2019t you the Missus Wen from the wealthy Wen Family? You got excited over a red diamond and behaved like someone who\u2019s green and inexperienced in the world.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! I\u2019m green and inexperienced!\u201d Wen Xinya didn\u2019t mind his sarcastic remark. She removed the ear stud on her left ear and replaced it with the red diamond ear stud Xu Zhenyu gave her.As Xu Zhenyu suddenly remembered her identity, he turned his face away in embarrassment. Then, as he peeped at her again and saw that she wasn\u2019t looking at him at all, he froze, not knowing how to react. Looking at the new bloody red ear stud glowing on her ear, he saw it matched her style perfectly, enhancing her charm and enchantment.\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d He pointed at the red diamond ear stud, trembling. He became so nervous that he was unable to continue with his sentence. He got this red diamond ear stud at his sixteenth birthday, but now it belonged to someone else.\u201cNow this red diamond ear stud belongs to me. Don\u2019t ever think of getting it back.\u201d Wen Xinya gave him a hard stare. She assumed he must have regretted giving it to her and had the intention of asking it back.\u201cI\u2026 I did not\u2026 have\u2026 the intention\u2026 of asking it back!\u201d Xu Zhenyu stammered while trying to complete his sentence. He suddenly drooped his head and didn\u2019t dare look her in the eyes.\u201cIt looks nice on me!\u201d Wen Xinya was admiring herself, looking at her reflection through the cell phone.Xu Zhenyu subconsciously raised his head to look at her again. He realized she was the prettiest girl he had ever seen.She wasn\u2019t like any girls he had seen in his entire life\u2014she was not stern like his mother, nor was she like those young girls from the wealthy families who were always trying to act elegantly at all times. And she was absolutely unlike those girls who hung out at sleazy bars, always dressed scantily with thick makeups and strong perfumes, eagerly preying on any men they saw.\u201cYou are so gullible! Are all wealthy people naive? I only helped you by answering a call and you willingly gave me a diamond ear stud that\u2019s worth a few million dollars. There must be a lot of bad company around you trying to get into your good books, trying to to get some easy monetary benefits from you.\u201d Wen Xinya looked at the watch on her wrist. Realizing Grampy\u2019s flight had landed, she left the VIP lounge and walked towards the VIP passageway to wait for Grampy\u2019s arrival.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXu Zhenyu\u2019s distress suddenly disappeared. No one had ever dared talk to him this way. It caused his body to tremble with fear. He\u2019d never expect her to look at him this way, full of sarcasm and criticism. When she left the lounge without looking back, he started to doubt himself.Right at this moment, his cell phone rang and interrupted his thoughts. As soon as he answered the call, the person on the other side of the line started rumbling. \u201cHey Xu-er, what happened? I thought you had agreed to pick me up at the airport? My flight landed 20 minutes ago and your line was occupied. Why aren\u2019t you here yet? Are you with your bad friends? I\u2019ve told you many times that these people are only after your money, they are not your true friends. You\u2019ll soon get into trouble if you continue to hang out with them\u2026\u201dXu Zhenyu grew impatient again. He felt cold from within, as if a pail of cold water had been poured over him. \u201cHan Mofeng, will you shut up? I am at the VIP lounge of the airport right now.\u201dThe phone rang again soon after he hung up. This time, there was deafening disco music with screams of a party in the background. \u201cHello, Second Young Master\u2026 You said you would join us soon at the disco after fetching a friend. Why aren\u2019t you and your friend here yet? I have booked the most expensive room with the best hostesses. Who\u2019s going to pay if you don\u2019t show up?

He was angry that they were not even willing to pay the bill for once. He was always the one paying the bill every time they had parties and felt that he was being taken for a ride.Right at this moment, Han Mofeng walked into the VIP lounge with his luggage. He was a radiant, handsome man wearing a light purple shirt. \u201cYo, Xu-er, what happened to you? Why are you so angry? This is the latest luxury diamond cell phone from Savelli and it costs over a hundred thousand dollars, but you\u2019re throwing it on the floor? Such a naive rich guy.\u201dXu Zhenyu got even angrier. He kicked the cell phone even further away and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right! I am a damn naive rich guy.\u201dSecond Young Master Xu stomped out of the VIP lounge furiously. This was the first time he was ridiculed by a woman. No\u2026 it should be a young and ignorant kid. And he was feeling bitter about it.What Xu Zhenyu didn\u2019t realize was that he was really affected by the way Wen Xinya looked at him earlier. He felt that he even if he couldn\u2019t give her a good impression of being a matured man, he didn\u2019t want her to feel that he was just another naive wealthy teenager.While Wen Xinya was pondering how she could change Xu Zhenyu, her words had unintentionally offended him and he was already on the path of changing to what Wen Xinya had hoped him to become.Han Mofeng quickly chased after him with his luggage. \u201cWhy are you so angry? What is it this time? Your mother interfered in your matters? Your Grandpa lectured you? Or did you father beat you with his leather belt again?\u201dSecond Young Master Xu couldn\u2019t be bothered to respond. He was deep in his thoughts over what had just happened. It mattered a lot to him when Wen Xinya said he was naive. It was just a small favor he asked from her to answer a phone call, but not only did she ask to be compensated with a valuable diamond ear stud, she even despised him and called him naive\u2026Han Mofeng did not get a reply to his questions. He then attempted to talk sense into him again. \u201cI have been telling you that you are someone who doesn\u2019t realize how fortunate you are. Do you know how many people are born into this world without parents to take care of them? Or, even though some have parents but they are not fulfilling their duties as parents. Your family loves you dearly. It\u2019s natural for them to be worried about seeing you hanging out with bad company in the Capital city.\u201dXu Zhenyu suddenly recalled that earlier Wen Xinya had mentioned she had lost her mother at a very young age\u2026 He swung his head hard, thinking he must be insane to keep thinking about her and getting upset over what she said.Xu Zhenyu remained silent. Previously, whenever Han Mofeng talked about this subject, he would always interrupt him with impatience. \u201cXu-er, seriously, the bad company you hang out with, they are a bunch of good-for-nothings. It doesn\u2019t do you any good to be with them. Do you know you have become a well-known idler in the Capital city and some even call you a street gangster.\u201dXu Zhenyu suddenly stopped walking. Han Mofeng, who was right behind him, didn\u2019t manage to stop in time and slammed himself hard into Xu Zhenyu\u2019s back, hurting his nose. He complained while stroking his nose. \u201cOh Second Young Master Xu, why are you behaving oddly? After making me wait for over 30 minutes at the airport, you even ignore me when I talk to you. Now you suddenly stopped walking and even hurt my nose. I should be the one who is frustrated\u2026\u201dSecond Young Master Xu stared at him. \u201cYou know how the people in the Capital city look at me?\u201dHan Mofeng was intimidated by his stare and quickly nodded. \u201cYes, I know! Who in the Capital city doesn\u2019t know that Second Young Master Xu is a loafer? You are not young anymore. How could you continue to waste your life away by slacking\u2026\u201dXu Zhenyu was shocked. He realized it wasn\u2019t only her who despised him. It was him who had already earned a bad reputation in the Capital city!Han Mofeng had a weird feeling about Xu Zhenyu. It seemed like something had happened, causing him to behave oddly today. \u201cSecond Young Master Xu, what happened to you?\u201dXu Zhenyu suddenly looked up and asked him, \u201cHan Mofeng, do you know what kind of boys do girls like?\u201dXu Zhenyu had a strange look on his face. Han Mofeng asked, \u201cSecond Young Master Xu, are you thinking about girls?\u201dXu Zhenyu clenched his teeth, furious at his question, and replied, \u201cYou are the one who\u2019s thinking about girls. Your entire family is thinking about girls. Stop asking me stupid questions and just answer me!\u201dThe more he tried to protest, the more guilty he looked. Han Mofeng looked at him as if he had made a great discovery. \u201cSecond Young Master Xu, I thought the seven ear studs were your precious possessions. You\u2019ve always refused to let us see or touch them. Why is one of your diamond ear studs missing? Did you give it to your little lover?\u201dThe image of Wen Xinya wearing the ear stud on her ear suddenly appeared in his mind, causing his ears started to blush. To conceal his emotions, Xu Zhenyu angrily stared at him. \u201cNo! Who\u2026 Who\u2026 Who has a little lover?\u201dHan Mofeng fixed his vision on Xu Zhenyu\u2019s ear and slowly moved closer to examine. \u201cThe missing one is \u2018Kissed by a Rose\u2019. That was your favorite. You said the red diamond was attention-capturing, that\u2019s why it matched your handsome look.\u201dXu Zhenyu\u2019s anger was brewing inside. He grabbed Han Mofeng\u2019s shirt and pulled him closer. \u201cCan you answer my damn question? Why are you spouting nonsense?\u201dHan Mofeng realized Xu Zhenyu\u2019s eagerness. He answered in a serious tone, \u201cGirls like boys who are tall and with a good built that can give them a sense of security, and also boys who are devoted and successful with their careers. It would be perfect if the boy they like is a hero.\u201dAt this moment, Xu Zhenyu imagined a soldier in his mind. Soldiers perfectly matched that description\u2014tall and well-built with a sense of security, well paid and successful in their careers. And most importantly, people looked up to soldiers as their heroes who protected their homeland. It was a perfect match\u2026And he remembered Grandpa always telling him about how macho he was in his younger days and how he always attracted girls easily. Girls must have a liking for soldiers!It was natural that Xu Zhenyu thought about soldiers when he heard Han Mofeng\u2019s description. He was born into a family with a military background and started hearing stories about Grandpa being a soldier and him taking part in wars. He had seen and interacted with soldiers much of his life and had a strong association with soldiers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLooking at Second Young Master Xu who was deep in his thoughts, Han Mofeng felt something was not right. \u201cHey Xu-er, did you really fell in love with someone? Who is that? How about introducing her to me and I\u2019ll give you my opinion?\u201dXu Zhenyu glanced at him. \u201cStop bothering me and get lost!\u201dSeemed like it was true. Han Mofeng thought this wasn\u2019t a good sign. He had intended to call and warn Mother Xu to inform her of what was happening later on.

When he saw them, Wen Xinya was holding Grampy\u2019s arm and they were having a happy conversation. He felt envious and jealous at the same time. That was his granddaughter, but they had never been this close.When Old Master Mo saw Old Mr. Wen, the smile on his face disappeared. Xinya was changing for the better and Grampy loved her even more, but at the same time, he resented the Wen Family for treating her badly.Wen Xinya was surprised. \u201cGrandpa, why are you here?\u201dShe looked amazed, as she\u2019d never have expected he would come to visit her. Old Mr. Wen was a little unhappy. \u201cYou\u2019ve stayed at the Mo Family for some time, so I\u2019ve come to visit and see how you\u2019re doing.\u201dHe had heard about Xinya learning chess, calligraphy, and music at Grampy\u2019s place, so he came specially to visit her.Wen Xinya was touched. She sat down beside Grandpa. \u201cThank you, Grandpa. I should be the one visiting you instead. However, I have been busy lately learning the courses of Secondary Three, and couldn\u2019t make time. Please pardon me, Grandpa.\u201d\u201cI know you have been working hard lately. I am happy you are putting in the effort to learn and will not blame you for not being able to make time,\u201d replied Grandpa while patting her hand in consolation.When Grandpa found her and knew about her unglamorous past 15 years, he was hesitant about whether to fetch her back to the Wen Family. However, he decided to do so because she was the only heir to the family. When she had returned, her bad behaviors made Grandpa unhappy, but he still held some hope that she would change someday. Seeing her hardworking now, he felt a sense of comfort within.\u201cXinya, please stay in the living room to accompany your guest.\u201d Old Master Mo did not even greet Old Mr. Wen. He turned around and proceeded towards the backyard, intending to go back to rest in his room.Though Old Master Mo was well educated, he had a sense of pride in him. When faced with someone he didn\u2019t like he would not give them much attention.Wen Xinya was in a difficult position as she was found that Grampy was just finding an excuse to leave them. However, there was nothing she could do. \u201cOkay, Grampy, please have a good rest.\u201dOld Mr. Wen felt embarrassed as well as Old Master Mo didn\u2019t even acknowledge his presence nor greeted him. They were relatives by marriage, but their relationship ended up this way.\u201cGrampy went to the Southern City for a convention and just returned. He\u2019s probably just tired due to the long flight!\u201d Wen Xinya said with a smile, trying to ease the embarrassing situation.Old Mr. Wen felt a little better. He sighed. \u201cWe have been friends for so many years. How would I not know his temperament? Yunyao married into the Wen Family and had such an ending. And you led a wandering life for the past 15 years. After all these years you finally returned to the Wen Family, and yet we have not done anything to compensate for the sufferings you\u2019ve gone through\u2026\u201dWen Xinya was not in a position to comment about what happened between her elder generations. She started brewing tea for Grandpa, her actions elegant and smooth like water. She had been practicing well and was getting more skillful over time. There were pureness and calmness in her eyes \u2014 the demeanor of an expert. Looking at her, Grandpa was reminded of Xinya\u2019s mother.Within less than a month, Wen Xinya was a totally changed person. She had acquired the good virtues of a wealthy family\u2019s daughter, and even Ruya could not be compared to her!He had to admit that Old Master Mo was indeed much better than him in guiding the younger generation.\u201cGrandpa, how is your health lately?\u201d Wen Xinya placed a cup of brewed tea in front of him.\u201cIt\u2019s still the same. Nothing much has changed. When you grow older, every day counts.\u201d Old Mr. Wen held the teacup close to him, smelling the nice fragrance from the tea. As he took a sip, the fragrance from the tea leaves lingered in his mouth. Though there was room for improvement, he was very impressed by Xinya\u2019s change in such a short time.Wen Xinya continued asking, \u201cHow are Grandma and Father?\u201dOld Mr. Wen put the teacup on the table. \u201cYour Grandma is still the same. She goes out every day for a game of Mahjong. Your Father is always busy with work in the office. He is the busiest person in the world.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, please remind Father to take care of himself. Though work is important, he must not neglect his health.\u201dOld Mr. Wen suddenly looked at her and said, \u201cYou too. Though learning is important, you must also not neglect your health.\u201dHe was surprised to see her growth in such a short time. This proved that she must have put in an enormous amount of hard work.Wen Xinya was touched. \u201cGrandpa, I understand. With Grampy\u2019s guidance, my education was made easy. I plan to return to school in September this year.\u201dOld Mr. Wen looked at her in disbelief. \u201cYou plan to complete all the courses of Secondary Three in six months by self-learning?\u201dIt was easy for children from wealthy families to get into reputable schools. They just needed to spend a little more money. But for Xinya it was a different case. She had been leading a wandering life for many years, so she had never been to a proper school and never gone through Secondary education. It was no longer a question of how much money to spend to let her get into a good school. Since she had just returned to the Wen Family, she was now the focus of everyone\u2019s attention. It wasn\u2019t that bad if she wasn\u2019t educated. However, if she went back to school knowing nothing at all, it would impact badly the Wen Family\u2019s reputation.Grandpa\u2019s initial plan was to let her return to school in the following year. So he would have ample time to engage a tuition teacher for her. Though she would be one year later than her peers in class, it wouldn\u2019t hurt the Wen Family\u2019s reputation.Wen Xinya nodded confidently. \u201cMmm! With Grampy\u2019s guidance, I am confident to complete the courses for Secondary Three on my own.\u201dOld Mr. Wen didn\u2019t believe it at first. But he had seen the great change in his granddaughter in just these few weeks. Moreover, with a literary master like Old Master Mo to guide her, he started to have faith in her. \u201cSounds like a good plan. You have Grandpa\u2019s support.\u201d\u201cThank you, Grandpa.\u201d Wen Xinya thanked him happily.Before he saw Xinya, Old Mr. Wen was worried about the banquet event three months later, but it seemed like his worry was unnecessary. He thought for a while and said, \u201cXinya, you have been staying at Grampy\u2019s place for a period of time. Why don\u2019t you go home with me today?\u201dWen Xinya lowered her head. After some consideration, she looked up and said with sincerity in her eyes, \u201cI would like to stay here until the banquet event three months later. I will return to the Wen Family with a good name. Only then no one would have any further excuse to throw me out of the Wen Family again.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere were such clarity and determination in her eyes that could pierce through souls. Old Mr. Wen felt sorry for her, feeling a strong sense of guilt within. She probably could sense it too. It was all within his control and jurisdiction to protect her against all the harm she was going through. However, he chose not to do anything in order to not bring a bad name to the Wen Family. In other words, he chose to protect the Wen Family\u2019s reputation over her interests.\u201cXinya\u2026\u201d Old Mr. Wen was speechless for a while.\u201cGrandpa, I have already made up my mind. Please do not try to dissuade me.\u201d Wen Xinya affirmed her decision. She said this with the intention to make Grandpa feel even more guilty towards her so that she could fight for more beneficial gains for herself.Whether it was unscrupulous or a method to her madness, she was determined to achieve her goals. There were a lot of things she didn\u2019t understand in her previous life. Since her rebirth, she seemed to be more aware of how to plan to achieve her objectives.

Once she stepped out of the Mo bungalow, an Italian handmade customized RexS9Lucifer car came over and stopped right beside her.The warm rays from the morning sun shone through the leaves and glittered on the black car. It was as if the dotted rays were dancing on the car\u2019s surface.It wasn\u2019t just simply black. There was a hidden power within the black. It was able to absorb all the light and heat without any reflection. That was the mysterious energy in the black color.The window of the car wound down slowly. It was Si Yiyan on the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cLet me send you to Old Du\u2019s place,\u201d he said.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to trouble you. I can take a taxi there.\u201d She was shocked to realize that the driver was Si Yiyan. Lucifer means Star from the Dawn in Latin (A rising star in dawn). That meant it represented the next brightest spacial body in the universe at dawn apart from the Moon\u2014Venus. It represented the Messenger of Light! The highest authority amongst heaven\u2019s angels.But\u2026 Lucifer had another meaning. The fallen angel Lucifer who became the Devil\u2014Satan. He was the King of Darkness.She could expect\u2026 what kind of identity suited the owner of such a car.\u201cThis is a private residential area. There are no taxis around. If you want to catch one you have to walk about 15 minutes to the main road.\u201d Si Yiyan noticed that she was wearing a light blue casual blouse, making her look youthful, and she was obviously prepared to walk the distance to hail a cab.\u201cPlease go ahead if you are busy. Walking is a good exercise for me.\u201d Wen Xinya tried to reject him in a nice way. He was wearing a black shirt. It made him looked mysterious and dangerous.Black is an extreme and mysterious color. It sends a hidden message of unspeakable power behind it, representing the fear and sadness of death. It signifies a spirit of unlimited imagination and is the King in the world of colors.It represented power and strength too. It can be serious yet elegant, mysterious yet passionate. It can also be a dull and heavy color, implying death and disaster is near.Si Yiyan opened the door and got down elegantly. He walked to the other side of the car and opened the door for her. \u201cI have nothing important at the moment. Get in the car!\u201dShe was trying to avoid direct eye contact with him and reject him nicely with her words. It displayed her calmness and intelligence. But\u2026 how would he allow her to reject him?Under his persistent, she ran out of excuses and finally boarded his car. She behaved coldly towards him and said in a reluctant tone, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you have any ulterior motive for staying at Grampy\u2019s place. If you dare harm Grampy, I will not let you off even if it costs my life.\u201dSi Yiyan put his hand on the steering wheel and started the engine. He looked at her expressionlessly. \u201cWhy do you not think that I have an ulterior motive for you?\u201d\u201cHow is that possible?\u201d Wen Xinya immediately rejected the idea semi-consciously. She was just a 15-year-old teenager who had previously led a wandering life. While Grampy was an influential figure in the literary world. This was a powerful position and status anyone would want to make use of.\u201cHow is that not possible?\u201d Si Yiyan had a smile on his face. He tilted his head slightly towards her and looked at her with a glitter in his eyes.Wen Xinya was at a loss and panicked. She turned and looked at the other side to avoid eye-contact with him. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s valuable about me is my identity as the granddaughter from the Wen Family. You have a unique identity, and might not find any worth in my connection to the Wen Family,\u201d she said.\u201cThe Wen Family, I do not care about them. It\u2019s you that I care about.\u201d Si Yiyan turned the steering wheel with force and the car changed direction abruptly. It came to a green path.Screech\u2026The sound of the car wheels braking was deafening. Then the car came to a halt.Everything happened suddenly. Wen Xinya was pushed forward from her seat by the force of car\u2019s turning. Si Yiyan used the side of his body to secure Wen Xinya back in her seat. Now his body was half leaning on her, with one hand on her shoulder and the other holding her hand tightly. They were in close physical and eye contact.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wen Xinya turned pale and was trying to recover from her shock. One of her hands was pressing against Si Yiyan\u2019s chest. She was still thinking hard about what he said earlier. What did it mean when he said it was her that he cared about?The red lines in Si Yiyan\u2019s eyes slowly appeared. His eyes were cold and enchanting. However, there was passion and warmth hidden within. When he looked at her, his passion seemed to be guiding her soul and inviting her for a dance.When he looked at you in such close proximity, it seemed like you are the only focus in his world. Wen Xinya almost couldn\u2019t catch her breath and did not know how to react. At this moment, she panicked and all she wanted was to escape. \u201cI\u2026 I want to leave now.\u201dWith one hand on her shoulder, he pushed her down with his strength and pressed her against the seat with his body, so there was nowhere for her to escape. He then moved closer and kissed her suddenly.Wen Xinya opened her eyes wide. She was so shocked by his actions that she did not know how to react.Si Yiyan\u2019s lips were tightly sealed against hers. He remained motionless as if affixing a seal on her. It was a very bright and clear seal.Wen Xinya slowly recovered from her trance. She could feel his body weight pressing on her. She was feeling suffocated. There was a sharp pain in her chest and her bones were stiff. She was like a stone that was thrown into the ocean, unable to control her movements at all. She summoned all her remaining strength to the hand that was pushing against his chest, struggling to get out of that situation and break the physical contact between their lips.Si Yiyan seemed to be satisfied after successfully affixing a seal on her. He finally let go of her and said, \u201cNow do you finally believe that I have an ulterior motive in you?\u201dWen Xinya blushed and her heart rate increased\u2014Lub-dub, lub-dub. Her emotions were at their peak. The moment she regained freedom, she gave Si Yiyan a slap as a reflex action.Si Yiyan did not dodge. \u201cI have affixed a seal on your lips, and you left a mark on my face. From now on, we belong to each other,\u201d he said.Si Yiyan\u2019s words angered Wen Xinya but made her embarrassed at the same time. \u201cYou are a beast! I am an underaged teenager. I\u2019m only 15-year-old this year, how could you\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSi Yiyan started the car without hurry. \u201cAffixing a seal to declare what belongs to me. I will wait for you to grow up!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wen Xinya suddenly banged the door and shouted, \u201cStop the car! I want to leave now!\u201dSi Yiyan smiled as he stopped the car slowly by the roadside. \u201cHere you are. I\u2019ll drop you here and you can go up by yourself.\u201dWen Xinya panickedly opened the door and got down immediately. Si Yiyan added, \u201cI will pick you up at 5 o\u2019clock.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wen Xinya noted the car license plate number: RexS99999. This special license number was rarely seen in the city. Rex was the English name Rex when translated to Mandarin, it meant king, ruler, or emperor. The five nines that preceded meant Nine-Five. In ancient Country Z, Nine-Five was usually meant to refer to a king or a ruler!Who is he exactly, that he could unscrupulously use the English word Rex and even dared to arrogantly use five nines for his car plate number?He looked as though he had gracefully walked into her life, but in reality, he had aggressively and overbearingly barged into her life.His identity was shrouded in a heavy black fog, blurring her vision and confusing her. Her gut feeling was telling her that he was dangerous and that she should not be near him and maintain a good distance from him.She thought of her past life when she loved a man so deeply. She gave him her everything but all she ever received from him was a heartbreaking betrayal. It was at that time that she gave up on herself.Having a second chance at life, she never thought of accepting a man, to let him barge into her life. However, Si Yiyan was different. He never sought her permission before aggressively conquering her life. It was as though her rejection, faced with such intense aggression, was turned into a weak attempt.Wen Xinya shook off her own confusing thoughts, refusing to think about the annoying problems of love and feelings! In this life, she was not going to let love chain her down again. There were many, many things that she had to do.Wen Xinya remembered the first time she came to Grandpa Du\u2019s medical house and was shocked that it was actually an isolated mansion located at the mountainside of Mt. Ling.\u201cYou thought that a \u2018medical house\u2019 was an actual thatched cottage, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Uncle Zhang said with a laughter, trying to tease her.Wen Xinya was tongue-tied. Looking at her confused expression, Uncle Zhang burst out laughing. He even told Grampy when he returned to the Mo Family. And then Grampy told Grandpa Du about it. On the same day, Grandpa Du deliberately called to tease her, \u201cIf you like a thatched cottage, I\u2019ll have one built right beside my mansion someday.\u201d\u201cMiss Xinya, you\u2019re here. Please come in!\u201d The servants from the Du Family liked to call her by her first name. She was aware that Grandpa Du did not like what the Wen Family had done to her. They had forced her to stay at the Mo Mansion. That was why he instructed the servants to greet her by her first name only.\u201cMother Hao, I\u2019ll help myself. Please carry on with your work!\u201d Wen Xinya felt at home and was comfortable at the Du Family. She did not feel like a stranger at all.\u201cMother Hao, do we have a visitor?\u201d Suddenly, from the living room came a sweet, warm voice, as if it was coated with honey.Mother Hao hurriedly replied, \u201cOh, it\u2019s Miss Xinya.\u201dWen Xinya raised her head and saw a young girl with curly and messy black hair. She was in white pajamas, and on it was printed pictures of cute bears. She came down from the second story in a pair of cotton bunny-eared slippers. This girl was Grandpa Du\u2019s granddaughter, Du Ruo.Grandpa Du\u2019s son, Uncle Du Zhong, favored western medicinal practice and did not follow Grandpa Du\u2019s path of career. And because of his busy work schedule, Uncle Du had a divorce when Du Ruo was 5-year-old. Du Ruo was brought up by Grandpa Du. She was influenced by him and had a great interest in Chinese traditional medicinal practice. That made Grandpa Du extremely happy. However, when Du Ruo grew up, she diversified into the faculty of Chinese health and nutritional practice. Grandpa Du was not happy with her decision but could not do anything about it. Every time when he spoke about Du Ruo, he had a sense of regret.\u201cXinya, you\u2019re early today!\u201d Du Ruo walked towards her with a happy mood. Her eyes were still half-closed as if they were covered with mist, probably because she had just awakened.\u201cNope. It isn\u2019t that I came early, it\u2019s you who have woken up late today. The sun is already high up in the sky.\u201d Wen Xinya could not help but pinch her beautiful cute little cheek.Du Ruo yawned. \u201cA few days ago, Grandpa had a patient. He brought a book about anti-aging secrets of the ancient maids from the palace, and also another book about health maintenance secrets. I have begged Grandpa for a very long time before he agreed to lend me the books. I was busy studying them, that\u2019s why I had to stay up late,\u201d she said.Wen Xinya was well aware that if Du Ruo was learning a new recipe, she would study and work hard till she neglected her meals and sleep.Du Ruo forced herself awake. \u201cOh yes, Grandpa has gone out early in the morning to see a patient today. Please go to his study room later. He has prepared the materials for your learning today.\u201d\u201cOkay, I know!\u201d Wen Xinya nodded. After a few visits to the Du Family, Grandpa Du had not spent time teaching her personally. He only asked her to read a few medical books by herself. After reading, she would look at the medicine glossary written by Grandpa Du to learn about the different Chinese herbs and medicines. She had a fantastic memory and had already managed to memorize more than half of the information.Du Ruo jumped into Xinya\u2019s arms and wrapped her arms around her neck. She then said playfully, \u201cXinya, my dear Xinya. Did you bring me some of the rose cakes made by Mother He? I have been waiting for it the entire week.\u201d\u201cLittle greedy cat.\u201d Wen Xinya pinched her nose and smiled. \u201cQuick, let go of me. I\u2019m suffocating.\u201dDu Ruo let go of her, but then grabbed her arm and shook it. \u201cMy dear Xinya, I\u2019ve called you yesterday to remind you to bring some for me. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve forgotten about it?\u201dDu Ruo had a beautiful and sweet face. No one could stand it whenever she spoke in a playful tone. Wen Xinya pulled out an exquisite foldable lunch box from her bag and passed it to her. \u201cSee? The princess\u2019 wish is my command.\u201d\u201cAh! Xinya, I knew you were the best.\u201d Du Ruo received the lunch box happily and opened it immediately. Inside the box were some gorgeous lovely pieces of cake with beautiful rose decorations on top of them. They looked delicious.Wen Xinya watched her eat the pieces of cake happily. She asked, \u201cRuo Ruo, do you have any recipe that helps maintain cardiovascular and overall health?\u201dIn her previous life, Grampy died from a severe heart attack. In this lifetime, she had intended to learn more about Chinese traditional medicine knowledge from Grandpa Du so that she could help Grampy improve his overall health.\u201cI don\u2019t have any specific knowledge on that topic. However, I might have kept some ancient recipe that can help you. Let me go find it shortly. Oh yes, who are these recipes for?\u201d Du Ruo replied while enjoying the piece of rose cake on her hand at the same time.\u201cGrampy has poor cardiovascular health. I wish to help him improve his condition.\u201d Wen Xinya said in a serious tone. In her previous life, she learned that Grampy had died from a heart attack that was caused by blocked arteries.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDu Ruo suggested with sincerity. \u201cGrandpa Mo is in good health. He doesn\u2019t need to fix any heart problems. I have a few recipes here for making Chinese medicinal cuisines that I have studied them. These recipes bring good results. Grandpa Mo is old in age and indeed needs to improve his overall health. By consuming Chinese medicinal cuisines, it\u2019ll be easier for him to absorb all the required nutrients.\u201dDu Ruo was more knowledgeable than her in terms of health maintenance, therefore she gracefully accepted her suggestion. \u201cWell, thank you very much,\u201d Wen Xinya appreciated her help.Du Ruo waved her hand and answered, \u201cDon\u2019t need to thank me. It doesn\u2019t require much effort on my part. Moreover, Grandpa Mo had always been good to me and treated me like his granddaughter. I should also show some filial piety to him.\u201dGrandpa Du and Grandpa Mo were close friends, thus Du Ruo visited the Mo Family frequently. Though Grandpa Mo had a cold temperament by nature, he treated her very well. When she knew Grandpa Mo found his own granddaughter, she was very happy for him to finally have a family companion.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Du Ruo felt weird about her leaving 30 minutes earlier. Usually, Wen Xinya would stay till 5 o\u2019clock in the afternoon.Du Ruo casually asked if everything was alright, but did not ask further when Wen Xinya replied and assured her that there wasn\u2019t any problem.The real reason for Wen Xinya leaving the Du Mansion earlier was because of Si Yiyan. He told her that morning he would come to fetch her. In her previous life, she was deeply hurt by that man. But in this life, she did not wish to be embroiled in sexual relations with him. However, she could not bring herself to reject Si Yiyan and knew that he was someone who would not take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. Therefore, avoiding him was the only thing she could do for now.Wen Xinya left the Du Mansion and walked along the little stone path leading to the main road. She saw a black car\u2014The Lucifer\u2014stopped by the roadside. Si Yiyan was standing beside the car, leaning on the door. His vision was locked on her as if he could see through her soul.Wen Xinya frowned. She felt uncomfortable with him staring at her. It made her feel she had nowhere to hide. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you would pick me up at 5 o\u2019clock? Why are you so early?\u201dSi Yiyan had guessed her intention of avoiding him. He came earlier on purpose so that he would not miss her. \u201cI have nothing on, so I came early. I didn\u2019t expect your class to end before 5 o\u2019clock. I was lucky to arrive before you left.\u201dWen Xinya felt a sense of guilt. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you would send me back? Let\u2019s get moving! Ruo Ruo gave me a few recipes for medicinal cuisines that are good for Grampy. I need to return earlier to prepare and cook them for him.\u201dShe used cooking for Grampy as an excuse to leave early. Her eagerness to explain made it even more obvious to him that she was trying to avoid him.Si Yiyan smiled and replied, \u201cEven if you leave at 5 o\u2019clock, it won\u2019t make any difference. You don\u2019t need to be impatient. There\u2019s a lot of time.\u201dWen Xinya was embarrassed for her intentions being exposed. \u201cAre you going to drive? Otherwise, I will just hail a taxi,\u201d she said angrily while walking to the other side of the car and opening the door.\u201cYou are behaving like a furious cute little wildcat.\u201d Si Yiyan looked at her and said in a flirtatious tone. He then started the engine.As soon as the car reached the Mo\u2019s bungalow, Wen Xinya got out of the car panickedly and dashed into the house. She bumped into Mother He.\u201cAi yo! My Young Mistress, why are you in such a hurry?\u201d Mother He held her carefully while trying to balance herself. She was shocked by Missus Wen\u2019s recklessness.Wen Xinya was extremely apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for bumping into you, Mother He.\u201d\u201cWhat happened, my dear? You were in such a rush as if you were on fire! Luckily you bumped into me and not somewhere else. Otherwise, it would be disastrous!\u201d Mother He said.\u201cI got a few recipes for medicinal cuisines from Ruo Ruo. I was in a rush to prepare the ingredients so that I can cook for Grampy,\u201d replied Wen Xinya with a slight sense of guilt.Si Yiyan walked into the house calmly. He was holding a bag in his hand. \u201cYou are in a rush to make medicine for Grampy, but you\u2019ve left the raw medicinal ingredients you took from Old Du\u2019s place in my car.\u201dWen Xinya was furious that her excuses were being exposed.Mother He looked at her from head to toe. She had never seen the rational Young Mistress behaving like this. She was shocked to see her so angry. \u201cYoung Mistress, why is your face red?\u201dSi Yiyan peeped at Wen Xinya from the corner of his eye.Wen Xinya gave a fierce stare at Mother He and stamped her feet. \u201cMother He, you are irritating!\u201d She turned around and left immediately.Mother He did not understand what had happened. She was still confused and looked at Si Yiyan. \u201cYoung Master Si, what happened to Young Mistress? Her face was red. Is she unwell?\u201dSi Yiyan replied with a smile, \u201cNothing, she was just being shy.\u201dShy? Why was Young Mistress shy? Mother He saw a flirtatious smile on Si Yiyan\u2019s face and suddenly realized what had happened. She bursted into laughter and said, \u201cYes, Young Mistress was just being shy.\u201dWen Xinya came into the kitchen. She finally calmed down and sighed over her childish behavior earlier. She irked at the thought of the unforgettable love from her previous life. It was not how deep she loved that made it unforgettable, but how it was not worth her love.Mother Jiang walked into the kitchen and saw Young Mistress standing there in a daze. Mother Jiang thought she did not have any culinary skills. \u201cYoung Mistress, I have prepared and cleaned the raw cooking ingredients as you\u2019ve requested. Are you sure you want to do it yourself? Do you need my help?\u201dWen Xinya took a deep breath and quickly recovered from her thoughts. \u201cThank you for your offer, Mother Jiang. I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dAfter leading a wandering life for 15 years, how could she not acquire any culinary skills? Moreover, after knowing him, she took up exquisite cuisine courses in order to please him. Her culinary skills were comparable to a chef from any five-star restaurant.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll be right here, Young Mistress. Please let me know if you need any help,\u201d said Mother Jiang while looking at her delicate hands. It did not seem she was someone who worked in the kitchen a lot. Mother Jiang stayed in the kitchen, suspicious. In case Young Mistress hurt herself or needed any help, she would be there for her.From heating the oil, adding ingredients, frying and brewing a pot of soup, Young Mistress was able to perform all these tasks with ease. Mother Jiang was surprised to see that. Then she remembered Young Mistress had led a wandering life for 15 years and must have gone through many sufferings. She felt sorry for her.Wen Xinya made a dish of white eel cooked with ginseng and wolfberries. It could help in detoxification and strengthening of the heart and was very suitable for Grampy\u2019s condition. This was quite different from what was found on the internet.It was dinner time at 6 o\u2019clock. Old Master Mo could detect a smell of strong Chinese medicine from the dish of white eel on the dinner table. He raised his eyebrow, asking, \u201cIs this a medicinal cuisine?\u201dMother Jiang replied, \u201cYes! This is white-eel, cooked with ginseng and wolfberries. It can help to detoxify and strengthen one\u2019s heart. Young Mistress got the recipe from Missus Ruo Ruo and specially cooked this dish for you.

That\u2019s very nice of you to cook for Grampy.\u201dMother He laughed and said, \u201cNowadays there isn\u2019t many girls who can cook.

I shall be in charge of arranging your diet from now on. You must take note and start having a healthy diet to strengthen your health,\u201d she said.Old Master Mo was happy to have such a filial granddaughter. Naturally, he would agree to listen to her. \u201cYes, ok! You\u2019ll be in charge.\u201dSi Yiyan bowed his head while secretly peeping at her. She was busy filling Grampy\u2019s bowl with food.

She was now learning at a professional and practical level, as compared to the basic entry level she started with some time ago.After dinner, she was reading a book titled \u201cEssays from the Pool of Dreams.\u201d There were 17 main categories in the pool of dreams, including geographic, history, chess and music, business, personal development, and more. This was one of her favorite books.Her phone started ringing. Wen Xinya took a look and saw that it was a call from Xu Zhenyu. She answered without hesitation. \u201cHello, Second Young Master Xu. Are you looking for me?\u201dThere was total silence on the other end of the line. Wen Xinya\u2019s heart sank. She was worried if something had happened. \u201cSecond Young Master Xu, please say something!\u201d\u201cWen Xinya, today\u2026\u201d Xu Zhenyu stammered.Wen Xinya heaved a sigh of relief after hearing his voice. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about? If you have something to tell me, say it! Don\u2019t stammer like a little young lady,\u201d she said furiously.Xu Zhenyu was initially hesitant to make this call. When he heard Wen Xinya calling him names, he was suddenly filled with courage. \u201cWho is behaving like a little young lady? I am a real man! A real man!\u201dWen Xinya was tickled by his tone of voice as he tried to act manly. \u201cYou are too short to be a real man. Any real man who is as small-sized as you wouldn\u2019t want to call himself a real man.\u201dXu Zhenyu could not stand being ridiculed by her. He unconsciously looked downwards at his chest that had no muscles. \u201cThough I don\u2019t have six-pack abdominal muscles, I have something in between my legs which you don\u2019t. That makes me a real man.\u201dWen Xinya shouted into the phone angrily, \u201cXu Zhenyu, you bastard! Stop trying to be a gangster!\u201dXu Zhenyu was shocked by her screaming. There was adu, du, dutone from the phone. She had hung up on him. He suddenly realized he did not have the chance to tell her about the reason he was calling, and immediately dialed her again.After a few rings, the line was cut off again. He did not give up. Even after a long ring, still, no one answered the call. He continued trying\u2026After five consecutive tries, his call was finally answered. Wen Xinya told him angrily, \u201cXu-er, you better be calling me for something important.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d Xu Zhenyu asked in a stammering voice.Wen Xinya got furious again at his question. \u201cXu-er, do you think everyone is as free as you? Why don\u2019t you spend more time studying instead of only caring about having fun all day? Whenever you get into trouble, your family will stand up for you. Or when you run out of pocket-money, all you need to do is to ask them for more. I am not as free as you and I do not have time to play with you.\u201d Obviously, Xu Zhenyu got distracted again from his intention of the call by her shouting.\u201cI wanted to tell you, today\u2019s my birthday. I have booked a VIP room in the Ninth-Heaven with my friends for a gathering. Since you are not free, then forget about it.\u201d Xu Zhenyu hung up.He was enraged by Wen Xinya\u2019s words. He got so angry that he slammed the phone on the ground and punched hard into the wall of the washroom. He thought he must be mad to be calling Wen Xinya.In her eyes, he was a wastrel from a wealthy family. He only cared about having fun and would not do anything seriously.\u201cXu-er, you have been inside the washroom for almost half an hour. Are you alright? Everyone is waiting for the birthday boy.\u201d As Han Mofeng opened the door of the washroom he saw Second Young Master Xu leaning against the wall. He wondered what he was thinking about.\u201cOh, nothing! I\u2019ll go over now.\u201d Xu Zhenyu bent down to pick up his cell phone. He pressed a button to see if it was still working. Fortunately, the phone was built strong enough to withstand the fall. Otherwise, he would have to buy a new cell phone.Han Mofeng looked as he stared at his cell phone and blinked his eyes, then threw his cell phone on the floor again to vent his anger. Who was he angry at this time? \u201cWhat happened to your cell phone?\u201dXu Zhenyu put the cell phone into his pocket with composure. \u201cNothing, I dropped it accidentally.\u201dHan Mofeng did not believe him. Xu Zhenyu seemed to have changed into a different person ever since he met him at the airport that day. He seldom hung out with his gang of wastrel friends anymore. The Xu Family was so happy that they prayed and made offerings to their ancestors every day.Han Mofeng thought he must have been in love with some girl whom he had never met before. But after observing for some time, he had never seen Xu Zhenyu behaving intimately with another girl, nor did he try to get close to any other girls.Both of them returned to the VIP room. Everyone in the room was chatting.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what kind of person that Young Missus Wen from the Wen Family is. It\u2019s a pity for Xia Ruya. I have seen her previously around here. She is an elegant and pretty lady. More importantly, she is a kind-hearted person.\u201d\u201cI heard that Young Missus Wen used to be a street gangster. She did not even complete her Secondary School studies. When she returned to the Wen Family, she continued behaving in an unrefined manner and is a complete shrew. She speaks with profanity and is always getting into fights. The Wen Family had intended to send her abroad to prevent her from being a disgrace to the family. However, Old Mr. Wen wasn\u2019t agreeable, so she ended up staying at her Grampy\u2019s place.\u201d\u201cI think the Wen Family wouldn\u2019t want to acknowledge such a disgrace as their granddaughter. It\u2019s been two months already and they have yet to make any announcements to the public.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s for sure. It\u2019s just a case of a wild sparrow lucky enough to get into the Phoenix\u2019s nest. She will never become a Phoenix herself\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did you say? Repeat what you said if you dare.\u201d Xu Zhenyu dashed into the VIP room and grabbed the young lady who was talking earlier. He gave her a hard punch on the face.\u201cXu-er, what are you doing? What did she do to offend you and why are you beating people up?\u201d Han Mofeng immediately went up and tried to stop the fight.These words \u201cwild sparrow\u201d conquered Xu Zhenyu\u2019s mind. He could not think rationally. He gave the young lady another hard kick. \u201cIf Wen Xinya is a wild sparrow, what are you? You are not even worthy to be her sidekick.\u201dHan Mofeng finally understood that Wen Xinya was the reason for Xu-er being so angry. She was the Young Missus Wen who had just returned to the Wen Family. Weird\u2026 When did Xu-er meet Wen Xinya? Was Wen Xinya the girl Xu-er had been secretly in love with?Everyone else also tried to mitigate the situation. \u201cXu-er, Ruoyin was not aware that Young Missus Wen is your friend. She was just blabbering some nonsense. Please do not take it to heart. Today is your birthday and you should be happy. Let\u2019s not spoil the day over some trivial matters.\u201dXu Zhenyu was a stubborn man. Though he was being held back, he raised his leg and gave another kick. \u201cGet lost, you witch! Stop spouting nonsense here!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJiang Ruoyin was brought up as a pampered young mistress. She had never been beaten nor humiliated. She covered her face in tears and ran out of the VIP room.The ambiance in the VIP room became quieter after her departure.Xu Zhenyu was still unhappy over what happened. It wasn\u2019t the first time he heard someone bad-mouthing about Wen Xinya. He finally understood why she was always working hard to prove herself and preventing others from looking down on her. Now\u2026 he felt fortunate for having a happy and supportive family. And she, who was less fortunate, had to put in a lot more hard work to prove herself and fight for her own happiness.At this thought, Xu Zhenyu was no longer angry over Wen Xinya\u2019s words from their conversation earlier.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was May 15. Indeed, it was Xu Zhenyu\u2019s birthday.She quickly changed into a green enchanting dress that had pictures of white intertwined branches. She looked youthful and elegant in this dress.She randomly grabbed a pearl accessory and her sling bag. She was ready to go out.\u201cIt\u2019s late and you are still going out?\u201d Old Master Mo was concerned. He was sitting on the sofa in the living watching television. He saw that she was all dressed up and even brought her sling bag along.Wen Xinya nodded. \u201cMmm, today is my friend\u2019s birthday. He has a gathering at the Ninth-Heaven and invited me along.\u201dOld Master Mo trusted her and was not worried that she would visit some sleazy places late at night. \u201cLet me ask Uncle Zhang to send you there.\u201d\u201cThank you, Grampy!\u201d It was comfortable living at Grampy\u2019s place. The only problem was accessibility. Now that she was still underage, she could not apply for a driving license yet. Though she could take someone else\u2019s driving license to drive, she was aware of her unique identity. And since she had just returned to the Wen Family, everyone was watching her closely. She was in the spotlight of the media\u2019s attention, the slightest mistake would easily be blown up by the media.Ninth-Heaven was a Club for the upper-class society. The Club would not allow anyone without any status to enter. There were even different gradings of statuses! Ninth-Heaven represented nine grades! There were affluent figures from the business world, political officers, and some of the low profile wealthiest men in the city.Uncle Zhang sent Wen Xinya to the Ninth-Heaven. It was a Club for members only. Anyone without a member\u2019s card would not be allowed to enter unless he was accompanied by a member and entered as a guest.Wen Xinya gave Xu Zhenyu a call and it was answered very quickly. \u201cI am at the entrance of Ninth-Heaven and I cannot enter without a member\u2019s card. Come and fetch me,\u201d said Wen Xinya.Xu Zhenyu was taken aback, and it took him a few seconds to react. \u201cWait there, I am coming out to get you.\u201d Then, he dashed out of the VIP room at the speed of the wind.Everyone in the VIP room was confused at Xu Zhenyu\u2019s inconsistent behavior. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Xu-er today? A while ago he was sitting at a corner drinking alcohol all by himself. It didn\u2019t look like his birthday at all. And now he disappeared again like a gust of wind.\u201dMo Hanfeng made a guess. \u201cI think one of his friends has arrived!\u201dWithin moments from the conversation, Second Young Master Xu was leading an elegant and youthful young lady into the VIP room. The girl was wearing the latest dress from this season owned by Jo-ramst shop that belonged to the Wen Corporation. The dress was beautiful and enchanting. From the collar down there were pictures of white intertwined branches with blossomed flowers that extended all the way down.Second Young Master Xu looked happy. He held Wen Xinya\u2019s hand and introduced her. \u201cThis is my friend, Wen Xinya.\u201dEveryone in the room froze in shock after this introduction. Just a short while ago, Xu Zhenyu had just beaten another girl because of Wen Xinya. Now Wen Xinya unexpectedly appeared in front of them.What turned out to be even more shocking to them was that Wen Xinya actually looked very different from the rumors they heard previously. She did not look like someone who behaved in an unrefined manner and definitely did not look like a shrew!Wen Xinya smiled and greeted. \u201cHello, everyone!\u201dHan Mofeng remained calm. He introduced himself. \u201cI am Han Mofeng, a good friend of Xu-er.\u201dThe Han Family and the Xu Family had close relationships. Old Master Han and Old Master Xu used to work in the same political committee. In her previous life, Han Mofeng detested Wen Xinya because of her relationship with Xu Zhenyu. He even had numerous arguments with her. Because of Wen Xinya, the relationship between Xu Zhenyu and Han Mofeng turned sour. When Xu Zhenyu went to jail, Han Mofeng paid a last visit to Wen Xinya and gave her a slap on the face. She had never seen him after that.\u201cNice to meet you!\u201d Wen Xinya greeted him. She did not hate Han Mofeng at all. She knew all he did was for Xu Zhenyu\u2019s good. Even when their friendship turned sour, Han Mofeng did not give up on him. In fact, Wen Xinya admired Han Mofeng for being a loyal friend.After Han Mofeng started rolling the ball, everyone else introduced themselves as well.Wen Xinya soon remembered everybody in the VIP room and was also aware of some of their backgrounds. A few of them were Xu Zhenyu\u2019s close friends who grew up together with him. Some were Young Masters and Young Mistresses from affluent families. Everybody in the room came from an affluent family.The happy look on Xu Zhenyu\u2019s face was pretty obvious, and everyone could guess that something was going on between them. They started to be friendlier to Wen Xinya.Second Young Master Xu held the microphone and started speaking. \u201cXinya just returned to the Wen Family. Please take care of her and give her your guidance. I, Xu-er, personally thank everyone for that!\u201dEveryone consented.Wen Xinya had a special identity. She did not have an opportunity to interact or associate with the upper-class society in the Capital city. She was thankful to Xu-er for this opportunity.\u201cMay I suggest that we punish the latecomer with three glasses of wine. She was late and made our Second Young Master Xu wait. He had to sit in a corner and drink by himself. Do you agree?\u201d Han Mofeng placed three glasses in a straight line and started pouring red wine into each of the glasses until they were filled to the brim.\u201cHey, Han Mofeng, are you trying to make things difficult for Xinya? This is her first time joining our gathering. Moreover, she\u2019s just a girl. How could you give her such a harsh punishment?\u201d The girl who was sitting beside Wen Xinya stared at Han Mofeng in discontent.The girl who spoke up for Wen Xinya was Zhou Tianyu. During her introduction, Wen Xinya could see that she was a kind-hearted, beautiful and intelligent girl, with a strong sense of righteousness. She had a very good feeling about this girl.The Zhou Family was into politics. However, Zhou Tianyu\u2019s grampy was from a military background. Though not as influential as the Xu Family, Zhou Tianyu\u2019s grampy also held a high-rank in the military force. She lived with her grampy from a very young age, thus she was also very close to Xu Zhenyu as they grew up together. Zhou Tianyu focused on linguistic studies. When Xu Zhenyu went to jail in her previous life, Zhou Tianyu was already a well-known diplomat officer.\u201cThat\u2019s right! Xinya is a girl, how can you give her such a harsh punishment? Do you know how to behave like a gentleman?\u201d Second Young Master Xu kicked Han Mofeng.Han Mofeng laughed. \u201cUnlike Xu-er, I don\u2019t know how to be a gentleman. He knows best. Xu-er, why don\u2019t you be her hero and drink up on her behalf?\u201d\u201cNo way! If Second Young Master Xu drinks on Xinya\u2019s behalf, then it cannot be only three glasses of wine. He should drink at least six glasses of wine to make it a fair deal. Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cYes! Six glasses of wine. And the wine glasses should be filled by Xinya to show her sincerity!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cRed wine is good. White wine would be even better.\u201dEveryone in the VIP room was in discussion. It was a happy ambiance.Wen Xinya was a good drinker. Just a few glasses of red wine would not knock her out easily. But when everyone was talking like that, it made her feel as if there was something going on between her and Xu Zhenyu.\u201cWhy pretend to be a non-drinker? You used to be a street gangster, right? I heard people saying street gangsters get into fights, smoke, and drink as well. How can drinking just a few glasses of wine be a difficult task for you?\u201d When everyone was talking happily, a sharp and irritating voice interrupted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why do you have to get nasty? Xinya wasn\u2019t pretending that she can\u2019t drink at all,\u201d said Zhou Tianyu. She then held Wen Xinya\u2019s hands and continued, \u201cThat\u2019s the way Yuqian usually speaks. Please don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201dWen Xinya appreciated Zhou Tianyu\u2019s gesture to help. She nodded in compliance and did not utter a word.Jiang Yuqian could not take it lying down. She rebuked. \u201cDo you think the way I speak is nasty? I\u2019m just telling the truth. It\u2019s true that she used to be a street gangster, isn\u2019t it?\u201dXu Zhenyu gulped the remaining wine in his glass. \u201cDoes it bother you whether Xinya can or cannot drink? I\u2019m happy to drink on her behalf. What does it matter to you, bitch?\u201d he said furiously.Jiang Yuqian turned pale with anger. She pointed at Wen Xinya and bellowed, \u201cBrother Yu, what do you mean? We\u2019ve known each other for many years. How can you reprimand me over this wild sparrow? You\u2026\u201d\u201cWho did you call a \u2018wild sparrow\u2019?\u201d A cold, piercing voice came through the crowd in the VIP room.Everyone turned to look at Wen Xinya, only to see the dimmed lights casting a shadow on her well-defined face, making it even more distinctive and sharper.A chill ran down Jiang Yuqian\u2019s spine. \u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant. Do you really think you\u2019re the real Missus Wen just because you returned to the Wen Family? They probably don\u2019t want to acknowledge you as part of the family. Otherwise, they would have made an official announcement on this matter.\u201d\u201cAre you speaking on behalf of the Jiang Family? Is that how the Jiang Family taught you to speak?\u201d Wen Xinya stared at her coldly while fiddling with her cell phone with her hand.The atmosphere remained intense. Everyone who was streetwise would know what Wen Xinya meant by her words. It seemed like she was not an easy-going person after all.Jiang Yuqian, who did not understand the meaning behind her words, noticed there was a sudden change in everyone\u2019s expression. She had a bad premonition. \u201cWhat\u2026 What do you mean?\u201d she stuttered.Wen Xinya walked past Zhou Tianyu and leaned towards Jiang Yuqian. She spoke slowly, emphasizing every word. \u201cNothing in particular. But I just wanted to remind you, there are some words that can be said and some are not meant to be spoken. It wouldn\u2019t be nice if your words became known to the public. That would have a negative impact on the Jiang Family\u2019s reputation. Wouldn\u2019t you agree?\u201dAt this moment Jiang Yuqian realized. Old Mr. Wen did spend some effort in finding her, and everyone knew he had acknowledged her as his granddaughter, though the Wen Family did not make any official announcement about Wen Xinya\u2019s return, and that she was currently staying with her Grampy. If Old Mr. Wen got to hear what Jiang Yuqian said, he would not let the matter rest. The Zhang Family would get into the scene. No matter what happened after that, the Zhang Family would then be subjected to the media and public\u2019s criticism for intervening in the Wen Family\u2019s affair. It would not do them any good at all.To ease the tension in the room, Han Mofeng interrupted by saying, \u201cXu-er, you\u2019ve only drunk one glass of wine. Five more to go! Don\u2019t you ever think of backing out!\u201dZhou Tianyu added, \u201cHan Mofeng, you must be mistaken! Xu-er is always ready to drink more on Xinya\u2019s behalf.\u201d After that, she slowly shifted her focus towards Jiang Yuqian.\u201cNo big deal. It\u2019s just a few glasses of wine!\u201d Second Young Master Xu picked up the glasses on the table and gulped the remaining five glasses one after another.\u201cGreat!\u201d Han Mofeng applauded and cheered for him.\u201cSecond Young Master Xu, you have great determination and courage. Come on! You\u2019re the birthday boy, let me give you a toast. Drink up!\u201d Gu Junling, who was sitting beside Xu Zhenyu, held his wine glass to give him a toast.\u201cGuys, stop bullying Xu-er. Though he might be a little of a pushover, do give him some time to eat and drink, and let him catch his breath!\u201d Wen Xinya said with sarcasm. She put a piece of meat into Xu-er\u2019s bowl and then did the same for the rest of them. \u201cDo have some food to go with the drinks. It\u2019s not good to drink alcohol with an empty stomach.\u201d\u201cWho did you call a pushover?\u201d Xu-er asked angrily.Wen Xinya filled his bowl with some fish soup. \u201cYou\u2019re the second in line in your family, aren\u2019t you? Doesn\u2019t that make you a pushover?\u201dSecond Young Master Xu was speechless for a while. Then he hesitantly said, \u201cYes, I may be the number two in my family, but I\u2019m no pushover!\u201dEveryone could see how angry Xu-er was at her words. And yet he did not realize Missus Wen was just kidding him. He was a pushover indeed.At this moment, Jiang Yuqian held her glass of wine towards Wen Xinya. \u201cLet me give you a toast.\u201dWen Xinya ignored her on purpose. She turned over to talk to Zhou Tianyu.Jiang Yuqian was fuming, but she tried to act pitiful which made it feel weird. \u201cI gave you a toast, but you ignored me. You are just being rude!\u201dWen Xinya finally turned over and looked at her. \u201cWho do you think you are? Does it mean that I must accept your toast just because you wanted it? It doesn\u2019t make any sense, does it?\u201dWith her cold voice and mocking expression, Wen Xinya\u2019s words caused Jiang Yuqian to lose control. She could not hold her pitiful look anymore. \u201cYou\u2019re just afraid your past identity of a street gangster would be exposed. That\u2019s why you are pretending that you\u2019re not a drinker.\u201dWen Xinya burst into laughter. How could someone like that be Xu-er\u2019s friend? \u201cIf anyone who knows how to drink is a street gangster, are you a street gangster too because you can drink?\u201dJiang Yuqian\u2019s hand holding the glass trembled. \u201cYou\u2026\u201dWen Xinya continued with a cold tone, \u201cYou are indeed right that I used to be a street gangster. So\u2026\u201d Her tone became vicious. \u201cYou\u2019d better not provoke me. Otherwise, I might accidentally exhibit some gangster acts on you. That wouldn\u2019t be nice.\u201dJiang Yuqian was exasperated. But with Wen Xinya\u2019s vicious look, she dared not continue challenging her with words.Unable to withstand all the criticisms, Jiang Yuqian stormed out of the VIP room in tears.\u201cShe\u2019s finally gone. We can enjoy ourselves now.\u201d Zhou Tianyu remarked.Xu Zhenyu muttered. \u201cShe\u2019s just being crazy. Xinya did not offend her and yet she\u2019s always picking on Xinya.\u201dThe men in the room started drinking again.Zhou Tianyu leaned towards Wen Xinya and asked, \u201cDo you know the Zhang Family?\u201d\u201cThe Zhang Family?\u201d Wen Xinya shook her head.\u201cThe Zhang Family was also a military family, but they have undergone some changes in recent years. Jiang Yuqian\u2019s father, Jiang Wenzhe, married into the Zhang Family and leveraged the family\u2019s military background to build his career. She is Jiang Wenzhe\u2019s illegitimate daughter and was brought into the Zhang Family when she was 10-years-old. It has already been five years. Though Jiang Wenzhe loves his daughter, the Zhang Family disapproves her. She behaves arrogantly because of Jiang Wenzhe\u2019s backing.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya sighed. \u201cIndeed, those who are brought up in a sheltered environment behave differently.\u201dWen Xinya then realized that she had said that Jiang Yuqian was from the Jiang Family. It was embarrassing. Jiang Yuqian was rightfully from the Zhang Family.Zhou Tianyu burst out laughing. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Jiang Yuqian is a spoiled brat. She thinks that the entire world must listen to her. In fact, Jiang Yuqian and Xu-er had a relationship.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes opened wide. She could not believe Xu-er had a relationship with her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 - Xu-Er, Are You Courting Death?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45: Xu-Er, Are You Courting Death?!Atlas StudiosZhou Tianyu was amused by Wen Xinya\u2019s reaction. \u201cWhen Jiang Yuqian was sent to the Zhang Family, no one from the Zhang Family liked her and those kids from the tenement who were about the same age as her despised her illegitimate identity and used to bully her. And Xu-er, as we all knew him for being reckless, stood up for her one day. He attacked Jiang Yuqian\u2019s bully until he couldn\u2019t get up from the ground. From then on, no one dared to bully her ever again. As for Jiang Yuqian, she always thought she was a princess. So she identified Xu-er as her prince sent from heaven to rescue her. She started being hostile to any girl who spoke with him after that.\u201d she explained.\u201cIs that why she was hostile towards me? Because she was jealous of me?\u201d Wen Xinya stammered.Zhou Tianyu felt Wen Xinya was a very interesting girl. She liked her. \u201cYes, you can say so.\u201d Zhou Tianyu replied.\u201cShe\u2019s only a young girl! Kids nowadays behave far more mature than their age.\u201d Wen Xinya sighed. She took a quick glance at Xu-er, who was happily drinking with his friends. He had his hair dyed black. Under the dim lights, she could almost see a halo glowing on top of his head. He had a pair of almond-shaped eyes that looked enchanting. His face was red from the effect of the alcohol and he appeared to be quite a youthful and attractive young man. No wonder he could easily attract admirations from young girls.Zhou Tianyu poked her waist jokingly, \u201cDon\u2019t make it sound as if you are so old.\u201dWen Xinya gave her a serious look and said, \u201cMy body is physically 15-year-old, but I have a 25-year-old soul.\u201dOf course, Zhou Tianyu did not believe what she said. She gave Wen Xinya a slight push. \u201cQuit messing with me. You might want to say something more convincing than to kid me like that.\u201dWen Xinya shook her head. \u201cSigh! Life is all about loneliness. Nobody believes me even though I\u2019m speaking the truth.\u201dZhou Tianyu burst into laughter. \u201cGo away! Loneliness? How old are you to talk about loneliness? You are just kidding me, aren\u2019t you?\u201dWen Xinya burst into laughter too. In her previous life, she used to react freely as she wished according to her emotions. Since her rebirth, she had returned with a deep hatred. She learned how to control and hide her true feelings. Zhou Tianyu had an easy-going character and Wen Xinya felt close to her as if they had known each other for a long time.Both of them chatted happily. It seemed like they were gossiping about the recent news in society. However, Wen Xinya could detect Zhou Tianyu\u2019s intention of giving her information on the wealthy families in the Capital city, though she did it in a subtle way.Wen Xinya was truly grateful from the bottom of her heart. She did not have a chance to find out nor had anybody told her what she needed to know about these affluential families from the Capital city. Though she had lived for 10 years in their midst in her previous life, she had no way of entering this circle.Zhou Tianyu glanced at the people around the room. She looked at the boys who were drinking happily and said, \u201cThough these people may look arrogant at first, when you get to know them better you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re a loyal bunch and full of righteousness.\u201dOf course, Wen Xinya was aware of that. Han Mofeng was a good example of a loyal friend. And those who hung out with him would naturally be of such caliber as well.Zhou Tianyu continued, \u201cSince Xu-er has formally introduced you to the group, you will also be part of the gang from now onwards. We would like you to join us for future events and celebrations. You have no reason to reject us.\u201dWen Xinya was well aware of that. Joining this group meant a great deal to her in building her connections in society. Of course, she would not reject. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d she replied.\u201cOh yes, the second day of next month is my birthday. I\u2019ll be holding a mini party. You must come.\u201dWen Xinya was aware of Zhou Tianyu\u2019s effort to help her to get closer to this group of friends, hence inviting her to the mini party. It was the first time Wen Xinya had ever received any formal invitation since her rebirth. \u201cYes, I will definitely be there.\u201dEveryone enjoyed themselves that night. They had great fun and everyone had their fill. When most of them started to get drunk, Wen Xinya requested a waiter to bring some hot tea. This would prevent them from getting a hang-over the next day.As they left the place at around 11 o\u2019clock, everyone exchanged contact numbers with Wen Xinya before leaving. It was also a form of acceptance for her joining their group.A waiter helped and guided the drunk Xu Zhenyu out of the Ninth-Heaven. When they reached the entrance of the club, Wen Xinya took over and held Xu Zhenyu by his arm. He suddenly hugged Wen Xinya and put his head on her shoulder. \u201cWen Xinya, oh\u2026 My birthday\u2026 You have not\u2026 yet wished me \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019.\u201dWen Xinya tried to push him and helped him balance himself. However, Xu Zhenyu was very drunk and could not balance himself. He fell right back into Wen Xinya\u2019s arms. \u201cQuick\u2026 wish me \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019.\u201d\u201cAlright. I wish you a Happy Birthday. Will that do?\u201d Wen Xinya said impatiently.She did not expect Xu Zhenyu to take a step further. He bit on her shoulder lightly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough\u2026 to just wish me \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019\u2026 Not enough\u2026 I want a birthday present\u2026\u201dWen Xinya felt a pain on her shoulder. She slapped Xu Zhenyu\u2019s face trying to make him sober. \u201cXu-er, you must have been born in the Year of Dog.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I wasn\u2019t born in the Year of Dog\u2026 I was born in the Year of Wolf\u2026 A crying wolf! And I am going to\u2026 swallow you!\u201d Xu Zhenyu suddenly opened his mouth wide and made a sound of wolf-cry. Then he leaned against her. This time, close to her face.A drunken man reeking of alcohol leaning against her, it was Wen Xinya\u2019s natural reaction to slap his face and push him away. \u201cXu-er, are you courting death?!\u201dXu Zhenyu behaved like a little child, holding her close and whined. \u201cI\u2019m not courting death. I want\u2026 I want a birthday present\u2026 I want a present\u2026\u201dWen Xinya could not stand him throwing tantrums. She removed a piece of ear stud that she was wearing. It had small pieces of diamonds attached to its border and a pink pearl in the middle. She placed it into his hands, and said, \u201cWill that do?\u201dXu Zhenyu watched her remove the ear stud from her ear. It reminded him of the scene at the airport where he did the same thing for her. His heart rate started to increase. He continued his tantrum. \u201cNo way\u2026 You have to\u2026 put it on for me!\u201dWen Xinya noticed the remaining six ear studs on his left ear. There was a gap in the position where he used to wear the red diamond ear stud. She touched her left ear and felt the red diamond ear stud she was wearing now. She then helped him put on the ear stud with the pink pearl.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXu Zhenyu could feel the warmth from her hands when she touched his ear. Her face was close to him and her warm breath landed on the back of his ear. He could smell the light fragrance from her body. His heart was pumping wildly and he almost could not breathe. Both his heart rate and temperature were rising uncontrollably.\u201cMy ear stud is not as valuable as your red diamond ear stud. Hope you won\u2019t despise it.\u201d After putting it on, Wen Xinya took a step back and looked at him. The ear stud looked beautiful, but it made him look like a sissy. She could not help but burst into laughter.Xu Zhenyu touched his ear and felt the ear stud she put on for him. His heart was still thumping fast.Right at this moment, a taxi came by and stopped in front of them. Wen Xinya helped Xu Zhenyu to get into the taxi and sent him off after informing the driver his address.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wen Xinya reeked of alcohol and was feeling a little nauseous. She sat in the courtyard under the viburnum tree. She could smell the mild fragrance from the viburnum flowers and feel the breeze that blew onto her face. It made her relaxed and comfortable.\u201cWhy did you come back so late?\u201d asked a cold voice, sending chills down her spine.Wen Xinya looked up and squinted her eyes. She saw Si Yiyan standing in front of her. Under the dim moonlight, she could not make much of his expression clearly, and all she could see was a dark shadow covering his face. This gave her a mysterious feeling.\u201cYou have been drinking!\u201d Si Yiyan added.Wen Xinya\u2019s eye sparkled. She replied, \u201cMm, today is Second Young Master Xu\u2019s birthday. We were celebrating for him so we had a few drinks. I was able to hold my liquor and did not get drunk. Xu-er and a few other friends weren\u2019t as good. They got drunk and couldn\u2019t even balance themselves.\u201dThere was some excitement in her voice. It was obvious that she had enjoyed herself at the party. \u201cLet me help you to your room. You shouldn\u2019t be out in the wind after drinking. You\u2019ll catch a cold.\u201dIt was probably the effect from the alcohol, Wen Xinya was acting childishly than usual. She pouted and responded, \u201cNo! I want to look at the stars and count every one of them. Who said there are too many stars in the sky? I want to count them all tonight!\u201dSi Yiyan laughed at her. She was obviously drunk and would not admit it. He had no choice but to try coaxing her again. \u201cBe good and obedient! It does not feel good to be sick. You have to stay in the hospital and you might have to get some injection if you\u2019re sick.\u201dWen Xinya made a funny face. She tilted her head as if she was deep in thought. Then she shook her head and said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want that. I\u2019m thirsty. I want water!\u201dSi Yiyan stroked her hair lovingly and said, \u201cOkay, let me get you some water. I\u2019ll also make a glass of tomato juice for you to help disperse the alcohol in your body. Otherwise, you will get a hangover tomorrow.\u201d\u201cMm, okay!\u201d Wen Xinya nodded. Si Yiyan\u2019s voice sounded clear and crisp in her ear. She could also smell the mild fragrance of bamboo coming from him.Indeed, she had drunk a lot earlier. But she managed it well because of her past 10 years of drinking in her previous life. The alcohol she drank that night was nothing in her eyes. It was probably after staying outdoors in the cold wind that enhanced the effects of the alcohol.Wen Xinya looked up into the night sky. In the month of May, the sky always looked dark and vast without borders. The dim stars in the sky blinked a little without much brightness. It gave a sense of loneliness.This was the same feeling she felt with Si Yiyan. He was so close to her in proximity, and yet she felt so distant from him. She was always unable to guess what he was thinking and he always seemed to be a mysterious character, just like the dark mysterious sky. There was always room for guessing and assumptions.After a while, Si Yiyan came walking towards her.His silhouette was barely visible under the dim light from the sky. The dark scenery behind him enhanced his aura and he became even more mysterious than ever.Under the same dim light, Wen Xinya\u2019s drunken eyes sparkled like the stars in the sky when she blinked. This pair of eyes revealed her youthfulness and a slight sense of childishness in her. He was extremely attracted by her cuteness.Wen Xinya received the cup of tomato juice he prepared for her. She brought it close to her nose and sniffed. The strong sour smell made her even more nauseous. She then started to vomit uncontrollably all over Si Yiyan, who was squatting beside her.Puke!Wen Xinya continuously vomited a few times, almost emptying everything in her stomach. She started feeling much better and less nauseous.\u201cHow are you feeling? Do you feel better after vomiting?\u201d Si Yiyan patted and stroked her back hoping to make her feel better.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I feel much better now!\u201d Wen Xinya finally recovered and caught up with her breath. The disgusting smell of puke lingered in the air, making her frown hard at the unbearable smell.She started noticing the mess on the floor that was caused by her puke. Then a pair of exquisite leather shoes appeared in her vision. She raised her head slowly and saw her puke all over Si Yiyan. There was some on his shirt and his black pants.\u201cYour clothes\u2026\u201d Wen Xinya looked at the mess she caused and felt apologetic towards him. \u201cSo sorry. I did not expect to puke all over you.\u201d She apologized.\u201cNo problem. I\u2019ll take a bath later and be fine after changing into a new set of clothes,\u201d replied Si Yiyan calmly.Wen Xinya was still feeling uneasy for what she had done. \u201cQuick, return to your room and change now! You can leave me alone here.\u201d\u201cLet me help you return to your room first.\u201d Si Yiyan held her arm to help her stand up.\u201cArgh!\u201d After vomiting, Wen Xinya\u2019s legs were tired and she almost did not have the strength to stand up. She nearly lost balance and fell to the ground.Si Yiyan bent slightly and carried her body horizontally in his arms.\u201cAh!\u201d Wen Xinya gasped in a shock. She reached out and held on to his shoulder. Her face started to blush and got warmer. \u201cSi Yiyan, what are you doing? Let me go! I can walk on my own!\u201dSi Yiyan\u2019s eyes gleamed as he replied, \u201cYou\u2019re welcomed. It\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not appreciative of your gesture. I asked you to let go of me. Did you hear me?\u201d Wen Xinya gave him a hard stare and pushed his chest trying to get away. Though he looked skinny, he was quite strong and had well-built chest muscles and she could not seem to push him away.After some struggling along the way, they arrived at her room. While still carrying her in his arms, Si Yiyan walked straight towards the bathroom and put her down on the chair just outside the bathroom. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll put you down now,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya was furious. She kept angrily staring at him.Si Yiyan said with a smile, \u201cWait for a while. I\u2019ll prepare a hot bath for you. You were just exposed to some chilly wind. Take a hot bath now and you\u2019ll not catch a cold tomorrow.\u201dShe was taken aback and had a weird feeling by his thoughtful gestures. Nothing she did seemed to be able to stop him from being caring and gentle towards her. Wen Xinya tried clearing her thoughts. \u201cThank you. Sorry to trouble you.\u201dHer words seemed to be signaling him to keep a distance. Si Yiyan ignored her and continued his way into the bathroom to prepare some hot water for her bath.She could hear the sound of water flowing from the tap coming from inside the bathroom.After a while, Si Yiyan walked out of the bathroom. \u201cYour bath is ready. I\u2019ve added a few drops of lavender essential oil into the water. It can help you relax and soothe your nerves. It also helps you get a good night\u2019s sleep!\u201d he said.\u201cOh! Okay!\u201d Hearing Si Yiyan\u2019s clear and crisp voice, Wen Xinya lost the presence of her mind. She did not even dare to look at him directly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter Si Yiyan\u2019s departure, Wen Xinya heaved a sigh of relief. It was a 60 square meters bathroom, yet she felt repressed being in the same room as Si Yiyan. She almost held her breath and could not breathe normally.She slowly walked into the bathroom, removed her clothes and lied into the bathtub. Her body was surrounded by the warm water and the temperature was just right for her. The fragrance from the lavender oil filled her nose. It was such a good feeling that she said to herself in a low voice, \u201cAh! It feels good!\u201dAfter soaking her body in the water for a while, Wen Xinya felt relaxed and soft. It reminded her of a phrase from the poem \u201cThe Song of Everlasting Regret\u201d\u2014She, who was rewarded for a bath in the Huaqing Pool on a cold spring day, cleansed her body in the hot spring water. A maid helped the relaxed and delicate body out of the pool and it was time for her to serve the Emperor.Right at this moment, Wen Xinya suddenly shook her head hard to dispel her thoughts. \u201cSplat!

After doing some morning exercises, she freshened herself after taking a bath. Fortunately, with Si Yiyan\u2019s help last night she did not catch a cold though she was exposed to the chill wind of the night.The ambiance in the living room was intense. Old Master Mo was holding the newspaper in his hands and he looked serious. \u201cYou mentioned you attended a birthday party last night. Was Second Young Master Xu the birthday boy?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Last night, Xu-er introduced me to his group of friends from society. Everyone had a great time,\u201d replied Wen Xinya. She had a weird feeling. Grampy had never probed about anything relating to her personal life. Why was he showing concern towards her friends this morning?Old Master Mo did not look happy. He handed the newspaper over to Wen Xinya and said, \u201cLook at it yourself!\u201dWen Xinya took over the newspaper and looked at it. The headline wrote: Young Missus Wen\u2019s secret rendezvous with Second Young Master Xu in the evening!!!There were three exclamation marks added to the end of the headline. This clearly indicated there was an affair going on between them.Following the headline was four photographs. The first one showed both of them walking out from the Ninth-Heaven Club. The second was a picture of Xu Zhenyu hugging her. The third picture showed Wen Xinya putting on an ear stud for Xu Zhenyu. It was a little blurry, plus some trick with the camera\u2019s angle it appeared that Wen Xinya was kissing on his cheek. The last photograph showed Wen Xinya helping Xu Zhenyu getting into the taxi! And there were two red circles to highlight each of their ears. Anyone who was close to Xu Zhenyu would notice the difference in his ear studs.The written content was even more shocking. It revealed everything about Wen Xinya\u2019s past identity for the past 15 years. It also reported how Xu Zhenyu was a spoiled brat and how this spoiled brat made use of his wealth to support Wen Xinya\u2019s bad behavior. Wen Xinya was described as an unrefined person with no virtues and a bad character. In fact, she has had numerous secret affairs with many different male counterparts.Wen Xinya took a deep breath and placed the newspaper on the table. \u201cGrampy, there is nothing going on between me and Xu Zhenyu. It wasn\u2019t anything like what the newspaper described. Xu Zhenyu was dead drunk last night and I had to send him home by taxi. As for the ear stud, I was rushing and did not have time to buy a birthday present for him. Therefore I gave him my ear stud as a present. It doesn\u2019t mean anything special.\u201dOld Master Mo believed her. \u201cThe ear stud with a red diamond on your ear. Is it a gift from Xu Zhenyu?\u201d he asked.Wen Xinya unconsciously raised her hand to feel the ear stud and replied, \u201cYes, it is.\u201dOld Master Mo frowned. He said, \u201cThis ear stud is extremely valuable. You should have avoided accepting such an expensive gift.\u201dThough Grampy was a little unhappy, he was not really angry with her. Considering she was young and innocent, she could be inexperienced and did not handle such matters well. Thus creating an opportunity for the media to come up with a story that was untrue. Little did he expect that after her rebirth, Wen Xinya and Xu Zhenyu had developed their relationship into a deeper level.Wen Xinya frowned too. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect things to turn out this way. Obviously, I was being monitored and someone was out to get me. I just returned to the Wen Family and the people in the media industry have been watching me closely. They will make use of the slightest opportunity to blow up any news on me and create rumors. Whoever was out to get me, he just found a perfect timing.\u201dBoth Wen Xinya and Xu Zhenyu were underage. There was nothing wrong with them exchanging gifts or hanging out together as close friends. They could be flirting with each other but it was acceptable. The newspaper article neglected the fact that both of them were underage and wrote about their relationship in a sleazy way. The person who was out to get Wen Xinya had wanted to destroy her reputation. Ning Shuqian was the only person she could think of that was capable of doing this. She was not sure if Xia Ruya was involved though.Old Master Mo gave her a cold stare. \u201cYou are indeed well aware of that!\u201dWithin a few hours, this incident had become one of the latest hot news every newspaper and magazine was writing about. It was obvious that somebody was trying to manipulate and influence the media from behind the scenes.Wen Xinya rubbed her forehead and looked troubled, feeling brain-numb for a while. Then she said in a tone of regret, \u201cIt was all my fault. Since I moved over to Grampy\u2019s place, I have been focusing on learning every day and have almost forgotten about the potential threats. I wasn\u2019t careful enough and created an opportunity for those people to spread rumors about me. I\u2019m to be blamed.\u201dIndeed, she was reliant on Grampy\u2019s protection all this while and had unknowingly lowered her guard against external threats. She had almost forgotten that Ning Shuqian and Xia Ruya were like two venomous snakes hiding in their snake holes. They were ready to strike and attack her anytime she was caught off-guard. This incident had taught Wen Xinya a lesson. She should have never lowered her guard against Ning Shuqian and Xia Ruya.\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Old Master Mo looked at her. She seemed to have cleared her thoughts and had a plan in mind after doing some analysis of the matter.Wen Xinya replied with a serious look, \u201cThis matter could be tricky. You must be aware that the media acts as a double-edged sword. Anyone can easily use the media to bring someone into fame, but they can also use it to destroy somebody.\u201d\u201cIf you think it will be difficult to handle, let Grampy settle it for you.\u201d He thought it would be a perfect opportunity for him to make an official announcement to establish his relationship with Xinya. Even if Xinya lacked the acknowledgment and support from the Wen Family, she had the backing of her Grampy. By standing up for her, no one would ever dare to make use of the media to write negatively about his granddaughter again.Wen Xinya was well aware of Grampy\u2019s intention. She was touched and deeply appreciative of his good intentions. She looked at him and said in a firm tone, \u201cGrampy, I need to be the one to resolve this matter.\u201d\u201cXinya, it\u2019s not that Grampy doesn\u2019t trust you. But you have to know, the power and influence of the media are far beyond what one could ever imagine. If you cannot settle this matter fast, it will have an even bigger negative impact on you.\u201d Though Xinya could analyze it rationally, she was young and inexperienced. She might not yet be able to see things from multiple perspectives.Wen Xinya held Grampy\u2019s hand and look at him in his eyes. \u201cGrampy, I am well aware of the power of the media. And because of that, I have to stand up for myself. I\u2019ve led a wandering life for the past 15 years. The Wen Family did not make any official announcement to acknowledge me after my return. Moreover, I have an unglamorous past. I do not have a strong foothold in the Wen Family as Missus Wen. This gave the media an excuse to put me in a negative light. I have to stand up for myself this time. It will be the first battle I fight with the identity of Missus Wen. After I\u2019ve established myself as the real Missus Wen from the Wen Family, I will not be bullied by anyone anymore.\u201dShe was definitely aware of the power of the media. In her previous life, she was always put into the negative light by the media and that destroyed her life! In this lifetime, she had decided to confront the media and not back out.Old Master Mo appreciated her for being clear-minded. However, he was worried about her at the same time. \u201cXinya, no matter what happens, remember that Grampy will always be here for you. You do not have to face every challenge by yourself. You\u2019ll always have my support.\u201dThere were tears in her eyes as Wen Xinya replied, \u201cYes, I know. No matter what happens, I\u2019ll always have Grampy watching my back.\u201dOld Master Mo smiled. \u201cGrampy is happy to know that you agree.\u201dOld Master Mo continued, \u201cXinya, Grampy doesn\u2019t want to interfere in your choice of friends. However, you must think twice about the Second Young Master Xu. His behavior seems to be ridiculous at times.\u201dWen Xinya knew Grampy had good intentions for her, but she also remembered what Xu Zhenyu had done for her in her previous life. She could not help but defend Xu Zhenyu, \u201cGrampy, Xu Zhenyu might behave ridiculously at times and he is indeed a spoiled brat from a wealthy family. But he is just a rebellious teenager. He has a kind heart by nature.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing the seriousness in her expression, Old Master Mo knew Wen Xinya valued Xu Zhenyu as a friend. He just gave her a final piece of advice. \u201cOkay. I know you are a calm and intelligent person. I won\u2019t dwell on it further. Just remember that you have to always remain calm and handle matters in a tactful manner. Do not create opportunities for others to put you in a bad light again.\u201dShe appreciated Grampy\u2019s respect for her. She replied softly, \u201cGrampy, this incident was unexpected. Please be assured that I\u2019ll be more careful in the future.\u201dGrampy stroked her hair, feeling consoled. \u201cThose who are out to harm you are waiting and will take every opportunity to attack you. You have to be alert and not let them catch you off-guard.\u201dWen Xinya nodded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their members were some of the wealthiest people in the city. Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya were regulars of this spa.Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya were in a VIP room within the spa. Fragrances from the essential oils filled the air. Ning Shuqian was enjoying a full-body SPA treatment while Wen Yuya was enjoying a lavender oil massage. Both were very expensive SPA packages.The spa beautician who was serving her whispered into her ears, \u201cMadam Wen, we have just imported some new lavender essential oils from France. These oils will help your skin maintain its youthfulness and the fragrance could last as long as one week. Would you like to give it a try?\u201dNing Shuqian, who was lying on the bed, said in a lazy tone, \u201cSure, let\u2019s give it a try!\u201d\u201cCertainly. I will carry out a lavender oil massage for you,\u201d said the beautician. She then got out of the room to make preparations.Ning Shuqian\u2019s cell phone rang. She took a look at her phone and smiled with satisfaction. \u201cHello, Editor Yang!\u201dWen Yuya, who was lying on the other side, opened her eyes and started listening carefully to the conversation.A middle-aged male voice came from the other end of the line. He said in a sharp and irritating voice, \u201cMadam Wen, have you seen the newspaper and magazines today? I have completed the tasks you requested. When are you going to pay me the rest of the promised money?\u201dOf course, Ning Shuqian had already seen the newspaper and magazines today. She was greatly satisfied with Editor Yang\u2019s efficiency. It was all thanks to Ruya for introducing Editor Yang to her. \u201cNot bad. But it\u2019s not enough. I will send you more information shortly. I want to totally ruin her reputation and let her suffer the greatest humiliation.\u201dEditor Yang was in shock. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t what we had initially agreed on. Why are there sudden changes?\u201d He continued in a vicious tone, \u201cMadam Wen, please do not play tricks with me. If you make me mad, I will expose this incident.\u201dNing Shuqian did not expect Editor Yang to be so influential in the media industry. He had managed to spread the news to every corner of the city within a short timeframe. \u201cPlease be assured, I will reward you handsomely for your efforts. I\u2019ll transfer to you the rest shortly. In addition, I\u2019ll give you another 500,000 dollars after you\u2019ve accomplished the required task.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s much better.\u201dAfter hearing his reply, Ning Shuqian was assured that he would be able to accomplish the given task. She said in a joyful tone, \u201cEditor Yang, a capable person will only be paid for solving someone else\u2019s problem. You should be well aware of how the game is played, am I right?\u201dEditor Yang reassured Ning Shuqian. \u201cYes, I am aware. Madam Wen, please do not worry. My mouth is sealed. I will never give you away. Once I receive the money I\u2019ll go to somewhere far away and never appear before you ever again.\u201dNing Shuqian was happy to hear that. \u201cWell, if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019ll wait patiently for you to bring me some good news.\u201dNing Shuqian ended the call. Wen Yuya asked impatiently, \u201cMother, what\u2019s the progress of the matter?\u201dWen Yuya was reminded of what happened that day at the Jo-ramst shop. Wen Xinya was walking towards her, and the light from behind her lit up on Wen Xinya, putting her in the spotlight. Wen Yuya could only look up to Wen Xinya from where she was. She felt as if Wen Xinya had overpowered her world and she could only live in her shadow.Right at that moment, she suddenly realized Wen Xinya was her nemesis in this life.Ning Shuqian smiled with satisfaction and raised her brow. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Editor Yang has got everything covered.\u201dWen Yuya was happy to hear that. She said in a wicked tone, \u201cMother, this time I\u2019ll let that bitch, Wen Xinya, have her reputation become totally ruined.\u201dNing Shuqian replied with a smile, \u201cYes, let\u2019s do it right this time.\u201dWen Yuya became hesitant. \u201cMother, if we manage to ruin Wen Xinya\u2019s reputation, would Grandpa and Grandma really disown her? She is the only flesh and blood to the Wen Family and Grandpa has always valued kinship. What if\u2026\u201d she asked.\u201cSilly kid. It doesn\u2019t matter even if the Wen Family values kinship. This doesn\u2019t change the fact that they will always prioritize the Wen Family\u2019s reputation over everything else. Do you remember how we managed to drive her out of the family with minimal effort? That\u2019s because Grandpa also despised Wen Xinya for her unglamorous past. Your Father has a strong sense of pride as well. If Wen Xinya is put in a bad light, that\u2019ll indirectly affect the Wen Family as well. Your Father will be the first to disown her, together with your Grandma who will definitely take his side. I will also influence your Father to let the Board of Directors and shareholders of the Wen Corporation persuade your Grandpa. In this way, we\u2019ll have everything under our control.\u201dShe had originally intended to slowly torture Mo Yunyao\u2019s daughter by leading her to a path of no return. She would allow Wen Xinya to fall into a bottomless dark hole and give up on herself. Anyone could walk over her and she would have a ruined reputation and lose all her dignity. However, little did she expect that that little bitch Wen Xinya was far more difficult to deal with than she thought. She had no choice but to act fast.\u201cMother, will the Board of Directors and shareholders interfere in the Wen Family affairs?\u201d Wen Yuya opened her eyes wide in disbelief.\u201cThe Wen Family is the largest shareholder of the Wen Corporation. Your Grandpa holds the position of Chairman for the Board of Directors. Any negative news about Wen Xinya would impact the reputation of the Wen Family directly. And this, in turn, will affect the Wen Corporation indirectly, causing its share price to drop. They are all interlinked. The Board of Directors will not turn a blind eye.\u201d Birds of the same feather flock together. Just like the Wen Family, the Board of Directors too prioritized their interests over everything else. This made them easy targets for her manipulation.Wen Yuya felt assured. \u201cMother, you are the smartest.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve finally realized my strengths?\u201d Ning Shuqian replied with a sly look on her face.Wen Yuya laughed. \u201cMother, you are the smartest mum on the planet. Wen Xinya thought she would be safe by hiding in her Grampy\u2019s place. Never belittle the one who is more experienced. Fortunately, we\u2019ve listened to your advice and did not act recklessly. Now we\u2019ve finally caught her off-guard and found an opportunity to make good use of this incident against her.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. What good does it make to confront her with an argument? You do not get anything out of it. See who laughs the loudest in the end? You have to change your temper and start thinking rationally.\u201d Ning Shuqian advised with care.Wen Yuya replied elatedly, \u201cMother, I understand!\u201d\u201cNow that Wen Xinya is being put in a bad light, you should be staying at home more to accompany Grandpa and Grandma. Ruya has returned to the Xia Family, and while Wen Xinya is away, the two elders will be lonely. This is the best chance to build a good relationship with them.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Yuya\u2019s expression turned pale. She said, \u201cMother, you know both Grandpa and Grandma have treated me coldly sometimes, I am\u2026\u201d\u201cTo achieve your goals, you have to be adaptable and be patient. If you can adapt to any situation, you would have already achieved half of the success.\u201dWen Yuya nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201dNing Shuqian was a little worried. Xia Ruya had been visiting the Wen Family\u2019s mansion frequently these few days. It was obvious that she wanted to get close to Grandpa and Grandma. While Wen Xinya\u2019s bad news was spreading, Xia Ruya\u2019s virtues would immediately be contrasted. The two elders would then naturally favor Xia Ruya who had been living with them for the past 12 years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She wanted to monitor Ning Shuqian and Xia Ruya closely. It was common for attorneys to have a few private investigators in close working relationships.After she had hung up, Ou Yangfeng, Zhou Tianyu, Grandpa Du and Du Ruo called to comfort her. Zhou Tianyu had offered to clarify matters on her behalf but Wen Xinya rejected her offer. She wanted to deal with it herself. She had already returned to the Wen family for some time, it was time she stood up for herself to establish a name in society.When Wen Xinya finally got off the phone, she saw Si Yiyan standing under the viburnum tree. He was wearing a spotless white shirt, displaying his strong and sturdy physique. There was a strong mysterious aura around him. The bright sunlight shone on him, enhancing his simplicity and virtues. She was dumbfounded by this scene.Si Yiyan noticed her standing beside her bedroom window. He suddenly advanced towards the window. With a leap, he entered her room.It happened within seconds and caught Wen Xinya by surprise. \u201cWhat are you doing? Get out! Who gave you permission to enter my room? Aren\u2019t you aware that it\u2019s rude to enter a girl\u2019s room without permission?\u201dSi Yiyan smirked. \u201cRelax! It\u2019s not the first time I come into your room. If you do not remember, let me remind you about last night\u2026\u201dWen Xinya gritted her teeth furiously. The only thing he did was to help her into the room and prepared some hot water for her bath. But from the way he described, it sounded as if they were having an affair last night.Si Yiyan laughed. \u201cWhy are you staring at me? I am concerned about you. Did you sleep well last night? Do you feel any discomfort this morning?\u201dWen Xinya stared hard at him, flushed with anger. \u201cThank you, I\u2019m fine!\u201d she replied.Si Yiyan replied with a smile, \u201cThat\u2019s good! I was worried you might catch a cold after exposing yourself to the cold wind last night.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m good. Thank you for your concern,\u201d replied Wen Xinya coldly. Obviously, she was still upset that he barged into her room without a warning.Si Yiyan commented. \u201cYou\u2019re such a heartless person. Someone puked all over me last night, and I was the one preparing a hot bath and tea for you. How can you turn your back against me now?\u201dHis intimate response softened Wen Xinya, making her blush. \u201cI\u2019m not a heartless person. Do not spout nonsense! Who gave you permission to enter my room last night?\u201dSi Yiyan suddenly raised his head and looked at her. Wen Xinya could not avoid in time and they made eye-contact. There were passion and warmth in his eyes. She could feel his enthusiasm and was mesmerized by him. She had almost forgotten to breathe.\u201cDo you\u2026 Do you have anything for me?\u201d Wen Xinya turned her face away to break their eye-contact.\u201cI\u2019ve done some investigation and managed to find something interesting. Do you want to take a look?\u201d Si Yiyan\u2019s eyes suddenly caught the ear stud on her ear. He remembered it. She had started wearing it from that time she was at the airport to fetch Old Mo and did not remove it since then.Wen Xinya was startled. \u201cIs it about today\u2019s news?\u201dHer scandal had just been reported and he was already able to carry out an investigation with some findings. His fast action made her feel uneasy. Only a man with a strong influence would be able to accomplish such a task at this speed.\u201cMmm!\u201d Si Yiyan handed over a large envelope to her.Wen Xinya took the envelope and started looking through the information on the documents inside. Very soon, the name of an organization caught her eye. \u201cHeavenbright Press Media?\u201dWen Xinya had already heard about Heavenbright Press Media numerous times. In her previous life, Heavenbright Press Media would be the first to report all the bad news that Wen Xinya was involved in. This press media was even sued by many well-known artistes in the city for the defamation they made in one of their headlines. That was why she had a deep impression of this press media.\u201cAfter some investigation, I\u2019ve found out that it was Heavenbright Press Media who started it all. Within a short period of time, almost every press media in the city has received a similar envelope like this containing news about your scandal. I have also checked on this press media company.\u201d Si Yiyan observed Wen Xinya\u2019s reaction and she seemed to have heard about this company. He was surprised. This company was set up just a few days ago. How did she find out about it?\u201cThese are very detailed information!\u201d Wen Xinya carefully looked through the information about Heavenbright Press Media. Her attention was brought to the Chief Editor of the company, Yang Chongguang. There was detailed information about Yang Chongguang, including his hobbies and even the names of the women he had slept with.Si Yiyan replied softly, \u201cMmm. These are all that I\u2019ve managed to get. I hope they are useful to you.\u201dIn fact, he wished he could stand up for her. He did not want his beloved girl to be involved in a scandal with another man. However, she needed to be stronger. She did not need to hide behind the protection of a man. What she wanted was the power to control her own destiny.Wen Xinya had a plan. She kept the documents and thanked him. \u201cThank you very much. I can make good use of this information.\u201dBefore she got hold of these data, she did not have a clear direction. But after receiving these documents from Si Yiyan, she had a good plan of action. She knew this was a good opportunity for her to get back at Ning Shuqian.\u201cBy doing you such a big favor, do you think you owe me an explanation for the relationship between you and Xu Zhenyu?\u201d She was an intelligent girl. He only needed to do the right things at the right time and she would be able to handle any situation well.Si Yiyan watched Wen Xinya as she was deep in thought. She had Xu Zhenyu\u2019s ear stud on her ear, and Xu Zhenyu had hers on his ear as well. They seemed to have an intimate relationship where Si Yiyan had no way to interfere.Wen Xinya did not expect such a question from him. She unknowingly replied to him these words, \u201cAre you\u2026 Are you jealous?\u201dShe nearly bit her tongue off when she realized she should not have spoken in this way, indicating there was indeed something going on between her and Si Yiyan.Si Yiyan walked towards her and wrapped his arms around her. He said in a deep tone of voice, \u201cWen Xinya, you are an intelligent girl. Your eyes\u2026\u201d He then raised his hands and stroked her eyelids gently. \u201cCan see through someone\u2019s soul,\u201d he continued.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTherefore, she could see through him and knew what he was thinking.Right at this moment, Wen Xinya was flustered. She could feel the warmth from the touch on her eyelids. Her heart was racing. She tilted her head and moved away from his fingers. Unknowingly, she felt a sense of guilt and replied, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on between Xu Zhenyu and myself.\u201dShe could not explain why she felt the need to answer to him. But indeed he had gone through an extra mile and did her a great favor. Maybe he did it so that he could confront her for an explanation on this matter. She realized she could not refuse or let him down.Si Yiyan\u2019s eyes glittered with passion like fireworks in the sky. He was able to provide certainty in times of vulnerability. \u201cI will believe anything you say!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the morning, he was awakened by the loud ringing from his cell phone. He found it a nuisance and went back to sleep as soon as he turned it off.However, the other party did not give up. When he could not get through on Xu Zhenyu\u2019s cell number, he called through the landline number in his room. Second Young Master Xu had a bad headache. He removed the phone from the charging unit and there was finally peace in the house again.He thought he was finally able to catch some sleep before suddenly there was a loud knocking sound on his door.Knock, knock, knock!Second Young Master Xu got furious and kicked his blanket aside. He walked to the door and opened it. Then he started shouting, \u201cWho is the one being so damn inconsiderate? Do you know the worst thing you can do is to disturb others from their sleep early in the morning?\u201dHan Mofeng pushed a stack of newspapers and magazines into his arms. \u201cTake a look at these. See if you can go back to sleep after reading them.\u201dXu Zhenyu still looked confused. He gave Han Mofeng a stare of suspicion and took a look at one of the magazines\u2014the notoriously spoiled brat from the Capital city vs the misbehaved daughter from a wealthy family who has been missing for 15 years!!!Following were numerous photographs of him and Wen Xinya behaving intimately. Because of the camera\u2019s angle, it looked as if they were in an intimate relationship and were behaving inappropriately in public. The article further described what a spoiled brat he was and they even showed indecent photographs from his past. Birds of the same feather flock together. This magazine was obviously making use of his notorious image to ruin Wen Xinya\u2019s reputation.Xu Zhenyu\u2019s face turned pale. He furiously flipped through one magazine after another, and then he continued to look at the newspapers for the same report. Almost all newspapers and magazines had similar content. They were all making use of his negative image to ruin Wen Xinya.\u201cWhat nonsense is this? This is ridiculous!\u201d Xu Zhenyu threw the stack of newspapers and magazines to the floor in anger. Then he behaved madly and torn it all into small pieces. \u201cThese media reports are twisting the facts. They are all out to hurt Xinya. What has she done to offend them? How could they bombard Xinya with the use of such negative words?\u201dHan Mofeng tried to console him. \u201cXu-er, calm down. You can\u2019t solve a problem by throwing a tantrum.\u201d\u201cHow can I calm down? What wrong has Xinya done to deserve such bad treatments? I must teach these sons of bitches a lesson\u2026\u201d Xu Zhenyu ran downstairs like a gust of wind.Han Mofeng chased after him and caught him by his arm. \u201cXu-er, don\u2019t act recklessly. Why don\u2019t you give Xinya a call?\u201dXu Zhenyu suddenly came to his senses. He grabbed the cell phone from Han Mofeng and started dialing. The line was engaged. He did not give up and kept trying\u2026The commotion caused by Han Mofeng and Xu Zhenyu alarmed the Xu Family. Mother Xu came over worriedly and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Why are you throwing a tantrum early in the morning?\u201dThe Xu Family had seen the news this morning as well. However, they were not affected by it as it was common for Xu Zhenyu to appear notoriously in the news headlines. Though it seemed a little more serious than usual, they only felt that the media was making use of Xu Zhenyu to hurt Wen Xinya, thus they did not mind about it.Han Mofeng replied helplessly, \u201cWe held a mini party at the Ninth-Heaven Club last night to celebrate Xu-er\u2019s birthday. The Young Mistress from the Wen Family who was lost for the past 15 years, Wen Xinya, was there too. Xu-er seemed to like her a lot. We were all drunk and Xinya helped Tianyu sent everyone back. Then she sent Xu-er home as they were the last to leave. Little did we expect\u2026\u201dHan Mofeng\u2019s words left everyone in the Xu Family speechless.Xu Zhenyu was still calling Wen Xinya\u2019s cell number. Though the line was engaged, he kept trying. He paced up and down in the living room impatiently and pulled his hair furiously.After a long time, the call was finally connected to Wen Xinya\u2019s line. When he heard her voice, his throat was stuck and he could not speak.It was his negative image that gave the media a chance to attack Wen Xinya and thus impacted her reputation badly. He had never expected his past behaviors as a spoiled brat would cause harm to someone else. Furthermore, it was someone he cared about.Hearing Wen Xinya\u2019s voice from the phone, he had a strong sense of guilt. He could not bring himself to face her anymore and hung up after a deep sigh.Han Mofeng was concerned. \u201cDid you manage to get through to her?\u201dXu Zhenyu was vexed and pulled his hair. \u201cYes, it got through!\u201dHan Mofeng asked curiously, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you speak up? Is it that Xinya was angry with you? Did she scold you?\u201d\u201cNope, she didn\u2019t. Instead, she turned over and comforted me. She assured me she would handle the matter herself and asked me not to worry. She also wanted me to stay at home to wait for her updates.\u201d Xu Zhenyu suddenly started screaming and stood up from the sofa. He then kicked and toppled the tea table in front of him.Old Master Xu was angered by his actions and shouted, \u201cAre you crazy? After experiencing this incident, you should be reflecting on your mistakes instead of throwing tantrums at home. Is that what you\u2019re only capable of? Look at her, even a 15-year-old young lady wants to stand up for herself. Look at the state you\u2019re in now.\u201dXu Zhenyu stood motionlessly. He fell into a state of trance after being reprimanded!Old Master Xu was concerned and worried for him. He continued, \u201cLook at all the troubles you\u2019ve caused in the past. That young lady was defamed by the media and got into this state all because of you.\u201dThat\u2019s right! It was all because of him. It was him who behaved childishly and gave a chance for the reporters to capture them on camera, thus landing Xinya into this mess.He was the one who got Xinya\u2019s reputation damaged!Xu Zhenyu suddenly dashed out of the house.Han Mofeng knew that he was going to do something impulsive. He ran after Xu Zhenyu and tried to stop him. \u201cXu-er, can you calm down please?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a good for nothing. I\u2019m not capable enough. Now I\u2019ve created this mess and have to hide behind a girl who is going to solve the problems caused by me. Even if I can\u2019t stand up for Xinya, at least I can do something for her by confronting these newspaper offices and media companies!\u201d Xu Zhenyu said angrily while pushing Han Mofeng\u2019s hand aside.Old Master Xu was furious at his recklessness. \u201cCome back right now, you brainless idiot. Have you ever considered what further harm you might be causing to that young lady from the Wen Family by your actions? Are you trying to push her towards the edge?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIndeed, Old Master Xu\u2019s words finally knocked some sense into Xu Zhenyu. He stopped advancing forward and then screamed like a trapped animal. \u201cThat means there\u2019s nothing I can do? What exactly shall I do to help Xinya?\u201dOld Master Xu sighed. \u201cYou are not to be totally blamed. Someone was out to get Wen Xinya, and they were just making use of your notorious past to achieve their goals. Don\u2019t go anywhere and don\u2019t even think of meeting her. She is their only target, let\u2019s see how she\u2019ll handle the situation. Let me give a few of my newspaper editor friends a call and see if they can help to stop reporting about this incident.\u201dXu Zhenyu was rash indeed. He did not consider properly what further impact he might cause. Fortunately, his Grandpa managed to talk some sense into him. \u201cThank you, Grandpa. Let me give Xinya a call to see what she plans to do and also ask her if there\u2019s anything I can do to help.\u201dOld Master Xu nodded in satisfaction. Xu Zhenyu was finally starting to think rationally. He started to gain interest in the Young Mistress from the Wen Family who had led a wandering life for 15 years. Han Mofeng was a sensible child. If Han Mofeng acknowledged Wen Xinya as a close friend, then she must be someone with a good character.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After her call with Xu Zhenyu, she gave the information obtained from Si Yiyan to him and assigned him a task. Finally, Wen Xinya prepared for her visit to the Wen Family.\u201cIt may be hard to explain yourself to the Wen Family. Let me accompany you!\u201d Old Mr. Mo\u2019s expression turned dark on the mention of the Wen Family, clearly detesting the idea of meeting them.\u201cGrampy, I will eventually have to face the Wen Family. I can deal with this by myself.\u201d Wen Xinya understood that ever since the death of her mother and her very own disappearance, Grampy had never set foot into the Wen Family again. After her father\u2019s marriage with Ning Shuqian, Grampy was even more unwilling to have any ties with the Wen Family.Although Old Mr. Mo was delighted that she was so decisive, her tendency to take everything into her own hands upset him. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, you are only a 15-year-old underaged girl. Hiding behind the back of your family in the time of need is normal.\u201d\u201cI understand, Grampy. I know my limits. Going home alone is just to test Grandpa\u2019s attitude. His opinions will decide my next steps to resolve this incident,\u201d Wen Xinya said, revealing her true motives.Old Mr. Mo could not help but sigh. He may be concerned for her, but there was no need for him to worry over this child who had such a meticulous personality at such a young age. \u201cI see. I will let Uncle Zhang send you there.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Wen Xinya nodded.Uncle Zhang brought her to the gates of the Wen Family house. This was the first time she returned to the old mansion since leaving and staying at Grampy\u2019s place for over a month. A surge of an unfamiliar feeling caused her demeanor to become even more indifferent.Wen Xinya entered the living room. Grandpa was reading the newspaper on the sofa, Ning Shuqian and Grandma were chatting at the side, and Wen Yuya was by Father\u2019s side talking to him.\u201cGrandpa, Grandma, Father, Aunt Ning, I\u2019m back.\u201d Wen Xinya greeted them faintly.Ning Shuqian was the first to speak up. \u201cXinya, welcome back!\u201dWen Xinya nodded lightly and turned her gaze away after giving her a look filled with hidden meaning.Old Madam Wen looked at her in displeasure and said, \u201cCausing such a scandal after living at the Mo Family for a few days. What an utter disgrace to the Wen Family. Have you no shame coming back here?\u201dOld Mr. Wen glared at Old Madam Wen. \u201cWhy would Xinya have any shame coming back to the Wen Family? Is this not her home? Is she not part of the Wen Family?\u201dOld Madam Wen stared back into Old Mr. Wen\u2019s eyes, but she did not dare to challenge him. She mumbled. \u201cOur Wen Family does not have such a disgraceful granddaughter.\u201dOld Mr. Wen could not be bothered with her. He smiled warmly at Xinya and said, \u201cXinya, come to sit beside Grandpa.\u201dIn just a short period of time since he last visited her at the Mo Family, Xinya seemed to have changed a little, becoming even more composed than before.Wen Xinya walked over happily and sat beside Old Mr. Wen.She lifted her head to meet the malicious gaze of Wen Haowen sitting opposite her and returned it with a sweet smile.Wen Haowen stared at her coldly and threw the newspaper in his hand at her face. \u201cYou have already returned to the Wen Family and is no longer the street thug you were before. Every action of yours represents the reputation of Wen Family. How dare you be so negligent? How dare you let people write such degrading news about you, ruining the name of the Wen Family along with it.\u201dWen Xinya removed the newspaper from her face, her indifferent expression reaching its limit.Old Mr. Wen reprimanded. \u201cWhat are you doing? Xinya is just sitting here, yet you refused to listen to her explanations. Not only that, you lashed out at her. Is this how a father should be like?\u201dThe color drained from Wen Haowen\u2019s face. \u201cFather, when I went to the company this morning, everybody there was talking about her. They even brought up our mistake of acknowledging Ruya from a long time ago. Is the Wen Family not disgraced enough? This is all because of you, if you did not insist on bringing this spawn of the devil home, none of this would have happened. It\u2019s fine if you brought her home because you took pity on her who has the Wen blood coursing through her veins. However, you rejected my suggestion to send her abroad, which led to this day. Our entire Wen Family is humiliated along with her.\u201dOld Madam Wen added, \u201cHaowen is right, it was indeed the Wen Family\u2019s fault for Xinya\u2019s 15 years of suffering on the streets since birth. However, she is not suited to be a real wealthy missus. Why don\u2019t we compensate Xinya with a sum of money and send her abroad, and take it as a completion of family duty on our part.\u201dOld Mr. Wen slammed the table. The cups on the table trembled. \u201cOnly you can say such heartless words.\u201dOld Madam Wen rebutted. \u201cHow am I being heartless? This is also for the sake of Xinya. How is it any good for her to be under the attack of the media? Does she not want to retain her humanity!\u201dWen Xinya glared coldly at the Wen Family faces filled with the intent to hurt her for their own benefits. Nothing could shake her heart anymore. After her reincarnation, she became more emotionless.Old Mr. Wen took a deep breath and turned to Wen Xinya beside him. \u201cWhat\u2019s with the news on the papers?\u201dWen Xinya calmly explained. \u201cI met Second Young Master Xu at the airport by chance when I went to fetch Grampy after his seminar at the Southern City. Yesterday was his birthday, so he booked a VIP room at Ninth-Heaven and invited a group of friends for dinner. I was there as well. After the meal, everybody was drunk, so I had to send Second Young Master Xu home. That\u2019s all.\u201dWen Haowen smashed a magazine in front of her face in rage. \u201cSuch lies. You guys were so intimate in the photos, that is clearly not \u2018all\u2019.\u201dComposed, Wen Xinya placed the magazine neatly on the table. \u201cAfter facing the media head-on so many times you should know their tactics of manipulating the camera angles, Father. Second Young Master Xu was drunk. Although me helping him into the rental car was intimate, you seem to have forgotten that both Xu Zhenyu and I are underaged, Father.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Haowen was rendered speechless. However, Ning Shuqian stared intently at Wen Xinya\u2019s left ear. \u201cXinya, the newspaper mentioned that the ruby on your ear was a gift from the Second Young Master Xu. Seeing as to how expensive it is, even if a friend had given you such a valuable item, you should not have accepted it.\u201dWen Xinya beat around the bush in an attempt to prove her relationship with Xu Zhenyu. She said with a faint smile, \u201cXu Zhenyu owed me a favor, so he gave me this pair of earrings as compensation. Everybody knows it is difficult to repay a favor. Him repaying with such a valuable ear stud is no wonder.\u201dWen Yuya said furiously, \u201cWhat about the earrings you gave to Second Young Master Xu? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s not yours! I know that was an accessory bought from Jo-Ramst. Don\u2019t even try to deny it.\u201dWen Xinya looked straight into Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes. \u201cYes, the earrings were indeed mine.

Giving the earrings that you\u2019ve worn as a birthday present for Second Young Master Xu, can you say that there\u2019s nothing between you two even after such a dubious behavior?\u201dWen Xinya said with a forced smile, \u201cSister Yu, in your whole life, have you never given someone an item that you\u2019ve used before?\u201dWen Yuya stamped her foot. \u201cThat\u2019s clearly a different story.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s expression turned stern in a second and said, \u201cHow is that different? It is exactly the same to me. The only difference is that somebody is forcefully trying to imply crap like there is something shady between me and Second Young Master Xu. He who has a mind to beat his dog will easily find a stick. No matter what you say, I\u2019m still innocent.\u201dWen Yuya was prepared to retort, but Ning Shuqian signaled for her to stop with a glance. \u201cSecond Young Master Xu is well-known in the Capital city to be bad company. Interacting with him, it\u2019s no wonder that such dirty news about you is on the papers.\u201dWen Xinya looked deeply at Ning Shuqian and said, \u201cThere\u2019s nobody who hasn\u2019t been attacked by the media this year. Back when Aunt Ning and my father got married, didn\u2019t the media dig out everything about Aunt Ning\u2019s family past? There were even people saying unpleasant things such as Aunt Ning taking advantage of when my mother was pregnant to seduce my father. Don\u2019t tell me it is true that Aunt Ning really had an affair with my father back when my mother was still pregnant?\u201dThe Wen Family was well aware of the truth of the incident back then. Putting her past out on the table, Wen Xinya took away Ning Shuqian\u2019s position to speak in the family. As if there was something stuck in her throat, Ning Shuqian could not bear it and sent Wen Haowen a look of injustice.Wen Haowen was seething with anger. His ugly past was the talk of the town for a long period of time, and now it was even being used against him by the younger generation. His pride could not bear the huge blow and he flew into a rage out of humiliation. \u201cYou devil, what nonsense are you saying?\u201d He turned towards Old Mr. Wen abruptly and said, \u201cFather, we should hurry to send Xinya abroad now when news of her hasn\u2019t been blown up. This way, the rumors and gossip will subside quickly.\u201dWen Xinya ignored Wen Haowen. \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that the media has its eyes on me since I\u2019ve only just returned to the Wen Family. It is also not surprising that they would make use of my return to create breaking news. Father and Aunt Ning blaming everything on me just because of something so trivial, I can\u2019t bear the burden. Back then, both of you did not divorce because of the rumors and gossip. Yet now you are trying to send me abroad based on such insignificant and groundless accusations. Father, Aunt Ning, aren\u2019t you guys overreacting? If word got out, people will say that the Wen Family is taking advantage of each other.\u201dWen Haowen\u2019s face turned ghastly pale, yet he could not utter a single word.Ning Shuqian was red with fury, yet she could not defend her position, unable to say anything.Old Mr. Wen could not help but sigh with regret after seeing this sight. His son and daughter-in-law both despised Xinya, but despite that, she could defend herself. Her thoughts must be as clear as a bright mirror. \u201cXinya is right. It is just a groundless accusation made by the media, there is no need to worry over this.\u201d He claimed.\u201cFather\u2026\u201d Wen Haowen said indignantly.Old Madam Wen kept her mouth shut sullenly as she actually agreed with Wen Xinya\u2019s words.The atmosphere in the house became still.\u201cOld Master, Old Madam, Master and Madam, Miss Ruya is here,\u201d said a servant as she entered with Xia Ruya.Wen Xinya could see through her cold desires. Xia Ruya knew how to make use of every little opportunity to her advantage, just like a fly when it sees a crack on an egg. With scandals of Wen Xinya everywhere, Xia Ruya would naturally come to the Wen Family to make things worse for her as well as to flaunt her elegance and kind-heartedness.In a clash between the two, the Missus of the Wen Family with all her scandals was definitely at a disadvantage. Grandma already liked Xia Ruya to begin with, and now she was going to adore her even more.\u201cGrandpa, Grandma, Fa\u2026 Uncle Wen, Aunt Ning, Xin\u2026 Xinya is here too I see!\u201d Xia Ruya entered the living room anxiously. When she saw Wen Xinya sitting there, all her emotions seemed to be tied down by her presence.Old Madam Wen was elated to see Xia Ruya. She hurriedly stood up from the sofar and went towards Xia Ruya to hold her hands. \u201cRuya, what brought you here?\u201dXia Ruya held Old Madam Wen\u2019s arms with ease and said gently, \u201cGrandma, I saw the news on the newspapers and was worried about you and Grandpa. That\u2019s why I came here especially to see you.\u201dOld Madam Wen thought to herself,that uneducated child who lived on the streets for 15 years can\u2019t be compared to this child who has spent 12 years with us.Ruya had never gotten into any scandals in the many years that she was with the Wen Family.\u201cHow thoughtful, coming to visit me especially for this. Unlike some people who only know how to bring shame to the Wen Family.\u201dXia Ruya\u2019s expression turned awkward for a moment, and she subconsciously cast a glance at Wen Xinya. She hurriedly changed the topic, \u201cGrandma, how have you been?\u201dOld Madam Wen said lovingly, \u201cSame as always. But ever since you\u2019ve left, there is nobody to help me massage my chest, so my chest always feels tight and uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cGrandma, if you don\u2019t mind, I can always visit you in the future to massage your chest,\u201d Xia Ruya continued.Old Madam Wen cried in delight, \u201cThat would be amazing! This way, Grandma can see you often.\u201dOld Mr. Wen glared at Old Madam Wen and said, \u201cRuya is now the daughter of the Xia Family, she needs to stay with her grandfather and grandmother and be filial as well. How can you say that? If word got out, people would accuse us of taking away other people\u2019s daughter.\u201dOld Madam Wen\u2019s expression turned stiff. She was speaking her mind and did not even consider this. \u201cI like Ruya but I can\u2019t even see her often. She was still brought up by my side for 12 years, how can I bear to cut this relationship?\u201dNing Shuqian gave Wen Xinya an obscure look and tried to hold back a smile. \u201cFather, Mother is right. Although Ruya is no longer a child of the Wen Family, the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. This past 12 years of bond can\u2019t be cut so easily.\u201dWen Yuya was even more happy to sit beside Xia Ruya. \u201cSister Ruya has to come here often or I will miss you.\u201dWen Haowen said warmly, \u201cYou have to come to visit your Grandma often, or she won\u2019t stop talking about you every day.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXia Ruya teared up, her crystal-like tears sparkled in her eyes, refusing to drop. \u201cRuya is the one being unfilial. Not coming to visit you for so long, I have failed you, Grandma.\u201dOld Mr. Wen turned to look at Wen Xinya, only to see her sitting quietly by his side, lost in thought at the sight of the loving relationship between the old lady and Ruya. A deep sense of loss could be seen in her eyes.Old Mr. Wen knew that the old lady was very stubborn. There was no hope of her changing her mind towards Xinya since she already disliked her. His heart was filled with remorse towards Xinya as the old lady put her in a difficult spot.Xia Ruya said to Wen Xinya, \u201cXinya, don\u2019t take the news in the newspapers or magazines to heart. The media has always liked to make groundless accusations. After a while, they will stop by themselves.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I just think that if you really are innocent, the truth will prevail. There is no need to waste your efforts on that baseless news.\u201dWow, look at that 180 degrees change in attitude. Wen Xinya put on an act and thought out loud. \u201cI guess you are right. There\u2019s nothing much I can do at this point.\u201dOld Mr. Wen got up from the sofa and ordered., \u201cXinya, help me to the backyard for a walk!\u201dWen Xinya stood up with pleasure and supported him by the arm out of the living room.Wen Xinya looked at the viburnum tree in the backyard. It must have been its blooming season\u2014the white flowers as pure as jade covered the branches fully, giving the viburnum tree a look of elegance and beauty.While taking a walk with Old Mr. Wen, Wen Xinya said, \u201cGrandpa, I\u2019ve sent you the tonic previously. Have you been eating them?\u201dWhen she was asking Du Ruo for tonic remedies, she saw some healthcare remedies and requested for them. She then sent them to Mother Wang for her to help improve Grandpa\u2019s health.Grandpa had very good health. In her past life when she died, he still remained healthy.Old Mr. Wen said with a soft smile, \u201cOld Du\u2019s remedies are really great, and they can\u2019t even be bought by common folks. After you\u2019ve spent so much effort to get them for me, how can this old man here not eat them?\u201dThe tonic created from those remedies did not taste bad, unlike the ones made from remedies passed around in markets with the disgustingly bitter Chinese medicine taste. Furthermore, the tonics were pretty effective. In just half a month of consumption, his sleep was visibly better.Wen Xinya smiled. \u201cI wish Grandpa good health and longevity!\u201dWhen Old Mr. Wen arrived under the viburnum tree, he raised his head to take in the amazing view of the pure white flowers that resembled butterflies gathering around the tree. Slowly, he said, \u201cWhen one is old, he tends to think of the past. Recently, I\u2019ve been recalling your appearance when you were just born.\u201dWen Xinya helped Old Mr. Wen on to the bench under the viburnum tree.Old Mr. Wen was in a daze. He said, \u201cWhen your mother was pregnant with you, it was really tough for her. Her first four months were spent in bed, and she could not swallow meat even after six months. There were many times when she was close to a miscarriage, but your mother was really strong. She fought hard to keep you.\u201dThis was her first time hearing about her mother. Wen Xinya had mixed feelings for a moment. Thinking of the pain her mother had to go through during pregnancy while her father stayed by the side of another woman who was bearing someone else\u2019s child, Wen Xinya harbored a deep resentment towards Wen Haowen for the first time.Old Mr. Wen continued, \u201cYour mother went into labor half a month early. At that time, medical studies were not good enough. Although C-section was available in the country, it was deeply rooted in the minds of the people of Z country that only natural births were acceptable. On top of that, there were stories within the country about deaths resulting from C-sections in the past. Your mother insisted on giving birth to you naturally, and I did nothing to object\u2026\u201dWen Xinya felt a surge of emotions hit her, and tears welled up in her eyes.\u201cThat day at ten in the morning, your Grandma and I personally sent her to the hospital when her water broke. Her stomach was in pain from that afternoon until eight in the morning the next day, and she suffered for a whole 18 hours. In the midst of it, I requested for C-section for her, but the doctors said that your mother\u2019s condition was not suitable for surgery. Her only option was a natural birth. Even while waiting outside, every minute and every second was torture for your Grandma and I. How hard it must\u2019ve been for her to pull through, all the while bearing such excruciating pain and torment.\u201dTears trickled down her face, but Wen Xinya pressed her lips together tight, refusing to let out a single sound.Old Mr. Wen sighed. \u201cYour mother fought hard to give birth to you. Afterward, she went into a critical situation. She was bleeding profusely but nothing could stop it. The doctors wanted to send her to the emergency room, but she refused and insisted on feeding you a mouthful of milk, saying that only after drinking the mother\u2019s breast milk could the child grow up to be healthy. At that time, I watched her hold on to her last breath to breastfeed you in that labor room. After you were done eating, a nurse carried you away as your mother was afraid that the stench on her would be inauspicious for you. I can still remember how you cried until your face went white when the nurse took you away. No matter what, nobody could calm you down, and you cried continuously for over half an hour.\u201dWen Xinya had a sudden flashback of her past life\u2014excessive drinking, fighting, causing trouble, drug abuse, and everybody\u2019s contempt towards her. Recalling the words Ning Shuqian said to her before her death, she was indeed the only blunder of her mother\u2019s life. How can her of the past life face her mother, who fought and sacrificed her life out of the greatest motherly love?In her past life, she let not only herself down, but also her mother!Old Mr. Wen held her hand with wet eyes and continued, \u201cI can still remember that day. After your mother finished feeding you the last mouthful of milk, she grabbed my hand so tightly that her nails dug into my flesh and entrusted you in my care. At that time, I promised her, and even took a vow, but\u2026\u201dWen Xinya sobbed uncontrollably. In the short span of her life, her mother did everything she could and even overcame the impossible.A wave of hatred washed over her. When mom was carrying her, Wen Haowen stayed by the side of another woman. When mom was in difficult labor, where was he? In the sweet arms of Ning Shuqian?Mom, in this life, I will definitely send those two cheating bitches to hell to repent.Old Mr. Wen continued, \u201cYou were so scrawny when you were born. You weighed only 4.2 pounds, and was only this big!\u201d Old Mr. Wen waved two fingers in the air \u2014 that length was only roughly the size of a little rabbit. \u201cYour entire body was very pale and bluish because you stayed in the womb for too long during the difficult labor.\u201dAfter a short pause, Old Mr. Wen said, \u201cAt that time, I overheard the doctors saying that this child had already committed a grave sin and that she would definitely lead a harsh life in the future. I thought then that our Wen Family child was a fortune and everybody would adore her. There was no way she would suffer in life. But\u2026\u201dWen Xinya understood the reason why Grandpa brought up the past today. It meant that he was standing on her side and would support her decisions.Old Mr. Wen changed the subject and asked, \u201cWhat do you think of the scandal this time around?\u201dWen Xinya replied hoarsely, \u201cGrandpa, I was too careless this time and allowed people to make up stories to humiliate the Wen Family. But please, believe me, I will definitely find a reasonable solution.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAre you confident?\u201d Old Mr. Wen asked. He recalled the girl that remained calm and eloquent when facing the interrogations of his son and daughter-in-law alone. She was able to subdue their momentum single-handedly. Only someone with a clear mind would be able to pull off this feat.Wen Xinya nodded. \u201cI still have to come up with a detailed plan, but there should be no problem.\u201dOld Mr. Wen replied plainly, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I will not interfere. Rest assured, I will help you settle everything in the Wen Family.\u201dAll Wen Xinya needed was this confirmation. She was afraid that despite her efforts to fight for the title of the Missus of the Wen Family, the family would have already abandoned her. \u201cThank you, Grandpa. I will not disappoint you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Xinya walked across the living room, nobody acknowledged her except for Mother Wang who asked if she wanted to stay for lunch.Grandpa wanted to make use of their talk today to show his stand and to let her know that he had always been thinking of her. Little did Grandpa know, she no longer cared for it. As such, their talk today did not make her feel any gratitude, but rather it took away the only chain that was tying her to the Wen Family.Someday, she would take back everything that belonged to her.Someday, she would get back everything they owed her and her mother.After stepping out of the old Wen Mansion, she realized that the person waiting at the gates was not Uncle Zhang, but Si Yiyan!Instead of his The Lucifer, he brought a silver grey Cayenne. The car\u2019s smooth lines shimmered under the radiance of the sun, looking luxurious and elegant.After Wen Xinya got into the car, Si Yiyan asked her, \u201cWhat do you want to eat for lunch?\u201dWen Xinya pondered for a while and then replied, \u201cSeafood!\u201dThey drove for over 10 minutes, yet they were getting further away from the destination, even going at high speed.Wen Xinya looked at Si Yiyan unbelievably and cried, \u201cAre you crazy! It takes an hour and a half to drive from the Capital City to Jin City. There\u2019s no need to go so far just to eat seafood! By the time we reach Jin City, I would\u2019ve starved to death.\u201dSi Yiyan smiled and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in going to Jin City to try their seafood, it\u2019s pretty good. Anyway, it\u2019s not like you have anything else to do. There are some snacks on the back seats, help yourself so you won\u2019t be hungry.\u201dAlthough she was rather discontented, she was also craving the seafood at Jin City. After she shot Si Yiyan a glare, she turned to the back seat and took a bag of snacks.Wen Xinya looked into the paper bag and said in surprise, \u201cWow, snacks from Imperial Court! You must have queued for a long time to get these!\u201dSnacks from Imperial Court were all freshly made with a limited amount for sale. There was no guarantee that you could get your hands on them even if you queued. She had always loved eating the snacks from there.\u201cYup! It wasn\u2019t that long!\u201d Si Yiyan said while he watched her eat happily. Her happiness was contagious, making the two hours on the queue worth it.\u201cTry some too! It tastes good.\u201d While eating the snack, she held out a piece to Si Yiyan. He was the one who queued for it, so there was no way she could enjoy it alone.Si Yiyan was driving attentively. He turned his head and took a bite from the snack she was holding. He ate it deliciously and said, \u201cYup! It does taste good.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s face flushed red at his intimate behavior. Before she could pull her hand back, Si Yiyan unexpectedly turned to it and took another bite. Not sure if it was intentional, he nimbly licked her finger. The damp, numb and ticklish feeling felt as if she was shocked by electricity, and she withdrew her hand subconsciously.Wen Xinya\u2019s heart went pit-a-pat uncontrollably. She was prepared to scold him, but when she turned toward him, she saw that he was focused on driving as if he did not notice anything from just now.She hung her head in embarrassment, her words stuck in her throat, unable to say anything.\u201cWhy did you stop eating? If you are thirsty, there\u2019s also fruit tea from Imperial Court in the bag.\u201d Si Yiyan turned to look at her, his eyes shining brightly.Wen Xinya came back to her senses and said instinctively, \u201cThere are some crumbs on your mouth.\u201dSi Yiyan frowned and said, \u201cHelp me wipe with a tissue! It\u2019s not convenient for me since I\u2019m driving.\u201d\u201cHere!\u201d Wen Xinya reached out for the tissue box at the front and passed a piece to him.To her surprise, Si Yiyan suddenly reached out with his hand and grabbed her.\u201cWhat are you doing, didn\u2019t you say it\u2019s not convenient since you are driving?\u201d Wen Xinya blinked twice. His hand held her wrist with just enough strength that it did not hurt her, yet she could not struggle away.\u201cYea, it is not convenient, so help me wipe!\u201d Si Yiyan smirked and moved his head towards her hand, wiping his lips while moving her hand.\u201cHey! Stop messing around, Si Yiyan. Focus on driving\u2026\u201d Wen Xinya saw that he had one hand on the steering wheel but he was not even looking at the road. As the car continued to move at high speed, she felt her life being threatened and quickly cautioned him to pay attention to the road.Si Yiyan continued leaning towards her with his head slightly turned. There was a gleam in his eyes as he looked at her, his expression as bright as rubus flowers in full bloom.\u201cFine! I\u2026 Will\u2026 Help\u2026 You!\u201d Wen Xinya spurted out with her teeth clenched, and glared at Si Yiyan, fuming with anger. For the sake of her life, she had no choice but to wipe away the crumbs on his lips for him.Si Yiyan smiled beamingly at her pouting face. The sun\u2019s rays shone on her face through the window and dust particles danced in the transparent light. She looked as beautiful as a jade shining brightly.\u201cI\u2019ve finished wiping. What else do you want?\u201d Wen Xinya stared out of the window into the road moving at high speed. She felt all sorts of complicated emotions\u2014panic, dread, and fear could be seen in her eyes. Despite her struggles, he held on tightly to her hand. The anger on her face further amplified her majestic beauty.Si Yiyan replied in a low voice with a glint in his eyes, \u201cI want\u2026\u201d Si Yiyan suddenly pulled her and Wen Xinya landed right on top of his body. He then bent down and sucked on her lips before saying, \u201cThis!\u201dWen Xinya shouted in fury, \u201cSi Yiyan, are you crazy! Let me go now and focus on driving. Do you know how dangerous it is to drive recklessly at high speed? I don\u2019t want to lose my life here.\u201d\u201cRelax, I definitely won\u2019t let you die before me.\u201d Si Yiyan looked at her without a care for his life. He landed a small kiss on her face with faint desire, and eventually could not resist going for her lips.Strangely, Wen Xinya\u2019s rage melted away like snow, leaving her feeling vexed. \u201cSi Yiyan, I\u2019m begging you, can you focus on driving? If we really do get into an accident, who knows what sort of crazy scandals the newspapers and magazines would publish. You don\u2019t want that too, right?\u201d\u201cI do! Dying under a peony, I\u2019ll be happy even as a ghost!\u201d Si Yiyan grinned.

This Cayenne model has a very high-end auto-pilot driving mode so\u2026 there is absolutely no danger!\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes flew wide open and her delicate face turned red.

Many tourists wandered along the shores, buying seafood directly from the fishermen on board of the boats. The fishes were still alive and kicking, and the shellfish were all freshly caught. Wen Xinya watched in astonishment at the scene in front of her.Wen Xinya excitedly said, \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was still a place like this in Jin City.\u201dSi Yiyan replied, \u201cNot only are the seafood here fresh, but the fishermen also have their own recipe for cooking them which cannot be found anywhere else. The government is preparing to develop tourism at this location.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and try the seafood here.\u201d Wen Xinya was feeling hungry. She did not eat much of the snacks in the car earlier since she was saving her stomach for lunch.\u201cOkay!\u201d Holding her hand, Si Yiyan led Wen Xinya to an old-looking but huge fishing boat by the port. He jumped on board the boat and held his hand out to Wen Xinya who was standing on the shore.Wen Xinya looked at the hand in front of her\u2014thin calluses covered it, and the ones on the thumb and index finger were slightly thicker. Her heart shrank a little. Only people who used guns often would have hands with thicker calluses on these positions.Si Yiyan waved his hand and said, \u201cGive me your hand! I\u2019ll support you up to the boat since you are wearing high heels.\u201dWen Xinya pulled back from being lost in thought and placed her hand on Si Yiyan\u2019s. His palm was huge, almost wrapping her entire hand in it. It was also really dry and slightly hot. She felt as if her entire heart was heating up from being held by his hand.With a tug, Si Yiyan pulled her up onto the boat. The boat started to rock and she staggered along with the swaying motion. Si Yiyan wrapped an arm around her waist and pressed her against his chest.Wen Xinya subconsciously put up a struggle and took in a deep breath. The salty and humid air of the beach mixed with the stench of fish made her feel a little uncomfortable. After she greedily inhaled the fresh bamboo-like scent on his body, she felt better.\u201cDo you get seasick?\u201d Si Yiyan thought of this question out of a sudden. He blamed himself in his heart for being so careless to forget such an important thing.Wen Xinya pondered for a moment before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I won\u2019t get seasick from riding a yacht.\u201dIn her past life, she did not get seasick from riding yachts. However, she did not know if these types of boats would affect seasickness.\u201cThat\u2019s great! The sun is still pretty hot outside, let\u2019s go into the cabin.\u201d With a smile on his face, Si Yiyan slightly embraced Wen Xinya and supported her on the fishing boat.\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019m on a boat like this, it feels so new. It would be much better though if the boat didn\u2019t rock so much!\u201d The boat kept swaying from time to time and, it being her first time on something like this, Wen Xinya could not adapt to it. She could not stand steadily and had to lean on Si Yiyan, allowing him to embrace her.\u201cSince you just got on board, it will be a little hard to adapt. It will be better after a while!\u201d Si Yiyan brought her into the cabin. Although the cabin was a little old, it was spick and span.Wen Xinya sat on a stool beside the table in the cabin. Once her butt touched a solid surface, she felt much better than before. Whenever the boat rocked, she also felt much more secure.\u201cThe seafood that the lady boss on this boat cooks is the best in this town,\u201d Si Yiyan introduced the famous seafood place to Wen Xinya after they sat down.Just then, the lady boss wearing a blue-printed cotton shirt came over with a warm smile and said, \u201cNinth Master, the dishes are ready. Should I serve them now?\u201dThe lady boss\u2019 gaze naturally landed on Wen Xinya gently, yet it felt as if she was sizing her up.Si Yiyan replied, \u201cServe them!\u201dJust as the lady boss was preparing to leave, Wen Xinya turned to Si Yiyan and said with a wide grin, \u201cMay is the best time to eat oysters! Add a portion of lemon oysters to his order.\u201dThe lady boss looked over to Si Yiyan with an even brighter smile on her face.Si Yiyan gave Wen Xinya a quick doting glance. This rascal was scheming to take revenge for him making moves on her in the car just now.After the lady boss left, Wen Xinya looked at Si Yiyan with a forced smile and said, \u201cI heard oyster is a treasure for man\u2019s kidneys. It will nourish the kidney and support Yang energy. It\u2019s said that there is a small town in France where the men have to eat an oyster practically every morning. According to statistics, the men in the town are all very energetic and the wives all live a harmonious life. The male sex function can last until an average of 70 years old and above.\u201dSi Yiyan watched her speak with a straight face and could not help but laugh. \u201cAre you reminding me to reserve my energy?\u201d He slowly approached her ear and said with a soft laugh, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will definitely follow your suggestion in the future and eat an oyster every morning. I\u2019ll reserve my energy and strength for the sake of our future\u2026 life.\u201dSi Yiyan\u2019s soft laughter was like the sound from a Chinese zither, the Guzheng. It was sweet and sentimental, with a certain charm to it. Although he omitted it and did not say a word in between, Wen Xinya could guess that he was referring to the word \u201cMarriage\u201d. Her face turned beet red in a flash. Not only did she fail to tease him, but he also turned it around and used it against her. This sort of feeling was embarrassing indeed.\u201cOyster nourishes Yin and blood, eating more will benefit your body.\u201d Although teasing this rascal was really fun, Si Yiyan decided not to be too greedy.Wen Xinya changed the topic hurriedly. \u201cHave you been here before? The lady boss seems to be close to you.\u201dSi Yiyan explained happily. \u201cMy mother loves seafood. When I was young, my father brought me here a few times before.\u201dAt this moment, the lady boss served the dishes. Wen Xinya looked at the food on the table-popcorn clam, spicy stir-fried crab, grilled big prawns with garlic, smoked salmon\u2026 All sorts of seafood that looked, smelled and tasted good. She was so in awe that she almost forgot to blink.\u201cDon\u2019t just stare, hurry and eat!\u201d Si Yiyan took a prawn and carefully peeled it.Wen Xinya immediately took up a pair of chopsticks and stuffed her mouth with a slice of salmon. \u201cThe meat is fresh and tender and has such a smooth texture. This is tastier than the ones in a five-star hotel.\u201dSi Yiyan peeled two prawns and dipped them in the sauce before placing them on the plate in front of Wen Xinya. Afterward, he took a crab and started peeling it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya accepted it straight away.The lady boss continued to serve a few more dishes. Wen Xinya frowned and cried out, \u201cSi Yiyan, just how much did you order! How can the two of us finish all of these?\u201dSi Yiyan explained, \u201cThe seafood here is great, and since there are very few opportunities to come here, I\u2019ve ordered a little of everything for you to try. If you cannot finish, just leave it. It\u2019s best for you to just enjoy the food.\u201dWen Xinya furrowed her brows and said, \u201cSi Yiyan, I heard that wasting food in army camps will get you punished.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was once when I picked up a packet of leftovers in a rubbish bin outside a restaurant. The restaurant owner came chasing after me and called me a rascal. Those leftovers were meant for pigs. Nevertheless, when I was about to gobble the food, a beggar came from nowhere and snatched it away from me. I was so devastated that I cried my heart out.\u201dSi Yiyan remained silent. He already knew about Wen Xinya\u2019s past. But he had a different feeling when hearing from her own mouth.It seemed like she suddenly realized she had brought up a serious topic. Wen Xinya digressed. \u201cHow about you? What was your childhood like?\u201dSi Yiyan thought for a few moments and then started recollecting his past. \u201cI was a spoiled and timid kid. I would just cry whenever I suffered setbacks. Crying also allowed me to get what I wanted easily. Father was always angry with me, but Mother thought that was fine. At least I would not get into any trouble.\u201dFather was a pessimist. With a character like that, the large family business became a burden to him. Even his colleagues and the pioneers of the company disapproved of him. If his parents had not passed away, he would probably grow up living the life his mother had wished for him\u2014a simple and ordinary life!Like what his mother said, he was just an ordinary boy. That was the reason the elder pioneers of the company spared him. And his father\u2019s allies had a chance to bring him back to the mainland.Wen Xinya was surprised to hear that. Looking at the present day Si Yiyan, she was unable to associate him to this younger version he described. But subconsciously, she knew he did not lie to her.What must a man go through in life in order to transform his weakened self and become the cold and ruthless person of today?It reminded her of herself. She had experienced life and death, and also an opportunity at rebirth before she became a whole new Wen Xinya.What about him? What exactly had he gone through?Right at this moment, the lady boss brought them a plate of steamed mussels. Wen Xinya took one from the plate and gently pried it open. She said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that this type of mussel can produce pearls in them. I wonder if that\u2019s true.\u201dSi Yiyan laughed. \u201cChances are slim. Only old mussels produce pearls. There are many fishermen fishing around this area all year round. It\u2019s unlikely there\u2019s any old mussel remaining.\u201dThe mussel opened. As expected, there was no pearl inside. She consecutively opened a few but there were still no pearls.Although Wen Xinya was disappointed, it did not affect her appetite.Si Yiyan removed the shells of the seafood for her and she ate heartily.Shortly after, the oysters were served. Wen Xinya was not sure if she should be delighted. Si Yiyan opened one of the oyster shells calmly with a small knife.Wen Xinya stared at Si Yiyan. \u201cI\u2019ve heard there\u2019s a certain method to consume oysters. After opening the shell, suck it into your mouth in one action.\u201dUnder Wen Xinya\u2019s watchful eyes, Si Yiyan calmly took an oyster and sucked into his mouth in one action.It was a public consensus that the action of eating oysters made one look unrefined. Many people even associated the consumption of oysters as a vulgar act. That was why not many people would eat oysters in public. Si Yiyan was able to do it elegantly. Wen Xinya almost felt that it was a pleasure to watch him eat. She had initially wanted to make him look bad, but she had learned an important lesson through this incident\u2014though oyster-eating was considered an unrefined activity, it mattered more on the person who was eating.\u201cIt tastes good. You should try it.\u201d Si Yiyan opened another oyster and placed it on Wen Xinya\u2019s plate.\u201cHmm. I am not going to eat it. It\u2019s too disgusting.\u201d Wen Xinya placed the oyster back on Si Yiyan\u2019s plate. She knew that she would not be able to eat it as elegantly as Si Yiyan, so she decided not to give him a chance to ridicule her.Si Yiyan smiled and put it back on Wen Xinya\u2019s plate. \u201cBe good, try it. You might find it to be a pleasant surprise!\u201dWen Xinya was intrigued and asked curiously, \u201cWhat type of pleasant surprise?\u201dSi Yiyan continued coaxing her in a low voice. \u201cTry it and you will find out!\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Wen Xinya looked at him with doubt. She had a feeling that he was just out to trick her.Si Yiyan burst out laughing. \u201cReally! Nothing could be closer to the truth!\u201dCuriosity killed the cat. Right at this moment, Wen Xinya was that cat. She hardened her heart, took a deep breath, and then put the oyster to her lips and sucked it in one action.Si Yiyan watched her eat and noticed the expression on her face as if she was being tortured. He then teased her. \u201cIt\u2019s just an oyster. Do you need to put on an expression that looks like you are being tortured?\u201dWen Xinya shut her eyes. To her surprise, by sucking the oyster in one action, the raw, fishy taste was neutralized by the sour taste in the lemon. It felt fresh and tender in her mouth. Indeed, it tasted good.After a while, Wen Xinya felt something in her mouth. She took a piece of the serviette and spat it out gently. She looked and noticed it was a piece of half flattened, semi-round shaped and lusterless pearl.Wen Xinya opened her eyes wide and took the pearl in her hand. She exclaimed in excitement. \u201cAh! There\u2019s really a pearl in there!\u201dSi Yiyan looked at her. She had excitement and sparkles in her eyes. \u201cYou are very lucky,\u201d he said.Wen Xinya looked at the pearl in her hand as if she had uncovered a treasure. \u201cSi Yiyan, how did you know that there was a pearl in this oyster?\u201d she asked.He never examined the oyster. How could he have known that there would be a pearl in it? He could not possibly be able to predict the future, could he?Si Yiyan replied with a smile, \u201cYou may assume that I am a prophet!\u201dWen Xinya stared at him. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that. Quick, tell me the truth.\u201dSi Yiyan held an oyster\u2019s shell and showed it to Wen Xinya. \u201cLook at this shell. Do you see a missing portion? From a glance, we could tell that this portion was missing for a long time ago. This shows that this oyster was injured.\u201dWen Xinya asked with confusion, \u201cWhat does the pearl have to do with the oyster\u2019s injury?\u201dSi Yiyan explained, \u201cAn oyster that was never injured would never be able to produce a pearl. Pearls are the products from a healing process. The entire process starts when a grain of sand enters the oyster. It will secrete a mineral called nacre from within to coat the foreign substance\u2014a grain of sand\u2014with multiple layers. Over time, a beautiful pearl will be formed. A pearl is a by-product of suffering. After it has gone through a long period of this polishing process, a beautiful pearl will be formed.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was a hidden meaning behind Si Yiyan\u2019s words. In his eyes, she was a pearl. One that had been through years of suffering and experiences in life that allowed her to grow, thus becoming a pearl in the process. Although there was still room for improvement, he knew that she would one day be able to glow in her own success.Wen Xinya was observing the pearl carefully. She suddenly felt that the pearl was very precious. \u201cCompared to the process of a butterfly\u2019s molting, the process of a pearl\u2019s formation that requires a long period of time is even more remarkable.\u201d She turned to Si Yiyan abruptly and said, \u201cSi Yiyan, do you believe that someday I will be glowing in success just like a pearl?\u201d\u201cI have never doubted it,\u201d he replied with a smile. He watched her in silence for a while before saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a beautiful story in this town\u2014anyone who eats an oyster with a pearl in it is a lucky person. They will be blessed with good fortune.\u201dWen Xinya laughed. \u201cWhat a story! But I like it. This pearl shall be my lucky charm from now on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She thought the food was too much for them to finish, but with the help of Si Yiyan, they managed to finish most of them.After a sumptuous meal, Si Yiyan took her around the small town for a walk. The shops in the town were mainly selling seafood products and there were many specialty seafood restaurants around. With so much good food around, Wen Xinya rubbed her little round belly. She could only look at them and sigh.Soon afterward, they entered into a souvenir shop. There were many ornaments made from sea products. A wind chime made from different seashells caught her attention. As the gentle breeze blew, the seashells swayed and produced a clear, soothing sound.Si Yiyan could see that she liked it a lot and bought it for her as a gift.At evening time, Si Yiyan brought her to another specialty seafood restaurant. Wen Xinya had an enjoyable dinner.By the time they returned to the Mo bungalow, it was already 9:30 pm.The next day, Wen Xinya\u2019s scandal intensified. Pictures of her roaming the streets were published in newspapers and magazines. Some of these pictures showed her fighting and creating scenes in public before she returned to the Wen Family. Some even showed her hanging out in bars with her gangster friends and getting drunk. It was probably because the Wen Family had not done anything thus far. And the main character of these stories, Wen Xinya, did not stand up in public to clarify matters for herself. That was why the newspaper and magazines became even more presumptuous.Wen Xinya kept a few articles and magazines and Mother He burned the rest in the kitchen.On the third day, the articles got even more ridiculous. It even said that she ate psychoactive drugs to enliven the mood.When this was published in the news, the shares of the Wen Corporation were affected. Shareholders were desperate to sell their shares. Within a day, the shares of the Wen Corporation dropped drastically by 200 points. It was reported that the shares were still on a downward trend.On the fourth day, the media shifted their focus from Wen Xinya\u2019s scandal and reported news related to the drop in the Wen Corporation\u2019s shares. Early that morning, reporters swarmed to the lobby of Wen Haowen\u2019s office, waiting to interview him.Though Wen Haowen detested Wen Xinya, he avoided answering any questions from the media when discussing the news of her scandals.On the fifth day, the media exposed the old scandals of the Wen Family. It was reported that Wen Haowen had an affair with the current Madam Wen Ning Shuqian, while his wife Mo Yunyao was pregnant. There was even a photograph showing Wen Haowen accompanying Ning Shuqian for a pregnancy check-up on the day Mo Yunyao was in labor. The reports revealed that Wen Yuya was Wen Haowen\u2019s illegitimate daughter.When the photograph appeared in the news, it created a public uproar. Shareholders denounced Wen Haowen and Ning Shuqian, causing the shares of the Wen Corporation to drop even further.Wen Xinya turned pale when she saw the picture of Wen Haowen and Ning Shuqian at a pregnancy check on the magazine. Ironically, Ning Shuqian visited the same hospital where Mo Yunyao delivered. She had already gotten the help of professionals to verify the authenticity of the photograph!Wen Xinya tore up the magazine in a rage. She bellowed, \u201cWorse than a beast!\u201dNing Shuqian was indeed despicable. She was even willing to give up her own reputation to instigate the Wen Family to abandon her.Wen Haowen valued fame and reputation but he had no responsibility. When this photograph was published, he insisted it was Wen Xinya\u2019s fault. This all started from her scandal. He was embarrassed and was unable to face the media anymore.Therefore he would not hesitate to pin her down.At the same time, Wen Haowen was surrounded by reporters at the lobby of the Wen Corporation\u2019s building. When he managed to get past the reporters, he quickly got his assistant to arrange for an emergency shareholder\u2019s meeting.The objective of this meeting was to find a solution to stop the fall of their shares that was caused by Wen Xinya\u2019s scandal.During the meeting, they concluded the best solution was to send Wen Xinya abroad. The shareholders would try to convince Old Mr. Wen of this decision.After achieving his goal, Wen Haowen left the company and returned home.Back at the Wen Family\u2019s mansion, Xia Ruya was sitting beside Old Mrs. Wen. She started blaming herself. \u201cGrandma, I didn\u2019t expect for Xinya\u2019s scandal to escalate. I thought it would halt after a while and therefore advised Xinya to not take any actions. Little did I expect the situation to get so out of control. It\u2019s all my fault, Grandma. If not for my suggestion\u2026\u201dOld Mrs. Wen held her hand tightly. She commented angrily. \u201cThis is not your fault! It was all because of Wen Xinya, that jinx who got us into this trouble. From the moment she was born and caused her mother\u2019s death, I knew it was a bad omen. Initially, I had not agreed to let her return to the Wen Family even though we found her. She is indeed a curse. She caused so much unrest in the family just a few days after returning.\u201dXia Ruya patted Grandma\u2019s shoulder and consoled her. \u201cGrandma, please calm down and do not get agitated. Please take care of your health. What matters most right now is to find a solution.\u201dOld Mrs. Wen turned pale and looked displeased. \u201cWhat can we do? Let\u2019s just send her abroad to bring this matter to a close.\u201dOld Mr. Wen was hopping mad. He gave Old Mrs. Wen a hard stare and said, \u201cYou must have been blinded and cannot think appropriately. Your words are absurd!\u201dOld Mrs. Wen was startled to see Old Mr. Wen getting so agitated. She did not dare comment further.\u201cRuya, the Wen Family has been troubled lately. You\u2019d better stop visiting us. Your Grandma is not one who thinks carefully before she speaks. Do not spread her words lest it causes more trouble. You have already returned to the Xia family. It is unreasonable for you to keep coming back to the Wen Family. It would also make Xinya feel uncomfortable,\u201d said Old Mr. Wen while locking his vision on her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXia Ruya used to be the granddaughter he doted on the most. Even when Wen Xinya returned to the Wen Family, he disregarded Xinya\u2019s feelings and continued to love her as if she was his granddaughter.When did his love start to waver towards Xinya? Maybe it was that fateful day under the viburnum tree when Xinya voiced her grievances to him. At that moment, it dawned on him that only a relationship bounded by blood ties could never be severed.Thereafter, his attitude towards Xia Ruya turned cold. When their relationship weakened, he started to see Xia Ruya in a different light. He gradually saw the scheming and deceptive side of her as he recalled all the unfortunate incidents that happened soon after Xinya\u2019s return. In the recent episode of Xinya\u2019s news scandal, Ruya had been coming to the Wen Family\u2019s mansion every day and tried to influence Grandma\u2019s emotions. He started to detect her ulterior motives.Xia Ruya was shocked with her eyes wide open. Tears welled up in her eyes. She looked weak and pitiful. \u201cGrandpa\u2026 are you forsaking me? I may not be a biological child of the Wen Family, but I have grown up by your side for the past twelve years.

Did Wen Xinya said anything to you? I knew she was a curse to the family. What did Ruya do to offend her? Just because she didn\u2019t like Ruya doesn\u2019t mean that Ruya cannot come to the Wen family to visit us. Who does she think she is?\u201d\u201cXinya did not speak ill of anyone in front of me. Even if she had voiced out her unhappiness to me, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Old Mr. Wen took a deep breath and gave Xia Ruya a glance. Her words seemed harmless, but she spoke with a hidden purpose. Well, it made Old Mrs. Wen think that Xinya spoke ill of her in front of Grandpa.Xia Ruya was lost at Old Mr. Wen\u2019s stare. She subconsciously lowered her head and said, \u201cGrandpa\u2026 I understand. You\u2019ve found your biological granddaughter and do not need me anymore. I\u2026 I understand. I\u2019ll visit the Wen Family less frequently and not make Xinya unhappy. I\u2026 only wish to see Grandma more often. Grandma\u2026 has always loved me dearly.\u201dIf Wen Xinya was present, she would have looked at Xia Ruya as a really shameless person. Old Mr. Wen had already made it clear to her and she still said she would visit the Wen Family less frequently\u2026Indeed, when Xia Ruya had just completed her sentence, Old Mrs. Wen immediately continued, \u201cI don\u2019t agree. Ruya has grown up by my side for the past 12 years. Even if you don\u2019t want her, I still her. What right does Wen Xinya have to be unhappy about Ruya coming to visit me? As the Grandma in the family, do I have to act according to Wen Xinya\u2019s wishes?\u201dOld Mr. Wen realized that whenever Xia Ruya was present, he could not get his message across. Whatever he said, Xia Ruya would always refer to Xinya, thus deepening Old Mrs. Wen unhappiness towards Xinya. He did not bother to insist on his point further. \u201cI\u2019m not forbidding her of visiting us, I only said she should come less frequently. You\u2019re aware of the recent scandal in our family. Who knows, Ruya might be an innocent party to be dragged into the whole episode?\u201d he said.His words finally knocked some sense into Old Mrs. Wen. She agreed and also started to advise Xia Ruya to come to the Wen Family\u2019s mansion less frequently. Xia Ruya became speechless and could not defend herself any further.Ning Shuqian was the mastermind behind the entire scandal incident. She was the one who manipulated the string of events and therefore would not get Xia Ruya involved. Xia Ruya had initially wanted to make good use of this opportunity to get into the good books of the two elderly. Once the Wen Family abandoned Wen Xinya, they would start to think about her who had grown up by their side for the past 12 years. Looking at the current situation, her plans did not seem to have worked.Xia Ruya left the Wen Family\u2019s mansion with unsettled emotions.As the phone rang, Old Mr. Wen answered it. It was a call from Wen Corporation\u2019s shareholders. The majority of these senior shareholders were the pioneers of the company. They had a very close relationship with Old Mr. Wen.\u201cOld Wen, I don\u2019t have any bad intentions. You have taken great efforts and finally found the only heir to the Wen Family. I\u2019m certainly happy for you as a friend. Pardon my frankness but, with such an unfilial granddaughter with such an unglamorous past, she will bring a negative impact to your family from now onwards! I know kinship matters to you. Why don\u2019t you just provide some financial support to her and fulfill your duties as a grandparent? Do not let her harm the reputation of the Wen Corporation which you\u2019ve built spending your life\u2019s effort. It took a great deal for us to make the corporation the great success of today. How can you bear to let it suffer? I suggest that you send her abroad, it will\u2026\u201d\u201cOld Zhang, Xinya is only 15-years-old; she\u2019s still a young kid. And kids can be rebellious at times. There\u2019s a famous saying\u2014the gem cannot be polished without friction, nor man perfected without trials. Furthermore, she is my biological granddaughter. If I send her abroad, the media will again make a story out of it, saying that the Wen Family chose to abandon kinship over the benefit of our corporation.\u201d He was clear-minded and was aware that it must have been an act by his son, instigating the shareholders to persuade him.Wen Haowen got home in a rush. He saw Old Mr. Wen and immediately informed. \u201cFather, I have already secured an air ticket for Xinya to the United States this afternoon. I\u2019ve also gotten her passport ready.\u201dOld Mr. Wen hung up and stared at him plainly. \u201cWho said we are sending Xinya abroad?\u201dWen Haowen looked at Old Mr. Wen with disbelief. \u201cFather, Xinya\u2019s scandal has already escalated to a state beyond our control. Why are you still protecting her? Do you know how much the share price of the Wen Corporation has dropped? If this continues, we will suffer even greater losses. The Board of Directors and the shareholders are all in agreement to send Xinya abroad. Please do not be stubborn and continue to disregard the Wen Corporation\u2019s reputation and shareholders\u2019 interests.\u201dOld Mr. Wen took a sip of tea and replied, \u201cThe reason the share price took a dive was all because of the news between you and Ning Shuqian. Before that, the share price dropped but the shareholders\u2019 interests were not affected.\u201dWen Haowen turned pale. He said in frustration, \u201cFather, it all started from Xinya\u2019s scandal. If it wasn\u2019t for her, why would the media dug into our past?\u201d\u201cIf you did not have a disgraceful history, there would be nothing the media could do.\u201d Old Mr. Wen raised his head and looked at him with disappointment. He was already aware of how incompetent his son was. Previously it was because of his wife\u2019s suggestions and ideas that helped him succeed within the Wen Corporation and thus become the Chairman of the Wen Corporation. Little did he expect him to become so irresponsible and shift all the blame to his own daughter.Wen Haowen turned pale and was speechless for a while. He then looked at Old Mr. Wen and said, \u201cFather, no matter what you say, I am definitely going to send Xinya abroad.\u201dOld Mr. Wen shook his hands. \u201cSince you\u2019ve already made up your mind, I shan\u2019t stop you.

This made Old Mr. Wen even more disappointed. If he did not have a sense of guilt or shame, why would he be afraid to face his Father-in-law? Old Mr. Wen stood firm on his grounds and said, \u201cI have never wanted to send Xinya abroad. Since it\u2019s your decision, you should settle it on your own.\u201dWen Haowen started speaking in a softer tone. \u201cFather, my Father-in-law has always blamed me for Yunyao\u2019s death. He will definitely not want to see me. Please just help me once!\u201dOld Mr. Wen was agitated at the mention of Mo Yunyao. \u201cHow could Yunyao\u2019s death have nothing to do with you? It was because she found out about your affair with Ning Shuqian that it traumatized her and she had to deliver two weeks earlier!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Haowen was guilty. He tried redirecting the topic of the conversation and replied in anger, \u201cFather, you\u2019re being selfish. You\u2019re disregarding the corporation\u2019s and the shareholders\u2019 interests.\u201dOld Mr. Wen stood up and said before going to the second floor, \u201cWen Xinya alone is not able to harm the Wen Family\u2019s or the corporation\u2019s interests.\u201dWen Haowen kicked the tea table with rage. \u201cWen Xinya, Wen Xinya, do you think I\u2019m unaware of your intention to groom her into the Wen Family\u2019s heir?

Just by looking at the bar\u2019s exterior, one would not know there were other ongoing vice activities inside, including prostitution, gambling, and drugs. One must have insider connections to be able to access them. This was no longer a secret in the Capital city. However, people refrained from talking about it, largely due to its mysterious background.A car stopped over at the basement level four carpark of Black Sunday. As the door opened, Gu Junlin got out of the car from the driver\u2019s seat. He went over to the passenger seat and opened the door for Wen Xinya. \u201cWe have arrived,\u201d he said.\u201cThank you!\u201d Wen Xinya said with a smile and got out of the car.The Gu Family was an affluent family within the Capital city. It was said that the family had good connections with the National Security Department. Therefore, they were well respected by both the government and underworld figures. Gu Junlin had rendered a tremendous help to Wen Xinya for her plans this time.Wen Xinya had realized the importance of being well connected in society. Connections to the right people would be the deciding factor for her victory.Gu Junlin brought Wen Xinya into the Black Sunday through another entrance, leading them directly to a secret Surveillance Room in the bar.Xu Zhenyu and Han Mofeng were sitting in the room watching the surveillance screen.Wen Xinya passed the desserts made by Mother He over to them. \u201cThe desserts made by Mother He are the best. This is the reward for your hard work.\u201dXu Zhenyu always liked desserts. Looking at the desserts, his eyes gleamed. \u201cXinya, you know me best.\u201dHaving known him for two lifetimes, how could Wen Xinya not know what he liked. She turned over and looked at Han Mofeng. \u201cWhat is the situation?\u201d she asked.Han Mofeng signaled her to look at the surveillance screen. He said, \u201cWe are near to deployment. Under our setup, he borrowed some money from the illegal money-lenders yesterday and seems like he\u2019s going to lose it all again.\u201dWen Xinya looked at the screen. It showed a wretched man around his 40s. This was the Chief Editor of Heavenbright Press Media\u2014Yang Chongguang.From the information Si Yiyan provided her, it showed that Yang Chongguang was an addictive gambler. So she discussed with Xu Zhenyu and together they set up this trap. Xu Zhenyu was very well-connected and very quickly was able to lure Yang Chongguang into the trap by getting him to gamble at the Black Sunday through his connections.The Gu Family also had connections to the owners of the Black Sunday. Therefore, Gu Junlin was able to help them arrange this setup. For the first two days, Yang Chongguang was on a lucky strike and won almost ten million dollars. It was a common characteristic in gamblers\u2014winning was never enough for them and they would want more. Moreover, Xu-er had arranged someone to instigate him to return for more. Therefore, Yang Chongguang got addicted very quickly. From the third day onwards, he started getting unlucky but his losses were minimal. On the fourth day, he had lost it all.Yang Chongguang had lost a huge some of his own money, plus the original amount he had won initially. How could he give it up? Under the encouragement from that person whom Xu-er had arranged, Yang Chongguang became hot-headed and started borrowing from illegal money-lenders. By now, he had lost more than what he could afford to pay.Sweat was all over his face. He could not sit still and kept fidgeting in his chair. He was struggling to keep his eyes open as he had spent a few sleepless nights on the gambling table, trying to focus his attention on the cards in the croupier\u2019s hands.The croupier was distributing cards to the players.Yang Chongguang got excited and leaned forward on the gambling table, holding the three cards in front of him tightly. He slowly flipped the first card by its corner and revealed an Ace card. The sheepish eyes started to gleam with enthusiasm.Suddenly, he realized he was giving away through his excitement and consciously peeped at his opponent who was sitting at the opposite end. Then, he acted to keep himself expressionless. However, his trembling hands could not cover up his nervousness.Yang Chongguang slowly flipped and looked at the second card. When he saw that it was a Three, he almost jumped from his chair in exhilaration. He quickly placed the card face down.He started leaning back against his chair and kept wiping the sweat on his face with a handkerchief. Deep inside, he was screaming: Two. The last card must be a Two. It must be a Two\u2026Yang Chongguang flipped the last card with his hands still trembling. When he saw that the last card was a Two, he threw the cards in his hands to the middle of the table with elation. He laughed loudly and exclaimed, \u201cI have Three straights. Haha. You\u2019ve lost!\u201dHis opponent turned his cards over calmly and placed them in the middle of the table. \u201cI have Three straights too. My apologies, the points on my cards were slightly bigger than yours,\u201d he said.Yang Chongguang stared at him with disbelief. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. How could your cards triumph over mine?\u201dThe man signaled for him to look at the cards on the table.Yang Chongguang subconsciously turned to look at his opponent\u2019s cards on the table. It was indeed Three straights\u2014a Two, a Three and a Four, which triumphed over Yang Chongguang\u2019s cards. He fell back onto his chair in despair. \u201cIt\u2019s over. I lost it all. Over. Everything\u2019s over\u2026\u201dWen Xinya looked at Gu Junlin and raised her thumb. \u201cThe conman you found is indeed formidable. The amount he wins or loses is all under my control. This conman can accurately perform according to my requests.\u201d\u201cThese are professional conmen trained by the casino.\u201d Gu Junlin glanced at the surveillance camera monitor as he spoke.Wen Xinya opened her eyes wide in surprise. She was obviously not familiar with the operations of the casino behind the scenes and was shocked by Gu Junlin\u2019s words. \u201cDoes that mean the casino has been cheating?\u201dGu Junlin raised his almond-shaped eyes and replied in a low, suggestive tone, \u201cThe casino will not interfere if someone wins money within its set limit. However, it will not allow anyone to step beyond its boundary. A casino is a business that will never operate at a loss. It\u2019s an unspoken rule in the industry. Therefore, a little gambling is delightful, but heavy gambling might cause serious injuries.\u201dWen Xinya totally agreed. \u201cThere are rules and boundaries for every industry.\u201dHearing her words, Gu Junlin smiled and took a packet of cigarettes from his bag. He put a stick of cigarette in his mouth and then took a box of special-made matchsticks to light up his cigarette. A bluish flame appeared on the end of the matchstick, seemingly from the dark world.The bluish flame brightened up before him, highlighting the contours of his face. He had such a perfect profile and beautiful features with a slight devilish charm. He was a sexy boy and had the exact characteristics of an evildoer!Xu Zhenyu looked evil too. But in comparison with Gu Junlin, he was miles behind!Gu Junlin seemed to notice her observing him. He smiled at her and raised his eyebrow flirtishly in response.Facing his flirtatious response, Wen Xinya, who had a soul of a 25-year-old, was able to withstand the seduction from this bad boy. She just glanced back at him plainly and knocked gently on the table. \u201cGive a call to the illegal money-lenders and get them to start collecting debt from Yang Chongguang. Tell them to use some vicious methods on him. The objective is to make him so frightened that he gets nightmares in his sleep. Oh yes, do arrange for someone to monitor his activities so that he cannot escape.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHan Mofeng nodded.Wen Xinya turned to look at Xu Zhenyu and said, \u201cArrange for someone to instigate Yang Chongguang at a suitable timing and encourage him to borrow money from Ning Shuqian with some threats. When a person is pushed to a corner, he will not have any sense of morale. Moreover, he is just an addicted gambler with no integrity. We must get ahold of photographic evidence to show the relationship between Ning Shuqian and Yang Chongguang.\u201dShe had done all this work to get to the mastermind behind Yang Chongguang.\u201cOkay!\u201d Xu-er looked at Wen Xinya with mixed emotions. When dealing with a situation like this, she was able to handle matters rationally. As for himself, he had lost his cool earlier and felt a sense of shame because his actions could not even be compared to a girl like Wen Xinya. This almost hurt his dignity as a man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He then made a call on his cell phone. \u201cHow\u2019s the progress of the task I\u2019ve assigned you with?\u201d\u201cRest assured, Ninth Young Master. I\u2019ve carried it out exactly the way you\u2019ve instructed and coordinated well with Young Master Gu and Young Missus Wen\u2019s plan. Everything is going according to plan.\u201d\u201cMm! I know! You must ensure the safety of Young Missus Wen. I don\u2019t wish to see her getting into any accidents at Black Sunday.\u201d After finishing his sentence, he hesitated for a while, as if afraid that his instructions were not clear enough. He repeated, \u201cNo accidents at all. Have I made myself clear?\u201dThe voice on the other end of the line replied in a stern tone, \u201cNinth Young Master, please don\u2019t worry. I have opened a secret passageway for Young Missus Wen in Black Sunday. Her safety will not be compromised.\u201d\u201cWell done!\u201dAfter hanging up, Si Yiyan leaned back on the chair and rested.Though the Gu Family had connections to the owners of Black Sunday, the power behind it was far more complicated and beyond their imagination. They could not possibly overpower it. Xinya had acted bravely in this matter. However, what she did not know was that a slight mindless mistake could land her in grave danger.But she seemed to be well aware of the power behind Black Sunday. She had made the necessary arrangements and were able to plan a strategy to avoid potential threats and dangers. This greatly surprised him. If she was not someone who frequented this place, how would she know so much about Black Sunday\u2019s hidden rules?This was a question that boggled his mind.While he was still deep in his thoughts, Wen Xinya walked out of Black Sunday. He tapped the horn.The sudden high pitch sound from the horn pierced through the silence of the night.Wen Xinya subconsciously turned over and saw Si Yiyan\u2019s silver Cayenne parked by the roadside, waiting for her. The silver body of the Cayenne subtly glowed under the dim lights in the dark.After boarding the car, Wen Xinya tilted her head and look at Si Yiyan. \u201cHow did you know I was here? Were you secretly following me?\u201d she asked. At this point, she squinted her eyes in the faint light and started to look serious.Si Yiyan replied with a frown, \u201cI saw you going out late in the night. I had wanted to ask you, but by the time I was outside, you had already boarded another car. I was worried and tried calling you, but your cell phone was turned off. I had no choice but to follow you here.\u201dWen Xinya seemed to accept his explanation and calmed herself. She responded plainly, \u201cIt was nothing serious. The person who fetched me was Gu Junlin. He\u2019s a nice guy. The Gu Family has some connections to the owners of Black Sunday, therefore I was in safe hands.\u201dSi Yiyan nodded and said, \u201cXinya, the owners and the power behind Black Sunday are complicated and far beyond your imagination. I suggest you avoid coming here often.\u201dHe spoke with a serious and concerned tone. Wen Xinya pondered for a while and realized that Si Yiyan must have had some connections with Black Sunday. After hearing his advice, she started to give it some serious thought and knew that it was not appropriate for her to make use of Black Sunday to deal with Yang Chongguang.Black Sunday was known for its vice activities. This showed that the group of people behind its operations did not have integrity. Her identity as the Young Missus Wen would also create opportunities for rumors against herself.\u201cI understand. I had not given it serious consideration for this matter.\u201d She thought she knew much about this bar based on her frequent visits in her previous life, but what she knew was only the tip of the iceberg. By executing her plans without much consideration was indeed a reckless decision.Si Yiyan stopped speaking after that. She was an intelligent girl and would be able to understand the seriousness of the matter quickly.After a while, Si Yiyan turned over and looked at her. She was lying on her seat and had fallen asleep.Even though she was asleep, she was frowning. He assumed that she was tired and vexed over the scandals. Though she was putting up a strong front and seemed to have dealt with the matter maturely with everything under her control, she was just a 15-year-old teenager. She must be weary under the challenge of the media.Si Yiyan parked the car by the roadside. He lowered her seat gently to allow her a more comfortable rest. Then he removed his jacket and put it on her. After dimming the lights inside the car he lowered his own seat. The original small gap between the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s seats disappeared as if they were lying together on the same bed.Under the dim lights, she looked calm and peaceful as she continued sleeping. There was beauty in the silence.Si Yiyan leaned towards her lightly and gently kissed her forehead. The mild fragrance lingered in his nose and made him excited. He slowly moved his lips downwards from her nose, and then to her lips. He kissed lightly on her lips as if a dragonfly touched the water and retracted immediately.Si Yiyan lied down beside her, watching her sleep. He had a sense of satisfaction and suddenly felt that his life was complete.As time passed, probably due to the strong desire in his eyes, Wen Xinya could feel someone watching her. She grew conscious and slowly opened her eyes. She could see a pair of beautiful eyes that contained passion and satisfaction and an irresistible aura that contained mixed emotions within at the same time.Si Yiyan saw her waking up. He spoke in a low tone with some slight disappointment. \u201cYou woke up? I noticed you had fallen asleep earlier. I parked the car by the roadside so that you could have a better rest.\u201d\u201cHow long was I asleep?\u201d Wen Xinya asked with a light voice. It was probably because she had just woken up, her voice was not as crisp as usual. She sounded a little childish and lazy.\u201cOne hour and five minutes,\u201d answered Si Yiyan. While she was asleep, he almost counted every second. Every moment he spent with her was very precious. It was as if he wanted to record every cherished moment and store them into his memory.\u201cSend me back to the Mo Family\u2019s mansion! The bed at home is the best.\u201d Wen Xinya tried adjusting herself. Her body was stiff and uncomfortable. She could subconsciously feel that something happened during the sleep that she had missed, but she did not know what it was.\u201cOkay!\u201d Si Yiyan raised both of their seats.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya suddenly realized what was bothering her. It felt like they were lying together on the same bed! At this thought, she blushed and her heart beat faster.She started frowning. Ever since that day when Si Yiyan expressed his intention towards her when he sent her to Grandpa Du\u2019s medical house she felt she was getting closer to him, and it felt natural. When she thought about it, they had spent some happy moments together.She did not like this feeling that rendered her out of control!It seemed like Si Yiyan was someone who could handle relationships well\u2014he knew exactly when he should advance or retreat. It would be best for her to keep a distance from him from now onwards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The hazy greenish-blue smoke covered half of his expression, leaving him with his sexy, narrow eyes that gave off a deadly allure.Gu Junling sucked in the cigarette deeply and slowly exhaled, spitting out circles of smoke into the air. He was at such a young age, yet he was able to do something that only experienced people could do. He asked, \u201cXu-er, are you serious?\u201dXu Zhenyu\u2019s eyes sparkled as he laughed, \u201cWhat do you mean? Your words don\u2019t make sense.\u201d\u201cLeave if you are not too deep in!\u201d Gu Junling knew he understood what he meant, thus he did not care if he acknowledged it or not.Xu Zhenyu suddenly went silent. His fingers gently stroked the pink pearl ear studs with little diamonds on his left ear subconsciously. He could still vividly remember the incident that night, and the clear sound emitted from the young girl\u2019s body. That warm breath was etched in his mind as if it held the power to become unforgettable.Gu Junling understood the delirious look he had on his face, and said, \u201cA woman like her is born different from us. If you are serious, you have to think carefully about your future. You either walk beside her or be the man supporting her back. But no matter which it is, the you now cannot match up to her. You should know, your reputation will bring her down.\u201dGu Junling recalled how the young girl sat there quietly, her entire body emitting an aura that despised others. There was an air of arrogance behind her every action, and she seemed calculative but wise. Her entire being gave out a radiance that dazzled the eyes.Xu Zhenyu stood there in a daze. He had thought of these before, but the words of Gu Junling were so straightforward that there was nothing much for him to brood over.Xu Zhenyu had a dream the second night! It was deep and long as if a huge boulder was pressing on his head, suffocating him.In his dream, he went to Black Sunday with those foppish buddies of his. He met Wen Xinya for the first time there. She had a thick smoky makeup on, her face was caked in powder, and her short hair was permed into an afro. She was wearing black punk style leather clothes which exposed her white belly, and her skirt was so short that it could only cover the beginning of her thighs.He only thought of her as one of his friend\u2019s new bitch, and even secretly scorned his taste in girls. Her painted face and thick makeup made her give off a rotten smell. One look and he could tell that she was someone that had been toyed with and cast aside.After they have had many drinks, they started playing even more recklessly without a care, and Fang Yuanjie suddenly asked for drugs from a waiter.Fortunately, the country did a good job propagating the dangers of drugs. No matter how foppish he was, he would never dare to mess with stuff like this! However, the development of the situation went out of his control. His friends encouraged him to take the drugs. As his ability to think properly was affected by the alcohol and those people were egging him on, he started to think that a little sniff would not cause him to be addicted.Just when he was ready to take a sniff, a hand grabbed him and pulled him out of the room. He was pushed into an empty room next door. He remembered for all eternity that pale, white hand that was skin and bones yet still rendered him speechless with its beautiful shape.He raised his head and saw the woman with the rotten odor staring cynically at him. She chided, \u201cAre you really that innocent? You are courting death! Just because you accepted your friends\u2019 challenge you\u2019re going to pay for it with your life? Do you know what that stuff was? Do you really think you\u2019ll fly by taking a sniff or two?\u201dHe replied with rage out of embarrassment, \u201cYou bitch! Who are you to interfere with my matter?\u201dWhen he turned around and was about to leave, Wen Xinya grabbed his hand, \u201cHold on for another 10 minutes. If after that you still decide to carry on sniffing that harmful stuff, I will not stop you.\u201dAfter 10 minutes, she started having withdrawal symptoms from her drug addiction. She curled up into a ball on the floor pathetically, and could not stop shivering and sweating profusely. Afterward, she went crazy and ran around the house smashing everything in her sight, just like a madwoman.He was scared out of his wits. All he could hear was her heavy breaths, her painful groans, her exhausted cries, and her undignified begging.Finally, she took off her own clothes and tried to seduce him through any means, all the while repeatedly saying, \u201cGive me\u2026 Give me\u2026 I want\u2026\u201dHe had never seen a drug addict experience withdrawal symptoms before, so he fled with his tail between his legs that day.Ever since then, he did not dare to hang out with his bad friends anymore. After a long time, he remembered that he owed her his gratitude. He went to Black Sunday but was not able to find her. Although he knew that he only wanted to thank her, he could not help but feel a yearning for her which propelled him to find her.After three days, he finally found her. She had just finished sniffing ****, and was pulling him to sing and dance happily. He then recalled how she was like when her withdrawal symptoms started acting up and suddenly felt sympathy for her.That\u2019s right, sympathy!Later on, he found out that she was the Missus of the Wen Family. He learned about her efforts to make the Wen Family acknowledge her, about how Xia Ruya took away everything she had, and the resentment she felt every time she was compared to Xia Ruya. He was aware of how she intentionally drank and got into fights just to catch the Wen Family\u2019s attention, but only to receive scoldings. He knew that because the Wen Family would not accept her, she was lost in hatred, eventually abandoned herself and was too far gone now.He understood all her despair and agony.At that time, his heart ached for her.That\u2019s right, heartache!His heart ached for how she was not able to move the Wen Family\u2019s heart even after she ruined herself.His heart ached for how nobody was willing to care for her despite her being such a good girl.His sympathy for her changed into another feeling because of this heartache.Without knowing when it began, he fell deeply in love with her.He gave the red diamond on his ear to her. He helped her to quit drugs \u2014 watched her roll around the floor in pain, cut her wrists in despair and begged him with no dignity. He was weaker than her. He gave her the drugs after yielding in to her agony and despair.He indulged her every whim. He spent all his allowance, sold all his brand clothes, accessories, and even the six ear studs on his ears to get drugs for her. He even tried every method to cheat his family off their money and also borrowed money from his friends. Just for her, he sullied his ties with all his friends and even fell out with Han Mofeng. In the end, there was no turning back.He was later reported to be carrying drugs. His grandfather announced that he was kicked out of the Xu Family, and then retired from the military circles. The news of him carrying drugs affected the careers of his father and brother and even sent his mother to the hospital.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe was sentenced to three years in jail.Han Mofeng visited him once and asked, \u201cDo you regret it?\u201dHe shook his head and replied, \u201cNot at all, she is a good lady. It was not her choice to end up like this. She is very pitiful. This world is vast and filled with many people, yet not a single one would love her.\u201dHan Mofeng was greatly disappointed in him, but he still told him the truth. She tried to surrender herself to the police for him, but her stepmother held her back and locked her in the house. From then on, she never saw him again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His lifeless heart came back to life in a moment. He looked at her in the phone. She had lost a lot of weight again and her cheeks were sunken, but she was still beautiful.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, because of me, you\u2026\u201d She cried uncontrollably over the phone and would not stop apologizing to him. Her eyes dripped with tears, spilling onto his heart.Pitter-patter\u2026 They flooded his entire world. He had never seen tears as pure as hers, they were the most beautiful things in the world, glittering and crystal clear. He wanted to reach out his hand to touch and even taste them.From then on, she had never returned to see him.Three years later, he was released from prison. As he went back to the city without looking back at the place where he had suffered for three years, he saw the news that was everywhere: The Missus of the Wen Family died from a drug overdose!At that moment, his world came crashing down on him. \u201cShe is not dead. She must\u2019ve known that today is my release and is playing a prank on me.\u201dHe only believed that all these were the truth when he went to the hospital morgue to find that nobody had retrieved her body.In the hospital morgue, he met a man who had come to collect her body as well. That man sighed and said, \u201cShe had quit drugs for three years. This was considered impossible since she had already been taking drugs for around eight years, yet she persevered. She\u2019s the strongest and most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen. She told me that she thought nobody in this world cared about her, but there was someone who gave her his everything. As such, she could not burden him any longer. In these past three years, I\u2019ve watched her quit drugs little by little. She\u2019s only had three months left before she would have succeeded, why would she suddenly overdose on drugs?\u201dThree years\u2026 So that is why she did not visit him in the past three years. She wanted to show him a new her after he was released from prison.He knew that once she had set her mind to something, she could do anything. After hearing that man\u2019s words, his suspicions grew and he started to dig into her death.Soon after, Old Mr. Wen died from a stroke, Old Madam Wen went crazy and was sent to an elderly care center, and Wen Haowen ended up in a vegetative state after an accident. The Wen Family was almost completely destroyed.Making use of this opportunity, Xia Ruya grasped 25% of the shares that belonged to the Wen Family and became the largest shareholder of the Wen Corporation. Ning Shuqian took hold of 10% of the shares and became the shareholder of the Wen Family.Subsequently, the Xia Family devoured the Wen Corporation bit by bit until the Xia Family completely took over. With her billionaire status, Xia Ruya married her fiance Xiao Jingnan. Their prosperous wedding caused a great sensation in the world.He started to investigate Xia Ruya, Ning Shuqian, and Wen Yuya.The truth he found out drove him crazy!Ning Shuqian, Xia Ruya, and Wen Yuya were the ones who ruined her.They devised for her to lose her chastity at the age of 15, have nude pictures of her taken, have her kidnapped and injected with a large number of drugs causing her to be addicted, drugged her and arranged for three men to sleep with her, took down porno videos of her\u2026Along with the piles of other little things they had done, he was unable to scrutinize them all!He felt like a ball of crushed paper that was rolled into a ball inch by inch. That bone crushing pain was like water drowning him, causing him to be filled with evil thoughts.A blast of loud alarm rang suddenly. The nightmare that Xu Zhenyu was in broke into pieces, and his consciousness came back little by little. He sat up on the bed hurriedly, squeezed the clothes on his chest tightly, opened his mouth and took in deep breaths.Droplets of sweat formed on his forehead as he breathed heavily, deep and husky. In the night, it felt especially lonely.The phone\u2019s ringing got on his nerves.He felt as if he was still deep in the nightmare, unable to escape. The bone-crushing pain he felt in the dream left him breathless despite him being already awake.The dream is obviously not real!Yet, everything he had felt was so vivid! It felt as if everything had happened before.Out of the sudden, he felt a chill ran down his spine. He then realized that the pajamas that he was wearing were drenched in sweat because of his nightmare.He laughed at himself and shook his head. What you think about in the day, you will dream of it at night indeed. However, Xu Zhenyu did not know that the dream had already started to change his way of thinking from this moment onwards, changing his destiny.He took the cup of water on the cabinet at his bedside and drank it. Once his head was clearer, he finally answered the call, \u201cHi, this is Xu Zhenyu.\u201d\u201cSecond Young Master, Yang Chongguang committed suicide.\u201d The voice through the phone said with unease.Xu Zhenyu\u2019s face darkened. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cYang Chongguang jumped off a building and committed suicide. I followed your instructions and instigated him to try to get money. As expected, the first person he called was Ning Shuqian. He asked Ning Shuqian to give him a million dollars or he would reveal the fact that she bribed him to create scandals about Wen Xinya. Ning Shuqian was afraid and promised to give him a million dollars. However, she asked for some time and he promised to give her a day. Yang Chongguang received a call and left hurriedly just now, and I tailed him from behind. As I arrived at Qingfeng Tower, Yang Chongguang was already in the elevator, heading towards the roof. By the time I rushed up there, he had already jumped off the rooftop.\u201d\u201cListen to me, call the police now and leave there immediately.\u201d After saying that, Xu Zhenyu quickly hung up the phone, took a random shirt and left the house in a hurry.He took a car from the garage and headed towards Qingfeng Tower. He gave Wen Xinya a call, \u201cXinya, Yang Chongguang committed suicide.\u201dWen Xinya sat up from the bed in a sudden and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dXu Zhenyu gave a recount of the situation and said, \u201cSomebody has already called the police. I am now rushing to Qingfeng Tower.\u201d\u201cDo not go near Qingfeng Tower!\u201d Wen Xinya instructed instantly.\u201cI know! Xinya, I\u2019m sorry. I did not arrange everything properly and ruined your plan.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith her sharp instincts, Wen Xinya felt that the incident was not that simple. \u201cWe still do not know exactly what happened, so don\u2019t blame yourself yet.

Xu Zhenyu replied, \u201cAre you saying that Yang Chongguang did not commit suicide?\u201d\u201cEverything about this incident is strange. Clearly, somebody planned for this to happen. That person calculated so precisely, making use of the elevator to separate Yang Chongguang from the man you sent to tail him. There was no way for us to guard against that.\u201d Wen Xinya explained.Xu Zhenyu was also aware that something was off.

She trusted the Chaofan Lawyer Corporation to press charges against Heavenbright and a few other press media for harming her right of reputation.She had already planned to make use of the law to protect her own reputation. Previously, she pretended to be weak and did not respond, luring them to act even more outrageously so that she could punish them thoroughly. This way, she could stand up to her position as the Missus of the Wen Family and let them know that this title could not be snatched by anyone easily.On the other hand, she also wanted to make use of this opportunity to call Ning Shuqian out from hiding behind Yang Chongguang\u2019s back. However, Yang Chongguang died with no clear reason, allowing Ning Shuqian to escape.At the same time, Yang Chongguang\u2019s death set off an alarm in her.She adjusted her understanding of Ning Shuqian again and again, yet after so many fights with her, she could still not understand her fully.It was obvious that Yang Chongguang\u2019s death was related to Ning Shuqian. Such murder without a sound meant that there was someone behind Ning Shuqian backing her up. This sort of cruel and vicious person that trampled on the lives of people was truly frightening.Yang Chongguang was a gambling addict who extorted money from Ning Shuqian whenever he lost all his money. Keeping a person like him around her must have been worrying. However, Ning Shuqian did not instruct Yang Chongguang to commit intolerable crimes against her but only made him spread scandals about her. With her meticulous and scheming mind, there was no need for her to kill him over such matters.She was perplexed. Everything about this was strange.Wen Xinya walked to the window in annoyance, and to her surprise, Si Yiyan was standing right outside of it. After seeing her, the corners of his thin lips curled up, and he jumped up on to the windowsill. Under her shocked gaze, he entered her room with ease. That was done so smoothly\u2026Suddenly, a thought popped up into Wen Xinya\u2019s head. Which idiot of a designer made this window such that it only took two seconds for a man to enter her room? Wouldn\u2019t it be dangerous if he schemed something while she was asleep!Si Yiyan\u2019s eyes did not miss how she was caught up in wild thoughts. The smile on his face became broader, excited to tease her. He slowly walked to her, placed a finger under her chin and lifted her head. His face inched closer towards her and said in a low voice beside her lips, \u201cRemember to close the window the next time you sleep.\u201dHis breath was too close. She could smell the faint fresh bamboo-like scent on his body as if he had viburnum flowers on him. Wen Xinya took a step back and exclaimed, \u201cSuch skilled actions! Only a shameless and despicable flower thief such as Master Si can do things like visiting a girl\u2019s room in the middle of the night. Even a brilliant general like you have this sort of unexpected trait. It is true that one cannot judge a book by its cover.\u201dSi Yiyan narrowed his eyes with long luscious lashes, so pretty that Wen Xinya could not help but feel jealous. A grown man actually had such beautiful eyes. Looking at him, there seemed to be thousands of magnificent lights in his eyes. Si Yiyan said, \u201cA flower such as yourself definitely has value in picking. Such a shame you are but a flower bud.\u201dBeing turned against with her own words, Wen Xinya felt anger and embarrassment. She replied, \u201cIs a flower bud not a flower? You are looking down on flower buds!\u201d \u201dBlah blah blah! What was she even saying? This had nothing to do with flower buds, why was she even bickering about them? Wen Xinya regretted so much that her guts turned green.\u201cHaha!\u201d Si Yiyan laughed patronizingly. That low laughter was like music from a Guzheng, clear, soothing and melodious, causing people to be caught up in a trance. He said, \u201cWhen did I look down on flower buds?\u201dWen Xinya was rendered speechless.Si Yiyan smiled softly and with refined beauty. Suddenly, he pressed her against the window, placed his beautiful thin lips on hers and started rubbing against them. Her lips felt as if a violent storm was trampling on a flower. No! A flower bud.She thought to herself,He must not know how to kiss! Does he think two lips rubbing together is kissing? Little does he know that this is just light kissing.While letting her thoughts run wild, Wen Xinya chose to forget that she was being treated flippantly and did not push him away!He pushed Wen Xinya away and hugged her. He gasped in a low voice by her ear, \u201cYang Chongguang\u2019s death is not that simple. Don\u2019t act rashly, you have to be more careful in the future.\u201dWen Xinya was knocked out of her daze, and pushed him away subconsciously. He was just kissing her before mentioning the incident out of the blue. This sudden development left Wen Xinya in a dilemma. Should she continue to pursue about him kissing her, or should she talk to him about the serious matter?Si Yiyan\u2019s fingers brushed lightly over the red diamond on her left ear, his eyes dimming for a moment. Skillfully, his fingers placed an ancient looking long earring on her left ear that reached her collarbone. The exquisite earring made her all the more elegant and beautiful.\u201cDon\u2019t take it off. When the time comes, this earring could protect your life.\u201d Si Yiyan said in a cold, cautious voice that she had never heard before. His warm, wet breath against her ear actually made her feel completely in awe.Wen Xinya touched it instinctively, \u201cThis earring\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask anything. I won\u2019t hurt you. Trust me!\u201d Si Yiyan pulled her to him and kissed her forehead. He looked at her dotingly, as if she was his most important treasure.After hearing his words, Wen Xinya swallowed all her questions and doubts. \u201cOkay\u2026 I trust you!\u201d She sputtered after staring at him for a long time.She was not someone that could not distinguish the good from the bad. He cared for her in every way, and she could not pretend to be unaware.\u201cMmm!\u201d Si Yiyan made a sound in reply and jumped up on to the window sill, disappearing from her sight in just a moment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya\u2019s train of thought was in a mess as she sat in front of the mirror. The exquisite, ancient looking and fascinating long earring looked custom made for her.The ear stud on the earring was a pair of black and white angel wings. On her earlobe, black and white blended together but also contradicted each other, giving out a sort of mysterious and tough modern beauty.Whatever the earring was made of, she felt a white holy light so beautiful it was dazzling. In between the two wings were two strands of silver chain, one slightly longer than the other, that reached her collarbone. A pair of flower carvings hung on the silver chains, emitting a soft glow. If you looked closely, the flower carvings were in the design of viburnum flowers. The carvings on the tiny beads showed the skillful handiwork of the creator, with the flower designs looking very lifelike. They looked like butterflies, elegant and perfect.She never knew that the color black could produce such a beautiful light, much less that black viburnum flower could be so perfectly bright.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The fallen angel Lucifer who became the Devil \u2014 Satan. The King of Darkness\u2026While she was sleeping, Wen Xinya had a weird dream.She dreamed of a really pretty flower bud, producing a white beautiful glow. It was swaying with its slim body, so gentle and enchanting.Si Yiyan stood in front of the flower bud wearing a black shirt. His features were defined, his lashes were long and stunning, and his lips were beautiful. He stroked the flower bud gently with his fingers, so gentle as if he was handling a rare treasure.Suddenly, he ran his fingers along the flower bud and snapped it in two. It landed into his slender hand.When she woke up, Wen Xinya sat on the bed and recalled her talk with Si Yiyan the day before about the flower buds. She quietly laughed at herself for dreaming of something she had talked about.However, what did the dream meant when Si Yiyan retrieved that flower bud?Wen Xinya shook her head abruptly and said, \u201cWho cares what it meant, it was just a dream. How foolish, to fret over a dream.\u201dAfter she regained her composure, Wen Xinya saw the earring on her dressing table. She hesitated for a moment before picking it up and wearing it on her right ear. The earring held a fresh symbol, clearly not just a simple accessory. It must have a special use at a different place.At the thought of Si Yiyan\u2019s mysterious identity, Wen Xinya frowned.In the meantime, she received news from the private investigator she hired. Ning Shuqian was very careful with her actions. It was difficult to track her call history because of the memory card she used in her phone. Furthermore, whenever she made bank transactions, she was sure to deposit in investment companies before transferring them. She left no tracks behind such that nothing of use was found.Although Wen Xinya was disappointed, it was within her expectations. If Ning Shuqian was so easy to deal with, she would not be Ning Shuqian.Meanwhile, there was quite a stir for the past two days. The Chaofan Lawyer Corporation announced to the public that they had accepted the case from the Missus of Wen Family, to press charges against Heavenbright Press Media and ten other press media for severely damaging her reputation. They had already submitted the necessary applications to the court.On the other hand, nobody really cared about the news of Yang Chongguang\u2019s death.The media kept making calls to the Mo Family in hopes of interviewing Wen Xinya. However, Wen Xinya rejected every call from the media, and even more so their wish to interview her.Her unyielding attitude made the media understand the severity of this incident.As the development of the situation was far from their expectation, Wen Xinya\u2019s action caught the attention of people from all walks of life. The Missus of the Zhou Family, Zhou Tianyu, showed her support openly. She even revealed the fact that it was the birthday of the Second Young Master Xu, Xu Zhenyu, that night. He had invited a group of friends who he had good relations with to Ninth-Heaven for a gathering where everybody ended up drinking too much, and she was the one who requested Wen Xinya to bring the Second Young Master Xu home.The young master of the Gu Family, Gu Junling, also testified to that point. He even mocked the media for being used by someone, insinuating that there was somebody out there wanting to make use of the Second Young Master Xu\u2019s bad reputation to create scandals about Wen Xinya.A few well-known celebrities in the showbiz discussed the news of Wen Xinya\u2019s fake scandals and expressed their sympathy towards her. They even hinted that Wen Xinya was just an underaged girl, and it made their heart ache that the media would use such malicious writings to oppose a child. They also made an appeal that a child should grow up without a worry, and not suffer attacks from the media which are detrimental to their growth.Words like these aroused many people\u2019s sympathy. Everybody was a parent to their own child. Nobody would be able to take it if their own child was put under the spotlight because of scandals created by the media just for going to a friend\u2019s gathering.Some celebrities mentioned the news and expressed their disappointment towards the current state of the media, citing that they have lost the basic conscience and quality that a media worker should have.Old Mr. Mo said during a discussion with his friend about the current state of the media, \u201cThe role of the media is to deliver culture and news. Its true responsibility in the society is to deliver culture and news accurately as fast as possible to the people. They should not make use of the platform to create baseless news for their own benefits and monetary gains.\u201dThe words of Old Mr. Mo garnered the attention of the central media. The head of the country\u2019s media publicly announced that media news worker had to deliver news and culture to the public strictly with no errors. He even stated that the current state of the country\u2019s media would be reformed, and the decision had already been approved by the central members.After Old Mr. Mo called out the country\u2019s media, the central members all learned to be frightened and cautious.For a period of time, the public opinions all leaned towards the underaged Wen Xinya!At this time, Chaofan Lawyer Corporation handed evidence to the court. The court accepted them and announced that the trial would be held on the 22nd of May.Looking at the newspaper in her hands, Ning Shuqian almost tore it up viciously out of rage. She had spent a million dollars for Yang Chongguang to create scandals about Wen Xinya so that she would be abandoned by the Wen Family and be condemned by everybody. However, Wen Xinya turned the tides so easily.She was indignant!She took out her phone, prepared to call Yang Chongguang to promise to give him a million dollars. She wanted to appease him first in order to prevent him from leaking any information out of fear when Wen Xinya pressed charges against him.Just then, she saw the news on a suicide by jumping off a building on the newspaper. The picture on the article was Yang Chongguang. In shock, she grabbed the newspaper instantly and read it in detail.A man from Z country, Yang Chongguang jumped off the Qingfeng Tower and committed suicide yesterday night at 1 a.m. due to large debts from gambling!No, that was impossible. Yang Chongguang just called her yesterday to blackmail her for a million dollars, how could he just commit suicide like that?Ning Shuqian was happy but worried. She was happy that there was no need for her to give him a million dollars since he was dead. Also, she would never have to suffer from his continuous blackmails or the fear that he would disclose the fact that she was the one who instructed him to create scandals about Wen Xinya. What she was worried about\u2026 was Yang Chongguang dying just like this. Would it implicate her?With this, a sudden thought flashed across her mind. She pressed a number on her phone in a frenzy, and the other party picked up the phone instantly. She fired a question, \u201cDid you send people to kill Yang Chongguang?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cA traitor like Yang Chongguang deserved to die.\u201d The voice on the other end of the phone was very strange. It was so hoarse that it was painful to hear. Clearly, that person was using a voice changer.\u201cWhat\u2019s your motive for killing him? Let me tell you, don\u2019t even think of dragging me into this.\u201d Ning Shuqian cried out softly. She thought that she had already escaped from the other party\u2019s clutches, but she did not expect him to be hiding in the dark.\u201cI\u2019m helping you, otherwise you\u2019ll end up dead without knowing why.\u201dNing Shuqian felt a sudden bad feeling. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you think we\u2019re able to slip away unknown just because you got Yang Chongguang to create scandals about her?\u201d The strange voice said, filled with disdain.Ning Shuqian broke into a sweat and shivered.\u201cShe already knew you were the one pulling the strings. She did nothing and pretended to be weak against the media, yet she plotted in the dark for Yang Chongguang to be caught up in gambling debts. Her motive was to make Yang Chongguang blackmail you for money and catch you red-handed. If I had not gotten rid of Yang Chongguang, do you think you would be sitting there safely?\u201dNing Shuqian got instantly terrified. \u201cYou\u2019re lying. Wen Xinya is just a wench from the streets. She has just returned to the Wen Family with no backing and no foundation. How on earth would she be able to pull that off?\u201d\u201cFool, did you think that a pretty wench without any capability would be able to live so safely until now? It\u2019s precisely because she is from the streets that she knows so many vile people. Doing something like this would not even require much effort for her. Furthermore, don\u2019t forget that she knows Second Young Master Xu, and meeting the people in his circle would not have been difficult. The Gu Family had a hand in the incident this time.\u201dNing Shuqian was in a frenzy. The person\u2019s words brought her back to her senses. She recalled the things that happened when Wen Xinya returned to the Wen Family and realized that the person was right. What should she do now?\u201cWen Xinya knows you\u2019re scheming to frame her. Did you think she would let you off? Sooner or later the Wen Family will become hers with the support of Old Mr. Wen. What can you achieve by then? What would you end up as? Can you fight against her with just you alone?\u201dHearing these words, Ning Shuqian became even more frantic. Wen Xinya alone was not a problem, but if she had the support of Old Wen she would have no chance against her.Old Wen was never fond of her. Back when Mo Yunyao died, Old Wen would not agree to let Haowen marry her no matter what. In the end, Haowen acted first and stole the family\u2019s account to register their marriage at the bureau of civil affairs. They did not even hold a wedding.All these years, she was unable to give birth to an heir. As such, Old Wen was even more unhappy with her. Ever since Wen Xinya came back, Old Wen made things even more difficult for her.If Old Wen found out that she bribed Yang Chongguang to create scandals about Wen Xinya, he definitely would not let her off, right?The more she thought about it, the more worried Ning Shuqian became.\u201cWen Xinya is the only heir of the Wen Family, and the assets of the family will all belong to her alone in the future. Meanwhile, you did not give birth to anyone for the Wen Family and even brought a child from your previous marriage. What do you think you will end up as? Furthermore, you seduced her father while her mother was pregnant, causing her mother to die while giving birth. Do you think she will let you off easy?\u201dThe other party\u2019s words hit the nail on the head. Ning Shuqian thought of Wen Xinya\u2019s indifferent eyes that were the same as that of Old Mr. Mo. When they looked at you, it was as if they could see through your soul, making people shrink under their gaze.\u201cThe only person who can help you now is me. Think about it, Wen Xinya roamed the streets for 15 years and her foundations are not firm since she just returned to the Wen Family. Moreover, she does not have much power in the circle because she is still too young. If I were to help you, wouldn\u2019t the assets of the Wen Family still be yours in the future?\u201dNing Shuqian\u2019s breathing became harsher. Wen Haowen was headstrong and could not take on responsibility, hence he could not achieve any great success. Since she had Wen Haowen under her control, everything in the Wen Family would belong to her if she could get rid of Wen Xinya.\u201cAs long as we work together, I will give all the money of the Wen Family to you after we succeed. What do you think?\u201dNing Shuqian had always been cautious and was not tempted by the other party\u2019s bait. \u201cHow can I trust you when people are willing to do anything for money. I don\u2019t believe you are so kind as to give me the entire Wen Family\u2019s assets.\u201d\u201cYou have no choice but to believe me.\u201dNing Shuqian replied angrily, \u201cThat\u2019s up to me to decide.\u201d\u201cWhat if I tell you I have Yang Chongguang\u2019s phone with me, and that there is a recording of him blackmailing you?\u201d\u201cAre you threatening me?\u201d Ning Shuqian\u2019s eyes widened. She recalled the words Yang Chongguang said to her when pestering her that day, and she understood immediately. She cursed that sly fox Yang Chongguang in her mind for recording their conversation. Not only was he afraid that she would not give him the one million dollars, but he was also planning to blackmail her again in the future.Now that the recording was in the hands of that person, she would become the biggest suspect of Yang Chongguang\u2019s death if the recording were to be leaked out.\u201cDon\u2019t say such words, I only want to build a partnership with you. There\u2019s no need for any threatening. However, if you do not know any better, then that may not be the case.\u201d The strange voice sounded even more horrifying with such malicious words.A chill ran down Ning Shuqian\u2019s spine. Thinking of Yang Chongguang\u2019s death, she felt suffocated. \u201cHow can I believe that your words are true?\u201d\u201cSince you do not believe me, then I shall play the recording for you. Tsk tsk\u2026 it\u2019s hard to imagine that a gracious lady such as yourself have such a vulgar side.\u201d The hysterical laughter from the strange voice sounded like a chainsaw, piercing her ears.Hearing these words, Ning Shuqian believed him. At that time when Yang Chongguang blackmailed her for money, she did not expect that he would record their conversation. As such, she did not care about her image and recklessly broke out into curses. Although she had married into a rich family for many years, she still retained her rude and bold commoner side. Thus, her scoldings were especially vulgar.Just then, her voice came through the phone, \u201cYang Chongguang, you bastard. You despicable villain. Did you forget that you promised to leave far away after receiving my money the last time and never disclose all the information? You motherfucker! Now that you\u2019ve gambled and lost money, you came back to blackmail me. Do you treat me as your bank and think that you can take anything you want?\u201dNing Shuqian\u2019s vision went dark and she almost fell to the floor. She gritted her teeth and said, \u201cFine, I believe you! Let\u2019s work together.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re smart indeed. Don\u2019t worry, our partnership is for our mutual benefits. I would not do things that would not benefit you.\u201d\u201cShow me your sincerity if you want me to work with you. Give me Yang Chongguang\u2019s phone. You cannot make a copy of the recording, much less disclose anything about me. You cannot harm me in any way. According to what you said, I want the money after we succeed.\u201d\u201cYes, of course!\u201dAfter the phone call, Ning Shuqian almost collapsed. It had been 15 years\u2026 She thought she was freed from that person, but that person was just like an evil spirit haunting her. Her only choice was to work with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were no suspicious characters entering or leaving the building.\u201dSi Yiyan lightly tapped on the tea table with his finger \u2014 a common sound with an aggressive rhythm. The ambiance was tense. \u201cHow was the investigation on Ning Shuqian?\u201dThe man in black stood upright and became jittery. He replied with a stern look on his face. \u201cWe haven\u2019t found anything yet. We\u2019ve checked all of Ning Shuqian\u2019s communication records and also her bank records together with her spending habits, including all the people who interacted with her. However, nothing suspicious was found.\u201dSi Yiyan frowned. He was not satisfied with the results of the investigation.The man in black looked nervous. His huge and tall body suddenly became stiff. \u201cNinth Young Master, one of my men found out that on the day of Yang Chongguang\u2019s death, Ning Shuqian pawned quite a few of her personal jewelry and managed to gather five hundred dollars from all the items she pawned. I\u2019m guessing that Ning Shuqian indeed had something to do with Yang Chongguang\u2019s death.\u201dSi Yiyan\u2019s hand that was tapping on the tea table suddenly stopped moving. He spoke in a low and serious tone, with a ting of warning. \u201cI\u2019m dead sure that Ning Shuqian has something to do with Yang Chongguang\u2019s death. Continue to investigate the matter.\u201dThe cause of Yang Chongguang\u2019s death was a mystery, and there were many doubts about it. Even he could not find any evidence. It seemed like Ning Shuqian had a strong backing behind her. It would not be easy for Xinya to deal with her.\u201cYes, Ninth Young Master! I\u2019ll continue with my investigation!\u201d The man in black took a deep breath and turned around to leave. Ninth Young Master always acted calmly and peacefully, but he had a special frightening aura on him.Si Yiyan squinted his pair of long and beautiful eyes with determination and coldness. He would never allow anyone to harm or threaten Xinya\u2019s safety.Si Yiyan stood up and walked to the living room, and saw Wen Xinya sitting beside the tea table. She was wearing the pair of long earrings he had given her earlier. Her hands were meddling with the pearl that she got from the oyster feast that day. She liked it a lot and would frequently take it out to play with it like a toy.\u201cSince you like this pearl this much, why don\u2019t you get a jewelry master to polish it and make it into an accessory so that you can wear it with you everywhere you go.\u201d Si Yiyan stared at the pearl in her hands. It was half flattened and had an uneven surface.Wen Xinya held the pearl in her palm and said, \u201cWhy polish it? I like it this way. An unpolished pearl cannot be considered a true pearl. This is to remind me that one only gives off a beautiful glow with enough polish.\u201dSi Yiyan smiled. Wen Xinya was just like the pearl in her hands. It was just the beginning of the path she was going through and life\u2019s way of polishing her.Wen Xinya held the teapot and started brewing Chinese tea, her actions much smoother. Though there was room for improvement, it was a pleasure watching her in action, and the tea smelled good.Si Yiyan burst out laughing. \u201cYour scandal is hot news in the media right now. However, you still have the mood to brew some tea. It\u2019s no wonder Old Mo is always praising your intelligence. He is right indeed.\u201dWhen she was done, Wen Xinya poured a cup for him. She replied mindlessly. \u201cSo what if the media is reporting my scandal? I only need to wait patiently for the court trial of the case.\u201dSi Yiyan smiled. \u201cYour strategy \u2014 Getting to the root of the problem, is a brilliant one! All these press media companies who only care about monetary benefits will all be destroyed in your hands.\u201dShe was a careful person. Thus, she always had a backup plan.As for Yang Chongguang, she planned to make use of him to deal with Ning Shuqian. She appeared defenseless in front of the press, but in fact, she was making preparations to give them a hard blow. He realized that he had belittled her. She was someone who would avenge at any cost against those who had the intention to harm her. She certainly had a decisive and aggressive character.Wen Xinya sipped the tea gently. \u201cIf I\u2019m not offended, I\u2019ll not offend anyone. As for those who have offended me, I will avenge a hundred times!\u201dSi Yiyan asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan on dealing with Ning Shuqian?\u201dWen Xinya frowned with anger and hatred in her eyes. \u201cI will let her off the hook for the time being,\u201d she replied.Si Yiyan asked with a stern tone, \u201cHow much do you know about Ning Shuqian?\u201dWen Xinya froze. She lowered her eyebrows and asked, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dSi Yiyan looked serious. \u201cI have sent someone to investigate Ning Shuqian. However, they did not manage to find anything suspicious on her. Thus, I\u2019m sure she has powerful backing.\u201dWen Xinya was shocked. \u201cIs this information reliable?\u201dSi Yiyan explained plainly. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s reliable. Since Yang Chongguang\u2019s death, I have arranged for all of my men and resources to investigate this matter, but they were not able to find evidence till now. That must be the only conclusion.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s fingers became tense and grasped the teacup tighter. She had already guessed that someone was working for Ning Shuqian, but did not expect the situation to be so serious. Though she was not sure of Si Yiyan\u2019s identity, from his mysterious behavior, she could deduce that his status in society must be higher than the Wen Family\u2019s. Therefore, she believed him.Si Yiyan continued, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then Ning Shuqian\u2019s character and intention became very questionable. First, what is her intention of marrying into the Wen Family? Second, could there be other implications behind the reason for your mother\u2019s death?\u201dHe had grown up in a fierce environment, and that made him sensitive to anyone with an ulterior motive.\u201cDo you mean that Ning Shuqian planned and strategized her marriage into the Wen Family? And that my mother did not die a natural death?\u201d Si Yiyan\u2019s words caused an uprise in her emotions. It seemed like the situation had gone far beyond what she could imagine and understand based on her experiences in her previous life. This Ning Shuqian was much scarier than the one she knew in her previous life.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSi Yiyan nodded. \u201cThese are just some of my assumptions, and you have to gather more evidence to verify if what I assume is correct.\u201d\u201cNing Shuqian, you b*tch!\u201d Wen Xinya clenched her teeth tightly. Though Si Yiyan said they needed more evidence, Wen Xinya already believed that these assumptions were true. She had developed a great sense of hatred within at the thought of the possibility that someone had caused her mother\u2019s death.As Si Yiyan held her hand, he could feel the stiffness in her fingers and felt sorry for her. \u201cCalm down. Ning Shuqian is hard to be dealt with. Thus, you have to learn how to conceal your emotions. It isn\u2019t considered late for a gentleman to get his revenge 10 years later; a lady could take another 10 years. Remember, you\u2019re only 15-years-old. What you need to do now is to accumulate your knowledge and experience and allow yourself to grow stronger. You can only compete against the stronger ones by growing stronger yourself.\u201dWen Xinya took a deep breath and removed her hand from Si Yiyan\u2019s grasp. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I can\u2019t compete with Ning Shuqian based on my current status,\u201d she replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Gu Junlin, Xu Zhenyu, and Zhou Tianyu attended the trial as witnesses, and Old Mr. Wen and Old Master Mo sat in the spectator\u2019s gallery to observe the hearing.During the hearing, the attorney representing Wen Xinya cited a list of charges against Changjiang Press Media and a dozen other media press companies, accusing them of defamation towards his client. He showed a medical report that was extracted from Wen Xinya\u2019s health check-up before she returned to the Wen Family. From the report, Wen Xinya was in good health condition, and there was no evidence of her taking any psychoactive drugs to enliven her mood. Chaofan Law Corporation had also investigated Wen Xinya\u2019s past, and they concluded that, though Wen Xinya was part of a street gang, she did not do the ridiculous stuff the newspaper printed.According to her attorney, Wen Xinya was underaged. Thus, it was unreasonable for the media to use her past wrongdoings for such extreme accusations. He was able to bring across his points convincingly, causing everyone in the courtroom to feel empathy towards Wen Xinya.After a series of discussions amongst the judge and the panel of jurors, based on what Wen Xinya\u2019s attorney had presented, the judge ordered the defendant parties to provide new supportive evidence to prove that the past articles they had reported were based on valid grounds.\u201cThis verdict has been concluded. The plaintiff Wen Xinya sued Changjiang Press Media and a few other media press companies for defamation and creation of fabricated reports. The defendant was unable to provide evidence to support that their news reports are based on valid grounds. Thus, the Supreme Court will announce that the defendants are guilty.\u201d\u201cAccording to Chapter 120 and Chapter 134 of \u2018Country Z\u2019s Human Rights Law,\u2019 the Court orders the defendants to stop any misleading reports that will continue to defame the plaintiff\u2019s reputation. This order is to be carried out with immediate effect.\u201d\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s attorney has requested Changjiang Press Media and the related media press companies to compensate his client with a sum of 5 million dollars for publishing misleading reports with no true evidence, causing harm to her personal reputation, together with another sum of 5 million dollars as compensation for the mental sufferings caused to the client. The Court orders the total amount to be paid in full by the defendants within a period of three months. The plaintiff\u2019s attorney and the appointed law firm will have full rights to facilitate the debt collection from the defending companies.\u201dThe panel of jurors had found Changjiang Media Press and the other press media companies guilty and liable for this compensation.After the hearing, for a performance better than expected, Wen Xinya gave the Chaofan Law Corporation\u2019s attorneys hugs and handshakes to thank them for their efforts. It was said that the law was nothing more than human relationships. Her attorney was able to stimulate the emotions of the judge and panel of jurors by making use of the fact that she was underaged and the implications this matter had on other influential figures in society. Therefore, she was able to receive a considerable amount of compensation money.The result was not what Old Mr. Wen had expected. He was not involved in this incident nor did he render any help to Wen Xinya, but she was able to handle it so well. \u201cGood! Good! Good! Xinya, you have not disappointed Grandpa at all.\u201dSoon after, Wen Xinya walked out of the Supreme Court building accompanied by Old Mr. Wen and Old Master Mo. There was a huge crowd of reporters already standing by outside, and when they saw her, the crowd swamped over and surrounded them, flashing their cameras all around them.\u201cYoung Missus Wen, please share a few comments for your thoughts and feelings regarding this incident of your scandals.\u201dWen Xinya stood in the middle of the crowd and remained calm. Though only of a young age, she displayed an unwavering aura. As she looked at the crowd of reporters in front of her, her eyes glittered like the stars in the night sky. She coldly replied, \u201cIf no one offends me, I will not offend anyone. For those who have offended me, I will avenge a hundred times. This is my principle.\u201dSuch arrogant words stirred more emotions in the crowd of reporters. \u201cMissus Wen, regarding this scandal incident, it even involved your father, Wen Haowen, and your stepmother, Ning Shuqian, and the exposure of their past. Please share how you feel about it.\u201d\u201cThat happened in the previous generation. I, as the daughter, have no right to comment about it.\u201d\u201cMissus Wen, you\u2019re still wearing the ear stud Xu Zhenyu gave you. Please explain your relationship with Xu Zhenyu.\u201dWen Xinya paused, her face turning pale. There was a chillness in her eyes as if they were able to pierce through any obstacle. \u201cWhich media company are you from?\u201d she asked while staring at the reporter who asked the question.\u201cI\u2026 I am a reporter from Daily News Magazine Company\u2026\u201d The reporter replied, then shivered in fright. He was intimidated by Wen Xinya\u2019s aggressiveness and quickly reported his company\u2019s name.\u201cListen well. The reason for me wearing the ear stud from Xu Zhenyu is purely because we are very close friends. Oh yes\u2026 You are getting old and your memory is becoming poor. How can you understand the relationships between youngsters?\u201dAt such a remark, it triggered laughter from the crowd. The ambiance was not as tense as a while ago. The reporter who was ridiculed by Wen Xinya blushed. He was only 35-years-old. Yes, only 35-years-old.Wen Xinya continued in a serious tone, \u201cI do not hope to see anyone continue to make use of my relationship with Xu Zhenyu to slander or report fabricated news about us. Just like my Grampy said, the media workers are empowered with the huge responsibility of bringing the truth to the public. They should be sending positive messages to the public instead of looking to gain from the benefits of creating false and fabricated reports.\u201dThese reporters were smart. Wen Xinya\u2019s scandal had started from the relationship between her and Xu Zhenyu, and the entire episode had ended just as it hit its peak. No one dared to bring up any questions relating to the topic again.\u201cMissus Wen, after leading 15 years of a wandering life, you have finally returned to the Wen Family. However, the Wen Family did not make any official announcements of your return. Also, you have recently moved to your Grampy, Old Master Mo\u2019s place to stay. What\u2019s the reason for that?\u201dThe Wen Family had remained silent ever since the start of this scandal and did not make any clarifications to the public. It was no wonder everyone had to make wild guesses.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen Wen Xinya was about to respond, Old Mr. Wen interrupted with a deep tone in his voice. \u201cXinya is the Wen Family\u2019s own flesh and blood, and she\u2019s also the only heir to the family. This is an undoubted truth. The only reason we have not announced her return to the public is that I had planned to organize a banquet event on the 28th of next month to formally introduce her to the media and the public. She has just returned to the Wen Family not long ago and requires some time to adapt herself. If I had made any announcements earlier, that might have caused her unnecessary stress. I hope the public will stop making any wild guesses on this topic.\u201dOld Mr. Wen was the head of the Wen Family. Thus, his words spoke with authority and carried tremendous weight. His answer captured the reporters\u2019 emotions, causing the cameras to flash non-stop.This caused the corner of Wen Xinya\u2019s lips to raise and smile slightly. However, the smile disappeared very quickly. \u201cThe main reason I moved to stay with Grampy is that I am the only kin Grampy has now. I have wanted to show him filial piety on my mother\u2019s behalf. Another reason is that I wanted to take this opportunity to catch up on my studies and all the things I have missed out during my earlier years. By staying with Grampy, I can learn a lot from him, so that I can live up to my title of \u2018the Young Missus Wen from the Wen Family.\u2019\u201dOld Mr. Wen watched how Wen Xinya behaved when facing the reporters. She was able to handle it well and had a great demeanor. She was careful with her words and did not say anything that might cause disgrace to herself or the Wen Family. She\u2026 had performed even better than he had expected.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Very quickly, it had reached almost every known website and blog on the internet.The news that caught the most public attention was the comment made by Old Mr. Mo.Everyone that had shown interest was expecting the arrival of the banquet event and the official announcement of Wen Xinya\u2019s return.On some blog posts, somebody even commented with huge emotions. \u201cWen Xinya V5. The media is getting out of hand. They\u2019re just dumping any reports, disregarding the public\u2019s right to be aware of the truth. Are they treating us like a dumping ground? Why hasn\u2019t the National News Agency stepped into this matter?\u201d\u201cHow ridiculous! She\u2019s just an underaged teenager. How could the media do this? They described it as a scandalous event over a simple dinner with a friend! I\u2019m wearing a bracelet on my wrist now, and it\u2019s a gift from an ex-schoolmate. Teenagers\u2019 friendships are pure and direct. Why do the adults have to look at it in such a complicated way? We hope that the media industry would allow more breathing space to the younger generations, and not use their dirty thinking to bring insult to pure relationships.\u201cThis is my opinion on the entire episode of this scandal \u2014 someone had an ulterior motive and intentionally made use of the media to harm her, who had been leading a wandering life for the past 15 years. Even though she returned to the Wen Family, they made no official announcements of her return. If Wen Xinya fell into an abyss of rumors and scandals, her status as the \u2018Young Missus Wen from the Wen Family\u2019 would be greatly impacted. Guess who are the ones that will greatly benefit if that happens?\u201d\u201cStepmother! Stepsister!\u201d\u201cStepmother! Stepsister!\u201dAnd the same comments came flooding in from below.As Wen Yuya was looking for news updates on Wen Xinya\u2019s scandals and court case, she saw these floods of comments on social media. When she saw the news and found out what happened, she turned pale with anger, almost slamming her cell phone on the floor.She angrily replied to the same blog post and added her comment. \u201cIf you continue to spout nonsense, I\u2019ll sue you for slander!\u201dThe owner of the blog instantly replied, \u201cI did not refer to any names nor said it was you. If you\u2019re guilty and like to make assumptions, well, that\u2019s nothing to do with me! Go ahead and sue me for slander. See if you can successfully take me to court and write you a public apology, or compensate you 10 million dollars.\u201dThe readers continued commenting below. \u201cAre you the stepsister? It was said that Wen Xinya and yourself are always against each other. I\u2019ve read what you posted in your social media platform previously. You said she was an unrefined person.\u201dAfter seeing these comments, Wen Yuya regretted her impulsiveness in replying to the posts earlier. She immediately checked her previous social media posts, planning to delete any comments she made about Wen Xinya.Before she even had time to take any actions, Wen Yuya\u2019s social media account was found by someone. She had made numerous comments about how uncouth and badly behaved Wen Xinya was. They even took screenshots of what she said and posted them on the current discussion group. Some even proceeded to share these screenshots to their friends.At this time, people were talking about how Wen Xinya and Wen Yuya argued at the entrance of Pearl Mall. There was even a video clip of what happened in Jo-ramst.\u201cOh my God! I have never seen anything like this, or is it me who isn\u2019t able to catch up with the times? How can an adopted daughter act with such arrogance and disregard toward the family who\u2019ve brought her up? Look at the way she ridiculed and insulted the true Missus Wen. What is most shocking to me was that the stepmother chose to remain silent. She had always tried to portray a generous and kind image in public, but I think she\u2019s just as wicked as Snow White\u2019s stepmother.\u201d\u201cHey the previous commenter, don\u2019t be amazed. In today\u2019s society, wicked stepmothers treating their stepdaughters nastily is a real common sight. That particular Miss Third-party must have made plans 15 years ago. When the original wife of the Mr. Heir of X corporation was pregnant, she took the chance to seduce Mr. Heir and thus caused the original wife to die of dystocia. When she was dead for less than half a year, Mr. Heir and Miss Third-party happily married. What makes you think she\u2019s a generous and kind person? I suggest you update yourself by reading the latest news!\u201d\u201cI hate third-parties, especially those that seduce married men. B*tch, b*tch, b*tch\u2026 multiply by ten thousand times!\u201d\u201cYes, multiply that by ten thousand times!\u201dWen Yuya\u2019s face turned pale.Xia Ruya exclaimed with disbelief. \u201cI don\u2019t believe Aunt Ning is like what they have described. She and Uncle Wen got together because of true love. What\u2019s wrong with that? Why do they have to insult Aunt Ning this way? Xinya has gone overboard.\u201dIt sounded as if everything was caused by Wen Xinya.Wen Yuya clenched her teeth. \u201cIt\u2019s all because of Wen Xinya, that b*tch. If it weren\u2019t for her, my mother would not have been insulted this way. That wretch Mo Yunyao is to be blamed too. She could not even retain the heart of the man she loved. What has that got to do with my mother? They\u2019re even saying my mother was responsible for that wretch\u2019s death.\u201dXia Ruya agreed. \u201cThe Mo Family has a history of dystocia. Old Madam Mo died of dystocia too. How could they put the blame on Aunt Ning?\u201dWen Yuya was furious. \u201cI\u2019m mad! How can these people do this to my mother?\u201dXia Ruya, who was right beside Wen Yuya, noticed her pale face and was worried. \u201cForget it, Yuya. Comments on social media can\u2019t be serious. After a few days, it\u2019ll be over. Don\u2019t be too affected by it.\u201d She advised.Wen Yuya responded in anger. \u201cHow can I let it go? Wen Xinya got my mother in this state. I will not let her off.\u201dXia Ruya felt uneasy and fearful. She held her hand and said, \u201cYuya, I think it\u2019s best to forget about it. It seems like Xinya is not a person to be dealt with. Do you remember our few direct clashes with her? Not one of them ended in our favor.\u201dAt the mention of the previous incidents, Wen Yuya got even angrier. \u201cShe\u2019s just a wild sparrow who managed to get into higher grounds. What good can she make? I\u2019m not as afraid of her as you are.\u201dXia Ruya tried to explain herself. \u201cYuya, it is not that I\u2019m afraid of her. I\u2019m just worried about you getting into Grandpa\u2019s bad books because of this. Grandpa has already made an official announcement publicly acknowledging Xinya as the only rightful heir to the Wen Family, and the banquet event is happening soon. Grandpa is on her side now.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Yuya was fuming now. \u201cSo what if she has Grandpa\u2019s support? In the Wen Family, only Grandpa acknowledges her. Grandma and Father have always disliked her.\u201dWith sorrow in her eyes, Xia Ruya bitterly bit her lip. \u201cBecause of her, Grandpa forbid me to visit Grandma at the Wen Family\u2019s bungalow. Recently, Grandma has also kept her distance from me. I\u2019m just afraid that Grandpa will drive you out of the Wen Family if you do something against his will,\u201d she said.Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes were filled with determination and hatred. \u201cThat\u2019s because Grandpa isn\u2019t aware of what kind of person she is. He\u2019s blinded. If only we could let Grandpa see to her true colors, he will not like her anymore.\u201dWhen Xia Ruya saw the determination in her eyes, she was delighted. However, she immediately lowered her head and took a sip of coffee from the cup to conceal her feelings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This allowed the media to go overboard and the matter to get out of control. When she finally took action against them, she achieved results that surprised everyone. Her ability to strategize and remain calm during turbulent times has shown her tough character indeed,\u201d he said.Old Master Xu\u2019s eyes gleamed with admiration. \u201cThere\u2019s wisdom in the saying \u2014 The newest waves of the Changjiang River are stronger than the earlier waves. It means that the new generation excels the previous one. She has led a wandering life for the past 15 years and has just returned to the Wen Family recently. Those within the circle will naturally expect her behavior to be below expectation. She managed to make use of this incident to turn things around. Apart from teaching the media a lesson, she also established a firm position and her status in the circle. I believe no one will dare look down on her ever again.\u201dXu Wenfeng sighed and added, \u201cZhenyu has also changed a lot for the better because of her. Now I have less worry for him getting into trouble outside.\u201dOld Master Xu nodded. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I heard from Mofeng that Zhenyu likes her a lot. I\u2019ve also seen Zhenyu acting more mature than before when dealing with her matters. I\u2019ll have a nice chat with him another day.\u201d\u201cThank you, Father. Zhenyu is a stubborn child, and he only listens to you. If you can talk to him, that\u2019ll be good,\u201d said Xu Wenfeng with appreciation.In the evening, Wen Xinya booked a VIP room at Ninth Heaven for the gathering with Xu Zhenyu and their friends.\u201cEveryone, please go ahead and order your favorite food and drinks. Tonight is on me.\u201d Wen Xinya announced. At the same time, she ordered the most expensive dishes on the menu, and then passed the menu to Zhou Tianyu.\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019ll comply with your request. I intentionally skipped lunch to prepare for the sumptuous meal tonight,\u201d said Gu Junlin. Then, he proceeded to order a few famous dishes on the menu.\u201cLet\u2019s enjoy ourselves tonight and not worry about helping Xinya save money. She has won the verdict today and will be compensated with a huge sum of money. Just a dinner like this is considered the tip of the iceberg.\u201d Han Mofeng added, and then he ordered a few cartons of expensive red wine together with some Chinese alcohols.Xu Zhenyu saw that everyone was in high spirits and was worried that they would go over the limit. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. You guys ordered so much food that, if we can\u2019t finish and have to throw them away, it\u2019ll be so wasteful!\u201dZhou Tianyu winked at Wen Xinya and replied, \u201cAiyo, you\u2019re not the one footing the bill tonight. Why are you feeling the pinch? When you paid in the past, it didn\u2019t seem like you were concerned with being wasteful. Why have you changed\u2026 Are you trying to save now?\u201dZhou Tianyu\u2019s words caused a burst of laughter in the room. Xu Zhenyu stood firm and replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with saving? This is one of the best habits one could cultivate in our country. All of you should be re-educated by your parents on how to cultivate better saving habits.\u201dEveryone was amused at Second Young Master Xu\u2019s reaction. Ling Qingxuan even pointed at Xu Zhenyu and reprimanded him with a smile. \u201cAre you telling us to be thrifty? You\u2019re humiliating the meaning of the word.\u201d\u201cXu-er is asking all of you to be thrifty because he feels the pinch for Xinya if she spends too much. He is just beating around the bush to help her save some money. It isn\u2019t easy on him, so let\u2019s stop laughing at him,\u201d said Mo Hanfeng in a serious tone.\u201cAre you courting death, Han Mofeng!\u201d Xu Zhenyu raised his leg and gave Han Mofeng a kick.Zhou Tianyu showed Wen Xinya a blog post. \u201cThis is Xu-er\u2019s work.\u201dWen Xinya took a look and noticed it was one of the popular and most-visited blog posts badmouthing Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya. \u201cOh? Is this the video clip of the previous commenter above?\u201dZhou Tianyu was surprised too. \u201cIt was probably taken by a passerby during one of your confrontations with them. The commoners have always been interested in the fights between the wealthy families.\u201dWen Xinya laughed. \u201cXu-er is really talented. Though he did not manage to get Ning Shuqian to show her true colors in the public eyes, these posts have already given her a bad name. She must be troubled over these comments, and I guess she\u2019ll slowly start to lose her position in the circle.\u201dZhou Tianyu continued, \u201cThe people in the circle despise third parties like Ning Shuqian who seduce married men. Though some of the affluent families in the circle have dealings with Ning Shuqian on the surface, their Madams have never been close to her.\u201dRight at this moment, Wen Xinya suddenly understood the real reason for Ning Shuqian\u2019s deep hatred towards her mother. Though she was married into the Wen Family, she could never give up the title of being a third party and would not be wholly accepted by others in the circle. This had tortured her and caused her great pain; even more than that of death. Because of this, she deeply resented Wen Xinya\u2019s mother and avenged it on her. That was why Wen Xinya got into a sorry state in her previous life.While everyone was happily chatting and enjoying themselves, the food and alcohol were served.Wen Xinya poured some wine into everyone\u2019s glasses and filled her own. After that, she raised her glass high and said, \u201cI got a victory this time because of you. Thank you for all your help. This is a toast to all of you. Cheers!\u201dSoon after she finished talking, she drank and finished the wine in one go.Han Mofeng clapped and cheered. \u201cGreat! Well done!\u201dGu Junlin smiled. \u201cWe didn\u2019t help much. The biggest credit goes to Qingxuan. You should really give him another toast.\u201dLing Qingxuan quickly replied, \u201cIn this era, every artiste in the entertainment industry is affected by scandals and fabricated news reports made up by some unethical reporters. These artistes hate the reporters for using unscrupulous methods. We have just aired a few video clips of some artistes who were willing to speak up on your behalf. It is none of my credit.\u201dLingyun Media and Entertainment Company belonged to the Ling Family, and they were the leader of the industry in the country. In recent years, the industry of movies and television entertainment was thriving, and the Ling Family had focused on growing their businesses with the trend.\u201cRegardless, I\u2019m still grateful for your help.\u201d Wen Xinya raised her glass and gave him a toast.Wen Xinya toasted every one of them, including Gu Junlin and Han Mofeng. After a few glasses of wine, though she was not feeling tipsy yet, her face was warm.When she was about to give a toast to Zhou Tianyu, Zhou Tianyu held her hand down. \u201cIf you really wish to thank me, please request your Grampy to write me a piece of Chinese calligraphy on my behalf! Your Grampy\u2019s Yan-Style calligraphy strokes are thick and powerful, aggressive yet orderly, thin but dominant, assertive and with principle and ambition. His calligraphy skills are incomparable. It was all because of Old Master Mo that I got inspired to learn the Yan-Style calligraphy strokes during my younger days.\u201dGu Junlin burst into laughter. \u201cShe is your Grampy\u2019s super silly fan-girl.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhou Tianyu gave Gu Junlin a kick. \u201cGo to hell. Who did you call silly? Old Master Mo is a well-respected teacher. Only those who are intelligent are worthy to be his fans. Otherwise, it\u2019ll be an insult to Old Master Mo.\u201dWen Xinya burst into laughter as well. \u201cHaha. Are you praising my Grampy, or are you actually giving compliments to yourself for being intelligent?\u201dZhou Tianyu pointed at herself and asked, \u201cDo I really look silly?\u201dGu Junlin leaned forward and looked at her face closely. \u201cOh?

Gu Junlin, you\u2019re dead meat.\u201d Wen Xinya burst out laughing. She laughed so hard that her body curled up on the sofa. Gu Junlin and Zhou Tianyu always had a love-hate relationship. They could not stop teasing each other.Upon hearing that, Zhou Tianyu pounced on Gu Junlin on the sofa and started bashing him up. Gu Junlin yelled hysterically. \u201cDon\u2019t hit my face. Don\u2019t hit my face\u2026 I go out in the streets if you punch my already ordinary-looking face\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn it. I can\u2019t forgive myself if I don\u2019t punch the acne out of you.\u201dGu Junlin and Zhou Tianyu started the ball rolling, and the entire ambiance in the room instantly became lively.As Wen Xinya had consumed a fair bit of alcohol, Zhou Tianyu quickly brought her a bowl of fish soup. \u201cDrink slowly, or you will get drunk easily. If you get drunk, I shall not be responsible for sending you home.\u201dGu Junlin gently glanced towards Xu Zhenyu. \u201cThat\u2019s alright, someone else will take the responsibility to do it.\u201dUnderstanding what he meant, Zhou Tianyu glared at him and said, \u201cHe\u2019s always the one who drinks the most and get drunk first.\u201dXu Zhenyu watched Wen Xinya and his gang happily chatting away. It reminded him of his dream. Though it was only a dream, it was intense, and his emotions felt so real that he could hardly breathe.\u201cXu-er, Xu-er\u2026\u201dWhen Xu Zhenyu finally came out of his daze, he saw everyone looking at him. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys eating or drinking? Why are you staring at me?\u201d He shouted.Wen Xinya took a piece of fish for Xu Zhenyu and removed all the bones before placing it in his bowl. \u201cWe\u2019re all here to have some fun. Why are you sitting and looking gloomy all by yourself?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine. I was just deep in thought.\u201d Wen Xinya\u2019s actions startled Xu Zhenyu. How did she know that he liked to eat fish but hated the bones? It seemed like\u2026 she had already done these actions during his previous birthday celebration.Zhou Tianyu and the rest saw something fishy was going on between them and wanted to tease Xu-er. Wen Xinya continued to give them food; their favorite food. Including the previous round, this was only the second time she joined their gathering.\u201cHey, have you watched the latest movie, \u2018Young Memories\u2019? It is a small production. The supporting actor did an awesome job winning the audience over.\u201d Wen Xinya conversed casually as she held on to her wine glass.According to what Wen Xinya remembered, the male supporting actor in \u201cYoung Memories\u201d was trying to get into Hollywood together with a group of local superstars. He became famous overnight and was a highly sought-after actor 10 years later. Ling Qingxuan had rendered her a great help this time, and she wanted to return him the favor.Indeed, Ling Qingxuan showed great interest. \u201cHe must have been pretty good to be able to earn our Young Missus Wen\u2019s praise. I\u2019ll look into it in more detail later.\u201dWen Xinya was not worried that Ling Qingxuan would miss this opportunity. She had spent time with them and got to know them better. On the surface, they appeared to be like rich playboys. But other than Xu-er, who was more of a pushover, the rest excelled in their own industries.As they continued chatting happily, the conversation shifted to the real estates in the West Coast area. Wen Xinya mentioned a little about the future growth in that area. When she noticed Gu Junlin deep in thought, she smiled and stopped elaborating further.Wen Xinya\u2019s face became warm after a lot of drinking. Thus, she slowly walked to the balcony and enjoyed the cool breeze blowing gently on her face. It felt comfortable.Xu Zhenyu walked towards her and stood by her side. He took a stick of cigarette from his bag and lit up a matchstick. The flickering, blue flame brightened up his face, revealing a melancholy look.Wen Xinya snatched the cigarette from his hand and put it out. \u201cHow old are you? You actually picked up the bad habit of smoking.\u201dXu Zhenyu looked at his empty fingers and was dumbfounded. After a short moment, he asked, \u201cDo you think I am useless?\u201dIn this incident of Wen Xinya\u2019s scandal, Han Mofeng, Gu Junlin, Zhou Tianyu, and Ling Qingxuan had all helped and contributed to her victory, except him. He started to realize the widening gap between himself and his playmates who grew up with him. Everyone was becoming more successful except him, and he did not feel good about it.\u201cXu-er, this incident has nothing to do with you, and it wasn\u2019t your fault. It was Ning Shuqian, who is always waiting for an opportunity to bring me down. You became involved in this incident all because of me. Quit bothering about it.\u201d Wen Xinya was aware of his strong ego and knew that he could not get over it.The real reason he was greatly affected was that his past notorious acts were being made use of by the media to attack her. And this caused him to make a decision. \u201cWen Xinya, after attending your introductory banquet event, I will join the military.\u201dWen Xinya was taken aback. \u201cYou will only be 18 next year. Why are you in such a hurry to join the military?\u201dIn her previous life, Xu Zhenyu did not join the army but became the city\u2019s notorious rich loafer. After her rebirth, she had always wanted to help him change his destiny, but she did not expect Xu Zhenyu to have already made up his mind.Joining the military was the best decision for Xu Zhenyu. The Xu family had great influential power in the military so his career would be smooth-sailing. All he needed was to train for a couple of years, participate in a few operations, and achieve military merits, then he would be able to rise through the ranks easily.Xu Zhenyu looked into her eyes with mixed emotions. \u201cI have been living these years ridiculously and made my Grandpa and my parents worry a lot for me. This time, my bad reputation from my past negative behaviors has affected you a great deal. I don\u2019t know when it will cause a negative effect on my family. Joining the military earlier might do me good. Some military training would help strengthen myself up and let my family have a peace of mind.\u201dGu Junlin was right. A woman like Wen Xinya was destined to be extraordinary. He needed to have strong capabilities to be able to match up to her.\u201cThat\u2019s good. We need to have control of our own destiny through achievements.\u201d Wen Xinya was thinking about the Xu Zhenyu in her previous life. If he already had achievements, he would not have met her. And therefore, he would not have a bad ending.Wen Xinya was not a fool. She was aware of Xu Zhenyu\u2019s feelings for her in her previous life. However, she was unable to accept his love because she could not forget another man. Moreover, she was at the bottom of the pit. How could she have reciprocated his feelings? Afterward, when Xu Zhenyu went to jail because of her, she felt grateful yet full of remorse. This sense of gratefulness and remorse gave her strength to face the sufferings of her drug addiction. She started a three years journey of drug rehabilitation. Alas, she did not succeed but died of heart failure when Xia Ruya injected a high dosage of a lethal drug into her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhile she was recollecting the past, she took a deep breath. Hopefully, Xu Zhenyu would be able to change his destiny this time!She hoped that he could be in control of his own destiny and be forever happy!Xu Zhenyu looked into her eyes and said in a serious tone, \u201cYou are right. Only people with capabilities can control their own destiny.\u201dWen Xinya was stunned. She had the weird feeling that Xu Zhenyu\u2019s words had a hidden meaning. Could it be she was worrying unnecessarily?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had a tall and slim figure and looked charming, matured and composed. There was a unique, enchanting sense of elegance in him.Wen Xinya subconsciously looked at the baby blue silk pajamas she was wearing, feeling like something was going on between the two of them. At this thought, she instantly blushed. She stared at Si Yiyan. \u201cWhat are you doing in my room? Quickly get out. I\u2019m going to sleep soon.\u201dSi Yiyan placed the bookmark back on the original page where Wen Xinya had stopped reading earlier. Then, he put the book on the table and looked at her. She was wearing a baby blue suspender pajamas, revealing the beautiful pure jade white skin from her neck onwards. The contour of her collarbone and neck was mesmerizing. She was lean and petite, an absolutely perfect God\u2019s creation. She had a beautiful skin tone, and it seemed to glow like jade under the light.He locked his vision on her and slowly moved downwards. Then, his sight locked on the two little Shanghai buns in front of her and smiled.\u201cWhat are you looking at, thug?!\u201d Her face immediately turned red as she could feel someone staring at her chest. Subconsciously, she put her hands in front of her chest and stared at him. \u201cThough it\u2019s small, I\u2019m still going through puberty. It\u2019ll definitely grow to 34B afterward.\u201dShe was 34B in her previous life. Though she could not be compared to other busty women, she still had a rather voluptuous figure. Hold on\u2026 What was she talking about? Why did she have to tell him that?Wen Xinya\u2019s face immediately blushed. It was a shameful moment for her, and she would do anything to take back her words. It was so embarrassing that it could not have been worse.\u201cMm! I know. You\u2019re still young and growing. Strive to grow them to 34D.\u201d Si Yiyan smiled and looked at Wen Xinya with love and passion in his eyes.For women, 34 was a nice and mysterious number. 34D would bring out the perfect curvy shape in a woman. They do not judge their body by its size, but by how perfect their shape was. She had a well-developed bone structure and body frame. Such a body could be expected to further develop into a beautiful and ideal shape in the future.\u201cWhat has it got to do with you whether I\u2019m 34D or not?\u201d Wen Xinya was furious. She put up a sissy tone and continued, \u201cYo, I didn\u2019t expect our Young Master Si to be so well aware that 34D represents the perfect ratio of an oriental lady. You have indeed done quite a lot of study on this topic!\u201d Then she gave him a hard stare and mumbled. \u201cPervert. Sick!\u201dSi Yiyan smiled back at her and responded with a flirtatious look. \u201cI don\u2019t know about the others. As for you\u2026\u201d While he was speaking, he also looked up and down to size up her body. \u201cFrom the very first day, I have already been studying.\u201d\u201cSpat! You pervert!\u201d Wen Xinya turned red with anger and stomped her feet. She thought she must be crazy to be alone in the same room with him, discussing the topic of physical development of the female body. \u201cGet out. When did you get the permission to come into my room as you wish?\u201dSi Yiyan laughed and replied in a low tone, \u201cI did not come in as I wish. It was Mother He who asked me to bring you dessert.\u201dInitially, it was Mother He who should be bringing the dessert to her room. Si Yiyan just happened to pass by and took over the job from Mother He.Wen Xinya started to get concerned. Mother He liked to make desserts and supper for her. It was two months since she stayed at the Mo bungalow and had already put on some weight. If this continued, she would become obese.Si Yiyan watched her staring at the supper on the table and understood her concern. He was not agreeable for girls to have dessert for supper as well. It was not because he did not want her to put on weight, he was just worried that overeating sweet food at night would affect the quality of sleep. \u201cMother He spent a lot of effort preparing supper for you. If you reject it, she won\u2019t be happy about it. However\u2026\u201dWen Xinya asked, \u201cHowever what?\u201dSi Yiyan smiled. \u201cIf someone really doesn\u2019t want to eat, I\u2019m glad to help. Mother He would not know who finished it anyway.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes gleamed with joy. \u201cGreat. Go ahead and finish it. I shall forgive you for barging into my room late at night.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Si Yiyan raised the bowl of dessert and gulped it down in less than three mouthfuls.Wen Xinya was aware that Si Yiyan did not have a sweet tooth. He did not usually eat any of the desserts Mother He prepared.As Si Yiyan saw that her hair was still dripping wet, he turned around and took the hairdryer. \u201cCome and sit over here. Let me help you blow your hair dry!\u201d\u201cOh! Okay!\u201d At the mention of it, she suddenly realized the coldness on her back. Her hair was still wet, and it made her uncomfortable. Since he had offered to help her, she would be glad to accept his offer.Si Yiyan turned on the hairdryer and set it to the right temperature. He then gently raised her hair and blew it dry with care.Though it was supposed to be a silent hairdryer, it gave out a soft buzzing sound right beside her ear. It felt like a warm breeze in the summer, and she felt warm and comfortable.She could feel Si Yiyan\u2019s fingers weaving in between her hair, doing it gently and carefully so as not to hurt her. At that moment, she could feel the love and pamper he was giving to her.Realizing her thoughts started to derail, she shook her head lightly, trying to dispel these thoughts.It was all silent in the room as Si Yiyan softly said, \u201cIn the future, do remember to dry your hair and don\u2019t sleep with it wet. It is not good for your health, and you might catch a cold. In some situations, you might even experience pain in your scalp or giddiness.\u201dWen Xinya subconsciously tried to explain herself. \u201cI don\u2019t usually sleep with my hair wet. I just occasionally forget.\u201dSi Yiyan gave her a serious look. \u201cNo. Not even occasionally.\u201dWen Xinya pouted. \u201cHey! You\u2019re overbearing! I can\u2019t help it if it\u2019s occasionally.\u201dAs her hair dried, Si Yiyan used his fingers to run through them. He could feel the soft and silky texture of her hair as if his heart was bundled in by them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs it done?\u201d asked Wen Xinya.\u201cMm. It\u2019s done! It\u2019s getting late. Rest early.\u201d Si Yiyan removed his fingers, feeling empty. He suddenly felt a sense of disappointment.Wen Xinya looked at him. She took a deep breath and smiled. \u201cThank you!\u201dSi Yiyan nodded and left her room. He walked past the viburnum tree and turned around to see the lights going off in her room. His heart sank for a moment. He raised his hands close to his nose and sniffed, the mild fragrance from her hair lingering in his palm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Five million dollars was borne by Changjiang Press Media, while the remaining amount was borne by the rest of the media press companies. Several smaller companies closed down because of their incapability of paying their portion.Lanxin Investment Corporation had been successfully set up, and its businesses activities were getting into the right track. As Ouyang Feng had good investment strategies, Wen Xinya entrusted most of her capital assets to him for investment purposes. Though he had lost three years of his life in prison, this experience had also helped to change him into a less reckless person. He was more mature and analytical in his thinking. These were essential traits that an investor should possess.Wen Xinya guessed that one of the reasons Ouyang Feng was able to succeed in her previous life was also because of this.Right at the same time, Ouyang Feng\u2019s case had been successfully submitted to the Supreme Court for appeal and was approved! Wen Xinya was introduced to a few managers of some press companies through Ling Qingxuan \u2014 she had accidentally revealed to them that the defendant attorney of Ouyang Feng\u2019s case would be Cheng Ziyi. Overnight, this became a focus of attention and hot news that every press media company hurried to publish.The media had always been responsible. These media companies had published numerous articles about how Ouyang Feng\u2019s partners made use of his company for money laundering activities in 2008. They also published every information about Ouyang Feng, including his academic success and qualifications. Everyone soon knew about his background.Everybody was saying how impressed they were \u2014 an ordinary student from the lower-class society who worked hard and was enroled into the Imperial College London by invitation, completing his doctorate in finance faculty in three years. He truly deserved the title of \u201cFinancial Genius.\u201dThe public also became aware of Ouyang Feng\u2019s new company \u2014 Lanxin Investment Corporation. A few large corporations and low profiled wealthy men also took notice of this new big-scale investment company.In recent years, the economy in Country M had greatly benefited from the finance and investment industry. Many large corporations and some of the low profiled wealthiest men in the country started to become involved in multiple investment projects in the country. A graduate from the Imperial College London like Ouyang Feng definitely caught their attention!All of these events were part of Wen Xinya\u2019s plan. She had wanted to make use of the court case of Ouyang Feng\u2019s appeal to create a buzz in the media. However, she did not expect the involvement of Cheng Ziyi \u2014 a golden bachelor in the lawyer industry \u2014 to build even more hype to the news.Though these corporations and a few of the riches were just in a \u201cwait and see\u201d mindset, she believed that once Ouyang Feng successfully appealed for his case, there would soon be many incoming investments to test the capabilities of their investment company. It was only a matter of time for them to grow and expand.Qiu Yifan and Ouyang Feng soon realized Wen Xinya\u2019s intention and both exclaimed at her wild ambition. Was she really just a 15-year-old teenage girl?\u201cQuite a few press companies are wanting to do an interview with me.\u201d Ouyang Feng looked at the young lady in front of him with complex emotions. From the first time he met her, he knew she was not an ordinary person and could not be judged by just her age. Indeed\u2026 she was extremely capable of guiding others into her manipulations. She was able to lead the flow of matters toward the direction of her plan. This was true in her recent scandalous incident and also how she managed to make use of the media to publicize Ouyang Feng\u2019s case.\u201cReject any requests for an interview. Your case will soon be trialed in court, this is not a good time for you to accept interviews. Though our company has just produced some results, we\u2019re not at the stage where we can show massive achievements yet. The purpose of creating hype is just to attract the public\u2019s attention. Your academic qualifications are to be praised indeed, but you have not created any accomplishments worthy for the media to create a buzz. You don\u2019t have to worry about whatever the media says about you. Just focus and do your part for now.\u201dWen Xinya was looking at a news article. It was a report about Ouyang Feng being complimented by the famous lecturer Huo Er while he was studying at the Imperial College London. He was indeed a financial genius who had been highly endorsed by the college\u2019s lecturer. It was no wonder the media was interested to find out more about him.Ouyang Feng understood and agreed with her, and had already rejected all the interview requests. \u201cI have invested a majority of the funds you entrusted to me earlier into a newly listed company in the country. This company is involved in green renewable energy. Though its share price is low, it has high potential.\u201dWen Xinya dropped the newspaper in her hands and looked at Ouyang Feng in astonishment. She vaguely remembered in her previous life, the National Agency of Environment had initiated a green renewable energy movement and implemented a series of related policies. After that, the industry grew rapidly, and many products related to green renewable energy were introduced to the market. She did not expect Ouyang Feng to be able to predict the market trend so accurately.Ouyang Feng noticed Wen Xinya\u2019s surprise. \u201cI\u2019ve found out that this company has recently requested for a loan from a National Bank due to insufficient funds. The loan was approved very quickly, and the loan amount is huge. Therefore, I predicted that the government would soon launch a series of policies relating to green renewable energy. When that happens, the share price will increase at an exponential rate.\u201d\u201cI trust your judgment.\u201d Wen Xinya was starting to see more of Ouyang Feng\u2019s capabilities.Ouyang Feng was also happy that he was able to gain such a high level of trust.\u201cOuyang Feng, please help me employ a personal assistant. I would like to get a male assistant, and he has to be around his 30s. He should be competent and with good character. I do not have any other requests.\u201d Wen Xinya had given it some thought. She was now considered to be an asset owner. It would be best for her to assign someone else to accomplish some of the tasks that she could not do by herself.\u201cI do have someone in mind.\u201d Ouyang Feng replied after some consideration.\u201cOh, if he\u2019s someone recommended by you, I believe he will be a good choice. Arrange for him to meet me some other day! I have some tasks for him at hand.\u201d Wen Xinya trusted Ouyang Feng\u2019s judgment.\u201cHe has a unique condition, however. He is a graduate from the Harvard Business Management School in Country M, is knowledgeable, and can be considered to be an all-rounder. He\u2019s now a freelancer doing data analysis for a few small enterprises. I met him after I was released from the prison at the back alley where you\u2019ve found me.\u201dWen Xinya was intrigued. Could she have the opportunity to meet another genius character? \u201cSince he\u2019s so competent, why is he working as a freelancer with small enterprises?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s not up to me to comment. You\u2019ll find out when you see him.\u201d Ouyang Feng appeared secretive.\u201cCould it be because he has an unusual habit?\u201d Wen Xinya could not help but guess. It was common for geniuses to either have some unusual habits or unique past experiences. Take Ouyang Feng for example, he was in prison previously.After spending some time with Wen Xinya, Ouyang Feng knew her better. He could guess what she was thinking and laughed bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s best that you meet him personally to find out more.\u201dWen Xinya nodded in agreement. In the story of Kingdom of Romance, Liu Bei had to pay Zhuge Liang three visits before the latter agreed to join his army as an advisor. She knew that recruiting capable people was the way to succeed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The more she tried to absorb the classical Chinese words, the more frustrated she became. She threw the book on the table and tossed in her bed. After a while, she reluctantly picked up the book and started reading again. But somehow, she just could not calm her frustration.Wen Xinya was cuddling her blanket and tossed on the bed for some time. Suddenly, she heard classical music from a distance away. The soothing music immediately swept away all her frustration.Wen Xinya put on her shoes, ran to the courtyard, and saw Si Yiyan playing the Chinese zither under the sycamore tree.The zither was placed under the sycamore tree by Wen Xinya. She even joked with Grampy that the sycamore was an elegant object, and playing the zither by the sycamore was the greatest pleasure of all! Grampy had specially ordered the servants to shift the marble table and chairs from under the sycamore tree to that of the viburnum tree. The sycamore tree became her favorite spot for practicing the zither.Though Grampy had mentioned that Si Yiyan excelled in calligraphy and chess, she had never expected that he could also play the zither so well. Wen Xinya felt defeated for a moment.Si Yiyan belonged to a unique type of human beings who were born to defeat the masses.As the song came to an end, Wen Xinya looked at Si Yiyan with sarcasm in her eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s an ancient saying that the zither\u2019s music could enhance one\u2019s pleasure and his aura of elegance. Young Master Si is already a distinguished gentleman, you don\u2019t seem to need to enhance your aura of elegance further, do you?\u201dAfter listening to her words, Si Yiyan burst into laughter. \u201cA gentleman is always seeking pleasure and opportunity to enhance his elegance, and I\u2019m no different.\u201dWen Xinya became speechless at his cheekiness.\u201cXinya, you don\u2019t understand enough about men. A gentleman is always looking to be arty and distinguished to attract women\u2019s attention,\u201d said Si Yiyan as he walked towards her. His well-defined eyebrows exuded a tinge of elegance, and there was a flow of hidden emotions behind it.\u201cMother He and Mother Jiang don\u2019t know how to appreciate the zither\u2019s music, you\u2019re wasting your time and effort.\u201d The Mo\u2019s bungalow was huge, and she was the only person who could appreciate Si Yiyan\u2019s talent in music. He tried beating around the bush to let her know that it was her attention he wished to attract. However, she pretended that she did not understand him and intentionally mentioned Mother He and Mother Jiang as a cover-up.Si Yiyan laughed gently. He reached out and brushed the messy hair by her cheeks to the back of her ears. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t appreciate it. Your appreciation is what matters most to me.\u201dAs the rough skin on his fingers brushed against her cheeks and ears, she could feel a slight itch, and her ears turned warm quickly. She guessed that her ears must be obviously red by now.She quickly took a step back. \u201cI have some matters to attend to. I\u2019ll inform Grampy shortly.\u201dHaving said that, she walked off hurriedly.Ouyang Feng brought Wen Xinya to that alley and knocked against a run-down door; its condition was so bad that it covered almost nothing.After a long time, the door finally opened inwards with a creaking sound. Wen Xinya was able to see a man standing beside the door clearly, looking hideous beyond description. He was very tall, with an estimated height of about 1.8 meters. He was around 26 or 27, had sagging eye bags, a slightly slanted nose, and a cleft in his lower lip. Anyone of these defects did not look that bad. However, when it all came together, it was a rather pathetic sight.Wen Xinya finally understood why a genius like him had to earn a living by doing freelancing jobs for small enterprises. No matter how talented he was, with such a hideous look, it was unlikely any organization would employ him.Wen Xinya stretched out her hand and smiled. \u201cHello, I\u2019m Wen Xinya.\u201dThe man looked at the young lady. He was aware of her recent scandalous news, and could not believe she was Wen Xinya. His hands started to sweat, and he subconsciously rubbed and dried his hands before shaking hers. \u201cYan Shaoqing.\u201dXinya was astounded by Yan Shaoqing\u2019s crisp and distinct voice \u2014 it sounded like music to the ears. \u201cOuyang Feng has mentioned to me about you. I\u2019m interested in your capabilities.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 come in and take a seat!\u201d Yan Shaoqing looked directly into Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes. He had expected her to show a disdained, fearful and disgusted look. But he was disappointed. She looked back into his eyes, and from her eyes, there was a sense of calmness like the water on a lake.Wen Xinya entered Yan Shaoqing\u2019s room with a smile. Though the room was small, it was neat and organized. 80% of the room was filled with piles of books, magazines, and newspapers, and there was a bed, a cooker, and some utensils. Simple yet spotlessly clean.Yan Shaoqing saw Wen Xinya standing still and cautiously said, \u201cMy house is a little small, but you may sit on the bed if you don\u2019t mind!\u201dWen XInya did not mind at all. She sat on one side of the bed.Yan Shaoqing heaved a sigh of relief. When he wanted to get some drink for them, he realized there was only one cup in the house. \u201cAllow me to buy some drinks from the store nearby. What would you like to drink?\u201dWen Xinya smiled. \u201cNothing. I did not come for a drink.\u201dYan Shaoqing did not insist. He picked up his notebook computer from his chair and sat down. \u201cI did not go through any formal education. I have self-learned the courses from Harvard Business Management Faculty and now am trying to secure myself a spot in the upcoming examination under the Harvard Business Management Internet module. I hope to achieve a Doctorate\u2019s degree in the course.\u201dDue to financial constraints, he had lost the opportunity to take the examination in the past five years!\u201cOuyang Feng has told me that you\u2019re an all-rounded talent and that you have a good understanding in multiple industries.\u201d Wen Xinya glanced around the library. It was clear that Ouyang Feng did not lie to her.Yan Shaoqing nodded. \u201cYes, that\u2019s right. However, the area of my focus includes real estate, electronic technology, luxurious brands, construction and hotel management.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes brightened with disbelief. These industries currently contributed up to 60% of the country\u2019s economic growth. He was indeed a person with foresight. \u201cI have found the right person.\u201d\u201cAre you going to employ me?\u201d Yan Shaoqing was confused. What did she mean? Was she saying that she would employ him?\u201cI need a personal assistant, and Ouyang Feng has recommended you to me. I wanted to know if you are capable enough for this position.\u201d Wen Xinya did not want to beat around the bush. A strong-willed person would always be strong regardless of the circumstances. She knew that she would want him to join her team by any means.Yan Shaoqing fell into a trance. He did not expect Wen Xinya to be this straightforward. She did not mind about his looks. \u201cThough I have no experience to the job scope, I believe I can do it.\u201dWen Xinya nodded with satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019m interested in looking into the properties in the West Coast. Compile the territorial information of the lands in the West Coast area and give me a detailed report within three days.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYan Shaoqing nodded. \u201cRest assured. I will complete the report as soon as possible.\u201dWen Xinya nodded contentedly. The West Coast sector encompassed a large area. It was not an easy task to complete a detailed report within three days. She had wanted to test him and see if he had the confidence and capability to take up the role as her personal assistant. After all, he had spent a long time living under the scrutiny of others due to his ugly looks. She needed to be sure.\u201cYan Shaoqing, may we have a pleasant cooperation.\u201d Wen Xinya stretched out her hand again. This time without any doubts or suspicion, but with full sincerity.Yan Shaoqing smiled. He was happy that someone had given him respect. \u201cPleasant cooperation.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhou Tianyu\u2019s father held a key position in the Central Government Agency as well, and her mother was the Minister of Education. Being the eldest daughter in the Zhou family, Zhou Tianyu naturally became the center of attention in the public\u2019s eyes.When Zhou Tianyu invited Wen Xinya earlier, she mentioned that it would be a mini-birthday party. When Wen Xinya arrived at the venue, she realized it was actually a small-scale banquet.At the banquet, many young men and women of their similar age groups from the circle was invited, forming a somewhat relaxed atmosphere.Wen Xinya quickly spotted Zhou Tianyu in the crowd. She was wearing a light purple gown that revealed one side of her shoulders as she shuttled between the crowd and interacted with her guests with a glass of red wine in her hand. Those in conversation with her were trying to please her, but she maintained her smile and exuded a gracious disposition. She looked graceful and presentable, definitely worthy of the title of \u201cPrincess of the Zhou Family.\u201dZhou Tianyu finally saw Wen Xinya standing not too far from her and walked up to her with a smile. \u201cYou should have let me known that you\u2019ve arrived!\u201dZhou Tianyu looked at Wen Xinya from head to toe. Wearing a pastel green skirt, like a lotus growing its first bud, she had grown into a fine, young lady. She was wearing the red ear stud as usual, with a pair of black and white longer earrings dangling from her ears. She had no other accessories except these. It was not too formal, but she looked presentable.Wen Xinya laughed. \u201cI wanted to admire the Princess of the Zhou Family\u2019s halo from a distance.\u201d\u201cHey girl, are you asking for a fight?\u201d Zhou Tianyu stretched her hands, pretending that she was going to tickle Wen Xinya at her armpit.Wen Xinya laughed and took a step back, grasping her arms tightly. \u201cToday, you\u2019re at the center of the spotlight. Do not blame me if you disgrace yourself.\u201dZhou Tianyu pouted. \u201cAll of the invited guests are in the same age group as me. Take a look at them, they are all behaving appropriately, but they will all reveal their true selves after a glass of wine or two. There\u2019s nothing wrong for a little rowdy behavior.\u201dWen Xinya took a quick glance around the ballroom and stared at her. \u201cSomeone has told me that this is just a mini-birthday party. You almost got me into an embarrassment for being underdressed for this event.\u201dZhou Tianyu chuckled and snatched the present from Wen Xinya\u2019s hands. \u201cI have not had any birthday parties in recent years. This event was organized by my mother. Look at this, I didn\u2019t expect a birthday party to turn into a banquet. I don\u2019t like it either.\u201d She then focused her attention on Wen Xinya\u2019s present. \u201cWhat birthday present did you get for me? Let me open it right now.\u201dOnly an intimate friend would open a birthday present in front of you. Zhou Tianyu\u2019s gesture warmed Wen Xinya\u2019s heart. \u201cThere\u2019s no need to ask me, you are going to open it anyway.\u201dZhou Tianyu held the beautifully wrapped box in her hands and started to unwrap it. As soon as she removed the wrapper, it revealed an exquisitely engraved box emitting a woody fragrance. When she opened the box, she saw the rims of a wooden scroll with the light musky smell of ink. She liked the smell.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Zhou Tianyu\u2019s hands trembled, excited.\u201cIt\u2019s exactly what you are thinking it is,\u201d replied Wen Xinya with a smile.Zhou Tianyu handed the box over to Wen Xinya. Then, she cautiously removed the scroll from the box and opened it with care. She could recognize that it was Old Mr. Mo\u2019s Yan-Style calligraphy. He had written a chapter from the book \u2014 Perseverance by Quan Wengong from the Tang Dynasty. It was a motivational article aimed to educate mankind to remember their origins and show gratitude to the efforts of the forefathers who paved the way. It also reminded them of the importance of self-motivation, perseverance, and resiliency toward hardships.Wen Xinya started reading a small paragraph. \u201cThe descendant shall be reminded of the ancestors\u2019 efforts. The successor shall remember the forefathers\u2019 hardships. He who perseveres against difficulties will achieve his goals. Proceed with caution, work towards your ambition\u2026 If you have done your best, you will let no one down. The ancestors paved the way, the descendants enjoy the fruits of labor. Continue the spirit of perseverance and the establishments will last for many generations to come!\u201dZhou Tianyu was admiring the brush strokes of the Yan-Style calligraphy on the wooden scroll. Every stroke represented power and strength, looking strong and majestic. She was mesmerized by every single word.\u201cXinya, thank you! This is the best present I have ever received.\u201d Zhou Tianyu felt extremely touched and gave Wen Xinya a hug to show her appreciation.Wen Xinya smiled. \u201cGrampy was happy to hear that you are into Yan-Style calligraphy. He has asked you to visit him whenever you are free to pick up a few tips from him. You know that I am learning Liu-style calligraphy instead. That made Grampy disappointed.\u201dZhou Tianyu was elated. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing to be able to learn from Old Mr. Mo.\u201dWen Xinya pretended to be unhappy with the intention to tease her. \u201cIt\u2019s your blessing that you have got to know me.\u201dZhou Tianyu smiled. \u201cYes, of course! My dear Missus Wen, may I then have the pleasure to invite you to cut the cake with me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather not cut the cake. Look! That person has been busy entertaining the guests on your behalf. He should have the pleasure to cut the cake with you.\u201d Wen Xinya signaled her to look at Gu Junlin, who was talking to the guests at a short distance away from them.Zhou Tianyu looked as if she did not mind, and mumbled. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t get him to do the job, it would be a waste of his attention-seeking looks, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201dWen Xinya burst out laughing. \u201cI can smell jealousy in the air!\u201d Though Gu Junlin had a charming appearance and was always attracting attention from the opposite gender, he had good self-discipline. He always stayed in Zhou Tianyu\u2019s presence.Zhou Tianyu pretended she did not understand what Wen Xinya meant. She sniffed and replied, \u201cI could not smell anything else other than wine and food.\u201dWen Xinya felt sorry for Gu Junlin. \u201cGu Junlin is really pitiful, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cSpat!\u201d Zhou Tianyu put up a disgusted look. \u201cWhy is he pitiful? He should feel honored to be able to serve me.\u201dWen Xinya gave her a nudge. \u201cAlright\u2026 Go ahead and keep your guests company. I won\u2019t mind if you leave me alone.\u201dZhou Tianyu rolled the wooden scroll carefully and kept it into the box. She then left Wen Xinya to speak with other guests.Right at this moment, Gu Junlin walked over with a glass of red wine. \u201cXu-er and Han Mofeng have not arrived yet, and Ling Qingxuan is hanging around with the other ladies. So, Tianyu has specifically sent me to accompany you.\u201dWen Xinya could not help but laugh. \u201cWhat a tragedy that you have to sacrifice yourself!\u201dGu Junlin replied, \u201cNot at all. It\u2019s not a tragedy at all. It is my honor to be able to accompany a beauty like you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you realize that.\u201d Wen Xinya quickly glanced at Zhou Tianyu and then looked back to him. He could detect a threat in her tone.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Junlin smiled bitterly. Even an outsider was aware of his feelings toward Tianyu except herself, who only treated him as a buddy. They had been childhood friends and grew up together. However, Zhou Tianyu treated this relationship only as brotherly love. Surprisingly, Wen Xinya was the one who understood how he felt.\u201cTianyu will be learning Yan-Style calligraphy from my Grampy soon. Why don\u2019t you join her?\u201d Wen Xinya winked at him and then walked into the ballroom.Gu Junlin\u2019s feelings for Zhou Tianyu were undeniable. As long as Zhou Tianyu was around, he would not set his eyes upon anyone else. He only showed affection towards Zhou Tianyu, though they were always bickering with each other. Wen Xinya was touched by his faithfulness and had decided to help him win Zhou Tianyu\u2019s heart.Gu Junlin was over the moon and gratefully said, \u201cXinya, thank you so much!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had a sense of calmness and elegance in her, just like a viburnum tree. Her beauty was enhanced with purity, and not even the grandness of the majestic chandelier in the ballroom could compare to her demeanor.This was the first time she had ever attended a party from within the circle. Everyone was curious about the Young Missus Wen and had all of their attention on her.When she had just returned to the Wen Family, there were rumors about her circulating in the circle. They said she was an unrefined and arrogant person, lacking etiquette and intelligence. Afterward, during the period when her scandals were published by the media, she had used her own methods to resolve the matter and was able to demand a huge sum of compensation from those media companies. This was the first impression she gave to the public. Also, everyone had a deep impression on the words she spoke to the reporters \u2014 \u201cIf no one offends me, I will not offend anyone. For those who had offended me, I will avenge a hundred times!\u201dShe had displayed such arrogance on that day. It was such a beautiful victory that no one dared challenge her!Moreover, Old Mr. Wen had also discreetly given her tremendous support and acknowledgment through his response to the media. Thus, everyone was looking forward to the day of her introductory banquet event.The Young Missus Wen was no ordinary girl indeed!This was the impression everyone in the circle had of her.Wen Xinya did not mind the curious looks at all. She took a glass of red wine from the waiter and saw Han Mofeng and Ling Qingxuan walking towards her.\u201cI would have expected you to arrive together with Xu-er.\u201d Han Mofeng had just arrived. He noticed Wen Xinya was alone and therefore knew that Xu-er had not arrived yet. It was the first time Wen Xinya attended a formal party in the circle, and it would be best if someone she knew accompanied her.\u201cI asked Xu-er earlier, but he said he was busy and would be late for the party. So I came alone.\u201d Wen Xinya understood that Xu Zhenyu was still very much affected by their previous scandalous news and wanted to keep a distance from her in public.Ling Qingxuan noticed her glass was empty. He took a glass filled with red wine from the waiter and replaced the empty glass in her hand. \u201cLet\u2019s not bother about him. He\u2019s always the last one to arrive for any event.\u201dWen Xinya took over the new glass of wine. She smelled the fragrant, sweet scent from the glass and tasted it. She liked it. \u201cAre you guys aware that Xu-er has mentioned about joining the military?\u201dHan Mofeng was shocked. \u201cI\u2019ve not heard him saying anything about this!\u201dLing Qingxuan was taken aback as well. \u201cHow is that possible? Previously, when Old Mr. Xu mentioned sending him to the military camp, he opposed the idea strongly. Why did he suddenly change his mind?\u201d\u201cYou guys had better find a chance to talk to him. The military training camp is not a fun place. One must have a strong determination. I\u2019m just worried that he might not be serious.\u201d Wen Xinya thought they knew about his decision, but did not expect Xu Zhenyu to keep it from even Han Mofeng.Han Mofeng nodded. He could see mixed emotions from Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes. He grew up with Xu Zhenyu and understood him well. Ever since the scandalous reports, Xu Zhenyu became depressed. Now that he had suddenly changed his mind about joining the military, it was obvious that he made this decision because of Wen Xinya.Ling Qingxuan did not think too much about it. \u201cIt\u2019s good that Xu-er has decided to join the military. I was still worried he might continue to waste his youth away. He has already passed the playful age and should start giving some serious thoughts about his future.\u201dHan Mofeng agreed with Ling Qingxuan. He looked at Wen Xinya with assurance. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I know Xu-er best. Once he has made up his mind, he will not give up easily. You know Gu Junlin has always joked about it, that Xu-er is the most stubborn person amongst us all.\u201dWen Xinya nodded.Ling Qingxuan said, \u201cCome on, let me introduce you to a few friends from the circle.\u201dIt was Wen Xinya\u2019s first time attending an event in the circle. There was a lot of people she did not know. Therefore, he wanted to introduce her to some friends.Wen Xinya deeply appreciated his kind gesture. \u201cThank you!\u201dHan Mofeng and Ling Qingxuan led her through the crowd and introduced a few people to her, and even shared some of the new friends\u2019 family and background stories with her.Wen Xinya had finally formally established her presence within the circle.Han Mofeng signaled for Wen Xinya to look towards a particular direction. \u201cThat\u2019s Xiao Chengyu, the Young Master and heir of the Xiao Family. Just like the Wen Family, the Xiao Family is also an affluent family in the business and commercial world. People call the top four affluent families in the Capital city \u2018The Big Four,\u2019 and the Xiao Family is one of them.\u201dWen Xinya looked over and saw Young Master Xiao, Xiao Chengyu. Though she did not have any interactions with Xiao Chengyu in her previous life, she had heard much about him through that man.Wen Xinya recalled from her previous life \u2014 After a few years, the Xiao Family members turned against each other in a fight for the inheritance. In the end, the family\u2019s fortune fell into the hands of an illegitimate son, and Xiao Chengyu soon met with a car accident and slipped into a coma.\u201cYou\u2019ve mentioned \u2018The Big Four.\u2019 Other than the Wen and Xiao Families, which are the other two?\u201d asked Wen Xinya curiously, though she had already guessed it.\u201cThe Gu Family and the Jiang Family,\u201d replied Ling Qingxuan.She was right indeed. Old Mr. Ling had recently stepped down from his political career and shifted the focus of his family business towards the entertainment industry. Regardless, the Ling Family was still considered the most affluent family in the political arena of the Capital city.\u201cAt which position is the Wen Family ranked in \u2018The Big Four\u2019?\u201d asked Wen Xinya.Han Mofeng replied, \u201cThe Wen Family is ranked third place! And the first place belongs to the Gu Family. They have close connections to the National Security Agency and are well respected by both the government sector and the underground world. Their family businesses include hospitalism and entertainment, and recently they also shifted their attention to real estate, where they had excellent results. By the way, Ninth-Heaven Club belongs to the Gu Family. The Xiao Family, however, is mainly involved in the arena of electronics technology and home electrical appliances. They have three-quarters of the market share nationwide and are also expanding rapidly internationally in recent years. They also have a share of the real estate pie. As for the Wen Family, there\u2019s no need for me to elaborate further as we know they are into luxury products. Lastly, the Jiang Family\u2019s business is involved in the food and beverage and also the daily essentials products.\u201dWen Xinya nodded. In 2004, the news of a group of foreign electronic companies who tried to enter and dominate the local electronic market share had shaken the world. They took the local electronic industry by storm and were aggressive in their steps in trying to buy over many of the local companies. Then, the Xiao Corporation joined forces with other local companies to defend against being bought over by these foreign companies.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was a long three years battle, with many companies suffering and paying the price. During this period, these local companies had increased their technologies and capabilities tremendously, and at the same time improving their marketing strategies. Hence, the local home appliances industry had arrived at its peak and were the top globally. The foreign competitors became afraid and finally retreated out from the local market.This had helped the Xiao Corporation built a rock-solid foundation. They had gained an enormous amount of public support for their leadership and courage to stand up and defend against foreign competitors. By increasing their internal capabilities, the Xiao Corporation was able to grow exponentially and gained three-quarters of the market share. They had the best technology and capabilities and had won the hearts of the public. It was no wonder the Xiao Family was ranked as the second largest Family Corporation in the country.Ling Qingxuan continued, \u201cHowever, the Wen Corporation used to be at the second position. Since your Grandpa stepped down as the Chairman and your father took over his position, the Corporation did not show any substantial growth, and therefore it has now become number three.\u201dWen Xinya was well aware that Wen Haowen was not a team player and had limited capabilities to lead the Corporation. It was unlikely that the Wen Corporation would have a bright future under his leadership.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He wore a pink shirt and a light blue casual blazer. However, his air of arrogance was at its maximum.Xu Zhenyu looked at Wen Xinya, noticing that she was donned in a pastel green dress. Slim like a pink lotus, there was innocence in her youthfulness, causing his heart to skip a beat as he greeted her. Without waiting for her response, he immediately turned around and walked into the crowd, greeting familiar faces.Wen Xinya sighed softly. This is good too! Thinking about her previous life in which Xu Zhenyu had a terrible ending, she thought it should be a good thing that he keeps his distance from her in this life.Han Mofeng and Ling Qingxuan remembered that Wen Xinya was just talking about Xu Zhenyu\u2019s desire to enter the army. Xu Zhenyu was finally eager to catch up.Wen Xinya was alone when she saw Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya from afar. She could not help but blink twice. She did not think she would see them in such an event.Xia Ruya was Xia Emporium Group\u2019s precious daughter. Although Xia Emporium Group was a wealthy family in the city, they were a far cry from the Zhou Family\u2019s splendor. So why was she here at Zhou Tianyu\u2019s birthday party?With regards to Wen Yuya, to put it nicely, she was a daughter of the Wen Family. However, everyone in their social circle knew that she was the daughter from a previous marriage. A regular wealthy family would naturally be willing to befriend her, but the Zhou Mansion was not somewhere she could simply enter.At this moment, Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya caught sight of her.After walking closer, Xia Ruya\u2019s face stiffened and stared at the pale green dress that Wen Xinya wore. The handicraft on the dress was of pure white pear tree flowers. Though the embroidery was not complicated, when she stood still, the flowers were quietly beautiful, and when she walked, the pear blossoms exploded with colors, so magnificently as though they were blooming right on her dress.In realization, she looked at the dress she was wearing. She had the same pastel green colored dress, but printed on it were lotus flowers. It felt as though her dress was chosen in poor taste. In an instant, she despised the fact that the dress she wore was not exquisite enough.Xia Ruya let on an appropriately generous smile. \u201cXinya, you\u2019re here for Miss Zhou\u2019s birthday banquet as well.\u201d\u201cSince the both of you have come as well, was it Miss Zhou who invited you?\u201d Wen Xinya looked extremely surprised, as though the both of them should not have been there in the first place.Her expression embarrassed Xia Ruya, rendering her speechless.Wen Yuya was unhappy. \u201cYou\u2019re invited, so why can\u2019t we? Who do you think you are? You think you\u2019re the eldest Miss Wen, but you are simply just a wild sparrow who has flown a little higher from the branch.\u201dWen Xinya laughed shallowly. \u201cIf I\u2019m a wild sparrow which flew higher from the branch, then what are you? Are you the Wen Family\u2019s legitimate Miss Wen, a real golden phoenix?\u201dThe color drained from Wen Yuya\u2019s face. There was nothing left for her to say.Wen Xinya walked closer to her and leaned in slightly, both eyes shining so beautifully that they moved hearts. \u201cAllow me to remind you: I\u2019m the eldest daughter of the Wen Family, the only blood and flesh of the Wen Family, the heiress of the Wen Family. I\u2019m not someone that a mere foster daughter like yourself can provoke. If there is another attempt\u2026\u201d Her gaze suddenly turned vicious, the darkness in her pupils overflowing with coldness. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for being mean.\u201dWen Yuya felt as though a large invisible hand had suddenly grabbed her heart. It felt as though her heart was trampled on, to the point where it was hard to breathe. She abruptly held her chest and stumbled backward, her mind in a mess. She was dumbfounded.Xia Ruya pulled at Wen Yuya\u2019s arm, looking at Wen Xinya with grievance evident on her face. \u201cXinya, in any case, Yuya is your sister. How could you speak to her like that?\u201dHer voice sounded agitated, naturally raising her voice a bit. That attracted some attention from the people around them, and they turned their gaze upon them.Wen Xinya slowly swirled the red wine in her hand. \u201cWhat did I say to her? Who are you even, to meddle in our Wen Family\u2019s affairs? Why must you be involved in me teaching Yuya about respecting her sister and knowing her own place?\u201dWith just a few words laced with insults, she brought the whole story to light. Previously, the situation involving Wen Yuya shading Wen Xinya was made known to many on Weibo. Everyone in their social circle knew that the relationship between Wen Yuya and Wen Xinya was not good. Wen Xinya, being the legitimate daughter of the Wen Family, lecturing a mere foster daughter was no cause for criticism. No family had nothing to hide, so naturally, no one would allow a mere foster daughter to climb all over their head.Everyone\u2019s attention turned to Xia Ruya. Xia Ruya had always been a favorite within the social circle. When she was thought to be the Wen Family\u2019s daughter, she was always in the spotlight in such events. Now that she had lost the glory of being the Wen Family\u2019s daughter, it was rare to see her in such a setting. Hearing that she intervened in the Wen sisters\u2019 affair, as a previously known Young Mistress Wen, she was bound to be appraised.\u201cI\u2026 I was just\u2026\u201d The color drained from Xia Ruya\u2019s face. She then bit her lip to bring out her delicate and pitiful look further.At this moment, Xiao Chengyu, who was talking to a few friends nearby, walked over slowly. \u201cHere you are! I was about to introduce some friends to you all.\u201dXiao Chengyu was 19 years old this year. He was tall, graceful, and exuded an air of elegance and class. With one look, you could tell that he was wealthy and respectable. He had a clear voice that brought out his spirit, easily allowing others to form good impressions of him.Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes flashed in recognition, looking at Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya. \u201cSo you guys came with Young Master Xiao.\u201dHer words, though plain, had a hint of understanding. But because there was playfulness in her tone, it made the meaning of her words seem more mysterious all of a sudden, as though mocking them that they could only come to such an event because of Xiao Chengyu.Xia Ruya paled, while Wen Yuya\u2019s face was red with anger.Xiao Chengyu saw all sorts of people since he was young, so naturally, he could read between the lines. He raised his eyebrows. \u201cThis is\u2026?\u201dWen Yuya spoke peculiarly. \u201cBig Brother Xiao, you should look more carefully. She is the Young Mistress Wen who is the talk of the town now. My sister, Wen Xinya. Didn\u2019t you read the newspapers? How can you not recognize her!\u201dXiao Chengyu smiled awkwardly and looked at Wen Xinya a little closer. Then, he finally recognized her. \u201cSo, you\u2019re the Young Mistress Wen. It is an honor to meet you.\u201d\u201cYoung Mister Xiao, nice to meet you!\u201d Wen Xinya nodded slightly at him. Now that she had seen Xiao Chengyu, to speak the truth, she felt complicated feelings. This was because she could not help but think about the man she could not forget about from her previous life.\u201cRuya and Yuya came with me. I wanted to introduce some friends to them, so please don\u2019t mind me snatching them away for a little while!\u201d Xiao Chengyu spoke gentlemanly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPlease do!\u201d Wen Xinya spoke casually.Xiao Chengyu nodded and left with Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya.Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes flashed with coldness. Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya appeared together here, was it a coincidence or was it intended?Her heart spontaneously guarded itself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What Wen Xinya could not understand was why a birthday party was turned into a ball. They were a bunch of young men and women wearing masks that suited their statuses and speaking words they did not truly mean. This disgusted her.Han Mofeng brought her around again, introducing to her some friends of his within the circle who were decent people. Then, when Wen Xinya got tired of all the socializing, she went to a corner to take a break from the crowd.Next to the resting area was a balcony with a few lilac flowers hanging from the top, having blossomed, they attracted a few ladies to gather at the balcony to admire them.Wen Xinya heard a familiar voice. Listening carefully, she recognized the voice to be from Xu Zhenyu\u2019s birthday party, the girl who was against her every move, Jiang Yuqing.The other voice was foreign to her, she had never heard this voice before.Jiang Yuqing\u2019s voice was filled with despise and scorn. \u201cYoung Mistress Wen is actually so aggressive and overbearing. I just saw her lecture Wen Yuya in front of many people. Xia Ruya couldn\u2019t stomach it, so she intervened. In the end, she was made close to tears.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s so great about her? She is just a sparrow which flew too high for her own good. Look at her, there is no trace of a wealthy daughter in her. She just looks like a little hooligan.\u201d\u201cHehe! You forgot to mention that before she returned to the Wen Family, she was actually a hooligan from the streets! Fighting and creating trouble every day, drinking and smoking, and hanging out with those hooligans\u2026 I bet her body is not clean.\u201d\u201cExactly. She is just a slut acting like a chaste woman. What a pity for Ruya, she\u2019s so elegant and classy, kind and innocent, but she fell from heaven to hell in a heartbeat.\u201d\u201cPreviously, at Brother Yu\u2019s birthday, we were invited to Ninth-Heaven for a party. She acted like she did not know how to drink, making Brother Yu drink on her behalf. She\u2019s so slippery that it disgusts me. But you are right to say that Ruya is the true embodiment of how a wealthy lady should be like.\u201dWen Xinya unconcernedly took the grape wine from atop the coffee table and slowly stood up. The bright white pear blossoms on her dress followed her graceful movements, as though they were dancing carefreely in the wind.\u201cAre you talking about me?\u201d She leaned lightly against the balcony\u2019s framework, lightly swirling the wine glass in her hand. The reddish-purple liquid swayed in the cup, creating rounds of ripples, gently crashing against the glass surface, creating lines of exceptionally beautiful red scars.The girls at the balcony, Jiang Yuqing and Jiang Ruoxin, jumped back subconsciously because of her sudden appearance. Their faces were pale. Something like awkwardness and guilt brewed within them, caused by being caught gossiping about others behind their back.Jiang Yuqing looked at the pastel green dress Wen Xinya was wearing, recognizing it. The dress was from this season\u2019s latest outfits of Saint Yoland. Previously when she went to Saint Yoland, she saw the outfit, but because her skin color was not as good as Wen Xinya\u2019s, she could not pull off such a delicate color. Hence, she did not buy it.Looking at Wen Xinya wearing the clothing she fancied, the tender green and the brilliant white of the pear blossoms, it portrayed her exquisiteness. Anger consumed her suddenly. \u201cEavesdropping at others\u2019 conversation, do you even have any manners? You uneducated filth.\u201dWen Xinya smiled falsely and glared at Jiang Yuqing. \u201cIt is indeed true that the thief cries thief. You speak ill of others behind their back, but when caught, you\u2019re still so confident that you\u2019re not in the wrong. Is it really me who is uneducated, or is it you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Jiang Yuqing\u2019s face heated up like she was having a fever, and flew into a rage out of humiliation.\u201cYou said I didn\u2019t act like a daughter from an aristocratic family, but I want to ask you: your gossiping behind people\u2019s back, with such venomous and unfiltered words that even the landlady\u2019s mouth is cleaner than yours, is that how a true aristocratic daughter should act?\u201d Wen Xinya indolently brushed her hair behind her ear, casting a sidelong glance at them.Jiang Yuqing and Jiang Ruoxin were stunned at her imposing manner. Listening to her words, their faces turned red and they shouted angrily. \u201cIt is true that we\u2019re daughters from famously rich families.\u201dWen Xinya smirked and looked at Jiang Yuqing, her eyes filled with contempt. \u201cThese words, I can also give it to you respectfully \u2014 it is true that I\u2019m the daughter of an aristocratic family.\u201dJiang Yuqing and Jiang Ruoxin were stunned and at a loss for words. There was no way they could refute the fact that Wen Xinya was indeed the eldest daughter of the Wen Family.Wen Xinya glanced at them coldly from the side of her eyes, as though her gaze were actual knives flying towards Jiang Yuqing. \u201cBut you, you\u2019re merely an illegitimate daughter born out of wedlock. That\u2019s undeniable. But you must remember, your surname is Jiang, not Zhang.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s words were like arrows that shot straight to her heart, hitting the bull\u2019s eyes in the spot that hurt her the most, turning her face beyond pale.Wen Xinya strolled towards them. \u201cYou better not speak ill of others behind their back in the future. Or else\u2026\u201dJiang Yuqing and Jiang Ruoxin did not seem to understand the truth of the matter.Wen Xinya raised her wine glass slowly, the transparent glass shining under the dim yellow light of the balcony like it was mimicking the sun. With a swift movement of her hand, the glass tilted. In an instant, the wine in the glass was spilled on the heads of Jiang Ruoxin and Jiang Yuqing.Reddish-purple liquid dripped from their hair down to their faces, necks, and their evening gowns. The girls who were dressed beautifully were now visibly battered.\u201cAh!\u201d Jiang Ruoxin screamed, dodging Wen Xinya immediately.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Jiang Yuqing reacted by subconsciously taking a step back. Due to her dress being too long, she stepped on her gown and fell to the ground.\u201cAh!\u201d Jiang Yuqing pulled Jiang Ruoxin as she fell. Jiang Ruoxin did not have the time to react, and they both fell to the ground in seconds.Wen Xinya looked at the two huddled on the floor, and raised her hands innocently. \u201cYou fell by yourselves. You better not go around spreading false news that I was the one who pushed you.\u201dHer attitude caused Jiang Yuqing to flare up in anger.However, Wen Xinya ignored both of them and turned around to return to the ballroom.At this moment, a waiter walked over with a tray full of wine cups. Wen Xinya walked over to exchange her empty glass, but who knew the waiter would stumble, toppling the glass of wine in Wen Xinya\u2019s hand and causing the wine to spill all over her dress.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Miss. I did not do it on purpose.\u201d The waiter was extremely nervous and eager to apologize to Wen Xinya.Zhou Tianyu noticed the commotion and hurried over. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dWen Xinya lowered her head to look at the dress that was ruined by a large stain of wine. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. The waiter accidentally brushed my hand and the wine spilled on my dress.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhou Tianyu frowned ever so slightly. \u201cThe cloakroom is filled with clothes that you can change into. Let me bring you there!\u201dWen Xinya nodded. \u201cYou go entertain the guests. The waiter can lead me on your behalf.\u201dLeaving a ballroom full of guests was indeed not a good idea. Zhou Tianyu nodded and instructed the waiter who messed up Wen Xinya\u2019s dress. \u201cBring Miss Wen to the cloakroom to change.\u201dThe waiter\u2019s eyes flashed with suppressed emotions and an odd look in his eyes. He then lowered his eyes and said, \u201cMiss Wen, follow me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 - Could It Be That She Was Locked In The Cloakroom?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78: Could It Be That She Was Locked In The Cloakroom?Atlas Studios\u201cXu-er, are you really going to join the army?\u201d Han Mofeng finally found the chance to ask him.\u201cIt must have been Wen Xinya who told you all.\u201d Xu Zhenyu held the fragrant, sweet wine. With his slender arms, he gently swirled the wine. These grape wines tasted sweet; thus, it is impossible for anyone to get drunk on them. It is the most suitable for these youngsters to drink. It was Gu Junling\u2019s winery that handcrafted these. He saw that Wen Xinya was particularly fond of it so he would ask Gu Junling to gift her some later.\u201cWow, Xu-er. This is a huge matter, but you didn\u2019t even discuss it with us. If it weren\u2019t for Wen Xinya mentioning it, we would still be in the dark. You should not be so biased to put love before friendship.\u201d Ling Qingxuan heard his tone, and it sounded like he was for real. She could not help but tease him.Xu Zhenyu indifferently said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t really such a big deal. My family is from a military background, but my father and my brother entered politics. There should be someone to continue the family\u2019s tradition. Me taking the military route has long been decided.\u201dHan Mofeng gave him a complex look. \u201cHaven\u2019t you always rejected the military? You even quarreled many times with Grandpa Xu over this matter.\u201dEver since Wen Xinya\u2019s scandal, Xu-er had matured a lot. The things he said and the things he did were efficient and unscrupulous. There was no hint of the boy who was filled with laughter and anger. Who knew a person could actually undergo such drastic changes in such a short time? If he did not still have Xu-er\u2019s looks, there was no way of telling that this person was indeed Xu-er.Actually, Han Mofeng\u2019s guess was pretty accurate. Xu Zhenyu\u2019s drastic change was mainly due to the dream that he had. The dream was extremely realistic, portraying his life vividly and in great detail.\u201cOne\u2019s thinking changes constantly. I wasn\u2019t sure when it started, but I was left behind. Slowly, all of you started getting busy, and I no longer have any similar conversation topic to discuss with you guys. I just took it that all of you have changed. But since the incident with Wen Xinya, I finally understood that actually, you guys have not changed at all. It was me who was never on the same level as you from the very start.\u201dHan Mofeng felt his throat dry up. \u201cEntering the army is good too. I\u2019ll let you be the political commissar in the future.\u201dLing Qingxuan patted him lightly on the shoulders and smiled. \u201cMy grandfather just retired from the government, so my family currently does not have anyone who can be elected. In the future, when I have taken over the family business, it would be convenient to have someone in the military!\u201dAt this moment, Gu Junling sauntered over. He looked at their weird expressions. \u201cHas something happened? Why do all of you have such odd look on your faces?\u201dHan Mofeng said, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Xu-er has decided to enter the military soon, so we\u2019re simply happy for him.\u201dGu Junling was shocked as well and was about to ask for more details. However, after seeing that Han Mofeng and Ling Qingxuan were truly happy for him, he slapped Xu Zhenyu on the shoulder and said, \u201cXu-er, you finally thought it through! I was still worried that you were really going to smoke your way through your entire life.\u201dXu Zhenyu could not help but kick him. \u201cWho smoked through his life? Why aren\u2019t you at Tianyu\u2019s side being her protector but here with us?\u201dGu Junling finally remembered what he was there for. \u201cPreviously, the waiter accidentally ruined Xinya\u2019s clothing, then brought Xinya to the second level cloakroom to change. It seemed like they left for a while. Tianyu and I are too busy to leave, so we hope you can go and check on her.\u201dXu Zhenyu\u2019s gaze swept the venue once, and noticing that Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya were not around either, his heart skipped a beat, and he suddenly had a bad feeling. \u201cI\u2019ll go and take a look now.\u201dXu Zhenyu placed his wine cup on a waiter\u2019s tray and rushed across the ballroom to the second level.Reaching the cloakroom, Xu Zhenyu knocked on the door. \u201cWen Xinya, have you changed?\u201dThere was no movement in the room.Sensing that something was not right, Xu Zhenyu knocked harder this time. \u201cWen Xinya, you have been changing for too long, Tianyu and the rest are waiting for you downstairs.\u201dThere was still no sound or movement coming from the room, so he pressed his ears on the door. All of a sudden, there was a sharp banging coming from the inside of the room, and he thought he even heard shouts for help. However, because the soundproofing was good, he could not be sure what he heard, but he could vaguely make out Wen Xinya\u2019s voice.Xu Zhenyu\u2019s blood ran cold. His mind was a complete mess as he frantically turned the doorknob, but the door was locked from the outside, so there was no way to open the door.\u201cWen Xinya, what\u2019s happening inside? Hurry up and tell me.\u201d Xu Zhenyu had an ominous feeling. Hearing the banging grow more and more intense,Dong Dong Dong Dong, it sounded very similar to the pounding of his heart.He pressed his ears on the door once again but heard no reply, only the sounds of repeated banging. Feeling the vibrations of the door, the intense sound pierced his ear.\u201cWen Xinya, don\u2019t be afraid. Move away from the door, I will knock it down!\u201d Xu Zhenyu\u2019s breathing became shorter. He retreated a few steps back and violently slammed at the door. He hit the door so hard that half of his body was numb with pain, but he kept going, slamming his body at the door.At this moment, a few guests made their way upstairs. Among them were Jiang Yuqing and Jiang Ruoxin. Seeing Xu Zhenyu slamming his body at the door, they rushed toward him and asked, \u201cBrother Yu, what happened? Why are you slamming against the door?!\u201dXu Zhenyu ignored her, retreated, and kicked at the door. The door merely shook a little.Jiang Ruoxin looked at Jiang Yuqing\u2019s teary expression and approached Xu Zhenyu, holding him back. \u201cBrother Yu, the ball is boring. Tianyu just prepared a room for poker. Come and play poker with us!\u201dXu Zhenyu brushed Jiang Ruoxin aside. In his world, there was only that door. As though the door had instantly overtaken his whole world.Jiang Ruoxin fell violently to the wooden floor because of his action.Jiang Yuqing hurriedly helped her up. \u201cRuoxin, are you okay?\u201dJiang Ruoxin\u2019s bottom hurt, and she nearly teared. She was too embarrassed to speak, so she just nodded at Jiang Yuqing.Jiang Yuqing then heard the banging coming from the inside. Her eyes flashed with recognition. \u201cThere seems to be someone inside banging on the door! Brother Yu, do you know what has happened inside? Who is inside banging on the door?\u201dXu Zhenyu ignored her as well.Jiang Yuqing saw Xu Zhenyu being extremely anxious and realized that the person in the cloakroom could very well be Wen Xinya. With that thought, her whole body shook with agitation, moving closer to the door instinctively.Jiang Ruoxin also noticed that something was amiss, and asked curiously, \u201cCould it be that there is a reverse lock in the cloakroom? Isn\u2019t it strange that the cloakroom above the ball would lock someone in?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJiang Yuqing feigned innocence. \u201cSince someone has been reverse locked in the house, why not look for Miss Zhou for the key?\u201dBoom!The sound was deafening. The sturdy door had been kicked down by Xu Zhenyu.Xu Zhenyu was the first one to rush into the cloakroom. When he saw the situation inside, he felt like he was hit by five bolts of lightning simultaneously. He stumbled a little, feeling all the blood drained from his body in an instant. Breathing feeling like torture, as though there were countless binds wound around his chest, suddenly tightened. It was painful beyond reason!Wen Xinya, Wen Xinya, whether in the dream or in reality, I still failed to protect you!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the dim yellow light, there was a mist of decadence, forming an ambiguous air of lust.In the ruins, there was a man and a woman on the ground, dubiously entangled.Xu Zhenyu\u2019s eyes blurred in a second. In his blurred vision, only two outlines were moving. It was as though he was submerged in ice, the cold biting into his bones. It felt as though his whole being, his whole world, had been frozen.His heart tightened. That scene from his nightmare rushed into his head, and he was unable to push it back down. The bone-chilling pain gripped at his heart, making him ball his fists tight and grit his teeth.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d The sharp sounds reverberated around the room.Two girls fled from the mess they saw in the room.A few young men were shocked; they had not expected this scene to unfold within the cloakroom. Someone even bled from their nose.What was going on?\u201cWen\u2026 Wen Yuya!\u201d Jiang Yuqing\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief. Looking at the scene before her, she was stunned.The high-pitched sounds woke Wen Yuya from her reverie. It was as though she suddenly realized what was happening and shouted. \u201cGet out, get out, don\u2019t come here, leave\u2026 don\u2019t come any closer\u2026\u201dWen Yuya turned away, trying extremely hard to hide her face. Shock, fear, shame, hopelessness, anger\u2026 all sorts of emotions poured out of her like water from a mountain. Her whole world was filled with darkness and despair. It was pitch black, with not a hint of light. There was no way out.Everyone could not believe that the woman on the ground was actually the Wen Family\u2019s step-daughter,\u00a0Ning <sup>1</sup> Yuya. It was unbelievable.The Wen Family was a respectable family in society, even a dog owned by them would lead a better life than anyone outside the family. Although Wen Yuya was just the daughter from a previous marriage, she was still raised by the Wen Family for many years. It was true that many in their social circle looked down on her and scorned upon her as she went around, but she still had the status of being the Wen Family\u2019s foster daughter. It was just beyond anyone\u2019s imagination that Wen Yuya would actually do such a thing at Zhou Tianyu\u2019s birthday banquet.\u201cAh ah ah ah, go out\u2026 I said, go out\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya shouted, her whole being submerged in her emotions. It was as though only if she did that, she could release her deepest desperation.Xu Zhenyu finally woke from his complex, demonic thoughts. As his vision cleared, he saw that the woman entangled with the man was actually Wen Yuya and not Wen Xinya.The knot in his heart loosened, and he felt a weight lift off his shoulders. That was when he realized that his vest was cold; his cold sweat had soaked his shirt. It clung to his vest, making him feel extremely uncomfortable.Xu Zhenyu looked at Wen Yuya viciously. \u201cShameless. You\u2019re not even an adult, but yet you do such an act with a man. Even if you wanted to do it so badly, you should have done it in your own house. Yet, you came all the way here to dirty the Zhou Family\u2019s floor.\u201dHis pupils rapidly decreased in size, making his vision turn red. His body emitted an aura of anger, bit by bit. If\u2026 the person inside had been Wen Xinya, would the person lying next to the man be Wen Xinya?Xu Zhenyu could not help but think of that dream, where Wen Xinya fell into the trap of Ning Shuqian, Xia Ruya, and Wen Yuya and ended up losing her virginity before she was even an adult.The screams from the two girls earlier startled the guests downstairs. Everyone ran upstairs out of curiosity, flooding the cloakroom. They were incredulous to see the scene that unfolded within the cloakroom.Xu Zhenyu swept the crowd with his ice-cold eyes, looking for the silhouette of Xia Ruya. He had previously noticed that Xia Ruya was not present at the ballroom. Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya were inseparable. Since Wen Yuya was here, it meant that Xia Ruya should have been nearby.Xu Zhenyu\u2019s sharp eyes noticed the vain cover of the closet. He made a beeline for it and pulled it open with a single move.Xia Ruya\u2019s face was as pale as a sheet, cowering within the closet. The dim light shone on her face and body. She bent her body even more and curled up tighter.She lifted her head slightly, like a swan beautifully stretching its jade neck. In the dim light, she shone as white as snow and as brilliant as a jade. Her beautiful, pure face was clear as ice and clean as jade.She looked at Xu Zhenyu like that, her big eyes watery like dew on blooming flowers. Her eyes shone like crystals, and her brows shivered like a pistil in a blizzard, pale and weak.She looked fragile and pitiful. Any man who saw her would have his heart broken in sympathy.However, Xu Zhenyu was not just any man. He originally felt only disgust towards Xia Ruya. Now, seeing her pretense, he felt beyond repulsed. In one swift movement, he dragged her out.\u201cNo, please don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Xia Ruya screamed, her body staggered, and she stumbled onto the floor.Her clothing was in pieces, obviously unable to cover her developing yet beautiful body.Her young and tender body caused the bunch of young men who had yet to mature over love to cough indiscreetly. Their young, hot blood surged. The gazes they gave Xia Ruya were filled with impetuous lust.It was unknown who had shouted in excitement, \u201cIt\u2019s Xia Ruya, the Miss Wen whom the Wen Family had previously wrongly recognized.\u201dXia Ruya subconsciously covered her own face, as though forgetting that her chest and her bottom were in plain view.Jiang Ruoxin and Jiang Yuqing were completely stunned. They had originally thought that the person inside would be Wen Xinya. Unexpectedly, it turned out to be Wen Yuya and Xia Ruya. Thinking back, they had thought that Xia Ruya was classy and graceful, the role model of all children of affluent families, but they would never have imagined that Xia Ruya would be so arrogantly shameless.\u201cI was framed. I came to use the toilet on this side. Upon hearing sounds in the cloakroom, Yuya and I entered to take a look, but who knew that the door was locked from the outside. I was framed\u2026\u201d Xia Ruya flusteredly tried to explain, her tears falling profusely. Like a flower in a hurricane, strength within her dismay, even if she bloomed pale and fragile, she was still beautifully captivating.A boy saw her pitiful demeanor and gentlemanly gave up his own blazer for her to cover up her body.\u201cThank you!\u201d Xia Ruya\u2019s tears flowed, and she hurriedly pulled the blazer over herself, hiding her exposed skin.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSave me\u2026 Ruya, save me\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya\u2019s weak, demonic voice rang from within the cloakroom.Xia Ruya finally remembered about Wen Yuya and rushed over. The man was already unconscious, lying on one side. Wen Yuya was curled up in the corner. With her hands and legs tucked in, her body trembled non-stop.\u201cYuya! Yuya, it\u2019s alright now, I\u2019m here.\u201d Xia Ruya took off the blazer and used it to cover Wen Yuya\u2019s body. She knelt on the floor, hugged Wen Yuya tightly, and whispered in her ear.After a good while, Zhou Tianyu arrived with the housekeeper and a few maids. She was still underage, so it was natural that it was inconvenient for her to handle such a matter personally. Hence, she called the housekeeper to handle it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the food that the Zhou Family prepared did not include much seafood. As she wore Zhou Tianyu\u2019s clothing, she ate heartedly at the dining area in the ballroom.What was happening upstairs did not seem to be related to her. In any case, someone would naturally tell her what happened up there sometime later.It was not long before the ballroom\u2019s atmosphere started to feel weird. Boys and girls, three in a group, five in a crowd, began to gather together, speaking in quiet voices.Wen Xinya vaguely heard Wen Yuya\u2019s and Xia Ruya\u2019s names among the whispers. Her lips curled upwards slightly. They were plotting to harm her, but the tables turned, and they ended up tasting their own medicine. A natural disaster can be avoided, but not one\u2019s own sins.Very soon, Zhou Tianyu and Xu Zhenyu both descended the stairs and walked towards Wen Xinya.\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation upstairs?\u201d Wen Xinya immediately asked. She actually wanted to go up to see what the commotion was about, but Xia Ruya was always sly and cunning. She was afraid of being dragged into dirty waters, so she contained her own curiosity.As Xu Zhenyu looked at Wen Xinya safely eating in the ballroom, his violent emotions dissipated without a trace. He handed her his phone. \u201c360 degrees imaging. Take a look for yourself.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes widened. She did not think that Xu Zhenyu would actually record the scene.Xu Zhenyu was shocked by the look in her eyes and hurriedly took a step back. \u201cXia Ruya and Wen Yuya are always conspiring against you. How is it wrong for me to take pictures of their undignified appearances?\u201dActually, with his character, he could not possibly have done something so despicable. But at that moment, all that filled his head were scenes of his dream about Ning Shuqian, Xia Ruya, and Wen Yuya and how they caused Wen Xinya\u2019s death. The kidnapping and drugging, taking her nude photos to blackmail her, circulating them on the internet\u2026 His heart burned with this strange idea. It was convenient that his phone had advanced imaging abilities, so it was only after he had recorded the whole thing quietly did he realize what he had actually done.\u201cNo, I was just about to praise you for doing well!\u201d Wen Xinya happily opened the recording application. The content in the recording was more intense than she had imagined!She could never have imagined that in this life, the person who lost their virginity when they were still underage would be Wen Yuya. And yet, the one who had a classy and graceful, pure and gentle reputation, Xia Ruya, would also have her body exposed under the eyes of everyone, losing her bearings.Her heart was suddenly filled with all kinds of emotions.\u201cYou can tell me what exactly happened now!\u201d Zhou Tianyu crossed her arms and glared at Wen Xinya.Xu Zhenyu was also extremely curious. \u201cI thought that the person in the cloakroom was you. I was so scared that I got drenched in cold sweat. Who knew that the people inside turned out to be Wen Yuya and Xia Ruya? Quick tell us, what happened?\u201d\u201cEarlier on, when the waiter knocked into me, causing my outfit to be soaked, I already knew he did it on purpose. Normally, when people walk and are unstable, the first thing that would destabilize would be the things in their hands. But when he stumbled, it was his feet that were unsteady. Curiously, the tray he was holding was surprisingly steady. And because I suddenly saw Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya at the banquet, I was mentally prepared, so I noticed all the little details.\u201dZhou Tianyu promptly asked, \u201cAnd then? How did you shake off that waiter, found me to ask me to lend you some clothes, and also, how did you manage to feed Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya their own poison?\u201dWen Xinya continued, \u201cWhen the waiter led me to the cloakroom, I pretended to sprain my ankle and rudely and unreasonably demanded him to get me the first aid kit, then I took the opportunity to hide in the washroom. When he came back with the first aid kit, seeing that the cloakroom was tightly locked, it was natural for him to think that I had already gone in. About ten minutes later, I saw Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya sneakily come upstairs. So, I quickly locked them in as soon as they went into the cloakroom. I broke the door lock too, so they could not come out.\u201dZhou Tianyu gritted her teeth. \u201cThe man in the cloakroom was under a huge dose of sex pills. Thankfully, you were quick-witted. Else, the disaster that happened to Wen Yuya would have happened to you.\u201dIn a flash, Xu Zhenyu understood everything and said to Zhou Tianyu, \u201cSo you purposefully instructed Gu Junling to find me, so that I would go upstairs and look for Xinya. Then you took the opportunity to lure Jiang Yuqing and Jiang Ruoxin upstairs, all so that it would make a commotion and everyone would know what had happened with Wen Yuya and Xia Ruya.\u201dZhou Tianyu pointed at Wen Xinya, flustered. \u201cThis was not my idea, it was Xinya\u2019s. But I did arrange for Jiang Yuqing and Jiang Ruoxin to be there. They always have nasty things to say regularly. With them around, things would be more spectacular.\u201dWen Xinya said, \u201cI understand Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya too well. At an event like this, if they wanted to plot against me, they would attack my reputation or with my actions. So I guess, the more, the merrier.\u201dIn her past life, Ning Shuqian, Xia Ruya, and Wen Yuya had all their evil plans revolving around her reputation and behavior. This time, when she discovered Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya\u2019s plan, she knew it could not have strayed from their original motives.Xu Zhenyu\u2019s eyes had an eeriness from within. \u201cHow old are Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya? Their thinking is already so evil. They don\u2019t have any deep hatred for you, but they\u2019re already using such vicious methods against you.\u201dWen Xinya sighed. \u201cThis is the disaster caused by greed.\u201dZhou Tianyu understood. Wen Xinya was the only flesh and blood of the Wen Family, their sole heiress. Xinya had been wandering outside for 15 years. Just returning to the Wen Family, her foundations were not stable. As the people in the Wen Family had never lived with her before, they did not have feelings toward her. Their only connection was the blood that they shared. If Wen Xinya were to have her reputation ruined, the Wen Family would definitely hate and abandon her. Then, all the wealth of the Wen Family would go to Ning Shuqian. Also, being raised by their side for 12 years, always accompanying Grandpa Wen and also Grandma Wen\u2019s favorite, Xia Ruya would naturally receive a portion of the inheritance as well.Xu Zhenyu thought of what happened in his dream, and for a split second, he was unsure what was real and what happened only in the dream. Many things that happened in reality were similar to what happened in the dream, like\u2026 the greedy plots of Ning Shuqian and the other two!Zhou Tianyu fiercely said, \u201cI\u2019d never thought that Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya would resort to such means, even here in my Zhou residence! Looks like the next time I host a banquet, I will have to handpick the waiters with more caution. Else, there can be no telling what kind of trouble will happen in the future.\u201dWen Xinya said, \u201cPreviously, I asked you to lock up those few waiters. Though we did not manage to extract any information, when you send Wen Yuya and Xia Ruya back, send those men back to the Wen Family as well. There\u2019s no need to say much, nor is there a need for evidence. Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya are smart people who will naturally lose their courage. They would not let dare let the Zhou Family take the blame for this. This incident would naturally resolve itself then.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhou Tianyu could not help but laugh. \u201cNing Shuqian, Wen Yuya, and Xia Ruya have finally tasted pent-up your unspoken grievances. But you still want them utterly defeated. This plan of yours is really vicious.\u201dWen Xinya feigned anger and said, \u201cOtherwise, let\u2019s just let Ning Shuqian put the blame on the Zhou Family. How about that? After all, they met with disaster here at the Zhou residence. If the Zhou Family don\u2019t name a price, they will definitely not let this matter go. This incident is huge. Wen Yuya is, in the very least, the step-daughter of the Wen Family. Even my Grandpa will not just sit back and let this slide. Let alone the fact that she is the precious child of Ning Shuqian. My father has always given in to any of Ning Shuqian\u2019s demands. Are you sure this method will not bring more trouble to the Zhou Family?\u201dZhou Tianyu hurried to say, \u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t! Don\u2019t! I\u2019m just saying. Those three do deserve their just desserts.\u201dWen Xinya sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t take the initiative to plot against another. But I will have to counter against those who plot against me. I won\u2019t let them get away with it. If people don\u2019t offend me, I won\u2019t offend them. If people offend me, I will return the favor back by a hundred times.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But no matter how hard she tried, she could not remove the bruises on her body and the humiliation she had suffered.No matter how hard she washed, it seemed impossible for her to remove the filthy stains on her body.Yes, the filthy stains!She and Xia Ruya had gone to great lengths to bribe the Zhou Family\u2019s waiter, who deliberately stained Wen Xinya\u2019s clothes so that he would have an excuse to lure her to the cloakroom. A man in the cloakroom had drunk a glass of wine heavily spiked with an aphrodisiac, and he was waiting to pounce on Wen Xinya once she entered the room, causing her to lose her chastity.When the time was ripe, she would then pretend to go to the restroom on the second floor with Xia Ruya to catch them red-handed. She had intended to let everyone at the banquet know about the matter and hence ruin Wen Xinya\u2019s reputation.Everything went as planned. The waiter had successfully spilled a drink on Wen Xinya\u2019s dress and lured her to the cloakroom on the second floor. However, Wen Xinya did not fall for the trick. Instead, Xia Ruya and herself were locked in the cloakroom while trying to catch Wen Xinya red-handed.When the man in the room saw the ladies, he pounced on them like a hungry wolf. He caught hold of Xia Ruya and tore her clothes apart. She struggled and tried to escape, but the man pressed her body down, and she could not break free\u2026What happened next was\u2026A shiver ran down her spine as she could not bear to think further!She could vaguely hear the screaming and painful cries for mercy. Suddenly, she covered her ears, frantically shaking her head and crying uncontrollably. \u201cNo, no\u2026 Please let me go\u2026 Ruya, save me\u2026 Argh\u2026\u201dShe felt as if her limbs were being confined, and she struggled hard to break out of her confinement. But it seemed like no matter how hard she tried or screamed, she could not escape. The blood in her body almost froze as she suffocated. She bit onto the pillow so hard that her gums turned sore and her face turned pale, bringing her to the verge of despair.A blown up photograph on the wall suddenly caught her attention. She stared at the picture of herself. She was smiling broadly and innocently, beautiful and pure like an angel.She blinked her eyes, and at that instant, the girl in the picture became a hideous devil! The bright smile had transformed into a mouth full of blood and her hands turned into tentacles, reaching out and trying to strangle her.Her eyes became weary. Those scenes kept reappearing in front of her eyes!\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d The immense pain tormented her. She felt the pain of her body being torn apart, and it was so unbearable that she felt she would die the very next second. Her body began to spasm. \u201cPain\u2026\u201dShe had transformed from a girl into a woman in a split-second, and there was no time to mourn for her pain. She could only bear with her suffering and humiliation helplessly.Her breathing became heavy and intense. She was trying hard to forget the pain, but realized with every breath she took that the air she inhaled was like an ice-blade cutting through her nose and throat, causing her to have great difficulty to breathe.She was Wen Yuya. Mother had told her: the \u201cYu\u201d in her name represented jade, and signified good virtues! How did she become so filthy? How was that possible\u2026The door was pushed open. Xia Ruya was horrified to see the frenzy in her eyes. She was at a loss. It did not seem right for her to enter nor retreat.\u201cNo\u2026 Let go of me\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya covered her ears, her body curled up and trembling in shock.Xia Ruya ran over and hugged her tightly. \u201cYuya, it\u2019s fine. Everything\u2019s going to be alright. Look, you are in your room right now. Aunt Ning is entertaining the guests and will be up in a minute.\u201d\u201cPainful\u2026 Ruya, it\u2019s so painful\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya held onto Xia Ruya tightly. Her body still shivering in fear. The pain and despair of the penetration were following her closely like a shadow that she could never get rid of.Xia Ruya responded with tears in her eyes, \u201cYuya, rest assured. We will definitely have the chance to get revenge for the pain we are suffering now. We will make Wen Xinya pay for it a thousand times more.\u201dSuddenly, the suppressed anger in Wen Yuya exploded like a massive flood. She seemed to have straightened out her chaotic thoughts. It was Wen Xinya. All of this happened because of her. If not for her, Wen Yuya would not have to go through these sufferings.Her eyes turned red with rage, and she screamed insanely in a frenzied state. \u201cWen Xinya, it\u2019s all because of Wen Xinya. You\u2019re the cause of everything!\u201dXia Ruya held her tightly and cried. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Yes, it\u2019s her. She is the one who brought us so much pain and humiliation.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s name kept buzzing in her mind like a bell that went off at 12 o\u2019clock. She could only think of revenge. She cried out in an affirming tone. \u201cWen Xinya, Wen Xinya, how could you do that to me? You shall die a horrible death. A horrible death!\u201dBy now, Xia Ruya\u2019s eyes were filled with hatred. It was as if her mind had been occupied by a dozen venomous snakes, spitting deadly lethal fluids. The words she spoke represented the poisonous fluids spat by those venomous snakes. \u201cYuya, I don\u2019t know what went wrong. Why did we lose? Wen Xinya always seemed to be able to predict our every single move and turn it against us? We have suffered an enormous defeat.\u201dXia Ruya clenched the pillow tightly in her arms. There was a vicious look in her eyes. \u201cWen Xinya has destroyed everything that belonged to me. I want revenge. I must have my revenge!\u201dXia Ruya hugged her tightly and whispered into her ears. \u201cWen Xinya is just a gangster who has led a wandering life for the past 15 years. She doesn\u2019t have what it takes to be the Young Missus Wen of the Wen Family. She is always in the limelight, and everyone sings her praises as if she has lived up to her name. Xinya \u2014 with good virtues that signify fragrance, good characteristics that represent aroma builds a good reputation for generations to come\u2026 Isn\u2019t that beautiful?\u201dAfter hearing that, Wen Yuya\u2019s heart suffered excruciating pain as if an invisible hand had reached out and crushed her heart. \u201cNo, no\u2026 I\u2019m the one who\u2019s most beautiful. Yuya represents jade and signifies good virtues.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euXia Ruya brought her lips closed to Wen Yuya\u2019s ears. Her voice sounded like that of the devil\u2019s \u2014 cold, chilly, and ghastly. \u201cJade, no matter how beautiful it might be, it is just an accessory. And as for my name\u2026 Ruya, Ruya. \u2018Ru\u2019 represents resemblance or a follower. Following and resembling Wen Xinya. \u2018Ruya\u2019 simply means I\u2019m like Wen Xinya. See\u2026 how pathetic we are? Even our names are no match for Wen Xinya\u2019s.\u201dYou\u2019re reading on Wuxia world .site Thanks!\u201cNo, I\u2019m not an accessory\u2026 I\u2019m a piece of beautiful jade, not an accessory. Wen Xinya is the accessory. She must be\u2026 She must be\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya shook her head in denial. She was at the brink of collapse.Xia Ruya looked at her and hatred filled her eyes. Everyone had a devil in their heart. Xia Ruya tried to take advantage of the state of confusion Wen Yuya was in with the intention to lure the devil inside her so that she would\u2026 be embroiled in a feud with Wen Xinya.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She looked at the two waiters in the living room, and the words from the Zhou Family\u2019s housekeeper kept ringing in her head. \u201cPooh, pooh, pooh,\u201d like a bomb that could explode in her head anytime.\u201cWe, the Zhou Family, are an affluent and reputable family. We won\u2019t have dealings with just anybody. Missus Wen is considered an adopted daughter of the Wen Family, which is also another reputable family. Yet, she has not shown appropriate behavior at the Zhou Family premises. She has disregarded the Zhous, and this is unacceptable.\u201dHe was merely a housekeeper, and yet he tried to show authority in front of Ning Shuqian. He had totally disregarded her as the Madam of the Wen Family. Plus, that arrogant expression of his made Ning Shuqian even angrier, and she could not swallow her pride.\u201cMissus Wen has brought such intolerable behavior to the Zhou Family\u2019s premises. She dirtied our place and also disrupted my Young Mistress\u2019 birthday party. It is even more ridiculous that everyone at the party saw what happened, and it feels like our Zhou Family\u2019s house has instantly turned into a place for prostitution. If the news gets out to the public, what damage would it cause to our Young Mistress\u2019 reputation?\u201dThese words sounded like thunderous roars to Ning Shuqian\u2019s ears. There was giddiness in her head, and her lips were trembling. Her body became stiff. What did he mean by intolerable behavior and place for prostitution? Did something happen at the banquet venue she was not aware of?\u201cFor this incident, my Young Mistress will let it go for the sake of Young Missus Wen Xinya. For all future events organized by the Zhou Family, you and Missus Wen Yuya are not welcomed.\u201dThe Zhou Family\u2019s housekeeper spoke with despise, looking sarcastic and arrogant. His words were like a sharp-edged arrow that pierced right through her heart.She controlled her emotions and anger until the Zhou Family\u2019s housekeeper left. She then confronted Xia Ruya and found out what had happened. She could not breathe. She could only hear Xia Ruya\u2019s complaints and sobbing buzzing in her ears, giving her goosebumps. She could only feel the pain of an invisible knife slowly slicing off her flesh layer by layer.\u201cShut your mouth! Why are you crying your heart out when you were not the one raped? Can you spare a thought for Yuya?\u201d Ning Shuqian mind was clouded with rage and could not stay rationale. Blood filled her eyes as she just lashed out her anger.The Zhou Family was not being reasonable. Yuya had met with such a mishap at their premises, and they pushed the blame back to her. Then she thought of the two waiters in the living room and wanted to beat the teeth and blood out of them!\u201cAunt Ning\u2026 Sorry. I failed to protect Yuya and allowed her to go through this suffering. Please beat or scold me so that I will feel better.\u201d Xia Ruya cried bitterly, as if she had put herself in Wen Yuya\u2019s shoes and understood exactly what she went through.\u201cSo what if I beat or scold you? Can you give Yuya back her chastity? If you really cared about her, why didn\u2019t you stand up for her and go through it on her behalf?\u201d Ning Shuqian stared at Xia Ruya with coldness in her eyes.Right at that moment, Xia Ruya felt as if the icy ground she was standing on suddenly broke and she fell right through the ice. She was covered in Ning Shuqian\u2019s hatred, and her tears fell uncontrollably on to the pure white marble flooring, forming the shape of a flower when it touched the ground. She looked at Ning Shuqian with sorrow and bitterness in her eyes, and slowly unbuttoned her top one button at a time, revealing the big patches of bruises and marks caused by forceful kisses by that man on her chest that extended all the way to her waist\u2026Ning Shuqian awkwardly turned away, not bearing to look further. She took a long deep breath and gave a loud sigh, feeling embarrassed for her reaction towards Xia Ruya earlier. The pain she suffered was no lesser than Yuya\u2019s. She walked towards Xia Ruya and helped her button her top.\u201cAunt Ning didn\u2019t mean to say that. I was just angry that you and Yuya acted on your own accord at another\u2019s turf without letting me know. What were the two of you thinking? Have you ever thought that if things got out of control at the Zhou Family\u2019s premises, we might get into the bad books of the Zhou Family? Would you be able to bear such a consequence?\u201dXia Ruya fell into Ning Shuqian\u2019s arm and bawled. \u201cAunt Ning, it is all my fault. I did not stop Yuya. It was because she saw on a blog post how Wen Xinya badmouthed you and therefore lost her rationale. I could not stop her from acting recklessly. In fact, I was also angry with Xinya. That was why\u2026\u201dNing Shuqian knew that she was speaking the truth. She understood her own daughter\u2019s temperament well. Though Ruya was rational and knew when to retreat, she was soft. \u201cWhatever happened, happened. You have suffered too. And this was all because of Yuya\u2019s impulsiveness.\u201d\u201cAunt Ning, please don\u2019t say that. I grew up with Yuya. Though we\u2019re not biological sisters, we are close and have a good relationship. We share all weals and woes together.\u201d Xia Ruya continued weeping bitterly, and anyone who heard her cry would be deeply influenced by her sorrow and pain.\u201cAunt Ning knows that the relationship between you and Yuya is genuine, but you cannot always allow her to have her way. You should have discussed such an important matter with me before acting.\u201d Ning Shuqian knew her daughter well and understood that she had acted out of jealousy. The Zhou Family was affluential, and the Young Missus Zhou had always maintained a good reputation in the circle. To receive a direct invitation from Young Missus Zhou to her birthday party meant that Wen Xinya had been accepted into the circle and Young Missus Zhou acknowledged her as a friend. That was why Yuya had decided to carry out her plan of revenge at the Zhou Family\u2019s premises, with the intention to make Wen Xinya lose her chastity and ruin her reputation. When that happened, the relationship between Wen Xinya and the Zhou Family would turn sour. It sounded like a good plan, but she used the wrong strategy.Xia Ruya lowered her head. \u201cAunt Ning, I understand. This time I did not devise a good strategy. Initially, Yuya and I had wanted to teach Xinya a good lesson to avenge you, but we did not expect things to turn out this way. Rest assured, in the future I will discuss with you before making any decisions and will not act on impulse.\u201dNing Shuqian patted on Xia Ruya\u2019s hand gently. \u201cThat should be the way. Wen Xinya used to be a gangster who grew up in the streets. She is very capable of using underhanded methods. You and Yuya are young mistresses who grew up in a protected environment. How can you possibly be her match?\u201dXia Ruya agreed to her words totally. She looked at Ning Shuqian with tears in her eyes. \u201cAunt Ning, thank you for being understanding and not blaming me for what happened. I\u2019m fine. Go and take a look at Yuya! After this incident, she seems to be emotionally unstable. Please accompany her and help her get out of her depression.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing Shuqian was definitely aware that Yuya must be feeling down after such an unpleasant experience. However, it was difficult for her to say much from her identity as an adult. Moreover, Ning Shuqian was always open-minded about such matters. She was not too bothered by it but was just concerned about her daughter. Xia Ruya had hit the nail on the head. \u201cYou have suffered a bad fright as well. Stay here tonight and have a good night\u2019s rest,\u201d said Ning Shuqian.\u201cThank you, Aunt Ning. But Grandpa said\u2026 So, I think I\u2019d better go home!\u201d Xia Ruya bit on her lips and looked sorry.Ning Shuqian had also heard from Wen Yuya about Grandpa\u2019s instructions for Ruya not visit the Wen Family too frequently. She did not insist. \u201cI\u2019ll get Old Wang to send you home.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Xia Ruya replied.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As she stood in front of Wen Yuya\u2019s room, she turned the doorknob with strength as if she finally found a way to vent her frustration. But when she saw the person in the room, her anger instantly melted away and choked on her words, unable to say a thing.Wen Yuya was sitting in her room alone. There was a willow tree outside. Snowflakes were falling, cold winds howling, and the leaves of the willow tree moved gently in the wind and swayed, looking less elegant. She stared blankly at the snow outside of the window. She was reminded of how delicate and helpless the snowflakes appeared and could not help but feel like a prisoner being confined in a cold prison cell. Her world had collapsed, and she was all alone.Humiliation, despair, hatred, and pain slowly gnawed into her heart!Other than that, she could not feel even a hint of warmth.She hugged her knees tightly and sat with her body curled up in one of the corners in her room, barefooted. She looked pitiful, just like an injured butterfly who had lost one of its wings.Wen Yuya could no longer contain her sorrow as Ning Shuqian gently embraced her into her arms. She burst into tears and hugged Ning Shuqian tightly as if she had finally broken free from hell. Ning Shuqian was heartbroken to see her in this state.Ning Shuqian\u2019s lips shivered. Her heart was burning with pain like she had just gulped a big mouthful of strong alcohol.She had never seen her daughter in such a state of despair and hopelessness, almost at the brink of death. \u201cYuya, it\u2019s alright! Mother is here, everything will be fine\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Wen Yuya bawled in her hoarse voice. \u201cMother, why is my name called Wen Yuya? You\u2019ve said before that my name signifies beautiful jade. But no matter how beautiful the jade may be, it is just an accessory. So\u2026 I became someone\u2019s toy.\u201dNing Shuqian was terrified to see Wen Yuya giving up all hope. She held her tightly and assured her. \u201cYuya, listen to me. You\u2019re Mother\u2019s only treasure, not a toy. I will make those who have hurt you pay for what they have done.\u201dWen Yuya\u2019s voice turned hoarse, and her body trembled like the leaves of the willow tree in the cold wind. She wrapped her hands around herself and rubbed her arms. \u201cBut Mother, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m\u2026 I feel filthy, my body is filthy. Mother, don\u2019t come near me\u2026 I\u2019m really dirty\u2026 filthy\u2026\u201dNing Shuqian hugged her, feeling sorry for her. How could a 15-year-old young lady who had limited life experience handle such a setback? \u201cYuya, it\u2019s no big deal. Every woman will experience it, it\u2019s just a matter of time. Mother lost her virginity at around your age as well. But look at me, I\u2019m living a good life. And I even married into a rich family just like Cinderella.\u201dUpon hearing what Ning Shuqian said, Wen Yuya gradually calmed down. \u201cBut Mother, many people witnessed what happened. How am I going to face them in the future?\u201dNing Shuqian caressed her head and advised her in an affectionate tone. \u201cTime will heal it. People will soon forget what happened after some time. Everyone sympathizes with the victim. Portray yourself as the victim, and others will not rub salt on your wound. Instead, they will sympathize with you even more.\u201d\u201cMother, how am I going to forget what Wen Xinya has done to me?\u201d She thought of how Wen Xinya signified fragrance, good virtues, and characteristics that build a good reputation for generations to come, while she was just a beautiful jade that could only be an accessory. Her heart sank, and as if infiltrated by poison, hatred spread within.\u201cOf course, we will not forget. Mother will not let anyone who has hurt you off, but for now, we need to be patient.\u201d At the mention of Wen Xinya\u2019s name, Ning Shuqian was consumed with vengeance. She turned into a clawed devil and vowed to get back at Wen Xinya to avenge for her daughter.While watching television the other day, she chanced upon a report about cosmetic vaginal surgery and was shocked to find out that it would lead to infertility. Knowing that Wen Yuya might be her only child, she definitely would not allow anyone to hurt her.\u201cPatience, patience. How long more do I have to endure? Wen Xinya is just a 15-year-old street gangster, in what way am I inferior to her? Why do I have to put up with her?\u201d Wen Yuya bellowed. She recalled the scene at Zhou Tianyu\u2019s birthday banquet where Wen Xinya wore a pastel green satin dress. She was as elegant as a viburnum tree and was the center of attraction. Even Ruya could not be compared to her.As for her\u2026 Everyone at the banquet looked surprised to see her. As if their expressions were telling her that they were shocked to see the adopted daughter of the Wen family at the party.

As it was still early, Zhou Tianyu reserved a VIP room at Ninth-Heaven Club to continue partying.The party ended at around 12 midnight.After the party ended, as Wen Xinya went back to Mo residence feeling tired, she saw Grampy sitting in the living room arranging the chess set. After taking some alcohol, she became emotional, and tears started to well up in her eyes.As Wen Xinya\u2019s teary eyes sparkled, she ran over to Grampy with a smile and sat beside him. \u201cGrampy, you\u2019re not young anymore. Please take care of yourself and don\u2019t stay up late. Don\u2019t wait for me the next time if I come back late. I know my limits and will not be back too late.\u201dOld Mr. Mo looked at her rosy cheeks. Her eyes were blurry because of the alcohol. However, she was very sober and knew how to control herself. He nodded with satisfaction. \u201cYou\u2019re back. I\u2019m glad you had fun.\u201dWen Xinya grabbed the cup of tea beside the chess set and gulped it down. \u201cAn unexpected incident happened, so the birthday party ended early at 10 pm. Zhou Tianyu then made a reservation for a VIP room at Ninth-Heaven Club, so we switched venue and continued the party.\u201dShe continued and told him what happened at the party.Old Mr. Mo caressed her hair and frowned. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to imagine how Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya can harbor such evil intentions at such a young age. Fortunately, you were alert and did not fall for their trap. Otherwise, it would be disastrous. This is called \u2018getting a taste of their own medicine.\u2019\u201dWen Xinya pouted. \u201cI will never set others up. But it is not easy for others to set me up either.\u201dOld Mr. Mo nodded in agreement. \u201cWhat bullshit when people always talk about \u2018forgive and forget.\u2019 When others have the intention to harm you, you need to retaliate and let them suffer a hundred times more. It is then that they will start to become afraid and stop harming you.\u201dOld Mr. Mo was also feeling anguish inside. However, no matter how angry he was, he needed to suppress it to maintain a positive image of an influential leader in the literary world. But he could not contain his rage and blurted out these words.Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes opened wide and stared at Grampy with admiration and respect. \u201cGrampy, did you just curse?\u201dGrampy had lived up to his title as the most influential leader in the literary world indeed. He did not have the unreasonable stubbornness and thinking of an educated man. Thus, his thoughts and ideas were able to progress along with the trend. That was why he was able to hold and maintain the unshakable position of the most influential leader in the literary industry.Old Mr. Mo suddenly felt embarrassment. However, he quickly overcame it. \u201cGrampy was just expressing his anger right now. That\u2019s not a good example. Make sure you don\u2019t learn it.\u201dWen Xinya rubbed her face against Grampy\u2019s arm with coquetry. \u201cGrampy, you look so manly and domineering when you curse.\u201dOld Mr. Mo was speechless for a while.

Grampy, you have to allow me five handicap steps.\u201d\u201cGrampy will allow you 10 handicap steps.\u201d Old Mr. Mo signaled for her to make her first move.Wen Xinya took a few black seeds from the chess barrel and carefully placed them onto the chessboard.Old Mr. Mo nodded, then he placed his seeds far away to allow the black seeds to be positioned for maximum potential.Very quickly, she had finished her first 10 handicap steps. Old Mr. Mo\u2019s white seeds started moving into their strategic defending positions while Wen Xinya\u2019s black seeds proceeded to make advancements for attacks.Wen Xinya could see through Grampy\u2019s plot. While the black seeds seemed to have smooth initial advancements, the white seeds were standing by for a perfect opportunity to capture every black seed in just a few steps, hence putting the white seeds into a winning position easily.They were moving each step with deep planning and strategy, luring the opponent into their own traps. While it was hard to differentiate between real moves or tricks, Old Mr. Mo was starting to look serious.The game on the chessboard was a battle \u2014 An exciting match between a young lieutenant versus an old veteran general. Every move required careful planning and strategizing, and one wrong move could jeopardize victory!Old Mr. Mo looked at Wen Xinya with admiration!It was said that a person\u2019s temperament on the chessboard represented their character.

When the media publicized her scandals, she chose not to react while cautiously devising a plan of attack in the background. And when facing the evil plans of Xia Ruya and Wen Yuya at Zhou Tianyu\u2019s birthday party, she was observant and did not fall for their trap. She had made good progress and was able to reverse any challenges to her advantage.Old Mr. Mo counted the number of seeds on the chessboard. Wen Xinya only had five seeds less than him. \u201cYou\u2019ve made such incredible progress in such a short time. You have great talent in chess. I believe after more practice, you will soon exceed your teacher.\u201dWen Xinya laughed. \u201cAll thanks to Grampy\u2019s good guidance. Well, the saying goes like this: A great teacher produces a great student, a tiger Grampy has a tiger granddaughter.\u201dOld Mr. Mo knocked on her head lightly. \u201cYou\u2019re spouting nonsense again.\u201dWen Xinya touched her head in disagreement. \u201cI\u2019m not spouting nonsense. I have an incompetent Father. How could he have contributed to my intelligence and lovable character in any way? I\u2019m sure I have inherited my good genes from you and Mother.\u201d\u201cHow can you praise yourself so much? Every potter praises his own pots. That\u2019s a shameless behavior.\u201d Old Mr. Mo laughed. He usually had a stern front. Probably, because under the influence of alcohol, he had also become livelier that day.\u201cGrampy, didn\u2019t you notice? I was actually complimenting you.\u201d Wen Xinya teased.\u201cPlaying chess with you reminded me of when I played with your Mother when she was younger. Your Mother did not have a good chess temperament. She always regretted her moves and was indecisive and absolutely did not understand the meaning of \u2018making up one\u2019s mind on a chess move with no regrets.\u2019 She would hold her seeds in position on the chessboard without retracting her hand while observing my expression. Then she would decide whether to make that move.\u201d Old Mr. Mo smiled while recalling the past.Wen Xinya blushed. The scene of that day where she played chess with Si Yiyan suddenly flashed across her mind, and she felt a sense of guilt. Now she knew this behavior was inherited from Mother.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOld Mr. Mo did not notice her blushing as he continued, \u201cI was also reminded of your Grammy. She was known as the \u2018gifted female scholar,\u2019 but she was awful at playing chess. However, she loved to play chess as a hobby and was always asking everyone else to play with her. After everyone in the family learned from her how to play chess, her students started to beat her at it. It was one of the biggest jokes at that time.\u201dWen Xinya brushed the hair on her cheeks to the back of her ears, feeling the tip of her ears burning hot.Old Mr. Mo noticed her awkwardness and her attention drifting away. He held her right hand and slowly pried her fingers open. There was a white seed in her palm. He took a glance at the chessboard and quickly noticed the missing white seed\u2019s original position. He took the white seed from her hand and returned it to its original position. The entire situation was turned around. Wen Xinya\u2019s black seeds suffered a terrible defeat.\u201cHey you, hey you!\u201d Old Mr. Mo knocked her head. He had mixed emotions of happiness and confusion. Inheritance was a weird thing. Some habits could be naturally inherited.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - A beautiful lady with 34DPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85: A beautiful lady with 34DAtlas StudiosAfter attending Zhou Tianyu\u2019s birthday party, Wen Xinya realized the urgent need to add new clothes to her wardrobe. Her wardrobe contained most of her casual clothes, but none would be suitable for formal events. She had to make time from her busy schedule to visit Pearl Mall and shop for new outfits.When she arrived at Jo-ramst, the shopping assistant immediately came up to her and greeted enthusiastically. \u201cYoung Missus Wen, what brought you here today?\u201d\u201cI came to shop for new outfits,\u201d said Wen Xinya as she roamed between the shelves. \u201cIs there any new design launches this month?\u201d\u201cYes, there is. Young Missus Wen, please follow me.\u201dThe shopping assistant led Wen Xinya to the new launch zone. There were many different outfits suitable for all kinds of occasions. She tried on a few and picked those that she liked, then moved on to select some accessories to go with them.When Wen Xinya stepped into the accessories area, she was stunned!The accessories area only had two customers. One of them was extremely eye-catching!Si Yiyan!Beside him was a beautiful lady from Country E. The lady had a tall and slim figure and long curly brown hair that glowed beautifully under the lighting of the chandelier. She was wearing a cheongsam with purple peony design, and the skirt was only long enough to cover three inches of her thigh. That pair of seductive long, slim legs were especially enchanting.The cheongsam brought out the oriental flavor of the beautiful lady \u2014 shy yet elegant, gentle yet mysterious. Every inch of it represented a hidden meaning behind the mysterious appearance, and every button represented a lock to seal the beautiful story of the past.This beautiful lady from Country E wore a cheongsam that brought out the sexiness in her. If someone failed to dress correctly, no matter what she wore, it would make her look plain and ordinary.Subconsciously, she looked at the woman\u2019s chest. By her visual estimation, her chest size was 34D. She was suddenly reminded of that night when Si Yiyan sent her the desserts, they had an embarrassing discussion about a woman\u2019s figure. He seemed to have a special interest in the size 34D.At this thought, she called off her initial intention to greet Si Yiyan.However, he seemed to have discovered her looking at them. Si Yiyan turned over and looked towards her direction. That pair of almond-shaped eyes had a deep incomprehensible mystery and the capability to absorb all the surrounding passion and zealousness, turning them into glittering energy within his eyes.Wen Xinya\u2019s heart shivered for a moment and refused to have any eye-contact with him. She slightly raised her eyebrows and turned to walk towards another area to continue shopping for other accessories.Wen Xinya\u2019s eyes landed on the shelves with beautiful accessories on display. However, her ears were attracted to the conversation between the couple opposite her. They were speaking in E-language, which she did not understand at all. She was guessing that they were talking about accessories.Within seconds, there was the sound of footsteps behind her. Wen Xinya turned around and saw Si Yiyan leading that beautiful lady from Country E coming toward her.Wen Xinya looked at them and saw the beautiful lady from Country E holding a piece of a jade bracelet, still talking to Si Yiyan in E-language. Si Yiyan looked down and occasionally gave his opinion in one or two sentences. The couple seemed to be in good harmony.Wen Xinya had the impulse to leave the area but suddenly stopped. There was no reason for her to keep moving away from him wherever he went. And why did she have to give way to him? At the thought, she remained where she was and continued looking at the accessories on the shelves.Si Yiyan suddenly spoke in Mandarin. \u201cI\u2019m not well versed in jade bracelets either. Why don\u2019t you ask this young lady beside you? Maybe she can give you some advice.\u201dWen Xinya was surprised to hear that. Not well versed in jade bracelets? Who are you kidding? He could easily describe every detail of the jade ornaments in Grampy\u2019s house without any difficulty. How could he not know anything about jade bracelets?While she was still deep in thought, the beautiful lady from Country E turned over and looked at her with the jade bracelet in her hand. She then asked in broken Mandarin, \u201cMiss, do you think this jade bracelet suits me?\u201dWen Xinya gave Si Yiyan a hard stare. He was there shopping for accessories with his girlfriend but just had to drag Wen Xinya into the picture. Wen Xinya looked at the jade bracelet in her hand; it was a beautiful green jade bracelet. She would have chosen this to match her cheongsam. Cheongsams went well with accessories made of jade or pearl. However, the majority of people preferred to go with jade accessories.The taste of this beautiful lady from Country E was a little different. She did not actually agree with her selection\u2014perhaps it was because of their different cultural backgrounds and nationalities.She shifted her vision to the shopping assistant beside her. \u201cBring the latest jade accessories of this season for this lady to take a look.\u201dThe shopping assistant swiftly opened a drawer with a key and took out some accessories. Then she placed them on a nearby tea table with its table top made of glass.\u201cThese are our best accessories.\u201d Wen Xinya glanced towards Si Yiyan as if accepting his challenge.You wanted me to select accessories for your girlfriend. I will let your wallet bleed.The corner of Si Yiyan\u2019s lips raised a little. He could feel a sense of being pampered.Wen Xinya held a piece of a jade bracelet in her hand and smiled. \u201cThis purple violet jade bracelet looks nice and matches with the outfit you\u2019re wearing today. Look at this\u2026 This is made with the rare ice jade. It has a nice color and clarity, and there are almost no impurities. It brings out the elegance of the jade and its beauty at its purest form.\u201d\u201cYes, this is indeed beautiful!\u201d That lady took it into her hands and could not bear to let it go.Wen Xinya continued, \u201cLook at the streak of the purple element in the middle of the jade. This is the purest form of royal purple color. This color represents royalty in Country Z and commands respect. It signifies \u2018purple prosperity from the east\u2019 and \u2018purple clothing for the royalty.\u2019 Therefore, purple is a mysterious color that represents wealth and elegance.\u201dThe lady was moved by her words.Si Yiyan glanced at Wen Xinya with a smile. Her eyes were glittering and shiny, just like the stars in the sky. She seemed to know her stuff well and was able to speak like a professional. However, she was just bluffing her way through.\u201cLet me try it on for you and see if it fits.\u201d Wen Xinya took over the jade bracelet with one hand while holding the lady\u2019s hand with another. She slid the jade bracelet through her fingers and stopped right at the arch beneath her thumb. The size was just right.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh my God! It is as if this jade bracelet was customized just for you. The size fits you perfectly. Every valuable jade accessory is unique. Even if they are made to be of the same design, each piece of jade will have different color patterns, quality, and density. You must treasure this piece as you have found one that fits you perfectly. There is an affinity between you and this jade.\u201dSi Yiyan was laughing inside. She was really trying hard to bluff her way through. She even mentioned words like \u201ccustomized\u201d and \u201caffinity\u201d to describe the jade bracelet, as if this was a piece of the most valuable treasure in the world. How could anyone not want to possess it?Even the shopping assistant behind her was trying to control herself from bursting into laughter.However, the shopping assistant was filled with respect for Young Missus Wen. This was one of the most expensive pieces of jade bracelets in the shop. There were quite a few customers previously who liked it, but they gave up purchasing it when they saw the price.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I want this.\u201d As expected, that woman could not be any more delighted. As she placed her fair wrist under the light, the purple ribbon in the jade looked all the more extravagant. \u201cThank you, miss, for choosing such a fitting bracelet for me,\u201d she said.Wen Xinya replied with a smile, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m just showing my hospitality.\u201dThe beauty from Country E spoke to Si Yiyan softly in E-language, glancing at her from time to time.Wen Xinya guessed that they were discussing her. She could not help but think:how rude to talk about someone in their face.The twenty million dollars bracelet was sold. The employee joyfully brought the woman to the counter for payment.Wen Xinya wiggled her eyebrows with glee at Si Yiyan, clearly pleased with herself.Si Yiyan only gave her a slight grin before turning to the woman and accompanying her to the counter.Watching Si Yiyan accompany that woman, she no longer felt happy but rather displeased. Having lost the mood to pick accessories, she went to the shoe section to pick a suitable pair of shoes.Just like many other girls, Wen Xinya had a preference for high heels. Within moments, her attention was captured by a pair of silver-grey heels on a shelve.\u201cPlease get me this pair of heels to try on.\u201d Wen Xinya ordered the employee.The employee immediately went to get a pair with her size.Just then, Wen Xinya\u2019s phone rang. Zhou Tianyu had sent her a message, and she quickly replied.Then, she felt a pair of hands lightly holding her legs and her eyes jumped up from her phone. She saw Si Yiyan crouching in front of her with one hand holding her ankle and the other slowly removing the shoe she was wearing.Wen Xinya was stunned. She glared at her leg instinctively and said, \u201cLet me go. I can wear it myself. I can\u2019t bear the honor of having Master Si change my shoes for me. I\u2019m afraid of losing my good fortune.\u201dWen Xinya did not notice the rashness of her tone, yet Si Yiyan did. His smile was doting, and the gentleness between his eyebrows could melt the coldest of snow. \u201cWhere did your temper come from? Who offended our Ms. Wen?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because of you\u2026\u201d Wen Xinya said without thinking, but after the words left her mouth, she felt that it was not proper. She realized that in front of Si Yiyan, she could show her reckless personality easily.\u201cOh? I offended you again?\u201d There was joy in Si Yiyan\u2019s words, and he helped her to put on the silver-grey heels.Her feet looked small and slender in such an alluring color, and it complemented them well. The lace of the heels was sleek, and the high heels brought out her femininity and beauty.Si Yiyan could not help but sigh. A woman\u2019s feet could actually be as delicate as a fragile art piece.Wen Xinya was flustered and could not speak, and changed the topic while staring at him. \u201cIf you\u2019re not here to accompany your girlfriend, then what are you here for?\u201d\u201cTo help you wear your shoes!\u201d Si Yiyan took off the shoe on her other foot and put another one on.What he said made her focus all her attention on her foot as his slender fingers brushed against her skin, rousing an unexplainable tremble within herself.Wen Xinya absent-mindedly watched him.He helped her to change her shoes like a loyal servant to his queen. He stiffly changed her shoes, not stepping out of line at all, yet her whole body was burning up.Si Yiyan suddenly looked up at her and loudly explained. \u201cShe\u2019s not my girlfriend!\u201dWen Xinya woke up from her trance-like state, instinctively staring at him, and dazedly asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said, it\u2019s sad that I cannot buy the heavenly jade bracelet that you were previously selling. Were you very disappointed?\u201d Si Yiyan\u2019s gaze was concentrated on her, yet his smile had a note of mischief.He recalled her appearance when she was trying to intimidate others. She was like a proud wild cat, raising her eyebrows from time to time to provoke him. His heart fluttered as if her claws had stirred up his feelings. Her eyes were colder than usual, just like the lone stars in the winter night, looking down on him.Wen Xinya had a change of attitude, and her eyes widened while she exclaimed doubtfully. \u201cIs she not your girlfriend? How is that possible? It\u2019s not logical for Master Si to follow another woman to shop for clothes and accessories.\u201dShe said it like so, yet she did not realize that she was smiling, like how cherry blossoms fall, beautifully and mischievously.Si Yiyan smiled and explained. \u201cYi Wa is my friend from Country E. We met while on business, and it was her first time coming to the Capital city, so I brought her out to explore the city. Furthermore\u2026 she\u2019s already married, and her husband is a good friend of mine. Women in Country E are extremely loyal to their husbands after they get married.\u201dWen Xinya purposely exclaimed. \u201cThat\u2019s such a pity, she was a 34D beauty! You actually lost a chance with such a beauty, even I feel bad for you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright! Anyway\u2026 after a few years, I can get a 34D for myself too!\u201d Si Yiyan\u2019s gaze landed on her chest as he thought about that night, and she covered her chest as she stared at him. She thought about how she could grow to a 34B cup and compared herself to Yi Wa\u2019s figure.Wen Xinya instinctively covered her chest and said, \u201cSorry to disappoint you Master Si, I can only grow to a 34B!\u201dSi Yiyan smiled and said, \u201c34B isn\u2019t that bad either, B and D aren\u2019t that different anyway.\u201d\u201cDisgusting pervert!\u201d Wen Xinya hastily stood up, turned around, and walked to the accessories section, feeling a sense of heat in her face. She thought she had gone mad, talking to a man about her body in a public place. Even the thought was embarrassing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSi Yiyan smiled as he chased after her, standing beside her and touching the accessories on the shelf as he carefully chose one for her.Wen Xinya thought back to the time when Si Yiyan impatiently chose some jade jewelry for that woman, and she suddenly thought it was funny.Si Yiyan said to the employee, \u201cBring out this season\u2019s accessories.\u201d He looked at Wen Xinya, and the corner of his eyes moved up. He said with a mischievous tone, \u201cThis time, I\u2019m pleased to pay.

However, this diamond and black onyx are not bad.\u201d Si Yiyan\u2019s gaze fell on the hand accessories in front of them, and they discussed them as he asked for her opinion.She knew full well that he told Yi Wa something different, that he did not know much about jade and hand accessories! He was obviously lying! However, though she was secretly criticizing him inside, she did not know that her beautiful and tender mouth had formed a gentle smile.\u201cAlthough this diamond ring has a nice design, and the cutting and quality of the diamonds are of the highest quality, it is still not as good as the world-class jewelry.\u201d Si Yiyan examined the ring closely as he remarked.Wen Xinya nodded and agreed. \u201cThe jades produced by the Wen Corporation\u2019s accessories branch has a more perfect design.\u201dWen Corporation\u2019s jade accessories were widely popular all over the world.\u201cThen how about this black onyx! Such pure and sturdy black onyx is hard to find.\u201d Si Yiyan looked at her, asking for her opinion.Wen Xinya\u2019s gaze landed on the set of black onyx accessories, including a necklace, ring, a pair of earrings, and a bracelet. The design was detailed and modern, and they were all gorgeous.Si Yiyan laughed. \u201cBlack onyx is strong and sturdy; since ancient times it has always been a charm to ward away evil and protect oneself. It can bring one happiness and confidence, and in the long term, it can make one\u2019s skin smoother and have a joyful attitude. The attitude and life of people who wear black onyx can resist fatal temptations. The Bible had once mentioned: love as strong as death, a silence that can overcome anything. This is the best description of the black onyx. I think it suits you.\u201dIt was because of Wen Xinya\u2019s personality that he was attracted to her.The way he talked with fervor and ease, yet he mentioned that he did not know much about jewelry. She knitted her brows and said, \u201cThough the bracelet is beautiful, black gives some sort of gloomy feeling, and it seems very old-fashioned too.\u201d\u201cBlack is serious, modern, classic, noble and secretive, embodying a low-key profile. Black represents the insolence that is held back; the rebellion of the desire to control; the obsession to exaggerate; many contradicting viewpoints can be expressed through the different reflections of the color black, creating an inexpressible perfection.\u201d The best description of her was a color, and he felt that the bracelet suited her even more now.Her heart filled with pride as she saw Si Yiyan deep in thought about helping her choose a bracelet, though she did not know why. She purposely hesitated and said, \u201cOh really? I heard that only very specific people can wear black accessories, an average person cannot own them.\u201d\u201cYour skin is fair and tender, and only you can express the secretive yet noble nature of the black onyx.\u201d Si Yiyan picked up the black onyx ring and slid it gently onto her left ring finger. The ring was a little too big, however, and would only fit on her middle finger. Yet the elegant black color of the ring, complemented with the soft whiteness of her jade-like skin, brought out the best of the two colors, creating perfection.Wen Xinya looked at the ring on her left ring finger, and a flash of amazement appeared in her eyes. The citizens of Country Z believed in men taking the position of the left and women in the right, extending to wearing wedding bands. Yet many did not know that the right ring finger was the furthest away from the heart, while the left was the nearest, and there was a vein that directly connected the finger to the heart. The vein was called \u201cThe Vein of Love.\u201dSi Yiyan putting the ring on her left ring finger, was it a coincidence or was it purposefully?\u201cIt does fit you well!\u201d Si Yiyan had glitter in his eyes and stared intensely at the ring on her finger, while a multitude of emotions bubbled under his gaze.\u201cIt is quite beautiful!\u201d She composed herself and looked down at the ring, the silver band holding on to six pieces of black onyx crystals, creating a cherry blossom flower. On every crystal there was a finely cut diamond, making the ring extremely elegant.\u201cIf you like it, then we\u2019ll buy it.\u201d Si Yiyan looked at the ring on her finger, the Vein of Love connecting directly to her heart\u2026 His eyes had a glimmer of awe and admiration.Wen Xinya took off the ring, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not like I really like it!\u201dShe did not want to get a free lunch and had no reason to accept Si Yiyan\u2019s gift.Si Yiyan looked at her flawless left hand, feeling a sense of regret. When she said that she did not like it, she actually meant that she did not want to accept his gift. Yet he did not take it to heart and said to the employee, \u201cWrap the bracelet and send it to the Wen Family mansion!\u201dThe employee was taken aback. This black onyx accessory set was the season\u2019s most expensive one, and the onyx crystals had been flown over straight from Egypt. Both the quality and the color of the crystals were extremely brilliant, and the designer of the accessories was also the world\u2019s best jewelry designer. The design was modern and beautiful, attracting the attention and admiration of many, yet they were disappointed by the hefty price tag of the jewelry.Never had she imagined that this man was so rich, easily buying this expensive, luxurious bracelet for Ms. Wen. What kind of relationship did they have?After paying for the bracelet, Si Yiyan said, \u201cLet\u2019s go eat something!\u201dWen Xinya raised her eyebrows and looked at Si Yiyan. \u201cDon\u2019t you have to accompany the 34D beauty?\u201dSi Wa\u2019s angelic face and killer figure made even women\u2019s hearts race and face to turn red. She did not believe that Si Yiyan had no interest in Si Wa.Si Yiyan\u2019s eyes sparkled, and his smile was conniving. He said in a deep voice, \u201cI\u2019m only her host, and she has the same feeling towards me. But you\u2019re wrong. Her chest size is 36.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cMaster Si knows so much about his friend\u2019s wife\u2019s measurements! What a pervert! Have you not heard about leaving one\u2019s friend\u2019s wife alone?\u201dCasting covetous eyes on even his good friend\u2019s wife, he was purely a beast with human skin.The more such matters were cleared up, the more details were exposed. Only because she mentioned the 34D measurements did he notice Si Wa\u2019s measurements, or maybe men were just naturally more sensitive to the figure of women. He immediately noticed her cup size, not hesitating a single bit.Looking at how Si Yiyan was looking at her with interest, Wen Xinya then realized that she was reacting to his words and her face heated up. \u201cShe\u2026 she is your friend\u2019s wife, after all, leaving her by herself would not be nice!\u201dEven she felt that her reaction was too extreme, and her face reddened as she thought about how embarrassing she must seem in front of Si Yiyan.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSi Yiyan looked at her with an inexplicable expression and said, \u201cWho asked her to be a 34D beauty?\u201dWen Xinya looked down at her own chest and was suddenly speechless.

Old Master is waiting for you in the study room.\u201d\u201cThank you, Mother Wang!\u201d Wen Xinya gave her a nod. As she entered the living room, her gaze landed upon Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya who were all dressed up and ready to go out.Ning Shuqian glared at Wen Xinya with hatred but greeted her graciously with a smile. \u201cXinya, you\u2019re back.\u201dWen Xinya nodded and said, \u201cAunt Ning, Sister Yuya, are you two going out?\u201dWen Yuya looked as if she had not slept well. No matter how thick the makeup on her face, it could not conceal her dull eyes, making her appear weak and listless.Even though Ning Shuqian tried to pretend to be gracious, her stiff expressions revealed her true feelings.Ning Shuqian replied, \u201cYuya is not feeling well, so I\u2019m bringing her to see a doctor.\u201dConsidering how emotionally unstable she was yesterday after the incident, they did not bring her to the hospital for a checkup. After having her rest for a night, she calmed down and would bring her to see a doctor now.\u201cOh! No wonder Sister Yuya looks so listless,\u201d said Wen Xinya understandably. She recalled her past life when Ning Shuqian and Wen Yuya had plotted for her to be raped and had compromising videos of her taken. There was an outroar, and the Wen Family became the talk of the town. Anger from Grandpa, insults from Grandma, and beatings from her father were directed at her while the two of them stood idly by. Nobody cared about her health, much less bothered to bring her to the hospital. The memory of her visiting the pharmacy to purchase contraceptive pills only to have the pharmacist look at her with disdain when asking for her age was deeply etched in her mind.Without anyone to comfort her, she was haunted by her nightmares for countless nights and was swallowed up by the terror. Thinking back about the despair she felt from back then, Xinya felt suffocated. Her eyes darkened with malice as she recalled her tragic past life. Wen Yuya should have a taste of that despair and pain too.\u201cSister, you look so pretty in that outfit, just like a pure angel.\u201d Wen Yuya said to Wen Xinya, who was wearing a white dress. Her body development looked better than before, and she had grown taller too. She was brimming with youth, and there was a perceptible vitality about her. Yuya could never compare to her.At that moment, a sense of inferiority hit her. She felt cold as if the coldness had seeped into the pores on her skin and penetrated her veins into her blood, engulfing her entire body. The memory she had so carefully hidden inside her head, afraid to let it surface, was like a cold flame. It swept over her and burned her, causing her to be overwhelmed with grief.A malicious feeling arose inside of her. It was so clear and distinct as if a blood-sucking worm had latched onto her heart.\u201cThis is from Jo-ramst\u2019s new season\u2019s collection.\u201d Wen Xinya could feel the intense hatred from her gaze. Thus, she raised her head and looked straight into that pair of bloodshot eyes. Her reflection through those eyes looked ghastly.The hatred in Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes melted away in an instant, and she said while smiling ever so sweetly, \u201cThe retro feel of the clothes from Jo-ramst suits sister so well.\u201dHer eyes were slightly red as if tears had cleansed it, looking all the more penetrating. Wen Xinya started having doubts about the emotions she had seen in Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes just now. Hearing she call her 'sister\u201d again and again, Wen Xinya\u2019s heart was in a turmoil. Wen Yuya must have gone crazy! She actually called her 'sister\u201d on her own accord and even talked to her happily. This made Wen Xinya even more vigilant.As if she could sense that Wen Xinya had her guards up, Wen Yuya smiled even more brightly and said, \u201cSister, that long earring on your ear is so pretty, where did you get it? I would like to buy it too.\u201d\u201cA friend of mine gave me this earring. I don\u2019t know where to buy it either.\u201d She stroked the earring given by Si Yiyan subconsciously, and her thoughts went to him. As she thought of Si Yiyan, she recalled what happened on that afternoon in Jo-ramst.\u201cSister\u2019s friend is so nice, always giving you pretty things.\u201d Within Wen Yuya\u2019s innocent smile harbored a shred of envy that was so pure and so bright that it was blinding. She even wrapped her arms around Wen Xinya.The faint smell of perfume on Wen Yuya provoked her nerves. She pushed Wen Yuya\u2019s arms away with a pretense of indifference and replied, \u201cThis is just the way friends are, exchanging gifts with one another.\u201dAn alarm went off in her heart. Any normal person would have a drastic change in their mood upon suffering from setbacks and harm. What exactly was Wen Yuya planning?\u201cDid sister come back to visit Grandpa?\u201d Wen Yuya did not have anything planned as she realized that Wen Xinya would tense up every time she called her 'sister.\u201d This feeling where she could manipulate her emotions with every move made her happy.So, Wen Xinya is not as elegant as she made herself out to be.She was very cautious and guarded around her.\u201cYup! I haven\u2019t seen Grandpa in a long time, so I\u2019m here to see him.\u201d Wen Xinya frowned a little. The way Wen Yuya was acting annoyed her to a great extent, as if something was getting out of her control bit by bit. This Wen Yuya became so much harder to handle compared to before.\u201cGrandma went out to play mahjong while mother and I are going to the hospital. Originally, I was worried that Grandpa was going to be left alone in the house. Now that you are here, I can rest my mind.\u201d Wen Yuya was smiling so sweetly, yet her eyes were locked onto Wen Xinya. She derived a great sense of joy from her vengeance everytime Wen Xinya was on the alert or felt annoyed.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to the hospital with Aunt Ning? Hurry and go! I should go up to see Grandpa too.\u201d said Xinya with a faint smile. She had completely lost her patience to pretend cordiality with Wen Yuya.Wen Yuya smiled. \u201cSister, see you later.\u201dWen Xinya nodded and headed upstairs.The smile on Wen Yuya\u2019s face disappeared in a moment, leaving behind a cold, sly gaze. She stared at her back with so much evil intent that it could make one\u2019s hair stand on end.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNing Shuqian felt relieved. Through this incident, Yuya finally got rid of her rash behavior. \u201cYuya, have you heard of the story of the snake in the cup?\u201dWen Yuya could faintly understand the meaning behind Ning Shuqian\u2019s words. She replied, \u201cIt is a story about a man who went to his friend\u2019s house to drink and mistakenly thought that a shadow reflection in his cup was a snake swimming about. He did not listen to his friend\u2019s persuasion, drank the wine, went home thinking that he had a snake in his belly and ended up scaring himself into becoming ill. The moral of this story is that paranoia and false beliefs would lead to terror.\u201dNing Shuqian broke into a smile and said, \u201cHave you realized? The moment she heard you call her sister, she became tense and cautious. She must be suspecting that you are planning something with your sudden change. Isn\u2019t this the story of the snake in the cup?\u201dWen Yuya came to a sudden realization. Her eyes gleamed with malice as she said, \u201cI want her to always be in fear and on guard so that she would never get a day of peace.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She reached out and knocked on the door.\u201cIt must be Xinya! Come in!\u201d Grandpa\u2019s voice rang from inside.Wen Xinya turned the doorknob gently and pushed the door open. As she entered the study room, she noticed that other than her grandpa, there was also another middle-aged man who seemed about 40 years of age. He was wearing a black suit and a white shirt with a dark blue tie. Not a single strand of hair was out of place, and he exuded a sense of sternness. One look and she knew that he was a lawyer.Old Mr. Wen waved his hand and introduced him. \u201cThis is my private lawyer, Luo Wenzhe.\u201dAfter greeting him, Wen Xinya sat beside Old Mr. Wen.Old Mr. Wen said, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since you returned to the Wen Family. Thus, I plan to give you 40% of the funds and real estate under my name.\u201dXinya had returned to the Wen Family for almost three months, and her homecoming ceremony was to be held at the end of the month. Yet at present, she had no available funds. This was hardly justifiable.Wen Xinya was greatly surprised and said, \u201cGrandpa, what is the meaning\u2026\u201dOld Mr. Wen patted her hand and soothed her. \u201cYou wandered about for the past 15 years and suffered greatly. This is my compensation to you and an expression of my goodwill. Please don\u2019t reject it.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s eyes suddenly teared up. She knew that Grandpa\u2019s actions meant he recognized her as the successor of the Wen Family. \u201cGrandpa, I understand your good intentions, but I am not worthy of receiving such things.\u201dOld Mr. Wen sighed. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be your homecoming party soon, and there are many things to prepare. You cannot let your stepmother worry about you. You need to handle some things on your own, so you need some funds under your name for convenience.\u201dGrandpa\u2019s words made Wen Xinya unable to reject his offer, as what he said was all true. \u201cThank you, Grandpa!\u201dShe really needed the money! Yan Shaoqing had already found information about the territory at the West Coast and passed it to her. He was more outstanding than she had expected and had even delineated some spaces that had the potential to appreciate in value, as well as suitable projects that could be developed. He also calculated the value of the land. She really needed a huge sum of money.The reclamation of the land for the train at the West Coast would start in May of the following year, and according to the government\u2019s plans for the land, the information would be released in September or October of the current year. Once the information was released, the value of the land would increase as well. She would not stand to benefit then.Luo Wenzhe handed a few documents to Wen Xinya. \u201cOld Mr. Wen has already signed the necessary documents, and the following procedures will be carried out in three working days. By then, Ms. Wen can use this sum of money.\u201dWen Xinya looked closely at the documents, namely the investments, properties, and jewelry transfer contracts. She approximately calculated the value, and the total value exceeded two billion dollars! She could not help but take a deep breath. Grandpa was too generous!She breathed in deeply and put down the documents, raising her head to look at Grandpa attentively. \u201cGrandpa, with such a huge sum of money, are you not worried that I might spend it unwisely?\u201dShe needed to make sure that she had full control and autonomy over the money, and would not be supervised or controlled.Regarding that, Old Mr. Wen had not thought through it carefully. However, the time Xinya dealt with the scandal incident made him feel a sense of trust towards his granddaughter. She was calm and confident and did not react easily, but when she did, she was remarkable and defeated the opponent with ease, giving them a direct confrontation. Such swift and fierce methods reminded him of himself in his youth.\u201cI heard that in our social circle, some fellows like to invest in businesses that interest them. The money is for you to use, Grandpa will not interfere.\u201d The money was also a test to see how she would use it and to determine if she were a suitable successor to the Wen Family.\u201cI know, Grandpa. I will use the money wisely.\u201d Wen Xinya assured him.Old Mr. Wen noticed the firmness in Wen Xinya eyes, and his many worries disappeared.After everything had been settled, Luo Wenzhe took his leave.Old Mr. Wen placed some red sandalwood boxes in front of Wen Xinya. \u201cHere are some accessories and jewelry. If you like them, keep them. You can wear them in the homecoming ceremony.\u201dWen Xinya looked at the five red sandalwood boxes. For jewelry to be kept in such precious boxes, they must be extremely valuable. As she opened them one by one, she looked at the jewelry and took a breath of cold air.Each box contained a highest grade white jade accessory, and its quality was crystal clear like a glaze, making people awed at their beauty.One had three butterflies carved into it, and its emerald green leaves created a sense of perfection. The jewelry was pure white, and between the flowers, there was a white and yellow jade. The craftsmanship was vivid and realistic.One had a diamond and pearls, and the soft color of the pearls made the accessory seem extremely valuable and high class.One had beads on it, which were precious natural minerals from the environment. It took hundreds of thousands of years for the beads to form and had weathered many natural occurrences, yet they had a multitude of colors. The mysterious formation of the beads made them one of a kind, and there was no two alike in the world. Their beauty and mysteriousness gave everyone a sense of surprise. Furthermore, the beads were fine, smooth, and soft to the touch, not like any crystal; thus, their worth was above that of even jade and diamonds.There was even a set of such accessories, including headwear, earrings, necklaces, rings, and bracelets!The last was a rosewood accessory, and looking at the wood, it was at least 500 years old. Such pure wood exuberated a sense of tradition and value, and it was worth no less than those before it.Old Mr. Wen saw the fluster on her face and gently said, \u201cThe rosewood was given by your grandma, the diamond and pearl by your father, the glass jade by myself, and the beads and engraved accessories by your mother. I kept it all this time, hoping to give it to Ruya when she turned 18. Who knew\u2026 Anyway, it is lucky that I did not give them to her.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya looked at Old Mr. Wen with hesitation. \u201cThe things my mother left for me, were them\u2026\u201dOld Mr. Wen understood what she meant. \u201cThe things your mother left for you, some were previously given to Xia Ruya. However, once she knew that she was not the rightful heir, she gave back everything. And since you left, I asked for all the items to be put in your room, since it was cold and empty. After all, many of the things were your mother\u2019s dowry \u2014 the Wen Family has no right to touch or use them.\u201dMany in Country Z had a tradition to never use the daughter-in-law\u2019s dowry for themselves, and the Wen Family was one of many generations and was well known. Thus, they naturally followed this tradition as well.\u201cThank you, Grandpa!\u201d What Wen Xinya was most afraid of was that the things her mother had left for her were used by that bitch Xia Ruya for her own advantage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After many rounds of reduction of punishment, he was finally released in February of 2010.On the 8th of May, 2010, Ou Yangfeng submitted an appeal to the people\u2019s court of the Capital City, and on the 25th of May, 2010, the court conducted a public hearing on the case. At 3 pm in the afternoon, the court released the final verdict. \u201cWith the new evidence, we rule that the original court had the wrong jurisdiction, and the defendant is ruled not guilty.\u201dOn the 5th of June, 2010, the second trial was conducted in the second highest courts of the Capital City. At 3 pm in the afternoon, another business partner of the investment company, Zhang Zhonghai, was prosecuted for making Ou Yangfeng the scapegoat for his money laundering activities. He was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment. As the original court had the wrong jurisdiction previously, they now ruled the defendant not guilty, and an appeal was made to the Supreme Court. Thereafter, the higher order court revoked the original court\u2019s verdict and the case was retried. On the 6th of June, 2010, the Supreme Court in the Capital City ruled Ou Yangfeng as not guilty, and his criminal record was then cleared.At 2 pm in the afternoon on the 6th of June, 2010, Ou Yangfeng filed for an appeal to the Supreme People\u2019s Court in the Capital City. He requested for the investigation unit and the public safety department of the southern district to make a formal apology to him, as well as compensate 5 million dollars for his loss.The next day, the Supreme People\u2019s Court accepted the case and hearing. That day, the investigation unit and the public safety department of the southern district issued a statement to the media, making a public apology to him. They agreed to compensate 5 million dollars for his loss, and make it public that he was cleared of any criminal records.The public was in an uproar for some time.The commotion over the genius finance professor of Imperial College London being wrongfully accused of money laundering lasted for close to a month before it finally came to a rest.During that time, Lanxin Investment Corporation established by Ou Yangfeng attracted even more of the public\u2019s attention. Wen Xinya was successful in making use of the retrials and Cheng Ziyi to bring the Lanxin Investment Corporation into the spotlight.Cheng Ziyi looked at Wen Xinya and said, \u201cIt\u2019s only one case of retrial, yet it became the talk of the town. You sure made full of my resources to the very last bit.\u201dWen Xinya completely understood the rules of business exposure, the limits and extent of making use of the opportunities. Making use of his fame in the law business first to gain exposure, then using the court case to put Ou Yangfeng\u2019s life in the spotlight, and finally directing the attention to Lanxin Investment Corporation through Ou Yangfeng\u2019s court appeal. Such feats could not be pulled off by just anybody.Qiu Yifan patted his shoulder with sympathy and said, \u201cMaking use of good opportunities and being useful determine your life\u2019s worth. Congratulations, brother. You\u2019ve once again shown the worth of your life. You should be thankful to Xinya for giving you a boost.\u201dCheng Ziyi gave his leg a kick and pretended to be serious, but it was just all bite and no bark.Wen Xinya said with a smile, \u201cMy Lanxin Investment Corporation has only just been established. Without such methods, it would take a very long time for it to develop, and I need to rake in a large sum of profits within a short time. Although my method was a little too impatient and greedy, I believed that Ou Yangfeng could act appropriately. I still have to thank you guys for this time.\u201dCheng Ziyi teased. \u201cActions speak louder than words, why don\u2019t you treat us to a meal to show your gratitude.\u201dWen Xinya replied, \u201cThat\u2019s of course! I\u2019ve booked a room at Ninth-Heaven to celebrate. Feel free to order anything you want, it\u2019s all on me.\u201dSatisfied, Cheng Ziyi said, \u201cThat\u2019s more like it.\u201d\u201cHailun Investment Corporation, established in the past by Zhang Zhonghai, is now under my name. However, I\u2019ve decided to stop managing it.\u201dBack then, Hailun Investment Corporation had a bright future ahead of it. Out of greed, Zhang Zhonghai made use of the company to launder money and kicked him out of the company to make him the scapegoat. While the development of the company in the past two years had been pretty good, his decision to stop managing it was a statement to Wen Xinya that he would put everything into developing Lanxin Investment Corporation.Ou Yangfeng was indeed a smart man. Wen Xinya was contented and decided to return the favor. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to transfer 50% of the shares of Lanxin Investment Corporation to you.\u201dNot only Ou Yangfeng but Qiu Yifan and Cheng Ziyi were shocked as well after hearing her words. Although 50% of the shares may not be that significant to a major shareholder such as Wen Xinya, being willing to split and share her benefits was not something people did. Binding two people\u2019s interests together could avoid many unnecessary troubles in the future.Ou Yangfeng suppressed his excitement and replied, \u201cRest assured, I will manage Lanxin Investment Corporation well.\u201dWen Xinya nodded and continued, \u201cMy Grandpa has given me 40% of the funds and properties he had in his hands. As of now, I have $2.7 billion of money with me, and I intend to invest 700 million in Lanxin. I believe that having an anonymous investor investing such a large sum in Lanxin would be sure to attract many corporations and wealthy men to invest as well.\u201dOu Yangfeng immediately replied, \u201cI\u2019ve put together a report analyzing the stock market of the country recently. I\u2019ll be posting it onto the company\u2019s website later on under the company\u2019s name. I believe that many people will have more faith in Lanxin Investment Corporation after seeing it.\u201dOu Yangfeng had displayed his professionalism, being prepared for anything. \u201cI have no worries with the company under you,\u201d she said with ease.She then turned to Yan Shaoqing. \u201cI\u2019ve prepared one billion dollars to purchase the plot of land at the West coast. Furthermore, I\u2019m planning on buying some land at Jin City and C City. I\u2019ve already narrowed down most of the areas. Shaoqing, I\u2019ll put this matter in your care.\u201dYan Shaoqing had never handled such a large sum of money before. However, seeing as how Wen Xinya passed the rights to him without a trace of doubt, he was touched. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will handle it for you.\u201dChen Ziyi frowned and said, \u201cAlthough in the past two years the country\u2019s economy has been pushing the development of cities, using such a large amount of funds to acquire land is a very risky action. Are you not going to reconsider?\u201dWhile he was impressed by Wen Xinya\u2019s performance, these funds were to be handled under him. In order to be more cautious, he gave his own input.Wen Xinya replied, \u201cI\u2019ve made Yan Shaoqing analyze the real estate of the two cities previously, and I believe they have huge potential. Hence, I\u2019ve decided to acquire them.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn her past life, she had visited Jin City and C City before. She knew that those places would be developed into large and prosperous cities. As such, she made Yan Shaoqing do a real estate analysis report just for show. The report was well done, and her train of thought was clear with a plan. Naturally, she was able to convince Qiu Yifan.Being a lawyer, Qiu Yifan had an eye for choosing people. Despite having only one short interaction with Yan Shaoqing, he could tell that Wen Xinya had found another powerful partner. As such, Qiu Yifan was very interested in his real estate assessment report.\u201cI\u2019ll send it to you later when I get home,\u201d said Yan Shaoqing.Qiu Yifan nodded and replied, \u201cOkay!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Grandpa had arranged for Zhang Bo to drive her there, but his back had acted up recently; thus, Wen Xinya chose to walk there herself.However, Wen Xinya was quite lucky today. As soon as she walked out of the Mo Family household, she saw a taxi on the road right outside the household and frantically waved it down. The taxi stopped beside her.Wen Xinya opened the door and entered the car, whose driver was an approximately 40-year-old man. He exuded a refined and clean disposition and was nothing like a taxi driver. Instead, he looked more like a scholar.After country Z had successfully won the bid for the Olympic Games, the capital city started large changes in the service industry, and the quality of taxi services increased significantly. Therefore, she did not feel that it was strange at all.\u201cHello lady, where are you headed?\u201d The driver did not expect to get passengers in this area, so he was very surprised.\u201cTo Ninth-Heaven!\u201d Wen Xinya replied.As the driver started the car and drove steadily, Wen Xinya noticed that his driving was as good as that of a private chauffeur, making her happily surprised.\u201cUncle, why did you come here to find passengers?\u201d asked Wen Xinya casually.\u201cThat area is a private residential area, almost all households have cars, and usually no one would go there to get passengers. Today, I drove someone to that area, and when I was driving back, I coincidentally caught up to you,\u201d the driver politely answered.Wen Xinya nodded in acknowledgment.The driver did not seem like a talkative person and focused on driving the car.It was June, and though it was already in the evening, the weather was still hot and stuffy. Though the air-conditioning was turned on and it was quite comfortable, Wen Xinya still felt that it was quite stuffy and wanted to open the windows. However, she thought of how the driver had already turned on the air-conditioning and let it go.Wen Xinya smelled a faint fragrance which made her feel sleepy and suddenly became more vigilant. She wanted to open the windows, but she soon realized that the windows were sealed shut.She pretended to sneeze and put her hand in her bag. \u201cMister, the fragrance in the car is so nice, it seems as though it can calm down the senses. Could you tell me, where did you buy such a fragrant air freshener? These few days, I have been suffering from insomnia, and I hope that the fragrance can give me better sleep.\u201dThe driver saw that Wen Xinya was becoming tired and his gaze became darker. \u201cI don\u2019t know as well, my daughter bought it for me and said that it smelled good, so the passengers in the car would like it too.\u201dWen Xinya casually put her hand into the pocket and said in a pitiful tone, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad, I really like this fragrance.\u201dThe driver smiled but did not answer.Wen Xinya knitted her brows and said, \u201cMister, could you turn off the air-conditioning? I feel a bit stuffy and want to open the windows.\u201dAs she said that, her gaze turned to the driver.The driver\u2019s expression changed, and he looked out of the window. After a long time, he answered, \u201cJust tolerate it for a while, Miss! The weather outside is really hot; the air-conditioning is much more comfortable.\u201dWen Xinya felt it harder to breathe, and the fragrance made her steadily lose her consciousness. She felt her eyelids start to droop and lose the energy in her body. Was the fragrance in the car actually the smell of chloroform?\u201cMister, I think you\u2019re taking the wrong road, this doesn\u2019t seem like the road to Ninth-Heaven?\u201d As she looked out and saw that the car was driving on a side road, she knew that she was in trouble. She composed herself and opened her handbag casually without gaining the notice of the driver.\u201cThis is the road to Ninth-Heaven, but not many people know about it. Miss, you seem tired, why don\u2019t you take a short nap and I\u2019ll wake you up when we get there.\u201d The driver saw that there were fewer cars on the road and knew that she was becoming impatient; thus, his tone became harsher.Wen Xinya put her hand in her bag and grabbed ahold of a mini-electrocutor that was to be used against perverts. At that moment, the car turned at a bend, and Wen Xinya used all her energy to take the electrocutor out of her bag and quickly lashed it on the driver\u2019s head.The driver had to concentrate when making the turn and was focused on the road, so he did not expect that she would come up with this. He tried to duck away but the electrocutor still landed on his face, and the numbing pain made him unable to breathe. He turned the steering wheel with the hand on the wheel, and the car made a screeching stop.The car suddenly took a halt and Wen Xinya was thrown forward, the pain hit her like a blunt chisel, hitting her head severely. The sharp pain started to spread through her head. \u201cOuch\u2026\u201d\u201cBitch! How dare you try to hurt me, you think I won\u2019t dare to harm you?\u201d The driver swiftly pounced on the front passenger seat, pulling her hair and hitting her head on the car window harshly.Blood dripped down the window and created a strange bloodstain as fresh, scarlet-red blood ran down her neck.The extreme pain cleared Wen Xinya\u2019s mind, so she reached out and grabbed the man\u2019s groin. She had grown up on the streets and learned many ruthless self-protection skills, which were nothing to feel ashamed about.\u201cAh!\u201d The driver\u2019s yelps of pain rang through the car as he let go of Wen Xinya, putting his hands between his legs. He said in extreme pain, \u201cBitch, you want to die?\u201dWen Xinya took the chance to grab the air freshener on the car dashboard and turned to stuff it into his mouth. The freshener contained chloroform which could make people drowsy and faint.Sadly, she underestimated the man\u2019s strength. He held onto her wrist and harshly smashed it against the car window a few times. Wen Xinya felt her hand turn numb with pain and the chloroform fell on the car floor.\u201cWho are you, and what do you want with me?\u201d Because Wen Xinya had inhaled a lot of chloroform before, she felt herself losing consciousness and forced herself to ask him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to know who I am. It seems like I underestimated you. You inhaled so much chloroform but can still keep a clear mind and attack me.\u201d The driver\u2019s face became distorted; nothing like a gentleman anymore. He picked up the air freshener and opened the cover, putting it right under her nose.Wen Xinya naturally held her breath and shook her head, trying to prevent herself from inhaling the chloroform.The driver held her hair and pulled it down sharply, and her head followed. She took a short breath, and the acrid, sharp smell of chloroform filled her nostrils. Her mind suddenly became muddled, and she felt herself descend into darkness.In her state of confusion, one hope flashed through her mind: She hoped that Xu Zhenyu would receive her message and quickly save her!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you are acting as an investor for Lanxin, then you would need to go to Lanxin to submit the relevant documents. However, though you are considered a celebrity, for Lanxin\u2019s current threshold for investors, you might not have enough money to qualify to be one.\u201dCheng Ziyi\u2019s expression turned dark and kicked him. \u201cHey, you think my legs aren\u2019t long enough to reach the threshold of Lanxin? If it weren\u2019t for me helping Lanxin gain popularity, no one would know about it now.\u201dOu Yangfeng said with a straight face, \u201cDon\u2019t be upset, all I\u2019m saying is that if I\u2019m helping you as a friend, there would be no issues.\u201dCheng Ziyi could not help but become agitated. \u201cHey, you\u2019re messing with me!\u201dQiu Yifan and Yan Shaoqing could not control their laughter, and Qiu Yifan impolitely said, \u201cHe\u2019s messing with you.\u201dOu Yangfeng tried to prevent himself from laughing. \u201cHow much are you planning to buy?\u201dWaving his hand, Cheng Ziyi indifferently said, \u201cSince you think so highly of this share, then one million!\u201dAs a lawyer, such jobs which included playing in the stock market with high risks should not be dabbled in for too long; otherwise, their job would be interfered with. After dabbling in the stock market for a short time, it was best to leave quickly.Qiu Yifan looked at his watch and said, \u201cIt\u2019s already 6 pm, why is Xinya still not here?\u201dOu Yangfeng also felt that it was strange. \u201cXinya is always very punctual, she would never make anyone wait. Maybe because five to six is the peak hour period where most people end work for the day, she\u2019s caught in a jam?\u201d\u201cIf it were a jam, she would call and notify us. Could it be something else?\u201d Qiu Yifan and Wen Xinya had interacted with each other many times, so he understood her better.\u201cI\u2019ll give her a call.\u201d Ou Yangfeng took his phone out and called Wen Xinya\u2019s phone.\u201cThe person that you are trying to reach is currently unavailable.\u201d The robotic tone of the automatic reply service then spoke in English. Ou Yangfeng knitted his brows and tried two more times, but reached the same dead end.\u201cWhat happened, can\u2019t the call go through?\u201d Yan Shaoqing hurriedly asked.Ou Yangfeng nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t reach her phone. I called three times, but none of them got through.\u201dCheng Ziyi crossed his legs and joked. \u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t want to treat us to dinner, so she purposely didn\u2019t answer her phone so that she could stand us up!\u201dQiu Yifan kicked him harshly. \u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense, Xinya isn\u2019t that type of person. She was probably caught up in something urgent.\u201dCheng Ziyi immediately uncrossed his legs and furiously said, \u201cQiu Yifan, you silly person, you\u2019re too mean. I was just kidding, why do you need to be so serious!\u201dOu Yangfeng said, \u201cLet\u2019s order something first. Xinya is expected to get here soon.\u201dQiu Yifan nodded and called the waiter over.After ordering some cold dishes to go with the alcohol, the dishes soon arrived. At 6 pm, Wen Xinya still had not come, and Ou Yangfeng, Qiu Yifan, and the others were starting to get worried. They called her phone again and again, but none got through.\u201cI\u2019ll give Old Mr. Mo a call.\u201d Qiu Yifan said as he called Old Mr. Mo.Old Mr. Mo was in his study, drawing. One hand held the brush, and the graceful movements of the brush created soft lines, making a beautiful scenery of the environment. The chapped edges of the lines created an authentic yet clear drawing of the mountains and rocks, and the sharpness of the brush strokes was bold and tough.Suddenly, he received a call from Qiu Yifan. He felt it strange as he was supposed to be having dinner with Xinya, and it was unexpected that he would call.\u201cOld Mr. Mo, Xinya was supposed to have dinner with us at Ninth-Heaven today, but she hasn\u2019t arrived until now. Furthermore, her phone is unreachable, and she isn\u2019t at home. Is she caught up with something?\u201d\u201cShe set off at five-thirty to Ninth-Heaven, how could it be that she has not arrived yet?\u201d Old Mr. Mo\u2019s hand trembled, and the ink on the brush splattered on the parchment paper. The stains on the paper were unerasable, and the splatters made the entire drawing ominous and dark.\u201cWhat, she left at five-thirty?\u201d Qiu Yifan\u2019s voice became tense. From the Mo household, she only needed 20 minutes by car to reach Ninth-Heaven. It was already six-thirty, even if she were in a jam, it would take at most an hour to get there.\u201cYes, before she left, she said goodbye to me. She said that she had already arranged dinner with everyone and had nothing else on. If she had, given her personality, she would have called to inform you.\u201d Old Mr. Mo had an ominous premonition in his heart, and his right eyelid would not stop twitching.Qiu Yifan noticed that his tone became urgent and quickly tried to appease him. \u201cOld Mr. Mo, don\u2019t be too worried yet. Maybe she had something at the last minute, just try to contact her first.\u201d\u201cI had previously asked Uncle Zhang to send her there, but recently his back has been acting up. She said that she arranged the dinner on her own, so she would make her way there by herself. Recently, there have been many incidents with taxis, and a girl being alone like her, she must have met with something bad.\u201d Old Mr. Mo\u2019s hand started to shake, and he could not help but think of the previous days\u2019 news about how taxi drivers kidnapped their passengers and brutally murdered them and hid the corpse. He suddenly felt suffocated.Qiu Yifan heard Old Mr. Mo\u2019s loud breathing and hurriedly consoled him. \u201cOld Mr. Mo, I\u2019ll make my way there immediately. We\u2019ll talk when we reach there.\u201dQiu Yifan hung up, and his facial expression became very serious. \u201cXinya might be in some trouble. Old Mr. Mo said that she left at five-thirty to come to Ninth-Heaven.\u201dOu Yangfeng and everyone else was anxious. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euQiu Yifan picked his suit up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the Mo household to find Old Mr. Mo first. He didn\u2019t seem fine when he was on the phone just now, and I\u2019m quite worried about him.\u201dOu Yangfeng and Yan Shaoqing said, \u201cI\u2019ll come with you. You\u2019ll have help if there\u2019s an issue.\u201dCheng Ziyi also said, \u201cI\u2019ll go to the police station to find out if there\u2019s been a car accident or any other issues nearby.\u201dThey hurriedly ran out of Ninth-Heaven and drove to the Mo household.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He worriedly called Wen Xinya\u2019s phone, but the cold automatic reply greeted him and made his heart cold all of a sudden.He hurriedly called Uncle Zhang, Mother He, and Mother Jiang over. \u201cXinya\u2019s friend just called. He said that Xinya is missing.\u201dUncle Zhang was shocked. \u201cWhat? Young Mistress is missing?\u201dMother He and Mother Jiang were also extremely worried. Trembling, they asked, \u201cHow could Young Mistress be missing for no reason? Did you make a mistake, Old Mr. Mo?\u201dOld Mr. Mo quickly asked, \u201cDid anyone of you hear her say she was going to do something important?\u201dUncle Zhang, Mother He, and Mother Jiang all shook their heads. \u201cNo, Young Mistress had even specially prepared a nutritious porridge for me before she left. Mother Jiang was beside me too, and Young Mistress didn\u2019t say she had anything else.\u201dOld Mr. Mo\u2019s heart started to tense up. \u201cThen, where did she go? Her phone is unreachable, and we can\u2019t contact her. What should we do?\u201dMother He and Mother Jiang were extremely perplexed. \u201cOld Mr. Mo, maybe you could call Young Mistress\u2019 phone again. Her line could be engaged just now.\u201dOld Mr. Mo suddenly had a ray of hope shining into his heart. He immediately picked his phone up and called Wen Xinya\u2019s phone again, but the automatic reply played persisted.Old Mr. Mo thought of something and hurriedly called the security post telephone. \u201cI\u2019m Mo Xianqi, I would like to ask if you saw my granddaughter, Wen Xinya, go out just now? Which direction was she headed?\u201dOnce the policeman in the watchhouse heard that it was Mo Xianqi from Villa Five, he said respectfully and politely, \u201cHello Mr. Mo, I saw Ms. Wen leave the villa at about five-thirty. She hailed a taxi in the direction of the south.\u201dOld Mr. Mo had an inkling of the matter at once. \u201cThis is a private residential area, almost every household has at least one private car. Usually, there will not be any taxis here. How did she manage to find a taxi once she walked out?\u201dHearing him say that, the policeman also found it strange. Usually, even in ten days or half a month, it was unlikely that they would see a taxi in that residential area. \u201cI had previously thought that Miss Wen had called the taxi into the area. Now that you brought it up, I recall something. I heard from the other policemen that recently, there\u2019s been taxis coming and going in the area, but because it is always at different times of the day, I didn\u2019t pay too much attention to it.\u201dThe policeman\u2019s words were like a bolt out of the blue for Old Mr. Mo. \u201cDid you see the license plate of the taxi that Xinya took?\u201dHe had a feeling that the recent appearance of taxis in the private residential area was not a coincidence but premeditated.For something like this to happen was partly the responsibility of the policeman as well. Thus, he did not dare to be sure of the issue. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice it, but there\u2019s a security camera at the entrance. I will send you the videotapes immediately.\u201dOld Mr. Mo urgently said, \u201cSend me all the footage of the past few days.\u201dThe policeman said, \u201cYes, Old Mr. Mo, please don\u2019t worry. I will ask the other policemen who were on duty if they are aware of any incidents.\u201dAfter hanging the phone up, Old Mr. Mo paced in the kitchen with an anxious expression.Uncle Zhang quickly asked, \u201cWhat did the policeman say?\u201dOld Mr. Mo told Uncle Zhang about the situation at hand, and Uncle Zhang\u2019s face paled. \u201cHow could a taxi come into a private residential area to find passengers, don\u2019t tell me this was all planned?\u201dMother He immediately said, \u201cDon\u2019t spout nonsense, we still don\u2019t know much about what happened. Maybe her phone is spoiled, or there\u2019s been an incident on the road, or a jam.\u201dHowever, Mother Jiang was not so optimistic, and she repeated, \u201cWhat should we do now? Amitabha, please protect Young Mistress and let her be safe.\u201dUncle Zhang was distraught and reprimanded himself. \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault that you were useless, if not Young Mistress wouldn\u2019t have taken a taxi. Young Mistress is still so young, it\u2019s not safe for her to go out at night. I should have driven her there instead.\u201dAt that moment, Qiu Yifan and the others hurriedly arrived. When they were on the road, Cheng Ziyi had already called to tell them that from five-thirty to six-thirty, there had not been any incidents on the road at the southern district.\u201cOld Mr. Mo, how are things?\u201d asked Qiu Yifan worriedly.\u201cI have a feeling that Xinya was kidnapped. It could have been planned.\u201d Old Mr. Mo was laden with anxiety.\u201cWhat?\u201d Ou Yangfeng and Yan Shaoqing paled.Qiu Yifan did not have a good expression either.After a while, the policeman arrived with the videotapes with a heavy expression. \u201cOld Mr. Mo, I have already contacted the other policemen to understand the situation. Recently, there has been a particular taxi that has been entering and leaving the residential area. We understand that the residents in Villa Eight have been calling for taxis because their car is spoiled. Therefore, we did not think that it was out of the blue. I compiled the information from several people and can confirm that it was the same taxi.\u201dNo matter how they saw it, the fact that it was the same taxi made it all the more suspicious. Because the watchhouse had three different shifts and the taxi always entered at different timings, no one would have suspected anything.Old Mr. Mo\u2019s expression became darker and darker. He took the videotapes from the policeman and put it into the computer to watch. When the time was almost at five-thirty-two, Xinya had left the residential area, and just at that moment, a new taxi from the capital city drove towards her. She waved the taxi down and it stopped right beside her.\u201cZoom in to the taxi\u2019s license plate.\u201d Old Mr. Mo instructed Ou Yangfeng.Ou Yangfeng tapped twice on the keyboard, and Old Mr. Mo quickly wrote the license plate number down. \u201cZoom in on the driver\u2019s face!\u201dOu Yangfeng closed up on the driver\u2019s face.\u201cDownload the picture!\u201dThey watched the videotapes from the past few days and realized that it was the same taxi that entered and left the villa at different shifts of the watchhouse. It was justified that Old Mr. Mo had suspected that this was a planned kidnapping.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOld Mr. Mo hurriedly called the south district police station\u2019s superintendent and told him about his suspicions. Then, he sent him the picture of the driver\u2019s face as well as the license plate number. The police station soon received more news that that taxi was parked at the end of Willow Road. The drivers that passed it by found large amounts of blood on the car and had reported it to the police. The police officers nearby rushed to the area and found a large number of sedatives in the taxi as well as marks of a brutal fight. Currently, they were sending more police officers to the scene and could not confirm if Wen Xinya was dead or alive yet.Based on the police station\u2019s analysis, they could confirm that this indeed was a premeditated kidnapping and immediately opened the case. Then they sent a group of specialists of kidnapping incidents to handle the investigation.After getting the news from the police station, Old Mr. Mo lost all blood flow in his body, and his body went cold. He felt a sharp pain in his chest and could not stand up properly. \u201cUncle Zhang, call the Wen Family immediately!\u201dThe Wen Family were well-known in the business industry and had many connections so they could have a solution.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why aren\u2019t they here yet?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Actually, the customers that booked the room are already here, but for some unknown reason, they hurriedly left. I\u2019ve informed the head waiter.\u201d\u201cWho booked the private room?\u201d\u201cIt was the Young Mistress of the Wen Family.\u201d\u201cDid anyone call to confirm if she had something urgent to attend to? Is the reservation for the room canceled?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve called, but her line can\u2019t be reached.\u201dHearing the title of the Young Mistress of the Wen Family, Xu Zhenyu actively listened in the conversation. He did not expect her also to book a private room at Ninth-Heaven and wondered who she had invited.As he thought about that, Xu Zhenyu deliberately took his phone out and was ready to call her, but no one expected his phone to run out of battery and shut down. He quickly changed the battery of his phone and turned it on.A string of messages popped up on the screen, and one thread was from Wen Xinya. He frantically opened the message. \u201cHelp me, willow road car plate license capital BXXXX.\u201dThe message was sent at five forty-two, but it was already six-fifty. The message was sent an hour ago.Xu Zhenyu\u2019s pupils constricted, and he saw red. His entire body ran cold, and it felt like his heart had a large net around it that suddenly tightened, causing him to be unable to breathe.She did not even have the time to type in punctuation marks in that short line of words, yet it revealed the terrifying danger she was in. He anxiously called the Mo Household.The call was answered by Old Mr. Mo, and he asked directly and bluntly, \u201cI\u2019m Xu Zhenyu. Can I ask, did anything happen to Xinya? I received a call of help from her.\u201dOld Mr. Mo\u2019s trembling voice rang through the phone.Xinya had gone missing, and the police suspected that it was a planned kidnapping! They could not confirm whether she was alive or dead.The taxi that Xinya was in was found on Willow Road, and it seemed like there had been a major fight in the taxi with large amounts of blood and sedatives.Old Mr. Mo said many things to him, but other than those two lines, he did not hear a single word he said. Xu Zhenyu\u2019s body violently staggered, and then he ran out of Ninth-Heaven as though he was crazy, driving straight to the Mo Household.He first called Gu Junling\u2019s phone. \u201cJunling, Xinya has gone missing, and the police suspect it\u2019s a malicious kidnapping. The taxi that Xinya was in was found at Willow Road, and the license number is BXXXX. Use your family\u2019s blacklist and help me check it. I\u2019ll owe you a favor.\u201dGu Junling was extremely shocked by Xu Zhenyu\u2019s news. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYes, Xinya had sent me a message calling for help before, but my phone had no battery and shut down; only just now did I receive it. I also called the Mo Family to confirm, and it was Old Mr. Mo that personally answered the phone. The police are at the Mo Family\u2019s now.\u201d\u201cOk, I\u2019ll send someone to check immediately. Don\u2019t talk about owing favors, Xinya is my friend too.\u201d Gu Junling hung up the phone and arranged for someone to check the license plate.After that Zhou Tianyu called, his voice was anxious and worried. \u201cXu-er, what\u2019s this about Xinya being kidnapped?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have the time to talk to you now, call the Mo Household and ask Old Mr. Mo yourself! I\u2019m hanging up first.\u201d Xu Zhenyu said as he ended the call.He then called Old Master Xu. \u201cGrandpa, Xinya has been kidnapped. You have a large influence in the military, could you use the military\u2019s resources and power to help find where Xinya is?\u201dOld Master Xu was also very worried when he heard that Xinya was kidnapped, but Xu Zhenyu\u2019s words made him extremely angry. \u201cWhat rubbish are you saying? The police are in charge of looking for missing persons, what are you doing asking me for help instead of the police? The military\u2019s power is for serving the country and the people; it is a serious and solemn sector. How could you use it for yourself just when you want to, I think you\u2019ve lost your mind since you are too anxious.\u201d He scolded.Xu Zhenyu was extremely anxious, and his words were also quite unreasonable. \u201cGrandpa, is Wen Xinya not a Z Country resident? Does she not deserve the protection of the state? After all, it is just borrowing the military\u2019s resources and power, you make me seem like I don\u2019t respect the country and the military sector.\u201dOld Master Xu\u2019s tone softened a bit. \u201cYou rascal, this country has its own laws, and the military also has its own rules. As the leader of the military, I can\u2019t just break the rules for myself as and when I like it.\u201dXu Zhenyu rudely said, \u201cGrandpa, if you don\u2019t help me this time, you can forget about me going to the army.\u201dGrandpa had wanted him to serve in the army the most, and he knew that if he used that to threaten Grandpa, he would definitely compromise.Old Master Xu was very agitated. \u201cYou rascal, you\u2019ve decided to serve in the army?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to help me this time, I\u2019ll join the military in July this year.\u201d This had already been previously decided, but he did not tell his family.Old Master Xu quickly said, \u201cI\u2019ll drive to the military base immediately. I\u2019ll take about two hours of traveling and will call you once I\u2019ve reached there.\u201dHe was afraid that Xu Zhenyu would take back his words, so he quickly ended the call.Although he had Grandpa\u2019s help, he still had to wait for two hours to obtain any information. Whether Xinya was currently alive or dead was unclear, and no one knew if anything could happen in two hours.Xu Zhenyu punched the steering wheel, his face filled with regret and self-loathing. If only his phone had not been turned off, he could have received Xinya\u2019s call for help in time and save her more quickly\u2026 It was him that caused her to be in danger yet again! Until now, no one knew if she was alive or dead.His car sped on the road, and he rushed past four traffic lights. The traffic siren followed his car as he drove.When his car reached the exit leading to the Mo Household and Willow Road, he quickly turned and drove towards Willow Road.Xu Zhenyu was like a demon, and both his eyes stared at the road in front of him as his head filled with dark thoughts about a past dream. He remembered that in the dream, he also found out that Wen Xinya got kidnapped, and at that time, someone injected massive amounts of liquid drugs into her, causing her to become addicted to drugs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe somewhat remembered the place where Wen Xinya was being held in the dream, and it seemed like it was in a stone house at the Southern Ridges not far away from Willow Road. The stone house was especially for hunters in the mountains to rest in, and usually, no one would go there.In reality, Wen Xinya had also been kidnapped, and the location was also Willow road. Could it be that she was really there?Once he had that thought, his frenzy became uncontrolled, and he drove like he had no care in the world towards the Southern Ridges.At that moment, Xu Zhenyu could not differentiate reality from his dreams. He only had one goal in his heart \u2014 find Wen Xinya.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A young man in black entered.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Si Yiyan asked solemnly.With some hesitation, the young man replied, \u201cIn the capital city, Gu Junling has just provoked the people at Black Friday. It seems that Miss Wen has been kidnapped. She is nowhere to be found, unconfirmed if dead or alive.\u201d\u201cSay that again.\u201d Si Yiyan had a cold gleam in his eyes. Under his icy stare, the young man felt his glare piercing into his soul, and he froze in place as if time had stopped.The young man looked at him in terror and repeated, \u201cMiss Wen has been kidnapped, and it is unconfirmed if she\u2019s dead or alive.\u201dThe black and white room exuded a quiet and still atmosphere. The tension was heightened in the gloomy room that was dull and eerie, just like a nightmare. In that room, it felt as if the lights were coming from the afterlife, threatening to pull them into the demon realm if they let down their guard.\u201cGu Yuehan, you have five minutes. I want to know everything that has happened.\u201d Si Yiyan slowly pushed the white sterile blanket off of him. Shirtless and with his torso wrapped in a thick layer of bandages, fresh blood seeped into the bandages on his chest due to his vigorous movement.\u201cNinth Master, the doctor said you are not to get out of bed for now because you are still badly injured,\u201d said Gu Yuehan as he watched the fresh blood on his chest staining the thick layer of bandages. With the blood on his shoulder exposed, the smell of iron filled the air in the room, making his skin crawl.He knew better than anyone the severity of the wound on the Ninth Master\u2019s chest. That bullet had gone straight into his chest, causing him to bleed profusely. Yet, his enemies continued to chase them close by their tails. Blood had stained his entire white shirt, and he was dripping a trail of fresh blood as he moved.When help finally arrived, Ninth Master had already passed out due to blood loss. For half a month, he stayed by his side as Ninth Master remained out cold, watching his vital signals fluctuate on the monitors. It was truly nerve-racking as Ninth Master fought between life and death. The day before, he finally woke up.Si Yiyan looked even more depressed with his hair in a mess as his fringe covered his subtle but dazzling eyes. Underneath that brilliance was a frighteningly cold, unfeeling gaze. \u201cFour minutes left.\u201dGu Yuehan turned pale and immediately said, \u201cI will go now.\u201dAfter Gu Yuehan rushed out of the room, Si Yiyan put on the black shirt beside his bed with haste, covering the bloody wounds on his chest completely. He was now back to being that sophisticated, dignified, cold, and unfeeling Si Yiyan.Four minutes later, Gu Yuehan entered the room once again. Si Yiyan was sitting on the sofa fully dressed now, his fingers furiously typing the keyboards on his laptop. His hands were graceful, with long and proportionate fingers; they were firm and strong, giving out commands one after another.\u201cNinth Master, all the information you want is here.\u201d Gu Yuehan passed him the report and looked at the commands he had given out on the laptop. He had actually enlisted the help of the entire force in the capital city. That little girl may be only 15 years old, but she held an important place in his heart.Si Yiyan took the report. Skimming through it quickly, he understood everything in just half a minute. \u201cPrepare a car. I\u2019m going back to the capital city right now.\u201dHis clear, commanding voice allowed no room for disagreement. Gu Yuehan started to panic and said, \u201cNinth Master, your injury is too serious. If you don\u2019t rest properly, you may not recover. Furthermore, we have to travel to Italy tonight at 1 AM. If you rush to the capital city now, you won\u2019t be able to make it for the flight.\u201dThey did not know who leaked the news of Ninth Master coming back to the country. With the people in the mafia putting 100 million dollars on his head, Ninth Master was in a precarious situation. If he did not leave Z Country soon, the consequence might be dire.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to question my decision. I\u2019m very clear on the situation in Italy.\u201d Si Yiyan\u2019s icy glare landed on Gu Yuehan. With all that, his eyes still glowed, and his lips were still beautiful.Gu Yuehan said in terror, \u201cNinth Master, your information leak this time around was obviously done by a traitor in the force in Italy. Furthermore, that person is in a high position. We have to return immediately to settle it. Otherwise, it will ruin everything you\u2019ve worked hard to build over the past years.\u201dAs Si Yiyan closed his laptop and stood up from the sofa, a surge of pain shot through him as he aggravated the wound on his chest. His brows furrowed in pain, and he staggered as his legs gave out.Gu Yuehan cried out. \u201cNinth Master!\u201dSi Yiyan glanced at him and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right, the situation in Italy is equally important. That\u2019s why you should go to Italy first. Once I\u2019m done here, I will meet you there.\u201dGu Yuehan eyes widened in shock. He was only an assistant to the Ninth Master. There was nothing he could do even if he were to go to Italy first. Ninth Master was intentionally sending him away so that he would not interfere with him rescuing Miss Wen. \u201cNinth Master, I will go prepare the car.\u201dAfraid that he would be rejected, Gu Yuehan rushed out of the room like the wind.Si Yiyan lit up a cigarette. The way he held a cigarette was different from others. People normally held one in between their index fingers and middle fingers, yet he held it with his thumb and index finger. With the white cigarette in between his fingers, they looked elegant as the fumes slowly dispersed in the air. Meanwhile, his worry was slowly swallowing him.He took a deep breath of the smoke in a dignified manner. He had never felt such anxiety in his life before, feeling as if every single minute was torture.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNinth Master, the car is ready!\u201d Gu Yuehan entered hurriedly. When he saw the Ninth Master holding a cigarette, he was shocked. He rarely smoked.Si Yiyan spat out circles of smoke in the air, dispersing the fog of smoke in front of him. He watched as the ashes from the cigarette fell onto the floor. Just like the cigarette, his rationality was burning out too.He extinguished the cigarette on the ashtray on the tea table. It was done so gracefully yet maliciously, crushing the cigarette into tiny pieces within moments. Gu Yuehan trembled at the sight.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Si Yiyan strode forward before the words even left his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wen Xinya found herself lying on a cold, icy floor. Her body was numb and weak, and her hands and legs were tied by a thick rope that was as thick as her fingers. The rope was tightly and painfully bound against her wrists and ankles.From the window, she could see that the sky was getting dark. Inside the house, she could tell from the dimness that the house was made of stone. There was nothing in the house, except a hole made of stone.It was a familiar scene in the stone house. She observed the room carefully, and her pupils slowly dilated. Her initial calmness slowly faded away while being consumed by fear!The coldness of the evening entering into late night sent a chill down her spine. It was cold, and she had shivers and goosebumps all over her body.A tsunami of fear and despair overwhelmed her as tears rolled down her cheeks silently and down to her neck. The coldness entered her bloodstream and almost froze the blood in her body. The memories of the past swamped into her mind like a burning flame, the unbearable heat of the flame burning her till death.No, this was not a coincidence!It was not like what she thought!The timing was not correct! The person involved was not correct either!No! Incorrect! Impossible!She kept repeating these words in her mind.She wriggled her restless body in a panic, and her fingers suddenly felt a cold, icy object with a sharp tip. She was exhilarated and continued touching and feeling that object, realizing that it was a piece of small rock. She used all of her remaining strength and held the piece of rock in her hands tightly.She curled up her body so that she could reach her legs that were tied together. Then, she clumsily used the rock to rub against the rope that was binding her legs. As if being rubbed by the edge of a blunt knife, every movement was painful, almost rubbing her skin off.Wen Xinya\u2019s face was pale and white, and she sweated profusely, causing sweat the size of peas mixed with tears to roll down her face. Her legs were already bruised and bloody from the friction, and the pain kept attacking her body until she was numb\u2026Wen Xinya clenched her teeth and tried to gain a sitting position when an acute pain pierced her waist. But that could not stop her determination to save herself.After trying a few times, Wen Xinya finally sat upright. She was totally wet from perspiration with no more energy in her body. She used her hands that were tied by a rope to support her legs, then she untied the loosen rope on her legs. By now, she was already numb and lack of energy. It was probably considering that her escape was not a possibility, the kidnapper did not tie the rope extremely tight. And neither did he tie her hands to the back of her body. This gave her a chance to break free.Suddenly, there was a sound at the door. Then, the wooden door 'screeched\u201d open. Wen Xinya sighed and started to drown in despair. Just a little bit more and she would have been able to escape\u2026The stone house was immediately lit up by a bright orange light. The rays from the orange light instantly pierced into her eyes, causing her discomfort and her tears of fear to continue to flow. She tried to look at the direction of the person who just came into the room under the blinding orange light.That person came close and stood in front of her. It was then that she had finally regained her vision and was able to see clearly. It was that driver.\u201cYou\u2019re awake, and still have the energy to escape. It seems like the dosage of the chloroform was insufficient!\u201d\u201cWho are you? Why did you kidnap me, and what is your motive?\u201dWen Xinya tried to be alert. Her eyes filled with coldness.Since after her rebirth, she was able to interpret and understand many things.Previously, when Wen Yuya and Xia Ruya tried to set her up at Zhou Tianyu\u2019s birthday party, they had wanted to find an opportunity to tarnish her reputation by making her lose her chastity. However, their mission had failed, and they suffered great humiliation themselves. How would the two of them, together with Ning Shuqian, let her off? Therefore, what happened today must be another evil plot by the three of them.\u201cWho am I? Don\u2019t you even know who I am?\u201dThat driver was provoked, and his originally gentle face turned evil-looking as stared at her with extreme hatred.Hatred! Since her rebirth, it was only three short months. She had not offended anyone since then. How could this man hate her?That driver grabbed her hair and pulled it downwards so that her face was facing up. She could now look at him clearly. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. But, you must have heard of Yang Guang Press Media! I\u2019m the Boss of Yang Guang Press Media, Fu Tianyang.\u201dWen Xinya thought for a while, then she remembered Yang Guang Press Media. It was a medium-sized company that was also involved in her previous scandalous reports incident. This company was one of those that were heavily fined by the court. He must have lost a lot of money in the compensation.Fu Tianyang fell into a state of insanity, and his eyes were filled with hatred. \u201cIt\u2019s all because of you, bitch. My media company had filed for bankruptcy due to huge debts that I was unable to pay. My wife eloped with another guy because of this. And my son met with a car accident. He fell into a coma because I did not have enough money for his operation. It\u2019s all because of you, bitch! You have ruined my family and destroyed my life\u2026\u201dThe last sentence kept repeating in his head. His tone was cold and heartless as if a huge bucket of ice was poured into his brain.Her scalp was hurting by his pulling her hair, her eyes contained coldness as she unemotionally replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve only yourself to blame.\u201d\u201cBitch!\u201d Wen Xinya\u2019s words further provoked Fu Tianyang. He threw her on the ground and kicked her continuously as if he had gone crazy.Wen Xinya rolled on the floor in extreme pain, but she bit her lips and endured without making a sound. \u201cYou tried to use unscrupulous methods to ruin a young teenage girl\u2019s reputation for your own beneficial gains. You\u2019re unethical and acted against your own conscience. Therefore, you should have imagined what kind of path it should have led you to. What I did was only to defend my own rights. Moreover, the sum of compensation was a verdict passed by the court. It has nothing to do with me.\u201d\u201cBitch, how can you say all these had nothing to do with you?\u201d Fu Tianyang pulled Wen Xinya up by her shirt and stared at her viciously, his eyes full of hatred and anger.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWen Xinya looked back at him straight in the eyes. Suddenly, she spoke in a soft tone and became gentler as if trying to redeem his soul. \u201cI have never thought of harming anyone. I understand and have empathy towards your situation. But, have you given it any serious thought about what you\u2019re doing right now? Kidnapping is a serious offense. Think about your bedridden son. He will have no hope left if he loses you.\u201dA sense of clarity and hesitation hit Fu Tianyang, but his brief rationale was soon consumed by vengeance once again. There were extreme coldness and darkness in his eyes, just like the sky outside of the window or the deep abyss of hell.\u201cI don\u2019t need your empathy, nor your pity. You\u2019re the one who ruined my life and caused me to land in such a mess\u2026 It\u2019s all because of you\u2026\u201dWen Xinya noticed the vengeance in his eyes and was lost in fear. However, she stayed strong and controlled her anxiety. \u201cIf you let me go, I will give you 10 million dollars. You can then use the money to pay for your son\u2019s surgery. I\u2019ve heard that patients who just fell into a coma for a short period can still be treated. You can also use the remaining amount of money to open another publishing company. When you\u2019re rich and wealthy, you can marry any woman you like. Young, pretty, homely or virtuous, it\u2019s your choice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019ve only written a few articles about you on my magazine, but yet you exterminated all of us. Letting you go is equivalent to setting a tiger free back to the mountains. Would you ever let me off and give me a huge sum of money? Do you take me as a fool?\u201d Fu Tianyang howled in his hoarse voice, sounding like a devil from hell.Wen Xinya gulped nervously. His sharp voice was piercing to her ears, causing a buzzing noise in her eardrums. \u201cI will do everything I said just now, I promise. I have no intention to deceive you. I can swear to heaven. If what I say isn\u2019t true, let me be struck by lightning and die a horrible death.\u201dFu Tianyang slapped Wen Xinya hard on her face. Her cheek instantly turned red with an imprint of his palm on it. \u201cI don\u2019t believe your lies. I only believe in myself.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s cheeks were burning hot. They were slowly burning away her hopes to get out of there. \u201cThen, what do you want to let me go?\u201d\u201cLet you go?\u201d There was doubt in Fu Tianyang\u2019s eyes. \u201cWhy should I let you go? I overcame great difficulties to bring you here. How can I let go you so easily?\u201d His expression turned vicious, showing his inner evil intent like poisonous gas.\u201cMy advice to you is to let me go as soon as possible. Otherwise, my family will lodge a police report when they find out that I\u2019m missing. By that time, it\u2019ll be too late for you even to regret.\u201d Wen Xinya felt that her last hope was crushed. She was all alone in an abyss of darkness, seeing no light at the end of the tunnel, and fear, despair, and insanity consumed her bit by bit.Fu Tianyang was mad. \u201cEven if I were to die, I\u2019ll drag you along to hell with me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re willing to sacrifice yourself just to get revenge. You\u2019re insane.\u201d Wen Xinya kept thinking about the pair of eyes that were filled with vengeance. Hopelessness possessed her.\u201cAre you afraid? Are you feeling hopeless now?\u201d Fu Tianyang was looking at her, enjoying the look of fear on her face. He displayed a weird smile, finally satisfied at getting his revenge.\u201cWhat do you want from me?\u201d Wen Xinya raised her head slowly and looked at him. Almost driven to the end of all hope, her eyes were empty and emotionless.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I shall not kill you. You are as young as my son. Both of you are underaged. How could I bear to kill you?\u201d Fu Tianyang spoke gently and tried to show empathy towards her. But his distorted tone and voice showed the evil intention behind his words.Wen Xinya instantly had goosebumps all over. He would not kill her\u2026 Could he be thinking of how to torment her in other ways so that her suffering would be worse than death?\u201cI will destroy you. Aren\u2019t you an elegant young lady? I shall let you live a life without dignity. I\u2019ll let you become a slave that will never be satisfied in your soul and body.\u201d He looked insane and was happy on the verdict he had passed on her. Adrenaline was pumped throughout his entire body. He felt excited; as if what he said had already become true.Wen Xinya\u2019s heart sank, and she felt suffocated in fear. Was it as what Murphy\u2019s Law had stated? \u2014 Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. All these incidents seemed to be destined to happen.Fu Tianyang suddenly walked up to a stone wall and retrieved a silver tray. He held the silver tray close to her and asked in a gentle tone, \u201cDo you know what\u2019s inside?\u201d His eyes were filled with evil intentions.\u201cDr\u2026 Drugs!\u201d She clenched her teeth while mumbling reluctantly. The vivid memories from her previous life swarmed back to her. That painful experience and the torment she went through due to her drug addiction. The memory was vivid and strong as if it just happened yesterday.\u201cClever!\u201d Her fearful expression made Fu Tianyang contented. He placed the tray right in front of her eyes.Every item on the tray was familiar to her. A little box with an exquisite design, a small white scoop, a lighter, an array of syringes of different sizes, and the needles that came with the syringes.Fu Tianyang slowly opened that little box. It contained some sparkling white powder. \u201cThis is heroin in its purest form. One take of it will bring you to paradise.\u201dWen Xinya\u2019s brain was buzzing with pain. She stared at the items on the tray and slowly fell into a daze!Fu Tianyang heated some of the white powder with the lighter unskillfully. Then he transferred the heated white powder into a syringe. \u201cOnce you\u2019re injected with this, your body will start to rot slowly, and you will become a living corpse without a soul. You will only crave for more of this and nothing else.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201d Fu Tianyang laughed hard as if he had just heard a funny joke. His laughter was vicious and evil, sending chills down her spine.\u201cArgh! You\u2019re crazy!\u201d Wen Xinya cursed in fear. Pupils contracting uncontrollably, the terror and despair swallowed her heart. She was panting, and her heart was pumping fast.\u201cNo. Injecting heroin might not guarantee an addiction. How about injecting some liquid drugs directly into your body?\u201d Fu Tianyang placed the syringe on the silver tray and held up another syringe filled with some liquid drug. \u201cLet me inject this filthy liquid into your bloodstream directly. That will be so much more fun.\u201d\u201cNo. No\u2026\u201d Wen Xinya muttered. Her vision became blurred and was filled with hopelessness. She instantly turned into a broken doll without a soul!Fu Tianyang held up the syringe in his hands and looked closely. \u201cNo. This syringe is too small. It might also not guarantee your addiction to drugs with such a small quantity.\u201d He then switched to the biggest syringe he could find on the tray and held it up. The silver needle reflected a blinding ray of light under the orange lighting.Wen Xinya\u2019s breath became heavier!\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019m skilled at it. I will minimize your pain.

She seemed to have no way to disperse the unlimited amount of energy that just entered into her body.This feeling was indescribably amazing!She subconsciously fell into an abyss!

Suddenly, a Range Rover came sliding down the slope with its blinding headlights shining directly into the stone house.Fu Tianyang subconsciously looked out of the door, but all he could see was the glaring headlight. He could hardly open his eyes.Screech\u2026The car came to a sudden halt, and the noise caused by the brakes was so deafening it ripped through the silence of the night.Then, another car followed behind. The headlights from the cars brightened the surroundings like broad daylight.Fu Tianyang looked towards the direction of the cars, squinting his eyes against the glaring lights. A great sense of fear suddenly overcame him, causing the syringe to fall from his hand.Si Yiyan was the first to get out of the car, slamming the door close with great strength.In the darkness of the night, he looked even colder than before. Gu Yuehan followed closely behind, his back view as sturdy as before. His footsteps were elegant as ever as he walked with heavy steps as if his feet weighed a thousand pounds. Each step he took\u2026 represented the sharpness of a sword\u2019s blade. Each step he took\u2026 represented the wolve\u2019s determination to kill. Each step he took\u2026 represented the cruelty of massacre. And each step he took\u2026 represented the bloodiness of a fierce battle.Fu Tianyang watched as he approached slowly. Step by step, he could feel the intention to kill. His legs turned wobbly and fell to the ground.Bypassing him, Si Yiyan walked slowly into the stone house and saw a barely conscious Wen Xinya curled up on the ground. His vision then turned towards the syringes, lighter, and white powder on the ground. His pair of eyes turned cold and vicious with rage. He could no longer control his anger.\u201cXinya!\u201d He crouched down and hugged her with all his might. He held her tightly to his chest as if he would crush her.It was so tight that Wen Xinya felt difficulty in breathing. She could feel his great strength through his big hands on her waist.She slowly raised her head, her eyes filled with bewilderment as she looked at her surroundings. Suddenly, she grinned like a child and said, \u201cHee hee, you guys look weird. You look all the same. One, two, three\u2026 So many of you!\u201dSi Yiyan\u2019s remaining dash of hope instantly disappeared. He held her face close to him and said, \u201cLook at me, I\u2019m Si Yiyan, the one and only Si Yiyan.\u201dWen Xinya shook her head. Her eyebrows were interlocked closely, looking innocent as a child. \u201cDon\u2019t shake your head, you\u2019re making me dizzy\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t shake my head. Take a good look at me, okay?\u201d Si Yiyan looked at her with dismay.Wen Xinya looked at him obediently. She then reached out her hands to hold his face, fixing it in front of her eyes and smiled proudly. \u201cHaha, I caught you so that you cannot shake anymore and will not cause me dizziness!\u201dHer crisp, tender voice and innocent expression devoured his sanity bit by bit, like a mulberry leave being consumed by the silkworm one bite at a time. He was like a pile of fuelwood; once lighted, he would burn and destroy everything\u2026Wen Xinya pushed him away and staggeringly stood up.

She was like a mental patient howling uncontrollably. \u201cXia Ruya, in what way am I inferior to you? No matter how much effort I put in, I can never seem to be on par with you.

Although he was watching from afar, Xu Zhenyu could feel the warmth and care the man had for her. As he his chest tightened and a pang of pain hit his heart., tears cascaded down his cheeks uncontrollably from the pain as if something was threatening to claw out of his heart.He might have missed her by just 5 minutes, but it resulted in what felt like an eternal loss to him.He was the one who thought of the possibility that Xinya was here first. However, he could only search aimlessly at the mountain since the place was completely new to him. Every second that passed by was torturous to him, slowly driving him mad. He called every number in his phone helplessly, begging for the hope that someone would know the specific location of this stone house.When the blinding headlights lit up the mountain forest, he followed it only to be caught by a group of men in black uniform, and was forced to watch her be carried into a car in the arms of someone else!\u201cWen Xinya!\u201d He shouted towards her direction as he put up a struggle, wanting to check if she was okay.\u201cAnswer me honestly.\u201d A man in black ordered as he grabbed his arm.\u201cLet me go!\u201d Xu Zhenyu turned his body out of the blue, sending a kick flying towards him.Out of his expectations, the man was a strong fighter. In the blink of an eye, he strongly kicked Xu Zhenyu\u2019s leg.Xu Zhenyu keeled over in pain after receiving the hit. He had always taken pride in his ability to fight, yet he was unable to fight back. This was a massive blow to him.\u201cWen Xinya!\u201d Xu Zhenyu crawled weakly on the ground, the dirt staining him. This was the first time ever that he felt such hatred towards himself for being weak.\u201cWho the hell are you people? Where are you taking Wen Xinya? I\u2019m her friend, can\u2019t you let me check on her?\u201d Xu Zhenyu put down his pride and asked weakly.\u201cSave your questions. We are here to save your friend, we will not do anything to harm her.\u201d The man in black answered him expressionlessly.Xu Zhenyu angrily replied, \u201cHow do I know that you guys are not cheating me? Let me see her!\u201dThe man in black ignored him.In a flash, Xu Zhenyu grabbed a handful of dirt and threw it at the man in black. The man backed away a few steps instinctively, and Xu Zhenyu took the chance to get up and chase after the car in front.\u201cQuick! Stop him!\u201d The man in black commanded the others as he ran after him hurriedly.A person\u2019s potential is limitless. Xu Zhenyu was stopped by a few men in black.

Within moments, he saw Xu Zhenyu rushing over like a bull.He frowned slightly, and his fingers gently slid across the red diamond on Wen Xinya\u2019s left ear. A wave of unreadable emotions flashed across his face.Xu Zhenyu rushed over to the car in a short while and knocked on the door relentlessly. \u201cWen Xinya! Wen Xinya! Are you okay? Answer me\u2026\u201dSi Yiyan slowly rolled down the window. His eyes narrowed into a smile and he beamed. \u201cXu Zhenyu!\u201dXu Zhenyu was paralyzed with shock. The bright light in the car lit up his face, and the darkness from outside cast a shadow on the contours of his face, making him look dark and somber. His beauty was breathtaking yet had a certain coldness to it that chilled the heart. His beautiful eyebrows were striking, and his lips were slightly thin but sharp. Although he was watching Xu Zhenyu quietly, he carried an air of nobility as if he stood above the world.Suddenly, Xu Zhenyu felt vulnerable and inferior. \u201cWho are you? Why are you taking Wen Xinya? I\u2019m her friend, leave her to me!\u201dXu Chenyu\u2019s eyes fell on Wen Xinya who was lying on the man\u2019s knees. Her clothes were fully intact, and there were not many signs of struggle on her body. The only thing was that her whole face was hidden in the shadows and could not be seen clearly. Seeing that she seemed to be fine, he heaved a sigh of relief.\u201cI\u2019m a student of Old Mr. Mo. I\u2019ve lived in the Mo house previously, and even taught Xinya calligraphy for a while.\u201d Si Yiyan himself was unsure as to why he was explicitly introducing himself. It was as if he had the childish mentality to flaunt his relationship with Xinya to him.He had investigated Xu Zhenyu\u2019s background. Xu Zhenyu and Wen Xinya only met after he first knew Wen Xinya, yet Xu Zhenyu held a higher position in her heart as compared to him. Every time she felt lost or was deep in thought, she would subconsciously stroke the red diamond on her left ear.Xu Zhenyu was the first person to make him feel threatened. However, it was not because of Xu Zhenyu\u2019s identity, but rather the complicated feelings Wen Xinya had towards him.Xu Zhenyu thought for a while. Wen Xinya had never mentioned this person to him before. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Old Mr. Mo would have a student like you. Furthermore, Wen Xinya never once mentioned you to me.\u201dAlthough the man seemed to have a strong character and cold demeanor, he was obviously a man with a mysterious background. Why would a great scholar such as Old Mr. Mo take in a student like him?Si Yiyan could not be bothered. Wanting to send Xinya to the hospital as soon as possible, he commanded. \u201cStart the car, Gu Yuehan!\u201dXu Zhenyu stiffened, and quickly said, \u201cDon\u2019t. How is Wen Xinya? I want to see her.\u201d\u201cShe is fine, she only fainted due to shock. I\u2019m going to send her to the hospital now. Why don\u2019t you just follow the car and come with us!\u201d Si Yiyan\u2019s voice carried clear rejection towards Xu Zhenyu, and he slowly rolled up the car window.Suddenly, Xu Zhenyu intersected the rising glass window with his hand but was unable to stop it from moving. The car window automatically rolled down right before his hand was sandwiched between the window and the car top. \u201cI want to see her!\u201dSi Yiyan raised his eyebrows and looked at him with contempt. His beautiful, slender hands reached out the window and grabbed his wrist. With a squeeze, Xu Zhenyu\u2019s wrist went numb and released his hold on the window.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGu Yuehan started the car and drove away within moments.The car flew past him, leaving a trail of dust that covered him from head to toe. Xu Zhenyu gritted his teeth.They must have done it on purpose.He kicked a nearby tree in rage and shouted: \u201cBastard!\u201dWatching the car driving further and further away, Xu Zhenyu quickly ran to his own car, intending to follow them to the hospital.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - Wen Xinya Met Her DemisePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 100: Wen Xinya Met Her DemiseAtlas StudiosThe dim light shone on the pale person lying on the bed, drenched in sweat, making her look especially frail. Her eyebrows were furrowed together, clear signs of her having a nightmare.Wen Yuya was caught underneath a man, his full weight crushing her to the point where she could not breathe, and the blood on her body had dried up. She relentlessly struggled, cried, screamed for help and begged, but the only thing she got was being plundered cruelly.\u201cNo, help\u2026 Save me Ruya\u2026 Mom it hurts\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya\u2019s high pitched voice pierced the room as her hands tightened around the blanket.\u201cLet me off\u2026 Don\u2019t do this to me, I beg you\u2026 Please\u2026 Ugh\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya\u2019s hands flew in the air as if she were trying to wave the nightmare away.Suddenly, the face of the man began to contort bit by bit, and eventually became Wen Xinya\u2019s face. Wen Xinya looked at her, her eyes glinting with mockery. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty like jade, but no matter how pretty a jade is, it\u2019s nothing but a toy\u2026 a toy\u2026\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 I\u2019m not a toy, I\u2019m not\u2026\u201d Wen Yuya\u2019s shrill cry could pierce one\u2019s eardrums!\u201cYou are, you are\u2026\u201d The evil voice taunted her continuously by her ears. Wen Xinya\u2019s face began to twist and change. She grew two horns, her black eyes became blood red, and her arms turned into tentacles. They circled around Wen Yuya\u2019s neck and strangled her, suffocating her.\u201cDemon\u2026 You\u2019re a demon\u2026\u201d She screamed, struggled, and cried incessantly. Her entire body trembled in pain and despair as if she were one second away from hell.\u201cYuya, wake up! You\u2019re having a nightmare! Wake up!\u201d Ning Shuqian shook her shoulders and slapped her cheeks, trying to wake her up.Ever since the incident at Zhou Tianyu\u2019s birthday dinner, Yuya was often caught up in nightmares. When Ning Shuqian got up to get some water, she walked past Yuya\u2019s room and heard her cries. Immediately, she knew that she was having a nightmare.\u201cMom, save me!\u201d Wen Yuya hoarsely said while crying and suddenly sat up from her bed. Her pupils contracted rapidly, her heart was beating violently, her breathing was ragged and heavy, and her forehead was drenched with cold sweat.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared, Yuya. Your mom is right here by your side, it\u2019s alright. That was just a bad dream.\u201d Ning Shuqian embraced her cold, wet body.Her warm embrace washed away Wen Yuya\u2019s nightmare. \u201cMom, I dreamed that Wen Xinya became a demon. She wanted to kill me. She even said that I was pretty like jade, but no matter how pretty I was, I\u2019m just a toy.\u201dNing Shuqian stroked her hair gently and said, \u201cThat was just a dream. You\u2019re a mistress of the Wen Family, how can you be a toy? I brought you up painstakingly for you to bathe in prosperity.\u201d\u201cMom, until when must we tolerate this? If we don\u2019t repay her evil deed, I\u2019ll forever be haunted by these nightmares.\u201d Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes glowed with malice, and her face twisted with anger.Ning Shuqian wiped the sweat on her face and replied, \u201cI promised to take revenge for you. Don\u2019t worry. After tonight, Wen Xinya will meet her demise.\u201dOld Wen rushing out just now must mean that they had received the news of Wen Xinya\u2019s disappearance. However, it was too late\u2026 everything was over. Wen Xinya was destined to be abandoned.Wen Yuya\u2019s eye widened. \u201cMom, could it be that you\u2019ve done something already?\u201dNing Shuqian whispered softly into her ears.Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes lit up with joy. \u201cMom, is that true?\u201dNing Shuqian watched as the color returned to her petite face. She looked bright and youthful now, without a single trace of solemnity. \u201cThere\u2019s no way your mom would lie to you. Do you remember seeing your grandpa rush out of the house after receiving a phone call? Even now, he\u2019s not back home yet.\u201dWen Yuya\u2019s eyes were filled with hatred. \u201cWen Xinya setting me up like that\u2026 we are already being merciful. She deserved to be kidnapped by a bunch of gangsters and have her explicit sex tapes taken. This will utterly destroy her.\u201d\u201cMom will definitely fulfill your wish. However, Wen Xinya is the only blood heir to the Wen Family. Your grandpa views her highly, even going through so much effort to find her. If we raise any suspicions, your grandpa will not let us off easy. For us to succeed, we have to make the Wen Family abandon her first. That way, Wen Xinya will have to submit to us, and your grandpa will not even care about her.\u201d Thinking of Wen Xinya\u2019s face which closely resembled Mo Yunyao\u2019s, Ning Shuqian\u2019s eyes burned with hatred.Wen Yuya frowned and asked, \u201cWhat if Wen Xinya managed to quit the drug addiction?\u201dNing Shuqian laughed. \u201cSo what if she manages to quit? The words \u201cdoing drugs\u201d are enough to stain her life. Do you think your grandpa would pass the Wen Corporation to a successor who has done drugs before?\u201dWen Yuya shook her head. \u201cOf course not. Doing drugs is the worst scandal in the social circle. There are so many people within the circle, exposing her would either mean that she gets sent overseas or gets abandoned by the family.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Furthermore, the drug administered to Wen Xinya was the newest pure cocaine and liquid drug. Just a tiny dose would hook anyone for life.\u201d Drugs were the scariest thing in this world, ruining the lives of many.Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes darkened as if they were brewing the most deadly drug in the entire world. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see Wen Xinya\u2019s pathetic state after getting tortured by the drugs and turning into a walking corpse.\u201dNing Shuqian laughed hysterically. \u201cYuya, the drugs will slowly absorb her life, then take away her youth and beauty. She will be a 15-year-old girl clinging on to life with a 60-year-old body, slowly losing her dignity, betraying her body, her character crumbling away\u2026 She would be better off dead.\u201dHearing her words, Wen Yuya\u2019s eyes glowed with even more malicious intent.Just then, Ning Shuqian\u2019s phone rang. After seeing the blank number, she hesitated before answering. \u201cI thought we agreed not to contact each other?\u201dA cold voice replied through the phone, \u201cWen Xinya was saved by someone.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat, she was saved? By who?\u201d Ning Shuqian\u2019s head began to spin, not believing what she heard. It was as if the sky had collapsed on her.\u201cThe other party has very strong backing. I have to go into hiding for now. You be careful too, don\u2019t agitate Wen Xinya anytime soon. However\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t even do such a small thing right. How dare you make me work with you\u2026\u201d Without waiting for him to finish, Ning Shuqian roared into the phone with rage. She was so angry she had lost all her senses.\u201cRest assured, Wen Xinya met her demise.\u201d With that, the line cut off!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
