Yet at the same time, there are also other meanings to the title. I have searched for many other words, but only the word \u201cPursuit\u201d was the one that was the closest in encompassing the essence of the story in my heart.What does \u201cTruth\u201d mean then? It is written with the word \u9b54 (Mo), meaning devil. I believe all of you believe that devil is simply a villain, a person who does all sorts of bad things. Someone who would soil their hands for the sake of success, even practicing dark arts like a demon lord. In other words, I am referring to the Mo which is a devil or demon.It is just like the Wuxia stories we have read before, where they will train with despicable ways such as eating dried human placenta or by forsaking their own humanity.But is this devil really the Mo I want to create?I once told a friend of mine that I wanted to create the Devil, the true Devil. Not a villain or a demon lord that will be lost in time and be viewed as crass and evil by future generations, but the Devil! One that will walk on the path and the truth he resolutely believes, even going against the natural order of the universe!It is a deep word which reveals the life and spirit of a character.What I want to write is a story where there was no Devil in the world before him, and neither will there be any other true Devil after him!What I want to create is a theme different from Renegade Immortal, yet with a much more touching plot!I want to write a story where Su Ming stands on the pinnacle of the mountains looking over the world and muttering in a voice burdened by his experiences and grief, murmuring about things no one has ever cared about.\u201cIf the world calls me a devil, then so be it. Henceforth, I, Su Ming, shall become the Devil!\u201d (the first devil is left intentionally in small letters.)You will see the story I wish to write in two hours\u2026Translator\u2019s NotesWhen I was translating, I wasn\u2019t convinced by the translated argument if I used Devil instead of Mo. There was something off about it. That\u2019s why I chose to ask a third party, someone who is not the author and neither the reader, and what you see now is the paraphrased version of the conversation between me and a Master holder in translation for Chinese-English, who happens to be a close friend of mine, and I will paraphrase the outcome of our conversation. Also, the author and I reached an agreement to use Devil for Mo for consistency in ISSTH.\u201cUsing Mo isn\u2019t wrong, because if the title is Pursuit of the Truth and I see the word Devil suddenly being used in the preface, I\u2019ll feel cheated, and you\u2019re right, Devil is commonly used to describe evil. From what I can see, that isn\u2019t what you want in the preface, but neither is there any good English equivalent for the word, since we\u2019re losing the original meaning of the word Mo if we use Devil. Since another translator has translated this to Devil, you\u2019d best keep to it, but what you need to do next is to associate Truth to Devil. Meaning the truth the main character is looking for is associated to Devil, perhaps it is referring to his character, but perhaps it is the path he chooses to take, which we both believe is the case. And if that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll need to add a little more explanations to the preface itself. Things that only Chinese readers will understand if they read the source language because we know the many meanings of Mo, but not English readers, because to them Mo is only the devil.\u201dDid I manage to convey the meaning though?Prologue\u201cKala\u2026\u201d\u201cKala\u2026 Kala\u2026\u201dNo one could not tell what that sound was. It was as if it was a sound that could penetrate the body and pierce through the soul, forcing the body to shiver in the cold caused by the blizzard that night.The cold northern wind whistled through and the snow danced with the wind, causing the line separating heaven and earth to shatter into a million pieces, scattering on earth and causing heaven and earth to become one. Looking from afar, it was as if the world was a white and desolate place.It was not midnight, just twilight, but the sky was already as dark as night. It brought about a heavy feeling as if it was pressing on your chest, cutting off your breath. On that white plain, a gigantic silhouette could be seen. It was the silhouette of a huge city like a huge beast prowling in the plains.At the centre of the city was a tall altar in the shape of a tower. It was built in the shape of a heptagon, completely black, and was so tall it reached the clouds. It remained silent and unmoving even in the midst of the blizzard. When the wind blew past the altar, that creaking sound could be heard clearly amongst the moans of the wind even when the sounds were brought far away into the distance. The sounds carried about the wildness of the ancients, creating a unique harmony.\u201cIs there still hope\u2026 Is there?\u201dHoarse mumbles could be heard from the altar, as if it was one with the wind, and it was barely distinguishable.\u201cIf there\u2019s still hope, then where is it? If there is no hope then why do you let me see it?!\u201d As if driven mad, the owner of voice roared towards heaven as if he was pouring out his heart and soul into the scream.Standing underneath the altar were countless people wearing clothes made of straw. They stood silently, and if you cast your gaze further, you would see that the number of people amounted to tens of thousands. Men and women gathered densely around the altar. They may be unmoving, but there was a sort of fanaticism that could be felt among them, as if they would sacrifice everything should the person on the altar just speak.The blizzard became heavier.\u201cIf you\u2019ve let me see it then there must be hope, but where is it?!\u201d There was a hint of anguish and sorrow in the hoarse voice on the altar, and the voice lingered for a long time.\u201cToday is the day the Emperor returns, the day the gates to the Three Lands open, the day the blizzard arrives, and the day all was created. I will predict the Berserker Day once again!\u201d The voice grew louder and with some unknown skill, the colors of the clouds in the sky changed. The countless snowflakes stopped in midair, and immediately went back the way they came. Exclamations from all around gathered in one place, making heaven and earth rumble.There was no longer any snow falling from the sky. All the snow gathered to form a gigantic dragon. The dragon immediately lifted its head and let out a piercing roar the moment it was formed. Those who heard it felt their hearts shaking, as if the sound itself could tear them apart.The snow dragon was quickly covered by its own blood, turning it into a bloody dragon. It let out a mournful cry and flew towards the heavens like a shooting star as if it wanted to tear through the sky and create hope.It reached the endless boundaries quickly and amidst its own roars, the dragon crashed into an invisible and shapeless barrier. Heaven and earth shook, and the sounds scattered everywhere. The blood dragon cried out once again and its body fell apart before their eyes.At the very moment it almost shattered completely, the tens of thousands of people standing in silence under the altar casted hand seals and bit down their tongues, spitting mouthfuls of fresh blood. As if guided by some sort of energy, the blood darted forth like a sea of blood towards the crumbling blood dragon to combine with it, allowing the blood dragon to recover slightly from its broken state, soaring once again into the horizon.All of them watched as the blood dragon soared higher but at that very moment, the blood dragon shuddered and let out a roar that travelled through tens of thousands of miles, no longer able to stop its body from falling apart. It turned into countless bloody snowflakes and fell downwards, creating a red realm on the plains.Yet at the very moment the blood dragon fell apart, it spoke with a sound completely different from its roars.\u201cDeath\u2026\u201d\u201cDeath\u2026\u201dOn the top of the altar was an old man clad in a purple robe sitting cross-legged at the centre. The old man\u2019s face was covered in wrinkles and brown spots. Mumbling, he opened his eyes but his gaze held no light, a clear sign that he was blind.Before him was a complete spine emitting an eerie white glow. In his right hand was a stone slab, which he held on top of the thirteenth vertebrae.With his blank gaze, he looked silently towards heaven. After a long while, he let out a long sigh.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTell the King of Yu\u2026 I\u2019ve tried my best\u2026\u201dWhile he spoke, his right hand moved once again on top of the odd spine. He rubbed at the animal spine with the stone slab, creating clicking sounds that travelled through a distance. He looked desolate and along with the sounds, one could also find a sorrowful loneliness and weakness from him.\u201cAs the Elder of the Great Yu Dynasty, you cannot see the world that I see\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 cannot see\u2026\u201d\u201cHope\u2026\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lush, green mountains.These mountains formed a chain that seemed to span endlessly across earth, resembling the back of a dragon lying down. The mountain range covered the vast plains. There were numerous types of plants in the mountains and within them, even more sounds of birds as well as beasts.There were five tall protrusions which formed five mountaintops. They looked like a human\u2019s hand raised with the fingers pointed skyward, as if wanting to catch the sky. In the middle of one of the peaks was a big hollowed-out rock and a young man was hiding in the shade that it provided. By his side was a woven basket filled with medicinal herbs which surrounded the area with a pleasant and therapeutic scent.The young man had a handsome face but he was on the leaner side so, it made him look frail at first glance. He wore a shirt made of beast skin and around his neck he wore a white fang in the shape of a crescent moon. His messy hair was held together by a string of straw.He sat there with a scroll made from dozens of beast skins in his hands. He read it with fervor and shook his head in disagreement at times.\u201cSince the creation of the world and of man, the Berserker Tribe has existed and it still exists to this date\u2026The people who hold the Berserker\u2019s Power are known as Berserkers. They can fly in the skies, move mountains and turn the tides in the sea\u2026Those who have the Berserker Mark can read the future and obtain the power of the sun, moon, and stars\u2026\u201d As the young man read this, he sighed.\u201cYet without the Berserker Body, it is impossible to become a practitioner of Berserker Arts\u2026 Berserker\u2026 Berserker\u2026 Su Ming, it is your fate that you can only pick herbs and become a common healer in the tribe. Becoming a Berserker who practices the Ways of the Berserker is an impossible dream.\u201d The young man mocked himself and put down the scroll. He then gazed into the distance and allowed his mind to wander.He had read the scroll countless of times. He could not memorize the contents backwards but he still knew it like the back of his hand.\u201cThe sky is round and the earth is flat as though it had no end, no boundaries\u2026\u201d As Su Ming read out the text in soft murmurs, he began imagining the world depicted in the scroll. Gradually, the sky darkened, and dark clouds started to form in the sky.The surrounding wind also made it more humid. As it blew past the trees and leaves, it created a rustling sound.When Su Ming saw the dark clouds in the sky, he was momentarily stunned.\u201cElder\u2019s predictions are coming true! The Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva can truly be found today!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes grew bright and he stood up quickly, gathering the scroll into his bosom. He grabbed the basket with his left hand and slung it on his back. Then, with a lithe movement he grabbed onto a rope and climbed towards the top of the mountain.The young man\u2019s frail body charged forth explosively with a tenacious force. He moved just like an ape. With just a few jumps, he already managed to cover dozens of feet in distance.The dark clouds in the skies arrived like waves and roared as they came. It was like the wrath of the gods had been brought down upon the mountain range. The dark clouds covered the skies completely as though they connected the heavens and the earth. They covered the land in darkness and were approaching the mountain range quickly.Su Ming climbed even faster and just as the dark clouds spread out over the mountains, he reached a place a few dozen feet away from the mountaintop. An oddly shaped rock was there however, it seemed like it was naturally formed. The center of the rock was hollow and there were numerous holes about the size of fists on its surface. It was as if the King of Pythons had entrenched itself in the mountain range.Underneath the mysterious rock was a stone shaped like a fang. The rock was terrifying to look at. It was odd and because it was a mountain protrusion, it looked like it hung in the air. It was very difficult to climb onto the rock, unless one could fly.Su Ming took hold of the rope in his left hand and with his right hand he took out a small bottle from the basket. He held it between his teeth and slowly nudged forward in the opposite direction of the mysterious rock. He moved until the rope he held onto was so taut that it inclined towards his direction. He then grabbed onto the walls of the mountain and pressed his body against it. He lifted his head skyward and looked at the dark clouds in the sky. His eyes shone and his body was still.After some time, the clouds covered the sky entirely and thunder roared. The sound was so great, he thought he might have gone deaf. The wind started blowing mercilessly, as if it was trying to throw the mountain range off the ground. Su Ming\u2019s knuckle had already turned white from holding onto the mountain in the typhoon but, he remained unmoving. Strength shone from his eyes as he continued looking at the sky.The typhoon grew even stronger and the plants in the mountain range were helplessly slapped around. The sound of the wind was akin to the roars of a huge beast. It made the numerous broken branches and dead leaves fly, causing the entire place to be filled with branches and leaves dancing madly in the air.Some bigger branches and even small beasts were lifted by the typhoon and subsequently tossed away. Their cries of agony were silenced by the sound of the wind.Su Ming was not going to persist much further in the typhoon. The sky was completely covered by dark clouds. With the sounds of thunder, huge droplets of rain poured down from the sky. At that moment, it was as if the world was covered by a gigantic curtain of water.The rain persisted and grew heavier by the minute, but Su Ming held onto the drenched rope tightly and kept his body firmly against the wall of the mountain. He did nothing to avoid being drenched by the rain and remained still as ever. His eyes were fixed on the mysterious rock above the fang-shaped stone.An unknown amount of time passed and the rain continued growing heavier. The world was surrounded by rain and fog. Under the rain\u2019s cleansing, the fang-shaped rock Su Ming was staring at began secreting a black liquid.The black liquid merged with the rainwater and formed a stream that flowed downwards.When Su Ming saw this, his eyes were filled with excitement yet he remained stationary until the secretion of the black liquid gradually slowed down and finally turned into an impressive golden color. Su Ming narrowed his eyes and with no hesitation, he released his grip on the mountain wall. As he slid down, he took out the bottle in his mouth with his right hand.The rope in his left hand was already positioned diagonally to begin with. When he let go of the mountain wall, his entire body swung with the force of the rope at a frightening speed towards the fang-shaped rock.Su Ming arrived next to the seemingly floating fang-shaped rock with the help of the rope just as the next blast of thunder crackled over his head. This was due to the rope\u2019s great level of inclination and the accuracy of his position. With his left hand, he held onto the rope and with his right he held the bottle. He quickly placed the bottle underneath the fang-shaped rock as he approached it. In the brief moment that the rope reached the peak of its swing and began its journey back, he managed to fill up half the bottle with the golden liquid.However at that very moment, he heard a piercing cry. Black centipedes about the size of four or five arms crawled out from the many holes on the mysterious rock, pouncing ferociously onto the still dangling Su Ming.Su Ming was not even the least bit surprised. The moment the centipedes appeared, he let go of his hold on the rope and allowed his body to fall at a terrifying speed, avoiding the centipedes\u2019 attack.\u201cXiao Hong!\u201d Su Ming was falling in midair quickly and his body stiffened as he felt the typhoon cutting fiercely into his body like sharp blades. Even if he avoided the centipedes, he would still turn into mincemeat if he fell on the ground.But he was not afraid. A red shadow rushed forward from the cliff by the side towards Su Ming\u2019s falling body on a length of rope. It grabbed onto Su Ming once it reached him. The red shadow was a red, small monkey. It was grinning and its eyes were filled with vigor.The man and his monkey fell on a cliff along with the rope. It was the very cliff where Su Ming was reading just moments ago. Su Ming\u2019s eyes were finally filled with nervousness and he immediately put away the small bottle he was holding in his hands.\u201cXiao Hong, we have to run! I took too much Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva this time! Huh, what\u2019s that in your hand?\u201d As Su Ming spoke, he saw a small piece of black stone in the monkey\u2019s paws.The monkey\u2019s gaze immediately grew sharp and it hid its paws behind its back, hissing at Su Ming. Su Ming did not bother and immediately walked a few steps forward before jumping and grabbing onto a length of rope. He fell downwards fast with the monkey.Behind them, screeching sounds filled the skies and the black centipedes gave chase as they sped down the walls of the mountain. They were like numerous black lines falling down, relentlessly chasing the duo.The little red monkey hissed at Su Ming and it moved about constantly on his body. Occasionally, it would turn back to look at the centipedes giving chase, its gaze filled with terror and anger.\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s the first time we\u2019re running away. Those dark dragons won\u2019t go down the mountain anyway so, stop pretending. Same rules, I\u2019ll give you half of the Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva.\u201d Although Su Ming was fleeing at impressive speeds, his tone was lazy. Once he spoke, the monkey immediately smiled making it obvious it was just pretending.The man and the monkey were familiar with the mountain range. For some unknown reason, the centipedes would not travel into certain places but would rather go around them. Hence, while Su Ming and his monkey were not as quick as the centipedes, they would choose to jump downwards at times and grab onto a rope. After doing so a few times, they managed to escape from the top of the mountain and they disappeared into the forest.As expected, the centipedes did not venture out of the mountains. After a few cries of rage, they returned to the top of the mountain begrudgingly.The dark clouds left as quickly as they came. After a few hours, the mountain range returned to normal as the dark clouds left to venture further down.Su Ming and the monkey made their way towards the borders of the forest. By then, it was already night time. There were dim balls of fire in the distance, all belonging to Su Ming\u2019s tribe.\u201cI already gave you your share, you still want more?\u201d Su Ming was still entirely drenched as he came out of the forest but he did not mind. Instead, he smiled faintly as he watched the monkey following him with hopeful eyes.This monkey was very intelligent. He found it by pure accident three years ago when he ventured into the mountains. They even had a bit of a scuffle but in the end, they became best friends.The monkey blinked and scratched its face, revealing the tiniest bit of hesitation. But, it quickly handed Su Ming the black piece of debris he held onto earlier and let out a few screeches, conveying his intention to trade the debris with the Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll let you have some more, but I don\u2019t want that stupid rock. You can keep it.\u201d Su Ming smiled and took out the small bottle from the basket, handing it to the monkey.The monkey quickly took it and drank a mouthful. Its face showed total bliss. The monkey even swayed a little and let out a burp. It threw the black piece of debris along with the small bottle back to Su Ming and wobbled back into the forest.Su Ming looked at the small, half empty bottle and smiled faintly. Putting it back into the basket, he then turned his attention towards the black piece of debris.Translator\u2019s Note:Allow me to make some explanations.Why was the title of the novel changed?After some discussion with the author, it was decided that Beseech the Devil did not encapsulate the essence of the novel. That was why we decided to change the name of the novel to the Pursuit of the Truth, which was provided and approved by the author himself.Why did I opt to use the word Berserker for \u86ee?\u86ee\u2019s closest translation would be barbarian or savage, however, these words do not fully encapsulate the meaning of the idea behind the characters using\u86ee. The main reason is because these people are highly civilized, and the words do not do them justice.Why didn\u2019t I just retain the pinyin for the word then, which is Man? That\u2019s because I wanted to give all of you a word that can give you the impact of the power of the practicing \u86ee immediately and make you go \u201cHey, that\u2019s dope\u201d, not gradually associating the power of\u86eeto a new word \u2013 Man.Hence, I chose the word Berserker, because they were a tribe of powerful Berserkers who fought ferociously. It was also explained to me by the author that \u86ee was used to refer to a tribe in China, and also refers to mighty power. Hence I decided to use the word Berserker, because they were a tribe of people who were powerful, who in reality fought in a trance like state, and are civilized (somewhat), which I believed encapsulated the meaning of the word.On another note, this is in regards to many of the other names in the novel.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI am aware that there has been a translation of Beseech the Devil from chapter 1 to chapter 120. I could have just taken the names used in PiggyBottle\u2019s translated work, yet more than anything, I am terrified of being accused of piracy. That was why I avoided reading PiggyBottle\u2019s work so that I would not end up stealing other people\u2019s hard work.I am sure that some of you read PiggyBottle\u2019s work before and will compare this with Piggy\u2019s. I am also sure that many of you will feel offended because I might have changed a lot of things. I am saying might because I still have not touched what Piggy translated because, as I said before, I do not want to steal what belongs to Piggy\u2019s, whether consciously or unconsciously.All I can say is, I am sorry, and please bear with me.One more thing, it\u2019s the meaning of the name for the first arc.\u201cIf only human lives were like an initial meeting\u201d means that \u201cif only human lives were as beautiful as the first moments you meet someone you like.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Besides some naturally formed patterns forming the uneven surface, there was a small hole on the stone that made it look like an accessory.Other than that, there was nothing else which looked out of place. In fact, it looked like any normal stone.The only thing out of ordinary was the warmth it emitted when Su Ming held it. The warmth seemed to seep into his body and it was a very comfortable feeling.\u201cHmm?\u201d Su Ming looked closely at it. Yet even after he scrutinized the entire thing, he still could not find anything else odd about it.\u201cI remember the elder saying that this was once the Land of the Fire Berserker Tribe. If that\u2019s the case, then this thing might have some powers of fire. That\u2019s why it can keep people warm. Not bad.\u201d Su Ming took off the crescent fang on his neck and replaced it with the stone before wearing the necklace once again, letting it hang over the stone. When the stone touched his chest, he felt its warmth increase.\u201cLet\u2019s go home!\u201d The young man then ran quickly towards the place with the balls of light. He did not notice it, but at that time, the stone hanging off his chest gave out a dim glow before disappearing.As Su Ming neared his destination, the dim balls of light grew brighter before his eyes, and he saw a settlement surrounded by a wall made from giant wood.The settlement was not big. It could only hold about a few hundred people in it, but in Su Ming\u2019s eyes, it was a place that made him feel at home. He could faintly hear cheerful sounds from within as he approached the settlement. From the cracks in the giant wooden wall, he could see a bonfire in the middle of the tribe. There were many tribesmen gathered around it and some of the women from the tribe were dancing around the bonfire.The gate to the tribe was also built with giant wood. Usually, when it was open, it would be held up with several pieces of rope. Now, it was closed and there were some burly men standing on top wearing clothes made from beast skin. Their skin was rough and there were white bone necklaces hanging from their necks. They were terrifying to look at. They also wore earrings made of bone, and their overall appearance made them look intimidating as they surveyed the area. When they saw Su Ming running back, the men grinned.\u201cLa Su, the elder has been looking for you the entire day, why are you out so late?\u201d\u201cIt was raining just now. Did you go out to steal the Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva again?\u201d\u201cThe elder was looking for me? Throw down the rope, I had a pretty good haul this time!\u201d Su Ming sped up, and when he was underneath the gate, he patted the basket on his back proudly as he shouted loudly.A woven piece of rope was lowered down and Su Ming grabbed onto it, lithely climbing upwards. Within the span of a few breaths, he reached the top of the gate, smiling as he saw the tribesmen keeping watch. He then quickly walked down with the ladder propped by the side.\u201cBoy\u2019s an agile one for sure, and he\u2019s brave to boot. He already started climbing Dark Dragon Mountain alone many years ago. Looks like he\u2019s definitely going to become the tribe\u2019s common healer in the future.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that he doesn\u2019t have a Berserker Body, or else he would become a Berserk Healer just like the elder.\u201d The men sighed as they watched Su Ming leave.As Su Ming entered the settlement and ran in between the wooden houses, those who saw him called him La Su in a kind manner.La Su was not a name just for him, but also for all the children who did not go through the second Berserker\u2019s Awakening.Not too far away in a wooden house was a little girl about five or six years old. She was looking at Su Ming, and there was a sweet and innocent smile on her young face. She had her arms wrapped around a white little creature about the size of her palm. The little creature looked incredibly docile, and was just like a white fluff ball.\u201cBig brother La Su, did you bring something for Pipi to eat?\u201d When the little girl saw Su Ming, she started giggling happily.\u201cTong Tong, this is for you.\u201d Su Ming let out a chuckle, running towards her and bringing out some fruits from his bosom. He gave them to the little girl, and as the girl giggled happily, Su Ming ran off. Before long, he reached the middle part of tribe where he saw many of his tribesmen laughing and chatting around the bonfire when he was outside earlier.A fire-resistant wooden fence surrounded the bonfire. Many slices of juicy meat were being roasted on the fire and they emitted a nice aroma.When some of the girls in the tribe saw Su Ming approaching, they merely cast him a glance before turning away uninterested.To the tribe, the clean and handsome Su Ming was built much more differently compared to the other tribesmen. Almost all of the tribesmen were bigger and more intimidating than he was.He squeezed through the crowd, grabbed a slice of roasted meat and ate it as he ran forward.Right in the center of the crowd was an old man wearing sackcloth instead of beast skin. The old man had his hair braided and looked frail. Nevertheless, his eyes shone with a charm that could steal a person\u2019s soul if they so much as looked into his eyes.He appeared to be a man of status. He was surrounded by several tribesmen who were listening to him as he talked in a low voice. Their gazes towards him were respectful.As he saw Su Ming running over, the old man smiled and gave him a nod, signaling Su Ming to sit by his side. He then continued speaking to the tribesmen.When the tribesmen saw Su Ming, their faces also lifted up in smiles.\u201cDark Mountain Tribe may be small, but at least we are the true descendants of Dark Mountain. The Elder from Wind Stream Tribe is celebrating his birthday. We must attend his birthday as a sign of respect since our tribe has maintained a good relationship with them since long ago.\u201d The old man spoke slowly.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that a few centuries ago, Dark Mountain Tribe was divided, and now, there are only three colonies of the tribe left. If that hadn\u2019t happened, Dark Mountain Tribe would be a medium sized tribe by now. We could have controlled all the land around the area, including Wind Stream Tribe. But now\u2026 ha.\u201d The one who spoke was a man of about 40 years old. He was the leader of Dark Mountain Tribe and was a burly man who was also shockingly powerful. There were nine fangs about the size of fingers hanging around his neck.There was a Mark on his face that could barely be seen, which made him look even more terrifying, just like an evil spirit. The Mark was not clear, and it looked incomplete.As Su Ming looked at the Mark, his eyes were filled with admiration. From the beast skin scroll, Su Ming knew that this was a Berserker Mark that had yet to be completely formed. There was no one in the tribe who had the ability to completely manifest the Berserker Mark and bring out its true powers.Even his elder was only at the ninth level of the Blood Solidification Realm.Yet even so, this had made his elder one of the strongest Berserkers among the tribes around Dark Mountain. The only other tribes who could compare were Black Mountain Tribe and Dark Dragon Tribe, who were once from the original Dark Mountain Tribe but split up later.\u201cThere is no use mentioning what has happened in the past. Without a strong Berserker who has broken through his physical limitations, there is no way we can become a medium sized tribe. The cause of the original Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s separation was due to the death of the ancestors in the original Dark Mountain tribe who Awakened.\u201d\u201cAs much as I have trained until now, I still cannot break through the ninth level of blood solidification and reach the 10th level, much less the 11th level, which is known as the highest level. I cannot draw a completely manifested Berserker Mark and therefore, cannot Awaken \u2026\u201d The old man in sackcloth sighed and spoke slowly.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You can leave now. Prepare the gifts, and tomorrow\u2026 Shan Hen, you are the leader of the hunters in the tribe so, you will lead the team.\u201d The old man stood up and looked towards a middle-aged man standing by the leader of Dark Mountain Tribe. After that, he turned and walked away.The middle aged man looked calm. When he heard those words he immediately stood up straight and received the order.Su Ming quickly followed his elder and left the area where the feast was held.The old man did not speak on the way and just silently walked forward until the cheers gradually disappeared behind his back. He reached a house made of wood and grass. He then went inside.The house was not big and the interior was simple. Once he entered the house, the old man sat down cross-legged at a corner. He looked at Su Ming as he came in.\u201cYou went to hunt Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva again?\u201dSu Ming respected his elder, who took care of him as he grew up. He placed his basket on the floor and took out a small bottle, which he then handed it to the old man.\u201cWith your agility, the Dark Dragons cannot harm you. However, it\u2019s best if you don\u2019t go too often\u2026 That is the territory of Black Mountain Tribe and Dark Dragon Tribe after all. Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva is useless to me. Use it to improve your own health.\u201d The old man looked kindly at Su Ming.Su Ming nodded and put away the bottle. He had been drinking this liquid for many years and it was precisely because of it that he could obtain such an agile body.It was also because his elder had been brewing all sorts of medicine for him for all those years. Even though he did not have the qualities to obtain the Berserker Body, he was still stronger than an average member of his tribe.\u201cThere are still three days left before the time comes for all of you La Su to perform the Berserker\u2019s Initiation. You\u2019re almost 16, right? You will need to worship the God of Berserkers,\u201d the old man spoke slowly as he looked at Su Ming.\u201cThe statue of the God of Berserkers in Dark Mountain Tribe was passed down from the original Dark Mountain Tribe in the past. It may not be the main statue and cannot compare to the statues of medium sized tribes, but it is still very powerful compared to the tribes around us.\u201dSu Ming was silent for a brief moment before nodding his head.\u201cDon\u2019t leave for the next few days. Rest and go with them to the Initiation three days later,\u201d The old man said this and closed his eyes slowly.Su Ming stood for a while longer. Then, he took the basket and left quietly towards a wooden house not too far away \u2013 his house.He could never forget the day when he surrounded the statue of the God of Berserkers with other children from the tribe for his very first Awakening. They were all just seven years old at that time.Members of the Berserker Tribe had two initiating ceremonies throughout their lives \u2013 the Berserker\u2019s Initiation. The first was when they were seven years old, and the second when they were 16.At the same time, the elder would choose those who had Berserker Bodies using the power given by the statue of the God of Berserkers.Su Ming let out a light sigh as he felt his chest filling up with bitterness. He wanted to become a Berserker and practice Berserker Arts. The scenes depicted in the beast skin scroll made him dream about it since he was young, but reality was harsh. When his seven-year old self worshiped the statue of the God of Berserker, he was told very clearly that he did not have a Berserker Body and could not practice Berserker Arts.Berserk was the origin of all things in the universe. Only by being a Berserker could a person be able to stand above others and become truly strong!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFrom the scroll, Su Ming knew since young that there were many tribes of all sizes in the world. In each tribe, there were different statues of the God of Berserkers. It was the soul of the tribe and the key for their descendants to become one with Berserk.They needed to reach an understanding with the statue of the God of Berserkers. If they felt it responding, then they would be able to obtain the right to inherit the skills to practice Berserker Arts. There was no need for anyone to teach them. They could just practice it on their own.However, if they failed at seven and at 16 years old, then it meant that they could not change for the rest of their lives. Su Ming was struggling internally. When he could not see the possible outcome to this, he looked forward to it. Yet, when there was only three days left for his final enlightenment, he became afraid.\u2018This time\u2026 will it be possible\u2026?\u2019Su Ming went back silently into his house and sat down, letting his mind wander.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Ming laid on his bed and looked at the darkness around him, unable to sleep. His elder\u2019s words kept repeating themselves in his head and he kept remembering the scene from eight years ago.With a long sigh, Su Ming sat up and quietly pushed open his wooden door. A light breeze blew through his messy hair. The breeze felt cooling, as if it had arrived with the night to cool down the earth.It was quiet. There were only a few soft cries from birds and other animals from Dark Mountain, which was located in the distance. The settlement was mostly dark. The only sources of light were from the bonfire in the center of the tribe. Some of its embers scattered into the air. There were also torches placed on the giant wooden wall around the tribe, which seem to crackle as they burned in the night.Su Ming lifted his head and looked at the sky. The moon and stars shone brightly in the sky, and it was a sight to behold. The river of stars seemed to never end, and it gradually clouded Su Ming\u2019s eyes with uncertainty.\u2018The tribesmen are kind to me\u2026but it\u2019s obvious that I look different from them\u2026 Perhaps this is the reason why I failed when I worshiped the statue of the God of Berserkers\u2026\u2018Without a Berserker Body, it will be impossible for me to train in Berserker Arts, then I will be trapped here forever, unable to leave, unable to see the world as depicted in the beast skin scroll\u2026\u2019Su Ming sat down quietly outside and leaned against his house. As he looked at the sky, his uncertainty grew stronger.Right at that moment, a melodious whine echoed in the air gently. The sorrow in the notes seemed to have fused with the moon and melted into the ground beneath Dark Mountain Tribe.Su Ming frowned. His straying thoughts were broken by that melody, and he knew without even having to stand and look that his tribesman, Liu Di, was playing the xun again.Liu Di was a low leveled Berserker. His favorite past time was to play that strange xun. The songs from that instrument were incredibly sorrowful, and every single time Su Ming heard it, he would be affected by some degree of sadness, which was why he did not really like those songs.\u201cSince the creation of the world and of man, the Berserker Tribe has existed and it still exists to this date\u2026 The people who hold the Berserker\u2019s Power are known as Berserkers. They can fly in the skies, move mountains and turn the tides in the sea\u2026Those who have the Berserker Mark can read the future and obtain the power of the sun, moon, and stars\u2026\u201d The young man looked at the sky and murmured softly as he sat in a corner in Dark Mountain Tribe that night.At that time, he did not realize that the black stone hanging from his neck was emitting a dim glow once again\u2026Time passed by quickly and the third day arrived.As it was the day of the Initiation for the La Sus in Dark Mountain Tribe, the entire tribe bustled with activity that morning. Almost all the tribesmen came out with their La Sus and gathered at the square.An entire day was required for the Berserker\u2019s Initiation ritual, especially for the La Sus who were 16 years old. It was like a coming of age ceremony. The La Sus who had completed the Berserker\u2019s Initiation could even choose their own partners on this day.Drum rolls with a strange rhythmic pattern resounded in the tribe. Backed by the drum roll, the La Sus stepped forward from the crowd and stood in the center.There were approximately 30 people participating in the Berserker\u2019s Initiation this time. Most of them were teenagers. Although they were still young, their bodies were strong and muscular, and they exuded an air of toughness.Even the girls had a similar build to the men. Hence, Su Ming was especially eye-catching among the crowd. He looked clean and handsome, an odd addition to his surroundings.Even so, the people there already accepted Su Ming a long time ago. Even though he looked different from the rest of them, they did not ostracize him but accepted him as part of the tribe.Once they surrounded the La Sus who were ready to partake in the Initiation, Dark Mountain Tribe performed a traditional dance as a sign of worship to heaven. By doing so, they used their bodies to convey their respect and sacrifice to heaven and earth.\u201cSu Ming, I heard from the others that you also went to Dark Dragon Mountain and even got some Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva?\u201d A good-natured voice sounded from Su Ming\u2019s side amidst the cheers from their dancing tribe members.It was a young man of the same age as Su Ming. His skin was rough and he had a large build, almost twice Su Ming\u2019s size. His eyes were bright and he smiled boyishly as he looked at Su Ming.Su Ming smiled weakly as he looked at the young man speaking to him. The youth\u2019s name was Lei Chen. He was one of his few close friends within the tribe.\u201cI brought some back. I went to look for you yesterday but your father said you went with the hunting team to the mountains. Once the Initiation ceremony ends, come to my place and get some.\u201dLei Chen lit up brightly and moved towards him, the boyish smile still on his face.\u201cI could have returned earlier, but we ran into a mink deer on our way back. I remember you said that you needed mink deer blood for your medicine so I followed it. That\u2019s why I came back late.\u201dSu Ming knew that while his friend spoke of the encounter like it was no big deal, mink deer were exceptionally hard to kill and were very dangerous. Hence, he felt touched when he heard his friend\u2019s words.As the two of them spoke, the cheers around them gradually grew silent and the crowd made way for the elder. The elder wore a sack cloth and held a black cane made of bone in his hand. He walked towards the teenagers as he was escorted by a few tribe members.His appearance brought about silence. The teenagers looked at him respectfully, obviously afraid of the man.\u201cOffer the sacrifice to our Berserker Ancestors!\u201d His grandfather\u2019s eyes were bright as he looked at the people gathered around him, his gaze pausing momentarily on Su Ming. As he spoke, he waved the black cane in his right hand. Immediately, several well built men stepped forward from within the crowd. Each of them carried with them a tied up wild beast on their shoulders.The wild beasts were still alive and crying out in rage. They struggled fiercely but to no avail.There were 49 different types of beasts and they were all lifted up moments later to be placed around the teenagers. Their cries resounded throughout the settlement, and their cries sounded like they had the power to pierce through souls. Yet, they were surrounded by the tribesmen of Dark Mountain Tribe. They were pressed down, making it impossible for them to break free.The men standing by the beasts did not hesitate. All of them lowered their heads at the same time and took out sharp stone knives in their left hands. They then stabbed the beasts\u2019 throats, cutting off their heads in the process.Their cries were cut off abruptly as they were beheaded. It was a shocking sight and it made some of the La Sus partaking in the ritual turn pale in fear.Su Ming also looked pale but he bit his lip and bore through it. He cast a glance at Lei Chen and saw that his friend\u2019s eyes were filled with a scary glint screaming out for blood as if he was used to it or even enjoyed it. He looked completely different from the good-natured person Su Ming spoke to earlier.More fresh blood spilled forth like a fountain and filled the air with a foul stench. The blood splattered onto the La Sus, on their hair, their bodies and the ground under their feet.\u201cYou are fortunate because there are no longer any wars between tribes. But at the same time, you are unfortunate\u2026\u201d The elder looked at the teenagers standing before him and spoke softly.\u201cWhen I was young and went through my Initiation, I had to behead one of our enemies and drink their blood to complete my Berserker\u2019s Initiation.\u201d\u201cCompared to the present, you are fortunate\u2026 but you are also unfortunate because you only saw the blood of beasts and have never touched the heads of your enemies\u2026\u201d The elder mumbled and looked at the La Sus before raising the bone cane in his right hand and pointing forward.He raised his left hand, which was clenched in a fist and opened it. Immediately, a powerful gust of aura blasted forth from his body. The aura surrounded them and formed a powerful blast of wind that surrounded the entire Dark Mountain Tribe.Marks manifested on the elder\u2019s face, which then intertwined with each other and formed a picture that looked like a python.The python looked as if it was alive and real. It appeared on the elder\u2019s face in the form of an illusion, raising its head and roaring into the sky. Even if they could not hear it, all the members of Dark Mountain Tribe, including the stronger leaders shivered and took a step back.\u2018The Mark of the Dark Python\u2026This is the elder\u2019s Berserker Mark\u2026\u2019Su Ming stared at the elder with a dumbfounded expression. As he looked at the Marks on his face, he was filled with awe. The last time he saw this was nine years ago. When he saw it again this time, the shock was even stronger than before.\u2018The elder could destroy the entire tribe alone if he wanted to. He has such power and yet, he is only at the ninth level of the Blood Solidification Realm\u2026 Just how powerful are those who have Awakened then\u2026?\u2018Then there are those who have reached the Bone Sacrifice Realm, which is after Awakening\u2026 It was written in the beast skin scroll that the powerful ones in the Bone Sacrifice Realm are extremely rare even within medium-sized tribes. Only the truly big tribes would have a few Berserkers who have reached the Bone Sacrifice Realm.\u2019Su Ming felt his heart tremble. His desire to become a Berserker was growing stronger.\u201cWe offer the blood on the ground and the bodies of the beasts to summon Dark Mountain\u2019s statue of the God of Berserkers!\u201d The elder\u2019s voice rang through like thunder and broke Su Ming\u2019s train of thought. As the elder spoke, the carcasses of the beasts exploded. Their flesh, blood, and even the matter spilled on the ground and on the teenagers were absorbed by an unknown force. They gathered midair into a giant blob of blood and flesh.\u201cBerserker\u2019s Initiation!\u201d The big man standing by the elder\u2019s side, the tribe leader of the Dark Mountain Tribe shouted.All of the La Sus, including Su Ming, bit down their tongues with no hesitation and coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood. Their blood flew into the air and was absorbed by the blob. A thunderous roar sounded, after which the blob of blood and flesh transformed into a black statue.It was a terrifying statue that was half man, half beast, and it had an air of ancient savagery. In one of its hands, it held a long dragon and in the other it held a giant spear. Its gaze was filled with madness and blood thirst.Its appearance brought forth darkness in the sky, as if the sky was subjugated by its power.\u201cDark Mountain\u2019s statue of the God of Berserkers\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s heart beat thunderously against his chest, it felt like it was about to burst. However, at that moment, the stone on his neck emitted warmth into his body, making the uncomfortable feeling disappear.It stunned Su Ming momentarily. He was about to instinctively look down when the elder spoke.\u201cCome forth in order and enter the statue of the God of Berserkers to worship him!\u201dThe moment he finished speaking, a young man walked forward briskly and stood underneath the statue. Then he just disappeared. After a while, at the very place he disappeared, the young man was teleported back looking disappointed. He stepped aside without a word.\u201cNext!\u201d The one who spoke was the tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe. His gaze was serious. He looked at each and every one of the La Sus.One by one, the La Sus who were at the age of Initiation stepped forth. They disappeared and reappeared again after a while. This continued until a girl stepped into the statue and it glowed a brilliant shade of red.The entire tribe looked forth in excitement, even the elder focused his gaze on the statue. They saw that the statue glowed red nine times consecutively before the girl was transferred back.\u201cShe possesses a Berserker Body!\u201d\u201cThe statue has shined nine times. This is proof that she has a Berserker Body!\u201dWhen the girl appeared, her face was bright with happiness.\u201cYour name is Wu La, no? Very good, come stand by my side.\u201d The elder smiled faintly and nodded at the girl as he looked at her.As he watched the girl move towards the elder, Su Ming fell silent. Then he gritted his teeth and walked towards the statue. His actions immediately caught the attention of the other members of the tribe.The members of Dark Mountain Tribe were mostly kind towards the young man who was obviously different from them. They kept their gazes on Su Ming until he stood underneath the statue.Su Ming took a deep breath and cast a glance at his elder, who was looking back at him not far away. He closed his eyes. The moment he did so, he felt an indescribable force enveloping his entire body like he was being sucked into mud. When he opened his eyes, everything around him had changed.This was not Dark Mountain Tribe, but a small space which was completely dark save for the black statue emitting a red glow floating before him.This statue was the same as the statue he saw outside and it emitted the same aura of ancient savagery.As he watched the statue of the God of Berserkers, Su Ming fell silent and bowed deeply towards it.Once he was done, Su Ming\u2019s face was filled with bitterness. He knew it. If he had the Body of Berserkers, he only needed to bow once for the statue to emit a red glow. This was just like nine years ago. There was absolutely no change within the statue.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere is no way I can become a Berserker\u2026\u201d Su Ming bit his lip and sighed. Then, he turned to leave.However, at the very moment he turned around, he froze and turned back to look at the statue. He was shocked!At the same time, he saw the stone he had been ignoring all this while emitting a piercing light\u2026Translator\u2019s NotesXun: A Chinese wind instrument that somewhat resembles an ocarina, but while the ocarina\u2019s sound is sharper, the xun\u2019s sound has a softer edge to it.

The sound came too suddenly, stunning all the members of the tribe momentarily..The elder\u2019s eyes shone and he quickly stepped forward. He did not look at the statue of the God of Berserkers but cast his gaze immediately towards the sky. His gaze turned solemn.By then, many members of the tribe had noticed the abnormality and lifted their heads towards the sky.When they did, they saw clouds of black smoke forming in the air at a maddening speed. The smoke was gathered from all directions and it quickly formed a whirlwind. The whirlwind covered at least half of the sky and the entirety of the Dark Mountain. Even if the mountain range was huge, they could still see and tell that something abnormal was happening on the land.Once the whirlwind was formed, it started moving slowly and it let out thunderous roars which reverberated throughout the surroundings. Within the whirlwind, there were numerous thunderbolts traveling about in arcs. As they crackled in the whirlwind, they boomed.\u201cHave our Berserker Ancestors returned?!\u201d Someone from the Dark Mountain Tribe exclaimed. All of them knelt down, their gazes filled with reverence and fear. They turned towards heaven and worshiped.The only ones who were standing were the elder and the leaders of the tribe. Besides the elder, the other leaders all looked alarmed.The speed of the whirlwind became faster. After a while, a typhoon began sweeping through the land. It affected the entire land around the Dark Mountain.The floating statue trembled violently like it could not withstand the pressure that resulted from the whirlwind.On the other side of Dark Mountain, there was a tribe about the same size. The tribe\u2019s name was Black Mountain. At that moment, all the tribe members were dumbstruck as a statue of the God of Berserkers about the size of 100 feet appeared before them in midair.The statue\u2019s size was completely black and had no human characteristics. It looked like a lizard and it kept trembling as if it was about to fall apart. Underneath the statue was a wizened and thin old man wearing a black, long-sleeved shirt made of sackcloth. His gaze was dark and his thoughts were unknown.The same thing happened within the others tribes near the Dark Mountain and even within some tribes that were located further away.No one knew what was happening and how the whirlwind came to be, not even the elder of the Dark Mountain Tribe. He had neglected to think about Su Ming who went into the statue of the God of Berserkers for worship.When the dim light appeared within the statue of the God of Berserkers at the Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s settlement, it occupied the entire space. It bathed the entire area in its strange light. Su Ming was stupefied. He saw various surrounding statues shaking, as if they were waking up after a long slumber. It was almost like they had physical bodies.He saw that the statues, which were themselves terrifying to look at, trembling furiously while bathing in the light as though they could not withstand it.The statue of the God of Berserkers was crafted in the image of a hybrid between a man and a beast, something like a chimera. In its left hand it held a huge dragon, and in its right a spear. As it shook, the savage vibe Su Ming felt earlier had however changed into fear. Su Ming was left wondering whether he was imagining it.Su Ming\u2019s mind was blank. He did not know what was happening and he did not know what to do. He just stood there, stunned.His entire body was also covered in the light that emitted from the piece of debris on his neck. It made him look like he had fused with the space. As the light grew brighter, the world within the statue of the God of Berserkers became completely tainted by the color from the debris.Su Ming felt something shattering in his head. It was as if a barrier had just been broken by an invisible force. It caused his body to tremble and in his head, he saw an odd image.It was a huge plain. Su Ming looked down from where he was in midair. What he saw was hundreds upon thousands of people appearing on the land. He could not see the end of the crowd. There seemed to be no end to it.\u201cWhere\u2026 is this?\u201d Su Ming muttered. This scene shocked him completely and made him incapable of thought.The people were divided into two crowds. They all knelt on the ground and lifted their hands to worship the heavens. There was also the sound desolate drums thundering in the air. It formed a melody that seemed to resonate with the soul and captivate all those who listened.All around Su Ming were hundreds of gigantic statues of the God of Berserkers. Each statue was unique on its own and all of them exuded an air of ancient savagery. Their bodies appeared to be made of flesh like they had life.They too knelt down on one knee and lifted their hands in worship towards the sky!Su Ming lifted his head and he saw\u2026At the highest point of the sky were two people who could only be called the pinnacle of humanity. Su Ming could not see their faces but with only one glance, he thought he was looking at the glory of heaven, and he was just an ant beneath their feet.They were just like real gods!One of them had long, purple hair. He raised his right hand and waved it at the sky. Immediately, the world experienced a change. In an instant, day became night and stars shone brightly in the sky. As the person waved his hand, the stars seemed to be attracted by a force and fell from the sky. They gathered by the purple haired person\u2019s side and formed a river of stars.The man pointed at a direction with his right hand and the river of stars made a monstrous blast before speeding towards their enemies. The scene was akin to heaven collapsing and the powers of the entire sky belonging to one person.The man in purple lowered his gaze suddenly during the blast, and as he looked at the crowd, his eyes locked with Su Ming\u2019s.Su Ming could feel his mind being attacked. There was a great force pushing him out, and he was expelled from the seemingly illusionary world.Su Ming trembled, his sight covered by darkness. After a long while, he regained his consciousness and found himself still inside the statue of the God of Berserkers. There was no light around him and it seemed like it was all in his imagination.Su Ming\u2019s breathing was quick and shallow. His entire body was drenched in sweat. He looked at the piece of debris hanging from his neck. It was still black and it emitted the tiniest bit of warmth but there was nothing else unusual about it.\u201cWas it an illusion\u2026 or was it the statue\u2019s memories\u2026? Just now\u2026 it was just like the writings in the scroll. That was the power to control the stars and the skies\u2026\u201d After a long while, Su Ming got out from his shock.. His gaze was filled with uncertainty and his thoughts were in a mess. He fell silent for a while. Then he got up and bowed once more towards the statue, getting ready to leave.Yet just as he was about to bow down, he heard a chipping sound before him. He saw a small crack on the statue\u2019s face, which seemed to grow as Su Ming lowered his back further.The statue gave the impression that it could not withstand Su Ming bowing down to it. It was as if Su Ming bowed down and worshiped it, the statue would break apart. Su Ming took in a sharp breath at this strange sight. He had no doubt about it. What he saw was not an illusion!The very moment the statue cracked apart, there were low mumbling sounds reverberating in his head. Those low murmurs made Su Ming\u2019s eyes light up in ecstasy. This sound was what he had been hoping for; the ways to train in Berserker Arts for those who had reached the Blood Solidification Realm!It was impossible to pass down the ways through oral tradition. The only way was by obtaining it from the statue of the God of Berserkers. Hence, the presence of such a statue was of extreme importance in a tribe as it was connected to the tribe\u2019s survival.When the low murmurs disappeared, Su Ming\u2019s body also disappeared from within the statue and reappeared amid the Dark Mountain Tribe. When he appeared, he saw all his tribesmen including the elder had their heads lifted towards the sky. He felt his heart pounding against his chest and he followed their gazes upward.The giant whirlwind was still swirling about, letting out low rumbling sounds.\u201cSu Ming, come to my side.\u201d Su Ming heard the elder\u2019s voice nearby. He was afraid. He could feel the abnormality in the air and he knew it had something to do with the piece of debris hanging from his neck. However, he did not dare say it out loud. He walked towards the elder in trepidation and stood behind him.Before long, the scene in the sky gradually disappeared and it returned to normal. No one asked whether Su Ming was successful as there was no light from his turn, which could only mean failure.The remaining La Sus entered the statue to worship once more as soon as the sky returned to normal. When they were all done, two children were known to possess the Berserker Body at the age of 16 during that Initiation ritual.The two children were taken away by the elder as they were going to be important members of the tribe. They would learn about various experiences when training in the Ways of the Berserkers.The other La Sus left in disappointment. Su Ming went back in silence but his heart was beating increasingly faster. He wanted to tell the elder everything but somewhere in his mind he knew that this was too serious a matter to be discussed. Especially since the statue of the God of Berserkers had cracked because of this.Su Ming walked into his house while he thought about it.The elder looked at Su Ming\u2019s back from afar, puzzled.Su Ming went back into his house hurriedly and sat on his wooden bed. He looked at the black and uneven debris on his chest, his gaze uncertain. After a while, he reached out to take off the necklace but he hesitated. He got up and barred the door with a wooden block. If anyone decided to come in, he would know and have time to prepare.After that, he sat down and held the debris in his hand, observing it carefully.Just what is this stone? Xiao Hong found it, so it might have been because the wind was too strong and it was revealed after all the leaves were blown away. Then Xiao Hong picked it up\u2026Su Ming\u2019s heart pounded furiously against his chest. He had a feeling he just got his hands on a piece of treasure.Even the statue of the God of Berserkers cracked before it\u2026 I wonder where Xiao Hong got this. Are there more of these?Su Ming licked his lips, his eyes filled with excitement.I did not possess the Berserker Body and could not inherit the ways to train in Berserker Arts but this thing allowed me to obtain it!Su Ming took a deep breath and quelled his excitement. Then, he focused all his energy on the piece of debris.Time passed and Su Ming grew tired. He held the piece of debris in his hand and fell asleep on his bed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe piece of debris began emitting a very dim glow once again.Translator\u2019s Note:An explanation on some measurements in the story:1. Let\u2019s begin with a simple one. 1 \u65f6\u8fb0 is equivalent to 2 hours. Since\u65f6\u8fb0is a time measuring system used only during the dynasties and the translation is still hours, I\u2019ve decided to convert it to our hour based system, which every single time you see 2 hours or anything related to hours in this novel, it is 2 hours of our time, not 4 hours.2. \u4e08is also a measurement system used during the dynasties. 1 \u4e08 is equal to 10 \u5c3a, and 1\u5c3a is equal to 1 foot,which is 30.3cm. So, 1 \u4e08is 3.3m. Since\u4e08 does not exist in the western world and I want to try avoiding the use of pinyin as much as possible (unless they are proper nouns for proper places and things), I decided to convert all measurements of \u4e08 to feet, hence when you see 3\u4e08 in the original text, it means 30 feet. 1,000\u4e08 is 10,000 feet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Brother\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother\u2026 I\u2019m waiting for you\u2026\u201d The voice was tired as if it had been calling out for eternity. It became weaker and the sound slowly disappeared.As the voice grew weaker, Su Ming felt a gut-wrenching pain in his dreams. It was as though something of utmost importance to him disappeared along with the voice. The feeling jolted him awake from his sleep.Su Ming felt cold. He was drenched in his sweat. His face was pale and he was breathing heavily. He looked at his surroundings and began to calm down when he saw that he was surrounded by familiar sights.It was midnight. He could hear the sounds of birds and beasts from afar. Aside from that, everything was silent. Su Ming sat up quietly on his bed and looked at the stone in his hand. He looked doubtful.\u2018That dream just now was weird\u2026 I wasn\u2019t tired either but I fell asleep as I was observing the stone. That dream\u2026 that voice\u2026\u2019Su Ming\u2019s face was clouded with uncertainty. He rarely had dreams and he definitely never dreamed about something like that before. Yet somehow, the girl\u2019s voice was oddly familiar.\u2018All of this must be related to this thing!\u2019Su Ming lowered his gaze and looked carefully at the stone in his hand using the moonlight as his source of light. He frowned.\u2018Just what is this\u2026?\u2019He hesitated for a brief moment and then bit his finger. According to the scroll, most of the treasures in the world could only be activated with blood.Up until then, Su Ming had never seen such treasures before. The stone was the only one he had ever seen. As the blood from his finger fell on top of the stone, Su Ming began to look at it expectantly.Yet after a long while, nothing happened. There was no sign of the blood being absorbed either.Su Ming scratched his head, but he was stubborn. He got up and used all sorts of methods, be it biting the stone with his teeth, trying to force it apart with his hands, and even soaking it in water. Nevertheless, there were still no changes on stone.It was almost dawn. Su Ming held the stone in his hands and his mind wandered. Time passed and morning arrived. As the sun rose, Su Ming got an idea.\u2018When I placed it on my chest, I felt some sort of heat from it. Perhaps\u2026 This might be its use!\u2019Su Ming placed the stone once again around his neck without hesitation, letting it hang close to his chest.Waves of warmth spread out and seeped into Su Ming\u2019s body. That warmth traveled through his body, enveloping his entire body in a comfortable feeling. He took a deep breath, and in his mind, Su Ming saw the methods to train in Berserker Arts which he obtained from the statue.Berserk was the origin of all things in the world. Now, Su Ming had obtained the methods to train in the first realm in Berserker Arts \u2013 the methods to train in the Blood Solidification Realm.Su Ming knew from the scroll that since ancient times, when their Berserker Ancestors created heaven and earth, all humans possessed remarkable abilities. Yet as time passed, the Berserker Tribe became a legend. They were no longer as they were before. They had all become common people.The methods to train in Berserker Arts were also passed down from ancient times, but they had been modified to suit the present Berserker Tribes. The very first realm, the Blood Solidification Realm was divided into 11 levels. It allowed the practitioners to activate the Berserker Blood they had inherited from their ancestors and solidify it.The power of the statue of the God of Berserkers was in reality used to search for those who had inherited denser Berserker Blood from their ancestors, and these people were deemed to possess Berserker Bodies. Only they could walk on and travel down the path of Berserkers.A normal member of the tribe would not be recognized by the statue because their blood was thin with Berserker Blood. That was why they did not possess the right to become Berserkers. That was also why when they worshiped the statue of the God of Berserkers, they would not obtain the ways to train in Berserker Arts.However, Su Ming was special. He may not have possessed a Berserker Body, but due to this mysterious stone, he obtained the ways to train in Berserker Arts. Berserker Arts was something difficult to pass down even through oral tradition, and it was something only possible for the tribes who possessed the statue of the God of Berserkers.\u201cFocus and solidify the Berserker Blood in your blood veins and you will awaken the blood. Draw the Berserker Mark unique to your own to Awaken!\u201d Su Ming muttered with his eyes shining brightly.He sat down cross legged and took a few deep breaths. He closed his eyes slowly. After that, he gradually immersed himself in the training method he obtained.Soon after, the sun had risen to the peak of the sky. Smoke could be seen, signaling the bonfire was lit in the tribe. The tribe started to bustle with activity. The hunting team, led by several leaders in the tribe, ventured out to hunt for food with blessings from their families.Some of the La Sus who were around four to five years old were running around naked and playing happily. The cheerful sounds brought about smiles on the faces of the tribe members.The two tribe members who were told that they possessed Berserker Bodies were at the elder\u2019s house. They were listening to lectures on how to train in Berserker Arts, as well as how to become a Berserker and how to become an important asset to the tribe.As of that point in time, Dark Mountain Tribe only had 22 Berserkers after the older generation had passed away.No one noticed the door to Su Ming\u2019s house was shut tightly that morning. Within the house, he was emitting a dim, blood red light. The light came from every single vein in his body. It was a bewitching sight to behold as his blood veins glinted in red.Only one blood vein emerged from Su Ming\u2019s body and it appeared vague. It looked like it could not manifest itself completely.After a long while, Su Ming opened his eyes and his breathing was shaky.\u201cIf more blood veins emerge during the training in the Blood Solidification Realm, then it means the possibilities of Awakening would also be greater. But reaching the Awakening Realm is too hard. According to the scroll, only those who have Awakened their physical limitations have the right to call themselves Berserker Masters. A person who has arrived at the Awakening Realm has at least the ability to turn a small tribe into a medium sized tribe!\u201d\u201cThe elder has already solidified half of the Berserker Blood in his body but he has yet to reach Awakening. There is no one around us who has yet to reach the Awakening Realm.\u201dSu Ming continued mumbling. The Awakening Realm was a dream too far away for him at that moment. He was worried whether he could manage to even reach the first level in the Blood Solidification Realm.To reach the first level in the Blood Solidification Realm, he needed at least three of his blood veins to emerge.Those who possessed a Berserker Body would be able to manifest three blood veins very quickly into their training and arrive at the first level of the Blood Solidification Realm. They would be unlike Su Ming, who could barely even manifest the first vein.He was off to a rocky start, but Su Ming did not give up. As long as he could train, he had hope.Besides, when he was trying to make all the blood veins in his body emerge, he could feel the stone on his chest growing hotter. This lifted Su Ming\u2019s spirits. He had a feeling that he held the key to the activation of his treasure.Seven days had passed. Within those seven days, Su Ming barely left his house. He was seldom hungry, which puzzled his mind. It was stated in the scroll that Berserkers would have an increased appetite during the Blood Solidification Realm because they were activating all the blood veins in their bodies. This would allow them to grow faster physically and create more fresh blood for their training.However, there was no sign of hunger within Su Ming. He thought about it and attributed this to the strange warmth emitted by stone.Within those seven days as well, Lei Chen dropped by once to give Su Ming the mink deer blood and take some Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva. Lei Chen was tested and proven to possess the Berserker Body when he was seven. He had already reached the fourth level of the Blood Solidification Realm by now. He was able to manifest 23 blood veins from his body and even within the hunting team, his abilities were at least of an average level.Before he left, he hesitated briefly. He wanted to cheer Su Ming up, but in the end, he chose to look at Su Ming and speak honestly.\u201cSu Ming, we grew up together. I\u2019ll protect you from now on. If anyone bullies you, then they\u2019re my enemy as well!\u201d Once he finished, he swung his arm in a powerful manner and left with a boyish grin.Su Ming watched Lei Chen leave feeling touched.Life in the tribe was simple but it was not boring. Almost all of the members of the tribe had their own task to perform to contribute to the tribe.Half a month after the Berserker\u2019s Awakening, Su Ming once again took his basket and left for the forest alone after reporting to the members of the tribe.Su Ming was like a different person once he went into the forest. He was agile. He could speed forth like an arrow with a jump and climb up a big tree with just a few leaps. As he sat on a tree branch, he smiled. He was proud of his own speed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven if I haven\u2019t completed the first level of Blood Solidification Realm, my body has become much more agile than before.Su Ming placed two fingers in his mouth and whistled. The whistle travelled far and echoed as it did. Soon, a flash of red came from afar. The red blur was quick and it reached Su Ming in a flash.Su Ming grinned widely and jumped forward as soon as the blurry red figure approached. It screamed and chased after Su Ming.\u201cXiao Hong, let\u2019s see who reaches the top of the mountain first today!\u201d There was joy in Su Ming\u2019s voice, and as he spoke, he ran forward. Behind him was Xiao Hong. The monkey\u2019s face was scornful. It did not think that competing with Su Ming was something worth doing. It was even eating a fruit in its hand at that moment. Xiao Hong scratched its face and chased after Su Ming lazily.However, the monkey soon grew restless and its screams became sharper. Its gaze was filled with shock and it threw away the fruit in rage, chasing after Su Ming with everything it had.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His body was like an arrow as he shot through the forest using his familiarity with the forest and his agility. Very soon, Dark Dragon Mountain appeared before his eyes. Once he got out of the forest, he would be able to get into Dark Dragon Mountain.For Su Ming, who came to this mountain since he was young to collect herbs, every single living thing here gave off an aura that put him at ease.\u201cIt\u2019s written in the scroll that the Berserkers can increase their strength by calling forth their blood and make their bodies stronger while they are training in the Blood Solidification Realm due to honing the Berserker Blood within their bodies. I thought I would never obtain such an opportunity but to think that I would be able to experience it today!\u201d\u201cTo reach the first level in the Blood Solidification Realm, the manifestation of three blood veins is needed. But even if I have yet to manifest all three, my speed has increased by leaps and bounds. Even my strength has\u2026\u201d Su Ming jumped forward and whilst in midair, he swung his right fist at the giant tree beside him.With a huge crash, the faint outline of his fist could be seen on the tree. But at the same time, Su Ming\u2019s right hand also felt numb, though his face was filled with excitement.But as he was drowning in excitement, a flash of red ran past him and let out a string of proud screeches. Obviously, it was made by the little monkey who felt pleased with itself for catching up to Su Ming and surpassing him.Su Ming smiled and chased after the red blur. His speed did not decrease but he could not catch up to the little monkey. In the past, every single time he reached Dark Dragon Mountain, that monkey would be waiting for him impatiently with a face filled with scorn as if it had been waiting for him for a long time.But now, after two hours, as Su Ming climbed Dark Dragon Mountain and reached the same big rock with a hollow located in one of the mountains, he saw the monkey. While it still looked at him with scorn and disdain, its forehead was covered in sweat, showing that while it had arrived before him, it did not wait for long this time.Su Ming smiled and went up to touch the monkey\u2019s head. He took off the basket and stood on top of the rock. As he looked at the mist around the area, he took a deep breath.He liked standing there looking at the sights before him, even if there was a deep canyon right underneath. If he took a few steps forward and if wind blew at him right then and there, it would cause him to stumble and fall. It was a dangerous place, but Su Ming had been climbing this mountain ever since he was young. To him, this place was like a second home.\u201cXiao Hong, how does it look like on the other side of the mountain\u2026 have you gone there before?\u201d Su Ming\u2019s hide shirt swayed along the wind and let out light flapping sounds. Instinctively, he reached out with his right hand and touched the black stone on his chest.The monkey by his side rolled its eyes and looked at the land located far away. It did not bother to reply Su Ming, but lowered its head to tug at its own fur as if it was looking for something.Su Ming scratched his nose when he saw the little monkey grooming itself and ignoring him. He shook his head and smiled, then decided to sit down cross-legged on the spot where he stood.\u201cXiao Hong, I\u2019m not going to return to the tribe for a while this time. I might be staying here for a while, so if you go out and play, get some fruits back for me.\u201dThe monkey beside him immediately lifted its head and looked at him with surprised eyes. It looked at Su Ming scrutinizingly, then smiled happily and nodded. It usually only got to spend three to five days with Su Ming. When Su Ming returned to the tribe, it would be left alone in the forest. Once it understood what Su Ming said, it was extremely happy.Su Ming took a few deep breaths and closed his eyes slowly as he felt the wind on his face. He was about to begin training there until he reached the first level in the Blood Solidification Realm. Only then would he leave.After all, Su Ming did not know how to explain what happened to him. Somewhere in his mind, he wanted to keep this a secret and let no one know about it.A red vein appeared from Su Ming\u2019s body soon after he closed his eyes. This red vein was giving off a dim red glow. It was no longer glinting, but showing signs of manifestation.It was the same red vein that had only appeared vaguely half a month ago. The same red vein that was now manifesting itself completely.Su Ming may not have any talent in practicing the Ways of the Berserker, but he was not the type to give up easily. Now, as he sat down with his legs crossed to train, time passed by slowly.The sun rose and set, the mist in the sky gathered and dispersed. The sounds of the birds and beasts echoed in the mountains, forming a sort of tranquility. Surrounded by that peace, Su Ming opened his eyes on the second day in the morning.He moved his body. When he looked back, he saw that the little monkey had gone off, but there were some fruits on the ground and some cores left from fruits that had been completely devoured.Su Ming picked up some of the fruits and ate a dozen of them. With his appetite, the fruits could only make him partially full. He may like to eat fruits but he was not fond of eating too many in one go.Once he finished eating, Su Ming sat down immediately and focused on refining the Berserker Blood within his body. But this time, Su Ming opened his eyes after a few moments with a puzzled look on his face.\u201cThe first blood vein has already manifested, but it seems like there\u2019s not enough blood in me for the second vein to appear\u2026\u201d Su Ming did not know how to describe it. It was as if the first vein itself absorbed more than half of the fresh blood in his body and there was not enough blood for the second vein to manifest itself.It was difficult to explain, but that was what Su Ming felt.\u201cI don\u2019t have enough blood\u2026\u201d Su Ming scratched his head and sighed. He did not know that practitioners of the ways of the Berserker, especially during the initial stages, while requiring a strong body to train, would also need to take in a huge amount of medicine that would greatly boost the formation of blood within the body to increase the speed of their training and subsequently allow each vein to manifest one after another.The strength of a Berserker in the Blood Solidification Realm was directly linked to the amount of blood veins and blood he had. The more blood a Berserker had, he would also be able to manifest more blood veins, and he would be stronger! Once the power was released, even with just their physical strength alone, they could tear apart a huge beast. This was Berserker Power!All these were the secrets of the tribe. Only those who possessed Berserker Bodies had the right to know about it.\u201cWhen the members of the tribe were injured, they would lose a large amount of blood. Their faces would grow pale and they would be weak. At that time, they would need to consume herbs that would help with the formation of blood\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up. After some careful thinking, he immediately slung the basket over his back and jumped towards the side of the mountain. This time, his speed was extremely fast and he returned about an hour later.When he returned, there were some herbs with dirt still attached to them in his basket. Once he cleaned those herbs, Su Ming took out a stone bowl from the basket. He crushed the herbs and mixed it with dew, which turned into a dark green concoction that emitted a strange smell.But he was already used to this smell. He breathed in a few whiffs of the smell, then added more herbs. Once it was done, he took a deep breath and drank the whole thing down.It was disgusting. Su Ming frowned in discomfort but forced himself to drink the whole thing before sitting down with his legs crossed again.It was not until midnight before Su Ming opened his eyes again. When he did, he stared into the darkness and let his mind wander.\u201cThere\u2019s a little effect\u2026 but only a little. The method is correct, but something is still wrong\u2026\u201d Su Ming frowned. He could not tell his elder about this. He could only rely on himself to solve the problem.\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up. As the common healer in the tribe, it was his job to collect herbs. He remembered every time he went to collect herbs, his elder would usually select some herbs from the pile and take it away. The rest would be given to the tribe leader and distributed to the tribe according to need. The herbs would be taken out of the herb storage when there was a need to use them to create medicine to cure the wounded and the sick.Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva was among those taken away by the elder. But Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva was no longer of any use to him, and thus, all of them were given to Su Ming to nourish his body.\u201cThere\u2019s still some Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva left after I gave some to Lei Chen.\u201d Su Ming immediately ruffled through the contents in the side pocket of the basket and took out the small bottle. When he opened it, there was the familiar fragrance wafting in the air. He shook it lightly. There was only a little less than half left.Without any hesitation, Su Ming placed the bottle by his lips and drank all the contents in one mouthful.Then he immediately sat down with his legs crossed, immersing himself in refining and solidifying the Berserker Blood in his veins. Su Ming had been drinking Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva since he was young. Every time he drank it, he would feel a bit faint with a sensation as if he was about to fall asleep drunk.But this was the first time he drank Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva to assist in his Berserker training. As the blood in his veins circulated in his body, he could feel a cold sensation growing within his body, spreading to all parts of his body very quickly.The cold gradually fused with the blood in his veins and increased the rate of circulation in his body. There were even signs of his blood rate increasing.\u201cI knew it!\u201d Su Ming felt excited. As he continued channeling his blood, his body suddenly shivered. He opened his eyes, his face filled with disbelief and doubt.\u201cHow could this\u2026 Is it the elder?\u201dWithin his body, Su Ming could clearly feel the coldness emerging from all parts of his body as he absorbed the chill brought about by Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva. That cold feeling seemed to have existed in his body for many years and had been laying dormant, waiting for the time to rush forth the moment he started refining the blood in his veins.And the key to activate it was the same Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva that Su Ming drank!Now, that cold seemed to gather from every part of his body, crashing through his veins like a gigantic wave to form a sea.This was a gift which the elder prepared for him when he was young. His body that had been nourished by Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva was the gift. If Su Ming walked on the Ways of the Berserker, then this power would aid him immensely in the earlier stages of his training. If he did not have the gift to practice in the Ways of the Berserker, then it would help keep his body healthy.Su Ming was dumbfounded. He could almost see his elder\u2019s kind eyes and his expectations towards him as he grew older over the years. Most of all, he remembered the disappointment in his eyes half a month ago.\u201cElder\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled. There was a low rumbling sound within his body. The vast amount of Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva that had gathered in his body over time rushed forth to drive his blood forward, causing the second blood vein in his body to appear immediately and manifest quickly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs the second blood vein appeared, the third blood vein immediately followed suit!There were even signs of the fourth blood vein appearing vaguely!Su Ming\u2019s body began rapidly growing bigger. The speed and the strength of his blood circulation brought about his physical growth. If this continued, then he would no longer be frail and weak, and he would be just like the other members of his tribe. He would obtain a strong body.Yet at that very moment, the stone hanging off Su Ming\u2019s chest suddenly gave off the very same piercing light as it did in the statue of the God of Berserkers!The moment the light came, things changed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It spread throughout his body in an instant and fused together with the cold brought by Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva, permeating into his blood.A clear roar could be heard from within Su Ming\u2019s body. As he was sitting down trembling furiously, the fourth blood vein manifested itself.At the same time, a large amount of black filth seeped out of Su Ming\u2019s pores. There was even a terrible stench in the air, but it disappeared along with the wind.With three blood veins, one could reach the first level of the Blood Solidification Realm. Now, Su Ming had become a Berserker who reached the first level of the Blood Solidification Realm!Still, he kept his eyes closed. There were no signs of him waking up. As time passed, the solidification of his blood gradually stopped as the fourth blood vein manifested.When the little monkey returned the next morning while sniffing at its right claw with a pleased look on its face, it was surprised when it saw Su Ming covered entirely in black filth. It scratched its head in confusion then circled Su Ming a few times.It may have obtained intelligence, but it did not know what was happening then. Curious, it approached Su Ming and reached out a claw, wanting to pat Su Ming.Just as it was about to touch Su Ming, the light once appeared strongly from within Su Ming\u2019s body. It reached its brightest in an instant and enveloped Su Ming entirely, making the monkey hang its mouth open in shock. Then before its very eyes, Su Ming\u2019s body disappeared.To the little monkey, Su Ming was taken by the light. This scene made it widen its eyes and let out a piercing screech. It rushed towards where Su Ming disappeared and began searching in frenzy, but it found nothing. It stood there, unmoving and stunned.Su Ming did not know where he was. He was currently looking at his surroundings in confusion. The place was enveloped in white mist. He could see too far into the distance, but he could see the vague outline of the peak of a mountain before him.He had just woken up, but he remembered he was in Dark Mountain. He could not understand how he got there.His gaze slowly turned cautious. He first lowered his gaze and looked at his chest, then felt his heart missing a beat. The strange black piece of debris was missing from his chest.\u201cIt\u2019s gone\u2026\u201d Su Ming was shocked. He looked around at his surroundings, then stood up slowly. His gaze was dark and alert as he started walking towards the mist covered mountaintop.The mountain was not far away. Within a short amount of time, Su Ming was standing at the foot of the mountain. As he lifted his head, he took in a sharp breath.It was the peak of a mountain for sure, but there were no plants on it. It was instead a barren land, as if it had been polished smoothly. There were a lot of pictures carved on it, mountains, rivers, strange beasts, the sky\u2026 and even words that Su Ming have never seen before. The place gave off a feeling as if it was from ancient times, as if came straight from the stories about the age of the savages.At the very moment Su Ming looked at the carvings on the mountaintop, a roaring sound echoed in the air. A crack appeared right in the middle of the mountain. It seemed that it had been cut apart by an invisible force.The crack was narrow, but he could still see the depth of the crack. It stopped under Su Ming\u2019s feet.Su Ming briefly hesitated, then gritted his teeth. He was already here, and he did not know how to get out of the place. He did not even know where he was. Now that there was a path before him, he had to trudge forward.Somewhere in his mind he felt that this was connected in some way to the black piece of debris, because he remembered clearly the heat emitted by the debris.Su Ming felt as if he walked for a long time as he went into the mountain following the narrow crack. The road before him gradually grew wider. There were also a lot of weird carvings on the walls around him. Su Ming could not understand it, but there were various plants and herbs on the carvings. There were also some naked people with messy hair surrounding an odd big pot fiddling around with the herbs.He continued observing the carvings until he caught a glimpse of the end out of the corner of his eyes. There was a door at the end, and Su Ming paused in his footsteps as he stood at the door.The same carving was on the door. There were five different herbs carved in the drawing. Uneven strings emitting the cold light Su Ming was already familiar with surrounded the drawing of the five herbs and formed a circle, completely covering the door.Right at the centre of the door were fifteen small holes. They looked as if something could be placed within. The holes formed a circle.Su Ming frowned, then scrutinized the door. He took a look at his surroundings again, then cast his gaze at the five herbs on the door.\u201cThis is\u2026 Iron Core Flower. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s the Iron Core Flower!\u201cThis is\u2026 it looks like Joyleaf, but it also looks like the Iced Catalpa Plant\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the Night Glitter Branch! I often collect these.\u201d\u201cWhat is this\u2026? It looks really familiar\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the last one\u2026\u201d After looking at it for a while, Su Ming hesitated. He did not know whether he should try and push the door open.Just as he was hesitating, he saw the strings surrounding the five herbs move and shine so brightly it could blind someone. As Su Ming was stunned by the light, the light floated from the door and sped towards Su Ming.The light was too quick, and Su Ming had no time to dodge it. Within just a moment, he was enveloped by the light.At the same time, a lot of memories not belonging to Su Ming flooded into his mind. These memories seemed to have been brought along with the light and forced their way into his head. It made Su Ming uncomfortable.He saw the figure of a person in his mind. He was just like the other people in the other drawings throwing herbs into a big pot. The person\u2019s actions were very fluid. Each time before he threw the herbs in, he would take a sniff at the herbs, then his gaze became serious. He waved at the air with his right hand and a wave of fire appeared in the air to surround the big pot.The process was extremely complicated. Even the size of the fire had to be controlled. Su Ming had never seen this before. It was not as complicated in the tribe either. They would usually just eat the herbs or at most turn them into a concoction to increase the effects.Su Ming became engrossed with the memories in his head. A long time passed before the person slammed his right hand against the pot.Immediately, the flame around the pot disappeared. The person opened the lid of the strange pot, and Su Ming immediately saw three green spherical objects the size of fingernails within the big pot.Even if they were just memories in his head, Su Ming could still faintly smell the scent of medicinal herbs in the air. When he looked at the three spherical objects, he became completely stunned, as if he was hit by lightning.He had been making medicine since he was young. With just a glance, he could tell the quality of various medicines. As he was now, he could not even begin imagining the effects of these spherical objects.The light around his body disappeared and returned to the door, causing the numerous strings that formed the circle on the door to also move.As the light faded, Su Ming\u2019s sight became clouded. He moved as if he was pushed by an invisible force. When his view cleared, a red blur came screeching towards him in joy.The red blur was, of course, Xiao Hong. It climbed over Su Ming and jumped happily on his body. When Su Ming disappeared, it had been terrified. Now that it saw Su Ming return, it was happy.Su Ming was stunned. He immediately looked at his surroundings and found that he had returned to the big rock on Dark Dragon Mountain. He lowered his head and saw the stone that had disappeared when he was inside the mysterious place still hanging on his chest.\u201cAll of this must be connected to this thing. Perhaps when I arrived at the first level of in the realm of Blood Solidification, I activated it, and all of that happened. Looking at Xiao Hong\u2019s reaction, I must not have been dreaming, but went physically to that place. Just what is this thing? Why is it here?\u201d Su Ming mumbled softly as he recalled the memories in his head.\u201cQuenching\u2026 the medicinal pills\u2026\u201d After a long while, Su Ming mumbled out the name of the process he saw in his head.\u201cScattering Dust\u2026\u201d This was the name of the medicinal pill, and it was also one of the many memories that appeared in his head.Su Ming spoke in a low tone. In his mind he saw the carving on the door. His eyes lightened up gradually. He may not know where the place was, but it was clear that quenching thing he saw had piqued his interest.In his view, the training to become a Berserker is related to those herbs that increased the blood rate in the body. They needed to consume lots of it to make their bodies stronger. That quenching process he saw in his head might be able to help immensely in his training.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a round medicinal pill like this in the tribe, not even the elder has seen one before, or else I would have definitely seen it. But that round medicinal pills seemed to be working pretty well. I wonder how strong the effects of the herbs would be once I finish making it.\u201d\u201cThen my next step would be to look for those five herbs. Xiao Hong, have you ever seen these two types of herbs?\u201d Once Su Ming made his decision, he called out to Xiao Hong and picked up a stone, then drew the two herbs that he was unable to identify on the ground before he looked expectantly at Xiao Hong.Xiao Hong looked at them with his teeth bared, then gave a nod.Su Ming felt his spirits lift. He walked around the big rock several times as his mind quickly processed his thoughts.\u201cI can find the herbs, but making that sort of medicinal pills will be complicated. There\u2019s even fire involved. It\u2019ll be just like cooking rice\u2026 Interesting.\u201d Once Su Ming had his thoughts sorted out, he frowned.He remembered that the pot itself was also odd. It was different from the pots used to cook rice in the tribe. As he was searching through the memories in his head, he learned the pot used for the quenching process had an odd name \u2013 the Barren Caldron.\u201cThe pots used in the tribe should be useless\u2026 I\u2019ll also need fire.\u201d Su Ming lifted his head suddenly as he was mumbling. His eyes were bright as he looked at one of the mountains located further away among the five mountains in Dark Dragon Mountain.That mountain was completely brown in color, and at this moment, there was smoke rolling out from the top of the mountain.Translator\u2019s Note:Quenching \u2013 A process in material sciences that mean a process of cooling down highly heated stuff, usually steel, in an attempt to harden it. For more info, please refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quenching\u6dec \u2013 Throwing highly heated steel into water to cool it down quickly.

    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9: Red MudTranslator:\u00a0Mogumoguchan\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0ZenobysEach one of the five mountains in Dark Dragon Mountain were different. The mountain which produced Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva was the closest to Dark Mountain Tribe. If he went any further, he might accidentally run into other people from other tribes.That was why Su Ming spent most his time here. He would only venture to the other mountains to collect some rarer herbs, and he did so with caution.Now, within Su Ming\u2019s sights was the mountain which had smoke rolling down from its peak, Black Flame Mountain.It is said that there was a huge amount of earthen fire1 within this mountain. A long time ago, this place was the centre of the Land of the Fire Berserker Tribe. Centuries may have passed since then, but if anyone approached this place, they could still feel waves of heat rolling off the ground.Su Ming was not unfamiliar with Black Flame Mountain. He had stepped foot in this place multiple times. He had even met the people from Black Mountain Tribe before. If it were not for his speed aiding his escape, he would have died much earlier.That place was very close to Black Mountain Tribe. Black Mountain Tribe had held grudges against Dark Mountain Tribe for generations. The sizes of both tribes were about the same. There may be no battles between them, but there were scuffles among their hunting teams, and these scuffles tended to be bloody and cruel.There was a moment of hesitation, but very soon Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up as he had a plan. He turned his gaze away from Black Flame Mountain after a long while, then quickly walked towards the deeper parts of the flat stone he was standing on. There were a few big stones within the hollowed parts of the stone. When Su Ming took them away, he saw an object that had been hidden underneath the stones.It was a crudely made bow!It may be crude, but the string of the bow, which was the size of a finger, was stretched tautly across the bow. Its power could be felt just by looking at it.Only hunters were allowed to possess bows within Dark Mountain Tribe. It was difficult for other tribe members to obtain one. Su Ming made the bow himself after he exchanged some materials to make that bow with the herbs he collected. He did not take it back to the tribe but kept it here. This was a secret that only Lei Chen knew.As he held the bow in his hands, Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up brightly. He took out another five arrows from underneath the big stones. The arrowheads were made of stone, and Su Ming would usually polish the arrowheads so that they would remain sharp.He placed the five arrows in the basket slung over his back. Su Ming held the bow in his hand and whistled at the little monkey before pointing at the herbs he drew on the ground.The little monkey understood him, and grinned at him displaying all its teeth before rushing forward in a red blur.Su Ming followed closely behind carefully. With just a few leaps, the man and the monkey disappeared from where they stood.If they were comparing their level of familiarity towards Dark Dragon Mountain, then Su Ming would never be able to compare with Xiao Hong. Under Xiao Hong\u2019s guidance, as the sun became a bright red and started to set, Su Ming\u2019s basket was filled with various medicinal herbs.There were about seven or eight types of herbs in the basket, and there were plenty for each type. These were all the herbs that Su Ming saw from the drawing, and even herbs that were similar to the drawings. He was unable to identify them completely, that was why he decided to take the herbs that bore similarities to the drawings as well.\u201cYou mean there\u2019s another herb that looks alike here?\u201d It was almost twilight by this point. Su Ming and Xiao Hong were standing in the forest near Black Flame Mountain. He was pointing at a patch of black mud on the ground before them, looking at Xiao Hong.Xiao Hong bobbed its head up and down, then gestured at Su Ming wildly before pointing at the setting sun in the sky.Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up in understanding. He squatted down and fixed his gaze at the swamp, waiting for the sun to set. Seconds ticked by slowly, and after half an hour, the light in the forest grew dim. It was almost as if everything outside a hundred feet radius within the forest had been consumed by darkness.As soon as night fell on the land, bubbles suddenly emerged from the mud. There was also the vague shape of a red plant. It was rising up so quickly as if it was swimming forward. The odd sight made Su Ming\u2019s hair rise, but he did not move.He watched as the red plant continued to swim in the mud, then slowly rise from it. It was the bud of a red flower. The roots were still hidden in the mud. It was obvious now that the flower had been moving about in the mud just now due to the movements of its roots.As he watched the flower buds emerge from the mud, they bloomed before Su Ming\u2019s eyes and let out a nice fragrance. Su Ming only took a whiff and immediately, he felt as if his blood was boiling. It was as if his entire body was surrounded by flames and his skin burnt by the heat.At that moment, Xiao Hong let out a nervous screech. Su Ming did not hesitate and rushed forward, grabbing the red flower closest to him. There was a sharp spatula made of stone in his hand, and with practiced movements he cut the flower part from its roots, then threw it into the basket over his back.Once he was done, Su Ming did not linger and left quickly with Xiao Hong.As soon as Su Ming left, there was the sound of a roar from a beast from within the mud, and all the red flowers immediately closed their petals before sinking into the mud once more. Soon, fresh blood emerged from the mud and the stench of blood filled the air.Su Ming and Xiao Hong left in a hurry. When they sky darkened completely, they were sitting on a tree and looking through their haul using the moonlight.There were many types of herbs in the basket, a sight which made Su Ming excited. He saw the quenching scene in his mind once again, and he became even more excited to do it.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity I don\u2019t know the effects of Scattering Dust\u2026but it should be really good nonetheless.\u201d Su Ming licked his lips, casting his gaze towards two of the herbs in the basket.These two herbs were similar in color, and if he was not looking at them closely they would look exactly the same. They are both red, and the only difference between them was that one of them had six petals, and the other five petals.Su Ming was not familiar with those two herbs. They were the only ones he had never seen before in the making of Scattering Dust. It was fortunate that Xiao Hong had seen them before and could bring Su Ming to them.\u201cJust which one of them is the one necessary to make the medicine?\u201d Su Ming frowned. He swept his gaze along the two herbs. He had obtained the six petal flower from the mud. As he remembered the strange sight that had happened when it bloomed, Su Ming had a feeling that if he ate this raw, his body would explode.He placed the herb once more in the basket and laid down on the branch, then took a bite at a piece of fruit. He watched the stars in the sky and breathed in the air in the forest. He could hear the sounds of the beasts and birds around him. It was as if he had become one with the forest, and it was a comfortable feeling.Xiao Hong was grooming itself by the side while it warily surveyed their surroundings.The man and the monkey spent the night on the tree just like that.As the sun rose the next morning, Su Ming and Xiao Hong left the tree and hurried towards Black Flame Mountain as the forest was covered by darkness and surrounded by a thin veil of mist.Su Ming remained on alert as he held the bow in his hands. Xiao Hong was also affected by this and was also wary of its surroundings. When the sun rose to the sky, the snow-like mist disappeared from the forest. There was a gigantic mountain before his eyes. The mountain was brown, and he could feel waves of heat rolling off the ground onto his face.He could even see puffs of black smoke rising into the air at the very top of the mountain. It was a sight to behold from afar.\u201cBlack Flame Mountain\u2026\u201d Su Ming muttered softly, then cast a wary eye at his surroundings before rushing up the mountain with no hesitation. He was already prepared before he came. There were a lot of heat repellent herbs under his feet, and with their presence, Su Ming could climb to the top the mountain without stopping.He may be climbing really quickly, but he remained alert, and his wariness only increased as he climbed further up. He did not how long he took, but as he was halfway up the mountain, Xiao Hong let out a screech as he was about to continue upward.Su Ming immediately hid his body in one of the cracks by the side of the mountain without any hesitation as soon as he heard the screech. He planted his feet firmly on the ground and lifted the bow in his right hand as he quickly took out an arrow. It was all done within the span of a breath. Xiao Hong arrived before Su Ming, and was now pressed closely to him.Su Ming breathed slowly, his eyes cold. From where he stood, if any of the members from Black Mountain Tribe noticed him, then they would have to fight till the death.Very soon, soft voices travelled to where he stood, and there were even sounds of stones falling as they spoke.\u201cWhy are they asking us to mine stones so early in the morning? What is this for anyway?\u201d\u201cStop complaining. This is a request from the tribe leader, we just need to do it. By the way, did you hear? The elder is about to reach the next level\u2026\u201d\u201cI also heard about it from the other tribe members that the elder is different than how he is usually. He\u2019s a bit terrifying now.\u201d\u201cCould the tribe leader be asking us to mine these stones for the elder?\u201dThe voices became clearer and then gradually faded, Su Ming remained still as he stood pressed against the crack. It was not until the two people had gone further away that he let out a sigh of relief.\u201cBlack Mountain Tribe\u2019s elder is about to reach the next level\u2026 I remember the elder once saying that the elder in Black Mountain Tribe was at the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm, but he has mastered a Fallen Art just so that he could go up against the elder.\u201d Su Ming narrowed his eyes. He would have to return later to tell his elder about this.He waited for a bit longer to make sure those two had gone far away, then Su Ming continued scaling the mountain. But at that moment, the little monkey by his side grabbed his shirt.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming immediately turned his head in alarm, but he only saw the monkey\u2019s face bright with excitement, pointing towards the crack they had stayed. There was a small, naturally formed hole over there, and steam was rising from it.Su Ming immediately gave up on climbing the mountain any further and decided to approach the small hole. After careful scrutiny, he took off the basket on his back and brought it into the hole as he crawled into it, with Xiao Hong keeping close to his footsteps.The hole was not big, and Su Ming only managed to get in because he was on the smaller side. If it were any of the other members of the Berserker Tribe, they would not have been able to make it in.Translator\u2019s Notes1 earthen fire (\u5730\u706b) actually refers to lava but since the word di hu\u01d2 was used, I decided to go the \u201cwe\u2019re from ancient times and we\u2019re really superstitious, what is lava?\u201d route.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was completely even in size. When Su Ming saw the end of the hole some hundred feet later, he started slowing down.He approached the exit carefully. As he looked out, he was momentarily stunned, then he took a deep breath.This was a fire cave. There were vast amounts of stalactites hanging from the ceiling. The surface of these rocks were dry and cracked, as if they would crumble into pieces at any moment. The ground was black, but there were lines upon lines of red rocks flowing downwards, turning the place brown. The heat was even stronger in here compared to when they were outside.There was a black skeleton hanging near him. The skeleton was about eighty to ninety feet long, and Su Ming could tell with just one glance that it was the skeleton of a python.On the python\u2019s head was a horn about the size of an arm. It was black in color.Su Ming had never seen such a long python before, but he remembered hearing from his elder that there was once a species of pythons in Dark Dragon Mountain. They were fierce creatures, and these pythons all possessed horns on their heads. They were known as Horned Pythons, and the sharpness of the horn could be given to the tribe as tribute.There was one such horn in Dark Mountain Tribe, and it was treated as the symbol of the tribe leader in the tribe.\u201cCould this be the Horned Python?\u201d He looked at the Horned Python\u2019s skeleton, then at the cave he was located, and an answer formed in his head.In his silence Su Ming took out one of the herbs from the basket and threw it downwards.As the herb floated downwards and was about to touch the floor, it let out a sizzling sound. About fifteen minutes later, it withered. He tried a few more times to test the heat on the ground, and decided that while the heat was strong, he could withstand it for some time, as long as he did not touch the red stones.Xiao Hong was already growing impatient. If it did not know the dangers of this place, it would have jumped down much earlier.Su Ming climbed out of the hole carefully, then jumped downwards and landed on the floor. Immediately, there were sizzling sounds coming from underneath his feet. A wave of heat seeped into his body from his feet, but it would not be strong enough to burn his feet for the time being.When Xiao Hong entered the fire cave, sweat poured down its body like a river. It pondered for a while before returning once more to the small hole, refusing to go back into the fire cave. Instead, it chose to go somewhere else to play.Su Ming did not continue trying to persuade it, but chose to carry the basket on his back and hurry onward. He could tell that this was connected to the inner parts of Black Flame Mountain, and there just might be a suitable place to perform the quenching of herbs later.Not far down the road was an empty space. Su Ming did not know where it was connected to. There were a few potholes on the ground, and the heat was even stronger over there. Su Ming could even feel a scalding heat underneath his feet.He was just about to step on the empty space after a brief moment of hesitation when he felt a strong wave of heat bursting forth. Su Ming let out a yelp and immediately retreated, his pupils dilating in fear. He saw a blast of fire the size of an arm rushing forth from one of the potholes, lighting up the cave instantly.Su Ming took in a deep breath and retreated once more until he reached the mouth of the cave. Then he cast his gaze forward. About half an hour passed before the fire gradually disappeared. But no sooner than it did, another blast of fire emerged from another pothole.As soon as it disappeared, another blast of fire came out once more. It was an endless cycle.\u201cFire\u2026\u201d Su Ming stared at the potholes, then his eyes gradually lit up in excitement.\u201cThere is fire here! But they will appear only once in a while, and it\u2019s not a stable source of fire either\u2026\u201d Once the excitement faded, Su Ming took a moment to gather to gather his thoughts, feeling a little disappointed.\u201cNo matter. I might be able to reach the deepest parts of the mountain through the peak of the mountain, and I might even find a better place which might be hidden here. If there\u2019s any danger, I can leave quickly as well.\u201d\u201cVery well, this will be my very first place to perform the quenching of herbs!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bright with excitement as he looked around.\u201cI have fire now, so the only thing I\u2019m missing now is the Barren Caldron\u2026I\u2019ll make one myself!\u201d Su Ming then cast his gaze on the scattered rocks on the ground.These stones have been here for many years, but have not turned into ashes. They must be able to withstand a great amount of heat, so they should be able to be used for quenching\u2026\u201d Su Ming scratched his head then changed the herbs underneath his feet before jumping down once more. He chose a more suitable looking piece of stone, then touched the surface after a brief moment of hesitation. It was not too hot, just a bit warm.Once he was certain of using the big stone as a material, Su Ming took out his own spatula. The spatula was extremely sharp and had been constantly polished by Su Ming himself. As he took up the spatula, he used every ounce of his strength and started cutting into the stone.It was an extremely dull process, but one Su Ming was already used to. There was no hesitation within his movements, but as he was cutting into the stone, a thought suddenly crossed his mind. He looked at the skull of the python, and especially at the horn on its skull.Su Ming went over quickly and looked at the skull for a moment. He gave a light knock at the skull, and when he did, there was a cracking sound, and the entire skeleton immediately turned into ashes.Only the black horn remained unscathed.\u201cI knew it. This horn is extraordinary. I was just wondering how the python came to this place.\u201d Su Ming picked up the horn and sliced it across the wall to his side. There was a crack following his motion, but the scene did not surprise Su Ming.\u201cBut why did the Horned Python climb into this place?\u201d Su Ming did not understand, but he still took up the horn and went to the rock and started cutting into it.With the help of the horn, after a few hours, a stone stove that was almost similar to the Barren Caldron in Su Ming\u2019s memories was born. Su Ming even made a lid for it to keep the heat from escaping from within the caldron.\u201cLet\u2019s try it out first.\u201d Su Ming was excited. He pushed the Barren Caldron to the potholes and forced himself to calm down as he waited.After a few hours, after numerous blasts of fire, fire finally emerged from the pothole near Su Ming.As soon as the fire erupted, Su Ming pushed the stone stove right on top of the erupting pothole.Su Ming was nervous. It all depended on whether the caldron he made could withstand the heat now.Very soon, the caldron became red and heat rolled off from its surface. There were even sizzling sounds, and Su Ming saw the surface of the caldron cracking in multiple times. Su Ming felt his heart still, but when there were no signs of the stone crumbling, he gradually began to relax.\u201cTwo hours\u2026 There is only two hours each time. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough.\u201d Su Ming sank into his own thoughts. It can even be said that he was truly spending all his effort to make sure this quenching process would work.\u201cThen how about this?\u201d Su Ming took a few steps back. He may have a plan in his head, but he did not dare act recklessly. Instead, he stood at a place that was not too hot and focused on those potholes. A day passed by while he was doing that.During that period of time, the little monkey dropped by and left some fruits on a place that was not too hot before leaving once more to play.As for the stone caldron, it withstood the test of fire and did not crumble no matter how many times it was burned.\u201cThere seems to be some sort of pattern for the eruptions, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any patterns either\u2026\u201d After a day, Su Ming picked up the horn and went to the potholes, cutting a ravine on the ground, connecting one of the potholes underneath the caldron.He did not stop there, but instead make six other ravines before retreating. Very soon, one of the potholes erupted once more, and most of the flames flowed into the ravine and went underneath the caldron.\u201cI made it!\u201d Su Ming only looked at it for a moment before going off to make another five ravines, then he backed off to observe for another day. As he was sure his method worked in extending the period of time for the fire underneath his caldron, he became relaxed.To tell the truth, he was worried about it. The lines of the ravines were not drawn on a whim. He had to make sure that the flames underneath the caldron were not too strong or too weak, or else the pills would come out misshapened.After all, there were times when several potholes erupted at once. If this happened multiple times, then it might be dangerous.Once he solved two of the most basic of his problems, Su Ming calmed down and began his very first quenching process according to the memories in his head.He had the little monkey preparing his meals for him, and there were times when Su Ming went out to hunt some smaller prey before bringing them into the cave to roast it. Su Ming also used the chance to tell the hunting team from his own tribe about the elder in Black Mountain Tribe as he met them by chance while he was out hunting.Time passed by, and sounds of frustrations could be heard from this place that he claimed as his own for the purposes of quenching. Half a month had passed by. Su Ming\u2019s eyes had turned red by this point. For the entirety of the half a month he spent, for all the numerous times he tried refining the herbs he had, there was not once where he was successful!He was now at the first level in the Blood Solidification Realm, and he even manifested four blood veins. If only he could manifest two more, then he would reach the second level in the Blood Solidification Realm.Once he reached the second level, then Su Ming would be able to use the first of the Berserker Arts which he inherited from the statue of the God of Berserkers!This was a dream for Su Ming, and also the reason why he did not give up on trying to create the medicinal pills.But after a month\u2019s worth of failures, Su Ming was at the verge of giving up. But his obstinacy did not allow him to give up so easily.\u201cI won\u2019t believe it! Xiao Hong, collect herbs for me again!\u201d Su Ming threw the basket towards the little monkey baring its teeth at the mouth of the cave, then continued trying to create the pills.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe little monkey caught the basket and grinned before running out.Days passed\u2026But there were only failures upon failures\u2026Another half a month passed by. During this day, as Su Ming stood in front of the caldron with his hair in a mess, he held two herbs in his hands. They were both red in color. One of them had six petals, and the other five petals.\u201cWhich one should I use\u2026\u201d Su Ming knew he did not have much time to think, so he grit his teeth and made his decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was the one that gave off a scent that seemed to make blood boil.The moment the herb touched the medicinal concoction in the caldron, Su Ming saw a red, alluring light from within it. He did not cover the caldron with a lid, but chose to step forward and walk around the caldron. He selected a few of the ravines that still had the liquid fire flowing down like a stream and jammed the horn horizontally in their paths to stop the flow temporarily, making it easier for him to control the fire.The ravines on the ground have increased since a month ago, and most of them were covered in horizontal marks that looked like scars. This was a method Su Ming invented to control the fire after a month of trial and error.Su Ming was incredibly nervous. Almost all of his attention was on the Barren Caldron he made. According to his observations in the past month, the place he was standing was safe for the next hour, so he did not need to care about anything else.Time passed by, and as soon as the hour was up, Su Ming immediately retreated from the place. Not long after he left the place, a huge blast of fire erupted from the ground.As the fire continued bursting forth, Su Ming was also sweating like a river as he stood not too far away from the source of the fire. But he kept his gaze on the caldron. From the experience he had accumulated a month ago, he knew that there was still fourteen to eighteen hours left before he could see the results.During this time, he would need to adjust the strength of the flames according to the changes with the medicinal concoction, and he especially needed to put the lid on the caldron at the final moments of making the medicine pills so that the heat within the caldron will increase to incredible levels and the heat will gather to create the medicinal pills.He had been repeating this act numerous times in the past month. It could even be said that he was already used to it by now.Two hours, four hours passed by. Slowly, the caldron started letting out a red mist. The mist had no smell, but as the strange light shone, it made Su Ming\u2019s blood boil when he looked at it.During this time, he adjusted the strength of the fire a few times, and he did so until it turned dark outside. Su Ming\u2019s eyes were red and bloodshot. He had used almost the entire day on creating the medicinal pills, and if everything had been working well so far, then there was only one final step left.Through the red mist, Su Ming could see that there was not much liquid left within the caldron, and it was bubbling inside. When each bubble burst, the red mist would rise from within.\u201cIt\u2019s almost done!\u201d After numerous failures, Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up. Without any hesitation, he grabbed the lid by his side and covered the caldron.The moment he closed the caldron, a low rumbling sound could be heard echoing within the cave.\u201cIt all depends on luck now.\u201d Once he covered the caldron, Su Ming let out a huge breath and retreated a few steps before sitting down with his legs crossed. He closed his eyes and rested. He knew that he had done everything that he could, and success depended entirely on luck now.Two hours went by. The roaring sound from within the caldron increased exponentially and continued nine times before it gradually became quiet. There was no longer any sound beside the fire underneath the caldron.Su Ming did not open his eyes but chose instead to continue resting and wait. It was not until when the next eruption was about to start after a short period of time and when the fire underneath the caldron began growing weaker that Su Ming opened his eyes and grabbed some heat resistant herbs in his right hand before moving forward and pushing the lid on the caldron away.The moment the lid was opened, a red wave of heat rushed into his face, but Su Ming was already prepared. The instant he opened the lid, he moved backwards.He waited until the red wave of heat dispersed, then with his heart beating in trepidation and excitement, he moved forward slowly and looked into the caldron.With just a glance, Su Ming began laughing loudly.Right at the very bottom of the caldron were three red medicinal pills!He retrieved the pills carefully, then sat by the side in excitement as he kept looking at the very mysterious object he had only seen in his memories.Su Ming loved the little round pills, and he even brought them to his nose to smell them. But instead of a medicinal scent, they emitted a faint stench of blood.The pill was also abnormally fragile. If Su Ming used a bit more strength, the pills would crumble into dust, but Su Ming did not care much about that.\u201cOne month has gone by, and I\u2019ve finally managed to make it once!\u201d The more Su Ming looked at it, the happier he was, and as he was about to pop one into his mouth, he hesitated.Su Ming forcefully quelled his excitement. In his mind, he saw the odd scene when he was picking the red herb with six petals.\u201cIf this herb was the key to creating these pills, then I wonder whether the other one can do it as well\u2026\u201d Su Ming placed the three pills at a safe location, then took out the red herb with five petals.There was a moment of silence before Su Ming made up his mind. Once he took note of the time, he closed his eyes and meditated, he started moving the blood in his veins all over his body to recover from fatigue.The little monkey returned at midnight, and as it climbed into the cave its face was seemingly intoxicated as it sniffed its right claw. It did not bother Su Ming, but chose to lie down in a place that was not too hot.It had already gotten used to this place over the past month.Yet even though it was lying down, it still kept sniffing at its right claw, and the intoxicated look became more visible on its face. It started cackling as it remembered something.It was not until the next morning before Su Ming opened his eyes and moved his body. The fatigue he felt on the previous day was completely gone.With his stamina recovered and his body was almost overflowing with it, Su Ming took the herb with five petals and continued with the quenching process.After a few days, Su Ming stepped out of the fire cavern, since he had not left for quite a few days. When he saw the sun, he felt its glare on his eyes. He was already used to the red glare of the fires within the fire cave, and now that he looked once more at the brightness from the sun, he was a little unused to it.As he stood there breathing in fresh air, Su Ming waited for his eyes to adjust to the brightness of the sun, then carefully surveyed his surroundings before climbing down.He was quick as he did so, and he remained alert of his surroundings. With the little monkey keeping watch as well, they did not encounter any dangers and made it down the mountain safely.They found a river that let out hot steam at the feet of the mountain. Su Ming took off his clothes and soaked himself in the water, feeling the fatigue that had accumulated in his body disappearing.He and Xiao Hong hurriedly left the river reluctantly. He had much more important things to do.Su Ming and Xiao Hong travelled with blinding speed in the forest. After covering some distance, Su Ming caught some terrifying looking beasts in his hands.There were also some in the little monkey\u2019s claws.At a slightly more remote corner in the forest, Su Ming took a glance at the four tied-up beasts roaring at him, then ignored them and took out two small bottles from his bosom.Within the two bottles were two types of pills. One of them was red and slightly terrifying to look at, while the other was green with a faint medicinal smell travelling to his nostrils. With just a whiff, he felt refreshed.The green pill was the one Su Ming made a few days ago using the herb with five petals.\u201cScattering Dust\u2026 If I follow my instincts, the green one is Scattering Dust, then what on earth is the red pill?\u201d Su Ming narrowed his eyes. There were three pills each in the bottles. He took one of each out and looked at the beasts before moving towards them.Once he fed the two pills to two different beasts, Su Ming retreated a few steps back and observed them nervously. Even the little monkey was affected by his mood and grew nervous.He waited for a long time, but there were no changes within the two beasts that consumed the pills. They were still hissing and roaring at Su Ming, their faces contorted in rage.Su Ming frowned. He waited for a bit longer, but nothing happened.\u201cHow could this be? Logically speaking, something must have happened\u2026 But at least it\u2019s not poisonous. Could it be\u2026 this isn\u2019t to be consumed, but to be used externally?\u201d Once Su Ming got the idea, he took out the horn and went to the other two beasts that did not take the medicine, then cut open two small wounds on their bodies so that blood flowed out.The little monkey quickly followed behind him to watch.Su Ming then took another two pills from the bottle and placed it on their wounds.At that moment, something happened!The moment the red pill touched the wound on the creature\u2019s body, within just a few seconds, its entire body started trembling furiously and it turned into a pool of blood. Before the blood could even fall onto the ground, it burst into flames and turned into red mist. The little beast did not even have time to scream.All of this happened in an instant, and it happened so quickly Su Ming let out a cry of alarm before retreating quickly. The little monkey was also shocked and let out whimpers of alarm as it retreated hastily.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d Su Ming took in a sharp breath and his eyes were filled with terror. He did not expect that the red pill he made would have such shocking effects!When the red mist disappeared in the air, there was only a pile of purplish red bones left on the ground. It was a terrifying sight to behold. While the other creatures were very close to the beast just now, they were not affected, but it was clear that they were frightened by it.Su Ming\u2019s breathing was erratic and quick. After a long while, he looked at the bottle containing the red pill. There was only one left, but that pill alone was enough to make him think that it was a bloodthirsty item.\u201cThere are no effects if it was consumed, but if it comes into contact with blood, then death is assured! Since I was the one who made this, then it will be named Scattering Blood!\u201d Su Ming murmured. He forced his fears to go away and put away the pill carefully. He had a feeling that this object could very well be used as a weapon in the future!\u201cThen this green pill should be the real Scattering Dust. Just what are its effects though?\u201d Su Ming fell momentarily silent, then his gaze fell upon the little beast that was still completely fine even though the pill had melted into its wound.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the memories he obtained, he only acquired the methods to make the pills, not their effects.Su Ming only left the place with the slightest bit of hesitation when the sun was at its highest in the sky.They ran back to the place where he had performed the quenching. The little monkey did not stay long. It ran outside as soon as it came back to the cave.Su Ming felt the breeze on his skin as he leaned against the wall of the mountain. In his hands were the green pills and he began thinking as he held them in his hand.\u2018Just what is its use\u2026? Neither consuming the pill nor applying it externally worked\u2026\u2019He frowned. He finally managed to make the pills but he could not determine their effects. It made Su Ming feel as if the past month had been a waste.He stared at the pills and made his decision.\u2018I\u2019ll just have to try it on my own! Let\u2019s see what happens once I swallow it!\u2019Su Ming was the decisive sort. Once he made a decision, he never hesitated. He quickly placed the Scattering Dust pill in his hand into his mouth.The pill immediately melted once it touched his tongue. A strong medicinal taste filled his mouth and turned into a strong wave of heat that flowed into all parts of his body. It disappeared soon however, and Su Ming did not feel much from it.Su Ming was stunned. He sat down hurriedly and meditated, trying to solidify the blood in his veins. However, it was to no avail. It was no different than before. He still felt that there was not enough blood in his body.He pulled at his hair, frustrated. This was the first time he truly felt that he had wasted the past month.\u2018Impossible, there must be some other use for it!\u2019Su Ming was disappointed but he did not give up. Yet, no matter how much he pondered about it, he could not find any clues. The only thing he could do was sigh and laugh bitterly.After a while, the little monkey returned and approached Su Ming. It jumped around for a while before throwing some fruits in front of him, then leaving once more.Su Ming sighed. He was hungry, so he picked up one of the fruits and began thinking as he ate.\u2018One, two, three\u2026\u2019Before he knew it, Su Ming let out a burp and spat out the core. He stroked his belly and started thinking again. His gaze traveled to the fruits left on the ground and just as he was about to look away, it struck him.\u2018I\u2019m full?! What?!\u2019Su Ming stared at the fruits and immediately began counting the cores he spat on the ground. There were 15 in total.He felt that he had just come across something important. His heart pounded in excitement.\u2018I\u2019ve always loved eating this fruit and Xiao Hong has always picked them for me\u2026but I don\u2019t like eating too much of it in one go. At the same time, I\u2019m usually only half full even after eating 10 of them\u2026 But just now, I only ate 15 of them and I\u2019m already full! Is it because my appetite has decreased? Or perhaps\u2026it has something to do with this!\u2019Su Ming licked his lips. He remembered that he had taken a Scattering Dust pill earlier on.\u2018Perhaps Scattering Dust is actually a pill that can replace food\u2026 Or perhaps, Scattering Dust can\u2026 increase the effects of other things!\u2019Su Ming felt his heart pounding. He took a deep breath. He had been thinking carefully and exhaustively about the effects of the pill but had obtained no clues. Now that he had stumbled onto something, he was going to pursue it no matter how ridiculous it may seem. He immediately crawled back into the little hole which he used for the sole purpose of quenching herbs.He remembered that he still had a little bit of Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva left. This was a rare item. It was impossible to obtain it without rain and he had been reluctant to drink what little amount he had left.He quickly ventured into the cave. Su Ming took out the bottle that contained the few drops of Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva left from the basket. He then swallowed it all in one gulp without hesitation.Su Ming was extremely familiar with Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva. With just a few drops, he immediately felt the faint traces of coldness from the liquid traveling to all parts of his body before seeping into his blood.The cold sensation brought upon by Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva suddenly increased a little, at least by one fold. It may not seem much, but Su Ming could really feel it.As the coldness became one with his blood, it felt like his blood started to boil. It caused the four manifested blood veins to glow a bloody red as he controlled the flow of blood in his body.After a long while, Su Ming opened his eyes and let out a shaky breath. His eyes were filled with happiness and excitement.\u2018I knew it! There are no effects if Scattering Dust is taken alone, but if taken with other objects, then the effects of those objects will increase. It seems like a simple effect, but it\u2019s really quite extraordinary!\u2019Su Ming felt his spirits lift up. The process of creating Scattering Dust was now a huge motivation for him.\u2018There were 15 tiny holes on the door which gave me the methods to create Scattering Dust. It must be for me to place 15 of these pills in there, but I don\u2019t even have enough for myself now\u2026\u2019Su Ming fell silent. Then, he let out a string of murmurs slowly after a brief period of hesitation.Once he made up his mind, he immediately went to the Barren Caldron and began processing the other herbs with the quenching process.Besides processing the herbs, he also made the little monkey continue searching for the herbs his grandfather would take away in huge bundles. Then using the method in his tribe, he mashed the herbs and turned them into liquid before drinking it. With the help of Scattering Dust, his training speed grew faster.Two months had passed by. Su Ming barely left the cave during those two months. The fire cavern had practically become his second home. Since the location could not be easily discovered, Su Ming felt at ease training there.Within those two months, he had prepared a lot of Scattering Dust. With the help of the medicinal concoction which helped increase his blood rate, he gradually managed to manifest the fifth blood vein on his body.The sixth blood vein too, had begun appearing vaguely on his body. If this continued, then it would manifest very soon.Winter had already arrived outside. The other mountains were covered by snow except Black Flame Mountain. Snow would melt before it could even touch the surface of the mountain. Due to this, the mountain was surrounded by a thick layer of fog. It was a strange sight to see from afar.If an outsider saw it for the first time, the mountain would definitely pique his or her interest. Su Ming grew up there, so the strange sights of the mountain were nothing new to him.That day, Su Ming sat down with his legs crossed and the blood red glow was incredibly strong within his body. The five blood veins crawled all over his body as if they possessed life. It was a shocking sight to behold.As the blood red glow kept spreading around his body, sweat accumulated all over Su Ming\u2019s body. His body trembled but his face was filled with determination. This was his third attempt at manifesting the sixth blood vein during the past half a month. Once he managed to do it, he would successfully become a Berserker at the second level in the Blood Solidification Realm.More importantly, he would be able to use the very first Berserker Art. It was one that belonged only to their tribe; an Art known as Spirit Devourer!The Spirit Devourer was not a skill that could be used without preparation. Some fresh animal carcasses would be required. By gathering the Berserker Blood in their bodies, practitioners could sense the spirit of the deceased animal and bring it out to increase their own strength temporarily.Only after they have mastered this particular skill would they be known as a Berserker. They would then be different from the other members of the tribe. They would be much stronger.After a long while, Su Ming\u2019s body continued to tremble. The bloody glow surrounding his body gradually disappeared and the five blood veins on his skin also sank into his body once more. The solidification of the sixth blood vein had failed once again.Su Ming let out a deep breath. After a moment of silence, he mixed some medicinal concoction with Scattering Dust and drank it before continuing with his training.Another month passed by. The entire Dark Dragon Mountain was covered by a thick layer of snow. The fog surrounding Black Flame Mountain had also grown thicker. Even the heat seemed to disappear in the weather.The year\u2019s coldest season was about to arrive.However for Su Ming, this was the most important moment. His diligence in training coupled with his supply of herbs and Scattering Dust increased his training speed exponentially in the Blood Solidification Realm. The sixth blood vein had appeared and it was at a critical moment of manifestation.The little monkey also refused to go out in winter. Its entire body was red and that made it extremely eye-catching in the snow. Even if it was not winter, it would have to lay low.It squatted down beside Su Ming and yawned as it watched him. All of a sudden, the little monkey lifted its head. Its eyes were filled with a fierce glare and its ears twitched.Faint voices traveled into the cavern from the outside\u2026\u201cYu Chi, are you sure Sky Stone grows here? We\u2019ve been searching this place for half a day and we still can\u2019t find any. Are you sure you got the right information?\u201d It was a cold voice and the little monkey quivered the moment it heard it.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. I remember seeing shrubs of the plant, that\u2019s why I cast a Berserker Art to hide it. It should have fully matured by now. The other members of the tribe come here often to collect herbs. They should be able to identify my spells.\u201d The voice that answered was sharp.\u201cThen hurry up. If Sky Stone is really here, then I\u2019ll be able to break through the third level soon and reach the fourth level. As for you, you should be able to reach the third level.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be in such a hurry. It should be here. I can feel the presence of my spell\u2026 If you can reach the fourth level, then you will be able to join the Black Mountain\u2019s hunting team. I heard that the elder made a new rule that says anyone can keep their own game this time.\u201dTheir voices were getting closer and sounded like they were right outside. The little monkey was so nervous it did not dare to breathe. It could feel that the two people outside posed a serious threat.It turned back to look at Su Ming multiple times but Su Ming still had his eyes shut. His body was trembling slightly and the bloody glow on his body was becoming stronger. The sixth blood vein seemed to show signs of complete manifestation as well.Yet, at that very moment\u2026 \u201cFound it! Huh? Look, there\u2019s a small hole here!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Sky Stone! As for the hole\u2026this was once the Land of the Fire Berserker Tribe. There\u2019s hot air around the hole. It should be empty. Since we\u2019re already here, we might as well go in and have a look. It\u2019s not as if a simple hole can stop me.\u201d Their voices traveled into the cave and their words made the little monkey\u2019s face grow pale.It gritted its teeth and looked back at Su Ming for a long period of time. Then, it bared its teeth and rushed out the little hole.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euImmediately, sounds of delight could be heard from the outside.\u201cIt\u2019s a Fire Ape! And a baby at that, haha!\u201d\u201cThis must be its refuge from the cold. Catch it! Its blood can help me replenish my blood, and I\u2019ll offer its fur to the elder!\u201dMournful cries could be heard after that and then the voices gradually disappeared. However within the cave, Su Ming\u2019s face had contorted in anger and he shook furiously.\u201cYou asked\u2026for this\u2026\u201d Su Ming lifted his head and roared in rage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His entire body glowed madly with a blood red light and it lit up the entire fire cavern.His entire body kept trembling. As the blood moved around his body, his heart pounded faster and faster as if it was going to break his chest. It only served to make his face even more twisted.He was at an important moment in his training so, he was unable to stop abruptly. Nonetheless, he knew and clearly heard everything that had happened earlier.He saw with his own eyes, the little monkey running out to lure the two outsiders to protect him.Su Ming had never been that mad before. The little monkey was his only friend in the forest. Over the years, he had come to treat the little one like family. The madness within his eyes caused the veins from Su Ming\u2019s body to pop out and blazing sounds to reverberate throughout his body.The five blood veins that manifested on his body were now giving off a piercing glow. Within the red glow was the sixth blood vein which was on the verge of completely manifesting itself. It looked like it was on the verge of breaking out of its cocoon.\u201cThis damned second level!\u201d Su Ming roared. He had been gentle in his previous attempts to manifest that blood vein. Even if he was not successful, there were no serious repercussions.However, the little monkey\u2019s life was now in danger and Su Ming grew more anxious with every passing second. He gave everything he had and controlled the blood in his veins, forcing them to move in the way they should as a Berserker Practitioner. He focused all of his blood towards the sixth blood vein.There was a loud boom and Su Ming coughed up blood. His entire body trembled as his face turned pale. Such a reckless move was taboo for Berserker Practitioners. It was important for them to arrive at each new rank smoothly and steadily. They could not march forward recklessly.The booming sound was not as loud to the outside world but Su Ming felt like the world had crashed in his head. The sound kept echoing itself.\u2018Damn it!\u2019Su Ming glared at the entrance to the cave. It was as if he could still see the little monkey\u2019s helplessness, fear and resolution.There was no time for hesitation. Su Ming once again controlled the blood in his entire body and attempted to break through for the second time!More blood came out of his mouth and trickled down his chin onto the floor\u2026The third time\u2026 fourth time\u2026 fifth time!During his fifth attempt, Su Ming coughed out a huge mouthful of blood. His face became completely ashen, but on his face was also a strong intent to kill. With all that blood on his face, Su Ming looked horrifying.He immediately picked himself up and the moment he stood up, there was a loud bang within his body. The sixth blood vein had completely manifested itself.As the sixth blood vein formed completely, a totally different aura compared to the first level of the Blood Solidification Realm erupted from within Su Ming\u2019s body. There was no wind, but the aura blew his hair and the sixth blood vein moved rapidly on his skin as if it was alive!It was the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm!Without waiting for his body to get used to the second level, Su Ming ran at a speed faster than he previously could, and his speed had increased by at least one fold. He grabbed the bow and horn by his side and in a blink of an eye, he disappeared.He quickly crawled out of the small hole. When he arrived outside, it was snowing heavily and the sun was about to set. It was already dusk outside.\u2018One of them is a second level in the Blood solidification Realm\u2026the other in the third level\u2026\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and cold. No matter how strong his enemies were, Su Ming felt no fear. He only felt a strong urge to kill!He had already forgotten what fear felt like. The moment the little monkey was captured, the two Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe became his mortal enemies.Su Ming would have to be dead if they did not die by his hands!It did not matter if he was rushing into fire. It had nothing to do with recklessness. Instead, it was a matter of survival! If the fire did not cease to burn, then he would in turn be burnt to ashes.Su Ming did not hesitate. He ran forward at full speed. He was a member of the Berserker Tribe. He had been playing and collecting herbs around the mountains since he was young. He was familiar with these parts of the land and was even better at tracking for answers around the place.As he ran, he kept his eyes on the ground. He wiped the blood away from the corners of his mouth and his hands. After a while, he saw some messy-looking tracks on the dried leaves ahead. He grabbed some broken twigs and looked at them. The killing intent in his eyes grew even stronger. He threw away the twigs and changed his direction.Su Ming continued to run at full speed and maximized his body\u2019s full potential. On the way, he found a lot other traces and even a pool of blood.There were some traces of red fur in the pool of blood. It was the little monkey\u2019s!However the blood was already beginning to dry up, a clear sign that the two people caught the little monkey there and had left for quite some time.\u2018I can\u2019t catch up\u2026\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes darkened. He clenched his fists, and his eyes were filled with anger.\u2018They\u2019re from the Black Mountain Tribe, so surely they\u2019ll return to their tribe\u2026If that\u2019s the case\u2026there\u2019s still a shortcut from here to the Black Mountain Tribe!\u2019Su Ming turned around and leapt forward, lithely disappearing into the snow covered forest.\u2018Faster!\u2019Su Ming ran ahead quickly like he was flying through the forest. Yet, he still felt his speed was too slow. As he traveled, he left his footprints on the snow. Just as he was about to take another leap forward, the snow before him flew up from the ground.A small creature that looked like a fox but was entirely covered in white fur and had the horns of a deer leapt from the snow. Its speed was so quick it almost reached Su Ming in an instant.\u2018Mink raccoon!\u2019Su Ming did not slow down. When the little creature jumped out from its hiding place, he swung his right fist towards it.Previously, Su Ming\u2019s strength would not have been enough to kill a wild beast with just one punch. However, he was now a Berserker in the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm. He already had six blood veins manifested and he was controlled by an almost boundless amount of blood lust. This caused not just his speed but also his strength to increase exponentially.The punch landed squarely on the mink raccoon\u2019s body and it let out a cry. It narrowed its eyes, wanting to change its course midair but Su Ming rushed forward and cut the creature apart with the horn in his left hand. He had equipped himself with it sometime during the encounter.Fresh blood poured out of its wounds. The little creature struggled and cried in the snow. Its blood stained the snow a bloody shade of crimson.It was a clean cut. Su Ming looked at the dead mink raccoon and lowered his body. He raised his right hand as he took in a deep breath. After that, he began controlling his blood. His body emitted a red light as if it had fused together with the blood on the ground. The six blood veins manifested themselves on Su Ming\u2019s body.He placed his right hand slowly on the dead creature and a strange glow appeared in his eyes. One of the blood veins on his body began to twist around oddly as if it came to life. It crawled along his right arm to his palm and into the little creature\u2019s body.Suddenly, the dead carcass began shaking. Its fur fell off and its body began withering rapidly. Within the blink of an eye, it turned into bones. At the same moment, wisps of white mist rose from its body to create an image of its former self. But it was a vague image, like it would disappear as soon as the wind blew.This was the first time Su Ming had cast the Spirit Devourer. According to the information he obtained about the spell, he would usually need to refine the spirit first before devouring it. However Su Ming did not have the time. He opened his mouth and breathed in the spirit form of the mink raccoon.Su Ming\u2019s body trembled. He could feel that he had just obtained additional strength but it was also rapidly disappearing. It would not be long before it disappeared completely and his strength would return to normal.Su Ming did not linger. He immediately rushed forth. This time, his speed was slightly faster than before and it was increasing. He became more and more like the wind.As the wind blew past his ears, there was only one thought in Su Ming\u2019s head. He had to catch up to the other party, stop them and then save the little monkey.As for the method, he was not a reckless person to begin with so, he already had a plan.An hour later, the additional strength Su Ming obtained disappeared but it allowed him to cover more distance. He had already left Black Flame Mountain and was near the Black Mountain Tribe.He was at a small hill which looked like a slope. If he stood there, he could see quite far ahead and his peripheral vision would also increase.As he was near his destination, Su Ming\u2019s eyes became fierce. He kept his gaze on Black Flame Mountain and very soon, he saw his targets. Two figures appeared and one of them was holding onto a motionless Xiao Hong!Su Ming stood there and took out a small bottle with his right hand. There was a red pill within the bottle. Once he made sure there was no fresh blood on his hands, Su Ming took the pill out and held it in his hand.The pill was his trump card!He stabilized his breathing and took out his bow. His eyes were calm, almost like dead water. The two people were approaching him, with only a few miles between them. They would have seen him if they paid attention.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe two people were big and burly. They looked strong. The man holding onto the little monkey was only wearing a thin piece of hide even though it was winter. His upper body was bare. There was white mist coming off his body as if he was dispersing the cold with the energy emitted from his blood.Su Ming only cast him a glance before focusing on the other person. He was also big in build with several long spears slung over his back. He was slightly shorter than his companion. However, Su Ming could feel that his Qi was much stronger than his companion and much stronger than his own.This person was powerful.Su Ming narrowed his eyes and lifted his bow before pointing it towards the second man.Just as Su Ming looked at the person, the man also saw Su Ming.

Judging by his Qi, he should only be at the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm\u2026It\u2019ll be easy to kill him! We\u2019re also near the tribe and we\u2019re going up two against one. There\u2019s no need for us to be afraid of him. Nevertheless, since this person has come to challenge us, he must have some tricks up his sleeve. But with my power as a third level Berserker, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d The slightly shorter third level Berserker from the Black Mountain Tribe smiled fiercely. He was not at all worried about Su Ming. In his view, the difference between them was too big. Su Ming was also frail looking, so he did not look as if he posed a threat.More importantly, besides the Wind Stream Tribe, if any of the Black Mountain Tribe members saw a person from another tribe wandering around alone, they would definitely kill the person without mercy. There was no room for negotiation. This was a world where the strong preyed on the weak.If Xiao Hong had not ventured out to lure them away, they would have entered the cave, killed Su Ming and taken his head back to the tribe for rewards.\u201cYu Chi, I\u2019ll kill him. Wait here.\u201d As he spoke, the big man leapt forward like a tiger, closing the gap between him and Su Ming in just a few breaths.Yu Chi, the man holding onto the little monkey, did not object. He knew that if he killed a Berserker from another tribe and brought his head back to the tribe, he would receive rewards. However, he did not dare snatch away his companion\u2019s achievements.\u2018It\u2019s fine. That man is also at the second level like me. If we fight, then we\u2019ll be wasting some time. If he goes, then he\u2019ll definitely be able to kill him. Maybe I\u2019ll even get to share some of his rewards.\u2019 To Yu Chi, this was a meaningless battle. His eyes were filled with a cruel anticipation, as if he could see what would happen next. He was getting excited by the prospect of spilling blood.The third level Berserker who was getting nearer to Su Ming also had a similar thought. He jumped forward and quickly closed the distance. Very soon, there was not even 1,000 feet between them.800 feet, 700 feet, and then 600 feet!As he got closer, the man saw Su Ming\u2019s face clearly. He let out a roar as he grinned fiercely. His roar alone caused the snow around him to quake and toss into the air. They exploded in a loud bang, creating a layer of white mist which blinded their sights.At that moment, the man grabbed a long spear from his back with his right hand. He threw it with all his strength at Su Ming, who was standing more than 600 feet away from him.A sharp and piercing sound sliced through the air. Su Ming felt a sharp and fierce aura coming straight at him. Without thinking, he stepped aside and a whistling sound whipped by his ear. The long spear flew past and just missed him by a hair\u2019s breadth.The man did not approach to check his kill once he threw the spear. Instead, dark wisps of air surrounded his legs, increasing his traveling speed instantly by a dozen fold. Very soon the distance between them was cut down from 600 feet to 300 feet.\u201cDie!\u201d The man raised his right hand and took out a second spear. Just as he was about to throw it, the mist created by snow scattered. This allowed some of Su Ming\u2019s field of vision to return. As it did, an arrow pierced through the snow and rushed towards the man like a flash of lightning.The man laughed. He raised the spear in his right hand and knocked down the arrow easily. With a crash, the arrow broke into pieces. However at the same time, whistling sounds whipped through the air again and another three arrows came straight towards him.The arrows were too quick and the angle at which they traveled made it extremely difficult to dodge. It was becoming problematic for him. It made the man frown, but he still scoffed at them and let out a huge blast of dark air underneath his feet. It quickly surrounded his entire body like mist. As the three arrows approached him, they melted into a pool of black water when they touched the black mist.Even so, much of the black mist had dispersed, causing the man\u2019s body to be exposed.\u201cYou\u2019re only at the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm and you dare oppose me?\u201d The man took a leap and the distance between them had shortened again, and this time, to 200 feet.Su Ming\u2019s face was pale but he held his ground. There were no traces of anxiety within his eyes, just the same chilling calmness.He took out a few more arrows and fired them rapidly at the man. Once, twice, thrice and with incredible speed, he fired five arrows in succession!The five arrows practically formed a straight line and the whistling sound they caused as they sliced through the air made it seem as if they had a lot of power. They reached the man almost immediately. When he saw it, he frowned slightly. In their tribe, there were few who could use bows like that.\u201cThe Five Connected!\u201d The man raised the spear in his right hand and swung it against the first arrow. There was a loud crash and the spear broke along with the first arrow.The second arrow followed quickly. The man let out a low growl and made the black mist surround his body, causing the second arrow to melt as they touched it.The third arrow approached like lightning but the man dodged it by stepping aside. He was quickly chased by the fourth arrow. The man growled and clenched his right fist with a fierce expression. Then he swung it at the arrow. As the arrow broke, a wound appeared on his right hand.At that moment, the fifth arrow followed closely like a shadow. The man wanted to dodge it but the arrow managed to leave behind a wound on his shoulder as it whistled by him. Fresh blood immediately poured out of his wound.\u201cI will tear your head off from your shoulders!\u201d The man was not seriously wounded. He only had small wounds and they were considered inconsequential to the members of the Berserker Tribe. However to the man, it was different. He grinned fiercely and traveled another 100 feet closer to Su Ming.He was already victorious. This was a battle that posed no danger to him. He was at most only slightly bothered by the arrows.As for Yu Chi, he licked his lips from where he stood. He loved watching such bloody scenes. They served to make him feel excited.Just as the man was about to take another step, Su Ming approached him. His face was pale but his eyes were still cold and calm. He then did something that momentarily shocked the man and Yu Chi.He gave up on using his bow and arrow but chose instead to use his fists to face the man.No one realized that within Su Ming\u2019s right hand was the powder of the red pill that he had crushed!\u201cYou asked for it!\u201d The man continued closing their distance and within the blink of an eye, they were only dozens of feet away from each other. Then it turned into thirty feet, twenty feet and ten feet\u2026The man gathered all the power of his Qi in his right fist and swung it against Su Ming\u2019s head. If he had hit it, Su Ming would have undoubtedly died.But right at that moment, Su Ming lifted his head. The coldness in his eyes was gone and it was replaced with a terrifying killing intent. The strong desire to kill even stunned the man.It was already too late. Just as Su Ming lifted his head, he swung his right hand at the man and as he did so, the red powder spread in the air. Some of them landed on the man\u2019s wound on his right fist while some landed on his shoulder wound.The man trembled slightly but there were no blood curdling screams, no struggles. Right before Su Ming\u2019s eyes, he turned into red mist and disappeared into thin air. It was as if was he was boiled alive and erased by the laws of nature. A pile of bones without any flesh were all that was left on the ground. When the wind blew pass, they crumbled into dust.Among the bone fragments was a strange herb that was black and white in color. It emitted a soft and dim glow.The sudden turn of events stunned Yu Chi, who was standing nearby. He could not accept it. He could not even believe what he just saw. His gaze was empty due to the shock. Then, he saw the fragile looking boy turn and look at him with cold eyes and an equally cold countenance. He watched as the boy sped towards him.\u201cThe Fire Ape\u2019s carcass will be a great supplement. I want it!\u201d Su Ming suddenly said as he approached Yu Chi.Yu Chi shivered. As he snapped out of his stupor, he found that he was drenched in cold sweat. Su Ming\u2019s words also made him realize that he had forgotten to use the monkey as a hostage. He concluded that Su Ming came just to snatch the monkey away.The moment the idea struck him, he immediately escaped. He still could not fathom how and why his companion died. The chilling sight of his death made him so terrified, he could not accept it.\u201cYou\u2019re Fallen! You\u2019re a Fallen Berserker!\u201d Yu Chi screeched as his face turned pale. He was completely overcome by terror. He could not accept it. He was so terrified that his legs were shaking. He did not dare to face Su Ming and thus, used up every ounce of his strength to escape. Su Ming was blocking the way back to the Black Mountain Tribe so, Yu Chi could not go back. He could only run towards Black Flame Mountain.Su Ming was about to give chase when he was suddenly hit by a wave of dizziness. He felt like he was completely drained. He shook his head and forced himself to concentrate.He cast a glance at the pile of bones on the ground. This was the first time he had killed someone but it was not the time for hesitation. He had no choice but to give chase. He quickly cleaned up the place and picked up whatever usable arrows were left. After that, he took away the strange looking herb from the pile of bones. Su Ming gazed at the direction Yu Chi ran off to, and his eyes filled with killing intent once more.\u2018Xiao Hong is still in his hands. I\u2019ve already killed one of them. So, I might as well kill the other then the land which I used for quenching will never be found!\u2019Su Ming gritted his teeth to bear with the fatigue and chased after him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe two of them ran into the forest. Yu Chi did not even dare look back to see Su Ming. He chose instead to concentrate on fleeing, trying to widen the distance between them. Despite this, if they were to compare their level of familiarity with Dark Dragon Mountain, he could not compare with Su Ming.Besides, his speed was also still inferior to Su Ming\u2019s. He may have had a head start, but very soon Su Ming started to catch up to him with all the tracks he left behind.Su Ming gritted his teeth to bear with the fatigue. He kept his gaze focused on the man from the Black Mountain Tribe. He knew that the man was scared by his actions. That was why he did not dare engage in battle. It was all part of Su Ming\u2019s plans.With the Scattering Blood, he could kill a person in the blink of an eye and also stun others who saw it. After all, it was something that most people had never seen before. As such, it would terrify them.Su Ming did not chase after him too closely. However, he was constantly blocked by some obstacles along the way, causing the gap to widen every time he was just about to catch up and pounce on the man. Not long after, the obstacles started to make Su Ming hesitate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The elder had a lot of scrolls in his house and Su Ming had read almost all of them. There was a lot of knowledge there and he always wanted more.The wisdom left behind by his ancestors had made their way into Su Ming\u2019s head gradually as time passed by. However, they never had a chance to shine. As Su Ming was in pursuit of someone\u2019s life, the little bits of wisdom that had been residing in his head began to surface.Yu Chi was feeling extremely anxious. He originally thought that he could not escape and had made up his mind to give it his all in an attack of desperation. Yet right before his eyes, he saw the distance between them increasing. Then just as he thought he could escape, the distance between them closed once more and this process kept repeating itself.After this happened a few times, he no longer had any desire to give it his all for a fight to the death. It was hard for him to get into that state of mind anymore.However in Su Ming\u2019s eyes, the Berserker from the Black Mountain Tribe was just a prey, and a terrified prey at that. As soon as he started feeling the slightest bit of hope, he could slowly tear him apart.Su Ming used this method to wear down Yu Chi\u2019s confidence and courage. As the pursuit continued, he would widen the gap and let the other man have the illusion of safety.Su Ming vaguely remembered one of the scrolls saying that once the prey went through a long period of time switching between the state of anxiety and relaxation, its fatigue and suffering would increase exponentially. That sort of torture was enough to destroy one\u2019s soul.Su Ming only understood the logic behind it the last time but when he was giving chase, he slowly began to fully comprehend. The knowledge he had obtained slowly became instincts. He did not even need to do it on purpose, his body moved on its own and brought him the results that he wanted.That day marked the first time Su Ming killed someone and the first time he hunted a human for the purpose of killing him. It was the first time in his life that he was experiencing a change in his personality. Yu Chi on the other hand was the only person who would experience the process of Su Ming change.Yu Chi could feel it clearly but he did not know what caused the change. He only felt his confidence and courage diminishing after the strange scene of his companion\u2019s death, They were gradually worn down bit by bit during the chase.In fact, at one point, he no longer had the urge to turn his head back anymore. Although Su Ming was a second level Berserker in the Blood Solidification Realm just like him, he had the feeling that once he turned back he would surely die. If he continued fleeing, he felt that he would have a chance of surviving.He was so afraid that he did not feel his exhaustion building up. This was especially so when he discovered that the young man had disappeared at some point when the distance between them kept increasing. The exhaustion almost made him sink into his knees when he finally realized but he could not rest. He chose instead to grit his teeth and persevere.Unfortunately, this did not last long. When he saw Su Ming\u2019s silhouette appear at the corner of his eye again, the exhaustion he felt immediately increased by tenfold. It almost drove Yu Chi mad.\u201cHe\u2019s a Fallen Berserker! He\u2019s definitely a Fallen Berserker!\u201d Yu Chi felt himself trembling in fear. As he was escaping, he came to a junction. If he turned left, he would have gone into the deeper parts of the forest and left Black Flame Mountain. If he turned right, he would have gone around Black Flame Mountain and gone back to the Black Mountain Tribe.Su Ming had known about that junction for a long time. He narrowed his eyes and ignored his own fatigue. He focused all of his energy to his feet, increasing his speed by one explosive burst. He did not give chase, choosing instead to cut through the forest and approach the right turning at the junction.It was clear that he had predicted Yu Chi\u2019s choice to travel right. That was why he chose to turn right and close the distance between them. As he rushed forward, Su Ming brought out his bow and shot a few arrows at the direction of the right turning. As the arrows whistled through the air, all of them hit the trees on the right path. The arrowheads buried their way into the stumps and their fletchings even hummed as they vibrated in the air.The humming sound seemed to possess some sort of strange force. As the sound traveled into Yu Chi\u2019s ears, he hesitated.Su Ming pursued Yu Chi at full speed once more and attacked with his bow again. Yu Chi let out a hysterical cry and was about to turn right when Su Ming suddenly increased his speed, giving Yu Chi a false impression.He had a feeling that if he ran to the right, Su Ming would most definitely catch up to him. If he escaped to the left, he would then be able to widen the distance between them because Su Ming made the wrong decision.He could still hear the humming sound from the arrows. Yu Chi gritted his teeth and changed his direction, turning left instead. Very soon, he disappeared into the forest.A frightening look crossed Su Ming\u2019s eyes amid the fatigue and his lips curled up in a cold smile.Quickly, he pulled out the arrows from the trees and continued pursuing the man from the Black Mountain Tribe.\u201cIf you can control the direction of your enemy\u2019s escape, then you can control his body,\u201d Su Ming murmured. He remembered reading these words somewhere in one of the beast skin scrolls. He was not able to understand them before but now he understood what they meant.As he gave chase, time passed by slowly. Very soon, night came and the moon rose up high in the sky. As the moonlight touched the snow on the ground, it reflected a white light which illuminated the forest in a silvery gleam even though it was night time.During the chase, Su Ming had already changed Yu Chi\u2019s course of escape three times, gradually controlling the other man\u2019s body to run in the direction he wanted.He touched the unconscious little monkey lying against his bosom, a gentle expression appearing in his tired and bloodshot eyes. Yu Chi had thrown the little monkey away in the opposite direction during the first time Su Ming forced him to change his course. However because of that, the distance between them increased.Throwing away the little monkey had worked out for Yu Chi. Su Ming immediately ran towards the little monkey, causing Yu Chi to let out a sigh of relief and his speed increased.In spite of that, it did not last long. Soon after, Yu Chi noticed arrows upon arrows whistling by his side, all coming from behind. This again almost drove Yu Chi mad.The stars in the sky shone brightly like eyes that were looking at the chase in the forest.Yu Chi was already exhausted. His footsteps faltered but what he felt physically was inconsequential. What mattered most was his mental state. It was already broken. He regretted it. He regretted discovering the little hole. He regretted chasing after the Fire Ape. All of this would not have happened if he had not done any of it.Before him, there was a forest filled with a variety of plants. Even though it was winter, he still could not see into the deeper parts of the forest. When Yu Chi was still hesitating and contemplating on going into the forest, Su Ming\u2019s silhouette appeared at the edge of the forest.He stood there, breathing heavily. Huge amounts of white mist flowed out from his mouth and his eyes were laden with steely coldness. He did not immediately give chase but chose to wait.\u201cThis place will be the burial ground I give you! If you can step out of here alive even with such exhaustion, you can count yourself extremely lucky!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s muttered once his breathing began to even out.Just as he finished speaking, a terrifying cry traveled across the forest in the quiet of the night. The cry echoed in the forest, causing a shiver to travel down the spines of all who heard it.After a while, the cry gradually grew weaker before finally turning into a faint moan.Su Ming walked towards the direction of the voice in solemn silence. He walked into the forest slowly with each step carefully calculated. Every time he took a few steps forward, he would look around before choosing to either retreat, go around a certain place or leap forward.It was the hunting spot for the Dark Mountain Tribe. That area of the forest was filled with traps and the locations of the traps were unknown to all except the members of the Dark Mountain Tribe.Even Su Ming only knew the locations of most of the traps, not all of them.If Yu Chi had been in perfect condition when he went in, he might have been able to get out alive. However due to the condition he was in, he sealed his fate once he stepped into the place. It was the same as stepping into his own death trap.Su Ming walked forward carefully. The moans gradually became weaker as they traveled to his ears. As Su Ming walked forward slowly, he saw that Yu Chi was impaled to a tree by a line of sharpened, and thick wooden spikes, the size of adult men.His entire body was drenched in his own blood but he was not dead yet. He was still shivering and moaning weakly.Su Ming stepped forward quietly and once he was by Yu Chi\u2019s side, he looked at him. After a long while, he took out his horn and sliced Yu Chi\u2019s throat.Yu Chi struggled furiously for a few moments before breathing his last. Before his eyes lost their life, they were focused on Su Ming and filled with hatred.Su Ming was silent. He cut through the trap\u2019s ropes and took away whatever remained on Yu Chi\u2019s corpse. He brought out the small amount of Scattering Blood powder he had left and turned the corpse into a pile of bones. He then turned it into dust by touching it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe turned around silently and walked out of the forest. Once he was out, he looked at the moon in the sky with uncertainty in his gaze. It was the second time he killed someone. He could not describe how he felt. There was nervousness, fear, uncertainty\u2026After a long while, he let out a sigh. The Black Mountain Tribe was from the same denomination as the Dark Mountain Tribe but after so many years, they had turned into mortal enemies. If one of the tribes became stronger, the other would have been faced with the threat of being massacred. All of the men would have been killed and the women would have been taken away to help with the reproduction of the tribe.It was good thing that this had not happened. For many years, the elders of both tribes had been on the same level. They would not easily incite war.He took a deep breath. Fatigue took over Su Ming\u2019s entire body. He gritted his teeth and dragged his exhausted body far, far away\u2026When dawn arrived and the sun rose, Su Ming returned to the place he used for the quenching of herbs in Black Flame Mountain. His face was a sickly yellow. He crawled into the cave, and once he was inside, he fell to the side and fainted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The voice remained in his head for a long time. His unconscious body trembled lightly as if he was struggling.\u201cBrother, I\u2019m waiting for you\u2026\u201dAs the calls grew stronger, Su Ming was jolted awake from his sleep. His gaze was unfocused as he stared at the wall before him and let his mind wander. His thoughts were interrupted by excited screeches. He turned his head and saw Xiao Hong pouncing on him happily. Then it started climbing all over his body.Xiao Hong woke up much earlier. It was only in a state of unconsciousness before and was not heavily injured. Once it woke up it kept its gaze focused on Su Ming, waiting anxiously for him to wake up.When Su Ming woke up, it was out of its mind with joy.Su Ming smiled as he looked at the little monkey but his smile was laced with uncertainty. It was the second time that he had the dream\u2026He took a deep breath. Su Ming shook his head, forcing himself not to think about the strange dream anymore. He chose instead to look at the perfectly normal looking black stone hanging off his neck.He touched the stone, and his eyes gradually became clear of doubt.He already had first-hand experience of the changes the black stone brought upon him. The creation of Scattering Dust had increased his training speed by leaps and bounds. The red pill was also created by accident, allowing Su Ming to obtain complete control and gain the upper hand in a battle between life and death.\u201cI\u2019ll still need to create more pills\u2026 I saw a door at that strange place but there were 15 small holes on the door. I did not have enough pills last time, that\u2019s why I was hesitating. But now, I really want to know just what will happen to the door once I put in 15 Scattering Dusts\u2026\u201d Su Ming muttered lowly under his breath.\u2018I\u2019ll need to make more Scattering Blood. These pills\u2026 will be my trump card! Also, I\u2019ll need to go back to the tribe\u2026 I haven\u2019t gone back for quite some time. The elder has been stuck at the ninth level for many years as well. Perhaps Scattering Dust can help.\u2019Su Ming stood up and moved his limbs. Most of the fatigue in his body was gone by then.He concentrated on making the pills again and continued with the refinement of the blood in his veins. There were some parts of his body that felt a bit sluggish as blood tried to circulate through them. It was not as smooth as before and Su Ming believed that it was a wound left behind when he tried to break through the first level of the Blood Solidification Realm. He would not be able to heal the wound within a short period of time.Within the same month, Su Ming ventured out of the cave a few times. He also had the little monkey help him collect herbs.Su Ming even went out specially to pick two of the red herbs required for Scattering Blood. He wanted to pick more but sensing danger, he decided not to be greedy.Using the vast amounts of herbs he collected, Su Ming began refining his Qi and his blood while also using the herbs to create the medicinal pills he wanted the past month. The muffled sounds of pills being created echoed throughout the cave.It was a month later and the sky was still dark with only faint traces of light. Su Ming gave the little monkey a few instructions and left the mountain alone. Then, he disappeared into the forest.Su Ming, who had arrived at the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm, traveled quickly within the forest. He ran across the icy plains like a flash of light. Before noon, he had already left the forest and was outside the Dark Mountain Tribe settlement. As he looked at the settlement, a smile appeared across his face.\u2018I haven\u2019t been back for quite some time\u2026\u2019Su Ming walked towards it. Everything was normal. Many children were playing around and some the tribe members were sparring against each other.Su Ming\u2019s return attracted some of the tribe members\u2019 attention. He had been gone for a long time, after all. They came out and greeted him with smiles on their faces.\u201cSu Ming, you\u2019re finally back! Where did you go?\u201d Su Ming stroked a child\u2019s head and just as he was about to leave to the elder\u2019s house, an excited voice rang out from behind him.He turned around and looked. The person who spoke was a big and well-built man, but he had a slight baby face. It was a clear sign that he was still young. That person was Lei Chen.\u201cWhat?\u201d Su Ming glanced at Lei Chen and could feel that the Qi in his body had grown much stronger. The aura he felt from Lei Chen was actually quite similar to the Berserker he killed using Scattering Blood.\u201cYou almost broke through the fourth level of the Blood Solidification Realm?\u201d Su Ming asked, surprised.Lei Chen grinned widely and walked up to Su Ming\u2019s side to speak softly to him.\u201cI have a feeling I\u2019ll reach the next level soon. Hehe, the elder said the Berserker Blood within my body is quite pure. If this continues, some day I will be able to reach the elder\u2019s level.\u201d As Lei Chen spoke, his eyes shone with excitement. Soon after, he began to look at Su Ming carefully and he was stunned. Then, he widened his eyes in disbelief. Just as he was about to speak\u2026\u201cCome to my place tonight, we\u2019ll talk later. Let me go see the elder first.\u201d Su Ming knew what Lei Chen was about to say. He gave him a faint smile and went to the elder\u2019s house.As he watched Su Ming\u2019s back, Lei Chen was speechless. He pulled at his hair in confusion and mumbled a few words, trying to piece things together. However in the end, he still could not understand it. He still remembered to go to Su Ming\u2019s place later that night though.As he approached the elder\u2019s house, Su Ming slowed down. There were slight signs of anxiety and fear in his eyes. Su Ming respected the elder for taking care of him since he was young. To him, the elder was just like his grandfather and their relationship could not be described with words.He did not want to lie to the elder but there were some things that he could not disclose like the piece of debris on his neck. Su Ming was not a child anymore. He could tell if the public knew about the piece of debris, it could very well mean the doom of the entire tribe, not just himself.He could not speak of it.Su Ming took a deep breath and stood in front of the elder\u2019s house. He did not enter immediately. He could hear the faint traces of voices coming from the inside, like people were in a meeting.He waited patiently until the door of the elder\u2019s house opened and out came three men. These three men were all built like small hills. When they appeared, Su Ming felt a great pressure. Their presence even caused the Qi in his body to stir. He thought that he was about to be swept away by a typhoon.Su Ming inhaled sharply and took a few steps back instinctively. The three men were the leaders of Dark Mountain Tribe. Before Su Ming Awakened, he had not been as badly affected. He could only vaguely feel that they were some of the best Berserkers besides the elder.Now that Su Ming was a practitioner at the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm, the oppressive feeling was much stronger than before when he met the tribe leaders.The Qi within the tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe was so great, he felt like it could shake heaven and earth. Combined with the vague Berserker Mark on his face, it only served to make him even more terrifying.Su Ming also knew the two men beside the tribe leader. The man on his left was also a man in his 40s. There was a mark shaped like a scorpion on his face. The level of Qi within him was only slightly weaker than the tribe leader.His arms were also very long and there was a big bow slung across his back. For some unknown reason, when Su Ming looked at the bow, he felt like he could hear the agonizing cries of its numerous victims. It caused him to feel a little wary of the man.That man was the Head of the Guards of Dark Mountain Tribe!The Head of the Guards was not a name, but a title given by its predecessor to the successor. There could only be one Head of the Guards in each tribe and it was a title given only to the strongest archers in the tribe.The last person standing to the tribe leader\u2019s right was a man in his 30s. His facial expressions were rather stiff. He was not a man who smiled and talked often. His eyes were usually narrowed into a slit and it was difficult to see the full view of his eyes.He was the chief of the hunters in Dark Mountain Tribe and was responsible for all the hunts outside the tribe settlement. His name was Shan Hen!These three people were considered to be the strongest in Dark Mountain Tribe besides the elder!Su Ming took a deep breath and stepped aside as he bowed before them.The tribe leader was frowning. It was apparent that the meeting with the elder did not end on good terms. When he walked out of the house, he did not even look at Su Ming. He just walked past him.As for the Head of the Guards, he smiled at Su Ming when he saw him. Then, he nodded as a sign of acknowledgment to his presence before leaving with the tribe leader.Shan Hen, the chief of the hunters also treated Su Ming as if he was invisible. He ignored him as he walked by.After the three men left, there was a hint of dubiousness in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He felt uncertain about the Qi in his body. If Lei Chen could sense it, why did the three strongest Berserkers in the tribe not feel anything?\u201cI already concealed your Qi. Come in, why are you still standing outside?!\u201d Just as Su Ming was still being troubled, the elder\u2019s stern voice sounded from within the house.Su Ming lowered his head and walked into the house.\u201cYou finally decided to come back?\u201d The elder still wore a sack cloth and had his hair tied in many small braids. His features still looked as old and weary as ever, but his eyes were vibrant with life. His tone of voice was grave and serious but the joy in his eyes could not be concealed.Su Ming mumbled a few words. He still hung his head low, not really having the courage to speak.\u201cYou grew a pair of balls, is that it? How could you leave the tribe and not return for so many months? Have you forgotten about me? Hmph, lift up your head. Let me take a look at you.\u201d There were hints of dissatisfaction in the elder\u2019s voice.Su Ming\u2019s expression was anxious as he lifted his head and looked at the elder.\u201cElder\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish, the elder who was sitting with his legs crossed suddenly grabbed Su Ming sternly with his right hand. Su Ming stumbled forward a few steps as the elder pressed his right hand on his chest.A soft and gentle power weaved itself into Su Ming\u2019s body. Once it melded together with his blood, it immediately healed the wounds that Su Ming did not even realize he received. It also dissolved the dangers of Su Ming risking his health when he forcefully reached the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm and killed without stabilizing the Qi in his body.When the elder retrieved his right hand from Su Ming\u2019s chest, Su Ming trembled. He immediately took a spatula and opened up a gash on his arm. Instantly, black blood flowed out from the gash and there was even a stench in the air which came from the blood.\u201cYou haven\u2019t even stabilized the Qi in your body and you already ventured out to kill someone? You\u2019ve really grown a pair, haven\u2019t you?\u201d As the elder observed Su Ming\u2019s reaction, the praise in his eyes grew stronger. Nonetheless, he still spoke harshly towards. Yet even as he did so, he took out a dark green bottle and handed it to Su Ming.When all the black blood flowed out from the gash, Su Ming\u2019s body felt refreshed. Once he took the bottle and opened it, he touched the liquid in the bottle with his finger and spread it over his wound.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTranslator\u2019s Note:Regarding titles:1. For \u86ee\u516c,I\u2019ve opted for the use of Elder, which is a title, and for \u963f\u516c, I\u2019ve opted for elder, because it bore familiar and endearing connotations. In bigger civilizations such as kingdoms, \u86ee\u516c is known as Court Diviner because they have positions within court and work for the Emperor, as you could tell in the prologue.2. For tribe leader and chief of the hunters, these titles will be in small letters because the idea behind it is that we don\u2019t call our mayors and chiefs in big caps either.3. The Head of the Guards is in big caps because when the term first appeared, it was blatantly stated as a title. Think of it as a military title. That is why I chose to use big caps, because military titles are in big caps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s just that they went overboard. They snatched Xiao Hong away,\u201d Su Ming mumbled.\u201cThey?\u201d The elder was stunned.\u201cOne of them was a Berserker at the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm and the other was a Berserker at the third level.\u201d Su Ming placed the cork back on the bottle then put the bottle on the table beside him.\u201cBlack Mountain Tribe? How did you manage to escape?\u201d The elder narrowed his eyes. A cold and steely look settled in his eyes.\u201cI didn\u2019t escape. They died.\u201d Su Ming lifted his head and looked at the elder.The elder was stunned but was also visibly moved. After falling silent momentarily, he decided not to ask Su Ming about the details. Su Ming was like his own child. He took care of him as he grew up and he knew of his character.\u201cYou met them at Black Flame Mountain right? The information you gave us last time was really useful. You should have been rewarded for that but because you hid the fact that you\u2019ve become a Berserker, that reward is canceled. Now that you\u2019re a Berserker, stay. I will tell you about some of my experiences training in the Ways of the Berserker. I\u2019ll also card through the blood veins in your body.\u201d The elder looked at Su Ming and smiled.\u201cElder\u2026\u201d Su Ming scratched his head sheepishly. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he opened his mouth and spoke softly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Aren\u2019t you going to ask me how I became a Berserker?\u201d\u201cWhy should I? Everyone has their own secrets. I just need to know that my Su Ming has finally become a Berserker.\u201d The elder laughed happily.Su Ming\u2019s eyes were teary. He looked at the elder and nodded. He would never forget the elder\u2019s kindness towards him or the Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva that had been flowing in his veins or all that had happened. All of these things were imprinted on his mind and soul.\u201cElder, I have some pills\u2026 Here\u2026\u201d Su Ming looked at the elder and spoke softly.\u201cPills?\u201d The elder asked in bewilderment, then shook his head and laughed.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about herbs, right? I know that you must have gotten yourself some rare herbs but I\u2019m the elder of Dark Mountain Tribe. Unless they\u2019re really very rarely seen, I\u2019ve seen every\u2026 What?!\u201dBefore the elder finished speaking, Su Ming produced two small bottles and placed them before the elder.The two bottles were filled with green pills and they were letting out a nice therapeutic scent. Both bottles had about a dozen pills within them.The elder\u2019s face turned solemn. He took one of the bottle containing the pills and inspected them. Once he was certain that it was nothing like he had ever seen, he took a sniff and his countenance immediately changed.\u201cWhat a strange medicine! I just took a sniff and I can already feel my blood circulating faster!\u201dThe elder mumbled and scrutinized the pills further. After a moment, he closed his eyes and began to think. When he finally opened his eyes, he looked at Su Ming.\u201cThese are called pills?\u201dSu Ming nodded his head and pointed towards the bottle containing the pills. He started introducing the effects and the methods of using the pills to the elder. The elder drew a sharp breath and his demeanor changed completely once he listened halfway.There were no signs of hesitation. The elder immediately waved his right hand and right before Su Ming, an illusion of the statue of the God of the Berserkers appeared. The shape of the statue was that of the half human, half beast statue of the God of the Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe.The moment the statue appeared, a gentle energy spread around the room.\u201cContinue.\u201d Su Ming looked at the elder\u2019s solemn face and felt his heart pounding against his chest. Then he continued to slowly tell the elder all the effects of the Scattering Dust.The elder was already standing. Once he finished listening to Su Ming, he took out one of the Scattering Dusts and observed it carefully. Then he swallowed it in one bite. He believed in Su Ming. There was practically no hesitation in his movements. He then took out a small purple bottle and drank down what little that remained in the bottle.He sat down with his legs crossed once again. Very soon, his body let out a bright and bloody red glow. The light was glaringly bright and it covered the entire room. Su Ming took a few steps back. His eyes were filled with admiration.He could see the many blood veins on the elder\u2019s body. He could not tell just how many there were but the presence of a Qi much stronger than the tribe leader\u2019s filled the entire room.Su Ming drew a sharp breath. He watched the God of Berserker\u2019s glowing statue floating midair and knew that if it were not for the illusion of the statue, the light released by the elder would have covered the entire tribe. It could possibly have been seen even from afar.The light disappeared just as quickly as it came. As the elder opened his eyes, the red light that enveloped his entire body also dissipated. His eyes were filled with a layer of excitement. He looked at the Scattering Dust and took a deep breath.\u201cSu Ming, you must remember one thing!\u201d The elder lifted his head and looked at Su Ming.Su Ming immediately stood to attention.\u201cFrom today onwards, do not tell anyone about the pills! Even if I asked you again, you mustn\u2019t speak of it! From today onwards, I will not ask you anything about this!\u201d\u201cEven within the tribe, you must remember not to talk about this to anyone! Not even to Lei Chen!\u201d The elder spoke sternly as he looked deeply into Su Ming\u2019s eyes.Su Ming hesitated for a moment.The elder sighed. He understood Su Ming. He knew that Su Ming was an honest man. That was why he chose to speak sternly again.\u201cSu Ming, listen to me. You mustn\u2019t tell anyone!\u201dSu Ming nodded silently as his gaze was filled with resolution.\u201cThe tribe\u2026 is not safe\u2026\u201d The elder muttered but his words surprised Su Ming momentarily. It dawned on him especially when he remembered how the elder had hidden his Qi from the three leaders of the tribe.\u201cThere is a traitor in our tribe! Right now, only the tribe leader and I know about this. No one else knows about it. The traitor has hidden himself too well. We don\u2019t know who it is\u2026\u201d\u201cWith the information you brought to us, perhaps my old arch nemesis from the Black Mountain Tribe has really found a way to reach the next level\u2026 I\u2019ve been feeling that the weather around the area has been a bit odd lately\u2026 It\u2019s as though a major disaster is about to approach.\u201d\u201cSu Ming, these pills of yours are good so I\u2019ll be keeping them. Don\u2019t give me more of these. If I can really break through to the next level, these will be enough. But if I can\u2019t, even if you give me more, it\u2019ll still be useless\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not lacking in herbs, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m stuck and I just need a chance to break through\u2026\u201d The elder sighed. He spoke to Su Ming a little more about his experiences training in the Ways of the Berserker. Then he took out a strange object made of twigs. The elder\u2019s gaze was filled with nostalgia when he looked at the item.After some time, he gave the item to Su Ming solemnly.\u201cI got this when I was out adventuring during my younger days. This thing is called a bamboo slip. You will only see these in big tribes. There are a lot of uses of herbs recorded in this bamboo slip. Take it.\u201dSu Ming took the bamboo slip and was marveled by it. He put it away in his bosom and was just about to go back to his own house when the elder looked at Su Ming solemnly.\u201cSu Ming, I\u2019m happy that you became a Berserker but you must understand that once you become a Berserker, you are no longer the same as the normal members of the tribe. The road to become a practitioner of the Ways of the Berserker is extremely difficult. The slightest mistake can bring about death. You must have felt it when you were at Black Flame Mountain.\u201d\u201cBut we are members of the Berserker Tribe. We cannot fear death, much less give up because the road ahead is too hard to walk.\u201d\u201cI know what your dreams are. You want to leave this place and travel to see the world. I fully support you!\u201dSu Ming listened quietly and nodded.\u201cYou are a good child. I\u2019ve watched over you for many years and I know that. But my training is insufficient and I can\u2019t help you too much\u2026 I thought it would be fine if our Su Ming couldn\u2019t become a Berserker. However, if he did manage to become a practitioner of the Berserker Arts, then I will do everything that I can to make your journey as easy as possible\u2026\u201d A smile gradually appeared on the elder\u2019s serious face and he waved at Su Ming to approach him.\u201cCome, sit down before me and circulate the blood in your veins as you usually do when you train.\u201dSu Ming looked at the old man whose hair was speckled with white and whose face was covered with wrinkles. The elder was smiling kindly at him. He knew that there were no blood ties between him and the elder but the affection they felt towards each other could overcome all blood ties.\u201cElder\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled.\u201cCome here already.\u201d The elder laughed heartily.Su Ming sat down before the elder obediently and took a deep breath. Then he slowly began to move the Qi around his body. Soon, the six blood veins manifested. As the six blood veins began to give out a red glow, the vague shadow of a seventh blood vein appeared and started to manifest slowly.Su Ming had been unable to manifest the seventh blood vein for the past month. He had not even been able to summon an illusion of it. This was largely connected to the internal injuries he had obtained. Since the elder had healed his internal injuries, the seventh blood vein appeared naturally when he activated the Qi in his body.\u201cYou\u2019ve already inherited the knowledge from the statue of the God of the Berserkers. You know that the Berserkers will need to manifest 11 blood veins if they want to reach the third level. As for the fourth level, they will need 25 blood veins.\u201d\u201cYou will need 53 blood veins for the fifth and there will only be more for the rest of the levels\u2026 As for the 11th level of the Blood Solidification Realm, you should need 781 blood veins.\u201d\u201cBut the manifestation of blood veins required may not be the same for some people. Most of the Berserkers will need the same number of blood veins to reach the next level, but there are some people who are capable of increasing the number of blood veins in their body. The more blood veins you have, the more likely it is for you to reach the Awakening Realm!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, all the Berserkers who have managed to reach the Awakening Realm have always had more than 900 blood veins during the Blood Solidification Realm! Take for example the elder of the Wind Stream Tribe. I\u2019ve known him for many years and I know that he had 917 blood veins many years ago!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard before that in middle sized tribes and in some big tribes, there are those in the Blood Solidification Realm who have manifested more than 930 blood veins.\u201d\u201cThis is the Blood Solidification Realm of the Berserker tribe\u2026 There have been some people in the history of the Berserker Tribe who have manifested 999 blood veins during the Blood Solidification Realm. These people have all become very famous and powerful people.\u201d\u201cThere are even rumors that if you manifest 1,000 blood veins, you will obtain completion in the Blood Solidification Realm. But that sort of completion could only be seen during our ancestors\u2019 time more than thousands of years ago. It\u2019s extremely rare nowadays. I can say that no one has reached completion in the Blood Solidification Realm. As for the details, I don\u2019t know about it because I don\u2019t have enough information.\u201d The elder\u2019s voice seemed to hold a strange sort of power that echoed in Su Ming\u2019s head as he moved the Qi in his body.\u201cAfter Blood Solidification is the Awakening Realm. Awakening actually means to gather all the manifested blood veins and refine them into the purest form of Berserker Blood. Then you draw your own personal solidified Berserker Mark on your body\u2026 The Berserker Mark has to come from your own heart and desire\u2026 I\u2019m excited to see what Berserker Mark you would draw should you reach the Awakening Realm someday.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I might not be able to reach the Awakening Realm in my life\u2026\u201d\u201cThe elder in Wind Stream Tribe was not as powerful as I was before he was 20. When he was 34, he was only barely able to keep up with me in a battle. Back then, there wasn\u2019t anyone who didn\u2019t know who I was in all the tribes around the area!\u201d The elder spoke slowly and his face flushed. There was even a hint of pride in his eyes.However, the radiance from his pride was dimmed by something, like it was sealed in a box and covered by a layer of dust\u2026\u201cAt that time, I had already arrived at the ninth level of the Blood Solidification Realm\u2026\u201d The elder sighed as he mumbled bitterly. He spoke as reminisced about the past. The sadness in his eyes grew.\u201cSu Ming, you must remember. There will always be people who are stronger and more powerful than you. You must never be arrogant\u2026\u201d The elder shook his head, as if he did not want to talk about his past any longer.\u201cI\u2019ve ventured out of the tribe three times in my life and I\u2019ve experienced a lot of things. I may have lost just as much but I learned a Berserker Art. This isn\u2019t a Berserker Art that Wind Stream Tribe will ever learn. It is also difficult to find this in slightly bigger or medium sized tribes. This is an art left behind by our Berserker ancestors that can only be learned in big tribes\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the true Berserker\u2019s Awakening Art\u2026 You can only use it once in your life, and it is an art used to bless a chosen descendant.\u201d The elder narrowed his eyes in concentration and lifted his right hand. Almost immediately, his entire palm was filled with blood and he pressed his palm slowly on Su Ming\u2019s forehead.\u201cSu Ming, this is the first and only time I will cast the Awakening Art and I will cast it on you. This is my blessing for you. I hope you will one day fulfill my dreams and reach the Awakening Realm for Dark Mountain Tribe again!\u201d\u201cActivate the Qi in your body and absorb the Berserker Blood I\u2019ve trained for the past 80 years!\u201d The elder\u2019s entire body glowed a bloody red. That color was especially prominent in his right hand, and it looked as if blood was about to fall off his hand. A huge number of blood veins also manifested on his body. Just by looking at it, Su Ming could tell that there there were approximately 700 blood veins!This was the elder\u2019s true power \u2013 a manifestation of more than 700 blood veins. Due to this, he was able to fight a Berserker at the tenth level despite being only at the ninth level of the Blood Solidification Realm!Su Ming trembled. As he circulated the Qi around his body, a gigantic wave of heat that seemed to be endless flowed from his forehead into his entire body. It caused the flow of Qi in his body to increase drastically. A huge amount of black substance flowed out of Su Ming\u2019s pores and he felt his body slowly becoming free of blockage. With each breath he took, his entire body felt like it simultaneously took in a huge amount of the air around him.Cracking sounds rang through the air. Su Ming\u2019s body no longer shivered but his face was flushed red as though he had just eaten a very good supplement. Even the blood veins in his body began to change!The seventh blood vein that was only an illusion earlier had already manifested. Once it did, the eighth blood vein followed suit and manifested as well. The ninth blood vein also appeared as an illusion.The speed of the Qi flow in Su Ming\u2019s body had increased to a terrifying speed. With each complete circulation, it was as if all the blood in his body had clotted. He even had the false impression that his blood had turned into a sticky substance.\u201cThis is the true meaning of the Blood Solidification Realm! You must solidify and refine your own blood and transform them into Berserker Blood!\u201dWhen he was training in the past, he would always feel that he had insufficient blood not long into his training. At that moment, however, the feeling was gone as endless heat traveled into his body from his forehead. He even had the impression that the thought of not having enough blood was just an illusion.The elder, who was enveloped by a bloody glow looked like he had turned into a giant red ball of light. Su Ming himself was also a bloody red ball of light, but compared to the elder, he was just like a firefly under the moonlight. Yet the firefly was absorbing the light from the moon and growing stronger quickly.\u2018This\u2026 This is just what the elder told me before. This is the true Berserker\u2019s Awakening in the Berserker Tribe. This is the Berserker Art that only big tribes possess, the ancient Berserker Art!\u2019The ninth blood vein manifested and the feeling of power enveloped Su Ming\u2019s entire body. The black substance had already been completely dispelled from his body and it was replaced by an indescribable fragrance.Su Ming sank into a warm and comfortable feeling.The elder kept his attention on Su Ming\u2019s body. He knew that the purpose of the ancient Berserker Art, the true Berserker\u2019s Awakening was not to increase the chosen descendant\u2019s training but to eliminate all the undesirable substances within the body. It was to create a body suitable for training in the Ways of the Berserker for the chosen descendant. It could make the road to train in the Ways of the Berserker much easier for the chosen descendant.It was not just a simple banishment of undesirable substances. He had to use his Berserker Blood as a guide to expel the undesirable substances in a manner that he did not understand. It was technique that he could use only once in his life!If he tried to do it a second time, his body would burst and his soul would shatter.As the fragrance from Su Ming\u2019s body grew stronger, the elder smiled. Nevertheless, he did not stop. He took a deep breath and raised his left hand, pressing it over his right hand. Soon, an even stronger and greater wave of warmth entered Su Ming\u2019s body.Su Ming trembled. There was no longer any black substance coming out of his body but as the warmth entered his body, a beating sound reverberated throughout his body. Then, more black substance was secreted from his body right before his eyes.At the same time, the 10th blood vein in Su Ming\u2019s body quickly manifested to its physical state. The process only lasted for a moment. Even the 11th blood vein was already showing itself faintly on his body!Once the 11th blood vein manifested itself, Su Ming would become a Berserker at the third level of the Blood Solidification Realm!However, the manifestation of the 11th blood vein was proving itself to be extremely difficult. Even after Su Ming\u2019s body stopped excreting any black substance and released a nice fragrance, the 11th blood vein was still in an illusionary state.\u201cSu Ming, I cannot help you by forcefully increasing the state of your training. This will not bring any good to you. But if you\u2019re diligent, you\u2019ll reach the third level naturally before long.\u201d The elder\u2019s voice echoed in Su Ming\u2019s ears.Su Ming took a deep breath and opened his eyes slowly.The moment he opened his eyes, the world looked slightly different. His sight became much clearer. The details he had never noticed before were now as clear as day.His world had become different.Both of his eyes were as clear as water, but if anyone took a closer look, they would see that his eyes were like the abyss. People who looked into them would be unable to look away.As he looked at the elder, he saw that the elder\u2019s face had aged once again. There were even signs of fatigue in his features. Despite that, there were clear signs of great kindness and affection as the elder gazed upon him.Su Ming stared at the elder in a dumbfounded state. In his silence, he knelt down and bowed towards the elder.\u201cEnough. You\u2019re a grown man now. You\u2019re no longer a La Su. I\u2019m a little tired. Go back. Let me rest.\u201d\u201cElder\u2026\u201d Su Ming bit his lip and gazed deeply at the elder, carving the scene before him into his mind. For all of eternity and his entire life, he would never ever forget that there was a person who accompanied him when he was younger and allowed him to experience familial love. He understood that this was a love that he would never be able to repay for his entire life\u2026\u201cCome with me to\u2026Wind Stream Tribe next time. We\u2019ll be visiting the elder of Wind Stream Tribe and seeing the Berserkers there. Representatives from Black Mountain Tribe, Dark Dragon Tribe and other smaller tribes will also be going\u2026 It will be a good experience for all of you in the younger generation\u2026\u201d Before he left, he heard the elder\u2019s voice echoing in his ears.\u201cI\u2019ve already concealed the Qi and fragrance from your body. No one will notice unless they are more powerful than I am. Do not tell anyone about the fact that you became a Berserker\u2026 We\u2019ll make a decision once I find the traitor.\u201dSu Ming nodded. When he saw the elder sitting down cross-legged with his eyes closed and immersing himself in his training, he quietly left.He knew that Wind Stream Tribe was the only medium sized tribe around the region and it was considered as the leader of the area. Su Ming had heard rumors of the elder of Wind Stream Tribe being a powerful Berserker who had arrived at the Awakening Realm. Not only did he have a long lifespan, he also had the power to crush heaven and earth.\u2018Awakening Realm\u2026 I wonder if I\u2019ll be able to arrive at that realm in my life\u2026 I wonder if I can even draw my own Berserker Mark\u2026\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up with ambition. The Awakening Realm was like a mere legend to him. It was still too far away from him.\u2018So this is the elder\u2019s real strength. I didn\u2019t expect him to be so strong\u2026 I heard that the elder from Black Mountain Tribe had some sort of secret\u2026 or else they wouldn\u2019t have been able to last so long\u2026\u2019Su Ming shook his head and refused to continue thinking about the matter.When Su Ming returned to his house, which had been left barren for the past few months, he calmed down. The place was clean. There was barely any dust around. Su Ming knew that this could only mean that Chen Xin dropped by during the days that he was gone.Chen Xin was the only girl within Dark Mountain Tribe whom Su Ming had more contact with. She was the tribe leader\u2019s daughter and would only be married to the future tribe leader so that the tribe would continue to prosper and there were no disputes about that within the tribe.Su Ming knew this since a long time ago and was not offended or saddened by it. Chen Xin was like a little sister to him and he held no other feelings towards her.He sat down with his legs crossed on the wooden bed. Su Ming touched the stone on his neck as he fell into deep thought.As nighttime arrived, Lei Chen came to Su Ming\u2019s house puzzled. When he saw Su Ming, he was dumbfounded. The silly look on his face made Su Ming smile.He took out the herbs he got from the remains of the Berserker from Black Mountain Tribe. Su Ming knew about Sky Stone, of course. It was one of the rarer herbs found in the region. He had only managed to obtain one of them during all the years he went to collect herbs in the mountains. That too, had been only a young shoot. It was unlike the one he had in the present, which was fully grown and had six leaves.\u201cA Sky Stone with six leaves. I\u2019ll need more of them to make some medication but I can give you a leaf. You might be able to use it to help with your training.\u201d Su Ming plucked one of the leaves from the plant and gave it to Lei Chen.Lei Chen laughed and scratched his head. Then he patted his chest bashfully after he took it from Su Ming\u2019s hands.\u201cSu Ming, I don\u2019t know about all this stuff. But I already told you since I was young, I will become the tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe in the future. As long as I\u2019m around, I\u2019ll always protect you!\u201dSu Ming laughed heartily and as he spoke to Lei Chen. He noticed that Lei Chen kept looking at the Sky Stone leaf and was unable to concentrate to the conversation. It was obvious that he wanted to eat it and immediately start training.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHence, he pretended to be tired. When Lei Chen noticed it, he immediately lit up with excitement. He quickly got up and left.The sky had already darkened and silence gradually fell upon the tribe. Su Ming blocked the door to his house with a chair and sat down with his legs crossed on the bed. He took a deep breath and touched the stone hanging off his neck with his right hand. In his mind, he pictured the strange place he saw that day.\u2018I already have an ample supply of Scattering Dust ready\u2026 I wonder if I\u2019ll be able obtain something new this time\u2026\u2019Su Ming closed his eyes. He had long since figured out the method to enter the strange place. What he needed to do was gather all the blood to his chest when he was training. Then he would be able to go to the strange place.He had already tried it multiple times during his training. It was finally time for him to do it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could not see too far away. The only thing vaguely visible was the peak of the mountain amid the mist. It was quiet around him. There was neither wind nor sound around the area.Su Ming looked at the mountain shrouded by fog. It was his second time there. It was also the second time he stood where he was and sized up the strange mountain before him, especially the strange letters and drawings carved into the mountain. Su Ming had a sense of respect for whoever it was that left them behind.He took a deep breath and looked at the accessory on his chest. The black stone was gone. He pinched himself and was once again certain that he was not dreaming. He had really arrived at the strange place.He reached into his bosom and took out a few bottles that contained Scattering Dust. Then he quickly walked towards the fog. Before long, he arrived at the foot of the mountain and he went into the tunnel again.He did not stop until he reached the stone door in the tunnel. As he looked at the familiar circle in the middle of the door and the 15 small holes there, Su Ming hesitated for a moment. Then he took a pill out from one of the bottles. With the pill between his fingers, he placed it into the very first hole on the door.At the very moment his fingers touched the small hole on the door, Su Ming felt a faint pull coming from the hole and it sucked in the pill between his fingers.Su Ming\u2019s became stern and alert. He was unsure if his judgment was correct and he did not know what would happen once he filled up all 15 holes. However, he had envisioned this trip for a long time and a part of him was looking forward to it.He did not act rashly. After the first hole absorbed the pill, Su Ming focused his attention on the door, but nothing happened.Su Ming scratched his head. After a moment of thought, he took out another pill and placed it in the second hole. This continued until he placed the 15th pill into the last hole with much reluctance and nervousness.\u2018If there are still no changes even after I\u2019ve placed 15 pills into the holes, all of this would be a waste\u2026\u2019Su Ming watched the 15 holes anxiously. At that very moment, a gentle glow surfaced from the holes.Su Ming immediately retreated excitedly. As the light surrounded the door and gradually grew brighter, the strings on the door came to life and moved slowly. After a while, they joined together and started to turn quickly like a vortex.As they turned, the light from the 15 holes was slowly but surely sucked into the vortex, causing the door to be enveloped by a brilliant light. A roaring sound suddenly reverberated throughout the tunnel. The sound was so loud it could have made a person deaf. It made Su Ming involuntarily manifest the 10 blood veins within his body. He felt the blood in his entire body boiling and he instinctively resisted the pull.The roaring sound lasted for a few moments and green smoke emerged from the 15 holes. It was as if the pills had dissolved into smoke. As 15 puffs of smoke emerged from the holes, the gigantic stone door shook. A straight and narrow gap appeared all of a sudden at the center of the door.As soon as the gap appeared, the two sides of the door slowly swung to the side. The door opened!Su Ming\u2019s heart pounded against his chest. As he watched the scene unfold before him, he felt himself trembling in excitement. It was only after the door opened completely that Su Ming took in a sharp breath. There was no longer a tunnel behind the stone door but a small stone chamber.The walls in the chamber were not smooth instead, they were filled with carvings. There was a large door that was tightly shut at the northern wall in the chamber.On the ceiling of the chamber were some stones glowing faintly. They had fused into the walls of the chamber. There was a faint aroma in the chamber which could lift a person\u2019s spirits the moment they took a whiff of it.Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up with excitement but he still walked into the chamber carefully. He swept his gaze around the walls and saw that the style of the carvings on the walls was similar to the ones in the tunnel. They all featured men with messy hair creating medicinal pills in an ancient setting.When Su Ming first arrived at the place, he was baffled by the drawings. However, following the success of his own quenching of the herbs and the additional memories he gained, he could understand most of them when he saw the drawings again.The figures on the drawings were creating different medicinal pills. As Su Ming observed the drawings, he could not help but be immersed in them. He verified each and every one of the drawings with his own experiences and forgot about time as he obsessed the drawings.He would move quickly to search for the next carving once he finished observing one. He did not realize how much time had passed. When he finished looking at all the carvings, he still longed for more and he cast his gaze on the door within the chamber.This door was slightly different from the first one. It was completely black and it gave off a nice aroma. It seemed like the materials used to build the door held some mysterious properties.It also had a sort of heaviness to it. There was a drawing on the door too but it featured a gigantic cauldron. There were also wisps of smoke carved on top of it. It almost looked real. As Su Ming looked on, he had the impression that he was not looking at a drawing but at a real cauldron used for the quenching of herbs.\u2018If only I had a cauldron like this\u2026 \u2018Su Ming looked at the cauldron for a few more moments with envy.Su Ming saw a number of different herbs on top and on both sides of the cauldron. He immediately felt himself quivering in excitement and paid full attention to the drawing. This was what he came here for, to find more recipes to create other medicinal pills.To the left of the cauldron were seven herbs. Among the seven herbs, five of them were herbs needed to create Scattering Dust. As for the other two, Su Ming had never seen them before. After he carefully observed their features, Su Ming imprinted their image on his mind.There were eight holes on the stone door arranged neatly, right underneath the recipe.To the right of the cauldron were eight herbs. The recipe was slightly similar to the recipe on the left. Five of the herbs required were also the necessary ingredients for Scattering Dust.When Su Ming saw the additional three ingredients necessary, his eyes lit up with joy. He knew two of the three herbs. They were just slightly rare.There were also holes underneath this recipe but the number was slightly more than the recipe on the left. There were 12 holes underneath it.When Su Ming looked at the recipe on the top of the cauldron, his face became grim. The ingredients to the recipe were not herbs. The drawing was of three things that would incite fear among those who saw them.The first was the scales from the tail of a python, the second was the ninth leg from a Nine-Legged Spider and the third was the third finger from the right hand of a small black humanoid creature, the size of a palm.Strangely, there were no holes underneath the third recipe. Perhaps, it was because the medicinal pill was too hard to create so it was not necessary to make it.Su Ming fell silent momentarily. He walked towards the stone door and raised his right hand. Without any hesitation, he pressed his hand on the door and immediately, the drawing of the cauldron emitted a piercing light. It enveloped Su Ming\u2019s body.After a moment of discomfort, foreign memories appeared once again in Su Ming\u2019s mind. He obtained the method to create the three medicinal pills and their names.\u2018South Asunder!\u2019 Su Ming looked at the drawing on the left of the cauldron, then turned his gaze to the right.\u201cMountain Spirit\u2026 As for the last one\u2026 the Welcoming of Deities!\u201d Su Ming looked at the strange recipe on top of the cauldron and mumbled.As Su Ming thought about them, the light surrounding his body gradually dimmed along with the light from the cauldron on the stone door. Once the light completely disappeared, Su Ming\u2019s vision blurred but he was not nervous. He had already experienced this once. There was a strange whistling sound next to his ears. Once it was over, his vision slowly returned, and he found himself in his room within the tribe settlement.Su Ming took a deep breath and walked towards the door immediately. He took away the chair and opened the door. It was still night time outside. The stars shone in the sky. It was quiet as the cold night wind blew past him.However there was a faint silver light at the horizon, a clear sign that dawn was about to arrive.\u2018Looks like the difference in time between the two places is not too big\u2026 \u2018Su Ming closed the door behind him and sat down with his legs crossed again. He cupped his chin with his hands and began thinking.\u2018All three crafting methods are different for the three medicinal pills. I\u2019ve never seen the two herbs required for South Asunder so I can ignore that for now. As for\u2026 the Welcoming of Deities\u2026 \u2018Su Ming narrowed his eyes.\u2018The ingredients required for this pill aren\u2019t herbs and the items are simply too strange. But what happens once the pill is created is really shocking! \u2018Su Ming remembered how the weather had changed when the person in his memories created the Welcoming of Deities. The sight of the wind and clouds traveling backwards and made his heart pound fiercely.\u2018The effects of the pill must be really shocking! But it\u2019s a pity\u2026 It\u2019s clear with the lack of holes on the stone door that the creation of this pill is extremely difficult\u2026 That\u2019s why it does not serve as a key to open the door. \u2018Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith some thought, Su Ming already guessed about half of the true story.\u2018Looks like the only thing I can create for now is Mountain Spirit. I know two of the three additional herbs\u2026 I may not have it now but there must be some in the tribe\u2019s herbal storage.\u2019As Su Ming continued thinking, light gradually filled the sky and a new day arrived.He had not rested an entire night but Su Ming was not tired at all. The lack of fatigue became obvious when he reached the second level in the Blood Solidification Realm. It was as if he had obtained a huge amount of energy. Unless he went a few nights without sleep, he would not become tired.As day arrived, the members of the tribe started busying themselves with work. Once Su Ming cleaned himself up, he walked towards a house made of grass not far away from his own house. It was surrounded by a fence which was constantly guarded by a few members of the tribe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In spite of that, with the bonfire burning amid the tribe, a gentle warmth surrounded the entire tribe as it expelled the cold.The circulation of Qi within their bodies allowed Berserkers to resist the cold but as most of the members of the tribe were normal people, most of them chose not to venture out during winter.Even if they did go out, they would wear thick hides to fend against the cold. During the winter, common healers in the tribe would also be at their busiest. They had to create vast amounts of medication to increase the tribe members\u2019 immunity against the cold.The elder would also activate the Qi in his body during the coldest days of the season to help the entire tribe last through the cold.Su Ming wore a beast skin shirt that covered his entire body and trudged through the snow towards the tribe as he listened to the crunchy sounds from the snow under his feet. Looking at the familiar sights in his tribe and at the tribe members greeting him with smiles, it warmed his heart. It seemed to chase away the frigid winter cold.The houses in the tribe were mostly simple in design. They were fine during the other seasons but they could not provide shelter against the wind during winter. They had to cover the walls of the houses with a large amount of hides to prevent the cold from entering their houses.Sometimes, the hides would not stick to the walls for a long period of time and would require regular maintenance. The tribe members themselves also needed to add wood to the fires in their houses regularly. Hence, winter was torture for most of the tribe members.At the very least, the cold did not kill them but it was still troublesome.Su Ming arrived at the building constantly guarded by a few members of the tribe. It was the herbal storage for Dark Mountain Tribe. The walls of the building outside were covered by thick layers of hide. There were also several bonfires burning around the building. They allowed him to feel a layer of heat as he rode on the tails of the cold wind when he went near.Su Ming was familiar with the place. Every single time he returned after collecting herbs, he would deliver all the herbs he collected there. So, when the guards saw Su Ming, they smiled and did not stop him.Su Ming smiled back and greeted them as he went through the fence. Just as he was about to open the door and enter, a happy voice called out from behind.\u201cSu Ming, when did you come back?\u201dIt was a girl\u2019s voice. It was pleasant to the ears and sounded just like the ringing of 100 bells.Su Ming stopped and turned around. When he saw her, his gaze softened. The owner of the voice was a slightly big girl. She was covered entirely in thick hide and her long hair was tied together with a grass string. There were two exquisitely made bone earrings hanging off her ears. Her skin was a little rough but it did not hide her beauty.Her eyes were big like giant puddles of water but they were clear, showing off her innocence. There was happiness in her eyes as she walked briskly towards Su Ming.\u201cI came back yesterday.\u201d Su Ming smiled. She was the person who cleaned his house regularly when he was away \u2013 Chen Xin. Suddenly, Su Ming froze on as he looked behind her.She was not alone. There was a young man in his late teens following her. The young man was big in build and he looked even sturdier than Lei Chen. He only wore a thin beast skin shirt in the winter. His hair was messy but not dirty. His sharp jaw line gave him a prideful air.His eyes especially, looked like stars. It was as though something strange shone from within his eyes. He gave off an oppressive air and kept others on edge when they were around him. He was like a wild beast.He stood there with a huge bow slung across his back. His gaze felt like arrows as he looked at Su Ming.\u201cSu Ming!\u201d\u201cBei\u2026 Bei Ling\u2026\u201d Su Ming looked at the young man and spoke respectfully as a complicated look flitted through his eyes.The young man before him was the strongest among their generation in the Dark Mountain Tribe. Even the elder mentioned that he could not hope to win against the talent that he had. Lei Chen was the only one who could somewhat compete against him after he Awakened.As the strongest of the younger generation in the tribe, the speed of his training was incredibly fast. Su Ming once overheard the elder saying that he was the one who held the most promise to break through the Blood Solidification Realm and become one of the few to reach the legendary Awakening Realm!His name also was also known throughout the other tribes around them. Even Wind Stream Tribe had heard of him and they sent messengers to take him away to be trained in their tribe. Su Ming did not expect to see him.His feelings towards Bei Ling were complicated because when he was young, Bei Ling had taken care of him like an older brother. Even his skills with the bow were taught by Bei Ling. Bei Ling was after all, the head of all the children in the tribe. His archery skills were no laughing matter.However all of this changed when Chen Xin was 12 years old. Perhaps it was because Chen Xin and Su Ming were too close, that was why Bei Ling started looking at Su Ming oddly and suspiciously. His looks became cold and distant later on. Bei Ling even chose to ignore him when they met.It was not until much later when Su Ming learned that the tribe leader and Bei Ling\u2019s father had already made arrangements for Chen Xin and Bei Ling to be engaged\u2026Su Ming wanted to explain himself but his words were rewarded with a cold look. Eventually, he could only sigh regretfully and started distancing himself from Chen Xin.He understood his own position. He knew that he was only a normal member of the tribe. He also knew that if it were not for the elder, he may not have even been accepted into the tribe.Su Ming was an abandoned baby whom the elder adopted when he went out on a journey dozens of years ago. The members of the tribe were kind towards him but it did not change the fact that he did not belong.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me you came back? I went to look for you a few times but you weren\u2019t there.\u201d Chen Xin scrunched up her nose and complained.Su Ming touched his nose and avoided Chen Xin\u2019s gaze. He only treated Chen Xin as a sister and harbored no other feelings for her. He did not want Bei Ling, who had been kind towards him to continue misunderstanding.\u201cBei Ling, when did you come back?\u201d Su Ming looked towards Bei Ling, who exuded a powerful air. He could feel an endless amount of Qi coming from Bei Ling\u2019s body. The strength of his Qi was the strongest he had seen after the elder and the leaders in the tribe.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe fierce pride he felt from the other was also as strong as his Qi. It made Su Ming feel like suffocating just by standing before him.\u201cYesterday.\u201d Bei Ling\u2019s gaze was as usual. It was cold and he spoke little like he wanted it done and over with quickly. He turned and looked towards Chen Xin standing by his side.\u201cXin, didn\u2019t you want to collect some herbs for your mother? Let\u2019s go.\u201d As Bei Ling spoke, he held Chen Xin\u2019s hand and walked past Su Ming. Then he pushed the door to the herbal storage open and went in.Chen Xin wanted to say something but after a brief moment of hesitation, she chose not to. Instead, she nodded at Su Ming and followed Bei Ling into the building.Su Ming stood there silently. After a while, he sighed and went in as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was also very neat inside. There were a lot of neatly arranged shelves with all sorts of herbs properly categorizedThere was a smaller room located further into the building. The herbs in there were different from the ones in the outer room. They were specifically prepared for Berserkers and a normal member of the tribe was not allowed to go in there.Even a common healer would require permission from the tribe leader or the elder to go into this room. It was viewed as an extremely important room in the entire Dark Mountain Tribe.However, all these rules did not apply to Su Ming. The elder gave Su Ming a special position in the tribe since a long time ago and he could go into the room at will to learn how to identify all the herbs in there.When he stepped into the building, Su Ming saw Bei Ling holding Chen Xin\u2019s hand. They walked towards the small room with all the precious herbs. There was an old man sitting cross-legged outside the door. The old man wore a robe made of beast skin. He was thin, his hair was white and his face was covered in wrinkles. He originally had his eyes closed but he opened them slightly to receive the introduction letter from Bei Ling and Chen Xin. He cast a glance at it then, closed his eyes once more.Su Ming walked slowly. He knew that Bei Ling did not want to see him. So, he chose to remain silent and did not follow them into the small room. Instead, he chose to walk towards the shelves outside and look at the large amount of herbs on the shelves. He was familiar with all of them. He had practically collected all of the herbs there before.Bei Ling and Chen Xin had not come out of the room even after Su Ming had finished looking at all the herbs outside. Su Ming hesitated for a while then, he began to pace outside the room slowly.\u201cYoung La Su, what are you wondering about?\u201d As Su Ming was deep in thought, an old and wizened voice traveled into his ears. He lifted his head and saw that the old man guarding the small room was speaking to him.\u201cGrandpa Nan Song, I\u2019m not a La Su anymore\u2026\u201d Su Ming scratched his head and smiled.\u201cI remember now. The La Sus of your generation have completed the Initiation a few months ago. Looks like I can\u2019t call you young La Su anymore.\u201d The old man grinned as his eyes twinkled with kindness.\u201cSince you\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you go in? Don\u2019t be scared, I have your back! I even dared to compete against the elder for a woman in the past. I\u2019m not afraid of anything!\u201d The old man winked at him and joked.Su Ming widened his eyes. It was the first time he heard about this. After a moment of hesitation, he smiled bitterly and went into the small room.He was not hesitating because of Chen Xin as the old man had suggested rather, he was hesitating because of Bei Ling, whom he was indebted to. He did not know how to explain himself. Many years had passed since then and the man was still cold towards him.\u2018It\u2019s fine\u2026\u2019 Su Ming sighed. The moment he opened the door to the small room, he saw Bei Ling with his powerful presence. He was standing beside Chen Xin, who was choosing herbs in the room. He turned around and glared at him.Su Ming met his gaze and went towards a shelf on the other side. He chose to ignore the two and started searching for the herbs required to create Mountain Spirit.When Chen Xin saw Su Ming, she looked as if she wanted to say something. After hesitating for a while, she again chose not to speak. As she grew up, she began to understand a lot of things. She also understood her relationship with Bei Ling. The love she felt for Su Ming since she was young was dying away as time passed.\u2018Night Marrow Grass\u2026\u2018Thousand Leaf Flower\u2026\u2019Su Ming slowly walked around the room. He swept his gaze across the precious herbs and finally found the two herbs he needed to create Mountain Spirit.\u2018It\u2019s a pity I don\u2019t have the last one\u2026\u2019He had looked through all of the herbs in the room and was deep in thought.Chen Xin and Bei Ling had also finished choosing the herbs they wanted. Once Chen Xin bade farewell to Su Ming, she was dragged away by Bei Ling. Before he left, Bei Ling stopped. He did not turn back but spoke calmly.\u201cThese herbs are useless to you since you don\u2019t have a Berserker Body! Instead of wasting them, you should leave it for the other tribe members. Know your place.\u201d Once he finished speaking, Bei Ling took Chen Xin away.Su Ming kept quiet. As he lifted his head to look at the two people leaving, he did not speak. Instead, he looked at all the herbs in the room once more. Then he took the two herbs he needed and left the room.The old man sitting outside the room did not mind Su Ming taking the herbs from the room. On the contrary, he looked at Su Ming in amusement.\u201cGrandpa Nan Song\u2026 it\u2019s not what you think\u2026\u201d Su Ming touched his nose.\u201cWhat would I be thinking about? I wasn\u2019t even talking about the complicated relationship between you and the two young La Sus. I absolutely wasn\u2019t.\u201d The old man laughed.Su Ming blushed lightly, feeling a little awkward. An idea suddenly crossed his mind and he squatted down to look at the old man.\u201cGrandpa Nan Song, did you happen to see this herb before?\u201d As Su Ming spoke, he drew the picture of an herb on the ground.The old man smiled and looked at the drawing. He sank into deep thought, then tapped his forehead lightly after a while.\u201cIsn\u2019t this the Cloud Gauze Grass? We don\u2019t have this herb in Dark Mountain. It can only grow in a special environment. Only Wind Stream Tribe sells this herb around the area. Why do you need it?\u201d\u201cI read about it in one of the elder\u2019s scrolls. I\u2019ve tried looking for it in Dark Mountain but I couldn\u2019t find it. So that\u2019s how it is.\u201d Understanding dawned on Su Ming\u2019s face.\u201cOf course not. This is an herb suitable for lower-leveled Berserkers in the Blood Solidification Realm. It\u2019s just that they\u2019re sold at a high price in Wind Stream Tribe. If you want it, you can ask the elder to bring you to the trading square located just outside Wind Stream Tribe. There are all sorts of herbs sold there.\u201d The old man shook his head and smiled.Su Ming\u2019s interest was piqued. He asked a few more questions, then rose up and left after bidding farewell to the old man. The old man looked at him with teasing eyes as he departed.When he left the herbal storage, Su Ming sank into his thoughts as he walked through the snow.\u201cWind Gauze Grass\u2026 I can obtain the other herbs for Mountain Spirit myself but as for Wind Gauze Grass\u2026 Grandpa Nan Song said that it\u2019s really expensive\u2026 Haa.\u201d Su Ming frowned. He searched through his pockets and found nothing besides a few stone coins he obtained from Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s Yu Chi.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey usually employed the barter system within the tribe and rarely used money. Once they left the tribe though, they would need to use stone coins to buy items.Stone coins were coins made from a special type of stone. There was an unspoken rule that they could only be created in big tribes. If any of them were created illegally, the person and his tribe would face destruction by the hands of the big tribes.After he searched through his entire body, Su Ming only managed to find 3 stone coins. All of them belonged to the dead Yu Chi. As for Su Ming himself, he did not own a single coin.\u2018I don\u2019t have coins. How am I supposed to buy them\u2026? If only I had 100\u2026 no, 1,000 stone coins\u2026 As for the square, I know the approximate location since the elder mentioned it before. Once any members of the tribe become Berserkers, they can go there in pairs. The location of the square isn\u2019t far either\u2026\u2019Su Ming laughed bitterly. He felt the beginnings of a headache forming in his head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he gritted his teeth, slung a basket over his back and left the tribe. Lei Chen went with him. Lei Chen had gone to the square before. He went there just a few days ago, in fact. Once he heard that Su Ming wanted to borrow some stone coins, he immediately pestered him for the reason. Once he learned of the reason, he immediately perked up and offered to act as Su Ming\u2019s guide.\u201cSu Ming, those two were the only stone coins I had. I went through a lot of trouble to get them.

How could you be like this?!\u201d Su Ming felt slightly guilty but he still glared at Lei Chen, causing Lei Chen to mumble under his breath.\u201cI really went through a lot of trouble to get them\u2026\u201d Lei Chen scratched his head. As he mumbled, he seemed to remember something and looked at Su Ming oddly.\u201cSay, I just remembered. What are you going to buy at the square with the stone coins?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m buying Cloud Gauze Grass!\u201d Su Ming ran through the forest lithely, showing signs of overtaking Lei Chen with his speed.\u201cWhat is Cloud Gauze Grass?\u201d Lei Chen asked honestly. However, when he found that Su Ming had already overtaken him, he immediately took a few wide leaps to catch up.\u201cSu Ming, you have to remember to return them to me\u2026\u201d\u201cSu Ming, it took me a lot of years to save up those coins\u2026\u201d\u201cSu Ming, not even my father knows about them.

I\u2019ve been asking you the entire day!\u201dSu Ming\u2019s ears rang with Lei Chen\u2019s voice throughout the entire journey. He knew for a long time that Lei Chen liked to talk. Once he started, there was no stopping him but he did not expect him to keep talking for the entire journey.When dusk arrived, they had already traveled some distance away from the tribe settlement. Within the unfamiliar forest, Su Ming\u2019s stamina finally ran dry and he began to slow down until he reached a huge tree. He leaned against it to catch his breath. Then he turned and looked at Lei Chen as if he wanted nothing to do with him. Lei Chen was also panting heavily while he sat down on the ground.\u201cSu\u2026 Su Ming\u2026 You\u2026 have to\u2026 give it back\u2026 to me\u2026\u201d Lei Chen was panting heavily but when he saw Su Ming looking back at him, he immediately straightened up and repeated himself.\u201cI\u2019ll return it\u2026 I\u2019ll definitely return it\u2026 but you have to promise me something!\u201d Su Ming laughed wryly. He already did not know what to say for Lei Chen to shut up.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Lei Chen blinked his eyes. His expression was that of a simple-minded person.\u201cDon\u2019t look at me like that. Even Xiao Hong looks more convincing than you. Lei Chen, I know what you want to ask but I can\u2019t tell you. You\u2019ll know later.\u201d Su Ming glared at him. He grew up with this person and it would not be an exaggeration to say that he understood Lei Chen more than his parents.Lei Chen appeared to be an honest and simple-minded person but he was actually pretty sensitive. A lot of people were fooled by the honest look on his face and tended to ignore the slyness in his eyes.After he heard Su Ming, Lei Chen touched his nose and laughed boyishly.\u201cMy request is simple. If you don\u2019t make a sound during the trip, once I finish my business and we come back, I\u2019ll tell you everything you want to know!\u201d Then Su Ming gave Lei Chen a long, hard look.Lei Chen froze as if his entire body was petrified. He did not move but his eyes were wide open as he stared at Su Ming.\u201cLei Chen\u2026\u201d Su Ming laughed wryly. He played together with his friend growing up. He was not going to be fooled by his little trick.\u201cYou were the one who told me to be quiet. I wanted to nod my head but if I did then there\u2019d be rustling sounds. I\u2019m just fulfilling my end of the promise! I\u2019m not even moving and I\u2019m not making any sound. It completely suits your idea of silence! Aren\u2019t I being quiet enough?!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to be quiet, right? Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be like this during the entire journey. I won\u2019t make any sound. But if I make any sound when I run, you can\u2019t blame me, I\u2026\u201d\u201cStop! Enough! Just keep quiet!\u201d Su Ming pinched the bridge of his nose. He saw a hint of playfulness in Lei Chen\u2019s eyes and he knew his friend was doing it on purpose.\u201cFine, I\u2019ll tell you. I have a Berserker Body but it\u2019s hidden by the elder\u2019s Berserker Art. Don\u2019t tell anyone about this.\u201d As he spoke, Su Ming\u2019s face became deadly grave.Lei Chen was stunned but he soon nodded solemnly.\u201cIf I knew, I wouldn\u2019t have asked. I just wanted to know whether you\u2019ve become a Berserker Practitioner. Now, I\u2019m no longer worried. Haha, from now on, we\u2019ll become the future guardians of Dark Mountain Tribe!\u201dSu Ming laughed as well. They took a moment to replenish their strength and continued on their way. The sky gradually darkened, the moon rose in the sky and the stars shone. The snow on the ground became thicker, too and the winter wind blew against their faces. Still, they continued their journey without stopping. They even talked to each other on the way, creating an amiable atmosphere.\u201cI saw Bei Ling today. I feel so frustrated when I see him, especially when he has Chen Xin by his side. He knows that Chen Xin likes you!\u201d Lei Chen grumbled angrily.\u201cHe\u2019s changed so much after just going to Wind Stream Tribe for a few years. Has he already forgotten that he\u2019s from of Dark Mountain Tribe? You didn\u2019t see his face that time. He even nagged me about all sorts of things!\u201dSu Ming was silent.\u201cSu Ming, I\u2019ll definitely surpass him!\u201d Lei Chen clenched his fists as he ran.\u201cHe\u2019s Bei Ling, our older brother. He took care of us when we were younger. Don\u2019t you recall him teaching you all he knew about training in the Ways of the Berserkers last time? He was even punished by the elder for that!\u201d\u201cHe even taught me how to use the bow\u2026\u201d Su Ming spoke calmly.\u201cAs for Chen Xin, I already told you ages ago. I only see her as a sister, nothing else\u2026 Why are you still thinking about all these weird things?\u201d Su Ming\u2019s voice was still calm.Lei Chen wanted to continue speaking but he saw how calm Su Ming was, so he swallowed all his words back. He understood Su Ming just as much as Su Ming understood him.He knew that Su Ming was a grateful man.\u201cSu Ming, people change\u2026\u201d Lei Chen spoke softly after a long while.\u201cAs we grow up, as we experience more things, we will change\u2026 Perhaps one day, I will change\u2026 and I think, you will as well\u2026\u201d Lei Chen muttered.\u2018Will I..?\u2019As Su Ming ran, he fell silent.When the sky became dark completely, Su Ming and Lei Chen stopped. Traveling at night was exceptionally troublesome. Besides, there was still some distance left before they reached the square. As such, they set up camp under a big tree for the night. They took shifts so that one of them could sit down to train while the other kept watch.Su Ming leaned against the tree and his gaze fell upon Lei Chen, who sat down with his legs crossed. His body began glowing red and he could see a lot of red lines emerging from his body.After watching Lei Chen for some time, Su Ming looked at the dark sky. The moon shone brightly and it looked beautiful as it hung in the sky with a curtain of stars. Yet, it made people feel small and insignificant when they lifted their heads and looked up.\u2018People change\u2026 Will I\u2026 change too..?\u2018Su Ming gazed quietly as he recalled all the times he spent together with Bei Ling when he was still a child.\u2018If I do change some day\u2026 how will I change\u2026?\u2019Uncertainty appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. This was too complicated a question for a 16 year old teenager.\u2018Perhaps I\u2019ll be like the elder and become a really strong Berserk Healer. I\u2019ll bring Xiao Hong on a journey around the world. We\u2019ll go to places we have never been to before, we\u2019ll go to all the tribes in the world and cure lots of the members of the Berserker Tribe\u2026\u2018Perhaps, I\u2019ll even become an elder\u2026 Then I\u2019ll find a girl I like and live with her. She\u2019ll go on a journey with me until we grow old together\u2026 Xiao Hong will become Old Hong by then\u2026 I\u2019ll talk about all of my experiences with the La Sus in the tribe\u2026 just like how the elder spoke to us about his life\u2026\u2019Su Ming smiled. It was a pure, honest and happy smile.\u2018Or perhaps\u2026 I\u2019ll get to know my parents\u2026\u2019Su Ming sighed as he smiled.\u201cLei Chen, I won\u2019t change!\u201d Su Ming took a deep breath and spoke firmly under the moonlight on the vast plains belonging to the Berserker Tribe. He did so even though he was the only one who could hear it.He was certain of his words just like any young man who still believed in a bright future\u2026Night went by. When dawn arrived, Su Ming and Lei Chen woke up as light gradually lit up the sky. They washed their faces with the snow. The cold snow made them shiver and shocked them wide awake.\u201cIf we travel according to our original route, we\u2019ll reach the square by noon.\u201d Lei Chen had already gone to the square a few times before. He rubbed away the snow on his face as he spoke to Su Ming.Su Ming nodded. After they washed up, they continued running in the forest as they welcomed the first rays of sunlight.Their journey went on without problems. When noon arrived, Su Ming saw a lot of houses made of grass and wood at the edge of the forest. There were also a lot of noises coming from the tribal settlement. Some Berserkers from the tribe were also patrolling the vicinity.\u201cWe\u2019re here!\u201d Lei Chen looked towards Su Ming particularly at the woven basket on his back. However, the basket was covered firmly with hides. He could not tell what was in there.Su Ming looked at the tribe square before him. It was big. Its size was comparable to the size of a small tribe but there were no fences around it. There were only several strong looking men patrolling the area in full alertness. They maintained the peace in the area and prevented wild beasts from attacking.At the center of the square was a gigantic purple tent made of beast skins. The security was extremely tight and no one was allowed near it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat house belongs to the owner of the square. I heard that he\u2019s a really strong Berserker. He will only appear to welcome tribe leaders from other tribes.\u201d Lei Chen spoke to Su Ming softly as they moved out of the forest towards the square.Su Ming only cast a glance at the purple tent before looking away. He stepped into the unfamiliar place under the guards\u2019 scrutinizing eyes.At that moment, a girl\u2019s voice called out to them coldly.\u201cLei Chen!\u201dSu Ming paused in the middle of his footsteps and discovered that Lei Chen immediately shuddered when he heard the voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was as if he was afraid and could do nothing about it. Su Ming looked towards the direction of the voice subtly.Su Ming was stunned!The person who spoke was a girl. She wore a small shirt made of mink fur, and she seemed to be slightly taller than the frail-looking Su Ming. Her tall stature and her shirt managed to show off the curves of her body. Her skin was not rough like her fellow members of the Berserker Tribe, but fair. She possessed a sort of beauty that would make others attracted to her.Her black hair was held together by a red string made of grass. There were two little braids by her ears and the rest of her hair was left flowing behind her head. It swayed along with the wind as it blew, adding to her beauty.Her eyes were like puddles of clear water and there was a cold fierceness within her eyes. There were beads of shiny droplets on her forehead, which became even more brilliant as they reflected the snow on the ground.Her two white canines could be vaguely seen as the girl exhaled and they added a sort of wildness to the girl.She was not a normal girl. She was just like Su Ming, a Berserker. However, the strength of Qi she released gave Su Ming the impression that she was only at the third level of the Blood Solidification Realm.She was not alone. There were three other men from the Berserker Tribe behind her. They were built like little hills. Their gazes were cold as they stared at Su Ming and Lei Chen. The strength of their Qi was only slightly weaker than Bei Ling\u2019s.There seemed to be markings painted on the three big men. As Su Ming looked at them subtly, he noticed that the markings looked like scorpions.\u201cLei Chen, how dare you!\u201d The girl gritted her teeth as she glared at Lei Chen.Lei Chen touched his nose and the usual honest, simple-minded look settled once more on his face as he laughed in a silly manner.\u201cI was tricked by that dumb look of yours the last time and I got a stupid, dyed herb! Which you sold to me for three stone coins!!!\u201d The girl marched towards Lei Chen, her face red with anger.\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me for that. I didn\u2019t know what herb it was so, I just placed it at a random place. You were the one who wanted to buy it\u2026\u201d Lei Chen mumbled as though he was wronged.\u201cHmph, give me the stone coins!\u201d The girl glared at Lei Chen. Su Ming was also hated on because he was standing beside Lei Chen but he looked weak and fragile so, she ignored him once she took a glance at him.\u201cBut I\u2026\u201d Lei Chen smiled wryly. He was about to speak but the girl immediately glared at him coldly. The three men behind her also looked at him with a fierce glare. He swallowed his words and could only complain about the situation in his head.\u201cLei Chen, is she the one from Dark Dragon Tribe whom you and the elder spoke of?\u201d Su Ming spoke slowly, his face void of expression.The moment his words left his mouth, Lei Chen was stunned for a moment but quickly reacted. He knew that Su Ming had always been calm. If he said something, it meant that he would help. Besides, he knew Su Ming. The moment he heard Su Ming speaking so oddly, he immediately understood his intentions and stood behind Su Ming. He treated Su Ming as if he was his leader.\u201cYes, Young Lord. That is the girl I spoke of!\u201d Lei Chen\u2019s gaze was respectful as he spoke with his head bowed.Lei Chen\u2019s actions and words immediately caused the girl to shift her gaze to Su Ming. She was surprised. The title of Young Lord was usually given to the future elders of the tribe. She looked at Su Ming closely but no matter what, he only gave off the feeling of a normal Berserker Tribe member. Hence, her countenance became fierce as she spoke in a coldly.\u201cI don\u2019t care whether you\u2019re the Young Lord. Return my stone coins!\u201d\u201cFine! I\u2019ll give you the stone coins. But I came with Lei Chen here today to find you!\u201d Lei Chen was calm as he took out three stone coins from his bosom with his right hand.\u201cGive me the herb you bought from Lei Chen\u201d Su Ming looked at the girl and spoke slowly.The girl was stunned. She did not expect to get her stone coins back so easily. She grew suspicious as her gaze fell upon Su Ming and Lei Chen.\u201cWhat herb is that?\u201d After a moment of hesitation, she did not reach out for the stone coins instead she chose to question.\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d Lei Chen was about to speak when a stern voice cut him off.\u201cQuiet!\u201d Su Ming glared at Lei Chen. It made Lei Chen shudder and lower his head respectfully.When she saw his compliance, the girl blinked in confusion. She hesitated briefly and took out a purple herb. The herb looked normal. The only difference was that it was completely purple, which made it look terrifying.When she brought out the herb, she immediately handed it to Su Ming but she kept her eyes fixed on his face. When she saw Su Ming\u2019s eyes light up and how he lifted his hand as if he could not wait to grab onto the herb, the girl laughed and retracted her hand.\u201cWhat are you doing?! This is my herb. I bought it! Are you trying to snatch my herb?\u201d The girl wrinkled her nose and clicked her tongue.\u201cGirl, do you still want the stone coins?\u201d Su Ming was surprised but he quickly frowned.\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want it? But I just thought about something, if you can show me proof that you are Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s Young Lord, then I\u2019ll return the herb to you.\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes were cunning. Her slyness only made her wild presence stronger.Even Su Ming felt his heart race but he kept his expressions as bland as possible.Su Ming was quiet. As he looked at the girl, he took a deep breath. He raised his left hand and the sudden presence of Qi belonging to a second level Berserker of the Blood Solidification Realm spread from his right hand.\u201cIs this enough proof?\u201dThe sudden change instantly made the girl narrow her eyes. Even the three men behind her became serious.It was not hard to understand why they were suddenly wary. Su Ming was until a moment ago, just a normal person. There was not even a hint of Qi from him. The sudden difference caught them all off guard.\u201cYoung Master, a strong Berserker must have cast an Art on him. That is why the presence of his Qi is hidden. The Berserker is also much more powerful than us or else it would not have been impossible for us to detect it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I\u2019ve been watching for a long time and I didn\u2019t detect anything. The only person who can do this is the elder of Dark Mountain Tribe\u2026\u201d The three men standing behind the girl whispered softly into her ear.The girl lowered her head and looked at the purple herb in her hands. She hesitated. It had been some time since she bought the herb. She even spent a lot of time persuading Lei Chen to give her the herb. She had thought it was an unknown item and wanted to ask her elder about it. However on the second day, she found that the purple tinge had spread to her hands. It was obvious that it was dyed.The discovery made her angry. Deeply offended, she brought the herb to the square to try and find Lei Chen again.Just as she hesitated, Su Ming spoke in a frustrated manner.\u201cI\u2019ve already shown you proof. Are you breaking your promise? These are the three stone coins\u2026 whatever, I\u2019ll give you five stone coins!\u201d Su Ming gritted his teeth and took out another two stone coins, passing all of them to the girl.\u201cFive stone coins for the herb!\u201dThe girl blinked. He managed to identify that she was from Dark Dragon Tribe immediately, so it was clear that Lei Chen told him about it. Besides, he also mentioned the elder of Dark Mountain Tribe\u2026\u201cThen it\u2019s true! This is a rare item!\u201d The girl showed a pleased expression and shook her head.\u201cSo what? So what if I break my promise? This is mine. If you want to get it back, give me 30 stone coins!\u201d When she saw the bitter look on Su Ming\u2019s face and the dismal look on Lei Chen\u2019s face, she became even more proud of herself. She turned around, snorted and quickly left the place.The three men quickly followed her and left the square.When the four of them went away, the dismal look on Lei Chen\u2019s face disappeared almost instantly. He smiled boyishly at Su Ming and touched his nose.\u201cSu Ming, how did you know she was from Dark Dragon Tribe?\u201d\u201cSo you had three stone coins? There\u2019s still one more, right? Give it!\u201d Su Ming looked at Lei Chen and put away the stone coins as he spoke slowly.\u201cNo way! That\u2026 I bought something with that stone coin last time\u2026 Um, I still have something to do. Let\u2019s leave it for now. We\u2019ll split up for now. I\u2019ll wait for you here later at night. We\u2019ll go back to the tribe then.\u201d Lei Chen felt his eye twitch and immediately spoke up. He did not even wait for Su Ming to reply. He ran away quickly and disappeared into the bustling square.As he watched Lei Chen escape, Su Ming shook his head. If he was not too poor, he would not have revealed that he had Qi. The elder\u2019s Berserker Art was extremely powerful. If Su Ming refused to reveal it, no one would have been able to see it.However if he did not do it, not only did Lei Chen have to return the stone coins to the girl, Su Ming himself would have needed to give up his stone coins too.\u201cHa\u2026 Looks like I\u2019ll really have to do this\u2026\u201d Su Ming scratched his head and headed towards the square, troubled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe square bustled with activity. Within the tents were plenty of people trading with each other and there were some who had spread hides on the snow. There, they placed various herbs as well as items for trade as they sat on the ground waiting for someone to buy their wares.It was Su Ming\u2019s first time there. Everything was new to him. As he walked through the square, he saw a lot of items he had never seen before. Among them were bones from beasts and all sorts of weird herbs. There were even a couple of refined medicinal potions being sold.\u201cThey even sell Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva here, and one bottle is worth one stone coin!\u201d Su Ming faltered in his footsteps when he saw that Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva was sold as an item. It was on one of the hides on the ground beside him. He blinked in surprise.\u201cI\u2019ve been drinking Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva\u2026 since I was young\u2026 just how many stone coins was that worth?! Xiao Hong also drank a lot of it\u2026\u201d Su Ming was just about to leave, mumbling when he caught the glimpse of something on one of the hides not far away.\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d Su Ming took a deep breath and went towards it. He cast a glance at the owner of the stall. He was an old man in his 50s. He wore a loose hide shirt and sat still with his legs crossed atop the snow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a hint of shock in his eyes but after he looked at him carefully, he closed his eyes again.Su Ming eyed a blue object placed on the hide. The object was shaped like a plate. The edges were sharp but there were a few cracks on it. There was even a deep cut on it, making it look like the object had been pierced through.It laid quietly on the mat but would let out a faint glow occasionally. Anyone who saw it would have thought that it was alive.The cracks seemed to form a drawing. It was the drawing of a terrifying face and it was frightening to look at.\u201cThis is an incomplete Berserker Vessel. You won\u2019t be able to afford it.\u201d As Su Ming was looking at it, he heard an old and wizened voice. Su Ming lifted his head and looked at the old man, who spoke.\u201cBerserker Vessel?\u201d Su Ming sucked in a breath. He had suspected it. He had read about it before in the beast skin scrolls. Berserker Vessels were extremely rare items. Only the powerful Berserkers in the Awakening Realm could obtain one or make one. As for the people in the Blood Solidification Realm, it was difficult for them to obtain it. Even if they had one, it was usually an inheritance within the tribe. There also had to be people in the tribe who were capable of guarding the Vessel from being taken away by Berserkers in the Awakening Realm.\u201cThis vessel is already broken. You can\u2019t use it. But since it was made by a Berserker in the Awakening realm, it\u2019s still worth 1,000 stone coins.\u201d The old man spoke slowly.As Su Ming stared at the blue plate, his gaze was filled with longing and envy. He only had 5 coins with him, so he could not afford it.He sighed. Su Ming looked at the blue plate again and left reluctantly.\u2018I wonder when I\u2019ll ever have my very own Berserker Vessel\u2026 \u2018Su Ming thought as he wandered through the square. There were a lot of people who opened up shop by selling items on hides. However, even after Su Ming went around the place, he did not see anyone else selling Berserker Vessels.He did however find some Cloud Gauze Grass being sold. It was just that they were all sold by different people. The price for one was rather expensive. Just one alone was sold at the price of one stone coin, which was the same price as Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva.It was beginning to grow dark. The sun was setting in the sky and the light cast a red glow on land. Yet, there were even more people gathered at the square and it continued to bustle with activity.As he looked at the sky, Su Ming decided to continue walking around. He even went into one of the tents. The tent was also a shop. The price for each item was expensive but at least the quality of each could be guaranteed. There were quite a lot of people going in and out of the tents.As Su Ming watched, he saw some members of the Berserker Tribe who were the same as him. They were also carrying baskets on their backs as they went into the tents to sell the contents within to the tent owners.When Su Ming saw this, he smiled. He had been observing since noon and he saw a lot of things. After he pieced up all the details he obtained, he understood most of the rules there.As the sky darkened almost completely and torches were lit around the square, Su Ming went to a corner where the light did not shine.He looked at his surroundings carefully before quickly putting down his basket. He wrapped the hides on the basket around his body and put on all the other hides he had prepared in the basket. Finally, he brought out a black beast skin that looked like a robe and wore it, covering up his whole body.Su Ming\u2019s face could no longer be seen. From the size of his body, he looked swollen. He looked completely different from his frail self.He shook his limbs slightly, then he wrapped the beast skins even tighter around himself. Su Ming took a look at the basket. There was still one more thing in the basket. It was something he prepared specifically for this trip. It was heavy but it had its uses.He swung the basket over his back and lowered his head. He stopped after taking a few steps forward. Then he hunched his back before quickly walking towards a tent he had chosen a while ago.The light in the tent was dark. Since noon, the people who went into this tent were mostly like Su Ming. They hid their faces so that no one could recognize them.It may have been Su Ming\u2019s first time at the square but he had been observing the proceedings since noon. As such, he had already understood most of the rules of the square. He did not immediately enter the tent he chose. Instead, he paced about outside the tent for a while as he looked at the tent occasionally.Before long, a person dressed in a similar fashion as Su Ming came out from the tent and left the square in a hurry.Su Ming had seen a lot of people like this since noon. He was somewhat certain that once he left, no one would chase after him. He opened the flap and went into the then empty tent quickly without any hesitation.Once he entered the tent, he felt a gaze fall upon him. The person looking at him was a middle aged man. He was half nude and sitting cross-legged. There was a bonfire before him. As it lit up the tent, it crackled as it burned.One of the man\u2019s eyes was empty but the other gave off a sharp glint. He was watching Su Ming closely without a word.\u201cThe fire is quite dazzling.\u201d Since Su Ming was covered up by hides, he was not worried about the man seeing his face. He also spoke slowly with a hoarse voice and it was completely different compared to his normal one.The one-eyed man looked at Su Ming for a while before looking away. He felt no Qi from Su Ming and he did not look any different from the rest who came.He may not have felt Qi from Su Ming, but one who could enter the tent and seem so familiar with the rules could not have been just any normal person.He raised his right hand and pressed it on the bonfire. The bonfire immediately grew dimmer. The light from the bonfire became darker as well.\u201cTake it out. If it\u2019s good stuff, I\u2019ll give you a fair price.\u201d The man put out his right hand and spoke slowly.Su Ming scrutinized the man behind the hides that hid his face. Then all of a sudden, he laughed. His laughter was also hoarse as it echoed in the tent. It made the man frown.Just as he frowned, Su Ming raised his right hand. Immediately, a round object was thrown at the man as a medicinal scent spread in the air. The man caught it in his hands. When he saw it, his right eye shone brilliantly as he took in a sharp breath.\u201cHow much does this thing cost?\u201d Su Ming spoke hoarsely.\u201cWhat is this? Where did you get it? What are the effects of this thing?\u201d The man stared at the object in his hand for a while before looking at Su Ming seriously. A flash of curiosity appeared in his eyes.\u201cWhen I was on the way to the square, I saw this beast.\u201d Su Ming did not answer his question but chose to talk about something else. As he spoke, he put down the basket and grabbed something inside with his right hand. Immediately, the basket shook and Su Ming took out a mink raccoon that was tied up before placing it on the floor.The mink raccoon looked listless but there was a fierce glare within its eyes. There were wounds on its body that had not healed. It also could not escape because it was tied up.The man was stunned. It was clear that he did not know what Su Ming meant. His gaze fell on the mink raccoon for a while but he quickly looked away. It was just a normal beast. There was nothing about it that required his attention.\u201cI just caught it on a whim. Look, it\u2019s still alive\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s voice was slow and hoarse. Nonetheless, it sounded odd in the dim tent.\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dThe man frowned.\u201cI\u2019m saying that it\u2019s still alive. Do you know why I caught it? Because it was too curious. It had been following me for too long\u2026\u201d Su Ming raised his left hand and caressed the beast\u2019s fur. However, just as his hands swept through the wounds on the mink raccoon\u2019s body, it shivered!There were no cries, no screams. There was only a brief shudder before the mink raccoon\u2019s body turned into red mist as if its blood was burned. As the man looked at the scene dumbfounded, the mink raccoon\u2019s entire body disappeared. Only a pile of red and black bones were left behind.\u201cNow, it\u2019s dead\u2026\u201d Su Ming touched the pile of bones with his left hand and the bones immediately turned into dust which scattered on the ground.The man took a sharp breath and retreated a few steps instinctively. There was shock and fear in his eye which could not be concealed. After a moment, he once again turned towards Su Ming with fear and respect.\u201cFallen Berserker\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d Su Ming snorted.The man shivered and was about to explain himself when Su Ming waved his hand as though he was growing impatient.\u201cTell me how much that thing in your hands is worth! The effect of the item is simple. It will increase the effects of all the herbs you take while you train by one fold! As for the other question\u2026 you\u2019re too curious for your own good.\u201d Su Ming spoke slowly.The man\u2019s face grew pale. What he saw earlier shocked him. He did not even feel any Qi circulating from the person\u2019s body. Nevertheless, the beast turned into red mist right before his eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis thing\u2026\u201d The man took a moment to think as he looked at the round medicinal object in his hand.\u201cSir, I\u2019ve never seen this thing before in my life\u2026 This is\u2026\u201d The man spoke hesitantly. He never spoke this way to his normal customers but due to the shock of what he just saw, he did not dare offend the person before him.\u201cYou can try it out right now. If there are no effects, I\u2019ll leave. But if you can feel the effects, we can negotiate the price.\u201d Su Ming spoke calmly and slowly as he sat down.The man breathed out a sigh of relief and agreed to Su Ming\u2019s terms respectfully. He took out a bell from his bosom and shook it lightly. Immediately, the ringing of the bell filled the tent.There was an indescribable look in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He stole a glance at the bell and he tightened his left hand, which he kept hidden within the robe. There was still a bit of Scattering Blood Powder left in his left hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Qi within the man standing before him felt stronger than Lei Chen\u2019s. He was probably around the fifth or sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm.Su Ming could not hope to win against such a person. If the man decided to attack him, Su Ming would have had a hard time dodging it. However, he needed a large number Cloud Gauze Grass, which would require a lot of stone coins.Due to this, he had to take a risk. Besides, after he killed Yu Chi in the forest, he felt that his mindset had changed somewhat. The knowledge he obtained by reading the beast skin scrolls he got from the elder were now deeply ingrained in his mind.Somewhere in his mind, he thought that if he could not overpower the other party with his Qi, he could at least make his opponent hesitate. Then, his opponent would not act rashly.That was why he chose to disguise himself before going into the tent at first. Secondly, he brought the wild beast with him. All of it was to create shock at the right time.It seemed that his actions produced pretty good results but Su Ming was still nervous. He did not dare let his guard down.In truth, Su Ming was not the only nervous one in the tent. The man was possibly even more nervous than Su Ming. He would occasionally glance at the spot where the creature died. When he saw the pile of dust, his heart would race; not out of excitement, but out of fear.In the man\u2019s sight, the person before him, covered entirely in hides gave off an enigmatic air. It put a lot of pressure on the man especially with the shocking scene that happened just moments ago. The anxiety and nervousness he felt towards Su Ming was far stronger than what Su Ming felt towards him.This man is very experienced. He speaks calmly but he is a ruthless man. He must be a Fallen Berserker who went into hiding in one of the mountains\u2026 but from his mannerisms, he seems to be someone reasonable\u2026 But I don\u2019t think this weird medicine will be very strong.As the man was drowning in his own fears, there were footsteps outside the tent. Then, the flaps of the tent were lifted and a man walked in.The man\u2019s face was blank. When he walked into the tent, he did not say a word. He stood by the side waiting for the one-eyed man\u2019s orders.When the other man came in, Su Ming only cast him a glance. The presence of his Qi was not thick. He was the same as Su Ming. They were both practitioners at the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm.\u201cEat this and this as well!\u201d The one-eyed man did not hesitate and handed the pill along with an herb to the other man who just came in.The other man took the pill and the herb, his face still blank and swallowed it after a few bites. Then he sat down with his legs-crossed, circulating the Qi in his body. Very soon, his whole demeanor changed as if he was surprised. He opened his eyes before long and looked at the one-eyed man with uncertainty.\u201cThere aren\u2019t really any major effects\u2026 I just felt the effects of the Prime Spirit Grass increase\u2026 maybe about one fold.\u201dWhen the one-eyed man heard his words, he immediately narrowed his eyes as his heart hammered against his chest. He knew what the increase of effects for any herbal medicine by one fold would bring. If it was just a normal herb, the effects would not be obvious. However, if it was the sort of herb taken by Berserkers above the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm, the value of the pill would practically be immeasurable.\u2018For a normal herb worth 10 stone coins, this item would only be worth one stone coin. But if it were an herb that was worth 100 or 1,000 stone coins, the increased effect\u2026\u2019The one-eyed man grew more excited as he thought of the possibilities but he could not be sure that the item would have the same effect for higher-leveled herbs.\u2018It\u2019s a pity I don\u2019t have a lot of stone coins on my person\u2026\u2019He quelled his excitement and sent the other man away. Then he stood respectfully before Su Ming and forced a smile.\u201cSir, this medicine of yours is really mysterious. I\u2019ll give you 30 stone coins in exchange for one, how does that sound?\u201d The one-eyed man did not dare offend Su Ming. To him, Su Ming was a Fallen Berserker. If he could produce such a powerful medicine, he was definitely not a common Berserker Practitioner.\u201cThirty coins?\u201d The price offered made Su Ming\u2019s heart pound in excitement but he spoke with a colder voice instead.\u201cThis\u2026 Sir, 30 coins is my final offer. I can\u2019t even be sure whether this medicine works the same for higher-leveled herbs.\u201d The one-eyed man immediately explained himself but before he could finish, Su Ming cut him off.\u201cIf you consume this medicine, no matter what herb you take, the effects will increase by one-fold. If I didn\u2019t want to buy a Berserker Vessel, I wouldn\u2019t even sell this.\u201dThe one-eyed man struggled internally for a while before he gritted his teeth and nodded at Su Ming.\u201cHow many do you have?\u201d\u201cBesides the one you just ate, there\u2019s still one more!\u201d As Su Ming spoke, he produced a small bottle from his chest. There was only one Scattering Dust pill in the bottle.When the man heard this, he felt his heart twisting in pain at the loss of the first pill. As he hesitated, he saw Su Ming standing up and putting away the bottle. Then Su Ming lifted his hand which turned the small creature into red mist earlier. He was also glaring at him from behind the layers of hides that covered his face. The man immediately remembered that he wasted a pill as an experiment and quickly spoke up.\u201cSir, sir! This\u2026 50 coins! This is really all I can give you!\u201dSu Ming did not want to linger around for too long so, he spoke flatly, \u201cFine. Along with the pill you used just now, that\u2019ll be 100 stone coins!\u201dThe one-eyed man only hesitated for a short while before producing a beast skin pouch from his chest. He handed it to Su Ming respectfully. There were two white stone coins inside.The value of the stone coins were decided by their color. The gray ones were worth one each and one black coin was equivalent to 10 gray coins. As for the white coin, it was equivalent to 50 gray coins. If it was a purple coin, it was worth 100 gray coins.\u201cGive me black coins!\u201d Su Ming only glanced at the two coins before he spoke all of a sudden.The one-eyed man was taken aback but only for a moment. He did not ask any questions instead, he produced 10 black stone coins and gave them to Su Ming.After placing the stone coins into his pouch, Su Ming threw the little bottle to the man. He picked up the basket on the ground and left the tent without another glance at the man. Once he left the tent, Su Ming did not act immediately. He chose to walk around the square. The moon and stars were shining brightly in the sky and there were torches lit everywhere. Yet, there were still a lot of people at the square. However, most of the people who were shopping at that moment were all dressed up like Su Ming.He wandered around the square until he was sure no one was watching him. Then he went to the places selling Cloud Gauze Grass that he singled out in the morning and bought more than 60 of them. After that, he went to a more secluded place to change his attire. He left quickly and went to the place he promised to meet up with Lei Chen. Lei Chen was already at their meeting place, yawning up at the sky. Su Ming did not speak but walked past Lei Chen.Lei Chen was surprised but followed suit. Both of them disappeared into the forest soon and ran once they were in there. Su Ming even changed his path multiple times. He did not stop to rest until the sky started to darken the next day. Even then, his face was pale due to fear.Lei Chen was panting hard. He did not understand it but he chose not to ask. He especially decided to keep his silence when Su Ming threw five stone coins in his direction. Once he caught them, he laughed excitedly.They took a short break before Su Ming stood up once more. He ran with Lei Chen towards the direction of their tribe. He did not stop this time but ran at full speed. In fact, his speed seemed to increase with each step he took. His Qi might not have been as powerful as Lei Chen\u2019s, but in terms of speed, even Lei Chen struggled to keep up.\u2018I had a pretty good haul this time\u2026 I originally thought that if I could not sell the pills, I would experiment with five pieces of Cloud Gauze Grass first. I didn\u2019t expect things to go so smoothly.\u2019As Su Ming ran, he appeared to be deep in thought.The one-eyed man should be scared of me but I still can\u2019t let my guard down. I have to return to the tribe as soon as possible.Su Ming was careful all the way back to the tribe. They were far away from the square by then but they would still change their paths occasionally. Su Ming even used his experiences in the forest to erase their tracks.The sun lit up the sky but there was still some time before noon. Su Ming and Lei Chen caught sight of their tribe some distance away. When he saw the tribe, Su Ming finally relaxed. There was even a smile on his face.\u201cWe\u2019re finally back. Su Ming, you still haven\u2019t told me how you knew Bai Ling was a member of Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201d Lei Chen was gasping as he tried to catch his breath. As Su Ming slowed down, he grabbed the chance to ask him the one question that had been on his mind.\u201cBai Ling?\u201d The image of the tall and beautiful girl surfaced in Su Ming\u2019s head. He thought especially of the girl wrinkling her nose and looking at them with her bright eyes. She seemed feral but it was a wild sort of beauty.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that she was from Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201d Su Ming smiled. The girl named Bai Ling was the prettiest girl he had ever seen since he was young.\u201cNo way. If you didn\u2019t know, how did you manage to get it right in one go?\u201d Lei Chen had been thinking about it for a long time but he still could not get an answer. Now that Su Ming did not intend to tell him the answer, he became desperate.Su Ming took one look at Lei Chen and laughed out loud.\u201cLei Chen, you like her?\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Lei Chen shook his head fervently, then began mumbling under his breath.\u201cShe\u2019s too thin for my liking. I like those who are a bit on the plump side\u2026\u201d Lei Chen scratched his head. He had always liked women who were a little more built since he was young. Even now, it was still the same.Su Ming continued laughing and joking with Lei Chen as he ran back towards the tribe. The sounds of carefree laughter and camaraderie resounded in the cold winter.\u201cThe tattoos of the Dark Dragon were on the three men behind Bai Ling. The only ones who like painting Dark Dragons on their body around this area are the people from Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201d As they were near their tribe, Su Ming told Lei Chen between laughs.When Lei Chen heard the answer, he immediately laughed wryly. He did not expect the answer to be so simple.Su Ming and Lei Chen returned to their houses safely. As Su Ming brought out the Cloud Gauze Grass he bought, his eyes were bright with anticipation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018Mountain Spirit\u2026 I wonder what its effects are once I finish making it! The elder told me to not leave the tribe for the time being\u2026 I\u2019ll return as soon as possible. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be gone for long.\u2019Su Ming made his decision after he was deep in thought.At the same time Su Ming made his decision, something big happened at the square far away from Dark Mountain Tribe!The cause of it all was the round pill Su Ming created.Once Su Ming left, the one-eyed man pondered for a long time in his tent and refused to accept any more clients who wanted to trade with him. As he was thinking, he gritted his teeth. He quickly took the bottle containing the pill to the owner of the square, who resided in the large purple tent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he was called, he entered the tent respectfully. After an hour, he exited the tent with an ecstatic expression, his mannerisms still respectful as he left.Within the purple tent were two elderly men with completely white hair but their eyes still held a lot of life and vigor. Before them laid a very normal looking, empty small bottle.One of the old men who wore a white robe held a pill between his fingers. He looked at it for a while. Then slowly, his gaze was filled with surprise and uncertainty.He sank into deep thought for a moment after which he brought the pill to his nose and took a sniff. He closed his eyes in concentration. After a long moment, he opened his eyes abruptly.\u201cIt\u2019s just like he said. This pill has unbelievable effects! I\u2019ve been in Wind Stream Tribe for many years but I\u2019ve never seen such a thing in my life. By the looks of it, it doesn\u2019t seem to be a medicine made from a long time ago either. There isn\u2019t any sign of age on it so, it\u2019s clear that it has just been made recently!\u201d\u201cJust what is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity a long time has passed since the trade took place. The Fallen Berserker is not an easy person to deal with either or else we might get to know how this pill was made,\u201d the other old man spoke slowly.\u201cDon\u2019t be reckless. A person who can produce such an item is either a very powerful Berserker in the Blood Solidification Realm\u2026 or a Fallen Berserker at the Awakening Realm who came from somewhere else. Brother Zhou, let me take this thing back to the tribe. Perhaps the Elder in Wind Stream Tribe can identify it.\u201d As the old man in white spoke, he carefully placed the pill back into the small bottle. Then he waved his right hand and the small bottle disappeared.\u201cYou do that.\u201d The old man sitting before him nodded his head.\u201cThis item is too important. I\u2019ll be taking my leave first. If I get any information, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d The old man in white stood up. He then held his fist and palm together as a salute towards the old man called Zhou. He quickly left the purple tent. The moment he stepped out of the tent, the outline of his body became distorted. He turned into white mist and rose into the sky. Instantly, he disappeared.Daylight had almost arrived. On the vast plains some distance away from the square, was a big tribe. The size of the tribe was almost equivalent to the size of a city. It was surrounded by six other tribes the size of Dark Mountain Tribe. In the very middle was a big city made of stone and dirt!The city looked magnificent like a giant beast had arrived on the land. The citizens within the city alone numbered more than thousands. It was not something Dark Mountain Tribe could ever hope to overcome.The six surrounding tribes were affiliated with the city. Some of them were conquered by Wind Stream Tribe while some sought protection when some sort of disaster befell them and they became part of Wind Stream Tribe.Wind Stream Tribe was a medium sized tribe but it was still considered weak for a medium sized tribe. After all, Dark Mountain was located at a rather rural area in the world. However it was precisely because of that, Wind Stream Tribe could rule over the entire area and accept tributes offered by numerous smaller tribes. It was also the only tribe in Dark Mountain that was qualified to contact members of the Berserker Tribe belonging to the upper class.As the sun began to light up the sky, a white mist flew across the sky. It gathered outside the city and transformed into the old man in white.The old man looked solemn as he immediately walked into the city. On the way, he met other members of Wind Stream Tribe. All of them would stop and bow towards him respectfully.At the center of the city was a completely dark altar. The altar was built in the shape of a pentagon and was 100 feet tall. There was a drawing of a bird on it. The altar looked as if it was left behind since ancient times.The old man in white stood underneath the altar respectfully. After a moment, a gentle voice traveled from the top of the altar.\u201cShi Hai, what is it?\u201d\u201cElder, I was at Zhou Ran\u2019s square and saw a medication I\u2019ve never seen before. The effects of this herb are incredible\u2026\u201d The old man in white took a deep breath and spoke in a low voice.\u201cOh? Let me see it,\u201d the gentle voice spoke slowly from atop the altar.The old man in white lifted his right hand and bright light appeared from his palm. A small bottle materialized itself instantly. Then, as if there was some mysterious force attracting the small bottle, it floated upwards slowly towards the altar.It was quiet around the area. The only sounds were that of the wind passing by. The wind caused the old man\u2019s robes to flutter. He stood there, as still as a statue and waited silently.After a moment, the gentle voice spoke once again but this time, there was a tinge of surprise in it!\u201cThere\u2019s only one?\u201d\u201cOnly one,\u201d the old man in white replied immediately.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a medication like this before\u2026 The makeup of this medication is something I don\u2019t understand\u2026 And it\u2019s clear this was made not too long ago\u2026 Who brought this to the square?\u201d The gentle voice spoke solemnly.\u201cA Fallen Berserker,\u201d the old man in white spoke in a low tone.\u201cFind him. Use all the resources we have and find him! Tell him to join Wind Stream Tribe and I will treat him as a permanent guest here!\u201d The gentle voice exclaimed almost immediately after the old man spoke the last syllable.The old man in white took a deep breath and complied to the order respectfully. He could identify that the medicine was out of ordinary but he did not expect the Elder to invite the person to Wind Stream Tribe as a permanent guest. The status of a permanent guest was treated with extreme respect. Besides the tribe leader, the Elder and few other people, they were treated almost with the same importance as the other leaders of the tribe.As the old man in white went away, he immediately had the entire Wind Stream Tribe carry out the Elder\u2019s orders. He had cast a huge net to search for the Fallen Berserker!As for Su Ming, he had just made a decision at home in Dark Mountain Tribe. Hence in the morning of the second day, he left the tribe alone and went into the forest. Then, he ran towards Black Flame Mountain.Su Ming traversed through the forest without any hesitation. After reaching the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm, his speed and agility had increased so much even Lei Chen had a hard time keeping up with him at full speed. As he ran through the forest, his speed increased even further due to his familiarity with the place. By noon, he had arrived at the foot of Black Flame Mountain.He climbed up Black Flame Mountain and went to the cave which he used for the quenching of herbs. Su Ming placed the basket down on ground. There were a lot of herbs in there, all of which he prepared for the purpose of quenching.Xiao Hong was not in the cave. It was most probably out playing. Su Ming cast a glance around the cave. Once he was certain there were no signs of abnormality around, he sat down cross-legged on the ground. He concentrated on circulating the blood in his body until the 10 blood veins shone brightly on his body and his body reached the best condition possible.There were even vague signs of the 11th blood vein manifesting itself, which could allow Su Ming to reach the third level of the Blood Solidification Realm.\u2018The elder helped me to truly Awaken and he did say I was about to reach the third level\u2026 Not a lot of time passed since then but I feel that there\u2019s enough blood within me now\u2026 The ancient Berserker Art is truly amazing.\u2019Su Ming opened his eyes and the scene of the black substance oozing out of his body surfaced in his mind.\u2018I might as well put aside creating more pills for now and break through the second level!\u2019Su Ming only took a moment to make his decision and brought out the Sky Stone he pillaged the other day from his bosom. He took a look at the herb and swallowed a Scattering Dust before plucking a leaf from the herb and swallowing it as well.He closed his eyes and meditated once again. After a moment, Su Ming\u2019s body was covered in sweat and surrounded by blood red light. The 11th blood vein showed signs of manifesting completely.After a few hours, a muffled sound resounded throughout Su Ming\u2019s body and the 11th blood vein manifested itself completely. A much stronger presence of Qi immediately erupted from Su Ming\u2019s body.Su Ming opened his eyes, which shone brilliantly.\u2018The third level of the Blood Solidification Realm!\u2019He stood up, his face bright with excitement. After he moved his body to remove the numbness in his limbs, he brought out the herbs. He began the process of creating Mountain Spirit according to the methods in his memory.Su Ming was no longer as clueless as he was a few months ago. He was already familiar with the process of quenching herbs and even more so at controlling the fire in the cave. As the temperature within the cave increased, Su Ming took off his clothes and stood beside the stone cauldron half-naked. At times he would bring one of the herbs to his nose whereas other times, he would crush the herbs and throw them into the cauldron.Time passed by. The sky gradually began to darken. Silence also fell upon the forest and mountains. Even the sounds of the birds and beasts became a muffled whisper.As the sky darkened, the moon rose into the sky but, the moon that night was different from the other nights. It was in a shade so red like there was a blood red moon in the sky.The strange sight immediately covered the land with a strange atmosphere. It was especially so for the area around Dark Mountain. The sounds from the birds and the beasts completely disappeared. There was not even the slightest whisper from them. It was as if they did not dare to make a sound.A red shadow sped through the forest at the foot of Black Flame Mountain. It was the little monkey. At that moment, its gaze was solemn and alert. It would lift its gaze towards the red moon occasionally and distress would flicker across its features.As it ran forward, it hesitated. It still did not know that Su Ming had returned. It changed its direction and no longer ran towards Black Flame Mountain. Instead, it hid itself somewhere in the forest.As the sky grew darker, the moon shone a brighter shade of red. By the time midnight arrived, the entire Dark Mountain seemed to have been dyed in blood.At that moment, a weak cry came from within Dark Mountain. The cry grew louder as time passed and eventually grew so loud it traveled past Dark Mountain.The cry seemed to be filled with endless resentment. Those who heard it were filled with fear. It was a cry that seemed to shake the soul. If anyone listened to it for a prolonged amount of time, they would feel like their blood was boiling. It terrified them.The cry echoed through the skies as if it reflected the blood red moon. It made Dark Mountain appear to be shrouded in mystery.That night, the three tribes around Dark Mountain were filled with wariness. The normal members of the tribe in Dark Mountain Tribe all returned to their houses under the protection of the Berserkers within the tribe. They were told not to leave unless it was absolutely necessary. The tribe leader also personally took command of the Berserkers to protect the tribe.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe elder stood at the highest place in the tribe. It was a stage made of giant wood. In his hands was the black bone cane. As he looked afar, his eyes were tainted with a hint of worry.He felt Su Ming leave the tribe earlier but he did not expect the blood moon which only occurred once every three years to happen that night. It was months earlier than the previous appearances of the blood red moon. The strange phenomenon made him surprised and fearful.\u201cFire!\u201d After a long while, the elder spoke. Immediately, the tribe members surrounding the giant wooden stage brought out torches and placed them underneath the stage. The torches caused the stage to burn. The elder on the stage looked as if he was caught in a sea of fire but he was calm as he chanted in a strange language.Dark Mountain Tribe was not the only one who did this. At the same time, in another direction from Dark Mountain Tribe, the same thing also happened in Dark Dragon Tribe. The elder of Dark Dragon Tribe wore a loose robe, hair untied. There was no telling whether the elder was a man or a woman. In the person\u2019s hand was the skull of a strange, one-horned beast. The elder lifted it up high and a piercing cry escaped the person\u2019s lips.Among the tribe members of Dark Dragon Tribe stood a girl of extreme beauty. Her face was pale as she looked at the blood red moon in the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was covered in sweat as he watched the stone cauldron carefully and he adjusted the temperature of the fire as he saw fit.Very soon, there was a muffled blast within the cauldron. Su Ming laughed bitterly and wiped the sweat off his forehead. He knew that he had failed once again.\u2018Mountain Spirit is much harder to make compared to Scattering Dust\u2026\u2019Su Ming shook his head and opened the cauldron. A puff of green smoke with a spicy scent emerged from within.He sighed. Just as he was about to continue, he suddenly felt his Qi boiling in his body as though he had lost control of it. He frowned, surprised. He looked around him to see what could have possibly cause such a change but he found nothing.\u2018That\u2019s odd\u2026\u2019Su Ming scratched his head. He only stopped for a while before he resumed his attempts to create Mountain Spirit.At that moment on the other side of Dark Mountain, where Black Mountain Tribe was located, the tribe members were also looking at the moon. However their expressions were different from that of Dark Mountain Tribe and Dark Dragon Tribe. Unlike the other two tribes, their eyes were filled with fear and blood lust.Roars escaped their lips. It was not just the Berserkers who roared. Even the normal members of the tribe did so. Their cries gradually became one and turned into a giant, roaring wave.Within the center of the crowd was a small hill made up of numerous red stones. Sitting on the small hill was a willowy old man wearing a black robe. The old man\u2019s eyes were cold as he stared at the blood red moon. There was a cruel smile on his lips.\u201cSince ancient times, the Fire Berserker Tribe roamed the earth. The tribe had powers that shook the earth. They controlled all the fire on heaven and earth. If they were angered, they could even burn the heavens to ashes and become gods themselves! Their names spread through the lands so widely that even those who did not belong to the Berserker Tribe feared them.\u201d\u201cThey were known as one of the eight great Berserker Tribes!\u201d the willowy old man spoke with a hoarse voice. It was as if he was talking to all the people in the world.\u201cBut because the tribe wanted to steal an artifact from heaven, they were punished by the God of Berserkers. After nine days and nine nights, the entire Fire Berserker Tribe was destroyed except for the Berserkers. Those who did not have the Berserker Body were all burned alive and their souls shattered!\u201d\u201cEven when such a disaster befell the Fire Berserker Tribe, the Berserkers within the tribe did not die. They wanted to rebel against the God of Berserkers and become gods themselves! The God of Berserkers laid down his punishment. Just as he was about to use his powers and bring annihilation to the entire tribe, the Elder of the Fire Berserker Tribe fought against the God of Berserkers!\u201d\u201cThe battle shook the heavens. The Elder of the Fire Berserker Tribe died in battle but before his death, he cast a forbidden spell that made the God of Berserkers afraid. It allowed him to grant immortality to all the Fire Berserker tribe members who had not died!\u201d Awe appeared in the willowy old man\u2019s eyes. He raised his right hand and immediately, black mist surrounded his wrinkled hand and transformed into a terrifying shape of a spirit.\u201cBut he made a mistake. He may have allowed all the Berserkers in the Fire Berserker tribe to obtain immortality, but the God of Berserkers used the powers of Creation and made them all lose their physical bodies. They became the Wings of the Blood Moon!\u201d\u201cFrom then on, they became beings that could no longer see light. They lost their conscience and became the Wings of the Moon which lusted after blood! Their resentment, hate, anger and sadness have turned into a monstrous grudge that turns the moon red once every three years. When the moon is dyed in blood, they will return once more!\u201d\u201cTonight, I, Bi Tu, Elder of Black Mountain Tribe will help you!\u201d The willowy old man laughed darkly and bit his tongue. As he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, the blood red stones underneath his feet exploded and floated in midair.The Elder of Dark Mountain Tribe, Bi Tu, also levitated in the air. He spread his arms out. His eyes were filled with madness and excitement.The red stones began rotating quickly in midair and formed a gigantic picture. The picture was spherical in shape and there was a crescent moon within it. The entire thing was colored a bloody red.\u201cWings of the Moon, wake up! Awaken from your long slumber and come forth!\u201d Bi Tu spat out another mouthful of fresh blood which instantly turned into bloody mist and fused into the giant picture in the sky. A roaring sound came from the picture and it exploded suddenly. It turned into a big patch of red mist which spread across its surroundings like rolling waves.At that moment, the entirety of Dark Mountain shook. The trembling could be clearly felt as if the land was moving and the mountains were shaking. The tremors caused an uproar within Dark Mountain Tribe and Dark Dragon Tribe.Su Ming, who was in the cave within Black Flame Mountain also felt the tremors. His expression changed. He even heard a faint roar from within the deeper parts of the cave as the mountain shook. He froze and immediately stopped all activity. He retreated a few steps and climbed through the exit. When he climbed out of the cave, he almost gasped in surprise. Right before his eyes was the blood moon hanging in the sky!\u201cThe blood moon!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s face immediately turned pale.At that moment, a thick stench of blood came from within Black Flame Mountain. Su Ming did not even hesitate. He understood the connotations of the blood moon and had even calculated the days before it appeared.However, he did not expect it to appear earlier!He immediately turned around and crawled back into the cave. He knew that he could not find a place to hide once he was outside. There was no time for him to return to the tribe either. Once he returned to the cave, he immediately took out his horn and quickly cut through the wall beside him. It was as if he was struck by madness. The roaring sound within the cave was becoming clearer and there were even signs of other sounds amid the roar.Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. Fortunately, he was used to the place and the horn was extremely sharp. Soon enough, he cut open a small hole and he crawled in immediately. Su Ming then blocked the entrance of the hole with the stones that fell out when he was cutting through the wall. He did not even mind the heat the hole emitted.The very moment he crawled into the hole, a gust of red mist rushed out from within the cave. Once it filled up the entire cave, it escaped through the tunnel with a rumble. Su Ming heard the sound clearly.Under the light of the blood moon, the five summits of Dark Mountain seemingly erupted like volcanoes. The rumbles shook the skies and a huge amount of red mist poured out from the summits.It seemed like the mist had been inside the five summits of Dark Mountain since the beginning of time. As it erupted from the mountains, the mist immediately covered the sky. The mist from Dark Dragon Mountain leaked out of the mountain from its cracks. Some even poured out from the place Su Ming obtained the Dark Dragon\u2019s Saliva. If Su Ming looked closely, he would have noticed that the places the dark dragons avoided like the plague as they chased him around all those years, were the places where the red mist was the thickest!The other mountains were the same as Dark Dragon Mountain, especially Black Flame Mountain. The amount of mist that erupted from the mountain was shocking. As the mist spread around the place, a humming sound echoed. There were sounds of many wings flapping mixed in with the humming, creating a rhapsody of death, which terrified all who heard it!He saw red shadows coming out of the five summits along with the mist. There were also piercing roars echoing through the sky. The red shadows were strange beasts that had a pair of wings and red eyes each. They were the size of a palm and had six limbs. They also had human faces which were filled with madness and lust for blood.They were the Wings of the Moon!The number of the Wings of the Moon mounted to at least tens of thousands. They covered the skies until it was completely red. As they cried out, they rushed towards Black Mountain Tribe, Dark Mountain Tribe, Dark Dragon Tribe and all the places where wild beasts dwelt in the forest.They did not have a conscience. They were only fueled by resentment and a thirst for blood. They only knew how to kill and drink fresh blood, especially blood of the members of the Berserker Tribe. It only further spurred their insanity. In fact, they sometimes skipped feasting on wild beasts and went straight for the Berserker Tribes.There was an uproar within Dark Mountain Tribe. There were screams filled with terror echoing in the air. Chen Xin\u2019s face was pale as she held on tightly onto Bei Ling, who was beside her. Bei Ling\u2019s face too was pale.Lei Chen was standing further ahead overcome by irritation. He wanted to find Su Ming but he did not see him among the people within the settlement. As he was filled with worry for his friend, he was further taken aback by the scene in the sky.The terrified normal tribe members were silenced by the Berserkers in the tribe. Gradually, all the people of tribe focused their gazes on the burning wooden stage and on the person who was looking at the sky.The elder\u2019s face was pale but they could not see it due to the fire. His pupils were contracted. He saw the red mist and heard the mad cries coming from afar.\u2018How could this be\u2026? Not only did the blood moon appear earlier, even the Wings of the Moon have increased\u2026 There were only about thousands of them the last time\u2026\u2019He took a sharp breath and shouted without hesitation.\u201cNormal members of the tribe, hide! Berserkers, take out all of the meat we have in store. Cut them open and wait for my orders!\u201d The elder\u2019s body trembled slightly. He lowered his head. He looked at the members of his tribe and closed his eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe same also happened in Dark Dragon Tribe. Once Bai Ling and the other members of the tribe heard the elder\u2019s orders, the fear in their eyes increased.She would never forget what happened nine years ago. When she was still a child, she saw her playmate being snatched away by numerous Wings of the Moon before her eyes. He disappeared into the mist as he cried and screamed. Once he was dragged into Dark Mountain, only a slow and painful death awaited him.The blood red moon became a vague shadow in the sky as it was covered by the mist. However, the shadows that whistled through the mist were coming closer. The large number of Wings of the Moon split into three groups and sped towards the three tribes near them.In Dark Mountain Tribe, the elder was staring at the sky. The moment the Wings of the Moon appeared, he swung the bone cane in his right hand. A lake of fire spread underneath him and covered the entire tribe but the lake of fire did not burn any of the houses. It looked like an illusion surrounded the tribe.\u201cThrow the meat!\u201d The elder growled. Immediately the terrified Berserkers within the tribe\u2019s settlement threw a bleeding creature towards the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A large number of Wings of the Moon screeched as they came and sped through the mist, covering the sky above Dark Mountain Tribe. Piercing roars drowned out all the sounds in the land. It was the only sound that could be heard that night.Dozens of beasts drenched in blood were thrown into the air by the tribe members. Before they fell back to the ground, they were immediately swarmed by the Wings of the Moon that gathered upon them like bloody clouds. Amid the cries, the beasts\u2019 bodies were entirely covered by the Wings of the Moon and their flesh pierced through by sharp teeth. They turned into dried up carcasses in an instant. Their blood and living bodies were devoured by the Wings of the Moon.All that was left were only skin and bones. They crashed onto the ground and twitched helplessly before they all died.Some of the numerous Wings of the Moon in the sky even ignored the beasts tossed into the air. They plunged straight towards the tribe members. Their eyes were filled with ruthlessness and a thirst for blood. Their targets were the Berserkers within the tribe.Screams, cries and roars collided with each other. They resonated with the screeches made by the Wings of the Moon on that strange night.The lake of fire that surrounded the entire tribe was like a solid barrier. It caused the Wings of the Moon that approached the tribe to retreat with a cry. It seemed that the fire, which could not even burn the houses could actually cause them mortal damage.\u201cAgain!\u201d The elder stood within the lake of fire and looked at the sky gravely.Immediately more tribe members tossed even more beasts into the air in the midst of their fear. It did look like they were feeding and offering sacrifices to the crazed Wings of the Moon in the sky.Time passed by. All of the creatures stored for winter had become food for the Wings of the Moon and fell back onto the ground like mummies. Driven by madness caused by their lust for blood, they started diving downwards. It seemed like an attempt to break through the lake of fire and descend upon the tribe to feast on the blood of the Berserkers.The elder waved his right hand and the lake of fire turned into a giant vortex that spun rapidly in the sky. He was going up against the Wings of the Moon in the sky by himself. At the same time, arrows upon arrows pierced through the lake of fire and into the sky from the tribe to fight against the Wings of the Moon.To the Wings of the Moon that were pretty much immortal, this sort of injury was nothing to them. Their flapping wings and piercing cries made the people in Dark Mountain Tribe panic.Before long, some Wings of the Moon broke through the lake of fire and flew into the tribe, causing chaos within Dark Mountain Tribe.The same also happened in Dark Dragon Tribe.However, a strange sight happened within Black Mountain Tribe. All of the members of the tribe prostrated on the ground and remained still. In the sky, the Elder of Black Mountain Tribe, Bi Tu stretched his arms wide open. His face looked crazy with fanaticism as he stared at the sky, chanting.Numerous Wings of the Moon circled around him. There were also a large number of them on him. Their fangs sunk into his flesh and they drank his blood.Yet Bi Tu appeared to have lost all sense of pain. He did not resist instead, the crazed fanaticism on his face grew even more. As his face became paler due to the loss of blood, the strange chant became louder.\u201cI sacrifice my blood to you, o ancient Fire Berserker Tribe! You have obtained immortality and have turned into Wings of the Moon. You feast upon the Berserker Blood and now I will take the Blood of the Fire Berserkers into my veins!\u201d\u201cDi He, Hong La Dong!\u201d Bi Tu bellowed facing the skies and immediately, a piercing black light erupted from his body. As the black light spread out from his body, the Wings of the Moon on his body screamed. Their bodies started shriveling and the light in their eyes started dimming. After a moment, they fell off Bi Tu\u2019s body as they lost all signs of life.It drove more Wings of the Moon wild!The process repeated itself. A large amount of blood from the Wings of the Moon was absorbed by Bi Tu. His body began to swell at an alarming speed and a thick presence of Qi erupted from his body.The moment they sensed the presence of the Qi, not only did those Wings of the Moon become even more frantic, even the ones that went to Dark Mountain Tribe as well as Dark Dragon Tribe changed their direction and flew towards Black Mountain Tribe.Not far away from Black Mountain Tribe, stood the figure of a person wrapped entirely in a black robe. He stood out among all the people of Black Mountain Tribe who lay prostrated on the ground. The black robe he wore was also not something that could be found in the small tribes around the area. As he stood there, he looked at the Elder of Black Mountain Tribe in the air, his lips curling up into a dark smile.\u201cI gave you the way to find the moon stones necessary to summon the Wings of the Moon made of the Fire Berserker. I also taught you the way to summon them. I told you the quickest way to arrive at the Awakening Realm. Your success is up to you now\u2026\u201dCompared to the chaos outside, Su Ming was relatively safe. He pushed away the stones that covered the hole in the cave and jumped out. There were several spots on his skin that had blistered due to the heat. His lips were dry and cracked as his heart pounded against his chest.\u201cThis is\u2026 I can\u2019t believe this is one of the resting places of the Wings of the Moon!\u201d Su Ming stared at the spot where the Wings of the Moon appeared in the cave. He heard many legends regarding the Wings of the Moon since he was young and knew just how terrifying they were. The legends about how they were almost immortal also made Su Ming narrow his eyes in fear.After a moment of silence, he crawled out of the entrance of the cave slowly. As he was near the exit, he stuck out his head quickly and looked around. The sight made him gasp. The sky was covered by red mist and an uncountable amount of Wings of the Moon circled the sky, the sound of their roars echoing.Su Ming immediately retreated into the cave.\u2018I wonder what happened to the tribe\u2026 I can\u2019t go back now. If I leave now, the Wings of the Moon will definitely find me.\u2019Su Ming frowned. He was feeling very agitated and worried about the tribe.Even so, he knew that he had no way to solve the problem. He looked at the place within the cave, where the Wings of the Moon appeared. Slowly, a glint appeared in his eyes.\u2018The number of Wings of the Moon is obviously a lot of more than the previous times. By the looks of it, the deeper parts of the cave should be empty now\u2026\u2019Su Ming hesitated for a moment before walking forward slowly. After he stepped over the place he used for quenching and observed the deeper parts of the cave, he decided.\u2018I might as well see what\u2019s in there that allowed the Wings of the Moon to stay here for so long. I might be able to find their secret and tell the elder. It might be of some help to him.\u2019Su Ming then ran towards the deeper parts of the cave that he had not explored before.It was odd. The cave was usually hot. There were even times when Su Ming felt as if there were hot waves crashing onto him. However, as Su Ming went deeper into the cave, he no longer felt any heat. Instead, he felt a chill coming from within the cave.As Su Ming continued walking deeper, there was another uproar amid the three tribes on Dark Mountain.Several hundreds of the Wings of the Moon had already penetrated the lake of fire protecting Dark Mountain Tribe. They dived towards the tribe members and fought against the Berserkers. Bei Ling\u2019s eyes grew cold as he protected Chen Xin, who stood behind him. A cold wave spread out of his right hand, forming sharp icicles around them. There were a lot of wounds on his body and blood poured freely out of his body. Suddenly, he narrowed his eyes and focused on a point far away. He reached for the bow on his back with his right hand without any hesitation.As Bei Ling took the bow, a strong killing intent came forth. He drew the bow with his left hand and the tip of the bow gleamed. Immediately, the snow around them gathered at the tip of the bow and he shot an ice arrow towards the direction he was looking at!Some distance away, Lei Chen was overwhelmed by a lust for blood. There were numerous Wings of the Moon on his body but he did not care. Instead, he seemed to be taken over by madness as he grabbed one of them and tried to bite it.\u201cYou want to suck my blood?! Fine, I\u2019ll suck yours too!\u201dJust as he was about to bite down on the Wings of the Moon in his grasp, he noticed there were dozens more flying towards him. With his current level, there was no way he could fight against so many of them.At that moment though, a cold blast of air rushed towards him. As the cold wind appeared, an arrow made of snow and ice exploded on top of Lei Chen with a bang. It caused all the Wings of the Moon on top of Lei Chen to fall, saving him in the process.Lei Chen was surprised. He turned and looked at Bei Ling, who was coolly putting aside his bow. An indescribable expression appeared across Lei Chen\u2019s eyes.The Qi of the tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe was rolling off his body like waves. In his hands was a long silver spear. Every time he threw the spear, cries would echo throughout the sky as numerous Qi waves hit the air, causing the Wings of the Moon to spread out.Even so, the number of Wings of the Moon that rushed down was too many. Some of the normal members of the tribe were even nearly captured by some of them.That moment, the elder acted. He swung the bone cane in his hands and the entire tribe trembled. An illusion of a giant statue of the God of Berserkers formed in midair. The statue\u2019s eyes were filled with ruthlessness as if it was alive. The dragon in its hands even lifted its head and roared. Then it flew into the sky and swept through its surroundings.As time passed, the night of the blood red moon slowly went by but the battle in the tribe became even more intense. Some Wings of the Moon captured a few members of the Berserker Tribe alive instead of sucking their blood near the end of the battle. They intended to bring the members back to their lair and suck out their blood.As light started to brighten up the sky, a piercing cry sliced through the air from Dark Dragon Tribe. Among the numerous Wings of the Moon was a white figure. Her beautiful face was pale and filled with despair as she was captured along with her other tribe members by the Wings of the Moon. They were flying back towards Dark Mountain.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBehind them, an old woman wearing sackcloth chased after them desperately.As their cries of terror continued traveling away from Dark Dragon Tribe, the old woman\u2019s eyes became bloodshot and were filled with despair before long. She turned around and gave up on the chase. She chose instead to go back and defend her tribe.When the person in white saw this, tears escaped her eyes\u2026As her tears fell, they disappeared without anyone noticing.As daylight arrived and the blood red moon disappeared, the tens of thousands of Wings of the Moon let out a huge cry and flew back towards Dark Mountain from all directions. Some of them carried the girl in white and her other tribe members towards Black Flame Mountain. They entered through the cracks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He remained alert on the way and regularly made sure the coast was clear before he moved further. As he moved, he also held onto the horn and activated the Qi in his body. He prepared himself to fight with the power of all 11 blood veins at all times.He also searched for possible hiding places along the way so that he could hide himself when there was any danger or when the Wings of the Moon suddenly returned.Su Ming was filled with curiosity towards the unknown but his cautiousness kept his curiosity in check. It was especially so in such a dangerous place.As he moved forward, the cave colder. As the crossroads increased, Su Ming\u2019s speed also increased.It was completely dark around him. There were also a lot of cracks on the walls. By the looks of it, they were caused by years of heating. However, Su Ming noticed that some cracks were just recently formed. The color on those walls were different from the others.\u2018That\u2019s odd, these cracks must have just been formed recently\u2026 Just what kind of energy could have caused the walls to form new cracks..?\u2019An answer began to form in Su Ming\u2019s head.\u2018Could it be because of the sudden cooling of the strong heat, causing an unimaginable force of energy to explode..?\u2019Su Ming scratched his head. He did not think too deeply into it but he remembered it.He did not know how long he walked but it felt like a long time. Suddenly, he stopped. The cave before him had obviously become much bigger. In fact, the deeper he went, the wider it became.\u2018Have I arrived at the deeper parts of the cave?!\u2019Su Ming scrutinized his surroundings and walked forward slowly. Before long, the cave before him grew wider. When he arrived at the end, Su Ming took a deep breath and started thinking as he absorbed the sights before him.Before him was a cave the size of his tribe. There were dozens of other small holes around the cave. The hole Su Ming exited from was one of them.In his silence, Su Ming went forward, his eyes bright. He looked at the other small holes in the cave. Then he narrowed his eyes and leapt forward, stopping at the entrance of each hole in the cave to take a sniff.Once he went through all the small holes, Su Ming stared at one of them. Without any hesitation, he crawled in. Among the small caves, only this one had a faint stench of blood.It was obvious that the Wings of the Moon flew out from this hole.As he ran, Su Ming stopped at times to think. As he did so, he would slice off a big chunk of rock from the walls around him using the horn. The rock was about as tall as the tunnel.It was bothersome but Su Ming insisted on doing it. Su Ming cut out a few rocks of the same size as he moved forward.Each time he sliced them out, he would place them aside once he positioned them properly.Gradually, Su Ming\u2019s speed increased. He still kept his guard up. He could tell that he was going towards the bottom of the mountain. That was why the area was becoming bigger. Su Ming continued running downwards. It was not until he felt that he had run a long distance before he gradually saw a red light before him.The red light was like fire but he could not determine what it was.When he saw the fire-like red light, Su Ming slowed down. His heart pounded against his chest. Somewhere in his mind, he felt that he was near the end. As he drew near, he had a hunch that the blood in his body was going to boil. It was not a feeling he was unfamiliar with\u2026The rocks on the walls had numerous scratches. There were also some bite marks on the rocks. It created a strange atmosphere that made Su Ming nervous. Nonetheless, he did not stop. Alternatively, he walked towards the red light.It was indeed the end of the tunnel. Instead of a road ahead, there was a giant fire cave in its place. Su Ming remained alert. He stood at the exit and looked downwards.As he did, he stood there stunned as if he was struck by lightning. Then he instinctively took a few steps back, drawing a sharp breath.There was a giant basin in the cave. Within the basin were numerous stalagmites as sharp as thorns. They were shaped like hills. The thorny structures were entirely gray but they constantly emitted a chilly wind which surrounded the area. The temperature in the cave dropped to freezing cold.That did not really affect Su Ming. No, what astonished Su Ming was what he found covered by the cold thorns within the basin!It was a tribe!There were numerous houses made of stone, a barricade and a watchtower made of stone. Su Ming even saw stone pots used to cook rice scattered everywhere in the tribe.On the walls outside of each house, was a picture of what looked like a blazing fire!All of the houses made of stone were huge and built in an orderly manner. They looked much more luxurious compared to the houses in Dark Mountain Tribe.Su Ming even saw roads made of stone. There were a large number of protruding stones on some of the smaller paths as well. Su Ming took a long time observing them but he still had no clue what the small pavements were for.It was not a normal tribe or a complete tribe.Su Ming\u2019s gaze fell upon some of the houses at the edge of the tribe\u2019s settlement. Those houses seemed to be split apart by a mysterious force. Only half of them remained within the basin.As for the other half, no one knew where they went\u2026It was especially so on the tribal grounds. Besides the stone pavements, the other parts looked like dirt, forming a clear difference between the stones in the mountain.Su Ming\u2019s breathing quickened. As he marveled at the sight before him, he remembered what the elder once said \u2013 The legend of the Fire Berserker Tribe\u2026 Gradually, a picture began forming in his head. In this picture, he saw a gigantic tribe which seemed to span endlessly across the land.All the houses in the tribe were made of stone and on their walls were the emblems of a blazing fire. The emblem represented the name of the tribe!However one day, a change occurred within the tribe. It was split apart by an unknown force like it was shattered. The unknown force also scattered the tribe and its members along with the land it was built upon. They were all forced apart.A small part of the tribe and the land shifted into Dark Mountain\u2026\u2018That wasn\u2019t a legend\u2026\u2019Su Ming looked at the bizarre and incredible sight before him.He swept his gaze across the tribe and when he looked at the center of the tribe, he narrowed his eyes.There was an even stranger thing in the middle!It was a giant tree or more accurately, it looked like a giant tree! The entire thing was blazing red and it emitted a light which looked like fire. The light Su Ming saw from the tunnel was from this giant tree.The tree was as thick as dozens of grown men. Its roots had penetrated the ground and looked as if they went deep into the ground. No one knew how deeply they went.Only the tree trunk was visible. The top of the tree had already penetrated the top of the cave. Only part of the tree was visible.\u2018A tree growing within Black Flame Mountain\u2026\u2019Su Ming stared at the tree. Over there, he saw some familiar red flowers displaying their enchanting beauty.As he looked at the red flowers, Su Ming remembered the strange sights he saw at the swamp in the forest.Su Ming averted his gaze in his silence and looked at the ruins of the tribe that had been buried within the passages of time. A sudden sadness formed in his chest. He sighed and jumped down to stand amid the ruins of one of the eight great Berserker Tribes. The Fire Berserker Tribe had fought against the God of Berserkers.\u2018Then, the Wings of the Moon must also be as depicted in the legends. They are the changed form of the Fire Berserker Tribe that had been granted immortality by the Fire Berserker Elder\u2019s Berserker Art\u2026 But\u2026 This is unbelievable. How could such an Art truly exist..? Just how strong was the Fire Elder of the Fire Berserker Tribe..?\u2018It\u2019s mentioned in the beast skin scroll that after the Blood Solidification Realm is the Awakening Realm, and after the Awakening Realm is the Bone Sacrifice Realm. There was no mention of what comes after the Bone Sacrifice Realm though, the practitioners are only known as Berserker Masters.\u2018As Su Ming looked at the ruins of the tribe before his eyes in silence, he began walking forward.The tribe was empty. Besides the houses and some stuff scattered around, Su Ming did not even see any bones lying around. The silence was suffocating.He stepped quietly onto the small pavement, filled with protruding stones. When he stepped on them, he felt them pricking his feet. He lowered his head and looked at the pavement but he still could not figure out their use. He walked forward slowly but stopped suddenly as he caught a glimpse of something from the corner of his eyes. He turned his head towards the direction and saw a corpse hanging on the wall. It was at the border where the tribe had been cut away!The corpse was hidden by some of the houses, which was why Su Ming did not see it initially. However as he stood there, he could see it clearly then.The moment he saw the skeleton, Su Ming narrowed his eyes. This was the only corpse he saw at the place. He walked towards the corpse quickly. When he looked at it closely, Su Ming shivered.The corpse was very strange. Its top half was that of a person but it was shriveled up. The lower half of the corpse was even stranger. It looked as if it had melted away and mutated. It was different from the skeletal frame of a normal person. The frame of a pair of wings also seemed to materialize on its back. Looking at the corpse, it even looked similar to the Wings of the Moon!It was as though the person experienced a change in his form before his death!

Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bright with trepidation but he did not move.Sounds of flapping wings and piercing shrieks echoed in his ears, but Su Ming knew just how long the tunnels were. Even if the sounds arrived first, there would be some time left before the Wings of the Moon actually returned.There might not have been a lot of time left, but it was still enough for him to make his escape.Su Ming did not hesitate. He cast his gaze on the words carved into the wall that the strange corpse was leaning against.\u201cWherefore doth thou wail, o blue sky?\u201dThese were the very first words carved into the wall. The handwriting was filled with strength and masculinity, revealing a shred of insolence and truculence. Su Ming narrowed his eyes the moment he saw those words.Su Ming did not truly understand their meaning and could only grasp the basic gist of it. Despite that, he could still feel the sadness and aloofness in the words.\u201cWherefore doth thou cry, o blue sky\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled. Then he looked at the other lines on the wall.\u201cThe desire to obtain Berserk spreads to all corners of the earth. Let fire burn in mine blood, let mine thoughts burn the skies, let fire burn heaven into ashes\u2026 If \u2018t be true the moon of fire appears from the clouds on the endless earth \u2026 I wilt sink into deep bethought as the fire in mine blood burns, the nine is the utmost of all, and the one is the law. Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire!\u201cThou who control the heavens, only thou art capable of persecuting me!\u201d The words underneath were obviously carved by the same person but, it was no longer a lament. They were words that were difficult to understand.\u201cLight up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine\u2026 did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire\u2026\u201d Su Ming frowned. These particular lines were hard to fathom. Su Ming read them again but even so, he still only got the basic gist of it.As he was thinking, the piercing roars and sound of flapping wings became louder in his ears as they echoed through the tunnel not far away. Su Ming did not linger any longer but ran towards the tunnel quickly.He was already in the tunnel, in the blink of an eye. As he stood there, the piercing roars became even clearer. Su Ming turned back and looked at the desolate tribe once more, then ran into the tunnel swiftly.As he ran, he paid attention to the volume of the roars. When he was dozens of feet into the tunnel, Su Ming stopped and crawled into the crack on the wall next to him.The crack was not big but Su Ming was tiny to begin with so, he had no problems getting in there. Once he crawled in, he immediately squatted down and stilled his breathing. Using the wall as a hiding spot, Su Ming peeked out of the crack and waited silently as his heart pounded against his chest.Su Ming counted the time by his breaths. After 10 breaths, he felt goosebumps covering his entire body. He saw thick red mist rolling into the tunnel like an explosion. Within the mist were red shadows flying pass as it let out thunderous roars.The red shadows were Wings of the Moon!Looking at the Wings of the Moon at such a close distance made Su Ming\u2019s heart beat even faster, but he did not move an inch. He even narrowed his eyes to a slit to avoid any light reflecting off his eyes.A huge number of Wings of the Moon kept swarming into the tunnel. One of them even crashed into the edges of the crack and it was just about half a feet away from where Su Ming squatted down.Su Ming held onto the horn so tightly with his right hand that his knuckles turned white. At that moment, he could not even feel his own heartbeat. It was as if he had calmed down completely despite the extremely stressful situation he was in.He stared at the Wings of the Moon that crashed into the wall. As he looked at its horrifying face and flapping wings, it flew out of the crack. Su Ming did not let his guard down. If anything, it made him even more wary.At that moment, he heard cries filled with despair. Su Ming peeked out of the crack and saw the silhouette of a few people captured by the Wings of the Moon in the mist, being brought back to the tribe.There were nine of them\u2026Su Ming could not see all nine of them clearly but, as he swept his gaze across them, he saw a person in white, and her beautiful face was filled with despair and desolation.\u2018It\u2019s her!\u2019Su Ming narrowed his eyes. The person in white was the girl from Dark Dragon Tribe he and Lei Chen met at the square \u2013 Bai Ling!Su Ming fell silent.Time trickled by slowly. Before long, the sounds in the tunnel gradually dispersed. Even the mist had largely dissipated. It was as though all the Wings of the Moon had returned to their nests as the blood red moon left the sky, as though they were all about to return to slumber.A hot wave of heat immediately spread throughout the tunnel, replacing the cold. Even the crack in the wall was beginning to heat up swiftly. Su Ming heard crackling sounds and right before his eyes he saw new cracks forming on the walls of the mountain cave.\u2018So this is how the cracks are formed\u2026\u2019Su Ming stood up quickly and approached the cracks. As he stood in the tunnel, he could feel the mist becoming thinner. Waves of heat crashed into him from where the tribe was, causing him to be covered in sweat.The stones on the ground also grew hotter. Su Ming could even feel the ground burning the soles of his feet as he stood there. He clearly knew that very soon, he was not going to be able to withstand the heat in the place!He contemplated on leaving or staying.There was a hint of hesitation on Su Ming\u2019s face. Wretched moans traveled through the tunnel. Anyone who heard them would have trembled in their shoes.\u2018I already lied to her at the square with Lei Chen. My consciousness won\u2019t allow me to leave just like that\u2026\u2018Su Ming was still an honest child deep down. He took a deep breath of hot air and ran towards the end of the tunnel.\u2018If I can save her, I will! If I can\u2019t, then at least I won\u2019t regret it.\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes were resolute as he held onto his horn. The closer he got to the end of the tunnel, the more he felt the heat in the place increasing at maddening speed.Fortunately, the distance was close. Before long, Su Ming arrived at the end of the tunnel. Without bothering about the heat on the walls of the cave, he pressed his body against it and peeped into the cave.His eyes immediately shone with a dim light. Su Ming saw seven people who were still alive, struggling on the sharp stalagmites situated on top the ruins of the tribe in the gigantic basin. Their stomachs were pierced through by seven sharp stalagmites, and their blood flowed down the stakes. They were still not dead and were letting out cries of agony as they felt the life seeping out of their bodies. All seven of these people were men.Su Ming looked at them closely and let out a sigh of relief. He knew none of the seven so, it was clear that they were not people from Dark Mountain Tribe.The other sharp stalagmites around them were melting. As they melted, a huge amount of red magma covered the land like a river\u2026As he saw that, Su Ming inhaled deeply. He finally understood the purpose of the sharp stalagmites!\u2018This place is really strange. Perhaps the Wings of the Moon\u2019s awakening and departure are related to the sharp stalagmites!\u2019 Su Ming thought.The sharp stalagmites were probably formed from the magma for some unknown reason occasionally but not for long. After the Wings of the Moon returned, they would melt and return to magma.\u2018With the amount of stalagmites I saw just now, when they melt completely the basin will be completely filled. The tribe will be hidden once more underneath the magma\u2026\u2019Su Ming lifted his head and looked at small red trunk which looked like a big tree located at the center of the tribe.The tree also showed signs of melting under the extreme heat in the basin. It was moving around oddly. If Su Ming had looked closely, he would have seen that there were red lines surrounding the tree. Sometimes, a part of it would fall off. It was clear that it was a Wings of the Moon!However, the Wings of the Moon that returned to the tree no longer had ferocious looks on their faces. As a replacement, were looks of pain, desolation and sadness. They did not continue screaming but they looked as if they were crying silently. Some Wings of the Moon were even gesticulating weirdly. They kept lifting their claws and biting them to draw blood in the midst of their sorrow. They wiped their claws on their eyes but there was no blood in the bitten claws.\u2018Those Wings of the Moon crawled into the tree! What\u2026 are they doing..?\u2019Su Ming stared at the tree. As he was thinking, he felt the heat climbing up even more. He could not stay there any longer.\u2018I can\u2019t find her\u2026 too bad\u2026\u2019Su Ming shook his head. He tried his best. Just as he was about to leave, he stopped.His gaze fell upon the red tree branch situated at the center of the basin. Two faces appeared on the tree. One of them, he did not know but the other was Bai Ling.Bai Ling\u2019s eyes were empty and void of life as if she had already given up. At that moment, she looked like a mournful beauty.Su Ming looked at her face, then at the magma gathering slowly downwards. Most of the stalagmites had already melted into magma and had risen about half the height of the houses in the tribe.The only things visible within the basin were the roofs of the houses. Even the roofs were turning into a hot shade of red.\u2018The Wings of the Moon appear when the blood red moon is in the sky. But judging by the situation here, they should also be connected with the heat in this place. They\u2019re really afraid of heat\u2026 that\u2019s why they will only go out and hunt when this place becomes cold\u2026\u2018When they come back, they will all crawl into the tree. None of them will be outside. All of this is proof of my theory.\u2018Su Ming did not act recklessly but he stood there as his eyes flashed brilliantly.\u2018I should be able to save her\u2026 but I still need to wait a bit longer\u2026\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming stared at the tree and occasionally looked at the height of the magma down in the basin.After a while, the heat in the place increased once more. It caused Su Ming to sweat continuously. His skin also showed signs of crying and cracking. The Qi in his entire body boiled as he manifested all 11 blood veins. Su Ming jumped down.In the blink of an eye, Su Ming landed on one of the roofs in the basin. The moment he landed, he heard a sizzling sound. White smoke immediately came out underneath his feet. Su Ming did not stop. He jumped again and landed on another rood. After a few leaps, he was near the strange red tree.Just as he was about to reach the tree, Su Ming saw the unknown girl beside Bai Ling shriveling as she let out an agonizing scream. Instantly, she became a pile of bones!It was like she became one with the tree. Her life and all her flesh were absorbed by some mysterious force.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he ran even faster. That was simply how Su Ming was. Either he would stay away from something, or he would finish what he had started.The very moment he went near the tree, Bai Ling\u2019s eyes which had previously been void of life, focused on him. She stared at Su Ming with a dumb-founded expression. As she stared, tears escaped her eyes.There was no hint of hesitation when Su Ming approached the tree. He lifted the horn in his right hand and stabbed the red tree. When half of the horn sank into the tree, a dark red liquid that looked like blood flowed out. A muffled scream also came out from within.It was a scream filled with rage. It was so powerful, it shook the entire basin.Su Ming\u2019s face was pale but his eyes were cold. When the horn pierced the tree, he pulled it downwards abruptly. A giant crack appeared on the tree. A cold gust of air immediately gushed forth from the crack.The crack practically appeared beside Bai Ling. Once the crack opened up, Su Ming saw Bai Ling\u2019s body inside. He did not hesitate and pushed his hand into the tree to grab Bai Ling\u2019s arm inside. Then with a low growl, he yanked her out.With just a yank, he managed to bring Bai Ling\u2019s body out of the tree.Bai Ling was shocked. She looked at Su Ming with a dumbfounded expression and allowed Su Ming to pull her. More tears escaped her eyes. At that moment, Su Ming\u2019s face was deeply ingrained in her mind.With Bai Ling in his grasp, Su Ming immediately jumped backwards. His heart was pounding against his chest. Just as he was about to leave, the screams grew much stronger and filled the entire basin. From the crack on the tree, dozens of Wings of the Moon appeared. The sadness and desolation on their faces were replaced with madness and blood lust as they flew out of the crack.Su Ming felt his skin crawl. He immediately retreated. There were just too many Wings of the Moon. They were lined up so densely. Su Ming guessed that there were about thousands of them coming right at him and Bai Ling. There were even more Wings of the Moon within the tree.However, just as the Wings of the Moon were about to chase after them, Su Ming saw the waves of heat crashing into them. Their faces were filled with terror. Some of them even froze and fell into the magma. They broke apart and shattered into pieces like stones. There was neither blood nor flesh. Only a gust of cold air rose from where they shattered.\u2018The legend of the immortal Fire Berserker Tribe who were turned into Wings of the Moon is true! They originally did not fear fire but once they changed into Wings of the Moon, they experienced a mysterious mutation and became afraid of fire\u2026\u2018By the looks of it, they\u2019re bodies are as cold as ice\u2026\u2019Su Ming narrowed his eyes. As he retreated, he threw Bai Ling towards the entrance of the nearby tunnel with his left hand.\u201cWhy are you still daydreaming?! Run!\u201d Su Ming growled at her. Bai Ling snapped out of her stupor as if she just woke up from a nightmare. The moment her body landed at the entrance of the tunnel, she turned around and looked at Su Ming. Just as she was about to speak\u2026\u201cRun!\u201d Su Ming ran towards the entrance of the tunnel. The magma in the basin had already covered all of the houses in the tribe. There were only a handful of roofs left.Bai Ling\u2019s face was pale. She hesitated no longer and turned before running into the tunnel. Her legs were in pain but she ignored it. The only thought in her mind right then was to escape from the place.Su Ming jumped on the few rooftops left and headed straight for the tunnel. Behind him, a large number of Wings of the Moon screamed but they did not dare give chase. The muffled cries and roars from the tree made the Wings of the Moon even more hysterical. A few dozen of them even went straight for Su Ming with no regard of the heat.The Qi in Su Ming\u2019s body was boiling. The 11 blood veins spread across his body. When the Wings of the Moon came, he swung the horn in his hand and rushed towards the tunnel. All of this happened within a short period of time. Nonetheless, when Su Ming arrived at the tunnel, some of the Wings of the Moon that had chased after him fell and shattered on the magma.Su Ming\u2019s heart was pounding quickly but he was calm. Everything was going according to plan. If he had decided to wait a bit longer and the magma grew even thicker before he acted, things would not have been so easy. More Wings of the Moon would have in fact chased after him.As he stepped into the tunnel, Su Ming\u2019s feet were giving off a stench of burnt flesh. Despite that, he did not stop. He ran even quicker instead.Behind him, all the Wings of the Moon in the basin roared but they did not pursue. Still, there were some who managed to charge into the tunnel in spite of the deaths of their many comrades. They rushed at Su Ming.\u2018The Wings of the Moon are afraid of heat\u2026 that\u2019s why they do not dare to come out from the tree. But the closer we are outside, the more the heat will also decrease\u2026\u2019As Su Ming ran, the screeches behind him grew clearer.\u2018I have to kill all the Wings of the Moon that come after us. They must not remain!\u2019Su Ming looked at the big stone he previously cut out when he came in. He immediately ran towards it. With horn in hand, he turned and saw four Wings of the Moon rushing towards him with savage looks on their faces. The sound of their flapping wings becoming louder.Su Ming\u2019s face was pale but his eyes were calm. Just as the four Wings of the Moon were about to reach him, Su Ming kicked the big stone.He measured the size of the stone previously. It was approximately the same size as the tunnel. As he kicked the stone by focusing all of the power of his Qi to his leg, the stone flew up and blocked the tunnel like a door!Su Ming always had impeccable timing. According to his calculations, the stone door could hold back three Wings of the Moon temporarily. As for the remaining one, he would kill it with the horn in his hands using the heat in the tunnel to his advantage.However, the Wings of the Moon were simply too fast. The stone barricade Su Ming made only managed to stop two of them. The other two made it past the barricade and rushed towards him.Su Ming frowned and immediately ran forward. Even if he could kill the two Wings of the Moon, he would be injured. Besides, he still had a better plan.As he ran, the speed of the Wings of the Moon\u2019s pursuit increased. Less than 100 feet away from him was another stone of the same size.As he ran past the stone, Su Ming used his previous experience and kicked the stone. With a loud crash, the stone flew up and blocked the tunnel. It held back one of them while the other escaped.Just as the other one rushed towards Su Ming, the cold glare in Su Ming\u2019s eyes thickened. He did not retreat any longer but chose to charge forward with the horn in his hand.The man and abomination immediately battled in the tunnel. If Su Ming did not walk in the Ways of the Berserker, he would not have been able to resist, much less fight. However, he had already manifested 11 blood veins. He was also equipped with an extremely sharp horn. He had a complete upper hand in the battle against the Wings of the Moon.Su Ming stabbed the Wings of the Moon and he immediately jumped away. Nevertheless, the wound left on its body recovered quickly. The Wings of the Moon only looked slightly sluggish but showed no signs of being anywhere near death.Su Ming narrowed his eyes and quickly cut a few more wounds on the creature so, it was unable to recover within a short period of time. He quickly turned and ran away. As he ran, he would kick the stones he had placed in the tunnel earlier whenever he saw them. They became obstructions in the tunnel for the Wings of the Moon.While he did stop to kick the stones, Su Ming took pride in his speed. In the span of just a few breaths, he sped through the tunnel and reached the area of the cave surrounded by many other small holes.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m here!\u201d The moment he arrived, Su Ming heard Bai Ling calling out to him weakly.He saw Bai Ling hiding in one of the small holes with a pale and terrified face. She was shaking. Bai Ling arrived a long time ago but she did not know where the exit was. She did not dare move around recklessly, afraid that she would run into the Wings of the Moon again.The Bai Ling before Su Ming\u2019s eyes was not the proud and witty girl in the square. She was like a frightened little animal. When he saw the anxiety in her eyes, Su Ming laughed.\u201cYou\u2026 How can you still laugh?!\u201d Bai Ling was very nervous. She was about to continue speaking when Su Ming approached her quickly and grabbed her arm, running towards one of the many holes nearby.\u201cThis is the exit?\u201d she whispered softly to him. For some reason, after Bai Ling looked at Su Ming her fears decreased.Su Ming nodded his head. He did not speak instead, he grabbed Bai Ling\u2019s arm and ran towards the tunnel at full speed. He could hear Bai Ling panting. The sound was very pleasant to the ears. Su Ming\u2019s heartbeat quickened. He did not know whether it was due to the running or the soft skin he was touching in his hand.Bai Ling did not speak again. She let Su Ming hold her hand as they ran through the dangerous tunnels. Her heart pounded against her chest and gradually, she felt the same way as Su Ming. The emotion allowed her fears and despair to dissipate.However, the silence did not last long. Soon, Su Ming brought Bai Ling back to the place he used for the quenching of herbs. When they arrived, Su Ming released her hand and he cut through the tiny holes on the ground using the horn. They seemed to be lighting up with fire. In the middle of it, he would sometimes frown as if he was thinking about something.There was also fire burning underneath the cauldron not far ahead.Bai Ling watched Su Ming\u2019s actions with increasing anxiety.Even then, she felt like it was all a dream. She had fallen into despair when she was captured by the Wings of the Moon. Yet the things that happened when Su Ming arrived made her think she was dreaming.At that moment, ear-splitting shrieks traveled from the deep within the cave and became stronger as time passed by. They were approaching at an extremely quick speed. Bai Ling shivered and moved closer to Su Ming instinctively. Before she could get any closer, Su Ming grabbed her hand and immediately went past the small holes as he looked back at the cave.Not long after, the volume of the shrieks increased exponentially and three Wings of the Moon flew towards them ferociously. Bai Ling quivered. She was about to retreat when Su Ming brought his horn out. He cracked open the ground where the fire flowed towards the cauldron, connecting the crack with another ravine.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA fire curtain immediately rose from the ground. Its strength was akin to a sea of fire. The three Wings of the Moon who were rushing towards them were enveloped by the sea of fire. Mournful cries rang through the air. They crashed onto the ground and shattered. A cold gust of wind gushed out from their remains and mixed with the fire. Su Ming\u2019s face was somber under the fire\u2019s illumination. Bai Ling, who stood behind him became even more terrified.\u201cThey\u2026 They\u2019re afraid of fire?\u201d Bai Ling asked softly after a while.\u201cThey worshiped fire when they were still human. Fire was their glory. But when they were turned into Wings of the Moon, not only did they lose their conscience and their bodies, they also lost their glory\u2026\u201d\u201cThey were not afraid of fire after they lost their glory. No, they felt guilty towards it\u2026 They lived by fire and they died by fire\u2026\u201d Su Ming muttered.

The scenes he saw that night weighed heavy against his chest and tightened around his heart. It was a desolate and sad kind of feeling.\u2018Just who was that corpse in Fire Berserker Tribe..? Why was he the only one who managed to end his own life before he turned into a Wings of the Moon..? Perhaps he was\u2026 one of the stronger Berserkers in Fire Berserker Tribe\u2026\u2019As Su Ming recalled the strange corpse in his head, he sighed, then turned his attention to the thing that occupied his mind even more \u2013 the complicated words he saw.\u2018The desire to obtain Berserk spreads to all corners of the earth.

Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire!\u2019Su Ming did not understand what the words meant. While he was thinking about them, he saw Bai Ling standing by his side. She was looking at her surroundings. Her gaze was curious. It was clear that she was unaware of the place\u2019s purpose.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Miss Bai Ling.\u201d Su Ming smiled slightly and crawled out of the cave through the entrance.Bai Ling quickly followed him. She had wanted to leave a long time ago. Every breath she spent at the place made her feel uncomfortable.The moment they got out of the tunnel, a gust of wind immediately brushed against their skins. They felt like they were about to be blown away by the storm. Bai Ling\u2019s face was pale as she held onto a rock next to her.She had been pampered as she grew up in the tribe and practically never climbed such a mountain before. Even if she gritted her teeth to endure it, her increasingly ashen face exposed her fears.Su Ming looked at Bai Ling. He had never seen a girl of her beauty before. Her pale face especially made her look delicate.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll carry you.\u201d Su Ming scratched his head but his heart was starting beat quicker.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Bai Ling hesitated for a moment then looked at the bottom of the mountain. It looked like an endless abyss. Finally, she nodded her head.Su Ming\u2019s spirits were lifted and he squatted down in front of Bai Ling. Bai Ling blushed as she climbed onto Su Ming\u2019s back silently. Her arms found their way around Su Ming\u2019s neck instinctively.Su Ming blinked. She was a soft presence on his back. He could also clearly smell a nice fragrance wafting into his nostrils. He took a deep breath as an indescribable feeling blossomed in his chest.\u201cHey\u2026 Hold on tight. If you fall, don\u2019t blame me,\u201d Su Ming said instinctively. However, he did not hear any sound coming from his back. After a moment of hesitation, he shifted his focus on climbing down the mountain.With his agility and familiarity with the mountain, carrying someone would not have affected his speed too much. Yet, for some reason today, Su Ming only took the steep paths. Sometimes, he would even jump down, making the person on his back scream. Then he would grab onto some rocks or vines as he fell.When he felt the delicate person on his back holding onto him tighter, a pleased expression appeared on Su Ming\u2019s face.The time required to descend from the top to the foot of Black Flame Mountain was actually quite short but Su Ming spent an entire two hours to climb down. When Bai Ling got off his back, her face was entirely red and her eyes were filled will fear. Su Ming felt a slight hint of pity that this whole thing had ended. He coughed into his hand and looked at Bai Ling.\u201cWe\u2019re in the forest now. The snow is very thick here. There are also quite a lot of traps placed here. There\u2019s also some distance left before you can reach Dark Dragon Tribe. It\u2019ll be dangerous for you go back alone. How about this? I\u2019ll escort you to Dark Dragon Tribe first, then I\u2019ll go back home,\u201d Su Ming spoke slowly and kept an eye on Bai Ling\u2019s expression. When he saw that Bai Ling hesitated, joy blossomed in his chest and he quickly spoke again.\u201cBut the road back to your place is rather difficult to travel. Look, I don\u2019t mind carrying you on my back again. This way, we can save time and I can go back home faster too.\u201d Su Ming frowned and spoke once he looked at the sky.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Bai Ling bit her lip as her cheeks flushed red again. She could tell he did everything earlier on purpose when they were descending from Black Flame Mountain. If it continued\u2026 Her eyes flashed with anger due to the embarrassment she felt.\u201cHey, I saved you, you know?\u201d Su Ming widened his eyes. He saw the anger in Bai Ling\u2019s eyes and felt a little guilty. Nonetheless, when he remembered that he had saved her, he felt his actions were justified.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to? Fine, you\u2019re a Berserker anyway. There may be a lot of wild beasts and traps here, maybe even some Wings of the Moon. But, if you\u2019re careful, you should be fine\u2026 Alright, I\u2019ll be taking my leave.\u201d Su Ming yawned and turned towards the direction of his tribe. However before he could even take a few steps forward, he heard a gentle voice speaking anxiously.\u201cThen\u2026 thank you\u2026 I don\u2019t know the way, please send me back to my tribe\u2026\u201dSu Ming\u2019s spirits immediately lifted but he kept a straight face. He even frowned a little, looking as if he was extremely reluctant to escort her back. He cast a glance at Bai Ling, then crouched down and spoke impatiently.\u201cHurry up. We\u2019ll see whether we can get back before night falls. If we can\u2019t, we\u2019ll have to find a place to spend the night.\u201dBai Ling widened her eyes and stared at Su Ming. She was beginning to somewhat understand the person before her. When she thought of the incident that happened at the square, she did not know what to say to him.More importantly, he appeared when she had given up all hope. She would never forget the resolution and determination in his eyes when he appeared in the cave.Blushing, Bai Ling gently walked to Su Ming\u2019s side and climbed onto that frail back of his once more. She could hear her heart beating rapidly against her chest but she could not identify the emotion she was experiencing at that moment.Su Ming ran through the forest like a monkey with Bai Ling on his back. He really liked the sweet smell she exuded. As he ran, he changed his path and circled around the forest.After a while, Bai Ling\u2019s eyes glinted with an odd expression. She started to wrap her arms tighter around Su Ming\u2019s neck.\u201cWe\u2019ve walked through this place three times\u2026\u201d she spoke softly as she looked at a withered tree not far from their location.\u201cWhat? Really? Am I lost? Wait, I\u2019ll go check.\u201d Su Ming faltered in his footsteps. He looked surprised and scrutinized his surroundings before he nodded his head gravely.\u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ve never come to this place before.\u201d There was no hint of awkwardness on his face as he changed direction and started running once again.Time passed by slowly. They only managed to cover about half the distance to Dark Mountain Tribe by sunset, a destination they should have arrived at by twilight. However, Su Ming brought Bai Ling to Dark Mountain Tribe on the way back. He looked at his tribe from afar. When he saw no signs of abnormality from within the tribe, he felt at ease and left.When Bai Ling saw the sky darkening, the expression in her eyes became even odder.Once the sky became completely dark, Su Ming stopped at a part of the forest and looked at Bai Ling helplessly.\u201cLooks like we\u2019ll have to spend the night here\u2026 The forest is dangerous at night. We can only move ahead tomorrow morning.\u201dThe cunning look Su Ming saw the first time he met Bai Ling had returned. She watched Su Ming quietly and did not speak. Under her gaze, Su Ming felt increasingly guilty.\u201cAlright then, let\u2019s spend the night here.\u201d After a while, Bai Ling smiled. Her smile was really beautiful and her wild vibe resurfaced.Su Ming touched his nose and smiled as well. He got up and built a temporary resting place on a big tree. Then he sat there with Bai Ling.Both of them fell silent. It was as though they did not know what to say to each other.\u201cI still don\u2019t know your name.\u201d After some time, Bai Ling looked at Su Ming. Her eyes were even brighter under the moonlight.\u201cI\u2019m Su Ming. I know your name is Bai Ling,\u201d Su Ming said as he looked at Bai Ling and smiled.\u201cYou lied to me at the square, right? Hmph, I thought it was odd when I went back to the tribe,\u201d said Bai Ling as she blinked and wrinkled her nose. It was really adorable.\u201cThat is\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re also not the Young Lord of Dark Mountain Tribe, right?\u201d Bai Ling looked around with her bright eyes and spoke while chuckling softly.Su Ming scratched his head, not knowing what to say. At that moment, snow started falling from the sky. The entire sky was decorated with white flakes of snow.\u201cOh, it\u2019s snowing.\u201d Su Ming changed the subject by immediately lifting his head and looking at the snow.Bai Ling smiled through her eyes. She did not continue with the topic and chose to look at the sky as well. She looked at the snow. Some of them fell on her face. It felt cool and comfortable.The snow became heavier and the two individuals in the forest seemed entranced by its beauty. They were silent.\u201cSu Ming, thank you\u2026\u201d The sky was already dark to begin with. However as the moonlight reflected off the surface of the snow, their surroundings appeared to be illuminated by a silvery light. As such, the forest was not as dark as it was previously.\u201cThank you for saving me\u2026 Can you tell me about yourself? Why were you there?\u201d Bai Ling looked at Su Ming and spoke softly.\u201cI usually go to the mountains to pick herbs. That was a place I found accidentally and I use it as a shelter to avoid the cold. I just didn\u2019t expect to see Wings of the Moon yesterday\u2026\u201d Su Ming did not talk about using the place for quenching herbs. Instead , he told her a different story.Time passed by slowly. During the snowy night, Su Ming and Bai Ling talked with each other more and gradually got to know each other\u2026 Their voices were carried away by the winds blowing in the winter.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe elder of Dark Dragon Tribe is my grandma\u2026 My dad and mom left Dark Dragon Tribe a long time ago. I heard from my grandma that they went to a tribe bigger than Wind Stream. They haven\u2019t been back for a long time\u2026\u201d Bai Ling hugged herself and spoke about her past in a low tone under the snow.\u201cI don\u2019t even know who my dad and mom are\u2026 I was brought back to the tribe by the elder\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled.\u201cAh, so that\u2019s how it is. That\u2019s why I thought you looked much frailer compared to the others. You\u2019re not even as tall as I am. Your elder must have been mistreating you.\u201d Bai Ling widened her eyes.\u201cNo way, the elder is very good to me. Besides, you may be tall but I heard from the elder that in a few years, I\u2019ll also be as tall as you. Also, you\u2019re not as big as the other girls in your tribe,\u201d Su Ming laughed and said.\u201cThat\u2019s because my elder taught me a Berserker Art. I heard that my mom asked my grandma to teach me the Art when I grow up.\u201d Bai Ling looked at Su Ming\u2019s hair, now dyed white with snow. She smiled teasingly as she spoke.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The light in her eyes was so bright it made the strange feeling in Su Ming\u2019s chest become stronger.\u201cI\u2019m not the only one. Your hair has also become white. You\u2019re an old woman now.\u201d Su Ming pointed at Bai Ling and laughed.The two of them laughed and talked, feeling more familiar with each other. During that snowy night, Su Ming was happy but he also felt that time was passing by too quickly. Before he knew it, the sky started to brighten up.It was not due to the snow but because the sun had risen.Night was over. When the sun shone and brightened up the sky, snow was still falling. Su Ming and Bai Ling came down from the tree. Once they cleaned themselves up, they smiled at each other.Su Ming did not say anything but squatted down instead. Bai Ling\u2019s eyes lit up briefly and she climbed once more onto his frail back. A warm feeling blossomed in her chest.This time, the strange feeling became clearer the closer he got to Dark Dragon Tribe. He was unwilling to part with Bai Ling. Slowly, he became silent, his footsteps became slower and he started circling around the forest again.Bai Ling hung onto Su Ming\u2019s back. Just like the day before, she saw a lot of the sights repeatedly and knew that Su Ming was walking around in circles. However this time, she did not speak. She placed her head against Su Ming\u2019s back, listening to his heart beat.Nevertheless, everything had to come to an end eventually. The sun had risen to the highest point in the sky and begun setting once again. The outline of Dark Dragon Tribe appeared in Su Ming\u2019s line of sight despite the snow falling from the sky.When he saw the tribe, Su Ming placed Bai Ling on the ground with a smile on his face.\u201cYou\u2019re home.\u201dBai Ling took a look at her tribe, then back at Su Ming. The expression was on her beautiful face was unreadable. She nodded her head silently and walked towards Su Ming. She then swept the snow on Su Ming\u2019s body away with her clean hands.\u201cThank you\u2026 I hope you\u2019ll return to your tribe soon\u2026\u201d Bai Ling opened her mouth again like she was about to say something but in the end, she just remained silent. She smiled beautifully and walked back to her tribe.Su Ming stood there watching Bai Ling gradually disappear from his sight. As he looked at the petite figure occasionally turning towards him to wave, his mind went blank.As the distance between them grew bigger, the falling snow became an invisible barrier. It obstructed his sight and covered the figure of the person walking away. It was akin to walking past an icy plain. If he did not return, he would not see the ice melting. It was like a memory. If he did not remember it, he would not be able to recall the voice of the person who sighed in that memory.After a long time, Su Ming shook his head. He took one more look at Dark Dragon Tribe and turned away. The snow had been his companion when he came and the snow was still his companion when he left.The snow fell on his body and on his hair but Su Ming thought he was missing something.\u2018Do I like her..?\u2019Su Ming ran in the forest towards Dark Mountain Tribe. There was a frown between his brows as he ran. In his head, he only saw Bai Ling.\u2018It\u2019s different from how I feel towards Chen Xin\u2026\u2019Su Ming took a deep breath and shook his head vigorously. He wanted to be rid of the strange and unfamiliar feeling in his chest. Once he calmed down, he ran even quicker.When the sky became dark, the stars shone around the moon and the snow still fell endlessly from the sky. Su Ming finally returned to his home, Dark Mountain Tribe.He stole a look at the tribe from afar yesterday and could roughly tell that the tribe was unharmed. Now that he was back, he saw his tribe members standing guard on night watch outside the giant wooden gate.The tribe settlement was very quiet. The bonfire in the square was still burning as usual and making crackling sounds. Su Ming walked in and looked around. He then arrived outside the elder\u2019s house.There was still light from the elder\u2019s house, a clear sign that he had not gone to rest.\u201cSu Ming, right? Come in.\u201d The elder\u2019s voice traveled from within the house with a hint of fatigue.Su Ming lifted the leather flap gently and walked in. He saw the elder sitting cross-legged in the middle. His white hair was slightly messy too.\u201cElder,\u201d Su Ming called out to him in a low voice. Then he sat in a corner.\u201cThe tribe is fine, don\u2019t worry.\u201d The elder looked at Su Ming with a smile on his face. He gestured for Su Ming to sit by his side and patted Su Ming\u2019s head, his smile becoming wider.\u201cYou\u2019ve reached the third level? You did well!\u201dSu Ming looked at the elder and slowly told him everything he saw within the cave. He went into the details especially regarding the corpse. As he talked about it, he saw the elder\u2019s face becoming serious.\u201cWherefore doth thou wail, o blue sky\u2026? Elder, what does this mean?\u201d Su Ming frowned.\u201cThe legends are true\u2026\u201d The elder looked at the leather flaps as if his eyes could see through them and they allowed him to look at Dark Mountain.\u201cThat should be a rhetorical question. Perhaps it meant \u2018Why should I be sad when compared to the lonely, endless sky?\u2019 Or perhaps, there is another meaning to it\u2026\u201d The elder sighed. Then he spoke slowly. It was a voice burdened by his experiences in life when a thought struck his head.\u201cI don\u2019t really understand the words about worshiping the fire. Perhaps you saw it because it\u2019s your destiny.\u201d The elder averted his gaze from the flaps and looked at Su Ming kindly.\u201cI\u2019ll be going to Wind Stream Tribe in a month\u2019s time. If you\u2019re wandering outside by then, remember to come back.\u201d\u201cOne more thing, elder. I saved a Dark Dragon Tribe member in the nest of the Wings of the Moon. Her name is Bai Ling. She\u2019s the granddaughter of the elder of Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201d The elder nodded his head. Then as he remembered something, he spoke once again.\u201cBai Ling?\u201d He was momentarily surprised. He fell into silence for a while. Then told Su Ming to go back and rest. Once Su Ming left, a hint of nostalgia appeared in the elder\u2019s eyes.\u2018Lei Su\u2026 Your granddaughter was saved by my little La Su accidentally\u2026 Perhaps this will allow you to reduce your hatred towards me a little\u2026\u2019The elder sighed and the hint of nostalgia in his eyes grew thicker.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe blood red moon appeared earlier\u2026 Then there\u2019s also the strong Qi that suddenly appeared from Black Mountain Tribe during that night\u2026 I can feel disaster brewing\u2026\u201d The elder closed his eyes as he mumbled. His voice was filled with worry.Su Ming left the elder\u2019s house and walked around the tribe. He did not return to his own house but went to Lei Chen\u2019s. When he saw that Lei Chen was injured but still up and about, he applied salve on his wounds. Once he did so, his worries went away.Lei Chen was also happy to see Su Ming. He hit his chest and bragged about his fight against the Wings of the Moon. Su Ming left smiling after they talked for a long time.It was already midnight but Su Ming\u2019s gaze fell on a brightly lit house not far away. As he did so, hesitation appeared on his face.It was the Head of the Guards\u2019 house. It was also Bei Ling\u2019s house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He walked back to his own house underneath the moonlight, surrounded by falling snow.His house was cold. Perhaps it was because he had been away for a few days. He could even see his own breath coming out in white puffs. A bystander would have felt cold just by watching it.The house lacked warmth. It was completely different compared to Lei Chen\u2019s house when he visited.Su Ming quietly searched for some firewood and coal. He then quietly kindled a fire alone in the house. He could have resisted the cold easily with the Qi of a third level practitioner of the Blood Solidification Realm. Yet for some unknown reason, he felt that the house was lacking something.He sighed and lit up the firewood. The fire slowly spread to all the wood in the pile and brought about a sense of warmth to the house. It chased away the cold and spread the heat around all corners of the house.Su Ming sat beside the fire and stared into it, letting his mind wander as he did so. He had always been envious of Lei Chen, Bei Ling and Chen Xin since he was young because they had a home. They had parents.No matter how well the elder took care of Su Ming, he was still the Elder of the tribe. Most of his time was spent protecting and helping the members of the tribe. Since he was young, Su Ming already learned how to be independent. He learned how to live by himself and most of all, he learned how to be alone.It was snowing heavily outside. The winds also moaned as they blew past the tribe. They caused the leather flaps on the door to flutter, making crunching noises. Sometimes, wind would escape through the door and flaps into the house, causing the fire to move about violently.Su Ming sat by the fire hugging his knees as the light from the fire shone on him. He looked into the fire and after a long while, he sighed.\u2018The elder said I was adopted\u2026 Then are my mom and dad still around..?\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes were filled with loneliness. He had kept this thought buried deep within over the years because he did not want anyone to see that he was lonely. He always hid it behind a smile.On that snowy night however, after feeling the warmth in Lei Chen\u2019s house and returning to his own cold wooden house\u00b9, he could not hide it any longer.\u201cBai Ling\u2019s dad and mom are also not by her side. I wonder if she\u2019s already resting or is she like me, sitting by the fire thinking about\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled as he recalled Bai Ling\u2019s figure and her bell-like laughter.He froze all of a sudden. Somewhere in his mind he began formulating an answer to why he felt so strangely towards Bai Ling. Part of it was perhaps related to her beauty but that was not the main reason.It was mostly because Su Ming felt the same sort of loneliness beneath her smiles and cunning.As time passed by, the warmth within the house increased and chased away the cold. Condensed droplets of water began forming on the walls of the house.The heat seemed to warm Su Ming\u2019s heart, causing the loneliness he felt to dissipate slightly. Right then, as though the heavens were against it, a huge gust of wind blew past. It brought a large amount of snow from the lands outside into the tribe. The wind was so strong, it was like an invisible hand sweeping across the tribe.The creaking noise from Su Ming\u2019s house immediately became louder and even the door connected to the leather flaps was thrown open. The howling sound of the wind immediately filled the house. Some of the snow also found its way into his house and fell on the fire. It sizzled furiously, before dying away quickly.Su Ming lifted his head and looked at the door shaking in the wind. Then he looked at his house that was invaded by the cold so easily just as it finally started to warm up. He stood up silently and left his house. He then stood in the blizzard and stared at the sky.A vague outline of the moon was in the sky, which was being ravaged by the blizzard.As he looked at the moon, Su Ming thought of the Wings of the Moon and of the corpse he saw in the ruins of the Fire Berserker Tribe. Most of all, he thought of the words left behind by the corpse.\u201cThe desire to obtain Berserk spreads to all corners of the earth. Let fire burn in mine blood, let mine thoughts burn the skies, let fire burn heaven into ashes\u2026 If \u2018t be true the moon of fire appears from the clouds on the endless earth\u2026 I wilt sink into deep bethought as the fire in mine blood burns, the nine is the utmost of all, and the one is the law. Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire!\u201dSu Ming mumbled. These words had appeared in his mind numerous times. He was still trying make sense of them but felt that he was missing something.\u2018The desire to obtain Berserk spreads to all corners of the earth\u2026\u201d I understand what he meant by the desire to obtain Berserk. It basically means the lust for Berserk but it\u2019s not something good\u2026 But who\u2026 exactly was the persona\u2026? Was the corpse talking about himself\u2026? Doesn\u2019t seem likely.\u2019Su Ming sat outside his house in the blizzard. To him, there was no difference being outside or inside the house. There was no warmth in both places.At the very least when he was outside, he had the wind as his companion and he could also look at the moon.\u2018Who was the persona\u2026? I don\u2019t know. Then there\u2019s the second half of the lines, \u201c\u2026spreads to all corners of the earth. Let fire burn in mine blood, let mine thoughts burn the skies, let fire burn heaven into ashes.\u201d These lines are illustrating a picture. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re talking about fusing fire into blood and just by thinking about it, they can burn the skies\u2026\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes shone brightly. He sat in the snow and looked at the moon in the sky as he sank into his thoughts.\u2018If \u2018t be true the moon of fire appears from the clouds on the endless earth\u2026\u201d The elder once said that the sun was Yang and the moon was Yin. What he said made sense. During daytime, you will usually feel warmth but when it\u2019s nighttime, it would usually be cold.\u2018But what is the moon of fire though? The color of fire is red. Could it be referring to the red moon, the blood moon?\u2019Su Ming frowned, unable to understand it.\u2018I wilt sink into deep bethought as the fire in mine blood burns, the nine is the utmost of all, and the one is the law. Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire\u2026\u201d This seems to be referring to an action\u2026 the authorities of Fire\u2026\u2019Su Ming looked at the moon in the sky as a thought flashed through his mind, causing his eyes to brighten up.\u2018Could it be\u2026? This is actually a Berserker Art!\u2019Su Ming\u2019s breathing quickened. He took a deep breath. After he analyzed the words in his head, his belief that they actually conveyed a Berserker Art was even stronger!\u2018\u201dThe desire to obtain Berserk spreads to all corners of the earth. Let fire burn in mine blood, let mine thoughts burn the skies, let fire burn heaven into ashes\u2026\u201d These lines are actually talking about how strong the Berserker Art is!\u2018\u201dI wilt sink into deep bethought as the fire in mine blood burns, the nine is the utmost of all, and the one is the law. Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire\u2026\u201d These words could only be talking about how one could learn this Berserker Art!\u2018That\u2019s right, that\u2019s what it should be. As for \u201cIf \u2018t be true the moon of fire appears from the clouds on the endless earth\u201d\u2026 this should be talking about the prerequisites for learning this Berserker Art!\u2019Su Ming brightened up. These words had been bothering him for the past few days. Now that he had analyzed them, he immediately cheered up. Nonetheless, after a while he frowned again.\u2018There\u2019s still something wrong. The prerequisite to learn this Berserker Art is the moon of fire but now it is not\u2026 Must I wait for a few more years until the blood red moon appears again before I can learn this?\u2019Su Ming fell silent until the moon in the sky was replaced with the light from the sun. Even when morning had arrived, Su Ming still had no idea how to learn the Berserker Art.With a sigh, Su Ming stood up and moved his body. As the members of the tribe came out of their houses and began to busy themselves with a new day of work, Su Ming went out of the settlement.\u2018The requirement to reach the fourth level of the Blood Solidification Realm is 25 blood veins. I only have 11 blood veins now, so I need to hurry up with my training. I still need to create that Mountain Spirit as well. I wonder what its effects will be. I hope it\u2019ll be useful for my training.\u2019Su Ming ran towards the forest. His speed had increased once again ever since he reached the third level of the Blood Solidification Realm.He arrived at Black Flame Mountain by noon and climbed towards the cave. Halfway up the mountain, a smile appeared on his face. He heard Xiao Hong\u2019s voice. He lifted his head and saw a red silhouette lying beside the entrance of the cave. In its paws was a wild fruit, which it was eating away at lightning speed. As it ate, its eyes kept wandering around.When Su Ming saw the monkey, it also saw Su Ming. Its eyes lit up and it ran towards Su Ming as it threw away the half-devoured fruit. It even climbed onto Su Ming\u2019s back and let out a few cries of excitement.A happy smile appeared on Su Ming\u2019s face and he continued climbing. Not long after, he arrived outside the cave. He took in a deep breath of the mountain air before climbing into the cave with the little monkey.Time passed by peacefully. Su Ming once again returned to his daily life of quenching herbs and training. During the night, he would also look at the moon in the sky and think about the true meaning of the moon of fire.He even spent some effort to create some small holes on the walls of the cave he used for quenching herbs. This was so that he could observe the moon outside through the little holes even if he was sitting in the cave.Muffled sounds came out from the cave and as time passed by, the sounds gradually became much less. On the seventh day, Su Ming finally managed to create Mountain Spirit.It was a dark blue pill. The medicinal scent from the pill was not strong but when he placed it under his nose to sniff it, it was like sniffing mountain air. There was also an indescribable feeling roaming about his entire body.\u2018Mountain Spirit.\u2019Su Ming squatted down outside the cave and looked at the pill in his hands as he welcomed the sunset. The creation of this pill was much harder for him than Scattering Dust. The chances of failure were very high.He had already used half of the Cloud Gauze Grass he bought back but only managed to create two of them. Due to the difficulty in creating Mountain Spirit, Su Ming was reluctant to even use one of them for an experiment.\u2018It should not be poisonous\u2026\u2019Su Ming sniffed the medicinal scent coming from the pill. He took a long time observing it, trying to decide what their effects could be based on his experiences. Gradually, the sky darkened. When it became completely dark, Su Ming\u2019s eyes became resolute. He placed the pill into his mouth.The pill was different from Scattering Dust. It did not melt when he placed it on his tongue. Su Ming frowned. He chewed it a few times before the pill was crushed. Then he swallowed it.Nonetheless, he felt nothing after waiting for a while. Su Ming touched his stomach and waited a little longer. He even went back into the cave to activate and circulate the blood in his veins. Even so, it was just like before. There was no difference.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018That\u2019s strange\u2026\u2019Su Ming sank into deep thought. After a moment, his eyes brightened up and he took a small bottle containing Scattering Dust from his bosom and swallowed one of the pills.The Scattering Dust immediately melted in his mouth and a shred of heat spread through his entire body. Yet at that moment, a sudden astonishing burst of heat erupted from his body!Translator\u2019s Note :\u00b9 Now then, for all readers who compared this to the RAWs, in chapters 1 to 25, the houses were wooden houses, and so for consistency\u2019s sake these houses will remain as wooden houses, not leather tents.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was as if the heat had always been inside Su Ming\u2019s body and was only activated due to the Scattering Dust he took. Su Ming shuddered. He felt as though his entire body was about to burn. It even made him think of the man from Black Mountain Tribe who died due to his Scattering Blood.Su Ming did not panic. Instead, he remained calm. While he did feel like he was burning, in his state of calm he discovered the difference slowly. The burning sensation did not come from his blood. In fact, the blood in his body was flowing and circulating around his body at a frightening speed.The fact that Su Ming felt as if he was burning was because his blood was circulating too quickly. He could even feel his own heartbeat increasing at a maddening speed. It felt like exploding.\u201cWhat a strong medicine!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s face was red, but still he never lost his calm in the slightest. As he mumbled to himself, he closed his eyes. He immediately sank into the feeling of his blood and Qi circulating in his body.Sweat covered his body. The 11 blood veins also appeared simultaneously and gave off a piercing light. The red light lit up the entire cave. It looked like it was hell dyed in the color of blood.As his Qi circulated throughout his body, the red light on his body became even stronger. A large amount of blue veins also appeared on his body and looked as if they were pulsing. They made Su Ming look positively ferocious.Two hours passed by. Within those two hours, the beast skin shirt Su Ming wore appeared to be soaked in water. It was dripping with a large amount of sweat. Su Ming\u2019s body was also burning red. The 11 blood veins shone so brilliantly on his skin that they looked like wounds.At that moment, Su Ming opened his eyes. They were bloodshot. He roared and as he did so, the 12th blood vein manifested on his skin!The speed in which it manifested was so quick. It seemed to have moved from its illusionary state to the physical state almost instantly. Su Ming\u2019s Qi became stronger once more.However, it was not the end. After the 12th blood vein appeared, the burning sensation in Su Ming\u2019s body only disappeared slightly. Very soon, Su Ming let out another roar and the 13th blood vein manifested itself on his skin!When the 13th blood vein manifested, there was movement in his hair despite the lack of wind. A strong presence then flared up from within his frail body.The speed of the blood flow in his body no longer made him feel as though he had insufficient blood. Instead, he felt as if he had too much. If he did not concentrate on manifesting the blood veins, his body would have exploded. Despite the appearance of two blood veins, some of the burning sensation was still prevalent in his body.Su Ming\u2019s face was twisted. The burning sensation over his entire body was hard to bear. He lifted his right hand and tore away his shirt, leaving himself bare-chested and showing all 13 blood veins on his body. They did not appear in order and were instead scattered across Su Ming\u2019s chest, back, and arms.The color of the blood veins were a bloody red. They looked like would have bled at any moment. There was a large amount of sweat on Su Ming\u2019s body and under the illumination of the red light, it made him appear strangely beautiful.Su Ming\u2019s eyes became increasingly bloodshot but there was no hint of madness in them. They were still calm. Everything was within his control. As he felt the Qi within his body, Su Ming did not hesitate and activated the blood in his veins repeatedly in accordance to his inheritance from the statue of the God of Berserkers. It refined and thickened the viscosity of the blood in his veins!Another hour passed by. When Su Ming lifted his head and shouted at the sky, the 14th blood vein appeared vaguely on his body!Hi shout echoed endlessly within the cave. It sounded like a lot of people roaring at the same time.\u201cCome out, 14th blood vein!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s body trembled as the strong presence within his body became even more intense. Judging by the speed of the 14th blood vein\u2019s manifestation, it was supposed to appear in its complete form on his body soon.Yet even after 15 minutes passed by, the 14th blood vein continued to struggle as though there was something missing.Su Ming could feel his Qi slowing down within his body. The heat in his body had almost dissipated completely. If it ended, he would have failed to manifest the 14th blood vein and he would have had to wait for the next time to do so.Without any hesitation, Su Ming grabbed the other Mountain Spirit lying by his side!Su Ming immediately placed the pill in his mouth and bit down furiously, swallowing it once he crushed it. Then he immediately took out another Scattering Dust and swallowed it. His body began shaking furiously. The burning red color that had almost disappeared from his skin appeared once again, turning his skin into a shocking red.The heat he felt in his body burned intensely once again. Its intensity was even stronger than before, reaching a height where even Su Ming found difficult to bear.\u201cCome out, 14th blood vein!\u201d There was a vicious side to Su Ming that even he himself did not realize. It had been accumulating for a long time, little by little from the little things that happened in his life.As he growled once again, the 14th blood vein immediately manifested and gave out an enchanting red glow. Once the 14th blood vein appeared, Su Ming did not stop. He immediately swallowed another two Scattering Dusts all for the purpose of increasing his power in one go.He had been continuously thinking during the seven days of quenching and creating medication. Su Ming knew about the early appearance of the Wings of the Moon and the worry behind the elder\u2019s smile in the tribe. He may not have spoken about it but in the corners of his mind, he knew that disaster was about to fall on the tribe.Once he thought about the Elder of Dark Mountain Tribe arriving at a breakthrough in his training, the elder mentioning there was a traitor within the tribe and all the talk about danger, Su Ming became extremely worried. He wanted to help the elder and the tribe but with his current strength, it was clear that it was not enough.He wanted to become stronger. He wanted to become powerful!After the 14th blood vein appeared, Su Ming once again activated and circulated the Qi in his body. The 15th blood vein almost seemed like it was forced out of his body by the insane flow of blood in his body.After a long while, Su Ming quivered in pain but he did not stop. As the blood circulated in his body, he bellowed and the 15th blood vein manifested!The 15 blood veins resembled 15 scars on the naked top half of his body. As they glowed in a red light, Su Ming looked even more powerful.However, Su Ming was not satisfied with only 15 blood veins. He continued to circulate the blood in his veins as time passed by.The 16th blood vein appeared abruptly!By then, most of the heat in his body had disappeared. It seemed like it was about to end. A cold glint appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. Without a sound, he lifted his right hand and slammed it against his chest. With that hit, a strong force traveled into his body and stimulated his rapidly beating heart.\u201cCome out, 17th blood vein!\u201dDue to the shock, his heart pumped out more blood which rushed around his body rapidly once again. Then on his chest, the 17th vein appeared!Once the 17th blood vein appeared, the burning sensation in Su Ming\u2019s body dissipated. There was no longer any heat and intensity in his body. His entire body felt drained. Su Ming knew it was the aftereffect once the effects of the medication went away.At the same time, there was a light stinging pain in his body. It meant that his body was injured during the forceful training earlier.\u201cI\u2019m a practitioner of the Ways of the Berserker. This sort of pain and injury is nothing!\u201d Su Ming mumbled. He could feel that the power in his body had increased by at least one fold. A look of resolution appeared in his eyes.He did not get up. Instead, he brought out an herb from his torn beast skin shirt. It was the Sky Stone he obtained earlier!This was the strongest herb he had besides the pills! Besides the portion he gave to Lei Chen, he would not have used it easily. Nonetheless, he brought them out with unwavering determination. He wanted to increase his strength as much as possible in one go.As Su Ming took the herb in his hand, he left out one leaf for later use and swallowed the rest. He also consumed a Scattering Dust to increase the effects of the herb.A cool sensation immediately erupted within his body. The residue of the heat immediately fused with the cold. A cold feeling began to form in Su Ming\u2019s body, causing the red color on the 17 blood veins to become even more distinctive.Su Ming\u2019s body began to turn blue in the cold but his blood once again circulated in his body rapidly. Two hours passed by, then another four hours. When the sky started to turn bright white, Xiao Hong came back from playing outside. Su Ming still sat there cross-legged without moving.Xiao Hong knew Su Ming was training. It laid down by his side and looked at him for a moment. Then it yawned and fell asleep.Morning became noon, then noon became dusk. Soon, the sky was dark once more. Only the light from the moon which fell on the snow scattered all over the land.There were no longer just 17 blood veins on Su Ming\u2019s body, but 19!The two extra blood veins appeared on his arms and glowed red\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMidnight came. The red light Su Ming\u2019s body lit up the entire cave. He slowly opened his eyes and let out a shaky breath. His eyes were filled with a threatening glint. When he saw Xiao Hong snoring lightly by his side and occasionally grabbing his own fur, he smiled.He averted his gaze from Xiao Hong\u2019s body and looked at the small holes decorating the walls of the cave. From his position, he could see the weather and the moon outside. Su Ming slowly closed his eyes and was about to activate the Qi within his body and cure the injuries he sustained during training.Just as he was about to close his eyes though, Su Ming suddenly opened them. He could feel something was different about the moon when he saw it from the multiple little holes right before.When he looked at it again, he widened his eyes!There was a hint of red on the moon in the sky\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he looked at the moon once again, the red hint had disappeared as though it was just an illusion. Su Ming\u2019s eyes turned grave. He did not believe that it was just an illusion. He became silent as he stared at the moon once again from the small holes on the wall.Time passed by slowly. While Su Ming looked at the moon, he did not circulate the Qi around his body. As such, the red light disappeared quickly from the cave and everything returned to normal. After a while, Su Ming frowned.\u2018Could it really be a mistake..?\u2019Su Ming sighed. He was just about to close his eyes and forget about the moon when a thought crossed his head. He frowned.\u2018That\u2019s not right!\u2019Somewhere in his mind, he caught onto a train of thought but the thoughts flitted around in his head as if they were about to disappear at any second. It was very difficult for him to gather them together.\u201cRed moon\u2026 red moon\u2026 red\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled and lowered his head to look at this body. He remembered the moment he saw the red moon was when the medicine had just worn off. His blood was circulating around his body according to his will, and there was red light lighting up the cave.His eyes gradually brightened up as he thought about it. The muddled thoughts in his head gradually became clear. After a moment, Su Ming instantaneously opened his eyes as he activated and circulated the blood in his body. The 19 blood veins appeared on his body at once and released a piercing red glow. Not only was his body enveloped in the red glow, the cave was also dyed in a red light.Su Ming focused his eyes on the moon from the multiple little holes. Under the glare of the red light, he took a deep breath as a look of comprehension appeared in his eyes. They became increasingly serious at the same time.At that very moment, the moon appeared red!The moon itself was not red but because the cave was enveloped in red, Su Ming was looking at the moon underneath the red light. It was only logical for him to think that the moon had turned scarlet.\u201cThe desire to obtain Berserk spreads to all corners of the earth. Let fire burn in mine blood, let mine thoughts burn the skies, let fire burn heaven into ashes\u2026 If \u2018t be true the moon of fire appears from the clouds on the endless earth\u2026 I wilt sink into deep bethought as the fire in mine blood burns, the nine is the utmost of all, and the one is the law. Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire!\u201d Su Ming looked at the red moon and mumbled.\u2018\u201dI wilt sink into deep bethought\u2026 I wilt sink into deep bethought\u2026\u201d The meaning of this line should be, the moon of fire will only appear if you think about it calmly and imagine it\u2026 But what am I imagining\u2026? \u201cAs the fire in mine blood burns, the nine is the utmost of all, and the one is the law. Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire\u2026\u201d No. These lines don\u2019t have much relation to imagination. It should be related to an action instead.\u2019Su Ming frowned. As of then, he was still controlling the circulation of blood in his body. It caused the red glow to become thicker. The red tint on the moon became clearer in his eyes.\u2018Imagination\u2026\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up abruptly as a thought struck him like thunder roaring in the sky.\u2018Could it be that I have to chant these lines? \u201cIf \u2018t be true the moon of fire appears from the clouds on the endless earth\u2026 I wilt sink into deep bethought!\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then the meaning is different. It doesn\u2019t mean that I should only start imagining when the moon of fire appears but I have to imagine the moon of fire appearing!\u2019Su Ming trembled. He felt that he had just caught onto something important!He took breathed in sharply and began thinking about the moon turning red in the sky quietly in his heart. The image kept repeating itself as time passed by. He even forgot about controlling the circulation of blood in his body once all his attention was focused on imagining the moon turning red. He also did not notice the blood red light in the cave had already faded away and the cave had returned to its normal shade of color.He lifted his head and looked at the moon from the numerous holes on the wall. The image in his head was projected onto the moon.\u201cRed moon\u2026 burning moon\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled. In his mind, the moon was red and the shade of red was becoming thicker, gradually turning the entire moon blood red.At that moment, Su Ming\u2019s entire body seemed to relax. He could feel a thin thread of red light falling down from the moon before his eyes. It floated through the little holes and fused into his eyes. Bit by bit, it flowed into his body and mixed with his blood.There was a cold sensation in his entire body and it assimilated into his blood, causing his Qi to slowly circulate on its own in his body. Su Ming did not realize it. He felt as if the entire world had disappeared. The only thing that existed was the red moon and it was becoming bigger and clearer in his sight.That red in the moon seemed to have some sort of mysterious force. As it shone, the light seeped into his body.Time passed by slowly. Xiao Hong had already woken up a long time ago and it was watching Su Ming with a dumb expression not far away. There was a puzzled look in its eyes. It also looked at the moon outside from the little holes but the moon looked just the same as it always did. It scratched its head and could not understand why Su Ming was daydreaming.No one noticed that at that very moment, amid the five summits on Dark Mountain, a mysterious change was also happening where all the Wings of the Moon were sleeping!It was especially so in the deeper parts of Black Flame Mountain. On the giant red tree within the magma covered basin, numerous line-like creatures were floating about. Sometimes, the faces of the Wings of the Moon would be visible. There were no looks of viciousness or sadness on their faces. Instead, there were expressions of obsession and excitement on their faces.No one knew what they were excited about but judging by the speed of their movements, they were extremely excited.It was as if they were struggling to fly out of the tree but were prevented from doing so by some unknown force.It also seemed like they felt something as though they were being summoned or\u2026 they were worshiping something\u2026 or perhaps\u2026 they felt the Berserker Powers they had lost since ancient times\u2026Within the Fire Berserker Tribe that existed during ancient times, the corpse lying at its borders seemed to remain unchanged even though it was soaked in the fiery magma. However the wall where its finger pointed at was empty. The words that Su Ming read the last time were gone.There was nothing there but the words were not erased by anyone. It was as though they never existed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven though the corpse was just a pile of bones, the look of mockery and aloofness on its face was even more distinct.Perhaps he was not mocking at what happened during his death but what happened after\u2026It was nighttime. As the moon was showed signs of leaving and the first rays of sunlight appeared, a person covered entirely in black walked into the deeper parts of Dark Mountain.It was the same person who appeared in Black Mountain Tribe the night of the blood red moon. He was walking very slowly. With each step he took, his body seemed to into something like an apparition. He would walk straight through the numerous dried trees in the forest.\u201cIt\u2019s not here either\u2026 Just where is it?!\u201d The person sighed and spoke in a hoarse voice as he walked into the distance. As the sun appeared in the sky, he disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The last shreds of darkness were being chased away by the rays of morning sun. The moon in the sky turned into a crescent moon and was about to disappear. Su Ming, who was still in the cave on Black Flame Mountain shivered and finally lowered his head.There was confusion, bafflement and most importantly, a shred of emptiness in his eyes. When Xiao Hong saw the expression on Su Ming\u2019s face, it immediately puffed its fur up and retreated quickly until its back was pressed against the wall of the cave. Fear and shock appeared across its face.He saw the faint shadow of the blood red moon slowly disappearing from Su Ming\u2019s eyes.The vague shadow of the blood red moon finally disappeared completely from Su Ming\u2019s eyes after a long time and he snapped out from his trance. Xiao Hong watched Su Ming by his side for a while with a dumbfounded expression. Bewilderment slowly edged itself onto its face.Su Ming took a deep breath. To him, the entire night had passed by in the blink of an eye. Now that his mind was clear, the memories of the night only served to make him even more confused. Once he checked his body however, all his confusion turned into shock.\u201cMy injuries\u2026 are all cured\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled. His body had been injured when he forcefully trained himself. While the injuries had not been serious, he still knew from experience that he needed to meditate for a few days to recover. Yet now, he recovered in one night.After a long while, Su Ming drew in a breath and lifted his head. He only saw the clear sky and sun from the numerous holes in the wall.\u2018That was indeed a Berserker Art, an Art belonging to the Fire Berserker Tribe! This Art has an incredible power. I only needed to sink into my thoughts for one night and all my injuries have healed\u2026\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up and he immediately activated the Qi in his body. Soon, all 19 blood veins appeared on his body.However when the 19 blood veins emerged, an odd expression appeared on Su Ming\u2019s face. He could faintly feel some leftover strength within himself. His expression became serious and once again, he began circulating the Qi around his entire body. When the Qi went through a few cycles around his entire body, the 20th blood vein appeared suddenly on his chest!Su Ming widened his eyes in shock. Once the Qi in his body dispersed, he became even more surprised with what happened the previous night.His heart pounded against his chest. The incredible effects from Mountain Spirit had caught him by surprise. In addition to the discovery of the mysterious effects of the Fire Berserker Art, a new path seemed to have opened itself right before Su Ming\u2019s eyes!\u2018Awakening! Perhaps I can reach the Awakening Realm and become a powerful Berserker in the Awakening Realm!\u2019Su Ming took a deep breath and quelled the excitement in his chest. Xiao Hong ran towards him from where it was not far away and climbed onto Su Ming\u2019s shoulders. It stared into Su Ming\u2019s eyes with a confused expression. It even brought its paws up to pinch Su Ming\u2019s cheeks.Su Ming laughed and pushed the little monkey away. They played around for a while before Xiao Hong hissed at Su Ming as if it remembered something. It raised its right paw and sniffed it. An elated expression appeared on its face. It even licked its paw a few times and placed it right before Su Ming like it wanted Su Ming to sniff it.Su Ming was momentarily surprised. He noticed Xiao Hong doing the same thing for the past few months and had a few theories about it. However, he always thought there was something off about his theories. Now that he saw it again, he looked at Xiao Hong\u2019s right paw in his face with hesitation. He then sniffed it as Xiao Hong looked at him expectantly.A foul smell wafted its way into his nose. It made him push the paw away. He found Xiao Hong\u2019s actions funny and annoying at the same time.Xiao Hong immediately glared at him. It seemed displeased with how Su Ming pushed his hand away and hissed at Su Ming. Then it ran to a corner of the cave and sniffed its paw again. It had the same elated expression on its face, as if it once caught something in its right paw\u2026\u2018It never had that habit before\u2026\u2019Su Ming looked at Xiao Hong\u2019s expression and became even more surprised. As a thought flickered in his mind, he decided on something.A few days passed by since then and Su Ming was once again lost in the process of quenching herbs. The powerful effects of Mountain Spirit made his heart pound in excitement and his desire to create more of them increased.It was a pity that the failure rate for creating Mountain Spirit was incredibly high. Su Ming had only managed to create two pills after he used half of the Cloud Gauze Grass he had in stock.Besides quenching herbs, Su Ming would also sit down and control the circulation of the blood around his body during the day. It allowed his body to stabilize even more in the third level of the Blood Solidification Realm. A strong presence spread through his body. Based on Su Ming\u2019s analysis, he would have been able to fight against the Berserker from Black Mountain Tribe whom he killed using Scattering Blood face-to-face at this point!During the night, Su Ming would give up on the quenching of herbs and sit in the cave to stare at the moon. He pictured the image of the blood red moon in his head quietly. However, the effects were no longer as powerful and strange as the first day.Even so, the training Su Ming did for the past few days allowed him to manifest another blood vein, turning him into a 22 blood veined Berserker.That night, Su Ming sat down with his legs crossed and stared at the moon. As he was imagining the red moon, Xiao Hong who had not gone out of the cave for a few days, got up silently. There was excitement and anticipation in its eyes. It sniffed its right paw with an exhilarated look on its face and watched Su Ming. Once it realized Su Ming was not looking, it ran out of the exit.The moment Xiao Hong disappeared from the cave, Su Ming opened his eyes. A smile appeared at the corners of his lips as he got up quietly and left the cave as well.\u2018I want to see just what it is that is captivating Xiao Hong.\u2019Su Ming was after all, still a teenager. He was still inquisitive. After he noticed Xiao Hong\u2019s actions, his curiosity was sparked.With Su Ming\u2019s new strength as a 22 blood veined Berserker, his speed and agility had arrived at an astonishing level. If he wanted it, there would not even be footsteps left on the snow.He could make it so that Xiao Hong did not notice him even as he followed it. Xiao Hong\u2019s speed was extremely quick in the night. It reached the foot of the mountain very soon.Su Ming followed it with a grin on his face.However, that grin left his face an hour later and was replaced by an odd expression.He saw Xiao Hong jumping around the forest with a destination in mind. It ran forward with absolutely no hesitation, obviously familiar with the route. It finally stopped in front of a burrow somewhere in the forest. Much of the plants around the burrow were already destroyed, making it look extremely messy.Xiao Hong paced outside the burrow quietly. There was vigilance mixed with anticipation in its demeanor. After it observed the burrow for a while, it rushed in quickly.Su Ming frowned when he saw this not far away. With all his years of experience being in the forest, he could tell with just one glance that the burrow was used by a big wild beast for hibernation.At that moment, a low roar filled with anger traveled out from the burrow and a red shadow immediately ran out from the burrow. As it ran, it would also let out piercing shrieks. There was also a hint of pride on its face. Su Ming saw a clear bundle of black fur in its right paw.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019Su Ming was uncertain of what it was but soon after, the land trembled and a creature that looked like a giant bear roared within the cave.The beast was entirely black and had long fur. Its eyes were bloodshot with anger. When Su Ming saw the creature, a weird expression settled on his face.He saw that there was only a handful of fur left on a huge portion of the angry beast\u2019s groin. It looked positively stark and clearly it was not the first time the fur over that part was plucked. It must have happened multiple times\u2026When he remembered what Xiao Hong held in its hands, he could not help but also recall the time Xiao Hong asked him to sniff its paw just a few days ago. Su Ming widened his eyes abruptly.The wild beast roared and chased after Xiao Hong furiously but it did not have Xiao Hong\u2019s speed. Before long, it whimpered as if it had given up. Then it returned to the burrow looking very downcast. After a while, huge clamoring sounds came from within the cave as though the beast was venting its anger.Su Ming\u2019s mind was blank. With a peculiar expression on his face, he chased after Xiao Hong. His speed was much faster than Xiao Hong\u2019s and not long into the chase, he saw Xiao Hong\u2019s shadow from afar.Xiao Hong stopped at a part of the forest filled with dried trees. It looked around its surroundings. It then quickly rubbed the black fur on its groin. Su Ming could see the pride on its face clearly. That look of pride seemed to announce that it was as 'strong\u201d as the bear. In all honesty, it just looked more like a pervert at that moment.Su Ming\u2019s face was emotionless. He watched as Xiao Hong walked back into the forest proudly after it was finished with its business. It screeched and then\u2026Su Ming saw a bunch of petite female monkeys whose fur were not red emerging from the forest quickly and surrounding Xiao Hong.He watched as the petite monkeys sniffed Xiao Hong\u2019s right paw. They were shocked and fearful. After that, they looked at its groin\u2026 Then Xiao Hong went into the deeper parts of the forest with the petite female monkeys feeling proud of himself.Su Ming laughed wryly and sighed. He finally understood what was going on. Xiao Hong was using the might of a bear to attract the opposite sex.Su Ming did not know whether to laugh or cry. He did not even know what to think of it. He quickly left the place and went into a trance again to forget about how he was persuaded to sniff Xiao Hong\u2019s right paw that day.He returned to the cave feeling embarrassed. Su Ming let out a long sigh. He pitied the bear that lost its fur.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018No wonder every time Xiao Hong went out, it\u2019d come back after a few days exhausted\u2026 After resting for a while, it\u2019d recover its strength and go back outside\u2026\u2019Su Ming touched his nose and forced himself to ignore the matter. Once again, he immersed himself in projecting the image of the red moon and sank into the mysterious feeling of having the red tint from the moon seeping into his blood.A few days passed by. One night, Su Ming was looking at the moon as he sat down cross-legged as usual. As he looked at the bright surface of the moon, the faint outline of the blood red moon gradually appeared in Su Ming\u2019s vision. It shone brilliantly. Suddenly, the blood red moon in his left vision seemed to burn. Su Ming trembled.A string of words crossed his mind.\u2018\u201dAs the fire in mine blood burns, the nine is the utmost of all, and the one is the law.

Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire!\u201d Su Ming mumbled instinctively. The string of words kept repeating themselves in his head and it became louder each time they were repeated. It was like the roar of thunder by the end as they rumbled repeatedly in his head. The faint shadow of the blood red moon became even clearer in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. It gave off a strange and enchanting glow as if it was burning. Su Ming felt a stab of pain in his eyes.The pain was not too obvious in the beginning. However as time passed and the moon shone in the sky, the pain intensified until Su Ming started trembling. It seemed as though he could no longer bear it.He wanted to close his eyes and stop looking at the moon. The source of his pain was not the fire but the moonlight. At the same time, he had a strong feeling that somehow it all happened because it was the right time for him to learn this strange Art.If he closed his eyes, he would be giving up on learning the Art. He also had a feeling that if he gave up then, he would lose the right to learn it ever again.\u2018\u201dAs the fire in mine blood burns\u2026\u201d But how do I make it burn?!\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. The veins in his eyes surrounded the shadow of the blood red moon which had substituted his pupils. It made Su Ming look especially ghastly at that moment.The burning image of the blood red moon also burned away all the moisture in his eyes. His eyes looked dried up and bloodshot at the same time. It was like his eyes were about to wither away at any moment.Su Ming lifted his eyes and roared. His face was twisted as he controlled the circulation of blood in his veins. Yet, no matter how hard he pushed the blood towards his eyes, there were no signs of alleviation from the dryness in his eyes. If anything, it only made the withering sensation in his eyes even worse.Gradually, the moon began to fade from Su Ming\u2019s sight.If there was anyone beside Su Ming then, they would have clearly seen that Su Ming\u2019s eyes were still burning with red fire. The fire looked like blood and it was burning rapidly.\u2018How am I supposed to make my blood burn?! Just how am I supposed to make my blood burn?!\u2019Su Ming struggled. He could not understand the underlying meaning of the strange Berserker Art. As most of his field of vision faded away, he slowly closed his eyes. He knew that if he did not close his eyes by then, it was highly possible that he would no longer see light.Yet, at the very moment before his eyes closed completely, a strange picture appeared in Su Ming\u2019s head like a flash of lightning. It was something he saw before he saved Bai Ling. It was the pain and sadness on the Wings of the Moon\u2019s faces residing on the red branch in the fire cave.The Wings of the Moon repeatedly bit through their claws and wiped their eyes with them\u2026Su Ming was startled. He understood something. That very moment before he completely closed his eyes, he opened them once again and brought his right hand to his mouth. He bit down resolutely.Immediately, blood flowed down from his fingertips. The moment his blood stained his entire finger, he raised his hand and smeared his eyes with the blood on his finger!The moment Su Ming smeared his eyes with blood, something like a bellow came out from between his eyebrows. His eyes immediately felt refreshed. Black Flame Mountain also seemed to quake lightly but strangely, not a single fleck of snow moved. It was as if the physical body of the mountain did not shake instead, it was the spirit of the mountain which shook.At the same time, whiffs of air which could not be seen flowed out from within Black Flame Mountain suddenly. They gathered hastily around Su Ming.Su Ming did not know what it was but he could feel the whiffs of air coming towards him. They were fusing into his eyes. It was as if his eyes had turned into a vortex and it was pulling in the air.The whiffs of air which entered his eyes were like rain that could extinguish the fire. As they flowed into his eyes, the dull look in Su Ming\u2019s eyes disappeared rapidly. His eyes could see clearly once again. However, amid the clarity in his eyes, there was a hint of a blood red glint. The world Su Ming saw turned a bloody red at that moment!The burning and dry sensation in his eyes went away abruptly and were replaced with a refreshing feeling. The pain in his body also disappeared like the wind at the same time!As the whiffs of strange air gushed into Su Ming\u2019s eyes, they spread to his entire body before assimilating into his blood. Then along with the blood, they circulated around his entire body.The 22 blood veins were shining brightly in a scarlet light on Su Ming\u2019s body. When the light enveloped his entire body, the 23rd blood vein manifested out of nowhere!The moment the 23rd blood vein appeared, the blood red tint in Su Ming\u2019s eyes flashed and the 24th blood vein manifested as well!After a long time, the sky began to brighten and the moon started to fade. Soon, it was going to be replaced by the sun. Su Ming stood up quickly and ran towards the exit. In the blink of an eye, he arrived outside. The winds in the mountain whined and led his long hair in a dance. The 24 blood veins shone fiercely on his body. Su Ming looked incredibly unearthly.He stood there and looked at the moon which was about to fade away. Suddenly, he breathed deeply in the direction of the moon.At that point, Su Ming saw the moon sway. A hint of red moonlight fell from the moon straight into Su Ming\u2019s eyes and it disappeared soon after!Su Ming shivered. On his neck, the 25th blood vein appeared!He had arrived at the fourth level of the Blood Solidification Realm!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithin most small tribes, a lot of value was attached to Berserkers in the fourth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. This meant that tribe members who had reached the fourth level could join the hunting team. It also meant that such a tribe member could become one of the main forces in the tribe should there be a battle!At the same time, the fourth level also signaled that the Berserker had arrived at the peak of the early stages of the Blood Solidification Realm. If they reached the fifth level, they would then become Berserkers in the middle stage of the Blood Solidification Realm! More importantly, once he reached the middle stage of Blood Solidification, there was hope for Su Ming to learn and use a new Berserker Art!Su Ming felt a powerful feeling of strength he had never felt before in his body. His whole demeanor was calm. He looked at the fading moon and the brightening sky as the blood in his veins circulated around his body. The whiffs of cold air seemed to rush towards his eyes. At the same time, huge amounts of air which held the same properties rushed towards him from the mountains.He even had a strange feeling that he could control the light from the moon!Under the guidance of this strange sensation, Su Ming lifted his hands slowly and waved lightly the very moment the moon was about to disappear.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No one else could see the silver light. Only Su Ming could.As the silver light fell from the sky following Su Ming\u2019s hand motion, he saw the sky before him twisting. Then he saw the light he coaxed out from the moon blink and a roar rang through the sky. A big portion of the stone walls in front of Su Ming cracked and split into a large amount of debris that scattered on the ground. Some of the debris even fell into the stream on the mountain and they echoed for a long time.Su Ming widened his eyes and took a deep breath. He looked at his right hand with a dumbfounded expression. It took him a long time before he snapped out of his daze and looked at the sky. The moon had already vanished and the sun had risen. The land welcomed its first rays of sunlight for the day.\u201cIs\u2026 this the Fire Berserker Art\u2026? But this Art is related to the moon. It has nothing to do with fire. Why is it so?\u201d Su Ming mumbled under his breath. His heart was pounding rapidly against his chest. When he guided the might of the moonlight with his right hand earlier, there was a strangeness to it that he did not understand. Nonetheless, the viciousness of the Art made Su Ming\u2019s heart pound.He clenched his right fist and swung it against a big rock lying by his side as he activated his Qi. The 25 blood veins manifested on his body, crisscrossing on his skin. As his fist touched the stone, a muffled boom rang in the air. Several cracks appeared on the stone. At the same time, a strong rebound traveled up along Su Ming\u2019s right arm into his body but, it was blocked by his Qi.Su Ming took a step back. He looked at the multiple cracks which appeared on the big stone and his eyes shone with excitement.\u2018I can only make the stone crack even with my strength as a fourth level Berserker in the Blood Solidification Realm\u2026 If I cast Spirit Devourer and I find a suitable animal spirit, perhaps I can make the stone shatter\u2026 But this is already my full strength. If I compare this with that small ray of moonlight, then there\u2019s a huge difference between my strength and that moonlight.\u2018If one small ray of moonlight already had such powerful effects, then if I had more\u2026\u2019Su Ming took a deep breath and laughed happily. He could feel his own body change and the power stored within his body. He began to look forward\u2026 for night to arrive.\u2018It\u2019s a pity I can only use the power of the moonlight at night.\u2019Su Ming went back into the cave.Su Ming had never looked forward for night to come so strongly before. He would lift his head and look out the holes to check the sky occasionally. He felt as if the day was passing by too slowly. Gradually, the day darkened once again and moonlight lit up the land. Su Ming quelled the excitement in his heart and looked at the moon. He took a deep breath as his eyes glinted.From the inheritance he obtained from the God of Berserkers, Su Ming clearly knew that once he reached the fifth or even higher level of the Blood Solidification Realm, he would be able to cast two extremely powerful Berserker Arts. They had been passed down Dark Mountain Tribe when it was still a middle sized tribe hundreds of years ago!Dark Blood Dust and Execution of the Three Evils!Dark Blood Dust gathers a drop of Berserker Blood within the body and allows the caster to obtain an astonishing burst of strength for a short period of time. As for Execution of the Three Evils, every time Su Ming thought about it, his heart pounded in excitement.Dark Blood Dust could only be cast by Berserkers who had manifested more than 50 blood veins. It was even harder for Execution of the Three Evils. The caster needed to manifest 200 blood veins to be able to cast the very first stage of the Art. They could only then cast the first strike!To arrive at the fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm, he needed 53 blood veins. If he wanted to become a Berserker at the sixth level, he needed 109 blood veins! As for the seventh level, he needed 243 blood veins!The peak of the middle stage of the Blood Solidification Realm was the eighth level where he would require 399 blood veins!Every level above the ninth level until the 11th level was considered the later stage of the Blood Solidification Realm. At the 11th level, the number of blood veins required was a normal Berserker\u2019s limit. He or she needed to manifest all 781 blood veins. If more blood veins were manifested, not only would the Berserker become stronger, the chances of arriving at the Awakening Realm would also be higher!Su Ming\u2019s eyes shone. He looked at the moon in the sky and the anticipation within his eyes grew. As he imagined the moon turning red in his head, the red moon gradually appeared in his eyes. He also felt the burning sensation in his eyes again.This time, Su Ming did not hesitate and bit through the skin on his finger and smeared his blood over his eyes. His whole body seemed to cry out and the strange sight which unfolded within Black Flame Mountain the day before occurred once more.\u2018I want to become stronger!\u2019The 25 blood veins manifested on Su Ming\u2019s body and shone in a blood red glow as they absorbed the air from the mountain. Air was rushing towards him from all around. At the same time, as image of the blood red moon shone in his eyes, Su Ming lifted his right hand and smeared the blood on his fingers across his eyes once again!\u2018\u201dThe desire to obtain Berserk spreads to all corners of the earth. Let fire burn in mine blood, let mine thoughts burn the skies, let fire burn heaven into ashes\u2026 If \u2018t be true the moon of fire appears from the clouds on the endless earth\u2026 I wilt sink into deep bethought as the fire in mine blood burns, the nine is the utmost of all, and the one is the law. Light up the Berserker Fires and worship the nine, did let us all becometh the authorities of Fire!\u201d\u2018\u201dThe nine is the utmost of all! The nine is the utmost of all!\u201d The meaning of this must be that I have to let my blood burn 9 times!\u2019Once Su Ming smeared his blood across his eyes again, his body trembled furiously. Tremors shook the entire Black Flame Mountain but still, no one noticed the tremors this time as well.A stronger wave of the mountain\u2019s aura came rushing into Su Ming\u2019s body in the form of air. It made him feel as if he was about to explode. The light from the 25 blood veins became even brighter on his skin and started moving as if they were alive.At that moment, the 26th blood vein manifested on Su Ming\u2019s body but it did not stop there. The 27th, 28th, 29th\u2026 right up to the 33rd blood vein manifested at the same time on his body!Su Ming\u2019s breathing quickened as his heartbeat raced against his chest. He was drunk on power. It seemed like he refused to wake up but his mind was still clear. As the blood red moon in his eyes shone once again, he lifted his right hand slowly and pierced the skin of his third finger.The fresh blood gathering on his finger had some sort of mysterious power. Su Ming looked at the fresh blood and slowly placed it on his eyes. He was making his blood burn for the third time!He had a strong feeling that if he could make his blood burn the third time, his power would increase exponentially! That thought made his body shiver as he stared at his finger. Su Ming gritted his teeth and pressed his finger against his right eye and wiped it gently. The moment some of the blood smeared over his right eye, the entire Dark Mountain trembled!Not only did Black Flame Mountain tremble, the other four summits also shook as if their souls were shuddering. Many birds and beasts looked at the sky in fear and did not dare to move. However, when anyone looked at the mountains, they appeared normal. There were no obvious signs of change.Neither Dark Dragon Tribe nor Dark Mountain Tribe noticed it. Only Bi Tu, from Black Mountain Tribe and who had absorbed the blood of the Wings of the Moon to break through the Awakening Realm noticed. His heart trembled. There was a shred of horror in his eyes as he went out of his house and looked into the sky.However, the sensation was fleeting and it disappeared like the wind. No matter how hard he tried to find it, he could not pinpoint the source of his fear.Aside from Bi Tu, all the Wings of the Moon residing within the deeper parts of the five mountains had excited looks on their faces when Su Ming attempted to burn his blood the third time. They were in a frenzy, trying to break through the strange tree which held them. It was as though they were searching for their king!Nonetheless, they were held back by an unknown force and could not go out.At the same time, the strange red tree within Dark Mountain trembled. It was unknown whether it was trembling in agitation or fear.Meanwhile in the cave, Su Ming\u2019s eyes did not stop trembling as his right eye was smeared with fresh blood. The strong aura from the entirety of Dark Mountain charged into his body madly. It caused the blood veins on his body to manifest at a speed that terrified even Su Ming.34, 35, 36\u2026 42, 44\u2026 and they did not stop manifesting right up until the 47th blood vein!Su Ming could not continue any longer. The feeling like he was about to explode had become even more apparent. He could even vaguely hear the howls of the Wings of the Moon calling out from within Dark Mountain.He raised his right hand. His breathing was rapid as it came out in harsh pants. His entire body was drenched in sweat. At the same time, he could not feel the movement of Dark Mountain\u2019s soul anymore. The strong aura that rushed towards him also disappeared. The roars which rang faintly in his ears also disappeared and everything returned to normal.However, Su Ming knew that everything that had happened earlier was not normal at all!\u2018What a strong Berserker Art! I can feel that if I complete the third cycle of the burning of blood, the number of my blood veins manifesting will increase by several fold! This is only the third time. If I go through all nine times\u2026\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming took a shaky breath. He began to feel a bit apprehensive about continuing with this method of training.\u2018It\u2019s not only nine times of that. From what I understand, once I have burned my blood nine times, I can then worship the moon of fire\u2026 once I worship it nine times, I can then obtain the power to control all fire!\u2019At that moment, Su Ming felt as if his body had become unbelievably powerful. After some time, he lifted his head and his eyes were bright with resolution.\u2018If I train with this Art using the pills\u2026 I will be able to reach the Awakening Realm!\u2019Su Ming clenched his fists.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Xiao Hong returned to the cave exhausted after a few days as Su Ming was meditating. Its red fur had darkened several shades as well, illustrating just how tired it was.However, tired as it may be, there were expressions of longing and pride on its face. It kept sniffing its right paw and grinned as if it was giggling foolishly.When Xiao Hong came back, Su Ming opened his eyes slightly. When he saw Xiao Hong, he remembered what he witnessed the day he followed Xiao Hong into the forest. An awkward expression settled on his face.Xiao Hong noticed Su Ming\u2019s gaze and turned around to look at him. It immediately ran towards him and raised its right paw proudly. It extended its right paw to Su Ming, urging Su Ming to sniff it again. It felt that it had to share everything that was good with everyone.Su Ming did not know whether to laugh or cry. He no longer paid any attention to Xiao Hong and once again immersed himself in his training.The month soon passed by. The date Su Ming was to go with the elder to Wind Stream Tribe loomed near.During this period of time, Su Ming used up all of the Cloud Gauze Grass in his possession but only managed to create one Mountain Spirit. The high failure rate made Su Ming\u2019s spirits incredibly low.At the very least, his training had been pretty successful. He had completely settled into the fourth level of the Blood Solidification Realm and managed to manifest two more blood veins, bringing the total blood veins he manifested up to 49 blood veins. He had also gradually adapted to the strangeness of the Fire Berserker Art.However, the further down the path of the Blood Solidification Realm, the harder it was to solidify more blood veins. Lately, no matter how hard Su Ming trained, he could no longer solidify any more of his blood. He understood that this was related to the incompletion of the third burning of his blood.Moreover when the moon was out at night, Su Ming acted according to his senses and tried to control the moonlight multiple times. However, the results were not obvious. It seemed like he could only control no more than a small ray of moonlight.Even though it was only a small ray of moonlight, in Su Ming\u2019s hands, it was incredibly sharp, even more so than his horn. Most importantly, Xiao Hong could not see the ray of moonlight. From that observation alone, Su Ming believed that he was the only one who could see the moonlight, no one else.It was daylight. Su Ming stood up and looked around the fire cave. After a moment of silence he pushed his Barren Cauldron aside. He did not know how long he would stay at Wind Stream Tribe. He needed to make preparations.On the walls of the fire cave were numerous fine ravines decorating the walls densely. Those ravines were created during the days Su Ming learned how to control the moonlight.Once he packed up, Su Ming left the cave. Xiao Hong had already woken up. When it saw that Su Ming was about to leave, it followed him quickly. When they arrived outside the cave, it climbed onto Su Ming\u2019s shoulders, too lazy to descend the mountain on its own.\u2018It\u2019s a pity Mountain Spirit is too hard to make\u2026 There were eight holes underneath the picture of Mountain Spirit on the second door so it\u2019s obvious I have to offer eight of them\u2026 I wonder how long it\u2019ll take for me to offer up 8 Mountain Spirits without forsaking my own training\u2026\u2018Besides, I also need to offer the pills called Fire of the South for the second door to open\u2026 But I\u2019ve never seen the herbs required for the pills before. Thank the heavens for the bamboo slip the elder gave me. At least there are some descriptions of herbs there.\u2019Su Ming stood outside the cave and looked at the sun rising from the horizon He breathed in the refreshing cold air around him.\u2018I can only open the second door after I have gathered enough Mountain Spirit and Fire of the South\u2026 At the very least there is no need for me to create The Welcoming of Deities. Still, it just shows how rare The Welcoming of Deities is!\u2019As Su Ming was deep in his thoughts, Xiao Hong who was sprawled across his shoulders, grabbed his hair and hissed impatiently.Su Ming patted the little monkey\u2019s head and jumped down the mountain peak. The wind blew against him. It made his shirt and hair flutter. It also made Xiao Hong clutch onto Su Ming\u2019s hair tightly as it screamed in terror.Su Ming laughed. He grabbed onto a stone within his right hand\u2019s reach as he fell. Once he regained his momentum, he jumped down again. With his current abilities, Su Ming arrived at the foot of Black Flame Mountain before long.Snow still covered the forests. They were really soft under his feet as well. He sank when he stepped on them. Su Ming then ran into the distance. He originally intended to return to the tribe but when he arrived at a crossroads, his footsteps faltered and he hesitated for a moment.Xiao Hong was sitting on Su Ming\u2019s shoulders. It seemed to be in a comfortable position. Occasionally, it would sniff its right paw with an exhilarated expression. It was slightly surprised when it saw Su Ming stop.The right path led back to his own tribe whereas the left path\u2026 Su Ming gazed at the path. It led to Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201cI\u2019ll just go and take a look\u2026 Xiao Hong, have you ever seen Bai Ling? Oh, that\u2019s right, you\u2019ve never seen her. Do you want to see her?\u201d Su Ming asked softly.Xiao Hong widened its eyes. It scratched the fur on its face and did not make a sound.\u201cAlright. Since you want to see her, I\u2019ll let you look at her from afar,\u201d Su Ming spoke as if he suddenly had a perfectly logical reason to go to Dark Dragon Tribe. He smiled and patted Xiao Hong\u2019s head. When Xiao Hong looked at him with an unamused expression, Su Ming ran down the left lane quickly.Su Ming arrived at the spot where he parted with Bai Ling when dusk arrived. The sun had turned red as it began to set. He squatted there and looked at the silhouette of Dark Dragon Tribe. He saw the other members of Dark Dragon Tribe moving in there but he did not see Bai Ling.After a long time, Su Ming sank into his thoughts. He did not know what he was thinking. He only thought that Bai Ling was pretty. She was the prettiest girl he had ever seen in his life and he wanted to look at her a few more times.After a moment of hesitation, he sat down quietly and chose not to take any action. Instead, he looked at the sky. When the sun was about to set and the sky about to darken completely, he stood up and walked forward briskly. He still kept a hint of awareness to his surroundings as he approached Dark Dragon Tribe. Nonetheless, he did not dare go too near the tribe. It was after all, not Dark Mountain Tribe. If he was discovered, there was a possibility he would be in danger.While the relationship between Dark Mountain Tribe and Dark Dragon Tribe was not as tense as Dark Mountain Tribe and Black Mountain Tribe, it did not mean that they were at peace with each other. If they met in the wild, they still regarded each other with hostility. It would have been even more so if they had discovered Su Ming, who had been lingering outside Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201cAh\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have done this.\u201d Su Ming mumbled as he continued walking forward. When he was about 10,000 feet away from Dark Dragon Tribe, he stopped walking. Su Ming grew up in the tribe and had been regularly going out into the wild to collect herbs. On occasion, he even ran into members from Black Mountain Tribe. Caution and vigilance was practically second nature to him.He had seen too much violence in his life. Even if most of the violence happened to beasts which the hunting team brought back, living in such conditions for years had already influenced him unconsciously as a child. Besides, he had already killed someone!Not even Lei Chen had stained his hands with human blood before.As such, even if Su Ming wanted to see Bai Ling for some unknown reason, his instincts that were buried deep within told him to move only during the night. As an act of caution, Su Ming also chose to stop 10,000 feet away from the tribe.He squatted down and took a look at Dark Dragon Tribe. Then, he turned around resolutely without hesitation and left the area around Dark Dragon Tribe quickly.Yet just as he took a few steps forward, Su Ming felt goosebumps. A sense of danger far stronger than his meeting with the two Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe came crashing towards him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs he leaped forward, he twisted his body abruptly and covered his head with both hands. His entire body curled into a ball as he hugged Xiao Hong tightly in his bosom, stopping in midair for a brief moment as if he was frozen.That moment, a sharp whistling sound sliced through the air. A long gigantic spear about 30 feet flew towards Su Ming like lightning from within the giant wooden fence surrounding Dark Dragon Tribe. It rushed past Su Ming\u2019s body and stuck itself into the ground, creating a loud noise. The ground shook and snow flew into the air.It also stirred up a wave of air which spread across a wide area around the spear. Su Ming was lucky he was cautious enough to avoid it beforehand. He landed on the ground as he moved along the air\u2019s wave current and ran forward at full speed immediately.\u201cLeaving?\u201d A cold voice traveled from afar. A man with long hair wearing a shirt made of sackcloth chased after him with a fierce look in his eyes.As Su Ming ran forward, he turned back and looked at him with a cold glare in his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was strongly built. So much so that he could compete with Lei Chen. In his hands, he held a long spear. The spear was only about five feet long but its black body gave it a shocking and chilling aura. There was also a golden dazzle on the tip of the spear.However, the spear was essentially not made of stone. It was made out of a material Su Ming had never seen before. He looked back from afar and when his eyes landed on the spear, his heart froze in fear.It was a very, very familiar feeling.Yet, he did not know where that familiarity came from. Nonetheless, it made him feel that danger was looming over his head. Su Ming ignored everything else. Only a basic instinctual need for him to remain calm was left.\u2018That person is not wearing hides but is wearing sackcloth instead. This sort of clothes\u2026 This person must have a pretty high status in Dark Dragon Tribe!\u2018I don\u2019t regret going near Dark Dragon Tribe!\u2019A glint appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes as he came to an answer in his heart.\u201cI did not go within 10,000 feet of the tribe. According to the rules among the tribes, if a person or a pair stands 10,000 feet outside the area of the tribe, he or she bears no ill will! I bear you no ill will. It\u2019s just that one of my friends is within your tribe and I wanted to see her.\u201d Su Ming ran at the full speed of a fourth level Berserker of the Blood Solidification Realm. His body was bent so low he was almost touching the surface of the snow in order to increase his speed. No tracks were left on the snow. As he ran, he shouted back towards the man pursuing him.\u201cOh? If that\u2019s the case, if you\u2019re truly not an enemy, then don\u2019t run anymore. Come with me back to the tribe and we\u2019ll have the Elder verify your identity.\u201d A cold glare flitted through the young man\u2019s eyes. He spoke slowly but his speed did not decrease. He increased his speed instead and kept his eyes trained on Su Ming as if he was waiting for Su Ming to hesitate.\u201cAs an outsider, how can I just walk into your tribe?\u201d There were no signs of faltering on Su Ming side as he laughed and spoke to the man.\u201cTrue. Then what is the name of the person you know?\u201d The young man spoke slowly once again as he continued giving chase. His demeanor did not change but he did narrow his eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t know her name but I do know that she wears white and she\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d As Su Ming spoke and continued fleeing, he turned back to look at his pursuer.He saw a hint of murderous intent in the man\u2019s eyes when he heard Su Ming\u2019s words. He understood then. Su Ming had been wondering why the man would attack him with such ferocity even when he had not gone within 10,000 feet of the tribe. He was still not considered a threat with his current level of power. By right, even if he had drawn the attention of Dark Dragon Tribe upon himself, he should not have instigated such an attack.There had to be a reason behind it. The young man with an obviously high status within the tribe was pursuing him alone and so, an answer formed within Su Ming\u2019s mind.\u201cI knew it, it\u2019s him!\u201d The young man answered with a snort. He took a big step forward and raised his right hand as he continued pursuing Su Ming. A big amount of black mist immediately scattered around him and gathered around the spear on the man\u2019s back. A sharp cry echoed through the air after the black mist surrounded the spear a few times. Then, as if the spear was guided by the black mist, it floated above the man\u2019s head.Su Ming narrowed his eyes. It was a Berserker Art!The presence of Qi coming out from the man also proved just how powerful he was. He was slightly more powerful than Su Ming. Judging by the looks of it, he should have been at the fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm but had only reached it not too long ago. He should have just had a few more blood veins than Su Ming. Nonetheless, since he had a Berserker Vessel, everything was different.\u201cYou can see her after you die.\u201d There was more than 7,000 feet between them. Since the two of them had been running at full speed, they were already some distance away from Dark Dragon Tribe. Even so, the man was still the only one giving chase.As the black mist surrounded the long spear, the sense of danger became even stronger. As the man spoke, his killing intent became even more obvious in his eyes. He pointed at Su Ming with his right hand in one swift motion and immediately, the black spear rushed towards Su Ming with a piercing trill.As it traveled forward, the golden glow on the tip of the long spear flashed as though it could tear through a void. It came towards Su Ming at an unimaginable speed and within the blink of an eye, it was already within 3,000 feet away from Su Ming.\u2018Berserker Vessel!\u2019Su Ming narrowed his eyes. He recognized the object! All 49 blood veins within Su Ming immediately appeared. The circulation of blood within his body increased in an instant, causing the Qi within Su Ming\u2019s body to erupt. The act pushed Su Ming\u2019s speed and agility to the peak and at the very moment the long spear was about to touch him, Su Ming ducked. The wind whistled wildly above his head as the long spear missed the top of his head by about seven inches. It fell on the ground with a loud thud.The force of the strike was by no means weaker than the one from Dark Dragon Tribe just moments ago.A normal Berserker at the fourth level of the Blood Solidification Realm would have found it hard to avoid the attack but Su Ming specialized in speed and agility. As soon as he avoided the attack, he did not even spare the long spear on the ground a glance. Instead, a cold glare appeared in his eyes as he ran into the distance.Su Ming did not even think about snatching the long spear from the ground. It was written within the beast skin scrolls that only Berserkers at the Awakening Realm could make Berserker Vessels acknowledge them as their masters. Those below the Awakening Realm would not have been able to do it.Yet, it was odd that the man threw out the vessel so easily. It could have been taken away by someone else with ease. There had to be something wrong!It was nearly dark.Before long, the young man reached the location where the long spear was. An icy glare appeared in his eyes as he snorted. There was a light crease between his brows.As the son of the tribe leader in Dark Dragon Tribe, Si Kong was probably not the strongest among the younger generation but he was definitely no common Berserker. He had the strength of a fifth level Berserker at the Blood Solidification Realm and had with him a Berserker Vessel. Killing a person who was only at the fourth level of the Blood Solidification Realm was easy.Yet the person avoided the attack. The act alone made Si Kong wary and alerted him to the cautiousness of the other person.\u2018It\u2019s a pity. If he had picked up my Berserker Vessel, he would have died immediately.\u2019Si Kong hesitated for a moment but once he thought of something, he picked up the long spear carefully and gave chase once more.Su Ming ran like the wind in the forest. His speed kept increasing as he ran but Si Kong kept up with him. The long spear would occasionally whisk past him and prevented Su Ming from widening the distance between them. There was still a few hundred feet between them as Su Ming ran into the forest.However if Su Ming truly wanted to escape, it would not have been hard with his speed and knowledge of the forest. However, he did not have the desire to widen the distance between them. This was the second time he saw a Berserker Vessel. The fact that he had experienced its might, his desire to obtain the Vessel increased. He wanted the Vessel!As he ran, he occasionally looked at the sky. When he saw that the sky had gradually darkened and the moon had appeared, a bright glint twinkled in his eyes.\u2018Berserker Vessels are all rare items. Hence, he must have another trick up his sleeve for him to throw it out so easily. Now, he\u2019s not closing the distance between us. If I were him, I would think about increasing the power of the Berserker Vessel\u2026 But looking at how cautious he is, there must be a price for him to pay if he made that move. But I wonder, just how strong is the Vessel\u2019s true might?\u2019Su Ming made a decision.As Si Kong continued pursuing Su Ming, he began to grow impatient. He did not expect his opponent to be so agile. It was getting dark and he was getting too far away from the tribe. He had made sure not a lot of people knew of his departure from the tribe. If he went back to the tribe late, it would be hard for him to explain himself. He gritted his teeth and grabbed at the air with his right hand. Then for the first time, the long spear surrounded by black mist appeared in his hands.At that moment, Su Ming suddenly spoke a few hundred feet ahead.\u201cWith how fiercely you\u2019re chasing me, I can see that you truly want to kill me! There is no hate between us. Even if you want to kill me, at least give me a reason.\u201d\u201cWhy should I bother with idle chatter? You came within the area of my tribe and for that, anyone from my tribe could kill you! Even if we did kill you and Dark Mountain Tribe wanted to seek revenge for you, it\u2019s still your own fault!\u201d Si Kong laughed coldly. He held onto the long spear tightly as he continued pursuing Su Ming. Cold waves traveled from the long spear into his arm.Si Kong\u2019s gaze darkened. He snorted and raised his right arm along with the spear. Immediately, countless voices roared from within the forest. A great amount of black mist flowed out of the spear and gathered around it, turning the spear into an impressive black dragon!The dragon had numerous claws and its whiskers moved in the air. It looked incredibly ferocious!\u201cNo matter who you are, you must die today!\u201d Si Kong grinned fiercely. His face was pale. Clearly, calling out the might of the spear had brought upon a great toll to his body. Just as he was about to throw the spear towards Su Ming, Su Ming opened his mouth and spoke.\u201cIt\u2019s because I saved Bai Ling, right?\u201d Su Ming suddenly said.When Si Kong heard the name, he was momentarily stunned. The moment his actions faltered, Su Ming stopped running abruptly and turned around to look at him. He raised his right hand as well and swung it in his direction.A sense of danger he had never felt before arose in Si Kong\u2019s heart. He narrowed his eyes as his demeanor changed completely. Just as he was about to throw the spear in his hand, he felt his body quivering. It was as if a huge gust of wind blew against him and also a strong blast of light pierced into his eyes. He saw the shadow of the blood red moon within Su Ming\u2019s eyes.The shadow of the blood red moon became the only thing he saw. He felt a sudden pain in his entire body and coughed out a mouthful of blood. His eyes expressed confusion, bewilderment and bafflement as he fell onto the snow face down.As he fell, the spear that he did not manage to throw gradually turned back into a common object as the black mist scattered. It fell to the side.There was blood coming out from his entire body as it seeped into the snow. There was a faint silvery thread around his body which sank deep into his flesh. It felt like with just a slight tug, his entire body would have been torn apart.He did not die. There was still breath within him. He just became unconscious due to the sudden blast of pain.Su Ming\u2019s heart pounded against his chest. He looked at the spear with lingering fear. When the true might of the spear had been brought out by the before him, Su Ming had felt death.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhen you are fighting against someone, do not let your focus waver. Do not hesitate. If it is possible to kill your enemy with one strike within the shortest amount of time, do not wait till the last moment to do so.\u201d Su Ming mumbled as he remembered the words in his head.\u2018He had a Berserker Vessel. It was by pure luck that I won this battle!\u2019Su Ming squatted down and looked at the unconscious Si Kong. After hesitating briefly, Su Ming chose to bandage his wounds. He did not want Si Kong to die or cause trouble to Dark Mountain Tribe. He deduced that Si Kong would wake up soon.Soon, a crazed look settled in his eyes as he looked at the long black spear lying by his side. He looked at it carefully and gradually found some clues regarding the spear. On many parts of the spear were tiny thorns that he would have missed if he had not observed the spear carefully!After looking at it for a long time, Su Ming found and held onto the only small part of the spear that was without thorns carefully. He left the area quickly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He stood beside the unconscious Si Kong and paced around him for a while. He lifted his head and looked at the sky as well as the moon. The moonlight looked gentle and soft as it shone on the land.\u2018It\u2019s not appropriate for me to take such a precious Berserker Vessel away just like that. I don\u2019t have a proper explanation and it can be taken back by Dark Dragon Tribe anytime. Besides, I might even be accused of snatching away treasure\u2026 Should I kill him or not?\u2019Su Ming fell into silence for a moment. He looked at Si Kong and arrived at a decision.He brought out a few herbs from his bosom and crushed it until they became liquid. Then he rubbed the liquid on Si Kong\u2019s lips. After that, he squatted down beside Si Kong and patted Si Kong\u2019s head rhythmically with his left hand. It seemed like he wanted to wake him up by slapping him.Soon after, Si Kong\u2019s entire body twitched and he opened his eyes abruptly. When he did so, his eyes were still blurry. Even so, he saw Su Ming\u2019s smiling face within his faded field of vision.Si Kong was momentarily stunned. Then he widened his eyes. There was still bewilderment and bafflement lingering in his eyes. His mind was blank. He felt like he saw something before he fainted, but at the same time, it could have all just been in his mind. In his fuzzy state, he was beginning to feel confused.Just as he was about to move, Su Ming swung the black spear in his right hand and pointed the tip of the spear three inches away from Si Kong\u2019s throat. If Su Ming pushed forward just a little, Si Kong\u2019s throat would have been pierced and he would have died on the spot.\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201dIn Si Kong\u2019s eyes, the golden glow on the tip of the spear looked like a ray of light that was about to take his life. It made him tremble slightly. He stared at Su Ming with fear and shock in his eyes.\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you want to do?! I am the son of Dark Dragon Tribe\u2019s tribe leader! If you kill me, the entire Dark Dragon Tribe will not let you escape! I know that you\u2019re from Dark Mountain Tribe. If you kill me, Dark Mountain Tribe won\u2019t protect you either!\u201d He still could not fathom how he had lost. He just remembered that the person before him swung his hand and then he fainted in great pain. The more he failed to make sense of it, the more mysterious the smiling teenager before him became. That feeling turned into apprehension and with the spear pointing at his throat, he retreated instinctively in fear.However just as he was about to move backwards, he tasted something bitter on his tongue. He licked his lips on reflex and the bitter taste grew stronger. It made his face turn completely pale. He had a bad hunch about it and there was fear on his face. He raised his hands and wiped it across his mouth. There was brown liquid on his hand.\u201cYou! What did you feed me?!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just some normal herbs. They\u2019re just a bit poisonous,\u201d Su Ming said jokingly. His smile was enigmatic.Si Kong\u2019s eyes were filled with despair when he heard those words. His entire body trembled as he felt the bitter taste grow stronger in his mouth. He even felt his tongue tingling.\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t dare kill me!\u201d Si Kong lifted his head and glared at Su Ming.\u201cYou can believe what you want. If you don\u2019t believe me, there\u2019s nothing else I can do to convince you. But I do have the antidote. So, you\u2019re the son of the tribe leader from Dark Dragon Tribe? What\u2019s your name?\u201d Su Ming was feeling a bit guilty. Nonetheless, he was the type of person who schooled his face to make sure no one could see through him, the guiltier he felt. He smiled as he spoke to Si Kong.\u201cYou\u2026 I \u2026 My name is Si Kong. You can\u2019t kill me or else it\u2019ll only bring trouble to your tribe, you\u2026\u201d Si Kong\u2019s eyes were fierce but he was feeling exceptionally nervous. Not only did he feel his tongue tingling, even his chest was throbbing in pain. This added to the fact that he could not gauge anything from Su Ming\u2019s expression. Si Kong felt even more fearful.\u201cHey Si Kong, why don\u2019t we talk about something?\u201d Su Ming raised his head and looked at the moon as he spoke slowly.Si Kong\u2019s face was pale. He could no longer hide the growing fear in his eyes. He immediately nodded his head.\u201cI like this stupid spear of yours. How about you sell it to me? I\u2019ll buy it for 5,000 stone coins.\u201d Su Ming blinked expectantly as he looked at Si Kong.Si Kong faltered for a moment as he looked at the spear in Su Ming\u2019s right hand and the tip pointing against his throat. How could he not have agreed to it? The bitter taste in his mouth and his pursuit for Su Ming\u2019s life also forced him to think that Su Ming had definitely fed him some sort of poisonous herb.He wanted to bet that the person before his eyes did not dare to kill him. After all, he was of high status. If he died, both tribes would definitely go to war.He was even willing to bet that even if the person before him snatched away the long spear, he still had countless ways to obtain that piece of treasure back with his dad\u2019s help.However, the bitterness in his mouth prevented him from taking the risk. He was afraid. What if\u2026 what if\u2026It was especially so since his head was also hurting because Su Ming had been hitting him pretty harshly earlier. Si Kong only hesitated for a brief moment before nodding his head rapidly.Su Ming smiled happily. He tore a big piece of fabric from Si Kong\u2019s shirt. His action made Si Kong\u2019s heart thump loudly against his chest. More blood drained from his already pale face.\u201cSince this is a trade, we need proof of our deal. Let\u2019s write this down. \u2018I, Si Kong lack money. Hence, I am selling this spear for 5,000 stone coins\u2026\u2019\u201d Su Ming hesitated suddenly as he spoke, then he shook his head.\u201cNo can do. Write it this way, \u2018I, Si Kong swear on my status as the son of the tribe leader of Dark Dragon Tribe. Due to an emergency, I borrowed 5,000 stone coins from Dark Mountain Tribe and I have pawned off this Berserker Vessel for a period of 10 years. I promise I will return 10,000 stone coins after 10 years to obtain this spear back. During this period of time, I cannot exchange the spear back. If I break my promise, let the statue of the God of Berserkers punish me!\u2019\u201d As Su Ming finished speaking, he looked at Si Kong.A miserable look settled on Si Kong\u2019s face after he finished listening to Su Ming\u2019s words, especially the last few lines. As he hesitated, he saw Su Ming produce an herb he had never seen before from his bosom. Then he heard Su Ming\u2019s voice next to his ear.\u201cThis is the antidote.\u201dSi Kong stared at the herb and gritted his teeth. He brought his hand to his mouth and bit down on his finger before writing on the piece of sackcloth with his blood. Very soon, the entire phrase was written on the cloth.Su Ming snatched the sackcloth away from and scrutinized it. Excitement appeared in his eyes. He blew at it carefully until the blood dried up before folding it. He then placed it in his bosom and patted it a few times. He smiled as he looked at Si Kong.\u201cSi Kong, remember this, you have to return your debts. I\u2019m only going to wait for you for 10 years!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bright with cunning. He placed the herb on the ground and ran into the distance, leaving Si Kong sitting bitterly on the snow.He picked up the herb quickly. After a brief moment of hesitation, he was still too afraid to eat it. Instead, he got up quickly and ran back to his tribe.After he left, a person\u2019s vague shadow suddenly appeared out of nowhere on the quiet snow plain. It was an old woman with a dark expression on her face. There was a huge staff made of bone in her hands. Perched on top of the staff was a human skull which emitted an eerie glow.\u2018Is that the baby from all those years ago\u2026? What Berserker Art was that? Not even I can tell\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen it before.\u2019The old woman looked towards the direction where Su Ming left. Her eyes glowed as if she was deep in thought. After a long while, she turned and walked towards Dark Dragon Tribe, gradually disappearing.As Su Ming ran in the forest, he occasionally looked at the spear in his hand and giggled foolishly. There was fondness in his eyes. Even Xiao Hong, who was sitting on his shoulders, regarded the spear curiously as it screeched continuously. It could feel a great power hidden within the spear.\u2018It\u2019s your fault for trying to stop me from seeing Bai Ling. Judging by his behavior, he must like Bai Ling. If that\u2019s the case, then quite a lot of people must know that I saved Bai Ling\u2026\u2019Su Ming faltered in his footsteps as he sank into his thoughts.\u2018I wonder how much Bai Ling told them\u2026 If she told them everything, the cave I use to quench herbs is no longer safe\u2026\u2019Su Ming suddenly felt annoyed. He frowned and thought about it for a long time. He traveled through the forest silently into the night.Xiao Hong blinked. As it watched Su Ming seemingly troubled by something, a thought appeared in its head. Realization crossed its face and it grinned. It jumped down from Su Ming\u2019s shoulder and with a few leaps, disappeared into the forest.\u201cRemember, don\u2019t go back to Black Flame Mountain! Don\u2019t go back to the fire cave either!\u201d Su Ming looked at it and quickly shouted.The forest was Xiao Hong\u2019s home. Su Ming was not worried that it would run into danger. He was also not far away from the tribe already. As Su Ming traveled back, he forced himself not to think about the things that troubled him. Instead, he forced himself to be cheerful as he ran back towards the tribe.When midnight came and the moon in the sky was at its brightest, Su Ming saw some of the tribe\u2019s bonfire light from where he stood. He was about to walk out of the forest when he heard rustling sounds coming from behind him. Su Ming turned and he saw Xiao Hong running towards him with excitement and pride on its face.There was big bundle of black fur in its hands. Once it caught up to Su Ming, it immediately stuffed the bundle of fur into Su Ming\u2019s hands. Su Ming at that moment just looked awkward. Then Xiao Hong took a few steps back and pointed at the bundle, then at its own groin. It made a few odd motions as if it was teaching Su Ming how to use the fur\u2026It patted its chest as it proudly screeched a few times. It seemed like Xiao Hong was telling Su Ming about the effects of the thing\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming looked at Xiao Hong and began laughing loudly. When Xiao Hong saw that Su Ming was no longer frowning, it grinned thinking that it had made the right guess and Su Ming was indeed bothered by this.\u201cXiao Hong.\u201d Su Ming squatted down and motioned towards Xiao Hong. The little monkey immediately ran towards him.Su Ming looked at Xiao Hong with a gentle gaze in his eyes. He patted its fur softly as he felt his heart warming up due to the little monkey\u2019s actions.\u201cWhen I\u2019m not around, remember not to go back to Black Flame Mountain. Don\u2019t go back to the fire cave either. Go somewhere else. Once I come back, I\u2019ll look for you.\u201d\u201cAlso, don\u2019t skip those pills I gave you just because you think it tastes bad. You have to eat one every day. Eat them along with the herbs just like how I taught you. Remember that,\u201d Su Ming spoke softly as he smiled. He glanced at Xiao Hong, then walked back to the tribe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was the same place they used for the Berserker\u2019s Awakening ceremony. The elder still wore clothes made of sackcloth and his white hair was still decorated by a huge number of tiny braids. He seemed to be in high spirits as he looked at Bei Ling, Lei Chen, Su Ming and another girl who was of the same age as Su Ming.The girl\u2019s name was Wu La. She was one of the people who were found to possess a Berserker Body during the Awakening. A few months had passed since then and she had now arrived at the peak of the second level of the Blood Solidification Realm. It seemed that it was just a matter of time before she would manifest the 11th blood vein and become a Berserker at the third level of the Blood Solidification Realm.There were two people standing beside the elder. One of them was the Head of the Guards, who also happened to be Bei Ling\u2019s father. His strong body made him look like an iron tower but there was a gentleness within his piercing gaze.The other person was the cold and stoic chief of the hunters, Shan Hen. He looked even more vicious while wearing beast skin. He was never the talkative sort but most of the Berserkers in the tribe respected him. Besides, his hunting team was given the important task of protecting the tribe and providing food so, his status was incredibly high within the tribe.\u201cOur tribe is small and we cannot compare with Wind Stream Tribe. That is why we have to offer tributes to them once every few years to show our acknowledgment of them as our leader. I usually don\u2019t go but this year, I must. Besides us, Dark Dragon Tribe, Black Mountain Tribe and the other small tribes located further ahead will all gather at Wind Stream Tribe.\u201d\u201cAs such, this trip will also be a test for all of you. It is your task to stand out among your peers and not embarrass our tribe. It is up to all of you to do this.\u201d\u201cWe only chose you lot to come with us because you are all the future leaders of Dark Mountain Tribe. This trip will serve as an experience that will help you in the future.\u201d\u201cAmong all of you, Bei Ling has come with us to Wind Stream Tribe twice. He knows some of the details of the trip. You can ask him if you want,\u201d the elder spoke slowly. His voice echoed hoarsely in the air around them.Bei Ling consented to the elder\u2019s request in a low voice. His gaze fell upon Lei Chen, then on the girl called Wu La and finally on Su Ming, who was standing by the side. He frowned.\u201cElder, will this trip be like the previous two times? Will there be\u2026 a test?\u201d Bei Ling hesitated for a moment as he asked the elder respectfully. When the elder nodded, a sharp glint appeared in Bei Ling\u2019s eyes and he pointed at Su Ming.\u201cElder, I believe Su Ming shouldn\u2019t join us. He\u2019s not a Berserker. Even if he joins us, he won\u2019t be of any use or of any help to us. We should leave his spot for another tribe member.\u201dThe moment Bei Ling spoke, Lei Chen\u2019s eyes were immediately filled with displeasure. He took a few steps forward and yelled at Bei Ling.\u201cHe can\u2019t go just because he\u2019s not a Berserker?! Bei Ling, what\u2019s the meaning of this?!\u201dThe girl called Wu La retained her composure as she looked at Su Ming, who remained silent. There was disdain in her eyes but she did not join the argument.\u201cElder, we can only bring four from the younger generation within the tribe every time we join the worship. For the previous tests, I was the only one from Dark Mountain Tribe who was listed as one of the top 50 younger Berserkers. Lei Chen\u2019s joining us this year, so perhaps he can also get a place. Even Wu La, despite not having reached a high level in her training yet has activated nine glows from the statue of the God of Berserkers during her Awakening. Perhaps she can get into the top 100.\u201d\u201cSuch a result is much better than the previous years. If there\u2019s one more person who can get into the top 100, isn\u2019t that even better? Su Ming is just wasting space,\u201d Bei Ling spoke calmly, refusing to even look at Lei Chen, who was glaring at him in anger.\u201cSu Ming will not join the test. I\u2019m bringing him along for another purpose,\u201d the elder spoke slowly.Bei Ling wanted to continue speaking but the Head of the Guards, who was then standing behind the elder glared at him sternly. It made Bei Ling swallow whatever words he was about to say. Bei Ling had always been afraid of his father, ever since he was young.\u201cAlright, we don\u2019t have much time. Let\u2019s go.\u201d The elder raised his right hand and motioned at the clear sky. Thunder roared instantly and spread to all corners of the earth. The white clouds in the sky started turning dark.At the same time, a Berserker Mark formed by numerous blood veins appeared clearly on the elder\u2019s face. It was a python. Once the Berserker Mark appeared, the dark clouds in the sky fluctuated as if they were moved by a pair of invisible hands. They gathered together in the blink of an eye and turned abruptly into a gigantic and ferocious black python that was about 100 feet long!The sight shocked both Lei Chen and Wu La. They stood there, stunned. As for Bei Ling, he was barely able to maintain his calm. He was forcing himself to remain cool.Su Ming stood by the side and looked at the gigantic black python. He took a deep breath and a longing look appeared in his eyes.The Head of the Guards, who was standing behind the elder looked at the gigantic python with a hint of respect. A fanatic look also briefly flashed across Shan Hen\u2019s eyes as he looked at the giant python.Although the python was transfigured from clouds, the scales on its body could be seen clearly. Its body\u2019s strong presence came crashing on them. The python swung its head. Its red eyes were filled with a vicious glare but the glare gradually disappeared and was replaced by a gentle look. It descended from the skies and lowered its head as it laid beside the elder submissively.The elder lifted his feet and climbed up the python. He stood on its head.\u201cCome .\u201dBei Ling was the first to take a leap and step on the giant python\u2019s back. Once he sat down cross-legged, Lei Chen and Wu La also jumped onto the python. Su Ming hesitated for a moment before he also leapt onto its back. Just as he was about to take a few steps back and sit beside Lei Chen, the elder\u2019s voice traveled into his ears.\u201cSu Ming, come to my side!\u201d There was a severe tone in the elder\u2019s voice, which made Su Ming walk anxiously towards the elder. The moment he sat down, he saw the elder glaring at him.\u201cElder\u2026 I was wrong\u2026 I did something really terrible\u2026\u201d Su Ming immediately whispered.The elder ignored him. He waited instead for the Head of the Guards and Shan Hen to get onto the dark python. Then, he waved his right hand and the dark python immediately roared at the sky and flew into the clouds.The tribe beneath them rapidly shrank before their eyes until it was just a small dot as the dark python continued climbing up into the sky. The winds blew past furiously like roaring thunder. It turned Su Ming\u2019s face pale.It was the same for Lei Chen and the others. However, the Head of the Guards and the chief of the hunters stood at the middle and on the tail of the python respectively, protecting them.As for Su Ming, his breathing became rapid under the assault of the fierce wind but soon after, a gentle power surrounded him. It was the might from the elder. It helped Su Ming bear through the discomfort of his first time in the sky.\u201cSo, now you know you did wrong? Pray tell, what did you do wrong? It was that La Su from Dark Dragon Tribe who borrowed 5,000 stone coins from you and pawned off his spear, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d There may have been winds bellowing around them but the elder\u2019s voice still made its way into Su Ming\u2019s ears clearly. With the might of the elder\u2019s Qi around them, no one else on the dark python could hear them besides themselves.\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Su Ming felt really awkward. When he returned to the tribe, he had eagerly gone to the elder to tell him about his exploits. Yet when the elder heard of his tale, his mood darkened and he scolded Su Ming. He even took the long spear away. This caused Su Ming to continuously sigh gloomily in his own house, unable to understand where he went wrong.\u201cElder, I\u2019m sorry\u2026 I shouldn\u2019t have taken Si Kong\u2019s Berserker Vessel, I shouldn\u2019t have been greedy\u2026\u201d Su Ming said carefully as he continued observing the elder\u2019s mood anxiously.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have made him write the blood vow either. Ah\u2026 elder, I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d Su Ming looked at the elder with wide eyes.\u201cOh? Are these your only mistakes? Is there nothing else? Think again. Think carefully about where you did wrong,\u201d the elder spoke slowly as he gave Su Ming a lookSu Ming was stunned and unconsciously scratched his head. He thought about the elder\u2019s words carefully. There seemed to be an underlying meaning to it. Besides the wrongs he listed, did he commit any other mistakes?Su Ming frowned and thought carefully. Suddenly, a cold glint appeared briefly in his eyes and he lifted his head swiftly.\u201cElder, I understand. I should have killed him and gotten rid of his body before taking his Berserker Vessel!\u201dWhen he heard Su Ming\u2019s words, the elder\u2019s pupils very clearly shrank and he stared at Su Ming in surprised. It did not appear like he was looking at the youth before him but he was looking and thinking about something that Su Ming did not seem to understand.\u201cOh? Why do you think you made a mistake there? Why should you have killed him?\u201d The elder looked at Su Ming and asked gently.\u201cBecause he was going to kill me. Elder, you didn\u2019t know about this but he really wanted to kill me. If I wasn\u2019t careful, you wouldn\u2019t be seeing me anymore. But\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. I thought if I really killed him, I would bring about serious trouble to the tribe\u2026\u201d Su Ming explained softly after a moment of hesitation. As he recalled what happened a few days ago, fear still lingered in his heart.\u201cYou\u2019re right\u2026 Su Ming, you must remember this. When you meet someone who wants to kill you, you must get rid of the danger!\u201d The elder closed his eyes. After a long while, he opened them slowly and looked at Su Ming kindly.\u201cBut that is not the mistake I\u2019m talking about. Think, what else did you not consider? Killing people is easy but how can you guarantee your own safety after you have killed someone? If you are in danger, how do you find a way to survive in hopeless situation?\u201d The elder looked at Su Ming and asked softly.Su Ming scratched his head. He displayed exceptional abilities and judgments but in the end, he was still a teenager. His head was still slightly muddled by the elder\u2019s words but he was even more bewildered.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThink carefully. Don\u2019t give me an answer just yet. Once you have understood it, you can tell me. You must learn how to think and reflect on your actions.\u201d The elder closed his eyes.These sort of things happened multiple times when Su Ming was growing up. The elder would often do this. The elder\u2019s teachings played a critical role in Su Ming\u2019s growth.Su Ming sank into deep thought as he recalled everything that happened that day. From the moment he was ambushed by the long spear to Si Kong\u2019s pursuit, right up till the end\u2026Time passed by slowly. After a while, an hour passed by. When they were still less than halfway from Wind Stream Tribe, a strong wind blew from afar, causing the dark python to shake all of a sudden. The people on top of the python also jerked along with its movements. As Su Ming\u2019s body jolted due to the sudden movement, a thought flashed in his head like lightning.\u201cElder\u2026 I know now\u2026\u201d As Su Ming mumbled, a sheen of cold sweat formed on his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What is it that you have now understood?\u201d The elder opened his eyes and looked at Su Ming.\u201cI cannot kill Si Kong! Even if he was the tribe leader\u2019s son, he would not have been able to activate the long spear that was defending the tribe! More importantly, he would not have been able to hide the fact that he came out and killed me on his own from the entire Dark Mountain Tribe!\u201d The more Su Ming spoke, the more shocked and fearful he became. His body was already drenched in cold sweat.\u201cIt may have seemed like he came out to chase me on his own but in reality\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s pupils shrank in fear.\u201cBut in reality, the Elder and tribe leader of Dark Dragon Tribe probably knew about him coming out to kill me! But they did not stop him. Instead, they let it happen!\u201d\u201cAlso\u2026 they were probably right behind him all along, watching the fight between Si Kong and me!\u201d Su Ming took a sharp breath. He was not afraid of all that. He was only afraid of someone witnessing him using the power of the moon. The more he analyzed the situation, the more terrified he became. The whole picture was slowly revealing itself right before his eyes.Shortly after however, Su Ming frowned. His eyes were clouded with bewilderment.\u201cI suppose you don\u2019t understand why the Elder of Dark Dragon Tribe or the tribe leader allowed you to take the spear so easily even though they were following the two of you?\u201d The elder spoke calmly and revealed Su Ming\u2019s biggest doubt at that moment.Su Ming did not speak but he continued thinking. After a while, he looked at the vast world beyond them far away and spoke slowly.\u201cIt could not have been the tribe leader following Si Kong and me. If it had been him, he would not have continued hiding when he saw Si Kong being wounded.\u201d\u201cI believe the one who followed us was\u2026 the Elder of Dark Dragon Tribe! But I don\u2019t understand, why did the Elder of Dark Dragon Tribe allow me to take away that Berserker Vessel?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! The one following you was the Elder of Dark Dragon Tribe, Lei Su!\u201d The elder\u2019s eyes glowed brightly with praise.\u201cYour analysis is correct. If it had been the tribe leader of Dark Dragon Tribe, he would not have stood by as you bullied his son. As for your question, I can give you the answer!\u201d\u201cThis may have seemed like a pursuit after your life but in reality, Dark Dragon Tribe would not have killed you! After all, you saved Bai Ling. If they killed you after you did them a favor, it would have incited the wrath of Dark Mountain Tribe. They would not do that especially since we\u2019re at such a critical moment right now!\u201d The elder\u2019s eyes shone with wisdom as he helped Su Ming continue with his analysis.\u201cWere they trying to scare me?\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes were filled with understanding but in a matter of moments, worry replaced it.\u201cHaha! They wanted to scare people like you who have eyes on a girl from their tribe. Once you\u2019ve been scared off, you won\u2019t approach Dark Dragon Tribe anymore because you\u2019re afraid!\u201d\u201cSi Kong did not know about this. His killing intent was real. Lei Su, the Elder from Dark Dragon Tribe must have used his affection towards Bai Ling to incite his anger. If you were not a match for him, you would have been injured at most. Then she would act in secret, making it seem as if you escaped from death.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re still too young. You can\u2019t see the entire picture. If it was me, I would not have ran. I would have sauntered into their tribe and searched for the girl I liked right in front of their faces. You are her savior and also my child. How could they dare harm you?\u201d The elder smiled and spoke as he patted Su Ming\u2019s head.Su Ming was stunned. His face was filled with remorse.\u201cThis might have been a test from Dark Dragon Tribe for you. After all, the lass you like is Lei Su\u2019s granddaughter.\u201d The elder was still smiling as he looked at Su Ming.\u201cElder, that Elder from Dark Dragon Tribe is too sly!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s face was bitter. When the elder explained everything to him, he finally understood what happened.\u201cDon\u2019t feel so disheartened. Besides not understanding their motive, you did pretty well. Lei Su must not have expected this. Not only were you not battered by Si Kong\u2019s pursuit, you also managed to win against him!\u201d\u201cAs for why Lei Su allowed you to take that Berserker Vessel away\u2026\u201d The elder\u2019s eyes twinkled briefly with understanding.\u201cSince you weren\u2019t scared off, she must have let you take it on purpose. Letting you take the spear was for the purpose of telling me that they\u2019ve repaid their debt to you for saving Bai Ling! Dark Dragon Tribe is slightly different from us, especially Lei Su. She is not that familiar with Berserker Arts but she is good at creating Berserker Vessels. They are not true Berserker Vessels but counterfeits!\u201d\u201cTake for example, that spear of yours. It\u2019s a counterfeit Berserker Vessel. It was created based on one of the three great Berserker Vessels in the old Dark Mountain Tribe, the spear \u2013 Blood Scales.\u201d The elder raised his right hand and slapped Su Ming\u2019s arm. Immediately, he felt a chill traveling into his arm. Instantly, a black line appeared slowly on his right arm.\u201cI have already groomed the spear for you and made some changes. I\u2019ve changed the dark dragon into a black eagle. It can now fuse into your body. And if you want to, you can summon it by thinking about it,\u201d The elder raised his right hand and smiled as he spoke.Su Ming looked at the black line on his right arm and was about to speak after a moment of hesitation.\u201cI know what you want to say. Let me ask you, when you took the Berserker Vessel that Dark Dragon Tribe gave you as payment for saving Bai Ling, what were you thinking?\u201d\u201cAre you going to return the spear in exchange for a chance to see that lass again or are you going to keep it and not see the lass ever again?\u201d The elder grinned as he asked.Su Ming fell into silence for a moment. Then he laughed suddenly.\u201cSi Kong pawned off this spear for 5,000 coins. Obviously, I can\u2019t return it. As for Bai Ling\u2026 I am her savior.\u201d Su Ming winked.The elder laughed out loudly and patted Su Ming\u2019s head. His eyes were filled with praise.Bei Ling sat cross-legged on the middle section of the dark python. He was facing the elder\u2019s and Su Ming\u2019s backs. He did not know what they were talking about but as he saw the elder grinning and Su Ming smiling, he lowered his head.His eyes flared with jealousy.\u2018Su Ming, if you were a Berserker, I wouldn\u2019t have minded. But when you went through your first Awakening, you were proven to not possess a Berserker Body. Why does Ah Xin like a normal person like you? More importantly, why is the elder so good towards you? Is it because you were adopted by the elder?!\u2018You are not even related by blood. I am the hope of the tribe but the elder has never smiled at me before\u2026 Even my father is like this. He always says you have the potential to become the Head of the Guards!\u2018Su Ming, if you weren\u2019t here, Chen Xin, my father and even the elder would not treat me the way they are treating me now. Su Ming, you thought I was cold towards you because of Chen Xin and you wanted to explain to me. You don\u2019t realize that I don\u2019t want to hear your explanations! You\u2019re just a stray child. You don\u2019t even belong to Dark Mountain Tribe. You don\u2019t even look like a member of the Berserker Tribe! What right do you have to try and explain your situation to me? Why should I even waste my time listening to your explanations?!\u2019Bei Ling\u2019s breathing quickened with rage. It took a long while before recovering. When he lifted his head again, he was just like before, cold and aloof.Bei Ling\u2019s father, the Head of the Guards of Dark Mountain Tribe, who was standing not too far away from Bei Ling was frowning. He glanced at Bei Ling, then at Su Ming\u2019s back and sighed quietly.A strange glow appeared briefly in Shan Hen\u2019s eyes. He was standing at the tail of the python right beside Lei Chen. No one knew what he was thinking about. As someone who had always maintained a stoic personality in the tribe, very few could actually see into his thoughts.Time began to pass by quickly as they traveled from Dark Mountain Tribe to Wind Stream Tribe. If Su Ming had chosen to run on foot, he would have taken almost two days to travel from Dark Mountain Tribe to Wind Stream Tribe. On the elder\u2019s python, they managed to see the outline of an extremely big tribe far in the distance in less than two hours.Right in the middle of the tribe was a giant city made of mudstone. The city did not seem big from the sky but as the python descended, its entire form was revealed clearly before Su Ming\u2019s eyes.The majestic city was filled with many houses made of mudstone. It did not look messy and was very tidy. It could not compare with the ruins of the Fire Berserker Tribe Su Ming saw but it was still much stronger than Dark Mountain Tribe, where he was staying.That moat alone was already something that Dark Mountain Tribe could not own.The city walls were several feet tall. If a person stood on the ground, he would have needed to lift up his head to see it. Even though Su Ming was in midair, his heart trembled as he looked at the walls of the city. He was not the only one affected. Lei Chen, who was also leaning over the python and looking downwards, was filled with admiration as well as awe.Wu La was also the same. She looked at the giant city made of mudstone with a dumbfounded expression. She had never seen anything like it before. Only Bei Ling remained calm.Thousands of people could stay within the big city and there would still be space left. In the middle of the city was a humongous pentagon-shaped altar. It was completely black and dozens of feet tall. There was a vague picture of a bird carved on it. It gave off an ancient feeling and was the most striking feature in the city.The mudstone city alone could not show the might of Wind Stream Tribe as the ruler of the region and conqueror of the area, capable of receiving tributes from the numerous small tribes around them. It was also the only tribe qualified to communicate with celestial beings. To top it off, there were also six other tribes like Dark Mountain Tribe around the mudstone city!The six tribes were originally only affiliated to Wind Stream Tribe. At that point, they had already become a part of Wind Stream Tribe.Su Ming stared at the gigantic tribe on the ground with a dumbfounded expression. The might of Wind Stream Tribe had far surpassed his imaginations. A tribe like this was as powerful as the gods to Su Ming. The tribe could destroy any enemy who came their way.As the python approached the area, Su Ming saw many of the tribe members from Wind Stream Tribe lifting their heads as if they were looking at them. Su Ming was not sure whether it was just in his imagination but among the unfamiliar faces, he saw a sort of arrogance in their demeanor.\u201cThis is Wind Stream Tribe!\u201d The elder\u2019s voice echoed from above the python.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe affiliated tribe from Dark Mountain Tribe in the past has now\u2026 become the most powerful in the area!\u201d\u201cElder, was Dark Mountain Tribe as powerful as Wind Stream Tribe in the past?\u201d Wu La asked.The elder did not speak but there was a dim look in his eyes.At that moment, a gentle laughter traveled from within Wind Stream Tribe.\u201cMo Sang, thank you for coming to Wind Stream Tribe!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He lifted his head as he looked at them with a smile on his face.There was some distance between Su Ming and the middle aged man. Yet for some unknown reason, the moment Su Ming heard his voice and looked at him, he saw the image of the man appearing before his eyes as if he was looking at him at close proximity.The strange sight stunned Su Ming. At the same time, as the man\u2019s laughter traveled to his ears, the Qi within his body began circulating as though he lost control of it. It felt like just one glance from the man would make the blood in his entire body burst forth and he would die instantly.Su Ming was not the only one who felt that way. Lei Chen, Wu La, and even Bei Ling felt the same way. Lei Chen shuddered as his eyes were filled with disbelief.Wu La too, was trembling. It was as though the middle aged man she could clearly see before her eyes had some sort of incredible strength that made her want to bow down and worship him.Even Bei Ling\u2019s father, the Head of the Guards of Dark Mountain Tribe was trembling slightly. Slowly, he lowered his head before the man who was walking towards them in midair from the altar below.Besides the Head of the Guards, Shan Hen, the chief of the hunters was breathing rapidly. A hint of fanaticism and anticipation materialized in his eyes. This was an incredibly rare look for him. He was usually stoic and reserved.\u2018Awakening Realm!\u2019Su Ming cried out in his heart. At that moment, these two words formed in his head!\u2018Those who arrive at the Awakening Realm can walk in the skies. They can show their Berserker Mark to the skies and with their mouths, activate their Berserker Blood. With their Qi, they can break through the sky!\u2019These were the words written in the beast skin scroll describing the Awakening Realm.Su Ming stared at the man in purple walking towards them on air, with an astounded expression. He seemed to be in his 40s and was on the leaner side of the spectrum. However, he looked extremely handsome. There were not a lot of signs showing that he was a member of the Berserker Tribe. The only sign that hinted it was a pair of bone earrings he wore.Su Ming had never seen such a beautiful material as the one his purple robe was made from. Coarse linen and sackcloth could in no way have compared to that, much less beast skin and hides.As he walked towards them, Wind Stream Tribe started twisting behind him. It appeared that for a moment, everything disappeared from the world and all that was left was him.What was more, the wind stopped howling and the clouds also froze in the sky!The middle aged man\u2019s long hair flowed behind his back. He smiled as he approached them slowly. His smile was like the spring breeze, causing the Qi and blood within Su Ming as well as the rest of them to gradually calm down. Yet as the middle aged man came closer still, they were overwhelmed by a feeling of suffocation. It was like they were too afraid to take a deep breath.His eyes seemed to contain the sky. When other people looked into them, their minds went blank. It was as if all their secrets would be exposed before him, as though they were standing naked right in front him.The python also appeared to be frozen in midair at that moment. It did not move an inch as though it felt the man\u2019s terrifying aura. The elder slowly stood up straight. The expression within his eyes was unreadable when the man appeared. It was carefully hidden.\u201cGreetings, Wind Stream Berserker Lord.\u201d The elder\u2019s face was old and wizened as he stood up and bowed before the middle aged man.\u201cMo Sang, there\u2019s no need for this between us.\u201d The man\u2019s voice was gentle but he did not stop the elder from bowing. When the elder was done, he swung his right hand through the air like he was going to help the elder up using his Qi.Yet instead of standing, the elder\u2019s body trembled and he bowed once more under the pressure of the force! After that, the force on the elder\u2019s body collapsed. As it dissipated, the elder stood up straight.The man in purple looked at the elder deeply. He smiled and shook his head as he pointed at the elder.\u201cYour temper is still the same as when you were young. So many years have passed, why did you decide to come see me now?\u201d\u201cI have thought about your request all those years ago and I have arrived at a decision,\u201d The elder looked like he always did as he spoke slowly.When the man in purple heard his words, his demeanor changed. He was sharp with concentration.Su Ming and the rest had already stood up and they were standing at the side respectfully. Su Ming was standing the closest to the elder and he could somewhat feel how the elder felt as he looked at his former friend. He could also understand why the elder refused to come to Wind Stream.As he looked at the elder\u2019s old and wizened face, he glanced at the man in purple nervously as his heart pounded against his chest. Su Ming recalled what the elder told him some time ago.\u201cThe Elder from Wind Stream Tribe was not my match before he was 20. When he was 34, he could only barely keep up with me. At that time, my name was known in all the tribes around the region!\u201dSu Ming felt his heart twisting. Just as he was about to avert his gaze, the man in purple smiled and looked at him. With just a glance, there was loud roar in Su Ming\u2019s head. He could clearly tell that the man had seen through the disguise the elder gave him.Just as Su Ming\u2019s body began trembling and was on the verge of breaking down, the man turned away and looked towards Bei Ling, Lei Chen, Wu La, the chief of the hunters, Shan Hen and Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s Head of the Guards.\u201cGreetings, Wind Stream Berserker Lord.\u201d Shan Hen was the first to bow, his actions were quickly followed by the others.Lei Chen\u2019s heart pounded against his chest. He was so nervous his face had become pale. It was the same for Wu La. Even Bei Ling was no longer aloof He was respectful.\u201cI remember you. You\u2019re Bei Ling, right?\u201d The man pointed at Bei Ling.Bei Ling was momentarily stunned. Then his eyes were filled with joy as he quickly spoke with a trembling voice.\u201cBerserker\u2026 Berserker Lord, I am Bei Ling.\u201dThe man in purple smiled as he nodded. He looked at the elder and was just about to speak when his demeanor changed and he looked into the distance. The elder still stood silently by the side. However, he also seemed to have noticed something and looked towards the same direction.There seemed to be a typhoon roaring in the distance. A gigantic black line-like creature descended quickly upon them. As the black line approached them, it became apparent that it was actually a massive dragon. It was about hundreds of feet long.The dragon was hundreds of feet and it looked vicious. Black mist surrounded it as it moved forward. There were six people standing on it!As Su Ming looked at the approaching dragon, he saw a white figure standing among the six people. He smiled.The person who stood in front was an old woman with silver hair. She wore a black robe. Although she looked slightly wizened, it was still obvious that she was incredibly beautiful when she was young. Nonetheless, her face was so cold people felt like they were freezing just by looking at her.Su Ming could tell the elder\u2019s gaze had changed when he looked at the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe.Behind the old woman stood a giant, built like an iron tower. The man was incredibly tall. His face was also cold and the presence of his Qi was so strong he seemed as though he slightly surpassed Shan Hen and the Head of the Guards.Standing by the old woman\u2019s side was a girl in white. The girl\u2019s eyes, as beautiful as they were, held a hint of sorrow that did not seem to disperse. Yet when she saw Su Ming, her sorrow immediately disappeared. It was replaced by shock and joy.She even winked at Su Ming.There was another familiar face among the other three people left. It was Si Kong. He stood on the dragon\u2019s back as he glared at Su Ming. There was hatred in his eyes.The other people were a young boy and a girl about Su Ming\u2019s age. From the looks of it, they were siblings. They were both silent. The girl was larger. She looked busty but she had a beautiful appearance.Once the dragon approached them, the old man and the other people on the dragon bowed towards the man in purple. Their faces were all respectful. Even the dragon underneath them trembled. It seemed terrified of the man.The man in purple was still smiling. He nodded to acknowledge Dark Dragon Tribe\u2019s homage. A person then came towards them at a blinding speed from Wind Stream Tribe. There was purple mist surrounding his feet. As he appeared in midair, he bowed towards the man in purple.The person was an old man wearing a white robe. He was Shi Hai, who took away Su Ming\u2019s pill the other day!\u201cShi Hai, treat our guests well.\u201d Once the man in purple finished speaking and Shi Hai expressed his compliance, he looked at the elder of Dark Mountain Tribe, Mo Sang.\u201cMo Sang, there is a tribe that offered me some Morus Alba Cloud Leaves as tribute. I know that you were fond of this a long time ago. I was waiting for you to come so that I could enjoy it with you.\u201dThe elder nodded his head and turned around to talk with the Head of the Guards. After that, he took a few steps forward and to Su Ming\u2019s surprise, the elder also walked in midair towards the man in purple. Then they flew downwards to the city made of mudstone.As he watched the man in purple, a faint look of yearning appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes.\u2018Awakening Realm\u2026 I wonder if I can also become so powerful!\u2019As Su Ming was looking forward to it quietly in his head, Shi Hai peered at them with a smile on his face.\u201cBesides these young ones, the rest of us are already well-acquainted with each other. You are early. The rest of the tribes have yet to arrive. Allow me to guide you into Wind Stream City!\u201d Shi Hai still had other matters on his mind. He quenched those thoughts as he smiled and spoke politely. He guided the people\u2019s descent into the city made of mudstone.During that time, Lei Chen moved to stand beside Su Ming. He seemed to remember what happened at the square when he saw Bai Ling and felt slightly guilty about it. He thought that if he stood beside Su Ming, he could perhaps push all the blame on him.Su Ming would occasionally look at Bai Ling. There was also a smile on Bai Ling\u2019s face and she would meet his gaze sometimes. When their gazes met, Su Ming\u2019s heartbeat quickened.Not long after, the people from both tribes went into Wind Stream City and landed on a large square. The dragon\u2019s body scattered and transfigured into a large amount of black mist, quickly fusing into the body of the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe.As for the python, it transfigured into white clouds and disappeared into the sky.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere were already tribe members from Wind Stream Tribe waiting on the big square. Under Shi Hai\u2019s orders, some people came forward to guide them courteously towards their lodgings during their stay at the city.However, the politeness was only for show. Underneath all that politeness was still arrogance.Su Ming and the rest were about to follow after Shan Hen and the Head of the Guards to their lodgings, when a voice traveled forth from Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201cSo, you are Su Ming?\u201dSu Ming stopped. When he turned around, he saw the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe looking at him darkly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was filled with anxiety not just because the person talking to him was the Elder of Dark Dragon Tribe but, also because she was Bai Ling\u2019s grandmother.Some of it was also due to the theories and analysis the elder told him on their way to Wind Stream Tribe.\u201cI am Su Ming. Greetings, Elder of Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201d Su Ming took a deep breath and bowed before the old woman reverentially.The old woman\u2019s face was dark as she stared at Su Ming. No one knew what she was thinking. Still, the people around them became quiet because of this. Their guides from Wind Stream Tribe also turned their gazes towards Su Ming. Even Shi Hai, who was about to leave burdened by his thoughts, stopped and looked towards them feeling slightly surprised.Su Ming was only a normal child to him. There was not an ounce of Qi from him. After he took a look at Su Ming, he averted his gaze and no longer thought about the conflict between the two small tribes. Instead, his heart was filled with worry. He had been searching for the Fallen Berserker who created the strange medicine for a long time but found no clues whatsoever. A few days ago, the Elder had asked him about it, making Shi Hai even more troubled because he had no idea where to start.\u2018Could the Fallen Berserker have left this place\u2026? Ah, if that\u2019s the case where should I even start looking?!\u2019Lei Chen stood beside Su Ming. He glared at the old woman who was looking at Su Ming. He was respectful towards the Elder of Wind Stream Tribe but there was not an ounce of respect from him towards the old woman.Bei Ling frowned as he looked at Su Ming. A hint of displeasure appeared briefly in his eyes. He could not understand how Su Ming could have possibly offended Dark Dragon Tribe.\u201cSo many years have passed, you\u2019ve grown up\u2026\u201d The old woman stared at Su Ming for a long time before she spoke slowly. There was no hint of happiness or anger in her tone of voice.Su Ming became even more nervous. He stood there, not knowing what to say. As of then, he could feel everyone\u2019s gaze falling upon him. It was something he seldom experienced and he was incredibly unaccustomed to it.Bai Ling, who was standing behind the old woman looked pale. She unconsciously held onto the corner of her shirt tightly with both of her hands. As for Si Kong, who was standing beside her, he glared at Su Ming and looked at him mockingly.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity\u2026\u201d The old woman stared at Su Ming and continued speaking slowly. \u201cThe elder only brought you up but he did not teach you how to be civilized. You should at least think about your status!\u201d The old woman did not speak much but there was a hint of mockery in her voice. It was a huge clash against her status as the Elder.Su Ming\u2019s face immediately grew pale. It was his biggest weakness and he had it hidden within his heart but the woman had revealed it before so many people. Su Ming bit his lip and kept his silence.\u201cElder!\u201d When Bai Ling saw the pale look on Su Ming\u2019s face, her heart clenched painfully. She immediately spoke up and she looked at the old woman angrily.Lei Chen, who was standing beside Su Ming, immediately glared at the old woman. He did not care who she was. When he saw that Su Ming was being humiliated, he burned with anger and was about to march forward.However the moment he took a step forward, a strange light appeared in the old woman\u2019s eyes. Lei Chen\u2019s body suddenly convulsed. That moment, the Head of the Guards of Dark Mountain Tribe, who had been standing quietly by the side frowned. He immediately took a step forward.Right after, his demeanor changed. A sharp presence erupted from his body and surrounded the area. When it stopped outside Lei Chen\u2019s body, a muffled sound echoed in the air. Lei Chen\u2019s face was pale as he took a few steps back.\u201cLord Elder, there\u2019s no need to do this to the children from my tribe,\u201d The face of the Head of the Guards was dark as he spoke slowly.Just as he was about to take another step forward, the man standing behind the old woman lifted his head abruptly and stepped forward as well. A slightly stronger presence of power than the Head of the Guards\u2019 presented itself.Immediately Shan Hen, who had been keeping his silence, narrowed his eyes and a cold glint flashed across his eyes like a poisonous serpent. He glared coldly at the man from Dark Dragon Tribe.The air crackled with tension!Shi Hai watched the scene not far away. A mocking smile appeared on his lips. In his eyes, the two small tribes were originally one but they had become enemies. He fell silent but did not stop them. Instead, he stood by the side and watched as the scene unfolded.Su Ming lowered his head and still remained silent. Lei Chen\u2019s anger had yet to disappear. He was afraid but just as he was about to speak, Su Ming raised his right hand and grabbed Lei Chen\u2019s arm.Lei Chen was stunned. Su Ming lifted his head slowly. His face was still pale. His frail body made him look like a La Su who would never grow up. There was still a hint of youthfulness on his face which had not disappeared. This was due to a lack of experiences in life that would eventually come in time. Without experiencing the difficulties and trials of life, he was still a child.His eyes were clear. They were very clean and clear, only tainted by a little bit of impurity. He bit his lower lip. As he looked at the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe, he let go of his grip on Lei Chen\u2019s arm and walked forward.The gazes of all those around were still on him but he did not mind. Instead, he took one step at a time, walking past Lei Chen and the Head of the Guards until he was 10 feet away from the old woman.He stood there and looked quietly at the old woman who was still staring at him.\u201cI don\u2019t have any sense of propriety. I don\u2019t have parents. In your eyes, I have neither any right nor status\u2026 But, my elder once told me that you only see one part of the rain in the world. You will never know how much rain there is when it stops\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can only see the surface of the muddy water on the ground and never the bottom\u2026 This year, I am only 16 years old\u2026\u201d Su Ming lowered his head and spoke softly. Once he finished speaking, he turned around and walked away slowly.Lei Chen followed Su Ming and turned around to glare at the old woman as he let out a light huff.When the Head of the Guards and Shan Hen saw that the old woman no longer spoke, they retreated slowly. They left under the guidance of the escorts from Wind Stream Tribe with Bei Ling and Wu La.The old woman watched Su Ming\u2019s retreating back and frowned. There was an unreadable glint in her eyes as she turned around and walked to the back.\u201cBai Ling, come with me.\u201d Bai Ling stood there and watched Su Ming\u2019s retreating figure. Her heart was in a mess. When she heard her grandmother\u2019s words, she left silently with her.Every time each tribe came to pay their respects, they were invited into the mudstone city and brought to their designated lodgings. There, they stayed until everyone finished paying their respects. Dark Mountain Tribe was allocated to the south of the mudstone city. It was a giant house made of nine connecting houses. There were some fences around the house, making it look as if it was isolated from the other parts of the tribe.At that moment, all the members of Dark Mountain Tribe were gathered in one of the house. All of them sat down with their legs crossed as they listened to the Head of the Guards, who was sitting before them.\u201cThe amount of people in Wind Stream Tribe far surpasses the amount of people in Dark Mountain Tribe. As such, the number of Berserkers they have also surpasses ours. Besides, with Wind Stream Tribe as the leader around the area, the tributes they receive when all the other tribes pay homage to them once every few years also allow them to obtain all sorts of herbs.\u201d\u201cThey even have several statues of the God of Berserkers!\u201d The Head of the Guards spoke slowly as he swept his gaze across the people around him.\u201cOur tribe cannot hope to compare with a middle sized tribe. I don\u2019t know just how many Berserkers there are in Wind Stream Tribe but there must be at least hundreds of them!\u201d\u201cThese Berserkers have enough herbs and all sorts of inheritances from the different statues of the God of Berserkers here. Their might is not something a small tribe can compare with. The speed of their training is much faster than ours, their resources are much better than ours, even the possibilities of talented people appearing among them is far higher than our tribe.\u201d\u201cDuring this time, Shan Hen and I will not limit your movements. We brought you here so that you can experience the might of a medium sized tribe and the power of a strong peer from Wind Stream Tribe!\u201d\u201cI want all of you to make some friends while you are here. It does not matter whether they are from Wind Stream Tribe or from other tribes. Except for our enemy, Black Mountain Tribe you can get to know the members from any other tribe.\u201d As the Head of the Guards spoke, his gaze fell upon Su Ming, who remained silent.\u201cAt the same time, I also want you to meet other outstanding people from the other tribes. Find out just how much different you are from them and also set your own target\u2026 But remember this, you are not allowed to fight within Wind Stream Tribe!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We are not the only ones who came here for this purpose. The other tribes also came with similar purposes. Additionally, you might be staying for quite some time in Wind Stream Tribe. When we come to pay homage and offer tributes once every few years, Wind Stream Tribe will also organize a test. If you can obtain a good place in the test, it will do you good individually.\u201d\u201cBei Ling, you have been visiting Wind Stream Tribe for a couple of years. You know this place well. Come and introduce us to the strong peers in Wind Stream Tribe.\u201dBei Ling who was sitting by the side, nodded once he heard those words.\u201cThere are a lot of strong Berserkers in Wind Stream Tribe. Among those of the same age, there are seven people we have to pay attention to\u2026 especially the first one, Ye Wang. He is\u2026\u201dAs Bei Ling made the introductions, Su Ming sat by the side. He still remained silent. The words spoken by the old woman made him feel miserable. Even on his way to the place, her words still echoed in his head. Su Ming closed his eyes and clenched his fists.\u201cSu Ming!\u201d A cold voice suddenly made its way into Su Ming\u2019s ears. He turned around and saw the chief of the hunters, Shan Hen sitting behind him with his legs crossed.\u201cWhy did the Elder from Dark Dragon Tribe speak to you in such a way?\u201d Shan Hen looked at Su Ming calmly and spoke in a low tone.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Su Ming was silent for a moment before he shook his head and spoke.Shan Hen frowned slightly. A strange glimmer appeared briefly in his eyes. Just as he was about to speak, he lifted his head abruptly and peered outside the house. At the same time, the Head of the Guards also looked towards the same direction intently.There was a guide from Wind Stream Tribe, who looked to be in his 30s walking towards their house quickly.\u201cWho is Su Ming? The Elder has summoned you. Please, come with me!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming was stunned. He stood up and looked at the Head of the Guards sitting in front to seek his permission. When he gave a small nod, Su Ming walked out of the house and stood before the Wind Stream Tribe member.\u201cI am Su Ming,\u201d he said calmly.The Wind Stream Tribe member scrutinized Su Ming for a few moments and turned around to leave. Su Ming hesitated for a moment before following him. Just as he was about to walk out of the house, he heard Bei Ling\u2019s voice from behind.\u201cIn the past, the number of people who took the test usually numbered at nearly 100. The ones who usually took the top 50 spots almost entirely belonged to Wind Stream Tribe\u2026 It is especially so for the top 10 places. From my knowledge, there has not been a single outsider who has managed to get into the top 10 ranks for the past 50 years\u2026 It should be the same for the test this year. Remember this, cooperate with me to get into one of the top 50!\u201d\u201cAs long I can get into one of the places in the top 50, even if I\u2019m in the last few ranks, it\u2019ll still be a huge accomplishment for Dark Mountain Tribe!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In front of him, the tribe member who was serving as his guide walked with an arrogant air that Su Ming could clearly see.\u2018He does indeed have the right to be arrogant\u2026\u2019Su Ming looked at the city before him and at the mudstone houses. In his mind, he remembered the houses made of wood and hides in his tribe. Compared to them\u2026 no, there was in fact no room for comparison.During the journey, Su Ming saw far too many members of Wind Stream Tribe. In fact, he had never even seen so many Berserkers in all the 16 years of his life. The city was bustling with activity. Even the beast skins the men and women wore were of much better quality than Su Ming\u2019s.There were even a number of them who wore sackcloth that only the elder could wear in their tribe. These people were all Berserkers with exceptionally strong presence of Qi.\u2018A middle sized tribe\u2026\u2019Su Ming looked at his surroundings, then at the walls of the city far into the distance. He remembered seeing six other tribes, which were like Dark Mountain Tribe outside the city walls when he was still in midair. It was obvious that the citizens there did not have the right to live within the city permanently. They could only live outside.On the way, Su Ming saw a lot of houses which were used for trading purposes. There may not have been a lot of people there but each person who walked in and out of the houses, shook Su Ming\u2019s heart.The land which he walked on was not made out of dirt either. It was covered by rocks which were pressed flat using some unknown method. When he stepped on it, the ground was hard. Su Ming, who was used to soft terrain, was not used to it.Su Ming also saw several giant bows about hundreds of feet long hanging on the walls of the mudstone city. They were entirely black and gave off a vengeful aura. It made those who looked at them chills down their spines.\u201cAre you done looking?\u201d A piercing voice turned Su Ming\u2019s attention away from his surroundings. It was the guide from Wind Stream Tribe. He looked at Su Ming as he smiled.His smile had an air of arrogance which turned it into a mocking smile. He was not laughing at Su Ming alone but jeering at the people who came from smaller tribes and had similar expressions of awe.\u201cYou can look around later. You\u2019ll be staying here for a while so, you can wander around as much as you like any time you want. I suggest that you get out of your house at night. You should go out and walk around. The night scenery in your tribe cannot compare with the likes of the night scenery in Wind Stream Tribe.\u201d\u201cFollow me now. We can\u2019t have the Elder waiting for long.\u201d The tribe member patted Su Ming\u2019s shoulder, then turned around and walked forward even more quickly.Su Ming followed quickly in silence.Right in the center of the mudstone city within the pentagonal altar, were three secret rooms. The Elder of Wind Stream Tribe, the man in purple who had reached the Awakening Realm was sitting in one of the secret rooms with his legs crossed. The elder of Dark Mountain Tribe, Mo Sang was sitting across him calmly.Between them was a chessboard. Most of the chess pieces were made from animal bones and looked rough on the edges. The chessboard was made from a big stone with squares carved on it.Besides the chessboard, there was also a stone cup the size of a fist in each of their hands. There was hot steam coming from the cups, along with a nice fragrance spreading around the room.\u201cMo Sang, when you came back, you gave me this chessboard and the chess pieces. You even taught me how to play chess. You must have wanted to avoid from being lonely and also wanted someone to cure your boredom.\u201d The man in purple picked up a beast bone chess piece and placed it on a part of the chessboard. Then he lifted his head and smiled.\u201cThis chessboard came from the Taia Tribe. I heard that an Ancient from Taia made it in the image of an item from a land faraway\u2026 It\u2019s a pity. I haven\u2019t touched this in many years. Now, I can\u2019t win against you anymore.\u201d The elder took a chess piece and placed it on a corner of the board as he spoke softly.\u201cMo Sang, I have always admired you.\u201d The man in purple sighed as he looked at Mo Sang, who looked old and wizened. Memories of when they were young appeared in his head. In his memories, the person before him had been so energetic and proud\u2026 Among those of the same age, there was no one who did not know his name\u2026 Yet, who would have thought the prodigy in the past would become such a wizened old man.\u201cYou should not have been born in Dark Mountain Tribe\u2026 If you had agreed to the elder\u2019s promise and became his Berserker\u2019s Son, the Elder of Wind Stream Tribe now would not be me, but you\u2026\u201d\u201cBesides, you wouldn\u2019t have found your training to be so difficult. You should have reached the Awakening Realm a long time before I did\u2026 The elder even mentioned that you were the one who held the most promise to reach the Bone Sacrifice Realm among all the people he\u2019s met in his life!\u201d When he spoke of the Bone Sacrifice Realm, a bright light appeared in the man\u2019s eyes and they were filled with longing.\u201cBone Sacrifice\u2026 Bone Sacrifice\u2026 Sacrifice the 13th piece of your spine to break the seal of destiny, thereby turning the 13th piece of your spine into the true Berserker Bone, as obtained by the Ancients of the Berserker Tribe!\u201d As the man in purple spoke, the light in his eyes dimmed.\u201cI can\u2019t do it\u2026\u201dMo Sang was silent. When he heard the mention of the Awakening Realm, there was bitterness and nostalgia on his face.\u201cIf only you had agreed to the elder\u2019s promise that year and took Wen Yan as your wife and joined Wind Stream Tribe, the elder would have used all the resources within the tribe to help you sacrifice your bones! If you had reached the Bone Sacrifice Realm, the Wind Stream Tribe would not have been hidden away here\u2026\u201d The man in purple smiled bitterly.\u201cJing Nan, it is all in the past now,\u201d Mo Sang said slowly.\u201cThat\u2019s right, it\u2019s all in the past now\u2026\u201d When the man in purple heard Mo Sang calling his name, he shook his head and sighed.\u201cYou were only willing to see me, your old friend this time because of the child who was standing beside you, right\u2026? He should be the baby you brought back that year,\u201d Jing Nan looked at Mo Sang and spoke slowly.\u201cThat is one of the reasons!\u201d Mo Sang raised the stone cup and blew at the beverage. Once some of the heat went away, he took a gentle sip.\u201cI could tell that the blood red moon from before was related to Black Mountain Tribe\u2026 Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s Bi Tu must have found another way\u2026\u201d The elder placed the stone cup down.\u201cI won\u2019t hide from you. He will arrive at the Awakening Realm anytime now! Mo Sang, if you ask me to kill him, then\u2026\u201d Jing Nan hesitated for a moment, then he shook his head.\u201cI can\u2019t do that. If he manages to reach Awakening Realm, it will be a great help to Wind Stream Tribe. Even if you agree to my request all those years ago, I still won\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d The elder smiled lightly. He expected this answer a long time ago anyway. Jing Nan was not as friendly as he seemed. They both knew more than anyone about their dispute.\u201cYou have your own problems, I understand. This is between me and him.It must come to an end eventually! I came here today to make a trade with you!\u201d\u201cOh? Go on.\u201d The Elder of Wind Stream Tribe, Jing Nan spoke slowly as a light flashed briefly in his eyes.The elder spoke softly. His voice was faint and only Jing Nan could hear him. Once Jing Nan heard it, his demeanor did not change. However, he closed his eyes and appeared to be deep in thought.The elder did not urge him. Instead, he took the stone cup and sipped his drink slowly.Time passed by slowly and silence filled the room. They had no idea how much time had passed when suddenly, a reverential voice was heard outside the secret room.\u201cElder, I\u2019ve brought Su Ming here.\u201d\u201cSend him in.\u201d Jing Nan still kept his eyes closed.Footsteps gradually approached from afar amid the silence of the room.Su Ming was very nervous. He walked forward one step at a time. The light was not bright inside the room. It was in fact, rather dark. As he moved forward to the end of the corridor, he saw the elder and the man in purple in the secret room.When he saw the elder, Su Ming let out a sigh of relief.\u201cSu Ming, come to my side.\u201d The elder smiled and waved at Su Ming. Su Ming walked forward quickly and stood behind the elder with his head bowed. He did not speak.\u201cTell me your second request.\u201d After a moment, Jing Nan opened his eyes and a brilliant light manifested for a moment in his eyes. He stared at the elder, Mo Sang and continued to speak slowly.\u201cI want a drop of your Berserker Blood!\u201d The elder also stared at Jing Nan and spoke in the same manner.Jing Nan immediately frowned. All Berserkers had Berserker Blood but he was a powerful Berserker in the Awakening Realm. His Berserker Blood was extremely valuable. Every time he gave a drop, he needed to train for a long time before he could recover it. Besides the members of his tribe who had extraordinary talent and proved to be exceptional, he seldom granted his Berserker Blood.Jing Nan looked past Mo Sang at Su Ming silently.Although Su Ming lowered his head, he could still feel the man in purple\u2019s gaze on him like a needle.\u201cIs it for him? This child is ordinary. He will find it hard trying to absorb one drop of my blood into his veins. It\u2019ll just be a waste. Change your request.\u201d Jing Nan averted his gaze and spoke calmly.\u201cThese are my two requests. I will not change them. If you agree to it, I will teach you the Ancient Berserker Art \u2013 the true Awakening!\u201d Mo Sang handed the stone cup to Su Ming and motioned for him to drink from it.Once Su Ming took the cup, he did not hesitate and drank the whole thing in one mouthful. A comfortable wave of heat immediately spread throughout his body.Jing Nan frowned. He sank into his thoughts for a moment before he looked at Mo Sang. All of a sudden, he spoke.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll agree to your two requests. But for the Berserker Blood \u2026 You should know that there are three stages to the test. I will give a drop of my blood to the top three contestants in each stage. To avoid any wastage, I will add a condition. If this child can get into the top 40 in any one of the stages in this test, I will give him a drop of my Berserker Blood!\u201d\u201cIf he doesn\u2019t, you must change your request!\u201dThe elder thought about his words and believed that the man before him was making things difficult. After a moment of thought, he nodded. In his head, he was already thinking about how he could benefit Su Ming similarly if he had to change his request.Su Ming listened to the exchange and looked at the white hair on the elder\u2019s head as well as the wrinkles on his face. He thought of the ridicule delivered by the old woman from Dark Mountain Tribe and Bei Ling\u2019s indifferent attitude towards him. He even thought about the loneliness that he grew up with and how he would sit alone looking at the night sky. He would imagine the things written in the beast skin scroll as he gazed into the sky. All these things enveloped Su Ming\u2019s thoughts. They transformed into a strength and resolution he never had before!This resolution was even stronger than the one when he worshiped the statue of the God of Berserkers!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe elder stood up and motioned Su Ming to follow him. Just as he was about to leave, Jing Nan stared at Mo Sang. After a moment of hesitation, he spoke abruptly.\u201cMo Sang, I have a question that has been plaguing my mind for dozens of years. I must ask you\u2026 Since you\u2019re in Wind Stream Tribe now, I hope you will answer my question!\u201dThe elder did not stop. He continued walking as Su Ming followed him. Jing Nan\u2019s voice traveled towards them from behind.\u201cYou are only at the ninth level of the Blood Solidification Realm but from the past and even now, why is it that I can feel a faint hint of Awakening on you?!\u201d The man in purple spoke quickly but he did not reveal all his thoughts. He could not tell Mo Sang that the aura within him made him feel slightly alarmed.He had that feeling of terror back then, and he still got the same feeling at that point in time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could somewhat tell that the relationship between his elder and Wind Stream Tribe\u2019s Elder was not as it seems. There was a high possibility that there was some dispute that happened between them in the past.It probably had something to do with the elder\u2019s constant refusal to travel to Wind Stream. At the same time, the Elder of Wind Stream Tribe must have also been worried because he was still polite towards the elder even though he was only at the Blood Solidification Realm.Su Ming recalled the sight of the elder and the man in purple walking in midair while they were still on the dark python. His heart raced against his chest.\u201cYou will learn about it later.\u201d The elder did not provide any answer. He delivered his words leisurely and brought Su Ming out of the pentagonal altar.Within the altar, Jing Nan fell silent. As he gazed at the direction Mo Sang left, his face became troubled. After a long while, he brought out a small bottle from his bosom. The color of the bottle was purple and it looked incredibly beautiful. He carried the item around, so it was obvious that the item was something incredibly valuable to him.Once he opened the bottle, a nice medicinal fragrance was released. Within the bottle was a pill!It was a Scattering Dust pill!\u2018It\u2019s a pity there\u2019s only one pill\u2026 There\u2019s little to no effect if there\u2019s only one pill for me. But if I had eight more\u2026\u2019A yearning look appeared briefly in Jing Nan\u2019s eyes.\u2018I must find the Fallen Berserker who created this! I must find him at all costs\u2026 I\u2019ve already sealed off the surroundings. There is no way he can escape!\u2018I can feel it. He\u2019s near. He\u2019s very near\u2026\u2019It was already dusk outside. Night was about to arrive in the mudstone city but there were still many people wandering about and the city was bustling with activity. There were fires in various parts of the city. They were found in appliances Su Ming had never seen before and they floated in midair, lighting up the entire city.The elder walked forward as Su Ming followed him. The two of them were quiet as they walked.\u201cThe test held by Wind Stream Tribe will begin in seven days. The test is organized by Wind Stream Tribe and all the small tribes who come here to pay homage have to send representatives to enter the test. It is a grand ceremony held for you young ones!\u201d\u201cI want you to enter the test. You don\u2019t need to worry about your powers being exposed. I have already made arrangements. Take this. Besides Jing Nan, no one will know who you are.\u201d\u201cSu Ming, I can only help you so much. Everything else is up to you\u2026\u201d The elder stroked Su Ming\u2019s head and said kindly. He swung his right hand and immediately, a faint presence of Qi appeared. It disappeared just as quickly and a black straw hat appeared in the elder\u2019s hand.\u201cI got this when I was traveling in a big tribe a long time ago. I suppose you can consider it a Berserker Vessel. If you absorb it into your blood, it can change your figure and appearance slightly. It\u2019s not much but you\u2019ll look different. This was something I really liked when I was young.\u201d\u201cThis thing has served me a lot of times but it\u2019s no longer of any use to me. I\u2019ll give it to you now.\u201d The elder slapped the black straw hat on Su Ming and Su Ming immediately felt his body lurch. A cold sensation seeped into his body and the straw hat disappeared instantly.Even though it disappeared, Su Ming could still feel that the item had done the same thing as the counterfeit Blood Scales. It had fused into his body. The elder also told him how to use the straw hat to change his appearance.\u201cDuring the test, don\u2019t follow us. Stay in the house. Once we leave, change your appearance and I\u2019ll arrange for someone to take you to the venue of the test.\u201d The elder smiled lightly.Su Ming wanted to say something but after some hesitation, he chose not to speak. Nonetheless, he was determined not to disappoint the elder even if it meant fighting with everything he had!\u2018Top 40\u2026Top 40!\u2019Su Ming gritted his teeth.\u201cSu Ming, I\u2019ve always instructed you to think and analyze since you were young because it would help you a lot\u2026 Now, I will give you a question. Let\u2019s see whether my little La Su can figure it out\u2026\u201d The elder looked at Su Ming kindly. He winked as he smiled and spoke.\u201cListen well, Su Ming. I will only tell you once. 32, 79, 248, 371, 563, 781!\u201dSu Ming was stunned. He mumbled the six numbers under his breath but could not figure out the meaning behind them. He looked at the elder\u2019s smile and he knew that the elder would not tell him straightaway. Su Ming memorized the six numbers in his head and fell into deep thought.Moonlight shone on their bodies and gradually, their shadows lengthened. As their shadows gradually became faint, Su Ming and the elder walked into the distance\u2026Time passed by and soon, it was the sixth night. The grand ceremony held by Wind Stream Tribe would start once morning arrived\u2026During the six days there, Su Ming sat within the house given to Dark Mountain Tribe by Wind Stream Tribe. He meditated as he activated and circulated the Qi within his body. As he did so, he would be careful. He always felt like he was being watched but he could never identify by whom.During the time he was under scrutiny, Su Ming would have to forcefully stop his training. When the strange feeling of being observed was at its strongest, he chose to lie down and give up on training. He would close his eyes and sleep as he thought about the six numbers. However, no matter how much he thought about them, he could not find an answer to the riddle.It was not until the fifth day when the feeling of being observed disappeared completely. Su Ming felt rather nervous about it. He had once tried to guess who had been observing him. The figure of a person would appear in his head but he had never been able to ascertain his guess.During the past few days, Lei Chen went to Su Ming a few times but the rest of his time was spent with Wu La. Under the elder\u2019s guidance, they trained for the last few remaining days before the test. Although with his personality, he would drag Su Ming out and wander about the city of mudstone after a moment of training. Sometimes if Su Ming was unwilling to go, Lei Chen would go out on his own. Every time he came back, there would be a mysterious look on his face.The look on his face seemed somewhat familiar no matter how Su Ming looked at it\u2026\u201cSu Ming, you don\u2019t understand. There\u2019s actually such a place within this mudstone city\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen so many women in my life\u2026\u201d\u201cSu Ming, there\u2019s a type of water here they call wine. Its taste is\u2026 Do you want to try it?\u201d\u201cSu Ming, guess what I saw today. I saw Black Mountain Tribe approaching on a black cloud. But the Elder from Black Mountain Tribe didn\u2019t come. I heard that the one who brought them here was their tribe leader.\u201d\u201cSu Ming, stop sleeping! Listen to me! I met a member of Black Mountain Tribe today at the place I drank wine. He\u2019s about the same age as us and he\u2019s seriously arrogant. If it wasn\u2019t because we weren\u2019t allowed to fight, I would have gone and beaten him up!\u201d\u201cSu Ming, I saw Bai Ling today! It was weird though. You think she was really tricked by us? She didn\u2019t even ask about the stone coins. But when she saw me, she asked me about you.\u201d\u201cSu Ming, I think I like someone\u2026 It\u2019s the person I talked to you about yesterday. Didn\u2019t we see Bai Ling? There was a girl beside her. She\u2019s also from Dark Dragon Tribe. She\u2019s really busty and she looks way prettier than Bai Ling\u2026\u201d\u201cSu Ming, I finally know her name. She\u2019s called Bai Fang. It\u2019s such a nice name\u2026\u201dDuring the past few days, Lei Chen would drop by and talk to Su Ming about what he saw and his thoughts about them. It was especially so during the last few days. Almost every single sentence out of his mouth was about that girl called Bai Fang.As for Bei Ling, he was usually out. Even if he was in the house, there were a lot of young men from Wind Stream Tribe who came to see him. They looked really friendly with each other.However, on the sixth night when Su Ming went out of the house to look at the moon, he saw Bei Ling being dragged away by his Wind Stream Tribe friends in the distance. He did not seem willing to be taken away.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go today\u2026\u201d Bei Ling hesitated for a while when he was at the door and said in a low tone.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to? Sure. But Bei Ling, you were personally invited by Wu Sen to join the ritual. If you don\u2019t join, you won\u2019t be able to obtain our Elder\u2019s Berserker Blood!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget just how you were able to get a place in the top 50 the last time.\u201d The person from Wind Stream Tribe who was dragging Bei Ling was a boy in his late teens. He smiled as he spoke slowly.There were two other people with them. They cast their eyes on Bei Ling and in them were hints of mockery.Bei Ling was silent and nodded his head slowly. He followed the three people and disappeared into the dark.Su Ming stood in the distance and watched with a slight frown. He fell into brief silence and looked at the moon in the sky. Then he walked out of the house.\u2018Wu Sen\u2026\u2019Su Ming could still remember Bei Ling mentioning that name. According to him, Wu Sen was one of the three strongest among the younger generation in Wind Stream Tribe. Almost everyone was certain that he was bound to get a place in the top three in all three stages of the test that year.Bei Ling did not go into detailed explanation about him. He only talked about him briefly and moved on to the next person.As he walked through the darker parts of the brightly lit mudstone city, Su Ming\u2019s body began changing. After a while, he grew seven inches taller and his body became bulkier. Even his hair became longer. His face was no longer handsome and clean. Instead, it just looked simple. He gave off a strong presence and looked completely different from his usual frailer self.Even his clothes changed. It was a strange sight to behold.Su Ming moved his body and found no discomfort with his new image. In fact, he felt just as he usually did. As he activated the Qi in his body, the 49 blood veins did not appear on his skin but a strong presence erupted from his body.\u2018Under the moonlight\u2026 even a Berserker at the fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm is no match for me\u2026 Besides, I have Blood Scales\u2026 what can a sixth level Berserker of the Blood Solidification Realm do against me?!\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes flashed and he lifted his head to look at the moonlight before walking forward.\u2018Bei Ling has just entered the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. As for his father, the Head of the Guards and the chief of the hunters, they are both at the eighth level. Among the younger generation, it\u2019s extremely rare for anyone to arrive at the eighth level. They would have to surpass their peers by leaps and bounds to arrive there. Wu Sen and the other two are about the same in terms of power so it\u2019ll be safe to say that they have not reached the eighth level!\u2019Su Ming\u2019s footsteps were not quick. The path he took was strange as he only walked in dark corners. He watched Bei Ling and the other three people from afar. He followed them from a distance.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018The other three people should only be at the fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm but judging from how wary Bei Ling is of them, Wu Sen\u2019s strength must be greater than his. If it\u2019s above the sixth level but weaker than the eighth level, Wu Sen should most probably be at the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm!\u2018I cannot win against a Berserker at the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm but I have the moonlight. Even if we do end up fighting, he won\u2019t be able to make me stay against my will.\u2019Su Ming was extremely confident with his own speed.He did not follow them out of curiosity. It was because Bei Ling had seemed unwilling to follow them. Since he used to call Bei Ling his brother when he was young, Su Ming followed them with mixed feelings.Time passed by slowly. The moon hung high in the sky. Bei Ling and the other three people disappeared into a common looking mudstone house. The place was rather secluded. It was located in a corner of the city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He stared at the house for a moment. Then slowly, he frowned. He quickly went up to the house and opened the door. There was no one inside.\u201cInteresting,\u201d Su Ming mumbled to himself. He looked at his surroundings. There was a hole on the ground at the end of the house.He hesitated for a moment, then squatted down by the hole and observed it for a moment. He also touched the insides of the hole. Its walls were made of dirt and they were dry. It was obvious that the hole had existed for a long time.His eyes gleamed and he jumped into the hole. There was a tunnel in there. Su Ming ran along the tunnel without making a sound. As he moved forward, he began to determine where the tunnel headed. It was not hard to tell that it led outside the mudstone city.There were messy looking footprints on the tunnel grounds. Su Ming would stop sometimes to observe them. Once he was done, he calculated the amount of people he expected in his heart.\u2018There\u2019s about seven or eight people.\u2019Su Ming thought for a moment and took out his horn. As he moved forward, he dug deep pits into the ground. As it was just soil and the horn was sharp, Su Ming spent no effort in digging the holes into the ground.Su Ming even saw a spot in the tunnel where the ceiling was supported by a thick round log when he lifted his head. It seemed like it was there for fear of the tunnel collapsing. Su Ming looked at it for a while. Then the corners of his lips curled up into a smile.After some time, about 10,000 feet into the tunnel, Su Ming stopped. He saw moonlight nearby, an obvious sign that he had arrived at the exit.He could also hear a faint voice floating about just outside the exit.The voice seemed to be chanting and there was a certain strangeness to it. The voice did not seem to be too far away. Su Ming kept his head low as he approached the exit. Soon after, he lifted his head to take a quick glance outside. He took a step back immediately.With just a glance and help of the moonlight, he saw a person sitting down with his legs crossed, meditating. It seemed like he was keeping watch of the hole.\u2018Judging by his Qi, that person keeping watch is only at the fourth level.\u2019Su Ming was calm. Once he took a step forward, he jumped. The moment he rushed out, the Wind Stream Tribe member sitting cross-legged by the exit opened his eyes as if he was caught by surprise.In the short period that he was stunned, Su Ming lifted his right hand and swung it gently. The young man instantaneously felt sharp pain in his entire body. It felt like firelight spreading right before his eyes like an uncountable amount of needles. He coughed out a mouthful of blood. Just as he was about to let out a sharp scream, a cold and strong hand reached out from behind his head and covered his mouth. He was unable to scream and could only moan as he struggled.Soon enough, his body twitched and he fainted.Behind him, Su Ming\u2019s face remained calm as he placed the person down gently. He squatted down and looked at his surroundings. It was midnight. There was only silence around him. He could see the faint contours of the mudstone city from a distance and the light from the bonfires of the affiliated tribes.Su Ming also saw another bonfire burning from a different direction. However, the light emitting from the fire was not red but green! There was a certain peculiarity to the green fire and under the moonlight, it looked ghastly.The chants he heard came from the direction of the green bonfire.Su Ming frowned. He approached the grim location quietly and slowly. As he got nearer, he squatted down. He saw something that made his heart jump.The green fire was burning brightly, sustained by numerous dried branches. Su Ming also saw some corpses within the fire. It was apparent that they had been lifeless since long time ago. As they burned in the fire, light crackling sounds could be heard.There were seven people sitting around the fire. Among the seven, one of them was sitting right in front of the fire. As for the other six, they were sitting together in groups of three by the fire\u2019s side. One of them was Bei Ling!The person sitting right in front of the fire was a young man wearing a black robe. He was bald and exceptionally handsome. Under the illumination of the fire, he seemed a bit devilish.Su Ming did not make a sound. He squatted down and watched the scene intently. Gradually, he began to piece together what was happening. Not long after, six whiffs of air emerged from the green fire. The air was absorbed through the mouths, noses, eyes, ears, and tongues of the six people sitting by the bald man\u2019s side. It made their faces even paler and their bodies began to shake.After a while, one of the six stood up and went towards the bald young man. He knelt down on one knee and hit his chest hard with both hands. Immediately, his body began trembling even harder. Then, a green drop of fresh blood was forced out from between his brows. It floated towards the bald young man. At the same time, a drop of dark green blood the size of a fingernail was forced out from between the bald young man\u2019s brows too. It mixed together with the blood offered by the person before him.Once the green blood fused together, a vast amount of blood veins appeared on the bald young man\u2019s body. They had a tinge of green in them.A strong presence of Qi erupted forth from the bald young man\u2019s body. Su Ming narrowed his eyes and knew he had judged wrongly. This person was indeed not a Berserker at the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm or the seventh level but\u2026 the sixth!He was already at the peak of the sixth level and was just about to break through into the seventh level.\u2018Looks like I\u2019ve overestimated Wind Stream Tribe.\u2019Su Ming remained unmoved and focused his gaze on Bei Ling. Besides Bei Ling, the rest of them had already stood up and forced out a drop of blood from between their brows. They then returned to their places, exhausted.\u201cWu Sen\u2026 I already gave you dozens of phosphorous blood for the past few days and I\u2019m really weak now. The test is in the morning. Can I just give you a drop today?\u201d Bei Ling opened his eyes and looked at the bald young man with a troubled gaze as he spoke in a low tone.\u201cHmm?\u201d The bald young man was Wu Sen. There was a tinge of green in his eyes as he looked at Bei Ling.\u201cDo you intend to break your promise? I\u2019ve said before that if you help me break through the seventh level and I finally obtain the Elder\u2019s Berserker Blood, I will give you a tiny bit. It was the same in the past. If that\u2019s the case, you can choose not to join the first two stages of the test. I\u2019ll give you some blood for the final stage. Then you\u2019ll find no problems getting a place in the top 50.\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Bei Ling hesitated for a moment as if he was struggling internally. However shortly after, he gritted his teeth and walked forward, kneeling on one knee before Wu Sen. He hit his chest with both hands and immediately, his body started trembling. A drop of green blood flew out from between his brows.Bei Ling was in a state of fatigue and he looked like was going to wither. Just as the blood flew out and Bei Ling was about to get up and retreat to recover, Wu Sen\u2019s eyes flashed. He raised his right hand instantly and tapped it against the defenseless Bei Ling\u2019s forehead.\u201cYou!\u201d Bei Ling shuddered violently and was about to resist but, the moment his finger touched him, the spot between his brows opened up and drops of blood flew out quickly!\u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re friends. I won\u2019t kill you. I\u2019m just assisting you to not hesitate any longer and offer me everything you have for tonight\u2026\u201d Wu Sen smiled strangely and retrieved his finger. He was just about to control the ball of dark green blood and fuse it with the blood from Bei Ling\u2019s brows when his body jolted. His eyes abruptly opened wide.He did not even have time to recall the ball of dark green blood into his body. He swiftly retreated a few steps and looked as if he had fused into the green fire.A black light suddenly appeared. As howling sounds echoed in the air, a long black spear rushed towards them like a great black dragon. It bypassed the others in an instant. It went past Bei Ling, who was stunned and went straight towards Wu Sen.There was a loud, muffled bang. The fire exploded all of a sudden and a large amount of green flames spread around the area. A sturdy looking person appeared out of nowhere. His speed was so quick he seemingly arrived in front of Bei Ling the moment the explosion occurred. He grabbed the air with his right hand along with Bei Ling\u2019s fresh blood and Wu Sen\u2019s dark green blood. They fell into the man\u2019s hands in an instant.The man was Su Ming who had earlier changed his appearance!\u201cThis fresh blood is good. I\u2019ll take it.\u201d His voice was hoarse. He moved his left hand and the black spear which was stuck on the ground turned into a bundle of black mist that he held in his hand.Su Ming spoke slowly. He looked at Wu Sen, who had retreated the moment the flames scattered. Wu Sen\u2019s face was grave and there was a hint of viciousness in him as well.\u201cYou\u2019re just asking for death!\u201d Wu Sen roared and instantly, a large amount of green air gushed forth from his body and surrounded him. It transformed him into a figure of about 30 feet in height. The green figure lifted its head and roared at the sky. It lifted its arms like a zombie and jumped towards Su Ming.At the same time, the others also reacted and activated the Qi in their bodies. However, because they had been offering green blood multiple times, they were still in a weakened condition. As they were about to take action, Su Ming smirked coldly and stuck the long spear in his left hand into the ground.The Qi within his body immediately rushed into the long spear, causing a large amount of black mist to spew from the spear. The moment the spear pierced the ground, a clamor resounded through the air and the land trembled. A wave of air spread towards their surroundings with Su Ming as the center. It caused the weakened individuals to step back involuntarily.Then almost immediately, Su Ming rushed towards Wu Sen at lightning speed, lifting the long spear in his left hand simultaneously. The black mist drove into the sky and turned into a faint shape of a black eagle. It opened its wings and created a huge gust of wind as it rushed towards the zombie-like figure.At that moment, no one noticed that the moon had brightened up. A sliver of moonlight appeared out of nowhere and fused into the black eagle to aid it in its fight against the faint green figure.The clash was like a thunderbolt. After a huge bang, Su Ming rolled backwards. He staggered for a few steps and quickly retreated towards the tunnel.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe moment he retreated, a furious roar could be heard. The green figure crumbled and Wu Sen\u2019s face was twisted with malice. There was a wound on his chest and fresh blood flowed out from the wound.\u201cHow dare you hurt me?!\u201d The green tint in his eyes grew darker and he rushed forward instantly in pursuit.Su Ming ran forward as Wu Sen chased after him. In the blink of an eye, they disappeared into the tunnel. The people left behind, including Bei Ling were all dumbstruck with astonishment. They looked at each other and none of them dared to chase after the duo.Before long, a muffled sound came from underground like the tunnel had collapsed. They also heard the remote sounds of a furious bellow. After a long while, Wu Sen came out of the tunnel\u2019s exit with a gloomy face. He looked incredibly pathetic and was overcome by anger. However, underneath that anger was also a hint of anxiety that was not easily discovered by the others.\u201cI\u2019ve already retrieved my Blood of Corpses but I won\u2019t be refining it tonight. Find that person. You must find him! He\u2019s not from Wind Stream Tribe! Find him. I want to break his neck with my own hands!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was like they were angry. The winds lifted the dust off the land and up into the sky, blurring out the moon.Several figures ran inside the city of mudstone in the middle of night as though they were looking for something. However, they were in the dark because they had no idea where to start looking. It was not until the first rays of sunlight, which lit up the horizon far into the distance that the people began leaving.Bei Ling went back to Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings fatigued and pale. That night, he lost a large amount of blood between his brows so his body was incredibly weak. He also watched with his own eyes the short but shocking fight!There was the spear that flew towards them like a thunderbolt and caused the earth to tremble. Wu Sen\u2019s crazed roar in anger also echoed in his ears. To Bei Ling, Wu Sen was Wind Stream Tribe\u2019s blessed child. They may have both been at the sixth level but, Bei Ling knew that he could not win against him. In fact\u2026 he did not even dare challenge him.He did not train in the usual Berserker\u2019s Method. He had worshiped the statue of the God of Berserkers when he was young. Yet apparently, there was a mysterious statue among all the statues of the God of Berserkers within Wind Stream Tribe. Those who received its inheritance needed to use the aura of corpses to train and gather their Berserker Blood to turn into a corpse. If it was successful, the practitioner would practically be invincible.\u2018Just who was that person who fought against Wu Sen\u2026 I can\u2019t gauge his strength but, if he pushed Wu Sen into a corner, he must also be a well-known Berserker. Could he be from Black Mountain Tribe?\u2019Bei Ling\u2019s gaze was dark. He was the most powerful Berserker among his peers in Dark Mountain Tribe but he knew that once he left his tribe, he was a nobody.Bei Ling returned to the lodgings and to his room with these convoluted feelings as well as uncertainty regarding the test in the morning. However the moment he opened the door to his room, his body shook and his pupils shrank. The hairs on his body stood up and he breathed in sharply. There was shock and disbelief on his face.There was a ball of fresh blood floating on top of the table in his room. There was a light green tint in that sphere of blood and it glowed in an incredibly strange manner. It was the refined blood that Wu Sen forced out of Bei Ling\u2019s entire body when he tapped Bei Ling\u2019s glabella.He was momentarily stunned. Bei Ling immediately turned and looked behind him. There was only darkness and it was incredibly quiet around him. His heart pounded against his chest. After a moment of silence, he went straight into his room and as he stared at the ball of familiar fresh blood on the table. His emotions were unstable.\u2018Who\u2026 was that..? Why did he help me..?\u2019After a long while, Bei Ling grabbed the ball of fresh blood. The moment he touched the blood, it melted into his body and turned into a wave of heat. Bei Ling to quickly sit down with his legs crossed and circulate the blood in his veins.At the same time, in another room within Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings, Su Ming sat with his legs crossed on the floor. His face was pale and there was a trickle of fresh blood at the corner of his lips.However his eyes were incredibly bright. He lowered his head and looked at the ball of dark green blood in his palm and smiled coldly.\u2018So this is the prodigy of Wind Stream Tribe! No one is allowed to surpass him. He is the only one allowed to surpass others! He\u2019s not that great. If I can complete the third burning of my blood along with this spear, even if I can\u2019t kill him, I can still heavily injure him!\u2019Su Ming lifted one of his hands and wiped away the blood at the corner of his lips. A fierce look flashed briefly in his eyes.\u2018I was only lightly injured. I\u2019ll be able to recover if I circulate my Qi. But that Berserker\u2019s Method he adopted is incredibly strange.\u2019The image of the burning corpses and green fire surfaced in Su Ming\u2019s head.\u2018If I can, I\u2019d like to meet the \u2018prodigies\u2019! But seeing how crazy Wu Sen was in the tunnel, this item must be incredibly important to him!\u2019Su Ming looked at the dark green blood in his hands and placed it into a small bottle. After a moment of thought, he raised his hand and grabbed the air. A sliver of moonlight appeared from nowhere and surrounded the small bottle. Then it disappeared.Once he placed the small bottle in his bosom, Su Ming closed his eyes and circulated the Qi in his body as he waited for morning to arrive.Time passed by and very soon, the sky was no longer dark. As it turned brighter, morning arrived!This morning would be different from other mornings because it was the day Wind Stream Tribe held the test that all tribes in the area would partake once every few years!Besides testing the young Berserkers, it was also a chance for all tribes to show their strength and for their future hopes to display stunning talent. This also decided Wind Stream Tribe\u2019s outlook towards the tribes in the future.When morning arrived, Lei Chen, Wu La and Bei Ling followed the guide from Wind Stream Tribe along with the elder, Head of the Guards and Shan Hen as they left their lodgings.Su Ming stood outside the house and watched them leave. He looked at Lei Chen waving at him with a confident look. He looked at Wu La, who had a faint look of disdain on her calm face. He looked at the Bei Ling, who was silent. His face had returned a normal healthy shade of color but he still refused to look at him.There was also the elder, who was smiling sophisticatedly and nodding at him. The Head of the Guards on the other hand, was looking at him with a regretful expression. Then finally, Su Ming looked at the silent Shan Hen, who had a strange glow in his narrowed eyes. His gaze landed briefly on him.Su Ming still stood at his place even after they slowly disappeared from his sight. However, his body and face started changing. After a moment, Su Ming had changed into a bulky looking man. His skin was slightly dark and he exuded a tough presence. He looked no different from a normal member of the Berserker Tribe.The disguise Su Ming wore this time was different from the one he adopted the previous night. The straw hat the elder had placed within his body was truly amazing. He could change his appearance at will.There was no shred of anxiety within Su Ming as he stood there. Instead, he looked at the sky and waited calmly. He knew that it was an important day for him and it was equally important to the elder.On this day, Su Ming would either display shocking results or\u2026 fall into the depths of despair.Su Ming was unsure if there was a force that controlled people\u2019s destinies. He looked at the sky. It was very blue and he could not see the end of it.\u2018Among all those living on the land, who would be able to see the end of the horizon?\u2019It was one of the opening lines in the beast skin scroll. When Su Ming first read it, he had been touched but also puzzled.\u2018People always speak of heaven and earth but, what is heaven and earth? It means all that is under the sky! If the heavens had a soul, it would be an oppressive one! It is oppressing us, the members of the Berserker Tribe and it wants us to humiliate ourselves\u2026\u2019These words surfaced in Su Ming\u2019s head.Sometimes, he would think that the heavens truly possessed a soul but its soul was too cold. If it was not cold, why would there be prodigies and blessed people? Why would there be common people? Why would there be people like the elder, who had unequaled talent yet whose presence dimmed and hair covered in white with time? And what about people like the man in purple, who could climb above all others and reach the Awakening Realm?!There was Bei Ling\u2019s complicated feelings and then there was Wu Sen, who stole other people\u2019s powers\u2026\u2018The oppression of the heavens is invisible. We can only endure it and while we endure it, we must learn to live with it happily\u2026 If we do not, are we to fight against heaven?\u2019This was the last paragraph written in the prologue of the beast skin scroll.Su Ming never understood it. Even now, he only understood the gist of it. He had asked the elder before and the elder\u2019s answer still remained fresh in his mind.\u201cThis is something very simple but also very complex. Simply put, it means that the heavens oppress us, the Berserker Tribe. Either we choose to bear with it happily or we fight against heaven\u2026 But the last phrase was written in the form of a question.\u201d\u201cTo my understanding, perhaps this question meant that besides going up against heaven, could there be any other way to fight against destiny\u2026 Once you grow up, perhaps you\u2019ll have a deeper understanding of it. If that day truly comes and you have attained the power which allows you to do as the words say, then perhaps you can think of a third way to fight instead of submitting to destiny or rebelling against it.\u201d\u201cAfter all, the last place I went to was where I obtained this beast skin scroll. It was also the biggest holy land of the Berserker Tribe I\u2019ve ever seen!\u201d\u201cThat place is the Great Yu\u2026 The owner of this beast skin scroll is the Court Diviner of Great Yu\u2026\u201dSu Ming was quiet as he continued watching the blue sky. After a long while, he heard footsteps approaching from afar. A person slowly walked towards him. Su Ming turned his gaze away from the sky and looked towards the person.The person wore a white robe and had white hair. His face was burdened by the hardships of life but due to that, there was also wisdom in his demeanor. It was Shi Hai!Shi Hai looked at Su Ming, at the unfamiliar face before him. He did not understand why the Elder, Jing Nan gave him the task to come to this place and bring the person to join the test in secret.\u201cFollow me.\u201d Shi Hai did not find anything strange about Su Ming. After he finished speaking, he turned around and left.Su Ming\u2019s demeanor was calm as he followed him.The moment he went out of the door, he saw Shi Hai swinging his sleeve. Immediately, mist spread from his body and surrounded Su Ming. Su Ming\u2019s heart jumped but he did not retreat. He let the mist surround and carry him into the air with Shi Hai. They turned into a rainbow of mist and sped into the distance.This was the second time Su Ming looked at the land from the sky. He still felt a little nervous but Shi Hai ignored his anxiety. Instead, he increased his speed. Before long, he brought Su Ming away from Wind Stream Tribe and traveled towards a gigantic plain located at the north.Su Ming looked at the huge plains ahead of them. From the sky, it looked as if it was an endless sea of land but as all the mist gathered towards them at lightning speed, Su Ming felt his body lurch after a moment. It felt like his body had hit an invisible barrier. The moment they went through it, everything started twisting like the ripples on the surface of water. Then he heard Shi Hai\u2019s cold voice by his ears.\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived!\u201dThe plains were no longer there. There was a mountain right before them!Su Ming had never seen such a big mountain in his life! It was much bigger and taller than Dark Mountain. If they were placed side by side, Dark Mountain would be like a baby and this mountain would be a sturdy, full-grown man!It looked as if it had already penetrated the clouds. The summit could not be seen and only half of the mountain was in view. The rest of the mountain was covered by numerous white clouds.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe size of the mountain was incredible!Su Ming could see numerous stairs on the mountain leading upwards until they disappeared into the clouds.There was a large field in the shape of a circle at the foot of the mountain. There were nine gigantic bird statues placed all around the field. Each of the statues exuded a presence of ancient savagery that made them look especially vicious.At that moment, there were hundreds of people on the gigantic field. They were all spread out and talking amongst themselves.Su Ming\u2019s arrival immediately attracted the attention of all the people on the field. However after they glanced at him, they averted their gazes and continued talking with each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Most of the members of the Berserker Tribe were from Wind Stream Tribe. Su Ming had left after the elder and the rest but arrived quicker than them.Once Shi Hai placed Su Ming down, he gave him a black plate. He did not say anything and left in a cloud of white mist.Su Ming stood there alone and surveyed his surroundings. Not a single familiar face was in sight. He had no choice but to remain silent. He lowered his head and looked at the black plate in his hands. There was a number on it written in the language of the Berserker Tribe. It was 109.The black plate looked normal. It was made of stone but when he held it in his hand, it felt cold.\u201cI heard that the amount of people taking the test this time is the largest in history. There\u2019re more than 100 people taking the test!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s more than 100 people now. This is just the first stage. I\u2019m certain there won\u2019t be so many people taking the tests for the second and third stage. After all, if they don\u2019t have enough strength to handle it, there\u2019s no need for them to be there to humiliate themselves.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong on that account. There are three stages in the test and the first stage is the hardest! The second stage is about power and speed whereas the third stage is a test in actual combat. These two stages require a certain amount of power and it also involves luck. This is something that has been proven in the past. The first stage may not seem to require any sort of power but in reality, this stage is a test of stamina and potential!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way to cheat in this and it\u2019s really brutal! No matter how much power you have, once your results in the first stage aren\u2019t good, it just means that you don\u2019t have enough stamina and potential. The tribe won\u2019t pay much attention to these tribe members after that.\u201dSu Ming lowered his head and toyed with the black stone plate as voices of discussion from the people around him traveled into his ears.\u201cBut still, in every single test that was ever held, the top 50 people mostly consisted of us, Berserkers from Wind Stream Tribe. The other tribes only barely made it in. It\u2019s especially so for the top 10 places. I heard that there has never been an outsider who made it in.\u201d\u201cObviously, it\u2019ll be the same this time. Honestly, those who will place in the top 10 and top 40 will be the same people, especially the top 10. Besides those monsters in the tribe, no one else will be able to make it.\u201dSu Ming listened and gradually heard similar discussions on the same topic. Not all of the people gathered here were going to take the first stage of the test. Most of them were only here to watch.As he listened, he thought about the six numbers the elder told him. Suddenly, Su Ming lifted his head towards his side as he felt something. There was an elderly person approaching him quietly. When he saw Su Ming looking at him, the elderly man quickly smiled at him and closed the distance between them in a few brisk steps.The old man wore beast skins and bone earrings. Judging from his attire, he should have been from Wind Stream Tribe.\u201cLad, I am Bei Qiong. I saw a stone plate in your hands. You must be entering the first stage of the test. That\u2019s why I decided to come and talk to you. I have no ill-will, promise.\u201d The old man looked hilarious. He had a sharp mouth and cheeks that resembled a monkey. When he smiled, his entire face seemed to move, leaving a deep impression on other people.Su Ming\u2019s demeanor remained the same. Once he heard the old man\u2019s words, he nodded.\u201cLad, I\u2019ll say this straight. Don\u2019t mind me. The level of my training may not be high but I\u2019ve lived a long time. If anything, I\u2019ve got a pair of good eyes. I see your potential\u2026 and well\u2026 you\u2019re very normal.\u201d The old man winked.\u201cThis test only happens once every few years. I\u2019ve always come here to watch. With your potential, it\u2019ll be difficult for you to get into the top 50. Based on my experience, you\u2019ll only get into the top 100\u2026 but\u2026\u201d The old man took a few steps towards him with a mysterious look. He looked around to check whether there was anyone looking at them. Then, he quickly spoke in a low tone.\u201cBut you\u2019re in luck since you have met me, lad. I have an herb here that allows a person to bring out his full potential for a short period of time. Entering the first stage with this, you can get a place in the top 50 ranks! If you buy more of these and eat them at once, entering the top 10 ranks is not impossible,\u201d the old man spoke in a low tone. He opened his shirt slightly, quickly revealing some of the herbs he had within before covering it up again. The mysterious air around him became stronger. He seemed afraid that the herbs would be discovered by too many people.Su Ming was momentarily stunned. He looked at the old man and found himself speechless.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me?\u201d The old man saw Su Ming\u2019s expression and immediately spoke in a low tone once again. \u201cLad, you\u2019re still too young. You can only determine the authenticity of these things after you\u2019ve tried them. Once your placing increases, the treatment towards you in your tribe will be completely different. Looking at you, it seems like you aren\u2019t treated well in your tribe.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. If that herb of yours is really that effective, why is it that the top 50 places in the test mostly consisted of Wind Stream Tribe members in the past? No outsider has ever made it into the top 10 ranks either. I won\u2019t buy it. Go and sell it to other people.\u201d Su Ming frowned and retreated a few steps.The old man widened his eyes and gave a thumbs up to Su Ming with his right hand, praising him.\u201cYou\u2019re good, lad. You\u2019re really good! Great of you to think of this so soon. Looks like I\u2019ve been wrong. You may not have a lot of potential but at least you have a smart head on your shoulders.\u201d\u201cBut lad, you\u2019re wrong on this account. It\u2019s not that there have never been any outsiders who made it into the top 10 in the first stage. Fifty years ago, there was one person who managed to continuously get first place. Surely, you have heard of this person before \u2013 Mo Sang, the Elder of Dark Mountain Tribe! Do you know how he made it? He bought a lot of these herbs from me that year.\u201d\u201cThere was also someone from Black Mountain Tribe. He too bought my herbs and got a place in the top 40. Then, there was also someone from Dark Dragon Tribe. She also did the same.\u201d\u201cHey, don\u2019t go. I\u2019ll give you a recent example. In the previous test, there was a lad called Bei Ling who got into the top 50, who bought\u2026\u201d The old man was like a chatterbox who would not stop talking. Su Ming frowned and took a few more steps back.\u201cLad, we were fated to meet each other. That\u2019s why I\u2019m selling this to you. If it were anyone else, I would not be selling it to them. I sell this herb to others for 10 stone coins each. I\u2019ll sell this to you for three stone coins. How about it? Three stone coins is extremely cheap. Hey, if I shout out loud that I\u2019m selling this herb for such a cheap price, there will definitely be a lot of people who will surround me to buy it. Since fate has allowed us to meet each other, if you buy one, I\u2019ll give you another for free, I\u2026\u201d The old man kept talking and as he spoke, his spit flew out of his mouth. Moreover when he spoke, he even clapped his hands together, getting more excited by his own pitch. Su Ming was stupefied. He instinctively took another few steps back.The old man was about to continue when suddenly, there was a commotion in the field. The sky started twisting and a giant dark python entered. There were several people standing on the python \u2013 the elder and the others.\u201cIt\u2019s the people from Dark Mountain Tribe!\u201d\u201cI heard that the Elder of Dark Mountain Tribe is extremely powerful but there is no one in the tribe who can inherit his position. I heard that as of late, there\u2019s been a youngster called Bei Ling who got the 49th place in the previous test though.\u201dThe dark python disappeared. The elder and the others descended upon one corner of the field. He stole a glance at Su Ming from afar and averted his gaze. Bei Ling stood over there, carrying himself in an aloof manner. His face was cold.Lei Chen and Wu La looked around with small hints of excitement.\u201cDo you see that old man and the cold-looking boy by his side? They\u2019re Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s Elder, Mo Sang and Bei Ling.\u201d The old man standing beside Su Ming quickly spoke up. His face was still schooled to express mystery.As he spoke, there was uproar once again and it was much louder this time. The space outside the field before them started twisting and five people sauntered in. The individual who led the team was a bald young man wearing a black robe. It was Wu Sen. His face was dark, showing small signs of anger. It was obvious that the incident on the previous night was a great humiliation to him, especially the loss of his dark green blood. It made him anxious but he did not reveal any of his anxiety.The four people behind him were also silent as they followed Wu Sen into the field.\u201cWu Sen!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s one of the people from Wind Stream Tribe who\u2019ll definitely get into a spot in the top three. I heard that the Berserker\u2019s Method he\u2019s training with is really strange\u2026\u201d\u201cQuiet. His mood changes at the drop of a hat\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d As Wu Sen walked, he suddenly growled. His surroundings fell into silence instantly. Wu Sen\u2019s face was dark as he walked past Su Ming. The moment he walked past, he turned around and looked at Su Ming coldly. There was a hint of uncertainty in his eyes.Still, after he scrutinized Su Ming closely, he found that the person before him was not the person he met the night before. He snorted and walked past him, sitting down cross-legged at a distant spot after that. The four people with him surrounded him to protect him.Su Ming looked at Wu Sen and then at Bei Ling, who was standing in the distance before he shifted his gaze.\u201cWu Sen trains in the Devourer of Corpse Blood. He worshiped an evil statue of the God of Berserkers in Wind Stream Tribe. He\u2019s a fierce one and he\u2019s always in a bad mood. He\u2019s not the good sort!\u201d The old man standing beside Su Ming whispered softly as if he was angry but also afraid that Wu Sen could hear him. Judging from his looks, he had failed in his attempt to sell the herbs to Wu Sen and probably even suffered because of it.\u201cLad, don\u2019t bother that person\u2026 But if you end up bothering him\u2026 well, it\u2019s fine. I have another type of herb with me. If you eat it, you\u2019ll get stronger physically for the rest of your life\u2026\u201d The old man looked back and tried to persuade Su Ming again.Su Ming frowned, thinking that the old man was far more talkative than Lei Chen. In fact, Lei Chen was considered quiet compared to him.The old man continued trying to persuade him. It seemed like he was not going to let Su Ming off unless he bought his herbs.At that moment, the space outside the field twisted once more. This time, dozens of people arrived. These people were talking and laughing amongst themselves. They stood in a protective formation around the person in the center similar to how stars would surround the moon. The person was not tall and was slightly plump. He was laughing and talking to the people beside him while waving his hands around as though he was gesturing something.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe had a vague presence which stood out among the dozens of people. Everyone focused their gazes on him the moment they saw him.\u201cChen Chong!\u201d Wu Sen, who was sitting cross-legged opened his eyes and stared at the slightly plump person. He narrowed his eyes.Su Ming\u2019s gaze also landed on the person. He could feel a faint presence but it was not Qi. It was something else he found hard to describe.\u201cChen Chong is a lad everyone knows in Wind Stream Tribe. He\u2019s a good lad, much better than Wu Sen,\u201d the old man quickly whispered.\u201cDon\u2019t tell the others about this but Chen Chong is a huge customer of mine. He always comes to buy herbs from me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These people either came with their tribes, or alone.Gradually, the amount of people in the field increased. The place bustled with activity as the people talked among themselves.After all, the grand ceremony was only held once every few years. The number of people joining the test this year was also much higher compared to the previous years.Su Ming used the chance when there were a lot of people around to take a few quick steps forward to avoid the old man who kept bothering him. The old man\u2019s constant chattering was giving Su Ming a headache. Once he avoided him, he saw \u2013 from between the gaps formed by the people \u2013 the old man looking around the crowd for him. Su Ming quickly lowered his body, not wanting to be spotted.There may be a lot of people gathered in the field, but Su Ming did not recognize most of them. His appearance was also very normal among the crowd so no one paid any attention to him.In truth, Su Ming was not the only who was trying to be unassuming. There were quite a large number of examinees who were not from Wind Stream Tribe entering the test for the first time.\u201cLook, that\u2019s Wu Sen! I heard that he\u2019s one of the prodigies from Wind Stream Tribe.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that Chen Chong? His name is like thunder. I heard of him before, but I didn\u2019t expect him to look like that. He really does have quite the presence, though.\u201d\u201cDid you see Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s Bei Ling? I heard that he\u2019s also an extraordinary one. He got a place within the top 50 in the previous test. If we can befriend him, it\u2019ll be good for us. There\u2019ll be a lot of people who will be jealous of us when we return to the tribe later as well.\u201dThe ones besides Su Ming did not seem like first timers. They were whispering to each other while their faces were filled with admiration.\u201cThis might be our chance. If we can catch either Wu Sen or Chen Chong\u2019s eyes and stay by their side, then our position in the tribe will surely be different.\u201d\u201cHa. There\u2019re plenty of those who have the same thoughts. Can\u2019t you tell that there\u2019re a lot of people who want to approach them to talk? Why don\u2019t we try it as well? Hey, you, I see that you\u2019re alone. This must be your first time, right?\u201d an honest looking young man by Su Ming\u2019s side smiled and said to him.Su Ming\u2019s lips curled up into a polite smile, and he nodded at the young man.\u201cBrother, not everyone has arrived yet, but it looks like the first stage of the test is about to begin. Why don\u2019t we go to Chen Chong and try talking to him? How about you all? Let\u2019s go together. If we go alone, he might ignore us,\u201d the young man quickly spoke as he tried persuading Su Ming and the people around him.\u201cLook at Wu Sen, his face is like thunder. I\u2019m pretty sure his mood his terrible. We shouldn\u2019t go and bother him. That Chen Chong looks like a straightforward person, he should be easier to approach.\u201d Some of the people around him were swayed by the young man\u2019s words and he managed to gather about seven to eight people to go towards Chen Chong.Su Ming did not want to go, but he was dragged along by that enthusiastic young man, so he had no choice but to follow the crowd.Just as they were moving forward, the space outside the field twisted once again, attracting everyone\u2019s attention. As the space twisted, five people appeared. The person who led the team was a man in his forties. The man wore a sackcloth and looked incredibly strong. There was a shocking presence of Qi surrounding his body.There was a clear scar on his face that stretched from his left brow diagonally until it reached the right corner of his lips, causing him to look extremely ferocious and terrifying.\u201cIt\u2019s Black Mountain Tribe. That person\u2026 Could it be Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s tribe leader? I heard that there\u2019s a terrifying scar on Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s tribe leader\u2019s face, so it must be him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. I heard that the Elder from Black Mountain Tribe is absent this time. Their tribe leader is leading the team.\u201dThere were four people behind the man. They slowly walked into the field. At first glance, the four people seemed normal, but if someone looked closely, then they would easily find that among the four three were young men about the same age, while the last one was a sturdy-looking man in his forties.Strangely, the man and the other two youths following behind the tribe leader were surrounding one of the young men like they were his subordinates. They even instinctively did not surpass the young man as they walked.That young man was about 18 to 19-years-old. He wore a black hide shirt and had long hair. His face could not be clearly seen because the collar of his black shirt was pulled up to cover his entire face besides his eyes. He also had his head lowered, thus preventing anyone from seeing his face clearly.That young man was silent. He ignored the gazes that fell upon him and walked towards the crowd with his tribe leader. They sat down cross-legged at a corner far away from Dark Mountain Tribe.It could also be seen by how he sat down that the young man was different. He sat alone, not mixing with the other members of his tribe. Nonetheless, once he sat down, he lifted his head slightly and looked towards Dark Mountain Tribe. Disdain appeared briefly in his eyes.Su Ming\u2019s eyes also fell upon the people from Black Mountain Tribe, just like the others\u2019. He paid special attention towards their tribe leader and the unsociable young man.Su Ming was not surprised by the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s power, but that unsociable young man made him feel a faint sense of danger. He could almost be certain that this person was extraordinary.But in his heart, he hated this sort of behavior, of pretending to be much more intelligent and powerful than other people. Compared to him, Su Ming even felt that Wu Sen was much better than that person. At the very least, Wu Sen did not pretend to be mysterious.Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s arrival did not incite much discussion. Compared to them, the people were much more interested in the prodigies of Wind Stream Tribe. After all, the reputations of these people were very impressive around the region.Su Ming went with the crowd to Chen Chong under the very enthusiastic young man\u2019s persuasion. He did not stand out as he stood among so many people. No one would notice him because he looked so normal.\u201cI\u2019m telling you all, I never go to those places in the tribe, and even if I went, I only go there to watch the fun. Don\u2019t you believe me?\u201dAs he got nearer, Su Ming saw Chen Chong gesturing with his hands and talking with the people around him, eliciting laughter from them. But it was clear that most of the laughter was just to humor him.There were even some laughing instinctively because they wanted to become friends with Chen Chong. It was as if they wanted to use laughter to fit into the group.The young man and the rest of the people besides Su Ming were doing just that. They were laughing non-stop. Su Ming stood there and smiled. He felt calm. He looked at Chen Chong, who was surrounded by all these people, and knew that Chen Chong\u2019s status was very high, and it was something he could not compare.He looked at the people beside him, who were laughing in order to try to join the group. They even used the chance to introduce themselves. They may not look as if they were trying to flatter Chen Chong, but no matter who it was, it was clear that they wanted to get closer to Chen Chong.Dark Dragon Tribe walked into the field at that moment. When the tribe appeared, they did not incite much discussion. After all, Dark Dragon Tribe was really small. They could not even compare with Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s fame.But the moment Dark Dragon Tribe appeared, all the people, even Chen Chong, who had been talking and laughing, and Wu Sen, who had been meditating and fuming, lifted their heads and looked towards them.The young man in black from Black Mountain Tribe, who was pretending to be mysterious by covering half of his face, also looked in their direction.They were looking at a girl in white with unparalleled beauty walking among Dark Dragon Tribe! There was a fragment decorating the center of her brows glowing brightly as it reflected the light from the sun. There was a certain wildness to her beauty that made hearts race as people looked at her.She was Bai Ling.Bai Ling blushed slightly because she was under so many people\u2019s scrutiny but did not lower her head. Instead, she swept her gaze quickly among the crowd. Once she found Dark Mountain Tribe, happiness appeared on her face, but once she looked carefully, the happiness disappeared. She did not find Su Ming.Bai Ling lowered her head and followed behind the Elder of Dark Dragon Tribe towards the field. She did not notice a normal looking teenager watching her quietly from among the crowd in the distance. She also did not notice the looks of desire and greed from the young man in black from Black Mountain Tribe, who was pretending to be mysterious, once he saw her.Wu Sen only looked at Bai Ling for a moment before closing his eyes again. Bai Ling may be unparalleled in beauty, but he was completely unmoved. At the moment, he was feeling anxious, and he couldn\u2019t spare another thought for anything else.Su Ming looked at that beautiful face and stood quietly where he was. He suddenly felt that the distance between him and Bai Ling was incredibly large\u2026\u201cBai Ling!\u201d A voice that suggested that the speaker was smiling spoke up from where Su Ming was. The voice was not loud, but it spread around the area and travelled to Bai Ling\u2019s ears.\u201cBrother Chen Chong.\u201d Bai Ling lifted her head and saw Chen Chong walking towards her from the crowd. There was a smile on her face, but there was also sadness hidden underneath that smile.Chen Chong laughed loudly. The people in front of him immediately retreated. Su Ming stood there and did not move. He looked at Chen Chong walking by him towards Bai Ling.As he watched, Su Ming closed his eyes. He did not know what he should be feeling at the moment. There was only calmness within him.When he closed his eyes, it was as if he ignored everything around him until someone snapped him out by grabbing his arm and swinging it excitedly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYe Wang! It\u2019s Ye Wang!\u201d\u201cLook, that\u2019s Ye Wang, the most powerful person among the younger generation in Wind Stream Tribe! Ye Wang!He is the Ye Wang who won 1st place in all three stages of the test for two consecutive times! That person has incredible talent and he\u2019s the strongest of the younger generation around the region! I heard that he has the highest hopes for reaching Awakening Realm among the younger generation! He\u2019s also currently being trained by the entire Wind Stream Tribe! He\u2019s the future Elder of Wind Stream Tribe!\u201dSu Ming opened his eyes and saw a person walking towards the field from a distance.That person was wearing a red shirt. He did not have Wu Sen\u2019s sullenness, Chen Chong\u2019s popularity, nor the fake mysteriousness from the young man in black from Black Mountain Tribe. He was alone, and he walked by his lonesome self towards the field.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His physique was not very powerful either, but as he walked into the field, he aroused a feeling that was difficult to describe among those who were looking at him.Ye Wang\u2019s black hair swayed on his shoulders as he walked slowly towards them.He did not have Wu Sen\u2019s sullenness, but the calmness within his eyes made others terrified of him, even more than they were of Wu Sen. Neither did he have Chen Chong\u2019s charisma to attract people to his side, yet though he was alone, he had a presence that far surpassed other people so much that it created pressure.Similarly, he did not try to pretend to be mysterious, unlike the young man from Black Mountain Tribe, but as he walked towards the field, his power and his name brought about a sense of mystery that far surpassed that from the young man in black.He was mysterious because he was Ye Wang. He was the best among the younger generation in Wind Stream Tribe. He was the most brilliant existence around the region. He was the one that was revered to as the future powerful Berserker of the Awakening realm!He walked towards them calmly like a king. He did not need to talk to anyone. There would be countless people who would ignore Wu Sen and Chen Chong while they bowed down their heads before him and cleared the path for him.There were no longer sounds of discussion, either. Once he appeared, all sounds abruptly disappeared. The silence continued even when he reached the center of the field and sat down cross-legged.After a long while, faint sounds of discussion begun to arise.\u201cHey, you saw that big shot, right? We\u2019re lucky to see Ye Wang coming here, at least our trip wasn\u2019t wasted,\u201d the honest-looking young man beside Su Ming whispered softly as his eyes were filled with admiration and satisfaction.Su Ming fell silent. After a while, he nodded his head lightly.There were still some people who arrived after Ye Wang. In an hour, all participants of the test arrived, and when they did, the sky suddenly darkened.As the clouds rolled forward, thunder roared and shook the area, making most of the people who heard the sound tremble. As they lifted their heads, they saw the clouds in the sky gathering together from all around at lightning speed. In the span of a breath, they had already fused together and turned into a gigantic man of clouds that was so tall its head could touch the sky!On the head of the cloud giant sat a man in purple with his legs crossed. That person was the Elder of Wind Stream Tribe \u2013 Jing Nan!He sat there cross-legged and did not look downwards. Instead, he was looking at the tall mountain located not too far away. That was the mountain that reached the clouds, and only half of which was visible to the eye!\u201cThis mountain is the most important treasure of Wind Stream Tribe. There is none other like it!\u201cIt was passed down to us by the Ancients. It is the origin of Wind Stream Tribe. Without this mountain, then perhaps there would be no Wind Stream Tribe! The mountain you\u2019re seeing is not complete. That is only the peak of the mountain\u2026 The peak of the real Wind Stream Mountain!\u201cThere is a mysterious beast sealed at the top of the mountain. That beast has been sleeping for millions of years and has never woken up\u2026 Perhaps it will never wake up\u2026 This mountain has a pressuring might that surrounds the entire mountain and its surroundings. The higher you climb, the more pressure you will feel!\u201cThere are paths up the mountain. There are 281 stairways leading straight to the peak of the mountain. This is the 1st stage of the test!\u201cThe same rules from the previous tests apply. You have no time limit. All of you who are taking part in the 1st stage of the test and are holding onto the plate can find any route you want leading up to the mountain. We will determine your rank based on how many steps you managed to take at the end.\u201cThere are a lot of you here who are taking this test for the first time. For fairness\u2019 sake I will tell you this. The pressure on this mountain is the strongest during midnight!\u201cNow, I will break the seal on this mountain. After that, you must go in quickly!\u201d As Jing Nan spoke on top of the giant made of clouds, he lifted his right hand and waved at the towering mountain.Once he brought his hand down, the giant made of clouds immediately lifted its head and let out a shocking roar. It took huge steps and moved quickly towards the peak of the mountain. It lifted its two gigantic arms and tore at the space before the mountain as if it was trying to tear apart heaven and earth.Once it did so, heaven and earth roared. A giant crack appeared out of nowhere. The crack was horizontal, and it opened up vertically between heaven and earth. It was as if there was an invisible screen before the peak of the mountain, and it was now being torn apart, revealing the true view of the mountain within.It was still a tall mountain, but it was no longer the mountain Su Ming saw before. The top of the mountain was covered by black mist that was rolling up towards the sky. The black mist looked gloomy and let off a presence that made hearts pound in terror.At the same time, there was also a pressuring might that was nigh indescribable spreading out from within the cracks. It was like a typhoon blowing towards them from the sides. It lifted many people\u2019s hair, some even turned pale because of it and instinctively retreated a few steps. It was as if it was not a mountain within the crack, but a colossal mysterious beast that reached heaven and earth.The moment the crack was torn open, multiple faint silhouettes of people quickly manifested beside the cloud giant and turned into eight people!Shi Hai was one of those eight people. Each of them had shocking power, and at that moment, they bit through their tongues and each coughed out a mouthful of blood. Their blood mixed together and formed a complex looking mark that glowed red. It sped towards the crack as if to imprint itself on the mist mountain within the crack.The mountain, surrounded by mist and clouds, roared the moment the mark touched it. The mist rolled upwards and revealed multiple ancient stairways that had endured through time.\u201cOnce you enter the mountain, if your plates leave you for even a second, it will disappear. You will also lose your qualification to take the exam and will be automatically transported out of the mountain. This is the only way for you to give up once you find that you cannot handle the pressure of the mountain. The plate will also record the amount of steps you have taken and will accordingly show the numbers to all those spectating.\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you going in?\u201d The person who shouted towards the crowd gathered below him was Shi Hai, who was standing among the eight people.A person suddenly turned into a rainbow and sped towards the crack. That person was the young man who wore a red shirt, Ye Wang! Wu Sen was the second who rushed towards the crack, followed closely by Chen Chong. Gradually, a huge amount of people from all tribes taking the first stage of the test rushed towards the crack.Bei Ling, Lei Chen, Wu La, Si Kong, and even Bai Ling were among the crowd going towards the crack. Once they entered the crack, they went to a stairway that was not taken by anyone and disappeared within it.Once a stairway was taken by someone, a layer of mist would fall down and cover the path from view.Su Ming did not choose to move alone. He chose to move with a huge crowd and walked into the crack. The moment he stepped in, he immediately felt the difference between the place and the world outside. There was a pressure there that felt as if an invisible pair of hands was pressing on his body, causing him discomfort.Many of the paths leading to the stairways were already covered by mist\u2014a clear sign that someone had already taken the path. Su Ming did not worry, but instead ran further away from the entrance. There were plenty of people that were like him, searching for a way into the mountain.However, the shape of the foot of the mountain was uneven. Some of the paths leading to the stairs seemed to be shorter. These paths were usually fought over by people, and whoever took the first step on the stairway would lay claim to it.Su Ming did not join them but went to a place that was further away. There were multiple paths there. He stood at the crossroads and fell into deep thought for a while. Just as he was about to move, he suddenly turned his head and looked to his right. As he did so, his pupils shrank, though it was barely noticeable.He saw the young man wearing black beast skins from Black Mountain Tribe, who loved pretending to be mysterious, walking towards him with his face still covered. He did not even look at Su Ming as he walked towards one of the paths.For a moment, Su Ming watched as mist rolled down from the mountain and covered the path that was taken by the person, then he looked away. He walked towards a normal looking stairway. The moment he took the first step, he felt as if the entire mountain trembled. At the same time, a wave of heat spread from the plate hanging over his chest, but it did not spread into Su Ming\u2019s body, it just kept giving off heat.Soon, he was surrounded by a large amount of mist. He could not see what was by his side, neither could he see what was behind him. The only thing he could see was the faint outline of a winding staircase in the mist before him and the dim sun hanging above him in the sky.It was quiet. That silence even gave him the impression that he was the only one on the mountain.Su Ming took a deep breath. He did not move immediately but chose to feel the pressure of the land. Once he was slightly used to it, he moved forwards step by step with resolution and persistence in his eyes.He did not know that the moment all of them went in, the crack gradually closed up. Shi Hai and the other seven people all sat down cross-legged at various corners in the field once they descended from the sky.The Elder of Wind Stream Tribe, Jing Nan, also made the cloud giant disappear and descended upon the field. He went to Mo Sang\u2019s side and an invisible wave of air surrounded them, which prevented anyone from eavesdropping on them.There were still hundreds of people on the field, and their gazes were all focused on the nine gigantic eagle statues around them.Lines of words gradually appeared on the nine statues.1st place: Ye Wang, 97 steps.2nd place: Wu Sen, 51 steps.3rd place: Chen Chong, 47 steps.4th place: Bi Su, 46 steps.\u2026103rd place: Mo Su, 6 steps.The steps taken by all the people taking the first test were clearly displayed for all to see due to the plates they had in hand.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI knew it. The 1st place is Ye Wang. 97 steps, he has such a huge margin over the 2nd place\u2026 Look, it changed again! 115 steps! Didn\u2019t the test just start? That\u2019s too fast!\u201d\u201cWho is that Bi Su? I\u2019ve never heard of him before. He\u2019s not from Wind Stream Tribe, but he managed to get such a high rank since the start? I heard that during the last test, Ye Wang managed to take 803 steps. I wonder how far he\u2019ll go this time. It\u2019ll be more difficult the further they go. Since the very first test, no one has ever been able to make it past 930 steps!\u201dThe Elder of Wind Stream Tribe, Jing Nan, was also looking at the bird statue by his side with Mo Sang. There was a smile on his face as he glanced at a name called Mo Su.\u201cMo Sang, he should be Su Ming, right? But looking at his rank, it\u2019ll be difficult for him to get into the top 40. How about this? I\u2019ll make the conditions easier, if he can get into the top 60, then he\u2019ll pass.\u201dMo Sang did not speak. He just quietly looked at the name Mo Su on the bird statue. There was a hint of expectation hidden deep within his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At that moment, they were all looking intently at the nine eagle statues. All of the rankings on it were the same. When they looked at it, they began discussing among themselves.Sometimes they would cheer when a person\u2019s name went up the rankings, and at other times they would feel sorry for another person who fell down the rankings.It can even be said that the test within the mountain was secondary in this grand ceremony and that the most important part of the ceremony was in the field. There were a few hundred people in the field, and while most of them were from Wind Stream Tribe, there were still quite a number of them from other tribes. It would be accurate to say that almost all of the tribes in the region were gathered here.They would bring the rankings of the three stages back to their tribes so that everyone would know about it.That was the tradition, and it had been done in previous tests as well.As time passed, Ye Wang, who was in 1st place, had taken his 345th step, and he was gradually slowing down.Chen Chong was behind him. He had already taken his 189th step. As for Wu Sen, who everyone had high expectations for, was in the 9th place for some unknown reason. He had only taken 127 steps.However, the person called Bi Su had brought a lot of attention from the field on himself. He was in the 3rd place, and he had taken 188 steps!\u201cWho is that Bi Su? How can he be so strong? Could this person actually make it to the top of the first stage this time?\u201d\u201cThis is interesting. It has been a long time since any outsider has managed to get into the top 10. Never mind that, no outsider has made it into the top 30 for a long time as well.\u201dAs the people were talking among themselves, the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe was sitting down cross-legged as he stared at the rankings on the eagle statue nearby. There was a prideful smile on his lips. He also swept his gaze to where Black Mountain Tribe was.Shan Hen was seated with his eyes closed at where Dark Mountain Tribe was, seemingly uninterested with the rankings. As for the Head of the Guards, he was frowning as if he was feeling anxious.He looked at the rankings on the eagle statue beside him and found Bei Ling, who was at the 57th place, Lei Chen, who was at the 73rd place, and Wu La, who was at the 91st place.The old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe and the rest of the tribes were also intently staring at the eagle statues. There were not a lot of changes on their faces. As the leaders of the tribes, they had to learn how to conceal their emotions. Unless there was a great change, they would usually not show strong emotions on their faces. As for the Head of the Guards from Dark Mountain Tribe, if it were not for Bei Ling, he would not look anxious.The situation in the hundreds of stairways within the mountain was different from the field, which was filled with hundreds of people discussing and staring at the statues. The people taking the first stage of the test felt as if they were the only ones on the peak of the mountain.Not only did the thick mist cover their sight of each other, even the people outside could not see what was happening inside. Even Jing Nan, the Elder of Wind Stream Tribe, could not see through the mist which was created as a form of seal. He could not tell for sure what was happening inside.Nonetheless, there would not be any danger in this place. After all, the test had been held far too many times.Bai Ling bit down her bottom lip. Sweat beaded on her forehead as she walked forwards. She could not see the end of the stairs. It seemed like there was no end to it, causing the people who were walking on it to fall into the illusion that it was endless. The increasing pressure as they walked further ahead also made them feel as if they were being repelled by the place. It was as if there were a countless number of voices whispering in their ears to give up.Lei Chen was growling nonstop not too far away from Bai Ling. He had even torn away his hide shirt and revealed a strong upper body. There were beads of sweat trickling down his body, making him look ferocious even though he was tired. He kept walking forward, eyes lit with madness and persistence.Further ahead, Bei Ling\u2019s face was pale. He had given too much blood from the centre of his brows to Wu Sen lately. His body was still weak. He would be able to obtain a small drop of Berserker Blood from Wu Sen during the third stage of the test according to their promise, but he was worried. He did not know whether the promise still held.Bei Ling gritted his teeth. He did not want to lose completely, so he walked forward with the pride of Dark Mountain Tribe on his shoulders one step at a time.Compared to their difficulty, the most brilliant prodigy of Wind Stream Tribe, Ye Wang, was much more at ease. He had his hands behind his back as he walked forward one step at a time at an unhurried pace. This was not the first time he walked these steps, but the third!He remembered clearly that he managed to make it to more than 800 steps during his second time. This time, he would make it to 900!\u2018The elder once said that the mountain seemed tall, but there were only 999 steps. The structure had some sort of mysterious power that seemed to change heaven and earth.\u2018The amount of steps you could take reflected how many blood veins you would be able to manifest at the end.\u2019\u201cI have to eat less next time. Ah, I definitely have to eat less next time\u2026\u201dAt another path behind Ye Wang, Chen Chong was panting harshly as he walked forward, mumbling under his breath. He was slightly on the plump side, and as he walked, the flesh on his body seemed to tremble, but there was a sharp glint in his eyes. He looked at the plate in his hands. If he stared at it with the plate in mind, he could see all the rankings in it. He knew that there was a person called Bi Su who was right behind him!Located further away was the young man in black hide skin from Black Mountain Tribe. His face was calm, as if there was no need for him to be serious about walking these stairs yet.\u2018This is the first time I\u2019ve come here. Since I\u2019m here, then Wu Sen, Chen Chong, and even Ye Wang, will have to stand behind me!\u2018This time, I will let everyone know that I, Bi Su, am the best of all the prodigies in the region!\u2019There was a crazed look on the young man\u2019s half-covered face.Compared to these people, Su Ming was far behind them. His footsteps were slow. As of then, he had only taken his 32nd step.In fact, when he was at the 32nd step, Su Ming did not move forward, but lowered his head and fell into deep thought. He stared at the steps underneath his feet, and his eyes began wavering as he fell into his thoughts.\u2018The elder mentioned 6 numbers\u2026 The first number was 32\u2026 Could he have meant the 32nd step on the stairs?\u2019As Su Ming was thinking, he slowly lifted his feet and stepped onto the 33rd step. Once he placed his foot down, he did not feel any different. It was the same amount of pressure he felt at the 32nd step.\u2018There\u2019s nothing strange about it\u2026 It\u2019s the same\u2026\u2019Su Ming frowned, then went to the 34th step. Yet, the moment his right foot landed on it, his body trembled suddenly.\u2018Same\u2026 Same..? No!\u2019 He closed his eyes and felt the slight increase of pressure as his right foot remained on the 34th step.Then he opened his eyes and quickly retreated to the 31st step. He raised his foot and stood on the 32nd step, then on the 33rd. At that moment, Su Ming\u2019s eyes lit up and he took a deep breath.\u2018I see. There is an increase of pressure between the 31st and 33rd step, but only the 32nd step retains the same pressure no matter whether I move forward or backwards. It\u2019s as if\u2026 the 32nd step doesn\u2019t exist. Even if the 32nd step is not around, everything is still the same.\u2019After a moment of thought, Su Ming did not move forward any longer. Instead, he sat down cross-legged at the 32nd step to feel the pressure from both sides as they pressed against his body. It made him feel uncomfortable, but 40 something blood veins manifested on his body.The moment these blood veins appeared, the pressure against Su Ming\u2019s body lessened by a great margin. If he did not pay attention to it, he would not have realized it.\u2018I can feel two sorts of pressure on most of the steps in this mountain. One of them comes from above me, and the other is the residue pressure coming from behind me from the steps I\u2019ve taken\u2026 Only this 32nd step can balance the pressure I feel\u2026 The six numbers the elder told me must mean that there are six similar spots in this mountain!\u2018Perhaps this is what the elder experienced when he took the test in Wind Stream Tribe. It\u2019s his secret\u2026\u2019As Su Ming sat down, he closed his eyes slowly and activated the blood veins in his body. After a moment, Su Ming opened his eyes and frowned.He did not feel that he benefitted from it. Even if he circulated his Qi around his body, he felt normal. There were no changes whatsoever.Su Ming could not figure out the answer in his silence, but he knew that the elder would definitely not tell him the numbers because he felt like it. There must be some sort of secret within the elder\u2019s words that he had yet to discover.Still\u2026 Su Ming scratched his head. The elder had always loved saying these sort of things since he was young to let him think and figure things out on his own. If he understood it, then that was that. If he did not, then the elder would occasionally tell him the answer.After a moment of thought, Su Ming sighed. He looked at the 49 blood veins on his body. With their presence, he could ignore the pressure in this place.\u2018Really, elder..? Can\u2019t you just tell me the answer..? Ah, just what is the secret behind this..?\u2019Su Ming did not want to give up. He continued sitting there as he thought carefully.\u2018Pressure\u2026 the same amount of pressure from both sides\u2026 I could feel the pressure before, but when I sit here, the pressure will make my blood circulate faster, thus my blood veins will appear automatically to fight against the pressure\u2026 this\u2026\u2019Su Ming\u2019s heart suddenly jumped, and a thought flickered through his mind, but he had a feeling that he could not handle it completely.He opened his eyes wide and took in a deep breath as he looked at the 49 blood veins on his body.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018Could the secret behind the elder\u2019s words be actually to tell me how to control the blood veins in my body so that they could all appear at the same time, then disappear one by one..? Then precisely because the pressure in this place is balanced like the world outside, it could turn the impossible possible..?\u2019Su Ming jolted.\u2018The purpose of this is to let me have a much better control over my blood veins. When I swing my fist, I have to control the number of blood veins in my body so that with each punch, I will have just the right amount of power and not waste any of my energy\u2026\u2019Su Ming licked his lips unconsciously and closed his eyes. In his silence, he tried to control the blood veins in his body and let them revert back one at a time.It was difficult!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 55: Fine Control!Translator:\u00a0Mogumoguchan\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0ZenobysIt was very difficult!All things were easier to do when you went along with the tide, but if you went against it, it became difficult! It was the same for the blood veins. They would appear one by one as a person circulated the Qi in his body. It was also possible for all of them to appear at once in an explosive force. That was easy to do.If someone wanted to call back the blood veins one by one, then they would need to control the speed of the Qi in their bodies with extreme precision. Su Ming would have to control his Qi at a fine state to arrive at that level of precision.It was extremely rare for a Berserker at the Blood Solidification Realm to do so. This was in fact, not something for a person still in the Blood Solidification to do. This was a skill for a strong Berserker in the Awakening realm to understand and perform.Su Ming did not know about this. What he knew was that the elder taught him to do it. It was like a riddle, he had to find the solution on his own and find out what he was supposed to do as he thought deeply about it.He did not feel as if he was being forced into it, nor did he feel it was difficult trying to solve the problem. Everything happened naturally. So naturally in fact, that Su Ming felt that he should try it.If he did not, then it would be a waste because he spent so much time thinking about it.Two hours passed by slowly. During those two hours, Su Ming sat with his legs crossed and did not move. As he continued trying to control the circulation of his Qi, a strange change happened to the blood veins on his body. The number of blood veins would suddenly decrease by dozens, then would suddenly return to its full number \u2013 49. As this change continued, it gradually progressed to a steady state.All of this was largely related to the pressure in this place. It could even be said that it was by this external force that a Berserker in the Blood Solidification realm could even perform one of the detailed controls that only a Berserker in the Awakening realm could do.Time passed by, and very soon, it was dusk. The mist in the mountain thickened during dusk. It was quiet, but the situation in the field outside was different from the mountain. It was bustling with activity, and sounds of discussions rang through the air. There were even some who took out stone coins and started placing bets.\u201cAs expected, the 1st is still Ye Wang. Look at him, he has already taken 561 steps! The 2nd is Chen Chong, he\u2019s only at 326 steps!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. I\u2019m paying attention to the 3rd place, Bi Su. This person is definitely the dark horse in this test. I believe everyone thinks the same way. This person, about whom we\u2019ve never heard before, has taken 327 steps! He has been switching back and forth with the 2nd place for the entire afternoon.\u201d\u201cBut I wonder what happened to Wu Sen, he\u2019s only at 12th place\u2026\u201dAt a corner of the field, Mo Sang and Jing Nan sat cross-legged. No one dared to bother them. There was an invisible barrier around them that separated them from the world.\u201cMo Sang, Su Ming has been staying at the 32nd step for the entire afternoon. I think he\u2019s already exhausted. He\u2019s placed last.\u201d Jing Nan frowned slightly, feeling that something was out of place.Mo Sang did not speak but chose to look at the rankings on the eagle statue instead. His face was as calm as usual, but in his heart, he was happy. He knew that Su Ming figured out his riddle.To him, if Su Ming could understand it on his own, it was much more precious than obtaining the Berserker Blood.The sun and moon appeared at the same time during dusk and started changing places with each other. Su Ming\u2019s rank did not bring about anyone\u2019s attention. They would only sweep a glance at him to see who was in the last place.As of then, Su Ming still sat on the 32nd step. He did not seem any different, but if anyone looked closely, then they would see that the number of blood veins on his body was changing rapidly. It would sometimes be 46 blood veins, sometimes 47, and sometimes 48. The change was too rapid, hence if no one paid attention, they would not see it.When the sun was completely hidden and the moon became clearer in the sky, the blood veins on Su Ming\u2019s body changed once again. Gradually, the number of times the blood veins went up to 48 increased from once to twice, to thrice\u2026 until it reached eight times, and nine times!At that moment, Su Ming opened his eyes and a flicker of excitement appeared briefly in his eyes. He made it! It may not be perfect, but he made it!During those ten times, there were nine times where he managed to only make one of the blood veins in his body disappear!Making one blood vein disappear may seem insignificant, but it meant that Su Ming had begun managing to control the circulation of his blood and Qi. His blood was no longer like a wild horse rampaging around, he had managed to put a lasso around it!Slowly, he sat there and gradually reduced the number of blood veins on his blood to 47, 46, 45\u2026 It was not until the 38th blood vein that Su Ming began to lose control, and his Qi began to go into turmoil.Su Ming knew that the balanced pressure on the 32nd step was no longer enough to help him. If he wanted to improve, then he would need to go to the 79th step!Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bright. He stood up without hesitation and stepped onto the 33rd step. He continued moving forward with certainty. As he moved forward one step at a time and the pressure on the mountain pressed onto him, all 49 blood veins from Su Ming\u2019s body appeared suddenly and circulated rapidly in his body. The fine control he gained that afternoon was not just an achievement, he also gained control over his blood veins, causing a muffled boom to resound in Su Ming\u2019s body as the blood veins appeared.As the sound echoed in the air, the 50th blood vein suddenly manifested on his body!The 51st blood vein also appeared once the 50th blood vein manifested itself, and it did not stop there. As Su Ming continued walking up the steps until he reached the 37th, 42nd, 49th, 58th\u2026Once he reached the 60th step within a short amount of time, the 52nd blood vein suddenly manifested on Su Ming\u2019s body!Just one more, and he would reach the fifth level of the Blood Solidification realm! In fact, he could already begin training the Berserker Art \u2013 Dark Blood Dust!The muffled sounds coming from his body may not have echoed too far, but Bi Su, who had taken 300 something steps on the path closest to him, heard it as he was walking. He stopped and turned back to look.\u2018This is the sound of someone surmounting the number of blood veins he currently has\u2026 Just who is it that managed to increase his blood veins in this place..?\u2019He fell into brief thought, but did not pay too much attention to it. He continued walking forward. It may be his first time being in this place, but he already made preparations before he came.Bi Su knew that the pressure in the mountain would increase by several fold at night compared to the day. That was why almost all would choose to stop moving when it was night and the moon was hanging high in the sky. After all, if they continued moving forward, then they would have to pay a much higher price, and it was not worth it.It was much better if they rested for a night and continued the next day. If they did that, they would be in the best possible condition. That was why, he would continue moving forward as much as possible before midnight arrived, and then would have to rest.When the blood veins in Su Ming\u2019s body increased to 52, he continued moving forward. He moved quickly up the stairs towards the peak of the mountain that could not be seen.He did not know that his speed had caused a small commotion in the field outside.The few hundreds of people in the field may only be paying attention to the top 50 rankings in the test, but they would occasionally look at the person called Mo Su who was placed last and mock him in their hearts. To them, the person who stayed an entire afternoon at the 32nd step had already exhausted his strength.But now, when one of the men in the crowd looked at the changes in the top 50 ranks with admiration and stole a glance at the last place unconsciously, he was stunned momentarily, then he widened his eyes. He saw with his own eyes the numbers behind Mo Su\u2019s name, who had been stuck at the last place, suddenly increase.33, 37, 45, 48\u2026 up until 61, 63\u2026 and it continued increasing!He also looked at the rankings and saw that Mo Su had climbed up dozens of ranks from the last place, and his rank continued increasing!Very soon, he was not the only one who noticed the change. Many people noticed it and when they looked over, they were all astonished. From that moment, the interest towards the top 50 ranks was no longer as high as the increase in ranks by the person who was previously in the last place.\u201cThat person called Mo Su has started to rise! Haha! Could it be that he rested for the entire afternoon and just woke up?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s already at 137th place. He climbed up so many ranks from the last place. Is he the type that has sudden explosive power much later into things? Let\u2019s see whether he can make it within 120.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s in! 119th place, 79 steps!\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 why did he stop?\u201d\u201cHe stopped again!\u201d The people who were paying attention to Su Ming\u2019s rank were looking at Mo Su\u2019s name at 119th place. When they saw that there was no longer any change to the number of steps he took, which was 79, they were disappointed.\u201cI thought I\u2019d see another miracle, but it looks like he doesn\u2019t have enough strength. Looks like he\u2019s at his limit at 79 steps. He must have stored up an entire afternoon\u2019s worth of power and let it all out.\u201dGradually, no one in the field paid any more attention to the common looking name. They turned their attention back to the top 50 ranks. Midnight was near. According to tradition, no one would continue climbing the steps at midnight. The ranks at that time would be the final score for the day.At a corner of the field, Mo Sang looked at Su Ming\u2019s name as he rose up in ranks until he finally stopped at the 79th step. A smile appeared on his face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs for Jing Nan, who was sitting beside him, he was frowning. When he looked at the eagle statue, the hundreds of names on it seemed to have disappeared in his eyes until there was only one left.119th: Mo Su, 79 steps.As Su Ming\u2019s ranking rose, Wu La, who was at another small stairway in the mountain, grew nervous. She held the plate in her hands as she looked at the rankings on it.118th: Wu La, 82 steps.After a long while, when Wu La saw the person called Mo Su was still at the 79th step, she let out a sigh of relief and with gritted teeth continued climbing upwards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked around him, and especially at the moon in the sky. There was still some time left before midnight, even so, night was a comfortable moment for him.Ever since he started training in the Fire Berserker Art, Su Ming fell in love with the night. He especially looked forward to the nights when the moon was full. Yet ever since Su Ming started practicing the Fire Berserker Art, he had never seen the full moon.It may have appeared once, but the moon was covered by dark clouds that day. He could feel restlessness in his body when he was in the fire cave, but there was not much change within him in the end. Su Ming had analyzed it himself, if the moon had not been covered by dark clouds that day, then he may have had some obvious changes.It was a pity that today was not a full moon either, but Su Ming still felt at ease. At the same time, as the pressure increased with each step he took, the pressure also increased as the moon rose into the sky.\u2018The Elder of Wind Stream Tribe did mention that pressure in the mountain would increase at night, looks like it\u2019s true.\u2019Su Ming smiled. He was not bothered by it. To him, as the pressure at night increased, it meant that his power would reach its peak.Su Ming was much more terrifying at night than he was at day!Su Ming averted his gaze from the moon and sat down cross-legged on the 79th step. He took a deep breath and began to quietly feel the difference in this place.It was just as he expected. This was the 2nd place on the stairs where the pressure was balanced. The pressure may be balanced, but it was still much stronger than the pressure on the 32nd step. This place was extremely suitable for him to continue controlling the Qi in his body to a profound state and control the amount of blood veins he wanted to manifest on his body to extreme precision.As of then, Su Ming also knew that the additional three blood veins that manifested when he walked to the 79th step were due to him being able to control the Qi in his body to extreme precision. Just one more, and he would be able to reach the 5th level of the Blood Solidification realm!This made Su Ming extremely excited with the prospect of just how many blood veins he would be able to manifest once the 79th step was no longer enough for his training and he would have to go higher!Su Ming slowly closed his eyes and began circulating his Qi around his body. Once again, he entered into the fine state of controlling his Qi and tried to control the speed of his Qi reverting into his body, making it slow down according to his will.As time passed by, the 52 blood veins on his body gradually began to reduce at a steady rate from the erratic pace when he first started training at the 79th step as he began to get used to the state. Slowly, he began approaching his previous limit at the 32nd step, but now that he had three extra blood veins on his body, there were still 40 blood veins left on his body as the blood veins disappeared one by one!Su Ming was calm. There was not a shred of anxiety on him. He slowly circulated his Qi and focused on exercising fine control. Very soon, two hours passed by.At that moment, many people had already stopped moving forward in the mountain. They chose to sit down cross-legged on one of the steps to train and observe the rankings on the plate in their hands. They were also waiting for daylight to arrive so that they could continue competing against each other.Wu Sen panted harshly. His face was pale. After he gritted his teeth and arrived at the 295th step, he finally caved under the pressure and sat by the side. His face was dark. As he looked at the mist, there was uncertainty in his eyes.\u2018My Blood of Corpses\u2026 Shit! That person stole my Blood. Without it, not only will I be unable to use my powers accurately, I\u2019ll also weaken rapidly\u2026 I can already feel myself becoming weaker\u2026\u2018I cannot let the elder know about this. If he learns that I lost my Blood, then even if he helps me retrieve it, I\u2019ll lose my value in his eyes\u2026\u2019Once he thought of the horrific consequences, Wu Sen clenched his fists. There was a hint of fear under the layer of uncertainty in his eyes as well.\u2018I definitely can\u2019t let other people know about this, especially the people who offered me their Corpse Blood in the past. I\u2019ve been oppressing them these past few years because I was strong and my status in the tribe was high. If they knew that I lost the Blood of Corpses, they\u2019ll immediately betray me.\u2018What should I do..? What should I do..?\u2019Wu Sen\u2019s face was vicious as he gritted his teeth. Still, there was uncertainty on his features.Chen Chong was panting harshly. He was mumbling under his breath as he walked. When he looked at the brightening moon in the sky despite it being covered by mist, he wanted to rest and wait for tomorrow. Yet the moment he looked at the rankings on the plate in his hands and saw that the person called Bi Su had surpassed him by two steps, he felt challenged.\u201cYou bastard! I won\u2019t take this lying down!\u201d Chen Chong gritted his teeth and continued walking.At the same time, Bi Su from Black Mountain Tribe was also panting harshly as he looked at the plate in his hands and continued walking despite the increasing pressure brought by the moon. It was as if he was competing with Chen Chong and was forcing himself to continue climbing the steps.It was not until an hour later that Chen Chong let out a huge roar and sat down by the side with his legs trembling. He growled a few times at the quiet mist around him.\u201cGo! Go on ahead! You bastard, I won\u2019t compete with you today anymore! I\u2019ll do it tomorrow!\u201dPerhaps Bi Su felt it, because after he took a few more steps, he flopped onto the ground. Yet when he looked at his rank, there was a dark smile on his lips.Lei Chen was sitting somewhere around the 130th step with extreme unwillingness and was panting heavily.Many people had already stopped, but there was one person who kept moving forward.\u201c563\u2026 567\u2026 572\u2026 Ye Wang is actually walking during midnight!\u201d\u201cThe 2nd place is Bi Su. He only took 397 steps, but Ye Wang is already up to 500 something steps. Could he be ignoring the stronger pressure at night and wanting to continue walking?\u201d\u201cAs expected of the strongest among the younger generation. That perseverance of his is not something the others can compare!\u201dThe few hundred people in the field were all staring at the rankings on the eagle statues. Right now, the only number of steps that was changing on the board belonged to the person at 1st place.The others who were partaking in the 1st stage of the test had all stopped.\u201c587! 589!\u201d\u201cIt changed again. This time it\u2019s 595!\u201dThe field was in an uproar. Everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the 1st place. Even the leaders from other tribes were also sighing in respect for Ye Wang.\u201cMo Sang, my tribe\u2019s Ye Wang has really high potential. How is he compared to you?\u201d the Elder of Wind Stream Tribe, Jing Nan, smiled as he looked at the ranks on the statue and spoke slowly.Mo Sang was calm as he smiled.\u201cNot bad.\u201dJing Nan smiled, but he no longer talked about it.At that moment, Ye Wang\u2019s gaze was firm as he continued walking forward with his hands behind his back despite the sweat pouring down his forehead. Every single step he took was hard, but he did not hesitate. He only stopped when he reached the 600th step. There was a smile on his face as he sat down by the side.\u201cThe last time I was here, I went up to 580 steps on the first night. This time, I surpassed myself by 20 steps. That\u2019s good enough\u2026 I wonder if there\u2019s anyone who\u2019ll be able to find the test at the 562nd step\u2026 Still, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019ll be same as last time. No one will have the right to experience the test at the 562nd step,\u201d While mumbling under his breath, there was a prideful look on his face that could not be concealed.The 562nd step was a trap. He failed it when he arrived at that place the first time he took the test and only succeeded the second time. It was now his third time, and he no longer paid too much attention to it. To him, there was no one among the people taking the test who could hope to compete with him. There was no one who had the right to obtain his attention, either.He had been looking at the plate the entire day as well. However, he was not comparing his score with the other competitors but with himself.Once he stopped, sounds of discussion arose continuously in the field outside. In their sights, once Ye Wang stopped, the competition for the day had also halted completely. After that, they would have to wait for the next day for the next round.\u201cThe 1st is Ye Wang, 2nd is Bi Su, 3rd is Chen Chong\u2026 12th is Wu Sen\u2026 until now, there\u2019s only one outsider among the top 10 ranks, the others are all from Wind Stream Tribe!But the 48th place is Bei Ling, and the 49th place is Si Kong. They\u2019re also outsiders. I wonder whether those two will be able to maintain their rank in the top 50 tomorrow. After all, today is only the first day. The key that decides the results of the competition is tomorrow!\u201d\u201cJust where did Bi Su come from? That\u2019s a shocking result he has, he\u2019s in second place! He even topped Chen Chong! This person will be a famous Berserker in the future!\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t ended yet, something unexpected might happen\u2026\u201d The buzzing sounds of discussion gradually died down. The hundreds of people on the field sat down cross-legged and waited for the second day to arrive.Gradually, the only sounds within the field that could be heard were ones of breathing.\u201cMo Sang, let\u2019s go back to the tribe together and continue playing chess. We\u2019ll see whether your Su Ming can reach the top 50 tomorrow.\u201d Jing Nan smiled and looked at Mo Sang.Mo Sang did not speak, but looked at Su Ming\u2019s name on the eagle statue instead. His rank had fallen from 120 to 123. He nodded his head.Just as they were about to leave, the elder\u2019s pupils shrank as he saw something at that moment. Very soon, some of the people on the field who had yet to rest and were still looking at the ranking board occasionally let out surprised cries.\u201cHe moved! That person called Mo Su moved!\u201d That surprised cry immediately led those who had already closed their eyes to open them once more instinctively and look over. When they saw it, there was amazement on their faces.Jing Nang, who was about to leave, stopped. He, too, turned over and stared at the statue.He was not the only one. All the people on the field, including Dark Dragon Tribe\u2019s Elder, Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s leader, and the leaders from other tribes, looked over. After all, everyone who was partaking in the test had already stopped moving that night. The sudden rise in the ranks by that one person was incredibly eye-catching!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDeep in the mountains, Su Ming, who was sitting and meditating on the 79th step, suddenly opened his eyes. His control over the reduction of the blood veins in his body stopped at the 28th blood vein. That was his limit. He could no longer continue. This time, it was much easier and smoother than before. The time he spent was also much shorter. The reason was because it was night!There was a faint hint of the red moon in Su Ming\u2019s eyes as he sat under the moonlight. He slowly stood up and looked at the winding staircase. A bright flash appeared briefly in his eyes.\u2018The next place\u2026\u2019Su Ming lifted his right foot. Under the moonlight, there was no other person who would dare continue walking up the mountain besides him, be it Chen Chong, Bi Su, or even Ye Wang. No one else dared to continue moving forward. Only he, Su Ming, pressed on!The night was his!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Under the moonlight, when no one dared to move an inch in the mountain, he welcomed the incredible pressure brought by the mountain and walked forwards one step at a time.80th step, 81st, 82nd\u2026The pressure in the mountain during midnight was much stronger than in the day, and it became even more startling the higher he climbed. The moon shone brightly in the sky, and nothing seemed out of place. Yet it was precisely because it was night, and the night belonged to Su Ming, that as he walked, fine threads of moonlight that were unnoticeable fell onto the land and fused with Su Ming\u2019s body, causing the faint shadow of the moon in his eyes to become clearer.Slivers of cold circulated in Su Ming\u2019s body, causing the speed of his footsteps to increase as he continued walking. 87, 88, 93\u2026 Very soon, Su Ming arrived at the 99th step.Just as his right foot landed on the step, Su Ming trembled. Waves of heat caused by his Qi erupted forth from his body, making him shake slightly. Immediately, 52 blood veins appeared on his body. The blood veins seemed to twist around to form a strange picture.Su Ming stopped and roared towards the heavens. The sound was not loud, and it only echoed around his surroundings. Nonetheless, the 53rd blood vein manifested suddenly on his body!The appearance of that blood vein meant that Su Ming broke through the fourth level of the Blood Solidification realm and reached the fifth level!There was a muffled sound of thunder roaring within his body at that moment, and the sound echoed in his surroundings, causing a string of booming noises. Yet the sounds seemed to be swallowed by the black mist by his side, and he did not know where the sounds went.The moment Su Ming broke through the fourth level of the Blood Solidification realm and reached the fifth, on another stairway nearby was Chen Chong, who was sitting down exhausted as he was mumbling under his breath and was about to rest. His body suddenly jolted due to shock, and he looked at the black mist by his side instinctively. There was a muffled booming sound echoing in his ears. It was a sound he was familiar with!\u201cThis\u2026 This is..! Damn it! Someone actually managed to breakthrough in this place?\u201d Chen Chong was stunned momentarily, and disbelief filled his eyes. The flesh on his face trembled. He had never heard of anyone who managed to breakthrough and reach the next level in the first stage of the test. This was the first time it happened!He rubbed his eyes with force, then, when he felt that there was something wrong with his actions, he immediately changed to rubbing his ears. He turned his head to listen carefully, and his ears moved strangely before they turned red in the blink of an eye.Chen Chong had been blessed with great talent, and his hearing was especially good. Even if the distance was great and no one else could hear a thing, he could still hear clearly.This was something he was used to since he was young. Now that his powers increased the higher he was in the Blood Solidification Realm, he became even more proud of himself.As he listened, bitterness appeared on Chen Chong\u2019s face. He also felt indignant.\u201cDamn it, just what sort of luck is this? How could he breakthrough here, of all places! God, why didn\u2019t this happen to me..?\u201d Chen Chong lamented as if he was extremely jealous.Most of the other people besides Chen Chong, who had exceptionally good hearing, did not notice the muffled boom in the air. The only other person who noticed was Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s Bi Su, who was extremely close to Su Ming. He was sitting somewhere above Su Ming when he opened his eyes abruptly. He looked surprised as he turned and looked at the mist behind him.\u2018Someone broke through to a new level!\u2019Bi Su\u2019s face was dark. He remembered hearing the sound of blood veins increasing on a person some time ago. Once he connected the dots, there was a flash in his eyes, but he was not too bothered by it.He took out the plate and looked at the change in the rankings. With just one glance, he saw a name suddenly rising through the ranks rapidly as everyone else was staying put!At that moment, there was an uproar in the field outside the mountain due to Su Ming\u2019s actions. Almost everyone\u2019s focus was on the one line belonging to Mo Su on the ranking board on the eagle statues.In the past, everyone would choose to rest during the night for the first stage of the test. It was the action chosen by those within the mountains, and it was the same in the field. Yet this night was different from those of the past!All of this was because there was a name rapidly rising up the ranks at that moment!\u201cHe moved! 99 steps! He moved from 79 steps to 99 steps! That person has been like that since the beginning. Once he rested enough, he\u2019ll start climbing at a mad pace!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Mo Su, I remember him! He was in the last place previously, then suddenly rushed forward with an explosive force and went up to the 119th place before he stopped. He fell to the 123rd place after that!\u201d\u201cLook, he\u2019s now ranked 113th\u2026 No, 109th, 10- 101st! He\u2019s ranked 101st now! He\u2019s good!\u201d\u201cHaha! I didn\u2019t expect to see such a thing tonight! Very well, let\u2019s see just how far that Mo Su can go!\u201dThere were multiple discussions as the field went into an uproar. It was even livelier than it was during the day. The people who did not bother looking at the names after the hundredth were also looking with their eyes wide open.In the previous tests, almost no one would pay too much attention to those placed at the bottom. Their attention would usually be on the top 50 ranks, or even fixed at the top 30 ranks up till the top 10. Some would even only look at the top 3.But it was different this time. A situation that was rarely seen brought about talk among the people in the field.Yet as they talked among themselves with excitement, keeping their eyes glued to the ranking board, they did not put much importance on it. To them, that young man called Mo Su just found a way to spend his time while everyone else taking part in the test was resting.Once daylight arrived and all the contestants started moving once more, they would automatically ignore Mo Su. After all, Mo Su could not hope to compare with the prodigies no matter how high his rank or how many steps he took.At that moment, Su Ming\u2019s actions also caught the attention of most of the contestants on the mountain. Most of them were resting as they looked at the plates in their hands. The ones who were placed at the lower end of the ranks were especially nervous, but those who were placed higher up just took a look at it and no longer paid attention to it.Wu La was very nervous. She was sitting at the 112nd step as she widened her eyes and stared at the plate. She took special notice of the person called Mo Su because that person had managed to climb up many ranks from the last place in one go, and it made Wu La feel extremely stressed.\u2018I\u2019ve worked hard for the entire day to make it to here and finally managed to get into the top 100! That damn Mo Su! Just who is he? How could he do this? Everyone is resting right now, and the pressure has increased due to the night! Why is he doing this?\u2019Wu La gritted her teeth due to her anxiety and grievance.But after a moment, Mo Su stopped moving up the ranks once he was at the 101st place as if he had stopped moving. Wu La let out a sigh of relief.\u2018He\u2019s at his limit\u2026\u2019Lei Chen was sitting down cross-legged at the 135th step and looking at the plate in his hands. He was also looking at Mo Su\u2019s name, but there was a different look in his eyes. It was as if he was deep in thought.At the same time, Bei Ling, who was sitting at the 206th step, was also looking at the ranks on his plate, but he did not pay much attention to it. To him, that person was just trying to get attention. He did not move during the day but only moved at night, what else could he be doing besides trying to get attention?\u2018Such a cheap trick!\u2019Bei Ling smiled coldly.Situated somewhere around the 200th step, but at a location lower than Bei Ling, was Si Kong from Dark Dragon Tribe. He was frowning. He had been looking at the plate multiple times during the day and was searching for Su Ming\u2019s name, but he could not find it. He automatically ignored Mo Su\u2019s name climbing up the ranks.To him, Su Ming\u2019s rank should be around his. There was no way he could be in the hundreds. If that was really the case, then he would find it hard to accept that he lost to a weakling.On another staircase was Bai Ling, who was sitting somewhere around the 130th step. She lifted her head and looked at the moon. She did not look at the ranks. There was uncertainty on her face as she thought about something.The people on the field waited for a while. When they saw that Mo Su was stuck at the 101st place, they became disappointed but were also not too bothered by it, as if they expected that to happen.The leaders of the tribes averted their gazes and no longer looked at the ranks.The old woman in Dark Dragon Tribe closed her eyes slowly. She never looked at the ranks since the beginning, as if she was never interested in them in the first place.There was a mocking smile on Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s tribe leader. The only person he was paying attention to was Bi Su. If there was anyone else worth his attention, then it would be Ye Wang. To him, the only person who could be Bi Su\u2019s opponent was Ye Wang!Once they saw that there was no change in Mo Su\u2019s rank after a while, the sounds of discussion gradually disappeared in the field.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s clear that that person accumulated his strength and chose to move when no one else was moving. He must know that he won\u2019t get much attention otherwise and is using this method to gain some fame.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. That\u2019s a good move though. At the very least, I remember him now. I\u2019d like to see how he looks like.\u201d\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s go rest. Tomorrow is the main event. The top 50 ranks might change\u2026 Ah, he\u2019s moving! He\u2019s moving!\u201d Just as the excitement from before was about to completely die down, a surprised cry echoed through the surroundings.Mo Su\u2019s rank climbed up once again. The number of steps behind his name was also rising up at an unbelievable pace.100 steps. 103, 107, 112\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He lifted his foot and placed it on the 100th step. He stayed on the 99th step for a long time before because the moment the 53rd blood vein manifested, the Qi in his body started churning madly and surrounded his body. He needed to get used to the sudden explosive appearance of the blood vein before he could continue onwards.After all, the manifestation of that blood vein meant that he reached a breakthrough. It was not just some normal manifestation of a new blood vein.Once he started moving, Su Ming rushed forward abruptly. His body seemed to continue absorbing the moonlight as he pressed onwards. In the blink of an eye, he reached the 115th step.He did not stop. As he felt the pressure of the mountain increasing on him, Su Ming rushed forward. 120 steps, 130 steps, 150 steps, 160 steps!Within the span of a few breaths, Su Ming took about 60 steps. When he was standing at the 160th step, Su Ming suddenly felt as if there was an abrupt increase in pressure from the mountain. It was as if a sudden force erupted forth and pressed onto his body.Yet at that moment, the bright moonlight surrounded Su Ming\u2019s entire body, causing his tied up hair to move on its own under the moonlight.It would have been fine if he did not move, but now that he did, half of the people in the mountain and the entire field outside fell into dead silence!Wu La was stunned momentarily. She had been worried about her own ranking. She originally felt affronted and defensive, but now, as she was stunned, the complicated feeling she had disappeared completely. She understood then that she was not at the same level as the other person. If they were not even in the same level, then why should she compare herself to him? If she did, then she would just be embarrassing herself, nothing more.Lei Chen stood up abruptly and stared dumbly at the plate in his hands. He had been trying to guess the identity behind the person called Mo Su, but now, he was beginning to doubt his own guess. He could not say for sure whether what he had been thinking was correct.Bei Ling glared at the plate in his hands as his heart pounded against his chest. There was a brief moment where he felt as if a chill crawled down his spine as he watched the person called Mo Su climb up 60 steps within the span of a few breaths. That speed was unbelievable and he almost forgot to breathe because of it.He originally thought that the person was just trying to gain attention. That was why he chose to travel at night. Yet as he looked at it, there was no way Mo Su was doing it to gain attention. It was clear that he had the ability to do so since the beginning!If that was not the case, it would have been impossible for him to climb up 60 steps within the span of a few breaths!The entire mountain was in silence. Within that silence, Chen Chong blinked rapidly. He did not want to be bothered by it, but his instincts told him that that person called Mo Su was the one who brought about the sudden roar just now!\u2018It should be him\u2026 It should be! But just who is he? He\u2019s not from Wind Stream Tribe, that\u2019s for sure. I wonder whether I saw him on the field just now.\u2019Chen Chong still did not know that while he was still on the field surrounded by people, there was one person whose smile was extremely faint as he stood among the crowd trying to get into his circle of friends by laughing. He was of average looks, so average that people would not notice him.That person was looking at Chen Chong as he laughed and chatted with his friends, surrounded and practically worshipped by the people around him, and watched as he walked towards Bai Ling\u2026Just as Chen Chong was troubled by his thoughts, Bi Su widened his eyes where he sat on the stairway closest to Su Ming. It was as if he was trying to see through the mist and look at the person who was walking on the stairway right beside his.Bi Su was different from Chen Chong. He was too close. He could practically tell that the person called Mo Su was very close to him, and he was right behind him on the other stairway covered by mist.\u2018He\u2019s just at the 160th step, though. There\u2019s still more than twice the distance between us. He\u2019s of no threat to me! If you can come close to me, then it\u2019ll be not too late for me to pay attention to your existence.\u2019As Bi Su thought about it, he smiled coldly and closed his eyes.On another stairway on the other side of the mountain, Wu Sen stared at the ranks on the plate with a dark face. His gaze stayed especially long on Bi Su and Mo Su\u2019s names.\u2018I\u2019m at the 12th place and only at the 295th step\u2026 I won\u2019t be able to get into the top 10. I can tell that I\u2019m getting weaker\u2026 The person who stole my Blood must be one of these two!\u2019Wu Sen was not stupid. He was, in fact, very intelligent, or else he would not have been able to maintain a relatively high position within the tribe, which was filled with strife and confrontations, much less control Bei Ling and the others.\u2018Bi Su!\u2019Wu Sen\u2019s eyes swept past Mo Su\u2019s name, and he stared at Bi Su\u2019s name, who was ranked second on the plate with a vicious look in his eyes. Even so, there was a hint of fear and caution hidden deep within that viciousness.Wu Sen had no confidence that he could snatch back his Blood from a person ranked second in this test\u2026Si Kong was nervous. As of then, his demeanor was similar to how Wu La had acted before. When he looked at ranks and at Mo Su\u2019s name, who was at the 160th step, his heart pounded against his chest. He was afraid that he would be overtaken.He would not be so worried if it was daylight, but it was night time now. He had no confidence to continue onward. Besides, he was currently ranked 49th. Once he was overtaken, then he would be placed at the 50th spot. It may seem like it was just small difference, but the meaning within the rank was completely different.Besides them, almost everyone taking part in the test had their eyes fixed on Mo Su\u2019s name on their ranking plates.Only Ye Wang never looked at the plate. It was not as if he did not know about what was happening. It was just that with his personality, even if he knew, he would not pay attention to it.However, the field was even quieter compared to the silence in the mountain. It was as if even breathing was halted, and the field was enveloped in dead silence.The force that was halting the people\u2019s breathing on the field was their own shock, which stemmed from the one name they were all looking at on the ranks shown on the eagle statues.63rd: Mo Su, 160 steps.After the sudden explosive increase in steps, many among them no longer treated Mo Su as an entertainment to pass time. They were regarding that name with importance because the sudden increase of 60 steps caused them to be in shock and disbelief!If it was during the day, then perhaps they would be just shocked, but it was night. It was night, when the pressure in the mountain was a hundred times stronger than during the day. Most of them believed that if he could take 60 steps within the span of a few breaths during night, then that number would increase by several folds during the day!There were few who could do what Mo Su did among all those participating in the test!\u201cJust\u2026 who is he..?\u201d\u201cMo Su\u2026 Mo Su\u2026 I just did a calculation. He went from 99 steps to 160 steps within less than 10 breaths\u2026! This\u2026 is unbelievable!\u201d\u201cHis rank went up from 101 to 62 within the blink of an eye. This person\u2026 if he had this sort of ability, then if he did what he just did during the day, he would have gotten into the top 30 ranks. Why is he doing this at night..?\u201dAfter a long while, sounds of discussion gradually rose within the field, and they grew stronger by the moment. Even the leaders from other tribes were also looking at the ranks.However, the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe and the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe still paid no attention to it.That night was bound to be different. On that night, all attention was bound to belong to one person \u2013 Su Ming!There was a faint smile on Mo Sang\u2019s lips as he looked at the ranks on the eagle statue. The expectation within him became stronger. He knew that Su Ming had completely understood the meaning behind the six numbers.As for Jing Nan, he looked calm as he stood beside Mo Sang. There was no changes whatsoever on his face. If he could not hide his emotions, then he would not have been able to obtain his current power and status.\u201cNot bad, Mo Sang. You taught the child you brought back well. Honestly, I\u2019ve always been curious about his birth\u2026\u201d Jing Nan smiled as he looked at Mo Sang.\u201cCurious? Would you believe me if I told you he was the prince of the Great Yu Dynasty?\u201d Mo Sang looked at Jing Nan and smiled as he spoke. Jing Nan could not tell whether he was lying from his demeanor. Perhaps Mo Sang would forever be the only one who knew the secret to Su Ming\u2019s birth.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just say he\u2019s the Son of the God of Berserkers? Interesting. How interesting.\u201d Jing Nan was momentarily stunned, then he started laughing out loud.\u201cPerhaps he might be.\u201d Mo Sang smiled as he spoke.Jing Nan laughed, but in his heart, he was shocked. He was not sure whether he should believe in Mo Sang\u2019s words. He did not like that thought. For all the years he had lived, he would always have that sort of feeling whenever he met Mo Sang.At that moment, there was another cry of surprise among the discussions and commotion in the field!\u201cHe\u2019s moving! Just when is he going to stop! Look, 168 steps!\u201d\u201c172, 179. This speed\u2026 he seems to be slower than before\u2026\u201d\u201cThis should be his last charge. I say he\u2019ll only reach 200 steps at most, nothing more!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s about it. I think the 190s would already be very difficult for him now. This is night time, after all. The higher he climbs, the stronger the pressure will be!\u201d Numerous pairs of eyes were focused on the ranks on the various eagle statues amidst the sounds of discussion. Some of those gazes were cold, some disdainful, some expectant, some admiring, and some filled with jealousy.At that moment, Su Ming\u2019s entire body was surrounded by moonlight as he continued walking forward one step at a time on the stairway. As he walked, the 53 blood veins on his body let out a brilliant red glow. As he pressed onwards, the 54th blood vein also manifested suddenly.The 55th, 56th, 57th blood vein also appeared simultaneously soon after the 54th, causing the blood red glow on Su Ming\u2019s body to become stronger. It filled his body with a powerful force that seemed ready to erupt.Su Ming growled and took another big step forwards onto the 186th step. Once he did so, the banging sounds that signaled the increase of blood veins reverberated once again through his body. That sound made Bi Su frown on the other mist covered stairway. It also made Chen Chong, who was listening carefully, grit his teeth, hoping and wishing fervently that his body would make the same sounds.189, 192, 199\u2026 200!The ranks on the eagle statues in the field changed once again!1st: Ye Wang, 600 steps.2nd: Bi Su, 397 steps.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu3rd: Chen Chong, 391 steps.\u202648th: Bei Ling, 206 steps.49th: Si Kong, 201 steps.50th: Mo Su, 200 steps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The previous looks of disdain, scorn, or even amusement were completely gone like the wind.No one treated Mo Su as an entertainment for them to spend their time anymore. They had just witnessed a miracle and saw something unbelievable happening before their own eyes!This person made it from the last into the hundreds, then to the 50th place!There were even some in the field who were in disbelief to what they just saw. They did not imagine that such an incident could occur.Mo Su even did this while everyone was not moving, and he pushed forward from the last place to the top 50 ranks. He even did all this during midnight. This was too shocking, hence most of the people in the field had already ignored the striking results in the top 10 ranks, neglected Bi Su, who was in second place, and had all their attention drawn to Mo Su\u2019s name.\u201cJust how far can he go\u2026?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll definitely make it to the top 30!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. He seemed to not have enough energy during the last charge. But no matter what, if he can enter the top 50, then it means he\u2019s very powerful!\u201dThe sounds of discussions continued like waves and did not stop. The night should have been quiet, but at that moment, it was impossible for the spectators to remain silent when they had just seen something they had never seen before. In fact, the field was even livelier than during the day.Su Ming made it to the 50th place, and all eyes were on him, no matter whether it were the hundreds of people on the field, or the participants of the test who were also in the mountain.While those who were below the top 50 were angry that he suddenly surpassed them, they were also filled with respect. As for those within the top 50, they were all staring at the plates within their hands and looking at Su Ming\u2019s rank. To them, Su Ming had just become a threat. The threat may yet not be great, but nonetheless, they started placing some importance to his existence.As for those in the top 20 and above, they did not place much importance on him.However, the ones who were the most anxious at that moment would definitely be Si Kong and Bei Ling. One of them was placed 49th, and the other 48th. That person who suddenly made it to the top 50 was like a thorn in their side.It was especially so for Si Kong, whose face was pale at that moment. He clenched his fist. He was the son of the tribe leader of Dark Dragon Tribe. He had gritted his teeth and made it to this rank after much difficulty. He had felt prideful for his achievements, but as of now, his heart was racing against his chest.\u2018Don\u2019t go up! Don\u2019t go up! Don\u2019t go up!\u2019He was screaming in his heart while he stared at the rank shown on the plate with bloodshot eyes.On a stairway located further away, Bei Ling stood up. He was also extremely nervous. He widened his eyes and stared at the plate, but did not scream in his heart like Si Kong. Instead, he gritted his teeth and turned, walking towards the 207th step.As most of the people were staring at the plate, Su Ming stood at the 200th step and took a deep breath. The persistence in his eyes was as hard as steel. On his body, all 58 blood veins were shining brightly. If there was no mist covering them, then the light would have definitely shone with dazzling brilliance, and even those far away would be able to see it. Yet now, due to the presence of the mist, everything was hidden away deep within the mountain.Su Ming felt a strong power blossoming within his body. He lifted his head and then looked at the night sky and the moon through the thin layer of mist above him.He did not know why, but ever since he started training in the Fire Berserker Art, he fell in love with the night. He did not hate the day, per say, but he no longer looked forwards to it.\u201cAmong all those living on the land, who will be able to see the end of the horizon..?\u201d Su Ming mumbled under his breath as he stared at the dark sky. There was a brilliant flash in his eyes that disappeared as soon as it appeared. If no one was looking into his eyes closely, they would not have discovered it.Su Ming lifted his right foot and went forward once more. He stepped onto the 201st step and the 202nd step. The moment his feet landed, Si Kong, who was on a stairway further away from him, stood up with a vicious look and roared towards the sky, then moved forward in a frenzy.He watched with his own eyes as his own ranking fell from 49 to 50. It was just a difference in one place, but that was akin to the difference between heaven and earth. It made Si Kong, prideful as he was, unable to accept it.If he had been overtaken since a long time ago, he would not have minded it, but once he had managed to get into an advantageous position from the start and then had his position suddenly taken, he found it hard to accept. He gritted his teeth and walked forward step by step as he growled lowly under the incredible pressure caused by the moon on the mountain with a vicious look on his face.At the same moment, Bei Ling also moved!Their actions were like a butterfly effect. The people placed 47th, 46th, and 45th also could not hold still any longer and stood up, unwilling to give up. All of them began walking once more.Once they started moving, it was as if the few hundred people in the field were given a powerful medicine that made them excited. The sounds of discussion were like the endless waves in the sea.\u201cSi Kong\u2019s moving! 202, 203\u2026 He stopped\u2026\u201d\u201cBei Ling won\u2019t stay still anymore either. 207, 208, 210\u2026\u201d\u201cInteresting, with Mo Su getting into the top 50, the rankings are now thrown into chaos. There\u2019s bound to be a person who\u2019ll fall out of the top 50. If that\u2019s the case, then they\u2019ll definitely be nervous!\u201dThe moment the discussions became louder, a sudden silence fell upon them. The sounds of speaking turned into the sounds of sharp intakes of breath. All of their gazes were focused on the one name climbing madly up the ranks!Even the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe, who was never interested in the ranks, opened her eyes and stared at the name on the eagle statue beside her jumping up the ranks. She looked calm. If there was any change in her thoughts, other people would find it hard to detect.However, the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe still did not look at the ranks.49th: Mo Su, 205 steps.46th: Mo Su. 213 steps.42nd: Mo Su. 221 steps.39th: Mo Su, 232 steps.37th: Mo Su, 239 steps.34th: Mo Su, 247 steps!Si Kong stared at the ranks on the plate in his hand. His entire face was pale while his body trembled. It was as if he lost all his strength and fell to the ground. He gritted his teeth, but it turned into a sense of helplessness. He only managed to take two steps and could no longer bear the pressure brought about by the night. He had to stop.Bei Ling\u2019s face was bitter as he also gave up on continuing. He did not have any more strength to move. The pressure of the night was not something he could withstand.The others also stopped. As they looked at the shocking sight of Mo Su going from the 50th place to the 34th place, a sense of powerlessness arose within them.Su Ming stood at the 247th step. That was not even half of the mountain. Compared to the seemingly endless stairway, he was only a small distance up the stairs. Even so, even if it was just a small distance, as he stood there, it was as if he was standing in midair. There was no wind where he was, and due to the mist surrounding him, it was difficult for him to see the world outside. Yet as Su Ming lifted his head and looked at the moon, he felt as if it was now closer to him.Su Ming took in a deep breath and lifted his foot once again to land on the 248th step. The moment he stood there, the blood veins in his body increased once again, and it rose from 58 blood veins to 59 blood veins!Su Ming lowered his head and looked at the blood veins on his body. There was a smile on his lips. He could clearly feel the similar balance on the 248th step, just like in the previous two places.The sky was still dark. There was still some time before daylight, but Su Ming gave up on moving onwards. He sat down with his legs crossed on the 248th step and closed his eyes. He immersed himself within the circulation of his Qi and began controlling it with finesse.Due to the increase in his blood veins, the difficulty in fine control had also increased. Yet Su Ming was not anxious. He did not want to give up on this sort of a rare chance. Besides, the purpose of the elder telling him the six numbers was for him to treasure the chance in the first place.When Su Ming went into meditation to control the speed of the circulation of Qi in his body, time passed by slowly. Once the participants who were in the later 30s saw the final result, their uncertainty gradually turned into contemplation. As for those before the 34th place, they began to relax from their anxiety.Those within the field were filled with different theories and expectations once Su Ming stopped once again.\u201cJust who is he?\u201d\u201cWhich tribe does he belong to?\u201d\u201cWhy did he choose to move at night?\u201d\u201cWhy did he stop once he reached 34th place? Is he tired, or does he have another plan?\u201d\u201cCan he maintain his rank, or will he fall out of the top 50, or will he\u2026 get into the top 30, and even the top 20..?\u201d\u201cCould he perhaps\u2026 get into the top 10?\u201dNumerous questions appeared within the hearts of the people in the field. As the sounds of discussion gradually died down, they buried their queries in their hearts and waited for the moment they would obtain their answer.There were also quite a number of them who did not think highly of Su Ming. They believed that Su Ming would stop moving soon. More importantly, as daylight was about to arrive and the others would start moving once again, Su Ming\u2019s rank would fall.Yet no matter what, even those who did not expect too much from Su Ming had to admit that Mo Su\u2019s name brought about a change during that night. Due to that, his name would be remembered forever by all the people. In fact, even after many years had passed, they would still remember it\u2026That night, Mo Su\u2019s brilliance was greater than the people\u2019s in the top 10 ranks, and it could even be said that it was greater than Ye Wang\u2019s!It was destined that Mo Su\u2019s name would be taken into account occasionally even when day arrived. No matter what the spectators\u2019 thoughts were, most of them held some form of expectation towards that name.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMo Sang was still smiling as he looked at Su Ming\u2019s rank. He might not know how and why Su Ming changed during the night, but he understood that everyone had their own secrets. As his elder and guardian, there were times where he did not have to know everything about his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but would have to protect him.\u201cDo you believe what I said now?\u201d For the first time since he came to this place, Mo Sang took the initiative to speak to Jing Nan.Jing Nan\u2019s face was calm as usual, but when he looked at the rankings, he frowned slightly. He became even more uncertain towards what Mo Sang said about Su Ming\u2019s birth.The night slowly passed by. The field sank into a peaceful silence. Almost everyone became quiet due to the different thoughts occupying their minds. Yet their gazes would still occasionally wander to the eagle statues and stay on the line belonging to Mo Su.After a long while, the first rays of light brightened up the horizon. A new day had arrived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The moment it returned to normal, Ye Wang was the first to move.He opened his eyes calmly and got up before moving towards the 601st step. He had no idea what happened last night. To him, who had always been prideful, there was no need to look at the plate. He still believed that there was no one who could become his opponent. The only person who could compete with him was himself.Ye Wang walked one step at a time up the stairs with great pride in his gait. He had a resolve. He must make it to the 900th step this time during the first stage of the test this time. He could still remember clearly that the final step he took last time was when he was in the eight hundreds. He had been exhausted and was unable to move any longer. When he had to finally give up, he lifted his head and seemed to see a strange stone statue at the summit of the mountain far away.It was a pity, however, because he could not see the statue clearly due to the distance between them. Nonetheless, that one glance alone made Ye Wang become persistent. His pride and extraordinary talent would not let him rest. He would see that summit that no one has ever seen before!He longed to stand there and look down towards the people beneath him.He was prideful, and he continued walking further up the stairs within the mist in his fire-like clothes. He might not have looked at the rankings, but he knew that he was in the 1st place!Chen Chong was gritting his teeth as he continued mumbling under his breath and climbing upwards with all his strength. He might be panting harshly, but he did not stop to rest. Instead, he would occasionally look at the plate in his hands to check Bi Su\u2019s rank.Bi Su was still higher than him by three steps. Both of them seemed to have made rivals of each other and were constantly competing against each other. In truth, this had already happened since yesterday, and Chen Chong absolutely refused to resign himself to losing.\u201cYou bastard. Choose either to walk faster and widen our distance so that I won\u2019t be bothered so much, or slow down a few steps. Aren\u2019t you tired? Well, if you\u2019re tired, I\u2019m tired too!\u201d Chen Chong was drenched in sweat. It may be day time, but he, who was currently in the four hundreds, could feel the pressure from the mountain beginning to suffocate him. Fatigue rushed forward through his entire body like a tidal wave.Bi Su was also panting harshly. He may have rested for an entire night, but as he continued climbing upwards, and the pressure continued increasing, the arrogance within his heart was gradually stifled. It was especially so when he saw Ye Wang, who remained in first place, walking steadily up the stairs in the six hundreds. It made a bit of respect grown in him towards the man.Without the desire to compete for first place any longer, he started directing his attention towards Chen Chong, wanting to win against him. To him, his opponent was only Chen Chong. Once he completely overcame this person, even if he lost first place to Ye Wang, his name would ring throughout all the tribes around the region.Especially since the elder was now\u2026 Bi Su smiled coldly. There was a hint of yearning and fantasizing within his eyes.Wu Sen\u2019s face was pale. He may have rested for an entire night, but his condition did not become better. As time continued trickling by, the weakness brought by the loss of the Blood of Corpses from his body began revealing itself. His face was dark as he continued walking forwards. He would occasionally look at the ranks in the plate and at Bi Su, who was ranked 2nd. There was a look of discontent on his face.He was still ranked 12th, but Wu Sen knew that he no longer had any hope to enter into the top ten. The people before him were usually no match for him in the tribe, but now\u2026Wu Sen sighed.Compared to them, Su Ming was much calmer. He did not continue climbing up the mountain but was sitting cross-legged on the 249th step controlling the speed of the Qi circulating in his body to a profound state.He was using every ounce of his abilities and the balanced pressure in this place to limit the increase and decrease of his blood veins to only one at a time.To him, exercising fine control was very interesting. This was the same to him as when he was quenching herbs, but this time, his body was the cauldron, the Qi in his body was the flames, and his body was the herbs. He would control the strength of the fire and refine his body.As time passed by, the hundreds of people in the field outside looked at the ranks on the eagle statues and started talking among themselves again.\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Ye Wang will be in the first place. He\u2019s in the six hundred and eighties, no one can catch up to him.\u201d\u201cThe second and third place are definitely Chen Chong and Bi Su. Look at them, those two are chasing after each other. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re competing against one another.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity for Wu Sen. I wonder what happened to him. I just can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity for Mo Su too. It\u2019s already noon, but he hasn\u2019t moved at all. Now his rank has been overtaken multiple times, and he\u2019s at the 47th place\u2026\u201dAs they were discussing among themselves, one name ranked in the hundreds suddenly glowed with a gray light on the nine eagle statues. As it flickered, the name turned gray.The sudden change immediately caught the crowd\u2019s attention, but they were not surprised.\u201cSomeone gave up!\u201d\u201cSince the past, a huge number of abdicators will appear on the second day of the first stage of the test. They no longer have any strength to continue onwards and can no longer withstand the pressure in the mountain. If they don\u2019t leave, then they will face the danger of their blood pressure increasing.\u201dThe air suddenly twisted, soon followed by a wisp of mist coming from the mountain towards the field. Once it disappeared, a young man around twenty years of age staggered and almost fell onto the ground with a pale face. It was clear that he was forcefully transported out.It was as if he felt uncomfortable with the gazes of the people on him. He lowered his head and quickly went to his tribe located in the distance. He sat down quietly with disappointment.The number of people who gave up like him increased in the afternoon. The names that turned gray, and the black mist that transported the people out of the mountain from the twisted space became the spectators\u2019 main attraction on the second day.The people who gave up would mostly sigh in disappointment and return to their tribes. There were quite a number of them who came from Wind Stream Tribe.\u201cThose ranked in the hundreds have all given up. Hey, look. By tonight, all those ranked below the top fifty will give up, and by midnight, there\u2019ll also be a number of people who will give up. After all, even if they don\u2019t move forward during midnight, they won\u2019t be able to resist the incredible pressure in their exhausted state.\u201d\u201cEvery single time during the first stage of the test, the rankings are not the only entertainment. Looking at the people who gave up is also a form of entertainment.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it? It\u2019s especially so for those who got a pretty good ranking and gave up. Those looks of anxiety and fear that someone else will overtake them are really interesting.\u201dJust as the sounds of discussion echoed in the air, a person\u2019s face suddenly lit up in excitement as he looked at an eagle statue.\u201cMo Su moved!\u201dThe moment the words were spoken, it immediately caught almost everyone\u2019s attention. Numerous eyes fell upon the statues and on the line that belonged to Su Ming.Su Ming opened his eyes. After spending half the day exercising fine control, the blood veins in his body had reduced to twenty-one, and he could no longer continue decreasing the number. Su Ming lifted his head and looked at the stairs shrouded by mist before him. He slowly stood up.He did not know that he was under the scrutiny of a lot of people. As of then, he only had two thoughts in his mind. Besides using this place to exercise fine control and train, he also did not want to let the elder down.\u2018I\u2019ll do my absolute best and give it my best shot!\u2019Su Ming was, after all, still a teenager. He had a teenager\u2019s spirit and determination.There was a flash in his eyes before he took a quick one step forward and landed on the 249th step. An incredibly strong amount of pressure pressed against him, causing Su Ming to tremble.\u2018What great pressure!\u2019Su Ming\u2019s face was pale. He felt as if there was a ferocious mythical creature roaring towards him down the stairs.Su Ming\u2019s eyes were firm. As the pressure came forth, he activated and circulated the Qi in his body until all fifty nine blood veins appeared, then he rushed forward.251, 255, 258\u2026 Su Ming took a deep breath and continued taking twenty something steps. When he stood at the 270th step, only then did he exhale slowly.There was sweat beading on his forehead. Without the help of the moonlight, walking on the stairs during the day to Su Ming was more draining. Yet the more it was so, the more firm he was in his resolution. More importantly, as the pressure increased on his body and lashed against the fifty nine blood veins on him, it made Su Ming feel as if his blood veins were about to increase once again.He knew that this was all due to him being able to discover the secret of the six numbers and continuing to exercise fine control over the circulation of his Qi. Because of this, not only did he gain precise control over his Qi, the potential within him was also forced out due to the fine control.It was especially so since the elder used the True Awakening on him and Su Ming obtained a drop of Berserker Blood from him. Those gifts given to him by the elder were truly absorbed into himself once he practised fine control multiple times on the mountain and was aided by the pressure as he continued climbing upwards.Su Ming gritted his teeth once more and continued moving forwards quickly. Muffled booming sounds echoed within his body as he continued moving ahead, and the 60th blood vein immediately manifested on his body!Sixty one blood veins, sixty two blood veins\u2026 The moment Su Ming landed onto the 301st step, the 67th blood vein manifested itself with an explosive force on his body!The sixty seven blood veins surrounded Su Ming\u2019s entire body and made him feel as if he had an unlimited amount of energy. He may be drenched in sweat, but the unwavering determination in his eyes became even stronger.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming did not know the amount of shock he brought onto the hundreds of people in the field the moment he moved from the 248th step to the 301st step!The tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe looked towards the statue abruptly. There was a rare serious look on his face.\u201cSixty steps again! When that Mo Su doesn\u2019t move, he\u2019s unassuming, but the moment he does, he shocks the world!\u201d\u201cHaha! I was waiting for him to move all this while. He didn\u2019t let me down. Mo Su, get into the top thirty! Even better, get into the top ten!\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t move for the entire day. Even if he did now, he\u2019s only placed 36th, unlike yesterday\u2026\u201d There were hints of jealousy within the voice of the person who was pretending to be speaking in disdain among the sounds of discussion. That person who spoke suddenly widened his eyes and swallowed down the words he was just about to speak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As of then, the hundreds of spectators on the field and the people who dropped out from the first stage and returned with gloomy faces all widened their eyes. There was astonishment on their faces.Some of them already rose up from their sitting positions unconsciously, and there were some who moved forward instinctively towards the eagle statue located a little further away from them as if they wanted to take a closer look.The old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe was staring at an eagle statue not far away with bright eyes shining with a strange light. She was staring at Mo Su\u2019s rank.The leaders of the other tribes were also staring intently at the statues with serious faces.The Head of the Guards of Dark Mountain Tribe, Bei Ling\u2019s father, had kept his gaze trained on the rankings on the eagle statue since the beginning, and most of his attention was on Bei Ling\u2019s rank. At that moment, he ignored his son and stared at Mo Su\u2019s name and the numbers showing the amount of steps he took behind him increasing at an exponential speed.At that moment, the entire field fell into dead silence.36th: Mo Su, 301 steps.34th: Mo Su, 310 steps.31st: Mo Su, 322 steps.28th: Mo Su, 335 steps.26th: Mo Su, 344 steps.23rd: Mo Su, 351 steps.19th: Mo Su, 371 steps!It was not until Mo Su stopped and remained at the 19th place and at the 371st step after a long while that there were sounds of sharp breath intakes in the field.That scene made most of the people who saw it to be in disbelief. They may have witnessed a miracle yesterday night, but the change this time was too great compared to last night!If yesterday night was a miracle, then the unbelievable sight that happened right now could only be called a legend!\u201cHe didn\u2019t even take the span of sixty breaths and managed to go from the 248th step to the 371st step\u2026 This is\u2026 He managed to take more than a hundred and twenty steps\u2026 And all it took was less than sixty breaths!\u201d\u201cWu Sen cannot do it.

The noise was much greater than it was during the previous night.\u201cThis is only the afternoon. What will happen when it\u2019s evening, or night? With the strength that he showed us yesterday, how far will he go? Just what rank will he obtain in the end?\u201d\u201cTop ten! He\u2019ll definitely make it to the top ten!\u201d There were people who were jealous of Su Ming\u2019s achievements, but there were still plenty of them who were nobodies within the tribe. No matter whether it was Chen Chong, Wu Sen, or even the people ranked in the top ten, top twenty, or even the top thirty or forty, these people were all prodigies way above them who deserved respect. There was also a longing to approach these people within them, yet at the same time, they also harbored feelings of disgruntlement and helplessness.Now, they saw a person who suddenly rose up the ranks with their own eyes. They saw the miracle of the person who was in the last place the previous day, who used a momentum and speed that was indescribable to speed up from the last place to get up to the 19th place!It was precisely because they saw it with their own eyes that they felt excited. It was as if Mo Su were themselves. Yet, people were complicated. This was not a simple change in attitude. Amidst their excitement, they all had complex feelings along with admiration. Those feelings tangled with each other and formed an emotion that they did not know how to describe.They wanted and hoped that Su Ming would continue to rise up and fulfill their longing to continue seeing the miracle, yet they were also deeply jealous that a nobody like him could suddenly climb up the ranks. They could only wish that he would be like them and be forever stuck at the bottom.\u201cTop ten? Hmph, I don\u2019t think so. He just got lucky and might have used some sort of low handed trick to get so far!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Look at him. Every single time he walks a distance, he\u2019ll have to rest for a long time. I say that\u2019s where his secret lies!\u201dThe discussions were filled with contradictions. The people were excited for one moment and jealous by the next. Yet at that time, there was an old man with a sharp mouth and cheeks of a monkey within the crowd. The old man\u2019s eyes moved around as if a thought just crossed his mind. He would occasionally get close to the people who were deep in discussion and pull one of them backwards. Under their dissatisfied looks, he would lower his head and murmur in their ears, then quickly open his shirt before closing it just as quickly, as if he was afraid someone would see it.The people who were dragged out by the old man all looked at him strangely with looks of disbelief. Yet after the old man told them something, most of them would believe him somewhat. There were even some who were brought further away by the old man to trade.The participants still within the mountain shared the complex feelings of those in the field. Most of them were looking at the plates in their hands and at the name that entered their sights since the previous night. They did not know what exactly they were feeling. There were feelings of admiration, jealousy, and perhaps even disbelief within them.Lei Chen looked away from the plate. There was a boyish smile on his lips, but there was still uncertainty in his eyes. As he continued walking, he kept wondering whether Mo Su was Su Ming\u2026Ever since he saw Mo Su\u2019s name the previous night, Su Ming\u2019s face immediately appeared in his head. Now that he saw Mo Su\u2019s rank going higher and that he managed to get into the 19th place, besides feeling shocked, he also began to doubt himself.\u201cAh, maybe it\u2019s not him\u2026\u201dBei Ling was drenched in sweat. He looked at the ranks on the plate and at the person called Mo Su rising up the ranks. He shook his head and lowered his head as he sighed.\u2018He\u2019s so good at being patient\u2026 From now onwards, his fame will definitely shake the heavens\u2026 But this has nothing to do with me. He\u2019s not from my tribe.\u2018But there\u2019s a \u2018Su\u2019 in his name\u2026 I hate that word.\u2019Bei Ling lowered his head and continued slowly walking upwards.There was also Si Kong, who was situated at a stairway further away. He no longer cared about Mo Su, who suddenly rose up the ranks. In his sights, that person had already surpassed a lot of people. He was not someone Si Kong could compare to. Right now, he had his eyes on Bei Ling, who was placed right before him.\u2018I have to get into the top fifty!\u2019Si Kong clenched his fist and walked forward with gritted teeth.It was the first time Bai Ling looked at the ranks on her plate for a long time. She was looking at Mo Su\u2019s name, and like Lei Chen, there was uncertainty in her heart.\u2018Is it him\u2026?\u2019Bai Ling smiled bitterly and shook her head. She knew that Su Ming was a Berserker and had some power, but she did not believe that he was like Mo Su, who glowed like the sun.Compared to them, the one who was truly nervous was not Ye Wang, who was absolutely clueless to what was happening, nor was it Chen Chong and Bi Su, who were engaged with each other in a fierce competition.It was Wu Sen!Wu Sen was nervous. He looked at the ranks on his plate and at Mo Su\u2019s name, who managed to make it to the 19th place all of a sudden. His face was dark. He was no longer sure now who between Bi Su and Mo Su was the biggest suspect that stole his Blood.Yet that wasn\u2019t the source of his anxiety. He was panicking over the possibility of being overtaken by not one, but two outsiders. Where could he possibly show his face after that?\u201cDamn it!\u201d Wu Sen let out a low vicious growl. His face was pale as he gritted his teeth, but he went forward in a frenzy. It was as if there was a roar in his head telling him to absolutely not be overtaken!All the people within the top twenty ranks were working hard. The moment Su Ming made it into their ranks, it immediately changed the situation within the top twenty. It was akin to a stone being thrown into water. While it brought about ripples on the surface of the water, it also caused the fishes within the water to be shocked.Yet they were fortunate that the source of their shock, Mo Su, who was currently placed 19th, stopped when he arrived at the 271st step and did not move for a long period of time. It made them breathe out a sigh of relief and quickly continue upwards, using the chance to increase the distance between them.They were afraid.They were afraid of the strange acts made by the person called Mo Su. They were afraid of him, who would be unassuming when he did not move, yet when he did, he would bring about a shocking change. It was the first time that they were so aware of a person. Even when they were moving forward, they would occasionally look at whether that person was moving.They were also worried because they had the feeling that once this person started moving once again, he would move like thunder and quite possibly make it into the top ten!Su Ming sat on the 371st step. He had guessed that he might have caught the attention of quite a number of people, but he did not expect that the name he used, Mo Su, had already brought about a typhoon upon the first stage of the test.Besides Ye Wang, there was no one who did not know his name. There was even a huge decrease in the amount of eyes looking at the top ten ranks that instead paid attention towards Su Ming\u2019s rank. They were waiting for the next time he would move forward explosively once again.Su Ming was calm. He closed his eyes. The number of blood veins that were circulating under his will was no longer sixty seven, but seventy one!The seventy one blood veins glowed in a brilliant red light as they surrounded his body. As they disappeared one by one, they would reappear again. As Su Ming was controlling them in a profound state, not only did he force out his latent potential, but he was also refining his own body so that he could obtain more power and become stronger!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt made him look forward to how fast he could go once he could run at full speed. After all, Su Ming excelled at speed!Time passed by, and it was soon dusk. During the entire afternoon, there would occasionally be mist going towards the field and transporting those who yielded. The looks on their faces also gradually changed. The higher they were ranked, the less gloomy they would look as they came out of the mountain. There were even some who returned with excitement on their faces.As dusk arrived and the sky began to darken, most of the names ranked below sixty became gray on the nine eagle statues. There were only two people left who persevered.67th: Wu La, 159 steps.61st: Bai Ling, 178 steps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once the moon started revealing itself in the sky, both names became gray.Two wisps of black mist appeared and sped towards the field as the space in the distance twisted. Both wisps turned into two girls who were pale.Bai Ling was calm. She had already given it her all. Truth be told, the moment she did not find Su Ming taking part in the test, she lost all interest in competing. The moment she came back, Bai Ling lowered her head and walked towards her tribe under the scrutiny of hundreds of people. She did not say a word and sat behind the old woman as she looked at the ranks on the statue. She stared at Mo Su\u2019s name and bit her lip, her thoughts unknown.The old woman beside her lowered her head as if she was talking to Bai Ling, but Bai Ling seemed to be ignoring her and pretending not to hear her. She did not speak.Compared to Bai Ling\u2019s untroubled manner, Wu La was incredibly discontent. She went to where Dark Mountain Tribe was located and the Head of the Guards welcomed her with a kind smile and comforting words.\u201cWu La, you did well. This is the first time you participated in the first stage of the test, and yet you managed to get into the top seventy. Go back and train more. Next time, try making it into the top fifty.\u201dWu La nodded her head slightly. She may not be satisfied with her results, but there was a pride within her that made her think that she achieved a pretty good result. It was just as the Head of the Guards said. If she could obtain this kind of result the first time she took the test, it was good enough.When Wu La lifted her head and looked at the ranks displayed on the eagle statue, she saw Bei Ling ranked 49th, Lei Chen ranked 53rd, and she looked at Mo Su. Once she saw Mo Su\u2019s name, her eyes brightened up.\u2018Who could he be..?\u2019Sometimes, time would pass by slowly, yet during the fierce match in the first stage of the test, everyone thought that time was passing by quickly. In the blink of an eye, the moon in the sky was no longer partly hidden in a crescent shape, but was turning brighter, revealing its whole form as it hung high in the sky.There was only a bit of time left before midnight. The pressure in the mountain gradually grew stronger.Lei Chen conceded. His final rank was fifty two. As he was transported back to the field by the mist, his face was not gloomy. There was still a boyish smile on his face. Once he came back, there were a few people who came up to him to greet him. It was clear that ever since the representatives from Dark Mountain Tribe came to Wind Stream Tribe, Lei Chen made quite a number of friends.Once he returned to where Dark Mountain Tribe was located, Bei Ling and Si Kong also gave up. As they returned with the black mist, Bei Ling came back with his usual aloof demeanor. He was still placed 49th. He had managed to get his wish and made it into the top fifty ranks.It was different this time compared to the previous test. A few years ago, he had only made it with Wu Sen\u2019s help. This time, he made it on his own.Bei Ling believed that if he had not given Wu Sen the large amount of Blood from the center of his brows a few days prior to the test, then perhaps his rank would be even higher. He walked towards where Dark Mountain Tribe was located pridefully.\u201cWu La, you were pretty good. You might not have been able to make it into the top fifty, but this rank is already very good. However, don\u2019t be arrogant. There are still two stages left,\u201d Bei Ling looked at Wu La and spoke slowly.Wu La quickly stood up and nodded her head lightly. There was respect in her eyes as she looked at Bei Ling. Now that she participated in the test, she knew just how hard it was to make it into the top fifty.\u201cAs for you\u2026 Lei Chen, you should have been able to make it into the top fifty ranks, but now you\u2019re only ranked at 52nd place. It\u2019s fine, there\u2019re still two stages left. You have to work harder. There are only three of us representing Dark Mountain Tribe. We have to give it our all!\u201d Bei Ling looked at Lei Chen and spoke calmly.Lei Chen lowered his head and did not speak.When Si Kong returned, he was dejected. He was still ranked 50th. He walked back towards his tribe disheartened and looked at Bai Ling, who was quietly sitting by the side. He was just about to speak to her when Bai Ling looked at him coldly. He immediately swallowed his words.As time passed by, those within the top fifty gradually gave up. As the names began to turn gray and more people returned to the field, the place started becoming lively.Those who were ranked in the top fifty came back with pleased faces. There were also quite a number of people who would go up to them to celebrate and they laughed together joyfully.There were people who gave up, but there were also people who persevered. At that moment, Chen Chong gritted his teeth and persevered in a bout of madness. His entire body was drenched in sweat, and the flesh on his face was trembling as he continued climbing up the mountain.He was already panting harshly. There were numerous stars swirling before his eyes, making him so tired he could barely go on. Yet at the same time, he continued mumbling under his breath.\u201cYou bastard, damn it, I\u2019m so tired!\u201d\u201c537\u2026 You damn Bi Su\u2026 538\u2026 You damn Bi Su\u2026 539\u2026 You damn Bi Su, you\u2019re on, I\u2019ll definitely fight against you until I die!\u201d Chen Chong wiped his sweat. There was madness in his eyes as his mutterings became louder.\u201cAre you a mad man? Why the hell do you insist on competing with me? You bastard, Bi Su, if I die of fatigue, I\u2019ll come back and haunt you! 538\u2026 Huh? That\u2019s not right, it\u2019s 539.\u201dChen Chong\u2019s face was bitter and in his madness, he panted like thunder roaring. He even went down on all fours and took onto the increasing pressure as he continued climbing forwards. His heart was pounding against his chest as if it was about to explode. The amount of sweat that fell from him could even be seen staining the stairs behind him.\u201cYou\u2019re going to make me die from exhaustion. You bastard, you\u2019re thinking about making me die from exhaustion! With this amount of sweat, I\u2019ve definitely become thinner. I\u2019m definitely thinner\u2026\u201d Chen Chong kept on panting as he continued climbing upwards. Suddenly, his ears moved. Once he listened carefully, he immediately laughed loudly.\u201cI\u2019ll make you die from exhaustion. How dare you compete with me? I\u2019ll make you die by exhaustion, you damn Bi Su!\u201d His exceptional hearing allowed him to hear the sounds of panting that was not at all weaker than his coming from a stairway further away from him.Bi Su was also in a pathetic state similar to Chen Chong. His sweat kept dripping down, and his eyes were so bright it was as if there was a fire burning within them. He had been competing against Chen Chong for a long time, and he was just climbing upwards madly while gritting his teeth. He was already so tired he could feel a stab of pain in his chest when he panted, but he refused to give up.\u201cChen Chong, I\u2019ll definitely surpass you! I am the strongest among our peers besides Ye Wang!\u201dYet, the higher they were, especially in the five hundreds, the amount of pressure, notably the exponential increase of pressure during the night, became incredibly terrifying. It was still slightly bearable during the day for Chen Chong and Bi Su, but now that it was almost midnight, it could be said that even lifting their feet alone was a difficult task.Besides these two, the rest of those who persevered were the same. It was especially so for Wu Sen. He continued walking upwards with gritted teeth. He did not want to be overtaken. Even if he could not make it into the top ten, at the very least, he had to maintain his current rank.Midnight was about to arrive, and the pressure in the mountain was about to rise to its peak. Some of the people who were still within the mountain had begun to stop. After all, according to the tradition of the first stage of the test, the final battle was tomorrow morning!The moment midnight arrived, Chen Chong\u2019s entire body trembled. He could clearly feel the pressure of the mountain reaching to a point where he was terrified by it.\u201c547\u2026 5\u2026 Damn it, I quit! Bi Su, if you want to be number two, I\u2019ll give it to you! If I continue, I\u2019ll definitely die from exhaustion here! All my body mass is gone\u2026\u201d Chen Chong fell down exhausted by the side and roared towards his surroundings.\u201cI\u2019ll take number three. It\u2019s fine, as long as I don\u2019t fall out of the top three, I won\u2019t embarrass myself! Wu Sen is still at the back anyway. Bi Su, continue if you can. Take a few more steps, better yet, just drop dead!\u201cDamn it, if only I had Mo Su\u2019s ability and had a breakthrough, then I\u2019d definitely\u2026 Huh\u2026? Ah!\u201d Chen Chong panted harshly and fanned himself with his hand as he continued mumbling under his breath. Suddenly, his body trembled and his ears perked up. His face was gradually replaced by shock.Bi Su was looking at the ranks on the plate. Once he saw that the figures showing the number of steps Chen Chong took became still, he laughed towards the sky. There was a ruthless expression on his face.\u201cI am the strongest besides Ye Wang!\u201d He gritted his teeth and climbed a few more steps, panting harshly. When he arrived at the 553rd step, he stopped. Yet, the moment he looked at the plate once more, the pleased expression on his face immediately froze. He saw Mo Su, who fell to the 21st place, move once again!Wu Sen and the others within the top twenty also noticed the change. Besides Ye Wang, everyone saw Mo Su moving in succession!At the same time, the field outside was also enveloped in such an uproar that it seemed like it was a typhoon that was about to turn the world upside down!All the people on the field, including the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe, the leaders of the other tribes, and even the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe, who had refused to look at the ranks in the beginning, all turned towards the eagle statues immediately.Numerous pairs of eyes \u2013 Lei Chen, Wu La, Bai Ling, Si Kong, Bei Ling, and the rest of those ranked after twenty, who had given up \u2013 looked towards the same name on the nine eagle statues with stilled breath.Mo Sang\u2019s eyes were bright as he stared at the ranks on the eagle statue. The brightness in his eyes was so strong that Jing Nan, who was beside him, no longer looked calm. His pupils shrank in anxiety as he looked over.Su Ming moved!Midnight belonged to him. Su Ming stood up, bathed by the moonlight. His blood veins had already been reduced until there were only fifteen left on his body under fine control. All of them sank back into his body.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs he lifted his head and looked at the moon in the sky, the shadow of the red moon gradually appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. His hair was tied up by a string made of grass and was moving in the air despite the absence of wind. Su Ming took in a deep breath and untied his hair with his right hand, causing his hair to tumble down. He lifted his right foot abruptly and landed on the 372th step.The moment he landed on the stairs, all the blood veins in Su Ming\u2019s body manifested themselves with an explosive force. It was also the first time he would show his current fastest speed in this place!A blood red light spread towards his surroundings, and Su Ming ran forwards like a shadow of blood!327 steps, 393 steps, 424 steps, 448 steps, 471 steps\u2026His speed was like a typhoon sweeping by the night. It made all the people who were watching in the mountain and in the field fall into silence\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He stood at the 457th step and stared at the ranks on his plate with a stunned expression. He could not believe his own eyes. He may have predicted that Mo Su would bring about another shocking change the moment he started moving once again, but he did not expect the level of shock that Mo Su brought would be so horrifying!It was almost within an instant, but his rank fell from the 12th place to the 13th. There was not even time for him to counterattack. He was not given any chance to fight back or struggle.He was not the only one who was stunned. Besides him, the others from the 11th place right up to the 20th place experienced a change in their ranks within an instant. That sort of change brought about a sense of powerlessness within them. They did not even have the time to generate the desire to fight back. What was left was only the sense of awe and shock.Wu Sen let out a low growl and the veins on his face popped up. He gritted his teeth and rushed forward madly. He could not accept it! As he moved, the others who were surpassed by Su Ming in rank also rose up from their resting position and joined the chase with gritted teeth!Those who could enter into the top twenty were not any common practitioners. Their pride did not allow them to give up so easily. At that moment, they did not care about the increased pressure during midnight. All of them moved!Even Chen Chong, who was resting on the 547th step, trembled in shock. He stared at the plate in his hands with a dumbfounded expression and took in a sharp breath. He heard a muffled boom just now that signaled the increase of blood veins. It was the sound that he had longed for and envied just moments ago!Bi Su, who was at the 553rd step, could hear the sound even clearer. There was only a layer of thick mist separating him from Su Ming. He could hear the sound of the muffled boom clearly and distinctly feel the person called Mo Su climbing up the stairs on the stairway by his side at a terrifyingly maddening speed!It was not just them. The ones who were the most anxious at that moment were the five people ranked from 4th to the 8th place. These five people were all from Wind Stream Tribe. They might not be as famous as Chen Chong and Wu Sen, but they were definitely extraordinary.Yet at that moment, their anxiety caused their hearts to pound against their chests, and they all stood up to continue climbing!Nonetheless, it was night. It was midnight, when the pressure of Wind Stream Mountain was at its strongest. The resistance they felt as they climbed was incredibly strong. That sort of pressure that seemed like the might of heavens pressing onto them could make a normal person\u2019s spirit break.It was especially so when all of them stood up, yet before they even took a few steps forward, they checked the ranks on their plates once again, and the shock they felt turned into dumbfounded astonishment. All of them began to stop in succession.Su Ming\u2019s hair floated behind his back. Without the string made of grass tying his hair, they moved in the air even in the absence of wind. His eyes were blood red, and there was a moon burning within his eyes!He did not stop. Once he arrived at the 471st step, his entire body started roaring nonstop as the blood veins manifested increased one by one on his body. He did not even bother to count how many blood veins had appeared, but simply continued pressing onwards.The pressure from the mountain fell onto his body like one from numerous mountains, almost making Su Ming cave under it. He circulated his Qi around his body and surrounded it with moonlight, then continued firmly at a quick speed under the pressure!472, 483, 494, 506\u2026 523, 537\u2026 546!Su Ming only stopped when he was standing on the 546th step. He was drenched in sweat and was breathing heavily, but his eyes were filled with determination!The booming sounds in his body continued. Once he stopped, all eighty seven blood veins manifested on his body. They were scattered in a disorderly manner on his body, which enveloped Su Ming with a strong presence.4th: Mo Su, 546 steps!There were only three people before him! Behind him were all the rest of the people left taking part in the 1st stage of the test!He may not be at the top of the mountain looking down on the others, nor could he climb right to the top in one go, but at that moment, Su Ming was already standing among the crowd of the most powerful people of his generation!Chen Chong shuddered. He may not be looking at Su Ming, but he could feel a strong presence rushing towards him from the plate in his hands. He could even hear the booming sounds that made him dumbfounded in his ears.He could not see Su Ming, but the latter had a force that made him even more shocking compared to Bi Su. Perhaps it was precisely because he could not see him that the mysterious feeling around Su Ming caused Chen Chong to feel a rare sense of fear and caution.Chen Chong may seem like an easygoing person, but in reality, there was still a sense of pride within his heart. He looked onto Bi Su with disdain. He only gave up because he was too tired and decided to let it be. He did not want to compete too much for that rank. Why should he make himself so tired? More importantly, Bi Su was not even considered an opponent in his eyes.So what if he surpassed him? Without that sort of presence that would make people shiver, it was all empty-talk. To Chen Chong, only one person had that sort of presence, and that person was Ye Wang!Yet now, he was shocked as he found that same presence that was supposed to be unique to Ye Wang on Mo Su\u2019s name! Chen Chong became serious. He no longer continued to mumble, but instead gradually revealed the presence of a powerful Berserker on his person.He stood up and looked towards the deeper parts of the mist. It was faint, but he saw the silhouette of a person standing on the 546th step on a stairway somewhere with his head tilted towards the sky. There was an oppressive might on that person that caused Chen Chong to pay extreme attention towards him.Compared to Chen Chong, it was obvious that Bi Su could not compare to him in that field. There was a vicious look on his face at that moment, which caused him to look ruthless. He was glaring at the mist. He could even hear the faint sounds of the person breathing behind the mist.\u201cNo matter who you are, it\u2019s impossible for you to overtake me!\u201d Bi Su growled lowly towards the mist. His words spread into the mist and scattered gradually into nothingness.At that moment, the tribe member of Wind Stream Tribe placed last among those still left within the mountain fell into a brief silence and chose to give up. He chose to leave.He knew that there was no need to wait for daylight, the final battle for the first stage of the test had begun. Yet he did not have the ability to participate in this battle. The mountain only belonged to a limited amount of people. He did not want to become a mere useless decoration for them. That was why he would rather leave than stay.Understanding their own limits and knowing when to step down was something that was not seen on most people. Still, most of the prodigies within the top twenty still understood that concept.Most of those who were powerful would usually respect each other, even if they were not within the same tribe. As the person left, besides Wu Sen and another two people, those ranked after the 4th place gave up and left the mountain for the four people who stood at the top.They left the place for them so that they could have the battleground for themselves!Wu Sen struggled for a moment, then let out a long sigh. He chose to surrender and left as well. The other two seemed to not want to surrender, but when they saw the rest leaving, after a slight hesitation, they chose to yield as well.As the wisps of black smoke appeared in succession in the quiet field in the middle of the night, no one spared a glance for them. At that moment, all the people on the field were looking at the ranks on the eagle statues with rapid breathing.The old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe had already stood up with a grave face. The strong man beside her did the same thing. They were not the only ones who did so. All the other members of the other tribes did the same thing.No one continued sitting down. Even the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe was glaring at the ranks on the eagle statue with a dark face.Bei Ling, Si Kong, Bai Ling, Lei Chen, Wu La\u2026 and the rest of them were all looking at the ranks silently.Even the prodigies who returned to the field did not mind that they were not given attention when they returned. Instead, they all turned to look at the statue and at the only four names that were still lit on the ranks when all the other names had turned gray.Mo Sang was looking at the ranks with a serious expression on his face. Jing Nan was also looking at the ranks, though his face did not betray his thoughts.Su Ming stood at the 546th step and took a deep breath. The pressure at that place was incredibly strong. It was difficult for him to move forward with his previous speed. He lifted his leg and stood on the 547th step, then continued moving forward one step at a time.His pace was not quick, but it was steady.He could hear faint sounds of roaring, as if someone was saying something, but he did not pay any attention to it. He simply continued onward and moved up one step at a time.Chen Chong\u2019s face was serious. He no longer mumbled under his breath and no longer looked at the ranks on the plate. Instead, he tore away the shirt on his person with a grave face and exposed his slightly plump upper body as he too walked forward one step at a time.As for Bi Su, his face was twisted viciously. He gritted his teeth, took on the incredible pressure on his body, bore through the pain that was brought by the oppressive might, and continued onward. Every single time he took a step, he would look at the rank on the plate!1st: Ye Wang, 791 steps.2nd: Bi Su, 554 steps.3rd: Chen Chong, 548 steps.4th: Mo Su, 547 steps.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnly Bi Su was looking at the ranks among the four of them. The other three did not. For Ye Wang, it was because he did not care about any changes. Right from the start, he believed that the only opponent for him was himself.For Chen Chong, it was because of his pride. The faint presence of Su Ming\u2019s aura had caught his attention and made him pay great importance to it. That was why he decided not to look at the ranks to avoid affecting his state of mind.Su Ming also did not look at the ranks. He was only looking at the steps on the stairway and walked forward one step at a time. With each step he took, Su Ming\u2019s entire body would tremble and a huge amount of sweat would appear as he felt the exponential pressure on his body. Yet, his unwavering determination and the indescribable resolution within him allowed him to persevere under the pressure like a small tree in a storm!\u2018Among all those living on the land, who will be able to see the end of the horizon..?\u2019Su Ming looked at the sky and mumbled as he continued walkingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That day, the moon was slightly different from the other nights. There were no clouds in the sky, causing the moon to look incredibly bright. Moonlight fell on the land as if lowering a soft curtain between heaven and earth.It may seem beautiful from a distance, but within the gigantic mountain, where the peak reached the sky and the summit was invisible to the eye, the moon turned into something terrifying!Under the moonlight, the pressure in the mountain was continuously erupting forth at a terrifying speed that turned into an invisible typhoon and distorted the entire peak of the mountain. It caused all those within to see the chaotic state around them without even needing to lift their heads.It was midnight. It was the time when the moonlight was the strongest. It was also the time of day when the pressure on the mountain reached its peak! If there was no mist on the mountain, and if anyone lifted their heads and looked from the distance towards the mountain, then they could see Su Ming and the other two standing at the top of the sky. If the watcher lifted its hands, they could touch it!Those who continued upwards past 500 would seem to have entered the sky, and that was so for Ye Wang. He did not know what was happening outside, neither did he know that there were three other people fighting hard behind him. He only cared about walking slowly on his path one step at a time, panting harshly.\u2018Today, I\u2019ll make it to 803!\u2019Ye Wang gritted his teeth and walked forward with eyes filled with a burning pride that seemed as if it could scorch all those who looked into his eyes.No one could take more than a dozen steps on the stairs if they had no perseverance while under that pressure. Bi Su was persistent, but within that persistence was a lack of confidence, or else he would not need to look at the ranks on the plate in his hands with each step he took.\u2018556, 557\u2026 Damn it, Chen Chong surpassed me, he\u2019s at 558!\u2019Bi Su was vexed. He gritted his teeth and took another step, but the moment he did so, his entire body trembled. He heard a faint roar coming from the highest part of the mountain.That roar was definitely not of man but belonging to a beast!As the roar echoed through the air, Bi Su trembled. There was a sharp pain in his chest, and he coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood. His body swayed, and he nearly fell to the side unconscious.His face was pale. During that instant, he felt as if the entire mountain turned into a mysterious beast whose form could not be seen.Chen Chong also felt it. He was standing on the 558th step and was just about to take another step forward when his entire body shook viciously. He lifted his head abruptly. His eyes were bloodshot, and blood trickled down from the corners of his mouth.Su Ming was drenched in sweat, but the determination within his eyes did not dim. Instead, it became even stronger. He pressed onward step by step. 548, 549\u2026 until he stood at the 557th step. He too, heard the faint roar.That roar seemed to be filled with rage toward the heavens as it rushed towards him. The moment it came to Su Ming, he froze. There was a sharp pain in his chest, and he coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood. There was a pressuring might within the roar itself, as if it wanted to make all the people who heard it submit to the sound.Yet at the moment his blood stained the ground before him red, the blood red moon in Su Ming\u2019s eyes suddenly burned stronger with a brilliant light!He would not yield!Su Ming lifted his head instinctively, looked towards the top of the mountain, and let out a loud roar. The sound he made was like thunder roaring, and it echoed through his surroundings. The fire burning within his eyes seemed to be ready to spill out as he lifted his right leg and stomped fiercely onto the 558th step.The moment his feet landed, Su Ming trembled and veins popped on his skin as all his manifested blood veins spread all over his body. The red and blue colors crisscrossing all over his body showed that Su Ming was experiencing an indescribable pain, but he did not give up!He would make it to the 563rd step. He would reach the fine control step over there. He did not want to give up this chance. Most of all, he did not want to make the elder disappointed. If he was to make a move, then he would definitely not make himself regret his decisions, now and forever!What he wanted to do was to have no regrets. He would give it his all and fight so that he would never regret!559, 560, 561! Su Ming took another 3 steps. With each step he took, he could feel his body trembling harshly and letting out sounds that screamed that he could no longer continue. It was as if his flesh and bone were about to be crushed. That sort of pain was nearly unbearable for him, who was merely a teenager of 16 years of age.\u20182 more, 2 more!\u2019 Su Ming roared within his heart.He kept telling himself that he had to make it to the 563rd step!Su Ming growled again. He lifted his feet and took another step! The moment he placed his foot on the ground, he felt as if the earth and mountain moved and shook. However, he knew clearly that the earth did not move, neither did the mountain shake. It was he himself that moved.The feeling as if the earth and mountain moved made Su Ming\u2019s face void of color instantly. He lifted his head and looked at the sky. It seemed to gradually move away from him, as if the sky itself was moving before his eyes. At that moment, time seemed to have slowed down.Su Ming could tell that his body was falling down slowly. The earth did not move. The mountain did not shake. It was his body that had reached its limit and was falling backwards slowly.\u2018The 562nd step is a test\u2026\u2019A bitter smile appeared on Su Ming\u2019s lips.\u2018The earth does not move. The mountain does not shake. Even if you move, none of this changes\u2026\u2019\u201cElder, why is it that when I run, it seems like the trees around me are moving? I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s my body that\u2019s running, or if it\u2019s the trees that are moving backwards. Elder, just what is happening?\u201d As he was feeling bitter about the situation, a memory of his younger self asking the elder that question surfaced in his head.\u201cYour eyes will lie to you. La Su, once you grow up, you\u2019ll understand. What you see might not be real. Perhaps your eyes are deceiving you. Look at that tree, is it really moving? Is your body moving or the tree moving? Or is it\u2026 something else?\u201dSu Ming remembered that he was still slightly confused and could not truly understand the elder\u2019s words when he heard the answer. Yet now, as he recalled it, he was stunned.\u2018The one that changed is not the earth, nor the mountain. Because the body moved, that\u2019s why everything seemed to have moved\u2026 But in truth, the earth did not move, neither did the mountain move\u2026 The one that moved\u2026\u2019Su Ming widened his eyes. He felt that he had grasped onto a line of thought.\u2018The one that moved is my mind! [1]\u2018When I ran, my body moved, but the trees didn\u2019t move. Yet what my eyes saw were the trees moving, that\u2019s because my mind\u2026 my mind was tricked by my eyes, and it\u2019s my mind that moved\u2026\u2018Even if my body moved, but if my mind didn\u2019t move\u2026 then the land, the mountains, the trees, everything wouldn\u2019t move! Even my body might be deceived. My eyes, my body, everything can trick my mind and make it seem like I\u2019m moving\u2026\u2019Su Ming shivered. Once he understood the concept, there was a roar in his head. The strength of the roar made him feel faint. When the dizziness gradually disappeared, Su Ming stood there, stunned.He lowered his head and looked at the steps underneath his feet, then looked at his surroundings. He was still standing on the steps. His right foot was on the 562nd step, and his left foot on the 561st step.In reality, his body never experienced any change.Su Ming silently lifted his left foot and went to the 562nd step. Once he did so, he took a deep breath and understanding appeared in his eyes.\u201cI get it\u2026 If my mind doesn\u2019t move, then nothing will move! This is the meaning of fine control\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled as he walked towards the 563rd step. He stood there, and a faint smile appeared on his pale face. He slowly sat down in a meditative position and began the first true fine control after he understood the meaning behind it.It was different from the previous four times. Before, he had only performed it with ignorance. All his strength was placed in controlling the speed of his Qi. This was just relying on external strength!Now that he finally understood, he knew that true fine control did not rely on external strength to control the speed of Qi circulation, but on the mind!Qi will only move when the mind moves. If the mind does not move, then Qi will also remain still!At the same time Su Ming sat down, Bi Su let out a frustrated roar. His right leg trembled and hung above the 562nd step. Yet no matter what, he could not place it down. He had a strong feeling that if he placed his foot down on the step, his body would not be able to bear it. The feeling was extremely powerful. It was so real that he had no choice but to believe in it. Slowly, he chose to stop with a pained expression. He\u2026 did not dare to take the risk!Chen Chong had a grave expression. It was an expression that was rare on him. He stood at the 561st step and looked at the 562nd step. He was silent for a long time. Some time ago, he had heard of the story regarding this step\u2026After a moment, Chen Chong gritted his teeth and walked towards it. Yet the moment his feet landed on the step, his entire body seemed to freeze and he stood there, dumbstruck. His eyes were empty and blank. Time passed by, and after seven breaths, Chen Chong coughed out a huge mouthful of blood and fell between the 561st and 562nd step. In the end, he did not manage to pass the test of the heart that existed on that step.Yet compared to Bi Su, Chen Chong had the heart and mind that could turn him into a powerful Berserker!The field was in dead silence. There were no discussions, no commotion. All of the people were breathing rapidly as they looked at the ranks on the eagle statues. The shock in their hearts replaced all thoughts in their minds.1st: Ye Wang, 803 steps.2nd: Mo Su, 563 steps.Those two lines garnered all their attention. Mo Su was just a normal name that no one had heard before the test. Yet now, his name was famous!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTime passed by gradually. That night was bound to be extraordinary. It was bound to be even more stunning than the previous night. That night was bound to belong to the two people in the mountain for their final battle!There was no one who was growing impatient in the field. In the midst of their silence, they waited. They waited for the moment that the both of them would move! When midnight passed by and there was only a small amount of time left before dawn, the number of steps behind Mo Su\u2019s name on the nine eagle statues changed!The weather did not change, neither did the wind blow once he moved. Yet the moment he did so, his movements turned into a storm that raged within the hearts of all those who were watching!Translator Notes[1] The one that moved is my mind! : In this case Su Ming is describing an optical illusion and perspective here, but since it\u2019s impossible for them to know what an optical illusion is, the word is not includedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were only three blood veins left on his body! He lowered his head and looked at the three blood veins on his chest before standing up.He took a deep breath but did not rush forward. He turned his head and looked at the thick mist behind him. He could not see the ground below, but he could feel that he was standing at a very high place.\u2018I might need to go to the 781st step to make the final three blood veins disappear.\u2019Su Ming looked at the summit, and his eyes gradually lit up.\u2018Also, I want to see just how far can I go!\u2019Su Ming raised his foot and moved towards the 564th step. Once he stood there, he walked further upwards one step at a time without hesitation!He moved forwards one step at a time. Su Ming no longer moved along the stairs with that maddening speed from before, where he managed to climb up around a hundred steps within the span of a few breaths. Yet there was no hint of stopping within him as he walked forward steadily at a moderate pace.He was calm, and he exuded an air of calmness that seemed like he was the water within an ancient well that would not ripple even when stones were thrown into it. Gradually and slowly, he moved towards the 573th step, 578th, 582th\u2026 and he continued onward.As he pressed onward, all his blood veins surfaced on his skin. A great presence of Qi exploded from his body. At the same time, as he continued steadily onward, another blood vein manifested!This path was the path of a strong Berserker that belonged to Su Ming. It was an incredibly important stage of metamorphosis in his life! It was a change in his training and understanding of his soul!Every step Su Ming took was turned into figures shown on the number of steps he took on the eagle statues in the field. Every single time the numbers jumped, the people who were watching would feel as if their hearts jumped along with it.\u201c597, 598, 599\u2026 600! He\u2019s at the 600th step! That was Ye Wang\u2019s limit yesterday!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still going on. 601, 602\u2026 Could Ye Wang not have noticed him? He may be further away, but if this continues, then before long, Mo Su will catch up to him!\u201dDue to Mo Su\u2019s movements, the quiet field was gradually filled with sounds of discussion. Yet compared to the commotion on the previous night, most of the discussions were held in low voices and whispers.Compared to the crowd that had been watching the first stage since the beginning, there were still some people in the field made up of those who were ranked within the top fifty. There were also some people who were ranked within the top ten, and they had formed their own cliques.\u201cYe Wang must be feeling prideful\u2026 He always had a habit to not look at the ranking.\u201d\u201cWell, Ye Wang always believed that the only one who could compete against him was himself. No one else had the ability to do so.\u201d\u201cHaha. I wonder whether Mo Su will have the ability to become his opponent this time. He\u2019s already at the 645th step. That Mo Su is really good, though. I can\u2019t compare to his potential!\u201d\u201cHonestly, I\u2019d really want Ye Wang to look at the plate. I\u2019d like to see his reaction once he knows about Mo Su following close behind his back. Would he turn his nose against him? Or will he become slightly excited?\u201dThe two different crowds in the field talked about different things. Compared to them, there was a crowd in the field that was formed of people of even higher statuses. They were all the leaders of different tribes. Their status and power determined their social standing.The old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe looked at Mo Su\u2019s name on the eagle statue. Her eyes were gradually clouded with seriousness and mindfulness. She did not know who that person was, but she admired him nonetheless. From what she could presume, no matter which tribe Mo Su belonged to, it could not be from Wind Stream. If that was the case, then it would be interesting once that person appeared in the field.\u2018It\u2019s a pity he\u2019s not from Dark Dragon Tribe, or else I\u2019d do everything I can to aid him in his training!\u2019 the old woman lamented, looking at Bai Ling and Si Kong beside her.\u2018Si Kong isn\u2019t the type who can take on large responsibilities. Ah, Dark Dragon Tribe is falling\u2026 As for Bai Ling, she only has a passing fancy towards that Su Ming. She still can\u2019t differentiate between gratitude and affection. But as long as she doesn\u2019t mingle around that rascal, then time will naturally make her forget about him.\u2018What right does that Su Ming have to approach my granddaughter? Unless, of course, he is that mysterious Mo Su\u2026\u2019The old woman gave a self-depreciating laugh, and a hint of mockery appeared in her eyes.Located further away was the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe. His face was dark as he stared at Mo Su\u2019s name on the eagle statue. His gaze was cold, yet at the same time, there was mindfulness and shock within his eyes.\u2018Bi Su was taught by the Elder since he was young and has surpassed those among his generation by leaps and bounds. If it wasn\u2019t because the Elder had reached a breakthrough and could now stand at the same position as Wind Stream\u2019s Jing Nan, then he wouldn\u2019t have let Bi Su appear.\u2018But where did that Mo Su come from? Which tribe does he belong to\u2026? I must bring him to the tribe, or else I\u2019ll just have to kill him!\u2019If anyone were to compare social ranking, then no one else\u2019s status was higher than Jing Nan\u2019s in the field. He stood there and looked at the ranking on the eagle statue. He watched as the figures showing the number of steps taken increased continuously behind Mo Su\u2019s name. The number had now reached 677. His pupils shrank in anticipation, but his face remained passive. It was as if what had happened was still not enough to shock him.\u201cMo Sang, once Su Ming finishes the test, let him stay in Wind Stream Tribe\u2026 This place will be more beneficial to him,\u201d Jing Nan spoke slowly as he watched the number of steps taken change once again and become 684.Once he heard Jing Nan\u2019s words, Mo Sang only smiled faintly. He was also shocked inwardly that Su Ming could obtain such a great result. This had completely exceeded his expectations, but there was a reason why he told Su Ming to not worry about revealing his power in the first place.\u201cDon\u2019t be anxious. We can talk about this once the test ends,\u201d Mo Su spoke unhurriedly. There was love and kindness within his eyes as he looked at Mo Su\u2019s name on the eagle statue.When he saw that Mo Sang did not immediately reject his proposal, a flash passed through Jing Nan\u2019s eyes. With his level of intelligence, it was only natural that he knew that the conditions he proposed to obtain Su Ming would not be enough.\u201cIf he can go past 750 steps, then I will give him the treatment only the son of a tribe leader deservers in Wind Stream Tribe like Chen Chong and Wu Sen. If he can go past 800 steps, then he\u2019ll become a candidate for my Berserker\u2019s Son!\u201d Jing Nan spoke slowly.\u201cWhat if he goes higher?\u201d Mo Sang turned around and looked at Jing Nan.\u201cHigher? Alright. If he can climb more than 850 steps, then I\u2019ll give him the same privileges and help I provide for Ye Wang. If he can go to the 900th step, then if he agrees to join Wind Stream Tribe, between him and Ye Wang, I\u2019ll elect whosoever reaches Awakening Realm first as my Berserker\u2019s Son!\u201d Jing Nan fell into momentary silence and looked at Mo Sang before he spoke slowly.\u201cHe\u2019s already at the 700th step.\u201d Mo Sang smiled faintly.700! Su Ming panted harshly as sweat fell continuously off his body onto the stairs. He stood on the 700th step. Dawn was about to arrive, and the moon was starting to darken. Moving forward under this pressure was incredibly hard.A few more blood veins appeared on his body once he arrived at the 700th step. Su Ming did not see how many blood veins had emerged. There was only one thought in his mind, he would continue walking forward until he reached his limit!He let his breathing calm down a bit. Su Ming lifted his foot once again and moved towards the 701st step.Ye Wang was sitting on the 803rd step unmoving at that moment. The entire mountain was very quiet. He was at the southern side of the mountain while Su Ming was at the northern side. They were on two different parts of the mountain.When dawn was about to arrive and the moon started to darken as if daylight was about to arrive at any moment, Ye Wang opened his eyes and looked at the moon.\u201cOnce daylight is here, I\u2019ll begin my last charge. This time, I\u2019ll do my best to get to the 900th step!\u201d Ye Wang mumbled as a confident smile appeared on his lips.\u2018I\u2019m pretty certain that there aren\u2019t many people left on the mountain. There should be less than ten, not including myself. I wonder if there\u2019s anyone who managed to make it through the 562nd step. But there shouldn\u2019t be any!\u2019There was a calm pride on Ye Wang\u2019s face, but after a moment of silence, he still chose to take out the plate and look.He had initially planned to just take a glance at it to see how many people were left on the mountain. It was just an action of someone who was looking down on other people\u2019s actions as he waited for daylight to arrive.His face was calm as his gaze fell upon the plate. He was just going to take a glance. Yet just as he was about to avert his gaze, he was suddenly stupefied. He looked at the plate once again, this time with concentration.2nd: Mo Su, 716 steps.\u2018Mo Su\u2026 he\u2019s walking at night? What an idiot!\u2019Ye Wang was quiet for a while, then he looked away from the plate. He closed his eyes and continued meditating calmly as he waited for daylight to arrive. There was not an ounce of panic within him, but there was a light and almost unnoticeable tremble on his eyelids, almost as if they betrayed that it was difficult for him to truly calm down.Mo Su\u2019s breathing was rapid as he continued walking forward. His mind was blank, and there was only a sort of willpower pushing his body forward, making him continue to walk forth. The blood veins on his body gradually increased. With the addition of each blood vein, he would have additional strength to go on.With that frenzied pace he put on, he walked past the 725th step, 738th step, 751st step, 763rd step, 779th step\u2026The thunderous roars continued with no signs of stopping in his body, but his legs were trembling, and his body seemed to be swaying. It was especially so for his feet, which seemed to have gotten glued to the mountain. Every single time he lifted his legs, pain would shoot through his entire body.He gritted his teeth and let out a low growl. Su Ming lifted his leg once again and moved towards the 780th step. There was only one more step away from his target this time \u2013 the 781st step!His eyes were bloodshot. The red within his eyes was like a fire burning and crackling, as if it was about to burn Su Ming\u2019s entire body to ashes. There was only one more step left right before his eyes. All the blood veins started circulating within Su Ming\u2019s body with a loud sound and squeezed out a bit of strength for Su Ming to lift his leg and move to the 781st step.The moment his feet were about to land on the step, his body seemed to be unable to bear the pressure any longer. Just as he was about to break down, Su Ming lifted his head and roared towards the sky. He must make it there! He had to!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe lifted his right hand and bit into his index finger. Fresh blood flowed out of the wound, and he swiped it on his eyes abruptly. He will begin the third burning of his blood here, the one that he had not managed to complete successfully!The moment the blood on his index finger touched his left eye, the entire mountain seemed to move as if the sky had collapsed and the earth had been split apart! At that instant, the roar from the beast suddenly reverberated from within the black mist on the mountain!Ye Wang, who finally calmed down on the 803rd step, jolted at that moment. He heard the roar from the top of the mountain and felt the entire mountain shaking and roaring as well. An unbelievable change had happened.He opened his eyes abruptly, and his pupils shrank instinctively. He had a feeling that the mountain\u2019s sudden change was linked to that person called Mo Su!Without any hesitation, he immediately took out the plate and took another look at it. The moment he read that Mo Su had taken 781 steps, Ye Wang\u2019s expression changed and he stood up abruptly!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had his own dignity and pride. To him, there was no one who could be his opponent. The one that he wanted to compete against was himself!Yet all his pride was shaken the moment the mountain roared and shook. It was as if at that instant a strong and unimaginable presence surged from the surroundings, shaking Ye Wang\u2019s heart.He could not remain steady, but neither could he ignore it. He stared at the plate in his hands. Never in his life had he been so aware and taken so much notice of someone!This person had far surpassed Wu Sen, Chen Chong, and everyone else besides Ye Wang himself. Now, he was only twenty odd steps away from him. This sort of distance had aroused a sense of pressure and anxiety that was rarely seen and nearly nonexistent within Ye Wang!\u2018Mo Su\u2026 Can you qualify to be my rival?\u2019There was a cold glint within Ye Wang\u2019s eyes. Anyone who would meet that cold look would feel the pride of one not allowing anyone to surpass him.Ye Wang was prideful and aloof. Since young, he surpassed all his peers with his incredible talent and stood at the top. He was also the Berserker\u2019s Son within Wind Stream Tribe. His status within the tribe could be seen by how people treated him when they saw him.He did not need to form cliques with other people, nor did he need to be enigmatic, or be surrounded by other people and revered, because no matter where he went, he would automatically destroy all those cliques. As long as he was there, he would become the brightest existence within the crowd. If he was in the area, then his brilliance would outshine even the most admired person!He was Ye Wang! He looked down on all his peers, or perhaps more accurately speaking, he did not look down on them. He was simply indifferent towards them, ignoring their existence. He was indifferent towards all his peers because he believed that no one had the right to make him notice them and become his opponent!Yet now, with Su Ming\u2019s appearance, for the first time in his life, Ye Wang had the feeling that he found his opponent, and the rare sight of him paying attention to something came to be!\u2018Then\u2026 let\u2019s compete against each other!\u2019Ye Wang took in a deep breath. He may have looked as if he was gradually returning to his normal state of mind, but he was unable to calm down. If he was truly calm, then he could have waited until daylight before he started moving towards the top of the mountain. This was his plan beforehand.Yet with Su Ming\u2019s appearance, this plan changed! This was the first time in Ye Wang\u2019s life that he changed his original plans due to someone around his age.With a swing of his sleeve, Ye Wang lifted his feet with a serious look on his face as he walked towards the 804th step. The moment his footsteps landed, his body trembled and his breathing became a bit swifter. Yet, he did not stop. He continued onwards.At that moment, Su Ming stood on the 781st step. His right hand was trembling. The moment his blood touched his right eye, he felt the entire mountain trembling. He felt the strange aura that came from all around Black Flame Mountain expand by leaps and bounds in this place. This was not something that the tiny Black Flame Mountain could compare. It was just a tiny bit of blood, but the aura that erupted forth far surpassed the amount when he finished covering his eyes with blood the second time in Black Flame Mountain.The black mist in the entire mountain started rolling forth violently at that instant. The moment it seemed like a wild beast roared towards the sky from the top of the mountain, and the thunderous roars echoed madly within the mountain, the mist started rolling even more furiously, causing the entire mountain to seem to be alive with excitement.Wisps of air quickly surged into Su Ming\u2019s body, causing him to tremble violently, and the sensation as if he was about to explode surged forward once again.Su Ming had once felt the force of the sensation when he previously tried the third burning of his blood, yet the force had become much stronger than before. A trickle of blood appeared at the corner of his mouth. His right hand trembled, and he had no choice but to put it down.The moment he placed his hand down, the roars from within the mountain stopped, and the mist returned to its calm state. The strange aura coming from all around him also disappeared without a trace.Everything returned to a state of calmness. It was as if that scene had only been an illusion, and it had never happened.Su Ming panted harshly and stood on the 781st step. He looked at the summit before him, but did not sit down. He chose to close his eyes while standing instead, and used the very last step with the balanced pressure among the numbers the elder told him to begin refining his body!At that moment, an incredible uproar stirred up a wave of discussions within the field located under the foot of the mountain. Due to the seal, they did not sense the incredible sight that happened within the mountain just moments ago.They only saw the rankings on the nine eagle statues. They saw the person called Mo Su reach the 781st step, and there was only twenty something steps left between him and Ye Wang, who was in first place. The shock they felt stemming from within their hearts, and the looks filled with disbelief and dazedness in their eyes lashed against their bodies, causing their minds to become blank. They were reduced to a state where they could only let out cries of shock.They even saw Ye Wang moving! Among the hundreds of people in the field, there were a large portion of them who did not think too much into why Ye Wang decided to continue moving up the mountain. They only thought that Ye Wang should have been moving in the first place. If they were in his place, then they would surely get up from their rest and continue moving.However, the small circle that consisted of all the prodigies from Wind Stream Tribe ranked within the top fifty were familiar with Ye Wang. Their understanding towards Ye Wang was much better than the rest of the people\u2019s in the field. Once they saw the number behind Ye Wang\u2019s name change, the shock they felt in their hearts was much greater than of those who were not familiar with him.\u201cYe Wang\u2026 looked at the plate!\u201d\u201cHe must have looked at the place. With his personality, once he looked at the plate, he should have felt indifferent towards him, but Mo Su is just too amazing. Even Ye Wang can\u2019t remain calm because of him!\u201d\u201cHe changed his rhythm. Once Ye Wang makes a decision, he won\u2019t change it easily. He must have been thinking about waiting until daylight before he started moving, but now, because of Mo Su, he changed his plans!\u201dWu Sen\u2019s face was pale as he sat far away in a corner. He looked at Mo Su\u2019s name on the eagle statue and remained silent. He had been treating Bi Su as his main suspect earlier, but now, he felt that Mo Su might be the real person he should be suspecting\u2026 But\u2026\u2018This is just the first stage. We don\u2019t compete on our strengths in this stage, but our potential. From what I can tell, it\u2019s not as if I don\u2019t have a way to get a definite answer as to who stole my Blood either\u2026\u2019Wu Sen clenched his fists.There were also the leaders of all the other tribes on the field who were staring at the eagle statues and the ranking. They all had their own thoughts, but the only thing that was similar was how they had similar looks of cold detachment as they watched Wind Stream make a fool of themselves. After all, since the past, forget the top three, there had never been any outsider who managed to make it into the top thirty, much less the top ten ranks in the test.Yet now, not only were there two outsiders who made it into the top 10, but by the looks of it, that person called Mo Su might very well have the ability to compete for first place!While this made them shocked, it also made them laugh within their hearts.\u2018Mo Su\u2026 Mo Su\u2026 just which tribe do you belong to..? Why is it that there has never been such a person that appeared in my tribe\u2026 If you\u2019re willing to join my tribe, then no matter what price I have to pay, I\u2019d be willing to negotiate with you\u2026\u2019 the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe lamented, but she also knew that it was impossible.The Head of the Guards was astounded as he stood among those from Dark Mountain Tribe. He let out a huge breath, and he harbored a similar thought as the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe.Bei Ling, who stood beside him, had a hint of extreme passion within his eyes. He looked at Mo Su\u2019s name. He knew of everything that happened during the first stage of the test. The strongest person he could get in touch to was Wu Sen. Yet right before his eyes, he saw a stranger manage to obtain the second place and even earn the right to compete for first place. This was something that made him extremely excited.\u201cThis Mo Su is very strong!\u201d Bei Ling spoke softly.\u201cThat\u2019s right. He\u2019s really amazing. I wonder which tribe he belongs to\u2026 Ah, it\u2019s a pity he\u2019s not from our tribe\u2026\u201d There was admiration within Wu La\u2019s eyes. She admired powerful people, especially Mo Su. She saw him rise since the beginning. That sort of feeling, as if she saw the scene personally, made her addicted with it.\u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2026 this\u2026 Mo Su\u2019s name, is a bit familiar\u2026?\u201d Lei Chen hesitated for a moment and spoke since the first time he came back.\u201cFamiliar? Lei Chen, what do you mean?\u201d Wu La was momentarily taken aback and turned to look at him.\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m thinking too much\u2026 I just thought that the elder\u2019s name is Mo Sang, and this person\u2019s name is Mo Su\u2026 No matter how I look at it, it seems like it\u2019s the combination of the elder and Su Ming\u2019s names\u2026\u201d Lei Chen scratched his head and there was uncertainty in his eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much!\u201d There was a hint of scorn in Wu La\u2019s eyes, and she turned her head away to ignore Lei Chen, choosing instead to look at the ranking on the eagle statues.\u201cMo Su, why aren\u2019t you moving? Ye Wang is already at the 827th step!\u201dBei Ling did not speak, but the faint hint of disdain in his eyes showed his thoughts towards what Lei Chen had said.Lei Chen fell silent.As the people were discussing and looking at the ranks, the air twisted and suddenly two wisps of black mist appeared and travelled to the field before turning into Chen Chong and Bi Su. They arrived almost simultaneously on the field, and they immediately glared at each other when they saw the other.When they returned, the people around them immediately cast their eyes on them. They also caught the attention of Wind Stream Tribe\u2019s Jing Nan and Mo Sang who were located at the further end of the field.\u201cChen Chong is pretty good,\u201d Mo Sang spoke, smiling faintly.\u201cCompared to Su Ming, he\u2019s not much.\u201d Jing Nan still looked calm, but he had been inwardly astounded since a long time ago. He may have been somewhat expecting this for some time now, but he did not expect Su Ming to surpass his expectations so much and manage to reach this point.\u201cMo Sang, let me take care of Su Ming!\u201d Jing Nan turned his head and looked at Mo Sang as he spoke seriously.\u201cLet\u2019s continue watching. We can talk later,\u201d Mo Su smiled and said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt that moment, a cry of surprise rose abruptly. At the very instant someone shouted within the field, everyone noticed the change.\u201cMo Su\u2019s finally moving!\u201d\u201cThis is the final battle!\u201dWithin the mountain shrouded by black mist, Su Ming stood on the 781st step with his eyes closed. He opened them suddenly, and a bright glint flashed briefly through his eyes.There were only two blood veins left on his body!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I have two blood veins left. The two blood veins seem to be stuck together. I can\u2019t make them disappear separately\u2026\u201d Su Ming muttered softly.\u201cBut this is the last number\u2026 This mountain can be said to be a holy training ground. Once I leave, it\u2019ll be very difficult to find a chance like this again\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s brows gradually creased.\u201c32, 79, 248, 371, 563, 781\u2026 These are the six numbers the elder told me. This should be the secret the elder discovered during his time here, but\u2026 perhaps after the 781st step, there is another, or maybe multiple places like these\u2026 Those are the places that even the elder didn\u2019t discover\u2026\u201d Determination gradually appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes.After falling into momentarily silence, Su Ming looked at the plate in his hands and at the rank he got. That rank made him so excited it seemed as if his Qi was about to start circulating around his body then and there.\u2018Second\u2026\u2019He retrieved his gaze from the plate and lowered his head. After eventually calming down, a thoughtful look appeared in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve already attained my wish, now\u2026 I can give up\u2026\u201d As Su Ming mumbled, there was hesitation in his eyes.\u201cBut once I give up, then the training with fine control will be stuck in this state, and I will never complete it\u2026 There must be a similar stage up there that has the same balanced pressure!\u201d Su Ming did not hesitate for long. He did not want to give up this chance. He knew that the tribe was in danger and felt the elder\u2019s worry. He had to become stronger!\u201cI cannot miss this chance. I have to find the place that the elder did not discover!\u201d The hesitation in Su Ming\u2019s eyes immediately turned into determination and resolution. He lifted his legs and abruptly moved towards the 782nd step!The moment his foot landed, Su Ming immediately trembled. A strong and great pressure fell upon his body. As he trembled, a large amount of blood veins appeared on his body with a force akin to an explosion. The light from the blood veins scattered everywhere and seemed to resonate with the dimming moon in the sky. It caused Su Ming to growl, and he gritted his teeth as he continued onwards.783, 784, 785\u2026 when he reached the 796th step, Su Ming\u2019s hair was in a mess, and his body trembled in a manner akin to convulsing. Each step he took seemed to take all his strength. His entire body was in extreme pain as if he was about to break under the incredible pressure. The feeling that he was about to break was completely different from the sensation of the burning of his blood.The burning of blood was a force that burst forth from within his body, as if he could no longer contain the energy. Yet now, the pressure from the mountain was a force pressing against him from outside as if it was trying to crush his body.The blood veins were fighting against the pressure nonstop as the Qi in his body circulated, supporting his body so that he would not be crushed to pieces. His resistance towards the pressure also increased due to the nourishment provided by the moonlight.With each step he took, a trickle of blood began leaking out from the corner of his mouth. His face began twisting into a furious expression, but within that viciousness was a shocking amount of resolution and determination.\u2018I have to find that spot! I have to complete fine control!\u2019Su Ming took another step and arrived at the 799th step. At this moment, his vision was beginning to become fuzzy, and he seemed to be unable to take another step.Ye Wang also looked quite pathetic. He was panting harshly, and his hair was a mess. There were veins popping on his face, and his blood veins surfaced on the skin all over his body. He struggled up the 837th step when a dull pain started in his chest. The rapid beating of his heart made him feel faint.Yet the moment he looked at the plate, there was madness within his eyes.\u201cMo Su!\u201d Ye Wang lifted his head suddenly and growled towards the sky. He lifted his feet again and moved, but his speed had obviously slowed.Su Ming tried five times, but no matter what, he could not lift his feet. It was as if a pair of giant hands pressed against his body, causing his entire body to be in great pain. It was as if his bones were about to be crushed. He could not lift his feet!The invisible pair of giant hands were merciless and apathetic as they pressed against Su Ming, causing him to be unable to stand straight, and eventually his body started to bend. He was unable to continue standing and seemed to begin falling downwards.Su Ming\u2019s face was ashen, and sweat fell nonstop from his body. The dizziness became stronger, and a sense of powerlessness appeared in his heart. He struggled to lift his head slightly, looking at the dimming moon and the vast sky.\u2018Wherefore doth thou cry, o blue sky?\u2019Gradually, these words echoed in his head. He laughed suddenly. That bark of laughter only served to make the pain in his body stronger, but within Su Ming\u2019s eyes, the blood red moon became even clearer, and it erupted with a blazing fire.\u201cI won\u2019t give up!\u201d Su Ming lifted his head and roared suddenly. That roar echoed, reflecting the source of why he could suddenly rise up through the ranks. As he roared, Su Ming struggled to lift up his right hand and bit into it once again. There was madness within his eyes and once again, he wiped the blood on his left eye.The moment he spread his blood over his eye, the entire mountain moved abruptly. The mist rolled forward like furious waves and billows of air erupting forth from the entire Wind Stream Mountain, like endless waves from all around the mountain towards Su Ming.There was also the sound of a wild beast roaring suddenly at the top of the mountain at that moment. The roar was like an illusion that echoed through the entire mountain and reached into Su Ming and Ye Wang\u2019s hearts!Su Ming coughed out a mouthful of blood. Countless strange gusts of air entered his body and caused banging sounds to echo in his blood as his blood veins increased once again. He roared and gradually straightened his bent body as he resisted the pressure from the invisible pair of hands until he stood up straight!The pressure from the hands seemed to be unable to suppress the endless amount of air entering Su Ming\u2019s body and was also unable to suppress the power of the burning of his blood under the moonlight!Su Ming stood up!It was dawn. The moon, which should have been dimming away, seemed to give out its last glow at that moment. It suddenly looked clear in the sky, and as Su Ming stood up, he took a step forward abruptly and moved towards the 800th step, then took another few steps forward without stopping!802, 805, 811, 814, 817!He stood on the 817th step with bloodshot eyes. The blood in his veins seemed to be burning. He was halfway through the third burning of his blood. He had only managed to smear half of his left eye with blood.There was an explosive force within his body that was bursting forth. His entire body seemed to be on the verge of breaking down and exploding. Su Ming knew that if he used external strength and forcefully commenced with the third burning of his blood, he would definitely be unable to take it. Yet within this mountain, there was a great pressure, and it aided him. With his body as the centre, there was an explosive force coming from within his body, and there was an oppressive force pressing against his body, causing him to obtain a chance to complete the third burning that he had been unable to finish!Su Ming\u2019s right index finger trembled. He let out a roar as he did so and smeared his entire left eye with fresh blood, and the burning of blood started!The entire mountain trembled. More strange gusts of air rushed forward maddeningly and entered into Su Ming from every pore of his body rapidly, causing the number of blood veins on his body to increase at an incredible pace.\u2018I have to go up!\u2019Su Ming lifted his feet and moved forward once again. 819, 823, 827\u2026 When he reached the 839th step, blood red mist gushed out from his body, but there was only perseverance and determination in his eyes!He did not find the balance he was looking for among all the steps he had taken so far, but Su Ming believed that there must definitely be such a place on the remaining steps!\u2018Mo Su!\u2019Ye Wang was also in a frenzied state. He was at the 845th step at that moment. When the plate showed that Mo Su took 839th step, how could he not be mad?As the best among his peers, his pride did not allow anyone to surpass him. His dignity insisted that no matter the cost, he had to maintain his position as the most powerful person!Veins popped out on his face and his eyes were completely bloodshot. The aloof and prideful look was no longer on his face, having turned into an expression of fury and vexation. He lifted his right hand in a struggle and roared as he hit his chest. Immediately, a large amount of power surged through his entire body. At the same time, the power travelled through all parts of his flesh and bones, a blood red mark appearing on his chest.It was a horn, a blood red horn that belonged to a wild beast!The horn was a picture. It was not bright red but was slightly dark in color. As Ye Wang hit his chest with his palm, the horn immediately glowed with a piercing red light and fused into Ye Wang\u2019s body. It caused his entire body to gain new strength. He lifted his legs and rushed forward!845, 846\u2026 and he continued right until he stood on the 861st step. Ye Wang coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood. The red light from the horn picture on his chest also faded away until the color became even dimmer, as if it was about to fade away at any moment.\u2018Mo Su, you can be proud now! You are the only one who has managed to force me to activate the Mark of Calamity the Elder forcefully drew for me with thirty-seven drops of his Blood of Calamity so that I could absorb it and improve my chances of arriving at Awakening Realm exponentially! I did not want to use this power forcefully. This has no benefit for me, and it would be much better if I just absorbed it slowly\u2026 Mo Su, you can be proud now!\u2019Ye Wang gritted his teeth and lowered his head to look at the plate as he panted. With just one glance, he widened his eyes.\u201cIm\u2026 Impossible!\u201dThe number behind Mo Su\u2019s name was increasing rapidly!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu841, 843, 845, 849\u2026 Right before his eyes, Ye Wang saw the number change to 859!There were only two steps between them! Ye Wang had forcefully absorbed the Blood of Calamity, yet not only did he not widen the distance between them, they had even become this close. However, if he did not make the decision to absorb the blood, then perhaps he would have been overtaken by now!\u201cImpossible!\u201d There was disbelief and shock in Ye Wang\u2019s eyes. He mumbled and lifted his right hand once again. Within that gesture was a hint of ruthlessness and madness as he pressed his palm on the dim picture of the horn on his chest.He coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood, but a blood red glow that reached the sky burst forth from Ye Wang\u2019s entire body. Only the faint outline of his body remained as he was encompassed by the blood-red glow.\u201cMo\u2026 Su!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Su Ming activated the burning of his blood, while Ye Wang forcefully absorbed his elder\u2019s Berserker Blood. All this was unknown to most of the people gathered in the field under the foot of the mountain.At that moment, as the battle reached its most intense state, the mood among the people within the field also reached its peak!\u201cWhat an intense battle! This is what I call a true intense battle!\u201d\u201cYe Wang managed to reach the 861st step from the 845th step, but Mo Su is also chasing close behind him. He actually managed to close up the distance between him and Ye Wang to only two steps once he reached the 859th step from the twenty to thirty odd steps between them just now!\u201d\u201cJust who among them will be number one?!\u201dDiscussions, roars, and cries of surprise stirred up continuously within the field. The people were filled with excitement and anticipation. At that moment, they had already ignored all the complicated feelings within them. There was only one thought within their minds. They wanted to know who would be the first at the end of the match!Who will be the first?This question also stirred up a storm among the circle formed by the prodigies ranked within the top 50. They were as excited as the people around them. The more they were familiar with Ye Wang and the more knowledge they had towards the terrors of the pressure among the steps in the 800s, the more excited they were.\u201cYe Wang has managed to place first multiple times. This time\u2026 can he retain his position?\u201d\u201cThis Mo Su, he\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s just too strong! He actually managed to push Ye Wang to this state. There\u2019re only two steps between them now!\u201d\u201cI thought that Ye Wang would definitely be the most powerful of us all within the region Wind Stream Tribe rules, and no one would be able to compare to him, but now\u2026 I know that I\u2019ve underestimated outsiders!\u201dCompared to these people, the leaders from all the other tribes had all stood up and were staring at the eagle statues. Their faces were not just filled with shock, but amazement and astonishment!\u2018Just which tribe does this Mo Su belong to?\u2018Who is this child?\u2018If he can truly surpass Ye Wang, then Wind Stream\u2019s shock will be great!\u2018No matter what rank Mo Su obtains, from here on, there won\u2019t be anyone who will not know his name!\u2019Bei Ling clenched his fists in excitement. There was a roaring sound in his heart. He wanted Mo Su to win! Wu La\u2019s face was also flushed with excitement. She had already stood up since a long time ago and was staring at the competition between the first and second places!Chen Chong too, was staring at Mo Su\u2019s name with a dumbfounded expression. At that moment, if someone would have told him that before the start of the first stage, Mo Su was among the group of people that went to him and watched him laugh with his friends and walk towards Bai Ling, Chen Chong would have definitely not believed it!Bi Su clenched his fists and stared at the eagle statue. There was anger and maddening jealousy in his eyes. He still believed that Mo Su\u2019s glory should have belonged to him. That damn Mo Su stole it away from him!Located far in a corner of the field was Jing Nan. His expression was no longer blank but shocked. He was also taken aback by the sight. He looked at the name on the eagle statue and watched as Ye Wang suddenly rose up the stairs quickly. He could even tell that Ye Wang must have forcefully absorbed his Berserker Blood.\u2018Just where\u2026 did Su Ming come from? What is his origin..? He\u2026 How could he have so much potential?\u2019Jing Nan took in a deep breath. He could no longer hide the shock in his eyes.\u201cMo Sang, is he\u2026 truly a prince of the Great Yu Dynasty?\u201d Jing Nan hesitated for a moment before he asked softly.Mo Sang smiled faintly, but he did not speak. In truth, he was unable to calm down either. There was already a storm raging in his heart.At the same time within the mountain, the mist was rolling forward and the mountain was trembling. The roars travelling from the top of the mountain were becoming clearer. It was as if there was a message hidden within the roars.Su Ming trembled. There was madness on his face. His right index finger was pressed against his right eye. Half of his right eye was already smeared with blood!The difficulty of the third burning of blood exceeded Su Ming\u2019s expectations. He did not expect that he had yet to complete it even though he was here, in this place where there was a great pressure aiding him.The previous two burnings could not even begin to compare to this time. It was as if the third burning of blood among the nine required times was a hurdle, an obstacle in his path!He stood at the 859th step. This was still not the place he was looking for. As he was going through the ritual of burning his blood, Su Ming felt as if his entire body had just gone up in flames. The blood in his body seemed to be experiencing some sort of change. It was as if it was changing rapidly from normal blood to fire!Su Ming had even considered giving up due to the pain in his body and the oppression from the external world, but the moment he remembered the danger that loomed over the tribe and the worry on the elder\u2019s old and wizened face, Su Ming was willing to bear through all the pain!He had to become stronger. He wanted to help the elder. He wanted to protect his own home and his tribe! He wanted to help the tribe to kill its enemies. He would use his blood and tell his enemies that no one was allowed to touch Dark Mountain Tribe!Su Ming let out a roar as if letting out all his pain and suffering. While shouting, he continued sweeping his right index finger across his right eye slowly but surely, and resolutely!At that moment, no matter who it was that might want to stop Su Ming from protecting his tribe and his people, they would become his mortal enemy!His eyes felt as if there was a fire burning inside of them. Su Ming lifted his feet and walked forward with reckless steps\u2026 He moved from the 859th step to the 860th, 861st, 862nd, 863rd\u2026 right until he reached the 877th step!Blood mist gushed forth once more from his body. He\u2026 reached his limit!877. That was his limit. He could not continue any longer!\u201cLet mine blood burn!\u201d At the moment he reached his limit, Su Ming lifted his head towards the skies and roared. As the roar echoed through the skies, the moon let out the most brilliant ray of light, and without anyone seeing it, it fell from the sky and fused into Su Ming\u2019s body.The mountain underneath Su Ming\u2019s feet trembled. The mist billowed towards the skies with an intensity that had never happened before. It enveloped the entire area and seemed to be turning into a mysterious shape.It looked like a giant creature, but the shape was vague and could not be clearly seen.As the mountain was filled with tremors, the indescribable strange air erupted forth from the mountain. With Su Ming at the center, it rushed towards him at a rapid pace. The moment it entered his body, Su Ming completely dyed his right eye with the blood from his right index finger!The third burning of blood was completed!A loud boom resonated through Su Ming\u2019s body. All the blood veins in his body appeared, and the number began increasing by a large margin. As they manifested one by one, the strong presence within Su Ming\u2019s body became stronger.It was almost within an instant that the blood veins on Su Ming\u2019s body increased to 109! A thunderous roar rang within his body, and he broke through the fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm and reached the sixth level!The sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm!The blood veins were still increasing. As they manifested one by one, Su Ming lifted his feet and walked towards the 878th step with one swift moment. The instant his feet landed, the entire mountain trembled once more. The strange air continuously entered his body, and Su Ming went to the 879th step, continuing onwards!883, 885, 889\u2026 When he reached the 899th step, the blood veins on Su Ming\u2019s body increased to 156!It was as if all the Qi within his body had turned into flames. Like there was a fire within him strong enough to burn the sky and the earth. Yet within his eyes, the shadow of the blood red moon gradually disappeared and was hidden away. It was as if after the third burning of blood, the moon in his eyes reverted inwards and no longer revealed traces outward!Only now could Su Ming be considered to have mastered a little bit of the Fire Berserker Art! He lifted his feet and moved towards the 900th step. He stood there and looked forward. From his location, he could see the statue of a beast crouching at the top of the mountain not too far away.An indefinable feeling filled Su Ming\u2019s entire being. The statue of the beast looked like a tiger, but there was a huge pair of wings on its back. It was as if it was struggling to fly up, but was pinned down by numerous chains. He could sense an incredible grudge and a faint hint of bleakness from it.He looked at the statue and felt as if the statue was also looking at him. The man and the beast seemed to be staring at each other quietly while standing at the top of the mountain with nearly a hundred steps between them.After a long time, Su Ming closed his eyes. He could sense a familiar presence from the statue of the beast. That presence\u2026 belonged to the Fire Berserker \u2026That was a statue of a mythical beast from Fire Berserker Tribe!When he closed his eyes, Su Ming also found the spot he had been looking for. The 900th step was the seventh spot with the balanced pressure. He stood there. There were 156 blood veins on his body. They were quickly circulating with each heartbeat. As dawn was about to end and daylight about to arrive, Su Ming begun the final refining of his body.Ye Wang\u2019s hair was a mess. His face was filled with incredible madness. He would pound against his chest without hesitation before he even walking ten steps. The picture of the horn became fainter just as the red glow on his body became fainter. He walked forward without caring about the consequences. His pride and his dignity would not allow him to lose!881, 882\u2026 897, 899\u2026 Ye Wang pounded against his chest with his right hand. The picture of the horn dissipated with a loud sound. Once it completely disappeared, it turned into a final surge of energy that filled Ye Wang\u2019s entire body. It caused Ye Wang to roar and move towards the 900th step then continue onward until he reached the 905th step.The moment he reached it, Ye Wang coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood and slowly collapsed. The plate in his hands fell out. The moment it left his body, it turned into a gust of black mist that surrounded Ye Wang and disappeared from the mountain.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was only Su Ming left on the mountain!There was dead silence on the mountain. The field was also similarly silent. When Ye Wang appeared in the field, he was unconscious. As Jing Nan watched with a dark expression, some people automatically went forward and carried Ye Wang quickly to a corner to help him recover.There was only one name that had yet to turn grey on the nine eagle statues\u20262nd: Mo Su, 900 steps.Everyone waited\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Persevere!Translator:\u00a0Mogumoguchan\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0ZenobysThere were no longer any conversations in the field. At that moment, all the people within the field were breathing heavily as they watched the only name that had yet to turn grey on the nine eagle statues.Mo Su was only five steps away from first place!At that moment, Ye Wang, who was placed first, gradually opened his eyes under the help of Shi Hai and the others. There were still some traces of red in his eyes as he stared at the ranking on the eagle statue nearby with a complicated look on his face.By his side, Shi Hai lowered his head, seemingly talking to Ye Wang, but Ye Wang ignored him as if he did not hear a word. He simply stared at the ranks on the eagle statue.Shi Hai frowned and sighed before he turned away and left.\u2018I am Ye Wang\u2026 I won\u2019t lose! But I won\u2019t use any underhanded tricks to win!\u2019Ye Wang clenched his fists. At that moment, he was no longer the prideful strongest youth, but a normal tribe member who gave it his all and arrived at the 905th step, forced to retreat due to a sustained injury. The anxiety he felt was much stronger than of anyone else\u2019s within the field. Even so, he still had his pride and dignity. Shi Hai\u2019s suggestion was a form of humiliation to him!Amidst the silence, the sounds of breathing among the people became even clearer. It was especially so for those who treated Mo Su as an entertainment in the beginning. At that moment, their minds were blank, and there was only disbelief and shock left.They had just witnessed a miracle. They saw a person rising up with their own eyes. They saw something so insane it reduced them to a state of awe! Never had there been a person who managed to reach the top from the last place!Never had there been a person who surpassed Wu Sen, Bi Su, and Chen Chong, much less pushed Ye Wang until he was injured, forcing him to leave Wind Stream Tribe competition\u2019s first stage. Because of that, as of then, the mountain belonged to one person only \u2013 Mo Su!The prodigies who entered the top 50 ranks were now in a state of dead silence. They looked at Mo Su\u2019s name on the nine eagle statues silently with complicated expressions on their faces: admiration, jealousy, expectancy, and other emotions.The leaders from all the tribes were in the same state. There was nothing different in what they felt. Mo Su now held a very high position within their hearts. This person was bound to create a storm the moment he returned.Too many people wanted to know just who\u2026 he was\u2026 How did he look like..? Yet due to Su Ming\u2019s incredibly unassuming looks, it was rare that anyone would have taken note of his existence before the test.Even the man who pulled him along to meet Chen Chong was looking at the name on the eagle statue anxiously with excitement and anticipation.Only an old man with a sharp mouth and cheeks of a monkey stood in the crowd with a shocked expression. He was certain that every single time someone gave up and returned, he would be the first to see them. Yet at that moment, when everyone except Mo Su returned to the field, he discovered belatedly that among these people who came back, none of them were the young fellow he first approached.\u201cImpossible\u2026\u201d Bei Qing muttered. He looked at Mo Su\u2019s name on the eagle statue, still finding it hard within him to believe it.\u2018Could it\u2026 really be him?\u2019Mo Sang and Jing Nan did not speak to each other where they were at the corner located further away. They were quietly looking at the eagle statue. Mo Sang still had a blank expression on his face, but his heart was pounding rapidly against his chest.Jing Nan had witnessed Su Ming\u2019s entire progress. At that moment, the shock on his face could no longer be hidden. He did not expect that Su Ming, whose existence was akin to an ant earlier, who he did not think too highly of, and who he thought would be lucky to even get into the top 50, had time and again exceeded his expectations and delivered multiple surprises to him. Now, he had even reduced Jing Nan to a state of shock.Jing Nan thought about Su Ming\u2019s origins seriously. Mo Sang\u2019s words once again echoed in his head and made him more uncertain.A long time passed by, but there was no hint of impatience among the people in the field. They were all waiting. When the first rays of light appeared at the horizon and morning arrived, Su Ming opened his eyes where he stood on the 900th step. There was only one blood vein left on his body. As he opened his eyes, that blood vein disappeared.He lifted his head and looked at the top of the mountain, which was lit up by sunlight. It was a pity that it was shrouded by mist and was not clear as it had been during the night\u2026 Su Ming fell into momentary silence and looked at the plate in his hand.\u201c905\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled.\u201cSince I\u2019m already here\u2026 I might as well\u2026 compete against him!\u201d Su Ming lifted his head. His eyes were filled with determination. He took a deep breath of the refreshing air during the morning and moved his feet towards the 901st step.But it was already morning and there was no longer any moonlight. Su Ming felt the pressure falling upon him. Yet he was fortunate that the pressure had lessened greatly because it was day. He felt almost the same as he did when it was midnight.Yet even so, he was already at the 900s. He was already very near the summit. The force of the pressure here was enough to crush a person alive!One step in this place was akin to several dozens and even hundreds of steps at the lower parts of the stairs!The instant Su Ming\u2019s right foot landed, his entire body trembled. All 156 blood veins manifested on his body and surrounded him to resist against the maddening pressure coming towards him.Su Ming moved!The moment he moved, the people down in the field who had been waiting silently for a long period of time seemed to have finally found an outlet for their thoughts. The moment Su Ming moved, all their long stifled emotions were let out!\u201c901\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s at 901!\u201dNumerous pairs of eyes were focused on the only name that was not gray on the nine eagle statues. At that moment, they had forgotten everything, and in their eyes, in their heads, the only thing left was the one name that had yet to dim.Chen Chong trembled and took in a sharp breath. He stared at the ranking. This scene was definitely the climax of the test. It was in fact, much more intense and exciting than of any other previous times the test was held. He did not want to miss even a single moment of it.Bi Su clenched his fists. The cold glare in his eyes became thicker with hints of jealousy hidden within that seemed to have turned into a strong killing intent filled with resentment. The other person who had similar killing intent was the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe. He stared at Mo Su\u2019s name on the eagle statue with such a cold expression it was like ice that would never melt.902!The moment the number behind Mo Su\u2019s name turned into 902, all the hearts of the people watching in the field jumped.It was as if with each step Su Ming took, he was not just stepping on the stairs on the mountain, but he was also stomping on all the hearts of the people gathered down below. This was a rare sight. This alone meant that right then, Su Ming was regarded with great importance by the people. It was clear that each and every one of his actions could stir up their emotions!In the past, this was Ye Wang\u2019s glory and pride alone. Yet now, Ye Wang had turned into a bystander. He sat at a distance not too far away as he watched the changes in the number of steps Su Ming took, his heart lurching with each step taken.This sort of feeling was foreign to him, and it was an emotion that was\u2026 carved deep into his bones!\u201c903! He\u2019s at 903! There\u2019re only two steps left before he ties with Ye Wang. With three steps, he\u2019ll surpass Ye Wang and place first!\u201d\u201cCan he\u2026 become first\u2026?\u201dThe pupils of the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe shrank as her breathing became rapid. Bai Ling, who was by her side, was no longer daydreaming, but had her head lifted as she looked at Mo Su\u2019s name. Her brows were slightly crinkled.Shan Hen was still sitting quietly at the place where Dark Mountain Tribe was gathered. He may still be sitting, but there was a strange glint within his narrowed eyes.Bei Ling was in a state of excitement. With his current status within Dark Mountain Tribe, he would not have revealed such an expression so easily and had to make sure that he was always aloof, but at that moment, he could no longer suppress his excitement. He had even envisioned himself as Mo Su. That sort of thrill he felt as Mo Su surpassed the prodigy of Wind Stream Tribe was so thrilling it made him clench his fists.Wu La was even more excited than he was. Her face was completely red as she stood there with her heart pounding rapidly against her chest. She wanted to just jump up and tell Mo Su to walk faster.Lei Chen had already given up on wondering whether Mo Su was Su Ming. There were just too many uncertainties to it.\u201c903! Mo Su is at 903!\u201d Wu La was after all, still just a girl. At that moment, she was pointing at the name on the eagle statue excitedly. There was a flash of exhilaration in her eyes. There was even a strange emotion hidden faintly under that layer of excitement.An even stronger commotion stirred up within the field. While buzzing sounds echoed around, Ye Wang sat there with his legs crossed. His eyes were once again bloodshot. He clenched his fist tightly. It was difficult to use words to express the array of emotions within his heart at that moment.He was once the best among all. He once stood at the top and held all the attention and anticipation from the people in the field. Yet now\u2026 he had become one of the bystanders. That sort of change was difficult for him to accept.Even the cries of surprise and shock were like a knife stabbing and twisting into his chest, causing him great pain\u2026Su Ming stood at the 903rd step. He may have been standing straight, but his body was trembling as if he was about to fall at any moment. Despite it being day time, the pressure in the 900s was still unimaginably great.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe only took three steps forward, but Su Ming felt as if he had reached his limit. There was pain travelling through his entire body, and it was no longer pain that could be resisted by using the blood veins as a shield. There were moaning sounds echoing around his ears, and those sounds came from his bones, telling that they could no longer bear with the pressure.As he stood there, Su Ming panted harshly. His heart pounded as if it was about to break, and each heartbeat turned into a sharp pain that turned his face pale. There were only two more steps till 905\u2026There was no way he could rest here. Due to the presence of the pressure, even if he were to rest, it would be hard for him to circulate the Qi in his body. Su Ming trembled. He lifted his right foot and placed it on the 904th step.The moment his foot landed, a thunderous roar arose from his entire body. Su Ming coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood and his body seemed to fall, but he bore with it until he stood straight, then he moved his left foot towards the 904th step.His entire body felt weak. It was as if the entire mountain was pressing against his body. His vision swirled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked at Mo Su\u2019s name on the eagle statue silently. By his side, Mo Sang also kept quiet.At a further corner, Ye Wang\u2019s heart was pounding. He wanted to continue sitting, but his body had instinctively stood up as he stared intently at Mo Su\u2019s name on the eagle statue. He did not spare his attention to anything else.In fact, no one had paid attention to him when he stood up. At that moment, everyone\u2019s gazes were on the eagle statues and Mo Su\u2019s name.Anxiety, restraint, and silence formed a strange sort of force that covered the entire field like a layer of pressure that turned the place into what could only be called the true quiet!They were waiting for Su Ming to move one more step until he reached the 905th step\u2026Yet even after a long while, the number behind Mo Su did not change. However, all the people continued waiting. No one spoke, neither did anyone discuss among themselves. Even the sounds of their breathing had weakened\u2026After a while, the number behind Mo Su suddenly changed. The number turned from 904 to 905!The moment the change happened, the entire field erupted in an explosion of sound that shook the surroundings.\u201c905! He tied with Ye Wang!\u201d\u201cMo Su! Mo Su! Mo Su!\u201dYe Wang was pale. It was as if there was a great force that knocked into him, causing him to stagger backwards two steps. His eyes gradually became blank, and there was a wan smile on his lips.At the same time, the moment Su Ming arrived at the 905th step, his face also turned into a similar shade of white as Ye Wang\u2019s. He wanted to take another step forward, but he did not have the strength to do so.He turned around and looked at the mist covered summit. Su Ming panted harshly, but his eyes were bright. He may not have arrived at the top of the mountain, but at that moment, there was no doubt that he stood at the top. Gradually, Su Ming lifted his head and looked at the sky, which seemed to be within reach, and raised his right hand slowly.He could not touch it. Yet as he closed his eyes, he had the impression that he had closed the distance between himself and the sky.\u201cAmong all those living on the land, who will be able to see the end of the horizon..?\u201d Su Ming mumbled. He opened his eyes and no longer looked at the sky. Instead, he cast his gaze into the distance towards the horizon, the point that seemed like the end of the sky.He saw the land in the distance through the mist. There was only an indistinct vast mass of ground beyond. He did not know what that place was. He did not even know whether there was another tribe there\u2026That place was so, so far away\u2026After a long while, the smile on Su Ming\u2019s face became wider. He seemed to have forgotten his fatigue as he took in a deep breath of the refreshing air in the mountain.\u2018I don\u2019t know whether I can reach Awakening Realm\u2026 I don\u2019t know whether I can fly in the sky with my own strength like a bird\u2026 but now, I\u2019m standing here. I can fly here\u2026\u2019There was wind blowing at the moment, lifting up Su Ming\u2019s long hair and blowing away the sweat on his body. Su Ming brought out the plate and threw it down towards the foot of the mountain.The plate quickly fell and turned into a gust of black mist, rushing towards Su Ming as if it was going to surround him and bring him away from the mountain!The moment the black mist arrived, Su Ming jumped towards the vast land before him!It was a crazy move. Su Ming\u2019s body was entirely suspended in air like he was standing in midair. It was as if he was flying in the sky with his own power!Flying may not seem hard, but in truth, it was a right only reserved for the Berserkers who had reached the Awakening Realm. Those who had not Awakened could not hope to do so!Su Ming wanted to become stronger. He longed to Awaken, he yearned to fly in the sky, even if\u2026 this sort of flying was only for a short moment. Yet as long as he did it without any help, and did it entirely on his own, then it was fine!The moment he jumped and his feet left the top of the mountain, Su Ming stood in midair. The wind bellowed as it came from an unknown direction and made his hair even messier, as if the heavens themselves were angered!The moment he jumped, there was the sound of roaring waves in Su Ming\u2019s head. Yet it was not chaotic but clear, as if time became much slower. Su Ming could clearly feel that he was flying. He saw the sky, the earth. He saw the incredibly tall Wind Stream Mountain. He saw the mythical creature from the Fire Berserker Tribe on the summit. The beast seemed to be looking at him\u2026Besides all these, Su Ming also saw the field on the land that was sealed outside the mountain. He saw all the people gathered on the field\u2026 When the black mist came forth and enveloped his body, it turned into a long black misted arc that sped out of the mountain at an extremely fast pace. When the space in the air twisted, it rushed out of the sealed Wind Stream Mountain!When Mo Su\u2019s name turned gray on the nine eagle statues on the field and the space in the air twisted, a gust of black mist whistled by and landed on the center of the field.At that moment, all the gazes from the people in the field gathered towards the spot. Wu Sen had already stood up a long time ago and stared at the black mist that appeared. He watched as the black mist scattered away and revealed the faint outline of a person within it.Chen Chong was also staring intently at the shape of the person as he gradually became clearer in the mist. He wanted to know just who Mo Su was!Bi Su was doing the same thing. The killing intent in his eyes was incredibly thick. He did not even bother trying to hide it. He clenched his fists as he stared at the figure in the mist.They were not the only ones doing so. At that moment, everyone in the field was doing the same thing. The hundreds of people from different tribes, who had been paying attention to the event for the past two days, were filled with respect as they all looked at the person who was slowly walking out from the mist.Besides the bystanders, the ones who paid even more attention towards Mo Su were the people who took part in the first test together with Mo Su. No matter what rank they obtained, they were all holding their breaths while looking at him.The old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe was watching the figure of the person in the mist with bright eyes. She wanted to know how that person looked like and which tribe he belonged to.Si Kong also looked over anxiously.Bai Ling was affected by the serious atmosphere brought by Mo Su\u2019s return and could not help herself but to look over.Bei Ling, Wu La, Lei Chen, the Head of the Guards, Shan Hen, and the other people from the other tribes were also staring at the rapidly dissipating mist.Ye Wang took in a deep breath, which seemed to somewhat quell the complicated feelings in his heart. He stared at the person who walked out of the mist.All the people\u2019s eyes were focused upon one person!As the mist scattered away and Su Ming walked out, a countless number of gazes were trained on him. When the mist was completely gone and his face was clearly revealed to all the eyes in the field, the entire field fell into dead silence.He had a normal face and wore a normal shirt made of beast skin. He did not have Wu Sen\u2019s sullen attitude, Chen Chong\u2019s charisma, which allowed him to be surrounded and revered by people, nor did he have Bi Su\u2019s mysteriousness, and he most certainly did not have Ye Wang\u2019s prideful aloofness.If he stood in a crowd, it would be difficult for anyone to take note of him. That was how normal he was. Yet now, everyone knew that this person might have been normal before the test, but after the test, he was a definitely extraordinary presence. He was just like the sun, and he shocked the world even though he was previously unassuming!When Chen Chong saw Su Ming, he was stunned. He did not think he would be such a normal looking person. He looked so normal it was difficult for anyone to remember him, but somewhere on his mind, he had a vague recollection that this person had been among the crowd of people who surrounded him before the test\u2026 Yet at that time, he hadn\u2019t cared about that person. Chen Chong had completely ignored him.Bi Su also saw Su Ming. He remembered nothing about him. Even if he had seen Su Ming before, he had immediately ignored him. Thus, upon seeing him, he was also stunned.When Wu Sen\u2019s gaze fell upon Su Ming, his pupils shrank. His instincts were screaming at him that there was a high chance that this was the person who had stolen his Blood of Corpses\u2026 but\u2026 Wu Sen\u2019s face became bitter. He did not dare ask for it\u2026 This Mo Su was just as prodigious as Ye Wang. From now on, his name would travel to all parts of the region!Praise gradually appeared in the eyes of the old woman from Dark Dragon Tribe when she saw the average looking Su Ming. The first impression was very important to decide whether a person would like or hate another. It was just like how she had looked down on Su Ming, and now approved of Mo Su.It was a wonder what would be her level of shock and conflict in her heart when she learned that both people were actually one and the same.Si Kong\u2019s heart pounded against his chest. There was admiration in his eyes. He admired the strong, and it was especially so for this person before him. He was at the same level as Ye Wang!Bai Ling stared at Mo Su with a dumbfounded expression. She was shaking slightly. She saw Mo Su\u2019s eyes. Those eyes were somehow familiar to her\u2026 But she did not know that those pair of eyes had appeared just two days ago and were looking at her.Bei Ling, Wu La, Lei Chen, and all the other people from Dark Mountain Tribe looked at Su Ming as he walked over one step at a time. The entire area was still silent. At that moment, Su Ming\u2019s heart pounded hard against his chest. He might have seemed calm on the outside, but he was extremely nervous. He had never been the center of attention of so many people before. After all, he was still just a child.As Su Ming moved forward, the crowd started opening a path for him. It was as if there was a piercing glow that could burn other people on the average-looking Su Ming, causing them to have no choice but to retreat.He might not have Wu Sen\u2019s sullenness, but his face, normal as it seemed, brought in people the feeling of serenity and terror akin to the calm before a storm. He might not have Chen Chong\u2019s charisma that allowed him to be surrounded by other people like the moon with the stars, but on his average body, it seemed as if there was a resolution that could knock aside all the stars and the moon. He did not need to be surrounded by people.He might not have Ye Wang\u2019s prideful aloofness, but he had earned the right for even Ye Wang, prideful as he may be, to have to look at him.\u201cIt\u2026 It\u2019s him\u2026\u201d There was a man among the crowd who retreated to open up a path with an awestruck face. He was the one who had pulled Su Ming along to find Chen Chong. He hadn\u2019t expected that the person he had dragged with him was Mo Su.Standing further in the distance was an old man with a sharp mouth and cheeks of a monkey. He also widened his eyes. He might have had some guesses earlier, but when he saw it with his own eyes, he was still in a state of disbelief.Before the first stage of the test, there were three people who were the center of attention in the field \u2013 Chen Chong, Bai Ling, and Ye Wang! These three people were like centers of attention that attracted a lot of gazes upon themselves.Yet now, there was only one center of attention in the field!\u201cMo Su!\u201d As Su Ming was walking forward, a voice travelled out from within the silent crowd. That voice belonged to Ye Wang.Su Ming stopped. He turned around and looked at Ye Wang standing not far into the distance. This was the first time they had contact \u2013 equal contact. It was completely different from the first time Su Ming had looked at him from among the crowd!\u201cMo Su, let\u2019s compete again during the second stage!\u201d Ye Wang spoke slowly. There was persistence on his face. Even if the match ended with a tie, and they were both placed first, his pride did not allow him to accept that result. He wanted to compete again, even if it was for the second time, or the third!\u201cI won\u2019t enter the second stage of the test\u2026\u201d Su Ming fell silent for a while before he spoke calmly. He respected Ye Wang as his opponent. Once he finished speaking, Su Ming turned away and his gaze fell upon Mo Sang sitting in the distance. He saw a smile on the elder\u2019s face and saw within his eyes the message that told him not to reveal his identity.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming turned away. This time, he looked at Dark Dragon Tribe and at Bai Ling, who was standing beside the old woman!He smiled faintly and walked towards Bai Ling with the anxiety stemmed from being the center of attention ever since he came back.\u201cCare to walk in circles with me tomorrow night..?\u201d When Su Ming walked towards her, he ignored the dumbstruck old woman and the excited Si Kong, and looked into Bai Ling\u2019s eyes, winking as he whispered to her.Bai Ling was stunned. She did not know what to say, but the moment she heard the three words \u2018walk in circles\u2019, saw Su Ming wink at her, and remembered those familiar eyes, she trembled slightly, a soft blush coloring her cheeks.She nodded her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There would be a night of rest before the start of the next part of the test the next day. The second stage may not be a test of actual combat, but it held a lot of importance by showing the participants\u2019 power.In the past, there would be a lot of people who entered the first stage of the test and did not participate in the other two stages, but these people were mostly ranked below the top 50. There had never been someone who had managed to place in the top 10 ranks and bowed out of the other two tests.That was why Su Ming and Ye Wang\u2019s conversation caused a storm to rage within the hearts of the people in the field. However, they did not talk about it. They only watched silently as Su Ming left.The participants who were getting ready for the test next morning left especially quickly. They had to hurry up and use the night to train to make sure their bodies were in top condition while getting rid of the injuries they sustained due to the pressure from the mountain in the first stage.The injuries sustained by Chen Chong and the others were not light because they had forcefully moved forward during the first stage of the test. They would require help from the powerful Berserkers from their tribes to be able to recover by next morning.Even Wind Stream Tribe\u2019s Elder, Jing Nan, did not waste time loitering in the field. Ye Wang\u2019s forceful absorption of his Berserker Blood would have left behind a lot of problems; he would have to go and help him soothe his Qi.When Su Ming came, it was Shi Hai who had brought him. It was the same when he left. Shi Hai seemed to be conflicted, and he hesitated as if about to say something, but he remained silent in the end. He swung his sleeve and brought Su Ming away from the place towards Wind Stream City in a whistle of wind.As the crowd gradually diminished, the field became more deserted. Mo Sang stood in the field with a smile as he spoke to Jing Nan, who was standing by his side, about something.Jing Nan\u2019s face was no longer gloomy. He was frowning instead. After a long moment of silence, he looked towards Mo Sang.\u201cThe first request you had regarding giving me the Ancient Berserker Art was to let Dark Mountain Tribe become a part of Wind Stream Tribe when you believed the time was right so as to receive Wind Stream\u2019s protection.\u201cYour purpose for doing that was definitely to give Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s Bi Tu a chance. You will take away three of the strongest Berserkers in Dark Mountain Tribe and greatly reduce the defense of your tribe\u2026\u201cIf Bi Tu comes to Wind Stream, then you will use the chance to observe his power. If he doesn\u2019t, then it means something unknown has happened to his training. This move of yours, where you kill two birds with one stone, is ruthless indeed!\u201d Jing Nan looked at Mo Sang and gritted out each word.\u201cI never intended to hide it from you,\u201d Mo Sang spoke, smiling.\u201cIf Bi Tu had come, you could then have made changes according to your judgment. If he didn\u2019t, then you\u2019d be leaving behind a weakened tribe to tempt him into attacking it\u2026 I can tell that you have a backup plan within the tribe.\u201cIf Bi Tu was to really attack Dark Mountain Tribe, then due to my promise to you, Dark Mountain Tribe would become part of Wind Stream, which would make Bi Tu wary. Due to your understanding of Bi Tu, if he had just arrived at a breakthrough, then his powers would still be wild and hard to control. I\u2026 would definitely need to lend a hand or else Wind Stream would lose all their esteem in the region since they couldn\u2019t even defend an affiliated tribe.\u201cIt would make others think that I\u2019m afraid of Bi Tu,\u201d Jing Nan slowly spoke about these things. In truth, when Mo Sang had mentioned that to him in the secret room, he had already thought about all this, but did not say it. He wanted to keep those thoughts to himself and think about it later so that he could make Mo Sang pay a greater price. Now\u2026 he found the price!\u201cNot bad. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been thinking. It\u2019s a pity Bi Tu didn\u2019t make a move.\u201d Mo Sang frowned slightly as he looked towards Jing Nan.Jing Nan\u2019s gaze was complicated as he looked into Mo Sang\u2019s eyes. After a long while, he sighed.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t because that child looked so different from you, I\u2019d truly think that he is of your blood.\u201d Jing Nan lifted his head and looked towards the direction Su Ming had disappeared.\u201cTo me, he is of my blood.\u201d There was a hint of nostalgia in Mo Sang\u2019s eyes as he spoke softly.\u201cMo Sang, in terms of intelligence, I cannot compare to you\u2026 This has nothing to do with our cultivation. I knew that since I was young\u2026 You knew since a long time ago that I would figure out the hidden meaning within your request, and you knew that with my personality, I would not immediately reject you, but would find the chance to reap even more benefits from you\u2026\u201cAll this, you have predicted. That was why you pushed this benefit right in front of my face so that I would have no choice but to be attracted to it\u2026 All of this was not just for your tribe but also for the child, perhaps even more for him\u2026\u201d\u201cYou knew since a long time ago how outstanding Su Ming is!\u201d Jing Nan spoke slowly.Mo Sang looked at Jing Nan with a smile. He did not speak.\u201cYou made him hide his identity and use another appearance in this place to show off his potential so that I would see all of that\u2026 With this move, even if Dark Mountain Tribe becomes affiliated to Wind Stream Tribe, he would not be affected by this. You gave him another path\u2026 a path that you did not choose that year\u2026\u201d Jing Nan\u2019s face became even more complicated as he looked at Mo Sang.\u201cYou know that Wind Stream does not mind prodigies appearing in the tribes around the region. In fact, we even hope that there would be other young prodigies appearing in other tribes. Because the moment they appear, we would receive them the moment we find them and make them part of Wind Stream. We would also give a lot of benefits to their original tribes.\u201cMany people don\u2019t understand why we do this, thinking that Wind Stream is jealous of those who have talent. Even if we explain ourselves, no one would believe us, only you\u2026 know the truth! You know the truth, and you asked him to disguise himself for his own good. After all, if he\u2019s too outstanding, then it would be far too easy for others to be jealous of him. Putting him under a layer of disguise is a form of protection for him. At the same time, he won\u2019t be burdened by the fate of being one of the members of an affiliated tribe. He can be independent.\u201d\u201cIf he grows up and reveals his identity later, it would still be fine. At that time, he would already have the power to let others look up to him. He could also protect Dark Mountain Tribe by then, which would have already become an affiliated tribe.\u201d Jing Nan looked at the few people left on the field while speaking slowly.\u201cYou made it. I like this child. Let him stay in Wind Stream. I\u2019ll offer him the same help as I gave Ye Wang, just like what I promised before. Between him and Ye Wang, whoever reaches the Transcendence Realm first will become the Berserker\u2019s Son of Wind Stream!\u201cEven if he reaches the Transcendence Realm later than Ye Wang, with his potential, I will still make him as brilliant as the blazing sun! He will develop Wind Stream together with Ye Wang! As for Dark Mountain Tribe\u2026 once the test ends, come to Wind Stream. Bi Tu won\u2019t dare to stop you. If he makes a move, I will let him know the difference between us, even though we are both in the initial stages of the Transcendence Realm!\u201d As Jing Nan spoke, he raised his right hand towards Mo Sang and waved it. In an instant, a small bottle sped towards Mo Sang.\u201cThere are three drops of Berserker Blood in there. Treat the extra drop as a present for Su Ming!\u201d Jing Nan looked at Mo Sang deeply and turned away, taking a step towards the air. He had to help soothe Ye Wang\u2019s Qi tonight.Mo Sang watched Jing Nan leave, then looked at the small bottle containing the three drops of Berserker Blood. His eyes were filled with contemplation. Jing Nan was right in many regards, but there was one thing he was wrong about. Mo Sang did not expect that Su Ming would be able to obtain such a rank.His original plan had been to use Su Ming\u2019s mysterious identity to make Jing Nan suspicious. Then he would pay up an incredibly great price for Jing Nan to agree to let Su Ming stay in Wind Stream.After all, he understood that Wind Stream Tribe was incredibly determined towards getting out of this place and becoming stronger. It would not give up any chance to do so, even if it was just a guess\u2026But Mo Sang did not expect Su Ming to be able to obtain this rank. With things this way, the tables for his negotiation with Jing Nan had immediately turned and now Mo Sang held the reins instead of being forced to go with the tide.It was just a small change, yet the difference in the end results was so great!\u2018Perhaps this time\u2026 the catastrophe looming over Dark Mountain Tribe can actually be solved\u2026\u2019A bright flash flickered in Mo Sang\u2019s eyes, and he went towards the people from Dark Mountain Tribe waiting for him in the distance.In the air outside of the vicinity of Wind Stream Mountain, Shi Hai was speeding away with Su Ming back to the mudstone city. They did not say one word to each other while they were in the air.Su Ming was just quiet, but Shi Hai was feeling conflicted. He would occasionally look at Su Ming. The person before him looked incredibly normal, and Shi Hai had been the one who bring him to the field. Back then, he\u2019d not taken much notice of this person. Yet now, after he had seen Su Ming\u2019s unbelievable raise as he climbed up the stairs during the previous few days, Shi Hai\u2019s attitude was forced to change.\u2018This is a prodigy that can compete with Ye Wang!\u2019Shi Hai marveled in his heart.Before long, the contours of Wind Stream Tribe gradually appeared on the land far into the distance. As the giant mudstone city gradually appeared before their eyes, Su Ming suddenly spoke.He spoke as the gust was blowing fiercely against his face. His voice seemed to be about ready to be scattered away into the wind, but each word and syllable still reached Shi Hai\u2019s ears clearly.\u201cSenior, I have something I don\u2019t understand. You have yet to Awaken, how is it that you\u2019re able to fly in the sky?\u201dIf it was before, Shi Hai would have definitely ignored him, as if he had not heard him. Yet now, after a moment of hesitation, he opened his mouth and began his explanation slowly.\u201cThe flight after reaching Awakening is different from mine. The reason I can fly is due to my Berserker Vessel. A part of it is also because of my Berserker Mark, which has yet to solidify. My Berserker Mark is of the clouds.\u201dAs Shi Hai spoke, a faint picture of a cloud appeared in the centre of his brows.\u201cTo be exact, a Berserker who has reached the Awakening Realm can walk in the air with his own power. As for me, I can only float. It may seem the same, but the basic principle behind it is very different,\u201d Shi Hai explained in detail.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming\u2019s eyes were contemplative. He asked a few more questions. As they continued talking, they returned to the mudstone city. When Shi Hai let Su Ming on the ground, there was a smile on his face. He nodded his head towards Su Ming, then left after turning into a cloud.The gigantic field at the foot of Wind Stream Mountain was now deserted. The only living beings there were the eight people sitting on top of eight of the nine eagle statues. They were powerful Berserkers from Wind Stream Tribe. Before long, Shi Hai returned and sat down cross-legged on the ninth eagle statue.Since the seal on Wind Stream Mountain was broken, some time would be required to seal it again. The nine of them protected this place until the seal was complete, and they could leave.That had been the case since before\u2026Yet this year, there was something unusual. In the deserted field, a person in black had appeared some time ago. That person was wearing a black robe that hid his entire body. It was the mysterious man who had appeared at Black Mountain Tribe!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They didn\u2019t know when the mysterious man had appeared, nor did they know of his existence. Even if they had opened their eyes, they would have only seen an empty space before them.\u201cThe Great Bird, one of the four great mythical creatures of the Fire Berserker Tribe\u2026 They were killed that year by the God of Berserkers\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect that there would be a fragment of its soul here\u2026 If the Elder from Black Mountain Tribe hadn\u2019t told me, I would have missed it\u2026 Oh well, he might have told me this because of personal reasons, but since I saw the beast, then I\u2019ll definitely satisfy his request.\u201cThere are just two people who have reached the initial stage of the Awakening Realm. They\u2019re not enough for me to spare any of my attention here yet\u2026 I\u2019ve heard about Wind Stream Tribe, located at the edges of the western region\u2019s alliance borders. I heard that they were once a weak branch from the Great Tribe of Miao Man\u00b9,\u201d the mysterious man mumbled and moved forward step by step towards Wind Stream Mountain, which was in a state of being sealed off once again!\u2026..Su Ming returned to the lodgings of Dark Mountain Tribe within Wind Stream City. His face had long since returned to normal, and he looked like the frail, clean, and handsome youth once more. He wore a simple beast skin shirt and sat down within the lodgings of Dark Mountain Tribe.There was excitement and anxiety within his eyes. All that had happened during the first stage of the test was like a dream to him. It was as if the person who did it was not him, but someone else. It was especially so when he had returned to the field and become the center of attention. It made his heart pound even more quickly. When he remembered talking to Bai Ling right before Si Kong and the old woman, Su Ming felt proud of himself.He took in a deep breath and finally managed to quell the excitement within his heart. He closed his eyes and felt the vast amount of Qi in his body. The power that erupted from all 160 blood veins filled Su Ming with confidence.His blood veins had increased during the final moment by four. They had increased from 156 to 160.\u201cI\u2019m now at the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. There\u2019s not much of a difference between this and the required 245 blood veins for the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm\u2026\u201d Su Ming mumbled, and there was a strange glow in his eyes.\u2018I can start training Dark Blood Dust\u2026 I\u2019ll have to wait a bit longer for the powerful Execution of the Three Evils, though.\u2019Su Ming sat down with a focused gaze as he recalled everything that had happened during the first stage of the test. A smile gradually appeared on the corner of his lips.\u2018More importantly, I\u2019ve mastered fine control! If my mind moves, my Qi will move. If my mind doesn\u2019t move, then my Qi will be hidden\u2026 With this, I won\u2019t waste a single shred of Qi. When my battle power increases, my speed will also increase to another level!\u2019Su Ming took in a deep breath as his spirits were lifted up.\u2018With the Blood Scales, the me now should be able to somehow help the elder protect the tribe and my tribe members! I can fight for the tribe!\u2019He clenched his fists with a resolute gaze.\u2018It\u2019s a pity my powers aren\u2019t great enough right now. I only have 160 blood veins\u2026 If I could increase them further, that would be great\u2026\u2019Su Ming frowned. After a moment of silence, a bright light flashed in his eyes.\u201cI have to buy a large amount of herbs and create more Mountain Spirit\u2026 But\u2026 Ha\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes darkened. His pockets were empty. He did not have any money to buy anything.\u2018Right now, the tribe is faced with a great danger. It would need a lot of stone coins. I can\u2019t add more stress for the elder\u2026 I have to think. How can I get a huge amount of money\u2026?\u2019He scratched his head. While he was thinking, his ears twitched. He heard Wu La\u2019s excited voice coming from outside the house.Su Ming stood up and opened the front door. From there, he saw Bei Ling, Wu La, Lei Chen, and behind them, the elder, the Head of the Guards, and Shan Hen walking back.\u201cMo Su has a really great presence! You saw it, right? The moment he came back, he immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention! Even Ye Wang spoke to him! I heard from the others that this is something that is incredibly rare!\u201d Wu La\u2019s face was lit with excitement. Her eyes were bright with enthusiasm as she walked and continued speaking to Bei Ling and Lei Chen.\u201cMo Su may look average, but he attracts a lot of attention. I think that powerful people are all supposed to be like this. He reached the top from the last place. When he came back, he was really calm. The presence of a powerful person was incredibly strong on him. I can still remember the words he spoke to Ye Wang. He said, \u2018I won\u2019t enter the second stage of the test.\u2019 It made so many people shocked!\u201d Wu La gestured excitedly. It was clear that Mo Su held a great position within her heart, and she practically worshipped him.Su Ming stood outside the house and looked at the crowd coming back. He watched Wu La\u2019s excitement and touched his nose. He remembered being very nervous. He found it hard to adapt to the feeling of being the center of attention. He absolutely did not have the calmness Wu La was talking about\u2026\u201cMo Su had been unknown, but now, he\u2019s famous. His name has already traveled to the entire Wind Stream Tribe. Before long, all the tribes around the region will know his name!\u201d Bei Ling\u2019s face was no longer aloof but was filled with exhilaration and excitement, which was a rare sight.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity he doesn\u2019t belong to Dark Mountain Tribe. Ah\u2026 it\u2019d be great if there was such a prodigy in Dark Mountain Tribe\u2026\u201d Bei Ling sighed. There was no hint of jealousy within him. That was the nature of human beings. They would only compete with those who were around their level. They would find it hard to be jealous of those who had surpassed them by too much. Unless\u2026 they were people who they grew up with, and thus, had no sense of mysteriousness, because both parties knew each other too well. They would still be jealous of those people, then.\u201cThat\u2019s right. If only he was from Dark Mountain Tribe\u2026 Mo Su, Mo Sang, their names match so well. Mo Su\u2026\u201d There was a look of awe in Wu La\u2019s eyes, and her face was flushed. As she continued mumbling, she saw Su Ming standing at the house and frowned. Disdain appeared on her face.She remembered what Lei Chen had said. He had actually suspected that the Mo Su she admired was Su Ming. It only made her think that it was a form of humiliation towards Mo Su.Lei Chen did not speak. When he saw Su Ming, he trained his eyes on him. After a few moments of scrutiny, his eyes darkened. It was clear that he did not believe that Su Ming and Mo Su had any form of connection either.As for Bei Ling, he had seen Su Ming standing there a long time ago, but he had immediately ignored Su Ming\u2019s existence. The aloofness in his eyes was so thick, it seemed that it would not go away.\u201cMo Su is incredibly mysterious. Up till now, we still don\u2019t know which tribe he belongs to. Maybe we\u2019ll know in a few more days. When that time comes, I\u2019ll represent Dark Mountain Tribe and get to know him\u2026\u201d Bei Ling no longer looked at Su Ming. When he spoke of Mo Su, there was respect in his eyes.\u201cYou have to get to know him. Mo Su\u2026 Mo Su\u2026 I think his powers have to be really great. It\u2019s a pity he\u2019s not joining the second or the third stage of the test\u2026\u201d Su Ming saw Wu La\u2019s excitement and could not help but touch his nose again.\u201cMaybe his powers aren\u2019t really that great. That\u2019s why he\u2019s not taking part\u2026\u201d Su Ming could no longer keep it in and mumbled instinctively.\u201cSu Ming, what did you say?!\u201d When Wu La heard it, a fierce look immediately appeared in her eyes. She looked at Su Ming furiously.\u201cYou have no right to talk about Mo Su. His powers must be really great! He must have something else to do, or because he has no interest in competing, that\u2019s why he\u2019s not taking part in the test!\u201dSu Ming smiled bitterly and quickly kept his silence. When he saw how furious Wu La looked, he had no idea whether he should happy, or feel helpless.\u201cSu Ming, you can say all that here, saying this most likely because you heard from somewhere else about Mo Su. But I\u2019m warning you, once you leave the lodgings, you are not allowed to say anything of the kind! This will only bring trouble to the tribe. That Mo Su is not someone who we can talk about this way!\u201d Bei Ling spoke slowly while staring at Su Ming with a serious face. He was the strongest among the youths in Dark Mountain Tribe. It was not out of bounds for him to say that.\u201cSu Ming\u2026 I don\u2019t think you should say that either. That Mo Su\u2026 you didn\u2019t see him with your own eyes. He\u2019s just too strong, so strong that even Ye Wang had to pay attention to him! That person is not someone we can discuss. He\u2019s\u2026 really strong!\u201d Lei Chen whispered, too. Once he finished speaking, he hesitated for a moment and looked at Su Ming with a complicated look. It was as if he wanted to say something else, but could not continue.Su Ming smiled bitterly again.\u201cAlright. You three have another test tomorrow. Go back to your rooms to recover.\u201d The Head of the Guards frowned and spoke with a stern voice. Bei Ling and the other two immediately kept quiet and went back to their rooms.Mo Sang nodded towards Su Ming. The praise in his eyes was incredibly strong. He did not say anything but went back to his room. The Head of the Guards and Shan Hen followed close behind him. It was clear that they were going to discuss something.When they went away, Su Ming returned to his room. He knew that there was a high possibility of the elder coming over later. That was why he chose to sit here and wait quietly.He waited for a long while, but the elder did not come. Lei Chen hesitantly came instead. He went into Su Ming\u2019s room and sat in front of him, looking at him with a dumbfounded expression.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Su Ming looked at the stupidly honest expression on Lei Chen\u2019s face and smiled.\u201cNo\u2026 It\u2019s nothing\u2026 Su Ming, you\u2026 do you\u2026\u201d Lei Chen hesitated, gritted his teeth, then whispered, \u201cDo you like Bai Ling?\u201dSu Ming was thrown off guard.\u201cAh, Su Ming, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you like her. This is a friendly advice\u2026 Give up. I\u2019m wondering though. Is Bai Ling really that beautiful? She\u2019s not as pretty as Bai Fang\u2026\u201d Lei Chen mumbled, and there was a questioning look on his face.\u201cSu Ming, you didn\u2019t go to the field at the foot of Wind Stream Mountain. You didn\u2019t see how Mo Su went to Bai Ling and spoke about walking in circles before everyone\u2019s eyes right at the end! Circles, my ass! I don\u2019t like him!\u201d Lei Chen quickly stole a look at Su Ming\u2019s expression and spoke just as quickly.\u201cWorse still, that Bai Ling agreed to it while blushing! Ah, you didn\u2019t see that scene. It\u2019s clear that she likes Mo Su! That Bai Ling is disappointing!\u201d Lei Chen spoke once again.There was an odd expression on Su Ming\u2019s face. He hesitated for a moment before opening his mouth and whispering, \u201cLei Chen, let me tell you a secret\u2026 I\u2019m actually Mo Su.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLei Chen was stunned, then he lifted his hand to touch Su Ming\u2019s forehead, which Su Ming dodged. Lei Chen quickly advised him against it and was just about to say something again when they heard the elder letting out a cough outside the room.Lei Chen quickly stood up. The door to the room was opened, and the elder smiled as he entered.Without even needing a word from the elder, Lei Chen quickly left. He stole a look at Su Ming, then left the room. There was still worry on his face, however. Su Ming\u2019s words just now had given him a shock. He thought Su Ming was too upset, that was why he said those words.Translator\u2019s Note :\u00b9 Miao Man is an aboriginal tribe in China, which was once a great tribePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he saw the elder entering the room, Su Ming quickly stood up. He was feeling very nervous. He did not know whether his actions during the first stage of the test were right in the elder\u2019s eyes.While he was feeling nervous, a smile appeared on the elder\u2019s face. He sat in front of Su Ming and looked at the frail looking youth before him. There was a hint of nostalgia within his eyes as he looked at the traces of youthfulness still left on that clean and handsome face.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown up\u2026 Come, sit by my side,\u201d the elder said softly after a long while.\u201cElder.\u201d Su Ming sat down. The wrinkles on the elder\u2019s face seemed to have increased. The traces left behind by time seemed to reveal a person that had experienced a lot in life.\u201cYou did well during the first stage of the test.\u201d The elder patted Su Ming\u2019s head before he took out a small bottle and handed it to Su Ming.\u201cThere are three drops of Berserker Blood belonging to a Berserker of the Transcendence Realm in the bottle. Keep it close to you. When the time is right, it will be of great help to you. That is about as much as I can help\u2026\u201d The elder looked at Su Ming, and there was a look in his eyes that Su Ming could not understand due to his young age.\u201cThe method to absorb the Berserker Blood of the Transcended Realm is easy. Cast the Dark Blood Dust and change the Berserker Blood into blood mist, surrounding your body while you slowly absorb it. Use it to nurture your blood veins. You can only absorb one drop each time, however, don\u2019t be greedy. You have to do this slowly, or else you\u2019ll harm your own body,\u201d the elder warned him seriously.Su Ming looked at the elder. He did not know why, but he had a hunch that something he would not like was about to happen. The look on the elder\u2019s face and his words only made him further not understand the meaning behind the elder\u2019s words.\u201cElder\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Su Ming took the bottle the Berserker Blood instinctively. Just as he was about to say something, he saw the elder smiling and shaking his head. He looked at Su Ming kindly.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not impossible to solve the danger the tribe faces. I\u2019ve already spoke with the Elder from Wind Stream Tribe. There shouldn\u2019t be anything going wrong at this point.\u201cWhat you need to do now is to train properly. If the day comes and you reach Transcendence Realm\u2026 If you can leave this place and go explore the world outside\u2026 You have to remember to go to Berserkers\u2019 Realm Mountain,\u201d the elder said slowly.\u201cWhat is\u2026 Berserkers\u2019 Realm Mountain?\u201d Su Ming was stunned. He had a feeling that this was connected to his birth. Yet when the elder suddenly spoke of it, the bad feeling in his heart grew stronger until it turned into a wave of uneasiness and anxiety so strong it replaced the shock and uncertainty that he should be feeling.\u201cIt\u2019s in your heart\u2026\u201d the elder said, looking at Su Ming.He was stunned for a moment, and there was a questioning look on his face.\u201cAlright. Just remember that. Let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. I\u2019ve already spoken with the Elder of Wind Stream Tribe. You\u2019ll be staying in Wind Stream Tribe as Mo Su from now on. The Elder of Wind Stream Tribe will be helping and guiding you together with Ye Wang. This will be a great help to you, and his help will far exceed the amount of help I can give you. The chances of you transcending will also increase.\u201d The elder\u2019s face was serious as he looked at Su Ming. When he saw hesitation on Su Ming\u2019s face and that he was about to speak, he became stern.\u201cBut\u2026 elder, I don\u2019t want to stay in Wind Stream Tribe. I\u2026\u201d The elder\u2019s words were too sudden, causing Su Ming to be completely unprepared for it. He did not expect it. If he knew from the start that such a change would happen due to the results of the first stage of the test, then he would have definitely not gotten such a high ranking. Yet before he could even finish speaking in his alarm, the elder\u2019s eyes became fierce.\u201cSu Ming! I\u2019ve already decided on this. You must stay here from now on!\u201d the elder spoke sternly.Su Ming fell silent, but the unyielding look in his eyes was clear.When he saw the stubborn look in Su Ming\u2019s eyes, the elder sighed and his expression softened. He looked at Su Ming and spoke slowly, \u201cSu Ming, Dark Mountain Tribe is not far from Wind Stream. You can come back anytime you want.\u201dSu Ming bit into his lip. He did not know what to say.\u201cBesides, I\u2019ve already decided. Dark Mountain Tribe will join Wind Stream Tribe and leave Dark Mountain. We will build a new tribe outside the mudstone city. Truth be told, you\u2019ll be really close to the tribe,\u201d the elder continued saying.\u201cBut elder, I don\u2019t want to become part of Wind Stream Tribe, I\u2019m a member of Dark Mountain Tribe!\u201d Su Ming said in a low voice after hesitating for a moment.The elder looked quietly at Su Ming. After a long while, he spoke again, \u201cSu Ming, besides doing it for your own good, I\u2019m asking you to join Wind Stream Tribe for another reason. Your status will rise just as your powers will rise. Once you\u2019re at the same level as Ye Wang, then you can protect Dark Mountain Tribe from your side. Don\u2019t you want to take care of Dark Mountain Tribe?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Su Ming was stunned.\u201cHow about this? This isn\u2019t a matter of urgency. You don\u2019t have to think too much about it. Once all this ends and Dark Mountain Tribe migrates here, you can make your decision. When that time comes, I\u2019ll send you here. You don\u2019t even have to stay in the city, you can continue staying in Dark Mountain Tribe. How does that sound?\u201d The elder smiled and ruffled Su Ming\u2019s hair.Su Ming let out a sigh of relief. After a moment of thought, he nodded his head obediently. If that was the case, he could accept it. Within Su Ming\u2019s heart, he only belonged to one tribe, and that was Dark Mountain Tribe.\u201cAlright. Since you\u2019re not taking part in the next two tests, stay in Wind Stream Tribe for the next few days and get yourself familiar with the place. Once Bei Ling and the others are done with the tests, we\u2019ll be returning to the tribe.\u201d The elder smiled and stood up. He did not ask how Su Ming managed to obtain his rank, neither did he ask Su Ming to explain his understanding towards the six numbers. He only smiled and looked deeply at Su Ming before he turned and left.Su Ming looked at the elder\u2019s back as he left. It was burdened by his experiences in life, and as Su Ming watched, his heart twisted for an unknown reason.Right up till the moment the elder left and Su Ming was the only one left in the room, he sat in his spot quietly and thought of each and every one of the elder\u2019s words. Worry gnawed at his heart.\u2018I don\u2019t have enough power\u2026 I have to become stronger!\u2019After a long while, Su Ming clenched his teeth tightly. He might not fully understand the look in the elder\u2019s eyes, but he could tell that things were not as the elder said. The danger looming over the tribe might not be as easily resolved as he said.\u2018I won\u2019t be able to perform any more burning of blood within this short period of time. If I want to become stronger, then I can only create more pills\u2026 Then I\u2019ll need a lot of stone coins\u2026\u2019Su Ming frowned. What he lacked right now was money.\u2018What should I do..? I\u2019ve already sold Scattering Dust once. I wonder if it attracted any attention\u2026 But if I don\u2019t sell it again, then I won\u2019t get any money\u2026 but if someone had already caught wind of this, then I can\u2019t sell the pills again.\u2019Su Ming was cracking his head for all possible methods, but he could not find a solution.\u2018Looks like I\u2019ll have to ask the elder for some stone coins\u2026\u2019Su Ming sighed. He absolutely did not want to add to the elder\u2019s burdens. According to his plans, he would require a large amount of stone coins this time.Su Ming stood up straight and was just about to find the elder when he stopped as a thought appeared in his head.He stood by the door with bright eyes while the thought became increasingly clearer in his head. After a while, Su Ming decided to sit down and think. He then took out a bottle from his bosom.There were traces of light surrounding it. Within the bottle was the green blood he had snatched from Wu Sen some time ago. He had enveloped it in moonlight so that its presence could be hidden.Right now, he took out the bottle, and his eyes became increasingly brighter. He had been working on that thought in his head multiple times and gradually an idea formed.\u2018This thing must be incredibly important to Wu Sen! And\u2026 I heard Bei Ling mention that Wu Sen was on par with Chen Chong in Wind Stream Tribe, and they\u2019re only slightly below Ye Wang!\u2018This person has always ranked within the top three in the previous tests, but this time\u2026 he was only in the twelfth place\u2026 Even if it was due to Bi Su\u2019s appearance that he fell out of the top 3, he should not have dropped out of the top 10.\u2018As for this change\u2026 There can only be one explanation. He has become weaker! Only when his body has weakened and problems arose for him, would he have shown such a poor performance. There would definitely be no need for him to hide his power during the test. There is no need for him to do so with his status!\u2019 Su Ming mumbled in his head as he analyzed the situation.\u2018If that\u2019s the case, then there\u2019s at least half a chance that his performance is due to him losing\u2026 this thing!\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes flashed. He looked at the bottle in his hands and a smile appeared on his lips.\u2018Wu Sen is a prodigy within Wind Stream Tribe. Then surely, he must be pretty rich\u2026\u2019The smile on Su Ming\u2019s lips grew wider and brighter.\u2018But just what is this? Why is it so important to him?\u2019Su Ming fell silent for a moment. He did not act immediately, but chose to sit down cross-legged and quietly adjusted his breathing to recover his Qi. When the moon hung high in the sky, Su Ming opened his eyes abruptly.\u2018Now I can examine this.\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming no longer hesitated. He took the small bottle and waved his left hand above it. The moonlight on top of the bottle immediately scattered away. Su Ming brought the bottle closer and took off the cork before looking at it carefully.The green blood within the bottle seemed a bit dull. It was as if because it had been away from Wu Sen\u2019s body for a long time, it had lost its color and spirit.\u2018I have to see whether this thing is useful to me. If it isn\u2019t, only then will I be able to move to the next step.\u2019Su Ming did not hesitate, pouring out the liquid from the bottle. The fresh blood floated before him. There was no stench of blood coming from it, as if it was not blood.Su Ming stared at it, then grabbed the blood and placed it in the center between his brows.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That presence was filled with death. It was as if there was a countless number of moaning voices echoing in his head. At that moment, the green blood seemed to have been revitalized and wanted to struggle out of Su Ming\u2019s hands before rushing into the center of his brows, then entering his body.Su Ming narrowed his eyes in concentration. The Qi in his body circulated and immediately dissipated the presence of death from the blood while also blocking the green blood that was trying to enter his body. He held the ball of blood in his right hand and lifted it away from his brows. The moment it left, a look of surprise appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes.This thing should have been made with a special Berserker Art. It\u2019s incredibly important to the practitioner, but to those who don\u2019t practice it, it would only cause them harm. Su Ming was silent, sinking into his thoughts and making his decision. With the analysis he made by tying up Wu Sen\u2019s weakened state to the loss of this blood, his certainty towards his theory rose up by another thirty percent from its initial fifty percent. He may not be completely certain still, but eighty percent was enough.In truth, his guess was correct. If others had forcefully absorbed the Blood of Corpses, then it would cause them internal injuries. Even if there would be benefits obtained from it, after comparing the pros and cons, there would be more losses compared to gains.Su Ming placed the blood back into the bottle and waved his right hand towards the bottle. Immediately, a ray of moonlight appeared and turned into strings that surrounded the bottle. He placed the bottle into his bosom and stood up before leaving the room.The moon in the sky was not in a crescent shape. It was slightly rounder. By the looks of it, within a few days, the moon would be full.Su Ming took in a deep breath. He played out the idea in his head once again, and his eyes flashed briefly. He walked out of the house in the middle of the night. It was quiet in the area, and there was absolutely no sound around him.The moment he walked out of Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings in Wind Stream City, Su Ming\u2019s heart jolted. At that moment, a cold voice came from behind him, \u201cIt\u2019s late. Where are you going?\u201dSu Ming stopped. He turned around and saw a man walking out from the dark part of the big door. He looked average, but there was a cold glint in his narrowed eyes. He was Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s Shan Hen!\u201cGreetings, chief of the hunters.\u201d Su Ming\u2019s face was passive and unmoving as he watched Shan Hen walking towards him.\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d Shan Hen moved towards him slowly and stood ten feet away from Su Ming, looking coldly at him.\u201cI heard from Bei Ling that Wind Stream City is lively at night. That\u2019s why I wanted to go take a look.\u201d Su Ming was on guard, but there was fear on his face. He spoke quickly.Shan Hen looked at Su Ming for a long while before he nodded his head slowly.\u201cIt\u2019s not too safe during the night. Don\u2019t cause any trouble and come back soon,\u201d Shan Hen said slowly. He was the chief of the hunters in the tribe. He was also a powerful Berserker who chose to follow the elder during this journey. Protecting the members of the tribe was his responsibility. For him, saying those words was normal.Su Ming agreed to it. After bowing to Shan Hen, he slowly walked backwards before turning around and walking into the distance. He could feel that Shan Hen was still watching his back.He only took a few more steps forward when all the hair on his body rose suddenly. He could feel a strong pressure pressing on him. The feeling turned into a sense of danger that screamed at him that someone was targeting him.The Qi in his body seemed to be on the verge of losing control and was about to circulate on its own to resist against the pressure. Su Ming knew that it was a reflex that belonged to Berserkers. Due to the Qi within their bodies, if they were suddenly met with an attack, then it would be very difficult for them to hide their Qi because they would automatically resist against it.If it was a normal tribe member, then the pressure they felt would not be so strong. Only Berserkers would feel the pressure clearly. This was a way to test whether the people around them were hiding their powers. Yet this was a technique that was only useful if it was used by Berserkers in the high level of the Blood Solidification Realm against those who had lower levels compared to them.Shan Hen\u2019s strength was far greater than Su Ming\u2019s. If this sudden act had been used on Su Ming before he went through the test, then he would not have been able to resist it. Yet it would still not bring about too much attention, because the elder had cast an Art on him to disguise his Qi. Even if the Qi in his body was forcefully activated, no one would be able to notice it.However, as of then, Su Ming could already control the Qi in his entire body through fine control by keeping his mind still. He did not hesitate. The moment the Qi in his body was about to be activated, with a single thought, Su Ming calmly dissipated the activation of his Qi. This was something that would be difficult for other people to do, but for Su Ming, who had already understood the method of entering fine control by using his mind, it was not hard.However, while Qi could be hidden and kept still, the body\u2019s instinctive movements when a person was faced with sudden danger would usually be the part where other people chose to observe.Shan Hen was looking for that.Nevertheless, he underestimated Su Ming. More accurately speaking, he had never paid too much attention towards Su Ming, hence he did not understand Su Ming. The moment the sense of danger arrived, Su Ming did not stop. It was as if he was completely unaware of it and continued walking forward at an unhurried pace until he gradually disappeared into the night.When Su Ming left the place, a frown gradually appeared on Shan Hen\u2019s face. Nonetheless, he did not continue standing there. He turned around instead and went back into the tribe\u2019s lodgings.His actions were not out of bounds. Even if he did it before the elder, no one would think otherwise. In fact, since he did it so straightforwardly, other people would just think that he suspected Su Ming and was just testing him.Su Ming kept to a calm pace until he was far away from the lodgings. Then, he could no longer resist sprinting a few steps with his heart pounding rapidly against his chest. During that instant, from the feeling he got from how Shan Hen scrutinized him, Su Ming found his hidden, mysterious observer of the past few days that he felt during meditation!\u2018It\u2019s him!\u2019Su Ming frowned. He remembered the elder mentioning a traitor within the tribe. Even if the elder did not go into detail about it, Su Ming could tell the worrying aspects about it.\u2018Is it him..?\u2019Su Ming was in doubt. The status of the chief of the hunters was very high, and he held great authority within the tribe. He had control over all the Berserkers within the hunting team. He also had the important duty of leading the hunting teams to hunt for food.Throughout the years, Shan Hen had contributed a lot for the tribe in Su Ming\u2019s memories. He may seem like an indifferent man, but in truth, there were times where Su Ming saw him walking coldly in the tribe while offering his game to the elderly members of the tribe.He had also gone up the mountain and brought back a huge amount of beast fangs because children in the tribe loved them. Even when he distributed it to the La Sus with his usual aloof look, Su Ming could tell that there was a hint of kindness within him when he did so.In fact, Su Ming could recall from his memories that during one particular winter, some hunters in a hunting team had been ambushed by the people from Black Mountain Tribe and escaped while heavily injured. One of them had even died. Shan Hen\u2019s face had been ice cold as he went out of the tribe alone. When he returned the next day, he held three heads that belonged to the Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe in his hand.This would have incited war with Black Mountain Tribe if it were not for the elder\u2019s incredible power during that year.The scenes from the past appeared one by one in Su Ming\u2019s head. He could not find a single reason for Shan Hen to turn traitor. To him, it was impossible that this sort of chief of the hunters would betray the tribe\u2026\u2018Maybe\u2026 I\u2019m just thinking too much.\u2019Su Ming continued to think in silence, then sighed in relief before quietly walking forward. Gradually, his face changed, and his body became stronger. His clothes too, changed. Very soon, when he came out of the darkness, Su Ming had turned into the incredibly mysterious Mo Su, whose name now rang through all the corners of Wind Stream City!Su Ming blasted forth into the deeper parts of Wind Stream City with shocking speed.Wu Sen\u2019s house was very easy to find. Once Su Ming turned into Mo Su, he would know where Wu Sen stayed once he asked around. Besides, even if he was well-known in Wind Stream Tribe, only a few hundred people had seen his face, hence he did not attract too much attention.The Wind Stream Tribe member who had told Su Ming where Wu Sen stayed also did not know that the person before him was the Mo Su, who had been unassuming until he shocked everyone!As for why he would tell Su Ming where Wu Sen stayed, it was because Su Ming had brought out one of the very few stone coins left in his possession. Besides, the members of Wind Stream Tribe were used to it during these last days. He knew that there were a lot of outsiders who had been fighting against each other to meet the prodigies within Wind Stream.Yet while the number of people who wanted to see them was great, the ones who were summoned were few.Wu Sen stayed in a house located at the eastern corner of the mudstone city. It was very quiet there, and it was especially so during the night. Night turned the entire place dark. There may be lamps around, but they were few in number and were scattered around. Su Ming could only see the outlines of the houses with the help of the moonlight.Among the many mudstone houses was a house that took up a lot of space. It was also isolated as it stood out from among its surroundings. That was Wu Sen\u2019s house.As one of the prodigies in Wind Stream Tribe, Wu Sen\u2019s status was very high. His dwelling place would also naturally be different. There were four houses in his courtyard, which let out an eerie feeling in the silence of the night.The courtyard was very big but also deserted. It looked desolate and deathly still under the moonlight.The four houses were dark, as if there was no one within them. In the past, it was not so. Wu Sen\u2019s followers would usually guard this place at all times to show just how unique and special he was.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNow, there was no one in them. There was no way of telling whether those people had left because Wu Sen\u2019s rank fell, or because he did not want others to find out that he had weakened and chased them all out.Su Ming stood hundreds of feet away from the courtyard. He remained silent, his shadow lengthened by the moonlight until it seemed to fuse together with the darkness around him.He looked at the courtyard before him. After a while, he slowly walked forward until he was near the door to the courtyard. Without any hesitation, he pushed it open. The moment the wooden door swung open, it made a creaking sound in the silence that spread around him.The four houses in the courtyard were still silent, as if no one had noticed him. It felt like no one was here.Nonetheless, when Su Ming stood outside, he felt a presence of Qi from the second house. From the strength of the Qi, Su Ming could tell that the person was around the fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. It may have been slightly weaker than what he had sensed when he\u2019d returned and cast a glance at Wu Sen, but once he thought about it, Wu Sen\u2019s weakening might be continuous. This then would be understandable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He moved towards it step by step without any hesitation. When he was just outside the house, he pushed open the door.The moment the door was open, Su Ming heard a muffled growl, followed quickly by two green arms with an air of slaughter and death rushing towards him abruptly.A light flickered through Su Ming\u2019s eyes. His face was blank. He had already dared to destroy whatever Wu Sen sent his way when his power had been weaker than his. Adding to the fact that it was night now and his strength was much greater than Wu Sen\u2019s, who was constantly weakening at that, there was no reason for Su Ming to be afraid. The moment the green figure charged towards him, he lifted his right foot and stomped on the ground!The 160 blood veins manifested explosively on his body, creating an incredible force. He did not retreat even one step. With just the formidable force coming from him, he faced the green figure launching towards him.The green figure flinched due to the force coming from Su Ming\u2019s Qi and broke down abruptly, turning into green bits of glittering light that scattered around the room, causing the originally dark room to be cast in green light.Wu Sen was a mess. His face was pale as he sat down cross-legged in the house. He glared at Su Ming, a trickle of blood running down the corner of his mouth. It was clear that the moment Su Ming came in, he forcefully cast a Berserker Art, but it could not even touch Su Ming. Instead, as the Berserker Art was dispelled, Wu Sen was injured.\u201cMo Su!\u201d Wu Sen\u2019s eyes were filled with vexation and madness as he growled.Su Ming\u2019s face was calm, not at all affected by Wu Sen\u2019s insanity. He lifted his foot and walked into the house. He stood a few dozens of feet away from Wu Sen and looked at him coldly.\u201cLooks like you\u2019ve truly become weaker. Even those followers of yours who have been offering you the blood from the center of their brows are gone without a trace,\u201d Su Ming said, opening his mouth slowly and speaking unhurriedly.Veins popped on Wu Sen\u2019s face, but there was also bitterness. He had heard the sound of the courtyard door opening and felt shocked and fearful. He had only heard the sound, but could not feel any traces of Qi. It was as if the door to the courtyard opened by itself.Nonetheless, he had felt a sense of danger. It was especially so when the door to his house was pushed open. At that moment, that sense of danger reached its peak. He casted the Berserker Art without a care for consequences. Yet it failed. When he was just about to dash out of the house, he saw the face of the person standing outside his house.Once he saw him, Wu Sen gave up on charging out, because the person who came was Mo Su. It was the Mo Su who he highly suspected, but did not dare to offend!He was tied to Ye Wang, and Wu Sen saw with his own eyes what it meant to be a person who could shock the world. This sort of prodigy could only make Wu Sen feel bitter. Nevertheless, Wu Sen was not dumb. He was incredibly smart, in fact. He had a hunch as to why this person came, but he could not find it within himself to believe it.\u201cYou stole my Blood of Corpses, causing me to continue weakening as time passes. With my status and how I\u2019ve oppressed them in the past, once they know that I\u2019ve become weaker, it won\u2019t be good for me!\u201d Wu Sen closed his eyes and took in a deep breath. When he opened his eyes again, the veins on his face had already faded away, and his expression was back to normal.When Su Ming saw how quickly Wu Sen returned to his usual state and the traces of his anger and dissatisfaction could no longer be found, and that he had also chosen not to hide the fact that he was weakening, Su Ming grew to admire him a little.\u201cI have offended you previously. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d While speaking, Wu Sen stood up and bowed towards Su Ming.Su Ming\u2019s face was schooled to a blank look, but his impression of Wu Sen improved even more. He looked at Wu Sen just as Wu Sen met his gaze squarely. They both stared at each other for a long while before Su Ming laughed suddenly.\u201cIt\u2019s indeed much easier negotiating with smart people. Name a price.\u201dWu Sen forcefully quelled his excitement. He no longer harbored any thoughts of fighting against this person. In his mind, he no longer had the right to do so. He was not as powerful as Mo Su, neither was his fame as great as his. According to his own analysis, this person might very soon be received by the Elder and would accept guidance within Wind Stream Tribe. He did not wish to become enemies with this sort of person.His only hope was to retrieve his Blood of Corpses and recover his power as quickly as possible. After all, once morning arrived, the second test would start, and that stage was incredibly important to him.\u201cWhat do you want of me? I only have one Berserker Vessel, and it is one that matches with my Berserker Art. The elder gave it to me, so I cannot exchange it with you\u2026\u201d Wu Sen spoke up after hesitating for a while. The Blood of Corpses was much more important than the Berserker Vessel to him. Even so, he did not dare exchange the Vessel for his Blood. After all, all Berserker Vessels belonged to the tribe and were not owned by anyone.\u201cI don\u2019t want any Berserker Vessel. Let\u2019s use stone coins to exchange it. 5,000 coins and it\u2019s yours!\u201d As Su Ming spoke, he took out a small bottle from his bosom. The threads of moonlight surrounding the bottle disappeared the moment his hand touched the bottle, though no one noticed it.Wu Sen\u2019s heart pounded against his chest when he saw the small bottle. Yet the moment he heard Su Ming\u2019s words, he could only smile bitterly.\u201cBrother Mo, I\u2026 I only have 3,000 something\u2026\u201dSu Ming did not speak. He only looked at Wu Sen quietly. After a while, he put the bottle back into his bosom silently and said, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then once you have enough stone coins, come find me.\u201dAnxiety immediately appeared on Wu Sen\u2019s face. If he could get the Blood of Corpses tonight, then he would have hope to win tomorrow. Yet if he could not get it back today, then when he entered the second stage of the test tomorrow, his results would pummel to the ground.Besides, he had no idea how he could even look for the mysterious Mo Su. If he left now, then even if he gathered enough stone coins, it would be difficult for him to regain his Blood of Corpses.\u201cWait\u2026 Brother Mo, how about this? Please wait here for a while. I\u2019ll go and gather some stone coins now. It\u2019ll take at most two hours, and then I\u2019ll return. Can you\u2026 can you wait for me for two hours?\u201d Wu Sen immediately said.Su Ming frowned. He cast a glance at Wu Sen and no longer paid any attention to him. He turned around, intending to leave. There was no way he would wait here like an idiot. It did not matter whether Wu Sen would start plotting against him or not, Su Ming would still remain vigilant.\u201cBrother Mo, wait! I really only have 3,300 stone coins. How about this? I\u2019ll add this together to trade with you. What do you think?\u201d Wu Sen panicked. He took a few steps forward, then seemingly gritted his teeth and took out a wooden box from a corner of the house.Right before Su Ming\u2019s eyes, and with great reluctance, Wu Sen opened the box. There was a purple seven leafed herb lying within.The herb was very peculiar. Each leaf was divided another seven times. The order of the leaves made it look slightly messy at first glance.\u201cThis Seven Hearts is incredibly rare. I found it by accident. This thing costs several thousand stone coins!\u201d Wu Sen looked at Su Ming and quickly handed him the herb.The moment Su Ming looked at the herb, his heart immediately raced. He took it into his hands and looked at it carefully before confirming the identity of the herb. This was one of the two herbs he had not seen before that were required to create South Asunder!Su Ming closed the lid on the wooden box without batting an eyelid. He looked at Wu Sen with a face as if he was hesitating.Wu Sen felt incredibly nervous. After a while, when he saw Su Ming nod his head, the exhilaration on his face could not be hidden. He immediately took out white stone coins that were worth a hundred each and placed them into a bag before handing it to Su Ming respectfully.Su Ming checked it. Once he was certain there were no mistakes, he took out the bottle and returned it to Wu Sen.\u201cYour Blood of Corpses is incredibly valuable. Don\u2019t lose it again.\u201d Su Ming looked at him profoundly before turning around and leaving the room, disappearing into the darkness bathed in moonlight.Wu Sen held onto the bottle. As he watched Su Ming leave, his expression kept changing. After some time, he gave a long sigh and completely gave up on the idea of harming Su Ming.Back in Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings, Su Ming looked at the thirty something white stone coins in his hands, feeling incredibly excited. He had never had so much money before. As he looked at the stone coins that were emitting a glittering white glow, Su Ming could not help himself but bring them one by one to his eyes so that he could take a cloer look at them. This sort of feeling, where he obtained such a large fortune, was akin to the feeling when he had previously become the center of attention.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen his pockets were suddenly filled with so many stone coins from compared to its previously empty state, it made Su Ming feel as if he had just become a spendthrift person. After all, this was the first time he had obtained so much money.\u201cIf Lei Chen knew how much money I have, he would definitely be staring at me wide-eyed and stuttering in disbelief.\u201d There was a faint hint of youthful pridefulness on Su Ming\u2019s face. More importantly, he felt as if he had gotten this amount of money without any effort and without paying much of a price. This was different from the time he had sold that one Scattering Dust for a hundred stone coins.\u201cWu Sen is so rich. It\u2019s understandable that he would have this amount of money as one of the prodigies in Wind Stream. But after this trade, I doubt that he has much left.\u201d Su Ming did not believe one bit that Wu Sen had only this amount of money, but there would not be much left for him either way.Su Ming had already thought about all possible future troubles clearly. For one, his power was greater than Wu Sen\u2019s, hence even if he met Wu Sen during the day, it would still be alright for him. More importantly, Wu Sen did not know that Mo Su was Su Ming. He had no idea where to look for him either. With these, as long as Su Ming\u2019s identity was not exposed, he would be safe.Furthermore, it was also unknown whether Wu Sen would even dare to try to cause trouble for him. There was, in fact, a high possibility that Wu Sen would choose to endure it and not provoke him. After all, Wu Sen was not a fool. He knew how to act accordingly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had thought about it carefully before finding courage to look for Wu Sen.\u2018Tomorrow morning, I\u2019ll go and get enough herbs when everyone from Wind Stream Tribe is paying all their attention to the second stage of the test,\u2019 Su Ming thought in his heart and placed all the stone coins into his bosom.He did not think that they were heavy. Although it made the area around his chest bloated, the satisfaction in his heart made him not care about the weight.Once he put away all the stone coins, Su Ming took out the small wooden box and opened it. Once he saw the seven-leaved herb inside, a bright look appeared in his eyes. This thing was as important as the stone coins. He did not expect to obtain this from Wu Sen. This was one of the two herbs he had never seen before that he would need if he wanted to create South Asunder.\u2018So it\u2019s called Seven Hearts\u2026 It\u2019s a pity he didn\u2019t have the other herb, or else I could try making South Asunder. I wonder what the effects of this pill are compared to Mountain Spirit.\u2019Su Ming looked at the herb for a few more moments before placing it close to his person. If anyone had looked at his chest then, they would have been able to tell that there were a lot of things hidden away there.However, Su Ming could not do anything else about it. He had too much stuff that he had to take with him.Once he arranged everything, Su Ming sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes. He did not activate his Qi to train, but chose instead to recall the method to cast Dark Blood Dust and tried to practice the Berserker Art.This was the second Berserker Art he could train and cast. Compared to Spirit Devourer, this Art had more devastating power, but could not be used repeatedly.Time passed by slowly, and no other words were spoken that night.When the first rays of sunlight fell from the sky and morning arrived, the entire Wind Stream City woke up from its slumber. Noises began to reverberate around the city as it gradually grew in volume.Today was another day of the grand ceremony. It was the second stage of the test! This stage was no longer a test of potential, but a test of power and speed, which was directly related to participants\u2019 cultivation. The venue of the test was again, not in Wind Stream City, but located at the giant field with the nine eagle statues, which was at the foot of Wind Stream Mountain.The moment morning was over, the tribe members in Wind Stream City left one after another towards the field. It was the same for Dark Mountain Tribe. With the Head of the Guards and Shan Hen guiding them, Bei Ling, Lei Chen, and Wu La walked out of their lodgings. However, the elder did not follow them this time.Even after everyone had left and Su Ming came out of his room, he did not see the elder. He did not know where the elder had went, but once he thought about it, he did not pay too much attention to it. The elder should be with Wind Stream Tribe\u2019s Elder at the moment.When he walked out of the lodgings, Su Ming did not change his appearance. He had discovered that the Berserker Vessel that the elder had given him could not alter his appearance as completely as he pleased. Right now, it could only maintain Mo Su\u2019s appearance and the one he had used when he snatched away the Blood of Corpses from Wu Sen that night.Even if he could change his appearance into a third different look, there would be something off about it. That was a clear sign of the limit of this item. That was why he chose not to alter his appearance and used his original look to walk around Wind Stream City. Still, he had prepared himself. He bought a few beast skin shirts to wrap around his body. He also wrapped up his head until his eyes were the only things left visible.His appearance might have seemed odd, but there were quite a few people disguised this way within Wind Stream City. It was clear that they did not want anyone remembering how they looked like when they were buying things.There were fewer people walking in Wind Stream City. Most of them had already gone to watch the second stage of the test in the field.Since there were fewer people here, not only were there less people wandering about the streets, even those who went to the stalls were few and far in-between. Su Ming\u2019s target was clear as he walked through the streets. He might not be completely familiar with Wind Stream City, but he knew about the few places that were specifically used for trading.There were some houses that specialised in selling herbs. They were the main places Su Ming intended to visit. There was one such shop right before him at the moment. It had no name, and it was not a big stall, but there was a tribe member from Wind Stream Tribe lying on the table yawning. When he saw Su Ming coming in, he cast him a glance and quickly stood up.Without even waiting for the person to speak, Su Ming spoke slowly with a coarse voice.\u201cI want 100 Cloud Gauze Grass!\u201d While speaking, he brought out his right hand from his sleeve and placed it lightly on the table. A white stone coin appeared in his hand.The eyes of the person from Wind Stream Tribe immediately brightened. He was used to customers like Su Ming. He knew that these sort of people did not want anyone inquiring about their identity. They did not need anyone introducing them herbs either. Their targets were always very clear.Without a hint of hesitation, the Wind Stream Tribe member immediately nodded his head and went into the house. Before long, he took out a bag made of hides and placed it before Su Ming.Su Ming took it and looked into the bag briefly. It was filled with Cloud Gauze Grass. The number should also be 100. This herb was not so easily sold outside, and it was rare for anyone to possess such a huge amount outside the city, but it was a common herb within the mudstone city.He took the bag and left the stall. With the same method, Su Ming visited dozens of other shops. He bought a large amount of Cloud Gauze Grass from each shop and also a large number of some other supplementary herbs as well.He also bought some herbs that he did not need as an act of caution. By doing so, even if his actions caught someone\u2019s attention, they could not figure out his intentions.Within less than half a day, there were only 1,000 something stone coins left in his possession from the 3,000 something stone coins he had before he started. The speed with which he spent his money made Su Ming\u2019s heart clench in pain, but he had no choice. This was the first time he felt that quenching pills was difficult if he did not have enough money to buy the things he needed.\u2018Ah, I\u2019ll have to use this money sparingly\u2026 I\u2019m spending my money too quickly.\u2019Su Ming\u2019s face was bitter. There were bags made of hides of all sizes hanging off his person. He had too much stuff, and it caused him a headache, but he had no choice.\u2018I should have enough. I\u2019ll put them away in the lodgings first, only then can I come back and continue buying stuff.\u2019Su Ming made up his mind and quickly walked back towards Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings.He only took a few steps before he stopped. His brows crinkled slightly, but quickly relaxed. His expression was blank as he continued walking forward.Before him, there was an old man with a sharp mouth and cheeks of a monkey. He had his head lowered, clearly deep in thought. There was a prideful look on his face as he mumbled under his breath and twitched the fingers on his right hand as if calculating something.Su Ming walked calmly towards him. The moment he brushed shoulders with the old man, Su Ming heard what he was mumbling about.\u201cI earned big this time. It\u2019s all thanks to Mo Su, or else I\u2019d have definitely lost a lot of money this time. He\u2019s a great person, a great person indeed.\u201dSu Ming\u2019s heart did not waver. He continued walking forward once he passed by the old man.However, the old man only took a few steps forward before he suddenly turned around and looked at Su Ming\u2019s back. His eyes flashed brightly as he looked at the number of bags hanging off Su Ming\u2019s body.\u201cFriend, please hold back,\u201d the old man immediately spoke.Su Ming frowned. He pretended he did not hear him. Not only did he not stop, he walked faster.\u201cAh, friend, stop!\u201d The old man quickly ran after him and blocked Su Ming\u2019s way. There was a familiar smile on his face, a smile Su Ming had seen before.A cold flash appeared briefly in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He did not speak, but chose to walk around him.The old man quickly took a few steps back. The smile did not disappear from his face as he quickly spoke, \u201cFriend, listen to me! I see that you\u2019ve bought a lot of stuff. You must have gone to a lot of stalls, but I have with me something good that those stalls don\u2019t have!\u201dSu Ming ignored him and continued walking forward, but the old man did not mind his attitude. He just followed Su Ming and continued chattering away.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cFriend, don\u2019t be so indifferent. I really have something good with me. Look at this herb. It may seem normal, but you know Mo Su, right? Let me tell you, it\u2019s only because Mo Su took this herb of mine that he became so famous during the first stage!\u201d While speaking, the old man took out a herb from his bosom and waved it beside Su Ming.Su Ming was getting increasingly annoyed by the old man\u2019s constant chattering. The old man seemed to have stuck himself on him and continued following him with an air of one who would continue pestering Su Ming until he relented and bought something. This was something Su Ming had prior experience of. Now that he experienced it again, it gave him a massive headache.\u201cYou don\u2019t believe me? Haha, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t, but let me tell you, I have something else. Look at this herb, it\u2019s so colorful and pretty, right? Let me tell you, Ye Wang used this during the final moment of the test.\u201cThis one too. You\u2019ve heard of Bi Su, right? This person was previously unknown, but do you know how he placed fourth? I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s because\u2026\u201d The old man\u2019s bosom seemed to be an endless pit that stored a countless number of herbs. He brought them out one by one as if he was worried Su Ming would not buy them and continued introducing new ones to him.\u201cBecause he ate that herb of yours, right.\u201d Su Ming felt as if his ears were buzzing when he interrupted the old man\u2019s words coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re right. It\u2019s precisely because of this herb. Achem, I haven\u2019t introduced myself. I\u2019m Bei Qiong. I specialize in selling mysterious and rare herbs in Wind Stream Tribe. Let me tell you, Ye Wang is a good friend of mine, Chen Chong is a great customer of mine, Wu Sen regularly comes to buy herbs from me, and that Mo Su, I\u2019m not lying to you, I really know Mo Su!\u201d The old man quickly took a large number of herbs and waved them before Su Ming\u2019s eyes.\u201cYe Wang regularly buys these.\u201d\u201cChen Chong regularly needs these.\u201d\u201cWu Sen always keeps these in store when he trains.\u201d\u201cMo Su already reserved these, I can\u2019t sell too much to you.\u201d The old man\u2019s hands were moving quickly, and he would bring out a large number of herbs every single time. The rapid change could make anyone confused.\u201cI\u2019m not interested. If you continue following me, then don\u2019t blame me for taking drastic action!\u201d A cold glare appeared briefly in Su Ming\u2019s eyes as he cast the old man a glance, then he quickly took a few steps further away from him.\u201cHuh? Friend, you seem familiar\u2026 You\u2026 you\u2026 I remember now, you\u2019re\u2026\u201d The old man looked at Su Ming, and when he saw that Su Ming\u2019s face was covered by hides, it became clear to him that Su Ming did not want anyone seeing his face. He had met a lot of this kind of people in the past, and he knew just what they were afraid of. That was why an exaggerated look appeared on his face, and he exclaimed, almost as if he was just about to let out a slip of his tongue.Su Ming\u2019s footsteps paused for a moment, but he had been very intelligent since he was young, and coupled with the elder\u2019s guidance and teachings, it was impossible for him to be fooled by such a cheap trick. He laughed coldly in his heart and continued walking forward without bothering about the old man.There was not a hint of awkwardness on the old man\u2019s face when he saw that his ploy did not work. Instead, a fighting spirit was lit in his eyes as if he would not throw away any chance to sell his wares easily. It was especially so when he saw the numerous bags hanging off Su Ming\u2019s body and became certain that this person was rich. He would definitely not let him off.He quickly ran a few steps forward and caught up to Su Ming. He changed his words once more and continued bringing out the herbs from his bosom\u2026Su Ming was irritated. He was just about to use his maximum speed and shake off the old man when he saw the old man bringing out another large amount of herbs from his bosom. A thought occurred in his head.\u201cAre these herbs really as powerful as you say they are?\u201d Su Ming stopped and cast a glance at the old man\u2019s chest as he spoke slowly.The moment the old man heard Su Ming\u2019s words, he became excited and immediately patted his chest. Nodding his head, he spoke with a serious expression, \u201cFriend, don\u2019t worry. I am equally honest to children and old people alike, I don\u2019t lie!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s face was colored with hesitation.The old man became even more excited and took a few steps forward quickly before he whispered, \u201cThere\u2019re too many people here. It\u2019s not easy for us to trade. Let\u2019s go over there. It\u2019s quieter there, and it\u2019s perfect for us to trade my goods.\u201d As the old man spoke, he put on a wary face and looked at his surroundings before pointing towards a remote alley situated not far away.Su Ming hesitated for a brief moment before he nodded.The old man quickly took a few steps with Su Ming, reaching the remote alley. There was no one there. He quelled his excitement and whispered, \u201cFriend, what do you like? Do you like Ye Wang\u2019s, or Chen Chong\u2019s, or Bi Su\u2019s? But friend, I can\u2019t sell too much of Mo Su\u2019s herbs to you.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t see them clearly just now, so I don\u2019t know what is good. If they\u2019re as great as you say, then I will consider buying some of all from you,\u201d Su Ming said, with hesitation still evident on his face as he cast a glance at the old man.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can let you see them.\u201d The old man immediately became even more excited. A smile also appeared on his face, and he quickly took out various types of herbs from his bosom. He brought out two to three herbs of each type.\u201cJust these? That\u2019s too little.\u201d Su Ming swept his gaze over the herbs and shook his head.\u201cThat\u2019s already a lot. These are all rare herbs, it\u2019s impossible that there would be a lot around.\u201d The old man was momentarily shocked before he quickly explained.Su Ming did not speak, but instead reached into his bosom with his right hand and took out a small bag. He opened it before the old man and revealed nearly ten white stone coins inside.The old man stared at the stone coins with brilliant eyes. After a few deep breaths, his face became incredibly grave and he looked around before stepping closer towards Su Ming and whispered, \u201cFriend, since you\u2019re so sincere, I\u2019ll tell you the truth. I have a hundred something of each type of herb in stock. It\u2019s not that they\u2019re not precious, but I have my own method of obtaining them. Since you really want to buy them, I\u2019ll take all of them out for you to see.\u201dAs the old man spoke, he took out handfuls upon handfuls of herbs and placed them all on the ground. Before long, the ground was filled with more than a thousand herbs.\u201cThat\u2019s all I have. I\u2019ve placed all my herbs here. 1,000 stone coins and it\u2019s all yours!\u201d The old man was very nervous while looking at Su Ming.If these herbs were all placed together, then a very large sack would be needed. It was impossible to place them all within his bosom. Su Ming\u2019s heart pounded against his chest. He stared at the old man\u2019s chest, and something flashed through his eyes.\u201cHow did you manage to place all those herbs within your bosom? What\u2019s hanging on your chest?\u201dThe moment the old man heard his words, his face became wary. He quickly took a few steps back and covered his chest, a fearful and shocked expression appearing on his face.\u201cStop pretending. I won\u2019t buy these herbs, but if you have a bag that can place all these herbs inside, then I might consider buying one of your bags,\u201d Su Ming spoke slowly.\u201cI won\u2019t sell it!\u201d the old man said immediately, letting out a loud harrumph after.Su Ming held the bag containing the stone coins and swung it lightly. The sound of stone coins knocking against each other could be heard from within. The sound was very clear and melodious, causing the old man\u2019s face to become conflicted.\u201c5,000 stone coins! Give me 5,000 stone coins and I\u2019ll sell it to you.\u201d While speaking, the old man brought out a small bag the size of a palm from his bosom. The appearance of the thing was very peculiar. There was a round picture drawn on it by some unknown method. It seemed like it was drawn onto it, but if anyone looked closely, they would find that the picture was not drawn, but printed on the bag.It was a pity that there was a torn part on a corner of the cloth bag.\u201cThis is a treasure. It\u2019s rare even within Wind Stream Tribe. You can store a lot of items in here. Without 5,000 stone coins, don\u2019t even think about buying it from me,\u201d the old man stated while holding tightly onto the cloth bag.\u201cThere\u2019s a ripped part on the bag,\u201d Su Ming calmly pointed out.\u201cOf course. If it was in perfect shape, forget 5,000 stone coins, even if it was for 10,000 stone coins, I wouldn\u2019t sell it,\u201d the old man said proudly.\u201c500 stone coins. If you\u2019re not selling it, then forget it,\u201d Su Ming said after thinking for a moment.\u201cWhat? What did you say? 500 stone coins? Impossible!\u201d The old man\u2019s expression changed incredibly quickly. His face was now twisted in fury, as if the price given by Su Ming was a form of humiliation to him.\u201cYou\u2019ve said that you\u2019ve been selling herbs in Wind Stream Tribe for many years and have met a lot of prodigies. I don\u2019t believe that no one has seen through this as well. If you still have this bag with you, then it\u2019s clear that this isn\u2019t the only one you have. 500 stone coins, if you\u2019re not selling it, forget it,\u201d Su Ming told him calmly and turned around to leave.The old man stood there, wavering, and struggled with his thoughts. When he saw that Su Ming was really going to leave and was about to reach the end of the alley, the old man quickly yelled at him.\u201c800 stone coins\u2026 Ah, fine, 500 stone coins. 500 stone coins and it\u2019s yours!\u201dSu Ming stopped and turned his head, gesturing with his right hand. The old man went up to him with extreme reluctance. He handed the bag to Su Ming. Once Su Ming took it, he could immediately feel that the bag was light. In fact, the moment he touched the bag, a picture appeared in his head. It was a space that was about 30 feet in size. However, only half the space could be used. There were crack like marks on the other half of the space.\u201cHmph. You earned big this time, I\u2019m telling you. You can keep your items here once you pat them on the bag. If you want to take them out, all you need is just to think about it,\u201d the old man explained how to use the item, all the while grumbling under his breath.Su Ming was very curious. He took out an herb from one of his numerous bags and tried to place it in the bag using the method the old man just told him. Once he saw that what the old man told him was true, he could not help but smile.\u201cIt\u2019s good, right? I have a lot of good things with me. You got a great deal buying this for only 500 stone coins. Don\u2019t go out telling other people about it. Give me the money quickly.\u201d The old man looked dispirited as he held out his hand for the money.\u201cHalf of the space in there is torn. Is it due to the damage on the bag?\u201d Su Ming did not hand him the money immediately but asked instead.\u201cI don\u2019t know about that. I only have this with me, and I\u2019ve used it for many years. It\u2019s always been like this. Hurry up and give me the money.\u201d The old man quickly avoided the question.Su Ming looked at the old man with a profound look. He threw the torn bag to the old man and shook his head.\u201cWhat do you mean? You don\u2019t want it anymore?\u201d The old man was immediately stunned.\u201cNo matter how amazing it is, it\u2019s still a torn bag. It\u2019s not worth 500 stone coins. More importantly, I believe that before long, the crack within will slowly spread until I can no longer use it. In fact, there\u2019s even a possibility that I won\u2019t be able to take out the things from within. What\u2019s the use of this to me then?\u201d\u201cNo way. I\u2019ve been using this for many years. It definitely won\u2019t happen!\u201d the old man quickly guaranteed.\u201cI can\u2019t be certain about it. If I buy it, then I\u2019ll only give you 200 stone coins. After a few months, if it\u2019s truly as you say, then I\u2019ll give you the rest of the stone coins,\u201d Su Ming said with a casual tone.\u201cThat won\u2019t do. How am I supposed to find you then?\u201d The old man quickly shook his head.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, then forget it.\u201d Su Ming did not show any reluctance and turned around to leave.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAh, fine! I\u2019ll sell it to you for 200 stone coins! Three months later, you have to give me the remainder of the money. There aren\u2019t a lot of tribes around the region, and there\u2019re only so many people around. If you don\u2019t pay up, I\u2019ll still be able to find you,\u201d the old man said with a pained face as he handed the cloth bag to Su Ming once again.This time, Su Ming no longer pondered around and hesitated. He took out two white stone coins and took the cloth bag, completing the trade before he left the remote alley.The old man waited until Su Ming was long gone before the pained look on his face completely disappeared, replaced by a look of satisfaction. He took out another torn cloth bag from his bosom and placed all the herbs on the ground inside it. Then he let out a sigh.\u201cThat child is bright. He\u2019s much harder to fool compared to Ye Wang. Even Ye Wang spent 500 stone coins on this. He\u2019s even better, he only spent 200 and bought it.\u201cHmph. Once I sell a few more of these and they\u2019re used to it, then I\u2019ll start reaping my profits,\u201d the old man mumbled under his breath as excitement and anticipation appeared on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, to Berserkers, this sort of cold was bearable. Besides, winter season was about to be over.Snow was falling from the sky as if winter refused to leave and wanted to remind all the living beings on earth that it was still around.The snow was not heavy initially, but before long, vast amounts of it fell from the sky. It swept through the land as a strong blast of wind suddenly stirred up in the region. As the wind moaned, the snow danced.It was snowing heavily by noon. It may not have covered everything, but as the wind swept away the snow, it obscured the sky, like a layer of darkness suddenly falling on the land.Su Ming walked through the streets of the mudstone city. Snow was falling on him: his shirt, hair, and some even crept into the beast skins covering his head, falling on the tip of his nose.The snow had come suddenly. Before Su Ming had managed to go back to Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings, his path was cut off by the heavy snowfall. Su Ming walked briskly in the snow and left behind a trail of footprints, but they were soon covered by falling snowflakes and gone without a trace.This was perhaps the last snowfall this winter.As Su Ming exhaled, his breath turned into white fog. After a while, once he was certain no one was following him, he took a few turns and returned to his lodgings. The wind was stronger, and the snow fell heavier. Standing at the door, Su Ming stomped on the ground with all his might until he shook off all the snow from his person. Only then did he go into the house.It was much warmer inside compared to when he was outside. Su Ming closed the door and took off all the hides wrapped around his entire body. He cast them aside and placed all the hide bags filled with herbs on the ground, then activated his Qi and circulated it throughout himself until he got rid of the chill in his body. Once he did so, he sat down cross-legged and brought out the small torn bag, observing it carefully.\u2018This bag is very mysterious. It can hold so many things within\u2026 But there must be something wrong with it because Bei Qiong sold it to me far too easily\u2026\u2019Something flashed through Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He had suspected it before, and the more he thought about it, the more he thought that Bei Qiong\u2019s actions were off.After a moment of thought, he brought out some herbs that had no use to him and placed them into the bag before attempting to take them out. He found nothing wrong with the process.\u2018I still have to be careful. After all, these herbs are all that I have. If I put them all in and something happens, then it\u2019ll be terrible\u2026\u2019Su Ming scratched his head and decided to just put the thought aside. He would wait a few more days. Once everything calmed down, then he would have the elder look at the bag.Su Ming put the bag away and sat down cross-legged. As he was circulating his Qi, he slowly concentrated on learning Dark Blood Dust. He had to hurry up and learn the Art so that he could cast it during a real battle.As for his original plan to walk around the mudstone city again and see whether he had anything else he wanted to buy, it was cancelled due to the huge snowfall outside.The wind and snow were whistling outside. Su Ming sat down quietly in his room. Time passed by slowly. Soon, it was dusk outside. When there was no snow falling, it would usually be rather bright during dusk. Yet today, there was a hint of darkness even though the sun was still out. He could not see clearly into the distance. All he could see was the snow falling from the sky. However, due to it, there was a hint of silver light reflecting off the surface of the newly covered ground in the dim light.The snow was still falling heavily. Before long, Su Ming\u2019s ears twitched, and he got up. When he stood up and opened the door to his room, he saw Bei Ling and the others walking back.These people weren\u2019t talking among themselves as they did yesterday. It might have been because the snow was falling too heavily. Once Bei Ling cast a glance at Su Ming, he quickly went back into his own room. Wu La looked dull, as if she could not lift her spirits up. She too, returned to her own room.Only Lei Chen smiled at Su Ming good-naturedly and approached him. He looked as if he wanted to tell Su Ming what he saw during the day.The Head of the Guards was frowning, caught up in his thoughts. He would look at the sky occasionally, and there would be a hint of worry on his face. Shan Hen still looked indifferent. He no longer took note of Su Ming and went back into his room.\u201cSu Ming, the second stage of the test was seriously very intense today. The test of strength and speed reflects our current level of power!\u201cYe Wang is indeed the strongest among the youths in Wind Stream. He\u2019s just too powerful. He surpassed Chen Chong by way too much, and he\u2019s placed second! That Bi Su from Black Mountain Tribe will definitely become a great enemy of ours. He was ranked third. He seems to be at the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm, and he\u2019s really strong!\u201cIt\u2019s a pity Mo Su didn\u2019t appear, or else it\u2019d have been even more exciting.\u201cAh\u2026 I didn\u2019t manage to get into the top 50, neither did Wu La. Only Bei Ling managed to place 49th. The second stage may have been over quickly, but it was really magnificent!\u201cI heard that the third stage will only be held three days later. It\u2019s a test of real combat. It should be even more exciting!\u201dLei Chen spoke excitedly with Su Ming in his room for a long time. He told him everything that he saw and experienced that day. He wanted to continue speaking, but when he saw that Su Ming\u2019s interest was not great, he spoke for a little while longer before leaving while yawning.Lei Chen had also taken part in the test that day and was a little exhausted.When Lei Chen left, Su Ming waited until dusk was over and the snowstorm was also slightly lighter outside before he stood up with his heart pounding against his chest. He left his room feeling nervous but eager.This time, Shan Hen did not appear when Su Ming walked out of Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings. The sky was dark, but the land was lit with a silver glow. Snow fell from the sky, and it caused Su Ming to experience an indescribable feeling.After a long while of walking in the snowstorm, Su Ming changed his appearance and turned into Mo Su. He approached Dark Dragon Tribe\u2019s lodgings and stood there, waiting.Time gradually passed by, and the snowstorm continued. As snow kept falling from the sky, the door to Dark Dragon Tribe opened silently and Bai Ling poked out her beautiful head from within. She wore a white shirt and had multiple furs decorating her neck.She looked incredibly beautiful.She looked around for a moment. When she saw Su Ming, a shy look immediately appeared on her petite face, but there was also happiness that was difficult to conceal. She took a few brisk steps and stood in front of Su Ming. They looked at each other and smiled.\u201cYou must have waited for a long time,\u201d Bai Ling said softly.\u201cNo, I just arrived.\u201d Su Ming scratched his head as he looked at Bai Ling standing before him. He had never seen such a beautiful person in his life. As he looked at the sight of the snow causing Bai Ling\u2019s cheeks to color a light red and at her twinkling eyes, which held a hint of bashfulness, Su Ming\u2019s heart pounded even more quickly.\u201cWhat are you looking at..? You look like an idiot. Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to \u2018walk in circles\u2019?\u201d Bai Ling\u2019s face became even redder, but she did not look away from Su Ming\u2019s gaze. Instead, she blinked and chuckled softly.\u201cAh, yes. Haha.\u201d Su Ming touched his nose. The two of them walked into the distance under the snowstorm amidst Bai Ling\u2019s laughter.When they disappeared into the snowstorm, Si Kong sat in Dark Dragon Tribe\u2019s lodgings with a conflicted look. He wanted to go and watch them, but in the end gave up on the idea with a long sigh.The old woman was also inside Dark Dragon Tribe\u2019s lodgings. She was sitting inside her room. She knew that Bai Ling had gone out, but she did not stop her. In her mind, if Bai Ling could be together with Mo Su, then it was the best possible outcome.The wind bellowed, and snow danced in the air. In that snowstorm, Su Ming and Bai Ling walked through an alley in the mudstone city. The snow fell around them and gave off an attractive glimmer. It landed on the roofs and the buildings situated on both sides of the alley, causing the place to turn into a world of snow.There were few people who walked outside during this kind of night. Su Ming was very nervous. The quick witted intelligence he displayed last time when he spoke to Bai Ling was gone. Only after his hand was taken by Bai Ling, and he felt the sweat and smoothness of her palm did Su Ming snap back from his stupor and clutched Bai Ling\u2019s small hand.Bai Ling lowered her head. She looked incredibly beautiful when her rosy cheeks were illuminated by the snow.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 take a walk around\u2026\u201d Su Ming whispered and lowered himself down. A bashful smile appeared on Bai Ling\u2019s face, and she laid on Su Ming\u2019s back. The warmth that was emitted from Su Ming\u2019s back made her feel happy.Su Ming breathed in the light fragrance coming from behind him and felt the similar warmth coming from Bai Ling\u2019s petite body. He took in a deep breath and dashed forward, jumping over the mudstone walls surrounding the city and left them behind himself.Bai Ling\u2019s heart raced against her chest. She could also feel Su Ming\u2019s heart pounding as he ran. They welcomed the snowstorm falling on the plains outside Wind Stream Tribe and continued running further away into the quiet and secluded plains.Snow fell on their bodies, but they did not feel cold. Instead, the warmth they felt in their hearts surrounded their bodies. When they were outside the city, Su Ming\u2019s appearance reverted to his original look.\u201cBai Ling, why does it feel like you\u2019ve grown heavier..?\u201d Su Ming\u2019s voice contained hints of happiness as he laughed into the snowy night.\u201cNonsense!\u201d Bai Ling was originally immersed in the warmth coming from Su Ming\u2019s back, but the moment she heard his words, she immediately glared at him and pinched him.Su Ming winced in pain, but his laughter became even more joyful. He jumped abruptly, causing Bai Ling to yelp in surprise, and continued running forward. His laughter and Bai Ling\u2019s rebukes overlapped with each other and created a beautiful noise.Happy moments always went by too quickly. It was already midnight before they even noticed it. Su Ming and Bai Ling walked in the snow, holding hands and whispering to each other like they would never run out of topics to talk to about. The laughter that occasionally rang out between them also showed just how beautiful the moment was for them.Snow continued falling. It landed on their bodies and their heads. If anyone looked at them from a distance, they would think Su Ming and Bai Ling\u2019s hair was almost entirely white.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey wondered whether they could continue walking like this until their heads turned white, or perhaps\u2026 they would look back at these days and sigh because they\u2019ve lost them.\u201cDo you still remember the night when we were at Dark Mountain? It was also snowing\u2026\u201d\u201cI do. I remember your hair was dyed white by snow.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the same. You turned into an old woman.\u201d\u201cSay, if we continue walking in the snow like this, will we walk until our heads eventually turn white..?\u201d Bai Ling whispered, holding Su Ming\u2019s hand, and there was a hint of fragility in her voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It connected the heavens and earth, turning it into a timeless and unforgettable sight. The snow swayed in the air and fell before Su Ming. As wind blew and whistled by, the white coating would be lifted from the ground and dance with the snowflakes falling from the sky.There were some snow that floated before Bai Ling in the wind and passed by both of her bone earrings, falling on her neck, which was covered by her thick shirt, and melting.While listening to Bai Ling\u2019s soft muttering by his ear, warmth grew in Su Ming\u2019s heart and travelled through his entire body. That warmth then turned into a special feeling. There was a pleasant word to describe it \u2013 happiness.It was a beautiful night, with beautiful snow, and there were two people immersed in happiness.Su Ming smiled. It was a faint smile filled with happiness and the innocence of a young boy. He stopped and looked at Bai Ling. At that moment, the girl in the snow looked as if she had turned into a timeless picture, and the image was ingrained deeply in Su Ming\u2019s memories \u2013 the image of the white snow, her white clothes, the girl who was as beautiful as the snow, and the words she was whispering quietly.Bai Ling was very pretty. Some ice fragments stuck to her trembling eyelashes. Su Ming continued looking at her and felt that everything had disappeared from the world. It was as if the only ones that existed were the two of them.After a long while, when Bai Ling\u2019s cheeks slowly turned even redder due to Su Ming\u2019s gaze, he raised his right hand and took off the fang necklace hanging on his neck. He took off the biggest fang, which was the size of his little finger, and handed it to Bai Ling.The fang was completely white. It was crescent in shape, and there were two words carved on it. Those words were Su Ming\u2019s own name. The fang emanated a fierce presence.\u201cThe elder gave this fang to me when I took part in my first Berserker\u2019s Awakening when I was seven. This is something I really like. I\u2019ll\u2026 give it to you.\u201d There was a smile on Su Ming\u2019s face, but he was feeling nervous. In their tribes, handing over this thing as a gift held a special meaning.Bai Ling pursed her lips. Her face turned even redder, and her heart raced against her chest. The sounds of her heart pounding made everything disappear from her eyes, leaving only Su Ming.After a long while, Bai Ling gently lifted her pale hand and took the fang. The moment she touched it, her fingers shook. She held it lightly in her hand.Su Ming was nervous. When he saw that Bai Ling was only looking at the fang and had no intention to do anything else after a while, he scratched his head, causing some of the snow on his hair to fall.Bai Ling cast a glance at Su Ming. When she saw his silly act, she covered her mouth and smiled. There was a mischievous look in her eyes and an indescribable warmth that could make others melt.\u201cThat\u2026 Uhm, aren\u2019t you forgetting something?\u201d The moment Bai Ling laughed at him, Su Ming\u2019s face also turned red.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Bai Ling was still smiling. Her smile was really beautiful, and surrounded by the snow in the snowstorm, it created an unforgettable sight.Su Ming\u2019s face turned even redder, but very soon, he gritted his teeth and took a deep breath and looked at Bai Ling. He spoke seriously, \u201cBai Ling, I\u2019m your savior\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that you\u2019re my savior, but what does that have to do with me forgetting something?\u201d Bai Ling blinked.\u201cOf course it does. Urgh\u2026 Let\u2019s not talk about this. Eh? That bone earring of yours is really beautiful, let me have a look at one of them.\u201d Su Ming looked around and quickly changed the topic.The mirth in Bai Ling\u2019s eyes became even stronger, and with it, her slyness grew as well. She lifted her hand and touched the white bone earring on her left ear while looking at Su Ming.\u201cMy mom left this for me\u2026 I won\u2019t give it to you.\u201d Bai Ling laughed when she saw Su Ming\u2019s widened eyes. When he seemed to be about ready to snatch it, she immediately ran backwards. Her laughter travelled into the distance like silver bells.Nonetheless, even if she said that, she still held onto the fang Su Ming gave her in her hand like a piece of treasure.Su Ming glared, vexed, and immediately gave chase. The both of them laughed happily in the snow. Bai Ling did not give Su Ming the bone earring in the end, but Su Ming, ignorant as he may be, still felt something different within the gentleness in her eyes.Tired, Bai Ling sat down in the snow. She looked at the snow falling from the sky and asked lightly, \u201cSu Ming, what will we become in ten years..? Are we still going to be as carefree as we are now..?\u201dSu Ming placed both of his hands behind his head and laid down beside Bai Ling. The snow was very soft. He too, looked at the snow falling from the sky while listening to Bai Ling\u2019s words.\u201cAre you still angry?\u201d Bai Ling turned her head and looked at Su Ming with a smile as her beautiful eyes flashed brilliantly. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not mad.\u201d Su Ming let out a harrumph, but when he saw Bai Ling looking at him, a smile appeared on his face.\u201cTen years later, we\u2019ll definitely still be as carefree as we are now\u2026 And by that time, my level of cultivation will definitely be very high!\u201d There was an expectant look in Su Ming\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe elder told me yesterday that I\u2019ll be staying in Wind Stream Tribe in the future. I\u2019ll receive the same guidance as Ye Wang from Wind Stream\u2019s Elder\u2026 Perhaps in ten years\u2019 time, I\u2019ll be close to Awakening Realm.\u201d Su Ming laughed.As she listened to Su Ming\u2019s words, a look of anticipation appeared in Bai Ling\u2019s eyes. There was a happy smile on her face, and she continued talking with Su Ming in the snowy night, as if they would never finish talking to each other.Good times were always over too quickly. Although time in reality was passing by slowly, and there was still some time before daylight, all moments had to end eventually. Bai Ling had to return to the lodgings of her tribe. Both of them went back to the outskirts of the mudstone city.\u201cI\u2019ll send you back.\u201d Su Ming squatted down and gestured for Bai Ling to get on his back.There was a happy smile on Bai Ling\u2019s face. She laid on Su Ming\u2019s back once again obediently and felt Su Ming\u2019s heartbeat. The constant rhythm of it made her cheeks redden.\u201cIt\u2019s so stupid\u2026\u201d she whispered in a soft voice, lying on Su Ming\u2019s back while he ran.Su Ming continued running through the snowstorm with Bai Ling on his back and jumped over a remote section of the wall into the mudstone city. He also changed his appearance to that of Mo Su\u2019s. Su Ming stopped right outside Dark Dragon Tribe\u2019s lodgings, and Bai Ling climbed down from his back with a hint of reluctance.She looked at Su Ming, at the boy before her eyes. His face may have turned unfamiliar, but she would never forget his eyes.Su Ming also looked at Bai Ling. They gazed into each other\u2019s eyes as they stood on the snowy street.\u201cCome now, don\u2019t be angry anymore.\u201d Bai Ling raised her hand, and just like the last time they parted, she arranged Su Ming\u2019s clothes and patted away some of the snow off his person. There was a gentle smile on her face.\u201cThose bone earrings of yours are really pretty.\u201d Su Ming laughed.When she saw Su Ming behaving that way, Bai Ling laughed, too. As she continued laughing, she looked deeply at Su Ming. The bashful look became even more distinct on her delicate face, and she lowered her head gently.\u201cSu Ming\u2026 it\u2019ll be an important day for me seven days later\u2026 I\u2019ve always spent that day with my grandma in the past\u2026 This year, I want to spend that day with you\u2026 alright?\u201d Bai Ling said after gathering all her courage. Her voice was weak, but Su Ming still heard every word she said. Happiness appeared in his eyes, and he gave a huge nod without moving his eyes away from Bai Ling.\u201cThat\u2019s a promise\u2026\u201d Bai Ling smiled shyly, gazing into Su Ming\u2019s eyes.\u201cThat\u2019s a promise. Seven days later, no matter where I am, no matter what I\u2019m doing, I\u2019ll definitely come and find you\u2026\u201d Su Ming swore.The snow was still falling from the sky as if it was serving as a witness for the two people standing there. Still, it was unknown whether their promise\u2026 would turn into a beautiful memory\u2026 or into a regretful sigh.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely wait for you in the tribe that day\u2026 I\u2019ll give you the bone earring then\u2026\u201d Bai Ling whispered, touching the bone earring, and her ears also turned red.\u201cI\u2019ll definitely come!\u201d Su Ming smiled happily. Incredibly happily\u2026Bai Ling bit her lip. The bashful look was still on her face when she turned around and walked back towards the lodgings of her tribe. When she pushed open the door to the courtyard and walked in, she turned back and looked at Su Ming for a moment before disappearing into her lodgings.Su Ming stood where he was with happiness filling his entire heart. He also grew expectant towards the promise he made with Bai Ling of meeting seven days later.\u201cSeven days\u2026\u201d Su Ming smiled with happiness. He turned around and ran into the snowstorm, back towards where his tribe was located.The snowflakes also seemed to know about Su Ming\u2019s joy and danced around him. The snow from the ground was also lifted by the wind and seemed to have become a part of the space between the sky and the earth.Su Ming ran quickly. The bliss he felt in his heart had turned into warmth that surrounded his whole body. It made him forget all his troubles and worries. Very soon, he arrived at Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings.The moment he got back, Su Ming reverted to his original look. He looked at Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings, located not too far into the distance of the snowy night, and took a deep breath. He walked towards the lodgings cheerfully.It was quiet inside. It may have been night, but due to the snow falling from the sky, the night was glowing with a silvery night, hence it was not completely dark. Within the snowstorm, the door to Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings was shut tight, as if there was a depressing feeling coming from within. The moment Su Ming got closer, he sensed it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen he opened the door and saw the sight within the courtyard, he trembled. The happiness in his heart immediately disappeared, replaced with a panicked look on his face!The Head of the Guards, Shan Hen, Bei Ling, Lei Chen, and Wu La were all gathered in the courtyard. They had varying faces of panic that showed how frightened and anxious they were. Before them, the elder was sitting cross-legged with a pale face, panting harshly. Before him was a shocking pool of black blood staining the white snow on the ground.The moment Su Ming pushed open the door, all gazes were trained onto him.\u201cElder!\u201dSu Ming\u2019s mind went blank. He dashed madly forward until he arrived before the elder. For the first time in his life, he saw weakness on the elder\u2019s wizened face. Some of the black blood on the snow even stained the elder\u2019s clothes. Su Ming trembled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was no hint of color on his face, but he still looked at Su Ming with a gentle and loving smile.\u201cElder\u2026 What\u2026 What happened? Elder, you\u2026\u201d There was a roaring in Su Ming\u2019s head. When he saw how weakened the elder was, tears fell down his face. He was terrified. He did not know what to do. His mind was in a state of panic, even his voice trembled.\u201cElder\u2026 Lei Chen, what happened?\u201d Su Ming lifted his head abruptly and looked at Lei Chen. At that moment, he no longer cared about hiding his powers or his identity. There was only scorching anger raging in his heart. He wanted to know who injured the elder. Even if he was powerless to take revenge for him, he had to know!He did not speak loudly, but there was an indescribable might within his voice. The moment he looked at Lei Chen, tears also escaped from Lei Chen\u2019s eyes.\u201cI don\u2019t know either\u2026 the elder just came back\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright now, listen to me\u2026\u201d The elder took a deep breath and stood up from the ground. His expression was serious as he swept his gaze over everyone gathered in the courtyard.\u201cI went\u2026 to Black Mountain Tribe,\u201d the elder said slowly. His tone was low, but each syllable that fell into their ears sounded like thunder roaring.The Head of the Guards\u2019 expression immediately change. Beside him, a brief flash that was easily missed appeared in Shan Hen\u2019s eyes. As for Bei Ling, he took a sharp breath, and Wu La\u2019s face immediately turned pale.Su Ming was the same. They knew that the tribe was in danger, and the source of the threat was Black Mountain Tribe. They may not know the whole picture, but the depressing atmosphere within the tribe these past few days had made them see some hints.\u201cWhen you took part in the second stage, I went to Black Mountain Tribe\u2026 I wanted to see Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s Bi Tu\u2019s level of cultivation!\u201d the elder explained calmly. Everything was in dead silence, and there was only the sound of the elder speaking. It was as if even the sounds of the wind disappeared at that moment.\u201cHe\u2026 has indeed Awakened\u2026\u201d A bitter look appeared on the elder\u2019s face.The Head of the Guards fell silent, and a dark look settled on his face. He hesitated, as if he was thinking about what to say, but then the elder shaking his head. It seemed like the elder knew what the Head of the Guards was about to say.\u201cI had to go. Without knowing his real strength, I didn\u2019t want to make all of us\u2026 leave our homes and become affiliated to Wind Stream\u2026 Who would want to leave their home, the one which they and their ancestors have lived in for hundreds of years..?\u201d The elder\u2019s face was gloomy.\u201cTime is limited. I\u2019ve already recovered. I\u2019ll take you all back to the tribe now. Bi Tu may have Awakened, but he has not stabilized his power yet. I may be injured, but he can\u2019t make a move either. We\u2026 will migrate!\u201dA determined look settled on the elder\u2019s face, and his eyes shone with resolution. He swung his right hand, and the snow in the courtyard scattered as if burst apart. As the sound reverberated around them, the white carpet rose up into the air and knocked against the snow falling from the sky, forming a string of echoes.Glittering light appeared in the sky soon after and abruptly gathered together to form a gigantic dark python. The python looked fierce, and the moment it appeared, it descended to Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings. As it descended, a great pressure immediately pressed on their bodies, causing Lei Chen and Wu La\u2019s bodies to shiver slightly. Even Bei Ling looked as if he could not handle the pressure.\u201cBei Ling, Lei Chen, Wu La\u2026 The three of you can choose to stay here or to come back with me to the tribe. If you go back, it\u2019ll be dangerous.\u201d The elder looked at Bei Ling and the other two people.\u201cElder, I\u2019ll go!\u201d Bei Ling did not hesitate and took a step forward with an unwavering look appearing in his eyes.\u201cElder, I\u2019m not staying here!\u201d Lei Chen clenched his fists. A murderous look appeared on his face. He wanted to go back and protect his tribe.\u201cElder, I\u2019m not staying here, either.\u201d Wu La gritted her teeth and looked at the elder resolutely.The elder looked at the three of them and nodded his head before swinging his arm. A huge gust of wind suddenly appeared out of nowhere, lifting Bei Ling and the other two onto the dark python. Once they were on the python, the Head of the Guards and Shan Hen jumped on as well.There was only Su Ming and the elder left in the courtyard.The elder looked at Su Ming. The affection in his eyes was very strong, incredibly strong.Su Ming\u2019s heart pounded. He had a feeling that something bad was about to happen. Without waiting for the elder to speak, he immediately said, \u201cElder, I\u2019m going back too. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThe elder closed his eyes and opened them after a while, saying firmly,\u201dYou can\u2019t go back.\u201dSu Ming was stunned. His body trembled, and he lifted his head, looking at the elder.\u201cIt\u2019s useless even if you go back. There might be dangers lurking around while we\u2019re migrating here. Stay here and wait for us to come back!\u201d The moment the elder finished speaking, his body turned into a long arc and flew towards the python, leaving Su Ming alone in the courtyard with his body trembling furiously.\u201cElder!\u201d Su Ming lifted his head abruptly. There was great determination on his face, the kind of which he\u2019d never showed before. This was the first time he did not obey the elder\u2019s words!\u201cI want to go back to the tribe! Elder, I want to go back!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s voice was hoarse as he screamed as loud as he could towards the elder, who stood on the dark python in the sky.\u201cElder, Bei Ling can go back, Lei Chen can, Wu La can as well! And here am I, also a member of the tribe! I want to go back! I want to protect the tribe! I want to fight for the tribe! Elder!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes were red. His body was trembling as he roared, his body moving to ready itself for a jump.\u201cNo!\u201d The elder closed his eyes and pushed his right hand downward. A strong pressure bore down on Su Ming\u2019s body immediately, causing his body to freeze on the ground at the moment he was about to jump.\u201cWait here! Do not take even half a step out of this place!\u201d The elder sat down cross-legged on the dark python. The python lifted its head and roared at the sky before gradually rising into the air. Bei Ling and the others on the python fell silent, looking at Su Ming roaring on the ground with varying complicated looks on their faces.\u201cElder!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s voice turned hoarse, as if having changed. It echoed through the silent snowing night while tears ran like rivers from his eyes. His body fell with a thud, and he knelt down, kowtowing to the sky.\u201cElder, I want to go back! Please, let me go back! I have to go! I don\u2019t want to stay here! I won\u2019t stay here! Even if I die, I won\u2019t stay here!\u201d As Su Ming roared, the blood veins appeared all around his body, though no one could feel it. However, a strong might appeared from his body, spreading outward, fighting against the elder\u2019s restraint.Nonetheless, the restraint was too strong. Su Ming could not break through it with his own power. Due to that, fresh blood trickled out of his mouth. Yet he continued struggling, screaming once again.\u201cElder, even if you won\u2019t let me go, even if I die, I will definitely leave this place! That is my tribe! That is the tribe that brought me up! I want to go back! Even if I die, I want to go back! Even if I die, I want to die in the tribe! I was born as a member of Dark Mountain Tribe, and I will die as a member of Dark Mountain Tribe!\u201dThe Head of the Guards seemed like he wanted to say something as he stood on the python, but with just one look at the elder, he fell silent. Shan Hen, who stood by his side, chose to close his eyes and not look.\u201cSu Ming, you\u2019re useless even if you go back. Why are you wasting our time like this? Stop pretending already, you\u2019re really\u2026\u201d Bei Ling smiled coldly. There was an indifferent look in his eyes, and he looked at Su Ming on the ground, who was feigning the entire act in his eyes.Yet before he could even finish speaking, he was interrupted by a roar from Su Ming.\u201cBei Ling, shut up!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s face was vicious. He no longer cared about anything. This was the first time he had disobeyed the elder, and the first time he had talked back to Bei Ling. After all, Su Ming had always decided to keep his silence no matter what Bei Ling said due to the relationship they had when they were still children.Nevertheless, he had his limits. There were things that he absolutely refused to be subjected to, and Bei Ling had just crossed the line. The moment Su Ming roared, Bei Ling was about to speak, but when he saw the bloodshot eyes on Su Ming\u2019s face, his heart trembled, and he swallowed his words.The dark python rose into the air. The elder opened his eyes, and there was sadness within. He looked at Su Ming, refusing to let him go in order to protect him. He did not want Su Ming to get into any harm. After all, the migration this time\u2026 was definitely dangerous. It contained dangers that perhaps even he could not fend off.\u201cNo!\u201d The elder looked at the blood trickling down the corner of Su Ming\u2019s lips, and his heart clenched in pain. He swung his right hand once again. The snowstorm bellowed and moved towards Su Ming, who was still struggling to break through the pressure, instantly enveloping his entire body and pushing him into the house.Su Ming was swept into the house in an instant. When the door was shut with a bang, the snowstorm spread and surrounded the entire house, turning it into a giant prison. There was also a strange picture drawn with snow on the house\u2019s door. That picture was formed in the image of the statue of the God of Berserkers of Dark Mountain Tribe!The moment the seal and the imprisonment was formed, Su Ming\u2019s roars were also cut off.The snowstorm continued. The dark python rose into the sky and soon disappeared, dashing towards Dark Mountain Tribe at an incredible speed.\u2018Su Ming\u2026 this is the last thing I can do for you\u2026 From now on, you have to take good care of yourself\u2026\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMo Sang sat cross-legged on the dark python with a dismal face. Yet underneath his gloom, there was a fighting spirit burning within, a fighting spirit that screamed at him to fight till death stopped him!Bi Tu!As the dark python left, snow continued falling down from the sky and landed on the ground within the mudstone city, the buildings\u2019 roofs, and Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings.It was quiet. There was only the echoes of the wind moaning in the area, as if there was no other sound around\u2026 but within Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings, in the sealed house, there was a roaring voice that could rip through hearts. Yet it could not travel outward\u2026\u201cI want to go! I want to go back to the tribe! I want to protect the tribe members! Elder, even if I die, I want to go back!\u201d Inside the room, Su Ming\u2019s hair was a mess, his eyes were bloodshot, and he was overcome by complete madness. He used all his strength and speed and rammed into the door. Every single time he did so, the entire structure of the room would shake, but due to the seal, it did not budge even an inch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I want to go\u2026 I want to go\u2026\u201d Su Ming cried. Fueled by the strongest bout of madness he had ever had within the sixteen years of his life, he continued ramming into the door.Nonetheless, the seal remained unchanging. Su Ming continued until the skin on his knuckles was torn and bleeding, until his voice was so completely hoarse it would pull at the heartstrings of anyone who would hear him, until he coughed out a huge mouthful of fresh blood and his body trembled. He slid down and knelt down by the door.There were numerous bloody fist marks on the door\u2026\u201cI want to go back\u2026 I want to go back\u2026 Elder, I want to go back to the tribe. Even if I die, I want to die in the tribe. I\u2019m only becoming stronger and am developing myself to become a powerful Berserker so that I can protect and fight for the tribe\u2026 Elder, why? Why?\u201d Su Ming cried. His heart was in pain. That sort of pain made him feel as if he was about to die.When he thought of the danger looming over the tribe, of the elder\u2019s weakened state, and of all the familiar faces within the tribe, Su Ming let out a roar from the very depths of his soul!\u201cEven if I die, I still have to go back!\u201d There was utter desperation in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He panted harshly and took a few steps backwards.\u201cIf I can\u2019t break through the elder\u2019s seal now, then I\u2019ll have to do everything I can to raise my level!\u201d Su Ming was in a frenzy. Yet if anyone was in his position, they would do the same thing.His face was ghastly pale, eyes bloodshot, and his face filled with madness. There was only one thought in his head. He had to do everything without care of consequences and break out of this place!Even if he would be gravely injured because of this, he did not care. As of then, all he cared about was the elder and the tribe. Even if he died, he had to die while fighting for the tribe.\u201cI must become stronger. I have to break out of this place!\u201d Su Ming growled and took a few steps back before he turned around abruptly. He glared at the Cloud Gauze Grass he\u2019d bought earlier with the intention of using it for the quenching of herbs, and at the other herbs he\u2019d bought back as well.All these herbs were prepared for the quenching of herbs. Su Ming knew clearly that even if he crushed them into liquid and drank it, he could not take too much in one go. A Berserker who did that would cause grave harm to his own body. After all, steady and gradual growth was required in practicing in the Ways of the Berserker.Yet Su Ming did not care about that. If he could even throw away his own life, then there was no way he would care about such injuries. No matter how great the injuries were, he would never regret it!He would never regret it!Su Ming sat down cross-legged, his eyes remaining bloodshot. He took the bag containing the Cloud Gauze Grass. There was no time for him to crush the herbs. The tribe being in danger, the elder being weakened, and everything else made him sink into a state of desperation that was deeper than anything he\u2019d ever felt before.His eyes were bloodshot as he grabbed numerous Cloud Gauze Grass and placed them in his mouth, chewing furiously until the juice was squeezed out, then spitting out the residue. The juice was bitter, but compared to the bitterness Su Ming felt in his heart, it was nothing.He chewed and swallowed again, and once he was done, Su Ming took a large amount of Cloud Gauze Grass again and placed them in his mouth, swallowing their juices furiously. Gradually, his body began to tremble. It was as if there was a fire burning within his body, causing it to be drenched in sweat. All the blood veins that had manifested appeared on his body.The 160 blood veins let out a red glow, enveloping the entire house in the light, causing the place to look as if it had just turned into a blood red hell. There was a shocking look of determination and madness on Su Ming, who was surrounded by the blood red light.10, 30, 50\u2026 until Su Ming swallowed the juices from all the hundred leaves he had in the bag. Once he spat out the residue, a sharp pain arose in his body. The pain came from his stomach. He knew that this was the consequence of taking in too much Cloud Gauze Grass. If he continued doing so, then the pain would only become more severe, and the pain would eventually spread through his entire body.Yet at the same time, he felt the fire burning in his body become stronger, the blood veins also seemed to be showing signs of increasing. Once he had that feeling, Su Ming did not hesitate and took out another bag of Cloud Gauze Grass.Time passed by bit by bit, and soon, an hour passed by. During this hour, Su Ming swallowed the juice from 700 Cloud Gauze Grass. This would have been something incomprehensible and difficult to imagine for other people, but Su Ming had really done it.He continued shaking. Sharp pain spread through his entire body. There was also a dull pain in his chest. He had yet to digest all the juice in his body, but he still had a lot of herbs to spare. Still, he felt as if he could no longer swallow another drop. Su Ming also felt like he was about to vomit, but he growled and bore through it.The burning sensation in his body reached its peak as if about to erupt within him. Su Ming quickly raised his right hand and pounded against his chest.It was like the fire within his body was kindled with a roar. The moment the blames erupted, blood mist escaped from all the pores of Su Ming\u2019s body. There was a muffled sound from within the mist, and the blood veins on his body increased at that moment!161st, 162nd, 163rd\u2026 and it only stopped when the 167th blood vein manifested on his body.Su Ming\u2019s face was pale. He stood up and punched the door. His fist connected with a bang, and the door shuddered. Fresh blood trickled down the corner of Su Ming\u2019s lips. He staggered a few steps backward and roared towards the sky.\u201cNot enough! It\u2019s not enough!\u201d In his frenzy, Su Ming immediately took out another bag of Cloud Gauze Grass. He knew that his body could no longer take in anymore of these herbs, but he still continued to swallow them without hesitation.700, 800, 900\u2026 Green liquid flowed out from the corner of Su Ming\u2019s lips. The pain he felt in his body made all the veins pop out on his body. The pain and burning heat erupted once again as the number of blood veins also increased.Yet the new blood veins were no longer blood red. They were tainted with blood and looked dull. It was a sign that Su Ming\u2019s reckless actions had caused his body to be gravely wounded.Yet Su Ming did not care!The blood veins in his body were increasing at a maddening speed. 168, 169, 170\u2026 and it continued until the number reached 173. Su Ming rushed outward and slammed into the door. One punch, two punches, three punches\u2026 The door shook furiously, but it remained locked!\u201cOpen!\u201d Su Ming roared. This time, he did not use his fist, but used his head to ram against the door. There was a thunderous roar, and a crack appeared on the door, causing some of the snow on the picture of the statue of the God of Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe to fall as it trembled.A trickle of blood flowed down from Su Ming\u2019s forehead. A huge amount of red appeared in his eyes. He did not care about the pain. The moment he saw the crack appear on the door, he rammed against it again.Yet in the end, the door only opened by a small slit. He could not open it any further.Despair appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He laughed brokenly, grabbing onto all the remaining herb bags, then slamming his hands on them. There was a loud bang, and all the hide bags containing the Cloud Gauze Grass burst open. The Cloud Gauze Grass within were all gathered together by a force and turned into a ball the size of a head. When Su Ming slammed his hands on them once more, the banging sounds erupted again, and all the Cloud Gauze Grass were crushed. A large amount of juice flowed out and turned into sprinkles of green rain, which all went into Su Ming\u2019s mouth when he took in a large breath.The moment Su Ming took the liquid into his body, a roar reverberated through him. Similar to his madness, the blood veins on his body were increasing at a frenzied pace. 175, 177\u2026 and it stopped abruptly when the number reached 189.There was a sickly red glow around Su Ming\u2019s entire body. He took a step forward and rammed against the door. As the banging sound reverberated around him, the door opened a little more.More snow fell from the snow made statue of the God of Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe. A faint crack even appeared on the statue!Su Ming\u2019s hands were bloody. The entire door was now dyed with blood. At that moment, Su Ming looked pathetic. It was as if he had turned into another person. There were blood stains on his hair. His face, which had been clean and handsome, was now twisted into a vicious look filled with madness.\u201cI want to go back to the tribe! I want to fight for the tribe! I want to go back!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s voice had gone completely hoarse. The moment he saw that the door had opened up a little more, he banged his head against the door again!\u201cI want to go back!\u201dThere was a boom, and Su Ming coughed out a mouthful of blood. Yet he rammed into the door again without any hesitation. As he continued ramming into the door, the door opened up more and more. Cracks also appeared on the statue of the God of Berserkers outside.It seemed as if he was about to escape from the room.However, when the crack expanded to the breadth of half a finger, it stopped. Su Ming\u2019s current level of power could only do so much. It would have been fine if that was the case, but the moment it stopped, it started closing up once again!\u201cElder!\u201d Su Ming roared in agony. As he watched the door he worked so hard to open closing once again right before his eyes, Su Ming panicked and immediately took out a small bottle. Contained within, there were three drops of Berserker Blood from the Awakened Realm!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming lifted his head and without hesitation poured the contents of the bottle into his mouth, but only one drop fell. The other two drops seemed to have reached some sort of barrier and could not fall down. Su Ming knew that this was the elder\u2019s protection from him overusing it.The moment the Berserker Blood fell into his mouth, Su Ming immediately felt as if the blood in his veins started boiling. He opened his mouth and spat out the Berserker Blood. He raised his left hand and pointed at it, and the Berserker Blood immediately burst open, turning into a bundle of mist that entered through his ears, nose, eyes, and mouth as he breathed in.The moment the mist formed by the Berserker Blood entered Su Ming\u2019s body, his entire body turned red. A vast amount of energy erupted in his body.At that moment, the blood veins also increased at a tremendous speed on his body!190, 195, 201, 209\u2026 when the number reached 224, black blood trickled from Su Ming\u2019s eyes, ears, nose, and the corners of his lips. Yet his eyes were still burning with madness and persistence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were only 19 blood veins left until he reached the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm! This sort of increase in speed would have been frightening if it had happened to anyone else. This was different to the increase in power compared to the time Su Ming had climbed Wind Stream Mountain. After all, when he was in Wind Stream Mountain, he trained entering fine control by using his mind to move. It may have seemed like his power had increased by a large margin, but in truth, he still had trained with the usual principle of training steadily and gradually increasing the number of blood veins in his body.Yet it was different now! Su Ming was forcefully increasing the number of blood veins in his body. He was doing so by using a large amount of Cloud Graze Grass juice, and the moment he reached his limit consuming the Cloud Gauze Grass, he had also forcefully absorbed one drop of Awakened Berserker Blood.Anyone that had any shred of reasoning would definitely not use Su Ming\u2019s method to forcefully increase their strength. Only Su Ming would do so. After all, doing this sort of thing was fatal to the body! If that was not the case, then there would be plenty of people who would use this method to increase their power.Yet, was there any other way for Su Ming..? He could choose to bear with it and ignore the dangers his tribe faced, ignore the possibility of his tribe members dying, ignore the possibility of the elder not returning, and ignore the fact that his home was facing the threat of elimination.If he chose not to think about all these and only of his safety, he could stay and wait patiently. It might be torturous. He might feel uncertain and bitter, but he would definitely not face any threat to his own life.Perhaps this was the right thing to do. This was also the path the elder had chosen for him.After all, within most of people\u2019s eyes, Su Ming was only a weakling. Even if he went back, he would only die. He could do nothing.Yet Su Ming refused to let himself choose that path. Everything that he did to become stronger was all for the sake of the tribe. His personality might be slightly weak, but that weakness was hidden deep within him. Now that something like this had happened, that weakness had instantly disappeared and was replaced by resolution and determination!Since he was young, most of the members in the tribe were kind to him. His friends were there. There were familiar faces there. There were women in the tribe who took care of him when he was young. There was the elder and the kind members from his tribe who had taught him how to speak, and there was everything that had happened within the tribe during the past sixteen years of his life. He could not turn a blind eye to this.It was impossible for him to do nothing and continue living when he knew that the tribe was in danger. It was impossible for him to back down when he knew that the danger of death loomed over his tribe members\u2019 heads. It was even more impossible for him to wait here quietly when the threat of elimination hung over the tribe.He was a teenager, a teenager that was not even seventeen years of age. He was also afraid of death\u2026 But even though he may not understand the philosophies of life, he knew that the tribe was his home!Now that his home was in danger, he could not, he absolutely could not ignore it. Even if he died, he had to die protecting his home!This was Su Ming.His recklessness may have caused his madness, and perhaps many people could not understand the reason for his madness and questioned it, but all of this was ingrained in his bones. After all, he had treated Dark Mountain Tribe as his home since a long time ago.His home was in danger, his friends could die, he might never see his elder again. His family, which had treated him kindly since he was young, seemed to be crying. How could he not\u2026 fall into madness..?Su Ming lifted his head and roared. His entire body trembled as he continued absorbing the Berserker Blood into his Qi. The Berserker Blood spread madly throughout his body as he went into fine control, causing the blood veins on his body to show signs of increasing once again.Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and his face was twisted into a ferocious look. There was also madness within the frightening look on his face, causing him to look like an evil spirit. As a huge amount of blood veins manifested, a vast amount of force erupted from Su Ming\u2019s entire body. It made his roar become louder, and he once again rammed into the door after taking a few steps back. This time, he did not use his head, nor did he use his fists. He used his entire body, his shoulders, and rammed into the sealed door.There was a banging sound as Su Ming\u2019s body rammed into the door. The door trembled, and a few cracks appeared once again on the snow made statue of the God of Berserkers sealing the door outside.Yet the seal was created by Mo Sang. It was impossible that Su Ming could break through so easily. The elder\u2019s goal on creating the seal was clear\u2014he wanted to limit Su Ming\u2019s movements. He did not want Su Ming to step into danger and wanted him to stay inside!Nonetheless, the elder made a miscalculation. He did not expect that Su Ming would be so determined that he would do something so insane just to get out of the place. This was something even the elder did not expect.He only managed to guess that Su Ming would be dissatisfied with his decision, but with Su Ming\u2019s current level of power, he would not be able to get out of the room! In the elder\u2019s eyes, Su Ming would forever remain as a child.Tears fell from Su Ming\u2019s eyes. His tears mixed with his blood, making it seem as if he was crying tears of blood. However, he did not give up. He took a few steps back and ran into the door once again. The thunderous roars continued as Su Ming growled and rammed into the door with his entire body.The moment he crashed into the door, the number of blood veins on his body increased once again, 227\u2026 231\u2026 233!Boom!The entire house trembled as if about to collapse. It was like the house had turned into a cage, holding contained a strong wild beast. Yet at that moment, as the wild beast struggled, the cage seemed to become unable to bear the attacks. The number of cracks on the snow statue of the God of Berserkers situated at the door increased. A large amount of snow fell to the ground, as if it was about to explode into pieces at any moment, but it still remained!\u201cI want to protect the tribe\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s sight had become hazy. His mind was beginning to be muddled. Yet even with that foggy gaze and muddled state of his, there was still a shocking persistence within him. He muttered under his breath as blood trickled out of his mouth, and he rammed into the door once again.Roaring sounds reverberated around the house and Su Ming\u2019s blood veins increased once again due to the crash and his body rapidly absorbing that drop of Berserker Blood. It increased from 233 blood veins to 237 blood veins!\u201cI want to go back to the tribe\u2026\u201d Su Ming recklessly crashed into the door again. The roaring sounds echoed for a long time, and the crack widened by quite a large margin. The entire door was dyed red with blood now. All of it belonging to Su Ming. That blood was a representation of his persistence!\u201cI want to fight for the tribe!\u201d Su Ming roared and rammed into the door once again. He even used his head to bang against the door. The moment he did so, the number of blood veins increased explosively from 237 blood veins to 243, and at the same time, a vast amount of power that hinted at him breaking through to the next level erupted from Su Ming\u2019s body.The power came at the moment he broke through the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm and reached the seventh level. When the power appeared in Su Ming\u2019s body, he rammed into the door again, and the full force of the power travelled from his body to the door.A horrific roar resounded. The door trembled furiously, and a creaking sound appeared. The door opened halfway. A large part of the snow statue of the God of Berserkers outside shattered. Lots of snow fell, causing the statue to look broken and incomplete!Yet the imprisoning force remained. However, it seemed that the seal had reached its limit!Trickles of blood escaped from the corner of Su Ming\u2019s mouth. He staggered backward and lifted his head abruptly. The 243 blood veins let out a blood red light around his body that could light up the entire sky. The speed at which the light filled up the room made his body seem to be filled with a brutal and mighty presence. At that moment, he stepped right into the seventh level of the Blood Solidification from the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm!The seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm!He would need 399 blood veins if he wanted to enter the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm from the seventh level. Once he entered the eighth level, that would mean he had become a Berserker who\u2019d reached the peak of the middle stage of the Blood Solidification Realm! With one more step, he would move into the ninth level, and he could call himself a Warrior in the later stage of the Blood Solidification Realm!As far as Su Ming knew, within the entire tribe, even the Head of the Guards and Shan Hen were only at the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. The tribe leader\u2019s power was greater than those two\u2019s, and Su Ming believed that even if he was not in the ninth of the Blood Solidification Realm, he was close.This spoke of the strength of the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm, it also spoke of how small the number of Warriors in the seventh level was! It was not as if there was no one in Dark Mountain Tribe who was at the seventh level, but the few people who were at that level were all from the same generation as the tribe leader. Most of them were the vice chiefs of the hunters in the hunting teams.Among the younger generation, Su Ming was definitely the first who had reached the seventh level in Dark Mountain Tribe! Even if he did so without care for his own life and forcefully increased his power, causing his power to be incredibly unstable.Nonetheless, Su Ming did not care. He saw hope. He saw the door trembling and the broken state of the snow statue sealing the door outside. Once again, he rushed forward and rammed into the door.Yet even though the door was about to be blown open, and the snow statue seemed broken, no matter how hard and how many times Su Ming rammed against the door, he could not break it open. It was clear that the power of a seventh level Warrior of the Blood Solidification Realm was lacking only by a slight margin if he wanted to break through the elder\u2019s seal!Nonetheless, Su Ming was at his limit. Besides, the moon was hidden by the snowstorm outside. In this sort of weather, he could not use the power of moonlight and make his blood burn again!The snowstorm was showing signs of weakening and looked as if it was going to completely stop in a moment, so perhaps the moon would appear in the sky at that time. Yet if he continued waiting, the torture he would have to endure as he waited was something Su Ming could not bear.All his previous acts of madness were so that he could get out of the house as soon as possible and get to the tribe with his quickest speed. He did not want to imagine the possible disaster that could befall the tribe if he continued waiting\u2026When he saw that he could not push the door open completely, despair appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He staggered backward, a broken smile appearing on his face. Yet he did not give up. As he let out a sad and piercing roar, all 243 blood veins moved as he circulated his Qi continuously in his body.\u201cEnter fine control through the mind\u2026 Enter fine control through the mind!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s face was ferocious. The understanding he obtained in Wind Stream Tribe towards the method of fine control was used at that moment with an explosive force. The 243 blood veins on his body began to disappear one by one. 215, 186, 162\u2026 93, 75, 47\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen the blood veins on his body disappeared until there was only one left, Su Ming lifted his head and a terrifying resolution appeared in his eyes.\u201cElder\u2026 you can\u2019t stop me from going back to the tribe!\u201d Su Ming closed his eyes slowly. After a moment, at the instant he opened his eyes again, the last blood vein remaining on his body suddenly glowed with a bright red light and continued becoming brighter at an incredible speed!That was obviously not just one blood vein. As the red light grew stronger, it signaled that Su Ming was using the method of fine control to continuously stack more blood veins onto that one blood vein. In an instant, the red light on the blood vein reached its peak. It may have seemed like there was only one blood vein on his body, but at that moment, there were 243 blood veins stacked together!This was the true explosive force of fine control!\u201cI want to go back to the tribe. I was born in Dark Mountain Tribe, and even if I die, I will die as part of Dark Mountain Tribe!\u201d Su Ming clenched his fists. The 243 blood veins stacked together into one, twisted, and advanced towards Su Ming\u2019s right fist with the blood red glow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He would also experience days of glory and days where he would stumble and fall. These were all things that Su Ming did not understand. The only thing he understood was that he had to do this. The tribe was his home.The moment he swung his fist, banging sounds appeared from Su Ming\u2019s right hand. That was the sound signalling that his bones could not bear with the force and his flesh and bone had torn apart. The moment he swung his fist against the door, a thunderous roar shook through heaven and earth. It was as if it could change the weather and make the snowstorm stop.The door was crumbling quickly, turning into a countless number of shards. It was like a huge gust of wind had appeared and blown sideward, lifting them outwards like leaves.Thunderous roars echoed in Su Ming\u2019s surroundings. The moment the door completely crumbled, numerous cracks also appeared on the snow statue outside, but it did not crumble and break apart like the door.At that moment, there was no door before Su Ming, only wooden shards that filled the entire ground. Yet between him and the outside world was the snow statue filled with cracks. It continued floating in the air as it let out a gentle light, which turned into an invisible screen of light that never once crumbled.It was as if the door had borne the weight of the invisible light screen on it, which was the reason why it was so difficult to break open. Now that the door had shattered, the true seal was revealed!Yet the light was neither bright nor dim, a clear sign that it was still powerful.Su Ming was not surprised. He had guessed since a long time ago that the elder\u2019s seal would not be so easily broken. The moment the door shattered and the screen of light appeared before his eyes, he took a step forward. The one blood vein on his body was still giving off a piercing blood red light. As Su Ming moved, the blood red light instantly brightened like an explosion, and he swung his fist again.That fist seemed to have landed on thin air, but in truth, it landed on the invisible light screen. It trembled, but remained shining against the sky.Su Ming\u2019s eyes were red. He continued ramming his fist into the screen. After a while, when the light screen became so dim it seemed to have reached its limit, Su Ming took a few steps backward, and a trickle of blood ran down the corner of his lips. He stared at the screen, then abruptly raised his right hand and sliced down towards the space to his right!Execution of the Three Evils!This was one of the more powerful Berserker Arts in Dark Mountain Tribe. It was rumoured that it was passed down from the true Dark Mountain Tribe from hundreds of years ago!Practice was not the key in casting this Art. In truth, training this Art was incredibly simple. Su Ming had been visualizing the Art in his head since a long time ago. Yet, since he did not have 200 blood veins, he had been unable to cast it.The difficult part of the Art lay in the number of blood veins required. Only those who had 200 blood veins could use the first slash! Now that Su Ming had 243 veins and had arrived at the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm, for the first time, he cast the Execution of Three Evils, which had long resided in his head!Execution of Three Evils, an Art which could even kill Tai Sui\u00b9! The three evils were also known as the three murders!Between heaven and earth, there were three forces \u2013 Sever, Beginning, and Nurture. Sever was known as the evil of theft, Beginning was known as the evil of disaster, and Nurture was the evil of time! They were also known as the murders of theft, disaster, and time!A long time ago, Dark Mountain Tribe had obtained this Art from an unknown place. After probing into the Art, the entire tribe was shocked. The three evils had always existed in the world, but they had no form. No one could see them, neither could anyone touch them. Perhaps they existed, perhaps\u2026 they did not.Yet when the powerful Dark Mountain Tribe studied the Art, they began to discover patterns. At different hours of the day, the formless three evils would appear in different locations. That was how the incredible Dark Mountain Art that shocked the region appeared \u2013 Execution of Three Evils!The wise men in Dark Mountain Tribe believed that there was a pattern between heaven and earth. The three evils were just a part of an existing pattern. All forms of power existed within the pattern. Once the pattern was broken, then an unimaginable amount of force would erupt forth.Yet even Dark Mountain Tribe did not manage to discover the specific amount of force that would appear.The Art itself was also very enigmatic. Sometimes the force would be shocking, while other times it would release only a normal amount of force However, even if it was just a normal amount, it was still enough to kill someone!That was why the Execution of Three Evils passed down was rather rough around the edges. Anyone with enough blood veins could cast it, but there was almost no one who managed to discover the true form of the Art.This was a form of power that Dark Mountain Tribe did not understand. They could only use it, but not master it. There was even an Elder in Dark Mountain Tribe who once said that whosoever managed to truly control the three evils would be able to control the entire pattern of the world!Su Ming could only use the Art at that moment. As for why he decided to slice his right hand towards his right, it was because it was midnight then, and according to the principles behind Execution of Three Evils, the location of the three evils in the pattern of heaven and earth at that moment was to the north!North was to Su Ming\u2019s right! The moment he swung his right hand down in a slicing motion, the blood veins that had stacked together on his body let out a piercing blood-red light. The blood veins moved strangely according to the Art Su Ming had obtained under the blood-red light, twisting around his right arm nine times, then escaping his body through his arm.That was also why 200 veins were required to cast Execution of Three Evils. That was because the Art itself was strange. The caster\u2019s blood veins would leave his body for a moment. Without enough Qi, it was difficult to execute the Art properly.The moment his blood veins left his body, Su Ming had a strange feeling. It was as if the empty space to his right completely disappeared and turned into a desolate area. The moment he sliced to his right, his blood veins turned into a sharp blade and sliced into the empty space. He felt like he was slicing through mud.It was a strange experience. He did not understand why it had happened. He only knew how to cast the Art!The moment he cut into the space, the strange feeling disappeared. Everything returned to normal. Yet at that moment, the dim screen of light before Su Ming trembled furiously. If anyone looked closely at it, they could see clearly that the screen of light was not the only thing that trembled. Everything around Su Ming was shaking.Yet even so, even after the light screen trembled furiously, it still remained there. It was as if all the actions Su Ming took did not have much effect on it. After all, this was a seal created by the elder. The strength of the seal was not something that Su Ming could break through by just taking herbs and Berserker Blood!Su Ming\u2019s body trembled. This was the first time he had casted the Execution of the Three Evils. With his current level of power, he could only cast the first slash. The strange power made his heart tremble, but when he saw the screen of light, despair gradually appeared on his face. He had already executed all the plans he could think of, but that screen of light was like a ravine connecting heaven and earth. Everyone could see it, but no one could pass through it.Su Ming\u2019s face was pale. He staggered backward as if all the strength had been drained from his body.The moment Su Ming staggered backward, his face changed suddenly. He could clearly feel the ground beneath his feet moving.At that moment, outside Wind Stream Tribe, within the sealed Wind Stream Mountain located on the plains, the roar of a wild beast appeared from within the black mist. The roar was filled with fury. The moment it spread out, the place, which was completely sealed tight, suddenly trembled furiously. A gigantic crack abruptly appeared out of thin air with a loud crash and revealed the hidden Wind Stream Mountain that reached the skies.\u201cIn the end, I still managed to break through it from within!\u201dAs the beast roared, a ghastly voice travelled from within.The moment the mountain was revealed and the space between heaven and earth was torn apart because of the seal being stirred up, Wind Stream City, which was located not too far away, shook.There was a strange connection between the location of the mudstone city and the seal on Wind Stream Mountain. The moment the seal on the mountain was forcefully broken apart, the connection was activated, causing tremors to shake the mudstone city. The citizens\u2019 hearts trembled along with it.As the mudstone city trembled, Su Ming could feel the tremors becoming stronger where he stood. By the end, it was as if the entire earth was rolling like waves. He immediately noticed the elder\u2019s seal becoming dimmer for the first time!His spirits was lifted. He let out a low growl. As he growled, the shadow of the moon appeared gradually in his eyes. Due to the snowstorm outside, there was no moon in the sky, yet the shadow of the moon became even more distinct in Su Ming\u2019s eyes.The moment the shadow of the moon appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes, he quickly rushed forward towards the screen of light. He rammed his body into the screen continuously. As the ground trembled, the screen light became dimmer and dimmer.After a while, when the earth\u2019s trembles reached its peak and the entire mudstone city seemed to be on the verge of falling apart, half of the light screen shattered onto the ground. The light of the screen had become completely dark. By the looks of it, it was about to crumble at any moment. At that moment, an empty feeling spread through Su Ming\u2019s body, but very soon, a red flash appeared to his left. A string of red light appeared out of nowhere and crawled into his right hand. The one blood vein that was formed by stacking 243 veins returned once again to his body.Blood Scales, which had been hidden within his right arm, also appeared, turning into a gigantic blood red eagle that rushed towards the light screen with a screech.Terrifying roars thundered through the sky. The light screen trembled as the giant eagle charged against it and shattered completely, shattering into numerous broken fragments. The snow statue also seemed to completely collapse, turning into snow that scattered everywhere before the wind raised it up once more. It knocked into the snow falling from the sky and created strings of roaring sounds that echoed continuously.Su Ming broke through the seal!He trembled and coughed out a mouthful of blood. The blood fell on the ground, creating a terrifying sight. The blood red light from the 243 veins that were stacked together also became dimmer. It was as if they could no longer remain stable and scattered away before returning into Su Ming\u2019s body.Su Ming\u2019s face was weary, his entire body was covered in blood and his hair was a mess. Yet his eyes were flashing brilliantly. The flash within his eyes was his determination and resolution!\u2018I got out! I\u2019ll have to return to the tribe with the fastest speed possible!\u2019 Su Ming took a deep breath. He knew that the main reason why he managed to get out was due to the strange tremors. Yet he had no time to think about it. He moved forward so quickly that he looked like he had turned into a long arc speeding down the road.Su Ming\u2019s speed was his best feature. Before he was even a Berserker, he had been agile. Now that he was a Berserker at the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm, his speed had reached a shocking state.He rushed out of Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s lodgings, past the streets, and jumped over the walls of the mudstone city. At that moment, the anxiety in his heart was like a burning fire, causing him to only think about going faster!The continuous bursts of speed, his previous absorption of the drop of the Berserker, and the unbelievable amount of Cloud Gauze juice caused the disguising Art the elder had previously cast on him to crack slightly, making the force of his power to blast forth like a tidal wave breaking through ice. He could no longer hide his power completely.The snow falling from the sky had become lighter. It now fell down in bits and pieces. It was as if the heavy snowfall was nearing its end, in turn causing the moon in the sky to be on the verge of appearing completely.The land was colored silver. However, during that night, the silver glow was not beautiful. Instead, it let out a murderous air\u2026There was a faint line of white in the distance. A new day was about to arrive.Yet it was a wonder that the darkness before dawn could be broken.The entire mudstone city was in a ruckus. A lot of tribe members had come out of their houses with expressions of fear and bewilderment. They did not know what had happened. There were even houses that had collapsed, as if the end of the world had arrived.Su Ming did not care about that. He walked forward quickly, and just as he was about to leap over the mudstone walls, he sensed danger.A cold voice travelled towards him. \u201cYou cannot leave!\u201dThe moment Su Ming paused in his footsteps, a person walked out from the darkness behind him.He wore red, and his presence alone seemed to hold a fire that could scorch those around him. His face was aloof, and there was a prideful air around him that seemed to be coming from his soul. It was Ye Wang!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBy the orders of the Elder, no outsider is allowed to leave Wind Stream City tonight! You\u2019re strong, but your Qi is chaotic. This area is within my jurisdiction. You\u2026 cannot hope to win against me,\u201d Ye Wang looked at Su Ming calmly and spoke slowly.Su Ming turned around abruptly and stared at Ye Wang. His eyes were bloodshot, and within them, there was viciousness and madness.When Ye Wang saw his eyes, his heart trembled. Somehow, there was a sense of familiarity within those eyes\u2026Translator\u2019s Note :\u00b9 Tai Sui: Chinese term for stars directly opposite Jupiter.

Blood Scales appeared in his hands immediately! The spear was entirely red. It was as if it was dyed in a pool of fresh blood, and it let out a strong, aggressive presence. The same presence as when he had climbed Wind Stream Mountain blasted forth from Su Ming\u2019s body. He did not speak. He only looked at Ye Wang silently.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ye Wang\u2019s pupils shrank. He could feel an extremely familiar presence from Su Ming\u2019s body. He would never mistake that presence. In his eyes, the frail looking teenager seemed to slowly be turning into another person. That person who made his breathing quicken, who was the only person Ye Wang believed had the right to compete against him!\u201cYou\u2019re Mo Su!\u201d Ye Wang was not any other normal person. He almost immediately understood why the Elder had arranged him to patrol this region.\u201cDark Mountain Tribe is in danger. I have to go back. If you stop me, then you are my enemy!\u201d Su Ming cast a glance at Ye Wang, then turned around and sped forward. He had already made his decision. No one could stop him!When he saw Su Ming taking a leap and rushing into the distance, something flashed through Ye Wang\u2019s eyes. It was a brief hint of hesitation. A massive change had happened in the mudstone city. He was also anxious, but that anxiety and hesitation only appeared for a brief moment before disappearing. It was instead replaced by a strong desire for battle!If it was anyone else, Ye Wang would not have had any desire to battle against them. To him, no one among his generation had the right to become his opponent. Yet after the first stage of the test, there was now one person who had the right to become his opponent, and that person was Mo Su!He may have tied with Mo Su during the first stage, but Ye Wang knew that he had lost. He had returned unconscious, while Mo Su returned to the field conscious.Ye Wang wanted to compete against Mo Su in the second and third stage. He wanted to prove that he was the strongest among his generation. He might have guessed that Mo Su did not enter the other stages of the test because his level of cultivation was not that high, but Ye Wang was prideful. If he wanted to fight, then he would not use his level of cultivation to suppress the other person.\u201cMo Su!\u201d Ye Wang lifted his head abruptly. His voice was cold, and as he spoke, he took a step forward with his right foot, then his entire body shot forward like an arrow. With a whizzing sound, he dashed towards Su Ming.\u201cYou can\u2019t leave!\u201d Ye Wang\u2019s red shirt was like fire. As he jumped into the air, the snow illuminated his body and turned him into the most striking person in the area.Ye Wang might have arrived at the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm, but he limited his power until he was only at the seventh level of Blood Solidification Realm. He was prideful. To him, if he wanted to fight, then he would fight fair and square. If he wanted to win, then he wanted to make his opponent lose utterly and completely!Banging sounds erupted in Ye Wang\u2019s body. The moment he limited his power to the seventh level, his distance to Su Ming was not even 100 feet apart. His figure was like fire. He raised his right hand and grabbed towards Su Ming.The moment he grabbed in his direction, Ye Wang\u2019s entire body seemed to have erupted in flames. His skin turned red, even his hair seemed to have turned into blazing flames. Seas of fire emerged from his body and turned into a gigantic hand made of flames, which rushed to grab Su Ming.At that moment, the hand of fire was before Ye Wang\u2019s eyes, and Ye Wang was behind it. He dashed towards Su Ming following the motion of the hand of fire.Su Ming stopped suddenly, and the snow around him immediately turned into water, which turned into a cloud of steam rising into the air. That heat fell from the sky and enveloped Su Ming\u2019s entire body. At the very same instant, Su Ming stomped the ground with his right foot, and his entire body was lifted from the ground. He turned around and looked into the distance. The hand of fire was not even thirty feet away from him. By the looks of it, it seemed as if it was aiming to grab Su Ming\u2019s body and turn him to ashes.\u2018Fire?\u2019 Su Ming\u2019s body was suspended in midair. He saw through the hand of fire and found Ye Wang running behind it. The moment the hand of fire almost touched him, Su Ming bit his tongue and coughed out a mouthful of blood.That mouthful of blood was not Su Ming trying to force himself to do anything, but a requirement of the Berserker Art he was about to cast. The moment he obtained the mouthful of blood, all 243 blood veins on Su Ming\u2019s body manifested and twisted into a strange picture. At the same moment, the mouthful of blood exploded and turned into a mist of blood!That was the essence of Dark Blood Dust. The Art would turn fresh blood into a cloud of mist which would burst forth with a strength equivalent to the caster\u2019s Qi at its peak. The blood mist rushed towards the hand of fire, and there was also a fire burning within the mist!It did not look like a mist of blood, but instead looked like a mist of burning fire!He was fighting fire with fire!The moment Su Ming completed the third burning of blood, a huge change happened within his body. The most obvious change was the feeling of fire burning hotly within his blood.At that moment, the burning fire mist and the hand of fire were approaching each other. Within the span of a few breaths, they collided and a shocking thunderous roar erupted forth. The hand immediately crumbled, as if it was swallowed by the mist of fire. Then it turned backwards and rushed towards Ye Wang.It looked like the sky was burning, and it was about to engulf everything in flames!Su Ming remained silent. His eyes were bloodshot. He rushed into the mist of fire and raised his right hand. Blood Scales let off a piercing red light, and he threw the spear forward.A piercing sound sliced through the air. The blood red spear turned into a red bolt of lightning and pierced through the mist of fire, then turned into a giant red eagle that rushed towards Ye Wang together with the mist of fire.Ye Wang\u2019s heart trembled furiously as his pupils shrank. He did not expect Mo Su to be so strong. If he continued limiting his own power, then he could not hope to win the fight!He did not hesitate and immediately retreated, removing the limit of his power. 435 blood veins immediately manifested and his true strength erupted forth.At the same time, he raised his right hand and swung his fist forward. A bright light appeared on his right fist, and a black glove made of beast skin appeared. There was a ghastly presence coming from the glove. It was clear that the glove was a Berserker Vessel!He thrust his fist forward, and a thunderous roar echoed in the surroundings. A black wind appeared out of midair before Ye Wang, and as he thrust his fist forward, the black wind turned into a black whirlwind that could turn the world upside down. It collided with Su Ming\u2019s long spear and fire mist, and as sounds of explosions echoed in their surroundings, Su Ming took seven to eight steps backward. Yet at the same time, Ye Wang\u2019s body also jolted, and he took four to five steps backward. His body felt heavy.Ye Wang did not stop. He leapt forward and closed his distance to Su Ming in an instant. Su Ming also rushed forward at his fastest speed. He crossed fists with Ye Wang, and due to his speed, it looked as if his body left behind afterimages.From the distance, it seemed as if there were multiple Su Mings surrounding Ye Wang. The booming noises continued echoing around them. After a while, a sound that could pierce through the sky resounded, and Ye Wang stumbled ten feet backward as blood trickled down his mouth. When he lifted his head, he saw Su Ming coughing out a mouthful of blood as he too, stumbled dozens of feet backwards.\u2018What shocking speed\u2026 His level may not be as high as mine, but with this speed, if I can injure him once, then he can injure me dozens of times\u2026 This person is indeed the only one worthy of challenging me among our generation!\u2019 Ye Wang was shocked, but at that moment, his battle spirit was only kindled even more. He raised his left hand and pointed towards the sky.\u201cMo Su! I\u2019m going to use my full power next!\u201dThe moment Ye Wang finished speaking, an unexpected change happened!A roar filled with absolute anger suddenly came forth from the tall altar housing the Elder of Wind Stream City!\u201cThief! How dare you harm our holy mountain?\u201d That voice belonged to Jing Nan. His body instantly turned into air, and he rushed towards Wind Stream Mountain. At the same time, another incredibly powerful presence blasted towards the sky from within the mudstone city. That person also rushed towards Wind Stream Mountain along with Jing Nan. That second presence belonging to a Berserker in the Awakening Realm belonged to a woman, an extremely beautiful middle-aged woman!Ye Wang was stunned. His heart trembled. A glimmer flashed through Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He did not hesitate and retreated quickly towards the distance. His battle against Ye Wang had made him incredibly anxious. He did not want to fight. He wanted to get back to his tribe as soon as possible!With that chance, Su Ming widened the distance between them by hundreds of feet at an exceedingly fast speed.Ye Wang\u2019s expression changed. He no longer paid any attention to Su Ming, who was already far away, but turned and ran towards the city. He did not know what had happened, but he had a feeling that it was something terrible.At that moment, on the vast plains outside Wind Stream Tribe, a shocking change happened to Wind Stream Mountain, the mountain which had remained sealed and hidden away for generations by Wind Stream Tribe!Shi Hai and the other eight people all looked shocked and amazed as they stared dumbly at the spot before them and stood in the field at the foot of the mountain. Their eyes were filled with disbelief.Right in front of their eyes, the space before them was twisting rapidly, as if there was a big hand fiddling at the space from within. A huge crack that looked to connect heaven and earth appeared in midair.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThrough the crack, the Wind Stream Mountain was completely revealed. The black mist rose into the sky. As it forward, the roars from a wild beast reverberated through the air.At the same time the wild beast roared, a gruesome laughter was heard.\u201cAs expected of the Great Bird, the mythical beast of the Fire Berserker Tribe! This may just be a fragment of its soul, but it still contains so much power! At least the years of effort I wasted searching for the ruins of Fire Berserker weren\u2019t wasted!\u201dThe voice was completely unfamiliar to Shi Hai and the others. The moment they heard his words, their expressions changed. They cast an eye at each other and dashed towards the Wind Stream Mountain within the crack without hesitation. They were members of Wind Stream Tribe. There was no way they could back down when an outsider trespassed on their holy mountain!Yet the moment the nine people moved forward and were just about to enter the crack, they heard a cold snort from within the mist on the mountain. Almost immediately, a purplish red arm hundreds of feet long shot out from the mist and swung lightly at Shi Hai and the other eight people from a distance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ripples immediately appeared in the space between the arm and the people in the field. Shi Hai and the others jolted, as if a huge force fell on their bodies. One by one, the Qi within their bodies erupted and broke. Their faces turned pale and they fell to the ground, coughing out a mouthful of blood. They may not have died, but they felt as if their entire bodies had just erupted, and they could not stand.\u201cStill alive? Looks like I can\u2019t look down on a tribe born from the weaker branch of the Great Tribe of Man Miao. After all, there is still some blood of the Great Tribe of Man Miao left within you\u2026\u201d As the gruesome voice echoed in the air, some unknown method was used within the mist, causing the mythical beast\u2019s roars to be tainted with a hint of pain.\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to obtain a sealed Great Bird\u2026 This seal has already limited half of your power to begin with, let\u2019s see how you\u2019ll resist now!\u201d There was a hint of joy within the gloomy voice.Yet at that moment, a low roar travelled from the distance.\u201cThief! How dare you harm our holy mountain!\u201d As the sound travelled through, Wind Stream Tribe\u2019s Elder, Jing Nan, came in, roaring in anger. Behind him was the beautiful but icy cold woman clad in purple. The woman may have already been middle-aged, but her beauty was not tarnished. At that moment, there was a baleful look in her eyes, and within it was a look of similar anger and killing intent towards the intruder.When they arrived, they rushed into the crack and entered the black mist surrounding Wind Stream Mountain without hesitation. Very soon, thunderous roars that shook through the skies and earth travelled out from within the black mist. At one point, Jing Nan also let out a low growl.Su Ming did not know about everything that was happening within Wind Stream Tribe. Even if he did, he would not have paid attention to it. To him, the most important thing at that moment was to return to his tribe at the fastest speed he could muster.He wanted to see whether his tribe was still around\u2026He wanted to see whether his tribe members were still safe\u2026Once the bout of nervousness, anxiety, and madness was over, he became quiet. He ran across the snowy land in silence. A long time had passed since the elder left the place. The sky was still in a state between darkness and dawn. Su Ming knew that with the dark python\u2019s speed, the elder and the others might have already returned to the tribe a long time ago.\u201cPlease be safe\u2026\u201d Su Ming\u2019s feet continued bounding on the ground as he ran at the fastest speed in his life.The speed at which he ran was so quick that the moment anyone saw him approaching, within the blink of an eye, he would have already disappeared into the distance. He did not care about consequences as he ran. He even forgot about his own fatigue, and to make himself run faster, he continued making all 243 blood veins that surrounded his body burst forth in power to give him more strength, which allowed him to go even faster.The moment the sky turned completely bright and the sun began rising as light shone on the land and a silver light was reflected off the surface of the snow covering the ground, Su Ming had already ran out of the region belonging to Wind Stream Tribe and rushed into a dried up forest. He was near the trading square he went to some time ago.He would have needed half a day to reach this place with the speed he had in the past, yet now, as he ran silently, he used less than four hours to cover this distance.To others, that speed would be so incredibly fast, it would leave them in awe, but Su Ming still felt that it was too slow!He no longer roared, but instead ran through the forest silently as veins popped out on his legs. He would suddenly take a leap forward and use the momentum to continue dashing forward. As he continued running nonstop, Su Ming was drenched in sweat. Not only were his legs hurting, every part of his body was beginning to feel pain.Time passed by slowly. When noon was around the corner, snow stopped falling from the sky. There were no clouds, and the sky was clear. Yet there was a person running silently within the forest. Even his sweat could not travel down his skin and was flung back due to his speed.The only thing supporting Su Ming now was determination and persistence. He was worried about the safety of his tribe and its members. He could not describe his current feelings. It was as if his body was drained and he was only running due to his persistence.The distance which Su Ming would have needed an entire night to cover by running without stopping in the past was now breached by the time it was noon with Su Ming\u2019s current mad dash. Gradually, Su Ming\u2019s eyes were filled with agitation and anxiety.He was getting close to the tribe. The sounds of his heartbeat echoed through his entire body, causing his anxiety and anticipation to become much stronger. He was afraid that he would see his tribe in ruins, and he would see his tribe members\u2019 corpses lying on the ground.He was afraid, but his speed did not decrease. A swift and fierce strength grew in his body instead.When the outline of Dark Mountain Tribe appeared in his eyes from a distance, Su Ming trembled, and tears fell from his eyes.From a distance, he saw that the gate to the tribe had collapsed. Many parts of the great wooden fence surrounding the tribe were also broken. There were even wisps of black smoke rising from within the tribe, a clear sign that there had been a fire.The tribe was not silent. A large number of tribe members seemed to have gathered together.When he saw that his tribe members were safe, Su Ming\u2019s anxiety was slightly placated. Yet following that was a killing intent directed towards his enemies who dared to destroy Dark Mountain Tribe.Su Ming dashed towards the tribe. Before he even got closer, he was seen by the Warriors who were part of the tribe\u2019s hunting party. They immediately became cautious, but when they saw Su Ming\u2019s face, they relaxed and could not find it within themselves to hide the fatigue on their faces.Su Ming cried as he returned to the tribe. He walked past the gate that had been blown to pieces. He walked into the tribe and saw the fatigue on the hunters\u2019 faces. He saw dozens of corpses gathered on the ground in the center of the tribe.Those corpses were all people Su Ming was familiar with. Those were his tribe members. The people weeping by their bodies were their families. As their cries echoed in the tribe, it stabbed Su Ming\u2019s heart, and the pain he felt made him think that he was about to bleed.He saw sadness on the faces of the normal members of the tribe. They were packing their belongings in fear and uncertainty before running towards where they were supposed to gather.On the young La Sus\u2019 youthful faces, he saw tears, dread, and fear as they held tightly to their mothers\u2019 hands. It was as if they were afraid that the moment they let go, they would never be able to hold their hands again\u2026Many of the houses within the tribe had collapsed. The ground was a mess. There were terrifying bloodstains covering parts of the ground, a clear sign that a battle had just occurred here some time ago.As Su Ming continued looking at the sights before him, he clenched his fists. Hatred appeared in his eyes. That was a look of hate and killing intent that was rarely seen on a teenager that was not even seventeen years of age!Su Ming\u2019s tears continued falling. He saw the kind lady who lived next door sitting dumbly outside her ruined house. There was no one by her side\u2026 Her child had died, her husband too, had died\u2026 She was the only one left and sat there alone at a loss.When Su Ming looked over, he could clearly feel her sadness and grief that no words could describe.\u2018Black Mountain Tribe!\u2019Su Ming clenched his teeth. He saw Lei Chen, who looked tired as he helped to gather the crowd to a spot and bring the things important to the tribe.Lei Chen did not notice Su Ming. He was already far too exhausted.Su Ming also saw Wu La, the girl who had always looked down on him but had a crush on Mo Su. She seemed to have grown up overnight. There was a huge bow slung across her back. She was comforting the crowd in whispers and helping them gather together within the shortest amount of time possible.Chen Xin too, was standing in the crowd. The frail look on her face made her look delicate and pitiful, but the resolute look in her eyes showed that she too, had grown up.Su Ming did not see the tribe leader, the Head of the Guards, Shan Hen, and Bei Ling. Neither did he see the powerful Warriors within his tribe, who had reached the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm. They were all absent.However, Su Ming saw the elder.The elder was standing in the distance. His face was pale, and his face had aged by far too much. It was as if a few decades had passed within that single night. At that moment, the elder had his head lowered as he healed a tribe member whose left thigh was bloodied and torn. That tribe member was a Warrior of Calamity, and he was about twenty-seven to twenty-eight years old. Su Ming knew him. That was Liu Di, who often played songs with the xun\u00b9.That person did not like getting close to other people within the tribe. There was an item made of bone the size of a fist hanging by his waist. There were a few small holes on it, and it looked really strange.Su Ming knew that item. It was called a xun. It was an instrument that most members in the tribe did not know how to play. Only this person had that talent, and they would sometimes hear the sounds of the xun in the tribe.Now, no hint of pain could be seen on his face. Only persistence and resolution could be found.Tears continued falling from Su Ming\u2019s eyes as he walked towards the elder step by step. Everything that he saw once he returned to the tribe turned his anger into killing intent. He wanted to fight for the tribe!As Su Ming approached the elder and the young man, he heard the tribe member whom the elder was healing say with a hoarse voice, \u201cElder\u2026 Forget about me. My legs are already ruined, but I can still fight\u2026 I\u2026\u201dThe elder\u2019s face was dark and filled with sorrow. He nodded his head gently. Then, as if noticing something, he lifted his head and saw Su Ming walking towards him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe moment he saw Su Ming, the elder was stunned. There was an unmistakable look of disbelief and shock on his face. He knew about the seal he had casted, and knew that there was no way a normal person could break through it so quickly. Yet Su Ming was right before his eyes. It threw him into a state of disbelief, like he had seen an illusion.It was the first time the elder had showed that expression before Su Ming. He could not believe that Su Ming managed to break through the seal and arrive at the tribe in such a short amount of time.At that moment, the elder was not the only person who saw Su Ming. Lei Chen also saw him. He widened his eyes and a look of astonishment appeared on his face. At the same time, Wu La, who was not far away, also by chance saw Su Ming.Translator\u2019s Note :\u00b9 Xun: a Chinese woodwind instrument, round shape, most definitely not an ocarina.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That arrow let out a shocking, sharp presence. No one could stop him until he tasted blood!\u201cElder\u2026 I\u2019m back,\u201d Su Ming whispered softly, just like he always did when he came back from the outskirts.The elder looked at Su Ming, and in his eyes, there was happiness, reluctance, hesitation, and a complicated look that Su Ming could not identify.\u201cYou want to fight for the tribe?\u201d the elder asked quietly after a long while.Su Ming nodded his head.\u201cEven if you may face death, are you still willing to?\u201d the elder asked again after a moment of silence.\u201cEveryone has to die eventually, and if I die protecting my own home, I will die without regrets!\u201d Su Ming voiced his thoughts in a calm voice.\u201cGood. Su Ming, I won\u2019t stop you. Since this is your decision, then I will give you a chance to fight for the tribe!\u201d The elder closed his eyes as if he was hesitating. After a moment, he opened them abruptly, and there was a resolute look in his eyes.He knew within his heart that he could not stop Su Ming anymore. If he did, then who knew what sort of insane act this child would pull once again? When he saw the grave injuries on Su Ming\u2019s body, the elder\u2019s heart clenched painfully, but he also felt gratified.At that moment, the tribe members gathered in the square suddenly fell silent. Their gazes fell upon the people walking into the tribe.The tribe leader was walking in front, and behind him were the Head of the Guards and Shan Hen. Bei Ling and the other powerful Berserkers in the sixth or seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm walked back with tired looks, fresh blood staining their bodies.When they left, their numbers had been greater, yet now, their numbers were reduced. Many of them also received injuries on their bodies. Bei Ling\u2019s face was especially pale, and there was a huge amount of blood flowing out from his chest.Everyone held decapitated heads that were no longer bleeding in their hands. Their return sparked the tribe members\u2019 spirits, and they cheered. They quickly spread out, allowing these people to walk straight towards the elder.Bei Ling saw Su Ming, but his usual aloof and indifferent look was gone. He remained silent instead and followed behind his father. His jealousy was nothing compared to the survival of his tribe.If the tribe was gone, if his tribe members were dead, then what was there to be jealous about..?The group of people walked towards the elder, and the tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe spoke as he threw the two heads in his hands aside, \u201cElder, the scouts from Black Mountain Tribe have all been chased down and murdered. It\u2026 should be safe outside now. We can start migrating!\u201d His words reeked of blood.The other people behind him also threw the heads in their hands aside. Murderous intent emanated from their bodies in the silence.Su Ming stood beside the elder and looked at the tribe leader and the others without a sound. He saw the fatigue on their bodies, the sorrow hidden underneath their killing intent, and their thirst for blood.It was not hard for him to imagine the tribe being ambushed for the first time by Black Mountain Tribe when they were getting ready to move. The battle must have been very difficult and grievous, causing the tribe to be unable to move. When the first battle ended, under the orders of the elder, these people were sent to kill all the scouts from Black Mountain Tribe. Only then could they safely migrate.After all, most of the members of the tribe were normal people, and there were quite a number of women and children as well. They had to protect them, because they were the hope and future of the tribe.The elder nodded his head and swept his gaze across all the members of the tribe. At that moment, no matter were they men or women, young or old, they were looking at him. Within their eyes were reliance and hope.\u201cFellow members\u2026\u201d the elder said softly. His voice carried through the area and fell into the ears of the members of the tribe.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave our homes\u2026 We don\u2019t want to leave this land, where we and our ancestors have lived for generations. We don\u2019t want to become dependent on Wind Stream Tribe\u2026 But for Dark Mountain Tribe to survive, we\u2026 must do so!\u201cWe have to live, and we will live!\u201cWe will tell our descendants, and we must tell ourselves that someday, we can still return to this place. We can still create our own home. On that day\u2026 we will return the humiliation we felt this day several fold back unto Black Mountain Tribe!\u201cI have the confidence, do you have it?\u201d the elder shouted out loudly.At that moment, all the tribe members let out long supressed roars amidst their sadness. Their howls shook the heavens. Perhaps the numbers in Dark Mountain Tribe were not big, but that roar was the strongest cry they had ever let out from within the depths of their soul.\u201cSomeday\u2026 Dark Mountain Tribe will return\u2026 but now, we will migrate!\u201d The elder closed his eyes. He did not want anyone seeing the sadness within his eyes. He swung his arm, and immediately all the tribe members in Dark Mountain Tribe who had gathered together supported each other and slowly moved under the protection of the Berserkers within the tribe. They left behind the land on which they had stayed for generations and migrated towards the unknown land located in the distance.The long line of people slowly left the tribe behind their backs. There was still wisps of smoke coming out from Dark Mountain Tribe. The ruins of their tribe exuded an air of desolation and sadness.Weeping sounds came from among the crowd. They belonged to the La Sus who had yet to grow up, women who were frightened, and all the members of Dark Mountain Tribe.The men in the tribe protected their families and held onto their bewildered children. As they wept, they silently walked forward. Some of the older La Sus held onto their parents\u2019 hands in fear and looked backwards, crying.They looked at the once familiar sight behind them, as if they wanted to carve that sight deep into the depths of their memories and turn it into an eternal memory. They were afraid they would forget, that they would forget the road back to their homes.Every single one of them could not help but turn back and look at the tribe they were leaving behind and at their home of the past\u2026There was a wizened old man in the crowd. He was Nan Song. His face was calm, as if he had seen through everything that life could throw in his face. At that moment, he only had a simple bag slung across his back. He walked silently and unassumingly in the crowd.It was noon. The sun was not strong. The snow on the ground gave off a silver light that pierced their eyes, but no matter how strong that light was, it still could not stop them from looking back frequently and from experiencing the sadness as they left.Their home was getting farther and farther away. The outline of the tribe gradually became fainter. The tribesmen could now only see the faint wisps of black smoke rising into the air and the broken state of the tribe. Yet the times when the tribe was still beautiful were carved into their hearts. They\u2026 would not forget. They could not find it within themselves to forget.Su Ming turned around. Every single detail about the tribe was also ingrained into his memories. The tribe contained his childhood, all the happy moments in his life, and his growth. He was familiar with every part of the tribe. He could not forget every single plot of land within the tribe. Everything within the tribe\u2026 would remain forever in his head.Unless they absolutely needed to, no one would want to leave their homes. No one would be willing to leave behind their familiar homes and travel to the unfamiliar Wind Stream to be subjected to the fate of becoming an affiliated tribe.Yet, this was the only way. It was the only way for Dark Mountain Tribe to not perish and continue their line. The path to Wind Stream was long, very long. The road was uneven, but they\u2026 had to continue walking down that path.The danger was not resolved. It was just the opposite. The true danger had just begun. They had the tribe protecting them previously, hence Dark Mountain Tribe was able to defend against Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s first wave of attack. Yet during the process of migration, the crowd was forced to travel in a long line. Most of the people were normal tribe members. They had no way of defending themselves against Berserkers.This process of migration was bound to not be peaceful\u2026Once Dark Mountain Tribe was defeated, what awaited them would be the death of all their Berserkers. The men would all be massacred, including the male infants and the La Sus. As long as they were men, they would all die\u2026 The only ones who would survive were the women from Dark Mountain Tribe. They would be brought back to Black Mountain Tribe and become akin to objects. Their only use would be to give birth to Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s offspring and strengthen Black Mountain Tribe. They would have to live the rest of their days in humiliation.It was impossible to be fast when hundreds of people needed to migrate in one go. It was especially so since there was a large number of La Sus and women in the crowd. Amidst the cold brought by winter, the sounds of their weeping gradually lessened, and silence replaced all sounds.They did not know where their future would lie. Perhaps Wind Stream was the only place they could go\u2026 Yet no one knew whether they would be able to make it alive to Wind Stream Tribe\u2026They did not know how many of them would die, and how many of them would never be able to see their families again after this journey\u2026There were quite a number of youngsters within the crowd that did not possess a Berserker Body. In the past, they rarely contributed to the tribe, and they spent most of their time playing and fooling around. Yet because they were the family members of Berserkers who died in battle, no one would be bothered by their actions as long as they did not step out of bounds.Now, these dozens of youngsters looked around fearfully in the crowd, hoping and wishing desperately that they could reach Wind Stream in an instant.Surrounding the long trail of people were the Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe. They quietly protected their tribe members with persistence even though they were tired. Sometimes they would go up and help the weak elderly folk. Walking right in front of the people was the tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe. His face was firm as he treaded cautiously forward. There were a few Berserkers behind him, and they all remained alert of their surroundings.It was the same by the flanks and the back of the crowd. The elder walked at the back. In his hands, he held the white bone cane and walked forward solemn and vigilant. Bei Ling held Chen Xin\u2019s hand as they moved silently on the right flank. His face was pale and the blood staining his chest had increased, but he did not mind.Lei Chen, Wu La, and the other Berserker in the tribe were all surrounding their tribe members as they kept watch.The responsibilities for the Head of the Guards and Shan Hen were great as they guarded both sides of the flank and silently followed along. The Head of the Guards held a bow in his right hand. If there was any hint of movement, then he would draw his bow and shoot that very moment! Behind him, there was an old man who would occasionally look at the Head of the Guards calmly.Su Ming recognised that old man. He was Nan Song, the old man who guarded the herb storage!Shan Hen was indifferent, as usual. No one knew what he was thinking about. Sometimes, a complicated look would appear briefly in his narrowed eyes, but no one noticed it.Su Ming followed the crowd and listened to their cries, which slowly turned into silence. His heart clenched in pain. When he saw the looks of fear on those familiar faces, Su Ming fisted his hands.\u201cProtect the tribe. Fight for the tribe!\u201d Su Ming muttered. He was protecting the right flank. Shan Hen was walking not too far ahead of him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe did not choose that place. The elder assigned him to that position when they were moving. In Su Ming\u2019s arms was a girl about five to six years of age. That girl\u2019s name was Tong Tong. She was asleep, but there were tears staining her eyelashes.Her father had died in battle, and her mother died the previous night. She was the only one left in her family.\u201cMama\u2026 Papa\u2026 Pipi\u2026\u201d As the girl slept, she trembled as if she was haunted by nightmares. As tears slid down her face, she clutched Su Ming\u2019s shirt.Su Ming knew that Pipi was the girl\u2019s pet. It was very cute, and she would always carry it around in her arms.\u201cTong Tong, be good\u2026\u201d Su Ming patted her back lightly as sadness appeared in his eyes.

The snow swayed in the wind, as if having no roots and not knowing where it should go, just like the crowd walking through it. The Dark Mountain tribesmen slowly left the tribe that had served as their home for generations and moved forward quietly through the forest.Gradually, no one spoke anymore. Even the crying sounds of the children stopped soon. They were either placated by their parents, or chose to grit their teeth and turn their sorrows into determination and hate.Most of the hundreds of people within the tribe were normal people. There were also the old and the weak among them, hence they could not speed up their journey. The cold wind that blew past seemed to freeze their bones, and the thick snow underneath their feet further decreased their speed.The Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe remained alert in the midst of their sorrow, keeping watch over their tribe members. They did not dare to let down their guard because a fight to the death might occur at any moment. Once they died, then there would be no one who could protect their tribe members, leaving them completely defenceless to attacks.The girl in Su Ming\u2019s arms held tightly onto his shirt. The wind during winter might be cold, but what was colder were her dreams\u2026 Yet, perhaps Su Ming\u2019s warm embrace was enough, and the child gradually calmed down as if finding peace within her dreams. Nonetheless, tears continued escaping from the corners of her eyes.Su Ming hugged the child gently and moved forward, walking on the snow on the ground. His gaze travelled to his surroundings frequently, and when his gaze landed on the familiar faces belonging to his tribe members, he saw sadness and unwillingness, but at the same time, he also saw resolution and resolve.Su Ming gritted his teeth and hatred appeared in his eyes. He walked forward quietly and would sometimes support the weak elderly to help their shivering bodies travel faster in the snow.\u2018If we don\u2019t stop and walk continuously day and night, at this speed, we\u2019ll need at least three days before we reach Wind Stream Tribe. Three days\u2026\u2019 I wonder how many of us will survive by the end\u2026 Su Ming\u2019s heart was bleeding. He was afraid, not for his own safety, but of how many familiar faces he would no longer be able to see three days later.Su Ming knew that if there were any other faster method to transfer their tribe members to Wind Stream Tribe, the elder would have used them. Yet although the dark python\u2019s speed was quick, it could not carry a large number of people in one go. Besides, the normal members of the tribe could not withstand the pressure of travelling in the sky. They would need several powerful Berserkers at the level of the Head of the Guards to protect them if they did so.Yet once these powerful Berserkers left, it would be practically impossible for the remaining people to survive.\u201cMama\u2026\u201d As Su Ming remained silent, the girl in his arms mumbled in her dreams and wrapped her arms tightly around Su Ming\u2019s neck, as if the moment she let go, she would lose her peace.\u2018Indeed, I was right to come back!\u2019 Su Ming patted the child\u2019s back lightly.Time passed by slowly. When it was almost dusk, the migrating crowd from Dark Mountain Tribe had travelled a large distance away from their homes. They gritted their teeth and moved forward through the forest and the cold. Suddenly, from the back, a piercing whistle that shook the sky sounded!The moment the piercing whistle rang out, howls of excitement immediately followed after. At the same moment, the silhouettes of people dashed towards them from behind.Almost all the people in Dark Mountain Tribe were shocked. A cold glint appeared in the elder\u2019s eyes. The Berserkers beside him, the Head of the Guards, and all the other Berserkers looked murderous.Their tribe members trembled in fear as they were surrounded by the threat of death. They were afraid, and they cried, unable to help themselves. Things started to get a little chaotic.\u201cThose in the front and middle, remain in your positions. Continue protecting the tribe and move forward. All those protecting the rear, kill the enemies!\u201d the elder immediately gave a command.Su Ming gave the girl in his arms to a normal member of the tribe and was just about to move to the back when he heard the elder\u2019s words. He froze, then gritted his teeth and remained in his place, protecting his tribe as they left under the guidance of the tribe leader. Behind them, the elder and seven other Berserkers from his tribe stood like a wall that shielded them from their enemies!Whistling sounds echoed in the air, and twenty something Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe appeared from the forest behind them. When Su Ming saw so many Berserkers appearing at once, his heart jolted.They only had thirty something Berserkers in Dark Mountain Tribe. Yet Black Mountain Tribe managed to send out twenty something Berserkers in one attack alone. It was a fact that was difficult for him to believe.Among these Berserkers, most of them were around the fourth or fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. However, there were five people who had reached the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm, and another three who had reached the seventh level.There was no one in the eighth level in their team, but leading the charge were two men wearing black robes. These two men\u2019s clothes were completely different from the rest of Black Mountain Tribe, and they stood out. They also exuded a great and strong presence of Qi that made Su Ming\u2019s pupils shrink.That power of Qi had already surpassed the Head of the Guards, Shan Hen, and the tribe leader\u2019s Qi. Their level of cultivation and the feeling of countless lives that had been slain in their hands showed that they were Berserkers around the tenth level of the Blood Solidification Realm!However, Su Ming could tell that the eyes of these two black robed men were dull and lifeless, a clear sign that differentiated them from normal people. Yet their movements were agile. Under their leadership, the twenty something Black Mountain Tribe Berserkers rushed towards the elder and the others with excitement and bloodlust.Strange cries were emitted from their lips, and when the sound travelled into the normal tribe members\u2019 ears, they trembled fearfully.\u201cGo quickly!\u201d the elder turned his head and said in a low voice, then turned back and moved towards the Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe. With one swing of his arm, black wind appeared out of thin air and stirred around him, causing a large amount of snow from the area to be lifted before he rushed towards the twenty something Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe.The two men\u2019s in the later stage of the Blood Solidification Realm\u2019s target was clear. They did not look at anyone else. Instead, as their blood veins erupted in explosive power and let out piercing light, they rushed into the black wind and headed straight towards the elder as banging sounds echoed around them.From the other Berserkers who were swept into the black wind, seven to eight of them immediately coughed out blood. Their bodies trembled and immediately collapsed, bursting apart into pieces of flesh and blood. A stench of blood instantly filled the air.The massacre started!Besides the elder, there were only seven Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe protecting the rear. Resolution appeared on their faces, and they absolutely did not cower. Behind them were their tribe members and their families. They could not shrink back, they absolutely would not retreat!The seven people lifted their heads and howled with sadness and determination before they rushed towards the dozens of Berserkers charging towards them. They would do everything to hinder these people and buy time for their tribe members!Their level of cultivation was not high. The strongest among them was at the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm. Most of them were around the fifth level. Yet at that moment, there was an indescribable presence coming from them. That presence screamed out their desire to protect their homes and their tribe members. Even if they died, that will of theirs would never die. Even if their bones were crushed and their bodies turned to ashes, they would not allow their enemies to break through!This was the human wall made with their flesh and blood! This was the ravine created with their lives! This was the desperation created from their souls! This was their choice!Su Ming\u2019s eyes became red. He was not the only one. Most of the Berserkers around him had become possessed by madness. Some of the normal tribe members had already started shouting. They wanted to fight!\u201cDon\u2019t look! Your duty is to protect the tribe as we migrate! We\u2026 have to leave!\u201d Just as Su Ming and the others were about to rush out and join the fray, the tribe leader spoke from where he was in the front. There was a determined look on his face, but underneath that determination was sadness.He was the tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe. His duty was to help as many people from Dark Mountain Tribe to survive as he could, so that the tribe could continue existing\u2026Su Ming clenched his fists. His eyes were bloodshot, but he had to quell his killing intent. He looked at those seven tribe members hundreds of feet away from him, who were assaulted by dozens of screeching Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe that came like a tidal wave.When a thunderous sound reverberated in the area, Su Ming clearly saw one of his tribe members coughing out a mouthful of blood. His right arm exploded, and he staggered backward. Still, he stopped even though both of his legs had collapsed. He continued to cry out ferociously and banged his head into his bloodthirsty and excited enemy\u2019s head. He even opened his mouth and bit down on the dumbstruck enemy Berserker\u2019s neck and tore out his flesh. His enemy let out a sharp and painful cry.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe man from Black Mountain Tribe was terrified. His neck was bloody and torn, and screaming in pain, he punched the Berserker\u2019s chest, causing him to cough out blood. Still, the man viciously bit deeper into his opponent\u2019s flesh. That cruel look on his face and his insane act made the man from Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s heart tremble.At that moment, the tribe member who swallowed the flesh turned his head abruptly and looked at the column that was getting farther away from him. He seemed to have seen Su Ming looking at him from the crowd. A warm smile appeared on his lips. He was a man in his thirties. In his eyes, Su Ming was still just a child.That smile was filled with the kindness of an adult towards a child. It was a completely different look compared to the vicious one he had before. Once that smile appeared, he turned back and closed his eyes. In that instant, all his blood veins exploded, which affected his entire body and caused it to explode in a bang. That violent bang turned into a sound that shook the sky. The moment the person\u2019s body exploded, terror appeared in the eyes of the man whose neck was torn. He wanted to retreat, but it was too late.That was\u2026 the self-triggered explosion of blood veins! That was the last cry made in their lives using every part of their flesh and blood. That voice told all their pursuers from Black Mountain Tribe that if they wanted to destroy Dark Mountain Tribe, they would have to pay a price they could not have imagined!Amidst the roaring, the man from Black Mountain Tribe coughed out a mouthful of blood. His arms had burst apart. He struggled, retreating. No will to fight remained in his body. His heart was trembling. He was afraid.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That sort of self-triggered explosion had happened three times within that short amount of time. From those three explosions alone, Black Mountain Tribe lost seven men!Yet the battle still continued!Tears fell from Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He bit down on his lip and averted his gaze while running forward with his tribe members. He knew that his tribe members defending the rear were using their lives to buy time for them. They were using their flesh and blood to stall their enemies. What Su Ming needed to do at that moment was to not let their lives be sacrificed in vain. They had to protect the normal members of their tribe within this limited amount of time and go farther!The situation was just as intense at the elder\u2019s side. The two men in the later stage of the Blood Solidification Realm seemed as if they did not know pain. Their faces were void of expression even though many parts of their bodies had sustained injuries. Even so, they continued pestering the elder. Yet the elder\u2019s true strength was unknown to most people, including Su Ming himself.The elder let out a cold huff, and numerous ripples appeared around them. The ripples rushed towards them, and the two men in the later stage of the Blood Solidification Realm immediately trembled. The elder took one quick step forward and arrived before them within the span of a breath. He touched one of their heads with a finger, and with a bang, his head exploded. The moment his body fell, the elder swung his fist at the other person, and as a thunderous roar shook through the sky, the man\u2019s body also trembled and burst apart.Yet the moment the two men died, a large amount of black mist appeared from their corpses. The black mist gathered together in the blink of an eye and turned into the vague shape of a person that charged towards the retreating elder.\u201cBi Tu!\u201d The elder narrowed his eyes. He knew that the black mist was not Bi Tu\u2019s original body, but the result of a Fallen Berserker Art. However, if this Art was used, then it meant that Bi Tu was around the area, or perhaps, he was rushing towards this place!At that moment, a sharp cry suddenly came from ahead of the crowd. The sudden appearance of the sound immediately changed the expressions of the tribe leader, the Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe, and all the other tribe members!From the two sides of the forest, the same sharp sound could be heard. A huge gust of wind bellowed, as if telling them that a large amount of their enemies from Black Mountain Tribe surrounded them!If that was the case, it would have been fine. They could leave behind the Berserkers, and they would use their deaths in exchange for the tribe members to continue their migration. But the moment the shouts of excitement and bloodlust echoed around them, the ground trembled from hundreds of feet in front of the tribe leader. The earth sank down as the land shook, and it was quickly followed by a large amount of giant wood around thousands of feet in length and hundreds of feet in breadth suddenly shooting up from the ground like a giant door, completely blocking the tribe\u2019s path!On top of that giant wooden barricade stood three men from Black Mountain Tribe. The leader of the trio was dozens of feet tall. In his hands, he held a bow that was about his height and stared at the people below him with a cruel smile on his lips.At the same time, on both sides of the tribe, two large wooden barricades also appeared from the ground. The height of the barricades, which were around thousands of feet in length, completely trapped Dark Mountain Tribe within them!Several people also stood on top of the two wooden barricades on the sides. They looked down coldly at the people standing below them, and there was a teasing look in their eyes.This was a trap that had been set a long time ago!The expressions of everyone in Dark Mountain Tribe immediately changed. The tribe leader\u2019s face was pale, but his eyes were filled with shocking killing and battle intent. The other Berserkers were the same.\u2018How did they know about our route? How did they manage to lay down this trap beforehand?\u2019 Those were the questions that appeared in all their hearts at that moment.\u2018Who is it? Just who is the traitor of Dark Mountain Tribe?\u2019 Su Ming trembled. In his mind, he recalled the elder once telling him that there was a traitor within their tribe!At the same time, the elder, who was fighting against the black mist formed by Bi Tu\u2019s Fallen Berserker Art in the distance, also saw this scene. Sadness and anger appeared in his eyes. He had suspected that there was a traitor among them, and he used everything that he could to find him, but that person hid himself too well. No traces or hints could be found, as if the traitor had never existed. However, now, the elder was certain. Nonetheless, he still could not figure who the traitor was\u2026 and his motives for betraying the tribe\u2026At that moment of danger, the people from Dark Mountain Tribe were filled with fear and panic. The normal members of the tribe were pale. Just as they thought they were powerless to fight back, whooshing sounds came from the tops of the three barricades, and more Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe appeared. There were about fifty or more people standing on top of the barricades. The elder raised his right hand and abruptly pointed towards the tribe in the distance.The moment he pointed towards them, the weather above the trapped Dark Mountain Tribe suddenly changed. The sky and the land trembled, and a black light that could pierce through heaven appeared. That light gathered together and turned into the astonishing statue of the God of Berserkers from Dark Mountain that was about hundreds of feet in size!It was a ferocious statue that was half man, half beast and filled with the air of savagery since ancient times. It held a dragon in one hand, and in the other, a long spear. There was madness and bloodlust in its eyes.Its appearance immediately turned the sky dark, as if the weather itself was stifled by its mighty presence. However, the statue was not completely distinct in shape. It was slightly faded, as if it could not materialize completely within a short amount of time. Black light scattered from its body and enveloped the people below it, protecting all the people from Dark Mountain Tribe within.\u201cBerserkers of Dark Mountain Tribe, go forth! The tribe members stay within! Fight till we breathe our last!\u201d At that moment, the tribe leader from Dark Mountain Tribe let out a long howl. He leapt upwards at the giant wooden barricade before him. He knew that if they wanted to leave this place, they had to destroy this barricade. Retreating was not an option!\u201cKill them!\u201d All the Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe dashed madly towards their enemies that were already charging at them. The Head of the Guards from Dark Mountain Tribe leapt forward with his bow in hand and drew it. With a thunderous cry, he fired an arrow towards the left barricade.Two other Berserkers followed behind the tribe leader as they too, charged forward with resolution!Bei Ling, Wu La, Lei Chen, and the Berserkers were all fueled with madness and fought with their lives at stake! Shan Hen fell silent and hesitated for a moment before he too, went forward.Su Ming\u2019s heart was filled with killing intent. Just as he was about to move, he heard the sounds of weeping from behind him. The girl he had been carrying was jolted awake and was looking at him with tears falling from her eyes.Su Ming did not turn back. He bounded forward and leapt on the barricade before him. The dozens of Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe on the barricade let out strange cries as they charged towards Su Ming and the other Berserkers by his side, engaging in battle of life and death.It was dusk. The sun in the sky was dim, and the moon was beginning to show itself, a clear sign that night was just around the corner. Su Ming\u2019s blood was boiling. His heart was burning, his anger roaring, and his eyes were bloodshot. He broke through the seal in Wind Stream and dashed madly back to the tribe for only one purpose \u2013 to live and die for the tribe! Now, the time had come!\u2018I was born a member of Dark Mountain, and I will die a member of Dark Mountain!\u2019Su Ming did not hesitate and let all 243 blood veins in his body burst forth with power, showing off his power as a seventh level Berserker in the Blood Solidification Realm. However, there was only chaos in the battlefield. No one took note of his existence.Before him, there was one person who was in the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm among the dozens of men from Dark Mountain Tribe. The others were all around the fifth or sixth level. The man in the seventh level originally had a vicious look on his face as he charged forward with his team. In his eyes, the seven to eight Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe were nothing. He was the vice chief of hunters in Black Mountain Tribe. Killing these people was the same as flicking his wrist.Yet the moment he approached them, his pupils shrank and a look of disbelief appeared on his face. He could clearly feel a vast and powerful amount of Qi that made his heart tremble coming from that the frail looking teenager among the seven to eight people.\u2018Who is he? How could he have such an amount of Qi at his age!\u2019The man did not have time to think. Su Ming had already come close to him within the blink of an eye. His first target was this person!All of it happened in an instant. The two sides clashed together with a loud bang, and the sounds of battle rang through the air, as did voices filled with pain and agony. Su Ming hurled his fist forward. The moment he did so, all 243 blood veins in his body became one and crashed into the man in the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm from Black Mountain Tribe.Thunderous sounds echoed in the air, so that sound was like a speck of dust in that intense battlefield. While Berserkers fought for their lives, the tribe members who were under the protection of the light from the statue were all trembling with pale faces. Yet, they were all determined, and they did not shrink back. They were afraid, but being afraid did nothing to help them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was deep seated hatred and anger that seemed to be able to burn the sky and the earth within their eyes.They were silent. Everyone was silent. The girl who just woke up no longer cried. Instead, she watched Su Ming\u2019s back as he fought for the tribe!When he threw his fist forward, his opponent roared and did the same thing. A thunderous clash sounded as their fists met each other. Blood trickled down from the corner of the man\u2019s lips. There was a dumbfounded look on his face, and his arm seemed to be on the verge of breaking. As the gigantic amount of power rushed towards him, he retreated on instinct. Yet as he retreated, it made Su Ming howl, and without care for his own pain, he blasted forth with shocking speed and got closer to the man within the blink of an eye, then punched him again, and again!Within the blink of an eye, Su Ming had already thrown eight punches, and all of them had landed on the man\u2019s body. It made him stagger backwards with an aghast expression appearing in his eyes, and a large amount of blood flowing out from his mouth. The man hadn\u2019t expected to meet such a mad and powerful Berserker in this place!\u201cDie!\u201d Su Ming closed in on him again. This time, he did not use his fists. Instead, the moment he got closer, he used his head and slammed it against the man\u2019s head. The man let out a sharp cry of pain, and his body was pushed back until he crashed into the giant wooden barricade. With a bang, the man coughed out a large amount of fresh blood. He was completely taken aback by Su Ming\u2019s speed. There was no time to retaliate. Su Ming\u2026 he was too fast!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There\u2019s no one in Dark Mountain Tribe who has this level of power at this age!\u2019The man coughed out blood as shock appeared on his face. His mind was in a mess, and he cried out in his heart.Yet Su Ming was too quick. The moment the man crashed into the giant wooden barricade, he closed in once again with madness and murderous intent. As he thrust his fist forward, he bit down on his tongue and coughed out a mouthful of blood. When the blood appeared, it turned instantly into blood mist, a clear sign that Su Ming just casted Dark Blood Dust.The moment the Art was casted, the mist rushed towards the man. It closed in on the man, who was now in a state of disbelief, and Su Ming\u2019s right hand pierced through the blood mist at the fastest speed he could muster and crashed into the man\u2019s chest.With a loud bang, the giant wooden barricade trembled. The man widened his eyes, and all light disappeared from within them. A large amount of blood escaped from his mouth. There was a hole in his chest, where Su Ming\u2019s fist had blasted through.\u2018Kill them!\u2019Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. He did not stop once he killed that one person. He turned around and rushed towards the other Warriors from Black Mountain Tribe. His fight with the man might have been over in a moment, but all the people from Black Mountain Tribe nearby had seen the entire fight.They could not believe it. They just watched their vice chief of hunters die before their eyes. They did not even manage to follow Su Ming\u2019s body, only seeing an afterimage dashing around.It was not just them. The other Berserkers around Su Ming were also stunned. They knew Su Ming. They were familiar with Su Ming. In their memories, he was just a normal member of their tribe. Previously, they didn\u2019t have time to think why Su Ming had stood in the midst of the other Berserkers, but at that moment, when Su Ming\u2019s strength exploded forth, besides being shocked, they also felt strongly inspired!As Su Ming let out a low growl, the other seven to eight Berserkers from his tribe also roared.\u201cKill them!\u201d\u201cKill all those who destroyed our homes!\u201d Su Ming\u2019s eyes were bloodshot. A strong and boundless presence of Qi erupted from his body, and he threw a punch!\u201cKill all those who slaughtered our tribe members!\u201dOne more punch.\u201cKill all those who murdered our people!\u201dAnother punch.Su Ming\u2019s body flickered around dozens of terrified men from Black Mountain Tribe and showed off just how deep he had sunk into his madness. He had never killed so many people before, had never felt so much hate. At that moment, he was no longer a teenager who had yet to reach seventeen years of age, but a maddened killer.As fresh blood splashed all over the place, a thunderous sound rang out beside Su Ming\u2019s ears, and his heart bled. That was the sound of a tribe member choosing to trigger the explosion of his blood veins because he had sustained too many grave injuries!This was a battle. This was a battle between the invaders and the defenders. This was a crazed battle between two tribes. This was the battle sparked from the hundreds of years of hatred between Dark Mountain Tribe and Black Mountain Tribe that would never end until one of them was completely destroyed!The sudden increase of Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe caused the battle to become so much more intense and tragic. The number of Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe was not great. It was less than that of Black Mountain. Yet at that moment, all the people from Dark Mountain Tribe were persistent. They were willing to give up everything to protect their homes, their tribe members, and their tribe!Death was nothing! Fighting for their homes, for their tribe, for their children, and for their parents was the most brilliant moment of their lives!The light from the statue protected the crowd. In the silence, a sob could be heard, and it echoed outwards. The tribesmen were calling out for the Warriors. They were crying for those that fought to protect them: their children, their fathers, the Berserkers\u2026\u201cMama, why is the sky blue..? Is it because papa is protecting us from above..?\u201d\u201cPapa, why do the stars blink at night..? Is it because mama is there watching us..?\u201dNo one knew who was the first to start mumbling the lyrics, but gradually, almost all the tribe members who were protected by the statue\u2019s light started singing amidst the wails and sobs.Their voices mixed together and gradually turned into a low musical wave. The sound was gentle and sad, but within that gentleness and sadness, there was also an indescribable emotion.Those lyrics belonged solely to Dark Mountain Tribe. When someone from their tribe died, their tribe members would gather around the fire and look at their deceased tribe member as they sang the song of mourning.\u201cLa Su, you are not alone in the sky. Do not be sad. Do not cry. Mama and papa will look at you from where we are\u2026 Every year, every day\u2026 we will look at you\u2026\u201d\u201cI will not cry. I will not be sad. I will not be lonely. I know that you are there, watching me\u2026 I am happy\u2026\u201dThe singing voices gradually grew louder and more distinct amidst the sounds of weeping. When the Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe fighting without fear of death heard the voices of their tribe members and heard the familiar words, sadness appeared on their faces, and they let out depressed growls.They will fight! They will fight until they die!Su Ming trembled. Tears fell from his eyes. His body was covered in fresh blood. Some of it was his own, but the larger part belonged to his enemies.He did not know fatigue, he did not know fear. All he knew was only that he had to fight till he breathed his last. Once he could no longer move, and once his body was too heavily wounded for him to continue fighting, he would trigger his blood veins and self-destruct!\u201cMama\u2026 Papa\u2026 Pipi\u2026\u201d From behind, Su Ming heard the wails of the little girl who had woke up.Su Ming\u2019s heart clenched in pain. It was bleeding. It was as if a countless number of needles had pierced through his heart. It made his speed increase even more. It made his punches even more powerful. Amid the sadness and killing, a song filled with tears echoed in the air.The song was filled with desolation, sadness, and separation\u2026 Not too far away, Liu Di sat under a tree. His legs were already bloody stumps, and his body was covered in blood. His face was pale, and his eyes dim.He raised the xun made of bone with his trembling hands and placed it by his mouth, and begun to play a tragic song. The moaning sound was like the cry of a mother, and it mixed with the low rumbling song sung by their tribe members on the tragic battlefield, turning it into a song that made hearts clench in grief.The sad moans floated with the wind and melted into the snow on the ground. They sank into the tribe members\u2019 blood, causing every single one of them, who heard it, to start crying on the battlefield.Su Ming trembled. This was not the first time he had heard the funeral song, but it was the first time he cried like this. It made him feel as if he lost his heart, turning him into a heartless person. The only thing left behind were the injuries decorating his entire body and the endless sadness he felt.Besides the sorrowful funeral song, Su Ming also heard the sounds of exploding caused by self-destruction. Each boom symbolized another Berserker from his tribe choosing to make his blood veins explode.\u201cDon\u2019t count me out from the road to hell!\u201d Su Ming smiled brokenly. He threw another punch outward and blasted another enemy of his tribe into pieces of flesh. Su Ming, too, coughed out a mouthful of blood. As he turned around, he saw his tribe member playing the song underneath the tree before his death.That tribe member\u2019s eyes may have been dim, but there was still a hint of light within. He played the song, and the blood on his hands stained the xun made of bone. Nonetheless, it could not dampen his song, his sadness, and his parting words.This was the very last song he would play for his tribe. This time, he played the song with his life\u2026Su Ming closed his eyes and averted his gaze. The moment he did so, his pupils shrank suddenly. He saw, in the other direction, three men from Black Mountain Tribe standing before Bei Ling. They forced Bei Ling to continuously retreat with their vicious excitement. Bei Ling\u2019s bow was broken. There were a lot of wounds on his body, and especially on his chest. A large amount of blood poured out from the wounds on his chest. His face was pale. In his hands, he held a knife made of bone. There was stubbornness and solemnness in his actions as he madly continued to attack his enemies.He could not retreat. Behind him were his tribe members. Even if his tribe members were protected by the light from the statue, he could not retreat. There was a girl behind him. That girl was crying as she looked at Bei Ling, at his trembling body, and at his back, which stood firm before her like a hill.That girl was Chen Xin. She seemed to be shouting something, telling something to Bei Ling.Su Ming was standing far away from them. He could not hear them, but he could tell the gentleness hidden in Chen Xin\u2019s eyes as she looked at Bei Ling.She liked Bei Ling. At that moment, she became even surer of her feelings. She\u2026 liked him.Tears fell from her eyes when she saw Bei Ling tremble and one of the three men from Black Mountain Tribe approach, laughing viciously. As the bone knife went to Bei Ling\u2019s head as quickly as lightning, Chen Xin let out a sharp and mournful cry before she\u2026 rushed forward.Bei Ling smiled brokenly. He was too tired and could no longer continue fighting. Since yesterday, he had been immersed in one battle after another. He knew that he could not avoid the attack. Just as he was about to self-destruct, he looked at Chen Xin, who was hugging him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlright, since you came, then leave with me\u2026\u201d Just as Bei Ling closed his eyes and was about to make his blood veins explode, a sudden thunderous roar resounded through the sky and shook their entire surroundings. Every single one of the Berserkers, including the people from Black Mountain Tribe fighting against them, felt their hearts tremble when they heard the sound, which reverberated and shook the sky and earth.A long red spear rushed towards Bei Ling\u2019s direction at an incredible speed. That long spear exuded a powerful murderous intent, and with an of air madness, turned into a giant red eagle that was seen by everyone present on the battlefield. Within the span of a breath, it whizzed past Bei Ling and pierced through the chest of the man from Black Mountain Tribe who was about to swing his knife downwards. With a thunderous boom, the man\u2019s body was impaled to the ground. At the same moment, a huge wave of Qi erupted forth and spread to their surroundings. The man\u2019s body exploded abruptly, turning into pieces of flesh and blood.The other two men from Black Mountain Tribe trembled and took a few steps back on instinct as they coughed out blood. At that very moment, a person leapt towards them like lightning and stood before Bei Ling, replacing everything in their sights!The moment he saw the back of the person, a huge wave stirred in Bei Ling\u2019s heart. He was familiar with this sight. He experienced this once in Wind Stream Tribe. There was one person who had stood before him like this. Even if their faces and body shapes were different, at that moment, their bodies overlapped in Bei Ling\u2019s eyes.\u201cSu\u2026 Ming\u2026\u201d Bei Ling\u2019s eyes were filled with disbelief. He stood there, stunned, and he understood everything\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That feeling was so incredibly familiar that he knew, he knew that that person\u2026 was also Su Ming!All these thoughts appeared like thunderbolts in Bei Ling\u2019s head. They were like lighting travelling through his mind. It made his body tremble. He did not dare to believe all of it, finding it hard to comprehend how it could be true. Su Ming had, at some unknown point of time, silently obtained such an amount of power that even Bei Ling had to look up to him.In his memories, Su Ming was the one he had always been jealous of, whom he had treated with disdain in his heart, spoken to indifferently, so the change now threw his heart into a state of chaos.That complicated feeling made him forget that he was still in the battlefield, surrounded by slaughter, and everything else around him. His head was completely blank, and he was at a loss.\u201cHow could this be..?\u201d Bei Ling mumbled. Chen Xin hugged him tightly, tears falling from her eyes. She did not see Su Ming, there was only Bei Ling\u2019s pale face before her eyes and the sight of his back standing before her like a mountain.This might seem to have happened slowly, but in truth, the moment Su Ming\u2019s spear stirred up the wave of Qi on the ground, and the body of the man with the knife exploded, Su Ming took a leap forward. His speed left behind an afterimage that rushed towards the person who was pushed back by the wave of Qi. That person was in his fifties, but he was only at the fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm.He only managed to take a few steps back when his vision blurred. His pupils immediately shrank, and he was about to retreat backwards when he felt a strong sense of danger. But Su Ming was just too fast. Before the man managed to retreat, he closed in on the him just as a loud booming sound reverberated through the air. There was a vicious expression on Su Ming\u2019s face, and it was filled with furious murderous intent. He did not use his fists, but his entire body, and crashed into the man\u2019s chest.Rumbling sounds echoed in the air. Blood trickled down the man\u2019s lips. His back exploded abruptly, because his body could not bear the incredible force brought by Su Ming\u2019s attack. In an instant, all the bones in his body were crushed. His body was thrown to the back, and before he even landed on the ground, he breathed his last.The hate in Su Ming\u2019s eyes did not decrease. It only became much stronger. He hated everyone from Black Mountain Tribe. He turned around suddenly and fixed his eyes on the last of the three Warriors from Black Mountain Tribe who had wanted to kill Bei Ling. He was standing not too far away from Su Ming.That person was sturdy looking, but he was not tall. The vicious smile and excited look he had when he wanted to kill Bei Ling was now gone. That smile was replaced with a horrified look on his face, and his eyes were filled with terror. He could only watch in shock as Su Ming killed a person with a throw of his spear, and then another with his body.The quick and clean kills made the man feel as if Su Ming was surrounded by cruelty and madness. His heart pounded against his chest. When Su Ming turned his eyes towards him, he immediately let loose a terrified scream and retreated without care for anything. He was afraid. In his mind, Su Ming was definitely at the same level as the leaders in Dark Mountain Tribe. This was not someone who he could fight with.Yet before the man could even take three steps backwards, a sharp cry cut through the air. An arrow travelled from the distance, seeming to slice through the air. It closed in on the man in an instant and pierced through his neck before sinking into the tree behind him with his blood on its body. The arrow thumped upon contact, causing the tree to jolt.The man held his neck, but blood continued pouring from his wound. His eyes dimmed, and he fell to the ground. His corpse was soon trampled by all the Warriors who were still trying to kill those from the opposite tribe.In the distance, the exhausted Head of the Guards quickly turned his gaze away and continued fighting against the leader from Black Mountain Tribe, who was at the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm.Su Ming walked towards Bei Ling and stopped before him, then pulled Blood Scales out from the ground. Once he managed to free it, something flickered in his eyes. He was about to continue fighting against those from Black Mountain Tribe when he heard Bei Ling\u2019s voice, filled with conflict and hesitation, travel into his ears.\u201cThank you\u2026\u201dThe voice was caught between the sounds of battle and the moans of the xun. It sounded weak. Su Ming did not seem to hear it. Once he pulled out his spear, he walked away. Yet, he only took a few steps forward before faltering.\u201cIt already happened, so let it go\u2026 You have to live for Chen Xin\u2026\u201d Su Ming said, then bounded towards the crowd closest to him fighting against each other.The moment Su Ming sped forward, an aloof look from the barricade far away from him turned towards him. That gaze belonged to a man wearing a sackcloth. He seemed to be in his forties. His body was incredibly strong and looked like an iron tower. He was covered in fresh blood, but most of it belonged to the Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe.The strength of his Qi spoke of a man at the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. His power was about the same as Ye Wang\u2019s, who had fought against Su Ming some time ago.The moment he looked towards Su Ming, that man lifted his right hand. There was a long knife made of bone in his hand. The moment he swung that knife down, he decapitated a Warrior from Dark Mountain Tribe who was fighting against him.That tribe member did not even have time to trigger the explosion of his blood veins. His head was caught by that man, and he threw it towards where he had seen Su Ming.The head fell by Su Ming\u2019s feet, blood flowing from the severed neck. The blood dyed the snow red, and the heat from the blood quickly melted the snow into a puddle of blood and water.Su Ming stopped and lifted his head in the direction the head had come from. His eyes met with the other\u2019s through the crowd, and Su Ming saw the cruelty and aloofness in the man\u2019s eyes. The man too, saw Su Ming\u2019s madness and killing intent in his bloodshot eyes.The moment their gazes met, the man moved. He rushed towards Su Ming, just as Su Ming stomped on the ground and charged at the man just as quickly!The man wore a sackcloth, not beast skins, which indicated that his status in Black Mountain Tribe was rather high. If Su Ming could kill that person, then it would definitely deal a heavy blow on Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s morale.The moment the man moved, due to his status, it immediately attracted the attention of a lot of people from Black Mountain Tribe who were engaged in battle. It was as if he stirred up their morale, and the Warriors let out strange cries as they rushed forward and continued their massacre.The two people closed in on each other, and within an instant, they clashed with a loud bang and engaged each other in an intense battle to the death.Yet at that moment, right in the forefront of the Dark Mountain Tribe, their tribe leader coughed out blood. His face was pale as he staggered back. Before him, more than half of the people from Black Mountain Tribe had died, but a man who wore black robes similar to those the two who had fought against the elder earlier appeared. With an astonishing force, he injured the tribe leader in one move and forced him to move back.The man\u2019s, who was dressed in black robes, eyes were blank, but there was a hint of bloodlust within them. He took a large step forward, and behind him, there were two other Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe. They rushed towards the retreating tribe leader. By the looks of it, they wanted to kill the injured tribe leader with just one move. The other Warriors who fought beside the tribe leader previously had all self-destructed. He was left alone in the front.Just as the tribe leader seemed as if he could not escape from death, and the people behind him let out cries of anger and sadness, one person suddenly rushed out from the crowd. That man was an elderly person. He was Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s Nan Song!The moment he stepped forward, he let out a light sigh and stomped the ground with his right foot. It did not produce a loud sound, but the man in black robes who had attacked the tribe leader and was currently in pursuit of his life trembled suddenly and staggered. As shock appeared on his face, Nan Song walked out before the old man. With his skinny right arm, he swung his fist forward, completely stopping the man\u2019s footsteps. These two people engaged in battle right before the tribe.Yet there were two other Berserkers by the side of the man dressed in black robes. One of them, who held a big bow in his hands, was the Head of the Guards from Black Mountain Tribe. This person might have been surprised by Nan Song\u2019s appearance, but with the man dressed in black around, he gritted his teeth and continued chasing after Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s tribe leader. There was cruelty and excitement in his eyes. He could already imagine the glory he would gain in the tribe the moment he killed Dark Mountain\u2019s tribe leader and obtained his head.The tribe leader smiled brokenly. He was still several dozens of feet away from the crowd protected by the light of the statue. At that moment, he knew that he could not go back.Nonetheless, there was no regret in his eyes. There was only reluctance. He did not regret dying in battle. He was the tribe leader. Dying in battle for the tribe was a feat of glory. But he did not want to leave them\u2026 He did not want to leave the tribe so soon. He had to bring his people to a safe place\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSu Ming saw the danger the tribe leader was in, as did many other people. Yet under the vicious assault by Black Mountain Tribe, no one could rush over to help him. After all, the tribe leader\u2019s life from Dark Mountain was in question. All the Warriors of Black Mountain Tribe started blocking the other Warriors\u2019 path excitedly, trapping each and every single one of them so that they could not save their tribe leader.Su Ming wanted to rush over, but the man wearing the sackcloth from Black Mountain Tribe sneered coldly, blocking Su Ming\u2019s path and causing him to be unable to rush over. He did not even have the chance to throw his long spear.At that moment, when Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s tribe leader could no longer avoid death, dozens of normal teenagers came to the barrier\u2019s edge closest to the tribe leader and stood before the crowd whilst under the protection of the statue.These teenagers trembled. They were a useless bunch in the tribe. They did not possess the Body of Calamity, nor did they have strong bodies. Usually, while the tribe was busy working, they would be hanging around doing nothing because they were the family members of Warriors who once died in battle. It made them think that they were somehow priveleged, and no matter what they did, as long as they did not betray the tribe, they could live that way forever.They never forgot the glory their families once had, but they did not choose to inherit the responsibility that came with the glory. Instead, they chose to let the protection offered by the glory be an excuse for their laziness and arrogance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their terror towards it made them feel as if their hearts were about to be crushed. That was why they had not dared to walk at the back of the column, but rather chose to walk in the middle. Yet the middle of the crowd was filled with orphaned La Sus. That was why they could only choose to rely on the tribe leader and walk at the forefront of the crowd, believing that place to be safe. They thought that the tribe leader could protect them from everything.Yet now, their tribe leader was in danger right before their very eyes. If they chose not to walk out of the light from the statue, they would still be safe\u2026At that dangerous moment, the face of one of the dozens of teenagers in front of the crowd was pale, and his body trembled. Fear seemed to have conquered his entire weak body. Nonetheless, for the first time in his life, desperation and red lines appeared in his eyes.\u201cI\u2019ve lived most of my life like an ignorant fool. I lived every single day of my life easily and wasted them away while waiting for death. I did not do anything for the tribe, but wasted so much food.

I may be useless, but I\u2019m still a member of the tribe!\u201dThe teenager\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he roared and rushed outside, straight towards the tribe leader. He would use his flesh and blood and die for the tribe leader! Using his own life, he would become a wall that would protect the tribe leader!With a bang, the teenager exchanged places with the retreating tribe leader, and the young man stood behind him, facing the enemy. At that same moment, a sharp arrow sliced through the air and pierced through his body. He burst apart and died.\u201cDad\u2026 your La Su\u2026 is not useless\u2026\u201d Before the teenager died, he smiled brokenly.The very same moment the youth rushed out and died, all his friends, too, howled and dashed out madly. They would use their lives to repay the tribe for all the years it had provided for them. They would use their lives, and once again welcome the glory they once obtained when one of their family had died.\u201cWe may be useless, but we\u2019re still part of the tribe!\u201d the dozens of teenagers roared.They would use their fragile bodies and blood to create a wall for their tribe leader and their people. Thunderous booms continued crackling in the air. It was clear that the two men from Black Mountain Tribe who were pursuing the tribe leader did not expect the normal members of Dark Mountain Tribe to rush out at this moment. Nevertheless, there was only disdain and scorn in their eyes. To them, these normal people were so weak they would all die from one hit.Amidst the blasts, these dozens of people were all dyed in their own blood, their limbs torn off, but they continued using their lives and willpower to block the enemies\u2019 advance. Some of them even clutched tightly onto the Head of the Guards from Black Mountain Tribe. Even if their bodies were blown apart by the shock, they continued gritting their teeth and holding their ground.It was disastrous. The devastation of the battle seemed to have reached its peak at that very moment. The willpower of these teenagers seemed to have shaken the two men in pursuit. They did not expect these normal people from Dark Mountain Tribe to posses such insanity and determination, so much so that they managed to delay their chase by the span of around two breaths.The time of two breaths may be short, and these young men had paid for it with their lives, but these two breaths, they changed the fate of the tribe leader\u2019s life. Consumed by grief, the tribe leader reached the light coming from the statue. His heart felt as if it was being stabbed by knives, but he knew that he could not die, not because of his own wish to live, but because of the tribe.He looked at the corpses that filled the ground before him, at the bunch of people who had once given him headaches, and who he even somewhat disliked. He stared at the once familiar faces now turned into mangled corpses, and the tribe leader, a man built like a tower in his forties, cried.Behind him, many of the tribe members also cried. These dozens of teenagers used their lives to tell all of them that they may be useless weaklings, but they were also members of the tribe. They could also die for the tribe!Su Ming bit his lip and clashed repeatedly against the man before him. All 243 blood veins in his body had gathered as one, and as he growled, he continued fighting against the man.His specialty was speed, and the man\u2019s was strength, similar to Ye Wang. This fight was extremely eye-catching, even amidst the battlefield. Lei Chen saw it, Wu La saw it, and many of their tribe members saw it, too.The little girl stood in the crowd and watched Su Ming as she cried, terrified.At that moment, a shocking rumble came from the distance. Far away, the black mist formed using a Fallen Berserker Art casted by Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s Elder, Bi Tu, abruptly crumbled apart after fighting for a long while with the elder. It turned into numerous black puffs of air that swept around its surroundings. The elder then went back to the tribe with an indescribable presence.The elder had returned!It was as if he simply took three steps in the air to come back. When his first step landed, the elder suddenly appeared beside Su Ming. The man from Black Mountain Tribe was caught by surprise, and the elder touched the center of his brows with a finger. Then the man trembled and coughed out a large amount of blood, staggering backwards. At the center of his brows, a bloody hole appeared, and soon, light disappeared from his eyes, and he fell to the ground, dead.The elder did not stop. He took another step and appeared at the forefront of the tribe, right beside the man in black battling against Nan Song. With a ghastly wave of his right hand, the man shook furiously before his body burst apart and he died.A presence that seemed to shake the sky and earth appeared explosively on the elder\u2019s body as he killed a person with each step he took. His presence birthed fear in all the people from Black Mountain Tribe, and they retreated.Agitation appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes, and he was not the only one filled with such an emotion. All the people from Dark Mountain Tribe let out excited cries.At that moment, the elder took the third step and appeared right before the giant wooden barricade blocking the path forward. With one kick, the barricade crumbled with a bang, turning into countless shards that were about to scatter to the ground when the elder swung his arm. The shards all turned into sharp arrows and sped through the empty spaces between the people of Dark Mountain Tribe, and straight towards all the retreating Berserkers of Black Mountain Tribe.In an instant, cries of pain echoed in the air.The moment he finished taking those three steps, a sickly red flush appeared on the elder\u2019s face, but it disappeared very soon, and once it did, he turned around before speaking calmly, \u201cDon\u2019t stop here, move!\u201dThe moment he spoke, the people from Dark Mountain Tribe left under the guidance of the tribe leader while all those from Black Mountain Tribe did not dare to try and stop them due to the grievous blow they had sustained to their numbers.Dark Mountain Tribe quickly moved forward. Liu Di, who was leaning against the big tree and was on the verge of dying, was also lifted up by the people and carried away.Very soon, the battlefield became silent. The only things left were the corpses that filled the ground and the stench of blood that stayed in the air for a long time.Su Ming stood in the crowd, his body drenched in blood. He moved forward quickly and silently. Beside him was a tribe member holding onto the little girl. She was no longer crying. Strength appeared within her innocent eyes.She was still young and did not understand a lot of things, but during this night, she too, grew up.Moonlight scattered on the ground, lighting up the path for the now homeless people of Dark Mountain Tribe, so that they would no longer be bewildered and helpless.\u201cTribe leader, Elder\u2026 Let us old folks stay behind. Don\u2019t let our people take care of us anymore and affect their speed at which they can travel\u2026\u201d an old voice said from within the crowd.The man coughed. He was a normal old man from the tribe and was already very old, unable to keep up with the long journey. In his mind, instead of having someone support him while dragging down the tribe\u2019s speed, he would rather stay behind.\u201cLet the young\u2019uns leave. I\u2019ll stay\u2026 Honestly, we should have chosen to stay in the tribe\u2026 Ha.\u201dAnother old man also stopped moving.Very soon, almost all of the old people from the tribe walked out of the crowd one by one. They numbered to about forty people, and all of them chose to stubbornly stay behind. They could not use their remaining lives to tell the tribe that they were useful, but they could not allow themselves to drag down the tribe\u2019s advancement.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThe tribe leader was stunned. He closed his eyes, then soon reopened them and bowed deeply to these old people of the tribe.\u201cGo\u2026 We\u2019re tired\u2026\u201dThe old folks smiled. They waved towards their tribe members. Their families were within that crowd of people, and they cried, but could do nothing to stop them. Some of the stronger tribe members volunteered to stay, but were not allowed to do so.One of the elderly walked out and looked at the elder with a smile on his face. \u201cElder, is there a method for us old folks to use so that we can explode and hurt others just like the young\u2019uns did? Tell us.\u201dThe elder fell silent for a while before walking forward. He placed an object in the hands of the old man and patted his shoulder, letting out a soft sigh. He knew that this was not a time for him to be weak. There were far too many tribe members that needed to move quickly. He turned around.\u201cThe rest, continue moving!\u201dThe elderly watched their tribe leave them, its members silently crying and frequently turning their heads back. Warm and gentle smiles appeared on the old people\u2019s faces. They sat down, panting harshly, and started talking about the things that had happened to them when they were young, about their past glory.Moonlight illuminated their silhouettes.Once the old folks stayed behind, the column moved much faster\u2026After a long while, once daylight appeared in the horizon, the home of Dark Mountain Tribe, which was left behind by its people, turned into a desolate ruin under the illumination of the moonlight.It seemed like there was no sign of life within those ruins, and they would eventually turn into a remnant of the passage of time. Perhaps the few remaining trees and plants would continue growing there and slowly turn the place into a part of the forest, making it difficult for people to come looking for their memories and the beautiful moments that had happened during their time here.Wind was blowing at the moment. It sounded like the moaning of the xun as it lifted the snow off the ground and swept gently through the land. It also lifted a lot of things left behind by the tribe members, and as they were whisked away from the ground, they created sashaying sounds that brought out a feeling of desolation.Among the things left behind, there were toys belonging to children, hides that the tribe members did not manage to take with them, ashes from extinguished fires, scattered herbs, a lot of kitchen utensils, and pieces of the houses that had broken off.Besides the sound of the wind, the ruins of the tribe were in silence, but one of the collapsed houses moved at that moment. A furry and round little creature poked its head out from the ruins. This little creature was very cute. Its fur was originally white, yet at that moment, its fur was grey. Its eyes were filled with fear as it quickly ran out of the house. It trembled under the snowstorm.Squeaks came out from its mouth, as if it was calling out to its owner. Its name was Pipi, and it was the little girl\u2019s pet.Yet its owner could not hear its cries\u2026 It stayed behind alone in the ruins of the tribe, refusing to be too far away from the collapsed house because that was its home.As it continued squeaking, the little creature slowly retreated as if no longer able to withstand the cold and wishing to return to the house. Yet at that moment, footsteps came from the distance. Dozens of people walked through the tribe\u2019s broken gate.A strong man led the team, but his face was gloomy and dark. If Su Ming had been here, then he would recognize the man as the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBehind him was a teenager who had a similar gloomy and dark look on his face. The young man licked his lips as he looked at his surroundings, a cruel smile appearing on his face. That person was Bi Su!\u201cThey sure left quickly! After them. The elder should be here soon. This time, besides the women from Dark Mountain Tribe, leave no one alive!\u201d the tribe leader said slowly and left the ruins.Bi Su looked away from his surroundings. He was just about to follow the tribe leader when a glint suddenly appeared in his eyes. He saw the little trembling creature that did not dare to move. His lips curled up slightly, and he waved his right hand at it.Immediately, the little creature jolted and light faded away from its eyes. A green presence rose from its carcass, which Bi Su caught in his hands and placed at the center of his brows. After a moment, a cruel look appeared in his eyes.\u201cPipi, is it..? You miss your owner, don\u2019t you? Then I\u2019ll send her to you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was already a faint and dim light at the horizon. Pale moonlight fell on the snow in the forest, making the light seem cold. As messy crunching sounds appeared, the people of Dark Mountain Tribe moved quickly before dawn.It was quiet all around them. Besides the sounds of crunching snow, there was virtually no other sound. All the people of Dark Mountain Tribe were silent. The elderly, the women, and even the La Sus fell silent as they continued migrating during that night.Several hours had passed since the previous battle. The level of devastation from that battle was deeply imprinted in all of their minds and souls. They would never forget it.Before they left, without including the elder, Dark Mountain Tribe had more than thirty Berserkers. After the battle, there were only fourteen Berserkers left. The blood on these fourteen Berserkers\u2019 body had dried up. As they moved forward with grief and sadness, they carried with them a murderous air as they silently protected their tribe members.Dozens of their own had died, but Black Mountain Tribe had paid an even greater price. This was related to their levels of cultivation, but more importantly, the intruders from Black Mountain Tribe did not have the persistence that the people of Dark Mountain Tribe had because they were forced to leave their homes.It was called a protector\u2019s courage. If they had only self-destructed once, perhaps it would have only brought disdain to the intruders from Black Mountain Tribe, but once it happened twice, thrice, four times\u2026 then it bring about terror among those from Black Mountain Tribe.Dark Mountain Tribe may be weak, but within that weakness, there was strength!Su Ming walked silently. After the battle, he had yet to speak a single word. He was originally just a cheerful child with the recklessness of a teenager, but now, he had learned how to be quiet and not scream out his feelings like a wild beast.Yet the price for him to learn how to be quiet was too great. It made his heart hurt.Su Ming knew that from this day onwards, his innocence was destroyed and had left his body. From this day onwards, his happiness had melted and disappeared into his body. From this day onwards, his tears were replaced by silence.Time passed by. Very soon, daylight arrived. The tribe had walked for an entire night, but they did not stop even though they were tired. All of them gritted their teeth and supported each other as they moved so quickly it was close to a running speed.Daylight gradually passed by as they continued moving. During the journey, some of them fell down, unable to bear the fatigue. After resting for an hour, they would continue moving.The people of Dark Mountain Tribe continued walking quickly in their silence, even when the second midnight fell upon them and moonlight once again shone on the snow in the forest.\u201cSu Ming\u2026\u201dA frightened and fragile voice travelled to Su Ming\u2019s ears. He turned his head and saw the little girl beside him who was being carried by another tribe member.When he saw her clean and innocent eyes, Su Ming forced out a smile. Yet that smile looked really creepy when it was matched with the blood on his face.Nonetheless, the girl did not feel afraid. She widened her eyes instead and looked at Su Ming. After a moment of hesitation, she lifted her slightly dirtied hands and wiped away some of the dried blood on Su Ming\u2019s face.When he felt the little girl\u2019s delicate hands touching his face, warmth appeared through Su Ming\u2019s painfully bleeding heart.\u201cSu Ming, don\u2019t be afraid\u2026 Tong Tong is not afraid either\u2026\u201d The little girl retrieved her hands. Some blood flecks stained her hands. She looked at him, and in her bright eyes, there was a resolute look that was rarely seen in children.Su Ming patted the little girl\u2019s head. He did not look at her, but chose to look ahead. The road ahead was hidden by the forest, and he could not see where their future lay.Lei Chen stood on the other side of the crowd. He still had his fists clenched tightly. The blood on his back had dried up, and he ignored the pain in his body. There was bloodlust in his eyes, but there was also sadness. He would never forget the battle that had happened the previous night. If it were not for a heavily wounded adult Berserker self-destructing to save him, then his corpse would now be left behind in that battlefield.Before him was Wu La. The girl\u2019s face was pale, and she looked exhausted. There was dried blood on her left arm, and she seemed unable to lift it up. There was a large bloodied part on her face, causing her originally pretty face to be gone.Yet there was no sign of surrender in her eyes. She still had the stubborn persistence that was within all the other members of Dark Mountain Tribe.Behind them were Bei Ling and Chen Xin. They held hands as if they never wanted to be separated. They continued protecting the crowd as they walked.The elder continued his vigil at the back. His white hair and face full of wrinkles made Su Ming\u2019s heart clench even tighter from pain when he saw them, because he could feel the elder\u2019s fatigue.The moon was not in a crescent shape during the second night. It was slowly leaning towards becoming a full moon. Nonetheless, it was clear that it was not yet the night of the full moon. Perhaps it would be tomorrow, or perhaps the day after tomorrow.As the tribe continued migrating, sometimes, some Berserkers of theirs would rush back towards them. Their numbers were few and consisted of a team of four people. These four people were the tribe\u2019s scouts. They risked their lives to report any and all changes back to the tribe after a certain amount of time.If they did not return, then it meant something had happened.Very soon, two hours passed by. The sky was dark and it was as if there was a pair of terrifying eyes in the sky staring at the ground and at the people of Dark Mountain Tribe as they travelled quickly.At that moment, only three of the four people returned when another scouting session ended. The one scouting the back disappeared without a trace. All the hairs on Su Ming\u2019s body rose. A sharp look appeared in his eyes as he stopped and turned around. There were also others who noticed that something bad was about to happen. A glint appeared in the elder\u2019s eyes, and he gripped the bone cane in his hands.Suddenly, a faint booming sound came from the distance. When that sound travelled into their ears, Su Ming\u2019s grief became even stronger.He knew that sound. It was a Berserker triggering his own blood veins to explode.He knew that their enemies from Black Mountain Tribe had arrived once again!\u201cDon\u2019t stop! Increase your speed! All Berserkers protect the tribe! We will fight as we retreat!\u201d The elder slammed the bone cane in his hands on the ground. He lifted his left hand and swung it over the tribe. Immediately, the space above the tribe twisted and Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s statue of the God of Berserkers appeared once again. It floated above the tribe and gave off a protective light.It moved with the tribe as they travelled. With it around, as long as it was not broken, then the light would ensure the tribe\u2019s safety.The moment Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s statue appeared, the elder lifted his head abruptly. A grave look that had never once showed during that entire battle appeared on his face. The darkness came to his eyes as he stared at the dark sky above him.The darkened sky suddenly changed. A red light appeared out of nowhere and fused together with the darkness, turning it into a shade of purple. The red light continued expanding like fresh blood, and within the blink of an eye, it covered half the sky.A hoarse and sullen voice came from the sky, and the sound travelled all around them.\u201cMo Sang\u2026\u201d As the voice echoed in the air, a strong pressure suddenly descended upon them. All the people from Dark Mountain Tribe instantly felt the pressure on their bodies the moment it appeared. Even Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s statue shook because of it.Su Ming\u2019s heart raced in his chest. He had felt this incredible pressure before from the Elder of Wind Stream Tribe, Jing Nan. This pressure belonged to a Berserker who had Awakened!This was the natural might executed from the Berserkers in the Awakened Realm towards those still in the Blood Solidification Realm. Under this pressure, the Qi within the Berserkers still in the Blood Solidification Realm began to circulate on their own.As the pressure appeared, and the red light continued spreading across the sky, and as the moon in the sky started turning blood red because of it, an indescribable feeling rose within Su Ming. One that no one else but him felt and experienced at that moment.It was the sort of feeling similar to the one when he saw the blood red moon as he performed the burning of blood. In fact, it even gave him a sense of familiarity. It was as if there was a gigantic Wings of the Moon hidden in the sky at that moment.This sort of misconception that threw him into disbelief made Su Ming\u2019s heart lurch. Very soon, he saw a person walking slowly out of the red light from the sky.That person wore a black robe. He was thin, and his skin looked dry. His face was very dark and sullen. He walked forth one step at a time with his hands behind his back until he stood in the sky and looked down at the land beneath him.At the center of his brows was a picture of Wings of the Moon. The picture looked vivid, almost as if it was real. It let out an enchanting red light that made it seem almost alive.Bi Tu!The Elder of Black Mountain Tribe, Bi Tu!\u201cMo Sang, stop waiting for Jing Nan and Wen Yan. They\u2026 are in enough trouble as it is, and will definitely not have time to bother about your tribe!\u201d Bi Tu let out a dark laugh and looked at the elder standing behind the crowd.The elder was silent. He was indeed waiting for Jing Nan, but when Jing Nan did not appear on their journey towards Wind Stream Tribe, he knew that something had happened in Wind Stream Tribe.\u201cNan Song, you were only slightly beneath Mo Sang in the past. You were as bright as the sun, yet once you ran to Dark Mountain Tribe, you became a worthless piece of garbage. All these years, I\u2019ve been thinking about the expression on your father\u2019s face when he begged me to spare you before he died. It\u2019s a pity, I never intended to let you live, but you still managed to escape. Nan Song, the previous Berserker\u2019s Son of Black Mountain Tribe\u2026 we meet again.\u201d Bi Tu\u2019s lips curled up slightly, but very soon that smile spread wider and wider until he began laughing maniacally.Standing outside the crowd, the white haired Nan Song looked at Bi Tu standing in the air. He was not at all angered by Bi Tu\u2019s words because he had already learned to let go of everything. He let out a faint sigh.\u201cCompared to you, who poisoned the previous Elder of Black Mountain Tribe, went after the life of the previous Elder\u2019s Berserker\u2019s Son, then sacrificed half of Black Mountain Tribe in exchange for a Fallen Berserker Art, I can\u2019t compare\u2026\u201d Nan Song remained calm, but the wrinkles on his face seemed to have increased by a large amount in that instant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWe should settle the grudge we harbored all those years ago. Mo Sang, Nan Song, I\u2019ll give you both a chance! I\u2019ll let you both fight against me!\u201d Bi Tu laughed loudly, then swung his right hand. Thunderous roars shook heaven and earth immediately. Behind Bi Tu\u2019s back, the never ending red light in the sky turned into extremely thick blood fog in an instant. The fog tumbled like waves, then turned into a gigantic Wings of the Moon!The Wings of the Moon spread its wings, covering the sky and the moon.\u201cNan Song, leave Bi Tu to me\u2026 I\u2019ll hold him back\u2026 I leave the tribe to you!\u201d The elder took in a deep breath and swept his gaze across his tribe. He looked at their silent faces as if he wanted to find the traitor among them, but only let out a sigh in the end. All his people were exhausted and covered in fresh blood. How could he suspect his people who fought for the tribe? He saw the grief on the Head of the Guards\u2019 face and the deep gash on Shan Hen\u2019s neck.\u2018Perhaps there isn\u2019t a traitor at all\u2026\u2019 Before the elder averted his gaze, he looked at Su Ming deeply, then abruptly leapt into the air. A giant dark python materialized and dashed into the sky like a shooting star with him.Thunderous rumbles echoed in the sky. As the elder approached him, Bi Tu laughed loudly. The sky was covered by red fog, and it enveloped both of them within it. The people in the tribe could not see what was inside, but the sounds of thunder shook the sky and earth nonetheless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He saw the elder leaving and also how the elder had looked at him before he left. There was an emotion within the elder\u2019s eyes that made him afraid.\u2018Wings of the Moon\u2026 Wings of the Moon\u2026 The Fire Berserker Art\u2026\u2019Su Ming looked at the Wings of the Moon in the sky which was created from the red fog. He might be afraid, but a vague thought appeared in his head. Yet the thought was a little scattered, and he did not manage to make any sense of it. Still, he had a feeling that once he cleared his thoughts, then whatever that idea was, it would turn out to be extremely useful.As thunderous rumbles echoed in the sky, a strange cry appeared from their back, the darker parts of the forest. Dozens of people ran towards them. These people were the third wave of pursuers from Black Mountain Tribe. The head was the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe, and behind him, Su Ming saw the sullen Bi Su!The moment the pursuers from Black Mountain Tribe arrived, Su Ming ran to the back without hesitation. With him were Bei Ling, Lei Chen, the Head of the Guards, and some other Berserkers.The other Berserkers from Dark Mountain, besides the tribe leader and another three people, too charged forward! They will protect their tribe, and they will fight as they retreat with the tribe!The tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe averted his gaze from the end of the crowd as tears filled his eyes. He led his people and continued onward under the protection of the light from the statue. The tribe ran, supporting each other so that no one would be left behind. Wu La also stayed back to protect others beside the tribe leader. Her powers were not great, and she was forced to stay with the crowd.The last person who stayed with the migrating crowd was Shan Hen. He did not choose to fight, but quietly stood outside the column and lifted a few children who could no longer run due to exhaustion as he ran with the tribe.Su Ming did not turn back to look. Instead, he silently dashed towards the dozens of Black Mountain Berserkers with killing intent boiling within him and started fighting against them!He held a long spear in his hands. That spear was entirely red, and it continued to be dyed in fresh blood as it stayed by Su Ming\u2019s side fighting with him against the pursuers from Black Mountain Tribe amidst the huge clashing sounds in the air!The strongest pursuer from Black Mountain Tribe was their tribe leader. The one who fought against him was Nan Song. At that moment, a strong presence of Qi exploded from his old and frail body, as well as a shocking amount of killing intent.Su Ming\u2019s Qi rumbled in his body. All 243 veins turned into one under fine control. With astonishing speed, he threw his spear with the intent to kill towards one of the people from Black Mountain Tribe. Once his body burst apart, Su Ming closed in on his corpse like a blurred-out image. He grabbed the spear and turned around abruptly, clashing his spear with the bone knife slashing towards his back.The clash made his body tremble, and his right hand numbed for a moment as he took a step backwards. The man whose attack was blocked by his spear staggered back three steps, blood trickling down from the corner of his lips.Before the man could stabilize himself, Su Ming dashed forward and closed in on him without a care for the injuries he had sustained himself. He threw his left fist forward.The man from Black Mountain Tribe did not manage to dodge. He could only bring his bone knife upward and block the attack with the blade facing Su Ming. Yet Su Ming did not stop. He threw his left fist straight at the bone knife. Blood from his fist scattered in the air, but there was a crashing sound, and the knife shattered into thousands of fragments that flew back towards the man, because it could not handle Su Ming\u2019s strength. An aghast expression appeared on the man\u2019s face, and he coughed out blood as he quickly retreated.However, Su Ming was even faster. He closed in on the man, and just as he was about to kill the man under that intent for murder stemming from intense hate, he felt a strong sense of danger. His expression did not change, but right away he took half a step to the side. Pain erupted in his chest, as if a strong force had just landed on his back and turned into sharp needles piercing through him. Blood spilled out from the right side of his chest as a sharp arrow penetrated his body, seemingly about to pierce through him. Under that power, Su Ming\u2019s body was also forcefully pushed to the side.Yet the moment the arrow penetrated his body, Su Ming\u2019s left hand caught the half the arrow coming from the right side of his chest. With a jolt from his left hand, he neutralized the power of the arrow and forced it to remain in his body.Su Ming knew that the most grievous arrow injuries happened when the arrow went through the body completely. With that sort of destructive force, once the wound was penetrated through, a large amount of blood would be lost. Yet if the arrow remained in the body, then it could serve to block the wound, decreasing blood loss. He could then continue fighting.He turned his back abruptly and saw the Head of the Guards from Black Mountain Tribe standing in the distance, the very same person who had fled when he failed to kill the tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe in the previous battlefield. When he was about to draw his bow again, the Head of the Guards of Dark Mountain Tribe growled and closed in on him, drawing his own bow. Right then and there, in the forest, those two people who were skilled with the bow engaged in a battle to the death.Su Ming averted his gaze. The moon may have been covered by the red fog at that moment, but there were still shreds of moonlight penetrating through it. No one noticed as these rays of light fused into Su Ming\u2019s body. It was night, and night belonged to Su Ming. Still, it was a pity that the moon was covered by the red fog.He swung his left hand before him, and an invisible ray of moonlight rushed towards the man who had originally escaped death. He lurched forward, and in his muddled state, a red line appeared on his neck, and his head fell. Before it even landed on the ground, Su Ming kicked the head upwards, and as it bled, it sped towards the person fighting against Lei Chen not too far away.Lei Chen was caught in a dangerous situation. His powers were not great enough, and he was also injured. At that moment, he was fighting with the last vestiges of his strength. The person fighting against him was an ugly looking man in the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. The man gave a vicious laugh and punched Lei Chen\u2019s chest, causing blood to spill out of his mouth.He was about to tear off Lei Chen\u2019s head excitedly when there was a whistling sound, and the head, which Su Ming had infused with his Qi as he kicked it, rushed towards him quickly. The man was caught off guard. The head landed on his body and abruptly exploded, causing the man to stagger back as he coughed out blood.Lei Chen lifted his head and pounced on him. The man was thrown down and his Qi was thrown into disarray. He knew that his life hung on a line, and in his panic, he bit his tongue, shooting out a blood arrow towards Lei Chen. Yet Lei Chen knew that he could not dodge the attack. Once he missed this chance, and his opponent had the time to circulate his Qi back to normal, he would definitely die!He let the blood arrow close in on him and raised his left hand to block it. Sharp pain immediately travelled down his entire left arm, and some of the blood that splashed out landed in his right eye, turning into unimaginable pain. The vision in his right eye immediately became blurry, and black blood flowed out, but he managed to close in on the man. As the man screamed for help in terror, Lei Chen\u2019s right fist landed on his head again and again until his body blew apart.Lei Chen laughed brokenly. All he could see from his right eye now was darkness, but there was no regret in him. Even as he let out a sad laugh, he was still persistent.At that moment, he saw two Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe out of the corner of his left eye. He gave a vicious laugh, and a voice shouted in his heart, \u2018Come closer! Closer! I\u2019ll use my flesh and blood and let all of you people not be lonely in hell!\u2019Just as Lei Chen was about to make his blood veins explode, a person suddenly appeared before him in a flash. It was Su Ming!Su Ming\u2019s eyes were completely red. He wanted to save Lei Chen. His speed tore at his wound, and as blood flowed out, Su Ming waved his right hand before him. Immediately, strings of moonlight sped towards the person by Lei Chen\u2019s side who was just about to cut down Lei Chen\u2019s head. The moment the man lifted his knife, he immediately saw the madness in Lei Chen\u2019s left eye and was terrified. Just as he was about to retreat, he felt sharp pain in his entire body, and his gaze turned dark. He was torn into pieces.During the moment of the man\u2019s death, Su Ming arrived. He did not care about the other person who was also taken aback by the madness in Lei Chen\u2019s eyes, but kicked the expanding blood veins on Lei Chen\u2019s body, which were on the verge of exploding.Su Ming\u2019s level of cultivation was greater than Lei Chen\u2019s. The moment he kicked Lei Chen, the Qi in Lei Chen\u2019s body scattered due to the shock, causing his act of self-destruction to be halted. While Lei Chen was still stunned by his actions, Su Ming did not hesitate and carried him tied to his back using moonlight as ropes.\u201cSu\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk! If you want to die, we\u2019re dying together!\u201dSu Ming turned around and resumed his slaughter once again.Tears fell from Lei Chen\u2019s eyes. He looked at Su Ming\u2019s face from the side, but did not speak even after a long while. An oddly shaped horn was given to him by Su Ming himself. Once he held it tightly, he started fighting with Su Ming!Compared to battles on Su Ming\u2019s side, Nan Song\u2019s fight against the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe was even more shocking. Nan Song was fighting alone against not just the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe, but against five other people, including Bi Su, all while showing no signs of being outmatched!However, the most gruesome fight was the battle between the Heads of the Guards of Black Mountain Tribe and Dark Mountain Tribe!The sounds of arrows slicing through the air were quick and devastating. By the end, these two people shot all their arrows at once. Bei Ling\u2019s father\u2019s killing intent spilled forth. He must kill the Head of the Guards from Black Mountain Tribe. If this person remained alive, he would pose a great threat to the tribe!At the end of the battle, the legs of the Head of the Guards from Dark Mountain Tribe were crushed\u2014that was the price paid for an arrow piercing through the chest of the Head of the Guards from Black Mountain Tribe! The moment his enemy died, the Head of the Guards of Dark Mountain Tribe smiled.This battle to stall for time only went on for a few moments, yet there were still people who died. There were only six remaining Berserkers out of the nine who had rushed out from Dark Mountain Tribe. These six people continued fighting as they retreated with Nan Song leading them.Bei Ling was heavily injured. When he saw that his father had lost both his legs, he too, carried his father on his back and staggered to keep up with the team. Nonetheless, Bei Ling himself was also running dry.There were also numerous corpses lying on the ground belonging to Black Mountain Tribe. There were only nine people left among them. The tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe also sustained injuries. Blood trickled down his mouth as he looked at Nan Song. He did not expect Nan Song to be so powerful!However, they had to kill all these people as quickly as possible. Under his leadership, they continued pursuing those from Dark Mountain Tribe. Among the hunters, Bi Su\u2019s eyes flashed. He had already taken notice of Su Ming and was surprised by his power. He was familiar with Dark Mountain Tribe and knew that there was no such person among the younger generation of the tribe.He looked at Su Ming as he retreated with Lei Chen on his back. As he looked into Su Ming\u2019s eyes, a familiar feeling surged forth in his heart. The persistence in Su Ming\u2019s eyes reminded him of the mysterious person that Black Mountain Tribe could not find no matter how hard they tried!\u201cMo Su! You\u2019re Mo Su!\u201d Bi Su narrowed his eyes, and he shouted as he pointed at Su Ming.While his words did not incite much reaction from the other pursuers from Black Mountain Tribe, the instant the words left Bi Su\u2019s mouth, the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe, who had sustained injuries as he fought against Nan Song, turned abruptly his head towards Su Ming. A brilliant flash appeared in his eyes.\u201cWhoever kills him will get ten women from Dark Mountain Tribe!\u201d the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe shouted out suddenly, and the moment he did so, all the pursuers focused their gazes on Su Ming.The battle in the sky was still ongoing. As thunderous roars shook the sky and earth, and the red fog rolled in the sky like waves, a large part of the moon in the sky revealed itself.At that moment, the moon was at its brightest!The moment it appeared, a large amount of moonlight spilled onto the ground and descended on Su Ming, causing his body to recover rapidly. The moonlight surrounded his body, and at that very instant, the shadow of the blood moon appeared in his eyes! It was not a vague shadow, but was incredibly clear as it covered his entire pupil!At the same time, all five summits of Dark Mountain trembled! Within the summits, countless Wings of the Moon cried out in excitement as if preparing to madly dash out.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe moon might not have been full that night, but it was close to being so! The moment moonlight shone on the ground, an indescribable presence erupted forth from Su Ming\u2019s body.The first to sense that presence was Lei Chen. He was quickly followed by all the retreating Dark Mountain Tribe members, all of whom could clearly feel it. All the people from Black Mountain Tribe looking at Su Ming felt their hearts lurching forth. They saw the blood moon in Su Ming\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat is that..? What is that in his eyes!\u201d\u201cThe moon\u2026 It\u2019s the blood moon!\u201d\u201cThe blood moon is in his eyes!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The moon looked enchanting, causing all of those who saw it to feel their hearts tremble. At that moment, Bi Tu, who was fighting against the elder in the sky, suddenly felt agitated for a reason that he could not understand. That agitation suddenly appeared, but it was not the first time it had occurred. He remembered distinctly that he had also felt this sort of agitation and restlessness several months ago.It was as if he could no longer control his Qi, and it wanted to leave his body so as to worship something.Mo Sang, who was fighting against Bi Tu, was originally exhausted, but a glint suddenly appeared in his eyes. He noticed the change in Bi Tu\u2019s Qi and quickly took a step forward. The dark python by his side roared, using the chance to show off the might of its Berserker Art.The huge wave of blood fog tumbled violently in the sky, imitating the motion of Bi Tu moving backwards.That scene made all the people on the ground, who were already taken aback by the blood moon in Su Ming\u2019s eyes to begin with, become even more shocked by the strongest battle in the sky.\u201cRetreat!\u201dA brilliant light flashed through Nan Song\u2019s eyes. He swung his arm and led the Berserkers from Dark Mountain Tribe by his side in a quick retreat. As they fled, the nine people from Black Mountain Tribe quelled the shock they felt and no longer looked at the sky as they rapidly gave chase.Once they were thousands of feet away, Nan Song bit his tongue and coughed out a mouthful of blood. The blood turned into a gigantic arm, and it swung against the nine people from Black Mountain Tribe chasing after them.Thunderous sounds echoed in the air, and the earth trembled. The giant arm of blood shoved their pursuers from Black Mountain Tribe 500 feet backwards.\u201cI can feel it. There are still some Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe coming towards us\u2026 I\u2019ll cast a Berserker Art. Protect me and stall for time!\u201d As Nan Song spoke, he sat down on the ground cross-legged and closed his eyes. His Qi disappeared at that instant, but the blood veins on his body began to twist strangely as if about to form a picture.Bei Ling carried his father. He no longer had any strength to continue fighting. Even running was difficult for him. As for the Head of the Guards, he was forcing himself to stay awake, but judging by his looks, he would not be able to stay conscious for much longer due to the loss of his legs.Lei Chen struggled down from Su Ming\u2019s back. Compared to Bei Ling and the others, while he might also be running dry, he could still fight, and he stood beside Nan Song to guard him.At that moment, besides Su Ming, there was another man who was in his thirties who could still fight. His face was pale, and his left arm a bloody stump, but he held tightly onto a long spear with his right hand. He cast a glance at Su Ming, then with him, stood at the forefront.\u201cSu Ming!\u201d from behind Su Ming came the weak voice belonging to the Head of the Guards. \u201cI give you this bow!\u201dWhen Su Ming turned around and looked, the Head of the Guards was staring at him. He motioned for Bei Ling to take down the bow and threw the three remaining arrows towards Su Ming.\u201cFrom now on, you are the Head of the Guards of Dark Mountain Tribe! I\u2019ve seen your skills with the bow before, you\u2019re very good\u2026\u201d The Head of the Guards gave a weak smile and closed his eyes slowly. He did not die, but simply could not stay conscious anymore and fainted.Su Ming took the bow and arrows. The bow was very heavy, and there was a malicious air coming from it. There was also a lot of blood staining it. Once she held it in his hands, he silently shifted the quiver behind his back. He gave a nod to Bei Ling and turned towards the people from Black Mountain Tribe, who were blocked by the giant hand made from Nan Song\u2019s blood.Time passed by quickly. As they breathed, a horrific presence slowly built up within Nan Song. They could all tell that once he finished preparing and eventually cast the Berserker Art, the effects would be shocking.Yet at that moment, cracks appeared on that gigantic hand of blood. The nine people from Black Mountain rushed out with savage looks on their faces, charging towards Su Ming and the tribe member standing beside him.A murderous look appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He lifted the bow with his left hand, and with his right brought out an arrow from his back before drawing the bowstring. The bow echoed and the bowstring curled into the shape of a full moon. An indescribable presence erupted forth from Su Ming, and all his blood veins manifested on his body with a roar, all his power being focused on the arrow. He let go, and a sharp cry shook the air as the arrow flew.With an air of madness that spoke of certain death, the arrow sliced through the air with a piercing cry and charged forward, closing in on one of the nine people from the Black Mountain Tribe in an instant.Su Ming knew that he could not waste even a single arrow. That was why he did not shoot the arrow towards the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe, neither did he shoot it at Bi Su. Instead, he shot the arrow towards the only person from Black Mountain Tribe who was at the fifth level of the Blood Solidification Realm.The arrow flew out and abruptly turned into a dark ray of light, piercing the target\u2019s chest in the blink of an eye. His chest immediately burst apart. The man staggered back several steps with the arrow protruding from his chest, and then fell.That same moment, Su Ming brought out the second arrow and drew the bow. The remaining eight people from Black Mountain Tribe were already only 300 feet away from him. They would be able to close in on Su Ming before he could even fire the arrow.Yet at that moment, the young adult standing by his side laughed loudly and charged forward. As he got closer to the men from Black Mountain Tribe, without any hesitation, he made all his blood veins swell, and his body began letting off a blinding red light. He was going to self-destruct!He would make his body explode to hold back those from Black Mountain Tribe so that Su Ming could have as much time as he needed to draw his bow. Su Ming was silent. He would use his actions to show his grief and anger at his tribe member\u2019s sacrifice. When the second arrow shot out, he heard a bang, and knew that his tribe member had died.It was not as if the man in his thirties did not value his life. Yet if he compared his life with those of the people in the tribe, then he would choose his tribe\u2019s safety over his own. As he self-destructed and the blasting sounds echoed through the air, the eight people from Black Mountain were held back for the span of three breaths!During those three breaths, Su Ming had already fired the second arrow and once again shot through the heart of another person from Black Mountain Tribe. That person coughed out blood as his breath stilled, and he died.At the same moment the second person died, Su Ming fired the third arrow as the explosions caused by his tribe member became weaker!He did not look at who he shot when the arrow left the bow. Instead, he slung the bow across his back and charged forward without hesitation. A red light flashed on his right hand, and Blood Scales materialized in his hand.Su Ming remained silent and did not roar. He dashed forward, instead, without hesitation. Behind him was Nan Song, who was preparing a powerful Berserker Art, Lei Chen, who did not have much strength left to fight, Bei Ling, who was heavily wounded, and the Head of the Guards, who was unconscious. The only person who could fight now was him.He could not turn away. He could only move forward! His vision was becoming blurry. The arrow that had penetrated his chest was still there. He could pull it out. But once he did, his injuries would worsen. Besides, the internal injuries he sustained from before by forcefully raising his level of cultivation had begun to show its effects.He charged forward towards his destination. Including the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe, there were six people left before him! These six people all had various injuries on them, but they were still madly closing in on him.Lei Chen clenched his fists but held back because he knew that he was the last line of defence. Even if he died, he had to die there. He took a few steps forward and stood before Nan Song. As he looked at Su Ming fighting, tears fell from his eyes.\u2018Su Ming, you said before that I can\u2019t die. If I wanted to die, we\u2019ll die together..! I\u2019ll keep to that promise..!\u2019There were no loud booming sounds, as if Su Ming had become mute. Yet every single time he made a move, the ruthlessness of his actions far surpassed the viciousness that someone his age should possess. He held the long spear and fought against the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe!The tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe was a powerful Berserker at the eight level of the Blood Solidification Realm. It could even be said that he was slightly stronger than Ye Wang. He may be injured, but he was still someone whom Su Ming could not hope to oppose. The moment they engaged each other in battle, blood flowed out of the corners of Su Ming\u2019s mouth. He suffered a direct punch from the tribe leader on his person, but his body twisted oddly, and he swept the long spear in his hands sideways. His target was the savage looking person by his side.That person was a Berserker at the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. He was originally grinning viciously by the tribe leader\u2019s side. He could already imagine Su Ming\u2019s body blowing apart at the next moment, but he was not meant to see that sight. Blood Scales closed in on him with a whistle. As that person stood there, stunned, it went straight through his right eye. With a bang, he was impaled to the ground.Blood spilled out of Su Ming\u2019s body. He tumbled backwards and fell to the ground. Just as the remaining five people from Black Mountain Tribe were about to leap over the body of their dead comrade and charge towards him, Su Ming struggled up silently. He smiled brokenly and spread his arms wide open. Moonlight descended on him from the sky and turned into fine threads that surrounded his body. He flung it outwards, and those threads rushed towards the five people.A murderous look appeared in the tribe leader\u2019s eyes. He pushed Bi Su aside with his right hand, causing Bi Su to use that momentum to charge forward and rush towards Lei Chen with the intent to kill.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe tribe leader himself growled. As blood red light erupted from his body, the shape of a bloody bear about 100 feet tall appeared behind him. That was the transfiguration of his Mark of Calamity, which had yet to solidify. The moment it appeared, it let off a loud roar that shook the skies, and its body blocked the thread of moonlight that Su Ming flung out.Nonetheless, the tribe leader underestimated Su Ming\u2019s unique skill. It was an especially glaring mistake during the moon of that day. It might not be full, but it was already close. The instant the might of the moon touched the blood bear, it tore through its body, causing the bear to let out a sharp cry. Yet it only made a bright flash appear in the tribe leader\u2019s eyes. The blood bear exploded, the force created by the explosion not only caused the thread of moonlight to crumble, it also lashed through its surroundings and crashed into Su Ming, causing his body to be thrown into midair as he coughed out blood.Su Ming was beginning to fall unconscious while midair. He saw dozens of new Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe charging through the forest towards them. He saw Lei Chen standing before Nan Song, roaring as he dashed out towards his opponent \u2013 the cruel Bi Su.\u2018Is this the end..? But I\u2026 can still fight\u2026 I still have one more arrow!\u2019It was as if everything slowed down. He could no longer hear anything, but his eyes were trained onto Bi Su, who was closing in on Lei Chen. As he surrounded himself in moonlight, Su Ming grabbed the bow with his left hand and the arrow on his chest with his right hand. He pulled it out viciously, and his pain turned into killing intent. As blood poured out from his body, he notched the bloody arrow on the bow and aimed it at Bi Su. Then with a vicious might, he fired the arrow!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As it sliced through the air, moonlight wrapped around the arrow. From a distance, it did not look like an arrow, but the blood of the moon.Bi Su had just arrived before Lei Chen. His gloomy and ferocious grin was still on his face, but at that very moment, he froze. He could sense danger coming towards him, one that terrified him. That feeling of danger came too suddenly, and he did not even have time to think about it. Within an instant, the arrow arrived!However, a large amount of blood red mist suddenly appeared on Bi Su\u2019s body. The mist immediately turned into the shape of Wings of the Moon and surrounded Bi Su within it. That mist formed in the shape of the Wings of the Moon could block all attacks that were below the Awakening Realm. Bi Su knew this. Bi Tu was the one who had told him that.Yet the moment the arrow touched the mist formed in the shape of the Wings of the Moon, the mist let out a piercing screech as if it was afraid of the blood on the arrow and melted, causing the arrow to slice through it with a whistling sound and pierce through Bi Su.Bi Su felt a sharp pain in his chest and blood spilled out. The arrow penetrated through his body and landed by Lei Chen\u2019s feet.Bi Su trembled and fell to the ground. He widened his eyes and breathed rapidly like a fish out of water as he pressed both of his hands on the wound in his chest as if trying to stop the life flowing out of his body with the blood, but that arrow was not only filled with Su Ming\u2019s anger and sadness, but also all his power. It was not an injury Bi Su could block out.\u201cIm\u2026 possible\u2026 The elder said\u2026 I won\u2019t\u2026\u201dThere was an indescribable terror on Bi Su\u2019s face. He could not believe this. He could not believe that he was going to die. His body was becoming cold, and despair appeared in his eyes.He did not want to die. He was afraid of death. He was still young, not even 20 years of age. He was the prodigy of Black Mountain Tribe. He should not die like this. He wanted to become the strongest Berserker that far surpassed those in Wind Stream\u2026 He wanted to claim Bai Ling as his woman\u2026 and make that beautiful face of hers cry under him\u2026He had too many things he wanted to do\u2026 Never had he thought that he would die here, so suddenly and so out of his expectations. He did not even have time to prepare for it.He opened his eyes and fell to the ground. Above him, he saw the blood red sky, the blood moon, and Bi Tu\u2019s figure within the blood red fog.That was the last scene he saw during the short span of his life.Bi Su died!The moment he died, the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe was stunned. Disbelief and fear appeared on his face. He was not afraid of Dark Mountain, but of the Elder of Black Mountain. He knew that Bi Tu was an aloof and cruel man. His moods were unpredictable, and he did not see the people within the tribe as equals, but as slaves. The only person he ever cared for was Bi Su!Bi Tu had practically poured everything to help and guide Bi Su, now that Bi Su\u2026 died\u2026 The tribe leader\u2019s face immediately turned deathly pale.He was not the only one who was stunned. The other two people beside him were also taken aback. Their faces were immediately filled with so much terror and panic that they forgot to attack.Su Ming crashed to the ground, and more blood spilled out from his wound. Yet the pain he felt could not be seen on his face. He was smiling instead, and that smile blossomed for a certain girl.Killing Bi Su had always been Su Ming\u2019s goal. Killing him was not only to prevent him from getting near Lei Chen and Nan Song, but also because of the greed and lust in his eyes when he saw Bai Ling on the field in Wind Stream Tribe.From the patch of forest behind the tribe leader, another group of Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe appeared with a whistling sound. They were only thousands of feet away from them.Yet at that moment, a roar filled with sadness and anger travelled out of the blood fog in the sky. It was Bi Tu\u2019s voice!\u201cSu Er!\u201dThat voice sounded like thunderbolts that shook the earth. The snow on the ground exploded, causing the land to tremble continuously. As the voice appeared, a person madly charged out with a face filled with grief. In his eyes, he could only see Bi Su lying on the ground, unmoving.\u201cWho killed my Su Er? Kill them, kill all of Dark Mountain Tribe, all of them must die!\u201dBi Tu charged out with a killing intent that could shake the sky, but before he could even get close, a cold huff echoed from within the fog. With blood trickling down his lips, Mo Sang raised his right hand, and the weather changed. The dark python by his side let out a roar and dashed out, blocking Bi Tu, causing him to be unable to go down.As Bi Tu roared, the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe broke out in cold sweat and trembled as he snapped out of his stupor. Terror overcame his heart. He knew that he had to make amends, or else he would not be able to bear the Elder\u2019s fury.He no longer cared about Nan Song, but immediately turned around and trained his eyes on Su Ming lying not too far away. He quickly charged towards him. He had to kill Su Ming to redeem himself before Bi Tu and protect his own life.The other two people by his side had the same reaction and rushed towards Su Ming.Su Ming was still smiling. He looked at the three people closing in on him and knew that he had succeeded. Now, the only thing left to do was to trigger his blood veins to explode and gain a few more moments for Nan Song.Yet at that moment, Nan Song suddenly opened his eyes. His body trembled and a crack appeared at the center of his brows. A green light in the shape of a person charged out of it. Once it did so, Nan Song\u2019s face immediately paled as if he had lost his life.The light was blurry. The moment it appeared, it charged forward and appeared before Su Ming in the blink of an eye and swung its arm towards the three men from Black Mountain Tribe.A thunderous roar instantly resounded, and the tribe leader coughed out blood as he tumbled backwards. As for the other people, their bodies crumbled and they died an instant death.The moment the tribe leader gained his footing, the other dozens of Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe arrived. They were led by two men in black robes with dull eyes.\u201cYou\u2019re finally here\u2026\u201d Nan Song\u2019s voice appeared from the beam of light. It floated before Su Ming, and as it spoke, it slammed both of its hands on the ground.The moment it did so, the ground tumbled like waves in the sea. Booming sounds echoed in the air, and two large hands made of dirt shot out of the ground before they clasped together with all their enemies, including the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe, trapped within. Pained muffled cries came from within.The light turned around and raised its right hand as it looked at Su Ming before it turned into glimmers of green light that fused into his body, causing Su Ming\u2019s originally fuzzy mind to immediately become clear. A warm feeling also appeared amidst the incredible pain in his body, a sign that he was rapidly recovering.The light quickly dimmed and floated back towards Nan Song before it crawled back into his body through the crack. Once the crack healed, Nan Song opened his eyes. There was fatigue in his gaze, and his face was deathly pale.\u201cThese people are not important. The battle between the Elders is the key towards the survival of the tribe\u2026 Bi Tu has yet to cast the Fallen Berserker Art. It\u2019s incredibly strong\u2026 We must hurry, he\u2019s about to cast it!\u201dNan Song stood up and let out a low shout, then brought Lei Chen and the others to retreat quickly. Su Ming had already recovered by a large margin by then. He knew that he was saved by Nan Song, but before he could thank him, he felt a presence of death falling from the sky. The snow on the ground immediately turned black, and all the plants within the forest around them withered away.Su Ming\u2019s expression changed. He instantly increased his speed and kept up with Nan Song and the others, supporting Lei Chen and Bei Ling as they ran together towards the rest of their tribe.The patch of forest behind them instantly withered away. Black whiffs of air crawled out of those trees and sped up to the sky. The black snow on the ground continued spreading in their direction at a rapid speed as if it was chasing after them.Time passed by quickly. Very soon, when the black snow behind Su Ming and the others no longer spread out, a powerful crack of thunder came from the sky, and the sky looked as if it trembled as abruptly a presence of death spread towards both heaven and earth.Su Ming was worried about the elder, but he could not turn back. He quickly ran forward with Nan Song as he supported Lei Chen and the others. When they finally caught up with their tribe that was hurrying forward and saw that none of them were injured, that they were just as they were when they left, all of them let out a sigh of relief.When the tribe saw Su Ming and the rest returning, they felt agitation boiling within them as sadness appeared on their faces. They grieved, because nine Berserkers had left them, but only five came back.The Head of the Guards lost both his legs and was unconscious. Bei Ling was heavily injured, and blood continued trickling down the corners of his lips. Lei Chen had lost his sight in his right eye and looked completely exhausted. Nan Song may have seemed as usual, but the deathly pale look on his face showed that he was near death\u2019s door.Su Ming was covered in blood. His chest was bloody and torn. If it were not for Nan Song curing him, he would have died.Once they returned, some common doctors from the tribe immediately took the unconscious Head of the Guards into the crowd and began treating him. Once Bei Ling escorted his father back to the tribe, he fell into Chen Xin\u2019s embrace, unable to stay conscious any longer.\u201cSomeone is helping Black Mountain Tribe\u2026 We definitely have pursuers left. I sacrificed some of my life, but I could not kill all of them. I managed to trap them and buy us some time, though\u2026 We must hurry!\u201d Nan Song panted harshly and looked at the tribe leader, who was standing in front of the tribe.The tribe leader did not ask anything, there was only a resolute look on his face as he led the tribe at the fastest speed they could muster.Yet, before they managed cover a larger distance, a roar that shook the skies resounded suddenly. A large amount of ripples appeared in the sky, and a large dark python fell from the sky. There were a lot of injuries on its body, and it crashed not too far from the tribe. It struggled, as if wanting to lift its head once again, and stirred up a large amount of snow from the ground.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAn old and wizened figure fell from the sky.Su Ming could see that person clearly.It was the elder!The elder coughed out blood as his body plummeted towards the ground. Behind him was a large red Wings of the Moon that ferociously chased after him. Behind that Wings of the Moon was Bi Tu. His face was pale, and blood colored the corners of his mouth. His face was twisted with fury and murderous intent as he closed in on the elder.No one could save him now! His death was imminent!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After all, all those who lived around the region were incredibly familiar with the Wings of the Moon.Now that Bi Tu\u2019s killing intent was so strong that he defeated the elder with his powers from the Awakening Realm, who could hope to fight against him?The Wings of the Moon that was chasing after the elder was quickly closing in on him. It would catch up before the elder could fall into the light from the statue protecting the tribe.In that instant, all the tribe members from Dark Mountain Tribe became desperate, but they could do nothing. Not even their tribe leader could save the elder\u2026Nan Song slammed his hand on his forehead, and the crack at the center of his brows appeared once again. The dim green figure sped forward as if it wanted to help the elder, but the distance between them was too large. No matter how quick the green figure was, the Wings of the Moon was too close. It was already less than 30 feet away from the elder!Su Ming\u2019s head was blank. His family, the person closest to him, was now facing death, but he could do nothing. He could only look at the Wings of the Moon getting closer to the elder and open its mouth. The moment it was about to swallow the elder, Su Ming, who had remained silent, let out a shrill cry.That mournful scream contained all of his strength. His wounds were torn apart once again, and blood flowed out, but he did not notice it. Within his eyes, there was only the sight of the Wings of the Moon going in to swallow the elder.It was as if he had lost control of his own body. He madly charged forward. His shrill cries echoed in the sky and fell into the elder\u2019s ears, similarly falling into the Wings of the Moon that was about to swallow him.The shadow of the blood red moon in Su Ming\u2019s eyes seemed to burn with a similar feeling as when he was performing the burning of blood. It spread throughout his entire body once again, as if it wanted to burn all of him. As he cried out, Su Ming only had one thought in his mind \u2013 that Wings of the Moon must not injure the elder!That thought turned into a loud bang in Su Ming\u2019 head, causing his vision to turn blurry, and his eyes, nose, ears, and mouth to bleed. He felt as if he was flying and had just leapt off the ground, rushing towards the elder falling from the sky at an incredible speed, towards the Wings of the Moon that had its mouth opened to swallow the elder, and right into it!A strange sight immediately came into existence!The large Wings of the Moon trembled and began struggling. It was only for a moment before it seized moving, and a clear look appeared on its face. It looked at the elder, which was right before it, then abruptly changed its course with a flap of its wings and charged towards Bi Tu, who was situated behind it with a stunned expression on his face.The elder jolted. During that very instant that had happened just moments prior, he saw a familiar look in the eyes of the Wings of the Moon\u2026Su Ming did not know why, but he knew that he had turned into that Wings of the Moon. He turned around and charged towards Bi Tu, crashing into him, who was stunned.Bi Tu did not know how he had lost control of the Wings of the Moon that was formed from his Qi and his Berserker Art. The moment it drew close to him, a flash passed through his eyes, and he quickly retreated. He was about to dissolve the Wings of the Moon, when he discovered that his Berserker Art had no effect.The Wings of the Moon drew near and crumbled as it crashed into him, exploding into a large amount of blood that scattered all over the place. Bi Tu coughed out blood, and his body staggered backwards hundreds of feet before he regained his footing. A stunned look took over his face.The moment that Wings of the Moon exploded, Su Ming felt himself being expelled, and he fell rapidly before returning to his body. His body lurched forward, and he regained his mind.At that moment, the elder had returned safely to the tribe. Under the protection of the light of the statue of the God of Berserkers, he sat down crossed legged, brought out seven needles made of bone with his right hand, and stabbed them into his body one by one.At the same moment, Bi Tu, who was still in the sky and looked like a wreck, wiped away the blood from the corners of his mouth as he stared at the elder under the statue\u2019s protection. He might have been shocked by that strange sight, but he was in a state of mind where he no longer cared about the consequences. He had to kill Mo Sang and every single person from Dark Mountain Tribe.He plummeted towards the ground, and in the blink of an eye, closed in on them. By then, the elder had only managed to pierce three bone needles into his body.\u201cMo Sang, even if you sacrifice your life now, you\u2019re still not my opponent!\u201dThe moment Bi Tu arrived, he brought his right hand up and was about to slam it down on the floating statue when the green figure that came from the center of Nan Song\u2019s brows closed in on him.\u201cNan Song, you have learned the Verdant Berserk Chains well, but you\u2019ve not understood its true form!\u201dBi Tu laughed madly and swung his arm. A green light crawled from his arm and turned into the silhouette of a person before it charged towards the green figure created by Nan Song. The moment they crashed into each other, Nan Song\u2019s green figure crumbled. Only one single thread tumbled back and returned to Nan Song\u2019s body, which caused him to wither away until he was only skin and bones. He coughed out black blood.A roar came from the tribe. The tribe leader of Dark Mountain Tribe charged towards Bi Tu. He could not allow Bi Tu to destroy the statue of the God of Berserkers nor interrupt the elder\u2019s sacrifice.At that moment, there were five bone needles in the elder\u2019s body. His body trembled and a strong presence erupted from his body. That presence immediately caused Bi Tu to be taken aback.\u201cMove!\u201d Bi Tu no longer cared about anything else. He rushed straight towards the statue of the God of Berserkers. As for the tribe leader charging towards him, he only threw a punch at him which caused the tribe leader\u2019s body to jolt. He coughed out blood and tumbled backwards as his body began withering away like Nan Song\u2019s.Yet even though he fell back, the other people from Dark Mountain Tribe did not retreat. One of the Berserkers that had not joined Su Ming and the others to stall for time and stayed back to protect the tribe rushed forward without a care for the consequences and used his body to block Bi Tu\u2019s path. However, the moment Bi Tu swung his arm outward, that person immediately turned into bones and scattered into the air.Struggle appeared in Shan Hen\u2019s eyes. He wanted to rush out, but stopped himself and just clenched his fists.Su Ming too, charged forward. Behind him was Lei Chen. There was a small distance between them. As they ran forward, Bei Ling, who was very close to Bi Tu because he had been brought into the crowd by Chen Xin when he fell unconscious and was receiving treatment from the common doctors, woke up at some point and pushed away Chen Xin, howling, and bounded forward.However, before he could even get close, Bi Tu pointed his right finger at him, and Bei Ling\u2019s right arm instantly turned into a puddle of blood. The damage continued spreading upwards, and Bei Ling screamed as he fell down once again onto the ground.At that moment, the sixth bone needle had sunk into the elder\u2019s trembling body. As he lifted the seventh needle, Su Ming and Lei Chen started madly charging forward when they saw that they were only hundreds of feet away.Yet Bi Tu had already arrived. His right hand slammed into the statue of the God of Berserkers from Dark Mountain. The moment he struck, a brilliant light that reached to the sky erupted from the statue. Many cracks appeared on its surface, and it exploded abruptly, turning into countless shards that spread in all directions.The statue of the God of Berserkers of Dark Mountain Tribe, the symbol of Dark Mountain Tribe, shattered before the entire Dark Mountain Tribe, and as it shattered, Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s will, too, shattered\u2026The moment the statue of the God of Berserkers exploded, Bi Tu rushed towards the elder, who was piercing the seventh bone needle into his clavicle. Suddenly, a girl whose face was torn and bloodied stood up from among the crowd. It was Wu La.There was sadness and a look that said she did not want to leave these people behind in her eyes. She was the closest to the elder, and at that moment, she charged out. She stood before the elder with her life on the line with a resolute look in her eyes.Bi Tu let out a cold harrumph and swung his hand in a wide arc as he got nearer. A strong force slammed into Wu La\u2019s body, and as she coughed out blood, her body tumbled backwards in the air and fell where Su Ming was.The seventh needle had entered the elder\u2019s clavicle. If it were not for his tribe members sacrificing their lives to buy time for him, he would have never completed the sacrifice.The elder opened his eyes and let out a roar that shook the sky. That roar contained all of his fury towards the death of his tribe members and held a killing intent that seemed to pierce through the sky. He stormed out of the crowd and once again engaged Bi Tu in battle as they dashed towards the sky.Everything happened in an instant, and it happened so quickly that it was difficult for a person to imagine it.A stab of pain laced through Su Ming\u2019s right cheek. That pain came from a shard from the statue of the God of Berserkers. A red line of blood appeared, spilling out from his wound, but Su Ming felt no pain. He saw Wu La\u2019s body rapidly withering away. Before even touching the ground, she had already turned into skin and bones.Su Ming\u2019s mind was blank. He went forward and caught Wu La as she fell. Her face was already ruined. Blood continued to spill out from her lips and her withered body. She looked at Su Ming holding her and smiled.\u201cAre you Mo Su?\u201dShe struggled to lift up a hand to touch Su Ming\u2019s face, but there was no strength left within her to do so.There was sadness on her face as she whispered softly, \u201cYou\u2019re not him.\u201d She then mumbled something to herself, and the light in her eyes disappeared; they became blank. Her hand also fell to her side, swaying slowly until it finally stopped moving.At that moment, Bi Tu, who was fighting against the elder in the sky, let out a huge roar.\u201cSu Ming, take our people and go!\u201dAs Bi Tu roared, a powerful ray of light crashed into the ground from the sky. That ray of light looked like a gigantic blade of light. When it fell, it slashed into the ground before the tribe. The earth trembled, and rumbling sounds rose into the air. A huge ravine that was hundreds of feet in breadth opened up ahead of them.They could not see the end of the crack. It was as if the ravine itself separated the tribe and their pursuers from Black Mountain Tribe. A screen of light shot up into the sky from within that crack.There were no tears in Su Ming\u2019s eyes, just stillness. A deathly stillness so great it was horrifying. Lei Chen, who was standing by his side, looked as if he wanted to say something, but the moment he saw Su Ming\u2019s eyes, he swallowed his words. Su Ming made him afraid.His eyes were blank, like the void. It was as if he was dead. Yet within that void, he could see the shadow of the moon shining brilliantly.Su Ming gently placed Wu La\u2019s corpse down on the ground and picked up a shard of Dark Mountain\u2019s statue of the God of Berserkers from the ground before carefully putting it away in his bosom.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe scar on his face, which was created by the shard of the statue, looked ghastly. He did not wipe away the blood. He chose to cast his gaze on his tribe instead.\u201cMove!\u201d Su Ming only said one word. He picked up Nan Song and the dying tribe leader, passed them to Lei Chen and the others before walking towards the front of the crowd.Bei Ling did not die after losing an arm. He struggled up and looked at Su Ming\u2019s back as he stood at the front. At that moment, he felt that a change had happened in Su Ming, one that made him feel as if Su Ming had turned into a stranger.That sort of change made Bei Ling fearful. It was as if some sort of presence had just been awakened within Su Ming. A presence that should not have been roused, and one that would not have appeared under normal circumstances, but it was here now.Su Ming\u2019s face was calm, and his eyes were cold. He had learned to shoulder his pain and sadness. His footsteps were steady as he led his people forward, just like what the tribe leader had done previously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Behind him were his people, who had lost the protection of the statue of the God of Berserkers. There were\u2026 no elderly folk in the crowd.They were only halfway through, but Su Ming\u2019s footsteps only became steadier. There was simply too much blood spilled by the people of Dark Mountain Tribe, and too many spirits of their deceased Berserkers in the forest.Right now, the only Berserkers who could fight were Su Ming, Lei Chen, and Shan Hen. The tribe leader and Nan Song required the support from their people as they moved forward while continuing to receive treatment. They were anxious and wanted to recover as soon as possible.Bei Ling had lost any possibility to continue fighting. He had lost an arm, and a large amount of blood flowed out from his wounds. If it were not for Chen Xin, he would have already failed to keep up with the crowd.Shan Hen was also covered in blood. He walked silently behind the tribe. At times, he would look absent-minded, at other times, there would be a conflicted look on his face. Sometimes, an indescribable feeling would appear, and every single time it did, he would press his hand against his chest.As if there was a force that supported him to continue moving.Mo Sang and Bi Tu\u2019s battle continued in the sky, and thunderous sounds echoed continuously. Midnight came, then the sky turned bright, but the fight still continued. These two people would not stop until one of them was killed.The ravine on the ground, the screen of light that had reached the skies, and the Berserker Art that required Nan Song to sacrifice his life, all of them managed to buy a large amount of time for the tribe\u2019s migration.When daylight arrived, exhaustion overcame the people of Dark Mountain Tribe. They had traveled continuously for two days and nights in this cold weather. All of them looked as if they could no longer go on, but still, they gritted their teeth and moved at the fastest speed they could muster.The sky was bright. Sun shone on the ground and the bodies of all the people of the tribe in the forest. They felt a slight hint of warmth within them, but the cold brought by the snow on the ground still chilled their bones.\u201cWith our current speed, by tomorrow, we\u2019ll reach Wind Stream Tribe!\u201d Lei Chen said softly, traveling beside Su Ming.\u201cThere\u2019s just one more day!\u201d he clenched his fists.Su Ming remained quiet for a moment before he spoke with a hoarse voice as he continued walking forward. \u201cIt\u2019s not a whole day, but only half!\u201dLei Chen let out a sigh of relief when Su Ming finally broke his silence. He had been extremely worried about his silence.\u201cWe should be able to reach Wind Stream Tribe\u2019s territory by tonight. Once we leave the forest, it\u2019ll be much safer,\u201d Su Ming stated calmly.\u201cLet\u2019s hope today is a safe day\u2026\u201dLei Chen turned around and looked at his people. He sighed when he saw their exhausted looks before he brought his eye back to Su Ming walking in the front. His frail back gave off the feeling of a mountain.Two hours passed by. A faint and weak voice came from within the crowd. That voice traveled forward with determination.\u201cSu Ming, leave me behind.\u201dThe person who spoke was Liu Di, the Warrior who had played the xun and who had previously sustained grave injuries. He was taken away by his people, and now, when he could no longer continue onward, he did not want to become a burden to his tribe.Liu Di struggled up and smiled at Su Ming, who had stopped moving to look at him. He walked towards a tree and sat against it. His actions tore the wounds on his body, and blood spilled out once again.\u201cAll of you\u2026 go on\u2026\u201dLiu Di took out the bone xun and placed it by his mouth, as if he was about to play a song, but he no longer had any strength to do so. He did not even have the strength to look at the sky to wait for his death.Su Ming fell silent. He too, closed his eyes, but reopened them quickly. He did not speak, but cast a deep look at Liu Di before turning away and continuing to lead his people onward.As they carried on, a few more people from the tribe stayed back with smiles on their faces. They did not want to drag their tribe down. Bei Ling wanted to do the same, but when Chen Xin cried and struggled to carry him on her back, he found that he could not say those words.The Head of the Guards woke up on the way. He may have lost his legs, but he still had some strength left to fight. As a tribe member offered to carry him, he chose not to be left behind, instead he prepared himself to trigger the explosion of a Warrior at the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm for their enemies who could catch up at any time.Su Ming remained silent. He did not stop any of his people from staying back, but his fists clenched tighter every time they volunteered to stay. He knew that the elder handed Dark Mountain Tribe to him so that he could lead them to safety. He had a duty to complete this task.Once evening arrived, Su Ming slightly relaxed from his wound-up state. They had finally left that seemingly endless forest and moved into the wide plains that belonged to Wind Stream Tribe. This place was much safer than the forest. After all, the plains were part of Wind Stream\u2019s territory. It would never allow Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe to barge in without permission.Once all the people from Dark Mountain Tribe entered the plains, the tribe leader and Nan Song recovered some of their strength. It was as if all the disasters looming over their heads had come to pass.Yet, at that very moment, a tremor shook the earth. The center of the tremor came from a great distance away, and it was so powerful that they could all feel it even though it came from so far away.\u201cThe Elder\u2019s seal is broken\u2026\u201d Nan Song closed his eyes, then opened them after a moment before he spoke languidly.As the words were spoken, the people of Dark Mountain Tribe tensed up once again.\u201cWith Black Mountain Tribe\u2019s current speed, they will need some time before they can catch up\u2026 but they will still definitely catch up to us before we reach Wind Stream Tribe.\u201cIf we take the risk that Black Mountain Tribe will not dare to step into Wind Stream Plains, then we can ignore the danger hanging over our lives\u2026\u201d Nan Song whispered.\u201cWe can\u2019t take the risk.\u201dSu Ming stopped and looked at the forest cast in darkness behind him. He turned around and looked at the tribe leader, who had recovered some vestiges of his power. He stared at him whose body was now dried up and wrinkled and whose face looked gaunt and almost bloodless.\u201cTribe leader, there were a lot of people who stayed back as we came here, and I stopped no one. That was their choice\u2026 Now, it is time for me to stay.\u201dWhile speaking, Su Ming walked to the back of the crowd.The tribe leader, a man in his forties, finally looked at Su Ming properly. This La Su, whom he had never paid much attention to, had given him a great shock. He let out a faint sigh and nodded his head.\u201cI\u2019m staying too.\u201dLei Chen did not hesitate and stepped out to stand beside Su Ming.Su Ming looked at him, just as the other did the same. He grinned boyishly.\u201cYou said it before. I can\u2019t die before you. If I wanted to die, then we\u2019d be dying together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stay too.\u201dNan Song took a deep breath. The wrinkles on his old and wizened face had increased greatly during this journey. There was also a feverish dash of color on that pale countenance of his.\u201cMe too!\u201d The Head of the Guards, who had since lost both his legs, spoke in a low tone.\u201cI\u2019m staying too!\u201d Bei Ling turned his head away so that he could not see Chen Xin\u2019s tears and spoke in a firm manner.\u201cHead of the Guards, you can\u2019t stay. You still need to help the tribe leader protect our tribe\u2019s safety\u2026 Besides, once you all arrive safely in Wind Stream Tribe, you will need to teach the La Sus how to use the bow\u2026\u201dThe one who spoke was Shan Hen.This man, who had remained silent all this while, walked out from the crowd. He was never someone who talked a lot to begin with, but as he spoke, there was a determined air in his voice that would not be swayed.\u201cAs for you, Bei Ling\u2026\u201d Shan Hen walked to Bei Ling\u2019s side and a complicated look appeared on his face once again.\u201cUncle Shan Hen, I\u2026\u201d Bei Ling was just about to speak when Shan Hen lifted his right hand suddenly and slammed it on the back of Bei Ling\u2019s neck, cutting off all his words as the young man fell unconscious.\u201cYou\u2019re the future hope of the tribe. You cannot go\u2026 I\u2019ll stay,\u201d Shan Hen said calmly and walked towards Nan Song. He stood beside him and looked at all the familiar faces in the tribe. After a long while, he lowered his head.The tribe leader from Dark Mountain Tribe walked towards them in silence. He took out a bone of some creature the size of a baby\u2019s fist. That bone was white, just like any other normal bone. He handed it to Su Ming.\u201cTake it. These bones come in pairs, and they have a strange function. Once this bone turns red, it means we\u2019ve arrived safely in Wind Stream.\u201dSu Ming took it silently and placed it carefully in his bosom.The tribe leader looked at the few people who were staying back and let out a faint sigh before turning around and leading their tribe members in the direction Wind Stream Tribe.Not many normal members from Dark Mountain Tribe were lost, but everything that they went through during the journey made all of them turn back and look at the four people standing there as they walked away. They could not stop their tears from falling.No one could say who was the first person who waved, but very soon, all the tribe members waved their hands towards Su Ming and the other three Berserkers as they cried, bidding their farewells. They knew that these four people might not survive. They were about to do the same thing as their other tribe members who had sacrificed themselves. They would use their lives to build the final wall of defense to protect their tribe.\u201cBig brother Su Ming,\u201d a young voice came forth from the crowd. It belonged to the little girl called Tong Tong. She ran forward a few steps to Su Ming, and he knelt down, patting the little girl\u2019s hair, which was now slightly damp.\u201cBig brother Su Ming, once this all ends and the elder comes back, can you look for Pipi for me?\u201dA smile appeared on Su Ming\u2019s face. He kissed the girl\u2019s forehead and nodded his head.The little girl lit up with a beautiful and sweet smile. She looked at Su Ming before she suddenly leaned in and whispered in his ear, \u201cBig brother Su Ming, I have a secret. Not even my mama and papa know about it, Pipi doesn\u2019t know about it as well. You have to come back. Once you\u2019re back, I\u2019ll tell you the secret.\u201d As the little girl spoke, she bit her lip and blinked back tears before running back into the crowd.Su Ming watched as she waved at him from within the crowd and gradually disappeared into the distance with them. Only then did his smile disappear.It was quiet all around them. The moon in the sky was gradually getting clearer. That night, the moon was full\u2026 The full moon hung high in the sky. Once it blended together with the silence of the earth, it seemed to let out a murderous air.The moon was brighter than the previous nights. As the light scattered on the ground, it brought out the shadows of the four people on the plains. Their shadows stood alone, but there was resolution within them.Su Ming sat cross-legged with Lei Chen by his side. Before them was Nan Song, who had his eyes closed. As for Shan Hen, he was sitting alone nearby as he looked at the sky thinking about something.\u201cLei Chen, sit behind me. You aren\u2019t powerful enough, and you won\u2019t be able to contribute much during battle. Let me borrow your Qi. That way, I can also protect you,\u201d Nan Song slowly said.Lei Chen did not hesitate. He immediately stood up and sat behind Nan Song, cross-legged. They had no idea what method Nan Song used, but a red light appeared on both of them, surrounding them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter that, no one spoke anymore. They all waited for the arrival of their pursuers from Black Mountain Tribe.Su Ming sat quietly as he grabbed the snow on the ground with his left hand and cleaned his uninjured left hand of all dirt. Once his left hand was clean, he took out a small bottle and brought out a red pill. Then he held it in his left hand and closed his eyes.Time passed by, and after four hours, when the light from the moon in the sky was at its brightest, Su Ming, who still had his eyes closed, felt as if the Qi in his body was about to boil.\u201cThey\u2019re here!\u201d Nan Song spoke.Su Ming opened his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe leading them, they charged towards them. One of them was a man with a blank expression wearing black robe. It was clear that the screen of light, the ravine, and Nan Song\u2019s Berserker Art had a large impact on them.Fatigue was clear on their faces. They were no longer as excited as before, nor where they screaming in that odd manner. This time, in the war between the two tribes, Dark Mountain Tribe was not the only one who had suffered losses. Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe died as well, and the number of deaths on their side was greater than Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s.Their Head of the Guards died, their chief of hunters died, their vice chief of hunters died, and more importantly, their prodigy, Bi Su, had also died in battle!The vast amount of deaths of their Berserkers brought about a huge blow towards Black Mountain Tribe. If it were not for the existence of black robed men and the tribe members who had their levels of cultivation forcefully raised by Bi Tu using a Fallen Berserker Art, they would have had a hard time catching up to Dark Mountain Tribe.Black Mountain Tribe absolutely did not expect that Dark Mountain Tribe would be so hard to destroy and would make them pay such a great price. Perhaps this was something not even their Elder, Bi Tu, had expected.He was completely held back by Mo Sang. His powers in the Awakened Realm did not give him much of an upper hand in the war between the two tribes.\u2018If time went back, and we knew how this would end up, perhaps\u2026\u2019They would not immediately declare war, but would take more time to prepare themselves.Even if Black Mountain Tribe won this war, they would still suffer a devastating loss. More importantly, if Dark Mountain Tribe managed to enter Wind Stream, then all the deaths suffered by Black Mountain Tribe would be in vain. They would not get even a single trophy of war.Besides the man in black robes, all the other people from Black Mountain Tribe were regretting their decision. Yet they were already too far gone and no longer had any choices but to continue fighting. It was especially so since Bi Su died. It had become a must for the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe to kill Su Ming.As he looked at the eleven people approaching them, Su Ming\u2019s face was calm, and a cold glare appeared in his eyes as he stood up with his right hand holding tightly onto Blood Scales.Nan Song and Shan Hen looked murderous as they watched silently.Lei Chen also remained unmoving, but within his eyes, the same madness and killing intent burned.The moment these eleven people from Black Mountain Tribe came to a thousand feet away from them, Nan Song took a step forward, and the red light from his body blasted into the sky. There was still a line connecting him with Lei Chen behind him. The blood red light on Lei Chen\u2019s body became stronger, as if it turned into a screen of blood that protected him.With a low growl, Nan Song\u2019s shirt exploded. His old face suddenly turned younger, and the muscles on his arms bulged up. Growling, he slammed his hands onto the ground.The moment he did so, a giant vortex immediately appeared underneath the feet of the eleven people charging forward. The vortex was filled with mud, and a hand made of mud shot up and caught their legs.Nan Song charged forward. Behind him, with the fastest speed he could muster, Su Ming too, dashed forward. Shan Hen\u2019s eyes were filled with killing intent and conflict as he raised his right hand. A bone knife in the shape of a crescent moon instantly materialized in his hand. He rushed forward like an evil spirit.At that moment, Lei Chen\u2019s body was trembling, and his face began to turn older, as if his life was being sucked away.The mud on the ground held back half of the people from Black Mountain Tribe, but it did nothing to the man in black robes. That person stomped on the ground with his right foot, and as most of the mud immediately exploded, he charged towards Nan Song.The battle began.Su Ming still maintained his silence. He didn\u2019t pay any attention to the man in black robes, nor did he choose to fight against the tribe leader from Black Mountain. He charged towards the remaining nine people instead.The highest level among the nine people was only the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm. Most of them were around the sixth level. As long as Shan Hen kept the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe occupied and gave Su Ming enough time, then with his speed, Su Ming could kill all nine of them.Shan Hen moved oddly as he closed in on his enemy. His target was the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe. As these two people clashed with each other, thunderous roars reverberated through the air, and they crossed swords with each other.Su Ming\u2019s speed was extremely quick as he ignored the pain in his body. Under the pale light from the sky, he felt as if his entire body was enveloped in moonlight. The shadow of the blood red moon appeared clearly in his eyes. In the blink of an eye, he closed in on one person and brought his spear up. The moment he clashed weapons with that person, another wound appeared on his body, but that person\u2019s head flew into the sky, and blood scattered all over the place.Su Ming fell to the ground, breathing rapidly, but he did not stop. He charged forward with moonlight surrounding him. It melted into his body, causing it to continuously heal even while in his current condition. As he dashed forward, five of the eight remaining people from Black Mountain Tribe closed in on him. The other three bypassed the defenders quickly and looked as if they were about to leave the battlefield. They were going to continue chasing after the tribe in the plains.When they saw the three people breaking off and charging into the distance, the five other Berserkers from Black Mountain Tribe quickly closed in on Su Ming. He did not hesitate and leaped into the air, but did not throw the long spear in his hand. Even if he did throw it towards the three people running in the distance, he could only kill one person. That was why Su Ming chose to throw the spear to the ground underneath him.Blood-red light appeared from the long spear, turning into a giant blood-red eagle that sped down to the earth. With a crash, it landed on the ground under Su Ming, stirring up a huge wave of air and force, which caused the five men closing in to flinch.Su Ming used the impact caused when he threw Blood Scales away to charge towards the three people who run around him and were now running into the distance.As all 243 veins gave off a red light on his body, he shot forward like a red meteor and closed in on the three people rushing away. These three people were not any normal Berserkers either. There was not a hint of hesitation between them. One of them immediately stayed back to block him while the other two flashed with a blood-red light and ran even faster. The presence of their Qi under the crimson light showed that they had both reached the peak of the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm.The person who blocked him also used some sort of method to hide his level of cultivation which was why Su Ming had not noticed his power due to their previous contact being very short. Yet as the blood-red light on the person\u2019s body glowed brightly, the might of Qi from a Warrior at the seventh level of the Blood Solidification Realm erupted forth. The madness on his face spoke of his determination to hold Su Ming back.At that moment, the blood veins on his body swelled up at a rapid speed as if he was about to trigger the explosion of his blood veins!They were at the same level, so if he self-destructed with Su Ming in close proximity, his fatigue and the injuries on his body would make him unable to fend against it. Yet if he retreated, then he would have to watch the other two people disappear from his sight, and disaster would fall upon his migrating tribe.When the person who blocked Su Ming\u2019s path chose to self-destruct, the wounds that already existed on his body tore open, and he started bleeding.\u201cYou\u2019re not the only ones who know how to self-destruct. Those of us from Black Mountain Tribe can do the same!\u201d the man roared and laughed viciously at Su Ming as he charged forward.A glint appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He did not retreat, but instead quickened his pace. The moment he approached the man, and the blood veins on the man\u2019s body were about to explode, Su Ming opened his left hand, which had been held tightly in a fist, and swung it towards the wounds on the man\u2019s body.A dash of red powder flew forward and fell onto the man\u2019s wounds in the blink of an eye. The man jolted and widened his eyes. The blood veins in his body were in a state where he was at the verge of self-destruction, but his blood started burning suddenly, and as he passed by Su Ming, his entire body turned into red mist and rose into the air.That sight fell into the eyes of the two people who were charging forward and the people who were running to catch up to Su Ming. They felt the hairs on their skin rise.\u201cFallen Berserker!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a Fallen Berserker!\u201dA cry of surprise rang through the battlefield, one that caught Nan Song and Shan Hen\u2019s immediate attention. The tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe, who was fighting against Shan Hen, too, changed his expression and an aghast look appeared on his face.Even the man in black robes, whose face remained blank, was stunned when he saw that sight. Yet very soon, a strong glint of light appeared in his eyes, as if he had discovered something.However, during the short moment he was taken aback while fighting against Nan Song, a chance appeared for Nan Song.Thunderous sounds rang abruptly. Su Ming did not stop. He charged towards the two people ahead of him who remained stunned by his actions. These two people gritted their teeth and immediately split up, but at that moment, Su Ming coughed out a mouthful of blood, which turned into blood mist instantly and dashed towards the person who ran to the left.The blood mist contained the powerful might of Su Ming\u2019s Qi. He had just cast Dark Blood Dust. At the same moment, he sped towards the right and started fighting against the Black Mountain Tribe Warrior who had run to the right.After a while, a few more wounds appeared on Su Ming\u2019s body. He panted harshly as blood red light enveloped his entire body; the blood red moon shone brilliantly in his eyes. He turned to where the people were fighting and rushed back.Behind him, two unmoving corpses lay in two different directions, their bodies torn apart.There were only seven people left from Black Mountain Tribe on the battlefield!Besides the man in black robes and the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe, the other five people were all deeply shaken by Su Ming\u2019s killing intent and the previous scene which made them think that he was a Fallen Berserker. They looked at each other, and a rare desire to fall back appeared in their eyes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, Shan Hen, who was fighting against the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe, coughed out blood and tumbled backwards. He had been gravely wounded by the tribe leader, and his body was flung aside towards where Nan Song was. There was a murderous look on the tribe leader\u2019s face as the blood bear materialized behind his back. It let out a roar and pursued Shan Hen, swinging its giant paws, which were formed by the blood mist, to deliver the killing blow on Shan Hen.When he saw that the blood bear\u2019s paws were about to land on Shan Hen, Nan Song\u2019s expression changed. He was the closest to Shan Hen at that moment. Without any hesitation, he leaped into the air and pulled Shan Hen as he punched the blood bear\u2019s paws. With a bang, Nan Song staggered backward.\u201cGo back and heal. Let me deal with this person\u2026\u201dNan Song was talking quickly, but he suddenly jolted, and blood trickled down the corners of his lips. His body started withering away at a rapid speed. As a mournful look appeared on his face, Nan Song slammed his palm into Shan Hen.The moment Nan Song saved Shan Hen, the latter lowered his head, and with the curved blade in his right hand, sliced apart the blood line connecting Nan Song and Lei Chen using some unknown method. The moment the blood line was severed, he also managed to thrust his blade into Nan Song.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Blood trickled down the corners of his mouth. On his face was conflict and pained regret. He lowered his head, as if he could not face Nan Song.All this happened too quickly. In the blink of an eye, the tables were turned. Su Ming stared at Shan Hen and smiled brokenly.Shan Hen\u2019s face was pale as blood continued flowing out of his mouth. Suddenly, he lifted his head and shouted towards the sky. His scream was desolate. He turned away in a swift motion and charged into the forest, no longer looking at Nan Song and Su Ming. In a heartbeat, he made it into the forest. As he continued crying out in agony, Shan Hen disappeared among the trees.At the same time, the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe let out a vicious grin, as if he had expected this a long time ago.He charged towards Nan Song, and the man in black, who had been fighting against Nan Song, also threw his fist at him despite the injuries on his body.There was grief on Nan Song\u2019s bloodless face. His body was so withered that he looked like a skeleton. The blade in the shape of the crescent moon had sunk deep into his back, and the wound bled continuously.The moment the tribe leader from Black Mountain Tribe and the man in black robes closed in on him, Nan Song let out a loud bark of laughter. That laughter contained grief, and his entire body lurched forward. Immediately, a long crack appeared at the center of his brows. A dim green figure charged out of the crack and rushed towards his enemies.The moment it got closer to the man in black robes and the tribe leader, the green figure exploded, creating a shocking force that stirred up everything around them. The man in black robes was already injured to begin with and could not bear the pain brought by the impact. His weak eyes immediately shattered, and he moved back, screaming.The tribe leader did not expect Nan Song to be able to do such a thing while so gravely wounded. He also knew that the curved blade buried deeply in his body contained a type of venom that would make blood coagulate. It could prevent powerful Berserkers from triggering their blood veins to explode, that was why he had dared to close in on Nan Song in the first place.That blade was prepared for Dark Mountain Tribe\u2019s Elder by Black Mountain Tribe, but an unexpected situation happened, and they ended up using it on Nan Song instead.The tribe leader coughed out blood. He had been chasing after them the whole way, and he could no longer suppress the injuries on his body. As he coughed out blood, his breathing gradually weakened. When he landed on the ground, he fell back hundreds of feet, an aghast look on his face.The moment the green figure exploded, a brilliant gleam appeared in Nan Song\u2019s eyes as he stood there, looking as if all his injuries were cured. He took a step forward and appeared before the wounded and retreating man in black robes, hurling a fist at his chest before the other could even think of dodging.With a bang, the man in black robes shuddered, and his chest was torn apart. His eyes became dull, and he died in an instant.Nan Song did not stop. He turned his eyes towards the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe, who was not too far away from him. He had a calm demeanor as he charged at him. A look of terror appeared on the tribe leader\u2019s face, and he quickly retreated, screaming.Once he got closer to the other five people from Black Mountain Tribe, he grabbed one of his tribe members without hesitation, and inserting some sort of power into the man, he threw him towards the approaching Nan Song.That man from Black Mountain Tribe let out a horrible scream, but it was drowned out as his body suddenly exploded, causing a large amount of blood mist to scatter around them.With terror and panic in his veins, the tribe leader growled, \u201cRetreat!\u201dUnder the protection of the other four members of Black Mountain Tribe, the tribe leader and the other four people ran towards the forest without caring for anything else. They were absolutely terrified. Nan Song\u2019s strength threw them into disbelief.The tribe leader believed his life to be important. He could not stay there. He also knew that the next wave of reinforcements from Black Mountain were on their way. Once they met up with that batch of people, they would be safe.\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it!\u201dNan Song did not even spare a glance at the Black Mountain Tribe member who had self-destructed. He swung his right hand, and the blood mist that appeared due to the explosion dispersed. Once he landed, he slammed both of his hands onto the ground.The earth underneath the five people immediately started shaking. A giant hand of mud shot out of the ground and sped towards them, seeking to grab the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe. The tribe leader sank into desperation and pushed another of his tribe members nearby to avoid his own death. His courage seemed to have completely disappeared. He did not turn his back and rushed into the forest, fleeing rapidly.\u201cBegone, all you scoundrels who\u2019ve lost the pride of Black Mountain Tribe!\u201dNan Song did not chase after them. He stood there, instead, and shouted towards the forest.All this happened in the span of a few breaths. Su Ming approached quickly and saw Nan Song standing there, his body swiftly weakening at a speed noticeable with a naked eye while the people from Black Mountain Tribe escaped.\u201cThe tribe should be safe\u2026 the next wave of people from Black Mountain Tribe won\u2019t arrive so soon. Too many of their Berserkers died, they\u2019re beginning to think about withdrawing.\u201dNan Song continued standing there. The crack in the center of his brows began to let out a gray light.\u201cI\u2019ve fulfilled my promise to your elder\u2026 and I\u2019ve repaid his debt for saving my life\u2026\u201dNan Song looked at Su Ming and a smile appeared on his face.\u201cGrandpa Nan Song\u2026\u201d Su Ming whispered.\u201cEven if Shan Hen did not injure me, I would not have lasted long. I wanted to use the Verdant Berserk Chains to heal all of you and return the life I took from Lei Chen before I died, but I can\u2019t do it now.\u201dNan Song let out a light sigh and lifted his head to look at the sky. The sky in the distance was still covered by the red fog, and thunderous booming sounds came from within. He knew that Mo Sang was still fighting and hanging on.\u201cIf you see Shan Hen\u2026 ask him why for me.\u201dNan Song placed his hands behind his back and closed his eyes. He stood there unmoving, as if his body had taken root. Before him was the dark forest. Behind him were the footsteps left behind by the people of Dark Mountain Tribe as they left the place.His shadow lengthened, illuminated by the moonlight\u2026 A great wave of sadness washed over Su Ming. He looked at Nan Song, who had lost all signs of life. He did not touch his body, but chose to take a few steps back and kneel down before bowing his head to the ground three times.\u201cSu Ming\u2026\u201d Lei Chen struggled up and went to Su Ming\u2019s side. He too, knelt down. There was sadness on his face.The young man no longer looked like a teenager but old, as if he was in his forties.After a long while, a gentle breeze blew past them and swept the snow on the ground, lifting Nan Song\u2019s hair, which still made him look imposing even after his death, and moved Su Ming and Lei Chen\u2019s hearts.\u201cThe tribe should be safe now\u2026 Lei Chen, go back.\u201dSu Ming stood up without a sound. His eyes were cold as he looked at the dark forest lying before him.Lei Chen touched his right eye. That eye of his was completely blind now. He fell into a thoughtful silence for a while before he shook his head.\u201cI\u2019m not going back.\u201cI\u2019m going to search for ways to make myself stronger\u2026 Only when I\u2019m powerful will I not suffer, only then can I protect my home and the members of my tribe.\u201cI heard that there is another tribe on the other side of the plains and over the mountains. That tribe is located very far away, but it\u2019s much stronger than Wind Stream\u2026 I\u2019m going to go there, and no matter what price I have to pay, I will become stronger!\u201cEven if I have to become a Fallen Berserker, I\u2019ll do it!\u201dDetermination appeared on Lei Chen\u2019s face. There was also a hint of madness, but that madness was hidden deep in his eyes. He did not show it on his face.\u201cSu Ming, you\u2019re different from me. Once you return to Wind Stream, you\u2019ll have much better room for growth. But we\u2019re brothers\u2026 we\u2019ll forever be brothers\u2026 wait for me. Once I become a powerful Berserker, I will return!\u201d Lei Chen mumbled with eyes closed.He stepped forward and hugged Su Ming. They embraced without saying a word. After a long while, Lei Chen let out a huge bark of laughter and turned around, showing his back to Su Ming, which now held hints of age, and walked away into the distance, to his dreams and the place he was determined to reach. He walked forward until he completely disappeared from Su Ming\u2019s sight.Su Ming looked at Lei Chen. He did not try to persuade him otherwise, but chose to send him off, not knowing whether he would see his friend ever again. He was no longer certain of the future.After a long while, he shook his head, and his uncertainty was replaced by a cold, murderous look under the full moon. Su Ming looked at the forest, which was hidden by the darkness, and took a deep breath.\u2018Now, it\u2019s my turn to chase after you!\u2018Shan Hen as well\u2026\u2019Su Ming turned his head and looked in the direction where Wind Stream was located. Somewhere hidden in the distance, his people were moving towards the tribe. Perhaps Bai Ling was also in Wind Stream.The promise\u2026Su Ming closed his eyes bitterly. When he opened them once again, there was a frightening calmness within them. He bounded forward, and moonlight surrounded his body. Underneath the full moon, Su Ming was like the shadow of death. He charged into the forest and began his pursuit.Without anyone chasing after them, his tribe members would arrive safely in Wind Stream City. Of this, Su Ming was certain. He also knew that there was no longer any need for him to do anything for his tribe in their migration.He had already done everything he could. As of then, he had something more important to do. Su Ming could still remember distinctly the vague thought that surfaced in his head as the familiar sensation roused within him when the Elder of Black Mountain Tribe appeared before them.That idea had bloomed when he saw the elder being chased by the gigantic Wings of the Moon. During that instant, when Su Ming felt that he flew and had turned into the Wings of the Moon, changing course and charging towards the Elder of Black Mountain Tribe, the vague idea became clear in his head.\u2018Fire Berserker Art\u2026 I\u2019m practicing the Fire Berserker Art, and since the Wings of the Moon came from the people of Fire Berserker Tribe, then I can suppress their powers! Now that I\u2019ve completed the third burning of blood, it\u2019s as if there\u2019s a fire flowing in my veins as well, that\u2019s why\u2026 I should be able to help the elder!\u2019Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe shadow of the red moon shone brilliantly in Su Ming\u2019s calm eyes. They looked enchanting in the dark night.His body moved like a wisp of smoke as he ran through the forest.\u2018But before that, I\u2019m going to make Black Mountain Tribe suffer! I\u2019ll make them feel the pain of losing their tribe members\u2026 The tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe is now heavily wounded, and the other three people are of no danger to me\u2026 Then there\u2019s Shan Hen as well!\u2019Su Ming clenched his fists and lowered his head as he disappeared into the forest.From the role of the pursued, he now changed into the pursuer. From prey, he had become the hunter. Without realizing it himself, Su Ming had changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Besides assisting the elder with the Blood Moon Fire Berserker Art, he had also given thought and weighed the consequences of chasing down the people from Black Mountain Tribe and killing them.He had deduced that the tribe leader was heavily wounded and had lost his will to fight. The other three people with him were the same. However, that tribe leader was not any normal Berserker. Besides being Bi Tu\u2019s trusted aide and possessing incredible power, his intelligence was also a reason why he managed to become tribe leader.Nan Song may be able to scare them away for a while, but that man might be able to snap back soon. When that time came, the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe would have two choices. One, he could wait for reinforcements and give chase once more, or two, he could not wait for reinforcements, but choose to recover his Qi before pursuing them again.\u2018From his actions after Bi Su died, he\u2019ll choose the second option!\u2019A brilliant flash flickered in his eyes. As he moved forward, he would check all traces around him occasionally. The messy footprints and broken twigs might throw other people off track, but for Su Ming, who made trips into the forest regularly since he was young, these tracks provided all the information he needed to tell where the four people from Black Mountain Tribe went.The footprints on the snow may be messy, but most of them were pointed towards Su Ming\u2019s direction. Only some traveled into the forest before him. The depths of the tracks also provided him a lot of information.\u2018Shan Hen\u2026 leaked the information of our whereabouts which allowed Black Mountain Tribe to set the trap, but he also joined in the fight against Black Mountain Tribe. The injuries on his body didn\u2019t seem fake\u2026 In fact, to make it seem like he was one of us, the injuries he sustained during his fight with the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe were also real.\u2018That is the only way he could deceive Grandpa Nan Song, but that person suffered a direct hit from Grandpa Nan Song, he should be barely hanging on as well.\u2018But Shan Hen, why did you betray Dark Mountain Tribe..?\u2019Hatred and pain appeared in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. He could not understand why Shan Hen would turn traitor.Su Ming still remembered the things Shan Hen had done for the tribe, of how he gave his food to the elderly folk in the tribe, and how he hunted beast fangs in the forest due to a word from the young La Sus. As the children cheered in joy, he would still maintain a cold and indifferent face, but the kindness in his eyes could not be hidden away.Su Ming could not understand why and for what reason such a person would betray Dark Mountain Tribe and its tribe members.\u2018Perhaps he was also conflicted, and he struggled. He killed a lot of people from Black Mountain Tribe on the way here. He even made Bei Ling and the Head of the Guards leave with the tribe earlier. But what is he thinking..?\u2019Su Ming clenched his fists tightly.\u2018Still, these cannot amend his crime for betraying us. He\u2026 must pay the price of being a traitor!\u2019His eyes were freezing cold. He hated Black Mountain Tribe, but now, he hated the traitor Shan Hen even more!Su Ming moved like a ghost as he continued chasing after his targets with the tracks on the ground. With each breath he took, he became even faster. From the footprints on the ground and the marks around him, Su Ming was certain that the four people from Black Mountain Tribe were not far away.Their footprints sank deeper as he continued on as well, which was a sign that the injuries sustained by these four people became worse.\u2018They\u2019ll look for a safe place to recover\u2026\u2019Su Ming stopped and lowered his head. He stared at the melted snow caused by a drop of blood in the middle of a footprint in the snow and pressed against it. A cold smirk appeared on his lips.\u2018The blood hasn\u2019t frozen\u2026 They\u2019re right in front!\u2019Su Ming got up and was about to chase after them when he faltered. Sadness appeared on his otherwise stoic face.Not too far away, he saw a member of his tribe who had chosen to stay back so that he would not drag down the tribe\u2019s pace. That tribe member of his was dead. He lay there curled up, and his body was stiff.Su Ming took a few steps forward and looked at the familiar face before him. The tribe member still had his eyes open, not closing them before the end. If his body had not fallen, then before his death, he must have been looking at where the tribe left, praying to the gods to protect his tribe so that they could arrive safely at Wind Stream.This was the first deceased tribe member Su Ming encountered once he returned to the forest. He knew that this would not be the last. During their migration, many tribe members chose to stay on this path. They did not want their injuries to affect the tribe\u2019s speed.\u201cThe tribe will be safe\u2026\u201d Su Ming whispered. He looked at the tribe member\u2019s eyes and covered them with his right hand gently. The grief and sadness on his face was already hidden away. He stood up with an intense killing intent and dashed onward.Su Ming moved at a speed that was difficult for the eyes to see. Anyone looking would only see a blood red arc moving around in a curved line and rushing while twisting into various shapes.That blood red arc came from the light of the blood red moon in Su Ming\u2019s eyes. It was formed by the reflection of the full moon in the sky! As he moved forward, threads of moonlight descended from the sky and wrapped around him, turning into circles of moonlight. They formed into numerous threads that trailed behind Su Ming as he ran, making it seem like he was wearing a cloak made of moonlight.Time passed by, and after the time it takes for half an incense stick to burn\u00b9, Su Ming saw the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe sitting cross-legged on a snow patch with lots of dried branches around him nearly a thousand feet away from him. His other three tribe members surrounded him and focused on recovering quickly with their eyes closed.They stopped just now when their tribe leader told them to as his mood continued changing. He glared in the direction where Wind Stream Tribe was located, and anger appeared on his face.He had just realized that Nan Song was just pretending to be mysteriously unaffected, just like an ill person miraculously getting better. In truth, if they had just persevered for a little longer and did not run away as pathetically as they had done, they could have turned the tide and destroyed Dark Mountain Tribe!He was angry, but he also hated himself for being afraid. Still, he was a cautious man. Although he understood it, he still chose to sit down and heal his wounds first. By his predictions, even with their fastest speed, Dark Mountain Tribe would only arrive at Wind Stream by tomorrow morning. If all four of them pursued them with all their might, they would catch up to them in two hours.He was also certain that the four of them would not encounter any dangers. In his experience, prey only knew how to run for their lives.He did not think that there would be anyone in Dark Mountain Tribe who would turn back and chase after them. The entire Dark Mountain Tribe only cared about migration at this point!Yet when the four of them sat down for less than the time required for half an incense stick to burn, a cold gust appeared, and the snow on the ground fell on them lifted by the wind. At the same moment, a red light appeared in the forest not too far away from them, approaching them at an unimaginable speed. They did not even have time to react to it. Only the tribe leader of Black Mountain Tribe managed to open his eyes on time upon sensing that presence.He only saw a flash of red light appearing for a brief moment. A sharp and mournful cry came by his ear, and the tribe member on his side lost his head while still sitting down cross-legged. His blood shot into the sky like a spring.A presence that made the tribe leader\u2019s skin crawl and his hairs rise appeared abruptly. His expression changed, and he stood up, shock and disbelief clear in his eyes. The other two people stood up swiftly, terrified, as they surveyed their surroundings.\u201cWho is it!\u201d\u201cWho is it? I already saw you! Come out!\u201dThe two people immediately shouted, shaking. What had happened just now was too quick. They did not even have time to open their eyes, and they already heard the pained screams. When they eventually opened their eyes, they saw the beheaded neck of their tribe member spraying out blood.An indescribable terror crashed into them like a tidal wave. The roots of that terror was not only in the death of their comrade, but also the fear of the unknown.They did not see even the shadow of a person around them. There was only dead silence surrounding them, not even a single sound could be heard.The tribe leader\u2019s face was pale. He cast his eyes around the dark forest continuously, and his fear grew. It was as if a terrifying beast was hiding within the dark forest, and it had its eyes fixed on them.\u201cRetreat!\u201dThe tribe leader gritted his teeth. He did not dare to take risks with the unknown. Besides, the red glare he saw just now before it disappeared gave him the impression that they were not dealing with a person, but some sort of red snake.The moment the command was given, his other two tribe members quickly got closer to him. The three of them gradually fell back after taking a few steps backward, then immediately broke off into a run and swiftly retreated.They did not notice that Su Ming was crouching down in the bushes. The shadow of the blood red moon wavered in his eyes. In his hands, he held a bloody head, one which still had its eyes closed.\u2018Death is not terrifying. The thing that is terrifying is the moment before death. My people experienced this fear on their way to Wind Stream Tribe. They were tortured by this fear\u2026 Now, I\u2019ll let you experience it.\u2019Su Ming\u2019s expression was calm. Besides this goal, he also wanted his tribe members to be completely safe. Once the three of them ran away, he disappeared with a swift move.The tribe leader\u2019s heart pounded against his chest. He was gravely wounded. Although he was at the eighth level of the Blood Solidification Realm, with his current condition, he could only use half of his power and couldn\u2019t reach his full strength. The two tribe members by his side were only around the sixth level of the Blood Solidification Realm. They were pretty much useless in terms of providing protection to him.That feeling grew especially so during that instant when he saw the red light flashing by. The danger he felt made his heart race. He no longer had any thoughts to chase after the crowd from Dark Mountain Tribe. He had to flee and meet up with the reinforcements from Black Mountain.As they ran, the two people by his side were filled with alarm. Their fear towards the unknown made them lose all will to fight. They only had one thought \u2013 to run.Yet at that moment, an odd piercing screech suddenly came from their backs. That screech sounded sad and shrill, making their hearts, which were already strung up with anxiety and fear, jolt.When the weird cry echoed behind them, a blood red arc closed in on them so quickly and suddenly that the three of them only saw a red flash and the numerous threads of moonlight behind that red glow. After a while, one of the people from Black Mountain Tribe let out a scream of pain, and his head left his body, falling to the ground with blood gushing out.Translator\u2019s note:More in-depth ancient Chinese time measurement system.There are 12 months in a year, 5 weeks in a month, 6 days a week, 12 hours per day (and 1 hour of the ancient Chinese hour system is 2 hours in the modern clock), 4 quarters in an hour, each quarter is equivalent to 3 cups of tea, 1 cup of tea is equal to 2 incense sticks, 1 incense stick is divided to 5 parts, 1 part is equal to 6 snaps of fingers, 1 snap of a finger is equal to 10 instances, 1 instance is equal to 1 second.In modern standards, there are now 8 quarters to an hour, and each quarter is equivalent to 15 minutes.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI could have just converted to the modern time measurement system, just like I did with hours, but seconds and minutes did not exist back then, and it\u2019ll be weird if I added that.Anyway, when ancient Chinese literature speak about 1 incense stick or 1 cup of tea, they\u2019re actually talking about 1 quarter, which is about 15 minutes. I\u2019m using \u2018about\u2019, because the time taken for each incense stick to burn down is different, same with the time taken to drink tea.ANYWAY, half an incense stick is about 7 minutes and 30 seconds.\u2026Yup.Oh, source of this measurement: Tieba Baidu, not Wikipedia.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
