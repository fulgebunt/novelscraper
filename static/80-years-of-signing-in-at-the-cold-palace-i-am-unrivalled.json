Each wore serious looks on their faces while pleading with His Majesty to dethrone the Crown Prince.The Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty sat on the throne.He looked at the confused crown prince whose cultivation had been wiped out and said coldly, \u201cApproved. Remove Lin Jiufeng\u2019s title of the Crown Prince and banish him to the Cold Palace. Without an imperial decree, he is not allowed to leave!\u201d8\u2026A cold rebuke echoed in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s ears. In a daze, he opened his eyes to find that he had been escorted to the door of the Cold Palace.\u201cI\u2019ve been transmigrated!\u201d5\u201cI\u2019m the Crown Prince of the Xuanhuang Great World, Yuhua God Dynasty, Lin Jiufeng!\u201d6\u201cThree days ago, the Crown Prince was banished to the Cold Palace for secretly releasing the demonic girl from an enemy country. The public was outraged. The trial is today, and I transmigrated here today.\u201d4Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly.2He transmigrated and became a crown prince in a world where cultivators reigned powerfully.1With his standing in this world, he should\u2019ve been able to effortlessly soar to the sky.But who would\u2019ve thought that he would be banished to the Cold Palace, and his title as the crown prince would be taken away from him in a blink of an eye?Great sorrow and great joy truly were companions.4In this world, he was deposed and banished to the Cold Palace. All these meant that Lin Jiufeng would not be able to change his fate in this life.The palace in front of him had crumbling courtyard walls, exposed red bricks, and weeds sprouting from the base of the wall. No one bothered clearing them.The two stone lions at the entrances had broken claws and teeth.5The place looked desolate along with Lin Jiufeng\u2019s bleak figure.Not far away, the imperial guard commander sighed. \u201cA crown prince ended up in such a situation just because of a demonic girl. It\u2019s sad and lamentable.\u201d5\u201cThat demonic girl is said to be the holy maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty. She was born with a vision and was extremely beautiful according to rumors. The top echelons of the various demonic sects and the daoist sects all wanted to marry her. It is understandable that our prince would be captivated,\u201d The deputy commander said.3\u201cThat may be the case. But he should have been next on the throne, running the court and ruling the people. Not staying in the Cold Palace.\u201d The imperial guard commander said.\u201cThat\u2019s true. The Crown Prince is gentle and courteous. He is extremely talented. With his royal bloodline, he has a promising future. It\u2019s just a pity that he is in this situation now.\u201d The deputy commander shook his head and lamented.\u201cYou saw what happened to all the people that were sent to this cold palace in the past.\u201dThe imperial guard commander sighed.\u201cYes, this cold palace is infamous.\u201d The deputy commander could still remember the story of this place.1Three years ago, Imperial Consort Jia was banished to this cold palace after having interfered with politics. Three months later, she became thin and emaciated. After constantly crying out loudly about injustice, she died.3Ten years ago, the third prince was dissatisfied with the crown prince position falling into the hands of Lin Jiufeng. He launched a coup with several major families and was sent to the Cold Palace. In less than six months, he cried until he died.13Thirty years later, His Majesty succeeded to the throne and placed his three brothers into the Cold Palace to suffer for five years. They died of depression.21This cold palace had witnessed the losers of the royal struggle of the Yuhua God Dynasty, each of whom did not live long.Now, Lin Jiufeng was banished to the Cold Palace.His future would probably not be good either.Lin Jiufeng listened to the conversation between the commander and the deputy commander.He lifted his head to look at the huge Cold Palace.\u201cIs that how I will end up in the future?\u201d Lin Jiufeng was unwilling.[Sign-in in front of the Cold Palace?]A line of words suddenly appeared before Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.His pupils shrank, but he was pleasantly surprised.A cheat!5Although late, but better than never.6\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng immediately responded.[You have Signed-in in front of the Cold Palace. Received Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill!]5Another line of words appeared before him, and a complete supreme sword skill came to his mind.\u201cCan I sign in indefinitely?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked, surprised.[You can sign-in once a day. Signing in at different places produces different rewards. The more dangerous the place, the greater the reward.]10[Some places can only be signed-in once. Some places can be repeatedly signed-in. But the rewards will gradually decrease.]9The explanatory words kept appearing in front of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.His eyes were bright and clear, and the worry and fear in his heart instantly disappeared.\u201cThis is an extremely frightening world. Although I\u2019m the Crown Prince, my cultivation was wiped out in the big prison. Thankfully, I am able to sign-in silently in this cold palace.\u201d5\u201cThe most powerful of cultivators can bring down a country on their own. Some could tear the skies apart with their sword and pave their way to nirvana, and some could knock on the gates to nirvana with their sword\u2026\u201d5\u201cI am now rejected by millions. In that case, I might as well sign-in here quietly until I am invincible, before going outside.\u201d10As Lin Jiufeng thought about his life going forward, his expression became indifferent.He turned to the imperial guard commander and said, \u201cI\u2019m going in now, you may return.\u201dThe imperial guard commander asked, dumbfounded, \u201cYou\u2019re actually going in on your own accord?\u201dIn front of the Cold Palace, regardless of who it was, they would cry and wail and refuse to go in. In the end, the guards would have to carry them in.5Who would take the initiative to enter like Lin Jiufeng?Lin Jiufeng laughed and asked, \u201cIf I stall for time, can I not go in?\u201dNow that he had no cultivation and was disliked by the court and commoners of the Yuhua God Dynasty. No matter how big this world was, the only place he could go was this cold palace.The imperial guard commander was speechless.1He could only cup his fist and say, \u201cI will take my leave after you have gone inside.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter to Lin Jiufeng.He straightened his clothes and crown, then he pushed open the dusty door.6Creak!This door had not been opened for a long time.3Dust came falling down as the door was being pushed open.When it was opened, the courtyard was overgrown with weeds.The snakes, insects, and rodents were startled by sudden disturbance.8The state of the courtyard was indescribably bad.\u201cAlthough this cold palace is very big, and was quite highly ranked in the imperial capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty. There is not a single servant or maid here. It\u2019s no wonder that everyone who was sent here became crazy and died before long,\u201d Lin Jiufeng lamented.6If he didn\u2019t receive the ability to [Sign-In], he wasn\u2019t sure how long he could have lasted in this place. But now, with his mind at peace, he felt that these trivial details weren\u2019t that important.2But now, with his mind at peace, he felt that these were not important.7He stepped into the Cold Palace, and closed its door calmly under the gazes of the imperial guard and deputy commander.Boom!2The sound of the Cold Palace\u2019s door closing was dull and loud.Once closed, it would be difficult to open this door in the future.6The imperial guard commander spoke up, \u201cLet\u2019s go. It will be hard for the dethroned prince to get out from here in his lifetime.\u201d\u201cI will arrange for someone to deliver his meals. After all, he\u2019s the first person to walk in on his own accord, and a dethroned prince at that. His personality is also good anyway, so he has to eat well every day,\u201d The deputy commander said to the commander.2\u201cYou can make the necessary arrangements. It won\u2019t affect anyone anyway.\u201dThe commander shook his head, and led his men to return.The deputy commander saw a powerful young man, who was full of grandeur, in the team. It has not been a long time since he had been selected into the team. Knowing this, the former shouted, \u201cFrom now on, you will provide meals for the dethroned prince.\u201d\u201cThree meals a day.\u201d\u201cThe food has to be good, understand?\u201dThe newbie in the team was very honest.He nodded as he agreed. \u201cI will take good care of the dethroned prince.\u201d8Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Cold Palace had been abandoned for a long time.The last time anyone was here was three years ago.There were cobwebs and weeds everywhere, and the air smelled of decay.Entering an inner room, he saw a few tables, chairs, and benches that had been bored through by the worms. They were already in a state of decay. The place certainly was in bad shape.5But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t care about this. He found a relatively clean step and sat down. Closing his eyes, he began to check out the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill mentally.After signing in, the full version of the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill appeared in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind.The first step of the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill was to wipe out one\u2019s existing cultivation to form a Sword Body.15\u201cMy cultivation has been wiped out. This is just right for practicing the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes lit up and he meditated cross-legged, which was the first step in practicing the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.9Sword Body!It would be very difficult for ordinary people to cultivate the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill. However, for Lin Jiufeng, it was something he got when he signed in.It was very easy for him to cultivate it. He had no difficulties at all.2He spent the first day cultivating the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill after entering the Cold Palace, directly breaking through Foundation Establishment and creating a sword body in his dantian [1. energy center of the body].8My predecessor was a prince who had cultivated since childhood. He had countless resources, but it still took him three months to reach Foundation Establishment for the very first step of cultivation. The skill I got from signing in is really easy to comprehend.8Lin Jiufeng thought to himself in delight.Upon the arrival of the night, moonlight cascaded upon the ground like a waterfall.Lin Jiufeng wanted to continue the momentum of his cultivation akin to striking the iron while it was hot.But someone knocked on the door of Cold Palace, shouting, \u201cYour Royal Highness Jiufeng, I brought you food.\u201dLin Jiufeng had no choice but to stop cultivating. Since his cultivation had been wiped out, the Imperial Guards knew that they had to arrange food to be delivered to him. After all, they weren\u2019t allowed to let him starve to death.But they had no idea that Lin Jiufeng had already rebuilt his cultivation foundation after just a single day. With his current cultivation, he could live for ten or more days without any sustenance at all.7Walking to the door of the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng saw a small hole blocked by a stone.The person outside said, \u201cYour Royal Highness Jiufeng. Move this stone away, and I will pass you the food.\u201dLin Jiufeng did as he asked.A hot meal with meat and vegetables was passed through the hole.Lin Jiufeng was taken aback. \u201cI get to have such good food?\u201dThe person outside the door laughed. \u201cAlthough you have been dethroned, you are still the prince. The commander has ordered me to arrange better food for you.\u201dLin Jiufeng smiled. \u201cThank your commander for me!\u201dThe person outside said, \u201cHave your meal. I will come again tomorrow. Three meals a day, I promise not to be late.\u201dLin Jiufeng wanted to tell him that he did not need to send food, but the person outside the door had already left.1Lin Jiufeng had no choice but to eat his first meal since arriving in this world.4After eating, he continued in his cultivation, not wanting to delay for even a moment.The initial steps of cultivation were Qi Training and Foundation Establishment.It was only after the completion of Qi Training, and after Foundation Establishment could he move on to becoming an Acquired cultivator, Innate cultivator, Golden Core cultivator, Grandmaster, Great Grandmaster, Martial Sage, and finally Human God.20Innate cultivators were able to take on 10,000 enemies, Golden Core cultivators could suppress an army that was a million strong, Grandmasters could suppress a city, and Great Grandmasters could go up against an entire country.9As for Martial Sages, each of them was an existence with unimaginable power.Human Gods were even more powerful.7Lin Jiufeng was only in the realm of Qi Training and Foundation Establishment.4He was still too weak. He had to continue working hard.Practice silently, sign-in silently, do not create trouble or any waves, and develop steadily\u20264Anyway, I\u2019m alone now and have been removed from the position of Crown Prince. I can stay here peacefully and just continuously sign in.Lin Jiufeng thought silently.On his first night in the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng meditated cross-legged all night, increasing his cultivation realm substantially.There were nine levels for Qi Training and fifteen levels for Foundation Establishment.11Lin Jiufeng reached the third level of Foundation Establishment overnight.1He had no difficulties cultivating the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill that he received from signing in at all.2Early in the next morning, Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes and the first thing he did was to sign-in.[Do you want to Sign-In before the steps inside the Cold Palace?]2\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said without hesitation.[Sign-In successful. Received one Essence Cleansing Pill!][Sign-In can be repeated here until the sign-in effect disappears.]12The next two lines of words that appeared one after another made Lin Jiufeng happy.\u201cEssence Cleansing Pill, this is a good thing. Only a master of alchemy can refine it. It costs a few thousand silver in Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d A pure white pill suddenly appeared in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s hand, and he swallowed it immediately.3\u201cIt just so happens that my cultivation was wiped out, and my body needs to be cleansed.\u201d9Lin Jiufeng immediately began to cultivate.Two hours later, when the sun rose, Lin Jiufeng had completely digested the Essence Cleansing Pill. His cultivation rocketed to the fifth level of Foundation Establishment.He wanted to continue cultivating, but the morning food delivery person came.When Lin Jiufeng took the delivered food, he said, \u201cFrom now on, it\u2019s enough to deliver it once every seven days. You don\u2019t have to come so frequently.\u201d1Don\u2019t you know you are disturbing my cultivation?\u201cWon\u2019t Your Highness be hungry like this?\u201d asked the honest imperial guard outside the door.\u201cI\u2019m cultivating to rebuild my foundation, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied honestly.5He was not lying.After his cultivation was wiped out, it was not out of the ordinary for him to cultivate and rebuild his foundation.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll come back in seven days and bring something delicious for you, Your Highness.\u201d The honest imperial guard agreed.10Satisfied, Lin Jiufeng ate his breakfast and continued to cultivate.He can sign-in in peace for seven days and cultivate during that seven days, before eating another delicious meal.Such a quiet and beautiful routine was perfect for Lin Jiufeng.\u2026After delivering breakfast, the honest imperial guard went back to report to his deputy commander.\u201cHis Royal Highness said that it would be enough to send food every seven days in the future. He\u2019s cultivating to rebuild his foundation and doesn\u2019t want to be disturbed.\u201dThe deputy commander shook his head and said, \u201cEven if his Royal Highness is a well-known genius in the dynasty, he can\u2019t defy the heavens and rise again after his cultivation was wiped out. He can at most enter the ranks of Acquired cultivators. Forget it, let him be. Just send him food every seven days in the future.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d The honest imperial guard cupped his fists and accepted the order.1\u2026After he was dethroned and banished to the Cold Palace, the tumultuous incident came to an end. No one mentioned the prince who was once a peerless genius again.1The entire Yuhua God Dynasty began to compete for the new title of Crown Prince.No one cared about Lin Jiufeng who was in the Cold Palace.1Of course, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t need them to care.He continued to cultivate quietly and Signed-In regularly.For seven days in a row, Lin Jiufeng signed in on this step.6He sat cross-legged here every day without going anywhere else.Seven days later, Lin Jiufeng broke through and entered the ranks of Acquired cultivators.This was the highest realm that Lin Jiufeng could possibly reach according to the deputy imperial guard commander.After Lin Jiufeng broke through, the honest Imperial Guard once again came to deliver food.Lin Jiufeng moved the stone away and took the delivered food.There was even wine and meat, the meal sure was extravagant and good.1Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cMy name is Dachun. That\u2019s what everyone calls me.\u201d Honest Dachun replied.7\u201cOkay, see you in seven days.\u201d Lin Jiufeng was in a good mood and laughed as he spoke.When Dachun heard Lin Jiufeng\u2019s laughter, he asked curiously, \u201cYour Highness is in a good mood.\u201d\u201cWell, I remembered something to be happy about,\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied.He picked up the dish of wine and meat, sat on the steps, and began to enjoy the meal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can\u2019t keep staying outside,\u201d Lin Jiufeng muttered.3Without hesitation, Lin Jiufeng cleaned up the courtyard near the gate of the Cold Palace.The ground was densely covered with weeds.Using a branch as a sword, Lin Jiufeng drew his sword and began chopping!Clang!In an instant, sword energy proliferated.Sharp sword energies erupted and directly uprooted the weeds.3Vines and poisonous snakes were also wiped out under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword energy.5After all the work, the room was finally cleaned up. Lin Jiufeng let out a long breath.2\u201cFinally a proper place to live in.\u201d Lin Jiufeng sighed.If nothing happened, he would have to stay here for a long time.It would be nice to create a quiet environment for himself.After cleaning the courtyard, Lin Jiufeng found a well.The well that was previously covered and hidden by weeds could now be seen.This well was covered with a well cap and was sealed tightly.Lin Jiufeng walked over, but a line of words appeared in front of his eyes.[Sign-in at ominous well?]13Lin Jiufeng was shocked. Ominous well?What does that mean?\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng still agreed. He hadn\u2019t signed-in for the day yet.[Signed in successfully. Received Magic Treasure: Demon Slaying Sword!]6In the very next moment, a purple longsword appeared in front of Lin Jiufeng.Although the longsword was sealed in the scabbard with its blade covered, the chilling cold air it emanated still struck Lin Jiufeng, giving him the chills.\u201cJust in time. It just so happens that my Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill has also entered the next stage and I need to practice using the sword.\u201d Lin Jiufeng took the Demon Slaying Sword and injected True Qi into it.10Zing zing zing!2The Demon Slaying Sword trembled and emanated a joyful sound that reverberated in the area.Then, it transformed into a stream of light that entered Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body.Lin Jiufeng could clearly feel that the Demon Slaying Sword was powerful and had a special damage bonus against evil demons.After he was done signing in, Lin Jiufeng looked at the sealed well.\u201cWhat\u2019s in the well?\u201d Lin Jiufeng opened the well cap but found nothing.The water was clear and had few impurities.4Not being able to find anything, Lin Jiufeng fetched some water to wash.3Then, he cultivated in the room.The well was then covered by Lin Jiufeng.\u2026Three years passed in a flash.17For three years, Lin Jiufeng had been signing in quietly inside the Cold Palace.Stuck in the Cold Palace and unable to leave, he continued to sign-in inside his small courtyard.[Signed-in under the tree in the Cold Palace. Received Spring Pill Sutra!][Signed-in on the bed in the cold palace. Received 30 sets of dust-free suits!]9[Signed-in at the north gate of the Cold Palace. Received Sword Twenty-two!]11[Signed-in at the Cold Palace courtyard. Received the Glorious Dream of Spring and Autumn technique!]2Lin Jiufeng repeatedly signed-in on the steps for the Essence Cleansing Pills. Before he exhausted the sign-in effect, he received hundreds of Essence Cleansing Pills. Most of them were eaten by Lin Jiufeng who was now a powerful cultivator at an extremely high realm.10However, he still had no intention of leaving.In these three years, he only moved around his small courtyard, which was at most a few hundred meters in size.1The Cold Palace was huge and there were places that Lin Jiufeng had yet to visit.5But he had plans of exploring the other parts of the Cold Palace.In the past three years, Lin Jiufeng did not take the initiative to inquire about the outside world.He had no idea about the current situation of the Yuhua God Dynasty.1The person he met the most was Dachun.1Dachun chatted with Lin Jiufeng every time he came.2And this was the only time Lin Jiufeng spoke.But he didn\u2019t feel lonely.8Instead, Lin Jiufeng was content to see himself getting stronger and improving every day.In particular, Dachun told him a few days ago that the world outside was turbulent.1The 18 sects of demonic cultivation had made their existence known, and powerful factions from overseas had started invading.Evil was running amok and several martial Grandmasters had already perished in battle.1Hearing that, Lin Jiufeng immediately said that he would not go out.2He would stay quietly in the Cold Palace, sign in, cultivate, and become stronger.\u2026On this day, Dachun came to deliver the meal again.Lin Jiufeng was enjoying his wine, listening to the honest Dachun\u2019s words.Some were useful news, but most were insignificant matters.Once, Lin Jiufeng asked Dachun why he talked to him about those insignificant matters.Da Chun replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no one in the Cold Palace to talk to Your Royal Highness, Your Royal Highness must be very bored. If I talk to Your Royal Highness every time I come to deliver food, Your Royal Highness might become happier\u2026\u201d10Lin Jiufeng smiled warmly. He did not stop Dachun from telling him about these small matters.This time, when Dachun finished talking, he suddenly said, \u201cYour Royal Highness, Your Majesty has announced the new Crown Prince today.\u201d1Lin Jiufeng was stunned. He asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201dHe began to recall in his memory.Was it Second Brother? Third Brother? Or Forth Brother?4Dachun replied, \u201cIt\u2019s the Sixth Prince. He defeated the other princes and became the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cSixth Brother!\u201d Lin Jiufeng was really shocked.The Sixth Prince and Lin Jiufeng were born to the same consort. He was five years younger than Lin Jiufeng and was talented and as outstanding as Lin Jiufeng since he was a kid.4The difference was that when Lin Jiufeng was being trained to become a Crown Prince, the sixth prince was taken away by the royal family\u2019s clan experts.The sixth prince was very close to Lin Jiufeng before he turned five years old.But after he was taken away he didn\u2019t see him again.He never expected to hear of his name from Dachun.\u201cIt\u2019s the Sixth Prince. I heard that the sixth prince returned to the imperial capital half a year ago.\u201d\u201cHis cultivation is at the Innate Cultivator Realm\u2026\u201d2\u201cAn Innate cultivator before twenty.\u201d\u201cEveryone said that he will become the next Great Grandmaster. Now that he\u2019s the crown prince, he\u2019s a source of great pressure on the other princes,\u201d Da Chun said.2An Innate cultivator before he turned twenty\u2026 Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.Not bad.It wasn\u2019t just \u2018not bad\u2019.Dachun asked cautiously, \u201cYour Royal Highness, are you upset?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m okay. You may not know, but the sixth prince is my real brother. Why would I be upset?\u201d Lin Jiufeng smiled.12He was now living a wonderful life every day, why would he care about the crown prince position?Being the Crown Prince was stressful. He would have no time for cultivation, and he also had a great responsibility to handle. It was unlike Lin Jiufeng\u2019s current lifestyle.1\u201cYour Royal Highness, I should take my leave. I will talk to you again next time.\u201d Dachun stood up and said goodbye.Lin Jiufeng passed the empty plates to him and looked at the huge Cold Palace.\u201cLet\u2019s sign in at a different place today.\u201d Lin Jiufeng got up and walked towards another compound area.The Cold Palace was huge. It had three layers inside and three layers outside.It had a lot of courtyards, not just one.4Lin Jiufeng spent the last three years just outside in a small courtyard near the gate.2Today, he was heading inside.As he stepped onto the threshold of the first enclosure, a line appeared in front of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.[Do you want to Sign-In at the threshold of the inner wall of the Cold Palace?]1\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.[Sign in successful. Received The Core Condensing Pill!][Sign-In can be repeated here until the sign-in effect disappears.]Lin Jiufeng smiled. \u201cWhat a pleasant surprise. It knows that I am already a Golden Core cultivator and it gave me a Core Condensing Pill.\u201d21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCore Condensing Pills were made especially for Golden Core cultivators. It was much more expensive than the Essence Cleansing Pill. The Essence Cleansing Pill could be purchased for a few thousand silvers, but the Core Condensing Pill could not be bought with silver alone.4Each pill was extremely valuable.But since Lin Jiufeng could repeatedly Sign-In to this location, he would never lack Core Condensing Pills in the future.\u2018I just broke through the Innate cultivator realm and entered the Golden Core cultivator realm. I thought my cultivation would slow down a bit, but it seems that I can still continue to improve rapidly.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng thought happily.6Lin Jiufeng swallowed the Core Condensing Pill and let its energy explode in his body.The energy rushed into his dantian, increasing his strength.In his dantian was a powerful sword energy formed from the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill and the Sword Twenty-Two which Lin Jiufeng cultivated.10These two techniques were both very powerful sword skills. Together with the Glorious Dream of Spring and Autumn technique that he received from signing in, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s current combat power had reached its peak.Even the original owner of this body of his, which was the crown prince, only managed to reach the pinnacle of the Innate Cultivator Realm. There was even an entire country supporting him, yet it still took him more than 20 years to achieve such a realm.Lin Jiufeng who spent all his time quietly signing in within the Cold Palace, had surpassed the realm of the original owner of his body in just three years.2Getting his cultivation wiped out back then didn\u2019t feel that bad anymore.It was Lin Jiufeng\u2019s first time venturing into the interior of the Cold Palace. Passing through the inner wall, he saw a vast garden, a rockery, and a stream of water. There was a pavilion and a bamboo forest in the far distance.1The scenery here was once pleasant. There once existed a group of exquisite palaces, built according to the First Prince\u2019s specifications. But then the First Prince failed to seize the throne and was banished here. He ultimately died of depression.3Since then, it was gradually left to deteriorate and became the infamous Cold Palace within the palace.The once lush garden was now completely overgrown. Weeds and trees grew disorderly and vines entangled the house. It looked more like a gloomy haunted house in the wild mountains than a palace.Lin Jiufeng put his hands behind his back and looked at all of these with a calm expression. This was the Cold Palace that everyone was afraid of, but it was also the place where he could repeatedly sign in.What once was a road was overgrown with weeds.Lin Jiufeng narrowed his eyes and lifted a finger. Using it as a sword, he slashed at the weeds.The first stance of Sword Twenty-Two!2Boom!The entire garden was instantly filled with dancing sword energies.It exterminated all the surrounding weeds, revealing a path.Lin Jiufeng wandered around.He then accidentally discovered that there was also a large well that was tightly covered by a well cap within this place.Although it wasn\u2019t that of a big well that there was a well in this place, the important detail was that the well was exactly the same as the one in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s courtyard.1The colors and design were exactly the same.\u2018The well in my yard is an ominous well, is this one the same?\u2019 Lin Jiufeng wondered.However, he had already signed in for today, so he had to wait for the Sign-In the next day.After strolling around in the garden, Lin Jiufeng left in the evening.The sky had dimmed, and he returned to his yard.Then, he meditated and started cultivating.Before cultivating, Lin Jiufeng looked at the old well in the courtyard.In the past three years, he had not opened that well again.2But tonight, for some reason, Lin Jiufeng suddenly wanted to open the well.Upon opening the well cap, the water inside was as clear and as clean as always.1\u2026In the wee hours of the night, Lin Jiufeng meditated cross-legged.The Demon Slaying Sword hovered, spinning in circles around him.He was done cultivating the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill, as well as the Sword Twenty-Two. At this moment, Lin Jiufeng was trying to get to know the Demon Slaying Sword.The moon was dim that night.Dark clouds filled the sky and gusts of cold wind blew in the quiet cold palace.A cloud of black smoke was floating up out of the uncovered well at this moment.It morphed into a woman.7\u201cWhy did you imprison me in the Cold Palace?!\u201d With a mournful wail, the woman rushed directly into the room and began attacking Lin Jiufeng.1Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes at that instant, grabbed the Demon Slaying Sword, and immediately activated the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.Slash!An extremely terrifying sword light exploded, directly lighting up the yard, and instantly nailing the woman who had morphed out of the black smoke to the wall.1The surging sword aura of the extremely powerful Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill firmly suppressed the black smoke. The woman\u2019s expression looked malicious and she struggled hard, but it was useless and futile.Lin Jiufeng walked out of the room and saw the woman\u2019s face.He said in surprise, \u201cImperial Consort Jia?\u201dThis woman was none other than the former master of the Cold Palace. She was Imperial Consort Jia, who had been banished to the Cold Palace three years ago.9She was banished on charges of political activity within the palace and causing trouble to the court.Thinking that she was favored by the king, she disregarded the queen and disrespected her position. She helped push her younger brother up in the ranks with pillow talk, which offended a lot of people.Then, she was banished to the Cold Palace.Only about three months after being imprisoned, she could no longer tolerate the conditions and died.Lin Jiufeng looked at her non-substantial body and repulsive appearance.No reason existed within her, only hatred.\u201cImperial Consort Jia wasn\u2019t a powerful person, how could her soul still remain three years after her death without dissipating?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked in surprise.3He looked at the well.It was uncovered.Lin Jiufeng looked at Imperial Consort Jia Gui who had already lost her intelligence and reason.She was merely struggling numbly, her face filled with hatred.Lin Jiufeng contemplated silently.[Do you want to Sign-In before the Vengeful Soul?]2A line of words suddenly appeared before Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.He couldn\u2019t help but look up. \u201cSeems like it\u2019s already the dawn of the next day.\u201d\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said decisively.[Signed-in successfully. Received the Eye of Judgment. It can read the memory of a soul and exorcise it.]11Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes suddenly became inundated with intense pain and itch. Something seemed to be coming out of it.1He gritted his teeth and braced himself.Fortunately, after a minute, the sensations disappeared.He opened his eyes and looked at Imperial Consort Jia.Imperial Consort Jia\u2019s soul was immediately seen through by Lin Jiufeng.Boom!All of Imperial Consort Jia\u2019s memories from when she was alive, as well as how she became a wandering soul were all made known to Lin Jiufeng.6\u201cThe area deep underground beneath the Cold Palace is actually an area with extremely strong negative energy. It\u2019s easy for evil spirits to form at places like this.\u201d1Lin Jiufeng finally understood why no one paid any interest in such a big palace after the First Prince\u2019s fall from grace.It turned out that it was because of the bad geomancy here.3This palace was probably built after the First Prince had been deceived. Otherwise, who would build a palace in a place where there was extreme negative energy?\u201cThose that came here after the palace was abandoned were all tortured to death by the land itself. A prime example of this was Imperial Consort Jia, she only managed to persist for three months before dying. Her soul was then absorbed by this land of extreme negative energies\u2026\u201d1\u201cHer soul didn\u2019t dissipate, but since she was not versed in the ways of soul cultivation. She ended up in her current situation. In addition, she was muddled, and her entire being was filled with thoughts of revenge.\u201d\u201cShe hid in this well, and as long as it wasn\u2019t covered, she would be able to come out.\u201d Lin Jiufeng murmured.1He suddenly smiled. He just learned from the memory of Imperial Consort Jia that she had wanted to come out three years ago. But that night after Lin Jiufeng washed up, he sealed the well once more. Hence, she didn\u2019t manage to come out.After that, Lin Jiufeng did not open the well for three years.2She had waited for three painful years.1If Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t notice the well whom he had forgotten for three whole years, he wouldn\u2019t have opened it, and she would\u2019ve had to continue her wait.But Lin Jiufeng unsealed the well once more, so she took advantage of that opportunity to take her revenge for what the former had done three years ago.Unfortunately, the current Lin Jiufeng was vastly different from who he was back then.She was nailed to the wall of the courtyard by a beam of sword energy.3The powerful force even made the wall expand outward with her at the center of it.The wall was then covered with scars from the crisscrossing sword energies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After browsing through her memories, he chose to restore her memory. He did not want to let her be trapped in this place that was full of negative energy and continue being in such a wretched state.3When the Eye of Judgment awakened imperial Consort Jia\u2019s memory, her resentment slowly faded.She looked at the Cold Palace with a complex expression.\u201cYou\u2019re the crown prince\u2026 Have you also been banished into the Cold Palace?\u201dImperial Consort Jia recognized Lin Jiufeng and said in surprise.Lin Jiufeng nodded calmly.\u201cIt\u2019s sad, the imperial family has no affection for anyone. No matter how important anything is, it is not as important as the throne.\u201d Imperial Consort Jia sneered.She looked at Lin Jiufeng, her expression part sympathetic and part ridicule.\u201cI thought your position was stable and that you would become the next king. I didn\u2019t expect that you would follow in my footsteps in the end and be banished to this terrible cold palace.\u201dFor reasons unknown, Imperial Consort Jia was perversely happy.1Seeing Lin Jiufeng, the once aloof prince, the prince with unlimited prospects, end up like her, she couldn\u2019t help but want to laugh.However, Lin Jiufeng said calmly, \u201cI think it\u2019s not bad here. There\u2019s no disturbance from the outside world. You, however, it\u2019s time for you to be on your way.\u201d\u201cLet me stay. I can cultivate a spiritual body\u2026\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t fully awake and didn\u2019t know how to cultivate before, but now I can cultivate a spiritual body and remain here to serve you. You will be lonely here alone if I leave.\u201d4Imperial Consort Jia didn\u2019t want to leave just yet.She started to seduce Lin Jiufeng.\u201cI have many skills\u2026\u201d imperial Consort Jia started.6Boom!But Lin Jiufeng immediately pulled out the Demon Slaying Sword.The brilliant sword gleam flashed and exorcised imperial Consort Jia in one stroke.7Biological Exorcism!7\u201cI wanted to use the Eye of Judgment to exorcise you, but I don\u2019t need it anymore.\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head.Imperial Consort Jia looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise. She asked, puzzled, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel lonely all by yourself in this cold palace?\u201d1Lin Jiufeng looked at her gradually disappearing figure and shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not lonely. I find new happiness every day. You won\u2019t understand it anyway.\u201d5This was a place of extremely negative energy, and there could also be something hidden underground. This was a perfect place for him to continuously sign in. Lin Jiufeng wouldn\u2019t be lonely.1Imperial Consort Jia would never be able to understand Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words.4She slowly disappeared before Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.Subsequently, the well was also covered by Lin Jiufeng.Looking at the wall that had been ravaged by his sword, Lin Jiufeng raised his hand and advised himself, \u201cI have to be gentler next time I attack. I can\u2019t destroy this yard, I still want to continue living here.\u201dHe had no plans to change places for the time being.\u2026When everything was over, the sun had also appeared. The eerie and terrifying aura brought by the soul the night before disappeared under the sun\u2019s rays.It was a new day.Lin Jiufeng changed into a dust-free suit.This was the one he got when he signed in.1It prevented dust from coming into contact with his body and it made sure that his body was clean and pristine.1Furthermore, it looked good on him.Lin Jiufeng had been wearing dust-free suits for the past three years and he had never once bathed since then.22The new dust-free suit was white.With Lin Jiufeng\u2019s handsome face, he really looked like a dashing young man.3Dressed like this, Lin Jiufeng seemed out of place in contrast to his surroundings.He appeared to be an exiled immortal from the heavens, and all around him were filth.1As his cultivation level increased, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s bearing also became completely apparent.After ten years as a prince, how could he not have cultivated his bearing?4Today, Lin Jiufeng planned to go to the inner courtyard again.However, when he walked out of his small courtyard, he saw the main door of the Cold Palace that had not moved for three years slowly open.Lin Jiufeng stood still and looked over.The main door of the Cold Palace would not be opened unless someone was being banished into this place.No one who had entered the Cold Palace in history managed to leave.\u201cWho got banished to the Cold Palace?\u201d Lin Jiufeng was puzzled.Unexpectedly, the person who entered the Cold Palace was not someone that had been sentenced to be banished.It was the Sixth Prince who had just inherited the position of the crown prince.He was Lin Jiufeng\u2019s younger brother in this life.When he was five years old, he was taken away to cultivate, and the two were separated.It was until now that they finally got to meet each other again.Lin Jiufeng recalled the Sixth Prince from his memory and compared him to the Sixth Prince of today.The change truly was great.Back then, the Sixth Prince was just a snotty kid. But now that he had grown up, he became as tall as Lin Jiufeng. He was full of vigor, and his eyes were strong and confident.\u201cBig Brother!\u201dStanding near the main door of the Cold Palace, the current crown prince yelled cordially.Whenever he was with other princes that were older than him, he would always call them, \u201cRoyal Brother\u201d.With Lin Jiufeng, he always addressed him simply as \u201cBig Brother\u201d.After all, they had the same mother.Although it has been ten years since they met, blood was nevertheless thicker than water.11Lin Jiufeng smiled. A sense of intimacy spontaneously rose within his heart.1Perhaps this was something that came from being of the same bloodline.9But Lin Jiufeng was bewildered by the sudden visit.He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to visit Big Brother.\u201d The current crown prince walked in. He looked around and said in surprise. \u201cI heard that there are overgrown weeds in the Cold Palace, but it\u2019s so clean here. Did Big Brother clean it up?\u201d1Lin Jiufeng nodded and said, \u201cIt happened to be convenient.\u201dAfter he had achieved success in his sword skill training, he only needed to move his fingers and the sword aura would make quick work of all the weeds.\u201cBig Brother has worked hard.\u201d Unexpectedly, the prince sighed forlornly.Lin Jiufeng knew that his brother had misunderstood.But he didn\u2019t know how to explain the situation, so he changed the subject.\u201cVisitors are not allowed at the Cold Palace, why have you come? You will get impeached.\u201dLin Jiufeng was worried.\u201cBig Brother, I begged Father to let me come to see you. Our mother has gone and the closest person to me in this world is Big Brother, so Father agreed to let me visit you,\u201d The Sixth Prince said.1Lin Jiufeng smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m doing pretty well. You see it too, everything is fine.\u201d\u201cI knew Big Brother would not wallow in self-pity. Although the Cold Palace is terrifying, Big Brother will definitely persevere.\u201d The Sixth Prince truly admired Lin Jiufeng.Having stayed in the Cold Palace for three years, not only he didn\u2019t go crazy, but he seemed to be living very well. This sure was an incredible achievement.\u201cI haven\u2019t congratulated you, yet. You are now the crown prince, and the next step for you is to become the Emperor of Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201dLin Jiufeng smiled as he accepted his brother\u2019s expression of brotherhood.\u201cBig Brother, you don\u2019t blame me?\u201d The Sixth Prince looked at Lin Jiufeng worriedly.\u201cWhy would I? I was dethroned as crown prince due to my own carelessness and mistake. Big brother will only be happy for you. The fact that you were able to rise to that position is due to your own ability,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said sincerely while shaking his head.\u201cBig Brother, don\u2019t worry. You must persevere. When I succeed to the throne, I will definitely pardon Big Brother,\u201d The Sixth Prince whispered.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.If he wanted to leave the Cold Palace now, he could have done it easily.The key was that he was able to get a lot of things from signing in within the Cold Palace.5He didn\u2019t want to go out before he had the power to crush everyone.But he could not possibly tell the crown prince about this.Seeing his steadfast look, Lin Jiufeng continued to change the subject. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s discuss the future in the future. Father is in his prime, you should learn from him. Don\u2019t make mistakes like Big Brother.\u201d2Lin Jiufeng treated the crown prince as his brother, so he gave him some advice.\u201cI know. I\u2019m relieved to see that Big Brother is okay\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot for me to do. I made time to visit you, but I have to report to Father now, so I\u2019ll make a move first,\u201d The Sixth Prince said.\u201cGo.\u201d Lin Jiufeng nodded and watched him leave.\u201cBig Brother, wait for me. You will get out.\u201d The Sixth Prince walked a few steps, then turned back to hug him and said firmly into Lin Jiufeng\u2019s ear.7Then, he left without looking back.Lin Jiufeng never had a chance to explain.\u201cI don\u2019t want to go out yet,\u201d Lin Jiufeng muttered helplessly.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Big Brother knows his mistake.\u201d The Sixth Prince defended his elder brother.\u201cKnows his mistake?\u201dWho would have expected that His Majesty was still very angry?\u201cDo you know about the Heavenly Concubine whom he released three years ago?\u201d6\u201cShe returned to the Great Yan Dynasty and has risen to become the state sorceress of the Great Yan Dynasty from a holy maiden\u2026\u201d\u201cShe is now in charge of all the ritual activities of the Great Yan Dynasty.\u201d\u201cI heard that she can communicate with the heavenly deities and is worshiped by everyone as a divine maiden. She has slowly elevated the Great Yan Dynasty and they gradually created a great state base. This is all thanks to your elder brother.\u201d His Majesty grunted coldly.3The Sixth Prince was speechless.\u201cThat rebellious son is just lustful. He can stay in the Cold Palace for the rest of his life. Even if you succeed the throne in the future, you are not allowed to let him out, understand?\u201d His Majesty said sternly.7The Sixth Prince\u2019s face turned pale and he hurriedly tried to explain.But His Majesty gave him no chance to do so. He said coldly, \u201cI will issue an imperial decree, there\u2019s no need to talk about this matter anymore.\u201d14The Sixth Prince looked at his father helplessly and couldn\u2019t help but feel sorry for his elder brother.\u201cRecently, some cultists from those demonic sects have infiltrated into the capital. You take charge and investigate this matter. It\u2019s not safe now. The members of those demonic sects are making their existence known to the world, they should be plotting something\u2026\u201d1\u201cYou need to put more care into this matter.\u201d\u201cAs for your elder brother, let him take care of himself.\u201d His Majesty declared indifferently.\u2026Lin Jiufeng did not know about this matter.Even if he knew, it wouldn\u2019t matter to him.Anyway, he had no intention of leaving.This Cold Palace was a good place to Sign-In, he would continue staying there.2After the Sixth Prince\u2019s visit, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s days resumed their peacefulness.Lin Jiufeng signed in and took the Core Condensing Pill to improve his Golden Core cultivation every day.The path of cultivation in the Golden Core realm was not easy, the realm had nine levels to it.2In the Golden Core Realm, there was the False core, Inner core, True core, and Golden core!4Each level had an upper, middle, lower, and Major Perfection level.14The Lin Jiufeng was currently at the False Core Major Perfection realm.He was just one step away from the Inner Core realm. He had the Core Condensing Pill for his cultivation needs. He did not have to worry about not being able to break through.Other than cultivating, Lin Jiufeng also explored the vast garden in the Cold Palace.The garden sure was huge. Considering that beneath it was a place filled with extreme negative energy, it should have a lot of evil spirits.Lin Jiufeng searched the entire garden but he did not find a single evil spirit.1He didn\u2019t even find another lost soul like Imperial Consort Jia.The garden would become very eerie at night.But there wasn\u2019t a single evil creature, which made Lin Jiufeng feel helpless.But thinking about it carefully, no one could enter the Cold Palace.It was normal that there weren\u2019t any evil spirits.\u201cI\u2019ve taken out my Demon Slaying Sword, let me kill one or two evil creatures at the least.\u201dLin Jiufeng sighed helplessly.Then, he continued to Sign-In silently.Just like that, one month passed.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation had reached the peak and was on the verge of breaking through.Lin Jiufeng temporarily stopped cultivating when he reached Fake Core Major Perfection of the Golden Core Realm. He was in no hurry to break through.He tempered his True Qi every day and continued to reinforce his foundation.When the time came one month later, he naturally broke through.On this night, Lin Jiufeng was busy taking pills.14After swallowing a Core Condensing Pill, Lin Jiufeng had broken through in his own courtyard.True Qi gathered in his dantian, forming a sphere, which was then slowly polished and turned into an Inner core.Then, the two sword techniques, Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill and Sword Twenty-Two, practiced by Lin Jiufeng, transformed into countless sword energies that surrounded his Inner core like a dragon.Boom!When all of this was done and over, the Inner core and the sword energies in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s dantian exploded. The radiant white sword energies surrounded Lin Jiufeng, spreading to every inch of his body, including his spiritual consciousness.In the very next moment, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strength skyrocketed to a terrifying point.His spiritual consciousness was also rapidly expanding.He cultivated with his eyes closed.But the surroundings of this courtyard were all in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind.And the range of his spiritual consciousness continued to expand outward.At this moment, everything seemed to have come under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s spiritual consciousness.The place where he was at, the vast garden that he had thoroughly explored. These locations appeared clearly in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind.Suddenly, Lin Jiufeng realized that someone had sneaked into the Cold Palace.3The intruders were two men in black.3Both were True-core Golden Core cultivators. They went around and explored the Cold Palace.2Observing these two men, Lin Jiufeng did not make a move.Instead, he observed quietly.Despite being in the Golden Core realm like Lin Jiufeng, their spiritual consciousness could only cover a few meters around them. Unlike Lin Jiufeng\u2019s that could cover a distance thousands of times greater than theirs.2The leader, who was walking in front of the other, turned his head to look at his partner.Seeing what the other party was doing, he was suddenly infuriated.\u201cLao Er, why are you behaving so sneakily?\u201d The Big Brother scolded.\u201cBig Brother, we\u2019re thieves now. We must be careful,\u201d Lao Er said softly.\u201cThieves my foot! This is the famous Cold Palace in the Yuhua God Dynasty. There\u2019s only a dethroned prince here. There\u2019s no one else here other than him. What\u2019s the point of being so sneaky?\u201d Big Brother scolded.\u201cThat\u2019s true. That dethroned prince has no cultivation whatsoever, there\u2019s no way he will discover us.\u201d Lao Er was suddenly enlightened.He got excited and kicked a tree whose trunk was as thick as a bowl.Boom!The leader was so angry at what Lao Er had done that he slapped him and scolded, \u201cHe won\u2019t discover us, but this used to be the place where we hid the corpses of our Chasing Corpse Sect\u2026\u201d8\u201cThe ground beneath us is filled with extreme negative energies. If something terrible came out because of you, we will both lose our lives.\u201d1Lao Er submitted. He didn\u2019t dare to fool around anymore.\u201cWe are just here to make an outpost and investigate the place. Now that all the major sects are out in the world, our Chasing Corpse Sect cannot reveal any weaknesses.\u201d\u201cWe must retrieve our old ancestors that are buried deep underground so that we can recover our prestige,\u201d The leader said sternly.1\u201cBut Big Brother, when will our Chasing Corpse Sect go out in the world?\u201d Lao Er asked carefully.1\u201cIt should be ten years later when our sect master makes a break through\u2026\u201d\u201cWe are only here to make an outpost, no one knows that the ancestors of our Chasing Corpse Sect are buried here underground in this place of extreme negative energy. There\u2019s no need for us to hurry.\u201d3\u201cOnce we have the location mapped out, we will return to report,\u201d The leader said seriously.\u201cBig Brother, it seems that many people from the demonic sects are here in the capital of Yuhua God Dynasty. They seem to be up to something,\u201d Lao Er asked excitedly.\u201cI heard the news too. A senior from a demonic sect is here to assassinate Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s emperor. There is a storm rising, and the world has become tumultuous.\u201d2\u201cLet\u2019s take advantage of the situation, get the exact location that we needed, then we\u2019ll immediately take our leave,\u201d The leader said softly.\u201cAlright, Big Brother.\u201d Lao Er nodded obediently and began their search.\u201cBig Brother, I think this is the place.\u201d Lao Er finally found the location.The leader immediately came up and said excitedly, \u201cYes, this is it! Let\u2019s make a mark on our maps and come back afterwards.\u201dThe two men immediately got busy.Lin Jiufeng was stunned.He opened his eyes in his courtyard and mumbled, \u201cPeople from the demonic sects are here to assassinate the emperor? Underneath this cold palace was not only a place of extreme negative energy, but it is also the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2019s secret burial place for their ancestors?\u201d2He seemed to have discovered a terrible secret.He must keep their mouths shut.1With that on his mind, Lin Jiufeng pulled out his Demon Slaying Sword.Using his Sword Twenty-Two technique, he killed them through the countless walls.9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at the two bodies, paying special attention to certain places that were specially marked, lost in thought.2Were the ancestors of the Chasing Corpse Sect buried deep underground here?\u201cAccording to them, the sect master of the Chasing Corpse Sect will only reappear in ten years after a break through. Does that mean that I can dig out the ancestor of the Chasing Corpse Sect right now without repercussions?\u201d Lin Jiufeng had a sudden curious thought.[Do you want to Sign-In before the thousand-year-old underground corpse?]4Suddenly, a line of words appeared in front of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes, stunning him.\u201cThere is a thousand-year-old corpse buried deep underground?\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s heart pounded.But his mouth did not remain idle.\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.[Sign-In successful. Received Netherworld Corpse Control Technique!]12Then, a massive amount of memories was transmitted into Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind.He instantly comprehended every secret of the technique.With the technique, one would be able to control corpses and nurture a brand-new soul in the corpse.4It would then awaken and follow the orders of the one who used the technique on the corpse.This was a very powerful technique, considering the fact that it was able to nurture a brand-new soul within a corpse and inherit everything from the corpse.1After Lin Jiufeng confirmed his understanding of the technique, he acted decisively and started digging. Supported by his Golden Core cultivation base, he quickly dug down tens of meters underneath and soon saw a coffin.It was a copper coffin covered with various corpse-refining array drawings for the purpose of refining this thousand-year-old corpse.But the thousand-year-old corpse was in the Cold Palace. It could not get any nourishment from the blood of the living.The Chasing Corpse Sect did not dare to approach this area after the Yuhua God Dynasty built their imperial capital here as they were afraid of alerting the Dynasty to their existence.1For the past century, the corpse in the copper coffin had been in a state of deep sleep.It had never gone out of its sleeping place. However, it was slowly becoming stronger.Lin Jiufeng brought the copper coffin out, filled the pit, and returned to his yard.In the courtyard, the copper coffin sat quietly.Moonlight shone on it and its surface glowed with a metallic luster.He opened the copper coffin and saw a middle-aged man lying in it.4His face was pale, with no trace of blood beneath his skin.1He laid there, quietly.Lin Jiufeng used the Netherworld Corpse Controlling Technique and began to infuse his energy into the body.\u201cIncubate slowly, create a new soul in this corpse, and control it. This way, my hard work will not be wasted,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said as he looked at the copper coffin. He had been busy all night with the endeavor, but fortunately, he had the dust-free suit with him.5Otherwise, he would\u2019ve been covered with filth all over his body.Lin Jiufeng covered the copper coffin and placed it in a corner of the room.He observed slowly, and curiously for the born of the new soul from within.1Then, he continued to sign in and cultivate daily, while ignoring external affairs.\u2026In a flash, another three months passed.In these three months, his brother, the Sixth Prince, never once returned. He must be very busy.1Lin Jiufeng heard about that from Dachun.Dachun still came every seven days to deliver food and chat with Lin Jiufeng.Most of the time, Dachun talked and Lin Jiufeng listened.Dachun would tell Lin Jiufeng of the interesting things that happened in the imperial capital.And Lin Jiufeng would listen to everything Dachun said.He would sometimes give a simple reply as he ate.Afterwards, he would always return to his cultivation.After three months, his cultivation rose once again.From the Inner Core level of the Golden Core realm, he advanced to the True Core level.He was also just one step away from the next level of the Golden Core Realm.2Lin Jiufeng was also finally able to see some changes on the corpse of the ancestor of the Chasing Corpse Sect that he had been reanimating using the Netherworld Corpse Controlling Technique in the past three months.3His face was no longer pale like a dead man.There were signs of blood flowing within and his complexion had turned rosy.His stiff joints had become supple, and more importantly, a terrifying power could be felt within his body.The Netherworld Corpse Controlling technique was evidently working.Lin Jiufeng would take a look at him every few days, and then he spent the rest of the time working hard on cultivating.2Another week passed and Dachun arrived once more.He brought wine and food as always, and they were as delicious as ever.Of course, he chatted with Lin Jiufeng.On the other side of the main doors of the cold palace, Dachun leaned against the wall and talked.On the opposite side of the wall, Lin Jiufeng picked up the wine glass, took a sip of wine and a bite of food as he enjoyed the meal.Then, he listened to Dachun talk about various things.There were important matters and small matters, trivial issues, and personal stories.Dachun liked to talk and Lin Jiufeng was willing to listen, so they formed a harmonious pair.\u201cYour Highness, I may be a little busy lately. If I can\u2019t come next time, I will ask a friend to deliver your food. When I\u2019m finished with what I have to do, I will send wine and food to Your Highness again,\u201d Dachun said with an honest smile.1Lin Jiufeng was taken aback, and asked, \u201cAre you not just a small soldier in the Uniformed Royal Guard? Why are you so busy?\u201dThis was the imperial capital, the Uniformed Royal Guards shouldn\u2019t be too busy.\u201cRecently, many masters of cultivation have come to the imperial capital. There are daoist cultivators, demonic cultivators, buddhist cultivators and even masters from overseas\u2026\u201d\u201cHis Royal Highness, the Sixth Prince, has taken over the Uniformed Royal Guards, mobilizing us, and greatly increasing the capital\u2019s defense measures.\u201d1\u201cWe have to keep the public order of the imperial capital, and catch the wicked people who have no qualms about doing evil,\u201d Dachun explained.2Lin Jiufeng frowned.He immediately remembered what those two people had said from three months ago.A senior from a demonic sect was going to assassinate the current emperor\u2014Lin Jiufeng\u2019s father.Although Lin Jiufeng knew about it, he didn\u2019t take any other actions.He was only in the Golden Core Realm and couldn\u2019t possibly meddle in such things.4Thus, he didn\u2019t care and simply continued signing in peacefully.Three months had passed since then and everything remained peaceful.Lin Jiufeng hadn\u2019t heard that His Majesty was assassinated.As a result, Lin Jiufeng thought that the matter was simply fake.But hearing Dachun\u2019s words, he suddenly remembered the words of those two people.\u201cDachun, be careful when you are on duty outside. Don\u2019t try too hard. Your cultivation level is not high, don\u2019t get involved in a conflict with those in the cultivation world,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said solemnly.Dachun had constantly brought him food for more than three years and chatted with him for the same amount of time. Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to him.According to Dachun, it wasn\u2019t only the people from the various demonic sects that were here.Those that hailed from the various daoist, and buddhist sects were also here.On top of that, a lot of overseas cultivators were also present.The presence of these people made things more complicated.It was best if Dachun didn\u2019t get involved.\u201cThank you, Your Highness, for your concern. However, I\u2019m just guarding the palace and will definitely not encounter trouble. This is the safest place in the imperial capital.\u201d2\u201cI\u2019m just afraid that I will not be able to deliver food when it\u2019s time to because I might be on duty, so I\u2019m telling you in advance.\u201d Dachun smiled.Lin Jiufeng thought for a while. Then, with a flick of his finger, a sliver of sword energy pierced Dachun\u2019s body through the wall.Dachun didn\u2019t notice it.The sword energy would not cause him any harm, but it would let Lin Jiufeng know when Dachun\u2019s life was in danger.\u2018We have known each other for three years. No matter what, I don\u2019t want you to be in danger. I will definitely protect you.\u201915Lin Jiufeng liked Dachun\u2019s honest and serious attitude.It was just a simple order from the deputy commander of the Uniformed Royal Guards.Yet, he had diligently sent good food to Lin Jiufeng, who had already been banished to the Cold Palace. This delivery stint lasted three years and he had neither missed a delivery nor thought of receiving a reward.In everyone\u2019s opinion, what could a prince who has been banished into the Cold Palace do and hope for?However, Lin Jiufeng only cared about two people in the entire Yuhua God Dynasty.Dachun and the Sixth Prince.12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Netherworld Corpse Control Technique is finally having some results.\u201d Lin Jiufeng nodded, satisfied.1Soon, he would have a terrifying henchman.A thousand-year-old corpse buried deep underground in a place of extreme negative energy. At the same time, the corpse was the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2019s old ancestor. With these factors added up, Lin Jiufeng was simply going against the heavens!.Of course, he would only be able to know just how powerful this corpse was when it woke up.Lin Jiufeng continued his routine of signing in.Day after day.His cultivation also improved quietly.Until the seventh day after Dachun left.On this day, Lin Jiufeng was waiting for Dachun to bring some food and wine. But the person who came was not Dachun, but his younger brother, the current crown prince, Sixth Prince instead.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously as the doors of the cold palace slowly opened.The Sixth Prince walked in.This was the Cold Palace, not just anyone could come in.The last time the Sixth Prince came, he had to beg his Father just to meet Lin Jiufeng once.\u201cBig Brother, I am now the supervising crown prince, I hold more power now.\u201d The Sixth Prince smiled, carrying delicious delicacies in one hand and a jar of good wine in the other.Right on the steps of the cold palace gate, this supervising crown prince set up the wine and food, then looked at Lin Jiufeng with a smile.\u201cWhat happened? You have just become the Crown Prince and now you\u2019re supervising the state?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but think about his past self.He had been a crown prince for over ten years, yet he never had the chance to take on the responsibility of managing the state.This Sixth Prince only became the Crown Prince for god-knows how long, yet he was already supervising the state?\u201cBig Brother, the imperial capital is filled with demonic cultivators combining their forces and gathering together. They put up a slogan, saying that on the night of the full moon, a sword would appear from the west on the top of the Forbidden City, to kill Father.\u201dThe Sixth Prince said solemnly.A frown appeared on Lin Jiufeng\u2019s usually calm face.He asked curiously, \u201cA Royal Sacrifice. The old freaks in the royal family are not taking action?\u201d\u201cThey did. They have the major demonic experts under control. But the ones that are here to assassinate Father are not the head and leaders of those demonic cultivators. It\u2019s a thousand-year-old Demon Dao ancestor.\u201d The Sixth Prince sighed.\u201cA thousand-year-old Demon Dao ancestor? He has a grudge against the current emperor?\u201d1Lin Jiufeng asked, puzzled.\u201cThat Demon Dao ancestor\u2019s sect is called the Among Flowers Sect. They have been around for a thousand years. The first demonic sect that our father exterminated after he ascended the throne was the Among Flowers Sect.\u201d The Sixth Prince explained.6Lin Jiufeng immediately searched through his memories.The Among Flowers Sect truly was a despicable sect whose agenda was kidnapping beautiful women and doing unspeakable things to them. Their actions had angered the young emperor and he ordered a holy decree, sending 100,000 troops to crush the Among Flowers Sect.5\u201cAmong Flowers Sect deserved it. They asked for it,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.2\u201cBut the devil will never reason with anyone. They have sent a message to say that the next full moon night will be the day that Father dies,\u201d The Sixth Prince said helplessly.\u201cIs he very powerful?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.\u201cWell, he\u2019s already in the Martial Sage realm,\u201d The Sixth Prince replied.Lin Jiufeng frowned.\u2018Martial Sage realm, he would indeed be difficult to handle.\u2019\u201cBig brother also knows that the emergence of a Grandmaster in this era is already something worthy of a great celebration, not to mention a Martial Sage.\u201d\u201cNot a single Martial Sage has appeared in a thousand years\u2026\u201d4\u201cNow, this demon has broken through to the Martial Sage. After he comes out from seclusion, he would definitely do something big, and that is\u2014to assassinate the emperor of the top imperial dynasty of the world.\u201d The Sixth Prince drank a cup of wine, depressed.\u201cThat\u2019s why you became the supervising crown prince. In case anything happens to Father, you will immediately be able to succeed to the throne and stabilize the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d1Lin Jiufeng guessed the plans of his Father, whom he got after his transmigration.His Majesty would do his best to prevent his own death. But even if the other party succeeded, the supervising crown prince would instantly ascend to the throne to stabilize the Yuhua God Dynasty and prevent its downfall.\u201cBig Brother, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019d be able to come and visit you the next time. I will become very busy. Let\u2019s toast each other as brothers.\u201d The Sixth Prince lifted his glass of wine. He suppressed all the depressing thoughts in his heart and smiled.Lin Jiufeng lifted his wine cup and had a drink with this brother of his.\u201cWhen is the next full moon night?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cSeven days later!\u201d The Sixth Prince said after being silent for a moment.1There were several Grandmasters in the Yuhua God Dynasty, but no Martial Sages.The old ancestor from the Among Flowers Sect was probably the only Martial Sage in the Yuhua God Dynasty.1That was probably the reason why so many demonic cultivators flocked to the imperial capital, they must be thinking that the death of the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty would signal the rise of the demonic sects.The Yuhua God Dynasty invited the various taoist and buddhist sects to the imperial capital to ask for their help.Lin Jiufeng stayed in the Cold Palace all day and had no idea that in the outside world\u2014the entire world had their eyes on the Yuhua God Dynasty. Each of them that knew the inner workings were silently counting down.Seven days later, on the night of the full moon, a sword would appear from the West in the Forbidden City.The Sixth Prince was obviously distressed.After finishing a jar of wine with Lin Jiufeng, he got up and left.But before he left, he hugged Lin Jiufeng after a moment of silence.After a while, he left in a hurry.His back was now straight, radiating composure befitting to that of his status.The next time they meet, it could possibly be when he was already the ruler of this divine dynasty.1Boom!The door of the Cold Palace closed once again.Lin Jiufeng looked at the cold door quietly before walking around the courtyard.\u201cSeven days!\u201d Lin Jiufeng mumbled.He couldn\u2019t help but look toward the copper coffin in the room.1Would the thousand-year-old ancient corpse in the coffin wake up within the next seven days?12\u2026Time slowly passed.Lin Jiufeng continued to toil in silence. Signing-in and cultivating. This was his routine.The only thing that changed in his routine was the frequency of his glances at the thousand-year-old corpse inside the coffin.He used to look at it once every few days. Now, he looked at it a few times a day.On the seventh day, Lin Jiufeng surpassed the True core level and achieved the Golden core level of the Golden Core Realm.But he did not feel happy at all.Because today would be the night of the full moon, the same night when those group of demonic cultivators would start their rampage.As for the sword coming from the West on top of the Forbidden City, would the Yuhua God Dynasty be able to stop it?During the day, the people in the imperial capital did not go out so much.The entire imperial capital was filled with demonic cultivators on a rampage, people from the demonic sects rejoiced with wild excitement.To them, the Demon Dao would rule the world.In the evening, the entire Forbidden City was heavily guarded.The atmosphere was gloomy.Everyone waited for the moment when the moon was the roundest.And in the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng looked at the thousand-year-old corpse in the copper coffin.At this moment, it slowly opened its eyes.\u201cMaster!\u201d The elegant middle-aged man stood up and shouted respectfully.7Lin Jiufeng smiled slightly and said, \u201cCome, leave the Cold Palace with me!\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2014who was locked up in the Cold Palace\u2014left for the first time in four years.He brought along with him his henchman and headed for the Forbidden City.4Tonight was a full moon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The imperial guards strictly protected the palace grounds, but the people from the various demonic sects were still present, spying from the surroundings.Inside the Forbidden City, the daoist, and buddhists silently awaited the arrival of the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Martial Sage in the Imperial Shrine.1The centermost palace was desolate.The current, reigning emperor sat quietly on the throne.There wasn\u2019t a single person around.Da da da!All of a sudden, a human figure walked in from the outside. It was the Sixth Prince.\u201cFather, we are already heavily guarded. The six Great Grandmasters have taken their places, we\u2019re just waiting for that fanatic from the demonic sects. You\u2019d better take cover.\u201d The Sixth Prince urged.\u201cI am the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty. If I am not to be in this Central Hall, where would I hide?\u201d The Emperor said placidly.1He had no intentions of escaping.\u201cFather\u2026 If by any chance?\u201d The Sixth Prince said solemnly.\u201cDon\u2019t we still have you?\u201d The Emperor looked at the Sixth Prince and said with satisfaction.3\u201cOriginally, your older brother was doing the best job in your position, but he was momentarily obsessed with lust and went on a crooked path.11\u201cBut your appearance has put me at ease.\u201cToday, there will only be an Emperor that died standing up and no Emperor that escaped. We have set up a waiting trap, if those demons dared to come, my Yuhua God Dynasty will fight to the death with them!\u201d The Emperor solemnly declared.The Sixth Prince wanted to say something more, but the Emperor waved his hand. \u201cTake your leave. Go to the Imperial Shrine, they will protect you well. You are the hope of the Yuhua God Dynasty. Nothing must happen to you.\u201dIf he were to escape and the demonic cultivators turned to slaughter because they couldn\u2019t find him, it would be bad for the whole imperial household.He might as well quietly wait here.In any case\u2026 he was already suffering from a foul disease and his days were numbered.3\u201cChild. In today\u2019s world, one must still be powerful enough. Otherwise, even if you are royalty, it wouldn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d The Emperor advised in a low voice.The Sixth Prince left, the Emperor was now alone.Watching the arrival of the starry sky and full moon, his countenance was determined and his gaze was ice cold.Gathering the strength of the entire Yuhua God Dynasty to counter the top Martial Sage of the present age.When the full moon arrived, a demonic aura billowed in the air above the Forbidden City.Countless members of the Demon Sect were cheering, running about, and letting out mad howls as they encircled the Forbidden City.The demonic cultivators reveled!1Clang!In the full moon sky, a sword shadow appeared. Following that, a frightening presence came weighing down, everything beneath the skies was trembling.1The moonlight was beautiful, condensed into a stretch of shining silk that slid down.An aged figure landed with it.A head full of white hair with a baleful countenance, he carried with him an extremely terrifying might. With a longsword in hand, the sword slashed through the sky.\u201cEmperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty, you destroyed my Among Flowers Sect\u2019s legacy! Get out here and meet your death!\u201d2Among Flowers\u2019 Patriarch looked towards the Central Hall with an aloof gaze.1As for the others, he didn\u2019t acknowledge them at all, including the six Great Grandmasters.\u201cDemon, do not be rude. The Yuhua God Dynasty is not a place for you to be impudent!\u201d\u201cThe Yuhua God Dynasty stands upright even in the present age, with jurisdiction over hundreds of millions of people. How can it be something that you\u2014a measly demon can destroy?\u201d\u201cThe Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s Great Grandmasters have come forth to kill you!\u201d1\u2026Shouts came from all directions. The six Great Grandmasters of the Yuhua God Dynasty acted together. Without holding anything back, their blood and vital energies surged, vital essence fumes shot into the sky, they surely were powerful.Six people came charging from six directions and surrounded this Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch.\u201cGreat Grandmasters?\u201d Among Flowers\u2019 Patriarch only smiled at them in disdain.2\u201cThe gap between a Martial Sage and a Great Grandmaster cannot be crossed with you people shouting some slogans.\u201d The Among Flower Sect\u2019s Patriarch was extremely contemptuous.1He delivered a strike, and as if the skies had fallen, the swift and fierce sword shadow shrouded these six Great Grandmasters.Thump, thump, thump!The six Great Grandmasters simultaneously spat out large mouthfuls of blood from the strike. In an instant, they suffered severe injuries and were sent crashing into the palace. On their faces were looks of despair as they came crashing down.Even the joint effort of six Great Grandmasters could not withstand one strike from the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch?1A Martial Sage was this terrifying?When the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty and its court officials of all ranks saw this scene, their hearts fell into despair.They stared at one another.This demon was so powerful!He arrived stepping on the moonlight and smashed six Great Grandmasters with one strike.1Who exactly would be able to restrain him?1There was someone who said with gritted teeth, \u201cIs this the heavens wanting to annihilate my Yuhua God Dynasty?\u201d3Raising his eyes, he saw the people from the various daoist and buddhist sects. All of them had helpless looks on their faces as they looked at the Patriarch of the Among Flowers Sect.1This was not a battle between equals.Standing on the tallest roof of the Forbidden City, every move of the Among Flowers\u2019 Patriarch attracted the attention of millions.1People of the Demon Sect were cheering, laughing rampantly, wishing they could be dancing.2Some had even charged into the Forbidden City and bowed in worship to this Martial Sage of the demonic sects.People in the entire Yuhua God Dynasty had gone mute.Witnessing this scene, they felt a sense of powerlessness all over their bodies.The Emperor in the Central Hall sighed and closed his eyes, feeling weak throughout.3The trap that they had set up ended up useless against this Martial Sage from the demonic sects. Even the imperial guards guarding the palace were in despair as they watched the figure that appeared slightly hunchbacked beneath the moonlight.2This Martial Sage of the demonic sects had single-handedly suppressed the entire Yuhua God Dynasty!4Dachun was guarding a side gate of the Forbidden City alone.1It was very remote, no demonic cultivator had come over to this place.He watched the Among Flowers\u2019 Patriarch dazedly with a fully downcast look.1\u201cWho can defeat him?\u201d1Looking at it in the short-term, no one could defeat this Patriarch of the Among Flowers Sect.1The Yuhua God Dynasty was about to undergo a great upheaval.Da da da!1All of a sudden, footsteps rang out.1Someone was here.Dachun curiously lifted his head for a look. This was an extremely remote area, but someone still deliberately came here?Under the shine of the moonlight, a youth with outstanding features walked over with a middle-aged man who looked aloof from head to toe.Dachun asked in surprise, \u201cYour Royal Highness, why have you left the Cold Palace?\u201dThe person who had come was Lin Jiufeng.He pointed calmly and answered, \u201cI\u2019ve come to defeat him.\u201d5Dachun looked over following Lin Jiufeng\u2019s finger, he was pointing at the Among Flowers\u2019 Patriarch.1Dachun blinked and said, \u201cYour Royal Highness, your cultivation has been crippled for over four years now, you\u2019d better not get involved. If you return now, I\u2019ll pretend that I haven\u2019t seen anything.\u201d1Lin Jiufeng smiled placidly and said, \u201cThen, watch properly. Nameless, can you defeat him?\u201d10Lin Jiufeng was speaking to the Patriarch of the Chasing Corpse Sect behind him.2Through the sacrificial refinement of the Netherworld Corpse Control Technique, a new soul had been born for him.1The Patriarch accepted everything before him, including his cultivation realm.Lin Jiufeng did not know his previous name, so he simply gave him a new name.Nameless!4\u201cMaster, a thousand years ago, this Among Flowers\u2019 Patriarch was already my defeated opponent,\u201d Nameless said indifferently.8Lin Jiufeng ordered. \u201cGo then, kill him and this matter would be over.\u201dWith a tap of his toes, Nameless\u2019s body became akin to an arrow that had left the bow.He reached the highest rooftop of Forbidden City in no time.Boom!Right as every one of the Yuhua God Dynasty was in despair, an extremely vast Martial Sage aura arrived. Formidable and mighty, it instantly cleansed the demonic aura in the area before it directly faced the aura of the Among Flowers\u2019 Patriarch.2Everyone in the Yuhua God Dynasty was surprised.\u201cThis is\u2026 a Martial Sage?\u201d\u201cIs this a Martial Sage of my Yuhua God Dynasty?\u201d\u201cIt turns out that the Among Flowers\u2019 Patriarch isn\u2019t the only Martial Sage in the world.\u201d1\u201cGreat, this is great, my Yuhua God Dynasty also has a Martial Sage.\u201dThe Emperor in the Central Hall commented in surprise.\u201cMy Yuhua God Dynasty does not have a Martial Sage. Could it be that a certain Elder had made a breakthrough but intentionally concealed himself?\u201d3Nameless\u2019s arrival kindled hope in all the civil and military officials of the Yuhua God Dynasty, including the present emperor.And before the remote palace gate, Dachun looked at Lin Jiufeng. His eyes blinked innocently.\u201cYour Royal Highness, this person\u2026\u201d Dachun asked with a dry mouth.He watched Lin Jiufeng and seemed like he had come to an understanding about a terrifying matter.This dethroned Crown Prince actually has a Martial Sage under him?Wasn\u2019t this too frightening?Will I be silenced by His Highness?9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two people stood in front of the side gate and looked towards the highest rooftop of Forbidden City.Nameless, who had made a sudden appearance, caused the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch to turn pale with shock.He did not expect that the Yuhua God Dynasty actually had a hidden Martial Sage!\u201cNo\u2026 You\u2026 You\u2019re actually him!\u201d The Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch carefully surveyed Nameless.Suddenly, his entire countenance changed, becoming both surprised and angered.He had recognized the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2019s Patriarch.A thousand years ago, both of them were peerless talents of the same era, both a mix of good and evil. However, the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch had lost nine times against Nameless.His loss had long become his mental demon.\u201cDidn\u2019t you die long ago?\u201d The Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch cried out as he shook his head.He was in disbelief.The death of the Chasing Corpse\u2019s Patriarch resolved his mental demon.The former\u2019s death was a catalyst for his breakthrough to the Martial Sage Realm.\u201cSince you can live till now, I naturally can too.\u201dNameless lifted his hand, a terrifying longsword condensed in the center of his palm.\u201cDo you think that you can still defeat me now?\u201d The Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch roared with a hideous countenance.Boom!Nameless did not speak, he was straightforward and directly unsheathed his sword.He made his move utilizing the sword skill\u2014Sword Twenty-Two!This move split the dark night. The magnificent sword glow condensed in the vast sky, extending for tens of miles, bringing incomparable brilliance to everyone at once.People in the entire Forbidden City could not help lifting their heads and gaping in surprise.It was dawn!At this moment, the masses were greatly shocked.This move was too frightening, it manipulated nature itself.This move was also accompanied by a dragon\u2019s cry that reverberated all around.This move contained Lin Jiufeng\u2019s will.At the side gate, Lin Jiufeng was like Nameless, sword energy surging all over him. He closed his eyes, his consciousness interlinked with Nameless\u2019 as he displayed the might of Sword Twenty-Two through Nameless\u2019 hands.Sword Twenty-Two was a sword skill that allowed a spiritual connection between two existences.The countenance of the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch changed. He immediately felt that he had to escape. This move by Nameless made him feel a sense of foreboding. Back then, he was no match for the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2019s Patriarch. Now, he was not a match for Nameless.Not to mention, there was also a Lin Jiufeng behind Nameless.The body of the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch became akin to a fleeting shadow, he sought to escape at the swiftest speed, soaring through the air.Boom!The sound of booming thunder came from the sky, it reverberated throughout. Under the illumination of this sword glow that resembled daylight, everyone got a perfectly clear look as Nameless\u2019s strike slashed out.The body of the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch fell with a rustle, like sand and dry bone dust.At this moment, the whole imperial capital was silent.Nobody dared speak.The people of the Yuhua God Dynasty, the various demonic sect members, and the daoist sect members all had their eyes wide.They rubbed their eyes.What did they just witness just now?Splitting the sky with a strike!Night turning into day!The Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch was directly reduced to withered bone dust and was scattered into the wind.He was a Martial Sage!Noted to be the first Martial Sage in a thousand years!He was killed just like that?Was this a sword technique or a demonic technique?After this strike, the radiance that covered the skies gradually faded.Nameless\u2019 figure also vanished with the arrival of darkness.The sky\u2014it was raining!Drizzles covered the Forbidden City and the imperial capital.All of a sudden, an old peach tree in the city budded and blossomed.The aroma spread for tens of miles.Countless people lifted their heads, allowing the rainwater to fall on their faces as they stared in shock.The shock in their hearts spoke for itself.All the peach trees in the city bloomed with one strike!Was this the true capability of a Martial Sage?It was no longer just the cultivation of true Qi but it already involved the ways of Heaven and Earth.After the shock passed, the whole imperial capital fell into chaos.\u2026At the side gate of Forbidden City, Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes as he let out a long breath.Earlier, he was spiritually connected with Nameless to display that move of Sword Twenty-Two through Nameless\u2019 hands. It possessed terrifying might indeed.The Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch who was of the same level as Nameless was instantly turned into ashes with a fall of his sword.After a successful kill, Nameless silently returned and stood behind Lin Jiufeng, keeping his silence throughout.Dachun saw everything that had just happened.He wiped his face, it was covered in rainwater.His values, worldview, and his outlook in life had been overturned.\u201cYour Royal Highness, you are so powerful, why are you staying in the Cold Palace without leaving?\u201d Dachun asked with a dry mouth.He could not figure out why!\u201cWhy should I leave?\u201d Lin Jiufeng countered.Dachun was never good with words, he could not offer his explanation.\u201cThe outside world is a mess, there are too many disorderly matters, and they easily divert my attention. There is nobody to disrupt me all year round in the Cold Palace, and I can cultivate with peace of mind while ignoring the matters of the outside world\u2026\u201d\u201cSay, why should I leave then?\u201d Lin Jiufeng smiled and said.It was impossible for him to tell Dachun that he could sign in and get many good items in the Cold Palace.The other places did not have an environment that was as good as the Cold Palace\u2019s.Having witnessed a Martial Sage\u2019s strength tonight, Lin Jiufeng was even more determined that he would never leave without being a Martial Sage.Seeing Dachun\u2019s slow-witted manner, Lin Jiufeng said with a smile, \u201cAll right, remember to bring me dishes and wine next time, I still like listening to the things happening within the imperial capital.\u201dDachun nodded obediently. \u201cIf Your Royal Highness likes listening, Dachun will share them.\u201d\u201cMm, don\u2019t tell anyone else that you\u2019ve seen me, this is our secret.\u201dLin Jiufeng instructed Dachun.Dachun nodded stoutly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Royal Highness. Even if I were to die, I will not speak of it.\u201dLin Jiufeng then left with Nameless.Nameless had just been revived. He had the capabilities of a Martial Sage, but he could not instantly become well-versed in his moves, techniques and whatnot.That was why Lin Jiufeng employed the Sword Twenty-two through his hands using a spiritual connection between the two.Now that he had gotten rid of the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s trouble, Lin Jiufeng could return to the Cold Palace and continue his peaceful norm of signing in.He wanted to continue becoming even stronger.Only when the Yuhua God Dynasty was no longer in danger could he continue signing in peacefully without being disturbed by anyone.\u2026Tonight\u2019s events instantly spread like wildfire.The Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch had actually suffered a crushing defeat in the Yuhua God Dynasty. He was killed with one strike by a mysterious powerful expert, unable to hit back at all.A great uproar!After this incident, not only did the Yuhua God Dynasty not fall into pieces, it instead earned a great boost in reputation.Countless people started guessing, who exactly was that mysterious man?And what relationship did he have with the Yuhua God Dynasty?Meanwhile, the internal officials of the Yuhua God Dynasty were also confused.In the Central Hall, the current, reigning emperor sat on the throne, his countenance an exhausted one after experiencing the night\u2019s disturbance.Beneath him was only the Sixth Prince.\u201cFather, is this mysterious man really not the last card of our Yuhua God Dynasty?\u201dThe Sixth Prince asked.\u201cNo!\u201d His Majesty shook his head and said, \u201cI summoned you here because I wanted to get you to investigate who this mysterious person is. Once you find out who he is, you must invite him to the palace. Be reverent and respectful, he saved my Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201dThe Sixth Prince nodded and said, \u201cI understand, I will investigate carefully.\u201d\u201cMm, go handle it. I\u2019m tired, you will continue holding the post of acting regent.\u201d The Emperor waved his hand in exhaustion and got the Sixth Prince to leave.Then, he held his chest\u2014an agonizing expression was on his face.\u2026The outside world was full of commotion, but Lin Jiufeng returned to the Cold Palace and started his quiet sign-in routine.[Sign-In in front of the stone lions before the Cold Palace\u2019s gates?]\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng did not expect that a pair of stone lions could be used to sign in.[Sign-In successful. Received Fearless Lion Imprint!]A powerful imprint, it has devastating might\u2026Transferred directly into his mind, Lin Jiufeng instantly mastered it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Fearless Lion Imprint that he gained from signing in allowed Lin Jiufeng to have another powerful martial art, the addition of this martial art would surely increase his capabilities.Previously, he only had a few sword techniques.But now that he had another technique up his sleeves, he finally had something that he could consider as his trump card.After signing in, Lin Jiufeng entered the Cold Palace.Once the gates closed, nobody knew that he had once left the place.As for the disturbances of the outside world, they all had nothing to do with Lin Jiufeng.Seven days soon passed.As always, Lin Jiufeng quietly cultivated, striving to improve his potential. He focused on his sign-in routine for the sake of the Core Condensing Pills that he needed to make an early breakthrough past the Golden Core Realm into the Grandmaster Realm.If he had been a Grandmaster in the past, he could be considered as one of the country\u2019s trump cards. But since the appearance of a Martial Sage, Grandmasters didn\u2019t seem to be that of a big deal to him anymore.On this day, Dachun came.He came with delicious dishes and good wine. As usual, he shared the happenings within the imperial capital to Lin Jiufeng at the gates of the Cold Palace.\u201cYour Royal Highness, the people from the various demonic sects have already retreated, the members of the daoist sects and buddhist sects are also slowly taking their leave. The common people of the imperial capital have resumed their quiet life once more,\u201d Dachun said.\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Lin Jiufeng drank a mouthful of good wine and commented.\u201cI heard that a few vassals previously wanted to overthrow the Yuhua God Dynasty under the commotion created by the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch\u2019s attack. But now, they seemed to have quietened down. They have expressed their allegiance to the throne,\u201d Dachun said.\u201cWithout capabilities at the Martial Sage realm, they wouldn\u2019t dare to rise in rebellion.\u201d Lin Jiufeng was completely unbothered by these things.These vassals were loyal subjects who had accompanied the Yuhua God Dynasty on its establishment in the early years. As a reward for their loyalty, they were subsequently given a part of the land to manage, but their descendants weren\u2019t as loyal as their predecessors.Those nine vassals were currently the mortal malady of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Back when he was Crown Prince, they were also a great worry for Lin Jiufeng.But they weren\u2019t his problems to think about now, they were the troubles of the Sixth Prince and the current reigning Emperor.He would just sign in peacefully.After eating and drinking his fill, Dachun left.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s life was very tranquil, he cultivated quietly.As for Nameless\u2026Even though he was resurrected because of the Netherworld Corpse Control Technique, and a new soul was born from within him, birthing a new consciousness that formed the current Nameless.He still wasn\u2019t a \u2018human\u2019 in principle.To be precise, he was merely a puppet that took orders from Lin Jiufeng.He was at the Martial Sage Realm but was eternally unable to progress.Moreover, if Lin Jiufeng had no orders for him during the usual days, he would keep lying inside the copper coffin.Signing in day by day, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t receive Core Condensing Pills from each of his sign-ins.He sauntered around the entire Cold Palace.On this day, he arrived at an abandoned palace.Qianyuan Hall!Locked up in this hall were the two brothers who had contended for the throne with the current emperor back in the past. In other words, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s uncles.After they died of grief, this place subsequently became deserted. No one came to tidy it, and it had long become overgrown with weeds that were covered in dense cobwebs. The palace looked dilapidated with broken and collapsed walls. It was evidently difficult to settle here.Lin Jiufeng looked at the dilapidated place, a helpless streak of sword energy swept across and cleared the weeds.[Sign-In at Qianyuan Hall?]A line of words appeared before his eyes.\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said without hesitation.He wanted to see what he could receive from signing-in at such a place.[Sign-In successful. Received Millennium Frost Jade Bed!]Lin Jiufeng looked at this sentence in surprise.He immediately returned to his courtyard.As expected, there was a frost jade bed that constantly emanated a freezing cold air in his courtyard. It wasn\u2019t considered big though, it was just a single bed in size.This was a thousand-year-old frost jade bed, an item of great nourishment to cultivators.Cultivating on the frost jade bed could help one\u2019s human body absorb the natural spiritual energies in the air, achieving twice the result with half the effort.\u201cWith this frost jade bed, my path to the Grandmaster Realm isn\u2019t far off,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said in delight.He immediately moved the frost jade bed into his room and started cultivating on it.Sure enough, his gains throughout a single day were equivalent to his cumulative gains of three days without the frost jade bed.This was already very fast.Except for his daily routine of signing in, Lin Jiufeng spent the rest of his time cultivating on the frost jade bed every day.Time moved in a flash, half a year went by.Within half a year\u2019s time, Lin Jiufeng had raised his cultivation base to the Grandmaster Realm.He was already at the third step of the Grandmaster Realm.The Grandmaster Realm was divided into nine steps.Everyone referred to these steps as \u2018nine steps toward the sky\u2019.Most Grandmaster cultivators would never be able to complete these nine steps in their entire life, but this wasn\u2019t difficult for Lin Jiufeng. Especially after he obtained the frost jade bed, his cultivation speed had truly improved, significantly.Nothing special happened in the imperial capital in these six months.Every time Dachun came over, the matters he spoke of were small, trivial ones.However, when Dachun came this time, he said solemnly to Lin Jiufeng, \u201cYour Royal Highness, His Majesty seems to be dying, the court officials and the commoners are all talking about this issue.\u201dLin Jiufeng asked curiously, \u201cHe\u2019s only 50 years old. According to his cultivation base, living up until 300 years would not be a problem. How could he be dying?\u201d\u201cIt is said that His Majesty had forcefully cultivated the imperial household\u2019s mystic technique and damaged his foundation, he couldn\u2019t be cured at all\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the recent six months, his condition became more severe, the state affairs and whatnot were left to the Sixth Prince\u2019s supervision. His Majesty hasn\u2019t been going to the court much during these recent three months,\u201d Dachun explained.Lin Jiufeng was stunned.This Father Emperor of his that he had gotten without effort was really going to pass on?Then, that younger brother of his would become the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty.This news that Dachun brought this time caused quite a big fluctuation in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mood.In any case, he was the father of this body.It was impossible to be completely indifferent.\u2026Forbidden City, Central Hall.The current Emperor was already a bag of bones.Half a year ago, he was still the dignified emperor; half a year later, he was on his deathbed.Outside the Central Hall, court officials knelt in a row, grieving looks were on their faces.Inside the hall, there was only the current Emperor and the Crown Prince.The current Emperor has been in a coma for a month.Right now, he temporarily regained his consciousness right before his death.He opened his eyes to ask this question, \u201cChild, have you found that Martial Sage senior?\u201dThe Sixth Prince shook his head and answered softly, \u201cI have not. We don\u2019t have any information about him at all.\u201d\u201cIt seems that this Martial Sage senior does not wish to be disturbed.\u201d\u201cYou have to continue searching but do not let up in training your own people.\u201d\u201cRight now, a Martial Sage has already appeared, a great change has come to the spiritual energy of the world, cultivation has become easier to do.\u201d\u201cIn the future, there will be many, many, Martial Sages that will emerge\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Yuhua God Dynasty must have its own strength.\u201dThe Emperor gripped the Sixth Prince\u2019s hand tightly and conveyed some hidden matters with great difficulty.A great change in the spiritual energy of the world\u2026Cultivation has become easier to do\u2026Only a handful of people from some major forces knew about these matters.\u201cIn the future, when the massive change finally hits the world, the Yuhua God Dynasty must have countermeasures for it. And the vassal influences, after you accede to the throne, you have to handle them well.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d The Sixth Prince agreed.The Emperor gasped. \u201cAbout your older brother, back then, it was in a fit of anger that I wiped out his cultivation. At that time, he released the Heavenly Concubine, the court officials and the commoners were extremely displeased\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can improve his life, do not let him out for now, but as for later on\u2026\u201dBefore his words fell, his hands loosened.The Sixth Prince shouted loudly in sorrow, \u201cFather Emperor!\u201dCourt officials of all ranks outside the hall also started wailing.\u2026On this night, Lin Jiufeng looked at the moon from inside the Cold Palace.He was dressed entirely in white with a peaceful countenance.All of a sudden, nine tolls of a bell sounded from inside the Forbidden City.Nine represented the imperial throne.The bell represented death.The current emperor, that Father Emperor of Lin Jiufeng, who had become his father without much effort, had passed on.At his moment, weeping came from everywhere in the imperial capital.Lin Jiufeng sighed and turned to bow in the direction of the Forbidden City\u2014sending him off.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe passing of the Emperor was a major event, the machine that was the Yuhua God Dynasty started operating.The Sixth Prince naturally succeeded the throne and changed the title of his reign to Yuan.It was the Yuhua Yuan era, he was also titled\u2014Emperor Yuan!1The state funeral lasted three months, every vassal sent their children to come and greet the new emperor, but they themselves did not do so.1Emperor Yuan gave a warm reception to the children of these vassals without any displeasure throughout.But in private, his countenance was ice cold.He was very angry.The late emperor had passed on, yet the vassals won\u2019t even come.Their wild ambition was abundantly clear.1However, he had just succeeded the throne, he could not touch the vassals, yet.That was why he welcomed them with a smiling face, appeasing the children of these vassals.Three months later, the children of the vassals left the imperial capital.1Emperor Yuan also started getting busy, managing the affairs of the state and nurturing talents.In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation was still advancing by leaps and bounds.He recently felt that the effects of the frost jade bed seemed to have improved.In the past, when he cultivated on the frost jade bed, one day\u2019s results were equivalent to three days of the old.But now, one day could be equivalent to five.Moreover, following the passing of time, his cultivation speed was also becoming increasingly fast.\u201cWhat\u2019s the logic here?\u201d Lin Jiufeng was very curious.4Unbeknownst to him, this was a very early sign of the so-called great change to the spiritual energy of the world. Lin Jiufeng simply dismissed it, however, for he only found it a little abnormal.Just like that, a year passed.Lin Jiufeng spent his fifth year in the Cold Palace.Which was also the first year after Emperor Yuan acceded to the throne.This year, Emperor Yuan took over state affairs and began launching reforms. However, he was met with strong resistance, and he was also so busy that he had no time to come see Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng was busy as well\u2014busy cultivating.4At the end of this year, he had broken through the nine steps of the Grandmaster Realm.There were nine steps in the Grandmaster Realm and Lin Jiufeng had ascended them all within a year. He made a direct breakthrough to the Great Grandmaster Realm.1A Great Grandmaster was already the top existence of the current era just below a Martial Sage. But these days, Lin Jiufeng had never heard of a Martial Sage appearing anywhere else in the world.He continued his silent routine of signing in.Similar to the \u2018nine steps toward the sky\u2019 of the Grandmaster Realm, the Great Grandmaster Realm also had \u2018nine steps up the heavenly steps\u2019. Lin Jiufeng worked hard to surmount them every day.3On this day, Lin Jiufeng was cultivating on the frost jade bed when the Emperor walked into the Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng walked out.Seeing the weary Emperor Yuan, he said respectfully, \u201cGreetings, Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cBig Brother, between us brothers, there\u2019s no need for this.\u201d The previous Sixth Prince and the current Emperor Yuan looked at Lin Jiufeng and said with a wry smile.He was under a lot of pressure.1A lot!Managing a God Dynasty was extremely difficult.Especially when one sought to pass reforms in such a God Dynasty, it was doubly so.It was only after Emperor Yuan toiled for a year did he realize that his progress was incredibly slow. He felt depressed and wanted to find someone to talk to, but then he also realized that he had long become a loner. His wife, who had always shared the same bed as him, was concerned with nothing but power.14She had her heart set on making her son the Crown Prince.2Emperor Yuan felt bored.2He thought of his older brother and hence came here to look for Lin Jiufeng for a chat.Lin Jiufeng invited Emperor Yuan to sit down in the courtyard.He brewed a pot of tea and offered Emperor Yuan a cup.3These tea things had naturally been delivered here by Dachun.2\u201cAfter being the Emperor, the man above millions, you seem to be exhausted?\u201dLin Jiufeng handed the brewed tea to Emperor Yuan.Watching this younger brother of his, who had always called him Big Brother, Lin Jiufeng was full of emotions.If the original owner had not released that Heavenly Concubine back then, the one feeling vexed right now would have been himself.2\u201cBig Brother, this court is full of people who feed at the public trough and the outside of the court is full of greedy and wildly ambitious people. I sought to reform the universe but I am strong in will and weak in power. I cannot change the world,\u201d Emperor Yuan sighed.Lin Jiufeng looked at him and asked, \u201cWhere is the resistance coming from?\u201d1\u201cAristocratic families\u2026 the sects!\u201d Emperor Yuan\u2019s expression turned cold. \u201cThe aristocratic families annexed the lands, oppressing the village people\u2026\u201d\u201cThe common folks lost their lands and became refugees, but they disregarded all of that. They get the court to dispense relief funds, then collude with corrupt officials to swallow up the relief funds, virtually audacious to the extreme!\u201dAt the mention of this, Emperor Yuan was enraged. \u201cAnd those sect forces, the daoist sects with many disciples occupy famous mountains and great waters. They are restricting their activities to a designated area, but they are still refusing to let local authorities interfere\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd the buddhist sects!\u201d\u201cThey are carrying out a construction boom in Jiangnan! Building temples left and right. Even if you are an extremely vicious and wicked man, so long as you believe in Buddha, so long as you are willing to turn over a new leaf, you can gain enlightenment, virtually absurd!\u201d3\u201cThere is a line in a poem that is very famous, 480 temples of the God Dynasty, how many are in the mist and\u00a0rain1.\u201dLin Jiufeng did not speak but he quietly observed this Emperor Yuan in front of him.Previously, in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s heart, he was just a younger brother.But now, he truly felt like an emperor.An Emperor who was trying his best to bring changes to Heaven and Earth, but was ultimately limited by the power in his hands, unable to move the world whom he sought to transform.\u201cBig Brother, do you know?\u201dEmperor Yuan suddenly looked solemnly at Lin Jiufeng.\u201cThe nine vassals colluded with the demonic sects. Back then, if the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch succeeded, the nine vassals would\u2019ve stood up in rebellion.\u201d\u201cFortunately, that Martial Sage acted and the crisis was resolved. But during the recent few years, they have become restless once more,\u201d Emperor Yuan sighed.1\u201cNot just them, there are also the Shu Mountain, Lingnan, Mobei.\u201d\u201cThese big factions beyond the borders, and the other countries\u2026\u201d\u201cAll of them are directing covetous looks on my Yuhua God Dynasty, wishing to rush up in a crowd to chew up and devour the Yuhua God Dynasty into their stomachs.\u201d1Emperor Yuan had to get a lot of things off his chest and as a result, his troubles were poured out to Lin Jiufeng.He shared them with others but they were in awe of his identity and were unwilling to come close.Only by sharing them with his Big Brother could he truly unload the troubles in his heart.\u201cGoverning a big country is like cooking a small fish, you cannot rush it.\u201dLin Jiufeng sighed and commented.\u201cBig Brother. Now that I only have this small amount of power over the imperial capital in my hands. If things go on like this to the point that my decree cannot even leave the imperial capital\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would truly be impossible to turn the tables against them,\u201d Emperor Yuan said in worry.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, there will be a solution. You have to handle them slowly, no rush,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said placidly.\u201cSolution?\u201d Emperor Yuan laughed in self-mockery. \u201cOnly if that Martial Sage appeared right now and publicly supported me will I have enough prestige to implement the new policies and change the world beneath me.\u201d1\u201cThere will be.\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s calm smile deepened.\u201cAlright, Big Brother. You don\u2019t have to console me.\u201d\u201cAfter sharing these with Big Brother, I feel much better\u2026\u201d\u201cBig Brother is right, governing a country is like cooking a small fish, I was too anxious.\u201d Emperor Yuan shook his head and laughed in spite of himself.He did not believe in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words.He thought that he said those words to console him.He wasn\u2019t able to find the Martial Sage in the years that have passed, how could he appear anytime soon?\u201cBig Brother, do you want to leave?\u201d Emperor Yuan suddenly asked.Lin Jiufeng shook his head and said, \u201cThe outside world is a mess, why would I leave?\u201d\u201cBig Brother, you\u2026\u201d Emperor Yuan wanted to go on.1\u201cAlright, I\u2019m used to the tranquility here. If you have anything bothering you in the future, you can come and pour them out to me. I shall not leave.\u201dLin Jiufeng rejected Emperor Yuan\u2019s good intentions.\u201cBig Brother, let me arrange for a person to serve you at the least. I have no other place to leave him anyway, I\u2019ll put him by Big Brother\u2019s side, please help me and guide him. It\u2019ll be pretty good if he can be a merchant millionaire, to say the least,\u201d Emperor Yuan implored.\u201cWho?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.\u201cMy illegitimate son!\u201d Emperor Yuan sighed and said.10\u201cIn my early years, I made a pledge to marry without the permission of our parents with a young lady. Then, she became pregnant.\u201d2\u201cI subsequently wanted to bring her back to my home, but after becoming the Crown Prince, with the etiquette framework weighing on me, I could not do so.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, it would become a weakness that others could take advantage of to attack me with\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter acceding to the throne, the pressure from the court and the commoners were massive, that I couldn\u2019t even acknowledge my own child. He is gradually growing up too, I hope to have Big Brother guide him.\u201d Emperor Yuan revealed the entire context.1He was the emperor, every word of his carried weight.Yet, he didn\u2019t even dare acknowledge his own child.This was the current situation of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Go to him.\u201d Lin Jiufeng ordered placidly, switching the identity of Nameless\u2019s master to Emperor Yuan.12Although Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want to handle the troubles that his younger brother had shared with him early in the day, handing Nameless to him and reducing the pressure that he was feeling with the help of Nameless was still something that Lin Jiufeng could do.With Nameless\u2014who was a Martial Sage\u2014the resistance against Emperor Yuan\u2019s reforms would probably be greatly reduced.On other hand, he also had a selfish motive in doing so. The more stable his younger brother\u2019s position was, the safer he was in the Cold Palace. Nobody would come to disturb him.If the Yuhua God Dynasty really was to fall into pieces, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s place would become far from the peace that he wanted.After all, beneath this Cold Palace was an area with extremely negative energy.Many people would definitely covet the secrets in such a place.Nameless turned and left the Cold Palace, he went to the Forbidden City to look for the current emperor.\u2026Lin Jiufeng had no idea what happened in the Forbidden City last night.But when he woke up the next morning, he saw his own nephew.A very handsome little fellow with delicate and refined features.He was already five years old, but he had yet to be admitted into the imperial family\u2019s pedigree.5It only struck Emperor Yuan when he was at his wit\u2019s end that his older brother was well-learned and would definitely have no problem teaching a child.In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng looked at the little rascal before him and asked, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cLin Tianyuan!\u201d The child answered in a clear and sweet-sounding voice.\u201cDo you know why you have come here?\u201d Lin Jiufeng continued to question.\u201cTo listen to Your Royal Highness\u2019s teachings,\u201d Lin Tianyuan replied.\u201cAlright, don\u2019t call me Your Royal Highness in the future, just call me Teacher.\u201d Lin Jiufeng waved his hand. This child was sent here by his younger brother. No matter what, Lin Jiufeng had to teach him well.1\u201cYes, Teacher.\u201d Lin Tianyuan knelt down to kowtow, neat and efficient.He did not have the muddle-headedness and meekness of other children.\u201cHenceforth, you will follow me. I don\u2019t need you to serve me or whatnot. Just focus on cultivating, I will guide you,\u201d Lin Jiufeng advised.\u201cAlright, Teacher,\u201d Lin Tianyuan agreed.\u201cHere\u2019s a secret manual, use it for cultivation.\u201d Lin Jiufeng handed the Glorious Dream of Spring and Autumn technique that he had gotten from a previous sign-in to Lin Tianyuan.3This was a very powerful inner strength cultivation technique, Lin Jiufeng was also practicing the same technique.Lin Tianyuan received it reverently then went through it in detail.4He directly asked Lin Jiufeng about the parts that he couldn\u2019t understand.One adult and one child began the days of quiet cultivation in the Cold Palace.1\u2026Lin Jiufeng gradually realized that Lin Tianyuan had a pretty good talent for cultivation.He had only started his cultivation a month ago, yet he had already completed his journey through Foundation Establishment. His speed was even faster than when Lin Jiufeng was still the Crown Prince.Of course, the Glorious Dream of Spring and Autumn technique, and the Foundation Establishment Pills that Lin Jiufeng received from signing in, including Lin Jiufeng\u2019s personal pointers all contributed to his swift cultivation speed. However, Lin Tianyuan\u2019s talent was truly astonishing, not to be underestimated.2A month later, Lin Jiufeng imparted to him a sword skill.Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill!This was the sword skill that Lin Jiufeng received from his very first sign-in, and also one of his only two sword skills. It was tremendously powerful and could instantly kill an enemy.12Lin Jiufeng instructed Lin Tianyuan to unsheathe his sword a thousand times a day without slacking. Without slacking meant that he must be focused all throughout the action of unsheathing for it to be counted to the thousand times per day.The five-year-old Lin Tianyuan gritted his teeth, his thin and small body forcefully persisted throughout. Taking one Foundation Establishment Pill every two days, all the nutrients for his body were sufficiently supplemented by the pill.Every seven days, Lin Jiufeng would let Lin Tianyuan make a trip home to see his own mother, then he would return to continue cultivating.2Of course, Lin Jiufeng could also relax while eating the delicacies and drinking the good wine that Dachun brought. Afterwards, he would then listen to Dachun sharing the trivial matters happening in the outside world.\u201cYour Royal Highness, something big happened in the imperial capital yesterday,\u201d Dachun said with a laugh.Lin Jiufeng asked, \u201cWhat something big?\u201d\u201cHis Majesty suddenly announced land reforms yesterday, it will start from the imperial capital itself. The first to bear the brunt are the four big family clans in the imperial capital. But they objected with everything, a good half of the court officials also objected,\u201d Dachun said.Lin Jiufeng quietly drank his wine and prompted. \u201cThen?\u201d\u201cThen, His Majesty got the imperial guards to take down the members of the four big family clans and throw them into prison in the presence of the court officials,\u201d Dachun said excitedly.\u201cWhat reaction did the four big family clans have?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked placidly.After handing Nameless to Emperor Yuan, Lin Jiufeng knew that Emperor Yuan would make a big move, but he didn\u2019t expect that this younger brother of his could actually remain so calm to the point that he waited until a month later before acting.\u201cOf course they rebelled. The four big family clans directly contacted the Forbidden\u00a0Troops1, wanting to rid the emperor of disloyal court officials and rise in revolt at night,\u201d said Dachun.Lin Jiufeng thought for a while.He might be cultivating last night, but he didn\u2019t hear the sounds of any upheaval.\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any commotion last night.\u201dAlthough the Cold Palace was located in a remote place, he would still be able to sense the revolt of the Forbidden Troops.\u201cOf course, there was no commotion. Just as they were preparing to rebel, that Martial Sage acted. He killed all the experts of the four big family clans, the traitor general of the Forbidden Troops was also killed. He quelled the storm within a very short time. Today morning, the court underwent a great purge. His Majesty\u2019s prestige is unprecedentedly powerful, no one dares to act presumptuously anymore,\u201d said Dachun agitatedly.After saying all of these, he quietly asked, \u201cYour Royal Highness, was it you who got that Martial Sage to act?\u201dIn the entire Yuhua God Dynasty, only Dachun knew that Lin Jiufeng had a Martial Sage under his command.Lin Jiufeng laughed and said, \u201cThat is His Majesty\u2019s Martial Sage subordinate. I\u2019m just a dethroned Crown Prince who is imprisoned in the Cold Palace. How will I have a Martial Sage subordinate?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re done here, pack up the things and leave. I\u2019ll see you next time.\u201dDachun let out an \u2018oh\u2019.He knew that Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want to talk about that matter so he immediately stopped asking about it. He obediently packed his things and left.After Dachun left, Lin Jiufeng looked towards the Forbidden City and murmured, \u201cYou should be feeling less pressure by now. With a Martial Sage supporting you, any resistance against your reforms would be much smaller.\u201d4Cleaning up the resistance in the court was just the first step.He still had a very long way to go next.Meanwhile, Lin Jiufeng continued to Sign-In. His routine continued as he waited for an opportune moment to make his breakthrough to the next realm, all the while guiding Lin Tianyuan as he cultivated.In a flash, ten years went by.7The tenth year of the Yuhua Yuan era.3And also the tenth year of Emperor Yuan\u2019s ascension.Lin Jiufeng had now spent over 15 years in the Cold Palace.2He transformed from a youth in his early twenties to a forty-year-old uncle.11Through the trials of time, what remained unchanged was only that handsome face of his.4At the end of the ten years, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation base reached the peak of the Great Grandmaster Realm.Peak in its truest sense.He wasn\u2019t in a hurry to make a breakthrough, though. In fact, he could have done so five years ago.But Lin Jiufeng had just grasped the subtleties of the Martial Sage Realm at that time and began polishing himself with no rush to make a breakthrough.All the way till now, he was still sharpening.But after the passing of a decade, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strength had grown incredibly strong.Lin Jiufeng dared state that he could kill a Martial Sage like Nameless with a snap of his fingers.5This was the result of his accumulation over the decade.Throughout the ten years, the only person to witness Lin Jiufeng\u2019s might was Lin Tianyuan.He grew from a five-year-old child to a 15-year-old teen with a very tall height and a young handsome face.Despite being so innocent-looking, his capabilities weren\u2019t to be undermined.And during these ten years, it could be said that the outside world had experienced a lot of sudden changes and persevered through many intense situations.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay10 years later in the Cold Palace, things were still the same as before.Just that some of the interior parts had been cleaned up.Lin Jiufeng was the one who tidied and cleaned a few places here and there.He tidied up the vast garden and the lake, giving himself a place to stroll and relax.Over these 10 years, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation didn\u2019t require the aid of the Millennium Frost Jade Bed anymore, so he let Lin Tianyuan use it.5Other than signing in every day, Lin Jiufeng would just sit quietly beside the lake, looking at the sky, the earth, and the water beneath\u20262His cultivation level had already reached the peak of the Great Grandmaster Realm.The Martial Sage Realm was just a fingertip away.He could break the barrier to this realm just by poking at it with his finger.But Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t in a rush to advance to the next realm.\u201cThe Martial Sage Realm truly is a realm far more profound than the previous realms.\u201d\u201cBeing an existence of this realm is equivalent to being a sage of the martial path. Not only does a Martial Sage continues to accumulate True Qi to further develop his meridians, but a sage also has to comprehend the concept of the martial path, creating his own unique martial will to destroy all enemies beneath the realm of the Martial Sage with ease.\u201dLin Jiufeng muttered in his heart.He had been accumulating his own martial will for the past few years.After five years, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s martial will had become as vast and as deep as the sea, bottomless and boundless.7He looked at the wide lake in front of him and formed a sword seal with his index and middle finger before he slowly raised his hand.Boom!All the water in the entire lake leaped into the air at this moment, the water splashed and turned into countless longswords for Lin Jiufeng\u2019s disposal.1This scene was seen by Lin Tianyuan in the distance. His eyes widened in shock.It was because Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t use any of the True Qi in his body. At this moment, he was akin to an ordinary person, yet with just a thought\u2014tens of thousands of longswords instantly condensed from the water in the lake.They streaked through the skies before they exploded at once.Shush!1The rain of swords descended, each drop of water powerful enough to kill a Great Grandmaster.They all landed in the lake before Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s True Qi moved and condensed by itself inside his body, turning into water droplets.One drop!Two drops!Three drops!At this moment, the vast True Qi in his body condensed into a river, flowing through Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body.He closed his eyes and he felt as if his soul was wandering throughout the world by itself.He saw a small grass breaking through the soil in the distance, showing its head tenaciously.He saw the fish in the lake running in a panic as if they were shocked by what Lin Jiufeng had done just now.2He also saw the ants in the soil building a nest and saw an ant in the nest working hard.7\u2026Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes.The world depicted in his eyes seemed to have changed dramatically.But it also seemed that nothing had changed at the same time.Lin Jiufeng smiled and thought: \u201cThe realm of Martial Sages doesn\u2019t seem difficult to reach.\u201d6In the five years that passed, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Martial Will had already become incredibly strong and solid. Just by closing his eyes, he advanced to the Martial Sage Realm.1This was extremely terrifying and powerful indeed.\u2018There are several stages in the Martial Sage Realm. The first being Profound Insight, the goal is to obtain a profound understanding of the martial path.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng thought silently.The Profound Insight stage was the first of the many stages in the Martial Sage realm.The differences between the stages in the Martial Sage Realm weren\u2019t in the amount of their True Qi, nor the power of their skills and techniques. It was in the strength of their Martial Will.At this moment, Lin Jiufeng recalled the two Martial Sages, the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch and Nameless from more than 10 years ago. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh, thinking. \u2018They are both very weak in the Martial Sage Realm.\u2019The Martial Will of the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch could practically be called fragile.As for Nameless, he didn\u2019t have a Martial Will at all.Back then, Lin Jiufeng used his body to execute Sword Twenty-Two and killed the enemy with one strike.This was the truth of that event.After all, Nameless was a corpse that had been resurrected. To be frank, it was already good for him to have the strength of a Martial Sage despite not having a Martial Will.Lin Jiufeng compared his own Martial Will with those two.He found the difference between a drop of water and the sea.\u201cI can kill them with a flick of my finger.\u201d Lin Jiufeng sighed, feeling quite invincible.4The Martial Will he spent five years comprehending and accumulating was really too vast and deep.1\u2026After Lin Jiufeng broke through the realm of Martial Sage, the days passed by like usual.3He would occasionally give Lin Tianyuan some pointers before spending the rest of the time comprehending his own Martial Will.But today, Emperor Yuan, who hadn\u2019t come to the Cold Palace for 10 years, came.1The current Emperor Yuan wasn\u2019t as immature as before. 10 years had passed and he was already 30 years old. The sense of majesty in him had grown stronger and his cultivation level had also entered the realm of Golden Core.5Not far from the realm of Grandmaster.But if he wanted to reach Martial Sage in this life, it was basically hopeless.After all, he was entangled by a lot of trivial, worldly matters.\u201cBig Brother!\u201d Having not seen each other for 10 years, Emperor Yuan called out cordially when he saw Lin Jiufeng.Although he felt that something was amiss\u2026Why did it seem that his elder brother whom he hadn\u2019t seen for 10 years hadn\u2019t changed at all?A cultivator could prevent their age from showing on their appearance, but their temperament would inadvertently change. However, in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s case, 10 years for him seemed as to only a single day had passed.His smile still was as cheerful as ever, like that of a teenager. His smile made everyone feel as if a breeze was blowing in their direction, it felt refreshing and peaceful. Standing beside him made anyone feel subconsciously at peace.\u201cFather.\u201d Lin Tianyuan greeted respectfully.His name wasn\u2019t inside the royal family tree, so he couldn\u2019t greet Emperor Yuan as \u2018Father Emperor\u2019.2Emperor Yuan smiled gently.Compared to \u2018Father Emperor\u2019, he preferred the title \u2018father\u2019 much more.\u201cHow are you doing?\u201d Emperor Yuan asked in concern.\u201cFather. Teacher has taught me a lot, especially in the path of martial arts. His knowledge is broad and profound, but I am a stupid person and didn\u2019t even manage to learn 1% of Teacher\u2019s knowledge,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said with shame.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Your teacher is very knowledgeable, but you aren\u2019t bad either. You\u2019re already at the Golden Core Realm at such a young age, you have a bright future ahead of you.\u201d2Emperor Yuan didn\u2019t take Lin Tianyuan\u2019s words to heart, only treating them as a compliment to his elder brother.5Emperor Yuan truly believed that his elder brother\u2019s knowledge of literature was broad and profound.But as for the martial path?Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation base was destroyed in the past.This was something that everyone knew.Although he had started his cultivation journey anew, he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach a considerably high realm anymore since he has to start from the beginning at such an old age.3\u201cHow come you have time to visit today?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously when he saw Emperor Yuan again after 10 years.Regarding Emperor Yuan\u2019s reforms, Lin Jiufeng would listen to Dachun speak about it once every seven days.His reforms really were carried out on the corpses of many.In the past 10 years, Emperor Yuan never rested for even a single day.Lin Jiufeng sometimes couldn\u2019t help but sigh upon hearing Dachun\u2019s expositions.He felt that Emperor Yuan really was suitable to be the emperor.5\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for 10 years, so I came to have a look at you today.\u201dEmperor Yuan sat beside Lin Jiufeng.His anxious mood became relaxed due to the subconscious influence of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation base.He let out a long sigh of relief, the pressure that had been pressing against his heart for a long time disappeared without a trace.He closed his eyes comfortably.Lin Jiufeng glanced. He didn\u2019t do anything.Every movement of a Martial Sage cultivator could subconsciously influence those around him.It was because every Martial Sage had a special field of influence around them.This was also the reason why the realm had the word, \u2018Sage\u2019 in it.\u201cBig Brother, I came to visit you and also to bring Tianyuan away. He is already 15 now, and it\u2019s time for him to see the outside world. After all, he has already reached the Golden Core Realm,\u201dEmperor Yuan said.\u201cEn. Bring him out,\u201d Lin Jiufeng nonchalantly said.He didn\u2019t plan to teach Lin Tianyuan forever anyway.It wasn\u2019t like Lin Tianyuan could Sign-In like him. In that case, what was the point of staying with him in the Cold Palace all the time?\u201cFather, I want to continue learning from Teacher,\u201d Lin Tianyuan insisted.Lin Tianyuan had seen the strange scene of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s breakthrough to the Martial Sage Realm. He firmly believed in his heart that Lin Jiufeng was a very powerful expert. Learning from him was surely advantageous, so he wasn\u2019t willing to leave just yet.\u201cI am going to do something big, and I need your help. There\u2019s no one else that I can trust to help me with it,\u201d Emperor Yuan said solemnly.\u201cTianyuan, go with your father. The Cold Palace isn\u2019t the place where you should be. If you have any difficulties in the future, you can come back and find me.\u201d Lin Jiufeng gave a promise to Lin Tianyuan.1They lived together for the past ten years after all.Lin Tianyuan still wanted to say something, but Emperor Yuan was very busy with things, so he took him away directly.\u2026Inside the Forbidden City in the middle of the night, the Central Hall was brightly lit.The Central Hall was the place where future and past Emperors handled official duties and met with important court officials.Emperor Yuan, who was already on the throne for 11 years, sat on the dragon chair.Underneath him stood an old man dressed in the uniform of officials.He was the Cabinet Chief and the first minister who supported Emperor Yuan\u2019s reform.He was also Emperor Yuan\u2019s most trusted person.2Emperor Yuan studied literature with him in his youth, so Emperor Yuan had always addressed him as Teacher.\u201cTeacher, it has been 10 years\u2026\u201d\u201cI have reformed the Yuhua God Dynasty for 10 whole years.\u201d\u201cAside from the land occupied by the nine vassals and the top sects, my reforms had already been implemented in all the other places where the people work and live in peace and comfort\u2026\u201d\u201cThe result of my reforms have strengthened my determination to implement them in the land occupied by the nine vassals and the top sects,\u201d Emperor Yuan said solemnly.\u201cYour Majesty, the problem regarding the vassals, the top sects, and the aristocratic families shouldn\u2019t be rushed. We cannot afford to underestimate their strength,\u201d The Cabinet Chief advised.\u201cOf course, I know that it cannot be rushed\u2026\u201d\u201cBut it has been 10 years!\u201d\u201cTen whole years have passed, but I still cannot solve these problems. If I continue to wait for the opportune moment, it would only get harder for me to solve these problems for they will continue to consolidate their strength.\u201d\u201cTherefore, I have decided to act and remove the vassals first!\u201d Emperor Yuan said with a cold expression.1\u201cYour Majesty, you mustn\u2019t do this!\u201d\u201cThe forces of the nine vassals united are enough to fight against the imperial power, not to mention that there are demonic sects supporting them. Removing the vassals from their power is equivalent to forcing them to join forces to deal with us!\u201d\u201cIt will be a calamity to the nation\u2026\u201dThe Cabinet Chief\u2019s expression changed heavily. He knelt on the ground, advising against it.\u201cNo need to say anymore, I have already decided!\u201dEmperor Yuan remained determined, his eyes were faint and cold.He knew how difficult it would be to remove the vassals, but now, there were powerful enemies both inside and outside.Even if he didn\u2019t try to remove the vassals, they were already planning to revolt anyway.He might as well launch a preemptive attack against them before they could revolt!1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEmperor Yuan was determined in his decision. He had been training his own forces for over 10 years now, and he also had a Martial Sage in his camp. If he didn\u2019t act now, when should he act? When the other side had their own Martial Sages to deal with his own?5The Cabinet Chief couldn\u2019t persuade him against it.Seeing that Emperor Yuan was fixed on this, he could only nod and said, \u201cI will do my best and give my life to the nation and Your Majesty.\u201dEmperor Yuan was moved and said, \u201cWith the support of Teacher, I am much more confident that we will succeed.\u201d\u201cI shall go back first. This time, the elimination of the vassals will definitely be a move that will shock the world. Preparations must be made first, otherwise, we won\u2019t be able to control the situation fully by then.\u201d The Cabinet Chief was quick to act.1Since they had already decided to do it, they must prepare everything properly first.\u201cTianyuan, send the Cabinet Chief out,\u201d Emperor Yuan said to Lin Tianyuan.\u201cYes!\u201d Lin Tianyuan cupped his fists and replied in a deep voice.He then sent the Cabinet Chief out of the Forbidden City. When he came back again, Emperor Yuan was sitting on a raised platform in the center of the huge Central Hall, and a large pile of documents was piled up on the table, all of which were state documents.A dim light from a lamp illuminated Emperor Yuan\u2019s face, making him appear thin, albeit his eyes were firm.Emperor Yuan had been spending every day of the past 10 years the same way.Every night in this seat, he always went through various documents and memorials, without spending a single day to slack.Even the most demanding people would say that Emperor Yuan was a diligent man who saved a falling nation from ruin by turning the tide around.However, the problems of the Yuhua God Dynasty that had been accumulating for hundreds of years could no longer be resolved. It was about to explode at any moment now.1Emperor Yuan dealt with the problems one by one but he realized that the number of people that he could use was just far too few for the problems that he had to deal with.Fortunately, Lin Tianyuan was finally grown up. He also had a decent cultivation base. This was why Emperor Yuan decided to bring him into the officialdom and officially groom him.Lin Tianyuan watched as Emperor Yuan carefully reviewed the memorials\u2014the memorials representing various national affairs were revised by him one by one, either by agreeing to it, or by putting forward his opinions, and sending them back to be revised again.Very busy!In the past, Lin Tianyuan hated his father for not acknowledging his identity, but today, witnessing Emperor Yuan\u2019s predicament, the resentment in his heart vanished.11Everyone had their own difficulties.It wasn\u2019t until the latter half of the night that Emperor Yuan finished revising the memorials.He let out a sigh of relief. Most of the oil in the lamp had already been depleted.Lin Tianyuan stood straight.Standing on one side of the hall, he seemed to blend with the shadows.Emperor Yuan looked at Lin Tianyuan\u2019s body that was taller than himself.He smiled with satisfaction and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve grown up!\u201d\u201cFather, I will help you in the future,\u201d Lin Tianyuan couldn\u2019t help but speak up.Seeing that Emperor Yuan worked so hard for the nation, Lin Tianyuan really admired him.\u201cYou are already a Golden Core Realm cultivator, you can indeed help me out now,\u201d Emperor Yuan said with a smile.\u201cFather\u2026\u201d Lin Tianyuan hesitated.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Emperor Yuan asked curiously.\u201cMy cultivation level has already reached the Grandmaster Realm a few days ago,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said solemnly.\u201cWhat?\u201d Emperor Yuan looked at Lin Tianyuan in surprise. A 15-year-old Grandmaster?\u201cYou\u2019re not kidding? You\u2019re only 15 years old\u2026 How could you be a Grandmaster?\u201d Emperor Yuan was surprised as he hurriedly asked.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s thanks to Teacher\u2019s teaching. I am very stupid and could only swallow whatever the Teacher teaches me without understanding all of it. But even so, I still managed to reach the Grandmaster Realm,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said from the bottom of his heart.In his eyes, Lin Jiufeng was an invincible existence hidden in the Cold Palace.\u201cBig Brother\u2026\u201d Emperor Yuan was at a loss for speech.How could it be?Wasn\u2019t Big Brother\u2019s cultivation base destroyed by their father 10 years ago?3Didn\u2019t Big Brother have no resources for cultivation anymore after he was sent to the Cold Palace?How could his Big Brother groom Lin Tianyuan into such a powerful cultivator?Various thoughts and theories appeared in Emperor Yuan\u2019s mind at this moment.Hearing his son\u2019s words, some confusing parts that he had noticed back then finally had their answers.Ten years had passed and the stress from handling state affairs made him look older than he was before. Although he could rely on his cultivation base to look young, those with discerning eyes would still notice that he had aged.But his Big Brother still looked the same as before\u2014young and energetic\u2014living alone and away from the commotion of the outside world in the Cold Palace, like a celestial that was banished to the mortal world.In addition\u2026 that Martial Sage!Emperor Yuan suddenly remembered a matter from 10 years ago\u2026\u2018I complained to Big Brother back then, and then the Martial Sage Nameless took the initiative to find me and help me kill my enemies to stabilize the nation.\u2019\u2018That Martial Sage Nameless was asked by Big Brother to come and help me?\u2019\u201cBig Brother\u2026 how powerful is he exactly?\u201d Emperor Yuan asked Lin Tianyuan in shock.\u201cNo one knows how powerful Teacher is,\u201d Lin Tianyuan shook his head and replied.2Emperor Yuan never thought that his brother had a hand in this matter.After all, everyone knew that the previous crown prince\u2019s cultivation had been destroyed by the late emperor.But now, everything seemed to fall into place.As for Lin Tianyuan\u2026He followed Lin Jiufeng for 10 years, yet he had never seen the latter execute any technique. The only time he witnessed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s power was at that moment when Lin Jiufeng broke through the Martial Sage Realm.3A lake of water turned into a rain of swords with just a casual swing of his finger\u2026Lin Tianyuan felt that he needed to learn from his Teacher for a lifetime before he could have the ability to drive the world\u2019s energies with ease like his Teacher.\u201cBig Brother is indeed Big Brother\u2026\u201d Emperor Yuan smiled bitterly. When he was young, he wanted to surpass his Big Brother and obtain some achievements to make Big Brother proud.But now, he couldn\u2019t help but smile bitterly.\u2026Cold Palace!3After Lin Tianyuan left, Lin Jiufeng finally experienced quietness once again.No one bothered him anymore, and he also didn\u2019t have to sign-in for the pills that Lin Tianyuan needed to cultivate. Considering all of these, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mood was quite good.8He started his daily meditating and Qi refining, then he practiced controlling the world\u2019s energies, combining them with his martial will, and integrating them into his martial arts.Stacking these improvements layer by layer, Lin Jiufeng became stronger bit by bit.The Martial Sage Realm was divided into several stages.Upon just reaching the Martial Sage realm, a person would definitely be at the Profound Insight Stage, after which was the Life Knowing Stage.The stage of Life Knowing was to thoroughly understand one\u2019s own life and one\u2019s own foundation.After Life Knowing was Fish Leap.2The entire sea was for the fish to leap.4The world was the sea and the cultivator was a tiny fish. Once the cultivator leaped over the shackles of the world which was the sea, he would be able to truly transcend the world.The last stage was the Martial Path Great Sage!1These four stages represented how strong a person would be in the Martial Sage Realm.Lin Jiufeng was currently at the Profound Insight Stage of the Martial Sage Realm.But his Martial Will and his proficiency in harnessing the world\u2019s energies could crush those of the Life Knowing Stage.1Lin Jiufeng thought silently \u2018I\u2019m already at the Martial Sage Realm. I only have to slowly increase my cultivation base. There is no need to worry about other things.\u20193The Yuhua God Dynasty was still stable anyway, no one would come to bother him.After reaching Martial Sage, Lin Jiufeng finally knew how to fly.His True Qi had transformed into a vast and deep river in his dantian. Relying on his boundless True Qi, Lin Jiufeng flew in the air like a bird without the aid or support of any external forces.He flew in the air for about two hours before he finally stopped.\u201cShort-term flight is no longer a problem. As my cultivation base gets stronger, the flight time will become longer, which is good.\u201d Lin Jiufeng was satisfied.He could continuously fly for about two hours at an incredibly fast flight speed. He had no idea if he was too strong or the others were just too weak, but one thing was for sure\u2014his flight duration and speed truly were terrifying.3In the past, Nameless could only continuously fly for a quarter of an hour before his True Qi was depleted.To kill an enemy thousands of miles away, Lin Jiufeng only needed a few minutes to travel to his enemy\u2019s location.1\u201cIt\u2019s been more than 10 years since I\u2019ve arrived in this world. I am finally able to somewhat protect myself from others with my strength. In the past few years, the spirit energy in the world seemed to have increased by a large margin. It seems that a world of great competition and fighting is about to come soon. I still have to become stronger.\u201d Lin Jiufeng sighed.9In his previous life, he had read a lot of novels.He knew that once the so-called world of great competition started, the various geniuses in the world would be like carps crossing the river, appearing in numbers so large that it would be uncountable.1His little bit of strength now would be nothing at all by then.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want to go out just to become a stepping stone for a chosen one of destiny or something.4Wasn\u2019t it good enough to just stay low-key and sign-in silently in the Cold Palace?2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The entire Yuhua God Dynasty was like a huge sophisticated machine that was swiftly operating.Even though the nation still looked calm on the outside as if nothing was happening, the tides of change surged inside. A lot of people noticed these subtle changes. They nervously asked around about what the Yuan Emperor and the Imperial Court were up to.The entire imperial capital was caught in a state where the ordinary people were living their daily lives as usual, but the families of court officials were living in fear that Emperor Yuan was going to make a move on them.They had reason to be afraid. In the past ten years, Emperor Yuan had killed countless corrupt officials. All of the court officials knew that Emperor Yuan was an emperor with great ambitions, great means, and a great heart for killing.2It was just that they had never imagined that Emperor Yuan\u2019s move was to remove the nine vassals.Directly confronting the stubborn illness of the Yuhua God Dynasty that had existed for hundreds of years.No one knew the news beforehand.Lin Jiufeng naturally didn\u2019t know either.He was just a dethroned prince who was locked up in the Cold Palace, and all the information that he had about the outside world came from Dachun.Dachun would come and tell Lin Jiufeng some news every seven days, and it was news that Dachun himself heard from others.Since the news that Dachun knew was something that everyone knew, all that he told Lin Jiufeng weren\u2019t secrets.Lin Jiufeng cultivated quietly, slowly strengthening his Martial Will while trying to comprehend his own path on the martial path, as well as polishing his own understanding of the world\u2019s energies.He did all of these as he silently signed-in inside the Cold Palace with peace of mind.He recently toured around the entire Cold Palace and signed in at many places.His gains were quite good.He didn\u2019t have the time nor the mind to pay attention to the outside world.Except for Emperor Yuan, Lin Tianyuan, and Dachun, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t care about anyone else in the Yuhua God Dynasty.As long as these three were fine, Lin Jiufeng would be too lazy to go out and make any move.6As time passed day by day, Lin Jiufeng also became stronger day by day.Until the fourth day of October, Emperor Yuan issued a decree in the Imperial Court saying that he wanted to celebrate the 80th birthday of the Empress Dowager.3Anyone who was a First-rank court official of the Yuhua God Dynasty would be required to come back to celebrate her birthday.The spearhead was directed at the nine vassals.Because of their titles and their territories, their status was that of a First-rank official of the Imperial Court.Emperor Yuan wanted them to come to the imperial capital to celebrate the Empress Dowager\u2019s birthday.After this decree came out, everyone was shocked.They immediately linked this decree to the nine vassals.Emperor Yuan\u2019s private actions, which they had always been worried about, were not actually directed at them, but at the nine vassals.Was the disaster made by vassals that had plagued the Yuhua God Dynasty for hundreds of years finally going to be placed out in the open?Everyone was currently discussing this issue at this moment. All sorts of opinions were expressed, but without exception\u2014all of them were shocked by this move from Emperor Yuan.The previous emperors always chose to compromise with the nine vassals when facing this problem.They never actively provoked them.As long as the nine vassals didn\u2019t revolt, the previous emperors were fine with letting them grow their own armies and being kings in their own territories.This was a method to deceive themselves that everything was fine. It was akin to drinking poison to quench one\u2019s thirst. They were just letting the nine vassals eat off the empire\u2019s territories bit by bit. In the end, the Yuhua God Dynasty would still end up in misfortune.But the past emperors had no other choice too.Each of the nine vassals was very powerful, plus they were all in an alliance, forcing the Yuhua God Dynasty to let them do as they please.But the newly-enthroned Emperor Yuan decided not to follow the choice of his predecessors.2He chose to confront the nine vassal lords directly and coldly announced that they were required to come to the imperial capital in the near future to participate in the birthday of the Empress Dowager.Failure to come would be regarded as non-compliance.The so-called 80th birthday was just a gimmick.Because the Empress Dowager was skilled in preserving her looks and her cultivation base was also not bad. Although she was 80-years-old now, she still looked as beautiful as a 30-year-old woman, the charm of her maturity was obvious to see.7Would someone in such a state need to hold a birthday dedicated to longevity?Furthermore, the Empress Dowager was a woman.She didn\u2019t want Emperor Yuan to mention her age if it wasn\u2019t necessary.But now Emperor Yuan not only mentioned it, but he even told the entire world that he wanted to celebrate her 80th birthday.1She was quite enraged over this.But there wasn\u2019t anything she could do, because she wasn\u2019t Emperor Yuan\u2019s biological mother, their relationship was very poor. She couldn\u2019t control the current emperor at all.The ministers wanted to persuade Emperor Yuan against this, but he ignored all obstacles and pushed through with this matter.In less than a day, almost the whole world knew of this.The Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty was going to act against the nine vassal lords.Remove their status and title!This was an important matter!In this world, there was only one divine dynasty\u2014the Yuhua God Dynasty.4However, there were many other small countries under the Yuhua God Dynasty.There were also a lot of countries overseas, and countries outside the boundaries of the Yuhua God Dynasty, all of which were paying close attention to the events that were about to unfold in the divine dynasty.1Once the Yuhua God Dynasty became internally chaotic, these tigers and wolves would definitely not hold themselves back from biting off a few pieces from the huge chunk of meat that was the divine dynasty.For a period, everyone in the Yuhua God Dynasty lived in anxiety as they discussed all of these.Lin Jiufeng also heard the news from Dachun the next day.They met at the entrance of the Cold Palace.Dachun was already 29 this year, and his cultivation base had reached just the Golden Core Realm, specifically at the False core level of the Golden Core Realm.5He was now a leader in the Imperial Army with hundreds of people under his command.As a result, he was busy every day.But he still insisted on sending food and wine to Lin Jiufeng in order to talk to him.\u201cYour Royal Highness. Today, His Majesty said that he wanted the nine vassal lords to come to the imperial capital to celebrate the Empress Dowager\u2019s birthday.\u201d Dachun talked about this matter in detail.This was the biggest thing happening at this moment.After all, the nine vassal lords were not some small flies.In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng frowned and said, \u201cHe\u2019s too impatient.\u201d3Upon hearing this, Lin Jiufeng knew immediately that this matter was being dealt with hastily.It was the right move to remove the vassal lords, but did Emperor Yuan have the power to suppress all nine vassal lords at the same time?Wasn\u2019t this forcing the nine vassal lords to stand together and oppose the Yuhua God Dynasty?Moreover, the vassal lords had the demonic sects supporting them.The battle in the Forbidden City had greatly damaged the prestige of the demonic sects.However, their strength still wasn\u2019t something that could be underestimated.After all, only an old ancestor of the Among Flowers Sect died, and the Among Flowers Sect already ceased to exist even before his death.Furthermore, that old ancestor had been the only remaining member of the Among Flowers Sect back then.Dachun touched his head and said, \u201cBecause they were far away from the imperial capital and the Emperor, these vassal lords are overlords in their own territory. They don\u2019t obey the Emperor anymore, so it\u2019s indeed correct to do something about them.\u201dLin Jiufeng sighed and said, \u201cThey are a disaster, but you can divide and defeat them one by one. Whether it is to instigate discord, take advantage of their own interests, or to threaten and exploit them, these are all usable methods. Why choose the most unwise way?\u201d\u201cDoes he think that just because he has a Martial Sage supporting him, he can deal with the nine vassal lords all at once?\u201dLin Jiufeng frowned, still not able to figure out why Emperor Yuan did it this way.\u201cYour Royal Highness. Why don\u2019t you go talk to His Majesty about this?\u201d Dachun suggested.Lin Jiufeng shook his head and said, \u201cHe has already made a decree and the whole world knows of it now. What\u2019s the point of me persuading him at this point?\u201dBesides, he was just a dethroned prince.What right did he have to interfere with His Majesty\u2019s decision?2\u201cDachun. Come report to me if anything big happens in the future. I have a hunch that this world, which has been calm for decades, is going to become chaotic,\u201d Lin Jiufeng murmured.1He looked at the sky; the sky was clear and the breeze was gentle.1But in the eyes of a Martial Sage, Lin Jiufeng saw a blood-red color gathering in the sky above the Forbidden City, killing intent surging within it.1A catastrophe was bound to happen for both Emperor Yuan and the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201cOkay, I will inquire about the news and report to your Highness as soon as possible.\u201dDachun nodded and agreed.\u2026Lin Jiufeng\u2019s guess was correct.As the topic of \u2018removing the nine vassals\u2019 spread all over the world, its tranquility which was akin to a serene lake suddenly had a giant rock dropped into it.With a bang, the water in the lake splashed high and scattered all around.It was no longer calm!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Their ancestors followed the founding emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty in building the nation and had made great achievements. As a result, they were titled\u2014Grand Duke Zhao.The Zhao Family managed a province by themselves.At Grand Duke Zhao\u2019s mansion, many people had gathered tonight.Nine people were seated around a round table.These nine people were the nine contemporary vassal lords.Behind them stood their confidants.\u201cEmperor Yuan has really gone mad, this time. To think that he would actually dare to make a move on us. He\u2019s really seeking his death.\u201d Grand Duke Zhao coldly snorted.The titles they had were hereditary, and they were already used to being the kings in their territories. Therefore, they didn\u2019t want to go to the imperial capital to surrender their wealth and comfortable lifestyle to Emperor Yuan.\u201cWho is going to teach this new emperor a lesson and let him know how powerful the vassal lords are?\u201d A man with a hooked nose sneered.\u201cThis Emperor Yuan is ambitious and wants to fully control the nation. But he didn\u2019t ask if we agree to this,\u201d said a potbellied vassal lord.1\u201cThe time for us to rebel has not yet arrived.\u201d\u201cWith the great changes happening to the world\u2019s energies, and with the abundant accumulation of spiritual energy, the major forces are all lying dormant. That is what we should do,\u201d A scholar-like man said.\u201cOf course, I know that the time hasn\u2019t arrived yet. The recovery of the spiritual energy hasn\u2019t reached its peak yet, it\u2019s just the beginning. If not, then I would\u2019ve already led an army to rush into the imperial capital to cut off the head of this whimsical emperor.\u201d A muscular martial artist coldly shouted.\u201cThen\u2026 how should we teach Emperor Yuan a lesson?\u201d An old Grand Duke asked.\u201cJust poison him to death and save us the hassle,\u201d Grand Duke Zhao said directly.\u201cZhao Guogong, if you choose to poison him, then I can only choose to assassinate him,\u201d The man with the hooked nose smiled and said.\u201cWhat are you two doing? Competing with each other?\u201d The potbellied vassal lord boisterously laughed.\u201cSince King Tianying wants to bet with me, that\u2019s fine. Let\u2019s see which one of us succeeds first, whether Emperor Yuan will die under my poison or your assassination.\u201d Grand Duke Zhao also laughed and didn\u2019t mind at all.Instead, he regarded the death of Emperor Yuan as a bet.\u201cKing Tianying, there is a Martial Sage following Emperor Yuan. This Martial Sage once killed The Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch and is supporting Emperor Yuan. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t even dare to remove us, the vassal lords,\u201d The scholar-like man said.\u201cOf course, I know that Emperor Yuan has a Martial Sage, but do you think that he\u2019s the only one who has a Martial Sage in this world?\u201d King Tianying sneered.The other eight vassal lords simultaneously chuckled.The ancestors in their families have all reached the realm of the Martial Sage, this was why they weren\u2019t afraid of Emperor Yuan trying to remove them from power.15The emperor only had a single Martial Sage cultivator, he had no chance of winning against the nine Martial Sages on their side!1\u201cSince this is the case, then we shall let the people of the world see our abilities. Let\u2019s increase the stakes a little bit. Out of the nine vassal lords, whoever kills the emperor first will win,\u201d Grand Duke Zhao stood up and said.\u201cI have no problem with this, but what\u2019s the bet?\u201d King Tianying agreed without hesitation.\u201cLet\u2019s gamble on the token of the Holy Master of the demonic sects.\u201d\u201cThis token is split into many parts, whoever gathers them all can obtain the treasures left behind by the Holy Master.\u201d\u201cI know that everyone has a single piece in their hands.\u201d\u201cThe other eight shall unconditionally hand over the token to the winner.\u201dGrand Duke Zhao smiled as he said.A strange light flashed in his eyes.He had his own motives.Use the death of Emperor Yuan as a bet, start a competition between them, and then obtain the Holy Master\u2019s tokens.As for whether he could win or not, he was very confident.The others pondered for a moment. Then, they nodded in agreement one by one.Following this, the nine vassal lords each went to the imperial capital through their own means to kill Emperor Yuan.The gamble on the death of Emperor Yuan officially started.This group of people didn\u2019t place the empirical power, Emperor Yuan, and the Yuhua God Dynasty in their eyes at all.\u2026Forbidden City, Central Hall.Emperor Yuan was sitting with an exhausted look on his face.In front of him stood an old man.He was looking at Emperor Yuan with a complex look on his face.\u201cToo hasty,\u201dThe old man said the same words as Lin Jiufeng, thinking that Emperor Yuan\u2019s operation was done hastily.Emperor Yuan smiled bitterly and said, \u201cGrandpa Emperor, the vassal lords have become an unsolvable problem, and they cannot be restrained anymore. I must take this opportunity to eliminate them.\u201d\u201cBut you are unwise to offend the nine vassal lords at the same time.\u201d The old man sighed.He was the Emperor two generations ago, Emperor Yuan\u2019s grandfather.1After he abdicated, he began to cultivate in seclusion until he reached the Martial Sage Realm due to the increase in the world\u2019s natural spiritual energy.His existence was what gave Emperor Yuan the confidence to act.The imperial family\u2019s own Martial Sage.11Including Nameless, Emperor Yuan had two Martial Sages in his camp at this moment.Other than that, he also had an army of one million soldiers and countless other powerhouses in the royal family.This was why Emperor Yuan dared to take the risk and declare war against the nine vassal lords.\u201cGrandpa Emperor, I\u2019m running out of time,\u201d Emperor Yuan said with a tired face.The old emperor\u2019s face changed.He reached out his hand and grabbed Emperor Yuan\u2019s wrist, his True Qi probing into Emperor Yuan\u2019s body.\u201cYou practiced that evil cultivation technique?\u201dThe old emperor looked at Emperor Yuan in anger.Emperor Yuan smiled helplessly. \u201cGrandpa Emperor, I need power.\u201d\u201cYou are muddled. Did you already forget that your father died when he was only fifty years old because of practicing this evil cultivation technique? How could you also follow in his footsteps?\u201d The old emperor said with heartache.To the public, the death of his son, the last emperor, was because he had encountered problems in his cultivation along with the illnesses that he had garnered due to the stress of handling state affairs.All of these combined resulted in his situation being untreatable.But the truth was that the previous emperor tried to solve the problems of the nation by forcibly practicing the evilest cultivation technique in the royal family for the sake of power.1However, he failed and it resulted in his untimely death.Originally, the old emperor had sealed the evil cultivation technique after his son\u2019s death. No one else was allowed to come close to it, but Emperor Yuan secretly accessed it unbeknownst to him.\u201cGrandpa Emperor, even though there is a problem in my cultivation, I haven\u2019t achieved anything yet after cultivating this technique. That is why this time, I must sweep away this stubborn illness of the Yuhua God Dynasty that has existed for hundreds of years.\u201dEmperor Yuan stood up firmly and said in a deep voice.\u201cChild, is it worth it?\u201dThe old emperor looked lovingly at his grandson, who was also his successor to the throne.\u201cFor the dignity of the royal family, for the continuation of the Yuhua God Dynasty, for my great reforms, for the people of the world to live and work in peace and contentment\u2026\u201d\u201cI have no regrets even if I die,\u201d Emperor Yuan firmly said.\u201cBesides, I also have one last move.\u201dEmperor Yuan\u2019s gaze fell in the distance, towards the Cold Palace where Lin Jiufeng was in.However, he wouldn\u2019t bother Big Brother unless there was absolutely no other choice.6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was an ancestral hall that had been abandoned for a long time. This was once the ruins of the Chasing Corpse Sect.\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.[Sign-In successful. Received a set of Death Bone Sword Technique!]Lin Jiufeng was delighted.It was unexpected that he would receive an entire set of items after today\u2019s sign-in session.It used to be just a single item or a single technique.There had never been a set before, this was the first time. It might be a precedent.Lin Jiufeng returned to his courtyard from the ruins of the Chasing Corpse Sect.He saw the bone swords inserted all over the ground in the yard. They exuded a cold aura that felt slightly sinister.5These were long swords made of bones and they looked incredibly terrifying.Counting carefully, Lin Jiufeng counted 365 bone swords.1Lin Jiufeng pulled out one of them. He was instantly inundated by a wave of cold energy. However, he wasn\u2019t harmed by the cold energy. Instead, a cooling sensation swept through his body, causing his head to tremble as his spirit was immediately revitalized a hundredfold.1\u201cThese bone swords are in a set, and they seem to have a connection to me.\u201d2Lin Jiufeng looked at the secret manual placed on the table.2Death Bone Sword Technique!Putting down the bone sword, he walked over to look at the secret manual.The texts and the sword strokes depicted inside seemed to have come alive as they rushed into Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.Boom!In Lin Jiufeng\u2019s spiritual consciousness, the complete Death Bone Sword Technique was instantly comprehended by him.He stretched his arm out and raised his hand. Sonorous sounds appeared one after another.In an instant, the 365 bone swords flew up and circled around Lin Jiufeng, making him look like an invincible king of the world.\u201cThe Death Bone Sword Technique is very powerful. With my Martial Will and with the help of my manipulation of the world\u2019s energies, any enemy that stands in front of me are all illusions that can be broken with a flick of my finger.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at the bone swords surrounding him.His confidence was instantly boosted.At this moment, he had lofty sentiments in his heart.Lin Jiufeng then dissipated his own energy as the bone swords fell one after another, inserting themselves into the ground.\u201cUnfortunately, the Death Bone Sword Technique isn\u2019t useful in increasing my cultivation base,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said in regret.This set of swords and technique caused his combat power to skyrocket, but his cultivation realm remained unaffected.After Lin Jiufeng was excited for a short period of time, but after the initial shock, he returned to being calm.He looked upwards.The sky in the imperial capital has been both cloudy and sunny recently.One moment, the sky was cloudless.But in the very next moment, torrential rain was about to come crashing down.It was just like a woman\u2019s attitude, whimsical and changing at will.8\u201cThere have been dark clouds over the Forbidden City lately, it seems that something big is about to happen.\u201d Lin Jiufeng muttered, looking at the sky above the Forbidden City again.Emperor Yuan was rooted in trouble now.He wanted to remove the vassal lords, but the resistance was too great.He was also too anxious to make changes. As a result, the current situation was too unstable.Lin Jiufeng just sighed about this, there wasn\u2019t much that he could do about it.7He was just a dethroned prince, all he could do was to sign in peacefully in the Cold Palace.7Emperor Yuan hadn\u2019t failed yet.So, why should he be in a hurry to make a move?\u2026Late at night!Forbidden City, Central Hall.Emperor Yuan was reviewing the memorials as always.The Forbidden City had witnessed many emperors in countless springs and autumns, but this was the only emperor who was this hardworking.As always, Lin Tianyuan was impressed by his father\u2019s diligence.But at the same time, he was heartbroken.A deeply-ill Yuhua God Dynasty managed to produce an emperor who wanted to change everything for the better. Lin Tianyuan didn\u2019t know whether this was the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s luck, or whether it was Emperor Yuan\u2019s misfortune.\u201cIt\u2019s already late at night, you can go back and cultivate.\u201dSeeing that there was still a large stack of memorials to go through, Emperor Yuan looked at Lin Tianyuan, who was guarding him day and night.Emperor Yuan\u2019s heart felt warm.There were many princes, but none of them could make him feel a sense of ease like Lin Tianyuan.\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019m not tired.\u201d Lin Tianyuan shook his head and said firmly.He would keep standing guard for Emperor Yuan.He hadn\u2019t enjoyed his father\u2019s care for so many years, but as long as he was with his father now, Lin Tianyuan felt very happy.\u201cOkay.\u201d Emperor Yuan revealed an exhausted smile.He continued to revise the memorials, but his heart felt warm inside.\u201cRevising the memorials in the middle of the night, how hardworking\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you revising those memorials to find a way to remove the vassal lords?\u201d Suddenly, a cold snort sounded. A figure appeared outside the Central Hall.The moonlight shone on his body, and a huge shadow was projected into the hall.A meat mountain.2\u201cWho is it?\u201dLin Tianyuan shouted sharply and quickly stood in front of Emperor Yuan, ready for combat.\u201cKou Tiande, it\u2019s the name that I am given and will never change or hide!\u201d said the meat mountain-like man.\u201cKou Tiande!\u201d Emperor Yuan raised his head in surprise.He immediately held Lin Tianyuan back, and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t get involved, this is an order!\u201dLin Tianyuan was pulled aside by Emperor Yuan. He didn\u2019t want him to get involved.\u201cAmong the people who followed the founding emperor in building the nation, there was one named Kou Tiande. What\u2019s his connection to you?\u201d Emperor Yuan stood up.He walked calmly to the center of the hall and asked.\u201cI am that person who fought for the building of your Lin Family\u2019s empire. And now, you actually want to take back the territory that the founding emperor gave to us? Do you think that I don\u2019t exist anymore?\u201d Kou Tiande sneered and said.He was one of the nine vassal lords, and he hurried over here because of the bet.He was the first to rush here to kill Emperor Yuan.1\u201cEvery land in the empire belongs to the emperor, every person in the empire are subjects of the emperor.\u201d\u201cThe territory given to all of you back then was because of your hard work! It was to reward you all, in hopes that you all will manage it well.\u201d\u201cBut to this day, you guys oppress and exploit the people, disobey the laws, groom private soldiers, and even intend to start wars. You guys are a bunch of rogues!\u201d\u201cIt is imperative to remove the vassal lords!\u201dEmperor Yuan didn\u2019t have a huge body and an oppressive aura like Kou Tiande, but his words were firm and loud, his words were the words of a true Emperor.\u201cYou dare to brag so boldly in front of me? In front of someone stronger than you? I shall twist your head off your shoulders today. I\u2019ll let you go and see the founding emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty so that you can kneel in front of him in regret of what you have done.\u201dKou Tiande was furious.1Enraged by Emperor Yuan\u2019s behavior, he grabbed Emperor Yuan, planning to twist his head off.Boom!But in the next second, Nameless rushed out of the dark.With rapid speed, he struck Kou Tiande\u2019s palm with a punch.The sound wave and the energies generated in the collision exploded, directly destroying more than half of the Central Hall and alarming the guards of the Forbidden City.\u201cIs this the reason why you\u2019ve become so bold? Because there\u2019s a Martial Sage hiding in the Forbidden City?\u201d Kou Tiande laughed. Although Nameless successfully stopped him from twisting Emperor Yuan\u2019s head off his shoulders, he remained unscathed.His meat mountain-like body could still move as perfectly as before.\u201cI shall beat up this Martial Sage to bits first and then kill you.\u201dKou Tiande roared and became entangled with Nameless.1Rumble!A fight between two Martial Sages was a battle of massive proportions, it was very terrifying.Emperor Yuan coldly looked at Kou Tiande. He didn\u2019t notice that behind him, a figure had appeared from the shadows.

The scene was similar to the duel at the top of the Forbidden City between two Martial Sages more than 10 years ago.There were three invading Martial Sages, plus two from the royal family.Five Martial Sages were present in the scene.Yesterday, there was only a single known Martial Sage in the world.It was the one in the Forbidden City\u2014Nameless.The other forces with Martial Sages chose to hide them as trump cards.However, the vassal lords were angered by Emperor Yuan\u2019s actions.They chose to reveal the Martial Sages in their camps.For hundreds of years since the Yuhua God Dynasty was founded, there had never been a move to remove the vassal lords.Emperor Yuan\u2019s insistence on removing the vassal lords was a pioneering feat.Therefore, the nine vassal lords didn\u2019t choose to hide their trump cards anymore.They directly exposed them all.Didn\u2019t the Emperor want to eliminate them?Wasn\u2019t he relying on the fact that he had his own Martial Sage?Didn\u2019t he want to rid the empire of its problems?Then, they shall come to the Forbidden City and kill him.It was only after they had done this would they reconcile with the Yuhua God Dynasty.By that time, the next emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty would definitely give up any thought of revenge for Emperor Yuan, and he would also choose to reconcile with them.Remove the vassal lords?He was just dreaming!This was just how confident the nine vassal lords were.\u2026Three Martial Sages appeared one after another, the first two were blocked by Nameless and the old emperor.The third person stood on the top of the Forbidden City, the spot where the Among Flowers Sect\u2019s Patriarch had died. He hurled a javelin at a rapid speed toward Emperor Yuan, causing a terrible and harsh eagle-like shriek as it pierced through the air.1This Martial Sage from King Tianying\u2019s camp looked at this scene coldly, waiting for the javelin to pierce through Emperor Yuan\u2019s body.But what happened in the next was far beyond his expectations.With a cracking sound, the javelin broke.It wasn\u2019t broken by a third party.Because in the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng was still looking at this with a surprised expression.As soon as this Martial Sage\u2019s aura broke out, he noticed it from the Cold Palace.From a few hundred miles away, he was watching this scene calmly, still not planning to make a move because Nameless was in the palace.When the second Martial Sage appeared, Lin Jiufeng only raised his brows, but he still didn\u2019t move.Because the old emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty, who was also Lin Jiufeng\u2019s grandfather, had made his move.So, there wasn\u2019t a need for him to act.But when the third appeared, Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t sit still anymore.He couldn\u2019t possibly sit still as Emperor Yuan was being killed.But before Lin Jiufeng could act, Emperor Yuan roared angrily.Facing the assassination, he directly erupted.Boom! Boom! Boom!An aura that shook the sky filled Emperor Yuan\u2019s body.He tore off his disguise, the disguise of being in the Grandmaster Realm for his true cultivation base was that of the Great Grandmaster Realm.Moreover, he was a Great Grandmaster who practiced a demonic cultivation technique.\u201cThe ancient demonic book. Nine Overlays.\u201d After Emperor Yuan ascended the throne, he had already been preparing for the removal of the vassal lords and had secretly read the demonic cultivation technique that his father cultivated.This demonic cultivation technique was very evil.It consumed one\u2019s life energy in exchange for power.2It would do it little by little every day, and as time passed\u2026The power that would be in one\u2019s hands would only grow even more terrifying.There was nothing that one could do to stop this process. Unless the practitioner managed to reach an incredibly high-level of his cultivation technique, there was nothing that could be done to stop the demonic technique from devouring their own life energy.The last emperor didn\u2019t succeed.Emperor Yuan didn\u2019t succeed either.He gained power, but his life energy at this moment was at its final drops.This was why he was anxious to initiate the removal of the vassal lords.He wanted to solve the problem of the nine vassal lords in the final moments of his life, so he could leave a relatively safe and stable Yuhua God Dynasty to his successor.He didn\u2019t want his successor to inherit a nation that was full of holes and problems.4He didn\u2019t want his successor to be like him\u2014who spent the last ten years solving these problems without much result.Emperor Yuan activated the demonic cultivation technique and used the Nine Overlays skill.At this moment\u2014in terms of power alone\u2014Emperor Yuan was now in the Martial Sage Realm.He held an incredibly strong and violent might in his body.Raising his hand, he easily split the javelin in half.His body floated in the air and dense demonic energy emanated from him.A blood-red light surrounded him.His eyes turned crimson, looking extremely sinister.\u201cForcibly elevating yourself to the Martial Sage Realm, you are just burning your life energy and asking for death.\u201d The Martial Sage who threw the javelin snorted coldly from the top of the Forbidden City, not placing any regard for Emperor Yuan at all.Even if they were on equal footing now, how long could Emperor Yuan continue to burn his life energy?\u201cLong enough for me to kill you.\u201d Emperor Yuan was full of killing intent.\u201cYou could have chosen to be a normal emperor and enjoyed countless glory and wealth, and the ability to have as many women as you want. It\u2019s not like the nine vassal lords will rebel against you. Why do you insist on removing the vassal lords and even burn your life energy to practice a demonic cultivation technique?\u201dThe Martial Sage that threw the javelin felt that Emperor Yuan\u2019s brain was broken.He could have chosen to live through his life happily, being a man of great authority.Yet, he chose the most difficult path? For what purpose?At this moment, Nameless and the old emperor stopped what they were doing.Kou Tiande and the Shadow Assassin also stopped and looked at Emperor Yuan.They also wanted to know why.Although the nine vassal lords were kings in their own territories, and they didn\u2019t listen to the Emperor\u2019s commands, they didn\u2019t actually rebel against him.So, why did Emperor Yuan insist on removing the vassal lords?In the eyes of the vassal lords, it was Emperor Yuan\u2019s own fault causing such a large fuss out of this matter.What\u2019s more, Emperor Yuan even burnt his life energy just for this matter.\u201cWhy?\u201d1The fire of hope in Emperor Yuan\u2019s eyes burned fiercely.He was also asking himself this question.If he chose to live his life like what the Martial Sage had said, he could\u2019ve lived his life in comfort.Be a bad emperor, be a mediocre emperor, be a licentious emperor\u2026Or maybe even as a carpenter emperor\u20261There were so many directions for him to choose from, but why did he choose to try and save this falling nation?How tiring this was!How tough this was!To even sacrifice his own life for this.2In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng looked at Emperor Yuan with a complicated expression on his face.This younger brother of his who had always called him, \u2018Big Brother\u2019 had actually secretly practiced a demonic cultivation technique. Now, he was burning his life energy in exchange for power.Lin Jiufeng knew that this younger brother of his was an idealist and a doer.His motive was very simple, but removing the vassal lords was only the first step.His true motive was to solve the problems of the nation and make it great again.2\u201cBecause I am the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty, the Majesty of the billions of people in the world\u2014the Supreme Ruler\u2014I naturally have the responsibility to seek the welfare of the people of the world, and you guys are one of the root causes that hinder me from all of these.\u201d8He was the Emperor!So he must remove the vassal lords!There was no other reason.Boom!When Emperor Yuan\u2019s voice landed\u2026An extremely terrifying blade light suddenly appeared in the air from more than a hundred meters away.It slashed towards Emperor Yuan, wanting to kill him.\u201cSince you want to remove the vassal lords, then go and die.\u201dIndifferent words filled with killing intent sounded beneath the moonlight, and the fourth Martial Sage appeared.Emperor Yuan was about to fight back.He had the power to fight back.But in the very next moment, a series of terrifying auras appeared to suppress him.Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!Five terrifying auras appeared, representing five Martial Sages.They suppressed Emperor Yuan at the same time.Emperor Yuan spurted blood, unable to move.That huge blade light covering the sky and the earth was about to cut him in half.Nameless and the old emperor hurriedly moved to intervene.But Kou Tiande and the Shadow Assassin stood in their way.Emperor Yuan\u2019s life was at stake.The entire Forbidden City was shocked, countless people looked at this scene in despair.2Nine Martial Sage acted together just to kill Emperor Yuan.Who could save Emperor Yuan now?The suppressed Emperor Yuan\u2019s demonic energy slowly dissipated.In the end, he still failed.\u201cAm I going to die?\u201d Emperor Yuan watched the blade light fall, whispering calmly.When he cultivated with the demonic cultivation technique, he was already prepared to die.But to die in such a place, at such a moment?He was just a bit unresigned.\u201cBig Brother. In the end, I still didn\u2019t succeed in doing something that can change the world.\u201d At the last moments of his life, the person that Emperor Yuan thought of was his biological elder brother who was born from the same mother as him.Lin Jiufeng!\u2026In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng was currently holding the Demon Slaying Sword in his hand.His face was cold and his heart burned in fury.His hand rubbed the Demon Slaying Sword.For more than ten years, he had never seriously and completely executed the [Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill].Because he had no enemy.But now, he had.So, he slashed out with his sword.An extremely splendid and resplendent sword energy appeared like a descending light, surging for hundreds of miles.Boom!At this moment, the sky turned bright.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s thinking too much if he thinks he can save Emperor Yuan!\u201d The Martial Sage who attacked with the blade stood forward, feeling very strong and confident. He didn\u2019t back down, insisting on killing Emperor Yuan.Only by killing Emperor Yuan could he win the bet.He was fixated on obtaining the token of the Holy Master of the demonic sects!\u201cBig Brother!\u201dEmperor Yuan\u2019s body was very weak right now, and he thought that he would definitely die.But this sword energy gave him hope to live.It was his Big Brother who came to his rescue.\u201cYou are unable to kill me!\u201d Emperor Yuan smiled weakly.His faith in his Big Brother was resolute and everlasting.\u201cDie!\u201d The blade light shocked the world, and it directly cut down.Over the Forbidden City, the violent and mighty pressure of this attack directly shattered the surrounding buildings, causing a catastrophic mess.1He wanted to kill Emperor Yuan!The scene was too shocking.The martial art masters in the imperial capital looked at this from a distance, all of them felt extremely nervous.They were unable to intervene in a battle of such a level, just the residual energies from the Martial Sages\u2019 collisions were enough to obliterate them to pieces.\u201cEmperor Yuan is going to be beheaded!\u201d Suddenly, someone exclaimed with his pupils dilated.1Everyone saw that the violent blade light was already slashing down.Some people who couldn\u2019t bear to see the beheading of the emperor couldn\u2019t help but close their eyes.Emperor Yuan was a good emperor.He saved the dying Yuhua God Dynasty.Although the Yuhua God Dynasty wasn\u2019t fully healed yet, everyone saw the benefits that Emperor Yuan had brought to the nation.Many people didn\u2019t want him to die.Clang!At this moment, a divine sword that seemed to have been sealed in dust for thousands of years was unsheathed.The crisp sound it brought echoed in the ears of everyone in the imperial capital.Some people hurriedly looked at the sword energy and exclaimed in surprise.\u201cThe sword energy is here! It looks like Emperor Yuan is going to make it.\u201dPainted in everyone\u2019s eyes was a shocking scene.A sword energy came out from a place hundreds of miles away and almost instantly\u2014it reached the Forbidden City.1Then, the enemies became akin to falling flowers. One after another, they fell onto the ground.They were like beautiful leaves that were cut down as they lost their lives.At this moment, the nine Martial Sages were akin to yellowed dead leaves.3Lin Jiufeng executed his Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.As the sword energy reached its destination, it performed a carpet-style sweeping, killing its targets regardless of anything else.The entire imperial capital shivered under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword light.\u2026Standing on the top of the Forbidden City, the ancestor of King Tianying was captivated by this sword energy.In his eyes, this sword aura was just too beautiful.Inside this sword energy was a picturesque world with beautiful cherry blossoms flying through the sky.2The blossoms gradually charmed his eyes!He didn\u2019t have any thoughts of resisting at all.As this sword energy flew past in front of his eyes\u2026His head also flew up, following the pace of this sword energy.It was all for him to see the beauty of this sword energy for one final second.\u2026He wasn\u2019t the only Martial Sage above the Forbidden City that felt like this.The meat mountain, Kou Tiande, saw the pinnacle of the martial path in this sword energy.What could be considered to be the pinnacle?The person\u2014whom this sword energy belonged to\u2014was the pinnacle.Lin Jiufeng.He vaguely saw Lin Jiufeng under the cold moonlight, like a celestial in white clothes.But there was too much fog around him, so he couldn\u2019t take a clear look at Lin Jiufeng\u2019s face.To see more clearly, he took the initiative and approached this sword energy.Then, he saw Lin Jiufeng\u2019s back.So tall and mighty.\u2026The heads of the nine martial sages were cut off by this single sword energy.None of them managed to resist.Under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword energy, it was like they were committing suicide, all of them died under the mighty power of the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.They didn\u2019t have the willpower that Lin Jiufeng possessed as they were immediately charmed by the sword energy of the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.They were not wronged for dying to it!The people in the Forbidden City and those in the imperial capital couldn\u2019t believe their eyes.3Emperor Yuan was dumbfounded.What appeared in his mind was the figure of his handsome Big Brother.The old emperor opened his mouth wide.His face was splashed with Kou Tiande\u2019s blood, but he didn\u2019t care about it anymore.2In his eyes, there was only the sword energy that appeared just now.Amazing!Superb!Beautiful!Terrifying!\u201cIn the imperial capital, there\u2019s actually such a terrifying cultivator?\u201dThe old emperor was trembling all over.He was filled with excitement.He could finally see hope that the Yuhua God Dynasty could be saved.Nameless looked at this scene calmly.He was an existence similar to a [Wooden Man], he didn\u2019t have any other expression at all.\u201cTeacher\u2026 it\u2019s definitely Teacher!\u201dLin Tianyuan, who was protected by Emperor Yuan, muttered excitedly.In the entire imperial capital, Lin Tianyuan believed in his heart that only Teacher had such a terrifying sword technique.3At this moment, the entire imperial capital went silent for a few seconds.Then, endless cheers and shouts of excitement erupted.Everyone was excited.Beheading the nine Martial Sages with one sword energy.What kind of godly swordsmanship was this?What kind of godly cultivator was this?This night, the Forbidden City was completely in chaos, and everyone fell into a revel.Martial Sage!The realm that countless cultivators dreamed to reach\u2026A single Martial Sage was enough to suppress an entire country.And tonight, twelve Martial Sages appeared in the Forbidden City.Excluding Emperor Yuan who reached this realm through force, there were still eleven of them.Nine Martial Sages wanted to kill Emperor Yuan, and the two martial sages from the Forbidden City could hardly resist them.But at the crucial moment\u2014a hidden senior in the imperial capital killed the nine Martial Sages with a single sword energy.The development that happened was similar to those stories depicted in the manuscripts of legends. The common people talked about this matter with fervent excitement.The martial arts expert who could slay nine Martial Sages with a single sword energy was the guardian of their Yuhua God Dynasty, standing on the side of the royal family.For the common people, this was the happiest thing in the world.Therefore, they started to party.The men, women, old people, and the children\u2014they all cheered.The imperial capital cheered, but the Forbidden City was in sorrow.Lin Jiufeng killed the nine Martial Sages with a single sword attack, which was indeed very powerful and inspiring.But after Emperor Yuan was rescued.They found that he had already reached the limit of his life.Large amounts of life energy had already been devoured from his body just from cultivating that demonic cultivation technique, but if one added the life energies that he had burned to forcibly reach the Martial Sages Realm just now.It was an understatement to say that Emperor Yuan\u2019s life energy was now at his final dredge.Even though the old emperor kept transfusing True Qi into Emperor Yuan\u2019s body, this didn\u2019t stop Emperor Yuan\u2019s body from becoming old and weak.However, Emperor Yuan wasn\u2019t sad.Under the gaze of all the court officials from the imperial court, he opened his eyes and said weakly, \u201cI am running out of time.\u201d\u201cI have been on the throne for more than ten years and I consider myself diligent in my work.\u201d8\u201cThe court officials have changed batch after batch and I have gotten rid of the useless and corrupt. I believe that all of you will fully assist the next emperor to reform the dynasty and bring benefits to the common people.\u201dThe civil and military officials, headed by the Cabinet Chief, couldn\u2019t help but sob as they looked sadly at Emperor Yuan.Emperor Yuan was a good emperor.1\u201cAll of you leave this place, I want to give my orders for some important matters.\u201dEmperor Yuan waved his hand and dismissed everyone else aside from Lin Tianyuan.Including the old emperor.The old emperor sighed sadly.Both his sons and grandsons died young.But rather than saying that they died in the hands of others, it was more accurate to say that they died in the hands of that ancient demonic book.All court officials retreated.But the Queen didn\u2019t.She was Emperor Yuan\u2019s arranged wife that had been decided for him when both of them were still in the wombs of their mothers.At this moment, she knelt on the ground and cried, \u201cYour Majesty, if you want to give your orders for some important matters, you should first establish our son as the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cThen, with the court officials of the imperial court to assist him\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can leave with a peace of mind.\u201dThe Queen wanted to ask for the throne for her son.The court officials watched in silence.\u201cGet out and kneel outside!\u201d Emperor Yuan looked at the expectant prince and said indifferently.2The prince was stunned!And so was the Queen!The court officials looked at each other and knew that Emperor Yuan didn\u2019t favor this prince.They left one after another.But the Queen was unwilling.How could she watch as the throne that belonged to her own son, fall into the hands of others?But before she could speak, she was forcefully supported outside by an old eunuch in the palace.None of the Queen\u2019s majesty was left for her after this incident.In Chaotian Hall, Emperor Yuan\u2019s face was pale.His black hair had already turned white.His breathing was weak as he said, \u201cGo to the Cold Palace and ask your Teacher to come over\u2026\u201d\u201cI wish to see my Big Brother.\u201dLin Tianyuan nodded immediately and was about to go out.\u201cNo need. I\u2019m here,\u201d Lin Jiufeng sighed.He had been watching silently in the Cold Palace.To him, the distance of hundreds of miles could be crossed in an instant.He came to the Chaotian Hall.Seeing the dying Emperor Yuan, Lin Jiufeng felt a sudden pain in his heart.When he saw Emperor Yuan not long ago, his younger brother still looked energetic.Now, he looked to be an old man in his seventies or eighties.The crucial point was that he was only 30 years old.[Do you want to Sign-In before the Chaotian Hall?]At this moment, a line of words appeared before Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t expect that it was already the dawn of the next day. He wasn\u2019t in a mood for anything, so he just casually signed in.[Sign-In successful. Received the Life Resuscitation Technique!]29Life Resuscitation Technique.2It gave one the ability to treat the injured and delay someone\u2019s death.Lin Jiufeng looked at the introduction of the resuscitation technique.His eyes lit up.He didn\u2019t expect that a casual Sign-In would bring him a treasure that could save Emperor Yuan\u2019s life.5Looking at Emperor Yuan\u2019s current state, however, Lin Jiufeng felt that it would be lucky if he could still be saved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In exchange for strength, I have sacrificed too much of my life energy by practicing a demonic technique. Even the gods will find it difficult to save me by now.\u201d Emperor Yuan shook his head.Lin Jiufeng was speechless.1He could only activate the [Life Resuscitation Technique].He spread his hands and injected True Qi into Emperor Yuan\u2019s body.The emerald green light of the Life Resuscitation Technique entered Emperor Yuan\u2019s body and immediately began to repair his body.Emperor Yuan\u2019s pale face surprisingly slowly got better.His breathing became much calmer.Emperor Yuan looked at Lin Jiufeng, surprised. He grabbed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s hand tightly.Lin Tianyuan watched from the side, his eyes revealing how surprised he was.\u201cSir, you are simply too powerful. You are actually able to save Your Majesty.\u201d Lin Tianyuan praised him.Emperor Yuan and Lin Jiufeng were both elated. But Lin Jiufeng was not as happy.He looked at Emperor Yuan with sorrowful eyes.Life Resuscitation Technique could not save Emperor Yuan.1It could only extend Emperor Yuan\u2019s life for a particular period of time.\u201cYour body\u2019s wheel of life had become too exhausted. My True Qi and technique can only extend your life for one month. After that, there is nothing that I can do,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said with a pained look.The requirement for the Life Resuscitation Technique to work was life.Emperor Yuan had burned his life energy to its final vestiges, devoured by the demonic technique.He had\u2026 he had no more life in him anymore.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s expression stiffened.You can only extend his life for a month?Emperor Yuan remained surprised.He grabbed Lin Jiufeng with both his hands and whispered, \u201cBig Brother, thank you.\u201d\u201cWhen I was secretly cultivating that demonic technique, I have already given up on my life.\u201d\u201cI should have died by now\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is already a great blessing that big brother is able to extend my life for one month to deal with some of the aftermath and matters of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d Emperor Yuan was not disappointed.Instead, he was grateful.Lin Jiufeng stopped injecting his True Qi. Life Resuscitation Technique had extended Emperor Yuan\u2019s life for one month.Furthermore, his blood brother seemed more optimistic than him.This lessened Lin Jiufeng\u2019s guilt.\u201cLin Tianyuan!\u201d Emperor Yuan suddenly shouted.Lin Tianyuan jolted and immediately said, \u201cHere!\u201dHe now held the position of the Grand Commander in the Imperial Army.He gave close protection to His Majesty, ensuring Emperor Yuan\u2019s safety.He could be regarded as having rendered a great service.Emperor Yuan looked at Lin Tianyuan with a serious expression.\u201cKneel down in front of your Uncle!\u201dLin Tianyuan looked at Emperor Yuan, shocked.Uncle?2He couldn\u2019t help but look toward Lin Jiufeng.Yes, Lin Jiufeng was his uncle.Real uncle.But he had never greeted him as his uncle.Because he was an illegitimate son, he could not enter the royal family\u2019s genealogy.Hence, he could never address Emperor Yuan as \u2018Royal Father\u2019.When it was just the two of them, and there was no politics involved, only family matters, he could address him \u2018Father\u2019.After he joined the court as a court official, he could only address him as \u2018Your Majesty\u2019 and regarded himself as the latter\u2019s subject.As for Lin Jiufeng, he always had Lin Tianyuan address him as Teacher.Lin Tianyuan had gotten used to it.He had thought it would be like this for the rest of his life.He didn\u2019t expect Emperor Yuan to allow him to address Lin Jiufeng as \u2018Uncle\u2019.What did that imply?Lin Tianyuan was smart, and he had figured it out.Hence, he was shocked.Extremely shocked.After that brief moment of shock, he became scared.He was afraid that Lin Jiufeng would not acknowledge him.He looked at Lin Jiufeng, apprehensive.Lin Jiufeng looked toward Emperor Yuan.Emperor Yuan said softly, \u201cBig Brother, I have laid the foundation for the reform of the Yuhua God Dynasty. If my successor fools around, my efforts over the years will go down the drain and Yuhua God Dynasty will slip into a deep abyss.\u201d\u201cSo, he is the successor that you\u2019ve chosen?\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked at Lin Tianyuan.Unexpectedly, this kid who couldn\u2019t even enter the royal family\u2019s genealogy was chosen as the successor by Emperor Yuan.\u201cYes, he will continue my hope to reform the world.\u201d Emperor Yuan nodded his head.\u201cI hope Big Brother can lend him a hand at critical times.\u201d Emperor Yuan pleaded.Lin Jiufeng scanned Lin Tianyuan.Lin Tianyuan was apprehensive, but he still stood up straight, letting Lin Jiufeng look at him clearly as he waited for the latter\u2019s consent.Without Lin Jiufeng\u2019s consent, he didn\u2019t dare to kneel down.After staying together for 10 years, Lin Tianyuan understood Lin Jiufeng\u2019s character and temper.\u201cKneel down.\u201d Lin Jiufeng nodded.He had watched Lin Tianyuan grow up.He was not a bad successor to the Yuhua God Dynasty.He was definitely better than Emperor Yuan\u2019s other princes\u201cGreetings to Uncle.\u201d Lin Tianyuan knelt down solemnly and kowtowed.\u201cGreetings Royal Father.\u201d Then, he kowtowed to Emperor Yuan.And changed his form of address to him.Instead of addressing him as \u2018Your Majesty\u2019, he changed it to \u2018Royal Father\u2019.\u201cGood. I believe that you can realize my dream and let the billions of people in the world live a good life.\u201d Emperor Yuan revealed a smile. He felt relieved.Now that he had finally chosen his successor, he could finally be at ease.Otherwise, his struggles would have amounted to nothing.\u201cIt\u2019s just a pity that I have spent all my time and had to burn my entire life to reform the Yuhua God Dynasty, yet I didn\u2019t even succeed in removing the vassals.\u201dEmperor Yuan appeared gloomy and helpless.Lin Tianyuan said with certainty, \u201cRoyal Father, I will definitely succeed in removing the vassals.\u201d\u201cYou must not be too hasty, don\u2019t follow my footsteps.\u201d\u201cAlthough your Uncle had exterminated the nine Martial Sages in one stroke, the vassals still have the support of the demonic sects\u2026\u201d\u201cThose from the demonic sects have strange tactics, you have to stand firmly and fight them steadily.\u201d Emperor Yuan shook his head. He finally realized that he had been too hasty in his plan to remove the vassals.\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you are unable to understand, go to your uncle\u2026\u201d\u201cHe will give you pointers,\u201d Emperor Yuan said to Lin Tianyuan.\u201cI understand.\u201d Lin Tianyuan nodded firmly.Lin Jiufeng looked at the pair of father and son.He then said calmly, \u201cOne month is enough time for me to remove the vassals.\u201d\u201cBig Brother!\u201d Emperor Yuan looked at Lin Jiufeng, surprised.He tried to stop Lin Jiufeng.But Lin Jiufeng stood up and said,\u201d Big Brother has never given you any gift.\u201d1\u201cThis time, I will remove the vassals. It will be my gift to you.\u201d\u201cI will do what you wanted to achieve!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said in a loud voice.Emperor Yuan looked at Lin Jiufeng, touched.\u201cUncle, the nine vassals are backed by the demonic sects,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said softly.\u201cThey are just a bunch of worthless people!\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression was indifferent.After killing the nine Martial Sages in one stroke, Lin Jiufeng knew that he was already at the peak amidst this recovery of the world\u2019s energies.He wouldn\u2019t say that he was invincible.But if it was just removing the nine vassals.They would be his gift for Emperor Yuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

To destroy them, I have to do it one by one.\u201dThe geographic locations of territories governed by the nine vassals appeared in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind.The vassal closest to the imperial capital was King Tianying in Qingzhou.His lineage fought alongside the founding emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty when he was building his empire. As a reward, they were assigned to Qingzhou and were given the authority to manage a 100,000 strong army.As this place was considered to be a bottleneck which was the closest to the imperial capital, this was a very important position to manage.But as time passed, thoughts of rebellion grew in the heart of the ancestor of King Tianying. He controlled the entire Qingzhou with the army and gave power to his own people arbitrarily. He turned Qingzhou into his own private domain.He was a vassal, but he changed his own fate and became his own vassal.\u201cLet\u2019s start with Qingzhou first.\u201dLin Jiufeng opened the door of the Cold Palace and walked out with his sword.Qingzhou was more than 10,000 kilometers away.However, this wasn\u2019t a problem for Lin Jiufeng who could soar through the air.\u201cI will destroy the nine great vassals in seven days. I will get back just in time for Dachun to deliver me wine and food.\u201d Lin Jiufeng mentally calculated as he disappeared into the air behind the clouds and the fog.3\u2026Qingzhou.Because he was the closest to the imperial capital, King Tianying was the first to receive the news.It was early morning when he received the news of what happened the night before.After opening the message, he was dumbfounded.\u201cThis\u2026 how is this possible?\u201d After a long time, King Tianying recovered his senses and crushed the letter in his hand. His body began to tremble.\u201cNine Martial Sages, not nine Grandmasters. Yet, they were exterminated by a single sword stroke. Is there such a terrifying expert in the royal family?\u201d King Tianying became anxious.\u201cMy ancestor is also dead, what should I do?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t just sit still and wait to be killed. Emperor Yuan will definitely take the opportunity to suppress me.\u201d\u201cI have to find help.\u201d\u201cBut my ancestor has been killed!\u201d\u201cDo I have to go over and join the demonic sects?\u201dKing Tianying was very troubled. He was apprehensive.He felt as if he would be killed by someone from the imperial capital at any moment.1He hurriedly discarded this idea and muttered to himself.\u201cDon\u2019t scare yourself, Emperor Yuan might already be dead! I still have time to prepare.\u201d\u201cIs this the mansion of King Tianying?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really huge!\u201dQingzhou City, in front of the mansion of King Tianying.A person approached.His clothes were white like snow. His face was handsome, and on his waist was a long black sword. His bearing made one think of the mountains and cypress trees.Then, the man drew his sword.An elegant sword aura quickly spread out after the man drew his long sword.The early morning sun hadn\u2019t completely dispelled the darkness of the night, yetThere was still a little dew on the leaves.The sword energy condensed and it took away the darkness, shook off the dew on the leaves in the area, and then passed through the mansion of King Tianying.King Tianying had just thought of a plan to ensure his safety.Then, suddenly\u2026His pupils dilated as he asked in shock, \u201cWhy is he here so soon?\u201dUnfortunately, no one answered him.The elegant sword energy passed by.It killed King Tianying and everyone else in the mansion, painlessly.4When the first ray of sunlight pierced through the darkness, it shone on King Tianying\u2019s mansion.It was like a mirage, wavering and shrouded in dust.Even a Martial Sage could not possibly withstand this sword energy.Obviously, no one in King Tianying\u2019s mansion was able to withstand it.After executing this one stroke, the young man in front of the mansion turned around, shot straight up into the sky, and headed to the next place.The entire Qingzhou was shocked.The self-proclaimed King of Qingzhou\u2026The Overlord\u2026The arrogant King Tianying\u2014was dead.King Tianying\u2019s mansion, as well as his entire family and sect, was completely destroyed.But who did it?Some people who allegedly witnessed the attacker described the latter as a banished immortal that descended onto the mortal world. With a stroke of his sword, King Tianying\u2019s entire family was slaughtered.1However, others said that he was not a banished immortal, but a real one.1\u2026When Zhao Guogong of the Four Northern Regions received the news, he had the same reaction as King Tianying.He was in a complete daze.\u201cI asked the old ancestor to use poison. There are so many Martial Sages competing. Since we cannot kill him as fast as the others, we should\u2019ve used poison. Why did the old ancestor get into a fight?\u201d Zhao Guogong said, trembling.He was in fear.This kind of fear was from deep inside his heart, and he couldn\u2019t control it.It was akin to people being able to sense their own death but were unable to stop it.They could only watch\u2014watch as they were about to be swallowed by death.That was exactly how he felt.Death was creeping up to him, threatening to swallow him entirely.\u201cNo, I can\u2019t just sit here and wait for death. My ancestor is gone and the Zhao Guogong Manor no longer has anyone to rely on. Now that the royal family has such a terrifying expert, I must find a backer.\u201d Zhao Guogong was very anxious, he knew that the times had changed.The power of the states was overthrown by that man in the imperial capital with a stroke of his sword.\u201cThe demonic sects! The only ones who can save us are the demonic sects.\u201d Zhao Guogong knew that even if he surrendered to the Yuhua God Dynasty, his life would still be forfeit because of what the nine vassals had done.\u201cI can\u2019t surrender no matter what,\u201d Zhao Guogong said firmly.He got up to contact a member of one of the demonic sects.Lin Jiufeng, who had just walked to the front of the Zhao Guogong Manor, smiled.His hearing was amazing, and he heard what Zhao Guogong had said.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then die.\u201d Lin Jiufeng drew his sword lightly and raised his eyebrows.Boom!An elegant sword light swept across the Zhao Guogong Manor.It was already noon.The sun was blazing and the northern lands burned hot like a fiery stove. Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword aura caressed the air, and a powerful flame was born, igniting the entire Zhao Guogong Manor.No one managed to escape!A vassal was annihilated by a great fire.Lin Jiufeng stepped back.Then, he turned around and left.The nine great vassals were in different places. Some were in distant lands and even though Lin Jiufeng could fly, it still took him a significant amount of time to get there.So he didn\u2019t talk with them too much. He simply executed a stroke of his sword whenever he arrived at the right place.No matter how much they talked, they still had to die anyway.Why talk so much to the dead?It was a waste of time!\u2026In the next few days, Lin Jiufeng traveled through the nine regions of the Yuhua God Dynasty.1He killed the nine vassals.Their families and their clans were wiped out together.They did not even have a chance to seek help from the demonic sects.Their deaths happened too fast.This matter shook the world.The Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s Rebellion of the States had ended just like that.The nine vassals were all killed.Who was the killer?Everyone had no doubt that it was the horrifying expert who had killed the nine Martial Sages with one stroke of his sword in the imperial capital.For a while, the world became peaceful.Even the small countries nearby remained quiet, and they did not dare to breach the borders.Some people even said that the mysterious person from the Yuhua God Dynasty was at the peak amidst the recovery of the world\u2019s energies.His cultivation should not be just that of a Martial Sage.There were numerous rumors in the outside world, but Lin Jiufeng ignored them all.He quietly returned to the imperial capital.Entering the Cold Palace\u2026He met Dachun who was delivering his food like usual.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He delivered the goods as usual and began to tell Lin Jiufeng about some of the things that happened in the imperial capital.\u201cSomething big happened in the imperial capital in the past few days. Has Your Highness heard about it?\u201d Dachun asked.\u201cYou are my only source of news, who else can I hear it from?\u201d Lin Jiufeng shook his head.\u201cThe nine great Martial Sages joined forces to come to the Forbidden City to assassinate Emperor Yuan so that he would stop trying to get rid of the vassals\u2026\u201d\u201cBut they were killed by a mysterious man with a sword stroke that stunned the world.\u201d Dachun clicked his tongue, envious of the might that the enigmatic man had showcased.How impressive was that?He chopped off the heads of the nine Martial Sages with just one sword stroke.It was simply an eye-opener.Lin Jiufeng drank his wine and ate meat while listening to Dachun.He smiled calmly without saying much.Other than Emperor Yuan and Lin Tianyuan, who else knew that Lin Jiufeng was the man behind the scenes? Even Dachun who talked to Lin Jiufeng the most would never guess that the mysterious man was Lin Jiufeng.4He knew that Lin Jiufeng had a Martial Sage subordinate.But he also knew that he gave that subordinate to Emperor Yuan.After Dachun told Lin Jiufeng everything that he knew, he continued. \u201cIt seems that Emperor Yuan is on the verge of death. He has already chosen a successor to his throne, and he made his decision known to the world.\u201dLin Jiufeng did not say anything. He knew that too.Lin Tianyuan.\u201cIt was not the few princes that everyone keeps talking about, but an illegitimate son who joined the court as a court official. Emperor Yuan actually made an exception and promoted him to become a member of the royal family and directly appointed him as the next emperor.\u201dDachun was again very envious.That was a huge leap in status.Lin Jiufeng laughed. \u201cWhy do you sound like you\u2019re jealous?\u201d\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be jealous? But I\u2019m just a little envious. If I really became the emperor, I\u2019ll definitely be a foolish and self-indulgent emperor.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s rare\u2014even for the sons of the royal family to become a wise ruler when they became the Emperor. Instead, they usually end up becoming a foolish one.\u201d\u201cHowever, according to a detailed investigation. Emperors usually do not fall into depravity that fast. On average, it takes an emperor\u2014five years after their ascension before they become foolish and self-indulgent.\u201d\u201cAfter that five years, more than 90% of emperors would become depraved.\u201d\u201cIf I were to become an emperor, I wouldn\u2019t need five years. I will only need five days to fall into depravity. I know my own limitations after all.\u201d Dachun laughed.2Lin Jiufeng could not help but smile. \u201cYou know yourself quite well.\u201d\u201cHumans\u2014even if without skills\u2014should at least know their limits.\u201d Dachun nodded and said.2Lin Jiufeng passed the empty plates and wine jar back to Dachun.\u201cYour Highness. I will come back and deliver food for you next time.\u201d Dachun packed the empty plates and turned around to leave.\u201cSee you next time, seven days later.\u201dLin Jiufeng returned to his courtyard.After roaming the world outside, Lin Jiufeng missed the Cold Palace, especially his frost jade bed. Although the bed wasn\u2019t as useful for his cultivation today, it was still soothing to lie on it.It calmed one\u2019s mind and made one less prone to anger.Liu Jiufeng laid on top of it. He closed his eyes and fell into a deep sleep.He had been running about, drawing his sword, and killing his enemies for the past few days without a wink of sleep.1From the south to the north, Liu Jiufeng never stopped for a moment.He was both physically and mentally tired.After all, he had to visit nine different places, running back and forth.Seven days without sleep along with the intense expenditure of his True Qi. Lin Jiufeng might be a Martial Sage, but he reckoned that even if his True Qi became akin to that of water which was universally available. He would still find it hard to continue at such a pace without any rest.2Lin Jiufeng fell into a deep sleep on the frost jade bed, resting quietly.Half a month passed in a flash.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body had finally returned to its peak condition.His plans, however, were still the same.He planned on continuing his routine of signing-in inside the Cold Palace.At this moment\u2014the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s Crown Prince\u2014Lin Tianyuan, came to his door.\u201cUncle.\u201d Lin Tianyuan pushed open the door of the Cold Palace and shouted respectfully.\u201cYou should be dealing with state affairs and familiarizing yourself with the process of dealing with them at this time, why have you come to my place?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked, surprised.\u201cUncle. Father\u2026 Father can\u2019t hold on any longer,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said sadly.Lin Jiufeng frowned and said, \u201cDoesn\u2019t he have a month to live?\u201dOnly twenty or so days had passed since then.There were still eight or nine days remaining.\u201cFather personally taught me how to deal with state affairs day and night. He stayed up late every night and did everything that he could to persevere. But this morning, he finally fell into a coma and hasn\u2019t woken up since,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said sadly.\u201cThe imperial doctors tried to treat him, but they all said that he was at the end of his life.\u201d\u201cI came to ask Uncle to see Father one last time,\u201d Lin Tianyuan knelt down and said, depressed.He knew that his Father would want to see his own brother before he took his last breath.Hence, he came personally to invite Lin Jiufeng.\u201cGo back and clear the hall for me. I\u2019ll set off right away.\u201dLin Jiufeng said after a moment of silence.At his brother\u2019s final moments, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want anyone to disturb the two of them.\u201cOkay, I will take care of everything.\u201d Lin Tianyuan nodded his head and left respectfully.He knew that Lin Jiufeng preferred a quiet environment with fewer people around, so he went back to clear the hall.\u2026Great Council Hall!This was where Emperor Yuan fell into a coma.He was teaching Lin Tianyuan how to handle state affairs until his last waking moments.He always remembered the words that his elder brother once told him.Ruling a country was like cooking a small fish!A small problem that involved hundreds of millions of people would ultimately become a shocking problem to behold.Hence, he didn\u2019t dare to be careless.He worked like a horse to the point of fainting inside this Great Council Hall.1Lin Tianyuan understood his father\u2019s character. This was why he did not distract Emperor Yuan.In the final moments of Emperor Yuan\u2019s life, he planned on letting him die peacefully in the place he was familiar with the most.The people in the Great Council Hall were dismissed and were told to stand quietly outside the hall.Three layers of security inside and outside.Everyone\u2019s faces were solemn.And in the hall, a dim lamp tenaciously wavered in the dark.Just like Emperor Yuan.He was trying as hard as he could\u2014just so he could see his big brother one last time before he was no more.Da da da!The sound of steady footsteps echoed in the Great Council Hall.Lin Jiufeng looked at the haggard Emperor Yuan. He went forward to cover him with a quilt.When they were younger, this was how the older Lin Jiufeng took care of the younger Emperor Yuan.In the final moments of his life\u2026Emperor Yuan grabbed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s hands and said with hopes in his eyes.\u201cBig Brother, have I lived up to the position as the Crown Prince?\u201d\u201cI have not let you down, right?\u201d8In the end, what Emperor Yuan cared about was still whether his elder brother was disappointed in him or not.After all, he inherited his elder brother\u2019s position as the Crown Prince and then became the Emperor after that for ten short years. He tried to eliminate the vassals, yet his elder brother still had to help him wrap everything up.He was afraid of disappointing his Big Brother.That was what he was most afraid of.Hence, he held Lin Jiufeng\u2019s hand very tightly.So tight that his green veins turned visible underneath his wrinkled skin.But he himself\u2014didn\u2019t seem to have realized it.In his eyes, there was only Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng smiled gently.He leaned close to Emperor Yuan and whispered. \u201cBrother, Big Brother is proud of you.\u201d\u201cYou have never let me down\u2014even once.\u201dHearing that, Emperor Yuan broke into a smile and slowly retracted his hands.Then, his hands slowly lost their strength and drooped down\u2026Yuhua God Dynasty, Yuan era, Fifteen years.Emperor Yuan passed away.21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A sense of emptiness washed over him.This person was the person who was closest to him in this world.They were born to the same mother.Connected by blood.They never had a disagreement with each other.1Emperor Yuan was so much younger than him.And he left just like that.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s heart, his hands, and his eyes trembled slightly.He didn\u2019t say anything.He simply closed Emperor Yuan\u2019s eyes and then spoke tiredly to Lin Tianyuan.\u201cYour father\u2026 is gone.\u201dOutside the hall, Lin Tianyuan said mournfully to his guards. \u201cHis Majesty has passed away!\u201dAs soon as he spoke these words, sounds of crying reverberated.The Grand Secretary and the other senior members of his court even desperately rushed into the hall, wanting to see Emperor Yuan for one final time.Each of them used to be depressed scholars. In this world where cultivators had all the power, they were unable to make their ambitions come true.1But Emperor Yuan invited them to his court and gave them a stage to fulfill their aspirations and show off their talents.To ordain conscience for Heaven and Earth, to secure life and fortune for the people, to continue the lost teachings of past sages, and to establish peace for all future generations!2These four sentences were the lifelong pursuit of scholars.Under Emperor Yuan\u2019s command, they were able to realize all of them.They reformed the evils of the dynasty and worked hard to remove the vassal kings. They suppressed the high and mighty privileged families and prevented the annexation of land by these people. They saved the refugees and gave them a place to settle\u2026These things were nothing in the eyes of cultivators.But for them, these were the things for which they would strive to achieve in their entire lives.All of these were realized under the command of Emperor Yuan.Emperor Yuan was worthy of being an emperor through the ages.Although his reign was short, his influence was far-reaching.The grief of the court officials was real.They rushed into the hall and upon seeing Emperor Yuan lying on the bed, motionless.They cried.2Some even fainted on the spot.Lin Tianyuan didn\u2019t grieve.He asked the guards and eunuchs to take the court officials who had fainted from crying somewhere safe and help them come back to their senses.He raised his eyes and looked into the hall.Lin Jiufeng was nowhere to be seen.He mentally heaved a sigh of relief. His Uncle should have already taken his leave.Lin Tianyuan put his mind at ease and started to deal with the funeral.He let the ministers cry for a while, then he brought the coffin over and placed Emperor Yuan\u2019s body inside\u2026Lin Tianyuan handled these in an orderly manner.His face was sad, but he did not shed a tear.It wasn\u2019t until Emperor Yuan\u2019s body was placed into the coffin that Lin Tianyuan knelt down and cried, heartbroken.From today onwards, he no longer had a father!He had been forcibly holding back his grief until this.In the Great Council Hall, the literary officials and the military commanders sobbed sorrowfully.The entire Forbidden City was filled with sorrow.But Lin Jiufeng\u2014who Lin Tianyuan thought had left\u2014had been in the hall all along.He was standing right next to the coffin of Emperor Yuan.But no one could see him.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation base allowed him to modify the space around his body.In addition, with his cultivation base stronger than anyone else in this hall\u2026No one detected his presence.When Emperor Yuan\u2019s body was placed into the coffin, Lin Jiufeng also wept.He stroked the copper coffin, full of reluctance on his face.2\u2026Lin Jiufeng stayed in the Great Council Hall for three days.During these three days, people came and went.All the civil and military officials\u2026Anyone who was affiliated or related to the royal family came to pay their respects to Emperor Yuan.But no one saw Lin Jiufeng.Three days later, Emperor Yuan\u2019s body was buried in Emperor Mountain.This was the imperial cemetery of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Because Emperor Yuan was very young, his tomb had yet to be renovated.It was just a very ordinary tomb.Lin Jiufeng watched as Emperor Yuan\u2019s coffin was being carried out of the Council Hall.When the crowd disappeared from his eyes, it finally dawned on him.His younger brother was gone.Lin Jiufeng accompanied him on his final journey.His heart was filled with sadness. He wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes.Lin Jiufeng was about to leave the empty Council Hall.Emperor Yuan was gone and there was no longer anything left for him in the Forbidden City.He wanted to return to the Cold Palace and remain within it.He did not want to get too deeply involved with the outside world.Lin Jiufeng hated this kind of parting.[Do you want to Sign-In at the Forbidden City Great Council Hall?]A line of words appeared before Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.He was stunned.He had been in the council hall for three days already, but this line only appeared today.\u2018Was it because I was too sad before?\u2019 Lin Jiufeng thought to himself.\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng agreed.[Sign-In successful. Received Heaven Patching Technique!]3A peerless skill appeared in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind.\u201cThis\u2026 this doesn\u2019t seem like a martial arts manual, but a terrifying daoist manual.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s mind cleared up.He didn\u2019t study the Heaven Patching Technique in the Great Council Hall.Instead, he left the hall and returned to the Cold Palace. There, he began to cultivate it.\u2026Cold Palace.After Lin Jiufeng returned, he closed the door tight and stayed in his courtyard.He laid on the frost jade bed, studying the Heaven Patching Technique.The Heaven Patching Technique was a terrifying secret technique that utilized the will of martial arts to perceive the general situation of the world and use that as leverage to strengthen one\u2019s Martial Will.The Heaven Patching in the technique meant that one would become so strong that they were able to patch up the sky.This was not just an offensive skill, it was also a restorative one.\u201cI haven\u2019t advanced much since I broke through the Martial Sage Realm. I can use this Heaven Patching Technique to cultivate.\u201d Lin Jiufeng closed his eyes with satisfaction. He channeled True Qi throughout his body and cultivated the Heaven Patching Technique.1As for matters of the outside world, Lin Jiufeng had no interest in them at all.The Yuhua God Dynasty should be very stable by now.After all, he had just gone out for a walk.Just as Lin Jiufeng thought, the outside world was turbulent.Countless great forces were constantly in contact with each other.But no one dared to come forward.Even though Emperor Yuan was dead.Even though the Yuhua God Dynasty was mourning at a national level.There was no one foolish enough to make trouble at this time.After all, as long as they were not stupid, they would not choose to cause trouble at this timing.Creating trouble when the entire Yuhua God Dynasty was grieving, were they tired of living?Even if one was not afraid of the soldiers from the Yuhua God Dynasty, were they not afraid of that sword hidden in the imperial capital?Many forces were investigating frantically to find out the identity of that mysterious man.But they found nothing.Because most people in the Yuhua God Dynasty did not know his identity either.Perhaps only Emperor Yuan and the newly enthroned emperor knew.But would they tell them?When the identity of the opponent was shrouded in mystery, and there was no way to resist such an enigmatic enemy. It was best to stay put and be quiet.Emperor Yuan passed away and the whole country was in grief.After the mourning period, the new emperor ascended the throne.Lin Tianyuan changed the era of his reign from [Yuan] to [Ming].7This year would be the first year of the Yuhua Ming era.After he ascended the throne, he had to deal with many things right off the bat. With the assistance of the various court officials, he methodically took over everything left behind by Emperor Yuan. Then, he continued along the path that Emperor Yuan had set for him.During this period, Lin Jiufeng never left the Cold Palace.Lin Tianyuan didn\u2019t come to trouble Lin Jiufeng either.Time flew by and five years passed.In the past five years, Lin Tianyuan had established himself firmly on the throne.He did not trouble Lin Jiufeng even once.Many people had forgotten that there existed a dethroned prince in the Yuhua God Dynasty.Lin Jiufeng had lived through three dynasties.As for why there weren\u2019t a lot of people that still remembered him?It was because he was extremely low-key.10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Yuhua God Dynasty welcomed a new emperor, and the world also welcomed a period of stability.For five years, Lin Tianyuan, the Ming Emperor, continued Emperor Yuan\u2019s reform.He worked hard to settle the land annexations, suppressing the aristocratic families, and taking in the refugees. All in all, this was the continuation of Emperor Yuan\u2019s ideals.In addition, he thoroughly cleaned up the lands that the nine vassals had previously occupied.He also launched a hunt for the rebels that had close connections to the vassals.In time, the persistent problems that had plagued the Yuhua God Dynasty for hundreds of years were eventually solved by Lin Tianyuan.The entire dynasty and the public praised his great work.But Lin Tianyuan did not get carried away, he knew that this was not his own work.He was just in charge of tying up the loose ends, cleaning up the battlefield.The real problems have already been settled by his uncle in the Cold Palace.Five years since ascending the throne, he had been too busy with state affairs to see his uncle.Of course, part of the reason was that Lin Jiufeng did not like to be disturbed.Lin Tianyuan, on the other hand, didn\u2019t dare to slack off. He was afraid of letting his father down.Lin Tianyuan, the second Emperor Yuan, became intoxicated with state affairs.He was constantly approving or revising memorials day and night.He did not dare to slack off\u2014even for a moment.2\u2026Cold Palace.For five years, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s appearance did not change at all.However, his aura became more ethereal and profound.Those who had seen him would understand what it meant for one to become as beautiful as jade.2Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword still gleamed like a rainbow all this while.In the past five years, Lin Jiufeng never left the Cold Palace.He comprehended the Heaven Patching Technique and was constantly improving himself.Lin Jiufeng estimated that the outside world would be peaceful for a while.That trip that he made seemed to be rather impactful.Before the ambitious people did anything, they had to think over whether they could withstand that sword from the imperial capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Hence, even though the current was turbulent beneath that calm sea.No one dared to sacrifice themselves first and become someone else\u2019s stepping stone.In line with Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expectations, every time Dachun came to the Cold Palace to report in the past five years, he had never said anything about any major events that happened in the outside world.4As a result, all he talked about were insignificant matters.For example, Dachun got married and had a child. He was also promoted.6Lin Jiufeng listened to Dachun quietly as he spoke.Dachun was his only source when it came to news about the outside world.1Today, Lin Jiufeng laid on the frost jade bed, sighing.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity. I\u2019ve been cultivating the Heaven Patching Technique for five years. This secret technique is profound, and it has improved my body and fixed some of my past issues. But I still haven\u2019t broken through to the second step of the Martial Sage Realm.\u201dThe first step of the Martial Sage, Profound Insight.Second Step of the Martial Sage, Life Knowing.2Third Step of the Martial Sage, Fish Leap.Fourth Step of the Martial Sage, Great Sage.Lin Jiufeng was at the peak of the first step of the Martial Sage Realm.He stood at the peak of the pinnacle.He had already understood the subtleties of martial arts, and he was currently peering into the greatness of the world.The Heaven Patching Technique had patched some of the past issues that Lin Jiufeng had been suffering from.He felt complete.But he couldn\u2019t break through the bottleneck.It seemed like he was lacking something.But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t know what he was lacking.2Lin Jiufeng said regrettably, \u201cMaking a breakthrough in my cultivation has become significantly difficult ever since I entered the Martial Sage Realm. It\u2019s no longer as quick as before.\u201d3Although he was a little disappointed, he was not impatient.If five years was not enough, he would spend another five years.Lin Jiufeng was not young. He was already in his forties, almost fifty.In his previous life, he would\u2019ve already been a weathered middle-aged man.But now, he was still young and relatively stable mentally.He continued to Sign-In in peace.Although the Cold Palace was big, Lin Jiufeng had already visited all the places that he could possibly use to Sign-In.Hence, Lin Jiufeng decided to start exploring the underground area of the Cold Palace.There must be several layers of areas underneath a palace of this size.Back then, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t bother exploring the area underneath the palace since he still had enough places to Sign-In from. But now, he wanted to explore underground.But now, he wanted to explore it.3\u2026Outside the imperial capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty, a group of people was looking at the imperial capital from a remote hilltop.They were dressed in very old-fashioned clothes. They looked completely out of place with the current fashion trend. Their clothes seemed to be from hundreds of years ago.The leader was an elderly man with a dark complexion, dry skin, and hands similar to chicken claws.He was looking at the imperial capital.\u201cCorpse Elder, you\u2019ve been searching for over three days now. Have you seen anything?\u201d A strong man behind Corpse Elder asked helplessly.\u201cButcher, do you know what I\u2019m looking at?\u201d Corpse Elder asked without turning around.The strong man nicknamed Butcher, who had his arms folded in front of his chest shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at. But I know that no matter how much you look, you will not be able to get the treasure in the relics of my Chasing Corpse Sect.\u201dThe others nodded, agreeing with Butcher.These people were members of the Chasing Corpse Sect. They had been in hiding for so many years.Corpse Elder was the leader of the group. Instead of leading them to the imperial capital, he remained in the deep forest and only looked at the imperial capital from a distance which made Butcher unhappy.\u201cDo you all know about that One Sword in the imperial capital?\u201d Corpse Elder sneered.\u201cOf course, who wouldn\u2019t? There\u2019s an unpredictable One Sword hidden in the imperial capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty. But we\u2019re here to look for the treasures in the relics of the Chasing Corpse Sect, not to fight,\u201d Butcher said helplessly.He thought that Corpse Elder was being too careful.But he didn\u2019t expect that he would become so timid after hiding for hundreds of years.\u201cSince you know about it, do you still think that I\u2019m being too careful?\u201d Corpse Elder asked.\u201cSo what have you learned after these three days of watching?\u201d Butcher asked.\u201cNothing.\u201dCorpse Elder shook his head.\u201cOne Sword has hidden himself well. I cannot see anything.\u201d\u201cThen, are you going to continue looking?\u201d Butcher squinted helplessly at Corpse Elder.\u201cNo more watching.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s enter the imperial capital\u2026\u201d\u201cBut remember. No causing trouble and no revealing your auras.\u201d\u201cEspecially you, Butcher\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that you have broken through to the Martial Sage Realm. But still, don\u2019t do anything reckless.\u201d Corpse Elder warned Butcher.\u201cI know. This is the imperial capital. To Martial Sages, this is the most dangerous place in the world. I don\u2019t want to be killed by a sword flying through the skies from out of nowhere. I will be very careful.\u201d Butcher decisively agreed.Looking at the serious Butcher, Corpse Elder didn\u2019t say anything anymore.He waved his hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the imperial capital now. It\u2019s about to go dark, so let\u2019s take advantage of the night to look for the treasures.\u201dButcher was overjoyed. He immediately followed Corpse Elder to the imperial capital.After passing the scrutiny of the city guards, they finally managed to enter the imperial capital.They hovered around the Cold Palace, patiently waiting for nightfall.\u201cThis palace is so big, why is it deserted?\u201dButcher asked curiously as he looked at the huge palace.The Cold Palace was big, but it was dilapidated.No one came to maintain the place.In fact, some parts of the outer wall were already peeling off, revealing red bricks inside.\u201cThis is a place where only the losers of the royal struggle of the Yuhua God Dynasty come to stay. Do you think that anyone would want to come voluntarily here?\u201d Corpse Elder calmly asked.Night came and the world darkened.Corpse Elder and Butcher moved rather quickly after nightfall.\u201cThe relics of the Chasing Corpse Sect are here.\u201d\u201cEveryone, be on your toes. Don\u2019t act rashly,\u201d Corpse Elder said.The group of people immediately jumped over the wall and entered the Cold Palace.\u201cHey, there\u2019s a courtyard with some lights in here.\u201dButcher found Lin Jiufeng\u2019s courtyard and he wanted to take a look.\u201cDon\u2019t go there. I\u2019ve done my research. There\u2019s a dethroned crown prince who is also Emperor Yuan\u2019s brother living in this Cold Palace. He\u2019s been here for decades. I think he must\u2019ve already gone mad. Let\u2019s carry on with our search, don\u2019t provoke him.\u201dCorpse Elder grabbed Butcher and stopped him with a solemn look.Butcher could only give upThey walked deep into the Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng, who was in his own courtyard, wore a strange look on his face.2There were actually thieves sneaking into this godforsaken cold palace?And they even said that he has gone mad?4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looks like a mummy but this is just his appearance. There is a huge blood pill in his dantian, once activated he will instantly be able to return to his peak.\u2019\u2018The other one looks like a hoodlum with ample vital and life energy. These two are in the Martial Sage Realm.\u2019\u2018Other than the two of them, the rest are nothing to worry about.\u2019Lin Jiufeng murmured in his heart.Strictly speaking, he didn\u2019t actually have to worry about Corpse Elder and Butcher.But they were still Martial Sages\u2026Lin Jiufeng had to show them some respect due to their prestige.\u201cThis Cold Palace of mine is already so dilapidated. Other than having an area of extremely negative energy deep underground, there\u2019s only the ruin of the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2026\u201dLin Jiufeng guessed the background of the other party.It was because this scene already happened 15 years ago.Back then, two members of the Chasing Corpse Sect snuck inside the Cold Palace, looking for the corpse of the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2019s Patriarch.They were discovered by Lin Jiufeng.He killed those two people and even turned the corpse of the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2019s Patriarch into Nameless who was now a guardian of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Lin Jiufeng remembered this matter vividly.1He also remembered the conversation of those two back then.They said the Chasing Corpse Sect was planning to come to light and reveal themselves into the world 10 years later.Lin Jiufeng has been waiting for them all this time.To think that it would take the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2014fifteen years before they dared to send another batch of their people into the Cold Palace.\u201cI acquired Nameless back then, thanks to you people. I wonder, what will I obtain from you all this time?\u201d Lin Jiufeng observed the intruders with both of his hands behind his back. He didn\u2019t disturb them in their exploration.2He just watched.Even the Martial Sages did not sense Lin Jiufeng\u2019s gaze.They were focused on their tasks at hand as they took all sorts of measurements in the Cold Palace, searching for the specific location of what they were looking for.Butcher and Corpse Elder were in charge of the situation. The others were just convenient tools for them to use. They were only here because they were necessary to find the relic treasures of the Chasing Corpse Sect.Butcher looked helplessly at his subordinates who were engrossed in their search.He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cSay, why didn\u2019t the old ancestor bring the relic treasures away?\u201dHe simply didn\u2019t understand.Wouldn\u2019t it be for the best if the old ancestor took the treasures away with him when the Chasing Corpse Sect moved away back then? If that happened, then they wouldn\u2019t have to take the risk of coming to the imperial capital to look for the treasures in secret.They didn\u2019t dare to make a stir.They were afraid that a streak of sword energy would suddenly come flying in their way.Corpse Elder heard Butcher\u2019s complaints.After looking around, he said in a low voice. \u201cThe sect elders all claimed that the initial move away from this place was because they felt that this place was unsuitable for the sect. Do you believe that?\u201d\u201cBullsh*t!\u201d Butcher only had this one word in response.\u201cOur Chasing Corpse Sect was established more than a thousand years ago, we earned glory 800 years ago and it lasted for more than 200 years.\u201d\u201cAt that time, among the mountains of the world and the famous rivers, which of them were unsuitable for burying the corpses of our Chasing Corpse Sect?\u201d\u201cBecause we got too complacent with snatching bodies from all places subsequently, we incurred the wrath of the public. Those on the orthodox path and the demonic sects took advantage of that to join their forces in an alliance to deal with us.\u201d\u201cEven the imperial court suppressed us, driving us away like a pack of disowned dogs.\u201d\u201cWe were forced to move our sect away. But we were in too much of a hurry that we didn\u2019t even dig out the corpse of our Patriarch. Some of our relic treasures were also left and forgotten amidst the haste.\u201dButcher pursed his lips and shared a section of the past.The past of the Chasing Corpse Sect.The Chasing Corpse Sect from those days of yore had grown too complacent due to their uninhibited growth. They snatched bodies from all places to the extent that they incurred the unanimous anger of the masses.1The Yuhua God Dynasty was founded 400 years ago.The Yuhua God Dynasty was only established after the Chasing Corpse Sect moved away.With the previous area left by the Chasing Corpse Sect serving as their imperial capital, they continuously expanded their territories.As for that prince that constructed the Cold Palace.The truth was that he was a victim.He was deceived and treated this area of extremely negative energy that was the ruins of the Chasing Corpse Sect as a treasured place.1The palace was built.The exterior was magnificent, but the interior remained superficial.No one even bothered to clean up the interior of the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2019s ruins.Then, that prince\u2019s health gradually declined.His luck also worsened and he soon committed a huge blunder.Until now, this place became the famous Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng eavesdropped on the conversation of the two from a spot not too far away from them.He was already so close, yet the two Martial Sages didn\u2019t notice him.This proved Lin Jiufeng\u2019s true capabilities.Even though the three of them were at the Profound Insight step of the Martial Sage Realm, the true gap between them was similar to the gap between the sky and the sea. They couldn\u2019t be compared with each other at all.\u201cAs you have said, we were being driven away back then.\u201d\u201cWe couldn\u2019t take these things, so we left them here, thinking that we\u2019re going to make our return in the future anyway. But the Yuhua God Dynasty was established following that, our Chasing Corpse Sect also went into turmoil and we had to move into the shadows.\u201d\u201cUp till now, we still haven\u2019t retrieved them,\u201d said Corpse Elder.\u201cThen, what exactly are there in the so-called relic treasure beneath this palace?\u201dButcher asked softly.Lin Jiufeng listened seriously.He wanted to know too.This was his territory after all. If there were treasures, they naturally belonged to him.\u201cThe so-called relic treasure is just a way of saying it.\u201d\u201cWe established the sect here because we discovered that there was a palace with extreme negative energy at the bottom of this area with its doors tightly shut. However, the sect had to move away before we got the chance to explore it.\u201d Corpse Elder lowered his voice as he explained.Their voices were very\u2014very soft\u2014afraid of outsiders eavesdropping on their conversation.Lin Jiufeng was somewhat far away.He took a few steps forward and arrived at a measly distance of five meters from them.However, they still didn\u2019t discover Lin Jiufeng\u2019s presence.At this moment, Lin Jiufeng pulled the world\u2019s energies that he had tried his best to understand over these five years onto himself.Indescribable waves instantly devoured Lin Jiufeng.The waves made him blend with the universe.Universe and Human as one!As Lin Jiufeng stood there, he became one with the universe.So long as he didn\u2019t speak or execute a technique, these two people wouldn\u2019t be able to detect his presence.Of course, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s current limit was at five meters.If these two weren\u2019t at the Martial Sage Realm, even if Lin Jiufeng were to attack them right in front of their eyes. They would never discover his presence even in the slightest.Butcher exclaimed in surprise. \u201cI see. Then, we should go and open up that place right away, so we can bring the treasures away.\u201dUpon the mention of treasures, Butcher\u2019s mood was uplifted.\u201cWe came here to survey, that\u2019s it. Once we\u2019ve found that place, we have to return and report it to the Sect Leader. He will come here personally.\u201d Corpse Elder shook his head, extinguishing Butcher\u2019s hope of retrieving the treasures by himself.Butcher mumbled, \u201cThen, we\u2019ll wait for the Sect Leader to come here before opening it.\u201d\u201cIn any case, leaving those treasures in the Cold Palace is quite safe\u2026\u201d\u201cNo one will disturb them, and we also have a dethroned crown prince keeping guard for us,\u201d said Corpse Elder with a smile.\u201cYes, that dethroned crown prince probably still has no idea that there are so many secrets hidden below this Cold Palace.\u201d Butcher also smiled.2Watching their subordinates doing their jobs was a little boring, so they made fun of Lin Jiufeng.But unbeknownst to them, that same Lin Jiufeng that they were mocking was standing just five meters away from them. He stood there as he watched them coldly.\u201cJust continue to be smug for a while\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll wait until your subordinates are done inspecting before I\u2019ll settle the scores with you two.\u201dLin Jiufeng remained calm as usual.The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind.8After searching for about four hours, someone finally reported.\u201cWe have found the entrance to the underground passage!\u201dThe eyes of Butcher and Corpse Elder lit up. They walked over in a hurry.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes also brightened. He leisurely followed the two in their footsteps.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It is used to hide things from the eyes of other people and make those objects impossible for them to find.\u201d\u201cOne obverse and inverse\u2026\u201d\u201cOnly a collision of the two will open the original entrance.\u201dButcher hugged his arm and urged. \u201cHurry up! Cut the crap.\u201dCorpse Elder spent about 20 minutes setting up the array formation.Lin Jiufeng watched through the entire process, the questions in his heart finally had an answer.\u201cI see, they set up an array formation to cover the eyes of others. No wonder nobody discovered it throughout the few hundred years that passed.\u201dAlthough he had a formidable cultivation base, Lin Jiufeng was never skilled in array formations.1To be frank, he had no clue about array formations at all.\u201cIn the future, I need to get some manuals concerning the concept of array formations and pills. Hopefully, I\u2019ll be able to get them from signing in.\u201d Lin Jiufeng made a mental note of this.5He watched as Corpse Elder completed the array formation.Then, the two array formations, one obverse, and the other inverse, exploded.Right beneath the hundred-year-old big tree, a passageway appeared.It was a passageway that led deep underground.After having sealed for hundreds of years, moss could be seen everywhere.Without saying anything, Butcher moved and pulled open the entrance of the passageway.He anxiously wanted to go down.Corpse Elder also watched curiously.But at that moment, a golden radiance suddenly exploded from the dim passageway. It instantly killed both Butcher and Corpse Elder.They stood there, indignant, as they held their throats. They wanted to say something, but no words could come out of their mouths.They collapsed.This change stunned the people of the Chasing Corpse Sect as they screamed out loud.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s gaze also turned cold as he observed solemnly.Corpse Elder and Butcher were both Martial Sages.They might be not that powerful among Martial Sages considering that they were only at the first step of Profound Insight.However, they were still Martial Sages.Someone that had the ability to instantly kill them was strong enough for Lin Jiufeng to take them seriously.Especially when that person was amidst these secret treasures.But contrary to Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expectations, the killer wasn\u2019t a person.But a cat.3A snow-white cat that looked very elegant.There were only two spots on its body each with a different color.Its pupils were black, like thick ink, so black that they seemed to have their own luster.2The other spot was its claws, they were dark gold in color.1That speck of golden radiance earlier was it seizing the chance to strike, using its claws to end the lives of both Corpse Elder and Butcher.Meow!The snow-white cat opened its mouth and let out a cry.Its voice was akin to a languid young girl, very beguiling.1But a few whooshes commenced and it transformed into a white shadow that wiped out everyone from the Chasing Corpse Sect.A few seconds ago, the people of the Chasing Corpse Sect stood here, alive. Under the leadership of two Martial Sages, they wanted to dig out the secret treasures that belonged to them in the first place.But at this moment, they were now corpses that could not speak.1The culprit was a white cat.1Its hair was not an ordinary shade of white, but a glossy transparent crystal-like kind of white.Its small body paced on the floor.Its claws were stained with spots of blood.After having witnessed what just happened, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression turned weird.It was a cat at the Martial Sage Realm!This was rare.After killing everyone, the white cat meowed and was about to enter the cave.However, its hairs suddenly stood on its ends. Its body arched upwards.With a sharp cry, it stared fixedly in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s direction.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s surprise had inadvertently released a trace of his aura that was immediately detected by the sensitive white cat.It acted as if it was facing a formidable enemy.Seeing this, Lin Jiufeng no longer disguised himself.He revealed his figure and remained in the same spot.Meow!The white cat immediately launched an attack. At a blazing speed, its claws burst out, a sharp golden glow slashed across, seeking to end Lin Jiufeng\u2019s life.But Lin Jiufeng combined two fingers to act as a sword, a sword technique from Sword Twenty-Two broke out.Boom!The white cat was thrown upside down onto the ground.Although it was able to kill Butcher and Corpse Elder, it was no match for Lin Jiufeng.\u201cYou are probably the guardian of this underground secret treasure. You remained underground throughout the years, and that is why you killed those people who tried to invade your underground territory.\u201d Lin Jiufeng calmly deduced.The white cat was sent flying, but Lin Jiufeng did not kill it, he only inflicted a few injuries to it.But the white cat knew that it was no match against Lin Jiufeng.It turned around, wanting to escape.But Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t going to let it go anywhere.Grabbing the cat with his large hand, frightening amounts of True Qi and even his Martial Will weighed down against the cat. The amalgamation of these forcibly suppressed the white cat as it could not move at all and was obediently held by Lin Jiufeng.1\u201cLet\u2019s go. How about you take me below to see what treasures are inside?\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.The white cat wanted to struggle, it didn\u2019t plan on yielding just yet.However, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s True Qi instantly extinguished its hopes of escaping.Without allowing it to object, he brought it down the passageway. Lin Jiufeng\u2019s True Qi transformed into flames that illuminated the dim passageway.There was nothing inside of it at all.Nothing but a passageway that constantly led downwards.The path was extremely narrow, only one person could move through it at a time.This was another reason why no one had discovered such a place after so many years.If its size was any bigger, people would\u2019ve easily dug it out.Lin Jiufeng walked for quite a long time. When he estimated that he was already tens of meters underground, he finally saw the end of the passageway.What he saw at the end was an underground world.Accurately speaking, it was a palace.But it wasn\u2019t too big considering that it was buried underground.The doors of the palace were left slightly ajar.Lin Jiufeng examined the white cat in his hands before he looked at the gap.\u201cYou opened this, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.He only received the white cat\u2019s fury of bared teeth as an answer.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t mind it.Instead, he said with a smile, \u201cThank you for opening the door. Otherwise, I would have to expend some effort again.\u201dThe doors of this palace clearly had an array formation inscribed on its surface judging on the runes and the winding lines that looked gibberish in the eyes.Lin Jiufeng had no knowledge about array formations at all.If the doors were tightly shut, he really wouldn\u2019t be able to open them.Right now, it was slightly ajar.He only pushed it slightly and it opened.The white cat shut its eyes tight in strong regret.It came out in a hurry and forgot to close the door.Now it brought disaster upon itself.Pushing the door open, what appeared in his sight was a coffin and innumerable pill bottles scattered all over the ground along with countless precious treasures that had been clearly eaten by something.This secret place used to contain a lot\u2014a lot of treasures.Just the pill bottles alone, Lin Jiufeng saw several thousands of them.They were piled up and became a small hill in one spot.As for the rest of the treasures, they were long consumed.Lin Jiufeng even caught sight of a ginseng that was at least 10,000 years old. The essence it contained was no more, and only its exterior was left. It was tossed aside by something in seemingly great disdain.\u201cYou did this, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked towards the white cat.\u201cYou are only a little white cat, but you\u2019re as strong as a Martial Sage Realm cultivator. You also move fast. It\u2019s definitely because you\u2019ve consumed all the treasures in here.\u201d\u201cThe secret treasures that the Chasing Corpse Sect constantly thought about for several hundreds of years were all consumed by you.\u201dThe white cat did not respond to Lin Jiufeng\u2019s question.It acted like a tsundere. It turned its head away, refusing to talk with Lin Jiufeng.\u201cIt\u2019s so messy here, but this coffin is very clean, without a speck of dust. This can only mean that the person inside this coffin is very important to you.\u201d\u201cWas it the person who brought you in here?\u201dLin Jiufeng guessed and moved closer to the coffin.The white cat grew anxious.It struggled, wanting to stop Lin Jiufeng from opening the coffin.But Lin Jiufeng had already pushed it open.Without any resistance at all.The white cat and Lin Jiufeng looked over together.But the coffin was empty, there wasn\u2019t anything inside of it at all.The white cat was dumbfounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The white cat managed to break free from Lin Jiufeng\u2019s grip and it leaped into the coffin. It then continuously fumbled around and called out from inside the coffin. Its forlorn and bitter cries reverberated throughout.It refused to believe all of this.How could there be nothing in the coffin?Lin Jiufeng looked at the sad white cat and asked, \u201cWho is this person?\u201dThe white cat turned around and looked at Lin Jiufeng ferociously.It was not in the mood to answer Lin Jiufeng.\u201cTell me. Perhaps I can help you find where this person went.\u201dLin Jiufeng did not force it either as he offered coolly.The white cat consumed and digested every treasure in this treasure trove until it finally became a Martial Sage. But its extravagant consumption of those treasures meant that it had no idea about the cultivation world.It inadvertently reached the Martial Sage Realm after consuming the resources at its disposal.This was why it only used its claws to kill, without even executing a technique.Right now, the white cat was upset and its cries were heart-wrenching.This meant that it didn\u2019t expect the coffin to be empty.All this time, it had never suspected that this had always been the case.Lin Jiufeng wanted to figure out the origins of the white cat\u2014this palace, this coffin\u2014and the person that was supposed to be inside the coffin.The white cat\u2019s claws gripped the coffin tightly while emitting a squealing sound.It was using its brain to think.But it could not figure out what had happened no matter what.There was just itself and Lin Jiufeng present.So, in the end, it ultimately yielded. Jumping off the coffin, it wrote something on the floor.[Demon Lord]Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he said, \u201cThe person buried in the coffin is the Demon Lord? When he was laid to rest?\u201dThe white cat\u2019s claws moved several times and scrawled a line of words.\u201c1500 years ago!\u201d\u201cThe Demon Lord from 1500 years ago\u2026\u201d Lin Jiufeng fell into deep thought.The Yuhua God Dynasty wasn\u2019t even founded yet 1500 years ago. That period was thought to be the peak era of the cultivation world. Numerous experts were abundant throughout the land and everything was in turmoil. The rise and fall of dynasties was quick.1Someone who could have the title of the Demon Lord back then was definitely a peak existence of that era.\u201cI don\u2019t have any information about this so-called Demon Lord in my memories,\u201d said Lin Jiufeng while shaking his head.The white cat immediately flared up. It believed that Lin Jiufeng was fooling it.\u201cBut I can go to the royal library and look up all sorts of information. The Yuhua God Dynasty is, after all, the only god dynasty of the current epoch. It definitely has a piece of information or two when it comes to this so-called Demon Lord.\u201d Lin Jiufeng ignored the white cat\u2019s anger.The white cat decisively wrote down a few words. \u201cGo look it up.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at it and laughed. \u201cWould I do that for nothing?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I can give you treasures.\u201d The white cat swiftly wrote a string of words.1Although it had the capabilities of a Martial Sage, it did not refine its pubis and was unable to\u00a0speak1.But it could write.However, it had crooked handwriting similar to that of a two to three-year-old.Every stroke landed in a spot contrary to Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expectation.Fortunately, Lin Jiufeng could still recognize the words as he looked at the white cat while it scribbled.\u201cYou\u2019ve already eaten all the things in this secret trove and you\u2019re saying that you still have some treasures for me?\u201d Lin Jiufeng refused to believe it.\u201cI did eat a lot, but I hid a significant amount to save up and eat them slowly. Since I couldn\u2019t leave, I had to carefully plan my meals. I only ate them sparingly in case I ran out of food.\u201d The white cat was still pretty clever.Just that this large paragraph of words it had written painted a truly terrible sight.It made Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes hurt.\u201cAll right, deal.\u201d Lin Jiufeng nodded and agreed.He wasn\u2019t doing this for the treasures.He mainly wanted to know the origins of this Demon Lord.1Why did he construct a palace and buried it tens of meters, even hundreds of meters underground?\u201cLeave this place and go find more information.\u201d Upon witnessing Lin Jiufeng\u2019s agreement, the white cat immediately drove Lin Jiufeng out. It did not like having people inside of this palace.Lin Jiufeng did not want to stay that long either.There wasn\u2019t anything here at all, but a clutter of odds and ends, as well as a white cat.2Although the white cat looked beautiful in the eyes with its body that resembled crystal and glass, its temper was bad.Lin Jiufeng shook his head and he turned around to leave.But when Lin Jiufeng turned around to leave, a line of words appeared before his eyes.[Sign-In in the underground Demon Palace?]\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng agreed.[Sign-In successful. Received Demonic Great Refinement Cultivation Technique!]2Following that, a large chunk of memories surged into Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind.They were all about the Demonic Great Refinement Cultivation Technique.It was a demonic sect\u2019s advanced dharmic formulation.It was incredibly powerful when cultivated right.1\u201cNot bad. I have another cultivation technique to save my life.\u201d Lin Jiufeng was very satisfied.He always liked everything that could improve his capabilities.After the successful Sign-In, Lin Jiufeng directly left the underground palace.The white cat kept its eyes on Lin Jiufeng. It was cautious and vigilant.It still did not trust Lin Jiufeng at all.Lin Jiufeng ignored it.Stepping onto the surface, he looked at the passageway entrance under the hundred-year-old tree. In the end, he decided not to close the entrance.Lin Jiufeng directly returned to his own courtyard.3He laid on the frost jade bed and closed his eyes to cultivate.He carefully cultivated the Demonic Great Refinement Cultivation Technique that he had just received, thoroughly digesting it to make it a part of his own capabilities.As for finding more information on that so-called Demon Lord?He could do that tomorrow too.In any case, Lin Jiufeng had a lot of time.The white cat covertly followed Lin Jiufeng the whole time.Seeing that Lin Jiufeng did not go to find more information, but instead, he went back to sleep and cultivate.It bared its teeth as its sharp claws extended.It was furious.But after its fury blossomed, it suddenly felt helpless.Since it was no match for Lin Jiufeng, no matter how angry it was, it would be for nothing.The white cat sulked for a period of time.It stared at Lin Jiufeng just like that. It knew that Lin Jiufeng could sense its gaze.So it continued to stare in this manner.Looking right at him.4The two eyes that resembled glass and amber remained on Lin Jiufeng without blinking.1But Lin Jiufeng remained unmoved.After staring for half the night, the white cat let out a meow.It threw a resentful glance at Lin Jiufeng before it turned around and left.It went back to the underground palace.Lin Jiufeng who was on the frost jade bed finally opened his eyes.A trace of a smile appeared at the corner of his lips as he murmured.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re a beautiful young girl, am I supposed to react and blush while you were staring at me like that?\u201d4\u2026The next day. Lin Jiufeng finally had a thorough understanding of the Demonic Great Refinement Cultivation Technique last night. Since he was done, he planned on looking up more information about that so-called Demon Lord early this morning.The reason was very simple.The white cat had once again kept an eye on Lin Jiufeng before daybreak arrived earlier.Standing in the courtyard, its eyes remained fixed on Lin Jiufeng.Since it was no match for Lin Jiufeng, it could only use this method to pressure him.Lin Jiufeng shook his head helplessly.He got ready and prepared to leave the Cold Palace for the royal library in order to find more information regarding that Demon Lord.But a surprise visitor interrupted Lin Jiufeng\u2019s plan to leave.It was Emperor Yuan\u2019s son.Emperor Ming.He was also Lin Tianyuan who once lived with Lin Jiufeng for ten whole years.He succeeded the throne when he was 15 years old and spent the first five years of his reign managing state affairs, working tirelessly for a prosperous country.Today, he was 20 years old.This was his first time meeting with Lin Jiufeng after he succeeded to the throne.\u201cUncle!\u201d Lin Tianyuan who had matured quite a lot shouted warmly.He used to address Lin Jiufeng as Teacher.Ever since he changed his form of address that time, he had been calling him Uncle all the time.\u201cWhy have you come?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.1He was really curious.Considering the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s current situation, there probably weren\u2019t any troublesome matters that required Lin Tianyuan to come and look for him, was there?The white cat became anxious.It knew that Lin Jiufeng was about to leave, but a person just had to come and stop him in his tracks.The white cat\u2019s thoughts were very simple.\u2018I\u2019ll kill you, then Lin Jiufeng will be able to go out!\u2019Thus, it pounced over.Pu!But Lin Jiufeng flicked his sleeve.The Demonic Great Refinement Cultivation Technique directly sent the white cat flying.It slammed against a tree and dropped down weakly.Its appearance immediately became dusty and dirty.Yet it wasn\u2019t injured at all, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s control over his own strength had already reached perfection.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then, it leaped onto the walls of the courtyard to watch both Lin Jiufeng and Lin Tianyuan from a distance.Seeing this scene, Lin Tianyuan asked curiously, \u201cUncle, is this yours?\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head and responded. \u201cA stray cat that came from somewhere unknown, it has a terrible temper. If it wasn\u2019t because I found it pitiful, I would\u2019ve driven it away long ago. No need to bother with it, just let it stay there on the wall.\u201dThe white cat was infuriated. Its claws scratched the walls and almost made a hole in it.Lin Jiufeng ignored it and asked Lin Tianyuan, \u201cYou\u2019ve become the Emperor, with a myriad of state affairs to handle every day. How do you have the time to come here?\u201dIt could be considered that Lin Jiufeng had watched Lin Tianyuan grow up.He inherited Emperor Yuan\u2019s unfulfilled wish and picked up Emperor Yuan\u2019s style. He was entirely devoted to state affairs.Lin Jiufeng was very pleased with this.It proved that his younger brother hadn\u2019t misjudged Lin Tianyuan\u2019s character.In the fight for power among the group of princes, he decisively chose Lin Tianyuan.\u201cUncle, I\u2019m here to deliver something to you.\u201dLin Tianyuan who had matured considerably said with a smile.He had indeed matured quickly after living five whole years of his life as the Emperor.He now commanded a really strong presence.But before Lin Jiufeng, he was still the sweet and respectful Lin Tianyuan.\u201cDeliver something to me?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dLin Jiufeng respectfully brought out a secret manual from his bosom.1With both hands, presented it to Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng took it and opened it for a look.[Ancient Demonic Book]\u201cThis was the culprit that caused your father\u2019s death?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked solemnly.If Emperor Yuan didn\u2019t cultivate this cultivation technique five years ago, Lin Jiufeng would\u2019ve managed to bring him back to life even if he had burned most of his life energy.\u201cYes, it is this heretic cultivation technique.\u201d Lin Tianyuan nodded.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been destroyed yet?\u201d Lin Jiufeng continued to ask.\u201cUncle, I just cannot bear to do it.\u201d Lin Tianyuan sighed.He also wanted to destroy this demonic cultivation technique back then. But in the serene silence of the night, after much consideration as he held this demonic cultivation technique in his hands, he still decided to lock it away in the end.He just couldn\u2019t bear to destroy it.\u201cYou cultivated it?\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked at Lin Tianyuan with a sharp gaze.This demonic cultivation technique had already killed two emperors.Lin Jiufeng did not wish to see Lin Tianyuan die to this as well.Lin Tianyuan shook his head resolutely. \u201cI did not.\u201dHowever, his smile turned wry.\u201cI am always tempted to cultivate it every time in the dead of the night. With the ever-growing difficulties of passing reforms and with the countless forces playing their own tricks behind the scenes, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for me to restrain myself from cultivating it.\u201d3Lin Tianyuan was being completely honest.He could resist this demon cultivation technique that could boost his strength on usual days.But whenever he was met with a setback, especially when the setback involved several major forces. The desire to become strong enough to pave his own path throughout the world would always appear in his heart.\u201cFive years ago, I could firmly resist this demonic cultivation technique. But this year, I\u2019ve already brought it out several times at night. I\u2019m just short of actually opening,\u201d said Lin Tianyuan with a bitter smile.\u201cUncle, my willpower is still lacking,\u201d said Lin Tianyuan dejectedly.Lin Jiufeng looked at Lin Tianyuan. \u201cSo you are giving this demon cultivation technique to me because you want to completely end this thought?\u201dLin Tianyuan nodded and said seriously, \u201cI know that Uncle is a person of great willpower, you were able to spend decades in this abandoned Cold Palace after all. This demonic cultivation technique will definitely not have an influence on you. I ask that Uncle take care of it.\u201dLin Jiufeng reached out to rub the demonic cultivation technique.Parchment had been used for it and it had been soaked in a special beast oil which made it particularly resilient to decay and damage.\u201cLeave it with me then. Are there any more demonic cultivation techniques like this in the royal palace?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cThere are no more.\u201d Lin Tianyuan shook his head.\u201cReforming the Yuhua God Dynasty was your father\u2019s wish. You\u2019re working really hard and I know it is very tough for you too, but it\u2019s not that there\u2019s nobody behind you!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said solemnly to Lin Tianyuan.\u201cAlthough I do not wish to partake in the affairs of the outside world, I have a compelling obligation to fulfill your father\u2019s dying wish.\u201d\u201cWhen you encounter troubles that you cannot handle in the future, just come straight to me and I will solve it for you.\u201d\u201cYou just need to spare no efforts with the reform, remember to let all the common people in the world live a good life. Provide for the elderly and be the dependence for the young.\u201d\u201cAs for the powerhouses who dare to stop you, they need to ask first whether the sword in my hand agrees or not!\u201dLin Jiufeng solemnly gave Lin Tianyuan his guarantee.Lin Jiufeng knew that Lin Tianyuan was under great pressure in such a lofty position.Especially when what he inherited was Emperor Yuan\u2019s unfulfilled wishes to reform the world.So Lin Jiufeng gave his own promise to him.Lin Tianyuan looked at Lin Jiufeng, touched.He bowed all the way and choked. \u201cI ask Uncle to act and give me a hand.\u201dLin Jiufeng knew that this was the case.Lin Tianyuan must have encountered huge trouble.Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t even think about cultivating this demonic cultivation technique.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lin Jiufeng led Lin Tianyuan into the courtyard and let him sit down.Other than a stone table, the rest of the courtyard was covered in bone swords.It has been five years since these bone swords were inserted into the ground here, but Lin Jiufeng never used them even once.\u201cA powerful Martial Sage has appeared on the Northwest Plains. He\u2019s a very strong one\u2026\u201d\u201cHe unified the fragmented Xianbei by himself. My scouts said that the unification happened just this winter and not long after, he will invade the borders with his army of millions and hunt down our troops for a million miles,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said in a low voice.2Lin Jiufeng frowned.The fragmented Xianbei on the Northwest Plains boasted a huge population.But they had always been fragmented for the entire population consisted of 800 different tribes of various sizes. In addition, all of them disliked each other, so they had never been a threat to the borders of the Yuhua God Dynasty.But it was clearly out of everyone\u2019s expectations that a powerhouse would suddenly appear out of nowhere to unite the fragmented Xianbei under his banner.Furthermore, he even wanted to hunt down the troops of the Yuhua God Dynasty for a million miles in the quest of plundering a million miles of land behind the borders.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s gaze turned cold.\u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the Martial Sage who united Xianbei?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cTumen. He\u2019s a priest of the Xianbei Temple. It is said that he received the graces of the gods of the plains and broke through to Martial Sage Realm at one go.\u201d2\u201cHe has no match throughout the plains and is very arrogant,\u201d Lin Tianyuan replied.\u201cUncle, it\u2019s already winter.\u201d\u201cThe snow is too cold, and as a result\u2026\u201d\u201cThe dispatchment of troops will be very slow. In addition, with a million miles of land from beyond the border, we will surely have a harder time with defense compared to their launching of the offense.\u201cIf he succeeds, millions of people would be displaced from their hometowns.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, the number of deaths from the cold and starvation would be too many to count by then,\u201d said Lin Tianyuan with a pained heart.\u201cSo you want me to go and kill this Martial Sage Tumen, am I right?\u201d Lin Jiufeng calmly asked.\u201cUncle, please take action!\u201d Lin Tianyuan stood up. He cupped both of his hands and bowed.\u201cGo back. I will go and kill Tumen.\u201d Lin Jiufeng waved his hand in and agreed to it.1This time, he was taking action for the millions of people living near the borders of the plains.Lin Tianyuan left.Since Uncle had agreed, he believed that Tumen would surely die.Hence, he needed to make arrangements for the subsequent matters in advance.When Lin Tianyuan disappeared, the white cat directly jumped off the courtyard walls and wrote a few words in front of Lin Jiufeng.The words were still crooked as ever as they looked even more cursive than cursive handwriting.It depicted the white cat\u2019s personal style in writing.\u201cYou are going out?\u201dLin Jiufeng nodded.\u201cFind more information!\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ll do that when I\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cHow much time do you need?\u201dLin Jiufeng smiled.A spring breeze seemed to have brushed past his face as he said, full of confidence.\u201cTo kill a Martial Sage cultivator\u2026\u201d\u201cThree days is enough!\u201dTwo of these three days were the time needed to travel back and forth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We ask Your Majesty to come to a decision,\u201d the Cabinet Chief asked in a low voice.Whether they chose to go to war or to make peace, no outcome would come out of arguing.They had to come to a decision as early as possible.\u201cThere is no need to worry anymore, ministers. There is no need to worry about Xianbei. I have already hired an expert to go kill that Tumen Martial Sage, Xianbei will immediately be fragmented upon his death. They will be unable to come and plunder our lands.\u201dLin Tianyuan announced in a great mood.The court officials looked at Lin Tianyuan in surprise.\u201cYour Majesty\u2014is the expert you hired\u2014the same mysterious expert who has been living in seclusion in the imperial capital?\u201d The Cabinet Chief asked, agitated.The others looked expectantly at Lin Tianyuan.\u201cYes!\u201d Lin Tianyuan immediately nodded.\u201cEveryone. Please wait at ease for the news of that Martial Sage Tumen\u2019s death!\u201dLin Tianyuan was very confident.With that, the court officials stopped arguing.All of them became akin to biological brothers as they started smiling at the same time.Without Martial Sage Tumen, Xianbei was no cause for worry.\u2026Lin Jiufeng walked out and closed the gates of the Cold Palace.In front of the Cold Palace\u2019s gates, fallen dead leaves covered the ground.Once the cold wind blew, they danced with the breeze.Lin Jiufeng would be rushing to the Northwest Plains.He did not bring anything with him.One man, one sword!3The sword with him was still the Demon Slaying Sword.It was a set with the bone swords.They were effective against a crowd of enemies, but when fighting a single target\u2026The Demon Slaying Sword was still the best.Meow!The white cat called out from the top of the courtyard walls.It was unwilling to let Lin Jiufeng leave.Not because it missed Lin Jiufeng but because it wanted Lin Jiufeng\u2019s help to find more information.2After all, the white cat had been in the underground palace for hundreds of years. As a result, it was extremely unfamiliar with the outside world.But Lin Jiufeng merely glanced at the white cat.Then, he waved his hand and charged into the sky.Meow!The white cat let out a resigned cry.It used its claws to scratch out some crooked words.\u201cSecond day of hating him!\u201d4\u2026The Northwest Plains was very far from the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s imperial capital.Considering that it was the dead of winter, the winds whistled so cold that it seemed to be able to penetrate through one\u2019s bones.Sweeping his gaze around him, the panoramic view looked so white and picturesque that one couldn\u2019t bear to destroy it.With True Qi wrapping his entire body, Lin Jiufeng became akin to an arrow that left its bow as he shot into the direction of the Northwest Plains.Wild winds howled, his True Qi engulfed his entire body as he moved at lightning speeds.Lin Jiufeng never managed to make a breakthrough into the next step of the Martial Sage Realm after these five years.However, the True Qi that he had accumulated in liquid form was terrifying.Despite moving so fast through the air and wantonly expending his True Qi like this, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s heart didn\u2019t feel a sting at all.One day!One whole day!1It took Lin Jiufeng one whole day before he arrived at the Northwest Plains\u2019 borders.This proved that the territory of the Yuhua God Dynasty truly was too vast. Lin Jiufeng finally understood why the court officials had to argue so fervently with each other in regards to the decision of going into war or making peace.It was all because this place was just too far from the imperial capital.Moreover, the temperatures here were much lower than that of other places in the Yuhua God Dynasty. As a result, the troops wouldn\u2019t be accustomed to the climate.The Xianbei residents were used to it, so war was scary.So the best solution to everything was to behead that man.When Lin Jiufeng arrived, he directly approached and asked a few Xianbei residents as to where the famous throughout the plans\u2014Martial Sage Tumen\u2014was at.\u201cMartial Sage Tumen. He\u2019s currently in the middle of a sacrificial ritual on the Celestial Mountains. The army is gathered at the foot of that same mountain,\u201d said the Xianbei residents.1This was a matter known to all on the plains.\u201cWhere are the Celestial Mountains?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.The Xianbei people pointed the way, not daring to withhold any information from him.Lin Jiufeng spared their lives as he rushed toward the Celestial Mountains.The Celestial Mountains weren\u2019t far and it was very conspicuous.After all, it was a mountain whose peak had broken through the skies. Furthermore, it had tens of imposing mountains surrounding it, as if there were more than a dozen dragons encircling and protecting an extremely terrifying divine being.Tumen\u2019s army could be seen at the foot of the Celestial Mountains.All sorts of tents stretched on for hundreds of miles.In fact, their numbers were still increasing as time passed by.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes went cold upon seeing this sight.This Martial Sage Tumen really was planning on sweeping through the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s borders.He truly was planning on plundering the land\u2014millions of miles beyond the borders and causing a situation that would incur widespread indignation and dissatisfaction.\u201cGiven how strong you already are, wouldn\u2019t it be better if you had continued your pursuit of the martial path\u2019s peak? Why bully the small and weak?\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s heart became filled with killing intent.31He charged into the sky and entered from a different side of the mountain.No one discovered him.He landed on the Celestial Mountains.In the middle of the mountain was a milky white celestial lake.2The celestial lake was constantly changing.One moment, there were swells made from underwater geysers stacking upon each other. But in the very next moment, the entire lake would become serene and silent. Its surface even gleamed resplendently as if it was a mirror in the sky.A burly man knelt at the edge of the celestial lake.Draped in hide, his hair was thick, similar to a lion, his disposition seemed ferocious and tough.3He was none other than Martial Sage Tumen.Right now, he was in the middle of a sacrificial ritual.There were all kinds of patterns drawn on the ground as he constantly chanted under his breath.Lin Jiufeng stood ten miles away as he unsheathed the Demon Slaying Sword.Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill!Directly cutting to the chase, Lin Jiufeng was here to kill.Since he had confirmed the man\u2019s identity, he would kill him directly.With his eyes blazing and True Qi surging, his Martial Will emerged behind him.An extremely frightening longsword, a hundred feet long stood in the sky.Then, it slashed together with the Demon Slaying Sword.Clang!A streak of sword energy split the wind and snow.It swept through the celestial lake and a tornado abruptly formed.This strike of his was extremely powerful.It flashed across ten miles, killing everything in its path.1However, Tumen who was in the middle of the sacrificial ritual suddenly opened his eyes.The wilderness inside him exploded as he opened his mouth and let out a raging roar.Roar!This was the sound of a wild beast, but it didn\u2019t belong to a single beast.It was the roar of hundreds of wild beasts.After this deafening sound reverberated, the phantoms of hundreds of savage wild beasts appeared behind Martial Sage Tumen.Wild bear, white tiger, lion, silver wolf, giant spider, raging bull, python\u2026All of these were the souls that Martial Sage Tumen was worshiping.He offered sacrifices to them and in return, he gained strength.Using such a method, he was able to quickly rise up in strength and was able to ultimately unite Xianbei.The sword energy that Lin Jiufeng had sent, trembled at this angry roar.But it did not break in the face of the roar.The sword energy continued to move forward.\u201cWhat a powerful swordsman!\u201d\u201cBut coming to assassinate me here is your greatest mistake\u2026\u201d\u201cI am the king of all animals on the plains!\u201dMartial Sage Tumen became as nimble as an ape as he leaped up and reached out to strike in the air.Boom!He broke Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword energy and the violent windstorm swept everything above the Celestial Mountains, forming a tempest.The scene was very frightening.Wild winds whistled forlornly.Icy snow blew sharply against one\u2019s face.The snow mountain released its might in this instant.This was the strength that belonged to nature.And it was extremely terrifying.Martial Sage Tumen howled like a lion. He went down on his four limbs and ran at high speed as he pounced over to Lin Jiufeng to kill him with a bite.Boom! Boom! Boom!Martial Sage Tumen\u2019s True Qi surged. His might skyrocketed as he went past the Profound Insight Step and directly reached Life Knowing.A strangle glow flickered in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.He took all of that in, but he remained calm as usual.\u201cThe intensity of your True Qi is already at Life Knowing, but your Martial Will is pitifully weak.\u201dLin Jiufeng calmly said with the Demon Slaying Sword in hand.\u201cAfter absorbing the energies of so many wild beasts, you have also become an ignorant beast like them, unable to even operate your own Martial Will. You\u2019ve nurtured strength as vast as the universe, but you\u2019ve ultimately remained as a mere passerby in this world.\u201dAs he spoke, Lin Jiufeng slashed out with a shocking stroke.The last move of Sword Twenty-Two.The 22nd stroke that was both divine and demonic.This move was also called \u2018Holy Spirit Sword Technique\u2019!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A powerful sword technique.It contained twenty-two strokes.The 22nd stroke was the most formidable move among them.Compared to the others, it had another name.Holy Spirit Sword Technique!When the stroke was launched, the universe saw huge changes.White snow danced in the air above the Celestial Mountains.Sword energy proliferated as wild winds roared, lifting Lin Jiufeng.He stood in the air, robes fluttering, and his black hair in a flurry.He was being surrounded by the sword energy.His hand held the Demon Slaying Sword.In the very next moment, the Demon Slaying Sword split the air and executed a move that was the amalgamation of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Martial Will and the world\u2019s energies.\u201cDie!\u201d Lin Jiufeng stood in the air. His gaze was cold like a God fiend.The Holy Spirit Sword Technique of Sword Twenty-Two directly weighed down onto his enemy like it was about to enact divine punishment.Boom!The massive sword energy covered the skies as furious winds swept across hundreds of miles of land. The snow was pulled in from all directions as a huge vortex was swiftly formed.This Holy Spirit Sword Technique landed.It was as if a part of the universe had collapsed.Martial Sage Tumen had no escape.He could only receive this move.Roar!However, Martial Sage Tumen wouldn\u2019t possibly just accept his death. The phantoms of savage wild beasts behind him roared in unison. They were furious.\u201cI beseech the gods of the plains to descend and kill the enemy!\u201d Martial Sage Tumen cried.His countenance looked hideous. Hundreds of wild beasts were supporting him in their phantom forms, but he still felt apprehensiveThus, he summoned the gods of the plains.Dong!Dong!Dong!The air shook as Martial Sage Tumen\u2019s True Qi swiftly expanded his body. All the hair on his body stood on ends. The purple mane that he had had fine hairs akin to sharp needles, but they now looked soft on Martial Sage Tumen\u2019s body.The mad winds stirred the purple mane, revealing Martial Sage Tumen\u2019s current appearance.He became a five-meter tall ape.3Leaping forcefully, True Qi gathered around him as he struck towards the sky, wanting to break Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Holy Spirit Sword Technique.Rumble!Unfortunately, the Holy Spirit Sword Technique managed to land. This sword stroke was the most powerful move in Sword Twenty-Two. It carried not only the world\u2019s energies but also Lin Jiufeng\u2019s fierce Martial Will.Boom!It simply and neatly penetrated Martial Sage Tumen\u2019s body.Then, inexhaustible sword energies fell like rain.They fell onto the Celestial Lake as if cleansing it.Martial Sage Tumen was already at the Life Knowing step of the Martial Sage Realm.But he was still defeated by Lin Jiufeng.In the boundless wind and snow, Lin Jiufeng spread his arms, his body moving with the wind.1He did not care about Martial Sage Tumen\u2019s corpse.He did not care about the peak of the Celestial Mountains beneath the explosion of his sword energies that fell like rain onto it.He did not care about the hundreds of thousands of troops at the foot of the Celestial Mountains.Lin Jiufeng was immersed in his own world.When he killed Martial Sage Tumen with a stroke of his sword just now, he seemed to have opened the doors to a brand-new world.He soon arrived at the second step of the Martial Sage Realm. Life Knowing.But in reality, Lin Jiufeng had already reached it long ago.He was merely missing a key to open its doors.Right now, he knew that he had found the key.Amidst the vast expanse of snow and the fierce winds, he slowly landed and stood by the Celestial Lake. He watched the swirling snowflakes, watched the biting fierce winds, and also the flustered army of hundreds of thousands.Everyone in the surrounding hundred miles had witnessed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s battle with Martial Sage Tumen.Everyone was flustered, unaware of what just happened.Why were they fighting?Who was fighting who?They were confused, they only knew that both parties were very powerful.1They did not see how it started but they saw the subsequent scene.A sword that seemed to be a pillar from the heavens rapidly fell from the sky.Then, they saw Martial Sage Tumen morphing into a giant ape. He leaped with all he had and faced the sword that seemed to have arrived to enact divine punishment upon its enemy.Afterwards, the sword penetrated his body.Then, the sword fell onto the peak of the Celestial Mountains.The army has witnessed all of these.Martial Sage Tumen had been killed!Martial Sage Tumen who controlled the Xianbei people with his strength was killed by a sword that came crashing from the heavens as if enacting divine punishment.This news instantly spread.The people of Xianbei cheered.In such a cold winter season, wasn\u2019t it better to stay close to your loved ones?At the least, they had no desire to gather together for war.But they were unable to oppose Martial Sage Tumen.With Martial Sage Tumen\u2019s death, these troops immediately split up.Each of them went on their own way, it was impossible for them to gather once more for war.Lin Jiufeng smiled when he saw all of these.He knew that this one stroke of his saved millions of lives.\u201cIt turns out that this is the key to the Life Knowing step.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at the Demon Slaying Sword in his hands in delight.The essence of Life Knowing was to be aware of one\u2019s heart and fate. From there\u2014they could do whatever they wanted to do so long as they continued to live responsibly.Lin Jiufeng finally understood the essence of the step that he had always found to be confusing.He held the Demon Slaying Sword in his hand and slashed toward the neighboring group of mountains.Then, he left.Riding the wind, he left without looking back.Rumble!A few seconds after he left, a huge mountain collapsed with a loud crash.The heap of pure white snow immediately stirred.An avalanche was soon formed from the collapse of the mountain.From the wound that forced its collapse, one could feel the overwhelmingly powerful sword energy that cut the mountain off in half.Lin Jiufeng entered Life Knowing with one strike!\u2026Imperial capital!Lin Jiufeng had flown back through the night.The journey to and fro only took him two days.1After entering Life Knowing on the Celestial Mountains of the Northwest Plain, his entire being was reborn. Naturally, his speed increased along with his strength.It was currently snowing in the imperial capital.The snow was not as heavy as the snow in the Northwest Plains, but the ground was still filled with snowflakes.Lin Jiufeng stepped on them, crunching sounds rang out as he did.Amidst the snowy night, Lin Jiufeng, who had just returned from the Northwest Plains, opened the Cold Palace\u2019s gates.Returning to his courtyard, he laid down on the frost jade bed. There, he started to contemplate everything that he knew so far about the Life Knowing step of the Martial Sage Realm.On the courtyard walls, a little fellow seemed to have blended in with the white snow.It watched Lin Jiufeng with its dark gaze that seemed to melt into the night.Meow!The white cat called out gently.It wanted to make Lin Jiufeng move and look for more information.But Lin Jiufeng was ignoring it.He had just returned after running all the way to the Northwest Plains to kill someone. He was exhausted, but this little white cat didn\u2019t seem to know how to take pity on someone at all.The white cat stopped calling.It knew that Lin Jiufeng was intentionally ignoring it.It angrily brandished its claws.It wanted to scratch Lin Jiufeng.But after it compared its own abilities to Lin Jiufeng\u2019s, the white cat retracted its claws in the end as it curled into a ball while remaining on top of the courtyard walls. Its body was slowly getting covered by the white snow.Its eyes were on Lin Jiufeng.The white cat sure was a stubborn creature.Otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have been able to guard an empty coffin in the underground palace for so many years.The next day, Lin Jiufeng woke up from his cultivation.His exhaustion had vanished and he stood up in satisfaction.Meow!Meows reverberated, the white cat was reminding Lin Jiufeng.\u201cWhite cat, you sure are persistent, huh?\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised his head and saw the little white cat curled into a ball and covered with snow on top of the wall.Meow!The white cat called out once more, its eyes stared hard at Lin Jiufeng.Together with its delicate appearance, it looked somewhat pitiful.\u201cNever mind. Let\u2019s go, you win,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said in resignation.This little white cat sure was persistent.If Lin Jiufeng still refused to go and find more information for it\u2026It would definitely keep staring at him as if he had abandoned it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he didn\u2019t wish to be discovered, then the average person wouldn\u2019t be able to find him.The little white cat followed Lin Jiufeng. It became curious.These people all didn\u2019t notice him?However, Lin Jiufeng was too lazy to explain.He walked into the room where ancient books and records regarding the demonic sects were stored with the little white cat.\u201cI\u2019ll look for more information about that so-called Demon Lord.\u201dLin Jiufeng started to read each book by following the catalog.1His reading speed was tremendously fast. He seemed to be only skimming through the pages of the book, yet he had read through them.As he browsed through the books one by one, Lin Jiufeng soon found an excerpt introducing the Demon Lord.The leader of the demonic sects, 1500 years ago, had the title \u2018Demon Lord\u2019.But he also had another title.The last Demon Lord!This title meant that after him\u2014there would no longer be any Human Gods considering that the spiritual energy of the world was gradually declining.The Demon Lord was one of the final Human Gods of that era.After they died, even Martial Sages disappeared.It was only in the recent decade or two did a Martial Sage emerged.This meant that the world\u2019s spiritual energy was slowly recovering.But it would still be incomparably difficult for a Human God to appear.The current recovery rate of the world\u2019s spiritual energy was far too slow for that.Meow!The little white cat called out. It jumped onto Lin Jiufeng\u2019s shoulders and eagerly read the book.It was able to understand its contents.The book had indeed recorded the deeds of the last Demon Lord.\u201cWhen did the Demon Lord build that palace deep underground?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.The area deep underground was one with extreme negative energies. There must be some significant meaning for the Demon Lord to have buried the underground palace there.The little white cat used its claws to write on Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body, stroke by stroke.\u201c1000 years ago!\u201d The little white cat wrote.2\u201cDoes that mean that you\u2019ve also lived for a thousand years?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked in surprise.\u201cI ate a lot of pills. Some of them were pills that the Demon Lord treasured. With their help, I was able to live for so long.\u201d The white cat wrote.\u201cIt turns out that you\u2019re already 1000 years old. You\u2019re older than me.\u201d4Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but comment.The white cat\u2019s eyes narrowed. It stared at Lin Jiufeng as it lifted its claws.Although it was 1000 years old, it remained in the underground palace the whole time.It lacked common sense.\u201cYou personally witnessed the Demon Lord\u2019s death?\u201d Lin Jiufeng calmly changed the topic.The white cat nodded.\u201cFor 1000 years, you\u2019ve never left?\u201d Lin Jiufeng continued to ask.\u201cNo, I ate that life-prolonging pill at the start and was in a coma for a really long time\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen I woke up, I found that there was somebody at the entrance of the underground palace, studying how to undo the seal.\u201d The white cat wrote on Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body.\u201cThat should be about 700 to 800 years ago, the Chasing Corpse Sect\u2019s golden era. You were in a coma for about 200 to 300 years, so the Demon Lord\u2019s body had probably disappeared during that time.\u201d Lin Jiufeng deduced.The little white cat stopped writing.It became a little depressed.Lin Jiufeng continued going through the books.All sorts of books recorded considerable information about the Demon Lord.But their records spanned 1500 years ago, none of them had any recent information about the Demon Lord.1Lin Jiufeng even saw that the demonic cultivation technique that Lin Tianyuan handed over to him was the cultivation technique of that Demon Lord back then.Lin Jiufeng finally understood why two emperors successively wanted to cultivate it.It was the cultivation technique of a Human God after all.Anyone would be tempted.At the end of browsing through the books, the little white cat had already lost its hopes.It jumped off Lin Jiufeng\u2019s shoulders as it left with its back turned to him in sadness.It did not say any word of goodbyes to Lin Jiufeng.The small white figure disappeared from the library.Lin Jiufeng shook his head.He put down the books and prepared to leave.[Sign-In at the library?]\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng nodded.[Sign-In successful. Received Well-illuminated Dao Heart quality.]Lin Jiufeng was puzzled.Well-illuminated Dao Heart quality?What was this?[Well-illuminated Dao Heart quality. It will help you find the right direction. You will be able to take fewer detours when cultivating.]3Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cThis quality is pretty overpowered.\u201d\u20262He left the royal library.Lin Jiufeng did not go look for the little white cat.After all, that white cat was quite formidable. There was no need to worry about its safety.1If it were to leave the imperial capital to travel elsewhere, Lin Jiufeng would not force it to stay.1He returned to the Cold Palace and continued with his routine.Signing in, cultivating, and gaining enlightenment.In this cold winter, Lin Jiufeng continued to live a life detached from worldly affairs.Time passed.Three days had passed yet the white cat still hadn\u2019t returned to the Cold Palace.1Lin Jiufeng could only shake his head.Time went by slowly.On this day, Dachun delivered wine and food once again.It was the sixth day since Lin Jiufeng returned from the Northwest Plains.Dachun said from behind the wall. \u201cYour Royal Highness, did you know?\u201d\u201cXianbei of the Northwest Plains had an upheaval.\u201dLin Jiufeng calmly drank his wine as he asked, \u201cWhat upheaval?\u201d\u201cAccording to the news received by our imperial guards, the fragmented Xianbei was united by an expert. But in less than a month, that expert was killed at the Celestial Lake on the Celestial Mountains. The united Xianbei fragmented once more\u2026\u201d\u201cThe fragmentation forced them to a corner to the point that they even sent their own men to request rations from the imperial capital for the winter. They also indicated their willingness to acknowledge their allegiance to the throne.\u201d Dachun shared while shaking his head.He seemed to have found the events a tad bit unbelievable.Lin Jiufeng commented softly. \u201cHis Majesty must be really happy then.\u201d\u201cYes, the entire court is delighted because we no longer have to go to war.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t manage to come here for a few times since I was too busy with preparing for an upcoming war\u2026\u201d\u201cBut now that Xianbei has fragmented once more, I am not so busy anymore, so I came here to bring food and wine for Your Royal Highness,\u201d Dachun said with a chuckle.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Lin Jiufeng nodded in satisfaction. \u201cWith war, many people will die.\u201dHis efforts of traveling day and night in a rush to the Northwest Plains to deliver that one strike didn\u2019t go in vain with this outcome.2Dachun also shared some interesting court matters with Lin Jiufeng.Afterwards, the curtain to this food delivery ended.Lin Jiufeng returned to his courtyard. He laid on the frost jade bed and brought out the demonic cultivation technique that Lin Tianyuan gave him.[Ancient Demonic Book]This demonic book was very evil.1It killed two emperors from the Yuhua God Dynasty in succession.However, after Lin Jiufeng was equipped with the Well-illuminated Dao Heart, his cultivation speed had become even more outstanding. His mentality also became more stable.He was not afraid of this [Ancient Demonic Book] at all.Flipping open the parchment, Lin Jiufeng slowly read the contents of this demonic cultivation technique.\u201cI see.\u201d Lin Jiufeng gained a sudden revelation after reading it.\u201cThis demon cultivation technique matches my Demonic Great Refinement, it just so happens that I can cultivate them together.\u201d Lin Jiufeng smiled.2As for its drawback of devouring life?Lin Jiufeng thought.\u2018So long as I advanced fast enough, I won\u2019t be afraid of being devoured by it.\u20195Meow!Right as Lin Jiufeng was thoroughly engrossed in studying the demonic cultivation technique, a meow came from the Cold Palace.It was the little white cat, it had returned.It initially did not want to let out a cry.But for some reason, it felt that it had to inform Lin Jiufeng that it was back.So it meowed once then went to hide in the underground palace.Lin Jiufeng was in the middle of cultivating the demonic cultivation technique. He could not divert his attention away from the book, but the corner of his lips raised at an angle.In this Cold Palace, he now had a neighbor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The lions at the entrance shone beautifully beneath the sun, while the guards that protected the residence were full of spirits.The owner of this mansion was the direct son of the current Empress Dowager.He was also once regarded as the heir to the throne.Unfortunately, Emperor Yuan disliked him. The former commented that he was ambitious but talentless. Even when Emperor Yuan was gravely injured back then, he didn\u2019t agree to appoint him as the crown prince.Instead, Emperor Yuan chose Lin Tianyuan.When Lin Tianyuan ascended the throne, the original queen became the Empress Dowager and he begged Lin Tianyuan not to kill her son.Lin Tianyuan agreed and gave him the title of an idle Lord.He had no real power, but he was supplied with the best food and lifestyle possible.He was free to do whatever he wanted except that he couldn\u2019t leave the imperial capital.Lin Tianyuan made it clear that he was planning to take care of this former prince in this manner until death.But this former prince\u2014the current Lord Taiping was unwilling to suffer such a fate!2He was Emperor Yuan\u2019s eldest son and the rightful heir to the throne. But what belonged to him was robbed by a bastard child\u2014Lin Tianyuan. In the end, he was even forced to live the life of a wastrel.6Lord Taiping didn\u2019t want to continue this lifestyle. Thus, he contacted the Qiankun Demon Sect in private, wanting to use their strength to carry out a coup.The Qiankun Demon Sect agreed but they were worried about provoking the mysterious expert in the imperial capital. As a result, they contacted several other demonic sects and convinced them to support Lord Taiping in his endeavor.They didn\u2019t dare to openly make trouble in the imperial capital, but they were still courageous enough to secretly support a prince in his rebellion.The members of the Qiankun Demon Sect and the other demonic sects managed to infiltrate the ranks of the Forbidden Troops of the imperial capital.From the inside, they started to corrupt the commanders of the Forbidden Troops by luring them with benefits, intimidation, and various other methods.In just a few years, the commanders of the 100,000 strong Forbidden Troops were successfully corrupted and they all supported Lord Taiping.They were attracted by the prospect depicted by Lord Taiping.Support the imperial power\u2026Defeat the pseudo-emperor\u2026Return the throne to its rightful owner and help save the Yuhua God Dynasty from ruin.1If they succeed, they would become the new emperor\u2019s loyal officials who helped him retake the throne. Their status would definitely be much higher than their current ones.After several years of preparation, everything was finally in place.The only thing that Lord Taiping was worried about was the hidden powerhouse in the imperial capital. He was afraid that he might interfere and stop him.This was why there were four Martial Sages in Taiping\u2019s mansion at this moment.2All of them were sent by the various demonic sects that came here to support Lord Taiping.The ten commanders of the Forbidden Troops were also present and even a Martial Sage of the royal family that had been persuaded to join Lord Taiping\u2019s cause was inside the mansion.4These people gathered together to discuss whether they should go through with the coup or not.\u201cThe only thing we should worry about by now is that sword from ten years ago.\u201dLord Taiping gnashed his teeth.When Emperor Yuan died, Lord Taiping was confident that he would be the one to ascend to the throne.But what happened next was something that he would never forget in his entire life.A bastard child appeared out of nowhere and took away the throne that belonged to him. What\u2019s worse was that the bastard child even placed him in a discreet house arrest.This was a humiliation that he would never forget for the rest of his life.1\u201cIt\u2019s been ten years and this powerhouse hasn\u2019t appeared even once. We\u2019re not even sure if this expert is still even in the imperial capital or not,\u201d A Martial Sage expert said.\u201cI think that it\u2019s time.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem even if that person is in the imperial capital. You are the eldest son of Emperor Yuan, the original successor of the Yuhua God Dynasty. You are just going to take back what belongs to you in the first place\u2026\u201d1\u201cThis isn\u2019t a rebellion, but a mission to defeat the pseudo-emperor.\u201dA commander of the Forbidden Troop urged Lord Taiping.\u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d Anger broke out in Lord Taiping\u2019s heart.He had persevered for ten whole years by now.He didn\u2019t plan to endure any longer.\u201cTonight. Mobilize the Forbidden Troop and surround the Forbidden City, let\u2019s kill the pseudo-emperor,\u201d Lord Taiping said with a hideous look on his face.\u201cLeave the old emperor to me, I will ensure that he won\u2019t be able to rescue this Emperor Ming.\u201dThe newly promoted Martial Sage of the royal family was confident.He chose to handle the old emperor\u20263One of Emperor Ming\u2019s supporters.He was also Lord Taiping\u2019s Grandpa Emperor.\u201cLaunch a mutiny!\u201d Lord Taiping drew out his sword and roared.Dong dong dong!The imperial capital trembled as countless people watched in surprise.Tonight, 100,000 members of the Forbidden Troops rushed to surround the Forbidden City. In an instant, they controlled the court officials as they approached Emperor Ming at lightning speeds.This was something no one had expected.It was too sudden, everyone was caught off guard.The four Martial Sages from the demonic sects directly suppressed the three Martial Sages accumulated by Emperor Ming over the past ten years. They also suppressed Nameless.Emperor Ming\u2019s Grandpa Emperor was also stopped by that Martial Sage from the royal family.For the time being, Emperor Ming was in grave danger.Inside the Central Hall in the Forbidden City, Lord Taiping boisterously laughed as he looked triumphantly at Lin Tianyuan who was being surrounded by the former\u2019s troops.\u201cYour four Martial Sages are being suppressed by my people at this moment. The old emperor has also been stopped by a Martial Sage from the royal family. The Forbidden Troops had long become my people, and many major families are supporting me.\u201d\u201cOnce you are dead, countless top families and numerous powerful sects will come here to congratulate me on clearing out the rebels and restoring the royal throne to its rightful owner.\u201dLord Taiping was just too happy.Having pushed Lin Tianyuan to a corner, he was finally about to take what belonged to him.\u201cIn order to succeed, you even cooperated with the demonic sects?\u201dLin Tianyuan\u2019s face was gloomy as he said amidst his gnashed teeth.\u201cThose who dream of glory will not bother with the trivialities. Cooperating with the demonic sect is better than the throne being occupied by a thief like you.\u201d\u201cTen years!\u201d\u201cTen whole years!\u201d\u201cDo you know how I spent the past ten years?\u201d2Lord Taiping roared with a ferocious expression on his face.\u201cI\u2019m here to kill you.\u201d\u201cThe throne is mine and no one can take it away from me.\u201dLord Taiping raised his sword and he slowly walked over to Lin Tianyuan.Lin Tianyuan wanted to fight back but he was suppressed by a Great Grandmaster Realm cultivator.Lord Taiping said proudly, \u201cAll the people you see right now are my people\u2026\u201d\u201cHow are you going to fight against me?\u201dLin Tianyuan gritted his teeth and looked at this scene in fury.\u2026In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng picked up a teacup and made a cup of tea in the dark.The little white cat wrote on the ground with its paw. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to help him?\u201d\u201cA group of people playing house isn\u2019t worthy enough for me to come out.\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head.The so-called rebellion was nothing more than playing house in his eyes.3He was too lazy to go over and he was also too lazy to draw his sword.As a result, he just tossed the cup in his hand into the air.The water in the cup flew out quickly as it condensed into a longsword that hovered in the air.Boom!At the very next moment, this longsword pierced through Lord Taiping and the four Martial Sages from the demonic sect in the Forbidden City.2The white cat blinked its eyes.It quickly wrote two words on the floor.You freak!3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Facing Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword strike that was casually executed, they couldn\u2019t resist at all.They all died!Lin Tianyuan\u2019s Martial Sages immediately began their counterattack. They attacked and killed the commanders of the Forbidden Troops.The rebellion was controlled in an instant.Everyone looked at Lin Tianyuan in a daze.What happened?They didn\u2019t saw Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword just now.1The move Lin Jiufeng used was similar to a spring breeze and rain. Just like how the rain was formed by invisible water vapors, people wouldn\u2019t notice its formation.But Lin Tianyuan knew that only his Uncle had the ability to execute these people so covertly.He looked at the Forbidden Troops. He was suddenly scared.If it wasn\u2019t for Lin Jiufeng, his reign would\u2019ve been overthrown.\u201cI paid too much attention to external matters and reforms. I\u2019ve relaxed my control over the imperial capital. This is a harsh lesson to me.\u201d Lin Tianyuan gnashed his teeth and swallowed the bitter pill.\u201cDrop your weapons. I won\u2019t hold you all accountable. I will only punish the leaders!\u201d Lin Tianyuan took a deep breath and declared solemnly.5As soon as this statement of his came out\u2014the soldiers successively put down their weapons.They didn\u2019t dare to resist.A crisis disappeared, just like this.Lin Tianyuan looked in the direction of the Cold Palace.Words weren\u2019t enough to describe his gratitude.\u2026After Lord Taiping\u2019s rebellion, the imperial capital immediately strengthened its management.The other Lords have been scared off by the turn of events.They didn\u2019t dare to make any move for fear of being targeted.Some people described the current Emperor Ming as a frightened tiger. When he encountered any person or beast, he would choose to kill the other party to ensure his own safety.3For a while, the security in the imperial capital greatly improved.Lin Tianyuan didn\u2019t do anything to the outsiders, he first cleaned up the royal family members from the inside out.Those who committed a lot of crimes, those who colluded with the demonic sects, and those who participated in the rebellion were all killed.2This time, many royal family members were executed. Heads rolled here and there, causing many people to panic.With the executions, Lin Tianyuan\u2019s majesty as the Emperor in the eyes of the masses became heavier.However, Lin Tianyuan didn\u2019t care what others thought of him. After cleaning up the pests in the royal family, he came to pay respect and express his gratitude to Lin Jiufeng.This was his second trip to the Cold Palace since he ascended the throne.On average, one trip to the Cold Palace every five years.\u201cUncle. Thank you for saving my life,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said respectfully.\u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said calmly. This was really just a small matter to him.2\u201cUncle, with the in-depth reform of the Yuhua God Dynasty, and the removal of the nine vassal lords. The pressure on the treasury has been reduced by quite a lot. Next, I plan to do something about the sects,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said solemnly.\u201cDo something against the sects of the world?\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.\u201cNo, I just want to eliminate the Buddhist temples in the Jiangnan area.\u201dLin Tianyuan shook his head.In the land of mist and rain, Jiangnan. Buddhist temples prevailed. One could say that there was a temple in every three steps and a monastery in five.\u201cThe monks in these temples and monasteries do not do anything productive aside from accepting the people\u2019s offerings. The Bodhisattva statues in the temples are shining from the gold that was used to create them, but the people outside the temples are hungry.\u201d\u201cDespite that, they still had to give their offerings and pray to the Bodhisattvas for safety\u2026\u201d2\u201cThis is too much,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said indignantly.Lin Jiufeng remained quiet as he listened.\u201cWhat\u2019s worse was that that ordinary people who have committed crimes are using these temples to hide by pretending that they have put down their butcher knives to become monks and eventually a Buddha\u2026\u201d\u201cSince they now belonged to the buddhist sects, the imperial court no longer has any right to arrest them for the imperial court has no right to interfere in the affairs of the buddhist sects\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is why it\u2019s common for the villains to become monks in the Jiangnan area.\u201d\u201cOnce they have become monks, they would then proceed to commit more crimes under the protection of the buddhist sects.\u201d\u2018Adultery, looting, all sorts of crimes weren\u2019t a problem for them to commit\u2026\u201d\u201cBut despite all of these, in the eyes of the people, all the monks from the buddhist sects were all kind and compassionate. This point of view makes it hard for the imperial court to handle them.\u201d\u201cThese temples and monasteries must be demolished. The evil monks must be arrested.\u201d\u201cTemples and monasteries can exist, but they can\u2019t be everywhere like they are right now.\u201dLin Tianyuan relayed his thoughts to Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng who has been silently listening all this while, asked, \u201cThe buddhist sects are still quite strong. How many Martial Sages do you have under your command?\u201d\u201cFive!\u201d Lin Tianyuan said.\u201cBut I managed to recruit a few Martial Sages recently\u2026\u201d\u201cThey know my plan and are willing to help me.\u201d\u201cSo in fact, the actual numbers are about a dozen or so Martial Sages.\u201d Lin Tianyuan added.4Lin Jiufeng instantly understood.It was because of this group of Martial Sages that Lin Tianyuan gained the confidence to deal with the buddhist sects.\u201cSince you have already decided to do this, then go do it. The temples and monasteries all over the land should indeed be demolished,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.Lin Tianyuan replied, embarrassed. \u201cI hope that Uncle can help me when necessary.\u201d\u201cYou already have a dozen Martial Sages under you,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.This was a very formidable group.\u201cThere are three buddhist sects in the Jiangnan area\u2014Dalin Temple, Xuankong Temple, and Shaolin Temple!\u201d1\u201cThe Dalin Temple respects the boundaries of their territories without daring to expand their area of influence. Its believers are also bountiful, and their monks are kind. I won\u2019t target the Dalin Temple this time.\u201d2\u201cAs for the Xuankong Temple and the Shaolin Temple, it feels like they are competing with each other. If one expands its influence further, the other also expands\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are 80,000 temples and monasteries in the Jiangnan area alone, all of which were built by the believers of these two sects that used their influence to bluff the believers into building these temples and monasteries for them.\u201d\u201cThis time, these two sects are the ones I\u2019m targeting.\u201dLin Tianyuan explained in detail.\u201cBut the Xuankong Temple and the Shaolin Temple are both buddhist sects that have been passed down for thousands of years\u2026\u201d\u201cTheir backgrounds are also profound with resources enough to nurture a lot of powerhouses in their sects. Besides, they are quite far away from the imperial capital. Plus, they also have a lot of cultivators in their ranks, so they aren\u2019t afraid of the imperial court.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m worried that these two sects might have one or two powerhouses that I won\u2019t be able to handle.\u201d Lin Tianyuan explained his worries to Lin Jiufeng.\u201cDo what you want without fear. If such a person really appears, I will help you handle it.\u201dLin Jiufeng thought for a while and agreed.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s reform was akin to continuing the unfulfilled wishes of Emperor Yuan.In the past, Emperor Yuan wanted to destroy the vassal lords first.Then, he was planning on destroying the monasteries and temples of the buddhist sects in the secular world afterwards.Now that the problem of the vassal lords had been resolved and the other places of the Yuhua God Dynasty were safe and sound, he wanted to target the Jiangnan area next.Lin Jiufeng naturally supported him.\u201cThank you, Uncle.\u201d Lin Tianyuan was overjoyed.Now, he was reassured of his success.Lin Jiufeng was what gave him the confidence.Having received Lin Jiufeng\u2019s guarantee, Lin Tianyuan\u2019s mood relaxed.He couldn\u2019t help but speak with a smile.\u201cUncle, I recently received a piece of news. I reckon you might be interested in it.\u201d\u201cWhat news would I be interested in?\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked at him.\u201cUncle, do you still remember why you were sent into the Cold Palace in the first place?\u201dLin Tianyuan asked as he laughed.This question made Lin Jiufeng recall his memories.At that time, he had just transmigrated and was then directly sent into the Cold Palace.25 years passed in a flash.When Lin Jiufeng remembered why he was locked up in the Cold Palace, the white cat appeared in the corner and curled up. It looked very inconspicuous but its eyes were full of spirits.It eavesdropped.It wanted to know why Lin Jiufeng was locked up in the Cold Palace.\u201cWhy did you bring up this matter?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked, puzzled.\u201cIt has been 25 years since you released the Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty. Your actions back then incurred the wrath of the imperial court, and that was why you were exiled and locked up in the Cold Palace,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said.\u201cEn. It\u2019s indeed because of this, then?\u201d Lin Jiufeng calmly looked at Lin Tianyuan.\u201cIt\u2019s been 25 years, don\u2019t you want to know how that Holy Maiden is faring after all these years?\u201dLin Tianyuan asked.Lin Jiufeng was dumbfounded.He never thought about this so-called Holy Maiden even once in the past 25 years.He thought he would never hear anything about her ever again.Lin Jiufeng may have forgotten, but Lin Tianyuan\u2019s words just now sent him on a trip down the memory lane. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat news is it all about?\u201dLin Tianyuan boisterously laughed before he answered.\u201cI knew that you wouldn\u2019t be indifferent in matters that concerned this Holy Maiden.\u201dThe little white cat listened.Then, it narrowed its eyes slowly as it wrote two words on the ground with its paw.1You pervert!5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In a hurry, he said, \u201cTeacher, this Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty has rarely left her place for the past 25 years since she returned\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s responsible for the sacrificial matters in her nation.\u201d\u201cA lot of people say that she can communicate with the gods.\u201d\u201cThere are countless people who are said to be able to communicate with the gods, but which one of them has any real ability?\u201d Lin Jiufeng acted nonchalantly. The image of this Holy Maiden had already disappeared from his mind, he totally couldn\u2019t remember what she looked like.After all, he hadn\u2019t thought of her even once in the past 25 years.How was it possible that he could still remember what she looked like?\u201cUncle, what you said is wrong. According to the information I have received, this Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty actually has real ability.\u201d Lin Tianyuan explained.\u201cWhat ability?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked calmly.\u201cThis Holy Maiden has been blessed by the gods to enlighten others\u2026\u201d\u201cA lot of people prayed sincerely and after her enlightenment, they became powerhouses.\u201d\u201cA few Martial Sages have already appeared because of her.\u201d\u201cSome of these people became her dedicated guards, and they are now a force that cannot be underestimated throughout the Great Yan Dynasty.\u201d Lin Tianyuan explained.\u201cEnlightening people into reaching the Martial Sage Realm?\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s expression looked strange.\u201cThat\u2019s right. This is the information I\u2019ve received from our spies. It\u2019s absolutely true.\u201dLin Tianyuan nodded.\u201cTo be able to enlighten others into reaching the Martial Sage Realm, she definitely has a higher cultivation base than that of the Martial Sage Realm.\u201d\u201cAs far as I can remember when the holy maiden was caught 25 years ago, she wasn\u2019t even at the Innate Realm at all and was extremely weak.\u201d\u201cBut to think that she would become such a terrifying powerhouse after 25 years?\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head. He found it hard to believe that this was true.If Lin Jiufeng was asked to mentor someone into becoming a Martial Sage, he could do it with a bit of effort.But this was only limited to the first step of the Martial Sage Realm, Profound Insight.Lin Jiufeng was now at the second step of the Martial Sage realm, Life Knowing.And he was at the absolute pinnacle of this second step.He didn\u2019t even dare to waste a second in the past five years, yet how was it possible that the Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty could compare to him in cultivation speed?Lin Tianyuan saw that Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t believe it. However, he didn\u2019t explain any further as he just said, \u201cI just want to inform you of this, Uncle. After all, she\u2019s a person who had some relations with you before.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t believe my words, then pardon me for I shall go back and deal with state affairs.\u201dLin Jiufeng watched him leave without saying anything.As for the Holy Maiden who was previously related to him?\u201cThat time would be the last time that I\u2019ll be related to her for the rest of my life.\u201d1Lin Jiufeng muttered in his heat.5With his character of wanting to stay in the Cold Palace forever, it was unlikely he would meet this so-called Holy Maiden ever again.2After Lin Tianyuan took his leave, the white cat walked over slowly.It asked Lin Jiufeng through writing.\u201cTell me about this Holy Maiden.\u201d\u201cGo practice your penmanship that\u2019s worse than the trails of a crawling dog first.\u201d1Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t pay any attention to it.The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng.It felt humiliated as it struck the ground angrily with its claws.What did he mean by worse than the trails of a crawling dog?Just look at how cute the words it has written were.3\u2026Lin Tianyuan started to become busy in the preparations of dealing with the buddhist sects and so did the entire Yuhua God Dynasty.But in the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng was in the middle of comprehending the third step of the Martial Sage Realm, Fish Leap.He was about to make a breakthrough.\u2018I have to make a breakthrough to the third step as soon as possible. Then, I should start trying to comprehend the fourth step of the Martial Sage Realm. My aim is to eventually make a breakthrough to the Human God Realm and hopefully achieve the peak of cultivation\u2026\u2019\u2018This is what my goal should be.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng thought silently.If there wasn\u2019t a need for him to go out, then he wouldn\u2019t leave the Cold Palace at all.He had an incredibly long lifespan by now anyway.As winter passed, the ice and snow of the twelfth lunar month finally melted.Spring came, and the whole world underwent a few subtle changes.In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng has been looking at the sky for the past few days.There would always be a frown on his face whenever he did so.He visited the underground palace and tapped its doors with his toes.After a while, the white cat came out and looked at Lin Jiufeng, astonished.Lin Jiufeng never came here to look for it before.\u201cHave you felt that there is something strange with the world in the past few days?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.The white cat thought for a while. Then, it wrote in confusion. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel anything at all.\u201dLin Jiufeng glanced at the words.The handwriting was still as ugly as ever.Seeing that the white cat didn\u2019t notice anything wrong, Lin Jiufeng turned around and left as he continued to observe the sky.Meow!The white cat called out and quickly wrote a few words.\u201cWhat have you discovered?\u201dLin Jiufeng stopped in his tracks. He looked at the words for a moment before saying, \u201cThe spiritual energy in the world has been extremely unstable a few hours before daybreak.\u201cThe spiritual energy that exists and we are able to absorb down here is still normal, but there is an abundance of spiritual energy high up in the sky as if there is a storm up above.\u201d2Lin Jiufeng explained what he had observed to the white cat.Ordinary Martial Sages wouldn\u2019t possibly notice these changes.It was only Lin Jiufeng who couldn\u2019t sleep at night and whose eyes were sharp enough was able to see such a scene in the middle of the night.The white cat also looked at the sky in confusion.But it didn\u2019t notice anything.But it believed in Lin Jiufeng, so it followed him as he toured around the Cold Palace from morning till night.But nothing of significance was discovered.At night, the white cat laid on top of the courtyard walls while Lin Jiufeng stood all alone on his own.His body was agile and vigorous, and his face was still the same as it was 25 years ago.Lin Jiufeng was looking at the sky.Thousands of miles high up in the sky.There was a tempest of spiritual energy.The white cat wasn\u2019t able to see this.It observed carefully, but it found nothing.As Lin Jiufeng looked at the sky, he realized something in his heart as he said, \u201cThis spring, the spring rain still hasn\u2019t come, right?\u201dThe white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise.Why did he mention this all of a sudden?Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t a farmer.What did the spring rain have to do with him?Lin Jiufeng said, \u201cTonight, there will be a heavy rain that will affect the world.\u201dThe white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng, bewildered.Why wasn\u2019t it able to understand what he was saying?Lin Jiufeng stopped talking and returned to his room.He opened the doors and the windows as he laid on the frost jade bed.Then, he waited at ease.\u2026In a Buddhist temple, seven or eight old monks stood around an extremely old and shriveled monk.\u201cThis spiritual energy of the world is really about to make a recovery. There will be a heavy rain tonight, and this heavy rain shall signal the arrival of a new era.\u201d The shriveled monk softly mumbled. His breathing considerably weakened, but his eyes looked bright.There seemed to be countless pictures flitting across his eyes.\u201cHoly Buddha, what else did you see?\u201d A monk asked.\u201cShaolin Temple is about to encounter a catastrophe. Don\u2019t\u2014\u201d The monk said these with great difficulty. But before he could finish his words, he suddenly stopped breathing and passed away.4The other monks looked at the breathless Holy Buddha. Then, they looked at each other.\u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what will happen. The Holy Buddha used his life to spy on the future and remind us that the Shaolin Temple must withstand this catastrophe,\u201d An upright monk said solemnly.\u201cYes, the Holy Buddha said don\u2019t be afraid before he died. Shaolin managed to remain standing for a thousand years because of our unity,\u201d The head of the Damo Hall said firmly.4Afterwards, they made arrangements for the corpse of the Holy Buddha as they waited for the heavy rain that was due to come tonight.\u2026Great Yan Dynasty.It was a small country located in a huge mountain range and that had many legends surrounding it. Unlike the Central Plains, there was an exotic atmosphere here.Temple of the Holy Maiden!1This was the most important temple in the Great Yan Dynasty. The masses referred to the Holy Maiden as the daughter of the gods and countless people worshipped her as one.In the Main Hall of the Holy Maiden Temple, there was only one woman inside. She wore a red dress that easily swayed side to side, her beautiful face had a strong exotic feel to it, and her every move was captivating.However, she didn\u2019t do anything to produce such an effect.This natural captivating effect that she had made countless men fall for her.But in the 25 years since her return, no man had ever gotten close to her.Tonight, she looked at the sky and whispered.\u201cThis world is going to change.

After 25 years, the spirit energy has only increased a little.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng thought silently.This was why all of those who managed to reach the Martial Sage Realm became stuck in the first step of the Martial Sage Realm, Profound Insight.Even Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t spared, he had been stuck for five years in the Profound Insight step. It was only when he took a trip to the Northwest Plains and executed that sword move did he manage to make a breakthrough to Life Knowing.Now, he was stuck in the Life Knowing step.It was obvious how slow the recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy was.The recovery was so slow that even the world itself started to become anxious.From the beginning of the previous winter until the spring of this year, the world itself was anxious all this time.Ordinary people couldn\u2019t see it because they didn\u2019t have the ability to sense it.Only a powerful Martial Sage noticed it.When the preparations were finally done, the world itself managed to gather a huge amount of spiritual energy that it would spill onto the world by tonight.Lin Jiufeng was waiting for this rain.The white cat was lying close to the window. It wasn\u2019t really aware of what was happening, but since Lin Jiufeng said it would rain tonight, it chose to accompany him and waited for the rain with him.Night descended, and the stars tonight were very bright.The moonlight was also extra resplendent and radiant.Like the moon on the 15th of the Chinese lunar\u00a0month1.The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng in confusion.Would it rain?Lin Jiufeng closed his eyes. He adjusted his body and adjusted his state to the peak.When the rain arrived, he would be able to make a breakthrough to the next stage.Time slowly passed minute by minute.At midnight, the moon crossed the galaxy, and the timing was in the wee hours.1Boom!At this moment, thunderclap reverberated throughout the entire world one after another, as if a god was raging and roaring at the world.The sound of thunder echoed between heaven and earth.Tick, tick, tick.Rain dropped down and landed on the eaves.The white cat looked at this in surprise. It actually rained.It couldn\u2019t help but stick its head out, wanting to take a look.Shuash!But in the very next second, the rainstorm came and the raindrops fell onto its face.Caught off guard, its fur got wet.The white cat hurriedly retracted its head and shook its head to shake off the rainwater.But as it was shaking its head, it stiffened all of a sudden.Why was there such a dense and large amount of spiritual energy in the rainwater?This amount of spiritual energy was so large that it couldn\u2019t believe it.The white cat couldn\u2019t help but look at Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng was already in a cultivation state.As rainwater fell, it carried with it dense amounts of spiritual energy.Howling gales blew the spiritual energy all over the mortal realm.This world was being nourished.This was the gift of heaven and earth to the world.2Lin Jiufeng had already started absorbing the spiritual energy in the air, his body entered a deep state of cultivation.Rumble!Outside were lightning and thunder, rain and wind.Inside the house, Lin Jiufeng was lying on the bed while listening to the rain and breaking through to the next step!The white cat learned from him. It knew that Lin Jiufeng was smarter, so it learned from Lin Jiufeng and started to cultivate too.2It also wanted to become stronger.It wanted to defeat Lin Jiufeng and step on him with its paws.5It wanted to show off its power and might.The white cat was already planning its revenge against Lin Jiufeng for constantly calling the words it wrote\u00a0\u2018ugly\u2019.\u2026Tonight, countless cultivators were surprised to discover that the concentration of spiritual energy in the world was increasing by leaps and bounds.50 times\u2026100 times\u2026Even hundreds of times\u2026Some people took in a breath of the spiritual energy and they immediately became bloated as they yelled in surprise.There were some old people that were on the verge of death. They were ambitious, but their bodies weren\u2019t capable enough for them to fulfill their ambitions anymore. Each of them had already come to terms regarding their deaths, and they were peaceful.1But the spiritual energy brought by this rain moisturized their dried bodies.1They were rejuvenated.They directly broke through their shackles.They directly broke through the restrictions on their cultivation base and gained a new lease in life.These old people were reduced to tears.Some old people even yelled. \u201cI really want to live another 500 years!\u201dThe old seniors that had constantly lived in seclusion for hundreds of years in their various sects and families crawled out of their coffins one after another.2\u201cThis is a totally different world now.\u201d\u201cThis is a world of great competition. I want to try to leave a legend in this world again.\u201d\u201cIt was passed down since ancient times that the world\u2019s energies would recover and the world will return to its previous glorious state 1500 years ago. Now, I have successfully waited for its arrival.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not in vain that I sealed myself for 500 years. I can look at this brand-new world with my eyes.\u201d\u201cFor the next 500 years, this world shall worship me as their master!\u201dDifferent old people said different things but without exception, their cultivation bases were all very high.Tonight, their bodies were rejuvenated.Then, they directly broke through to the Martial Sage Realm.2And some even continued to climb higher.Great Yan Dynasty, Temple of the Holy Maiden.The Holy Maiden was also currently absorbing the spiritual energy in the air.She couldn\u2019t help but comment in satisfaction. \u201cIt\u2019s indeed a new world now.\u201d\u201cThis is only the beginning and the amount of spiritual energy is already so huge. From now on, this world will be very exciting. Although I came into this world quite a number of years earlier, I still managed to establish a foundation in this world.\u201d5Then, she began to cultivate. As lighting flitted across the skies above her, her cultivation base broke through to the Martial Sage Realm.5But she didn\u2019t stop there as her breakthrough continued.\u2026Imperial capital.The powerhouses of the royal family were also frantically absorbing the spiritual energy in the air, including Lin Tianyuan, who suddenly discovered that he now had a hope of breaking through to the Martial Sage Realm.2How could he possibly let go of this opportunity and stop cultivating?Tonight, no one fought against each other.There were no quarrels, nor was there anyone that rested.Tonight, everybody cultivated in unison.And they achieved breakthroughs in their cultivation in unison.In the Cold Palace.The white cat\u2019s body shone in a fluorescent light. Deep within this light were traces of energies that it had absorbed back when it consumed those treasures in the underground palace.It was completely reborn.As for Lin Jiufeng, there wasn\u2019t any phenomenon on him.If becoming ordinary was a phenomenon, then indeed he has one phenomenon on him.Alone on the frost jade bed, listening to the rain as he made a breakthrough in his cultivation base. This was Lin Jiufeng\u2019s current state.The energies that he had accumulated after cultivating for more than 20 years, coupled with the two demonic cultivation techniques that he was simultaneously cultivating, plus a few sword techniques, and countless other techniques he obtained from signing in\u2026All of these combined caused him to crazily break through at this moment.2As his techniques and his insights into them collided and merged with each other\u2026Lin Jiufeng suddenly opened his eyes.He seemed to be able to see a fish happily swimming within the water droplets in the rain.In an instant, he reached the Fish Leap step of the Martial Sage Realm.Next was the Great Sage step.Which was also the final step of the Martial Sage Realm.Lin Jiufeng smiled slightly.This wasn\u2019t a problem for him anymore.With the help of the Demonic Great Refinement and the Ancient Demonic book, breaking through wasn\u2019t a problem to him anymore.\u2026Only a night passed, yet the world has changed dramatically.Countless cultivators made their own breakthroughs into their next realms.Even for the common people, the abundant spiritual energy in the world has healed their old illnesses and injuries.The seriously ill old people recovered their health.The dying were also redeemed.The Children became more intelligent.9All in all, a new era has officially arrived.1So in order to cope with the arrival of the new era, the first thing Lin Tianyuan did was to come and look for Lin Jiufeng.He knew that in this new era, the absolute strength of every individual would be greatly strengthened, and although it couldn\u2019t be said that Martial Sages could now be found everywhere, they were no longer that rare.Therefore, should he still carry out his plan?Lin Tianyuan needed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s guidance.But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t come out to see him.Lin Jiufeng was still working hard in his cultivation at this moment, so he didn\u2019t have the time to see anyone.\u201cEverything will proceed as per normal but you need to work harder in cultivating talents.\u201dLin Jiufeng only gave Lin Tianyuan these words, but the door to the Cold Palace remained closed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a result, the negative energy of this land was at its final dredges by the time Lin Jiufeng came to Sign-In.The so-called Land of Extremely Negative Energy wasn\u2019t that useful anymore.If not, then the trapped soul of Imperial Consort Jia in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy wouldn\u2019t be so weak that she couldn\u2019t even kill Lin Jiufeng who had only recently started cultivating back then.\u201cIt should be this rain that caused this huge change in the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. It made the true Land of Extremely Negative Energy appear.\u201dLin Jiufeng thought about it carefully and deduced.In the future, there would definitely be many terrifying places that would appear in this world.Therefore, he needed strength.Lin Jiufeng resolutely said, \u201cSign in!\u201d[Sign-In successful. Received the Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist!]3In the very next moment, an insight to the Great Dao and a fist intent appeared in his mind. It also included the true meaning of the Six Paths of Reincarnation.Lin Jiufeng was shocked.\u201cMaking the Six Paths of Reincarnation appear with one punch, this technique is indeed terrifying.\u201d4This world was still somewhat of a high-level martial type of world yesterday. Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strongest ability only enabled him to use his sword energy to kill enemies hundreds of miles away from where he was.But after the heavy rain, he immediately received the Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist after his usual routine of signing in today.Forcibly manifesting the Six Paths of Reincarnation with a punch to devour and destroy the enemy.2This world has completely turned into a fantasy-type of a world.1\u201cThe pinnacle of the martial path has increased in this brand-new world. There are more realms for me to break through now,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said in surprise.No one knew how many Great Grandmasters entered the Martial Sage Realm, and how many Martial Sages entered the Life Knowing step of the Martial Sage Realm after yesterday\u2019s rain.Even the white cat lying on the window ledge was emanating a formidable aura.It also managed to greatly progress in its cultivation.But the white cat\u2019s aura suddenly became violent all of a sudden.A wisp of black energy emerged from its body as it started to meow in pain.It made a mistake while cultivating?Lin Jiufeng frowned.The white cat was too hasty in its cultivation. It didn\u2019t manage to properly control the huge amount of spiritual energy it had accumulated in its body.Lin Jiufeng decisively reached out and grabbed the white cat into his hand as he infused his True Qi into its body.Under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s control, the white cat eventually recovered as it became calm.Then, it slowly opened its eyes.It immediately noticed that it was lying in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s palm.Its abdomen was facing Lin Jiufeng.Meow!The little white cat hurriedly jumped away from Lin Jiufeng.It looked at him angrily before writing a few words with its paw.\u201cWhy were you hugging me?\u201d\u201cYou made a mistake while cultivating,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said honestly.The white cat\u2019s anger lessened upon hearing his words.Lin Jiufeng was just helping it after all.Left without a choice, it could only write weakly on the floor. \u201cYou are not allowed to hold me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve made a breakthrough into a new realm, yet you still can\u2019t speak. You really are quite stupid.\u201d Lin Jiufeng shook his head. He had no intention of hugging the white cat at all.Although it felt quite good holding it.\u201cI broke through, but I still can\u2019t see through you.\u201d The little white cat wrote.\u201cBecause I also broke through into a new realm. A realm beyond your reach.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s mouth curled up as he said with a smile.\u2026The people around the world enthusiastically discussed the rain that fell last night.But a few days later, the rain was still falling non-stop.In the end, the rain lasted for a month.3Within this month, young talents rose up everywhere.Besides that, there were also powerful cultivators from hundreds of years ago that started to appear in the world. Their presence completely disrupted the originally peaceful world.Young geniuses and old experts appeared at the same period and competed against each other. Countless powerhouses were brought together in this new world, it was simply unimaginable.The power of each individual continued to rise, the imperial court\u2019s deterrent power was greatly reduced as various violations of the law and people who committed taboos emerged endlessly.Lin Tianyuan finally made up his mind to target the buddhist sects.An imperial decree was made.It ordered the demolition of the 80,000 monasteries and temples belonging to the Xuankong and Shaolin Temple. Of course, the buildings that their sects originally had were spared from this demolition order.However, millions of monks were ordered to renounce their faith and enter the secular world.Among them, the most sinful ones must be sent to the authorities to undergo a fair trial and receive the punishment they deserved after all this time.This imperial decree directly shocked the world.A new era was coming.This was an era where cultivators would undoubtedly flourish.Both Shaolin Temple and Xuankong Temple have a thousand-year heritage under their belts.With their deep foundations, they had talents in both the older and younger generations of monks.It was only 400 years ago when the Yuhua God Dynasty was established. It only had a few Martial Sages underneath its banner, yet the imperial court actually dared to take action against these powerful forces?The whole world instantly became lively.Everyone wanted to see how the Shaolin and Xuankong Temple would respond.Jiangnan!On a majestic mountain range, there were statues of Buddha everywhere. The highest mountain was the Shaolin Golden Peak. Every day when the sun rose, golden light would shine on this peak, making it look like the kingdom of Buddha.This was the base camp of Shaolin Temple, Shaoshi Mountain!It was written in Lin Tianyuan\u2019s imperial decree that except for the temples on this mountain, every large and small temple outside of this mountain were to be demolished.After the Shaolin Temple received the imperial decree, they immediately held a meeting.In the Damo Hall, hundreds of monks sat in rows.Boom!The head of Damo Hall slapped the table angrily as he said, \u201cOur Buddhist Sect had always been independent for thousands of years. No dynasty had ever interfered with us, and we also never undermined the imperial court.\u201d1\u201cWe even disseminated Buddhist classics so that the common people can live and work in peace\u2026\u201d\u201cBut now, what is the Yuhua God Dynasty trying to do with us?\u201d\u201cYes, the Yuhua God Dynasty is too much.\u201d\u201cIt has only been 400 years since the Yuhua God Dynasty was established, yet it\u2019s already so daring?\u201d\u201cShutting our temples is tantamount to destroying the foundation of the Shaolin Temple\u2026\u201d\u201cWe must definitely oppose this order to the end.\u201d\u201cI finally understand what catastrophe the Holy Buddha was talking about before he died, it turns out that it\u2019s from the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201dThe crowd of monks started their discussion.The abbot of Shaolin Temple raised his hand and said calmly, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be angry.\u201d\u201cThis is a new era, the seniors of our Shaolin have already made their breakthroughs\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Martial Sage Realm is no longer that difficult to reach anymore.\u201d\u201cSome of them has even reached the second step of the Martial Sage Realm, and there\u2019s also a senior who\u2019s attempting to break through to the third step, Fish Leap.\u201d\u201cThe Yuhua God Dynasty is a secular dynasty, they are only relying on the powerful Martial Sage hidden in their imperial capital. But he\u2019s just one person, how can he drastically change the world alone?\u201d\u201cThere is no need for our Shaolin Temple to respond personally. Let\u2019s just find some powerhouses that hate the Yuhua God Dynasty and we\u2019ll gather them together. I reckon that they will be enough to crush the Yuhua God Dynasty to death.\u201dThe abbot of Shaolin Temple carried a faint smile, but there was disdain in his smile. \u201cThis is the age of the cultivators, it isn\u2019t the age of the Yuhua God Dynasty anymore. Since they are not behaving, then let\u2019s just change the dynasty.\u201dAs soon as these words came out, the monks of Shaolin Temple became excited.The Shaolin Temple that had been passed down for thousands of years must be this domineering at the least.2How could they let themselves be bullied by a dynasty that has only been in existence for 400 years?There wasn\u2019t any reaction from Shaolin Temple at all.They acted as if they had never heard of this imperial decree.None of the temples under Shaolin Temple\u2019s command were demolished.Ignore!Shaolin Temple directly ignored the Yuhua God Dynasty and the Emperor\u2014Lin Tianyuan.However, Xuankong Temple was even more direct.After seeing the imperial decree, it immediately announced that it would build another 100 temples in the Jiangnan area. It hoped that its believers would actively donate money to help the Buddha build a golden body.In return, they would be blessed by Buddha for their donation.These two sects didn\u2019t give the Yuhua God Dynasty any face at all.But some people became curious as to why the Yuhua God Dynasty was treating the three buddhist sects completely different from each other despite the fact that their origins were the same.As an example, why didn\u2019t the Yuhua God Dynasty target Dalin Temple too?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It really makes one worry.\u201d\u2026The Shaolin Temple ignored the imperial decree from the Yuhua God Dynasty.The Xuankong Temple, on the other hand, even provoked the Yuhua God Dynasty by building hundreds of temples.Their attitude was clear. For them, the Yuhua God Dynasty was nothing.Everyone\u2019s eyes fell on the Yuhua God Dynasty, waiting to see how Emperor Ming\u2014Lin Tianyuan would react.Even people from within the Yuhua God Dynasty along with a few aristocratic families, as well as some wildly ambitious people, observed quietly.Emperor Ming actually had the guts to issue such an imperial decree. He made his decree known to the world and offended these buddhist sects. How would this matter come to an end?Forbidden City, Great Council Hall.Emperor Ming\u2014Lin Tianyuan wore a grim look on his face. He was enraged.3He heard of the Shaolin Temple\u2019s methods from his subjects and he snorted coldly.\u201cThey have no regard for the law.\u201dBut when he heard what the Xuankong Temple had done, he was even more infuriated.\u201cThey are challenging me, challenging the Yuhua God Dynasty!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty. The buddhist sects are powerful, and the people in the Jiangnan area believe in them piously.\u201d The Cabinet Chief persuaded.\u201cYour Majesty, take it slowly. We can\u2019t go head-to-head with them for now.\u201d The court officials advised Lin Tianyuan.But Lin Tianyuan was confident.2He was given the nod by Lin Jiufeng after all.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to say more. Continue the preparations. The extermination of the buddhist sects is imperative!\u201d Lin Tianyuan said firmly.\u201cYour Majesty, how should we proceed?\u201d The Cabinet Chief inquired.\u201cI have my ways!\u201d Lin Tianyuan said confidently.After dismissing the court officials, Lin Tianyuan could not sit still anymore.He left the palace immediately and went to look for Lin Jiufeng alone.If there were issues that he couldn\u2019t solve, ask Uncle.He had developed such a habit.In front of the Cold Palace, Lin Tianyuan knocked on the door and entered.Lin Jiufeng saw Lin Tianyuan. He asked calmly, \u201cWhy are you here again?\u201dLin Tianyuan\u2019s visits have been too frequent lately.\u201cUncle. The Shaolin and Xuankong Temple have no regard for the law.\u201dLin Tianyuan briefly explained everything.\u201cDon\u2019t you have more than a dozen Martial Sages under you?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cAfter the rain, the spiritual energy of the world is now extremely abundant. The Martial Sages that I have under me have become worthless overnight. I originally thought that a dozen Martial Sages would be enough, but now it\u2019s completely insufficient,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said bitterly.Plans always fall behind changes.Lin Jiufeng frowned before asking, \u201cWill your father\u2019s reforms be done after we\u2019ve exterminated those 80,000 or so temples?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty much it. The next step would be to stabilize the situation and improve the people\u2019s lives.\u201d Lin Tianyuan nodded.\u201cBring me paper and a brush.\u201d Lin Jiufeng waved his hand.Lin Tianyuan immediately ran out to take paper and a brush.The white cat walked out from the shadows as it wrote in crooked letters on the floor.\u201cWhy are you always helping him?\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at it and lamented.\u201cI\u2019m not helping him. I\u2019m helping my brother with his final wishes.\u201dEmperor Yuan fought for all of his life for the sake of reforms.Lin Tianyuan inherited Emperor Yuan\u2019s will and was also introducing the same reforms.But the situation was very complicated now.After the rain, the world had changed.Although Lin Tianyuan was the Emperor, there were not a lot of people whom he could trust.If Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t help him, the reforms would be impossible to accomplish.Helping Lin Tianyuan was to fulfill his brother\u2019s legacy.\u201cBut this will be the last time I\u2019ll help him. After eliminating those 80,000 temples, the Jiangnan region will become peaceful at once and the reforms will finally be completed.\u201d Lin Jiufeng murmured.2In the future, Lin Tianyuan would be on his own.1Lin Jiufeng would finally be able to continue his routine of silently signing in while pursuing the peak of martial arts.The white cat understood. It wrote and asked, \u201cAre you going to Jiangnan, then?\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head. He softly replied, \u201cThe current buddhist sects are not worthy for me to travel to Jiangnan personally!\u201dThe white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng, shocked.It wanted to inquire further, but Lin Tianyuan had already returned.Hence, the little white cat could only scratch a few times on the ground haphazardly to cross out the words that it had written.1Lin Jiufeng had seen the words it wrote, but he didn\u2019t care that much about it.But the white cat was too proud to let others see its crooked words.\u201cUncle, I brought with me the four treasures of the study.\u201d2Lin Tianyuan placed the items on the stone table respectfully.Lin Jiufeng lifted a brush and began painting.He painted the image of a grass, trees, and a sword.It was a very simple composition of green grass, river, trees, distant mountains, slanting sun, village\u2026Lin Jiufeng painted a second picture.A young man was practicing his moves with a horse stance, throwing out punches.After painting two pictures, Lin Jiufeng put down the brush.Lin Tianyuan blinked as he looked at Lin Jiufeng and asked, \u201cUncle, what does this mean?\u201dTwo simple paintings.He was here to ask for help, not to ask for paintings.Lin Jiufeng replied, \u201cLet two Martial Sages each bring a painting and your imperial decree to the Shaolin and Xuankong Temple. If they don\u2019t obey the imperial decree, open the paintings.\u201dLin Tianyuan was confused.That was it?That was enough to get the agreement of these two delinquent sects?Lin Jiufeng did not explain any further.He folded both paintings and put them aside.\u201cRemember, don\u2019t open them in advance. Lives will be lost.\u201d Lin Jiufeng smiled slightly and let Lin Tianyuan leave.Lin Tianyuan took the two paintings in a daze before he returned to the Forbidden City.The white cat came out and wrote curiously. \u201cTwo paintings, are you trying to deceive him?\u201d\u201cTwo paintings are enough. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the two sects are in different places, one painting would be enough already,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said softly.\u201cWhat did you draw on the paper?\u201d The white cat was very curious.Lin Jiufeng thought seriously for a moment before he answered.\u201cI drew Human Gods!\u201d1The white cat stared at Lin Jiufeng in horror.7Lin Jiufeng smiled faintly at it, his temperament became warm like a spring breeze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Lin Tianyuan did not believe that the two paintings could solve the problem he was facing about the buddhist sects, he did not dare to open them.He still listened to Lin Jiufeng.1Lin Tianyuan thought for a while before he ordered.\u201cCall Cangshan and Beihai here.\u201dThe eunuch immediately left to look for them.Cangshan and Beihai were a pair of brothers.They were unaffiliated cultivators, however, they were very talented.Soon after the world\u2019s spiritual energy recovered, they broke through to the Martial Sage Realm.With the rebellion of Lord Taiping, Lin Tianyuan felt a great sense of crisis and began to recruit these unaffiliated cultivators.The two of them came, and they had been working for Lin Tianyuan since.Lin Tianyuan prepared a lot of resources for them, and they each took what they needed.After a while, two old men walked in.Each cupped their fists and said, \u201cGreetings, Your Majesty!\u201d\u201cI hope two of you can go to Jiangnan.\u201d Lin Tianyuan said.Cangshan and Beihai looked at each other, they were reluctant to obey this order.\u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s not that we are unwilling, but it\u2019s that the Shaolin and Xuankong Temple are very powerful. Although we brothers are Martial Sage cultivators, we are only at the Life Knowing step\u2026\u201d1\u201cWe\u2019re not enough to go against these two great powers that have existed for thousands of years,\u201d Cangshan said bitterly.He didn\u2019t want to go to Jiangnan.Was there anyone who didn\u2019t know what happened between the buddhist sects and Emperor Ming of the Yuhua God Dynasty?Asking them to go to the Jiangnan area at this time would be tantamount to sending them to their deaths, wouldn\u2019t it?They were living comfortable lives under Lin Tianyuan and were also willing to perform some dangerous tasks for him.But there was a difference between danger and certain death.Lin Tianyuan knew what the two men were thinking.Thus, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not sending you there to deal with the two powerful factions, but for you to read the imperial decree. After the two powerful factions received it and agreed to it, there should be no need to fight.\u201dCangshan and Beihai weren\u2019t convinced.If the buddhist sects accepted the imperial decree, they would not have to fight.But what if they did not agree?Beihai was a plump old man.He was straightforward and he couldn\u2019t help ask, \u201cWhat if\u2026 what if they don\u2019t agree?\u201dLin Tianyuan picked up the two paintings Lin Jiufeng gave to him and said, \u201cOne painting for each of you. If they don\u2019t agree, unfold the paintings.\u201dCangshan and Beihai stared at the painting in Lin Tianyuan\u2019s hand with suspicious looks on their faces.What was this?These two paintings were enough to take care of the two powerful factions whose teachings had been passed down for thousands of years?Similar to Lin Tianyuan\u2014they couldn\u2019t believe it.Therefore, they still refused to agree.\u201cThese two paintings were painted by that senior in the imperial capital.\u201dSeeing that they refused to agree, Lin Tianyuan had to tell them the truth.Cangshan and Beihai looked at Lin Tianyuan in surprise.\u201cIs it that senior from ten years ago?\u201d Cangshan asked in excitement.Ten years ago, while the world was still in the midst of its recovery, both Cangshan and Beihai weren\u2019t Martial Sage Realm cultivators back then.But they heard about that terrifying senior in the imperial capital who killed nine Martial Sages with a single stroke of the sword.More than ten years have passed since then.Both of them were already Martial Sage Realm cultivators at the step of Life Knowing.Just how powerful was that senior by now?Cangshan said excitedly, \u201cThat senior really said that?\u201d\u201cYes. I asked him how to calm the issue in Jiangnan. He told me that this is all I have to do and that is why I have asked you to go.\u201d Lin Tianyuan told them the truth.If he did not tell the truth, no one would be foolish enough to go.If he sent people who were less powerful than these two, it would be useless.They might not even be able to enter the gates of both Shaolin and Xuankong Temple.Cangshan and Beihai looked at each other before they nodded in tacit understanding.\u201cYour Majesty, we will accept this task,\u201d Cangshan said solemnly.Lin Tianyuan was overjoyed as he said in a hurry. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will tell the world about this matter, so everyone will know that you are going to Jiangnan with the imperial decree.\u201d\u201cThere should be no problems.\u201dCangshan and Beihai nodded in agreement.By informing the world, there would be an extra guarantee for their safety.\u201cAlso, don\u2019t open these two paintings before the opportune moment. Lives will be lost, so you must remember.\u201d Lin Tianyuan reminded them.This was also Lin Jiufeng\u2019s reminder to him.The expressions on the faces of the two immediately turned serious.\u201cYour Majesty, rest assured. We promise to complete this task,\u201d The two said at the same time.\u201cI will write the imperial decree for you now. Each of you will go to one of the buddhist sects.\u201dLin Tianyuan began to write the imperial decree.He thought about it for a while and with a flick of his sleeve, he wrote a strict reprimand letter as his thoughts burst forth like a fountain.\u201cTake it to Jiangnan. I will inform the world immediately.\u201dLin Tianyuan handed the imperial decree to them.Cangshan and Beihai bowed their heads and retreated. With the imperial decree and Lin Jiufeng\u2019s paintings in hand, they headed to Jiangnan.After they left the Forbidden City, the Yuhua God Dynasty began to publicize this matter.Emperor Ming\u2014Lin Tianyuan\u2014wrote two imperial decrees.They were to be carried and read by the two Martial Sages at the Shaolin and Xuankong Temple in Jiangnan.The whole world was waiting for Lin Tianyuan\u2019s counterattack\u2014waiting for the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s counterattack.As soon as the news was released, it spread all over the land like wildfire.It spread to Jiangnan faster than Cangshan and Beihai\u2019s traveling speed.1They were Martial Sages and they moved extremely fast.3But before they could even reach Jiangnan, the news had already spread all over Jiangnan.Both Shaolin Temple and Xuankong Temple received the news.The Shaolin Temple remained silent as if it had not heard anything.They did not express any opinions.They had built their own temples and under their command, none of them would be demolished.In contrast to the Shaolin Temple, the people from the Xuankong Temple welcomed the news.\u201cCome to my Xuankong Temple, lose three thousand troubles, and forget the troubles of the world. We will save these two messengers.\u201dThis was a blatant threat.Xuankong Temple was as arrogant as ever.They were monks, but they were arrogant and domineering.They had always been like this.When Cangshan and Beihai arrived in Jiangnan, it was already two days later.In just two days, rumors in Jiangnan were rife.Countless descendants of powerful factions, sects, and even the descendants of aristocratic families, as well as outstanding unaffiliated cultivators, had gathered at both the Shaolin and Xuankong Temple.They wanted to know how these two buddhist sects would deal with Emperor Ming\u2019s messengers and how they would deal with the imperial decrees that were bound to arrive.The crowd was bustling and lively.Everyone was looking forward to the arrival of Cangshan and Beihai.The two men were shocked.\u201cThe situation seemed to have escalated,\u201d Cangshan said. He looked uneasy.\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d\u201cWe have the paintings given by that senior. I believe they will work.\u201d Beihai trusted Lin Jiufeng.It was no small feat for Lin Jiufeng to have gained his trust without ever having met him before.\u201cI also believe in him. Since we\u2019re already here, there\u2019s no reason to retreat.\u201dCangshan took a deep breath and asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201dBeihai stretched out his hand and said firmly, \u201cI\u2019m going to Shaolin Temple!\u201d\u201cThen, I will go to Xuankong Temple. Let\u2019s part ways here!\u201dCangshan cupped his fists in farewell.\u201cTake care!\u201d Beihai said solemnly.\u201cWe have the senior\u2019s paintings. It will be fine.\u201d Cangshan smiled and said confidently.3They headed to different places and both arrived at the foot of the mountains where the temples were located at the same time.Countless people witnessed their arrival. All eyes were on them.The doors of Shaolin Temple and Xuankong Temple were also open, allowing the two to enter.Cangshan and Beihai held the imperial decree in their hands and with Lin Jiufeng\u2019s painting in their pockets\u2014they stepped firmly on the steps.\u2026Imperial Capital, Cold Palace!Lin Jiufeng laid on the frost jade bed.He closed his eyes and calmed his mind, feeling serene.\u201cHave you broken through to the Human God Realm?\u201d the white cat asked curiously.This was not the first time that the white cat had asked this question to Lin Jiufeng in the past few days.But Lin Jiufeng never answered it directly.However, the white cat persevered.\u201cYou\u2019ll know in about two days,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But we will not be put in the hands of the imperial court either.\u201d After reading the decree, the abbot said coldly.\u201cToday, Emperor Ming of the Yuhua God Dynasty wrote these words to humiliate my Shaolin Temple, this is a great insult to Buddha.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t leave\u2026\u201d\u201cShaolin Temple will also pay a visit to that Emperor Ming.\u201d The abbot was really angry.He pointed with his finger and spoke aggressively.He wanted to capture Beihai and preach to him the teachings of Buddhism to make the Yuhua God Dynasty suffer a big loss once he was converted to their ranks.The people around watched, they were not surprised with this outcome at all.After all, the Shaolin Temple was not that easy to mess with!\u201cYou want to keep me here? I\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to do that.\u201d Beihai shook his head.\u201cEighteen Arhats are here, who dares to be presumptuous in my Shaolin?!\u201d Eighteen loud shouts converged into one voice.The Eighteen Arhats with each of them in the Martial Sage Realm jumped forward.They surrounded Beihai.\u201cShaolin has the Eighteen Arhats. They are enough to suppress you.\u201dThe abbot of Shaolin Temple said with a cold face.\u201cI don\u2019t think so!\u201d Beihai was still not afraid.\u201cHow can you\u2014a mere Martial Sage\u2014fight against eighteen of them alone?\u201dThe abbot snickered.The onlookers from the major factions and the people from Shaolin Temple shook their heads simultaneously.They thought Emperor Ming had made a bad move, letting a Martial Sage come to Shaolin Temple on his own.Did Emperor Ming send him here to die?They looked at the Eighteen Martial Sages as they lamented and praised Shaolin Temple\u2019s profound heritage.But Beihai said, \u201cWhen I left the imperial capital, I brought along a painting that senior painted.\u201dEveryone looked at each other.At this moment, what was Beihai talking about?\u201cThe painting is with me.\u201d Beihai held out the folded painting.Everyone could not help but look over.Ordinary.It was just a piece of folded-up writing paper.What could it do to save Beihai?The abbot said mockingly, \u201cHave you gone crazy from being too afraid?\u201d\u201cAre you spouting rubbish here?\u201d The abbot said disdainfully.Beihai shook his head. He said in a serious tone, \u201cI\u2019ve been living in the imperial capital. More than ten years ago, I saw a sword with my own eyes. More than ten years later, the senior painted this picture. I believe in him, hence I just want to tell you about it.\u201d\u201cThat mysterious expert in the imperial capital may be powerful, but that was more than ten years ago. After the rain, Martial Sages are everywhere. What can he do by himself?\u201dThe abbot looked at Beihai indifferently, as if he was looking at a mentally disabled person who had lost his mind.2That person drew a picture and gave it to Beihai as a last resort.Then, Beihai trusted it and he came to Shaolin Temple enthusiastically.Now, he\u2019s even trying to open this painting to make Shaolin Temple submit.This was a huge joke.Shaolin Temple found it preposterous.The people from the major factions did not believe in it either.What kind of power could a piece of paper have?Beihai was surrounded by everyone.Seeing that everyone did not believe his words, he took a deep breath and opened up the painting directly.Everyone looked on with sarcasm thick on their faces as they laughed mockingly, they were obviously treating Beihai in disdain.However, after Beihai opened the painting\u2026Boom!The entire Mount Song suddenly trembled.Six huge black holes suddenly materialized in the air as it rotated rapidly.They were like six abysses, and an immensely violent force descended upon them.Dong! Dong! Dong!A terrifying sense of oppression descended upon them.Everyone\u2019s knees turned weak and they all knelt down at once.Whether it was the abbot, or the Eighteen Arhats, or the people from the major factions, or the Shaolin Temple elders\u2026They all knelt down.The only one standing was Beihai.Beihai\u2019s mouth opened wide. He couldn\u2019t close his mouth at all.His expression was lifeless for a while, then he suddenly became excited.He was so excited that he was trembling, words could not describe his feelings at this moment.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d\u201cThis is the painting that senior gave me.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a kid practicing his moves on the painting, he is practicing\u2026 this terrifying move?\u201d\u201cThe painting came to life.\u201dBeihai looked over in excitement.The painting that he opened\u2014was a painting of a young man practicing his moves.At this moment, the young man had come to life.He was practicing his moves!The move he was practicing was the Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist!And this young man contained a wisp of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s spiritual consciousness.So at this moment, with one move, the Six Paths of Reincarnation appeared and suppressed the entire Shaolin Temple.The Shaolin Temple abbot trembled as he said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201dHe knelt down.He couldn\u2019t stand up.The terrifying pressure held him down.If not for his strong killing intent, the abbot thought that he would\u2019ve been dead already.Everyone looked at the sky, shocked.Six large, dark holes spun rapidly in the sky.It forced them to kneel down in front of Beihai.In Shaolin Temple, an elderly Martial Sage raised his head in shock as he said in horror.1\u201cThis\u2026 this is\u2026 a Human God!\u201d3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: A Human God in the Mortal RealmShaoshi Mountain, on the square in front of the Mahavira Hall.Everyone present was kneeling on the ground.Among them were\u2014monks, Daoists, ladies, old people, and children\u2026These people came from the factions that had gathered here to watch the show. They wanted to see how the conflict between Shaolin Temple and the Yuhua God Dynasty would be resolved.But who would have expected such an outcome?Thousands of people were forced to kneel down, unable to move.The more they struggled, the more uncomfortable they felt.That extremely intense fist aura was akin to a raging flame.It made them feel as if they were burning.It truly was uncomfortable.This was a shocking scene.Beihai took out a mere painting and he instantly suppressed Shaolin Temple. Even those people who came to Shaolin Temple to watch the show were suppressed too.They felt terrible.If they knew that something like this was about to happen, then they wouldn\u2019t have come here to watch the show. This truly was an unfortunate catastrophe.The monks of Shaolin Temple were still struggling.All of them were angry. They felt humiliated.However, when the old monk spoke, everyone fell silent.The abbot of Shaolin Temple turned his head in disbelief.His eyes were bloodshot as he stared at the old monk and cried out, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201dThe old monk said with difficulty. \u201cI said this might is\u2026 is from a Human God!\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d The abbot denied vehemently. He shook his head frantically. Although he was still kneeling, his face was full of panic.\u201cSince the death of the last Human God 1,500 years ago, there has never been a new Human God!\u201d\u201cThis might is indeed very powerful, but it\u2019s definitely impossible that it\u2019s from a Human God!\u201dThe abbot found an excuse for himself.He refused to believe that this boundless might belonged to that of a Human God.If it was true, then Shaolin Temple would be utterly defeated and unable to resist.The countless temples and monasteries that Shaolin Temple had accumulated for hundreds of years, their large number of believers and treasures, all of these things would be taken away.Therefore, this might must never be from a Human God!But there was nothing that he could.The old monk\u2019s words shocked everyone present.Including Beihai.He was surprised and delighted.He was trembling as he held the painting in his hand.Excitement!He only had this one feeling welling up his chest at this moment.A Human God!That mysterious Senior was actually a Human God\u2026Unbelievable.\u201cNo wonder Emperor Ming was so confident to let Cangshan and me come here all by ourselves.\u201d Beihai was so excited that he started to admire Emperor Ming, Lin Tianyuan.Compared to Beihai\u2019s excitement\u2014the others were afraid.They trembled amidst their shock and disbelief.As these emotions surfaced in everyone\u2019s hearts, their feelings soon became complicated.\u201cNo god is supposed to exist in this Mortal Realm!\u201d Someone cried out involuntarily.His expression was both envious and terrified.They felt proud of breaking through the Martial Sage Realm with the help of that rain.They thought back then that they had already reached the peak of cultivation.After all, they had become Martial Sages.It didn\u2019t matter if someone was at the second, third, or at the fourth step of the Martial Sage Realm.They were still Martial Sages in the end.Those who were only a level one Martial Sage were also Martial Sages.If those Martial Sages whose cultivations were at the highest step of the Martial Sage could be considered to be at the peak of cultivation. Then, those who were at the earlier steps of the same Martial Sage Realm should also be considered a member of those at the apex.But now, only a mere painting was unfolded, yet they were immediately crushed by a boundless pressure coming from the terrifying fist technique contained within the painting.Even Martial Sages had no other choice but to kneel before this aura.The Martial Sage realm was no longer the peak of cultivation in this Mortal Realm.It was because\u2014a Human God had appeared.The old monk coughed and stammered. \u201cThe paper used for this painting is nothing out of the ordinary, and so is the ink. The painting was also casually made. So this painting shouldn\u2019t even amount to anything.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cThis painting was drawn by a Human God. It contains his aura and a wisp of his spiritual consciousness. We are unable to resist it.\u201d\u201cThe scriptures told us that Human Gods are terrifying existences that can exist and live as a personification of their spiritual wills. Thus, they would not die even if their bodies are destroyed,\u201d the old monk said in despair.His words caused the abbot of Shaolin Temple to also close his eyes in despair.Everyone else finally believed him at this moment.A new Human God has appeared in this Mortal Realm.And this Human God achieved this on his own in this Mortal Realm.\u201cNo wonder the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty dared to attack the Buddhist Sects.\u201d\u201cShaolin Temple and Xuankong Temple are in big trouble this time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is a terrifying catastrophe. But it\u2019s their fortune that this Human God doesn\u2019t seem to be planning to start a massacre. Otherwise, there would definitely be rivers of blood flowing in front of the Shaolin Temple\u2019s Mahavira Hall now.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s kneel properly. We won\u2019t be on the losing end by kneeling to a Human God.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 I originally thought that after the rain, the Imperial Court would no longer be a threat. But now, it seems like we will still be governed by the Imperial Court as usual.\u201d\u201cWe will have to see how the abbot handles this disaster.\u201dThe abbot of Shaolin Temple could hear the discussion of the spectators.He was in a daze.An old monk who was on his last breath seemed to appear in front of him.Holy Buddha!Before he died, he said that there was a great calamity coming its way to Shaolin Temple.He also told them, \u2018don\u2019t\u2026\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d The abbot of Shaolin Temple laughed bitterly.They thought it meant, \u2018don\u2019t be afraid\u2019.But in reality, it was, \u2018don\u2019t resist\u2019.\u201cHoly Buddha, I finally understand\u2026\u201dThe abbot of Shaolin Temple sighed and looked up at Beihai.Then, he slowly raised the imperial decree in his hand and loudly announced.\u201cShaolin Temple will obey the Imperial Decree!\u201dThe crowd in the area fell silent.The abbot had relented.And the truth was\u2014he was afraid.He didn\u2019t dare to go against the Yuhua God Dynasty, nor did he dare to try and endure the wrath of a Human God.The monks of Shaolin Temple also knew what would happen if they resisted.The outcome of their stubborn resistance would definitely be very miserable.Fortunately, the Yuhua God Dynasty had left this mountain for them to live.Beihai looked at the abbot who was still holding up the imperial decree in a respectful bow.Seeing this, Beihai closed the painting and kept it with satisfaction.The oppressive might immediately vanished.Countless people gasped for breath as they crawled up shakily when the oppressive might vanished.The previous scene felt surreal\u2014almost like a dream to everyone.But when they touched their backs and felt the cold sweat that drenched their clothes, they couldn\u2019t help but look at each other as they saw the bitter smiles and looks of shock in each other\u2019s eyes.A Human God was too terrifying\u2026This was just a painting drawn by that Human God.It didn\u2019t carry any intent to kill nor to attack, yet it managed to suppress them until they became akin to meat on a butcher\u2019s chopping block.What would happen if they saw a Human God in the flesh?They might just die on the spot\u2026Beihai put away the folded painting and then said to the abbot of Shaolin Temple.\u201cWithin three months, demolish all the monasteries other than those on this mountain. Every monk that have committed heinous crimes must renounce Asceticism. Buddhism is not a safe haven for evil. Those monks must be escorted to the authorities. No delays are permitted.\u201dThe abbot of Shaolin Temple could no longer be arrogant this time.He bowed slightly and said with a trembling voice. \u201cI\u2026 I understand!\u201dHis heart ached when he was done.\u201cHowever, a large portion of those monasteries belongs to the Xuankong Temple. We have no right to dismantle them,\u201d the abbot sighed and explained.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. The current Xuankong Temple\u2019s feelings must be exactly the same as you lot.\u201dBeihai couldn\u2019t help but laugh upon remembering that Cangshan was holding another similar painting to his.The abbot and the others shuddered at the thought of that terrifying scene.They didn\u2019t want to experience that feeling ever again.\u2026Xuankong Temple!The originally lively Xuankong Temple.The arrogant and overbearing Xuankong Temple.The haughty Xuankong Temple.At this moment, every monk from Xuankong Temple was kneeling on the ground. They trembled as they gasped for air.Cangshan had opened the painting he was tasked to carry and a scene of a garden appeared around him.Green grass, rivers, trees, distant mountains, slanted hills, villages\u2026These vivid images appeared before everyone\u2019s eyes.It was serene and profound.Only the green grass was emitting a terrifying sword aura as it swayed.A sword beam suppressed the Headmaster of the Xuankong Temple.\u201cDo you accept the decree?\u201d Cangshan took out the imperial decree and looked at Xuankong Temple\u2019s Headmaster in anticipation.The Headmaster of Xuankong Temple wore a defeated look on his face. Then, he knelt on the ground and said bitterly, \u201cI accept the decree!\u201dHow could he have imagined that there was a Human God in this Mortal Realm?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: The Gods in the Eyes of MortalsThe Xuankong Temple and Shaolin Temple\u2026These two holy lands of Buddhism had relented under the pressure of a Human God.They had no intentions of resisting.Meanwhile, everyone in Jiangnan was still filled with anticipation.Those who didn\u2019t go to the two buddhist sects to watch the show were waiting for the results.They wanted to see how the buddhist sects would humiliate the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s envoys.They also wanted to see if the two buddhists sects would tear apart Emperor Ming\u2019s imperial decree into pieces.But when the news came\u2026Those who heard it were immediately stupefied.Their bodies trembled as if they had gone senile.A Human God!That was a Human God!Such an existence actually appeared just like that!In an instant, the world was thrown into a commotion.It was as if a huge mountain had crashed into a calm lake.As if mountains were collapsing and tsunamis were raging.It was like burning oil was poured on everyone.The entire world descended into an uproar upon hearing this news.A Human God had appeared in the Yuhua God Dynasty.This was the first Human God in 1,500 years.There was no doubt that there was no second Human God in this world yet.In the past 1,500 years, a Human God had never once appeared.The legends of this realm had already been forgotten.Many people treated this realm as a myth and a legend.They were unwilling to believe that it even existed.With the passing of so many years, the people were now less inclined to believe in the existence of Human Gods in the past.But after that rain, the first Human God made his presence known with the help of two paintings that suppressed the two buddhist sects. Such news finally convinced everyone that Human Gods had once existed.Moreover, they finally believed that there was a Human God Realm.Those at the third step of the Martial Sage Realm couldn\u2019t help but exclaim when they heard this news.\u201cWhy let such a legend appear in the same period as me?!\u201dThey only managed to reach the third step of the Martial Sage Realm after that rain.Even if there were others who were at the fourth step, there could only be a handful of them.As for the Human God Realm?They didn\u2019t even dare to think about it.Everything that happened so far felt so surreal.\u2026Great Yan Dynasty, Temple of the Holy Maiden.The Holy Maiden clad in red stood tall, her eyes were bright as she looked at the letter in her hand.She couldn\u2019t help but be surprised. \u201cI never thought that there would be such a genius in this world. He became a Human God just after the rain.\u201d\u201cEven I\u2014isn\u2019t that fast\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is indeed a new world that is full of life.\u201dThe cultivation base of the Holy Maiden also increased at breakneck speeds.She was now on the fourth step of the Martial Sage Realm\u2014the Great Sage step.However, she was still far from reaching the Human God Realm.\u201cUnfortunately for you, my experience is abundant. It won\u2019t be a problem for me to catch up and surpass you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve just ascended to the Human God Realm\u2026\u201d\u201cHaving just recently broken through, your cultivation speed will undoubtedly slow down,\u201d the Holy Maiden said with confidence.She truly believed that it wouldn\u2019t take that long for her to arrive at the Human God Realm.\u201cWhen I make my breakthrough, every flower will bloom and their fragrance will pervade the world!\u201dThe Holy Maiden vowed.\u2026Yuhua God Dynasty, Imperial Capital.Lin Tianyuan was stunned and overjoyed when he received the news from Jiangnan.His Uncle was actually a Human God.This was simply terrifying.His trump card was even more powerful now.Lin Tianyuan immediately left the Forbidden City and rushed to the remote Cold Palace to visit and congratulate his Uncle.\u201cNephew congratulates Uncle on becoming a Human God in this Mortal Realm.\u201dBut this time, he was rejected.The door to the Cold Palace didn\u2019t open.Furthermore, Lin Jiufeng also told him. \u201cFrom today onwards, your father\u2019s reforms are now in place. The temples and monasteries have been demolished and the residents of the Empire are now living in peace. Everything is moving towards the completion of your father\u2019s dream.\u201d\u201cFrom now on, you will have to depend on yourself.\u201dLin Tianyuan stared blankly.His excitement instantly vanished.He knelt outside the Cold Palace. He couldn\u2019t help but cry out. \u201cIs Uncle going to abandon me?\u201d\u201cYou have already matured.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t always depend on me whenever you encounter problems anymore. You don\u2019t have to come here in the future. I can protect you for a while, but I can\u2019t protect you forever. You are the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty, not me!\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cold voice sounded in his ears.Lin Tianyuan knew that there was no way he could change his Uncle\u2019s mind.Come to think of it, he had troubled his Uncle quite a few times in the past few years.Whenever he encountered danger, the first thing he thought of was his Uncle.With Lin Jiufeng around, he felt extremely confident.As a result, he was becoming more and more dependent on Lin Jiufeng.Without Lin Jiufeng\u2019s support, he started to panic as his breathing quickened.But he seemed to have forgotten that Lin Jiufeng had taken care of him on the account that he was of Emperor Yuan\u2019s bloodline.\u201cUncle, please take care of yourself. I will not disturb you anymore.\u201dLin Tianyuan kowtowed and left.His greatest trump card was no longer useful.He had to go back and properly manage the Yuhua God Dynasty.Fortunately, although he was unable to get his Uncle\u2019s help, he was still able to use Lin Jiufeng\u2019s name to deter and frighten other people.In addition, he was the only one who knew about this matter.In the Cold Palace, the white cat looked at Lin Tianyuan\u2019s back and wrote on the courtyard walls. \u201cAre you not going to help him anymore?\u201dLin Jiufeng nodded his head. \u201cUnless there\u2019s a great danger, I won\u2019t help.\u201d\u201cYou could have told him about this.\u201d The white cat wrote crookedly.\u201cIf I told him about it, he will definitely become confident and think that he could act without any worries since I am backing him. That\u2019s not good at all.\u201d Lin Jiufeng shook his head.This was why Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t give Lin Tianyuan any hope that he would help the latter. This way, Lin Tianyuan would have to work hard for the sake of the Empire\u2019s stability.\u201cYou broke through to the Human God Realm?\u201d The white cat asked the crucial question.Its eyes were bright and sparkling as it looked at Lin Jiufeng in excitementA Human God!This was the same realm as its master, the Demon Lord.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Lin Jiufeng admitted.\u201cWhen did you break through? The white cat asked curiously.\u201cOn that rainy night,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said after some thought.That rain was a blessing to everyone in the world.Those asleep that night was still nourished by the rain.But cultivators obtained the greatest benefits.Lin Jiufeng was the one who benefited the most.He passed the threshold of Fish Leap and Great Sage\u2026To ascend to the Human God Realm.But this was also because Lin Jiufeng had accumulated a lot of experience.The two great demonic techniques, various sword techniques, and the Six Paths of Reincarnation Fist\u2026These were Lin Jiufeng\u2019s trump cards for breaking through to the Human God realm.\u201cWhat has been different since you\u2019ve become a Human God?\u201d The white cat wrote.Lin Jiufeng thought for a moment before he explained\u2026\u201cThe Human God Realm is different from all the other realms due to the addition of the power of the Divine Soul. With this, one can look at the world differently than others. Furthermore, Human God Realm cultivators can also use the \u2018Force\u2019.\u201dThe name of Human God was just for ordinary people.The term, \u2018Human God\u2019 was coined by the ordinary people back then.An ordinary person could at most live for a hundred years or so, while a Human God could live for at least eight hundred years.In fact, there was even a record of the longest-living Human God. That Human God managed to live for 1,800 years after using all sorts of methods to extend his lifespan.There was also the divine soul. With his eyes closed, he could roam the world and pry into the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth.There was also the Divine Soul. With his eyes closed, he could freely roam the world and pry into the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth.He could also finally utilize the \u2018Force\u2019.With a flick of his wrist, mountains would collapse and rivers would flow backwards.To mortals, what was such an existence if not a god?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Innate Soul Refining TechniqueAfter breaking through to the Human God Realm, Lin Jiufeng realized that a Human God was just someone standing at a different summit than the others.The lowest lifespan of a Human God was 800 years.Lin Jiufeng had enough time up his sleeves.Now that the buddhist sects of the Jiangnan Province had submitted and obeyed the imperial decree, the next three months would be the assimilation of those who believe in Buddhism and the annexation of their territories and assets.The gilded Buddha statues, the occupied lands, the high-quality fields, and the millions of laborers would greatly strengthen the Yuhua God Dynasty.Lin Tianyuan would certainly be occupied handling all of these.After the two paintings appeared in Jiangnan Province, the world became quiet.At first, with the appearance of the rain that strengthened every cultivator\u2019s strength, Martial Sages became abundant throughout the land. Thus, the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s threat in the eyes of its enemies had diminished.If nothing had happened, its enemies would inevitably reappear and cause chaos in the entire Yuhua God Dynasty.Furthermore, the Yuhua God Dynasty certainly didn\u2019t have the ability to deal with a catastrophe of this scale.But all of a sudden, a Human God appeared and suppressed the buddhist sects along with the entire world.The Human God\u2019s appearance alleviated the great danger that the Yuhua God Dynasty was facing and also gave them a lot of time in respite.This was the last thing that Lin Jiufeng did for Lin Tianyuan.He gave Lin Tianyuan enough time to accumulate and consolidate the strength of the Empire for it to maintain its dignity in this brand new world.Of course, Lin Jiufeng was also ultimately preventing the destruction of the recently established reforms.Therefore, Lin Tianyuan was very busy.Lin Jiufeng was also occupied.He was busy with his cultivation after having made his breakthrough. After entering the Human God Realm, his cultivation was no longer simply Qi Cultivation, Qi absorption, Qi accumulation, and opening up new meridians.If he wanted to advance in his current realm, he had to cultivate his Divine Soul, observe the world\u2019s Forces, and comprehend the principles of the world itself.With these conditions, the difficulty of his cultivation had understandably increased.Fortunately, Lin Jiufeng could cultivate in silence. Thus, there was no need for him to worry.After all, no one was here to disturb him.While the world was still in a heated discussion over the appearance of a Human God.Lin Jiufeng had already begun the next steps in his cultivation.Lin Jiufeng could perfectly inherit both aspects of progressing steadily and improving quickly.He was capable of both stable progression and speedy advancement. But he planned on consolidating his cultivation for a while and accumulating enough experience so that he could advance by leaps and bounds at once.Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t hear the rumors from the outside world.Hence, he signed in quietly in the Cold Palace.His only companion was the white cat.On this day, Lin Jiufeng asked the white cat. \u201cYou followed the Demon Lord last time, so how much do you know about the Human God Realm?\u201dThe white cat used its small white paws to write. \u201cI heard from the Demon Lord that there are many obstacles in the Human God Realm.\u201d\u201cIt seems to be called something like Serene, Immortal Treasury, Ultimate Man, or something like that.\u201d The white cat\u2019s writing was all over the place.Its memory seemed to be blurry as it kept erasing some words and changing them into something else.Lin Jiufeng shook his head, speechless.In the end, he chose to leave the Cold Palace for the royal library.Here, he could check relevant documents concerning the Human God Realm.The white cat also came along.It was also very curious. What obstacles were there in the Human God Realm?Upon arriving, Lin Jiufeng swaggered into the heavily guarded library. No one discovered him.A few years ago on his last visit to the royal library, no one noticed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s visit.It was even more impossible for someone to notice him by now.The library was huge and there were records from different periods and epochs.Lin Jiufeng had previously investigated the demonic sects.This time, he looked for the records related to Daoist schools.In terms of research on the Divine Soul, Daoist schools were superior. As a result, Lin Jiufeng naturally wanted to use their literature as his reference.A line of words appeared in front of Lin Jiufeng when he stepped into the area where records related to Daoist schools were being kept and preserved.[Do you want to Sign-in before the Daoist Library?]\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng agreed.[Sign-In successful. Received the Innate Soul Refining Technique!]Waves of memories entered Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sea of consciousness.He was used to it by now, so he could maintain his calm.A peculiar book appeared.The obscurity of the words contained within would probably cause the minds of ordinary people to spin in confusion. But the waves of memories that Lin Jiufeng had just received gave him enough knowledge\u2014he had no problems in understanding the material he was holding.\u201cThis is a cultivation technique that cultivates the soul. It suits me perfectly.\u201dLin Jiufeng nodded in satisfaction.Meow!The white cat appeared beside Lin Jiufeng. It called out softly.It couldn\u2019t understand why Lin Jiufeng was in a daze.Lin Jiufeng woke up from his trance, but he didn\u2019t say anything.He smiled gently at the white cat before proceeding inside the area for literature related to Daoist schools.The place was packed with Daoism-related books.After 400 years, every Daoist book out there might not be in the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s royal library, however, most of them could be found here.The remaining 10 to 20 percent of precious Daoist books and scriptures were kept hidden by the Daoist sects. The Yuhua God Dynasty couldn\u2019t possibly obtain them.However, this was enough for Lin Jiufeng to see.He set aside the Innate Soul Refining Technique and focused on reading the Daoist books.The books recorded many things about the Human God Realm.There were also things that the white cat had said\u2014such as Serene, Immortal Treasury, Ultimate Man, and so on.Lin Jiufeng finally understood.The term \u2018Human God\u2019 was a general name, just like \u2018Martial Sage\u2019.The Martial Sage Realm was divided into Profound Insight, Life Knowing, Fish Leap, and Great Sage.The Human God Realm was divided into Serene, Immortal Treasury, Ultimate, and Nirvana.Lin Jiufeng was now at the Serene Stage. It was no longer a step, but a stage.Serene was an adjective.It was like a secret chamber, pitch-black like ink, extremely quiet.A Human God had given birth to the Divine Soul that remained locked in this secret chamber, unable to break free.The Divine Soul existed all alone in this dark place.To make a breakthrough into the next stage of the Human God Realm\u2014one must allow their Divine Soul to escape from this secret chamber so that it could see the world.The white cat was also reading the records.It suddenly started to have hopes for its own future.Perhaps if it cultivated seriously, would it also be able to make its own breakthrough?If it worked harder and managed to surpass Lin Jiufeng, how satisfying would it be?At the thought of this, the white cat\u2019s eyes curved into a smile. It looked very cute.Lin Jiufeng turned around and looked at the expression on the white cat\u2019s face.His face was completely devoid of emotions.When the white cat opened its eyes and saw Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expressionless face, it immediately restrained itself and hurriedly wrote. \u201cContinue reading.\u201dShaking his head, Lin Jiufeng replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re so happy about every day.\u201d\u201cCould it be that a silly cat also has its silly fortune?\u201d Lin Jiufeng muttered in confusion.The white cat was angered.Even its claws came out as it raised its paw and gestured at Lin Jiufeng\u2019s face.However, it was still worried that its claws wouldn\u2019t be able to cut through Lin Jiufeng\u2019s skin. In addition, it would be even more embarrassing if it ended up getting injured even though it was the one who attacked.As a result, it retracted its claws.After reading every Daoist book in this area of the royal library, Lin Jiufeng learned a lot about the Human God Realm.\u201cWe cultivators still have a long way to go.\u201dLin Jiufeng sighed with emotion before turning around and leaving the royal library.After returning to the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng laid on the frost jade bed and pondered silently.Although the frost jade bed was of no help to him anymore, Lin Jiufeng still preferred to lie on it.Because it was cool and comfortable.It was for pure comfort and enjoyment.Even the white cat was enamored with it after it had accidentally discovered its magical effect.Now, when it had nothing to do, it would come up to rest on it too. Curling up into a ball, it became a tiny little fellow that didn\u2019t occupy a lot of space.Facing the same direction as Lin Jiufeng, it even slept together with him.This time, it also curled up on the bed and looked at Lin Jiufeng.Then, it closed its eyes and worked hard in its cultivation so that it could suppress Lin Jiufeng under its claws as soon as possible.\u201cLet\u2019s try using this Innate Soul Refining Technique.\u201dSoon enough, Lin Jiufeng also closed his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Breaking Through from Watching the RainInnate Soul Refining Technique.This was a technique to cultivate the Divine Soul, strengthening it to the extent that it could transform into a human form before eventually becoming an avatar of its owner.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul currently an enormous consciousness that had yet to take form.But this technique would help him consolidate his Divine Soul for it to form.After using the Innate Soul Refining Technique, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s consciousness started to shrink as it slowly turned into a ball.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul in human form was gestating inside this ball.Once it was sufficiently mature, the Divine Soul would then be able to come out of the ball in its human form.By that time, Lin Jiufeng would be able to break through to the next stage.When cultivating this technique, the most important prerequisite was silence.Extreme silence.And the Cold Palace truly satisfied this condition.The birth of a Human God caused peace in the world and increased the power and prestige of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Especially when the abbot of Shaolin Temple and the Xuankong Temple knelt down to receive the imperial decree. This brought Lin Tianyuan immense might and everyone couldn\u2019t help but tremble at the thought of that imperial decree.Although this was because he had borrowed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s power, as long as Lin Tianyuan handled the situation well, the Yuhua God Dynasty would surely prosper.\u2026Three years slowly passed.In the past three years, Lin Jiufeng had never left the Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng even instructed Dachun not to any send food and drinks for these few years.He wanted to enter seclusion.Dachun could only agree.Therefore, in these three years, the doors of the Cold Palace were tightly shut.The Cold Palace remained peaceful, but a storm was brewing outside.There were even more Martial Sages right now than Great Grandmasters back then.The influence of that rain gradually spread throughout the world. As time passed, the spirit energy in the world increased and every cultivator\u2019s breakthrough had become relatively easier to accomplish.Lin Tianyuan made use of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s influence to recruit a bunch of Martial Sages.At the same time, he was also grooming Martial Sages himself.The results weren\u2019t bad.He found a bunch of young talents and used the resources of the Empire to nurture them.Even without Lin Jiufeng\u2019s backing, Lin Tianyuan had fully displayed his capabilities as he increased the might of the Yuhua God Dynasty.There were now hundreds of Martial Sages in the Yuhua God Dynasty. Even if these Martial Sages had different thoughts and plans in their heads, this force was still the most powerful force in the world at this moment.Not to mention the fact that there was a Human God above them.Although Lin Jiufeng said that he wouldn\u2019t help anymore, no one knew anything about the conversation between the two back then.Over the past three years, Lin Tianyuan had become more and more domineering.In addition, he had also gotten rid of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s influence on him.The current Lin Tianyuan was the ruler of the world, both in mentality and reality. On top of the foundation that Emperor Yuan had set for him, he had walked onto an Emperor path of his own.He was the ruler of the world.His words were absolute. No one could refute him.It was also in this year that Lin Tianyuan started to choose his concubines. After working hard for more than ten years, he finally completed the reform of the Yuhua God Dynasty.The world was flourishing and the people were living in peace.He felt that he had completed his father\u2019s final wish.Therefore, he wanted to choose a concubine.When awake, he was the ruler of the world.When drunk, he would rest on the lap of a beauty.He had already completed the former.Now he wanted to accomplish the latter.Momentarily, all the beauties in the world entered the imperial capital. Hundreds of flowers fought to display their beauty, like the stars glowing in the dark.Also this year, a woman called Mei Niang was chosen to enter the imperial harem.\u2026Three years had passed and Lin Jiufeng had always been nurturing his Divine Soul this whole time.The Divine Soul inside the ball of consciousness already had a human form.It was extremely powerful.But his Divine Soul still needed a catalyst\u2014an opportunity so that it could finally leave the ball and go outside Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body to move as freely as the birds in the skies.Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t in a hurry. He waited patiently for that opportunity.He witnessed all the major events that happened in the Imperial Capital throughout the years.Even without Dachun\u2019s report, Lin Jiufeng could still see everything with his Divine Soul.It was just that he was too lazy to look and take on what was happening outside into his mind.Only the commotion caused by Lin Tianyuan choosing his concubines truly made a mark on his brain.In regards to this, Lin Jiufeng only frowned.He somewhat felt that this wasn\u2019t appropriate.It has only been a few years since the reforms were completed and put into practice. The common populace still hadn\u2019t even adjusted to these changes yet. But Lin Tianyuan was already starting to choose his concubines in order to indulge himself.Wasn\u2019t he already married? His wife had also become the Empress.But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t reprimand him.Over the ten-plus years since he ascended to the throne, Lin Tianyuan had been rather hard at work. He learned from Emperor Yuan\u2019s example and worked hard to complete the reforms.In the middle of it, he relied on Lin Jiufeng to eliminate every obstacle on his way.For the latter stages, he settled the remaining problems by himself.Now, he wanted to choose a concubine to relax after working so hard after all these years.What excuse did Lin Jiufeng have to stop him?\u201cNot everyone is like Yuan Emperor.\u201d Lin Jiufeng lamented under the moonlight.That younger brother of his had really been working hard over the ten-plus years of his reign.He truly had never enjoyed himself even for a moment.Lin Tianyuan couldn\u2019t do the same.But what reason did Lin Jiufeng have to reprimand him?Therefore, Lin Jiufeng stopped paying attention to the outside world as he continued to focus on accumulating his strength.The moon looked gloomy tonight.It was dim.One could vaguely see the formation of dark clouds up above the skies.The white cat walked over with light footsteps.Looking at the sky, it wrote, \u201cA heavy rain seems to be pouring over tonight.\u201dAfter three years, it had become much stronger.Just that it still couldn\u2019t speak.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t try to probe its body to find out as to why the white cat was unable to speak.It was because the last time he did so\u2014the white cat became furious.The exasperated white cat back then chased after him, incessantly trying to scratch him.For three whole months, the white cat ignored him.Lin Jiufeng stopped probing into the white cat\u2019s body since then.\u201cYes, there will be rain and also lightning tonight.\u201d Lin Jiufeng nodded.Shuash!As soon as he finished speaking, the rain started falling.It landed on the ground and created a splash, drenching Lin Jiufeng and the white cat.A human and a cat looked at each other.In unison, the two of them retreated to the eaves of the courtyard.The two of them didn\u2019t speak as they enjoyed the rain that was becoming heavier and heavier as it washed and cleansed the world.A handsome young man and a white kitten observed the rain under the eaves.No unnecessary words were exchanged.Boom!Suddenly, thunder rumbled.Then, a bolt of lightning struck down.Crack!Lightning lit up the dark night.It also illuminated Lin Jiufeng.He suddenly had a flash of inspiration.The ball in his mind seemed to have been struck by lightning too.The human-shaped Divine Soul broke through the ball and appeared behind Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat stood side by side.The moon was completely covered by dark clouds.Only when lightning struck down occasionally could one see some light.The shadow of the white cat and Lin Jiufeng lengthened.However, another Lin Jiufeng was illuminated behind Lin Jiufeng when the lightning flashed.His Divine Soul had left his body!At this moment, Lin Jiufeng watched the rain and broke through.He broke through the Serene stage, entering the next stage.Immortal Treasury!\u2026Great Yan Dynasty, Temple of the Holy Maiden.It was raining heavily outside, and the moonlight was obscured by the dark clouds.There was also lightning and thunder.The Holy Maiden who had endured for decades was silently watching the rain.Her aura slowly rose\u2026A golden light flashed through her eyes.The sight of this was terrifying, however, no one witnessed such a scene.\u201cI\u2019ve been in this world for decades. My body was injured and I have always been in the process of recovery since then. Only now have I fully recovered from my injuries.\u201d\u201cToday, I shall watch the rain and breakthrough.\u201d\u201cAdvance to the Human God Realm!\u201dThe Holy Maiden aura was aggressive and her eyes flickered with golden flames.She raised her slender neck and her beautiful face was filled with pride.Her aura wasn\u2019t concealed at all.Crack!A bolt of lightning cut through the darkness.Heavy rain poured down.The Holy Maiden\u2019s aura was undisguised as it soared into the clouds and broke through to the next realm.Human God Realm!She flashed a faint smile.Finally, she was now a Human God.But in the very next moment, the Holy Maiden\u2019s expression changed.Her Divine Soul trembled. She spat out a mouthful of blood.\u201cMy Divine Soul is actually incomplete?\u201d the Holy Maiden exclaimed in astonishment.Her eyes were filled with disbelief.How could her Divine Soul be incomplete?She had been living in seclusion all these years. She did not owe anyone anything\u2026 right?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: The Enjoying Emperor MingOn this rainy night, beneath the lightning and thunder, the Holy Maiden looked lost.Why was her Divine Soul incomplete?\u201cI have to think about this properly\u2026\u201dThe Holy Maiden began to think about her entire life so far in this world.She had to make up for this flaw to advance fearlessly.\u2026The Yuhua God Dynasty, Imperial Capital, Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng had broken through to the next stage by watching the rain. His Divine Soul finally had a human form as he officially entered the Immortal Treasury stage of the Human God Realm.\u201cThe goal of the Immortal Treasury stage is to open the treasures of the human body and unlock its ultimate secrets layer by layer to further widen the difference in strength between the stages and the realms.\u201d Lin Jiufeng recalled the secret manual he had seen in the royal library.He needed to slowly unlock the secrets contained within his body for its infinite treasures.The Immortal Treasury stage was an unfamiliar realm to Lin Jiufeng.Thus, the stage of trying to get used to his increase in power began.He didn\u2019t pay much attention to the outside world.On the other hand, Dachun\u2019s food delivery resumed.The time period for food delivery changed from once every seven days to once a month.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t need to consume food and drinks so frequently after all.To be honest, food had already become some form of a stimulant in life for him. It allowed him to satisfy his appetite once a month.Recently, the white cat realized that Lin Jiufeng had made yet another breakthrough.It was extremely discouraged as Lin Jiufeng\u2019s breakthrough speed was just too fast.It couldn\u2019t catch up to him no matter how hard it tried.It became very dejected.However, Lin Jiufeng could recently feel the strange eyes of the white cat as it looked at him from a distance. The weird and peculiar gaze made Lin Jiufeng feel uneasy towards it.As a result, he didn\u2019t go and purposely provoke it into action.\u2026Time passed by in the Yuhua God Dynasty.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s management of the Empire has been remarkable. There was now an abundance of Martial Sages in the Yuhua God Dynasty. In short, there were powerful Martial Sages in both the army and in the Imperial Court.These Martial Sages followed Lin Tianyuan\u2019s command.As a result, he became even more arrogant.His policy had to be implemented.Even if the cabinet ministers said it was wrong, he insisted on it.Lin Tianyuan believed that he wouldn\u2019t make any mistakes\u2014that his policy was good for the citizens.If the citizens objected or didn\u2019t like his policies, it must be because the officials below didn\u2019t carry out his orders thoroughly.On top of that, after that time when he chose some concubines, countless beauties entered the palace.Every day, he would be with one or several of them at once.Lin Tianyuan had become incredibly busy.During this time, his favorite concubine was a woman called Mei Niang.He was now resting in Mei Niang\u2019s palace every night.He wouldn\u2019t go to the Empress nor to the side of the other concubines.The Yuhua God Dynasty was quietly going through a few changes.Of course, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t know about the situation as he was cultivating quietly in the Cold Palace.Silently breaking through.Few if not, no people would choose to come to the Cold Palace. There was only him and the white cat behind its sturdy doors. Occasionally, they would bicker, while sometimes, they would cultivate separately and away from each other.While the other was cultivating, none of them would disturb the other.Time continued to pass like this until Dachun came to deliver food once again.Once a month, Dachun would always arrive punctually, never slacking off.Dachun\u2019s food delivery only happened once a month\u2014he always arrived on time.He also had never once slacked.He was now a commander of the imperial guards.He held a lofty position for he was in charge of guarding the Forbidden City, arresting traitors against the crown, and a personal lackey of the Emperor.But he was still extremely respectful toward Lin Jiufeng.As usual, he told Lin Jiufeng about what had recently happened in the Imperial Capital.Three years ago, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t let him deliver food.It was only until recently did he start to deliver food to him once again.On this day, Dachun came as usual for his monthly food delivery service and also as a bringer of news.\u201cYour Royal Highness, how have you been these three years?\u201d Dachun asked cordially.Behind the doors of the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng smiled and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, what about you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not bad either. My cultivation level has increased and my second child has also been born. My official position has also been raised to one of the commanders of the imperial guards. I can be considered to be a lofty general now. It\u2019s all thanks to Your Royal Highness,\u201d Dachun said gratefully.\u201cThis is your own effort, you don\u2019t have to thank me.\u201d Lin Jiufeng shook his head.He chatted with Dachun over casual things.Dachun was extremely excited when he talked about his recent changes as he told Lin Jiufeng about his gains in the past three years.Taking concubines and having children, getting promoted and gaining wealth, breaking through in cultivation\u2026He had encountered all these things.They were all good things.Over the years, these happened one after another.Dachun didn\u2019t have a strong cultivation base and had yet to achieve the Martial Sage realm.He was only able to become a commander of the imperial guards because of Lin Tianyuan\u2019s grooming. After all, he was the only person who had interacted with Lin Jiufeng.This was a way of showing respect to Lin Jiufeng by proxy.Hence, Dachun became the commander-in-chief of the imperial guards.Although there were also other people in this position, Dachun was still very happy.He didn\u2019t have much ambition. His cultivation base was that of a Great Grandmaster and on a daily basis\u2014he was in charge of the logistics within the imperial guards.Albeit, this was also his own choice despite his lofty position.\u201cYour Royal Highness, do you know? In the Capital, news of abolishing the current Empress has been spreading like wildfire,\u201d Da Chun said softly.\u201cAbolishing the current Empress?\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised her brows and stopped drinking. He couldn\u2019t help but ask in surprise.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cHis Majesty is going to abolish the dignified and virtuous empress and turn a concubine into the Empress,\u201d Da Chun explained.\u201cWhy?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked with a frown.Lin Tianyuan met the current Empress when they were young, they eventually decided to marry and had been supporting each other for almost 20 years since then.Their marriage bore fruit to a daughter and son. The two of them were the current Eldest Princess and the Crown Prince of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201cI heard that he despises the Empress for being immoral and being jealous of others,\u201d Da Chun said in a low voice.He was also indignant about this issue.Although he worshipped Lin Tianyuan for managing the Yuhua God Dynasty well all these years.He was still very unhappy about his handling of this matter.Was abolishing the Empress for the sake of a concubine something a wise ruler would do?\u201cHas he gone crazy?\u201d Lin Jiufeng was confused.How did the obedient Lin Tianyuan become like this?\u201cYour Royal Highness. The entire imperial court has been in a heated argument over this matter. His Majesty hasn\u2019t issued a decree for the time being. It\u2019s just that he no longer goes to the Empress\u2019s palace anymore and is focused on pampering a single concubine.\u201dDa Chun sighed as he explained.He was sighing for the Empress.The Empress was a very virtuous woman. She had been in charge of the imperial harem for more than ten-plus years and she had managed it well.But now, she was actually being despised by Emperor Ming.\u201cWho\u2019s the concubine that he\u2019s favoring?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked with a frown.\u201cIt\u2019s Consort Ming, her name is Mei Niang. She\u2019s extremely beautiful and has bewitched His Majesty. Several concubines in the harem have been given the white silk[1] because they were jealous of Consort Ming,\u201d Da Chun said in a low voice.\u201cWhat foolish actions!\u201d Lin Jiufeng snorted coldly.\u201cDid Emperor Ming make any mistake in the national affairs?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cNo.\u201d Da Chun shook her head.\u201cThat\u2019s still fine then. Let him argue with the civil and military officials about the imperial harem. I believe the civil and military officials won\u2019t let him abolish the Empress,\u201d said Lin Jiufeng.\u201cYour Highness is right. The cabinet ministers are unanimously opposed to this matter. Right now, the court is strongly against this. If there\u2019s any other progress, I\u2019ll report it to you again,\u201d Da Chun nodded and said.Lin Jiufeng finished a pot of wine and let Dachun take it away.He shook his head in the Cold Palace and said regretfully, \u201cPerhaps Emperor Yuan was the aberrant.\u201dEmperor Yuan worked nonstop for ten-plus years and he had never truly enjoyed the benefits of being in power. All he felt was the pressure of obtaining more power for the betterment of the world.He worked diligently until death, unwilling to seek his own enjoyment.However, Lin Tianyuan evidently couldn\u2019t do the same.It has been almost two decades since he succeeded to the throne. He had done well in the first ten-plus years, implementing various reforms and even eliminating the buddhist sects.But when these were done and completed, Lin Tianyuan felt that it was time for him to reap the fruits of his labor. Looking at the calm and peaceful world, he suddenly lost the motivation to move forward.He stopped in his tracks and focused on enjoying himself.Wine, beauties, and power slowly corroded his heart.He held great power and became arrogant because of it.He couldn\u2019t take in advice from those loyal to him anymore.\u201cIn history, monarchs like Lin Tianyuan are the norm\u2026\u201d\u201cThere has only been one Emperor Yuan in history.\u201d Lin Jiufeng sighed.This was why he said that Emperor Yuan was an aberrant.[1] Granted the death penalty. The white silk is for them to hang themselves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Forced RetirementEmperor Ming\u2019s change disappointed Lin Jiufeng.But thinking about it carefully, there had been signs of this change long ago.But no matter what, choosing a concubine or wanting to abolish the empress were Lin Tianyuan\u2019s own family matters.Lin Jiufeng did not need to participate in this as there were court officials to stop Lin Tianyuan from abolishing the empress.At least in state affairs, he didn\u2019t make any mistakes.The Yuhua God Dynasty was still improving by the day.Lin Jiufeng stayed in the Cold Palace peacefully as he proceeded to ignore Lin Tianyuan\u2019s actions.He had clearly said before that Lin Tianyuan would walk his own path in the future.If he walked wrongly, that was the misfortune of the Yuhua God Dynasty.At the crucial moment, Lin Jiufeng would save them.But the Yuhua God Dynasty was still doing well.These problems were only the result of Lin Tianyuan\u2019s lust.Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t be bothered with him.The more important matter for him right now was still improving his cultivation base.In the Cold Palace, he slowly grasped the meaning of the Immortal Treasury stage in the Human God realm.\u2026In the Forbidden City\u2014Mei Niang\u2014who had recently caused controversy was trying her best to please Lin Tianyuan.She was beautiful and full of youthful charm.She looked very pure and her smile was adorable.She didn\u2019t look seductive.The path that she took was a different one.A man\u2019s first love!Although there was a \u2018Mei'[1] in her name and she was also addressed as Mei Niang, she had a face that no man could reject.The first girl a man would fall in love with when he was young was someone like her.It was also because of this appearance that she was able to establish herself in the palace. She was favored by the Emperor and her status continued to rise.Now, she was already a threat to the Empress.\u201cYour Majesty. The court and public are currently in an uproar. They describe me as a vixen who seduced you, Your Majesty. If you insist on abolishing the Empress, then I really won\u2019t be able to survive in such an environment.\u201dMei Niang poured wine for Lin Tianyuan as she lamented.She took the initiative to speak up for the Empress, expressing that she didn\u2019t want the Empress to be abolished.But these words didn\u2019t sound right.\u201cWhen I married the Empress back then, it was because she was designated by Father to me. I have never liked her. All these years, she gave birth to two children for me. I am also grateful to her for that and therefore I granted her the title of Empress,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said with an unhappy expression.\u201cBut instead of managing the imperial harem properly and holding up the rear for me, she actually became jealous and poisoned you, my beloved concubine. How can this vicious woman become the mother of the God Dynasty?\u201d Lin Tianyuan said angrily.Not long ago, a eunuch by the Empress\u2019s side secretly poisoned Consort Ming, which was Mei Niang.If Lin Tianyuan didn\u2019t visit her to spend that night with her together, he would\u2019ve been too late to save her from death as she fell unconscious after drinking the poisoned beverage. If Mei Niang truly died, then Lin Tianyuan\u2019s rage would\u2019ve been uncontrollable.As the Emperor, he inherited the wishes of his predecessors\u2014to reform the world and change it for the better.With one order from him, countless people would lose their lives.But the woman he loved the most almost died because of jealousy.This made Lin Tianyuan furious.\u201cYour Majesty, I am already lucky to be alive. What happened in the past is insignificant. Besides, the Empress also said that someone had framed her to get rid of us both. The aim is to harm both of us so that no one will emerge victorious between us.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, please don\u2019t be angry\u2026\u201d\u201cI still believe in the Empress\u2019s character,\u201d Mei Niang said weakly.She was just a teenage girl who didn\u2019t have much cultivation base.She was so fragile and weak.Thus, she was very capable of arousing a man\u2019s desire to protect her.\u201cHer character?\u201d Lin Tianyuan laughed in disdain.He pointed with his finger and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been married to her for 20 years. I thought that she was a woman who knew the big picture and knew when to advance and when to retreat\u2026\u201d\u201cBut who would have thought that she would do such a thing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t even dare to say that I believe in her character. There\u2019s no need for you to explain for her.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, don\u2019t be angry. I won\u2019t say anymore.\u201d Mei Niang hurriedly used her soft and boneless-like hand to stroke Lin Tianyuan\u2019s heart as she said with concern.\u201cMy beloved concubine, don\u2019t worry. I will definitely give you the best. I was even able to complete such a huge reform throughout the dynasty. I just want to promote the concubine that I like to become the Empress, yet I am being called a foolish ruler by those people\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is simply preposterous!\u201d Lin Tianyuan said with a cold expression.He was very angry.Not only was he angry at the Empress, but he was also angry at the group of court officials and the group of rotten scholars in the imperial court.All they knew was to tell him to follow some etiquette and honor\u2014that he shouldn\u2019t abolish the Empress.\u201cAbolishing the Empress is my wish, no one can stop me.\u201d\u201cMen! Go to the Empress\u2019s palace and tell her that from today onwards, she will be stripped of her title as the Empress and will be demoted to being an Imperial Concubine.\u201d\u201cShe shall pray to Buddha every day and reflect on herself to not be jealous of others all day,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said coldly.He showed no mercy to the Empress at all.\u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d Mei Niang looked at Lin Tianyuan in surprise. She blinked her large eyes and a blush appeared on her youthful face. She looked especially charming.This Consort Ming\u2019s casual actions all carried a sense of seduction. But looking at her face, it was innocent and radiant. All those that saw her face would feel that she was a very kind person.\u201cMy beloved concubine, wait a few months more, I will make you the Empress. Let\u2019s stay together forever. I was too busy for the past 20 years. But now that the God Dynasty is stable and powerful, I can finally enjoy my life.\u201d Lin Tianyuan looked lovingly at Mei Niang.\u201cI will accompany Your Majesty forever.\u201dMei Niang was moved to tears as she threw herself into Lin Tianyuan\u2019s arms.\u2026The abolishing of the Empress became a reality.The Empress that was praised by the court as virtuous was abolished and was demoted to an Imperial Concubine. She was ordered to reflect on her actions.That night, every court official gathered in the Great Council Hall to persuade His Majesty to retract his order.The Empress must not be abolished.Her disappearance would cause chaos within the imperial harem.If the imperial harem was in chaos, the God Dynasty would also be affected.All sorts of theories about this decision emerged endlessly among the officials.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s face turned cold as he listened\u2014his patience was slowly running out.\u201cYour Majesty, the root of the problem is that witch, Mei Niang!\u201d\u201cEver since she entered the palace, the imperial harem became wracked with internal strife\u2026\u201d\u201cThis woman is a walking disaster. She is here to harm the Yuhua God Dynasty!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, please punish this woman to death!\u201dThe Cabinet Chief, who was also Emperor Yuan\u2019s teacher and had been serving three generations of Emperors, knelt down at this moment and shouted loudly.Lin Tianyuan looked coldly at the Cabinet Chief.\u201cIs Old Sir teaching me how to do things?\u201d Lin Tianyuan gritted his teeth and said angrily.\u201cYour Majesty, please consider! This is for the sake of the country and for the peace of the imperial harem.\u201d The Cabinet Chief bitterly persuaded.Lin Tianyuan would listen to his advice in the past.Because at that time, Lin Tianyuan was still a humble emperor.He wanted to achieve results.But the current Lin Tianyuan already felt that he had contributed greatly, even more than the founding emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty.He couldn\u2019t take such advice from him anymore. Especially when he had already heard about it for more than ten years and was already tired of it.\u201cOld Sir is already old, you don\u2019t have to kneel here anymore. I will allow you to return to your hometown and live the rest of your life in comfort,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said coldly.The court officials were dumbfounded upon hearing this.For the sake of a concubine, Lin Tianyuan forcefully retired the Cabinet Chief who had sacrificed his entire life for the God Dynasty?The body of the Cabinet Chief also trembled.Sorrow gushed out of his heart. He couldn\u2019t help but speak up, \u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s not a problem for me to return to my hometown, but I ask Your Majesty to consider the stability of the state and the imperial harem! Bestow death upon Mei Niang!\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, please consider the stability of the state and the imperial harem! Bestow death upon Mei Niang!\u201dYour Majesty, please consider the stability of the state and the imperial harem! Bestow death upon Mei Niang!\u201dYour Majesty, please consider the stability of the state and the imperial harem! Bestow death upon Mei Niang!\u201dThe court officials all knelt down and shouted loudly outside the Great Council Hall.\u201cAll of you are rebelling\u2026\u201d\u201cAm I the Emperor, or are you all the Emperors?\u201d Lin Tianyuan was enraged.\u201cAll of you, return to your hometowns. The reforms have been completed. The God Dynasty will remember your contributions, but you lot have obviously never adapted to the new era.\u201dIn his fury, Lin Tianyuan disbanded all the court officials left behind by his father, Emperor Yuan.He dealt upon them their forceful retirement.[1] Means seductive.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: The Love Lin Tianyuan SaidJust as the reforms of the Yuhua God Dynasty proved to be successful as its people spent their days in peace and contentment, chaos suddenly broke out within the confines of the Imperial Court.Emperor Ming\u2014Lin Tianyuan abolished the Empress and doted on Concubine Ming, Mei Niang.He wanted to make her the Empress and caused an earthquake in the Imperial Court and the public in the process.More than ten court officials that followed Emperor Yuan from the beginning of the reforms until now. The court officials of two generations in the Yuhua God Dynasty.Some were even old officials from three generations back.Their prestige ran deep and they had a significant influence on the Yuhua God Dynasty.But now, they were dealt upon them their forceful retirements and were asked to return to their hometowns and leave the Cabinet.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s actions shocked the world.The court officials and the commoners were all discussing what Emperor Ming was trying to achieve by doing this.For the sake of a beautiful woman, did he not want the Imperial Court anymore?Without these court officials, who would manage the world for him?Without these cabinet ministers, who would help him continue to reap the fruits of the reforms for him?Emperor Ming wasn\u2019t that old yet. He ascended to the throne at 15 years old.After more than 10 years, he was only about 30 years old.He could be considered to be at the prime of his life.How could he be so muddled?After a few days\u2026Emperor Ming also knew what the people of the world were saying about him.But he was very confident. He had hundreds of Martial Sages under his command. He could even threaten others using Lin Jiufeng\u2019s influence. Even without his court officials, the Yuhua God Dynasty wouldn\u2019t suffer much loss.\u201cA group of corrupt scholars. Not only did they refute my views on court affairs, but they even dared to make me kill my beloved concubine. This is simply preposterous!\u201dEmperor Ming was enraged. If these corrupt scholars hadn\u2019t asked him to kill his beloved concubine, he wouldn\u2019t have given such an order.Sitting upright in the Great Council Hall, darkness and coldness enveloped him.Emperor Ming\u2019s expression was cold as he tried his best to endure his anger.He also didn\u2019t want to get rid of the court officials all at once.That would leave him with a bad reputation of killing those who had been useful to him.But those people had crossed his bottom line\u2014it was unbearable for Lin Tianyuan.\u201cI was called a bastard child before I was five years old. I had no father and was beaten out of the house by Grandpa. My mother was also severely humiliated.\u201d\u201cThen, Father found us and brought us to the Imperial Capital. But at that time, he was already the Crown Prince and he couldn\u2019t let me enter the royal family\u2019s genealogy. I was still a bastard child in the end.\u201d\u201cThen, Father handed me to Uncle. Uncle is mysterious and unfathomable. He taught me cultivation and literature, allowing me to become accomplished. But with Uncle, I didn\u2019t receive any love at all!\u201dThere was hatred in Emperor Ming\u2019s eyes.When he was young, he wanted his mother\u2019s love.But his mother was very strict with him.She wanted him to work hard and become talented. She never once spoiled him.Not a word of praise, not even a warm embrace.Within his memory of his mother, what he could remember were harsh reprimands, cold greetings, and a constant set of goals for him to achieve.When he was young, he didn\u2019t get to enjoy his father\u2019s love either.At that time, Emperor Yuan was too busy.He didn\u2019t even get to see Emperor Yuan even once a year.Lin Tianyuan yearned for care and love to warm him up.Lastly, there\u2019s Lin Jiufeng. His attitude towards him was to let him grow freely.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s request for him was to ask him to work hard and only talk to the former if he had any questions.The lack of love in his youth made Lin Tianyuan\u2019s character incomplete.His wife was chosen by Emperor Yuan.Lin Tianyuan didn\u2019t love her at all, but he didn\u2019t dare to disobey his father.Because that was the first time his father showed him concern and helped him solve his lifelong problem.He couldn\u2019t afford to refuse.He had a son and a daughter with the Empress, but they were always respectful to each other.It was even difficult for them to befriend each other, let alone love.After ascending to the throne, he had been working hard on reforms for the past ten years, not daring to slack off for even a moment.He had already forgotten how to be doted on.He also forgot how to love others.Until now, when the world was finally stable and the reforms were successful. With his skyrocketing reputation, Lin Tianyuan became arrogant.He believed that he had already solved his father\u2019s final wish, so he now had to think for himself.Thus, he began to choose his concubines.One of them was Mei Niang.The first time he saw Lady Mei, Lin Tianyuan\u2019s heart was instantly moved.The feeling of seeing 10,000 years with a single glance.His heart pounded.Then, after interacting with Mei Niang\u2014Lin Tianyuan confirmed that she was the person he wanted to choose.He wanted to spend the rest of his life with her.For this reason, he abolished the Empress and dismissed the cabinet ministers, firmly implementing his own ideas.\u201cThis is love!\u201d The 30-year-old Lin Tianyuan believed in his current feelings.He found love. He felt meticulous care from Mei Niang.He wanted to give Mei Niang the most precious thing in the world for women.The throne of the Empress!\u2026In the Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat looked towards the palace.They heard Lin Tianyuan\u2019s whispers all the way from the Great Council Hall.The human and cat had different expressions on their faces.The white cat looked forward to love\u2026But Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression was extremely ugly.How could he not know about the storm that had happened in the Imperial Capital in the past few days?There was a lot of commotion.Everyone was talking about it.This was the first time Emperor Ming had a disagreement with the court officials.But the most shocking of them all was his forcer retirement of those loyal officials.Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but pay attention to it.The reforms had just started.It was a good start.But if this momentum wasn\u2019t maintained, then this early success would become akin to a mirage, quick to appear and vanish.But the current Lin Tianyuan no longer wanted to go deeper into the reforms.He wanted love.For the sake of love, he drove away all the court officials.This decision of his made Lin Jiufeng furious.\u201cLove your head!\u201d Lin Jiufeng gritted his teeth.He looked at the current Lin Tianyuan, feeling the urge to beat him up.The white cat turned its head to look at Lin Jiufeng, whose face had turned ugly.It wrote and asked, \u201cAre you very angry?\u201dWith a cold face, Lin Jiufeng nodded and said, \u201cThis woman called Consort Ming is very capable. She managed to charm that fool, Lin Tianyuan, to such an extent. She definitely isn\u2019t an ordinary woman.\u201dLin Jiufeng originally didn\u2019t plan to get involved in this.But now, he had to take a look.It was impossible to hope for Lin Tianyuan to reflect on his own actions.He was currently immersed in the sea of love.He was so happy that he couldn\u2019t listen to any bad words.He was unable to wake up by himself.\u201cThe key person is still that Mei Niang!\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes turned slightly cold.If this woman\u2019s background was normal and no one was backing her to do such a thing.Then, it would be for the best.But if Lin Jiufeng was to find out that someone was plotting behind the scenes, they would be met with his thunderous fury.\u201cThe situation concerning the reforms has just recently stabilized. If you dare to play tricks behind the scenes, I will turn you, and the people behind you into ashes!\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression was cold.\u201cAre you going to the Forbidden City?\u201d The white cat wrote.\u201cI\u2019m already going there,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said softly.His Divine Soul that had just broken free from the dark chamber of his consciousness was already on its way to the Forbidden City.To find out if there was anyone plotting behind this matter.If there was no one, then that simply meant that Lin Tianyuan was a fool.Lin Jiufeng wouldn\u2019t let him destroy the results of the reforms.The white cat looked at the Forbidden City in curiosity.Its claws moved. \u201cDo you think there\u2019s a mastermind behind the Forbidden City?\u201dLin Jiufeng stood with his hands behind his back.His expression was cold and he didn\u2019t speak.He would only find out after investigating it.As for the love that Lin Tianyuan talked about\u2014about love at first sight, heart pounding, and so on?Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t believe it.Love at first sight was just lust!As for the so-called love through long-term interaction was simply weighing the pros and cons!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Love Is DeadTonight, the moon was round and bright, illuminating the land and the Forbidden City.In the imperial harem, the former Empress\u2019s Palace was magnificent and spacious.It belonged to Mei Niang now.After dispersing the maids and eunuchs, she sat alone in the Empress\u2019s Palace.She wore a placid look on her face as she calmly looked at the mirror.Reflected in the mirror was a beautiful face.It was the face of a man\u2019s first love.It was the face that captured Lin Tianyuan and made him fall in love at first sight.It was also the face that made his heart pound like mad.This was probably the face that countless women desired.But in the very next moment, she reached out and peeled off this face.She tore off this so-called \u2018face of a man\u2019s first love\u2019 like she was ripping off a piece of unwanted skin.Hiding behind this face was a mountain spirit with a face full of white hair.It looked weird and ugly.\u201cHuff, I\u2019ve had enough of this human-faced mask. I have to wear it every day, it suffocates my pores. It\u2019s very uncomfortable to wear.\u201d Mei Niang complained in a low voice.After she tore off that face, she proceeded to take off her fair skin as if she was removing her clothes.A mountain spirit\u2014 a dark and thin mountain spirit was revealed underneath.\u201cHis Majesty had already told me that he won\u2019t be coming over today. I can finally relax for a bit.\u201d She breathed freely, enjoying the freedom that was hard to come by.What she didn\u2019t know was that there was actually someone else standing in the same room.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul!This mountain spirit couldn\u2019t possibly notice him.\u201cAs expected, Lin Tianyuan was set up by someone.\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes were cold.He didn\u2019t act rashly. Instead, he left the Empress\u2019s place and went to the Great Council Hall.At this moment, Lin Tianyuan was still lamenting in the Great Council Hall that his love had arrived too late.It only came when he was already 30 years old.He wanted to start a relationship early and have a childhood love, but it was already too late.In the empty Great Council Hall, Lin Tianyuan was still convincing himself to stay true to his feelings.Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but frown upon hearing them.Boom!Lin Jiufeng pushed open the door of the Great Council Hall.Lin Tianyuan was startled.\u201cUncle!\u201dLin Tianyuan looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise. He hurriedly greeted him respectfully.\u201cHmph, follow me.\u201d Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t give him a pleasant look.He turned around and left.Lin Tianyuan was dumbfounded.He didn\u2019t know where they were going, but he didn\u2019t dare not to go.He could only follow Lin Jiufeng from behind.Gradually, he realized that something was amiss.They were going to the Empress\u2019s Palace.There was only a single person living in the Empress\u2019s Palace at this moment.His beloved concubine, Mei Niang.\u201cUncle! Mei Niang is innocent.\u201d\u201cIf you are angry, beat me up. Don\u2019t hurt her,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said in a hurry.\u201cI won\u2019t hurt her, but I wonder if someone will show mercy later.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s footsteps didn\u2019t stop as he sneered.\u201cUncle, it\u2019s fine as long as you don\u2019t make a move. I can stop anyone else.\u201dLin Tianyuan heaved a sigh of relief and relaxed.As the Emperor, the only person he was afraid of was Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng continued to move forward with Lin Tianyuan.Along the way, they encountered many maids, guards, and eunuchs.But these people didn\u2019t seem to have seen them for some reason.Even though the two clearly passed by in front of them, they acted as if they were never there.Just like that, they arrived in front of the Empress\u2019 Palace.The palace was closed and there were guards everywhere.The lights inside were dim, only revealing a faint shadow.Lin Tianyuan watched with a smile.This graceful figure was his beloved concubine.\u201cBut these doors and windows are tightly shut, it\u2019s bad for ventilation,\u201d Lin Tianyuan muttered.\u201cIf she didn\u2019t close the doors and windows completely, how could she relax enough to reveal herself?\u201d Lin Jiufeng said coldly as he directly passed through the door with Lin Tianyuan.The tightly shut door didn\u2019t serve as an obstruction to the Divine Soul of a Human God.He brought Lin Tianyuan in and Lin Tianyuan instantly sought for his beloved concubine.But there was only a mountain spirit in the form of a human in here.It had white fur all over its body, sharp nails, and wrinkled skin.It was a demonic beast.A type of mountain spirit or what the locals call\u2014a mountain ghost.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s body trembled.His expression turned green and ugly.He was so shocked that he couldn\u2019t speak.He glanced at Lin Jiufeng and shook his head frantically.\u201cUncle\u2026 It can\u2019t be\u2026\u201d At this moment, Lin Tianyuan trembled as he spoke.With this, his love died.He wasn\u2019t stupid, he was just blinded by love.He yearned for others to love him, and he yearned to love others the same way.In addition, he became conceited and blinded by his power as the Emperor.But at this moment, his mind had become crystal clear as he guessed the answers to his questions.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t speak.He raised his head and gestured for Lin Tianyuan to continue watching.This Mei Niang didn\u2019t dare to expose herself for too long.She only revealed herself for less than three minutes before she started putting her disguise back on.An extremely terrifying mountain spirit put on the skin of a young girl in front of Lin Jiufeng and Lin Tianyuan.Then, she picked up the so-called \u2018face of a man\u2019s first love\u2019s\u2019 and concealed her true face with it.The Mei Niang who attracted Lin Tianyuan so much has appeared.She even winked at the mirror.Lin Jiufeng looked at Lin Tianyuan indifferently.At this moment, Lin Tianyuan\u2019s face turned red and his body started to tremble.Extreme anger and shame coated his heart.His first love!His love!He made a lot of sacrifices for this woman\u2026He thought that he would be blessed, but he didn\u2019t expect everything to be like this.Lin Tianyuan was so angry that he couldn\u2019t speak.Under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expressionless gaze, he spat out a mouthful of blood.\u201cSlut, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201dAll of a sudden, Lin Tianyuan drew his Emperor Sword and let out a loud roar.He directly charged forward.Lin Jiufeng released his concealment technique.Mei Niang was dumbfounded.She looked at Lin Tianyuan, whose eyes had turned red from anger.Her heart skipped a beat. She instantly knew that she was in trouble.\u201cYour Majesty, why are you here?\u201d Mei Niang forced a smile and avoided the sword.Her body and mind were nimble, revealing the fact that she had a cultivation base.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Lin Tianyuan was about to go crazy.To him, this was a great humiliation. He was deceived by a mountain spirit.He couldn\u2019t wait to cut this slut into pieces and turn her into minced meat.Lin Jiufeng watched calmly as Lin Tianyuan\u2019s love turned into hatred.How much he loved her just now was how much he hated her right now.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s love died completely.\u201cDon\u2019t kill her. You must capture her and interrogate her carefully. There must be someone behind her, find out who that person is.\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked at the crazed Lin Tianyuan as he coldly gave an order.Lin Tianyuan, who was still chasing after Mei Niang, immediately stopped.Then, he roared in fury. \u201cNameless, catch this b*tch! Arrest her maids and eunuchs too! Interrogate them strictly! I want this mastermind behind all of these to die!\u201dNameless immediately appeared. He was only at the Martial Sage Realm, yet his appearance caused Mei Niang\u2019s face to turn pale with fright. Turning around, she hurriedly tried to escape.But she was only good with charming skills not with fighting.How could she be a match for a Martial Sage?With a single move, she was captured.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s hand that was holding the sword trembled slightly.He wished to do nothing but separate her head from her shoulders right this instant.The so-called first love\u2019s face whom he had fallen in love with had now turned into something grotesque in his heart.\u201cUncle, thank you. Otherwise, I would have been forced to eternal damnation.\u201dLin Tianyuan tried his best to control his emotions as he expressed his gratitude to Lin Tianyuan.\u201cSettling all the mistakes that you have made during this period of time is the greatest display of gratitude that you can do for me. Since you\u2019re that stupid, then don\u2019t talk about feelings anymore. You cannot win against them.\u201d Lin Jiufeng scolded without holding back.After his scolding, he turned around and disappeared, leaving with him a few words of advice. \u201cInvestigate this matter thoroughly. How can the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty be played around like this by them?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t let them off without making them pay the price in blood!\u201dLin Tianyuan\u2019s gaze turned vicious as he said, \u201cYes!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Livestock-Making, Skin-PaintingIt was late at night, but the Forbidden City was wide awake.Lin Tianyuan was shell-shocked.However, this blow knocked him down a peg or two from his arrogance.Following Lin Jiufeng\u2019s reprimand, Lin Tianyuan began to reflect on his actions during this period of time.He was scared!Thinking about it, his back broke out in cold sweat.It was instantly drenched.\u201cFortunately, I have Uncle\u2026\u201d\u201cOtherwise, my Yuhua God Dynasty would have truly been in trouble,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said with lingering fear.His pride, arrogance, and his ego were nowhere to be found in him at this moment.It was already incredibly late in the night.A eunuch saw Lin Tianyuan standing in the palace for a long time.He said softly, \u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s already late. Please rest now.\u201d\u201cNo need. I want to leave the palace and visit my court officials one by one.\u201dLin Tianyuan shook his head.After his reflection, he began to think of ways to reverse what he had done.Fortunately, the court officials that he had deposed were still in the Imperial Capital.They still haven\u2019t left.After all, their families were huge and they had a lot of people under their care. It just wasn\u2019t possible for them to leave so quickly.Lin Tianyuan visited them overnight and talked to them one by one, persuading them to come back.He had made a mistake and was willing to correct it.He would appease these court officials tonight and interrogate that slut tomorrow.\u2026In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul returned and merged with his body.The white cat wrote and asked, \u201cWhat happened in the Forbidden City?\u201dLin Jiufeng replied softly, \u201cA mountain spirit used a strange cultivation technique and changed its body shape and appearance. It entered the harem and caused trouble, creating unrest. I went out there to expose her.\u201dThe white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise.It moved its claws and wrote. \u201cA mountain spirit?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lin Jiufeng carefully introduced Concubine Ming\u2019s original appearance.The white cat listened before it silently wrote a few words.\u201cMountain Ghost Race!\u201dLin Jiufeng raised his brows and said, \u201cYou also think that she\u2019s from the Mountain Ghost Race, right?\u201dAfter seeing Concubine Ming\u2019s true form, Lin Jiufeng suspected that she was from the Mountain Ghost Race that he had read about in those ancient books.There were historical records that in the world back then that had an abundance of spiritual energy\u2014apart from humans who could cultivate\u2014there were many wild beasts that gained intelligence to the point of being able to cultivate.Like the white cat, they eventually became demons.Among them, there were different types of beasts and races.The Mountain Ghost Race was one of them.Mountain spirits and the mountain ghosts that ordinary people often allegedly encountered were creatures that gained intelligence and slowly cultivated to the point that they became strong enough to become a member of the Mountain Ghost Race.But the history books also mentioned that 1,500 years ago\u2014the Mountain Ghost Race was exterminated and hunted to extinction.He didn\u2019t expect that they would reappear 1,500 years later and even target Lin Tianyuan.Mei Niang\u2019s skin drawing skills were superb. If it weren\u2019t for Lin Jiufeng, none of the hundreds of Martial Sages in the Imperial Court would have noticed something amiss.They really thought that she was just that innocent teenage girl.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect them to be so ambitious.\u201d The white cat wrote in surprise.\u201cEven if they are ambitious, they still need to have the ability to match their ambitions. Else, it is only a pipe dream.\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression turned slightly cold.The mastermind must definitely be found.But he shall leave this matter to Lin Tianyuan.After all, Lin Tianyuan probably wanted to know more about the identity of the person behind Mei Niang than anyone else.\u2026The next day, Dachun\u2019s monthly food delivery came.The white cat followed Lin Jiufeng and started to eat and drink.Dachun brought good wine, good food, and the fruits that the white cat liked to eat.\u201cYour Royal Highness, there was an earth-shattering turn of events in the Imperial Capital last night! Let me tell you about it.\u201d Dachun began the small talk like usual.Lin Jiufeng drank some wine and asked, \u201cWhat turn of events?\u201d\u201cI told you last month that Emperor Ming was going to abolish the Empress and appoint the Imperial Concubine Ming as his Empress. He really abolished her two days ago,\u201d Dachun said.\u201cBut just last night, or more accurately, in the latter half of the night, an imperial decree was sent out of the city, announcing that the Empress had been reinstated.\u201d\u201cThat Concubine Ming\u2014who was doted on by Emperor Ming\u2014was instead sent to prison and is currently being strictly monitored. Her crime is bringing disaster to the harem.\u201dAs Dachun spoke, his confusion grew.This reversal was just too shocking and too sudden.Everyone thought that Emperor Ming had made up his mind to abolish the Empress, but who would have thought that the tables would turn around so fast?The Empress returned to her original position.Nothing happened to her in the end.But the favored Concubine Ming was sent to prison.Lin Jiufeng chuckled. \u201cIt\u2019s better for you not to inquire about the harem.\u201d\u201cYour Royal Highness is right. I don\u2019t really inquire about the harem. But last night, Emperor Ming left the Forbidden City overnight and went to the residences of every court official. He personally persuaded them to stay\u2026\u201d\u201cEarlier in the morning, I discovered that they really stayed behind!\u201d\u201cThe court officials were reinstated and they all went to the Imperial Court early this morning.\u201dDachun felt that he couldn\u2019t understand the situation in the Imperial Capital anymore.Two days ago, there was a lot of commotion.There was even discord between the Emperor and the court officials.The outsiders were starting to look at them as a bunch of clowns.But today, they were suddenly united in harmony?\u201cYour Royal Highness, I don\u2019t understand the changes in the imperial capital anymore.\u201dDachun sighed.Lin Jiufeng laughed and said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it either, that\u2019s why I stopped bothering about it.\u201d\u201cYour Royal Highness is right. If I don\u2019t understand it, then I should just ignore it. It\u2019s better to just do my own thing. Other matters have nothing to do with me.\u201dDachun waited happily for Lin Jiufeng to finish his meal.Afterwards, he packed the dishes and took them away.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat were both satisfied with their food.Then, they started cultivating on their own.In the evening, Lin Tianyuan came.Since Lin Jiufeng refused to see Lin Tianyuan the last time, this was his first time here in a few years.This time, Lin Jiufeng let him in.After a single night, Lin Tianyuan aged more than ten years.He was both mentally and physically exhausted.The moment he saw Lin Jiufeng, he immediately knelt down.Peng! Peng! Peng!Before saying anything, he kowtowed three times first.\u201cUncle, thank you for saving my life,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said sadly.\u201cI\u2019m only doing this for the sake of your father. If there\u2019s a next time, even if you\u2019ll die, I won\u2019t save you,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said coldly.His attitude towards Lin Tianyuan became cold.\u201cUncle, I know my mistake. From today onwards, I will put my heart and soul into governing the dynasty. I will not think about anything else.\u201d Lin Tianyuan was telling him the truth.He was truly disheartened by what had happened.He now had no interest in women at all.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cI\u2019ve discovered the identity of the mastermind behind that mountain spirit,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said solemnly.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Lin Jiufeng was quite curious.\u201cThe mastermind mentioned by the mountain spirit is a powerful cultivator named Lord Mountain Ghost. He was also the one who gave her the human skin mask. He was also the one who planned all of this,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said in a deep voice.\u201cLord Mountain Ghost\u2026 Where is he?\u201d\u201cThat mountain spirit\u2019s status is too low. She doesn\u2019t know where Lord Mountain Ghost is.\u201dLin Tianyuan shook his head, his expression looked ugly.\u201cWhat exactly is the method that he used to put on someone else\u2019s skin yet none of you were able to discover it?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.\u201cIt\u2019s called Livestock-Making Technique. It\u2019s a very evil technique that strips the skin off a young lady\u2019s body perfectly. After being refined by another secret technique, the skin becomes a vessel for the cultivator. Then, it uses the mountain spirit as a catalyst for the Livestock-Making Technique. Once the skin is put on, it will become a beautiful woman\u2019s body.\u201d\u201cWith the addition of the art of Skin-Painting Technique, it would be a piece of cake to deceive other people with someone else\u2019s skin.\u201dWhen Lin Tianyuan was done saying all of these, his heart was in extreme pain.He really regretted it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Mountain Ghost\u2019s Evil ActLooking at the regretful Lin Tianyuan, Lin Jiufeng thought of a sentence.[People only regret their decision when they are sober.]Lin Tianyuan was obviously sober by now.He had reverted back to his obedient self.Mentioning the Livestock-Making Technique and Skin-Painting Technique, he couldn\u2019t help but feel disgusted. His resentment towards the Mountain Ghost Race soared to the peak.The Mountain Ghost Race must die.Especially that mastermind\u2014Lord Mountain Ghost.\u201cSince you already have the relevant information with you, then you\u2019ll be in charge of finding this Lord Mountain Ghost. Investigate everything thoroughly and kill those that deserved to die.\u201d\u201cThis matter that almost forced the Yuhua God Dynasty into chaos cannot be allowed to happen a second time,\u201d Lin Jiufeng coldly said.He had previously said that he wouldn\u2019t help Lin Tianyuan.He would let Lin Tianyuan walk his own path.This time, Lin Tianyuan made a mistake.And Lin Jiufeng helped him correct that mistake.But this didn\u2019t mean that Lin Jiufeng would help him take revenge.There was an abundance of Martial Sages in the Yuhua God Dynasty and the territory under his control was vast. Lin Tianyuan had also considerably calmed down by now. In that case, wouldn\u2019t it be easy for him to hunt down the members of the Mountain Ghost Race?\u201cI understand. I will handle this matter appropriately. I won\u2019t dare to trouble Uncle again.\u201dLin Tianyuan nodded sensibly.\u201cUncle, I shall take my leave!\u201d Lin Tianyuan got up and left.He knew that Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want to be disturbed.After sharing the inside story of this matter, he left.Next, he was going to massacre the Mountain Ghost Race.In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng looked at Lin Tianyuan\u2019s departing figure and nodded in satisfaction.\u201cHe has indeed matured a lot.\u201dThe blow that he had suffered this time was huge.To Lin Tianyuan, it instantly dispelled his childishness, his fantasies, and his ego.He had truly matured after suffering under such a heavy hand.He was determined to take his own revenge.Meow!The white cat called out and nodded.It also felt that Lin Tianyuan had truly matured.\u201cIt\u2019s just that the price of maturity is often very heavy.\u201dLin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but shake his head and sigh at Lin Tianyuan\u2019s predicament.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s attitude towards Lin Tianyuan was cold because he expected better from him.However, Lin Jiufeng was Emperor Yuan\u2019s son and his nephew after all.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s heart ached for Lin Tianyuan too after he encountered such a shocking truth.\u2026With Emperor Ming\u2019s sudden epiphany about his mistakes, he managed to correct the churning chaos in time. Fortunately, the disturbance that he caused within the Imperial Capital never shook the foundations of the Yuhua God Dynasty.The Yuhua God Dynasty was still the same as before\u2014the same massive dynasty.But when this massive machine operated, the energy that erupted from it was terrifying.It was a calamity for the Mountain Ghost Race.The mountain ghosts that had just been born and were wandering in the forest were captured and interrogated strictly.In just a few days, they lost many of their own kind.This made Lord Mountain Ghost\u2014who was planning on plotting against the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2014unable to stand still.He knew that Concubine Ming must have been exposed and she had confessed everything.The Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s actions of going all out to exterminate the Mountain Ghost Race was something that he had never expected.In a room within the Imperial Capital, an old man was reading a secret letter.Contained within the letter were the events that happened in the Forbidden City within the past few days.It was much more detailed than the rumors, causing Lord Mountain Ghost to frown.\u201cI thought that this move would be able to deal with the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty without anyone knowing about the truth. Afterwards, I would then be able to control the Emperor and force him to provide welfare for my Mountain Ghost Race.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that all my efforts ended up in smokes. I\u2019m already at the step of abolishing the Empress, just how did the plan fail?\u201d\u201cCould it be that the Human God of the Yuhua God Dynasty interfered?\u201d\u201cBut the skin bag that I gave to Mei Niang for the Livestock-Making Technique was made by our ancestor. Even a Human God couldn\u2019t possibly see through it so easily.\u201d\u201cMei Niang is one of the best among my Mountain Ghost Race. She won\u2019t give herself away. I just didn\u2019t expect that she would fail when it was about time to reap the benefits.\u201dThe old man was remorseful.His face looked gloomy and terrifying amidst the flickering light of the lamp.He had never imagined even in her wildest dreams that Mei Niang herself would be the one to reveal herself by removing her disguise to take a breather. Coincidentally, all of these were done under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s watchful eyes too.All of my efforts down the drain!But if Lord Mountain Ghost knew about what truly unfolded that night, he would definitely vomit a mouthful of blood in anger.He moved away from the illumination of the light.In the darkness, his wrinkles were deep.He wore rough hemp clothes and a look was enough to tell that he was a poor commoner living at the bottom of society.He was part of a very poor family with nothing but an old man remaining in the family.This old man became the target of Lord Mountain Ghost for his Livestock-Making Technique.From then on, the family had a new dog.Beneath the old man\u2019s skin was Lord Mountain Ghost, while the original old man lived inside that tied-up dog.As for the meat beneath the skin of that dog?Lord Mountain Ghost had already consumed it.Just like that, he managed to successfully stay in the Imperial Capital.Then, he remote-controlled Mei Niang and manipulated everything from behind the scenes.But now that the Yuhua God Dynasty had discovered this matter, he prepared to pack up and leave.But now that the Yuhua God Dynasty was now cognizant of this matter, he prepared to pack up and leave with his deductions in mind.\u201cThe plan\u2019s failure was caused by the Human God of the Yuhua God Dynasty. He is just too powerful and he saw through Lady Mei\u2019s disguise. Now that the Mountain Ghost Race is in trouble, it will be too difficult for me to save them.\u201d\u201cI have to ask the ancestor to stop the Yuhua God Dynasty from killing them all.\u201d Lord Mountain Ghost remained strangely calm under all of these. He seemed to know what he should do, and what he shouldn\u2019t do.The plan had failed.The Yuhua God Dynasty was now on their guard.He must leave now.Lord Mountain Ghost took off his outer clothes in front of the tied-up dog.Beneath the clothes was the skin of a very old man.The dog whimpered. It cried, but it couldn\u2019t make a sound.On closer look, its tongue had been sliced off.After removing his skin, Lord Mountain Ghost revealed his true appearance.His true visage was a mountain spirit that looked like a wild monkey.His body was thin and shriveled.This was also the reason why he chose to target the elderly.After all, there was no need for him to change into anything because their physique suited him.His cultivation was not that bad\u2014at the Martial Sage Realm.His entire body was black.His arms were long and his claws were also black.His eyes were blood-red. It made him look like a malicious ghost.\u201cI\u2019ve occupied your house for quite some time now, and I am returning it to you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll also leave your very own skin bag here. Put it back on if you have the ability to do so,\u201d Lord Mountain Ghost said to the dog.He laughed evilly. \u201cI forgot to tell you\u2026\u201d\u201cAll these years, the owners of the skin bags that I have chosen after executing the Livestock-Making Technique were all killed.\u201d\u201cBut you are the first one to survive\u2026\u201d\u201cEven I\u2014do not have the heart to kill someone who is already so old. Just take it that I am accumulating good karma. You must thank me for this.\u201dThe dog whimpered and looked angrily at Lord Mountain Ghost.\u201cYou were originally going to die. But now that I\u2019ve stitched you together with this dog, you have more than a decade in extra years to live. Thank me for it.\u201dLord Mountain Ghost chuckled before he turned around and left in a hurry.He wanted to find the ancestor of the Mountain Ghost Race and make the Yuhua God Dynasty give up on their pursuit against the Mountain Ghost Race.His body clad entirely in black, he left the Imperial Capital using the night as his veil.The next day, the dog forcefully broke free from the ropes and ran to the streets.It shed bloody tears non-stop as it wrote with its claws.The old man didn\u2019t recognize many words, but he stubbornly wrote them out.Some of them were written wrongly, and some couldn\u2019t be understood at all.He was so anxious that bloody tears kept falling down his cheeks.One after another, people helped him complete this bloody letter.And this blood letter spread throughout the Imperial Capital.Countless people found out what Lord Mountain Ghost had done.Shock!Anger!The anger of the masses was instantly ignited.The crowd\u2019s emotions surged.They pulled the Mountain Ghost Race, a race that had disappeared for 1,500 years and was assumed to be extinct, into the limelight.Fifteen minutes later, a bloody letter appeared on Lin Tianyuan\u2019s table.When Lin Tianyuan saw it, he flew into a rage and ordered a strict investigation.It was only then that he discovered that Lord Mountain Ghost had been hiding in the Imperial Capital all this time and he had escaped last night.But before he left, he even harmed an innocent old man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Midnight NightmareThe bloody letter revealed the terrifying Livestock-Making technique to the world.Everyone went into an uproar.In the Forbidden City, Lin Tianyuan issued an imperial decree.Only five words were written\u2026Exterminate the Mountain Ghost Race!His order received the cheers and support of the people.With this, the matter finally came to an end.Lin Tianyuan directly got the imperial guards and the Forbidden Troops to search for every member of the Mountain Ghost Race. As long as any of them were found, they would be arrested and brought to the Imperial Capital for imprisonment.Lin Tianyuan wanted to use the life and death of the captured members of the Mountain Ghost Race to attract Lord Mountain Ghost and lure him over to the capital.\u2026In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng and the white cat heard the lively discussion of the people outside.Under normal circumstances, Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t really hear any noise from the outside while he was in the Cold Palace. He also didn\u2019t take the initiative to listen to the outside world.But even Lin Jiufeng was disturbed by the people\u2019s fury.Using his Divine Soul, he expanded his spiritual perception and listened to the noises coming from the outside world. Through the crowd\u2019s voices, Lin Jiufeng found out what was going on.He also learned about the contents of the bloody letter.The white cat did the same as him and it also found out what was going on outside.After the man and cat understood the situation, they fell silent.The Livestock-Making Technique truly was evil.But Lord Mountain Ghost was a greater evil.To think that he would even set his sights on a lonely old man.Furthermore, he didn\u2019t even kill the old man.Instead, he wanted the old man to continue living as a dog.He clearly wanted to humiliate the old man!After understanding the contents of the bloody letter, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression turned cold.He said, \u201cI should have made a move and killed this Lord Mountain Ghost.\u201dHe thought that Lin Tianyuan could handle this matter, but who knew that Lord Mountain Ghost was this cunning and evil?If he had known that this would be the case, Lin Jiufeng would have attacked directly.No matter how powerful or cunning that Lord Mountain Ghost was\u2014he wouldn\u2019t have been able to escape from the Imperial Capital.Seeing that Lin Jiufeng was blaming himself, the white cat meowed and comforted him.Lin Jiufeng shook his head. Lord Mountain Ghost had already escaped from the Imperial Capital. Even if he was a Human God, it would still be difficult for him to find the latter.Was this matter going to be forgotten just like that?\u2026It has been seven days since Lord Mountain Ghost escaped.The matter regarding the bloody letter and the old man eventually died down.Although the old man still died in the end. He chose to end his own life.Everyone gradually forgot about this matter.However, the Imperial Court\u2019s army had set out to capture mountain ghosts everywhere.Whenever they discovered one, they would capture it.As a result, the common people still felt a sense of security with their actions.But to the Mountain Ghost Race, this was a catastrophe.It has been 1,500 years since their last appearance, yet they immediately offended the number one superpower in the world.The Yuhua God Dynasty!The number of Martial Sages beneath the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s banner could be considered to be close to a thousand already. In the face of such an overwhelmingly powerful force, the resistance of the Mountain Ghost Race was akin to that of a rock against an egg.Noticing these events, Lord Mountain Ghost became anxious.He hurriedly set out to find the sleeping ancestor of their race so that the Mountain Ghost Race in its entirety could be saved.\u201cLet\u2019s see if your Yuhua God Dynasty can withstand the power of our ancestor from 1,500 years ago!\u201d Lord Mountain Ghost said with resentment.\u2026At night, Lin Tianyuan went to the Empress\u2019s Palace to sleep.Although he had no love for the Queen, after having interacted with her for so long, he knew how much he had hurt the Empress by being so foolish.Hence, he started to come over to her palace every day to accompany this first wife of his.Late at night, Lin Tianyuan was finally done dealing with the state affairs as he slept with the Empress.Usually, Lin Tianyuan never slept outright whenever he was done with the state affairs. Instead, he would quietly cultivate for a few hours to strengthen his cultivation base.But tonight, he truly fell asleep.This was the first time that Lin Tianyuan truly slept since his need for sleep disappeared due to his cultivation base.Tonight, he not only fell asleep, but he also had a dream.\u2026It was a nightmare!In his dream, Lin Tianyuan felt that he was being pursued by an evil dragon.Its speed was so fast that it was about to catch up to him and swallow him whole.He ran and fought back, but it was useless.He was sent flying by its tail.He crashed heavily onto the ground as he spat out several mouthfuls of blood.But just as he was unable to resist\u2026The dragon let out a deafening sound. \u201cEmperor of the mortal world, release those captured members of the Mountain Ghost Race, or I will devour your soul.\u201dWith that said, the dragon bit down and swallowed Lin Tianyuan.\u201cNo!\u201dIn the Empress\u2019s Palace, Lin Tianyuan jumped up in shock.He was drenched in sweat.His face was pale and his figure wobbled weakly.It was obvious that something had consumed some of his life energy.\u201cYour Majesty. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d The Empress asked worriedly.Lin Tianyuan looked around and slowly recalled. \u201cI\u2026 had a\u2026 I had a nightmare.\u201dThe Empress advised. \u201cYour Majesty, you are too occupied with a lot of things every day\u2026\u201d\u201cYou must be tired.\u201d\u201cI will get someone to make some supplements for the nourishment of your body. Dreams are all the opposite of reality. Since it\u2019s a nightmare, it means that Your Majesty is about to encounter something good.\u201d\u201cSomething good?\u201d Lin Tianyuan murmured.He didn\u2019t think so.The evil dragon in his dream had mentioned the Mountain Ghost Race.Could it be that he had been too obsessed with them recently and thus, he dreamed about them?After expressing his gratitude but dismissing the Queen\u2019s good intentions, Lin Tianyuan suppressed the doubts in his heart.He rested and recovered a little, then he dealt with the state affairs.At night, he stayed alone in the Great Council Hall.He wasn\u2019t going to sleep, he planned to deal with the state affairs through the night.But in the latter half of the night, the lights flickered slightly.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s expression became absent-minded.He saw someone walking into the Great Council Hall.A person shrouded in shadows was holding a blood-red longsword, dripping blood.As he walked in, the sound of footsteps echoed.What was even more terrifying was that behind this person, a sea of blood was surging.As he walked, it surged over, wanting to drown the entire Great Council Hall.\u201cEmperor of the mortal world, it seems that you have forgotten what I warned you about yesterday.\u201d The man who was shrouded in shadows spoke in a cold voice.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s eyes widened as he watched in disbelief.\u201cToday is the last warning. There won\u2019t be a third chance.\u201d\u201cIf you still don\u2019t release the captured mountain ghosts, I will come and take your worthless life tomorrow!\u201dThe black shadow warned Lin Tianyuan before he slashed down with the blood-red longsword.The blood-red longsword swept up a sea of blood.Lin Tianyuan couldn\u2019t withstand the strike.He couldn\u2019t move at all.Boom!This sword directly split Lin Tianyuan into two.The pain was very real, jolting him awake from fright.The Great Council Hall was still the same Great Council Hall as usual, but Lin Tianyuan felt as if he had lost half of his life.\u201cIt\u2019s the people of the Mountain Ghost Race causing trouble. They want to kill me, but I won\u2019t give in!\u201d Lin Tianyuan gnashed his teeth.He slowly tried to heal the injuries on his body.This kind of attack was incredible.The attack he had just suffered through\u2014truly was incredible.Once he recovered a little, he left the Great Council Hall.He headed straight for the Cold Palace.Arriving in front of the Cold Palace, Lin Tianyuan knelt on the ground and shouted, \u201cUncle, save me!\u201dLin Jiufeng waved his sleeve and the doors of the Cold Palace opened.He was very surprised to see Lin Tianyuan who seemed to have lost half of his life.\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cUncle, it\u2019s the Mountain Ghost Race. They are the ones causing trouble and threatening me to release the captured mountain ghosts,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said weakly.He explained the situation to Lin Jiufeng.In the previous two nights, he lost more than half of his life energy.He was on the verge of collapse.If that nightmare happened again, then he would definitely die.\u201cThe Mountain Ghost Race!\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes flashed sharply.\u201cIt\u2019s the ability to send one\u2019s Divine Soul into a dream.\u201d The white cat wrote with its claws.It knew about this strange attack.\u201cEntering a dream with his Divine Soul? I will slay his Divine Soul tonight!\u201dLin Jiufeng snorted coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Please Go and Die!Tonight, Lin Tianyuan came to the Empress\u2019s Palace to rest.After being continuously killed in his dreams, he was very weak.Lin Tianyuan knew that he could not die anymore.If he died in his dream the third time, then he would also die in the outside world.\u201cYour Majesty, it\u2019s better to ask the imperial physicians to come over here and take a look,\u201d The Empress said worriedly when she saw Lin Tianyuan in such a weakened state.Lin Tianyuan shook his head calmly.His face was pale and his body was weak, but his thoughts were still vivid.He replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. Only you can stay with me here tonight.\u201d\u201cLet the others go out.\u201d\u201cRemember\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter what happens, don\u2019t disturb me and don\u2019t make a fuss.\u201dAlthough the Empress didn\u2019t know what was going on, she was never a nosy person.\u201cI understand.\u201dThe Empress helped Lin Tianyuan lie on the bed and she also helped him sleep.Then, she dismissed the maids and the servants.She looked at Lin Tianyuan quietly.The night gradually deepened.The lights suddenly danced and flickered.Lin Tianyuan, who had been asleep for less than an hour, started to sweat.His entire body started to tremble unconsciously.The Empress\u2019s expression changed.She was nervous.Staring at the beaded sweat on Lin Tianyuan\u2019s forehead, she wanted to reach out and wipe Lin Tianyuan\u2019s sweat.But in the very next moment, a resplendent light burst out.A figure walked into the room from the outside and said, \u201cDon\u2019t touch him, he\u2019s in a very dangerous condition as we speak.\u201dThe Empress looked at the newcomer in surprise.Under the cover of the brilliant light, she couldn\u2019t see Lin Jiufeng\u2019s appearance at all.\u201cHuman God!\u201dBut she still managed to guess his identity.He was the Human God living in seclusion within the confines of the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201cI will guard the surroundings. I will not disturb Senior\u2019s treatment of His Majesty.\u201dThe Empress said respectfully as she moved back a little, not wanting to disturb Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng was satisfied with her attitude.She knew when to advance and when to retreat.She knew what was good for her, and her every move was openhanded.[Do you want to Sign-In at the Empress\u2019s Palace?]Suddenly, a line of words appeared before Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t expect the Sign-In prompt to appear at such a moment.\u201cSign-in!\u201d But since he was already here, how could he refuse?He hadn\u2019t signed in at the Empress Palace yet.He had already visited the palace when he came here to expose Concubine Ming. But for some reason, the Sign-In prompt didn\u2019t appear that day.This time, it appeared rather quickly.[Sign-In successful. Received Nine Slashes of the Demon Soul!]This was an offensive technique that could only be used through one\u2019s Divine Soul.It had nine moves that could instantly dissipate an enemy\u2019s Divine Soul.\u201cGood. Just as I needed\u2026 This will make it easier for me to annihilate the other party\u2019s Divine Soul.\u201d Lin Jiufeng was overjoyed.He closed his eyes and instantly received the corresponding knowledge and wisdom necessary to execute the technique.It didn\u2019t take him long to learn the Nine Slashes of the Demon Soul. He opened his eyes and looked at Lin Tianyuan.He was already being plagued by nightmares.A black mist lingered between his brows.Boom!Lin Jiufeng placed his palm on Lin Tianyuan\u2019s forehead and a vast amount of Divine Soul energy slowly seeped into Lin Tianyuan.At this moment, the world inside Lin Tianyuan\u2019s Divine Soul was undergoing a huge change.He was captured and imprisoned inside a dark palace.There was a huge black fog surrounding him, and there was an extremely terrifying existence in the black fog.A seemingly infinite black fog had surrounded him.There also seemed to be a terrifying existence hidden from within the fog itself.Plap!A whip struck Lin Tianyuan\u2019s body.Lord Mountain Ghost who looked like a water monkey also appeared.He was looking at Lin Tianyuan with a hideous look on his face.\u201cEmperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty, aren\u2019t you very powerful?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we made ourselves known to the outside world. There aren\u2019t many of us yet, and you actually dared send an order to capture us all?\u201dLord Mountain Ghost looked at Lin Tianyuan in fury.\u201cYou actually dared to appear here?\u201d Lin Tianyuan\u2019s face was pale.Yet, he wasn\u2019t flustered at all despite being whipped.Instead, he sneered.\u201cThis is the Divine Soul World of my Mountain Spirit Race\u2019s ancestor. We used a secret technique to bring your Divine Soul here. In this world, unless one has a deep understanding of the Divine Soul, they cannot find this place,\u201d Lord Mountain Spirit said proudly.He wasn\u2019t afraid at all.\u201cIn the Imperial Capital, you are the Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty, you have a lot of power.\u201d\u201cBut here\u2026 I am the king!\u201d\u201cEven if the gods are here, even if that Human God from your Yuhua God Dynasty is here, he must kneel before me!\u201dLord Mountain Ghost shouted arrogantly.\u201cIs that so?\u201dBut he wasn\u2019t smug for long before a cold voice sounded.Then, a resplendent sword light split the black fog and directly shone on the dark palace.Lin Jiufeng\u2014who was shrouded in a golden radiance\u2014appeared.He stared at Lord Mountain Ghost with a cold gaze.Pointing his finger like a sword, he said, \u201cCan you repeat what you just said?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cYou are a Human God?\u201d\u201cWhy are you here? This is the Divine Soul World of my Mountain Ghost Race\u2019s ancestor\u2026\u201d\u201cHow can you be here/\u201dLord Mountain Ghost looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise and doubt.His arrogance seemed to have been smothered by Lin Jiufeng\u2019s appearance.\u201cI\u2019m here to kill you!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said bluntly.Lin Jiufeng originally wanted to save Lin Tianyuan and catch the mastermind, but who would have thought that he would accidentally encounter Lord Mountain Ghost whom he wanted to kill?Since this was the case, Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t going to be courteous.\u201cHahaha. My ears aren\u2019t ringing, are they?\u201d\u201cIn the Divine Soul World of my ancestor, you said that you wanted to kill me? You want to kill me here? Do you think that my ancestor doesn\u2019t exist?\u201dLord Mountain Ghost was full of confidence. He wasn\u2019t afraid of Lin Jiufeng.Behind him, the thick black fog rolled. There was a terrifying existence inside of it.\u201cHow can a coward who just hides in the dark and doesn\u2019t even dare to show himself protect you?\u201d Lin Jiufeng said in disdain. He raised his hand and executed the Nine Slashes of the Demon Soul that he had just received earlier from signing in.The first stance of the Nine Slashes of the Demon Soul, Heavenly Sword Soul Break!Using his finger as a sword, he connected both the sky and the earth.In the Divine Soul World, Lin Jiufeng could also summon the wind and rain.His Divine Soul was overwhelmingly powerful.In the very next moment, his sword slashed out.\u201cAncestor, save me!\u201d Lord Mountain Ghost shouted rather calmly.He didn\u2019t believe that even a Human God like Lin Jiufeng could kill him in the Divine Soul World of his ancestor.The surging black fog also moved.It condensed into a shield and directly blocked in front of Lord Mountain Ghost.Dong!The shield was as black as ink, and the patterns on its surface looked very real.It seemed to be very powerful.Lord Mountain Ghost\u2019s smile of confidence widened.But Lin Jiufeng was similarly confident.He only said softly, \u201cYou\u2019re already dead!\u201dAs his words fell, the Nine Slashes of the Demon Soul directly split the shield into pieces with a bang.A stroke of the sword was all it took for him to annihilate Lord Mountain Ghost\u2019s Divine Soul.It looked very easy.The black shield seemed sturdy, but under the Nine Slashes of the Demon Soul that was filled with Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword intent, the shield was akin to that of a piece of paper.Lord Mountain Ghost looked at Lin Jiufeng in a daze.His Divine Soul has been forcefully dissipated. It scattered into a black fog that disappeared.Before he could completely die, he stared fixedly at Lin Jiufeng.He wanted to know why.Why was this strike so powerful?But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t even look at him.Killing him like this was almost like letting him off easy.He had finally gotten his revenge for that old man.Lin Jiufeng looked at the surging black fog around him.The black fog seemed furious.It was enraged as the massive pressure it carried similar to a storm came crashing down.Lin Jiufeng stood with his hands behind his back.He looked at it calmly and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be angry. Come and take my strike too!\u201dOnly by receiving this strike without dying would the existence within the fog have the right to be angry.Otherwise, even if he was thousands of miles away, Lin Jiufeng would still be able to find his true body.With these words, the black fog actually began to dissipate on its own to escape.It realized that Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t someone to be trifled with.Clang!The same longsword that penetrated the Imperial Capital\u2019s palace long ago appeared behind Lin Jiufeng\u2019s back.He performed another stance from the Nine Slashes of the Demon Soul.Annihilation!\u201cPlease go and die!\u201d Lin Jiufeng said seriously.With a swing of his sword, the entire Divine Soul World was instantly torn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It let out a muffled groan.Unfortunately, it managed to escape in the end.It left the Divine Soul World with a body full of injuries.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t stop it. After all, this place was created by it.No one could stop it from leaving.\u201cThe sword energy that I left in your body will ultimately lead me to you.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes twinkled with a slight gleam.The ancestor of the Mountain Ghost Race was different from what Lin Jiufeng had expected.It was obviously at the Human God Realm. However, it wasn\u2019t as powerful as the average Human God. From the beginning till the end, it hid in the black fog without coming out. Its true body never appeared.Even when it was time for them to interrogate Lin Tianyuan, he used Lord Mountain Ghost as the proxy to do it. Considering all of these, Lin Jiufeng guessed that this so-called ancestor was definitely an old monster that had lived for many centuries.With its departure, the black palace also disappeared.Lin Jiufeng and Lin Tianyuan\u2019s Divine Souls returned to the Empress\u2019s Palace.\u2026In the Empress\u2019s Palace, Lin Jiufeng took his hand off Lin Tianyuan\u2019s forehead.He sat at the side and pondered on his own silently.The Empress watched quietly from a distance.She still couldn\u2019t see Lin Jiufeng\u2019s appearance.Although the brilliance that covered his body was already nowhere to be seen, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s appearance itself seemed to be like a mirage in the ocean, just looking at him alone was confusing to the eyes.Lin Tianyuan finally woke up.The weakened Lin Tianyuan had been tortured in his dreams. As a result, his body became so fragile that he couldn\u2019t even get up.The Empress hurriedly went to support Lin Tianyuan up.Lin Jiufeng looked at Lin Tianyuan and slowly said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to be anxious to get up.\u201d\u201cYour body has lost a lot of its energy this time. You suffered a lot in your dreams. The other party wants you to release the members of the Mountain Ghost Race, and he was serious in his threat.\u201d\u201cUncle, I\u2019m still so useless. To think that I cannot even resist the urge to sleep,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said bitterly.\u201cIt\u2019s okay\u2026\u201d\u201cConcubine Ming should\u2019ve taken your blood and hair and gave it to the Mountain Ghost Race.\u201d\u201cThe secret technique they used is very difficult to guard against.\u201d\u201cTonight, you\u2019ve suffered a great loss, but if you rest your body well in the future and make up for the loss, living for another 40 years won\u2019t be a problem,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said softly.The disaster this time had severed Lin Tianyuan\u2019s path of cultivation. It also broke his thoughts of breaking through to the Martial Sage realm. However, in the future, as long as he took care of his body properly, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to live for another 40 years.By that time, he would also be an old man in his seventies.It could be considered that he had lived a fulfilling life by then.Lin Tianyuan smiled bitterly and said, \u201cSo this is actually related to Concubine Ming? But I only have myself to blame for this, I can\u2019t blame anyone else. I even have to trouble Uncle to help clean my mess up. I\u2019m useless\u2026\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at him calmly and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve been by my side since you were five until you ascended to the throne when you were 15. I watched you grow up. You\u2019ve been very obedient all these years\u2026\u201d\u201cAlthough you were occasionally rebellious, you\u2019re still the best successor for your father. He didn\u2019t choose the wrong person, and I didn\u2019t choose the wrong person too.\u201dLin Tianyuan smiled and said softly, \u201cTo be able to gain Uncle\u2019s praise, then all my efforts over the years haven\u2019t been in vain.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going back now. You don\u2019t have to worry about the Mountain Ghost Race\u2019s old ancestor anymore. He destroyed your cultivation base and your body, I will make him pay the price for this.\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes turned slightly cold.\u201cThank you, Uncle.\u201dLin Tianyuan insisted on trying to stand up to send Lin Jiufeng off, but he couldn\u2019t stand up at all.In the end, the Empress sent Lin Jiufeng out of the palace on behalf of Lin Tianyuan.Lin Jiufeng soared into the sky and disappeared.The Empress returned to the hall in a daze.She looked at Lin Tianyuan and asked uncertainly, \u201cThat person just now is your Uncle?\u201dLin Tianyuan nodded and patted the edge of his bed, signaling the Empress to sit down.She sat down obediently.\u201cMy Empress, I have let you down all these years.\u201d Lin Tianyuan sighed.\u201cYour Majesty, what are you saying? I married Your Majesty when I was 16 years old. I\u2019m only in my thirties this year, and I\u2019m already the mother of the God Dynasty. I control the imperial harem and have bestowed glory upon my family for the next 10 generations. You didn\u2019t let me down on anything.\u201d The Empress grabbed Lin Tianyuan\u2019s large hand and said gently.Lin Tianyuan looked at the smiling Queen and he held her hand tightly with a bitter smile on his face.No words were necessary, they both understood.Thinking about it carefully, Lin Tianyuan knew how much of a bastard he used to be.Fortunately, God gave him another 40 years to live.\u201cMy Empress\u2026 That person just now is the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s guardian and also my uncle,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said softly.He told the Empress his most important secret.In the entire Yuhua God Dynasty\u2026 No\u2014in the entire world, only two people knew Lin Jiufeng\u2019s identity.One was Emperor Ming, Lin Tianyuan.The other was Dachun.Dachun was a simple and honest person. He knew that Lin Jiufeng was very powerful, and he vaguely guessed that Lin Jiufeng was the Human God that everyone referred to as the expert living in seclusion within the Imperial Capital\u2026But he definitely didn\u2019t know as much as Lin Tianyuan.Lin Tianyuan was the one who knew Lin Jiufeng\u2019s \u2018entire background\u2019.After all, they had lived together for 10 years.This was his greatest trump card.In the past, he didn\u2019t dare to tell anyone.But today, he took the initiative to tell the Empress about it.His heart had completely accepted the Empress\u2019s presence.\u201cUncle?\u201d The Empress looked at Lin Tianyuan in surprise. \u201cYour biological uncle?\u201dLin Tianyuan nodded and revealed a faint smile.He was very proud. \u201cIf we weren\u2019t biologically related, who would help me like this? How could he bother to scold me whenever I make a mistake and help me correct my ways?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been married to Your Majesty for more than ten years, and I\u2019ve seen all of Your Majesty\u2019s relatives before.\u201d The Empress thought carefully but she was still confused.\u201cThink about it carefully,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said with a smile.The Empress thought carefully.A frown appeared on her beautiful face.\u201cYour Majesty, I\u2019ve thought about all the relatives of the royal family throughout these years, but I still don\u2019t know his identity. Just tell me,\u201d the Queen said coquettishly.\u201cI wonder if you remember about my Grandpa Emperor choosing the Crown Prince?\u201dLin Tianyuan asked.\u201cI know\u2026\u201d\u201cFather Emperor suppressed a group of princes back then and was chosen as the Crown Prince.\u201d The Empress nodded.\u201cThen, do you know that there was another Crown Prince before my father?\u201dLin Tianyuan asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I was just born at that time. I was only a child.\u201d The Empress shook her head.Lin Tianyuan couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Time truly was heartless.It had completely wiped out all traces of the former dethroned prince, Lin Jiufeng.If even the Empress didn\u2019t know, then who else among the common people still knew about him?\u201cBefore my father became the Crown Prince\u2014the Crown Prince was my uncle\u2014my biological uncle. He was born to the same mother as my father.\u201d\u201cIt was only because he made a huge mistake back then that he was stripped off his title as the Crown Prince and banished to the Cold Palace. It was then that my father became the Crown Prince and ascended to the throne.\u201dLin Tianyuan explained slowly.Light flashed through the Empress\u2019s eyes when she heard his words.She was truly surprised.\u201cMy Empress. You must remember this. In the future, if I am no longer around and you encountered something very difficult that will bring danger to the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2026\u201d\u201cGo to the entrance of the Cold Palace and beg Uncle to help. This is the trump card that I have prepared for you and my son,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said solemnly.\u201cI will remember!\u201d The Empress nodded solemnly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Of course, she told her that she was the only one who could possibly know about all of these.Seeing how Lin Tianyuan emphasized secrecy regarding this matter, the Empress agreed.\u2026After leaving the palace, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t immediately return to the Cold Palace.He sensed that his sword energy wasn\u2019t actually that far from the Imperial Capital.\u201cIt\u2019s actually so close to the Imperial Capital. No wonder Lin Tianyuan caught so many mountain ghosts in the past few days. It turns out that their base camp is located nearby,\u201d Lin Jiufeng muttered.He hurried over with his sword energy serving as his guide.After breaking through to the Human God Realm, his speed became incredibly fast.The ancestor of the Mountain Ghost Race had created a base on a mountain just outside the Imperial Capital.There were a lot of shrubs and vines on the mountain, making it difficult for ordinary people to traverse the vicinity.But Lin Jiufeng directly flew over and landed in front of a tall mountain.Looking up at the skies, it was already dawn.The next morning had arrived.Lin Jiufeng looked at the mountain.What greeted his eyes was the sight of rugged mountains stacked side to side.\u201cThis seems to be an array formation!\u201d Lin Jiufeng mumbled.He finally understood why even though most of the mountain ghosts were so close to the Imperial Capital, no one hadn\u2019t discovered their base camp yet.It turned out that they had used an array formation to ward against the prying eyes of outsiders.Looking at the array formation, Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but frown.He didn\u2019t know much about array formations.Lin Jiufeng only knew one thing.If one was strong enough, everything else wasn\u2019t a problem!Could this array formation withstand a strike from him?So, what if it could?What about two strikes?Three strikes?\u2026Lin Jiufeng\u2019s understanding of array formations was so superficial that it would make people laugh if he told others about it.But he had no other choice.\u201cThat ancestor of the Mountain Ghost Race is hiding here.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely something wrong with him. He was struck by my sword and he can\u2019t even get rid of the sword energy. He\u2019s abnormally weak,\u201d Lin Jiufeng muttered.[Do you want to Sign-In at the Mountain Ghost Race\u2019s base camp?]Just as Lin Jiufeng was about to use his power to destroy the array formation, a line of words appeared before his eyes.Lin Jiufeng was surprised. \u201cIt\u2019s already the morning of the next day, so I can Sign-in again\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, I\u2019ll sign in.\u201d[Sign-In successful. Received Encyclopedia of Array Formations!]As expected, signing-in in front of an array formation meant that he would probably receive something related to array formations.Rumble!An entire book on array formations appeared.It was thick and it obviously contained a lot of corresponding knowledge.All of it was injected into Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind, causing him to close his eyes for a while.This vast knowledge allowed Lin Jiufeng to understand the secrets of array formations.In Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes, the array formation set up by the Mountain Ghost Race wasn\u2019t that difficult to traverse through.He followed the correct path and walked deep into the mountain without letting the array formation notice his intrusion.There were many tombs here.Each tomb had a mountain ghost living in it.Some of the graves were empty, which meant that the mountain ghosts inside had gone out.But some were covered up tightly, which meant that something was inside.Counting carefully, there were thousands of graves.These were all members of the Mountain Ghost Race.Among them, more than a thousand mountain ghosts were caught by Lin Tianyuan.It was no wonder that Lord Mountain Ghost and his old ancestor had become so anxious to deal with him.\u201cThe population of the Mountain Ghost Race isn\u2019t that huge\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already considered decent to have someone as powerful as the Lord Mountain Ghost and an even an old ancestor among their ranks. It\u2019s just a pity that they are too ambitious.\u201d Lin Jiufeng watched silently.Lord Mountain Ghost was the leader of this generation of mountain ghosts.He was a Martial Sage.But a man who could never be satisfied was akin to a snake trying to swallow an elephant. He underestimated the Yuhua God Dynasty too much and also overestimated the capabilities of his old ancestor.Lin Jiufeng quickly discovered that ancestor\u2019s coffin.It wasn\u2019t inside the largest tomb. It was just a coffin suspended on a cliff.Lin Jiufeng could sense that his sword energy was inside.With a flick of his finger, a streak of sword energy burst forth and the coffin directly exploded.Boom!There was nothing inside of it.But a faint black smoke slowly dissipated into the air.\u201cReally? You died just from this sword energy?\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.The faint dissipating black smoke was the ancestor of the Mountain Ghost Race.A Human God Realm ancestor from 1,500 years ago.Looking at his surroundings, Lin Jiufeng was rather bored. \u201cYou\u2019ve persevered for 1,500 years, but you didn\u2019t think about nurturing more talents in your race in preparation for the new era, yet you were actually so brazen to think of controlling a God Dynasty\u2026\u201d\u201cIndeed\u2026 It makes sense that your race was almost wiped out back then.\u201dLin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but complain.With Lord Mountain Ghost as the leader along with an old ancestor with no foresight, how could the Mountain Ghost Race remain in existence?Lin Jiufeng personally witnessed the Divine Soul of the ancestor of the Mountain Ghost Race dissipate into the air.From the beginning till the end, no words were exchanged.The shield that the old ancestor had condensed back then truly wasn\u2019t that strong after all.Considering how this old ancestor was already akin to that of an arrow at the end of its flight, it was understandable.But Lord Mountain Ghost had no idea about this. He thought that since they were both in the Human God Realm, his ancestor would definitely be able to suppress Lin Jiufeng due to their difference in battle experience.Lin Jiufeng was rather bored.His biggest gain from this trip was the Sign-In for the Encyclopedia of Array Formations.He directly left this place and returned to the Cold Palace to properly study this Encyclopedia of Array Formations.The disturbance caused by the Mountain Ghost Race came to an end.The clans from the old era caused a huge commotion in the Yuhua God Dynasty and didn\u2019t even try to adapt to the new era. They acted according to their old ideals and as a result, they were annihilated.\u2026After Lin Jiufeng made his move this time, he didn\u2019t have to go out anymore.The Cold Palace was as quiet as ever. No one came to disturb him and the white cat.Whenever Lin Tianyuan encountered a problem, his first thought was to solve it by himself.He preferred to not disturb Lin Jiufeng\u2019s peace if the problem was something he could handle.Another year passed.This year, Lin Jiufeng was 50 years old.The 50-year-old Lin Jiufeng had the appearance of a 20-year-old, calmness of a 50-year-old, intelligence of an 800-year-old ancestor, and the aura of a 3000-year-old sage.He was currently digging up the treasures of the human body, which was the goal of the Immortal Treasury stage of the Human God Realm.Other than this, Lin Jiufeng had also revised the entire Encyclopedia of Array Formations in the year that had passed.He finally knew all the basic array formations in the world like they were the back of his hand.The Encyclopedia of Array Formations also had another name\u2014the Encyclopedia of Basic Array Formations!He lived a serene life throughout the previous year.The Yuhua God Dynasty also remained relatively calm.Every cultivator in the world was quietly accumulating their strength\u2014all of them wanted to reach the Human God Realm.But someone among them remained unhappy.Great Yan Dynasty, Temple of the Holy Maiden.Throughout the previous year, the Holy Maiden had been preoccupied with her own matters.Her features looked as picturesque as ever\u2026Her black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall as she stood tall.\u2018Throughout the previous year, I sealed a few regions with my Human God Realm cultivation base. I finally have some free time to myself since I\u2019m already done with all of these\u2026\u2019The Holy Maiden let out a long breath.She still had a problem that she had to deal with.It was her incomplete Divine Soul.\u201cThe reason why my Divine Soul isn\u2019t complete is that when I was captured by the Yuhua God Dynasty, the Crown Prince secretly helped and released me.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the Crown Prince of an opposing dynasty, but he still released me, the Holy Maiden of their enemy\u2026\u201d\u201cHe must have encountered a lot of difficulties in the aftermath of what he had done.\u2019\u201cThis is why my Divine Soul is incomplete!\u201d\u201cI harmed a Crown Prince which is equivalent to me owing him my life!\u201d\u201cI can only hope that you\u2019re still alive\u2026\u201d\u201cI can repay you this gratitude. I can give you whatever you want. But if you\u2019re already dead, it will be impossible for my Divine Soul to become complete in this lifetime\u2026\u201dThe Holy Maiden was helpless.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Miss HongThe Holy Maiden wanted to make her soul complete once more.First, she needed to know if Lin Jiufeng was still alive30 years have passed since Lin Jiufeng saved her back then.The young Lin Jiufeng back then should be an old man in his fifties by now.\u201cHis cultivation was destroyed and he was banished to the Cold Palace. Decades have passed since then, could he still be alive?\u201d The Holy Maiden was distressed.\u201cI shall send someone to the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty to investigate. I hope that you are still alive. I can make it up to you. The throne, countless beauties, or even the ability to walk on the path of cultivation once more\u2026\u201d\u201cI can give them to you.\u201d The Holy Maiden picked up a piece of paper.After folding it a few times, an immortal crane appeared.\u201cGo to that famous daoist mountain and find two Daoist priests. Ask them to go to the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty to investigate that matter concerning the dethroned Crown Prince 30 years ago.\u201d The Holy Maiden waved her hand, and the paper crane flew up.It flapped its wings and flew away.The Holy Maiden watched quietly. She suddenly thought of something and frowned slightly. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, the first native person to break through to the Human God Realm is in the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d\u201cWhat if those two Daoist priests fail because of that Human God?\u201dShe picked up another piece of paper and folded it into yet again another paper crane. When she was done, the immortal crane flew to the Buddhist sects in the Jiangnan area.\u201cTwo groups of people should be enough, right?\u201d The Holy Maiden muttered.But thinking about it carefully\u2026\u2018What if both groups got into conflict with that Human God?\u2019\u201cLet\u2019s get a triple insurance policy.\u201dThe Holy Maiden folded another crane that flew toward the Northern Desert region.The Holy Maiden was being cautious here with so many back-ups up her sleeve.\u201cThis should be enough.\u201d\u201cI shall quietly wait for their results. I hope that they will bring me good news.\u201dThe Holy Maiden closed her eyes in satisfaction\u2026And started to repair her Divine Soul.\u2026The world of Daoism consisted of many sects.But there were only a few publicly recognized top daoists sects.Each sect occupied a famous mountain or river.They focused on cultivating the Dao, sitting in meditation, and watching the clouds rise and fall.They quietly observed the changes in the world.Among them, Mount Longhu of the daoist sects was considered to be a holy land of Daoism.The foundation of Mount Longhu ran deep. Following that rain, many Martial Sages appeared continuously in here like bamboo shoots after a spring rain.Two of the bamboo shoots quickly grew into towering trees.Two Human Gods appeared on Mount Longhu, one of the sacred lands of Daoism.If news of their ascension got out, it would definitely shock the world.However, these two Human Gods were currently holding a paper crane and listening seriously to what the paper crane was saying.\u201cIt\u2019s Miss Hong\u2019s voice,\u201d a young Daoist priest said excitedly.\u201cI thought that after we parted ways in the underground abyss, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see the fairy-like Miss Hong anymore. I didn\u2019t expect that she would actually take the initiative to contact us,\u201d the young Daoist priest said excitedly.The middle-aged Daoist priest by the side also nodded. \u201cThe two of us were only able to break through to the Human God Realm thanks to Miss Hong\u2019s pointers. Although she looks like an aloof person, that is only on the surface. The real Miss Hong is very kind.\u201dThe two Daoist priests were already old, but ever since they broke through to the Human God Realm and regained their youth, their mentalities also changed along with their appearance.With their age and experiences, not a lot in this world could excite them anymore.But Miss Hong was an exception.\u201cSenior Brother Liu Yun, do you still remember that scene when we saw Miss Hong a year ago?\u201d The young Daoist priest recalled.\u201cOf course, I remember\u2026\u201d\u201cThere was an earthquake that split the earth that day and it revealed the entrance to an underground abyss. Countless demons and monsters were inside of it. Fortunately, that place was near Mount Longhu. We were at the fourth stage of the Martial Sage Realm and we were the ones to suppress that crack.\u201d The middle-aged Daoist priest named Liu Yun, lamented.\u201cI still remember that Senior Brother and I were full of confidence before we went in. But we couldn\u2019t last for more than half a day in that place before we were completely defeated.\u201d\u201cThen, at a crucial moment, Miss Hong descended from the sky. She was so beautiful to the point that I still find it hard to describe her beauty. She immediately got rid of the trouble and suppressed that crack on her own.\u201d\u201cShe also helped treat our injuries. In addition, she even gave us pointers which helped us tremendously when we made our breakthrough to the Human God Realm!\u201dThe young Daoist priest brimmed with excitement.With a trace of longing, he recalled the past.They were only able to make a breakthrough because of Miss Hong.\u201cJunior Brother Haiyu, we owe Miss Hong our lives and the favor of guiding us. This time, Miss Hong wants us to go to the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty to investigate the situation of the dethroned Crown Prince 30 years ago. We must go,\u201d Liu Yun said.\u201cOf course we have to go. Even if the first Human God is in the Imperial Capital, we still have to go there and investigate.\u201d Junior Brother Haiyu nodded.\u201cWe aren\u2019t going to make any trouble. We are just investigating the situation of that dethroned Crown Prince back then. It should be fine. The Yuhua God Dynasty probably doesn\u2019t want to offend two Human Gods like us anyway,\u201d Liu Yun said.\u201cWe have to go now, we can\u2019t let Miss Hong wait for our results for too long.\u201d Haiyu couldn\u2019t wait any longer.He immediately left the mountain and headed in the direction of the Imperial Capital.Liu Yun shook his head and laughed. He also got up and went down the mountain.\u2026The buddhist sects of Jiangnan once had a temple every three steps and a monastery every five steps.But after the two paintings suppressed the two Buddhist sects back then, they were demolished.The three sacred lands of the Buddhist sects were still around, but the number of believers in the buddhist sects had sharply declined.They were no longer as glorious as they were back then.Both Shaolin Temple and Xuankong Temple had become part of the background that depicted the might of that Human God from the Yuhua God Dynasty into the world.They were furious, but they knew that they temporarily couldn\u2019t do anything about it.As for the Dalin Temple that was spared from the catastrophe and didn\u2019t suffer any losses back then, it remained unscathed as it maintained its low-key appearance.In the buddhist cave of Dalin Temple, there were many exquisite paintings.An old monk was sitting upright in front of a painting.In front of him was a flower. He held it with one hand and a smile appeared on his face.The smile of Buddha as he was plucking flowers!The old monk quickly turned young, transforming from an old man into a young man.\u201cI have no way of repaying your kindness, Miss Hong.\u201d The young monk sighed.Three months ago, under the guidance of Miss Hong, he successfully broke through to the Human God Realm.A paper crane was flying in circles around him.The monk took the paper crane in his hand and put it up to his ear.He then heard Miss Hong\u2019s voice.After a while, the monk who had listened to it several times raised his head and looked in the direction of the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201cI shall go visit the most prosperous place in the world today.\u201dThe young and handsome monk smiled.\u2026In the Northern Desert region, the earth was dry and the sun was scorching.A dark-skinned man held a paper crane in his hand as he carefully placed it up to his ear to listen.With his height of more than two meters, he held the little paper crane in his hands and listened attentively.His action looked just like a little woman. It looked out of place and awkward.But he was very happy\u2026\u201cMiss Hong actually took the initiative to send me a message! This is a huge matter, I have to do my best for Miss Hong.\u201d\u201cYuhua God Dynasty, the Imperial Capital, the dethroned crown prince\u2026\u201d\u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m going.\u201d\u201cThe only thing that I need to worry about in the Imperial Capital is that first Human God. But I\u2019m not going to make any trouble. I\u2019m just going to look for information. This Human God probably isn\u2019t so domineering,\u201d Iron Han mumbled.Then, he took big strides and ran faster than the wind.Lin Jiufeng\u2014who was deep in the Imperial Capital\u2019s Cold Palace\u2014had no idea that four Human Gods were coming to the Imperial Capital to investigate his situation.He was quietly signing in, cultivating, improving himself, and refining the Immortal Treasury in his body.\u201cWhy am I still unable to make a breakthrough from the Immortal Treasury stage?\u201dLin Jiufeng was puzzled.He couldn\u2019t help but ask the white cat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: A Person Forgotten by the Imperial CapitalLin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation base was still at the Immortal Treasury stage of the Human God RealmHe was trying his best to unlock the treasures hidden within his body.But no matter how diligent he was, he felt as if his body was akin to that of a bottomless abyss.No matter what he did, something seemed amiss. As a result, he couldn\u2019t help but ask the white cat as to why he couldn\u2019t make a breakthrough into the next stage of the Human God Realm.The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng speechlessly.It moved its claws and wrote a few words.After so many years, its words were still as ugly as ever, but Lin Jiufeng had gotten used to it already.To be honest, he was starting to think that its penmanship was somewhat adorable.\u201cYou\u2019re already a Human God expert, why are you still asking me this?\u201dLin Jiufeng was suddenly enlightened. \u201cAh!\u201d\u201cTo think that I forgot that your cultivation base is still not at the Human God Realm! My bad, it\u2019s my mistake. I won\u2019t ask you anymore.\u201dThe white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng. It was ashamed and furious at the same time.It felt that Lin Jiufeng was intentionally humiliating it.His words didn\u2019t sound malicious, but their underlying meaning was shameful for the white cat.It wasn\u2019t slacking. It worked very hard.In fact, the white cat was already at the peak of the Martial Sage Realm.Unfortunately, it encountered a bottleneck while it was a single step away from the Human God Realm.The bottleneck that it had encountered was the reason why it was ridiculed by Lin Jiufeng.Meow!The white cat reached out its claws, wanting to scratch Lin Jiufeng.But Lin Jiufeng turned around and left it behind directly.\u201cI\u2019m going to try and comprehend the essence of the Immortal Treasury stage\u2026\u201d\u201cGuard the door well.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s serious, yet seemingly casual manner of speaking further infuriated the white cat.It gestured with its claws while staring at Lin Jiufeng\u2019s back.Its sharp nails had already emerged from its meaty claws.It was angry.\u2026Lin Jiufeng\u2019s life this year consisted of his usual continuous signing in. Sometimes, he would purposely provoke and tease the white cat, adding a bit of fun to his peaceful life.Of course, the most important thing for him was to thoroughly comprehend the essence of the Immortal Treasury stage.There were many treasures within the Immortal Treasury stage.Physical Body Immortal Treasury, Divine Soul Immortal Treasury, True Qi Immortal Treasury, Daoist Charm Immortal Treasury.These were the four great immortal secrets that Lin Jiufeng comprehended within the Immortal Treasury stage of the Human God Realm.He had already unlocked the Physical Body Immortal Treasury.As a reward for his comprehension, his body\u2019s foundation was further solidified and strengthened. He could now kill someone of the same cultivation realm as him with only a single punch.Just this single immortal treasury alone increased his strength exponentially.For the Divine Soul Immortal Treasury, Lin Jiufeng cultivated the Innate Soul Refining Technique and refined his Divine Soul into an avatar of himself.The True Qi Immortal Treasury had revealed a secret door within one\u2019s True Qi.From beyond that door was a world filled with ancient True Qi runes. With his comprehension of the True Qi Immortal Treasury, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s every move now reflected those resplendent ancient True Qi runes.The Daoist Charm Immortal Treasury allowed Lin Jiufeng to look at the very essence of the world itself. He could now reach out and feel the pulse of the Great Dao. His heartbeat was now synchronized with the breathing of the earth itself as he walked on the ground.The four great immortal treasures increased Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strength by a hundredfold.He really felt that he could destroy this world if he wanted to.This feeling came along with his increase in strength.But despite all of these he still couldn\u2019t make a breakthrough away from the Immortal Treasury stage.\u2018What exactly is wrong?\u2019 Lin Jiufeng wondered.\u2018I\u2019ve read through the few books that described the Immortal Treasury stage of the Human God Realm. However, what they have described seems to be vastly different than mine\u2026\u2019\u2018In those books, the Immortal Treasury stage seems to be a simple stage to surpass.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng frowned.Opening the four great immortal treasures allowed his strength to continuously rise. Under such circumstances, he naturally wanted to break through the Immortal Treasury stage to enter the next small stage of the Human God Realm.\u201cI want to reach the peak of the Human God Realm as soon as possible. I want to see what\u2019s beyond it,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said with a look of longing on his face.With his cultivation base, he might not be invincible in the mortal world, but he was still a top expert.Lin Jiufeng had no interest in power and authority.Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t interested in reputation either.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t bother with seeking beautiful women too.He was only interested in one thing\u2014the peak of the martial path.\u201cI have a hunch that the Human God Realm is definitely not the highest cultivation realm. It\u2019s just that any information concerning the realms beyond it seemed to have been erased. No one knows about it. Apart from a few mentions in those ancient books, there is nothing else\u2026\u2019His motivation for reaching the peak of the Human God Realm was not that complicated.He simply wanted to find out what was beyond it.\u2018After I successfully conquered this great mountain known as the Human God Realm, the world in the future would definitely become even more vast and wonderful,\u2019 Lin Jiufeng said with desire flickering within his eyes.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s desire and ambition were laid bare. His priority was to continue accumulating his strength, so he could surpass the Human God Realm as soon as possible.\u2026Imperial Capital.Early in the morning, a young monk arrived.At noon, two Daoist priests arrived.In the evening, a man with a towering physique arrived.The three of them arrived at the Imperial Capital on the same day. They didn\u2019t do anything out of line, but each of them did something in common\u2014they all went to look for an information broker.The young monk found an old man in the Imperial Capital.The old man was only 20 years old back then.He was a person who witnessed that piece of history.But for some reason, the old man and the others that the young monk visited all shook their heads in confusion. They all said that they didn\u2019t know anything about a so-called dethroned Crown Prince from decades ago.Of course, after asking so many people, there was bound to be someone that knew about the dethroned Crown Prince. But as for what exactly happened? After 30 years, he had long forgotten about it.Someone even said, \u201cThe current Emperor\u2019s lineage is doing so well, why should we still bother about that dethroned Crown Prince? Since he has been deposed, he must have done something bad. Why do we have to remember him?\u201dThe monk was speechless.Unable to answer, he could only look for more people to ask from.But the people in the Imperial Capital really didn\u2019t truly remember the dethroned Crown Prince.The two Daoist priests, the towering man from the Northern Desert region, all found the same results as the young monk.The people of the Imperial Capital had completely forgotten about the dethroned Crown Prince, Lin Jiufeng.After a busy afternoon, the three groups ate in three different restaurants in the evening.If one looked at their locations from above, one could see that they had coincidentally formed a perfect triangle that surrounded the Imperial Capital.But despite being this close to each other, they didn\u2019t discover each other\u2019s presence at all.They were afraid of causing a misunderstanding between them and that Human God Realm expert within the Imperial Capital. Therefore, they chose to restrain their terrifying cultivation base.The monk ate vegetarian food, the Daoist priests drank tea, while that towering man ate meat in large chunks and drank wine in large cups.They were all depressed.The variety of food that they were eating vastly differed from each other, but their feelings were the same\u2014they felt helpless.\u201cThe Imperial Capital is so huge, yet no one even remembers about that dethroned Crown Prince? Isn\u2019t that Crown Prince too low-key?\u201d The monk complained.\u201cMost people in this Imperial Capital don\u2019t know of any dethroned Crown Prince. They only know about Emperor Ming and Emperor Yuan. Perhaps we need to dig deeper into this piece of history.\u201d The two Daoist priests discussed.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about the Imperial Capital, but since I want to investigate what happened decades ago, I can ask the servants in the palace. Some of the servants who were in charge of some duties in the past have already returned to their hometowns to retire\u2026\u201d\u201cThey must know something about it\u2026\u201dAlthough this towering man had a boorish appearance, he was meticulous.He immediately thought of a solution to his conundrum.The young monk also thought of a solution.\u201cI can go to the Royal Family\u2019s clan residence and look through their dossiers. Even if that prince was stripped of his position, he should still be recorded within the dossiers of the Royal Family\u2019s clan residence. With that, I\u2019ll know if he\u2019s dead or alive.\u201dThe two Daoist priests went to look for a former prince who was now a lord with his own land and riches.This former prince fought with Lin Jiufeng for the title of Crown Prince back then and failed.Then, failed again his struggle with Emperor Yuan for the title of Crown Prince.After two setbacks, he was disheartened and decided to let go of everything.He became an idle lord and spent his day walking with the birds and having fun.He was now living a carefree life.The two Daoist priests came to visit him at night and revealed their identities.This caused the idle lord to turn pale with fright as he hurriedly welcomed them.He was just an idle lord, how could he offend someone from the sacred grounds of Daoism, Mount Longhu?\u201cDaoist priests\u2026 May I know why you are looking for me?\u201d The idle lord asked cautiously.He hoped that it wasn\u2019t because they wanted to rebel and they needed his help.He didn\u2019t want to rebel at all.He was now used to his lifestyle of being an idle and wealthy lord.\u201cWe\u2019re here to find out more about that dethroned Crown Prince from back then,\u201d Daoist Liu Yun replied.The idle lord heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately, his worst fear didn\u2019t come true.But he was stunned hearing Daoist Liu Yun\u2019s words.\u201cYou want to ask me about my third brother, Lin Jiufeng?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Forcing the Cherry Blossoms to Bloom All Over the TreeBack then, this idle lord was young, high-spirited, and confident.He had always coveted that throne.Hence, he regarded Lin Jiufeng as his enemy.He had never called Lin Jiufeng, \u2018Third Brother\u2019 before.He was the eldest out of all the princes, and he was also the direct son of the Emperor.Logically speaking, he should have inherited the throne.But the young Lin Jiufeng was a genius.The former suppressed him and took the title of the Crown Prince from him.Later on, Lin Jiufeng made a mistake and released the opposing dynasty\u2019s Holy Maiden.As a result, he took advantage of the opportunity to add insult to injury. He rallied the ministers to remove Lin Jiufeng from the position of Crown Prince.He thought that the now empty position of Crown Prince was already in his bag, but when Emperor Yuan returned, the latter also suppressed him.It was as if history was repeating itself\u2026Emperor Yuan took the position away from him.The two blows had thoroughly demoralized him.In the end, he became an idle lord and abandoned his ambitions.All these years, he didn\u2019t mention Lin Jiufeng even once, nor did he think of him that much.30 years had passed, and he was already in his fifties.He was already more than 50 years old, and the past had long been buried in the deep recesses of his mind.But right now, he was baffled.Why were these two Daoist priests looking for Lin Jiufeng?Liu Yun and Hai Yu looked at the idle lord who was lost in his memories.They reached out and shook him awake.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that I haven\u2019t heard of his name in a long time. Back then, Lin Jiufeng was banished to the Cold Palace. Until now, he has never been released,\u201d The idle Lord said.Liu Yun asked, \u201cThen, is he still alive?\u201d\u201cHe should still be alive. If he\u2019s dead, the clan residence should inform us of his death, which means that he\u2019s still alive in the Cold Palace.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that the conditions in the Cold Palace are tough. His cultivation base was destroyed back then. I wonder what kind of torture he had experienced over the past few decades inside that place.\u201dThe idle lord sighed.The grudges he felt in the early years had already disappeared.There wasn\u2019t much brotherhood between them, but he pitied Lin Jiufeng\u2019s predicament.\u201cAfter he made that mistake, I knew it would be difficult for him to turn the tides in his life. He\u2019s only bitterly waiting for his death in that Cold Palace, I bet. Why are the two esteemed Daoist priests looking for him?\u201d The idle lord asked curiously.\u201cIs his situation in that Cold Palace really that tragic?\u201d Junior Brother Haiyu asked in surprise.\u201cThose admitted into the Cold Palace so far had never lived a long life\u2026\u201d\u201cThey all lost their minds.\u201d\u201cThink about it, he has been staying there for about 30 years now and that is equivalent to being continuously tortured for 30 years. Isn\u2019t that tragic?\u201d The idle lord shook his head and explained.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty tragic.\u201d Junior Brother Haiyu couldn\u2019t help but imagine.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s situation was horrible.\u201cWhere is that Cold Palace located?\u201d Liu Yun asked.The idle lord replied, \u201cIn a remote area in the West District of the Imperial Capital, there are a number of palaces with no one living in them. That\u2019s precisely the Cold Palace. No one is allowed to enter its premises without an imperial decree.\u201dLiu Yun and Junior Brother Haiyu immediately got up to leave.\u201cJust pretend that we were never here.\u201d Liu Yun left behind a pill that he had refined through alchemy on Mount Longhu as his expression of gratitude to the idle lord.Then, they disappeared into the night.\u2026The towering man from the Northern Desert region found an old eunuch who served in the palace back then. Because of his advanced age, he was allowed to retire and return to his hometown.From this old eunuch, he learned where the dethroned Crown Prince was imprisoned.Before he left, the old eunuch told him. \u201cEven if the dethroned Crown Prince from back then isn\u2019t dead yet, he should have already gone mad. It\u2019s okay if you want to find him, but don\u2019t make any trouble. The mistake he has made back then has yet to be forgiven.\u201dThe towering man frowned. He couldn\u2019t help but whisper to himself, \u2018Why did Miss Hong want to find this old and crazy dethroned Crown Prince?\u2019He couldn\u2019t figure it out.But since Miss Hong had given her orders, he had to complete the task.Taking advantage of the night, he went to the Cold Palace.\u2026Clan Residence, Dossier Room.The young monk flipped through the records of the past and saw the records regarding Lin Jiufeng.There was a brief summary of his existence.Every comment written about him on the records was negativeThe dossier directly gave Lin Jiufeng the title of a lecherous prince.The young monk closed the dossier and looked in the direction of the Cold Palace.He said, \u201cAmitabha. I hope you are okay. This way, I will be able to repay Miss Hong\u2019s favor.\u201dHe also went to the Cold Palace.\u2026Tonight, the Cold Palace was as quiet as ever.Almost every building within the Cold Palace had no lights.Even the occasional light was also because of the moon.But tonight, the moon was covered by dark clouds.Hence, the Cold Palace was very dark.There was only one place with light. It was Lin Jiufeng\u2019s courtyard.The courtyard was filled with bone swords. The set of bone swords that he received from signing in back then were still here. They remained inserted here for 30 years.Lin Jiufeng had never used all of them before.But Lin Jiufeng was in no hurry. It would come in handy sooner or later.Inside a pavilion, Lin Jiufeng laid on the frost jade bed. His hands were placed on his chest as he closed his eyes and circulated the surging spiritual energy that entered his body.His True Qi was currently producing ancient runes in his body.They entered his dantian and his dantian itself was starting to experience a few changes.Lin Jiufeng combined the ancient True Qi runes with his own cultivation technique to create something new.Dantian talismans!Each talisman contained a cultivation technique\u2019s essence.Together with the ancient True Qi runes, the power it could harness was terrifying.Lin Jiufeng was quietly accumulating his strength, preparing to amaze everyone outside.A white cat was curled up on one side of the frost jade bed. It cultivated comfortably on its own.The flickering candlelight illuminated their shadows and plastered them on the wall.The white cat\u2019s shadow was lying on Lin Jiufeng\u2019s chest. It looked adorable.Tonight should have been the same as usual.An ordinary night.But Lin Jiufeng suddenly opened his eyes and frowned.He sat up.Meow!The white cat was awakened by Lin Jiufeng\u2019s movement.It opened its eyes and looked at him in confusion.Lin Jiufeng said softly, \u201cSomeone\u2019s here.\u201dMeow ~The white cat also stood up and looked outside curiously.No one should be here in this Cold Palace.Even if someone did come, was there a need for them to be afraid?\u201cIt\u2019s four Human Gods!\u201dLin Jiufeng scanned with his Divine Soul and he instantly saw through their cultivation realms.Meow!!!The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng in shock.A breeze appeared beneath its feet and it was about to slip into the underground palace.\u201cWhy are you running? There are only four of them.\u201d Lin Jiufeng snapped.The white cat wrote decisively. \u201cYou are just one Human God, there are four of them.\u201d\u201cThey must have found out who you are. Now, they are here to get rid of you so that they could destroy the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d A scheme suddenly popped up in the white cat\u2019s mind.Lin Jiufeng watched as the white cat\u2019s claws moved like a shadow.In a few seconds, it wrote a lot of words.Looking at the content of these words, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.\u201cIf it\u2019s a competition of numbers, then there should be no one who can defeat the Emperor with his forces.\u201d Lin Jiufeng chuckled. He raised a hand and flicked his finger.The white cat watched without blinking.It wanted to see if Lin Jiufeng\u2014who boasted all day long about how powerful he was\u2014would be able to win against the four Human Gods.With a flick of his finger, a stream of True Qi burst forth.It directly poured over the space outside.Boom!The True Qi he had released was very thin, but after leaving Lin Jiufeng\u2019s courtyard.It was like pouring a basin of cold water into a pot of hot oil.It instantly surged with power.Carrying the essence of the True Qi Immortal Treasury that Lin Jiufeng had unlocked, it directly ignited the spiritual energy in the air within the Cold Palace.In Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes, the spiritual energy in the air became akin to resplendent lights as it directly covered everything around him.The cherry trees in the Cold Palace directly bloomed after being infused with this volatile spiritual energy. The fragrance of its flowers was refreshing.But for the monk, the Daoist priests, and the towering man\u2026It was as if the sky itself had collapsed onto them.Just as they entered the Cold Palace, they saw a lone courtyard with lights.Like moths attracted to a flame, they walked over in its direction.With a common goal in mind, it was inevitable that they would discover each other\u2019s presence.But since they had no idea that there were other groups venturing into the Cold Palace, all three of them were momentarily stunned.At this moment, a streak of ancient True Qi flew out from the lone courtyard with lights.Boom!It disturbed the spiritual energy in the air upon its arrival.Then, it directly ignited the night sky as the cherry trees around them bloomed.The pressure was akin to that of a boundless ocean.It caused the cherry blossoms to bloom all over the cherry trees, while at the same time, it forced the four Human Gods to kneel, preventing them from moving.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Who Is Miss Hong?The young monk knelt on the ground, drenched in sweat.Beads of sweat constantly dripped down from his forehead.He looked around in shock.The spiritual energy in the air had been ignited by something. It affected the cherry tree and forced it to blossom instantly. Resplendent and beautiful cherry blossoms fluttered in the air.Then, the world shook as a stream of True Qi transformed into a terrifying ancient rune that came crashing down.The four Human Gods couldn\u2019t resist at all.They directly knelt in front of the courtyard.They didn\u2019t even manage to enter the lone courtyard.\u201cWhat\u2026 What is this?\u201d The young monk was filled with indescribable shock.The two Daoist priests looked at each other and saw the horror in each other\u2019s eyes. The sensation was akin to that of a horror that engraved itself onto one\u2019s bones and onto one\u2019s heart. Both of them instantly saw through each other\u2019s thoughts.\u201cTrue Qi Immortal Treasury!\u201d Liu Yun gnashed his teeth as he endured the boundless pressure.But despite all of that, his voice sounded hoarse as it was forced out from his throat.As a Daoist, he naturally recognized the origins of that ancient rune.Only Human Gods that had broken through to the second stage\u2014the Immortal Treasury stage could possibly form this ancient rune.\u201cThere\u2019s actually someone here who has unlocked their True Qi Immortal Treasury. How incredible. He can now make a breakthrough into the next stage.\u201d Liu Yun gulped in fear.He realized that he had offended an extremely terrifying expert by invading the Cold Palace.\u201cThe True Qi Immortal Treasury? When unlocked, a cultivator\u2019s True Qi will now depict the resplendent ancient runes beyond the door of his True Qi. That\u2019s terrifying. The expert who suppressed us is someone that is at the Immortal Treasury stage at the least!\u201dJunior Brother Haiyu added. Similar to Liu Yun, he was trembling in fear.When the young monk heard his words, his expression changed.\u201cThat Human God of the Yuhua God Dynasty is actually living in seclusion in the Cold Palace?\u201dThe young monk realized in horror. A bitter smile spread on his lips.He truly had knocked against a metal plate this time.The veins on the towering man\u2019s body bulged.He struggled with all his might, but it was to no avail. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t break free from the suppression of the ancient True Qi runes.\u201cSenior, please spare my life.\u201dThe towering man knew that he couldn\u2019t do anything about the situation.He directly laid on the ground and didn\u2019t resist anymore, then he shouted.He begged for mercy.The young monk and the Daoist priests did the same.They knelt on the ground and begged for mercy.Being suppressed by ancient True Qi runes might be painful, but it was nothing compared to their lives. Thus, they started begging. Asking for mercy might save their lives.In the courtyard, on the frost jade bed, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t care about the four Human Gods outside.Within the lone courtyard, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t care about the four Human Gods outside.They were being suppressed by a single wisp of his True Qi.Obviously, these four were newly-minted Human God Realm cultivators.If this happened ten years ago, Lin Jiufeng would\u2019ve been worried. But now, a flick of his finger was enough to suppress them all.He looked at the white cat.\u201cNow, do you understand that I\u2019m not just bragging about what I usually tell you?\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.The white cat was speechless. It was both envious and furious.Envious of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s formidable strength.Furious at Lin Jiufeng for bullying it again.But the problem was that it couldn\u2019t refute him at all.\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go out and find out why these Human Gods are here.\u201d Lin Jiufeng reached out and brought the white cat into his arms. Then, he started stroking it gently.He was stroking the white cat!The white cat was a proud cat. It usually wouldn\u2019t let Lin Jiufeng hold it so casually like this.But its guess was wrong this time. Unable to refute Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words, it had no other choice but to allow Lin Jiufeng to do whatever he wanted to.Lin Jiufeng\u2014who was carrying the white cat\u2014walked out of the lone courtyard\u2019s door.Lin Jiufeng was dressed in a long white suit with patterns carved on its surface which accentuated his slender figure.He walked out of the courtyard.Outside the courtyard, four people were lying on the ground.A young monk.A man with a towering physique.And two Daoist priests.They were all at the Human God Realm.All four of them had just recently reached the Human God Realm.Lin Jiufeng walked out with steady footsteps.Seeing them kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy, he waved his hand casually.The ancient True Qi rune suppressing them slowly dissipated.The boundless pressure disappeared.The few of them heaved a sigh of relief and gasped for breath.They hurriedly lifted their heads and looked at Lin Jiufeng.\u201cSenior, your look great.\u201d Liu Yun praised when he saw Lin Jiufeng looking like an Immortal that had descended onto the mortal realm.\u201cSenior, we didn\u2019t mean to offend you. We really didn\u2019t know that you were living in seclusion here. Please pardon us if we have offended you in any way.\u201d The young monk ignored his own sweat and hurriedly explained.The towering man\u2019s body was more than two meters tall.His dark exterior made him look very domineering.But at this moment, he was like a child who had done something bad.He stood obediently at the side and looked at Lin Jiufeng, aggrieved.\u201cSenior, I was wrong.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at them and said calmly, \u201cIf apologizing is useful, what use is our True Qi?\u201dThe faces of the four stiffened.They became nervous, thinking that Lin Jiufeng was going to attack them.But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t make a move.He only sized up the four of them and asked, \u201cYou guys are in the same group?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cDefinitely not.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a loner.\u201dThe four of them shook their heads in unison and decisively distanced themselves from each other. They didn\u2019t want to be seen as working together.Lin Jiufeng looked at them. The young monk was alone, the towering man was alone, and the two Daoist priests were together.Despite having intruded into the Cold Palace at the same time, they were on guard against each other.It was an interesting sight for Lin Jiufeng.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cIf you guys aren\u2019t in the same group, then why did you all came here on the same day and time?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence!\u201d The monk said, embarrassed.\u201cFate.\u201d The two Daoist priests smiled awkwardly.\u201cI don\u2019t know why they are here, but I have my own motives,\u201d The iron-tower-like man said.\u201cOh, then tell me, what is your motive?\u201dLin Jiufeng stroked the white cat as he curiously asked.He still didn\u2019t know what exactly could make these Human Gods come at the same time on the same day to this Cold Palace.The young monk and the Daoist priest also looked curiously at the towering man.They also wanted to know.\u201cI\u2019m here to find someone,\u201d The towering man said.\u201cFind someone?\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised his brows and looked at him in surprise.\u201cThere\u2019s no other person in this Cold Palace, yet you are here to look for someone?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.\u201cI\u2019m here to look for the dethroned Crown Prince,\u201d The towering man was honest. \u201cI heard that the dethroned Crown Prince was imprisoned here 30 years ago. I came here to investigate his whereabouts.\u201d\u201cFind the dethroned Crown Prince\u2026\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes darkened.He wanted to ask more, but at this moment, the young monk said, \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m also here to look for someone.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at him and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re also looking for the dethroned Crown Prince?\u201dThe young monk nodded.Lin Jiufeng immediately looked at the two Daoist priests and asked, \u201cAre you two also here to look for the dethroned Crown Prince?\u201dLiu Yun and the Haiyu brothers hurriedly nodded.Lin Jiufeng smiled.His smile seemed to be that of joy.\u201cThe dethroned Crown Prince was imprisoned 30 years ago, and no outsider has ever come to look for him. You guys came together tonight and said that you weren\u2019t in the same group, but all of you were looking for him.The four of them awkwardly looked at each other.In such a situation, it didn\u2019t seem to make sense to say that they weren\u2019t on the same side.\u201cWhy look for the dethroned Crown Prince?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked solemnly.Someone was looking for him.That person even got four Human Gods to come here just to look for him.He had to take this matter seriously.\u201cI\u2019m under someone else\u2019s command!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m following orders!\u201d\u201cSomeone wanted me to do it.\u201dThree different answers, but they meant the same.Someone had ordered them to come here.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s face turned slightly cold.He stared at them and asked, \u201cWho told you lot to come here?\u201dThe four of them answered in unison. \u201cMiss Hong!\u201dLin Jiufeng frowned. Who was this Miss Hong?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In his memory, ever since he transmigrated into this world, he had never interacted with any woman.The only female he interacted with was a white cat.Where did this Miss Hong come from?The white cat was also very curious.It raised its head and looked around in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s arms.Its curiosity skyrocketed.The single Lin Jiufeng was actually in a relationship?Lin Jiufeng looked solemnly at the four people in front of him.He wanted to know the answer to this question of his.\u201cMiss Hong is just Miss Hong,\u201d the young monk said.\u201cMiss Hong is a celestial maiden who stands aloof in this world. She\u2019s very powerful.\u201d When the towering man described Miss Hong, his tanned face actually turned red.\u201cMiss Hong is an extraordinary woman,\u201d Daoist Liu Yun said.\u201cMiss Hong is my greatest hero.\u201d Junior Brother Haiyu added.The four of them praised this Miss Hong non-stop.In addition, there was clear genuine admiration and even longing in their eyes.Countless question marks instantly appeared in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind.Just how charming was this Miss Hong?\u201cSo you guys only know that her name is Miss Hong?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.The four nodded.\u201cYou don\u2019t know her background?\u201d Lin Jiufeng continued to ask.The four of them nodded again.\u201cYou guys don\u2019t know her identity either?\u201d Lin Jiufeng was speechless.The four continued to nod.This time, Lin Jiufeng stopped asking. He was becoming exhausted.\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about her at all, but this so-called Miss Hong was able to command you to come here and investigate the dethroned Crown Prince?\u201d Lin Jiufeng was speechless.\u201cI owe Miss Hong a favor. Under her guidance, I broke through to the Human God Realm,\u201d The young monk said.\u201cIt\u2019s the same for us two. With Miss Hong\u2019s guidance, we were able to reach the Human God Realm.\u201d Daoist Liu Yun added.\u201cMe too,\u201d The towering man mumbled.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s exhaustion vanished in an instant. He looked at the four Human Gods.\u2018To be able to guide someone into breaking through to the Human God Realm, that person must be very powerful. Furthermore, if it\u2019s just a casual pointer and they managed to make a breakthrough into the Human God Realm\u2026\u2019\u2018I am unable to do that myself.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng pondered in his heart.It would be easy for him to kill a Human God.But guiding others into making a breakthrough for the Human God Realm was a different story.Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t do it.This Miss Hong must be very powerful.At the very least, she must be incredibly familiar with the intricacies of the Human God Realm.\u201cDescribe to me your encounter with Miss Hong in detail. We\u2019ll start with you.\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked at the young monk and permitted him to speak.\u201cA year ago, the demon\u2019s den behind the Buddha Mountain of the Dalin Temple split open. A group of demons was about to wreak havoc and endanger the world, but Miss Hong suddenly appeared and used her powerful strength to suppress the demon\u2019s den. She left a seal on the den and gave me pointers for two hours. I broke through to the Human God Realm due to her guidance, and I have never seen Miss Hong since then,\u201d The young monk said.\u201cA demon\u2019s den?\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.\u201cIt\u2019s an ancient ruin buried deep in Mount Daqing\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Dalin Temple chose to establish a monastery on Mount Daqing to suppress this demon\u2019s den and prevent the demons inside from coming out to harm the world. This is our duty,\u201d the young monk said sincerely.Lin Jiufeng looked at the young monk and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your Dharma name?\u201d\u201cQingyun,\u201d the young monk said.\u201cMonk Qingyun, since that is a demon\u2019s den of your Dalin Temple, how did Miss Hong know about it?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know. I also asked Miss Hong about this, but she only smiled and didn\u2019t explain.\u201d Monk Qingyun shook his head.\u201cWhat about you two?\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked at the two Daoist brothers.\u201c11 months ago, an earthquake occurred deep underground in the Longhu Mountain Range.\u201d\u201cThe ground split open and an entrance to an underground abyss appeared.\u201d\u201cCountless demons were about to escape from that underground abyss\u2026\u201d\u201cAt that time, we wanted to suppress them, but we weren\u2019t strong enough. At the crucial moment, Miss Hong descended from the sky and helped us eliminate the demons. She also sealed the entrance to the abyss.\u201d Daoist Liu Yun explained.Lin Jiufeng frowned.Dalin Temple had a demon\u2019s den, and Mount Longhu had an underground abyss.Both of these places had these oddities.\u2018Could it be that\u2026\u2019Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but look at the towering man.\u201cWhat\u2019s about you?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.The young monk and the Daoist priests also looked over, intrigued.They also wanted to know if this towering man met Miss Hong in a similar situation as them.\u201cI wasn\u2019t in a demon\u2019s den nor an underground abyss. But I found a mummy within the boundless desert of the Northern Desert region. Unfortunately, that mummy suddenly woke up and it wanted to kill me to siphon my energy.\u201d\u201cThat was when Miss Hong appeared\u2014she suppressed the mummy and saved my life. Then, she also gave me pointers to aid me in my breakthrough into the Human God Realm. This is why I owe her a debt of gratitude.\u201d\u201cShe asked me to pay the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty a visit to investigate the situation and whereabouts of the dethroned Crown Prince. This is the reason why I am here.\u201d The towering man explained.\u2018A demon\u2019s den, an underground abyss, and a mummy.\u2019Lin Jiufeng looked at the four people and frowned in thought.Since that rain fell, Lin Jiufeng knew that the world was going to change. He wasn\u2019t that surprised hearing about their experiences.But the problem was that in their stories, Miss Hong was present.Moreover, the Dalin Temple was in the Jiangnan area, Mount Longhu was in the Qinling area, and the towering man was from the Northern Desert region.From the south to the north, from the Jiangnan area to the vast northern desert, the entire trip would take thousands of miles.But this Miss Hong could actually appear on time in these locations despite their distance from each other? What exactly was her background?\u201cSenior, we\u2019ve told you the truth. We came to the Cold Palace this time because we really just wanted to find out more about the dethroned Crown Prince. We have to make a report to Miss Hong to repay the debt of gratitude that we owe her,\u201d Monk Qingyun said sincerely.\u201cSenior, the young monk is right. We have no intention of offending the Yuhua God Dynasty, nor do we have any intention of offending you. We just want to know the current situation of that dethroned Crown Prince.\u201d Daoist Liu Yun added.\u201cSenior, please tell us about the situation of the dethroned Crown Prince of the Cold Palace so that we can immediately leave and report to Miss Hong.\u201d The towering man pleaded.Lin Jiufeng looked at them.He reached out to caress the white cat.These four people didn\u2019t know that the immortal-like Lin Jiufeng in front of them was that dethroned Crown Prince.Lin Jiufeng believed their words.There was no need for them to lie.His identity as the dethroned Crown Prince had no value at all, so why should they lie?But the problem was\u2014just what exactly was the intention of this Miss Hong?After pondering for a moment, Lin Jiufeng said, \u201cThe dethroned Crown Prince is in the Cold Palace, but he doesn\u2019t want anyone to disturb him. Go back and tell this Miss Hong that the dethroned Crown Prince\u2019s life is very simple and peaceful. There is no need to disturb him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll let you guys go this time, but it might not be the case next time.\u201dLin Jiufeng let them go in the end.They were just four Human Gods, he could kill them with a flick of his finger.It was better if he let them return and report to Miss Hong.This way, she would not bother about him anymore.The four Human Gods left the Cold Palace in a hurry, their hearts filled with fear.Once they were through the door, they glanced at the dilapidated palace behind them.It was as if they saw a ferocious beast with its mouth wide open, waiting for them to venture beyond the door.\u201cLet\u2019s go back and report to Miss Hong.\u201d The four shook their heads and smiled at each other.It could be considered that fate allowed them to be gathered by Miss Hong together.The four of them bade each other farewell and left the Imperial Capital under the cover of the night.In the Cold Palace\u2026Lin Jiufeng hugged the white cat and remained motionless beneath a cherry tree.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What can we change by killing them?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your relationship with this Miss Hong?\u201d The white cat wrote curiously.\u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d Lin Jiufeng thought about it carefully, but he still had no idea about who this Miss Hong was.The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng suspiciously. It didn\u2019t believe him.The white cat continued to write.\u201cWhy did she get four Human Gods to come here and find you then?\u201d\u201cIt is probably because she likes and admires me,\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied with a rather serious look on his face.\u201cShameless!\u201d The white cat wrote down this word and jumped away.Lin Jiufeng looked at its shadow. He didn\u2019t say anything, but he wiped off the word with his foot.Under the cherry blossom tree, Lin Jiufeng raised his head and fell into deep thought as he looked at the blossoming trees.Lin Jiufeng had no idea where this Miss Hong came from. He released the four Human Gods because he wanted to tell her not to disturb the dethroned Crown Prince\u2019s life.As for Miss Hong\u2019s identity, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want to know.He just wanted to sign in quietly within the Cold Palace.\u2026After the four Human Gods left the Imperial Capital, they all heaved a sigh of relief.They felt that lady luck had favored them today because that senior spared their lives.The young monk, the Daoist priests, and the man from the Northern Desert region all took out their paper cranes as they described what had happened in its entirety.They let the paper cranes bring this information to Miss Hong.They failed, not because they weren\u2019t working hard, but the other party was simply too powerful.A stream of True Qi caused cherry blossoms to bloom all over the cherry trees.It also made them unable to move. What was the point of fighting against someone like that?The gap between them was so huge that the arrogance these four people had after they ascended to the Human God Realm instantly vanished.They discovered that not just any Human God could suppress a buddhist sacred ground with a painting. It turned out that even among those in the Human God Realm, there was such a terrifying existence.They were like children compared to him.The four Human Gods suffered a huge blow.At the same time, they decided in their hearts that the Imperial capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty had one of the most terrifying existences in the world.At the same time, they decided in their hearts that considering that the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty housed one of the most terrifying experts in the world\u2014they agreed in unison that it was a place that they must never casually visit!\u2026Great Yan Dynasty\u2026Temple of the Holy Maiden\u2026The Holy Maiden\u2014Miss Hong was cultivating in peace.All of a sudden, three paper cranes flew over to her.They passed through the layers of defense before arriving at the Temple of the Holy Maiden.The contemporary Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty\u2014Miss Hong\u2014opened her eyes.\u201cThey have news about the dethroned Crown Prince?\u201d The Holy Maiden looked at the paper cranes in surprise. She reached out and grabbed one of them.Then, she listened to the news depicted within the paper crane.Her surprise slowly disappeared.It was replaced with a frown on her face riddled with confusion.\u2018Is that Human God in the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty really that powerful?\u2019Miss Hong couldn\u2019t help but doubt.She opened the second paper crane and listened to the report inside of it.The information recorded was the same.He didn\u2019t encounter the dethroned Crown Prince. Instead, he encountered the Human God living in seclusion within the confines of the Imperial Capital.Then, he was suppressed with a flick of that Human God\u2019s finger.She listened to the third paper crane.It was exactly the same, this one had encountered that Human God too.\u201cIs that Human God really that powerful?\u201d Miss Hong mumbled in surprise once more.Although the rejuvenating rain had lasted for several years, only a few people managed to reach the Human God Realm. What was more terrifying was that this person was at the second stage of the Human God Realm.If what was described within the paper cranes was true, then that Human God possessed terrifying strength.The young monk, the towering man, and the two Daoist priests only managed to reach the Human God Realm after her guidance.But a Human God was still a Human God.She didn\u2019t expect them to fail so easily.\u2018Should I go there personally?\u2019 Miss Hong pondered.She carefully considered this idea.As long as she could help that dethroned Crown Prince, then her soul should be able to recover, right?\u201cI can help him sit on the throne again\u2026\u201d Miss Hong\u2019s eyes lit up.She decided to go to the Imperial Capital personally.But at this moment, a compass flew down from the center of the hall.The compass was four meters wide, and there were countless black spots emitting black smoke in the center of the compass.Upon closer inspection, the compass seemed to be representing the surface area of the entire continent.Miss Hong\u2019s expression changed.She walked closer to take a look and mumbled solemnly, \u201cThere are these strange movements again. They really want to break the barrier, eh? I need to suppress them and stall for enough time so that I can make a breakthrough into the next stage as soon as possible.\u201dThere was a sudden change in the situation.So many locations depicted on the map were showing problems. If she didn\u2019t go there and suppress these problems, her advantage in appearing early in this new epoch would vanish.\u201cIf only I didn\u2019t get injured back then with my essence damaged, I would already be very powerful by now. In addition, a Crown Prince with a bright future wouldn\u2019t even have to be implicated with my matters. My Divine Soul also wouldn\u2019t end up incomplete with the only way to let it recover is to repay my debt of gratitude to that Crown Prince,\u201d Miss Hong muttered angrily.She knew that she couldn\u2019t go to the Imperial Capital for the time being.She had to suppress the problems in these locations.\u2018I shall get someone to go to the Imperial Capital and give the dethroned Crown Prince some supplements so that he can live a long life. When I\u2019m done with these, I\u2019ll help him take his revenge.\u2019 Miss Hong decided.She picked up a paper crane and tossed it out.\u2026Just as he was about to leave the imperial capital and return to the Jiangnan area, Monk Qingyun once again received Miss Hong\u2019s paper crane.The paper crane brought with it a piece of information from Miss Hong.It asked Monk Qingyun to go and give the dethroned Crown Prince some supplements to restore the condition of his body to his prime and let him live a long life.The supplements were being carried by the same paper crane.There was a small space within the paper crane\u2014it contained various pills, godly medicines, and supplements.Monk Qingyun was helpless. He could only go to the Cold Palace again.Arriving at the door of the Cold Palace, he knocked respectfully.Standing under the cherry blossom tree, Lin Jiufeng frowned and said coldly, \u201cYou\u2019re here again? What do you want?\u201d\u201cSenior, I\u2019m here to deliver a gift to the dethroned Crown Prince,\u201d said Monk Qingyun.He didn\u2019t dare to hide anything at all and explained what Miss Hong had instructed him to do.Lin Jiufeng listened with a strange look on his face.Who exactly was this Miss Hong?Why was she so concerned about his health?And what supplement? Did he still have to make up for his deficiencies?Was there even a deficiency in the first place?!He was already extremely healthy!After a moment of silence, Lin Jiufeng said, \u201cPut the things down. You may leave.\u201dMonk Qingyun obeyed and decisively left.He wanted to return to Jiangnan.He didn\u2019t want to stay in the Imperial Capital for any second longer.This place was just too terrifying.After a while, a figure appeared in front of the Cold Palace.It was Lin Jiufeng.He picked up the supplements sent here by Monk Qingyun.\u201cSuch a heavy gift, who exactly is this Miss Hong?\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head, not knowing the other party\u2019s identity.Meow!The white cat jumped down and wrote a line of words.\u201cWhat exactly did you do to this Miss Hong?\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head in confusion.He didn\u2019t do anything, all right?Lin Jiufeng really wanted to say that to the white cat.For decades, he never had a female lead in his life, okay?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How annoying. I just can\u2019t remember.\u2019In the end, he gave up on trying to guess her identity.Since this Miss Hong clearly had her own motives, she would definitely appear once again. At that time, Lin Jiufeng would know who she was.\u201cMy top priority now is still to make a breakthrough into the next stage.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s body disappeared in front of the entrance to the Cold Palace.He resumed his routine of signing in quietly.He signed in every day.Miss Hong\u2019s subordinates didn\u2019t show up at the Cold Palace anymore.Miss Hong herself never appeared in front of Lin Jiufeng.It was as if this Miss Hong didn\u2019t even exist in the first place.Fortunately, Lin Jiufeng was never a curious person.If Miss Hong didn\u2019t appear, his life wouldn\u2019t change at all.He would continue to sign in, cultivating, and making breakthroughs in peace.On this day, Lin Jiufeng stood in front of the courtyard gate.His body stood long and straight.He wore a purple coat and when it was paired with the pink shade of the cherry tree, the scene seemed to be depicted in a painting that had come to life.Meow!The white cat stood on the courtyard wall and watched silently.Today, Lin Jiufeng was somewhat depressed.The white cat didn\u2019t know what happened.It calculated the time.It seemed that Lin Jiufeng would always be depressed on this specific day and month every year.Do men have some kind of mechanism that makes them depressed for a few days every year?The white cat jumped off the courtyard walls and came in front of Lin Jiufeng.It wrote and asked\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re always in a bad mood on this specific day and month every year. Why?\u201dLin Jiufeng glanced at the white cat.Then, he looked at the cherry tree.With his hands behind his back, he replied faintly, \u201cBecause today is my younger brother\u2019s death anniversary.\u201dThe white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng curiously.It wrote and asked curiously, \u201cYou actually have a younger brother?\u201dThe white cat had always thought that Lin Jiufeng was a loner.\u201cSilly cat, if I don\u2019t have a younger brother, why is Emperor Lin Tianyuan calling me Uncle then?\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied, speechless.The white cat looked vexed.It covered its eyes with its claws and cried at its own stupidity.\u201cHow long has your brother been dead?\u201d The white cat changed the subject, not wanting to embarrass itself.Lin Jiufeng pointed with his finger and said, \u201cThis cherry tree was planted in the courtyard when he passed away. Back then, it was just a sapling. But now, it\u2019s already so tall and strong.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked sad when he said all of these.In this world, other than the martial path that interested him\u2026There was someone else whom Lin Jiufeng held valuable in his heart.It was Emperor Yuan\u2014the Emperor Yuan who had always referred to him as, \u2018Big Brother\u2019.His understanding of Emperor Yuan was even better than Lin Tianyuan.After all, they were born an entire generation apart.Thus, they couldn\u2019t communicate with each other that well.It has been about a decade or two since Emperor Yuan died, Lin Jiufeng would usually be depressed every year on this specific day and month.But he could usually control his emotions.As long as he didn\u2019t think about it, it wouldn\u2019t hurt him.But today was different.When Lin Jiufeng saw this cherry tree, his thoughts instantly churned and he found it hard to suppress them.This cherry tree was just a sapling when it was planted back then.But today, he realized that it had already grown so big.It was then when it struck him\u2014his younger brother had already died many years ago.Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t in the mood to cultivate today.He turned around and left.Meow ~The white cat immediately called out.\u201cI\u2019m going to see my younger brother. Guard the Cold Palace well.\u201d Lin Jiufeng strode out.Meow!The white cat instead followed him closely behind.It leaped onto Lin Jiufeng\u2019s broad shoulders and curled up.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t mind and he brought the white cat with him to the Imperial Cemetery.The past Emperors of the Yuhua God Dynasty were buried here.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s father and Emperor Yuan were buried here too.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s father\u2019s tomb was huge and luxurious.It was built by Emperor Yuan for him back then.When it came to Emperor Yuan\u2019s own tomb, although it was also grand, it was really shabby compared to his father\u2019s tomb.Lin Jiufeng stood in front of Emperor Yuan\u2019s tomb.He looked at the various tombs surrounding Emperor Yuan, his thoughts running wild.\u201cI\u2019ve always been taking care of your son. He was a little reckless and made some mistakes, but I helped him correct them. However, it\u2019s a pity that his body can no longer live to a ripe old age.\u201dIn front of Emperor Yuan\u2019s tomb, Lin Jiufeng felt guilty.After all, Lin Tianyuan was the person that Emperor Yuan chose.As his uncle, Lin Jiufeng said that he would take care of him, but Lin Tianyuan only have about 40 years to live.\u201cYour reforms are basically completed. After Lin Tianyuan suffered through that previous setback, he finally knows how to properly manage the Yuhua God Dynasty. You don\u2019t have to worry anymore.\u201d\u201cToday, I noticed that the cherry tree that I planted the year you passed away is now towering and strong.\u201dLin Jiufeng was usually so focused on his cultivation that he didn\u2019t pay much attention to such things.\u201cYou\u2019ve been gone for almost 20 years now.\u201d Lin Jiufeng stood up straight.He looked at Emperor Yuan\u2019s tomb and sighed.As he reminisced, Lin Jiufeng talked a lot. He even helped Emperor Yuan clean up his tomb.Finally, he stood in front of the tombstone and bowed deeply.[Do you want to Sign-In before Emperor Yuan\u2019s tomb?]Lin Jiufeng was stunned.He could even Sign-In here?What kind of powerful and evil place was this?But Lin Jiufeng thought that he would be a fool not to sign in, so he still agreed.[Sign-In successful. Received Fate Changing Technique!]Lin Jiufeng was stunned when he saw this.\u201cWhat\u2019s this Fate Changing Technique?\u201d Lin Jiufeng thought, dumbfounded.Boom!A vast stream of information entered Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind. It was instantly absorbed by him.A minute later, Lin Jiufeng opened his eyes and looked at Emperor Yuan\u2019s tomb in surprise.[The Fate Changing Technique can change the life of a powerful cultivator into that of a weak cultivator, changing one\u2019s fate.]The introduction was simple, but it revealed a lot of information.\u201cCan I exchange someone else\u2019s life for a dead person\u2019s?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked excitedly.If it could be done, the Emperor Yuan that he had always missed could be resurrected.[Host has to figure it out on your own, this is not a simple matter!]Lin Jiufeng smiled. \u201cOf course, I know that it\u2019s not a simple matter, but it\u2019s fine. To let Emperor Yuan see the light of the day again, I will do my best.\u201dLin Jiufeng always felt that Emperor Yuan\u2019s death was a great pity.Now that there was a sliver of hope for his resurrection, he wanted to give it a try.[Forcefully changing one\u2019s fate will incur the wrath of the heavens!]Lin Jiufeng ignored this sentence.He knelt and reached out to wipe the dust on Emperor Yuan\u2019s tombstone. Then, he said firmly. \u201cYou wait here for your Big Brother. Big Brother will definitely let you wake up to this brilliant world once again, so you can see the new world after that rain.\u201dEmperor Yuan was very talented, comparable to the previous Lin Jiufeng.Once he was revived, he would definitely stand out in this brand new world.On the day of his resurrection, the Yuhua God Dynasty would no longer need his protection.With this thought in mind, Lin Jiufeng stood up.He turned around and walked away in large strides.He wanted to go back and make a breakthrough into the realm beyond the Human God Realm as soon as possible. He wanted to see for himself what lied beyond the unknown. At the same time, he also wanted to take a closer look at the Fate Changing Technique.It was absolutely impossible to revive someone who had been dead for almost 20 years without sufficient strength and capability.\u2018I want to surpass the Immortal Treasury stage!\u2019 Lin Jiufeng said firmly to himself.On the journey from the Imperial Cemetery to the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng walked firmly and continuously.Boom!As soon as he entered the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body trembled.He broke through and arrived at the next stage.He had accumulated and consolidated his cultivation base for so long to the point that the only detail that held him back was a certain regret in his heart. When this regret of his was resolved after this visit to the Imperial Cemetery\u2014he naturally broke through.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 62": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 62Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe naturally broke through the Immortal Treasury stage and entered the third stage of the Human God Realm.Ultimate Man!Upon reaching this stage, one would no longer have a mortal body.Hence, they would be an Ultimate Man.Lin Jiufeng returned to the Cold Palace.He didn\u2019t immediately study the intricacies of the Ultimate Man Realm.Instead, he studied the Fate Changing Technique in detail.In the courtyard filled with bone swords, Lin Jiufeng sat quietly as he pondered over a problem.Fate Changing Technique.Its name itself made it obvious that it was a heaven-defying technique.But heaven-defying techniques were often accompanied by fatal flaws.It was the same for the Fate Changing Technique.One could bolster the life of a mortal in exchange for the life of a super powerhouse.The difference between the two must be at least a hundredfold.Only then could the prerequisite for the use of the Fate Changing Technique be satisfied.Yes, this was only the prerequisite.The Fate Changing Technique also had a demanding requirement for the user.The user must have the ability to travel between the World of the Living and the Netherworld.The current Lin Jiufeng was unable to travel between the World of the Living and the Netherworld.\u2018It\u2019s extremely difficult to execute this Fate Changing Technique.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng sighed.He still had to become stronger and he also had to prepare a super powerhouse for Emperor Yuan. In addition, these were just the prerequisites. There were still other requirements or ingredients before the Fate Changing Technique could be utilized.\u2018Let\u2019s take it slow. In the endless years to come, I will continue to work hard by signing in and cultivating. There is still hope. There will be.\u2019Lin Jiufeng buried this conundrum into the deep recesses of his mind.But in the future, when he was more powerful than he was today, he would revisit this matter and change Emperor Yuan\u2019s fate.\u2026After making a breakthrough into the third stage of the Human God Realm\u2026Even Lin Jiufeng himself was starting to get scared of his own strength.He had unlocked the True Qi, Divine Soul, Physical Body, and Daoist Charm Immortal Treasuries while he was in the Immortal Treasury stage of the Human God Realm.According to the ancient records, a cultivator\u2019s strength would still be terrifying after arriving at the Ultimate Man stage despite having only opened a single Immortal Treasury in the Immortal Treasury stage.Compared to them, Lin Jiufeng had opened the four great immortal treasures.Obviously, his strength was already incomprehensible.In the Immortal Treasury stage, these opened Immortal Treasuries all had their own duties.They didn\u2019t interfere with each other nor interacted with each other.Therefore, no one knew how truly powerful they were.But now that he was in the Ultimate Man stage and had mastered all four of them\u2026He was able to stack them on top of each other.Now, whenever Lin Jiufeng used such a method to unleash his strength. The amplification to his power wasn\u2019t as simple as adding four 1s together with their sum representing his resulting might.Instead, they superimposed upon each other to infinity and beyond.Lin Jiufeng felt that every time he inhaled the air around him, he was becoming stronger.This feeling of becoming infinitely stronger made Lin Jiufeng raise his hand.He tapped the air in front of him out of curiosity.Dong!The void instantly collapsed like a mirror.In the very next moment, Lin Jiufeng reached out and repaired the hole in the void, restoring the place to its original state.\u201cHow terrifying!\u201d Witnessing such a scene, the white cat meowed in surprise.Lin Jiufeng looked at the white cat.He smiled slightly and said, \u201cYou\u2019re too weak. You have to make a breakthrough into the Human God Realm. Otherwise, it would be too easy for me to bully you.\u201dThe white cat nodded solemnly.Indeed, it was determined to make a breakthrough soon.It couldn\u2019t let the distance in strength between it and Lin Jiufeng become too far, could it?The white cat no longer said that it wanted to surpass Lin Jiufeng.It eventually realized that its wish was too unrealistic.Now, it only wanted its cultivation base to not be so distant from Lin Jiufeng\u2019s.Meow ~Suddenly, the white cat called out and began writing.\u201cIn the past few days, there have been some changes in the underground palace. Something seems to be manifesting in the depths of the Land of Extreme Negative Energy.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at the words written by the white cat and he immediately urged.\u201cBring me there. Let\u2019s take a look.\u201dThe white cat immediately brought Lin Jiufeng into the underground palace.This palace was originally discovered by the Chasing Corpse Sect and they treated it as their precious treasure. Unfortunately, after the death of two Martial Sages from the Chasing Corpse Sect, they no longer dared to approach it.The palace was moved here by the Demon Lord back then for some unknown reason.The palace was empty as ever.Lin Jiufeng hadn\u2019t come down for many years.This was the white cat\u2019s lone territory.But this time, it realized that something was amiss.As a result, it retreated and called Lin Jiufeng down to take a look.Walking down the passageway, Lin Jiufeng once again saw the palace.Lin Jiufeng immediately found out that the runes on the surface all over the palace\u2019s walls seemed to be a defensive array formation.With his knowledge in formations thanks to the Encyclopedia of Array Formations, he directly opened the array formation and stepped into the palace.The palace might be empty, but it was clean and tidy.The filth that surrounded the place when he last visited was nowhere to be seen.The white cat had obviously moved all the trash out and cleaned up the place.In the middle of the palace, a coffin could be seen.Lin Jiufeng came in.He looked around and asked, \u201cWhere is the abnormality that you said?\u201dThe white cat jumped onto the coffin.It pointed to the bottom of the coffin and began writing.\u201cIt\u2019s right under this coffin. Whenever night falls, a demonic aura seems to be coming out of it. I can hear people roaring, and sometimes when I fall asleep, I will have dreams of millions of demons crawling out of this coffin.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked down. The coffin was clean.He reached out and touched it.Then, he used his spiritual consciousness to scan the coffin.\u201cThere\u2019s actually a black hole beneath this coffin?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked in surprise.With a flick of his finger, a stream of True Qi burst forth.It slowly moved the coffin away.Click! Click! Click!The white cat watched curiously.When it moved halfway, the edge of the black hole could finally be seen.Boom!Boundless demonic energy surged out.It directly engulfed Lin Jiufeng and the white cat.Amidst the demonic energy were the wails and shrieks of countless demons.\u201cHahaha! It has been 1,500 years! I can finally see the light of day again!\u201d\u201cThat demon last time actually suppressed me for 1,500 years. He really deserves to die.\u201d\u201cWe could have become stronger in this world, but we were suppressed for 1,500 years instead!\u201d\u201cThe scent of this brand new world is so wonderful. I want to kill lots of people. I want to use their blood and life to comfort myself after being suppressed for so many years\u2026\u201dAll sorts of screams, hideous shrieks and angry roars sounded non-stop.The dense demonic energy scared the white cat so much that its hair stood on end.It curled its back and bared its teeth.Seeing this scene, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s face turned cold.He directly took a step forward.\u201cYou lot really behaved atrociously in front of the wrong person\u2026\u201dDong!Lin Jiufeng stepped down. In an instant, a boundless might and a thick Dao charm burst forth at once. The combination completely suppressed the demonic aura.The surging demonic energy was completely suppressed.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s clothes fluttered, his aura was unparalleled, and his eyes were cold.\u201cDon\u2019t run!\u201d Lin Jiufeng reached out and grabbed a demon in the black hole.Without caring whether the other party agreed or not, he directly grabbed and dragged him out.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s actually a powerhouse like you in this brand new world?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re already at the Human God Realm?\u201d\u201cHow is this possible?\u201dThis demon had a strange appearance.His neck was long and he had a head that looked like it would fall off from his shoulders at any moment.Right now, Lin Jiufeng was holding his head.His face turned red from the pressure as he looked at Lin Jiufeng in horror.\u201cTell me, where are you from?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cWe are demons from a demon\u2019s den.\u201d The demon felt terrible being held by the neck, but he didn\u2019t dare to struggle.Under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s powerful aura, he couldn\u2019t resist at all. Thus, he could only answer.Lin Jiufeng frowned and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s a demon\u2019s den? What\u2019s the brand new world? And what\u2019s your motive for coming here?\u201d\u201cA demon\u2019s den is just a demon\u2019s den. Ours existed since 8,000 years ago.\u201d\u201cThe words, \u2018brand new world\u2019 has a meaning\u2026\u201d\u201cIt means that every era has a cycle, from the beginning to its rise and then to its decline. This is considered the cycle of an era. But when the decline comes, a demon\u2019s den will close and wait for the next cycle.\u201d\u201cAnd now, it is the beginning of yet again another cycle. Naturally, the seal on our demon\u2019s den has been lifted and we are about to come out from it into the world.\u201d\u201cWe tried to come out 1,500 years ago, but the spiritual energy of the world had yet to recover at that time. A brand new world wasn\u2019t born yet. As a result, we were easily suppressed by a demonic cultivator.\u201d The demon spoke very fast and his words solved Lin Jiufeng\u2019s doubts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It has a cycle.Akin to that of a ball thrown into the air, the most powerful person should be born at the peak of the spiritual energy cycle. Then, upon its decline, the spiritual energy of the world would sharply decrease in quality. It would then become increasingly difficult for anyone to make a breakthrough in their cultivation.This represented the end of an era. Even if one had terrifying strength, they would still be unable to display it. They could only seal themselves up and wait for the next spiritual energy recovery which signaled the start of an era.A cycle represented the coming and the end of a life.A life for ordinary people was about a hundred years.A tree\u2019s life could last for thousands of years.Plantlife only lasted a single autumn.Different lives had their own different life cycles.This was how the world worked.Why was it that when Lin Jiufeng had only just arrived in this world, the most powerful person in the world was only a Great Grandmaster cultivator?It was impossible for people to find living Martial Sages at that time.Later on\u2014when the spiritual energy showed signs of recovery\u2014Martial Sages gradually appeared.But it was only when that rain fell did the world thoroughly changed.It was only after that rain did the people found out that a brand new world had arrived.The demons in their demon\u2019s den were all waiting for the right opportunity.Unfortunately, they were suppressed by the Demon Lord 1,500 years ago.The Demon Lord was one of the last Human Gods of the previous spiritual energy recovery cycle.Before he died, he discovered that the demons from the demon\u2019s dens would be coming out in the distant future.Although he was a demonic cultivator, the Demon Lord wasn\u2019t planning on colluding with them.He directly moved the palace that he had spent his entire life constructing at the center of a prosperous land that gradually became the Yuhua God Dynasty. Then, he also suppressed the exit of that demon\u2019s den. In fact, he even used his own copper coffin to suppress it.The Demon Lord sure was altruistic!Then, the Chasing Corpse Sect found the palace.They wanted to open it up and plunder its treasures.From the beginning till the end, the people of the Chasing Corpse Sect had no idea that there was an extremely terrifying demon\u2019s den beneath the palace itself.They studied the palace for a long time, but they still couldn\u2019t open its doors.As a result\u2014when the Chasing Corpse Sect was hunted by the people of the world\u2014they had no choice but to give up this Land of Extreme Negative Energy along with its treasures.After that, hundreds of years passed. The Yuhua God Dynasty was finally founded and they chose the surrounding area to be its Imperial Capital.The stories about the demon\u2019s den, the Demon Lord, and the Chasing Corpse Sect disappeared silently together with the Land of Extremely Negative Energy.In the end, the prince of the Yuhua God Dynasty was deceived into building a palace here.Then, lady luck abandoned him and he died of depression soon after.Afterwards, the place became the famous Cold Palace.No one even dared to come here by now.Lin Jiufeng mentally sorted out the origins of this Land of Extreme Negative Energy.\u2018At first, I was puzzled as to why a Land of Extreme Negative Energy was born here. Moreover, following that rain, the Land of Extreme Negative Energy was also refreshed for signing in. Who created such a place?\u2019\u2018I finally understand now. It\u2019s not the Yuhua God Dynasty, nor the Chasing Corpse Sect, nor is it the Demon Lord. The Land of Extremely Negative Energy was created by the people of the demon\u2019s den that the Demon Lord had sealed.\u2019\u2018They are the original owners of the Land of Extremely Negative Energy. It\u2019s just that they chose to seal themselves here after the end of an era. Then, as time passed, I became the owner of this place\u2026\u2019Lin Jiufeng murmured.The white cat anxiously wrote on the side.\u201cHelp me ask about the whereabouts of the Demon Lord.\u201dLin Jiufeng immediately asked the demon.The demon that was being held by the neck didn\u2019t dare to not answer.He replied almost immediately. \u201cI don\u2019t know. They all said that the Demon Lord is dead because he wanted to suppress our demon\u2019s den. Even in an era with poor spiritual energy, such endeavor was still a great danger to his life.\u201dThe white cat meowed and became depressed.It was still thinking about finding the Demon Lord if the latter was still alive.\u201cPowerful man, I\u2019ve answered everything and I\u2019ve been honest all this time\u2026\u201d\u201cCan you let me go?\u201d The demon begged in grievance.Back in his era, he had been an infamous demon.But as the era changed, these demons lost the ample support of the world\u2019s spiritual energy, so they sealed themselves underground and became trapped in this Land of Extreme Negative Energy, waiting for the arrival of a new era.Right now, after spending a long time without properly cultivating, their proficiency in their techniques and abilities had atrophied. Similar to those that spent a long time on their beds, their skills and abilities were currently unusable for them.\u2018When I was at my peak, it was easy for me to crush a Human God like you to death\u2026\u2019\u2018You are only able to strut around because I am suppressed and unable to absorb the spiritual energy of the world. Once I\u2019m free and can absorb spiritual energy again, I will definitely cut off your head as soon as I can.\u2019 The demon cursed in his heart.But on the outside, he was still very obedient.Lin Jiufeng pondered for a moment before asking, \u201cOther than your demon\u2019s den here, are there any other self-proclaimed factions?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s way too many\u2026\u201d\u201cOur demon\u2019s den is one of the 18 demonic sects of the previous era. The other 17 demonic sects had also sealed themselves. There are also some Daoist factions, Buddhist factions, rogue cultivators, hidden powerhouses, and so on\u2026\u201d\u201cThey have all sealed themselves and are waiting for the arrival of a new era,\u201d The demon said in a matter-of-factly way.\u201cIn other words, although this world looks like it is a brand new era with everyone standing on the same starting point on the surface, there are countless self-proclaimed powerhouses in private, waiting for the right time to appear?\u201d Lin Jiufeng pondered before asking.\u201cThat\u2019s right, so you\u2019d better let me go\u2026\u201d\u201cThis way, there will be no grudges between us.\u201d\u201cMove this coffin away, and we will overturn this palace. Then, our demon\u2019s den will be able to reappear in the world,\u201d the demon said excitedly, \u201cby that time, we will definitely satisfy you in whatever way you want.\u201dLin Jiufeng watched as the demon winked at him all the while promising all sorts of benefits.But Lin Jiufeng ended up shaking his head in indifference as he said, \u201cI have already understood what I wanted to understand. As for you, just stay in the demon\u2019s den and stay sealed there.\u201dLin Jiufeng directly hurled this demon into the demon\u2019s den.\u201cNo\u2026\u201dThe demon screamed.He instantly circulated his might.Surging with violent demonic energy, he charged out.It has been too long since he was sealed. He was already numb and tired. He didn\u2019t want to stay in the demon\u2019s den anymore.He wanted to see this brand new world.Dong!But under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s foot, the palace trembled a few times. Layers of talismans appeared at the entrance of the demon\u2019s den. They intersected with each other and formed a perfect sealing array formation.The demon directly collided with the sealing array formation.Blood flowed from its head as it fell into the endless abyss with a tragic cry.\u201cHuman, just you wait! I will definitely come out and kill you!\u201dThe demon shouted angrily, its voice echoed far and wide.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression was as calm as ever he replied, \u201cOn top of this den is my Cold Palace. If I let you guys out, wouldn\u2019t the Cold Palace that I\u2019ve lived in for 30 years be destroyed in your hands?\u201dHe still had to sign in at the Cold Palace, he couldn\u2019t let them destroy it.[Do you want to Sign-In before a demon\u2019s den?]Speaking of the devil\u2026Lin Jiufeng raised his brows at the timely arrival of the system prompt.But he didn\u2019t hesitate as he said decisively, \u201cSign in.\u201dIt was obvious that this was the first time that this demon\u2019s den had been exposed to the outside air. After all, the Demon Lord\u2019s coffin and the palace outside the coffin had been blocking this demon\u2019s den.There was also a lot of soil surrounding the entrance itself.It would be a miracle if anyone was able to discover it without deliberately looking for it.Lin Jiufeng judged that he would receive bountiful rewards for signing in before a place that was discovered for the first time after so many years.[Sign-In successful. Received Demon Suppression Record cultivation technique.][Sign-In can be repeated here. As long as you defeat different demons, you can sign in again.]Lin Jiufeng thought that signing in for a cultivation technique was already good enough.But who would have thought that it would be a place where he could sign in repeatedly?\u201cMonster Spawner?\u201dThis term appeared in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mind as he had played Minecraft in his previous life.In the eyes of others, this demon\u2019s den was an extremely dangerous place that could take anyone\u2019s life at any moment.But in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes, this was just a Monster Spawner.A Monster Spawner that he could use to indefinitely solo farm the demons within it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This Cold Palace really is full of treasures,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said happily.The white cat looked at the joyful Lin Jiufeng in confusion.\u201cThere\u2019s a demon\u2019s den deep underground, what do we do in the future?\u201dThe white cat wrote and asked.\u201cWe will live the same life as usual. The demon\u2019s den has already been sealed by me,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said casually.He wasn\u2019t afraid of this demon\u2019s den.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that these demons will rush out? They are powerful existences from the previous cycle of the world\u2019s spiritual energy!\u201d The white cat was worried.\u201cAlthough they were powerhouses back then, they chose to seal themselves in the end. As a result, they are deprived of the world\u2019s spiritual energy inside that demon\u2019s den. How could they possibly defeat me considering their circumstances?\u201d Lin Jiufeng explained.The cultivation bases of those demons could be stronger than his, but their bodies had already dried up and their proficiency in their techniques and abilities had long atrophied.Those demons were akin to a long river that has long dried up.How could they possibly be a match for Lin Jiufeng who was a lake on his own?The white cat seemed to be in deep thought.It seemed to have understood what Lin Jiufeng meant.\u201cYou want to suppress them forever?\u201d The white cat wrote and asked.The corner of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mouth curled up as he said, \u201cThat will depend on how much profit I can reap from them.\u201dThe white cat was confused. What was he saying?It was a cat, it couldn\u2019t understand Lin Jiufeng\u2019s vocabulary.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t explain, however, he brought the white cat out of the underground palace and completely sealed this place so no one could enter it without his permission.After exiting the underground palace, Lin Jiufeng started cultivating.He had just signed in and received the Demon Suppression Record.This was a very powerful demonic cultivation technique.When cultivated, it could suppress all other demonic and evil cultivation techniques.Lin Jiufeng had no reason not to cultivate it.After all, he could even use it to attack the demons in that demon\u2019s den.\u2026Lin Jiufeng was quietly cultivating the Demon Suppression Record in the Cold Palace, but Miss Hong was working very hard to suppress the places that showed signs of demons coming out.This time\u2014it was at the Heavenly Mountain\u2014a mountain far distant from where the Yuhua God Dynasty was located. There were many temples here that were established from the previous era.Every temple had a terrifying existence sealed inside.Miss Hong worked hard to suppress them.Suppressing the four temples that were showing prominent signs of breaking out took a heavy toll on Miss Hong\u2019s body. She couldn\u2019t help but bitterly smile as he stood on the summit of the Heavenly Mountain and looked at the world around her.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have woken up so early\u2026\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have to work so hard right now.\u201dMiss Hong\u2019s bitter smile deepened.When she woke up a few decades ago, she was the only living person from the previous era.\u201cThe people of this new era still need enough time to develop\u2026\u201d\u2018The final mission of the members of the Heavenly Dao Sect is to make the cultivators of this era stronger than ever before. At the very least, they have to be able to withstand those terrifying existences from the previous era.\u2019 Miss Hong muttered to herself.This was also why she took the initiative to give pointers to the Daoist priests, the young monk, and that towering man.It was all so that they could make a breakthrough into the Human God Realm.This was the mission of those from the Heavenly Dao Sect.It was also one of their principles in cultivation.There should have been a large group of people from the Heavenly Dao Sect suppressing these people from the previous era. But even though the new era had already arrived, she was still the only one who managed to wake up.What\u2019s worse was that she was even injured while she was still adjusting to her brand new life.The others were nowhere to be seen.Miss Hong had no other choice but to become the Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty.She then entered the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty to find more information about the others.But during that exploration, she failed and was captured.She was almost forced to confess her motives as she was continuously tortured.Luckily\u2014at that time\u2014someone gave up everything to save her.Miss Hong owed him her life.If she didn\u2019t return this favor to him, her Divine Soul would forever be incomplete.\u2018Back then, I went to the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty to find more information about the location of the 18 demonic sects\u2019 most powerful demon\u2019s den.\u2019 Miss Hong recalled.When she woke up, she found out that she was the only member of her sect that was awake.At that time, she felt deceived.Then, she became the Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty.She helped the Great Yan Dynasty improve in various fields.Eventually, she gained the unanimous love and respect of the dynasty\u2019s people.After stabilizing her identity as the Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty, she went to the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty.She thought that she would go quietly without anyone knowing. She wanted to find out where the most powerful demon\u2019s den of the 18 demonic sects was located. She wanted to see if the seal of that den was broken. If it wasn\u2019t, she planned on immediately strengthening that seal.Unfortunately, when she arrived at the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty, a prodigal young master took fancy to her because of her beauty. He wanted to bring her home forcefully.The plot after that was very simple and clich\u00e9d.Miss Hong taught the prodigal young master a lesson, but she also exposed her identity in the process. In an instant, she was surrounded by the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty and was arrested before being thrown into prison.Her idea of looking for that demon\u2019s den was destroyed before she could even do something.In the end, the previous Lin Jiufeng fell in love with her at first sight and released her from captivity.After Miss Hong expressed her gratitude to Lin Jiufeng, she took the opportunity to escape and returned to the Great Yan Dynasty to recuperate.As for that Lin Jiufeng\u2014he was sent to prison and his position as the Crown Prince was revoked.His body was now occupied by the current Lin Jiufeng.The story has become a loop.\u2018What a shame. I not only did not discover the whereabouts of that demon\u2019s den, but I also incurred a debt of gratitude to that person resulting in my Divine Soul being incomplete until I have repaid to him what he is owed\u2026\u201d\u201cMy cultivation speed has become very slow due to this. If not, I would\u2019ve already been on the next stage of this realm.\u2019 Miss Hong muttered to herself in regret.\u2018There\u2019s also that demon\u2019s den. That\u2019s the biggest hidden danger. There are more than 3,000 Great Demons in that demon\u2019s den, and there are even some terrifying Demon Gods. They were all outstanding talents from the previous era\u2026\u2019\u2018That demon\u2019s den is also famous as the place that every demonic cultivator in the world longed to visit the most. If they were to appear prematurely in this era, they will cause an avalanche of disasters\u2026\u2019\u2018The hard work that I\u2019ve put in for the past few years would also be rendered useless.\u2019A sense of crisis kept lingered in Miss Hong\u2019s heartThat demon\u2019s den was just too dangerous for her to ignore.She had to be on guard.\u201cThis won\u2019t do!\u201d\u201cI have to quickly suppress these places and return to the Great Yan Dynasty. I have to think of a way to compensate that dethroned Crown Prince and restore my Divine Soul to completion\u2026\u201d\u201cAt the same time, I also have to investigate where that demon\u2019s den is\u2014that place is just too dangerous for me to ignore.\u201d Miss Hong took a deep breath.Then, she flew away with a determined look in her eyes.As a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect, this was her mission.Even if she knew that she would die a horrible death, she had to suppress that demon\u2019s den.\u2026The demon\u2019s den that Miss Hong hailed as a very dangerous place had already appeared.It was right below Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng successfully cultivated the Demon Suppression Record on the first day.The next day, he went to the underground palace to open the seal on that demon\u2019s den.Rumble!The surging demonic aura that rushed over was extremely terrifying.It churned and boiled, wanting to rush out at the opportune moment.But Lin Jiufeng directly raised his hand and struck out with the Demon Suppression Record.Boom!In an instant, a black lotus appeared behind Lin Jiufeng.A black Buddha sat upright on the lotus, his hand forming a seal.Taking a closer look, the Buddha looked exactly like Lin Jiufeng.\u201cSuppress!\u201dWithout hesitation, Lin Jiufeng grabbed a demon and directly sent an attack.The Demon Suppression Record that was said to suppress all demonic and evil cultivation techniques in the world directly beat this demon into a pulp.The vast demonic energy was once again sealed by Lin Jiufeng.He signed in afterwards, satisfied.[Sign-In Successful. Received the Evil Spirit Immunity Body!]Lin Jiufeng looked at it in surprise.In the future\u2014even if he was very weak\u2014evil things and their miasmas wouldn\u2019t be able to invade his body anymore.\u201cAs expected, instead of a demon\u2019s den. It\u2019s fitting for this place to be called a \u2018Monster Spawner\u2019.\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked at the demon\u2019s den and laughed.Then, he turned around and left.He shall come back here tomorrow.If Miss Hong knew that the demon\u2019s den that she was very afraid of was rendered into such a state in front of Lin Jiufeng, she would definitely doubt the education that she had received since she was young.Was a demon\u2019s den of that caliber really that weak?Wasn\u2019t it said that there were more than 3,000 Great Demons in there?Wasn\u2019t the owner of that demon\u2019s den\u2014the number one faction among the 18 demonic sects\u2014the Demon\u2019s Way?And that if it appeared, it would definitely cause a pandemonium?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As a result, there were a lot of demons; there were even some Demon Gods that chose to seal themselves in this demon\u2019s den.The more powerful a person was, the more energy they would lose upon the end of an era.They had to fall into a deep sleep.Otherwise, when they ultimately woke up, even the act of breathing would consume the energy that they have painstakingly stored and conserved in their bodies.Hence, the majority of the Demon Gods and demons in the demon\u2019s den were in deep sleep.Only less than a dozen demons woke up 1,500 years ago.They estimated the time wrongly and were suppressed by the Demon Lord.Just like that, these dozen or so demons supported each other until now.Initially, they wanted to break the seal and absorb the spiritual energy of the new era to recover their former strength.But who would have thought that they would encounter Lin Jiufeng?Having waited for 1,500 years for nothing, they had long exhausted their energy.Their cultivation base was high, but they couldn\u2019t use it due to the lack of spiritual energy.Perhaps they could still defeat ordinary Human Gods, but they had no chance of winning against Lin Jiufeng.That was why for two days in a row\u2014Lin Jiufeng easily defeated the demons and continued to sign in as usual.The demons who woke up early were all but infuriated.They wanted nothing more than to fight it out with Lin Jiufeng.Many years ago, they were well-known powerhouses in the world.Although the times had changed, their pride remained unchanging.They were unwilling to admit defeat that easily.\u201cLet\u2019s attack him together tomorrow!\u201dThe dozen or so demons discussed their plans to deal with Lin Jiufeng.\u201cHow about we wake up a Demon God?\u201d Some demons were worried that they were still no match for Lin Jiufeng. They wanted to wake up a Demon God to help them.\u201cAre you stupid? Although the Demon Gods can defeat that ignorant and arrogant brat, they would also be able to absorb the renewed spiritual energy in the world. If that happens and they became even stronger in the new era, how can we hope to catch up to them?\u201dThe demon with a long neck snapped.He still had great ambitions in his heart\u2014it was to surpass the Demon Gods.The other demon thought about it too and they agreed with his sentiment. As long as they worked together to defeat Lin Jiufeng and got out to see the new world and absorbed the renewed spiritual energy in the air, they would also be able to become a Demon God.The dozen or so demons started to finalize their plans.The next day, Lin Jiufeng came early in the morning.He opened the seal.Rumble!All of a sudden, more than ten demons attacked at the same time.They completely released their auras, cultivation bases, and the remaining True Qi in their bodies.They clearly wanted to kill Lin Jiufeng in one move.Their auras were aggressive, surging with demonic energy, as they carried with them the determined cries of a dozen or so demons.These auras pounced towards Lin Jiufeng.Seeing this, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression remained calm, but his eyes narrowed.When these auras rushed in front of him, his huge Divine Soul spread out.Rumble!The demons were akin to that of a river\u2019s water crashing down from a waterfall, thinking that it was invincible.But in the very next moment, it suddenly encountered a tsunami that covered the skies.Then, that same tsunami came crashing over.It completely froze the surrounding space.Click! Click! Click!It was as if time itself had stopped. The demonic energy that these demons had unleashed froze in front of Lin Jiufeng.They remained suspended in the air, seemingly unable to move.The dozen or so demons widened their eyes in disbelief.This new era had just started, how could someone be so powerful already?Lin Jiufeng was too lazy to say anything.He directly punched a demon that he had never seen before in the face, causing him to become dizzy as that same demon immediately fell back into their demon\u2019s den.Boom!As this demon fell, the others were also pulled down together with him.Surrounded with the demonic energy that these demons mustered with all of their might, their figures became similar to that of a shooting star as they came crashing down onto the floor of their demon\u2019s den underneath the coffin.As for Lin Jiufeng, he simply sealed them once more.Then, he said with a smile. \u201cYou dozen or so shriveled demons want to deal with me?\u201d\u201cDream on!\u201dWith his continuous routine of signing in every day, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strength continued to grow stronger day by day. It was an inevitable and visible improvement.Today, Lin Jiufeng defeated a demon and refreshed his chance to sign in.He immediately used it without hesitation.[Sign-In successful. Received a Spirit Accumulation Pill!]A jade bottle appeared in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s hand.Inside the bottle was a pill that looked as black as ink.There was no other strange smell coming from it. In fact, it had a refreshing fragrance to it that stimulated one\u2019s appetite.\u201cThis Spirit Accumulation Pill is a pill for the nourishment of the Divine Soul. It\u2019s just perfect for the white cat.\u201d Lin Jiufeng took the pill and left the underground palace.There was no need for him to refine his Divine Soul even further after it had taken shape.For some reason, the white cat still couldn\u2019t make a breakthrough into the Human God Realm.It had absorbed enough spiritual energy already, but it still couldn\u2019t cross the bridge.Some time ago, Lin Jiufeng examined its Divine Soul and spiritual consciousness.He discovered back then that the white cat\u2019s Divine Soul was a little bit lacking.As long as its Divine Soul was refined and strengthened, the white cat would then be able to reach the Human God Realm.Hence, when Lin Jiufeng returned to the courtyard, he directly hurled the Spirit Accumulation Pill to the white cat.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d The white cat wrote curiously and meowed at the same time.\u201cA medicinal pill that can help you make that breakthrough into the Human God Realm. Do you want it? If not, then return it to me.\u201d Lin Jiufeng stretched out his hand, gesturing to the white cat.But the white cat in front of him had already transformed into a streak of white light.With the pill\u2019s jade bottle in its mouth, it directly disappeared. It went to the frost jade bed in the courtyard, bit open the cap of the bottle, poured out the pill, and directly swallowed it. It didn\u2019t even care to identify the ingredients of the pill itself.The white cat had already deemed Lin Jiufeng trustworthy enough that he wouldn\u2019t harm it.As Lin Jiufeng watched, a smile appeared on his face.The white cat was now making a breakthrough in the courtyard, so he didn\u2019t go in lest he disturbed it.Lin Jiufeng prepared to look around the Cold Palace.But outside the Cold Palace, someone came.Lin Tianyuan!His body was much better than the last time he saw him. Although his aura was very weak and his cultivation had been destroyed, he at least managed to stay alive.Lin Tianyuan knocked on the door and shouted respectfully. \u201cUncle, I\u2019m here to see you.\u201dLin Jiufeng waved his sleeve and directly opened the door of the Cold Palace.He asked, \u201cWhat are you here for?\u201dLin Tianyuan smiled bitterly and said, \u201cI really don\u2019t visit unless I need something. Uncle knows me very well.\u201dLin Jiufeng smiled and said, \u201cYou haven\u2019t come to look for me in this period of time. You\u2019ve been busy dealing with state matters on your own. You must have stumbled upon a problem that you cannot deal with and that is the reason why you suddenly came to look for me today.\u201dLin Tianyuan nodded.He stood straight and respectfully explained.\u201cIf it\u2019s just my own problem, I naturally wouldn\u2019t have the face to trouble Uncle about it. But this matter isn\u2019t just my own, it\u2019s related to the millions and billions of people in the world. I can only be thick-skinned and ask for Uncle\u2019s opinion.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised his brows.He made it sound so serious.\u201cDuring this period of time, strange changes happened one after another all over the world\u2026\u201d\u201cMany aristocratic families and sects that were previously hidden from the world made their reappearance. When they resurfaced, what followed after them were even more peculiar changes\u2026\u201d Lin Tianyuan added.Lin Jiufeng listened quietly.This was similar to that demon\u2019s den.Like those demons, those aristocratic families and sects had sealed themselves in the previous era.They were now about to appear one after another.The world that had finally settled down with great difficulty was now in complete turmoil.\u201cUncle, how should we suppress or seal those ruins, ominous grounds, and those underground abysses?\u201dLin Tianyuan asked seriously.The appearance of those people once again brought harm to this world that was finally peaceful.\u201cI will set up a sealing array formation for you. Pass it down as you fit. As long as you\u2019ve found a place similar to what you have described, you have to immediately set up this sealing array formation\u2026\u201d\u201cI can guarantee that it will be able to suppress those places.\u201dLin Jiufeng tapped a finger on Lin Tianyuan\u2019s forehead as he imparted a sealing array formation that he had created himself through his research in array formations.After studying that thick Encyclopedia of Array Formations, Lin Jiufeng could already be considered as an Array Formation Master.What he imparted to Lin Tianyuan was the same sealing formation he used to seal that demon\u2019s den beneath that coffin in the Cold Palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He reckoned that a bloodbath would happen the moment they appeared in the world..Those people were powerful powerhouses of the previous era, although they were greatly weakened by the passing of time after being sealed for so long. The cultivators in this brand new world had just started to adapt to the renewed spiritual energy.It was unrealistic for them to defeat those old monsters that easily.They could do whatever they wanted. They could decide on anything.Once they managed to come out so early, those old monsters would be able to do whatever they wanted. If that happened, the existing order and the peace of the world would undoubtedly collapse.Hence, Lin Jiufeng imparted the sealing array formation that he developed to Lin Tianyuan.\u201cPass down this sealing array formation. You don\u2019t have to worry about anything else. At least for the time being, you don\u2019t have to worry about them breaking out of their seals.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s tone was calm, but the confidence contained within it pierced through the sky.How could he possibly have read that thick Encyclopedia of Array Formations in vain?\u201cThank you, Uncle.\u201d Lin Tianyuan thanked him happily.\u201cYou also have to pay attention to grooming your own forces. Does the Yuhua God Dynasty already have its own Human God?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.The Yuhua God Dynasty couldn\u2019t be supported by him alone.Lin Jiufeng would have to leave sooner or later.\u201cUncle, I\u2019ve already nurtured two Human Gods. Moreover, I\u2019ve already set up martial training schools all over the world, and I made laws concerning the nurturing of outstanding children\u2026\u201d\u201cThe martial training schools are built so that even the children of ordinary families can learn and cultivate on the martial path. Once these children grow up, their strength will definitely not be bad.\u201d Lin Tianyuan shared the results that he had achieved during this period of time.After that absurd Empress abolishing incident, Lin Tianyuan finally realized what must do.He must oversee the continued implementation of the reforms and he must also nurture talented youths to serve the dynasty.Lin Jiufeng looked at Lin Tianyuan.He couldn\u2019t help but be satisfied. \u201cI can see that you\u2019ve truly matured.\u201dLin Tianyuan smiled in shame as he directly took his leave.After obtaining the sealing array formation, he didn\u2019t have a reason to continue to disturb Lin Jiufeng anymore.When Lin Tianyuan returned to the Forbidden City, he drew the sealing array formation from his memory and passed it down.\u201cGet the Martial Sage Corps to take action. If there are any abnormalities anywhere, immediately use this to seal them. Don\u2019t be afraid of wasting materials. Our Yuhua God Dynasty has an abundance of them\u2026\u201d\u201cMy only requirement is that the safety of everyone must be ensured,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said solemnly.Someone immediately went ahead and delivered the message to the Martial Sage CorpsThen, Martial Sages from all directions left the Imperial Capital in droves.They brought with them the sealing array formation that Lin Jiufeng passed down to them as they went towards the location with abnormalities to seal those old monsters.In just a few moments, every member of the Martial Sage Corps that Lin Tianyuan had established finally left the Imperial Capital to do their jobs.Once his subordinate broke through to the Human God Realm, Lin Tianyuan established the Martial Sage Corps.The number of Martial Sages under his command now was a whopping 3,000.3,000 Martial Sages and two Human Gods\u2026Without relying on Lin Jiufeng, this force was enough to deter anything hostile in the world and protect the Yuhua God Dynasty.Since Lin Tianyuan turned for the better and apologized to the court officials one by one, the court officials\u2019 relationship with him became even more harmonious. They were more motivated in their work.The world was being governed harmoniously.At last, Lin Tianyuan could now compare to his father\u2014Emperor Yuan\u2014in the realm of politics and being the Emperor overall.\u2026After Lin Tianyuan left with the sealing array formation, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s days became peaceful once again. No one came to disturb him as he continued his routine of signing in quietly.Something had changed in his routine, however, every day he would defeat a demon from that demon\u2019s den in exchange for a sign-in. As a result, he would always have something new in his person every day, may it be a treasure, a bottle of pills, or a classical book of knowledge.Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t picky at all.He would take whatever he was given and he used them all to improve his strength.In just ten-plus days, Lin Jiufeng was already at the peak of the Ultimate Human stage, which was the third stage of the Human God Realm.He wasn\u2019t far from the fourth stage, Nirvana.\u2018According to the way I am quietly signing in silently now, this day for breaking through isn\u2019t far off.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng calculated in his heart.\u2018If I stick to my routine, the day of my breakthrough should be nigh.\u2019Lin Jiufeng calculated in his heart.But ten days later, he had already defeated the demons that were awake.The others were all asleep inside that demon\u2019s den.Seeing this, Lin Jiufeng closed his eyes.His Divine Soul left his body and it appeared as a second body.It was an avatar that could harness Lin Jiufeng\u2019s full strength.\u201cGo inside that demon\u2019s den and wake up the others,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said to his Divine Soul.He looked at the dozen or so demons before him.They were all dejected.These top powerhouses of the previous era had actually lost to a brat\u2014Lin Jiufeng.And they weren\u2019t even able to hold their own in the fight.In every battle between them so far, Lin Jiufeng only had to flick his finger.The resplendent ancient True Qi runes within his body would do the job for him as it would always smack the demons flat, instantly defeating them.Knowing that they had no hope of winning against him, they decided to obey Lin Jiufeng\u2019s every command. Today, they brought Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul into the depths of their demon\u2019s den as the latter awakened the slumbering Demon Gods.These Demon Gods were powerful existences that were countless times stronger than the demons that Lin Jiufeng fought against so far.The battle lasted for about 300 exchanges. Then, he signed in and left the place after he received something that he was satisfied with.Advance and retreat at will!This part of his routine had become the most important part of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s daily life. Defeating demons, signing in after their defeat, and receiving bountiful rewards for his victory. Every reward that was ever so slightly useful to him, Lin Jiufeng always made sure to use them.His cultivation advanced by leaps and bounds.The Human God Realm could no longer trap him anymore.These days lasted for three months.In three months, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s gains were enormous.He defeated the Demon Gods one after another.Not a single Demon God in their weakened state could defeat Lin Jiufeng.\u2026Three months later, Miss Hong returned to the Great Yan Dynasty.The first thing she did upon her return was to check the compass.This was the Heavenly Dao Sect\u2019s supreme treasure.It could predict if a seal on an ancient ruin from the previous era was about to be broken, releasing the old monsters within it out into the world.\u201cThat\u2019s strange\u2026\u201d Miss Hong looked at the compass with a frown.She remembered vividly that within the Yuhua God Dynasty alone, there were more than a hundred sealed beings that were about to break out of their seals.Back then, she planned to deal with the other locations first before going to the Yuhua God Dynasty to solve all of her problems at once.She didn\u2019t expect that these problems within the Yuhua God Dynasty would disappear in just three short months.\u2018How come they are all gone?\u2019 Miss Hong looked at the compass in confusion.\u2018Did that Human God from the Yuhua God Dynasty make a move?\u2019 Miss Hong guessed.\u2018But it shouldn\u2019t be that easy\u2026\u2019\u2018Suppressing one or two locations wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but to suppress more than a hundred\u2026 could it be that he knows an effective sealing array formation?\u2019 Miss Hong mumbled to herself.\u2018But this is also a good thing.\u2019After thinking for a long time, the confused Miss Hong decided to not think about it anymore.A slight smile appeared on her lips as she heaved a sigh of relief.\u2018I must take advantage of this period of stability to pay the debt of gratitude that I owe to that benefactor of mine. Then, I must repair my Divine Soul to completion. Only when I\u2019m done with this can I make a breakthrough into the next stage\u2026\u2019\u2018Only when my Divine Soul is complete can I become even stronger to suppress those people from the previous era to give the people of this era enough time to adjust to this brand new world. Hopefully, they\u2019ll become as strong as those from the previous era as soon as possible.\u2019Determination flitted across Miss Hong\u2019s eyes.This was the will and the legacy of the Heavenly Dao Sect.Equilibrium!Since Miss Hong had inherited the teachings of the Heavenly Dao Sect, she worked hard to enforce them.\u2018But how should I repay this debt of gratitude?\u2019Miss Hong thought for a while.In the end, she couldn\u2019t think of anything suitable for repayment.\u2018I\u2019ve got to consult the others.\u2019 Miss Hong started to make another batch of paper cranes.This time, she folded even more paper cranes than last time as she wrote her doubts within the cranes.\u201930 paper cranes will bring back 30 answers\u2026\u2019\u2018I hope those answers will help me think of a way to repay him.\u2019Miss Hong looked forward to hearing the answers of the recipients of these paper cranes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were able to control a portion of the Heavenly Dao\u2019s might.Then, they could use the Heavenly Dao either for themselves or to guide others.30 paper cranes flew out.In less than half a day, they brought back 30 answers.Miss Hong opened them one by one.The first answer was\u2026\u201cAfter being banished to the Cold Palace and living such a tough life for decades, his heart must be twisted by now and he must be resentful. The best way to repay him would be to overthrow the current Yuhua God Dynasty and let him ascend to the throne to become the Emperor\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, he would be able to take his revenge and kill his enemies to end his resentment.\u201dMiss Hong frowned and muttered, \u2018As expected of a demonic cultivator\u2026\u2019\u2018If I were to overthrow the current Yuhua God Dynasty, wouldn\u2019t that be akin to rebuilding a new dynasty? The world would be in chaos and I would no longer be able to suppress those people from the previous era. Wouldn\u2019t that be what they want to happen?\u2019If she really did that, she would become the greatest sinner of the Heavenly Dao Sect.The second answer was\u2026\u201cHeal his body and help him ascend to the throne of the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2026\u201dMiss Hong pondered silently.\u2018This was not much different from the first answer.\u2019The third answer\u2026The fourth answer\u2026Miss Hong read through 29 answers in a row.She received a myriad of answers, but none of them satisfied her.Until the 30th answer came.It was written by Monk Qingyun of the Dalin Temple in the Jiangnan area.\u2018Overthrowing the Yuhua God Dynasty and helping the dethroned Crown Prince ascend to the throne as the Emperor is unrealistic. He is not the only one inside that cold palace. The Human God of the Yuhua God Dynasty is with him\u2026\u2019\u2018His might is boundless and terrifying. If we were to go against him, it would end up in mutual destruction. Because of this, I suggest that we should compromise without lowering the quality of the repayment.\u20191Miss Hong\u2019s interest was piqued.In what way could they compromise?\u2018The Yuhua God Dynasty is the number one God Dynasty in the contemporary world. One could say that it\u2019s also doing very well nowadays. They even have an army filled with nothing but Martial Sages. There were even some that had already arrived at the Human God Realm\u2026\u2018Therefore, overthrowing the Yuhua God Dynasty just isn\u2019t possible.\u2019\u2018In that case, why not we choose a small country and shock the world by bringing the dethroned Crown Prince there? Let him ascend to the throne of that small country. Miss Hong shall be his backer and he will be able to fulfill his dreams of overseeing a nation\u2026\u2019Monk Qingyun\u2019s suggestion rekindled the light within Miss Hong\u2019s eyes.She was surprised!The idea was greatThe Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s territory was too vast.Once war broke out and the world fell into chaos, it would definitely suffer a catastrophe.But she was the reason why the dethroned Crown Prince was stripped of his position.If she wanted to return the position of the Emperor to him\u2014she could only use a small country outside of the Yuhua God Dynasty as a compromise.\u2018The question is\u2014which country is suitable?\u2019 Miss Hong mumbled.Thump, thump, thump!At this moment, a maid hurriedly barged into the room as she said anxiously. \u201cHoly Maiden! His Majesty has issued a decree and he has betrothed you to his Royal Highness, the Crown Prince\u2026\u201d\u201cThe wedding is in three months\u2026\u201d\u201cHis Royal Highness, the Crown Prince is right outside. \u201d\u201cHe wants to barge in here!\u201dMiss Hong was stunned.Her figure froze on the spot.Seeing this, the maid misunderstood. \u201cHoly Maiden, please don\u2019t be sad. His Majesty is old and muddled. His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, is a good-for-nothing. The people of our Great Yan Dynasty won\u2019t agree to this arrangement\u2026\u201dMiss Hong smiled.She held the answer given by Monk Qingyun and replied softly, \u201cSomeone\u2019s really giving me a pillow when I was feeling sleepy!\u201dThe maid looked at Miss Hong in confusion. She did not understand what the latter meant.\u201cGo and ask the Crown Prince to go back. At the same time, ask him to enjoy the small amount of nobility that he has. If he dares to forcefully barge in here, he will die!\u201dMiss Hong waved her hand.She was too lazy to pay attention to this Crown Prince who had always coveted her beauty.The maid immediately retreated.Miss Hong silently sent out another batch of 30 paper cranes.Only one sentence was in them.\u201cCome to the Great Yan Dynasty and do something for me!\u201dShe wanted to use the entire Great Yan Dynasty to repay her debt of gratitude.\u2026Yuhua God Dynasty, Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s life remained peaceful as ever.His routine didn\u2019t change that month in the days that passed.When he woke up from his cultivation in the morning, he would enter the underground palace and undo the seal of that demon\u2019s den. Then, he would awaken the Demon Gods and defeat them one by one.Afterwards, he would sign in and take the valuable treasures, cultivation techniques, and other items as his reward.When this was all done and over, he would seal the demon\u2019s den once more and return to the Cold Palace.Then, he would quietly ponder his own questions in regards to cultivation.Over this period of time, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation base advanced by leaps and bounds.He had already surpassed the Ultimate Human stage and entered the Nirvana stage.The next step after Nirvana was a breakthrough into the next realm.This wasn\u2019t difficult for Lin Jiufeng.As he continued to become even stronger, the pressure he was exerting on the demons in the demon\u2019s den beneath the underground palace also became stronger. Today, Lin Jiufeng visited that demon\u2019s den as usual, but it was unusually quiet.More than ten demons would usually rush up to him at the same time, but now\u2026There was no movement inside the bottomless demon\u2019s den at all.He felt not an ounce of danger.Such peace was truly ironic when the place was called \u2018demon\u2019s den\u2019.But this also showed the torture that the demons had experienced in these past few months.They were now less arrogant than when the demon\u2019s den was first discovered.When the seal was opened today, the demons immediately trembled and hid.They didn\u2019t dare to make a sound.They were afraid that Lin Jiufeng would find them.The faith of those captured by Lin Jiufeng was a guaranteed beating.Then, when he was done and over with them, he would casually throw them back into the demon\u2019s den like nothing.Being treated like this\u2014it was too shameful!They had no idea that Lin Jiufeng could earn rewards by beating them up.As a result, they all agreed that Lin Jiufeng was purposely doing this to humiliate them.He would humiliate them once, and the next time he visited, he would choose a different demon so that none of them would miss out on receiving his special \u2018treatment\u2019.He was simply too despicable.The demons and the Demon Gods alike burned with fury.Today, Lin Jiufeng stood on top of the demon\u2019s den after opening the seal. He realized that there was no movement whatsoever inside. Raising his arm, he reached out and knocked on the entrance.\u201cDon\u2019t even try to play dead. One of you shall come out and fight me. Once we\u2019re done, I\u2019ll leave you lot alone as usual,\u201d Lin Jiufeng shouted.He didn\u2019t want to go down with his real body for now.It would be too troublesome.Who knew how many Demon Gods were down there?It was better to play it safe.It wouldn\u2019t be too late for him to go down there after his breakthrough into the next realm.The demon\u2019s den was a location of boundless space.Hundreds of demons and the few Demon Gods inside were already awake.Without exception, they were all defeated by Lin Jiufeng.Then, they were thrown back down, losing all of their faces in the process.Hearing Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words, they were furious.\u201cI\u2019ll go up there and see what he\u2019s like. He\u2019s simply going too far. In the previous era, we were the leaders of our own demonic sects. Who in the world dared to humiliate us like this?\u201d A Demon God who had just woken up today was immediately infuriated by what he had heard.His lungs were about to explode from anger as he flew up.Boom!His demonic energy was powerful and vast.Although he was in a weakened state after being sealed for so long, his strength was still not something that those ordinary demons could compare to.\u201cBrat, stop being so arrogant. Your Demon God Grandpa shall come and kill you now.\u201dThe Demon God let out a long roar.His aura surged as he raised his hand and a resplendent blade of light manifested.He attacked from below, aiming to kill Lin Jiufeng in one blow.Seeing his arrogant look, Lin Jiufeng shook his head. \u201cYou\u2019re still too na\u00efve.\u201dHe pressed down with one hand.Surging True Qi, a vast Dao aura, and the four great immortal treasures in his body combined their strength altogether.Boom!The Demon Suppression Record erupted.An extremely terrifying black talisman condensed and smashed onto the Demon God\u2019s body with a bang.Pu!In a blink of an eye, the Demon God was sent crashing onto the bottom of the demon\u2019s den.The other Demon Gods couldn\u2019t help but sympathize with him.This was also the manner of their defeat.Lin Jiufeng sealed the demon\u2019s den in satisfaction as he signed in.[Sign-In successful. Received Divine Grade Grotto-heaven.]When Lin Jiufeng saw what he received, his eyes lit up.He couldn\u2019t help but utter in surprise. \u201cThe opportunity for my breakthrough is finally here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only by crossing this mountain could one arrive at the next realm\u2026\u2019\u2018The Human God Realm is a concept far too surreal for ordinary people. It\u2019s a mountain that they could never scale. But only those who have truly arrived at the summit of this mountain will be able to see and understand the vastness of the world, the vast expanse of heaven and earth, and the existence of other mountains.\u2019Lin Jiufeng lamented.The Human God Realm was a mountain and he was standing on its summit.He was now about to see the real world beyond it.The next realm after the Human God Realm was the Grotto-Heaven Realm.Opening a grotto-heaven in one\u2019s body was tantamount to creating a small, independent world inside one\u2019s body.This independent world was called \u2018Inner World\u2019.A cultivator could open multiple grotto-heavens, and once they have opened their tenth grotto-heaven\u2026Their might would truly become terrifying.Most of the demons in the demon\u2019s den beneath the Cold Palace were at the Grotto-Heaven Realm.But their grotto-heavens had long dried up. Lin Jiufeng was able to defeat them so easily because of this.\u2018I\u2019ve seen it in some secret books. Grotto-heavens are also divided into grades. They are divided into different grades because of the varying strengths they bestow upon their owner. This Grotto-heaven is a Divine Grade one, is divine the best grade?\u2019 Lin Jiufeng pondered.Standing at the entrance of the demon\u2019s den, Lin Jiufeng eventually stopped thinking about it.He decided to return for now and assimilate the Grotto-heaven he had just received and turn it into his own. Afterwards, he could then study the Divine Grade Grotto-heaven in his person.\u201cThis demon\u2019s den is truly a treasure trove with infinite treasures.\u201dLin Jiufeng was satisfied and had a good impression of the demon\u2019s den in the underground palace.But the demons within the demon\u2019s den weren\u2019t happy.After Lin Jiufeng left, the Demon Gods all gnashed their teeth in hatred and fury.\u201cHe has gone too far!\u201d\u201cIs he treating us like clowns or domesticated animals?\u201d\u201cHe always comes to humiliate us at least once a day. He obviously won\u2019t let us out. When have we\u2014in our entire life\u2014experienced something like this?\u201d\u201cWe have to think of a way to fight back. How did our demon\u2019s den that once shook the world become like this?\u201dDisgruntled and filled with rage, the demons and the Demon Gods wished nothing but the chance to cut Lin Jiufeng into pieces.\u201cThis seal is too strange. It always takes us ten days to break it. We\u2019re already too weak and he can always set this seal up like it\u2019s nothing. Unless he dies, there is no way for us to break this seal and escape,\u201d a demon said in distress.\u201cThere\u2019s still a way!\u201dAll of a sudden, a Demon God woke up from his slumber as he blurted out solemnly.\u201cSkyfiend, do you have a solution?\u201dThe other Demon Gods became excited when they saw this Demon God.Although all of them were classified as Demon Gods, there was still a huge gap between them.Ordinary Demon Gods were stronger than demons, but among Demon Gods?They were at the bottom.Demon Gods that were truly powerful would receive their own honorific names.One of those Demon Gods was this newly awakened Skyfiend.His honorific name was Skyfiend.Everyone respected his name.This proved his status among them.\u201cIt will take me at least three days to break this seal. It\u2019s just too strange. Sadly, that person comes here every day, so we cannot break this seal through conventional methods.\u201d Skyfiend stood at the bottom of the abyss, he looked at the seal above them as he commented.\u201cLord Skyfiend, you are one of the seven founders of our demon\u2019s den. Your demonic cultivation base is world-shaking. Is there a way for us to deal with this seal?\u201d A demon asked respectfully.\u201cYes, there is!\u201d Skyfiend smiled confidently.The other demons and Demon Gods all looked at Skyfiend.Excitement could be seen within their eyes.As soon as they got out, they would immediately rejuvenate their grotto-heavens by absorbing the spiritual energy in the air. Once they have recovered, they would immediately go and chop Lin Jiufeng into pieces.\u201cYes, we cannot get out on our own. But back then, I had set up a contingency plan. I separated a portion of the weaker demons from us and the place where they are sealed isn\u2019t that far from us. We should be able to wake them up and let them come here to rescue us,\u201d Skyfiend said.\u201cThat despicable and shameless human has a pretty high cultivation base. He\u2019s already at the peak of the Human God Realm,\u201d a Demon God said in worry.Why couldn\u2019t they leave?The seal was just a small matter.Given some time, it would be easy for them to break the seal.But there was this Lin Jiufeng who came here every day to beat them up. What\u2019s worse was that afterwards, he would always reinforce the seal back to its full strength.Having fought with Lin Jiufeng before, even though they didn\u2019t want to admit it, they had to nod and say:After having fought against Lin Jiufeng, these demons were reluctant to admit it, but they had no other choice but to accept that\u2026Lin Jiufeng was very powerful.\u201cYes\u2026 that despicable human is so powerful that his strength seems to be more than that of a Human God cultivator\u2026\u201d A Demon God bared his teeth and muttered in grievance.Only after one was given a beatdown by Lin Jiufeng could they understand how powerful he was.The might he had was suffocating, it was unfathomable and boundless.None of these demons knew just how strong Lin Jiufeng truly was. Did he even use all of his strength against them? Where was his limit?\u201cNo matter how powerful he is, he is still just one person. This time, I\u2019m going to call hundreds of demons to come here and bring disaster to this world. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to save everyone alone,\u201d Skyfiend said confidently.When the other Demon Gods heard this, they felt relieved.Each one of them looked forward to it.\u201cI will use a secret technique to inform the people of the other Devil\u2019s Dens to come out and then come here. Let this world welcome the arrival of the 3,000 Demon Gods!\u201d Skyfiend spread his arms and said, full of confidence in his words.\u201cI have a secret technique to forcefully awaken our people from the other demon\u2019s den. I\u2019ll use it and tell them to come out and come here\u2026\u201d\u201cLet this world welcome the arrival of 3,000 Demon Gods!\u201dSkyfiend spread his arms and announced. The arrogance in his voice couldn\u2019t be unmasked.The other Demon Gods also roared with laughter.They seemed to be already imagining in their heads\u2014the scene of Lin Jiufeng kneeling in front of them while begging for his life.\u2026The Great Yan Dynasty\u2026The Holy Maiden, Miss Hong\u2026The 30 Human Gods have finally arrived to answer her call.She personally gave guidance to these Human Gods and she was essentially the reason why they were in the realm that they were in right now.They were grateful to her and they immediately answered her request without hesitation.\u201cThe Emperor of the Great Yan Dynasty has gone senile. He wanted to betroth me to His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince. Yesterday, the court officials and the army forced him to abdicate and before even morning could arrive, he committed suicide.\u201dMiss Hong softly uttered as she looked at the 30 Human Gods.In a small dynasty like the Great Yan Dynasty, her strength and prestige were enough to overturn the imperial power with only a few words on her end.It was understandable why she said that the Emperor had gone senile and the Crown Prince was out of his mind. To think that he actually dared to covet her beauty.\u201cAll we need to do by now is to lead the army and go to the Yuhua God Dynasty. Then, we\u2019ll ask Emperor Ming to release and pardon the dethroned Crown Prince. Afterwards, we\u2019ll bring him to the Great Yan Dynasty and help him ascend to the throne, giving him infinite glory\u2026\u201d\u201cI believe that the dethroned Crown Prince will be overjoyed with this arrangement.\u201dThe towering man laughed.\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cThe last time we went to the Cold Palace, we didn\u2019t see the dethroned Crown Prince. Instead, we encountered that Human God of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d\u201cBack then, we were suppressed\u2026\u201d\u201cThis time, I don\u2019t think that the same will happen again. There are 30 of us Human Gods in a group, we will definitely be able to make the Yuhua God Dynasty agree to hand over the dethroned Crown Prince,\u201d Monk Qingyun was confident.If a battle truly happened, these 30 Human Gods were enough to overthrow the entire Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201cIf that is the case, then why do we have to bring the army with us? Why don\u2019t we just go there ourselves?\u201d Daoist Liu Yun was confused.\u201cIt\u2019s not that simple\u2026\u201d\u201cWe might be Human Gods, but we are just 30 individuals in total.\u201d\u201cOur numbers just aren\u2019t domineering enough\u2026\u201d\u201cTo the dethroned Crown Prince whose cultivation was destroyed and after having been imprisoned for decades, seeing an army with tens of thousands of people will have a more shocking effect than seeing 30 Human Gods.\u201d\u201cAt that time, when all of us addressed him together as \u2018Your Majesty\u2019\u2026\u201d\u201cThe grievances that he had experienced throughout the years will then burst out.\u201dMonk Qingyun shook his head and patiently explained.\u201cConsidering all of this, the dethroned Crown Prince would definitely be endlessly grateful to Miss Hong. Since Miss Hong wants to repay her debt of gratitude, we have to do it in the most exaggerated way possible to elicit the best possible effect.\u201d Monk Qingyun added.\u201cMonk, you\u2019re so sly,\u201d said a Human God.The others nodded in agreement.Miss Hong smiled happily.She waved her hand and said firmly, \u201cGive the order to the army to set off! We shall set off for the Yuhua God Dynasty and rescue the dethroned Crown Prince!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He continued to silently do his routine.Lin Jiufeng was holding the Divine Grade Grotto-heaven that he received from signing in.1\u201cIs the Divine Grade the topmost grade?\u201d Lin Jiufeng mumbled.But no one could answer him.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t mind.After all, since he obtained it from signing in, it was definitely something very precious.Lin Jiufeng looked forward to it.He said to the white cat.\u201cI\u2019m going into seclusion to make a breakthrough. Don\u2019t disturb me if there\u2019s nothing important.\u201dThe white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng in shock.It meowed and it wanted to write a question for Lin Jiufeng.But in the very next moment, it remembered that it had already consumed the Spirit Accumulation Pill given to it by Lin Jiufeng. With the help of that pill, it broke through into the Human God Realm.\u201cWhat realm are you going to break into?\u201dThe white cat\u2019s voice was gentle and mellow.\u201cI want to climb over this great mountain known as the Human God Realm and see how beautiful the world beyond this mountain is,\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied.The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng as if it was looking at a monster.\u201cWe\u2019ve just entered the Human God Realm and you\u2019re about to enter the next realm\u2026\u201d1The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng enviously.If Lin Jiufeng broke through so quickly, wouldn\u2019t its dream of defeating Lin Jiufeng and stepping on him with its paws become a pipe dream?Lin Jiufeng smiled.He walked into the courtyard and laid on the frost jade bed.\u201cStand guard for me,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said to the white cat.Then, he closed his eyes and entered a deep state of cultivation.That Divine Grade Grotto-heaven also entered his body.In the very next moment, a large amount of energy burst out from Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body.The white cat was so frightened that it hurriedly retreated.Its claws stabbed the ground as it tried its best to prevent itself from flying.\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to stand guard for you\u2026\u201dThe white cat mumbled. Its voice was soft and weak, like a complaining little girl.1But despite its complaints, it still laid on the wall of the courtyard and stood guard for Lin Jiufeng.And it did the same routine, day after day!A month after Lin Jiufeng went into seclusion, the Yuhua God Dynasty was thrown into chaos.1Forbidden City, Great Council Hall.The frail Lin Tianyuan sat on the throne, his face was deathly pale.It has been days since he had a good night\u2019s sleep.There were too many strange things happening lately that he couldn\u2019t sleep at all.In the Great Council Hall, the court officials looked exhausted.It was the same for them, they also couldn\u2019t sleep properly.\u201cYour Majesty, these demons from the demonic sects are indiscriminate in their wanton killings of the common people. Our people are suffering and many of them are dying.\u201d A court official reported.\u201cYour Majesty, the day before yesterday, a ruin appeared in Luoyang. It is the ruin closest to the Imperial Capital. More than ten demonic cultivators rushed out from the inside and killed the common people around them\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are currently rushing towards the Imperial Capital.\u201d Another cabinet court official reported.\u201cYour Majesty, these demons from the demonic sects are simply too much! They must be punished,\u201d the impartial assistant minister of the Ministry of Appointments shouted.\u2026Lin Tianyuan listened to the reports of his subordinates.He felt a headache coming. \u201cDear ministers, I have already sent the Martial Sage Corps and two Human Gods out. I hope that they will be enough to stop them.\u201d3,000 Martial Sages with two Human Gods as their commanders.Sadly, despite their numbers. They were still incapable of dealing with all the issues.\u201cReporting to Your Majesty! The Great Yan Dynasty has led an army of 200,000 soldiers and 30 Human Gods into our borders. They have already passed through the Qinling Mountain Range and are heading straight for the Imperial Capital.\u201d A scout barged in and reported loudly.The Great Council Hall fell into silence.Everyone was dumbfounded by the sudden news.\u201cWhy is the Great Yan Dynasty attacking our Imperial Capital? Although we are hostile to each other, we have never interfered with each other\u2019s affairs in the past few years.\u201dThe Cabinet Chief questioned loudly.The way he spoke revealed how he was panicking inside.Internal strife and external trouble.The scout replied loudly, \u201cI heard that it\u2019s because of the dethroned Crown Prince. The Great Yan Dynasty made a slogan, \u2018save the dethroned Crown Prince, let the Yuhua God Dynasty release the dethroned Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cDethroned Crown Prince? What dethroned Crown Prince?\u201dThe court officials looked at each other.They had long forgotten about Lin Jiufeng\u2019s existence.Instead, Lin Tianyuan\u2019s expression turned solemn.Wasn\u2019t the dethroned Crown Prince his Uncle, Lin Jiufeng?His Uncle, Lin Jiufeng was his greatest trump card.How could he hand him over to the Great Yan Dynasty?\u201cIt\u2019s just a small dynasty that wants to take advantage of the situation. There\u2019s no need to worry about it.\u201d Lin Tianyuan gritted his teeth and announced.\u201cReport!\u201dAnother scout ran over and said loudly, \u201cReporting to Your Majesty! The Martial Sage Corps and the two Human Gods leading them were wiped out. They were completely devoured by the demons outside the Imperial Capital\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are now on their journey for the Imperial Capital. They could arrive at any moment!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Lin Tianyuan stood up in surprise.He suddenly felt dizzy\u2026His body went soft, and he fell straight onto the ground.The Martial Sage Corps that he had painstakingly nurtured from the ground up was wiped out?How could this be?The court officials panicked.They hurriedly went to support Lin Tianyuan.\u201cYour Majesty, you must pull yourself together.\u201d the Cabinet Chief advised.\u201cI know\u2026\u201d\u201cAll of you, move aside!\u201d\u201cAt this critical moment, I want to be alone\u2026\u201d\u201cCabinet Chief, I now give you full authority to handle the matters of the Imperial Capital. I\u2019m going to see someone.\u201dLin Tianyuan stumbled as he got up. He wanted to go and find his Uncle.At every moment of peril, the person Lin Tianyuan thought of was still his Uncle\u2014Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s whole existence gave Lin Tianyuan unlimited confidence.\u201cUncle will definitely be able to handle these troubles!\u201d Lin Tianyuan was confident.He rejected the company of others and endured his exhaustion alone as he left the Forbidden City. The world was shrouded in darkness.It was clearly daytime, but it was so dark that it was no different from nighttime.The thick demonic aura scared the millions of people in the Imperial Capital.It scared them so much that they didn\u2019t even dare to breathe.The Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty was surrounded by black smoke. No one inside could see what was happening outside.Demons truly were at their strongest in the dark as they continued to wreak havoc.The Imperial Capital and the entire Yuhua God Dynasty were now in their darkest moments.The Great Yan Dynasty army hadn\u2019t even arrived yet.If the Great Yan Dynasty was added into the tally, the Yuhua God Dynasty would truly be powerless to turn the situation around in their favor.The current events were both similar and different from that battle at the peak of the Forbidden City many decades ago.Lin Tianyuan gnashed his teeth.Enduring the weakness spreading all over his body, he came to the entrance of the Cold Palace.\u201cUncle! Please save the millions of innocent civilians in the Imperial Capital!\u201dLin Tianyuan knelt down and shouted.Meow!The white cat came. It stood on the wall and said softly, \u201cYour uncle is in seclusion.\u201dLin Tianyuan was dumbfounded.At such a critical moment, his uncle was actually in seclusion.\u201cI\u2019ve already come out of seclusion. Let him in.\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s voice suddenly rang out.His voice immediately lifted Lin Tianyuan\u2019s spirits.He stumbled to the front of the courtyard and quickly explained everything to Lin Jiufeng.\u201cUncle, demons are wreaking havoc outside. There\u2019s also the Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty who\u2019s adding to our troubles. She\u2019s saying that she wants to save you and she wants me to release the dethroned Crown Prince\u2026\u201d\u201cUncle, my Martial Sage Corps has been completely wiped out\u2026\u201d\u201cThey are too powerful, I can\u2019t resist them.\u201d Lin Tianyuan cried.Creak!Lin Jiufeng opened the door to the courtyard and looked at the demonic aura billowing up in the sky. It had blocked everything including sunlight, plunging the Imperial Capital into complete darkness.\u201cDo I need her to rescue me?\u201dLin Jiufeng chuckled and walked out.\u201cUncle, the demons have already surrounded the Imperial Capital\u2026\u201d\u201cI have no idea why they are here,\u201d Lin Tianyuan said in fear.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. After tonight, the whole world shall lose their voice upon hearing about me. They are just mere demons, nothing worth mentioning,\u201d Lin Jiufeng patted Lin Tianyuan\u2019s shoulder and said calmly.\u201cUncle, are you planning to fight against so many demons alone?\u201dLin Tianyuan swallowed his saliva and asked.\u201cDo you think that those ants are difficult to deal with?\u201d Lin Jiufeng answered with a question of his own.If there was a group of demons dancing about in the sky, Lin Jiufeng would fly up into the sky to kill them.If there were demons causing trouble in the outside world, then he would go outside to eliminate them.Life truly was fascinating and unpredictable.Lin Jiufeng was no longer the same Lin Jiufeng from a month ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Millions of people and the higher-ups of the Yuhua God Dynasty were trapped in this isolated island.The demons screamed and laughed as they surged forward.The demons from all directions slowly gathered together, wanting to barge in through the main gate of the Imperial Capital.They surged over together. Their combined might was simply terrifying.Were Human Gods powerful?The Human God Realm was the highest mountain of the martial path. This was the belief of every cultivator in this brand new world. Most of them could only hope of reaching the summit of this mountain.But in the eyes of these demons, Human Gods were just pieces of flesh and blood.The demons were of all shapes and sizes. Some had bloody mouths, some only had one eye, and some were even humans that had transformed into demons.Their skin was pale, and they looked like dead people.The sight of it truly chilled anyone to the bones\u2026And these horrors were only a part of everything.\u201cIs this the brand new world?\u201d\u201cThe Mortal Realm\u2026 I sealed myself up for thousands of years.

Thus, we will have a feast.\u201dCountless demons were shouting and running around excitedly.These demons were at least at the Human God Realm, and they were all at the third or fourth stage.It was no wonder that Lin Tianyuan\u2019s Martial Sage Corps and their two Human God commanders were wiped out.\u201cThis is the Imperial Capital of a dynasty. Stain this place with blood. I haven\u2019t absorbed any flesh and blood essence for many years.\u201d\u201cI want to eat meat!!!\u201d\u201cI miss women, I want women!\u201dThe demons looked at the vast Imperial Capital.Their eyes turned green as they rushed over one by one.\u201cI want to release the Demon Gods in that demon\u2019s den. They are the true rulers of this world.\u201d\u201cOnly by releasing those Demon Gods can we take this world as our own and turn it into a demonic realm.\u201dThere was also a group of loyal and devoted demons hiding behind the scenes.They wanted to enter the Imperial Capital, find that demon\u2019s den, unseal it, and release the demons and Demon Gods inside.They were also rushing towards the Imperial Capital.The demonic energy that surrounded the Imperial Capital made the air itself heavy.The Imperial Capital was in grave danger at this moment.The common people shivered and hid at home, not daring to move.The streets were empty.Even the higher-ups of the Yuhua God Dynasty were watching in despair.The Cabinet Chief didn\u2019t dispatch the Forbidden Troops in the end, because that would just be sending them to death.They believed in Lin Tianyuan and also the terrifying existence behind him.Everyone secretly prayed that someone would step forward to save the Imperial Capital from this crisis.Da da da!The crisp sound of footsteps reverberated on the streets.The usually crowded Vermillion Bird Street was empty today.The appearance of this person attracted the attention of countless people in the Imperial Capital.Hope gradually rose in everyone\u2019s hearts.Lin Jiufeng walked on the street, his steps relaxed.The surging demonic aura was about to surge toward him, but he still walked resolutely toward the main gate.The main gate of the Imperial Capital was unmanned.In the face of such tremendous might that no mortal could hope to defend against. It would truly take a miracle for someone to come here and man the main gate.Lin Jiufeng came to the main gate.He pulled a chair over and sat down quietly.He was waiting for the demons to arrive.The other three gates were tightly shut.\u201cHuman. Flesh and blood. I shall devour you.\u201dThe demon that was the fastest to reach the Imperial Capital rushed over.He wanted to devour Lin Jiufeng.Pu!Lin Jiufeng flicked his finger.A streak of sword energy exploded and the demon was killed in an instant.At the very next moment, every demon stared at Lin Jiufeng.To be able to kill a demon so easily, this human wasn\u2019t simple.\u201cHuman. Instead of escaping, you are blocking the way here. You are akin to a mantis trying to stop a chariot.\u201d A demon sneered.Lin Jiufeng said calmly, \u201cWe will soon know whether it\u2019s a mantis trying to stop a chariot or not.\u201d\u201cAre you thinking that you alone can stop so many of us demons?\u201d\u201cHuman, your strength is not bad\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you join my Demon Cult and serve me under my crotch?\u201dA demon laughed and said.Lin Jiufeng looked at him expressionlessly and flicked his finger.Boom!The ancient True Qi runes that he had condensed long ago burst out and transformed into murderous beams of light.Pu!He swiftly killed the tactless demon who spoke so arrogantly.This time, every demon looked at Lin Jiufeng in shock.Was it really that easy?\u201cYou guys are from the previous era, so all of you should be buried in the previous era instead of coming to this era to lord over the others.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at the demons.He couldn\u2019t help but shake his head in disapproval.\u201cHuman! Go die!\u201d A demon coldly snorted and directly attacked.It was too lazy to talk nonsense.\u201cHave you seen the morning sun of the Imperial Capital yet?\u201dFacing the demon that attacked, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t hesitate to draw his Demon Slaying Sword.Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill!This was the first sword technique that Lin Jiufeng cultivated.At this point, his skills in this sword technique had already reached perfection.Lin Jiufeng drew his sword, raised his eyebrows, and slashed.An extremely terrifying phantom appeared behind him.It was surrounded by the universe and the stars.This phantom also drew its sword, raised its eyebrows, and slashed.Boom!A resplendent sword energy cut through the darkness.The dazzling light made one feel as if they were looking at the first ray of sunlight in the morning.This sword energy moved against the current.It swept past this demon.And every demon in the area was rendered speechless and frozen.A gust of wind blew.The demon\u2019s clothes and skin were blown away by the wind.In the very next moment, his entire body turned into dust that scattered into the air.Every demon could sense the power behind Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strike.The look in their eyes changed.Terrifying!It was too terrifying!They looked at Lin Jiufeng.They couldn\u2019t understand how such a terrifying existence like Lin Jiufeng could appear at the beginning of this new era.Lin Jiufeng looked at them.He retracted his sword and said calmly, \u201cI think it\u2019s better if all of you attacked together. If you come one by one, it will be certain death.\u201dThe invincible Lin Jiufeng seemed to be even worried about the demons.But he said this mainly because killing them one by one was too troublesome for him.They might as well attack together, so he could kill them at once.Tens of thousands of demons had come to the Imperial Capital.At this moment, they looked at each other. The situation they were in felt too surreal.They were a group of powerful demons from the previous era, but they were actually being threatened by a young man in this era?That\u2019s right\u2026To them, the 50-year-old Lin Jiufeng was indeed a young man.\u201cAttack together!\u201d All of a sudden, a demon roared.He was infuriated and furious, thinking that Lin Jiufeng was being too arrogant.In an instant, the demons unleashed their attacks all together. All sorts of techniques overlapped with each other creating a brilliant and grand, yet terrifying sight.Their target was none other than Lin Jiufeng.But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t even move.In fact, he didn\u2019t even unsheathe his sword.He stood tall and straight as he stood before the main gates.His eyes were calm as he watched the thousands of demons attacking him.Even so, he stood there unmoved.At this moment, the people of the Imperial Capital placed their hopes on Lin Jiufeng.The white cat watched anxiously on the wall of the Cold Palace.It bared its teeth continuously, worried about Lin Jiufeng.Lin Tianyuan looked on with a pale face.He was exhausted, but he didn\u2019t dare to sleep.He had to wait for this matter to come to an end.Rumble!The group of demons came crashing down.Their combined might made even the white cat\u2014a creature at the Human God Realm\u2014tremble in fear. It screamed and rushed out.Its speed was tremendously fast as it turned into a white shadow that looked awfully conspicuous amidst the darkness of the night.It wanted to go and fight alongside Lin Jiufeng.But just as it ran out, a crisp sound shook the Imperial Capital\u2026\u201cSword, come!\u201dClang!Clang!Clang!As soon as this voice fell, the bone swords in the deserted courtyard of the Cold Palace simultaneously shimmered as they flew out at once.Boom!The 365 bone swords shuttled through the air as they executed a terrifying sword technique.Death Bone Sword Technique!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was simply unbelievable.\u201cAm I seeing things?\u201d Monk Qingyun couldn\u2019t comprehend what he was looking at.They were all Human Gods, but why was this person so much more powerful than them?Miss Hong\u2019s expression changed drastically.She bit her red lips. \u201cHow could this be? These demons actually managed to come out. Won\u2019t that mean that I have failed in my responsibility?\u201dShe gave the order to set up camp as she took out her compass and studied it carefully.\u2026Deep underground in the Cold Palace\u2026In the demon\u2019s den beneath the copper coffin\u2026The Demon Gods inside felt the tremors in the Imperial Capital.They couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.\u201cThis time, we can finally go out, right?\u201d\u201cEvery other demon out there has come here to rescue us. There is no way that the people of today\u2019s era can resist them.\u201d\u201cNo matter how powerful that human is, he won\u2019t be able to withstand their attacks either. We are about to leave this place. When the time comes, we must wash at least 30,000 miles of land with blood so we can take our revenge.\u201dThe demons and the Demon Gods gnashed their teeth.They truly hated Lin Jiufeng to the core.\u2026At this moment, outside the Imperial Capital.The combined aura of tens of thousands of demons was simply too terrifying to look at.Even a Human God would probably just run away after a single look.But the Death Bone Sword Technique was unparalleled.It slashed out, and the first strike it made was akin to directly asking its enemies to reincarnate into their next lives.The bone swords were here to send these demons into the afterlife.Boom!Boom!Boom!Beams of sword energy exploded and rushed into the midst of the demons.The attack directly split their forces into two halves.In an instant, the dome of demonic energy that surrounded the Imperial Capital disappeared.It split open as a ray of moonlight shone before the main gate of the Imperial Capital.The moonlight fell on Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body and the next scene revealed was\u2026The image of a perfect man!That\u2019s right, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s image had become akin to that of a perfect man in the hearts of many young maidens of the Imperial Capital. His calm appearance and his fluttering clothes were deeply imprinted in the hearts of these young girls who longed for love.Thump, thump, thump!Beneath the moonlight, the corpses of the demons dropped one after another from the sky.They scattered all over the ground, not one of them had any life.Counting carefully\u2026There were 365 corpses.As for the bone swords, they returned to Lin Jiufeng\u2019s and circled him one by one.The power of these swords left those who witnessed their might dumbfounded and in disbelief.The 365 bone swords formed a sword formation that carried Lin Jiufeng up into the sky.The scene made him look similar to a sword immortal.This was the Death Bone Sword Technique\u2019s maiden fight.None of the swords failed, every bone sword had killed a demon.None of the swords failed in their mission to kill, they all took a demon\u2019s life.Lin Jiufeng raised his hand and looked at the remaining demons.Only one sentence came out of his mouth.\u201cPlease go ahead and die!\u201dBoom!With 365 bone swords flying around him, Lin Jiufeng charged towards the marching demons.Kill!Lin Jiufeng executed all of his sword techniques. He transformed into an absolute killing machine that wasted no move.Every move and stance that he executed was for killing.The demons were completely unable to withstand his terrifying techniques.This was the first time that Lin Jiufeng displayed his true strength.Grotto-Heaven!After assimilating the Divine Grade Grotto-heaven that he received as a reward for signing in, he made a breakthrough and reached the Grotto-Heaven Realm. That Divine Grade Grotto-heaven also became his first grotto-heaven.Rumble!At this moment, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Grotto-Heaven appeared and expanded throughout the space around him. It only took a blink of an eye before every demon in the Imperial Capital was enveloped by his grotto-heaven.\u201cThis is a grotto-heaven?\u201d A demon looked at the world around him in disbelief.\u201cMy grotto-heaven only has a range of 100 meters and it is a Middle Grade Grotto-heaven. But his grotto-heaven is actually the prototype of a small world?\u201dOne of the demons had a mental breakdown.1He didn\u2019t want to fight Lin Jiufeng at all. He only wanted to escape.But where could he escape to?Carrying his 365 bone swords, a move from Lin Jiufeng always took a demon\u2019s life.In addition to this, they were also currently trapped within the world of Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Grade Grotto-heaven and were unable to escape. They had become akin to cattle and sheep in a slaughterhouse.Not long after, Lin Jiufeng came out of his grotto-heaven and landed on the city wall near the main gate.His clothes and body were free of dirt. It was as if he didn\u2019t fight in a battle at all.At this moment, he truly looked invincible.The 365 bone swords also entered Lin Jiufeng\u2019s dantian.Moonlight shone on his body, making him look like an immortal that had descended to the Mortal Realm.Everyone in the Imperial Capital looked at him in anticipation.They were so anxious that they couldn\u2019t speak.Who exactly won?Where were those demons?Meow!Suddenly, a meow came from below.It was the white cat.It ran out of the Cold Palace at lightning speed and leaped into Lin Jiufeng\u2019s arms.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d The white cat asked nervously.\u201cNo.\u201d Lin Jiufeng hugged the white cat and reached out to stroke it gently.Being able to stroke a cat after a battle could be one of the happiest things in life.\u201cEh, where are the demons?\u201d The white cat asked curiously.\u201cOn top.\u201d Lin Jiufeng pointed.In the air, his grotto-heaven was still there.As he stretched out his hand and pointed, the Divine Grade Grotto-heaven slowly dissipated.The thousands of demons were wiped out.The dense demonic energy was completely absorbed by the Divine Grade Grotto-heaven.Hu! Hu!Hu! Hu!After the Divine Grade Grotto-heaven was done absorbing the demonic energy, the moon also finally appeared in the sky. Its light illuminated the ground and cast Lin Jiufeng\u2019s shadow on the ground.The demons were gone.The white cat blurted in surprise. \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201dLin Jiufeng smiled without saying anything.He stroked the cat again and deliberately messed up its fur.However, the white cat didn\u2019t get angry. Instead, it obediently let Lin Jiufeng rub it.As the grotto-heaven disappeared, the demons were reduced to ashes.Under the moonlight, Lin Jiufeng stood on top of the main gate.It was as if nothing had happened.The people in the Imperial Capital flocked and cheered.They knelt before Lin Jiufeng in excitement.Adages like surviving a calamity, escaping from the jaws of a tiger, strolling to the gates hell, all of them could be used to describe this situation.They were excited to see that Lin Jiufeng had solved the crisis for them.In the Forbidden City\u2019s Great Council Hall, the various court officials also heaved a sigh of relief.As they congratulated Lin Jiufeng loudly, they also knelt in his direction.Tonight, Lin Jiufeng saved millions of people in the Imperial Capital.In front of the Cold Palace, Lin Tianyuan smiled with a pale face.\u201cWe won.\u201d He sat weakly on the steps and reached out to touch his back.1He was drenched in sweat.He didn\u2019t sleep nor rest for many days.He spent his energy dealing with state affairs.Then, he experienced great joy and great sorrow.He was overjoyed that Lin Jiufeng had exterminated the demons.But sorrowful because the army of Martial Sages that he had painstakingly built was wiped out.Lin Tianyuan\u2019s body was already in bad shape.At this moment, he was already at the end of his life.\u201cLuckily, the Yuhua God Dynasty didn\u2019t get destroyed in my hands. It\u2019s mainly because Uncle is powerful, but at least I have lived up to my ancestors.\u201dLin Tianyuan felt dizzy and his body went cold.But he still stood up stubbornly.\u201cI want to handle one last thing.\u201d Lin Tianyuan gnashed his teeth and said firmly.He didn\u2019t go to call Lin Jiufeng because he had personally seen Lin Jiufeng fly to the Great Yan Dynasty\u2019s army after he had eliminated the demons.Lin Jiufeng had his own matters to handle and he ought not to disturb him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lin Jiufeng had no idea what her motives were, as a result, he took the initiative to look for her this time.In the camp, Lin Jiufeng saw the Holy Maiden who was in the middle of checking her compass.No one knew that he was here.He prevented others from seeing him.The Holy Maiden examined the compass.The many rivers and seas of the world were depicted on this compass.It also depicted a lot of hidden places.The Holy Maiden was studying it carefully as she murmured\u2026\u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be the case. It doesn\u2019t make sense for so many demons to come into being at the same time. This is only the beginning of the world\u2019s spiritual energy recovery. How did these demons calculate the time so accurately?\u201dLin Jiufeng hugged the white cat and watched on calmly.He suddenly understood that this Holy Maiden belonged to the previous era just like the demons.This compass of hers depicted the locations of those who had sealed themselves deep underground.\u201cSigh, I wonder what\u2019s the reason behind this\u2026 I can\u2019t make a breakthrough into the Grotto-Heaven Realm, and I also can\u2019t awaken my senior brothers and sisters. It\u2019s difficult for me to deal with them on my own\u2026\u201d\u201cMy Divine Soul isn\u2019t complete either, and I have to look for that dethroned Crown Prince of the Yuhua God Dynasty for the chance of recovery.\u201d The Holy Maiden sighed continuously as she eventually bit her lips out of frustration.\u201cYou wanted to see me?\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s clear voice suddenly sounded as he revealed himself.The Holy Maiden retreated a few steps in surprise as she raised her hand to defend herself.But when she saw Lin Jiufeng\u2019s appearance, she was dumbfounded.\u201cYou\u2026 How did you\u2026 It\u2019s been more than 30 years, but you\u2019re still so young\u2026\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t changed at all.\u201d The Holy Maiden stuttered.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s appearance didn\u2019t change much.What changed the most was his temperament.But his temperament caused subtle changes in his appearance.However, the Holy Maiden still managed to recognize Lin Jiufeng at a single glance.\u201cIt\u2019s the same for you. You didn\u2019t change much,\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied calmly.The current Holy Maiden was similar to the Holy Maiden in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s memories.Of course, her temperament also underwent a huge change.Thirty years ago, the \u2018Lin Jiufeng\u2019 of this world had interacted with the Holy Maiden.At that time, \u2018Lin Jiufeng\u2019 was obsessed with her. He gave up his position as the Crown Prince and also his life in exchange for the safety of this Holy Maiden.The current Lin Jiufeng was no longer the \u2018Lin Jiufeng\u2019 of the past.He had no designs nor feelings for this Holy Maiden at all.\u201cYour cultivation base\u2026\u201d The Holy Maiden sized up Lin Jiufeng.Suddenly, she covered her mouth in surprise as her pupils dilated.\u201cYou are the one who defeated the demons in the Imperial Capital?\u201dThe Holy Maiden asked in shock.\u201cYes. So, you\u2019ve sent people to find me twice. What exactly do you want?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you save my life?\u201d\u201cI heard that you were imprisoned in the Cold Palace all this while and that is why I wanted to save you. I wanted to give you the Great Yan Dynasty\u2019s throne. Back then, I am the reason why you lost the throne of the Yuhua God Dynasty. Now, I am giving you what you\u2019ve lost.\u201d\u201cI hope that you can forgive me for taking so long\u2026\u201dThe Holy Maiden took a deep breath and suppressed the shock in her heart.\u201cYou are being insincere. You are only thinking of repaying the debt of gratitude that you owe me for the sake of your Divine Soul\u2019s completion.\u201dLin Jiufeng decisively pointed out the Holy Maiden\u2019s lie.The Holy Maiden blinked in embarrassment.\u201cBefore you discovered the flaw in your divine soul, you probably couldn\u2019t even remember me at all. That\u2019s why you\u2019ve made such a big fuss. You\u2019re feeling guilty and you want to cover it up. All of these are nothing but for yourself, you don\u2019t have to put me on a pedestal.\u201dLin Jiufeng pointed out the Holy Maiden\u2019s thoughts.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d The Holy Maiden apologized pitifully.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that. Bring your army and go back. Don\u2019t alarm the common people.\u201d Lin Jiufeng rejected coldly.\u201cWhat should I do for you to forgive me? Give me a chance, my Divine Soul really has to be completed.\u201d The Holy Maiden begged Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng thought about it rationally and asked, \u201cAre you from the previous era?\u201dThe Holy Maiden nodded and said, \u201cI was born at the end of the last era.\u201d\u201cAll right\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, prepare every book and every information that you have of the previous era that you know. They must be very detailed. Have Monk Qingyun deliver them to the doors of the Imperial Capital\u2019s Cold Palace\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter I\u2019ve received them, I will definitely forgive your long abandonment of me in my heart.\u201d Lin Jiufeng made a request.\u201cNo problem, I will have them prepared for you.\u201dThe Holy Maiden\u2019s spirits were lifted as she smiled and agreed.Lin Jiufeng turned around coldly as he left directly.The Holy Maiden incident was caused by this world\u2019s \u2018Lin Jiufeng\u2019.After \u2018Lin Jiufeng\u2019 died in prison, he was already gone.The Lin Jiufeng who transmigrated here had never interacted with this Holy Maiden before.This was why it would be good for both sides if he handled this matter properly.Lin Jiufeng got what he wanted.The Holy Maiden obtained his forgiveness.The common people were also spared from a full-blown war.Both Lin Jiufeng and the Holy Maiden were satisfied.They each took what they needed.Throughout the entire process, only the white cat was confused by the whole process.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Otherwise, she could\u2019ve done it during the first few years after I was banished to the Cold Palace.\u201d\u201cBut she didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cShe only remembered my existence and the debt of gratitude that she owes me when she found out that her Divine Soul was incomplete.\u201d\u201cHer repayment was, in essence, a way to solve her own problem. It\u2019s not a way for her to express her gratitude to me, sincerely. \u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a very selfish person. I can\u2019t be bothered to get angry at her because it\u2019s simply not worth it.\u201d\u201cAfter this, her problem will be solved and I\u2019ll have even more information about the previous era. My connection with her will also come to an end.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t this a win-win situation?\u201dLin Jiufeng rubbed the white cat and explained.\u201cHow can you remain so calm? You\u2019ve discovered that the other party has other intentions for repaying her debt of gratitude, but you are not angry at all. Instead, you managed to maintain your rationality to the point that you even gained benefits for yourself.\u201dThe white cat was seriously impressed.\u201cThat is why you have to be careful. I might abandon you and remain calm about it in the future.\u201dLin Jiufeng teased.Meow!The white cat scratched Lin Jiufeng\u2019s shoulder in anger.Of course, he remained unscathed.Instead, it was the white cat whose claws felt pained.The angry white cat proceeded to turn her head and ignore Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng looked at her charmingly naive appearance.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mood turned for the better.As expected, the happiness of keeping a cat was something that cat-less people just couldn\u2019t understand.\u2026Lin Jiufeng quickly returned to the Imperial Capital.At this moment, the Imperial Capital was already under curfew.There was no one walking around on the streets.Lin Jiufeng walked to the door of the Cold Palace with the white cat.He was about to enter when suddenly\u2026Dong!Dong!Dong!In the Forbidden City, a bell rang nine times in a row.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes narrowed as he slowly turned his head to look in the direction of the Empress\u2019 Palace.More than ten years ago, Lin Jiufeng once heard the toll of this bell.It announced Emperor Yuan\u2019s death.Now that the bell had sounded once again, what did it represent?Lin Jiufeng\u2019s heart trembled.Although he was a very rational person and could calm throughout any situation.He also still had his own feelings.Did Lin Tianyuan, the child whom he watched grow up, died?The white cat looked over in shock.She jumped off Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body and said, \u201cYou should go take and take a look.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s body flashed. He disappeared in an instant.\u2026Forbidden City, Empress\u2019 Palace\u2026At this moment, everyone was sobbing and wailing.Originally, the entire Imperial Capital was cheering after Lin Jiufeng exterminated the demons.But no one expected that when Lin Tianyuan returned to the Imperial Capital, he would be drenched in sweat.He returned in a state so weak that he couldn\u2019t even speak.The eunuchs discovered him and they were about to send him to the imperial physicians to treat.But Lin Tianyuan rejected it.He was then carried to the Empress\u2019 residence.Afterwards, he summoned the court officials and the Crown Prince to pass on the throne to him.At the end of his life, he asked the Empress to come close and he whispered in her ear.\u201cDon\u2019t tell the Crown Prince about Uncle\u2026\u201d\u201cLet him feel pressured, so he can grow up on his own.\u201d\u201cTreat this matter as your greatest trump card and it will protect you well. I wrote a letter to Uncle. After I die, Uncle will definitely come to send me off. Pass the letter to Uncle by then.\u201dLin Tianyuan used all that he had left to say these last words before passing away.In his life, he hated arranged marriages the most.He married a wife whom he didn\u2019t like.He once wanted to abolish the Empress for a concubine.But now, the place he chose to die at was in the Empress\u2019 bed.He chose to pass away with her on his side.Lin Tianyuan was a very complicated individual.In the end, he had probably fallen in love with the Empress.Thus, he left his greatest trump card to her.He didn\u2019t pass it on to the Crown Prince because he didn\u2019t want to see the Crown Prince become as conceited as he was back then.He didn\u2019t want the latter to think that just because he had a powerful trump card\u2014he had the right to become arrogant.\u2026When Lin Jiufeng arrived, everyone was wailing non-stop.Especially the Cabinet Chief\u2026Counting this next generation, he has continuously served the imperial court for four generations.Three emperors had already passed away, but he was still here.And he would also be assisting the Crown Prince, the soon-to-be emperor.Lin Jiufeng looked at the silent corpse in the Empress\u2019 Palace.There was definitely sadness in his heart, but it wasn\u2019t to that extent he had felt when Emperor Yuan died.\u201cI told you to rest well.\u201d Lin Jiufeng came to Lin Tianyuan\u2019s corpse and sighed.Last month, Lin Tianyuan insisted on dealing with state affairs.It was also during that month that he depleted the rest of his life force.To Lin Jiufeng, the servants running around didn\u2019t affect him at all.They couldn\u2019t discover Lin Jiufeng, and Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want to be discovered by them either.After paying his respects to Lin Tianyuan, Lin Jiufeng found the Empress.Now, only the Empress knew his true appearance throughout the entire Yuhua God Dynasty.Hence, Lin Jiufeng sent a voice transmission to her and told her to come to the side hall without alerting the others.\u201cUncle!\u201d In the side hall, the Empress bowed with teary eyes.\u201cWhen Emperor Ming passed away, did he leave any last words?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cHe wrote this letter to Uncle.\u201dThe Empress respectfully took out the letter and handed it to Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng opened it.There were some heartfelt words in the letter, as well as a request for Lin Jiufeng to take care of the Queen and the Crown Prince.An orphan and a widow.In this world, ruling a huge dynasty would definitely pose many problems for them.This was why Emperor Ming, Lin Tianyuan, beseeched Lin Jiufeng to help them.\u201cIf there\u2019s any problem in the future, come to the Cold Palace and look for me. Also, teach the Crown Prince well. Don\u2019t feel too burdened. I will still be supporting you both from behind,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said solemnly.\u201cThank you, Uncle,\u201d The Empress gratefully said.She was about to kneel down when Lin Jiufeng\u2019s figure blurred and disappeared.Seeing this, she stopped what she was doing and went ahead to deal with Lin Tianyuan\u2019s funeral.\u2026Cold Palace\u2026Lin Jiufeng returned to the Cold Palace, his expression looked somewhat somber.He looked at the cherry tree where the flowers had wilted.Then, he personally planted another cherry tree at the side.Afterwards, the sad Lin Jiufeng directly went to the underground palace and opened up the seal of the demon\u2019s den beneath the copper coffin.\u201cWhy is it still you?\u201dThe demons in the demon\u2019s den were expecting someone of their own kind to open up the seal for them to escape. But when they saw Lin Jiufeng, all of them had a nervous breakdown, they couldn\u2019t believe their eyes.The demons had even surrounded the Imperial Capital, but Lin Jiufeng was still alive?What kind of existence was this Lin Jiufeng? Was he an Immortal?Lin Jiufeng\u2019s face turned slightly cold.For the first time since he first entered the demon\u2019s den, he felt infuriated. With the Demon Slaying Sword in hand, he pointed at the group of demons and said, \u201cIt was you lot who caused the demons outside to come into being and besiege the Imperial Capital, right?\u201dThe demons were shocked and angered by Lin Jiufeng\u2019s action of pointing at them with a sword.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d Skyfiend shouted angrily.He was in a bad mood right now.Why did the scheme that he had meticulously planned, fail?\u201cI want to kill you!\u201dBut Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mood was even worse.He didn\u2019t want to talk nonsense at all.He lifted the Demon Slaying Sword and moved to kill.The Demon Slaying Sword paired with Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strength and his Divine Grade Grotto-heaven allowed Lin Jiufeng to easily kill Skyfiend.That\u2019s right\u2026One of the founders of this demon\u2019s den, Skyfiend, whose cultivation base was unfathomable in the previous era, died under the Demon Slaying Sword.The other demons trembled upon seeing this scene.After killing Skyfiend, Lin Jiufeng vented the anger in his heart and left the demon\u2019s den.\u201cSign in,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.[Sign-In successful. Received one Grotto-Heaven Analysis Book!]Lin Jiufeng received the book and realized that it was an analysis of how to cultivate in the Grotto-Heaven Realm and how to improve his cultivation within the realm.\u201cNot bad, it suits me very well.\u201d Lin Jiufeng sealed the demon\u2019s den and left.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If he were to encounter trouble in the future, it would be the Empress who would come and ask for his hand in help.\u2026When Lin Jiufeng returned to the Cold Palace, he encountered Monk Qingyun.Monk Qingyun brought with him various information about the previous era that the Holy Maiden had agreed to give to Lin Jiufeng.As well as a bunch of books\u2026The Holy Maiden probably knew that Lin Jiufeng wasn\u2019t easy to deceive, so she prepared all of these with diligence to obtain his true forgiveness.Lin Jiufeng put away the books, then he drove Monk Qingyun away.\u201cTell your Holy Maiden that the grudges between us are written off,\u201d Lin Jiufeng told the monk.\u201cThank you, Benefactor.\u201d The monk thanked him.He didn\u2019t want to stay for a moment longer, so he turned around and left.Lin Jiufeng returned to the Cold Palace with a large pile of books.Then, he browsed through them with the white cat.What was the difference between the previous era and this era?Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t understand much in the past, but after reading these books, he finally understood their differences.The world also had its own ups and downs.The common people wouldn\u2019t be able to see these ups and downs, but they would be able to experience them through the changes in the world\u2019s spiritual energy.The spiritual energy in each era would continue to improve.When it reached its peak and lasted for a period of time, it would decline.Upon reaching its peak, it would stay there for a long period of time.Afterwards, it would go into a decline.As the world\u2019s spiritual energy declined in quality and quantity, the powerhouses of the world would also slowly disappear.Some of them would die, some would seal themselves, their choices varied.The end of the previous era was 1,500 years ago.At that time, Human God Realm cultivators were the strongest.People like the Demon Lord were also affected by the decline of the world\u2019s spiritual energy.If not for this, then he would\u2019ve been able to make a breakthrough into the Grotto-Heaven Realm and into other higher realms.The spiritual energy in the world continued its decline, hundreds of years ago, even Martial Sages disappeared. Only Great Grandmasters remained.It was only after Lin Jiufeng arrived in this world that the world\u2019s spiritual energy started its slow recovery.Its recovery signaled the start of a new era.Lin Jiufeng was fortunate to advance by leaps and bounds in his cultivation right at the start of the new era. Right now, he stood at the Grotto-Heaven Realm.All of this was the result of luck, and ample opportunities combined.\u201cAccording to this book, the Grotto-heaven Realm requires one to form ten grotto-heavens. How many have you formed by now?\u201d The white cat asked curiously.\u201cOne,\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied.\u201cThen, you still have to condense nine grotto-heavens,\u201d the white cat said.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not forming another nine grotto-heavens.\u201d Lin Jiufeng shook his head.\u201cWhy?\u201d The white cat asked curiously.\u201cThe Grotto-Heaven Realm allows one to form ten grotto-heavens. When stacked together, their combined might will surely be powerful.\u201d\u201cBut there is more than one path on the Grotto-Heaven Realm. There are many choices.\u201d\u201cI am planning to cultivate a single grotto-heaven. Then, I will use the remaining nine chances to improve this single grotto-heaven. I\u2019m sure that at the end of this road, this lone grotto-heaven will become tremendously powerful\u2026\u201d\u201cThis path is also the most suitable for me.\u201d Lin Jiufeng explained.He originally wanted to form ten grotto-heavens, but after reading the Grotto-Heaven Analysis Book that he obtained from signing in, he realized that he had understood a lot of things.Grotto-heavens were divided into Low Grade, Middle Grade, High Grade, Saint Grade, and Divine Grade.The method to form ten grotto-heavens was only suitable for cultivators with low to high grade grotto-heavens.This was because their grotto-heavens didn\u2019t have much potential, the benefits of expanding them were far less than forming ten grotto-heavens.But there was no need to form ten grotto-heavens for those that had saint and divine grade grotto-heavens.They just had to focus on developing that single saint or divine grade grotto-heaven.Then, when that grotto-heaven became a small, independent world.It would truly become powerful.This was the path that Lin Jiufeng ultimately chose.The white cat listened to Lin Jiufeng talk about a lot of things, but she couldn\u2019t fully understand it.She was only at the Human God Realm, a realm that was quite distant from the Grotto-Heaven Realm.\u201cRead these books properly and increase your knowledge. They will definitely be useful for cultivation.\u201d Lin Jiufeng gently stroked the white cat\u2019s soft body.\u2026Five years passed in a flash.In the past five years, Lin Jiufeng had never left the Cold Palace. Other than Dachun coming over once a month to the Cold Palace, no one else visited him.Lin Jiufeng had no idea about the changes nor the dangers of the outside world.What he only knew was what he heard from Dachun.Lin Jiufeng ignored everything else.He slowly improved and expanded his grotto-heaven.He didn\u2019t even want to know about the matters regarding the Yuhua God Dynasty.He only knew that the current Crown Prince ascended to the throne and changed the dynasty title to De. His title was Emperor De.Other than that, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t know anything else.He signed in quietly in the Cold Palace and visited the demon\u2019s den in the underground palace every day to defeat a demon or a Demon God.Ever since these demons and Demon Gods saw Lin Jiufeng kill Skyfiend with brute force during that time when he was in a bad mood\u2026They became very obedient.Every day, a new demon or a Demon God would automatically come out to get beaten up by Lin Jiufeng. After he was done with them, the demons would then be able to live their lives peacefully in the demon\u2019s den.After five years, the only opinion that these demons had towards Lin Jiufeng was\u2014he was too terrifying.Every Demon God that fought with Lin Jiufeng said that Lin Jiufeng was becoming more and more unfathomable. He was now akin to that of a boundless ocean, bottomless.Therefore, they became as obedient as little chicks.They seemed to have become like animals being raised by Lin Jiufeng.As long as they didn\u2019t cause trouble, Lin Jiufeng wouldn\u2019t bother to kill them.Today was the day Dachun would deliver food again.Once a month, Dachun insisted on coming over personally.The current Dachun was already 50 years old.His child was already married and he was even a grandpa by now.But he was still that honest young man from back then, he didn\u2019t change at all.He brought food and wine as usual and continued to tell Lin Jiufeng about what happened in the Imperial Capital.Lin Jiufeng was enjoying the meal with the white cat while listening to Dachun.\u201cYour Royal Highness, just yesterday\u2026\u201d\u201cEmperor De formally became a disciple to a master and he conferred him the title of State Teacher,\u201d Dachun said.\u201cWhat kind of person can become the State Teacher?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.All these years, the Yuhua God Dynasty remained peaceful and quiet.It was because everyone knew that five years ago, on the night of Emperor Ming\u2019s death, a horde of demons surrounded the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s Imperial Capital. But they were all turned into ashes by the dynasty\u2019s guardian god.Now\u2026Everyone knew that there was an old monster that had been guarding the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty since Emperor Yuan\u2019s time, then Emperor Ming\u2019s time, and then to Emperor De\u2019s time.If they wanted to provoke the Yuhua God Dynasty, they had to defeat this old monster first.These were the words that were still being passed down in the martial world.Lin Jiufeng had heard Dachun mention the possibility of Emperor De taking in a master before.Hence, his curiosity was piqued.To be able to become the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s State Teacher, what capabilities did this person have?\u201cI\u2019m not sure what kind of person he is either\u2026\u201d\u201cI only heard from others that he\u2019s the Sect Leader of a Hidden Sect. I think the name of this sect is something called Zenith Heaven Path Sect,\u201d Dachun said.\u201cZenith Heaven Path!\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes narrowed.He immediately remembered that this sect was recorded in the books that the Holy Maiden gave him.The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng solemnly.She had also read that book before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 75Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe books from the previous era sent by the Holy Maiden described the Zenith Heaven Path Sect as a very powerful sect in the days of yore.\u2018At its peak, the Zenith Heaven Path Sect had three Celestial Venerables, seven Heavenly Kings, and nine Supremacies. They were a force that couldn\u2019t be ignored among the myriads of sects. They were powerful\u2026\u2019Lin Jiufeng recalled the contents of one of the books that depicted the Zenith Heaven Path Sect in its entries.The strength of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect became apparent from the emotions of the author when he was writing his entries in the book. His penmanship revealed that he was also apprehensive about writing the terrifying parts of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect.The Holy Maiden of the Great Yan Dynasty was a disciple of the Heavenly Dao Sect. There were many records about the sects of the past from the books in her sect. According to one of the books she had given to Lin Jiufeng, the Zenith Heaven Path Sect also went into hiding.They sealed the entrance of their sect and not any member had come out ever since.However, they seem to have knowledge in regards to the cycle of the world\u2019s spiritual energy.They seemed to know when the world\u2019s spiritual energy would weaken and recover.Therefore, it was also written in the book that the Zenith Heaven Path Sect was one of the few major sects of the previous era that had the capabilities to assess the situation of the world. In addition, their foundation was also incomparably deep.They had apparently existed for an unknown amount of era since recorded history.The evaluation of the book\u2019s author about the Zenith Heaven Path Sect was extremely high.In these five years, Lin Jiufeng had read through all the books given to him by the Holy Maiden.He had read through too many entries that described a number of powerful sects that became invincible at the peak of the world\u2019s spiritual energy recovery. But since the reason for their rise was riding the coattails of the world\u2019s spiritual energy, its decline also signaled their decline.Eventually, they disappeared.As the saying went, one could only see who was swimming naked when the waves receded.The Zenith Heaven Path Sect was such a sect.Their sudden appearance into the world and their act of taking in Emperor De as their disciple as well as one of them becoming the State Teacher of the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2026All of these felt off to Lin Jiufeng.\u2018Isn\u2019t the Holy Maiden a member of the Heavenly Dao Sect?\u2019\u2018Hasn\u2019t she always been working hard to suppress these sects from the previous era? Why did she let the Zenith Heaven Path Sect come out?\u2019\u2018Could it be that she wasn\u2019t strong enough to suppress the Zenith Heaven Path Sect?\u2019\u2018Or is there another reason behind it?\u2019Lin Jiu pondered over this matter.\u2018Was the Zenith Heaven Path here with good or evil intentions?\u2019Lin Jiufeng had no idea.The key was that the former Empress, the now Empress Dowager, didn\u2019t come to ask Lin Jiufeng for help.That at least meant that she agreed with letting the Zenith Heaven Path Sect meddle with the affairs of the Yuhua God Dynasty.After all, the new emperor ascended to the throne when he was just 13 years old.Five years had passed and he was only 18 years old this year.His young age meant that the Empress Dowager was still in charge of the state affairs.Lin Jiufeng drank his wine silently as he listened to Dachun\u2019s words.\u201cYour Royal Highness, the Zenith Heaven Path Sect is quite powerful\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the past, there was a rebellion from the Barbarians in the Southwest Territory. By relying on their powerful Priests, they constantly harassed our borders. Our God Dynasty lacked the manpower and couldn\u2019t get rid of them all at once\u2026\u201d\u201cBut once the people from the Zenith Heaven Path Sect took action, they directly slaughtered their way into the territory of the Barbarians.\u201d\u201cThey killed several Priests and forced them to compensate and apologize before submitting a plea of surrender.\u201d Dachun explained excitedly.This move by the Zenith Heaven Path Sect saved a lot of face for the Yuhua God Dynasty.Their kind actions also made the Yuhua God Dynasty lower their guard against them.Lin Jiufeng savored the ins and outs of this matter. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh at how clever the Zenith Heaven Path Sect was. They made use of external enemies to allow themselves to naturally enter the higher-ups of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Other sects or demonic sects all wanted to stir up trouble in this new era. Especially when they saw that the Yuhua God Dynasty was still the number one divine dynasty in the world, they naturally wanted to overthrow the Yuhua God Dynasty to show off their might.But the Zenith Heaven Path Sect was different. They took the initiative to integrate into the Yuhua God Dynasty and then taught the new Emperor of the Yuhua God Dynasty through the identity of the State Teacher.Effortlessly blending into the new era without any sense of discord nor stirring up trouble.Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but think of the demon\u2019s den beneath the Cold Palace.Although the group of demons from that demon\u2019s den were powerful in the previous era, their brains were clearly not as advanced as the people from the Zenith Heaven Path Sect.\u201cYour Royal Highness, after the sect leader of the Zenith Heaven Path became the State Teacher, they announced that they would establish a sect on a mountain, north of the Imperial Capital and that they wouldn\u2019t participate in the state affairs.\u201dDachun continued to talk about other things.He also felt that the Zenith Heaven Path Sect\u2019s presence was advantageous for the Yuhua God Dynasty.At the very least, the Yuhua God Dynasty now had the support of an extremely powerful force.Lin Jiufeng felt that he should continue to observe the situation.He neither supported nor objected. In any case, as long as they didn\u2019t disturb his quiet life and didn\u2019t bring trouble to the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2026Whatever the Zenith Heaven Path Sect did had nothing to do with him.Even if the Zenith Heaven Path wanted to use the Yuhua God Dynasty to seek benefits in this era, it didn\u2019t bother him at all.After all, if they borrowed the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s power, the Zenith Heaven Path Sect would also have to share the burdens of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201cPerhaps I won\u2019t have to interfere with those troublesome matters in the future. The Zenith Heaven Path Sect can be my helper by proxy.\u201d Lin Jiufeng felt quite satisfied thinking about this.After Lin Jiufeng was done with the meal, Dachun packed the utensils and left.His body had obviously gained weight. He was younger than Lin Jiufeng by a few years and was only in his early fifties. His cultivation base had reached the Martial Sage Realm, so his body and appearance were quite well maintained.Dachun had obviously gained weight.He was younger than Lin Jiufeng by a few years and he was only in his early fifties. He was also a Martial Sage Realm cultivator, so his body and appearance were quite well-maintained. But he had obviously lived in comfort for a long time, as a result, his body was slowly getting plump.Dachun had no other pursuits in life.His cultivation base was slowly improving and if he was lucky enough to make a breakthrough into the Human God Realm, he would be able to live for another few hundred years.Even if he couldn\u2019t make a breakthrough, he wouldn\u2019t be too sad about it.Dachun\u2019s mentality was solid.He was in charge of the logistics of the Imperial Guards.This was a good job for him.He also had a wife now, a son, and a grandson.His life was happy and fulfilling.Moreover, he could be considered to be a citizen that had gone through four dynasties.At the very least, his position in the Yuhua God Dynasty was stable and firm.Lin Jiufeng looked at Dachun\u2019s departing figure and sighed.Everyone had different pursuits in life, so their definition of happiness varied\u2026\u2018I\u2019ll just continue to sign in.\u2019Lin Jiufeng shook his head and returned to the Cold Palace to do his usual routine.\u201cMeow\u2026\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a fight in the past five years. Just how exactly powerful are you by now?\u201dThe white cat asked curiously.After five years, her fur had become increasingly crystal clear.Her nose had turned pink and her eyes seemed to contain a sky full of stars.The fact that a cat could be so good-looking truly exceeded Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expectations.Lin Jiufeng reached out and carried the white cat into his arms.Her soft body felt as if she didn\u2019t have any bones, and her fur still felt good to the touch.\u201cI\u2019m not powerful,\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied to the white cat.The white cat refused to believe Lin Jiufeng\u2019s nonsense.She tried to struggle out of his arms.In the earlier years, she wouldn\u2019t even let Lin Jiufeng hug her, let alone letting him caress her soft body.But after the first hug, the second hug, and the third\u2026She got used to it.The key was that she was unable to resist Lin Jiufeng anyway.When Lin Jiufeng opened his hand, she would be pulled into his embrace.As the saying goes, if one couldn\u2019t resist, then just make do with it.But if Lin Jiufeng angered her, she would definitely not let him hug her.Sensing that the white cat was about to slip away, Lin Jiufeng calmed it down.\u201cI\u2019m telling the truth. I\u2019m not powerful.\u201dAfter reading so many books from the previous era, the more Lin Jiufeng understood about the higher cultivation realms, the more he felt that he was very weak.This sense of weakness was comparable to the sense of weakness that the people from the previous era felt in this brand new world.\u201cYou\u2019re lying to me again!\u201dThe white cat accused Lin Jiufeng. Her sharp white teeth were about to pierce through Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body, but when her teeth touched the skin on Lin Jiufeng\u2019s wrist, she couldn\u2019t bear to really bite it down.She just placed her teeth on Lin Jiufeng\u2019s wrist and pretended to be fierce to threaten him.Lin Jiufeng chuckled.Looking at her stupid, cute, and fierce appearance\u2026He replied gently, \u201cI am not strong, but the people in this world seem to be\u2026\u201d\u201cSeems to be weaker than me.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She stretched out her pink tongue and licked Lin Jiufeng\u2019s wrist.Then, she let Lin Jiufeng stroke her as he wanted.After interacting with Lin Jiufeng for almost 10 years, their relationship had long become deep.Now that Lin Jiufeng had become so powerful, the white cat seemed to be proud of him.Lin Jiufeng carried the white cat and returned to the courtyard.Two cherry trees, one big and one small were budding and extending their branches.They were about to blossom.The cherry tree that he planted when Emperor Ming passed away had also grown up.Lin Jiufeng was often in seclusion, so he couldn\u2019t feel the passing of time.Only when he saw the two cherry trees did he realize that such a long time had already passed so fast.He was now about 60 years old.He had been silently signing in within the confines of the Cold Palace for almost 40 years now.\u2018The world is too complicated. I\u2019ll just continue signing in here. At the very least, I have to defeat every demon in the demon\u2019s den underneath and squeeze out as much of their value as I can\u2026\u2019Lin Jiufeng was patient.After putting down the white cat, he turned around and went to the underground palace.The demons and Demon Gods in the demon\u2019s den had tried to resist back then.But facing Lin Jiufeng\u2019s cultivation base, no one could withstand him.Especially in the past five years, Lin Jiufeng had become increasingly unfathomable.In the demon\u2019s den, deep underground\u2026More than 3000 once infamous demons, Demon Kings, and Demon Gods were gathered.This demon den only had a single exit.After all, it was created to prevent the dissipation of the abundant spiritual energy inside and to prevent the declining spiritual energy of the world from entering and contaminating the demon\u2019s den.Therefore, the seal must be tight.They also had to minimize the risk of others discovering and breaking the seal prematurely.Only then could they continue to exist for a long time.This idea was unanimously agreed upon by everyone back then.But now, the plan that had prolonged their lives for so long was also the reason why they were unable to get out and remained trapped in the demon\u2019s den.The 3000 plus demons had arranged coffins for themselves, some placed themselves in a pocket of space, floating freely in the air. Some directly dug holes and buried themselves in them.They hibernated in different ways, but now they all had something in common.It was because they were all awake.Everyone looked at each other.In the previous era, they were powerful demons, high-spirited Demon Kings, and formidable Demon Gods who ruled over their own regions.But in this era, they were like the elderly in the villages. They only sat and idled around, doing nothing every day. They chatted about their glorious pasts, lamenting the passing of time and the emergence of new talents in this new era.\u201cHow did things come to this?\u201d Suddenly, a Demon King covered his face and sighed.No matter how much hatred and anger they had towards Lin Jiufeng, they all vanished under his fist.Now, all that was left in them was sadness and melancholy.This particular Demon King was incredibly depressed about this.It was the kind of feeling that made him wish that he could cut open his own head with a knife and ask himself if the donkeys had gone into his head when he designed this demon\u2019s den back then.If he had created another exit, the 3,000 plus demons in here right now wouldn\u2019t have to obey Lin Jiufeng\u2019s wishes.The other Demon Kings fell silent.\u201cThat human is becoming stronger and stronger. If we had counterattacked all at once at the start, we could\u2019ve had a chance,\u201d A Demon God said with regret.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d\u201cThat human has humiliated us for more than five years now, but we don\u2019t even know his name after so long. What a disgrace.\u201d A demon gnashed his teeth in anger.But what came after his anger was disappointment.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t humiliate us like this for the rest of our lives, would he?\u201d Suddenly, a Demon King blurted out.The others stiffened.This time, no one could sit still.Being humiliated was a fact, they accepted it.They had to accept it.They had no choice but to accept it.But they would rather die than submit to this kind of humiliation for the rest of their lives.Every demon\u2026Every Demon King\u2026And every Demon God in this demon\u2019s den had their own dignity.\u201cI can feel that he is becoming stronger and stronger. When he came over yesterday, I attacked him, but he defeated me with a single flick of his finger,\u201d A Demon God said with lingering fear.\u201cFighting him is like fighting against a celestial. It\u2019s too terrifying.\u201d The Demon God\u2019s heart trembled as he recalled.Demons were also living things.It was just that some of them were exotic, but all of them were fundamentally afraid of the strong, especially those like Lin Jiufeng whose strength was unfathomable to them.As long as they had no idea just how exactly strong he was, they would always find it difficult to fight him with all of their strength.Because no matter how powerful they were\u2014they would still be easily defeated by Lin Jiufeng.\u201cHe\u2019s probably about to come today. I\u2019ll go and give it a try.\u201d A Demon King stood up.He had never fought with Lin Jiufeng before, but the people who fought with Lin Jiufeng would always come down and reenact their fight.As a result, he was prepared and knew what to expect.\u201cThis time, even if I have to use the last vestiges of spiritual energy in my body, I have to test his bottom line.\u201d The Demon King gnashed his teeth.Everyone looked at this Demon King as if they were looking at a brave warrior.Dong, dong, dong!Footsteps sounded from above the demon\u2019s den.The 3,000 demons, Demon Kings, and Demon Gods below all raised their heads in unison.Lin Jiufeng was here!\u201cWho is it today?\u201d Lin Jiufeng opened the seal and asked.It was just like how an emperor would visit his imperial concubine by flipping the card.Every day when Lin Jiufeng came over, he would \u2018visit\u2019 a Demon King or a Demon God.At the very least, his opponent would be a demon.The 3,000 plus famous demons in the demon\u2019s den looked at the Demon King who had volunteered.There was encouragement in their eyes.The Demon King who volunteered gritted his teeth.He roared angrily and displayed his ultimate technique.In his weakened state, he did his best to display the demonic path\u2019s highest martial technique, the Burning Heaven Demon Technique!The power he displayed was definitely very powerful even amongst the average Grotto-Heaven Realm cultivators.This Demon King\u2019s entire body exploded into an inferno of flames as he flew up.The flames that he carried with him seemed to be able to burn everything under the heavens.The flames were black with a hint of red.They were special flames in the demonic path that could easily burn weapons, treasures, and the like.The 3,000 plus demons watched with anticipation in their eyes.The Demon King had displayed a might comparable to a fifth or sixth-level Grotto-Heaven Realm expert.Would this human who had been continuously torturing them be able to resist?If he couldn\u2019t withstand it, they would be able to break the seal and escape.This was the dream that the 3,000 plus demonic beings wanted to see the most.But in the end, a dream was just a dream.Lin Jiufeng watched as the charging Demon King transformed into a ball of flames.The raging flame was a threat, even to him.Lin Jiufeng also saw the anticipation within the eyes of the 3,000 plus demons down below.Regarding this, Lin Jiufeng remained languid.He directly stretched out his palm.Demon Suppression Record!A huge talisman that emanated a terrifying aura manifested.It directly pressed down.Boom!This slap landed on the Demon King\u2019s body.The raging flames on his body became akin to that of a crazed firecracker as they exploded in every direction possible. The Demon King let out a tragic cry as his body flew straight down, back into the abyss, and crashing against the floor of the demon\u2019s den.The 3,000 plus demons were all dumbfounded.\u201cHe\u2019s even stronger now,\u201d a Demon King murmured.\u201cIt\u2019s over, it\u2019s all over.\u201d Some even closed their eyes, tears flowed down their cheeks silently.A man does not easily shed tears.Except, when something truly depressing had happened or was happening.Sometimes, dreams were so fragile that they were like the reflection of the moon in the well\u2026One could only look at it but never reach it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thus, improving their grade and quality!]Lin Jiufeng looked at the sword case.His eyes lit up.The function it had was just too powerful and convenient.After all, he had a lot of treasured swords.The Demon Slaying Sword and the bone swords.Especially the bone swords\u2026There were a total of 365 of them, and they were all stored within Lin Jiufeng\u2019s dantian, slowly being nurtured by his cultivation base.But this method of nurturing them would definitely not be as fast as nurturing them in a proper sword case.Not only could the sword case repair the damage done to the swords in it, but it could also improve the quality of the swords. Over time, the power of the swords stashed within it would also be increased.It was akin to killing several birds with one stone!This was a good thing.Lin Jiufeng decisively took out the 365 bone swords and placed them into the sword case along with the Demon Slaying Sword.The space within the sword case was vast, and it could hold countless swords.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s treasured swords didn\u2019t take up that much space inside.The sword case still looked the same, as if a bunch of swords wasn\u2019t just inserted into it.Its weight also remained the same, one could carry it on one\u2019s back\u2026Hold it in one\u2019s hands, or store it in one\u2019s dantian.Lin Jiufeng looked at the sword case. He planned to fill the entire space of the sword case with swords in the future. When he needed them, he would just directly summon tens of thousands of swords out of nowhere. It would definitely be a sight to behold.\u201cThe reward from signing in this time is quite good. I hope I can get enough treasured swords from signing in the future.\u201d Lin Jiufeng walked out of the underground palace in a good mood.Then, he continued to quietly ponder about the Great Dao of the world in the Cold Palace.He still had a lot of room for improvement.\u2026In the Yuhua God Dynasty, Emperor De had always received education, wisdom, and knowledge from the court officials in the past five years. At the age of 18, he was already married. This marriage was arranged by the Empress Dowager.His wife was a gentle and understanding woman who could surely manage a family.But most importantly, she was a woman that Emperor De liked.The Empress Dowager knew the consequences of forcing the Emperor to marry a woman he didn\u2019t like.She had experienced it back then.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that she had given Lin Tianyuan love and Lin Jiufeng had taught him a lesson, she might not have become the Empress Dowager of today\u2019s dynasty.Hence, she gave Emperor De the right to make his own choice.Within a certain range, she allowed him to choose his own Empress.After their marriage, the Empress Dowager gradually relinquished her power and let the Emperor continue to learn from the court officials on how to be a proper emperor.But Emperor De was more interested in cultivating and becoming stronger to reach the summit of the martial path than being a good emperor.Under a stroke of luck, Emperor De encountered the Sect Leader of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect. He became the disciple of this Sect Leader and he earnestly learned from him how to cultivate.The Zenith Heaven Path Sect also taught Emperor De with great care.The Sect Leader personally gave him pointers.Emperor De advanced by leaps and bounds and became full of confidence in himself.Emperor De believed that he was a genius in this era.Because of Emperor De, the Zenith Heaven Path Sect gained a stable foothold in the Yuhua God Dynasty.Of course, other than teaching Emperor De, the rest of their positions were just empty titles.The court officials allowed them to enter the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s Imperial Court.But they didn\u2019t allow the Zenith Heaven Path Sect to control the state affairs.The Empress Dowager had the same idea.She wouldn\u2019t allow it either.Hence, the Zenith Heaven Path Sect could only build a sect outside the Imperial Capital.There, they started to settle down.Today, Emperor De journeyed into the Zenith Heaven Path Sect to study with his Teacher, Sect Leader Luo Yu. He was there to learn how to make a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm.The 18-year-old Emperor De was already about to make a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm. But this was all due to the vast and bountiful resources that he had access to.Combined with his own talent, the resources of the Yuhua God Dynasty, and Sect Leader Luo Yu\u2019s guidance. It would be strange if he couldn\u2019t cultivate this fast.\u201cYour Majesty. What you only have to do right now is to adjust your body so you can reach its peak state. At the same time, you have to keep a tight seal on your vital energy so that it wouldn\u2019t leak out. Only if these conditions are satisfied can you make a breakthrough.\u201dSect Master Luo Yu gave his advice.Emperor De was a handsome young man who inherited the genes of both Emperor Ming and Emperor Yuan.He looked a little similar to Lin Jiufeng too.When he heard Sect Leader Luo Yu\u2019s words, his face couldn\u2019t help but turn red.He hurriedly said, \u201cMaster, I\u2019ve been slightly slacking off recently\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be more careful in the future.\u201dHe was newlywed, and the wife he married was someone he chose himself. Her wife was definitely someone that he liked. With the couple deeply in love with each other, it was inevitable that they would have frequent trysts.But these activities seemed to have also become the reason for the leakage of his vital energy, preventing him from maintaining the peak state of his body. As a result, he was unable to make a breakthrough into the next realm.Sect Leader Luo Yu saw through Emperor De\u2019s problem in an instant and he even pointed it out.Seeing the embarrassed Emperor De, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh out loud. \u201cYour Majesty\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s natural for humans to have sex. There\u2019s no need to be shy\u2026\u201d\u201cMoreover, Your Majesty also needs to have an offspring. It\u2019s just that you have to control yourself for the next three months. This way, making a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm won\u2019t be a problem for Your Majesty.\u201dEmperor De replied rather seriously, \u201cI understand\u2026\u201d\u201cThank you for your guidance, Teacher Master.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, please take a look at the newly-established sect of our Zenith Heaven Path Sect. You can take a stroll around to familiarize yourself with the surroundings and to also ease the worries in your mind,\u201d Sect Leader Luo Yu said with a smile.\u201cOkay. Goodbye, Teacher Master.\u201d Emperor De nodded and turned to leave.Sect Leader Luo Yu looked at the departing Emperor De with a calm look on his face.\u201cYou have successfully gained the trust of this little Emperor.\u201dAn old Daoist priest walked out from behind Sect Master Luo Yu.A look of satisfaction was on the Daoist priest\u2019s face.\u201cAs long as you are willing to treat others sincerely, they will definitely be able to feel it\u2026\u201d\u201cThis little Emperor has his own opinions and it\u2019s not that easy to brainwash him. But he values relationships, so we should groom our relationship with him and we can then slowly control the Yuhua God Dynasty through our connection with him,\u201d Sect Master Luo Yu said softly.\u201cNot a bad plan, but I heard that the court officials, cabinet ministers, and even the Empress Dowager do not like our Zenith Heaven Path Sect interfering in the state affairs of the Yuhua God Dynasty,\u201d the old Daoist priest said.\u201cA group of corrupt scholars, a group of old people, and a mere woman\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to care about?\u201d Sect Leader Luo Yu said in disdain.\u201cI just have to make Emperor De dance on the palm of my hand. I\u2019ll use my relationship with him to solicit and slowly gather the most precious treasures out there in the world. Then, I\u2019ll slowly unseal the powerhouses of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen that time comes, the Yuhua God Dynasty would become nothing but a mere secular god dynasty in front of our Zenith Heaven Path Sect. If we are not satisfied with their performance under us, we could just replace them with another dynasty.\u201dSect Leader Luo Yu coldly explained.His Zenith Heaven Path Sect wasn\u2019t willing to become a mere subordinate of the Yuhua God Dynasty.What he wanted was to turn the entire Yuhua God Dynasty into a huge follower of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect, making the Yuhua God Dynasty become the Zenith Heaven Path\u2019s subordinate instead.In this new era, the Zenith Heaven Path Sect would definitely flourish.\u201cI\u2019m relieved that you\u2019ve thought about it this way. I\u2019m just afraid that you will develop feelings for this little Emperor.\u201d the old Taoist priest was satisfied by the explanation.\u201cI\u2019m someone from thousands of years ago. Would I change my mind because of an 18-year-old child?\u201d Sect Leader Luo Yu said disdainfully.When he was with Emperor De, he taught him sincerely.But his sincerity was only there for the sake of rewards.Once there was no reward nor any benefit to gain, he would immediately fall out with Emperor De.\u201cLet\u2019s wait for a few more years\u2026\u201d\u201cWe have recently just established ourselves. Right now, we need to slowly accumulate our strength and dig out the powerhouses of our Zenith Heaven Path Sect one by one\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is our first priority.\u201d\u201cBut for now, let\u2019s continue our integration to the Yuhua God Dynasty,\u201d Sect Master Luo Yu said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The only drawback that they have is that they died too early\u2019Emperor De didn\u2019t want to repeat the old ways of his Father Emperor and Grandpa Emperor.Emperor Yuan and Emperor Ming were definitely wise rulers.They reformed and managed the world, and also pulled the Yuhua God Dynasty back from the brink of collapse.Their achievements were undeniable.However, both Emperor Yuan and Emperor Ming lived very short lives.Their reforms were completed by the efforts of both of them.Each of them had only lived for ten plus years as emperors, even adding the sum of their reigns only amounted to 30 plus years.Emperor De didn\u2019t want to follow the same path as his father and grandfather.Hence, while he was studying politics, he was also very interested in the pursuit of the martial path.He wanted to strengthen his body and live a long life.He wanted to become the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s longest-living Emperor.This was why he was able to resist the urge to live a happy life as a newlywed with his wife.After leaving the Zenith Heaven Path Sect, Emperor De returned to the Forbidden City and sent a letter to the Empress. He informed her that he would be in seclusion for the next three months and that he wouldn\u2019t be going over for the time being.He wanted to practice abstinence for the sake of becoming a Martial Sage.\u2026In the Empress Dowager\u2019s palace, Lin Tianyuan\u2019s Empress had become the Empress Dowager.She was only in her thirties, not old at all.She was at the prime of her age as a woman.But despite her age, she had already matured.She was often dressed in a dignified manner, giving off the air of grace and elegance.As a woman who had been in charge of the state affairs of the Yuhua God Dynasty for several years now. Her skills were irrefutable.She was once able to manage the imperial harem in an orderly manner. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the members of the Mountain Ghost Race had bewitched Lin Tianyuan, the imperial harem would\u2019ve remained peaceful until the end.Management was her life skill.After Lin Tianyuan\u2019s death, she started to manage the state affairs.She handled them very well and in a broad-minded manner, earning the endless praises of the court officials around her.\u201cYour Majesty went to the Zenith Heaven Path Sect again today?\u201dThe Empress Dowager looked at the excited Emperor De and asked.\u201cYes, Mother\u2026 I have found a way to make a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm. Three months later, I will definitely be at the Martial Sage Realm,\u201d Emperor De said proudly.Emperor Dowager was surprised. \u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cOf course! Mother always said that the people of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect have bad intentions, but Sect Master Luo Yu imparted everything he knew to me. He even imparted some techniques suitable for Martial Sages to me\u2026\u201d\u201cIn addition, there has never been an 18-year-old Martial Sage in the history of our Yuhua God Dynasty,\u201d Emperor De said proudly.He trusted Sect Leader Luo Yu very much.The Emperor Dowager\u2019s originally happy mood instantly simmered down.She couldn\u2019t help but speak up, \u201cSon, you are the Emperor. You cannot have such trust in a stranger. Even if Sect Master Luo Yu has no evil intentions towards you, you still cannot fully trust anyone!\u201dEmperor De\u2019s excitement immediately vanished.He could only sigh and reply, \u201cMother is right, I understand.\u201dThe Empress Dowager wanted to say more, but Emperor De directly bowed and said, \u201cI still have to cultivate. I will leave the state affairs to Mother. In any case, Mother is more knowledgeable than me.\u201dThe Empress Dowager watched as Emperor De left in a fit of pique.She sighed helplessly.\u201cHis stubbornness is exactly the same as his father\u2019s, even his pride is also exactly the same\u2026\u201dThe Empress Dowager felt a headache coming her way.Emperor De was just too similar to Lin Tianyuan.Especially his temper\u2026His temper was practically carved out from the same mold as Lin Tianyuan\u2019s.\u201cBut your father has Uncle supporting him, and you don\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cI can contact Uncle, but you can\u2019t. This means that Uncle doesn\u2019t have that much feelings for you. All these years, you\u2019ve been treating that Sect Leader Luo Yu as your backer. What a childish idea.\u201d The Empress Dowager sighed.She was truly worried about this matter.\u2018The people of the plains, and the Xianbei tribes have recently united to form a tremendously powerful force called the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow!\u2019\u201cThe Great Xia Dragon Sparrow had always frequently invaded our borders. The scouts have reported that there is an extremely terrifying existence on their side, and they are about to make a move. They are a force that we cannot afford to underestimate.\u201d\u201cBut you aren\u2019t actually concerned about this matter\u2026\u201d\u201cInstead, you only focused on your cultivation.\u201dThe Empress Dowager felt vexed.Perhaps her son wasn\u2019t suitable to be the Emperor at all, but a true cultivator.But she had no choice.She only had this one son and a daughter.Moreover, the Yuhua God Dynasty had never allowed a woman to ascend to the throne since its establishment hundreds of years ago.So it had to be Emperor De.But his actions gave the Empress Dowager nothing but a headache.\u2018Should I tell him that he has a great-grandfather who is much more powerful than the Zenith Heaven Path Sect?\u2019 The Empress Dowager thought silently.She supported her head with her hands. This subtle action of hers and the worry on her face painted a picturesque scene that no one had witnessed.\u2026Lin Jiufeng was from the generation of Emperor De\u2019s grandfatherThat\u2019s right\u2026It has been decades since he arrived in this world.Lin Jiufeng still couldn\u2019t feel that he had done anything substantial yet, but he already became a great-uncle.Today, the white cat asked Lin Jiufeng about the inner workings of the imperial family.Lin Jiufeng hugged the white cat and slowly explained some of the inner workings of the imperial family.As he talked, Lin Jiufeng suddenly realized that he was already in the grandfather generation.He was Emperor Yuan\u2019s biological elder brother.Emperor Ming was his nephew.Emperor De was his grandnephew.They were from the same lineage.The children of the other princes had little to do with Lin Jiufeng.But the direct bloodline of Emperor Yuan was still relatively close to Lin Jiufeng.Lin Tianyuan only had two children, a son, and a daughter.His son became Emperor De.His daughter was conferred the title of Princess Yulin.Lin Yulin was Emperor De\u2019s younger sister, Lin Tianyuan\u2019s daughter, and the only princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty.She was of noble status.\u201cBut you\u2019ve never seen any of your grandnephews at all,\u201d The white cat said.\u201cWhy should I? They have their own lives to live, and they might never get involved with me in their entire lifetime. Why should I go look for them?\u201d Lin Jiufeng said with a smile.\u201cA lifetime is too long. What you said is too absolute, there are what-ifs in this world.\u201dThe white cat rebutted Lin Jiufeng.\u201cBut I feel that I won\u2019t be able to see them for the rest of my life,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said confidently.He had a lifespan of thousands of years, while Emperor De and Princess Yulin only had a lifespan of a mere hundred years.Moreover, they were both in the prosperous parts of the Imperial Capital, while Lin Jiufeng was in the Cold Palace that no one cared about in the Imperial Capital.How could there be any contact between them?The white cat mumbled, \u201cI have a hunch that you will soon come into contact with your grandnephews.\u201dLin Jiufeng smiled without saying anything.He reached out to stroke the white cat, but he didn\u2019t refute her words.Still, he refused to believe the white cat\u2019s words.\u2026Yuhua God Dynasty, Forbidden City.A beautiful woman dressed in a gorgeous brocade robe with a sweet smile walked into the place where the treasured relics of both Emperor Yuan and Emperor Ming were stored.\u201cThere must be a treasure within Father and Grandpa Emperor\u2019s relics!\u201d\u201cBrother Emperor only knows how to cultivate from day to night and even mocked me for my poor talent. This is simply preposterous. I must find a treasure to become stronger and Brother Emperor will soon come and beg me for help when the time comes!\u201dThe pure young girl excitedly rummaged through the large pile of relics.She was the only princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty, Princess Yulin.She was doted on since she was young, but she didn\u2019t develop an arrogant and tyrannical personality. Instead, her personality was considered adorable, childish, and empathic.She also knew how to take pity on strangers.All in all, she was a very cute girl.\u201cHuh, what\u2019s this? Why is it in Grandpa Emperor\u2019s treasured relics?\u201d Yu Lin suddenly found a key.It was very old and it wasn\u2019t an item from the palace.She looked at it curiously.\u201cIt\u2019s the Key to Lord Zhenbei\u2019s palace!\u201dPrincess Yulin frowned and thought carefully.She had heard of this name before.\u201cLord Zhenbei, isn\u2019t this a lord who was disinherited many years ago?\u201d\u201cThis lord was imprisoned in his own palace and died of insanity. His palace became the Cold Palace from then on.\u201d Princess Yulin frowned slightly.\u201cWhy did Grandpa Emperor keep this key?\u201d\u201cHe even kept it in such a hidden place.\u201dPrincess Yulin\u2019s eyes gradually lit up.It seemed that she had discovered a great secret.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore, he usually wouldn\u2019t go to observe the entrance of the Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng knew which day Dachun would come every month.Dachun would always come at a fixed interval, he wouldn\u2019t disturb him if it wasn\u2019t time.As a result, Lin Jiufeng and the white cat didn\u2019t notice a little fairy walking in front of the Cold Palace\u2019s entrance today.Princess Yulin held an old key in her hand.She looked around and said, \u201cThis must be Lord Zhenbei\u2019s abandoned palace. It has been converted into the Cold Palace of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d\u201cSure enough, this palace is really dilapidated. It\u2019s a waste simply leaving all of these here to rot without using them.\u201d Princess Yulin couldn\u2019t help but shake her head.She slowly walked to the door of the Cold Palace and looked at the stone lions that had been ravaged by time. She reached out and wiped them, revealing a layer of dust.\u201cThere are no traces of anyone living here, so why did Grandpa Emperor still keep the key?\u201d Princess Yulin looked at the stone lions in curiosity.The closed doors of the Cold Palace were covered in dust.Inside the door was a lock designed by a skilled craftsman.It could only be opened with a specific key.Princess Yulin pushed the door, but there was no response.\u201cThis key should be able to open it. I shall go in and take a look.\u201dPrincess Yulin inserted the key.Ka! Ka! Ka!The door of the Cold Palace that hadn\u2019t been opened for a long time churned to life.It actually let out a screeching sound as it was being pushed open.Princess Yulin frowned and added more force into her pushing.Boom!The main door of the Cold Palace was directly pushed open.What greeted her eyes wasn\u2019t dirt and grime.Instead, there existed a neat passageway and a courtyard without weeds.This was different from what Princess Yulin had imagined.She looked at this scene suspiciously and remained standing still.In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng and the white cat woke up from their meditation at the same time. They looked at each other in surprise.Someone had entered the Cold Palace!This was something that had never happened in so many years.Lin Jiufeng remembered that since he was banished to the Cold Palace, only people from the Chasing Corpse Sect had sneaked in twice.After those two times, the Chasing Corpse Sect turned tail and didn\u2019t dare to come again.Other than them were Emperor Yuan, Emperor Ming, and the group of four, which was the young monk, the two Daoist priests, and the towering man.Apart from these individuals, no one else had voluntarily entered the Cold Palace.Following Emperor Ming\u2019s death, the doors of the Cold Palace had never been opened for more than five years. They had always been tightly shut.Today\u2026Someone unexpectedly opened the doors of the Cold Palace\u2014and it was strangely a young girl.Lin Jiufeng scanned with her his Divine Soul and saw her appearance.She was an exquisite young lady.She was in her late twenties and her figure radiated nothing but the prime of youth. Her face was covered in the youthfulness of those that were truly young. At this moment, her eyes were filled with curiosity as she observed the Cold Palace.\u201cIs she someone you know?\u201d The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng suspiciously.Lin Jiufeng shook his head and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know her.\u201d\u201cThen, why did she come here?\u201d The white cat curiously jumped onto the wall and quickly approached. When it saw Princess Yulin, her eyes lit up.Even cats knew to admire a picturesque scene.The white cat found it even stranger.This girl looked either rich or noble, the way she carried herself also made it obvious that she came from an extraordinary family.So, why did she come to the Cold Palace that everyone avoided at all costs?The white cat raised her claws.Her sharp claws then shot out.She wanted to protect her own territory.She wouldn\u2019t allow other people of the same gender to casually enter.As long as this woman stepped into the Cold Palace, she would chase her out.Princess Yulin looked at the clean Cold Palace and mumbled, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem like the Cold Palace that people described as a place that can drive anyone into madness. Since Grandpa Emperor left the key behind, it means that he has also been here before\u2026\u201d\u201cThere should be no problem. I\u2019ll go in and take a look.\u201dPrincess Yulin stepped into the Cold Palace.Meow!The white cat called out and was about to attack.She wanted to defend her territory and chase this woman out.Boom!But in the very next moment, space froze.The white cat\u2019s body froze on top of the wall, unable to move at all.\u201cWhy did you stop me?\u201d The white cat asked Lin Jiufeng angrily.She wanted to defend her territory.Every animal was territorial, it was natural for her to do this.Lin Jiufeng reached out and carried her down.He stroked the fuming white cat and said, \u201cYou must not hurt her. She\u2019s not an outsider.\u201d\u201cNot an outsider?\u201d The white cat was confused.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you don\u2019t know her?\u201d The white cat questioned.Her pair of eyes that seemed to contain all the stars in the sky blinked meaningfully.Lin Jiufeng looked slightly embarrassed as he said, \u201cShe\u2019s one of the two people we discussed yesterday.\u201dOne of the two people we discussed yesterday?The two children belonged to Lin Jiufeng\u2019s grandchildren generation, and they were also Lin Tianyuan\u2019s son and daughter.The one who came here today should call Lin Jiufeng \u2018Grand-Uncle\u2019.The white cat was no longer angry. She looked at Lin Jiufeng curiously. \u201cYesterday, a certain someone swore that he would never come into contact with them. But now, your grandnephew is here. You didn\u2019t expect this, did you?\u201dLin Jiufeng remained expressionless and he didn\u2019t speak.The only way to resolve the awkwardness was to pretend that nothing had happened.The expressionless Lin Jiufeng looked a little cold.The white cat angrily knocked her head against Lin Jiufeng\u2019s chest and said indignantly, \u201cYou always use this expression on me. I don\u2019t even want to talk to you anymore.\u201dLin Jiufeng stroked her gently and replied, \u201cI said that there wouldn\u2019t be any contact, so it\u2019s definitely true. She probably just came in out of curiosity to take a look. After she sees that there is nothing here, she would definitely leave.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t plan to meet her?\u201d The white cat was surprised.\u201cWhat should we talk about if we met?\u201d Lin Jiufeng countered.The white cat was speechless.He didn\u2019t know what to say if they met.Just as the man and the cat were bickering, Princess Yulin had already closed the doors of the Cold Palace halfway.Then, she walked along the passageway and passed through the front yard, entering Lin Jiufeng\u2019s resting place.Which was also the courtyard Lin Jiufeng lived in.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat looked at each other, dumbfounded.\u201cThe courtyard hasn\u2019t been tidied up yet!\u201d The white cat blurted out.Lin Jiufeng stepped out and entered the courtyard.He was about to tidy up the place when Princess Yulin pushed the door open and entered.Lin Jiufeng directly encountered Princess Yu Lin.At this moment, the white cat\u2019s breathing came to a halt.But she discovered that Princess Yulin seemed to not be able to see Lin Jiufeng who was standing in the courtyard. She walked straight in and looked around in surprise.The white cat heaved a sigh of relief.If Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want to be discovered, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be discovered.But the courtyard could no longer be tidied up.Princess Yulin blurted out in surprise. \u201cIs there anyone living here?\u201d\u201cThis bed is so cold.\u201d Princess Yulin sat on the frost jade bed and muttered in amazement.\u201cI can feel energy surging in my body just by sitting here for a moment. My cultivation base has also been bolstered for quite a lot.\u201d Princess Yulin\u2019s pleasant surprise continued.\u201cThere are so many books here, what are they all about?\u201dPrincess Yulin saw the books that the Holy Maiden gave to Lin Jiufeng.As she browsed through the books, her expression gradually turned serious, even surprised.In the end, she even covered her mouth.\u201cThis should be the treasure left behind by Grandpa Emperor. I\u2019ve found it!\u201dPrincess Yulin exclaimed in excitement.A brand new world had opened up for her.Both Lin Jiufeng and the white cat looked at each other for a while.In the end, they could only reveal bitter smiles.What should they do with this girl?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had always thought that the Yuhua God Dynasty was very powerful\u2014powerful enough to suppress the world.But the things recorded in these books were simply too shocking and hard for her to accept.It turned out that the Yuhua God Dynasty wasn\u2019t that powerful.In fact, it could even be said that the dynasty was even qualified to be called \u2018strong\u2019.It turned out that there were so many undercurrents in this peaceful world.If the Yuhua God Dynasty wasn\u2019t careful, they could easily be destroyed.It turned out that the number of cultivators was sometimes low and sometimes high.All of these were due to the rise and decline of the world\u2019s spiritual energy.The more she read, the more her horizons were broadened.The way this innocent white flower looked at the world was gradually being reshaped.However, she was quick to adapt to these changes.After confirming that all of these were real, she decisively looked at the world in a brand new way.Her outlook in life has also changed and it also affected her attitude.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat witnessed the entire process.For several days in a row, Princess Yulin was immersed in the sea of books.She absorbed the knowledge contained in this place at a rapid pace.On the contrary, Lin Jiufeng and the white cat became homeless.Both man and cat stayed outside the courtyard for a few days, just so they wouldn\u2019t disturb Lin Jiufeng\u2019s grandnephew.Although she wasn\u2019t Lin Jiufeng\u2019s biological daughter, she was still Emperor Yuan\u2019s biological granddaughter.Therefore, her relationship with Lin Jiufeng was that of a very close descendant.Watching the little girl slowly change from a little white rabbit to a mature fox, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t know what to say.The books delivered by the Holy Maiden contained countless schemes and tricks.Moreover, many of them had been passed down for thousands of years. It all broadened Princess Yulin\u2019s horizons.But in the end, she became exhausted from reading all of these.Her heart was no longer as pure as before.\u201cGrandpa Emperor\u2026 It turns out that our world is actually so turbulent.\u201d\u201cIs it because of the guidance of your spirit in heaven that I discovered the books and this bed here? They are very suitable for me. My cultivation has improved by leaps and bounds in the past few days.\u201d Princess Yulin smiled happily.She had seen many crafty plots and schemes from these books, and these machinations added a lot of different colors to her pure heart.But in essence, she was still that beautiful and kind girl.The quality engraved on a person\u2019s heart and bones wouldn\u2019t be easily wiped away.\u201cI just saw a book that recorded the Zenith Heaven Path Sect\u2019s history. It turns out that it\u2019s a sect that isn\u2019t from this era, but from the previous era. It\u2019s simply terrifying. Those records made me tremble in fear,\u201d Princess Yulin muttered solemnly.\u201cThe Zenith Heaven Path Sect has already gained the trust of my Brother Emperor. He\u2019s just like my Father Emperor, stubborn as a bull. I don\u2019t have concrete evidence, so I won\u2019t be able to convince him to keep his guard up against the Zenith Heaven Path sect.\u201dPrincess Yulin held the book.She really wanted to run over and show it to her Brother Emperor.Unfortunately, her brother was currently in seclusion to make a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm.It would take him at least three months to do so.She wouldn\u2019t be able to see her brother for the next three months.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201d Princess Yulin asked herself, vexed.\u2026Lin Jiufeng couldn\u2019t help but smile when he saw how troubled Princess Yulin was.\u201cShe\u2019s indeed from the imperial family. Even if she\u2019s a woman, upon sensing that there\u2019s a problem with the Zenith Heaven Path Sect, she will still be anxious about keeping a time bomb in such close proximity,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.\u201cShe\u2019s just too weak,\u201d the white cat said.In the past, when Princess Yulin was practicing martial arts, she wasn\u2019t that passionate about it.As a result, she was only at the Innate Realm at the age of 16.\u201cI can help her improve and make her stronger so that she can fight against the Zenith Heaven Path Sect. This way, I won\u2019t have to worry about the Yuhua God Dynasty falling into the hands of others,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.\u201cThen, don\u2019t you have to meet her to do that?\u201d The white cat asked.\u201cNo.\u201d Lin Jiufeng shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t have to meet her. I can just teach her in her dreams.\u201dThe white cat suddenly remembered that Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul was now so powerful that he could suppress her\u2014a Human God\u2014with just a word.Then, wouldn\u2019t it be a piece of cake for him to enter the dream of an Innate Realm cultivator to impact martial arts and teach her?After that, Lin Jiufeng gave his courtyard to Princess Yulin so that she could stay inside.Lin Jiufeng wandered around the Cold Palace with the white cat.Princess Yulin never knew that there was someone else in this Cold Palace.One night, she got tired of reading. In a daze, she came to a world where the clouds floated endlessly in the skies.Standing with his hands behind his back\u2026Lin Jiufeng looked at Princess Yulin and asked with a smile, \u201cDo you want to learn the sword?\u201d\u201cWho are you?\u201d Princess Yulin asked cautiously.\u201cI was invited by your Grandpa Emperor to help you cultivate. This is your dream world,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said softly.\u201cReally?\u201d Princess Yulin looked at Lin Jiufeng suspiciously.\u201cRegardless of whether it\u2019s real or fake, take a look at this sword technique first and see if it suits you.\u201d Lin Jiufeng began to unsheathe his sword.With a stroke of his sword, he directly shattered this dream world.AHHH!Princess Yulin was shocked.She screamed and woke up to find that she was still reading before she nodded off.\u201cIt was really a dream!\u201d Princess Yulin blurted in surprise.\u201cThat strike just now was ridiculously powerful.\u201d Princess Yulin swallowed.Determined, she forced herself to fall asleep.Entering her dream world again, Princess Yulin began to seriously practice swordsmanship with Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strength was unfathomable.It was easy for him to teach and enlighten Princess Yulin.Her strength doubled overnight.Early in the morning of the next day, the awakened Princess Yulin decisively came to the courtyard to practice her swordsmanship.\u201cUltimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill!\u201dThis sword technique was very powerful. After learning it overnight, she only managed to comprehend a little bit of it. But when she unsheathed her sword, it was already powerful enough to become a killing move for her.Only then did Princess Yulin believe that the mysterious man in her dream was someone that Grandpa Emperor had hired to teach her.Hence, she quickly entered her dream once more and continued to learn from Lin Jiufeng.Directly next door sat Lin Jiufeng with a smile on his face. He closed his eyes and his Divine Soul invaded Princess Yulin\u2019s subconscious as he directly entered his dream world. There, he began to teach her once more.With Lin Jiufeng\u2019s current cultivation base, it was a piece of cake for him to teach and enlighten a person.Especially since Princess Yulin shared the same bloodline as him, it wasn\u2019t a problem for her to learn his Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.A month later, Princess Yulin made a breakthrough into the Great Grandmaster Realm.She didn\u2019t even dare to imagine that her cultivation speed could actually be so fast.However, with the help of the abundant spiritual energy of the world and Lin Jiufeng\u2019s guidance along with her diligent cultivation. She was able to achieve such a feat.In the second month, Lin Jiufeng helped her make a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm.When Princess Yulin finally stood at the Martial Sage Realm, she couldn\u2019t seem to believe that she was looking at reality. Everything just seemed so surreal.It was too exaggerated.In two months, she arrived at the Martial Sage Realm from the Innate Realm.It has to be known that her Brother Emperor was also working hard at this moment to make a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm.Yet, she actually managed to break that boundary so easily.And after the third month\u2026Lin Jiufeng continued to teach Princess Yulin to the best of his abilities. In the Martial Sage Realm, Princess Yulin was now invincible with her Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.Three months later from the time he started teaching her, Lin Jiufeng said to Princess Yulin in the dream world. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you to leave. Don\u2019t stay here any longer.\u201d\u201cBut I still want to continue cultivating.\u201d Princess Yulin bit her red lips and refused.\u201cThe scouts from the Yuhua God Dynasty are looking for you everywhere. Something seemed to have happened, you should go out now.\u201d Lin Jiufeng sincerely advised.If she didn\u2019t leave, both he and the white cat wouldn\u2019t be able to return to their courtyard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Considering this, he didn\u2019t hold back and even entered her dreams to teach her the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.Princess Yulin was one of Lin Tianyuan\u2019s two children.The 30-year-old Lin Tianyuan didn\u2019t expect that he would die so young, so he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to have children.But after being duped by the Mountain Ghost Race, his body became weak and it became impossible for him to have any more children.Hence, his eldest son succeeded the throne and his daughter became the only princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Lin Jiufeng thought that he would never see Princess Yulin and Emperor De in his life, but who would have thought that Princess Yulin would come here on her own?Since she had discovered this place on her own, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t mind giving her some pointers to make her stronger.Then, he also let her find out that the Zenith Heaven Path Sect had malicious intentions so that she would target the Zenith Heaven Path Sect in the Yuhua God Dynasty and inform Emperor De of their malice at the same time.This saved Lin Jiufeng the trouble of handling this problem on his own.He could once again continue his peaceful routine.As long as the problem wasn\u2019t that big, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t really want to go out.His routine of beating up those demons in the den and receiving treasures in return didn\u2019t seem bad, was it?1If the Yuhua God Dynasty needed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s help in every problem they encountered, then they would truly be useless.In the end, Princess Yulin left.Lin Jiufeng was right.She had disappeared for three months, and the entire Yuhua God Dynasty was looking for her.1If she still didn\u2019t appear, the entire world would definitely be alarmed.The only princess of the current dynasty actually went missing\u2026If word got out, it would definitely cause a huge commotion.Of course, this was largely because the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s influence was boundless.After the arrival of the new era, countless forces were facing a reshuffle in power. But the number one force in the world\u2014the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2014continued to maintain its huge territory without showing any sign of collapse.This made people click their tongues in wonder.Therefore, if news of the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s princess\u2019 disappearance spread, it would definitely cause an uproar in the world.The entire imperial court was anxious.They searched everywhere, but no one thought of the Cold Palace.Even when they passed by the Cold Palace, no one paid any attention to it.They just ignored it completely.The Cold Palace and Lin Jiufeng really had no presence in the Yuhua God Dynasty at all.But he was also happy about this.After Princess Yulin left, he and the white cat entered the courtyard.Seeing the clean courtyard, the white cat said in surprise, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that the princess who was born with a golden spoon would also know how to clean. I thought that after three months, our courtyard would be very dirty.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at the spotless courtyard and said in satisfaction, \u201cShe\u2019s a good child.\u201dLin Jiufeng really regarded the Princess as his junior.Calculating the time, he was about 60 years old by now.If this was in his previous life, he would definitely be an old man.In fact, he was already acting like one\u2014seeing that he favored outstanding children.\u201cHer arrival was an accident, she probably won\u2019t come anymore. Let\u2019s continue our quiet life here,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said casually.\u201cYou must be dreaming,\u201d the white cat mumbled.Lin Jiufeng pretended not to hear anything.He laid on the frost jade bed and closed his eyes to cultivate.\u2026Princess Yulin came to the Forbidden City and met her brother, Emperor De.\u201cWhere have you been?\u201dWhen Emperor De saw his younger sister, he sized her up carefully. After ensuring that his younger sister wasn\u2019t taken disadvantage of, he suppressed his anger and questioned her.\u201cBrother Emperor, where have you been for the past three months?\u201dPrincess Yulin asked with a smile.\u201cI was cultivating in seclusion to make a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm. Why are you questioning me instead?\u201d Emperor De said angrily.\u201cDid you know how anxious Mother was and how many tears she shed in private?\u201dEmperor De wanted to hit his sister and punish her. But in the end, he couldn\u2019t bear to do so.Princess Yulin scratched her head in embarrassment and said, \u201cI will go and visit Mother. I have my own things to do.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly are you busy with?\u201d Emperor De asked angrily.\u201cSame as you,\u201d Princess Yulin said nonchalantly. She was very excited and wanted to show off, but she suppressed it with all her might and pretended not to care.She looked very cute like this.Emperor De\u2019s anger dissipated under his sister\u2019s cute expression. He sneered. \u201cLike me?\u201d\u201cI broke through to the Martial Sage Realm in seclusion, but as for you, you went out to play, didn\u2019t you?\u201d Emperor De looked at his sister in disdain.\u201cAre you looking down on me?\u201d Princess Yulin raised her brows. \u201cCome, let\u2019s fight. I will let you know that a scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with brand new eyes. Your younger sister is no longer the younger sister of three months ago.\u201d\u201cHave you taken the wrong medicine? Have you gone mad?\u201dEmperor De looked at Princess Yulin strangely.\u201cI\u2019m the youngest Martial Sage in the royal family of the Yuhua God Dynasty, and I\u2019m also the Emperor. You want to fight me?\u201dEmperor De looked at his sister\u2019s delicate body and shook his head in contempt.\u201cAlright, you\u2019ve been looking down on me all the way. Come, receive one strike from me.\u201dPrincess Yulin was furious.She made a sword sign with her fingers and imitated Lin Jiufeng.She directly drew her sword and unsheathed it.Emperor De didn\u2019t take Princess Yulin seriously at all.He only thought that she was fooling around.But in the very next moment, the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill was already out of its scabbard. It brought with it a sonorous sound that reverberated in the surroundings. It was very loud and clear, causing his expression to change drastically.\u201cNot good\u2026\u201d At this moment, Emperor De knew that he had made a mistake.A huge mistake.He really had to look at this younger sister of his in a different light.\u201cEmperor\u2019s Scripture!\u201d Emperor De raised his hand to counterattack.His True Qi condensed and spread all over his body.But in the very next moment, the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill tore through his True Qi.The sword energy that seemed to have turned tangible landed on Emperor De\u2019s neck.The cold sword energy sent chills down his back.He actually\u2026 he actually had no ability to resist at all!Under this sword, he could only wait for his death.Emperor De was horrified. He looked at his younger sister in shock.At this moment, Princess Yu Lin was smiling happily.\u201cBrother Emperor, you were wrong when you said that you were the youngest Martial Sage in the royal family.\u201d\u201cI am the youngest now,\u201d Princess Yulin announced happily.She was only 16 years old\u2014two years younger than Emperor De.Emperor De asked in shock, \u201cYou were only at the Innate Realm three months ago\u2026\u201dPrincess Yulin dispersed the sword energy of the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.With her hands behind her back, she said proudly, \u201cAs I said, I\u2019ve really been busy with something in the past three months. A scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with brand new eyes. Have you changed your opinion of me?\u201dEmperor De looked at his sister whose tail was about to reach the sky.He smiled bitterly and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve given me too many surprises.\u201d\u201cThere are even bigger surprises,\u201d Princess Yulin whispered.\u201cWhat?\u201d Emperor De looked at his sister in surprise.\u201cBrother, leave your guards behind. I will bring you to a place,\u201d Princess Yulin said softly.\u201cWhat place?\u201d Emperor De asked curiously.\u201cI discovered the treasures that Grandpa Emperor left behind,\u201d Princess Yulin leaned over and whispered into Emperor De\u2019s ear.Emperor De\u2019s eyes widened. He looked at Princess Yulin and whispered to her. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cOf course! Otherwise, how could I have broken through so quickly?\u201d Princess Yulin replied.\u201cAnd if you go, you will definitely be shocked. This world isn\u2019t as simple as you think it is.\u201d Princess Yulin smiled mysteriously.\u201cAlright, go and see Mother first. I will wait for you here. Bring me there at night,\u201d Emperor De said solemnly.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll go see Mother first, then I\u2019ll come and find you.\u201d Princess Yulin got up and left.She left the giddy and expectant Emperor De behind.A treasure left behind by Grandpa Emperor?What exactly was it?\u2026Lin Jiufeng, who was cultivating with the white cat, had no idea of this scene.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He wore a dust-free suit with a snow-white collar.On his shoulder stood the little white cat.This scene was silent and picturesque as if it was from a painting that had come alive.But such a beautiful scene was broken by the sound of opening gates.Dong!The gates of the Cold Palace have opened once again.The sound immediately scattered the painting-like scene.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat looked at each other, speechless.Lin Jiufeng scanned with his Divine Soul and discovered that the person who opened the door was Princess Yulin.She left in the morning and immediately came back in the evening?Meow!The white cat called out. She looked at Lin Jiufeng and remembered what Lin Jiufeng said in the day. She couldn\u2019t help but snicker.Back then, she said that Lin Jiufeng was being too idealistic.Sure enough, as the white cat predicted, Princess Yulin came again.But the white cat didn\u2019t think that she would come so soon.\u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d The white cat asked Lin Jiufeng.\u201cLet\u2019s observe for now. She didn\u2019t come here alone,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said softly.He saw the young man behind Princess Yulin.Emperor De!Even though Lin Jiufeng had never seen Emperor De before, he still recognized him at first glance.Emperor De looked a little similar to himself.He also had that temperament and the dignity that belonged solely to an Emperor.Even though Emperor De still wasn\u2019t directly handling the state affairs yet, he had accumulated quite a lot of experience from the guidance of the court officials.\u2018Did Princess Yulin bring Emperor De here to let him see the true colors of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect?\u2019 Lin Jiufeng thought silently.The power of his Divine Soul distorted the space around him.He stood still with the white cat.Princess Yulin closed the door of the Cold Palace and was about to walk in\u2026When Emperor De spoke curiously, \u201cThis is the Cold Palace. The sinners of the royal family are imprisoned here. Why did you bring me here?\u201dPrincess Yulin said, \u201cI brought you here to let you see the treasures that Grandpa Emperor left behind. There\u2019s no one in the Cold Palace anyway.\u201dPrincess Yulin\u2014who had lived here for three months\u2014didn\u2019t discover Lin Jiufeng at all.\u201cIs there no one else in the Cold Palace?\u201d Emperor De looked around curiously.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019ve been living here for three months now.\u201d Princess Yulin nodded.\u201cBut when I was studying history, I remember very clearly that about 40 years ago, a crown prince made a mistake and his cultivation was destroyed. He was then banished to the Cold Palace. Until now, there has been no news of his death.\u201dEmperor De followed Princess Yulin in as he spoke.\u201cYou also know that it was about 40 years ago. At that time, even Father Emperor hadn\u2019t been born. It has to be traced back to Grandpa Emperor\u2019s generation.\u201d Princess Yulin said.\u201cDo you know why I remember this matter?\u201d Emperor De asked Princess Yulin.\u201cWhy?\u201d Princess Yulin didn\u2019t understand.\u201cBecause strictly speaking, the dethroned Crown Prince imprisoned here is the biological elder brother of Grandpa Emperor, they were born from the same mother. In other words, he is our Big Grand-Uncle.\u201d Emperor De explained to Princess Yulin.\u201cNo wonder Grandpa Emperor hid the treasures and secret manuals here. It\u2019s probably to pay respects to this Big Grand-Uncle who was banished to the Cold Palace,\u201d Princess Yulin replied in understanding.\u201cProbably\u2026\u201d Emperor De shook his head, not wanting to think about the whereabouts of the dethroned Crown Prince who was imprisoned here.Perhaps it was really as Princess Yulin had said.After 40 years, there was a possibility that he was already dead.\u201cThese two cherry trees are quite beautiful, they are in full bloom.\u201dEmperor De looked at the two cherry trees outside the courtyard.He took a deep breath of the refreshing air.\u201cThey bloomed while I was living here. It might have been planted by our Big Grand-Uncle,\u201d Princess Yulin said with a smile.Emperor De nodded and looked around.He didn\u2019t find anything, so he followed Princess Yulin into the courtyard.Meanwhile, Lin Jiufeng and the white cat watched them silently from under the cherry trees.\u201cThey called you Big Grand-Uncle.\u201d The white cat whispered into Lin Jiufeng\u2019s ear.\u201cPrincess Yulin probably brought Emperor De here to read the books. She wanted to let him know about the Zenith Heaven Path Sect\u2019s scheme,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.He didn\u2019t chase them out.It was good for Emperor De to know the origins of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect, so he would be on guard against them.This way, Emperor De wouldn\u2019t be so foolish as to be deceived by the Zenith Heaven Path Sect.If this happened, then only the end awaited the Yuhua God Dynasty.Lin Jiufeng would also have fewer troubles to think of.He wouldn\u2019t have to save the Yuhua God Dynasty from being destroyed.Just like that, Lin Jiufeng and the white cat stood under the cherry trees.They watched as Princess Yulin brought Emperor De along to look through the pile of books that recorded the previous era in great detail.From his initial surprise and disbelief to his subsequent silence, Emperor De\u2019s face then turned cold.\u201cBrother Emperor, this book specifically recorded the matters of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect. You should take a look at it carefully,\u201d Princess Yulin said softly.Emperor De reached out and took it.He was speechless for a long time before he slowly opened the first page.Everything about the Zenith Heaven Path Sect was recorded in great detail.\u201cThey deceived me!\u201d Emperor De gritted his teeth.Princess Yulin said, \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable that every court official and even Mother opposed the Zenith Heaven Path Sect. It\u2019s not too late for you to become aware of their true colors.\u201dEmperor De didn\u2019t say anything.He read the entire book seriously.His good impression of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect disappeared.\u201cSister, thank you.\u201d Emperor De thanked Princess Yulin seriously.If it wasn\u2019t for Princess Yulin showing him these, he would never believe that Sect Master Luo Yu was so good to him only because he had selfish motives.\u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as you\u2019ve come back to your senses. Besides, there\u2019s no need to thank me. You should thank Grandpa Emperor. This is definitely the treasure that Grandpa Emperor left for us,\u201d Princess Yulin said with a smile.Emperor De looked around but he didn\u2019t respond.\u201cSister, it\u2019s going to be daybreak soon. Let\u2019s go back. Let\u2019s not touch anything here for now.\u201dEmperor De looked at the moonlight.It was already close to dawn.They spent the entire night reading books.Lin Jiufeng spent the night under the cherry trees.Fortunately, Emperor De and Princess Yulin soon left and closed the doors of the Cold Palace.They didn\u2019t bring these books with them.Of course, even if they did, Lin Jiufeng wouldn\u2019t mind.He had memorized the contents of the books by heart, so it didn\u2019t matter whether the books were still here or not.\u201cThis time, no one should come here anymore. We can finally continue our cultivation in peace.\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at their departing backs and muttered in satisfaction.The white cat rolled her eyes at Lin Jiufeng. \u201cYou said the same thing before.\u201d\u201cJust watch if you don\u2019t believe me.\u201d Lin Jiufeng was still very confident this time.To this pair of siblings, this Cold Palace wasn\u2019t that useful anymore.Sure enough, Lin Jiufeng was right.For the following month, neither Princess Yulin nor Emperor De came to the Cold Palace.The Cold Palace\u2019s peace finally returned.Lin Jiufeng could also finally continue his routine of signing in every day.One month later, Dachun came to see Lin Jiufeng.He brought with him a piece of news that shocked Lin Jiufeng and the white cat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s a powerhouse that rose to prominence on the plains and is considered to be very powerful.\u201d\u201cHe also has the support of the Essence Qi Sect. With their help, he unified the plains and he now has a million armed troops under his command. All of them are very fierce.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be winter soon. The plains are suffering from a snowstorm that hasn\u2019t been seen in a thousand years. It\u2019s very cold. Countless sheep, cows, and even the Xianbei people froze to death.\u201d1\u201cSo this Murong Ling gave the order to invade the Yuhua God Dynasty before winter\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the peace talks, Murong Ling is coercing the Yuhua God Dynasty to help them if the latter didn\u2019t want an invasion. He even said that he wanted to marry the princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty to form a good relationship.\u201d1\u201cThis is the most major event that happened in the last month\u2026\u201dDachun explained.Lin Jiufeng frowned.He recalled the time when he rushed to the plains and killed Martial Sage Tumen on the Celestial Mountain.All of it was also because Martial Sage Tumen had unified the plains and wanted to invade the Yuhua God Dynasty upon the arrival of winter and heavy snow.At that time, the court officials of the imperial court were locked in a fierce stalemate.Each one of them had their own reasoning, and no one could convince the other on what to do.Emperor Ming had no choice but to come and beg for Lin Jiufeng\u2019s help.This led to the story of him entering the plains on a snowy night, killing Martial Sage Tumen on the Celestial Mountain, and entering the Life-Knowing stage with one strike.He thought that this story would be enough to force the Xianbei people to submitBut decades later, the Xianbei tribes were united once again.Their force was more dangerous, and their ambitions were also greater than before.They led an army of a million and threatened to invade and plunder the Yuhua God Dynasty.And they even shamelessly asked to marry Princess Yulin in exchange for peace.There was only one princess in this generation of the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2014that was Princess Yulin.Lin Jiufeng had already met her here in the Cold Palace.He even entered her dreams and gave her pointers for three months while also teaching her the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill, making her invincible among the Martial Sages.It could be said that Princess Yulin was Lin Jiufeng\u2019s successor.She was related to Lin Jiufeng by blood, and she also practiced Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill.Lin Jiufeng naturally couldn\u2019t sit still and do nothing.Lin Jiufeng would never agree to let a girl like her, who was akin to a fairy in the moonlight, marry someone from the plains in such a humiliating manner.\u201cHow did the Yuhua God Dynasty react to this matter?\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s expression turned slightly cold as he asked.Dachun sighed. \u201cMost people in the imperial court and even the public are in favor of marrying Princess Yulin off to seek respite from the threat of invasion.\u201d1Lin Jiufeng\u2019s expression turned even colder.With a cracking sound, he crushed the cup in his hand.\u201cYour Royal Highness. The Xianbei of the past and the current Great Xia Dragon Sparrow are indeed quite powerful, especially the Essence Qi Sect. I don\u2019t know where they came from, but they have hundreds of Human Gods. They are all acting as a deterrent force at our borders.\u201d\u201cOnce we reject them, the millions of people at our borders will suffer a great catastrophe.\u201dDachun explained the conundrum of the imperial court to Lin Jiufeng.If they chose to fight, it would last throughout the dead of the winter, just like when Emperor Ming fell into trouble back then.Once the war started, the number of deaths from the war would definitely be inconceivable.Therefore, when it came to reducing losses, marrying a princess to save the people from war was a logical choice.But that was just the rational aspect, there was still the emotional aspect to be considered.\u201cWhat did Emperor De say?\u201d Lin Jiufeng took a deep breath.He knew that anger was useless.The matter wasn\u2019t so simple that it would be over with a casual refusal.If he wanted to prevent Princess Yulin from marrying over, he had to find another way to deal with the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow.Moreover, the price of this method was small, at least within the limits of what the Yuhua God Dynasty could withstand.\u201cEmperor De naturally isn\u2019t agreeable about it, but the court officials are advising him to do it. It has been a long time since Emperor De has appeared publicly, and it is said that he has been cultivating like crazy.\u201d Dachun sighed.Emperor De was truly cultivating like mad.He wanted to improve himself to eliminate the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow.\u201cWhat a simple-minded kid.\u201d Lin Jiufeng shook his head.At this moment, Emperor De should be thinking of a solution.He had to show perseverance and quickly make a decision, instead of hiding and cultivating.\u201cEmperor De hasn\u2019t said anything yet, that\u2019s why the court officials are arguing with each other. Every day, they ask His Majesty about how to handle this matter.\u201d Dachun shook his head.\u201cYour Royal Highness, I will continue to observe this matter. If there is any news, I will inform Your Royal Highness on my next visit.\u201dSeeing that Lin Jiufeng had already finished eating, Dachun packed up and turned to leave.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat stood solemnly behind the door of the Cold Palace.Meow!The white cat called out and said, \u201cI remember that when I first met you, you went to the plains alone. You can just go there one more time.\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s gaze was faint. He said in a deep voice, \u201cI can go to the plains and solve this matter, but I want to see what Princess Yulin thinks about this matter.\u201dIn this matter, the only key person was Princess Yulin.She was the one being sacrificed, so Lin Jiufeng wanted to see her.Speak of the devil.Princess Yulin slowly walked over and appeared outside the Cold Palace. She looked a little lonely as she took out a key and opened the gates of the Cold Palace.Then, she walked past Lin Jiufeng and the white cat before entering the courtyard.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat once again became invisible, Princess Yulin couldn\u2019t see them at all.\u201cShe\u2019s not in a good mood,\u201d the white cat said.\u201cIt would be a miracle if she\u2019s in a good mood,\u201d Lin Jiufeng muttered.Lin Jiufeng brought the white cat into the courtyard.He then heard Princess Yulin\u2019s aggrieved voice.\u201cGrandpa Emperor, the imperial court is forcing me to marry that Murong Ling.\u201d\u201cThey say if I don\u2019t marry him, I will be abandoning the millions of common people at the borders. They will be wiped out by the invasion of the Xianbei army.\u201d\u201cThis crime is too big for me to bear.\u201dPrincess Yulin\u2019s voice was soft and weak.She felt wronged, but she didn\u2019t dare to say it out loud.Should she tell her Mother?Her mother had always been busy dealing with the state affairs.She couldn\u2019t possibly add to her stress and worries.Should she tell her Brother Emperor?Her Brother Emperor would directly disagree.But the consequence of disagreeing was that the common people at the borders would be implicated.There seemed to be only one path in front of her.The marriage alliance!Princess Yulin felt so wronged that she could only come here and pretend to talk to Grandpa Emperor.She hid in a corner all alone and hugged her own knees, feeling aggrieved.Seeing this scene, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes flashed.He said softly, \u201cWhat\u2019s your own opinion?\u201d\u201cMysterious master!\u201d Princess Yulin looked around in surprise.She remembered Lin Jiufeng\u2019s voice. She had heard it in her dream for three whole months.She looked left and right, but she didn\u2019t find anyone.She only thought that the mysterious master\u2019s body no longer existed and that he only had his spirit left in this world.\u201cIf there\u2019s no other choice, I will naturally marry him,\u201d Princess Yulin replied.She was a princess and was born in the royal family.Naturally, she had a lot of responsibilities to bear.Although she felt wronged, she had to consider the safety of the millions of common people.\u201cWhat about the Zenith Heaven Path Sect that you told me about?\u201dLin Jiufeng continued to ask.\u201cThey said that they are no match for the Essence Qi Sect that\u2019s backing the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow. They can protect the Imperial Capital, but they are unable to solve this problem,\u201d Princess Yulin said calmly.Ever since Emperor De found out about the truth of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect, they gradually became distant from each other. The Zenith Heaven Path Sect also wasn\u2019t foolish enough to become enemies with the Essence Qi Sect just to please Emperor De.\u201cWhat do you think I should do?\u201d Princess Yulin asked Lin Jiufeng for help.\u201cGo to the plains,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Princess Yulin blinked. Was this the only choice left?\u201cGo to the plains yourself and carve out a path of blood. Cut off the head of this so-called Great Xia Dragon Sparrow.\u201d\u201cSince they are coveting your beauty, then you should go there personally,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said calmly.But his eyes were cold.\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026\u201dPrincess Yulin shook her head. She wanted to, but she was only at the Martial Sage Realm.She could do it with her current strength before the recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy.But now, with so many Martial Sages in the world and the existence of Human Gods slowly becoming so widespread, this feat was impossible for her to fulfill all alone.\u201cThere\u2019s a sword case in the house. Bring it with you to the plains and focus on killing the enemy. Leave the rest to me,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This sword case is my armory. Go to the Plains and just focus on killing. Leave the rest to the sword case,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.Princess Yulin raised her head and looked at the empty surroundings.She revealed a smile and said firmly, \u201cMaster, I shall go to the Plains right now. I won\u2019t kill people randomly. As long as I can kill that Murong Ling and make the people of the Plains afraid of me\u2014that will be enough.\u201dWith her mysterious master supporting her, she became more confident.Instead of getting married off to live a miserable life, she might as well give her all this time for a chance to turn her fate around.\u201cGo!\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied in satisfaction.Since she wanted to resist the opposition, he would lend her a hand.He conquered the Plains and the Xianbei tribes decades ago.And now, they just changed their name and they were planning to rebel once again?This time, Lin Jiufeng could similarly suppress the Plains from the Imperial Capital.As long as Princess Yulin was determined to move forward, he would be able to tear everything in front of her apart.\u2026Princess Yulin left with the sword case.She went to the palace and found Emperor De.Emperor De was cultivating diligently.He hated himself for being too weak.\u201cSister, I won\u2019t marry you off. You are so powerful and talented, you are the future hope of the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d Emperor De said firmly when he saw Princess Yulin.Princess Yulin smiled gently.After experiencing these things, she had grown up and shed her previous naivety.\u201cBrother Emperor, I\u2019m going to the Plains,\u201d Princess Yulin said softly.\u201cNo, I won\u2019t allow it!\u201d Emperor De looked at Princess Yulin in shock and shook his head.\u201cAre you listening to the bullcrap of those corrupt scholars? Let me tell you, they\u2014\u201dEmperor De said in a hurry.But before he could finish his words, he was interrupted by Princess Yulin.\u201cIf I don\u2019t go to the plains this time, then wouldn\u2019t the millions of people at our borders encounter a great catastrophe?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I will think of a way!\u201d Emperor De gritted his teeth and looked at Princess Yulin.\u201cBig Brother, trust me this once. In my name, spread the news to the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow\u2019s Murong Ling. I will go to the Plains alone to kill him. If he wants to marry me, then he should show me his true ability.\u201d Princess Yulin smiled radiantly as she said to Emperor De.Emperor De looked at Princess Yulin in shock.This delicate and fragile girl was actually so domineering?\u201cYour cultivation base\u2026\u201d Emperor De said worriedly.\u201cTrust me, Big Brother!\u201d Princess Yulin shouted firmly.She stopped calling him \u2018Brother Emperor,\u2019 instead, she changed it to \u2018Big Brother\u2019.They were born to the same mother, and they were the ones closest to each other.Emperor De was at a loss for words.He felt conflicted.\u201cApologize to Mother for me. I\u2019m leaving now, there\u2019s no need to worry about me.\u201dPrincess Yulin turned around and left. This time, she didn\u2019t hide her aura at all.The aura of a peak Martial Sage Realm expert directly rushed out of the Forbidden City and out of the Imperial Capital.Not long after, a shocking imperial decree came from the Forbidden City.Princess Yulin went to the Plains alone to kill the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow\u2019s Murong Ling.If Murong Ling wanted to marry her, he would have to catch her on the Plains.This was absolutely shocking.Marriage alliances have always been a common thing since ancient times.It was also common for people to go back on their words in marriage alliances.But this was unprecedented.The princess involved in the marriage alliance was going to kill the other party by herself and even said that if he caught her\u2014she would marry him.As soon as this imperial decree came, the world was thrown into an uproar.Countless people discussed it.It was also Princess Yulin\u2019s first time officially walking into the eyes of everyone.It was just that her image seemed blurry to the eyes.\u2026The Zenith Heaven Path Sect was located on a mountain on one side of the Imperial Capital.The Sect Master, Luo Yu, also heard the news about this imperial decree.He totally disregarded it.\u201cI\u2019ve seen Princess Yulin before. She\u2019s just a small cultivator in the Innate Realm, a soft and weak little girl. She\u2019s only 16 years old. I can see that she\u2019s just messing around,\u201d Sect Master Luo Yu said in disdain.The old Daoist priest sitting opposite him chuckled. \u201cShe\u2019s just a little girl after all. She\u2019s being wishful. The crucial part is that Emperor De is also cooperating with her. This Yuhua God Dynasty really has no future of it\u201d\u201cI have already started infiltrating into the imperial court of the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2026\u201d\u201cAfter I\u2019ve controlled them, I will be able to control the cabinet ministers and that will also include Emperor De. This kid has been on guard against us recently. Could it be that he had noticed something?\u201d Sect Master Luo Yu coldly snorted.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. As long as we managed to dig out the powerhouses of our Zenith Heaven Path Sect, the Yuhua God Dynasty isn\u2019t worth mentioning. Have you found where our powerhouses are yet?\u201dThe old Daoist priest waved his hand and asked.He did not place the Yuhua God Dynasty in his eyes at all.\u201cI\u2019ve found it\u2026\u201d\u201cMore and more powerful sects are appearing in the world as we speak. Even the Essence Qi Sect powerhouses of the Plains have appeared. It has only been a few years since the recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Heavenly Dao Sect truly has gone into a decline. They are not capable enough at all,\u201d Sect Master Luo Yu said mockingly.The old Daoist priest chuckled. \u201cWe only have this chance because the disciples from the Heavenly Dao Sect aren\u2019t good enough\u2026\u201d\u201cOtherwise, if they discovered where we were and we were really sealed by them for hundreds of years resulting in us missing a few great opportunities, that would be a huge loss to us.\u201dSect Leader Luo Yu nodded.They then started to discuss other matters.What was their opinion of Princess Yulin\u2019s actions?They unanimously agreed that she had lost her mind doing such a stupid thing.If she was caught, wouldn\u2019t she still need to marry Murong Ling?Since that was the case, why didn\u2019t she save herself some face?Why did she insist on finding trouble for herself?When the King of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow\u2014Murong Ling, \u2014heard this news\u2026He laughed out loud in glee.\u201cShe\u2019s indeed a tough nut to crack. Mobilize the army\u2019s powerhouses and catch her. I want to teach her a good lesson.\u201d\u201cYou want to kill me? Are you worthy?\u201dMurong Ling said with a smile, but the cold light in his eyes truly looked terrifying.This was his first time being humiliated like this by none other than a little girl.Since she was a tough nut to crack, he decided to break her legs and lock her up at home.After he was done playing with her, her life and death would no longer matter to him at all.\u2026Most people in the world treated Princess Yulin\u2019s words as a joke.They were all mocking Princess Yulin and Emperor De.They were indeed siblings.They had gone mad together.But Princess Yulin didn\u2019t care about their thoughtsBringing with her Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword case, she arrived at the Plains in less than a day with the help of her cultivation base at the peak of the Martial Sage Realm.The snowstorm arrived\u2026The entire plains were covered in heavy snow.The temperature was very low. Even though she was in the Martial Sage Realm, she could still feel the coldness of the air on her skin.Her nose had turned red from the cold, and her hands holding the sword case seemed to be trembling.But she continued her journey with firm determination in her heart.Her target was the capital of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow, Wolf Storey Mountain!\u201cMaster said that I only need to focus on killing the enemy and that I should leave the rest to him. I believe in Master.\u201d Princess Yulin\u2019s gaze remained steadfast.On her first day in the Plains, she had already encountered people from the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow Army.A Human God!He had been waiting for her long ago.He looked at Princess Yulin indifferently as he spat in disdain, \u201cI can see you at a glance in the vast snow. Come back to Wolf Storey Mountain with me. I don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201dPrincess Yulin put down the sword case and calmly unsheathed her longsword.\u201cI have only truly used the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill that my Master imparted to me once\u2014and it was inside my dreams. But so what if the opponent is a Human God?\u201d Princess Yulin\u2019s eyes were resplendent, like pieces of jewelry.Reflected within her retina were the scenes of Lin Jiufeng unsheathing his sword\u2026Along with his movement, Princess Yulin also unsheathed her sword.A streak of sword energy streaked across the world and it slashed down directly.Pu!A streak of blood splattered across the vast expanse of snow, dying the snow crimson-red.\u201cMaster wasn\u2019t lying when he said to me that the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill can split the sky into two and cut down gods!\u201dPrincess Yulin exclaimed jubilantly.Unfortunately, no one could hear her voice\u2026Princess Yulin lifted the sword case and continued on her journey.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This discrimination would be amplified given that Princess Yulin was from the royal family\u2014if this happened, then their reputation would truly be dragged across the mud.But the truth was too distant from everyone\u2019s expectations.Before Princess Yulin entered the Plains, she didn\u2019t say a word.She ignored the rumors from the outside world and focused on her objective.After entering the Plains, she only struck once.This strike allowed her to cross the threshold between a Martial Sage and a Human God.Defeating the strong with the weak!The world was shocked by this lone strike.Was this Princess Yulin that everyone was talking about\u2014the Innate Realm cultivator who was playing around and overestimating herself?She entered the Plains and executed a strike and she killed a Human God with just this single strike?Although the recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy had intensified, and there were more Human Gods in recent years, the world was still so vast.Therefore, a Human God was still a rare and powerful existence.Yet she killed him with one strike?Ridiculous\u2026The world was yet again thrown into an uproar.They were now looking at Princess Yulin in a different light.Her trip to the Plains that they originally disregarded had now become their focus\u2014the focus of the entire world.When Sect Leader Luo Yu heard about this, he was dumbfounded.Slaying a Human God with one strike, was she still that delicate Princess Yulin?In Wolf Storey Mountain, Murong Ling flew into a rage and scolded. \u201cIdiot!\u201d\u201cHe couldn\u2019t even defeat a 16-year-old girl, and not only that but he was even killed by a single strike! He has simply thrown away the prestige of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow. Send out a stronger powerhouse. I want to see her here in three days.\u201dThe powerhouses of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow finally paid attention to this matter.More footprints appeared on the pure white snow.Princess Yulin carried a sword case while trudging towards Wolf Storey Mountain.Wolf Storey Mountain looked majestic and magnificent.Princess Yulin saw it from a distance.The night had already come, and she didn\u2019t continue on her way.Instead, she chose a cave and lit a bonfire.The blazing bonfire raised the temperature of the cave.Princess Yulin rubbed her hands with a flushed face. She spent her entire day walking in such coldness that it became a rare opportunity for her to kindle a bonfire to warm herself up amidst the heavy snow and cold.\u201cThe temperature has dropped too much in this heavy snow. I\u2019m at the Martial Sage Realm, but after walking in the snow for an entire day, my body has gone cold too. Those ordinary people are indeed pitiful living in such a harsh environment like this\u2026\u201d Princess Yulin lamented.But as emotional as she was, Princess Yulin still didn\u2019t like those who wanted to live by plundering or taking the lives of others.\u201cI must go to Wolf Storey Mountain and kill that Murong Ling. Once he\u2019s dead, the Xianbei people will be afraid and they won\u2019t dare to harass the people of the Yuhua God Dynasty anymore,\u201d Princess Yulin said firmly.The outside world was as black as an inkstone.From time to time, mournful cries could be heard along with quick and violent trumpets.A cold voice came from the snowstorm.\u201cI\u2019m afraid you won\u2019t be able to kill him!\u201d A Human God from the Plains walked over.\u201cYou truly cannot kill him. Just be obedient and become our King\u2019s plaything.\u201dA second Human God walked over.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we became Human Gods. In fact, we are the first batch of people to become Human Gods, not that clown in the Imperial Capital of your Yuhua God Dynasty who doesn\u2019t even dare to show his face.\u201d The third Human God ridiculed.The three Human Gods arrived together.On the snowy night, while braving the wind and snow, they found Princess Yulin.The three of them were very powerful Human Gods.They were more powerful than the Human God that she met and ended.The man that Princess Yulin killed was a newly-minted Human God.These three were Human Gods that ascended into the Human God Realm a long time ago.Each of them was formidable, and they all surrounded Princess Yulin.Princess Yulin looked at them and her heart couldn\u2019t help but sink.She was only a peak Martial Sage Realm, how could she possibly deal with three Human Gods on her own?She placed her hand on the sword case.This was her only source of confidence.\u201cYour Royal Highness, please come out! Come back with us to Wolf Storey Mountain and marry the King.\u201d The first Human God calmly announced.He moved and blocked Princess Yulin\u2019s escape route.\u201cWe won\u2019t hurt you, but we hope that you won\u2019t fail to appreciate our kindness.\u201dThe second Human God threatened.\u201cEvery year when it snows, many people will freeze to death. The results of the negotiations with the Yuhua God Dynasty this year will depend on your performance today.\u201dThe third Human God sneered.Three Human Gods sealed the exit.They stared at Princess Yulin, making her hair stand on end.Rumble!The snowstorm outside became more rapid and violent.The air had become even colder, it seemed to be symbolizing death itself.Princess Yulin suddenly recalled Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words.She only needed to focus on killing the enemy and that she should leave the rest to the sword case.Princess Yulin\u2019s eyes lit up.Thinking of Lin Jiufeng, the fear and the coldness in her body slowly disappeared.This sword case was given to Princess Yulin by Lin Jiufeng.It contained all of his treasured swords.This was her source of confidence!\u201cI reject every condition that you lot have offered.\u201dPrincess Yulin shook her head directly, then she decisively opened the sword case.Buzz!The long swords in the sword case emerged.They all exuded a sharp and chaotic aura.The treasured swords had been nurtured.Since then, they had only become even stronger.Just as she opened the sword case, a faint shadow appeared behind Princess Yulin.It was Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul which he had taken out and placed in the sword case.The sword case opened and his Divine Soul appeared.\u201cMaster!\u201d Princess Yulin shouted in surprise.This was the first time that she saw Lin Jiufeng\u2019s appearance.As she thought, he was indeed an otherworldly expert\u2026A powerful and fierce man.\u201cLook carefully. I taught you before that the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill can split the sky into two and cut down gods.\u201d\u201cYou killed a Human God with your own strength, but you have no idea how to split the sky.\u201d\u201cBut today, let me show you the true power of the Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword!\u201d1Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul grabbed the Demon Slaying Sword from the sword case.Then\u2026He unsheathed the sword!The resulting sword energy was 30,000 miles in length.\u201cThe world is vast and I only have this one sword\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, my sword energy is 30,000 miles long!\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul fiercely announced.1The three Human Gods looked at the sword energy that seemed to split the sky into two.Indeed, it was 30,000 miles in length.They were beyond dumbfounded.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The people in the Wolf Storey Mountain were all in their rooms, surrounding their stoves while chatting.They all looked forward to their gains after plundering the Yuhua God Dynasty.But no one expected that a sword energy would suddenly shoot over from afar.Like a thunderclap, it streaked across the sky.The cold sword energy illuminated the night, its brightness was reflected within the retinas of those that witnessed its fleeting might.They seemed to have seen the purest thing in the world.It was so beautiful, flawless, and surreal.The whiteness of the snowflakes couldn\u2019t compare to this sword energy.Countless Xianbei people witnessed this sword energy that spanned 30,000 miles.Its brightness lasted for a long time.Every light on Wolf Storey Mountain was instantly kindled.Countless people ran out and watched in surprise.\u201cSword God!\u201dThe Xianbei people fell to their knees under this sword energy.On the other hand, the complexions of some of the powerhouses changed drastically.They sensed that something was amiss and they hurried on their way.30,000 miles wasn\u2019t a long distance for a Human God.They arrived in less than 15 minutes.But what greeted their eyes made the Xianbei powerhouses tremble.The biggest mountain in front of Wolf Storey Mountain had been cut off at this moment, the top half had crashed onto the ground.The cut was extremely smooth and flat.The heavy winds whistled.Against the background of this sword energy, the whistling winds themselves seemed terrifying, making one tremble in fear.The snow tonight was especially cold and fierce.A Human God discovered the cave and saw the extinguished bonfire.His gaze was faint as he looked at the spot where Princess Yulin had previously sat.Here, the residual charm of the sword energy still lingered.It made his entire body feel as if he had fallen into an icy cavern.The storm outside continued.He couldn\u2019t help but raise his head to take a look. His eyes focused as he looked in the direction of Princess Yu Lin\u2019s position.He happened to see the beautiful and flawless sword energy that remained in the air.\u201cDead,\u201d the Human God said with bitterness in his mouth.He discovered the three Human Gods that had surrounded this place.They were vaporized by the sword energy.Not even their ashes were left behind.But their auras remained.As the snowstorm swept across, their auras became fainter and fainter.After a while, they disappeared.The few Human Gods that rushed over looked at each other.\u201cJust how powerful is this princess?\u201d A Human God swallowed his saliva and asked in shock.\u201cWhy do I feel that something big is about to happen?\u201d Another Human God asked worriedly.The others shook their heads, unable to answer this Human God\u2019s question.On this snowy night, some were speechless, some were shocked, some were angry, and some were puzzled.After Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strike, Princess Yulin saw the three Human Gods melting into the void.She knew that Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strike just now was for her to see.Killing these Human Gods was just something he casually did along with the process of displaying that particular move to her.The Human Gods were like ants in front of Lin Jiufeng.\u2018Master\u2026 Just how powerful are you?\u2019\u201cAnd why does Brother Emperor look so similar to you?\u2019Princess Yulin wasn\u2019t stupid.After seeing Lin Jiufeng, she easily thought of the connection between her brother and him.Lin Jiufeng and Emperor Yuan looked incredibly similar.Even Emperor Yuan\u2019s son\u2014Lin Tianyuan\u2014didn\u2019t look that similar to Lin Jiufeng.But unexpectedly, Emperor Yuan\u2019s grandson looked very similar to Lin Jiufeng.\u2018I will set this aside for now and think about it in the future. With Master\u2019s help this time, I will definitely be able to solve this problem.\u2019 Princess Yulin thought.Those who worked hard enough would definitely be rewarded.Thus, she continued on her journey to Wolf Storey Mountain.As she walked, she was also trying to comprehend the move Lin Jiufeng displayed just now.Brilliant and invincible, that lone move alone made one tremble from the bottom of their hearts.Princess Yulin vividly remembered how Lin Jiufeng executed that move.Slashing the heavens, splitting the sky into two, and cutting down gods.The Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill was worthy of its title as one of the strongest sword techniques in the world.With her mind focused on comprehending that move earlier, Princess Yulin seemed to have forgotten the cold in this harsh environment. As she walked, she couldn\u2019t even feel the cold snowflakes landing on her skin.It was because as her understanding of that move grew, the chilling sword energy in her body also grew more powerful as it shot out and protected her against the cold.\u201cFrom now on, you must constantly unsheathe the sword in your heart. Draw, slash, draw, slash, and accumulate your aura that is constantly growing stronger as we speak. If you can do this 10,000 times before you arrive at Wolf Storey Mountain, you would achieve the minimum standard required to seamlessly execute this sword technique,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.Princess Yulin\u2019s eyes lit up as he nodded. \u201cYes, Master.\u201dDraw the sword, slash out.Draw the sword, slash out.Draw the sword, slash out.Princess Yulin walked in the snow.She didn\u2019t fly, nor did she use any movement techniques to move faster.Every step she took created a pit in the snow.She spent most of her time drawing her sword in her heart.Every stroke required her to treat it with all her heart and soul.She could slash out the sword if she didn\u2019t make a single mistake.One sword after another, it never stopped.Princess Yulin worked very hard.She traveled through the night.The journey to Wolf Store Mountain should\u2019ve only lasted a short while considering her cultivation base.But she walked for an entire night without ever reaching it.Traversing in the snow, practicing the sword in her heart\u2026With a sword case on her back, the delicate and beautiful Princess Yulin remained stubborn deep down in her bones.She continued to walk in peace and determination.But the outside world was thrown into an uproar by that sword energy last night.The 30,000 miles long sword energy shocked the world and the Plains at the same time.Overnight, the news spread like wildfire.In the Forbidden City of the Yuhua God Dynasty, Emperor De was shocked upon receiving the news.Then, he started to laugh out loud.His younger sister was indeed formidable.The court officials were also shocked by this news.Entering the Plains in the daytime, she killed a Human God.At night, she killed three Human Gods.She even slashed out a sword energy that was 30,000 miles in length.Was she still the Princess Yulin who looked very cute when she smiled?The Sect Leader and the old Daoist priest of Zenith Heaven Path Sect were both speechless.Two pieces of news came in a day, each more shocking than the other.That Princess Yulin whom everyone thought was overestimating her own capabilities had stunned the world with her own performance.\u201cThere must be someone guiding her from behind. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t be able to do such a thing!\u201d Sect Master Luo Yu said through gritted teeth.The old Daoist priest nodded and asked, \u201cWho do you think it is?\u201d\u201cThat hidden old fellow in the Imperial Capital. He was the one who dealt with the demons five years ago. It must be him!\u201d Sect Leader Luo Yu said firmly.\u201cIt seems that he is very powerful,\u201d The old Daoist priest said coldly, \u201cwe must find him. He will be an obstacle to our goal of swallowing up the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d1Sect Leader Luo Yu nodded. \u201cI will\u2026\u201d\u2026As the world was discussing Princess Yulin\u2026She had already arrived at the foot of Wolf Storey Mountain.\u201cSince ancient times, several generals have fought their way here. They intimidated Xianbei and battered them up until they couldn\u2019t even lift their heads.\u201d\u201cBut no woman has ever done it before.\u201d\u201cToday, I\u2014Lin Yulin\u2014will be the first to do so!\u201dPrincess Yulin\u2019s face turned red from excitement.She was still cute and lovable.A 16-year-old girl couldn\u2019t be sexy, but she was akin to that of a fairy.Her words rang loud and clear with a clear-cut determination to follow through with her goal.On the base of Wolf Storey Mountain, Princess Yulin carried the sword case on her back.Then, she took out her own sword from her waist.Her gaze was firm.Then, she drew the sword!With her eyebrows raised sharply, she slashed out!After drawing the sword 10,000 times in her heart\u2014the aura she accumulated all this while directly burst out.Boom!On the base of Wolf Storey Mountain, Princess Yulin stepped into the Human God Realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She\u2019s here!\u201d\u201cWhat a powerful aura, she\u2019s at the Human God Realm.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s just a Human God! How did she manage to kill three Human Gods and melted them with a single sword energy that spanned for 30,000 miles?\u201d1\u201cInform the King! He will capture and bring her into his harem! He shall give birth to his children in droves!\u201d1\u2026On Wolf Storey Mountain, countless discussions were made.The huge Wolf Storey Mountain could easily accommodate a million people.But now, they were all alarmed by Princess Yulin\u2019s sword energy.Her boundless sword energy continued to become even stronger.It rose and lifted Princess Yulin into the air, the scene made her look as if she was a Martial Goddess.She raised her head, her eyes were bright and full of spirit.Who said that women were inferior to men?She\u2014Princess Yulin\u2014was also a cultivation genius.In just half a year, she went from a princess at the Innate Realm to a Human God.Although it was mainly because her master taught her well, it would still be useless if she didn\u2019t have enough talent.Princess Yulin\u2019s confidence was greatly boosted at this moment.Rumble!Her clothes fluttered and her hair danced in the wind.The aura around her was tremendous and vast, making her look valiant and brave.She spread her arms and the sword energy that seemed to be able to pierce the sky appeared behind her once more.It suppressed the entire Wolf Storey Mountain.\u201cHow insolent!\u201dOn the summit of the Wolf Storey Mountain was a white palace.Not far from the white palace was a red palace.The two biggest factions of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow lived in these two separate palaces.The King of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow lived in the White Palace.He handled the state affairs and managed the huge Great Xia Dragon Sparrow.The people of the Essence Qi Sect lived in the Red Palace, presiding over the rituals, treatments, and the preaching of the Dao in Xianbei.This was the unchanging theme of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow\u2026The White Palace handled the state affairs and the Red Palace focused on the Dao.The cold shout just now came from the White Palace.King of the White Palace\u2014Murong Ling!He saw just how bold this Princess Yulin was.She actually dared to raise her sword energy against the Wolf Storey Mountain.This was a blatant provocation to the Xianbei people.In the hearts of the Xianbei people, Wolf Storey Mountain was their sole holy land.This was also the reason why the various powerhouses from the dynasties of the Central Plains wanted to fight their way to Wolf Storey Mountain and intimidate the Xianbei people.But 99.9% of them were killed by the latter.1And now, Princess Yulin was also challenging the Xianbei people.As Murong Ling shouted, a boundless suppressive aura came crashing down.It was as if the sky itself had collapsed onto the earth down below, causing it to crack.\u201cA Human God trying to fight against the Wolf Storey Mountain?\u201d\u201cI shall suppress you and catch you here to bear children for me. With your talent, it will be a huge loss if you don\u2019t give birth to more than 10 or maybe even 20 children.\u201dMurong Ling\u2019s large hand came down.It carried with it his majestic and boundless aura as well as the piercing cold winds.Princess Yulin\u2019s face turned slightly cold. She looked at the imposing aura that was so vast that it seemed to be able to completely cover the sky.She stopped in her tracks.\u201cDon\u2019t stop. Continue forwards. You must do this all the way in one go.\u201dLin Jiufeng has been silently paying attention all this while.At this crucial moment, he reminded Princess Yulin.Whenever one was in the middle of an activity with the knowledge that they would inevitably fail, it was better if they might as well go all-in for a chance to win.If she retreated now, she would really be at the mercy of others.She would be unable to control her own fate by then.Princess Yulin clenched her fist and screamed.The aura around her instantly rumbled and emerged.\u201cYou want me to bear children for you? Hope for that in your next life!\u201dPrincess Yulin soared into the sky, bringing with her the boundless sword energies she had accumulated on her journey.Thousands of terrifying sword energies accompanied Princess Yulin as she charged upwards.She was determined, unafraid of the consequences.Boom! Boom! Boom!The air itself exploded as an incomparably terrifying shockwave directly spread for hundreds of miles with Princess Yulin at its epicenter.\u201cAn ant trying to shake a tree\u2026 You\u2019re overestimating yourself!\u201d Murong Ling snorted coldly.His face was cold as he pushed down with one hand and stood in front of the White Palace.He looked down on the people of the world like a lofty god.From the beginning till the end, he remained arrogant.\u201cYou are a Human God. I am also a Human God too. I am more than enough to kill you!\u201dPrincess Yulin carried thousands of sword energies with her as she flew over.The scene was like a meteor shower, but she was the brightest of them all.And this meteor shower appeared in the Mortal Realm to kill the arrogant Murong Ling.\u201cThousands of years ago, I was the brightest star on the Plains\u2026\u201d\u201cI broke through to the Human God Realm in an era where the spiritual energy in the world was in decline\u2026\u201d\u201cThen, I sealed myself for 3,000 years and emerged once more in this brand new era.\u201d\u201cI have the aptitude to become an Immortal and I have the future to become one of the Supremacies. For me to fancy you is a blessing that you won\u2019t be able to cultivate in nine lifetimes.\u201dMurong Ling\u2019s face was cold and proud as he revealed his origins.1\u201cNo matter how tough of a nut you are to crack, you\u2019ll bow down to me!\u201dMurong Ling suddenly clapped with both of his palms.Boom!The mountains collapsed and the earth itself split.The sky itself seemed to have exploded, the scene was pure chaos and pandemonium.The impact of his attack directly swept across everything.\u201cWe are both Human Gods\u2026\u201d\u201cOur realms might be the same, but our pedigrees are different!\u201d1\u201cI am the sky, and you are the earth. We cannot be compared to each other at all!\u201dMurong Ling sneered as he stood on the summit of the Wolf Storey Mountain. Both of his hands were on his back, making him look like a wise powerhouse.He was full of confidence!Rumble!Princess Yulin, who was charging with her sword energies, suffered a head-on attack.Her sword energies collided with Murong Ling\u2019s aura.Under the gazes of millions, cracking sounds echoed non-stop.Her sword energies couldn\u2019t compare to Murong Ling\u2019s aura at all.The earth-shattering force directly shattered all of Princess Yulin\u2019s sword energies.Then, it came crashing down.Just this one strike was enough to make Princess Yulin\u2019s cultivation base explode.She would directly be crippled by this attack.Then, she would become a machine whose sole purpose was to give birth.Facing the attack head-on, Princess Yulin even found it hard to control her own body.Fragments of sword energies danced in her eyes. Endless snow accompanied this terrifying force as it swept towards her, transforming into a snowstorm-like evil dragon that bared its fangs and brandished its claws.The evil dragon was huge as it charged over, wanting to devour and crush her directly with its jaws.She couldn\u2019t move at all.She was just going with the flow.The gap between them was really as huge as Murong Ling had stated.Princess Yulin looked on in despair.The evil dragon was about to approach and devour her in one bite.Clang!At this moment, the sword case on her back fell off.Amidst the wind and snow that filled the sky and in front of Murong Ling\u2019s attack\u2026It swiftly opened.Beams of sword light shot out.These sword lights had a cold white color.Unlike the whiteness of the snowflakes, its whiteness was similar to the color of bones.Beams of sword light weaved with each other, forming a sword formation that supported Princess Yulin\u2019s body.The massive evil dragon charged down and opened its mouth to bite.\u201cSlash!\u201d365 sword lights exploded at the same time.When they converged, they directly pierced through the sky and they also directly shattered Murong Ling\u2019s attack.Rumble!The sword slashed the evil dragon and forced it to explode.Princess Yulin\u2019s eyes lit up.She happily called out. \u201cMaster!\u201dAt the crucial moment, her master saved her one more.\u201cI\u2019m teaching you a sword technique called the Death Bone Sword Technique. Feel it with your heart.\u201d Lin Jiufeng\u2019s voice sounded in Princess Yulin\u2019s ear.Princess Yulin immediately focused on sensing it.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul controlled the bone swords and repeated Princess Yulin\u2019s actions just now.Soaring to the skies!The difference was that Princess Yulin failed despite carrying thousands of sword energies.But Lin Jiufeng only carried 365 strands of sword energy, yet they were invincible.They slashed the stars and the moon before directly arriving in front of the White Palace.\u201cSword, come!\u201dLin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul instantly possessed Princess Yulin as he shouted with her voice.A sound that reverberated throughout the Plains summoned the bone swords.Click!Click!Click!The bone swords actually began to fuse, each of them becoming one.Together, like parts from the same machine, they formed a lone and terrifying bone sword.Lin Jiufeng controlled Princess Yulin\u2019s body and used her hand to hold this large and broad bone sword.Then, he slashed down with all of his might!Boom!!!At this moment, everyone in the Plains felt this extremely terrifying sword energy.Their faces abruptly changed, including Murong Ling\u2019s.His face turned ugly and greenDong, dong, dong!1The bone sword landed, but it didn\u2019t kill Murong Ling.Instead, it directly split Wolf Storey Mountain into two.The earth shook and the mountain itself quivered.The entire Plains trembled.Even those tens of thousands of miles away from the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s borders felt the shockwave running through the earth.In the eyes of the millions of Xianbei people, \u2018Princess Yulin\u2019 had split the Wolf Storey Mountain in two with a single stroke of her sword.The White and Red Palace were now separated from each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His eyes were filled with shock.His pride and his arrogance were shattered by this lone strike.\u201cDidn\u2019t you just become a Human God?\u201d Murong Ling gritted his teeth.His body was trembling and cold sweat drenched his back.He was scared.Fortunately, it wasn\u2019t him who was struck by the sword strike just now.Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be alive.Under the might of that sword, he felt that even if he broke through to the Grotto-Heaven Realm, he still wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand it.Princess Yulin looked at Murong Ling coldly.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words echoed in her mind.\u201cGo and kill him yourself.\u201dPrincess Yulin said in surprise, \u201cMaster\u2026 I\u2019m not his match.\u201d\u201cUse the bone sword. How much did you comprehend just now?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cLess than 10%?\u201d Princess Yulin hesitated and said.Accurately speaking, it was less than one in ten thousand.Well, that was also less than 10%, so she wasn\u2019t lying.\u201cIt\u2019s enough. Use this Death Bone Sword Technique that you\u2019ve comprehended to kill him.\u201dLin Jiufeng said lightly.Princess Yulin could now control her body.She held the bone sword\u2026The great bone sword that was many times taller than her.She held the bone sword like a little girl carrying the world\u2019s most powerful treasured sword.1The little girl treated it like a prized treasure.She looked at Murong Ling, her eyes turning cold.\u201cYou used the millions of people living on the borders of the Yuhua God Dynasty to threaten my Brother Emperor for your own agenda. You even want me to marry you, so you can turn me into a machine whose sole purpose is to give birth\u2026\u201d\u201cBefore I came here to the Plains, I\u2019ve already said that I will kill you. I will return the humiliation you gave me in one go!\u201dAs Princess Yulin\u2019s voice fell, the bone sword in her hand slashed down heavily.She closed her eyes as she recalled Lin Jiufeng\u2019s strike just now.She recalled the entire process.It was deeply and vividly imprinted in her mind.She would never forget it for the rest of her life.She said that she couldn\u2019t comprehend even 10% of it, but she actually didn\u2019t comprehend anything at all.She only remembered the scene of Lin Jiufeng executing it.She just copied his movement.Just like that, she executed the Death Bone Sword Technique.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul watched from the void and he fell into deep thought.It could be said that it looked like the Death Bone Sword Technique, but at the same time, it lacked something crucial that would truly turn it into the Death Bone Sword Technique.But the bone sword made out of 364 bone swords really did display its might.Rumble!The void itself was crushed by the sword.Countless cracks appeared in the void.Click, click, click\u2026Murong Ling was so terrified and frightened that he screamed.\u201cSave me!\u201dHe was the Emperor of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow, the King of Xianbei.Now that he was in danger, why was the Essence Qi Sect absent?The Essence Qi Sect was the same as Murong Ling.They came from the previous era.Because they were factions from the Plains, there were no records of them in the books given by the Holy Maiden, so Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t know about them at all.Of course, even if he knew, Lin Jiufeng wouldn\u2019t care.He would still let Princess Yulin enter the Plains to challenge them.Essence Qi Cannon!1Right after Murong Ling shouted for help\u2014an old man flew out from the Red Palace that had been separated from the White Palace.He was dressed in exotic clothes that represented the plains as his white beard fluttered in the wind.He raised his hand and executed a terrifying move.It was one of the ultimate techniques of the Essence Qi Sect\u2014Essence Qi Cannon!Boom!The Essence Qi Cannon was like a golden sun.It directly came over and collided against the bone sword.Boom! Boom! Boom!But the bone sword didn\u2019t care about this at all.The Essence Qi Cannon crashed against it and when it touched the bone sword, it directly exploded.The snowflakes in the air were torn violently torn apart.But the bone sword\u2019s momentum never slowed down.It continued to slash towards Murong Ling!Murong Ling quickly moved, wanting to escape.\u201cFreeze the void!\u201d Lin Jiufeng whispered into Princess Yu Lin\u2019s ear.1Princess Yulin shouted, \u201cDie!\u201dTrue Qi surged from her body and they all surged into the bone sword.Ding!The bone sword was also very terrifying.Princess Yulin\u2019s True Qi transformed into a sword energy that interweaved in the air.Its boundless might surrounded the area and froze the void.No matter how Murong Ling tried to escape, he remained trapped in the quagmire of frozen void.He couldn\u2019t run away.\u201cYou\u2019re going too far!\u201d Murong Ling roared.Both shocked and angry.He no longer hid his strength.His cultivation base which was at the peak of the Human God Realm\u2014Nirvana\u2014erupted all of a sudden. He raised his hand and struck.Boom!His counterattack was powerful, but he was facing both the bone sword and the Death Bone Sword Technique.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t use this sword technique a lot.It has been decades since he signed in and obtained it, but he had only officially used it twice since then.The first time was more than five years ago.During the chaos caused by the demons\u2019 invasion.That time, Lin Jiufeng summoned the bone swords with a call and displayed the terrifying might of the Death Bone Sword Technique.The second time today.Using Princess Yulin\u2019s hand, he split the Wolf Storey Mountain into two and separated the White Palace and the Red Palace in one strike.The Death Bone Sword Technique was too powerful.Lin Jiufeng usually didn\u2019t have the chance to use it, so he imparted it to Princess Yulin.Seeing Princess Yulin\u2019s execution of the Death Bone Sword Technique, no matter what angle he looked at it. It was nowhere close to the real deal. But just by copying Lin Jiufeng\u2019s actions earlier, she actually managed to stir the bone sword into action.She used the Death Bone Sword Technique with her cultivation base that had just reached the Human God Realm. Together with the bone sword that cooperated with her, she directly clashed with Murong Ling who was at the fourth stage of the Human God Realm, Nirvana.This was a showdown between Princess Yulin and Murong Ling.It was a grudge between them.They had to settle this themselves.Thus, Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t participate.He looked at the old man from the Essence Qi Sect.The old man wanted to intervene and attack Princess Yulin from the outside.This old man was very powerful.Just like Murong Ling, he was at the fourth stage of the Human God Realm, the Nirvana stage.If he attacked and coordinated with Murong Ling, Princess Yulin would definitely be disadvantaged.Hence, Lin Jiufeng flicked his finger.Boom!An ethereal sword energy exploded and directly smashed against the old man\u2019s chest.The impact caused the old man\u2019s body to tremble.He spat a mouthful of blood as a large hole appeared in his chest.His heart was instantly shattered by Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword energy.The old man looked around in confusion.Who killed him?Princess Yulin?She was fighting Murong Ling\u2026Both of them were fighting fiercely against each other in the air.Amidst the snowstorm, Princess Yulin held a ten-meter-long bone sword in both hands as she continuously sent slashes after slashed to Murong Ling. The chilling sword energy forced Murong Ling to defend himself endlessly.He was at a disadvantage and in grave danger.Murong Ling was both furious and humiliated.He wanted to fight back, but Princess Yulin seemed to be even more furious than him.\u201cYou want me to be a machine that will endlessly give birth to your children? Let\u2019s first see if you can survive as I\u2019ll smash your head into pieces!\u201d\u201cWhen I left the Imperial Capital, I said that I will kill you. No one can save you today, I said it!\u201d\u201cDie!\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect that the usually gentle and weak Princess Yulin would become so violent after she became determined to kill.She hugged the bone sword and used it to smash Murong Ling.That\u2019s right\u2026The bone sword in her hand had already become an iron rod.She wasn\u2019t using it like a sword, but as a blunt weapon to smash.If a clean hit landed, Murong Ling would be either dead or crippled.Yet, the shadow of the Death Bone Sword Technique could still be seen in the way she flailed it around.The bone sword also cooperated with her and increased its might.Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mouth couldn\u2019t help but twitch.Princess Yulin changed his Death Bone Sword Technique and turned it into a hooligan-like one.If someone were to tell Lin Jiufeng that this was his Death Bone Sword Technique\u20261He wouldn\u2019t believe it even if he was beaten to death.\u201cDie!\u201d Princess Yulin\u2019s attack finally struck Murong Ling.He dodged as fast as he could, but in the air, the undulations in the void that the bone sword carried with it as it moved proved far too strong for him to handle.Boom!His body was directly turned into a pink mist as a clean hit with the Death Bone Sword Technique landed.Murong Ling has died!The expert from the Essence Qi Sect looked at this scene in a daze.He closed his eyes indignantly as his body swayed left and right before he fell straight down from the sky.He was immediately buried into the pure white snow upon impact.And he had no idea who killed him.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPrincess Yulin killed Murong Ling, the Emperor of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow, and the King of the Xianbei people.An Elder of the Essence Qi Sect also died under mysterious circumstances.Even more ridiculous was that she even split the entire Wolf Storey Mountain into two and separated both the White and Red Palaces from each other with a single stroke of her sword.It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that her destructive capabilities were similar to that of a natural disaster.But in reality, she was just a little girl.A 16-year-old girl.Princess Yulin!The only princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2014her performance greatly exceeded the expectations of everyone.Her petite body, delicate face, and snow-white skin symbolized who she was.1Yes, she was a gentle, beautiful, yet weak little girl.But now, no one believed that this was the case.A gentle and weak girl could wield a monstrous bone sword and smash Murong Ling with it to death?A gentle and weak girl could separate the White and Red Palaces apart from each other with a single stroke of her sword?A gentle and weak girl could split the Wolf Storey Mountain, completely separating the holy land of the Xianbei people into two?The millions of Xianbei people were rendered speechless.No one dared to step forward, including the Essence Qi Sect.The Essence Qi Sect lived in the Red Palace, but they didn\u2019t dare to say a word for fear of incurring the displeasure of Princess Yulin.If they were to be struck by her sword, the Red Palace would be in mortal danger.Snowflakes fell one after another.Princess Yulin\u2019s face was flushed red.She held the bone sword in both hands and slowly looked around.\u201cIs\u2026 is it over?\u201dIt was only at this moment that Princess Yulin came to her senses.Recalling her crazy actions, her small face couldn\u2019t help but turn even redder.Her eyes darted around, wanting to see if her mysterious master was still around.She had vented her anger. Her upbringing, her age, and her inexperience told her that\u2014Her actions just now had been too crazy.And her master saw it too!Carrying a bone sword that was more than ten meters long, she stepped into the air to smash and slash.Back then, she felt great.But now\u2026She was feeling shy.Her neck, ears, and even her entire body turned red from shame.She looked as if the heat from her embarrassment would cook her entire body.Seeing this scene, Lin Jiufeng shook his head with a smile.This descendant of his was quite adorable.1[Do you want to Sign-In at the Wolf Storey Mountain?]A line of words appeared before Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes.\u201cSign in!\u201d Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t expect that his Divine Soul could sign in too.He agreed decisively.It would be a waste not to do it.[Sign-In successful. Received Dark Mandara Technique!]Lin Jiufeng frowned.A stream of information entered his Divine Soul.He gritted his teeth while the knowledge was being absorbed and assimilated by his brain.\u201cAs expected, my Divine Soul is still weaker than my body. It takes a lot of effort for me to absorb the things that I receive from signing in using just my Divine Soul.\u201d Lin Jiufeng lamented.The Dark Mandara Technique was the ultimate technique of the Essence Qi Sect.There was no other technique that was on par with it in the Essence Qi Sect.The Essence Qi Cannon was also one of the Essence Qi Sect\u2019s techniques, but the Essence Qi Cannon was just an ordinary Top Grade technique.The Dark Mandala Technique was the best.\u201cStrictly speaking, the Dark Mandara is only half of the technique\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also the Light Mandara Technique. When combined, they would become the Great Mandara Technique that can contain both dark and light attributes.\u201d Lin Jiufeng felt that it was a pity.Why did the system not give him the other half of the technique?But obtaining the Dark Mandara Technique was already pretty good.This was a Top Grade technique.Even the core members of the Essence Qi Sect weren\u2019t qualified to cultivate this technique.Lin Jiufeng put it away and planned to wait until he received the Light Mandara Technique before merging them into one to form the Great Mandara Technique.With this in mind, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mood improved.He looked at Princess Yulin.Right now, she looked like a little red lobster.White smoke rose from the top of her head.Pfft!Lin Jiufeng found it funny.With a thought, the huge bone sword immediately disintegrated.White bone swords appeared one after another and they all floated into the sword case.Lin Jiufeng also entered the sword case and left a message to Princess Yulin.\u201cGo back. Put the sword case back to its original place.\u201dPrincess Yulin nodded amidst her embarrassment.She knew that her master wouldn\u2019t mention this matter again.Thanks to this, her embarrassment was greatly reduced.She was brought up to be a dignified woman in the future. Considering her upbringing, it would be difficult for her to just ignore everything that had happened.Luckily, her master stopped talking about it.As a result, she didn\u2019t have to find a hole to hide into.Picking up the sword case, Princess Yulin didn\u2019t even say anything to the people closely observing her.She flew into the sky and disappeared from the Wolf Storey Mountain.The people of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow watched as Princess Yulin left.They didn\u2019t dare to chase after her.Looking at the broken Wolf Storey Mountain and the separated White and Red Palaces, all of these told them something\u2026Don\u2019t chase after her.Otherwise, they might not even know how they died.\u201cIt\u2019s over. The Xianbei people will have an even harder time this winter.\u201d\u201cI wonder if the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow will fall into pieces. If it does, Xianbei will be in turmoil for a while again.\u201d Someone sighed.\u201cWho would\u2019ve thought that a 16-year-old princess would be so terrifying?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 The people of the Central Plains are too terrifying. She left without saying anything just now. She must be silently warning us not to invade the borders again.\u201d\u201cEven if we want to invade now, we don\u2019t have the guts and strength to do so.\u201dThe Xianbei people discussed the impact that this matter had on them.The impact was huge.It was even bigger than when Lin Jiufeng killed Martial Sage Tumen decades ago.The Xianbei people were originally in high spirits.They thought that they could definitely take advantage of the Yuhua God Dynasty.This was why they had the courage to offend the Yuhua God Dynasty.But now, they all regretted their decision.If they didn\u2019t provoke the Yuhua God Dynasty, they wouldn\u2019t have attracted that god of slaughter\u2014Princess Yulin.\u2026Princess Yulin returned in a hurry.After successfully breaking through to the Human God Realm, her speed had increased by several folds.Without stopping to take a break, she rushed to the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty from the Wolf Storey Mountain.One day was enough!But the speed at which the news of her victory was transmitted using all sorts of secret techniques was even faster than her\u2014a Human God.Just as she stepped into the borders of the Yuhua God Dynasty, the scouts and spies wrote down the news and relayed it to the countless people who wanted to know of her whereabouts.Imperial Capital, Forbidden City.Emperor De laughed out loud.He held the secret letter as he muttered in excitement, \u201cMother, take a look!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s written very clearly in this secret letter that my younger sister broke the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow by herself and killed the King\u2014Murong Ling! She even split Wolf Storey Mountain into two. The White Palace and the Red Palace were also separated with a stroke of her sword.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s really incredible!\u201dThe Empress Dowager was surprised. \u201cWhen did Yulin become so powerful?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. When she comes back, you can ask her yourself.\u201d Emperor De also felt strange.He wondered if it had something to do with the Cold Palace.But he wasn\u2019t as reckless as he was in the past anymore.He didn\u2019t plan to tell anyone about this until he had thoroughly investigated everything.\u201cThen I shall wait for her return.\u201d The Empress Dowager nodded.\u2026Zenith Heaven Path Sect.Sect Master Luo Yu looked at the message sent by their spies.He was rendered speechless by its contents.\u201cThat Essence Qi Sect is one of the top factions of the Plains, yet they were actually turned upside down by a 16-year-old girl?\u201d Sect Master Luo Yu was thoroughly dumbfounded.He has been continuously slapped in the face by Princess Yulin.Every prediction that he made against her turned out to be incorrect.Seeing the news about Princess Yulin\u2019s victory, he felt incredibly vexed.\u201cWe must investigate the person behind this Princess Yulin\u2026\u201d\u201cHe will be a serious problem to us,\u201d the old Daoist priest said solemnly.\u201cI know\u2026\u201d Sect Leader Luo Yu took a deep breath.He had already made a few mistakes.This time, there would be no more mistakes.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 90Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe people of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect were now looking at the matter at hand with the attention it deserved.Especially Sect Leader Luo Yu.He had personally seen Princess Yulin a few months ago.At that time, Princess Yulin was only an Innate Realm cultivator.She was very pure and kind, just like the ideal younger sister.In the past, Princess Yulin didn\u2019t like to cultivate.She wasn\u2019t as obsessed with individual strength like Emperor De.But ever since she discovered the secret of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect, she became more diligent in her cultivation.Then, with Lin Jiufeng\u2019s help, she became akin to that of a carp leaping over the dragon\u2019s gate.Outsiders couldn\u2019t see Lin Jiufeng\u2019s contributions, they only thought that Princess Yulin was a peerless genius who had been hiding her strength all this time.If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the court officials wanted to sacrifice her in a marriage alliance, Princess Yulin would\u2019ve kept her true strength hidden.The general public didn\u2019t have that many information channels, so they believed in this fabricated truth.Sect Leader Luo Yu of the Zenith Heaven Path Sect, however, never believed it.He vaguely sensed that there was a mastermind behind Princess Yulin\u2019s rise and Emperor De\u2019s sudden coldness to them.The question was\u2014who was that person?Sect Leader Luo Yu immediately thought of the mysterious senior who saved the Imperial Capital five years ago.He wanted to devour the Yuhua God Dynasty after entering it, so he naturally had to know how many powerhouses the Yuhua God Dynasty had.A mysterious expert who lived in seclusion in the Imperial Capital and had saved the Yuhua God Dynasty several times.Could this person be the one behind Princess Yulin\u2019s actions and rise?Sect Leader Luo Yu\u2019s eyes turned slightly cold.He reached out and clenched his fists tightly. \u201cI will catch you, you\u2014clown hiding in the dark.\u201d1\u2026Princess Yulin had come back.She returned with honors.In a day, what she did on the Plains and the Wolf Storey Mountain had spread all over the world.Everyone cheered on her for what she did.It was something to be proud of after all.Splitting the Wolf Storey Mountain!A girl!The Wolf Storey Mountain was the dream destination of many men since ancient times.As long as one was a cultivator, they would always dream of the Wolf Storey Mountain.Ages ago, a young genius managed to accomplish something big and he hailed from the Wolf Storey Mountain. His story was passed down to the next generations, but only a few people could vaguely remember it today.But today, a 16-year-old girl had completed a magnificent in the most violent manner possible.She entered the Plains alone and in a short span of three days, she experienced several major battles. Every battle was earth-shattering, and they allowed her to make a breakthrough into the Human God Realm.Princess Yulin instantly became an idol in the hearts of women.She did what no man could do.When she left the Imperial Capital, no one sent her off.Instead, countless people ridiculed her\u2014saying that she was overestimating her capabilities.But when she returned, the whole world was cheering her on and shouting her name.The common people in the Imperial Capital all came to see her.Seeing the people outside frantically praising her achievements, Princess Yulin felt a little ashamed.She knew how much Lin Jiufeng had contributed to her success in this matter.But she alone took all the credit.She truly found it uncomfortable.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. Nothing would\u2019ve happened if you weren\u2019t courageous enough.\u201dLin Jiufeng comforted her.\u201cMaster. You\u2019re still alive, right?\u201d Princess Yulin suddenly asked.She ignored the compliments of the outside world and focused on the sword case.She wasn\u2019t a fool.Lin Jiufeng had previously said that he was invited by Emperor Yuan to teach her in her dream world. Princess Yulin had truly believed that this was the case.But then, Lin Jiufeng followed her into the Plains and they both fought against the enemies and slaughtered them together.Lin Jiufeng had also revealed his true form.Princess Yulin was even more certain that this was the case.She just never mentioned it until now.Now that they were back in the Imperial Capital, Princess Yulin finally had the chance to ask.Lin Jiufeng laughed out loud. \u201cDon\u2019t keep guessing whether I\u2019m dead or alive. Don\u2019t you realize that you\u2019ve already become a symbol of the Yuhua God Dynasty?\u201dPrincess Yulin didn\u2019t care about anything else. She dismissed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words as she followed up. \u201cAfter witnessing Master\u2019s power, I know that my cultivation base is still very weak compared to the grand scheme of things. I really need Master\u2019s guidance.\u201dPrincess Yulin was just short of telling Lin Jiufeng to continue to be her teacher.But Lin Jiufeng directly refused.\u201cI\u2019ve already taught you everything that I should. You don\u2019t need my help anymore, handle your own matters well and work hard to improve.\u201dPrincess Yulin could only close this fleeting thought of hers.Entering the Imperial Capital, Princess Yulin shook off everyone and placed Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword case in front of the Cold Palace.\u201cIs this okay?\u201dWith her cleverness, Princess Yulin wanted to know where Lin Jiufeng\u2019s real body was.As a result, she stayed close to the gates, waiting for them to open.But Lin Jiufeng never came out nor answered her.He only controlled the power of his Divine Soul to make the sword case float up and enter the Cold Palace.From the beginning till the end, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s true body never appeared.Princess Yulin looked on helplessly.She could only go to the Forbidden City to look for her brother and mother.\u2026Regardless of the disturbances of the outside world, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul returned and immediately entered his body.It was just three to four days that they were separated from each other\u2026While Lin Jiufeng\u2019s real body continued to sign-in in the Cold Palace, his divine soul followed Princess Yulin to the Plains.Then, those things happened.After his body and Divine Soul became one again, Lin Jiufeng let out a long breath.He laid on the frost jade bed, his body still a little weak.His Divine Soul had been gone for too long, he couldn\u2019t get used to it for the time being.He had to slowly get used to it like those saturation divers that didn\u2019t want to get the bends.The white cat had been accompanying Lin Jiufeng\u2019s body for the past few days.She was afraid that something would suddenly go wrong.Many people whose divine souls left their bodies had to protect their bodies well.Otherwise, their divine souls might still exist but their bodies, destroyed or kidnapped by their enemies.If that happened, then it would be difficult to find a replacement to house the homeless Divine Soul. After all, a cultivator had to find a body with a suitable bloodline and sufficient bodily strength that could endure the might of their Divine Soul.\u201cThis matter is finally resolved. I can finally continue my routine in peace,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said happily.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t like the concept of marriage alliances, but he understood the reasons behind it.Now that Princess Yulin had resolved her own problem, the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow didn\u2019t dare to mention anything about the marriage alliance anymore.Weren\u2019t they beaten up badly enough already?Peace had once again arrived in the Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng continued to live the life of a \u2018shut-in otaku\u2019.He continued to sign-In at the demon\u2019s den every day for the sake of treasures.If there was anything that he needed, he would absorb it to improve himself.\u201cHow is it? How\u2019s the scenery on the Plains?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just a cat in the Cold Palace and I haven\u2019t seen such a scene before, so I\u2019m curious!\u201dThe white cat asked curiously.Since her birth, she had never gone to the Plains.And that so-called Wolf Storey Mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s not fun at all. The ground is covered in pure white snow, and I can\u2019t see anything other than snow. It\u2019s not interesting, since you can also see snow in the Cold Palace.\u201dLin Jiufeng shook his head.\u201cThen forget it.\u201d The white cat shook her head and lost interest.Lin Jiufeng hugged her and stroked her ever so gently as usual.Just like that, almost a month passed by.Dachun came to deliver food.Once a month, Dachun would always come.He had always been punctual about his schedule.He brought good food and good wine along with some news.\u201cYour Royal Highness!\u201d\u201cLast month, it was said that the Imperial Court of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow wants to make peace and they asked for Princess Yulin\u2019s hand in a marriage alliance!\u201d\u201cBut no one expected that Princess Yulin would be so powerful!\u201d\u201cShe went to the Plains alone and killed the Emperor of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow and the King of the Xianbei people\u2026\u201d\u201cShe even destroyed Wolf Storey Mountain!\u201dDachun was almost exclaiming as he explained in excitement.Lin Jiufeng and the white cat looked at each other behind the gates.They saw the smiles in each other\u2019s eyes.They didn\u2019t stop Dachun from talking.Instead, they listened quietly.Lin Jiufeng even occasionally said something to contribute to the discussion.All of these were done to prevent Dachun from being too embarrassed in talking about a topic which Lin Jiufeng and the white cat were more knowledgeable about than him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 91Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter returning to the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s life became comfortable once again.Everyone in the world praised Princess Yulin.They proclaimed her as the number one talent in recorded history.A 16-year-old Human God.The 16-year-old princess of the Yuhua God Dynasty.The future guardian of the Yuhua God Dynasty.All the good words and praises in the world were plastered onto Princess Yulin.Every move that she made now made people wonder what exactly her intentions were.No one knew about Lin Jiufeng.But Lin Jiufeng was happy about this arrangement.Today, he went to the demon\u2019s den early in the morning and started his routine.Boom!After defeating the charging demon with one move, Lin Jiufeng ignored the resentment of the demons below and began to sign in.1[Sign-In successful. Received one Grotto-Heaven Great Pill!]Lin Jiufeng immediately checked the pill\u2019s attributes.[Grotto-heaven Great Pill: A pill used to continuously increase the potential of one\u2019s Grotto-heaven to aid in its expansion. Its increase depends on the Host\u2019s overall potential.]Lin Jiufeng muttered in shock. \u201cThis sure is a pleasant surprise. I was just troubled that my Grotto-heaven hasn\u2019t been expanding lately, and it seems to have reached a bottleneck. I didn\u2019t expect to receive such a pill from signing in this time. What a coincidence.\u201d4With the help of the pill, Lin Jiufeng could continue his steady improvement once again.After coming out of the underground palace, Lin Jiufeng walked into his room.He held the Grotto-Heaven Great Pill in his hand as his mind spun.\u201cI\u2019ve been in the Grotto-Heaven Realm for a long time now. Will this pill help me in making a breakthrough?\u201dLin Jiufeng entered this realm five years ago.The Grotto-Heaven Realm had ten levels, which meant that the Grotto-heaven had to be expanded ten times.Ordinary people would form 10 grotto-heavens, but Lin Jiufeng chose to expand his existing Divine Grade Grotto-heaven by 10 times instead of forming 10 grotto-heavens.These were two completely different choices, but there was no doubt that the latter gave a better potential and greater increase in might.2\u2018Twenty to thirty years have passed since that rain. The Holy Maiden has undoubtedly failed in her work in these past few years.\u2019 Lin Jiufeng suddenly remembered the Holy Maiden.1The people of the Heavenly Dao Sect wanted to suppress the people from the previous era to prevent them from prematurely corrupting the brand new era.But there was no doubt that the Holy Maiden, Miss Hong had failed.The Zenith Heaven Path Sect was from the previous era.The Essence Qi Sect of the Plains was also from the previous era.The appearance of these two major sects was enough evidence to say that Miss Hong had failed.One had to know that Lin Jiufeng\u2019s source of information was very limited.He seldom left the Cold Palace to venture out.He was just quietly accumulating his strength in the Cold Palace and he had done all of this ever since he arrived in this world.Even so, he knew that two major sects from the previous era had already appeared in this world. Considering this fact, Lin Jiufeng started to wonder about just how many of those from the previous era had already appeared in the outside world.Moreover, just exactly how many of them were still in hiding until now?1At the end of the day, the brand new era had just started.Only 20 to 30 years have passed since that rain.The children from back then had just become adults and they were mere greenhorns of the martial path.As for the older generations, many of them managed to make a breakthrough into the Martial Sage Realm and even the Human God Realm.However, only a handful of them managed to enter the Grotto-Heaven Realm.Lin Jiufeng had never even heard of anyone who was at the Grotto-Heaven Realm.But this was probably because he was usually ignorant of the outside world. It was understandable, however, for he spent most of his days in the confines of this cold palace.But Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Divine Soul followed Princess Yulin to the Plains once, and he witnessed that the Emperor of the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow was only at the peak of the Human God Realm.In that Essence Qi Sect, there was only a single peak Human God Realm expert.No one among them was in the Grotto-Heaven Realm.\u201cAs time slowly passes, those people will naturally resurface. Those who have surpassed the Grotto-Heaven Realm back then are all hidden beneath the surface of this turbid water, they truly are unfathomable. I still have to work hard to further improve myself.\u201dLin Jiufeng reminded himself.Even though he now had a little bit of strength and seemed invincible on the surface of the turbid water that was also known as the martial path\u2014that was because the monsters underwater were still hidden in its depths.Lin Jiufeng emptied his mind and decided to continue to live in seclusion.He wanted to see how the outside world would change in the coming years.He consumed the Grotto-Heaven Great Pill, closed his eyes, and began to expand his Divine Grade Grotto-heaven.\u2026The outside world was in a flurry of discussion about Princess Yulin.Countless people sought an audience with Princess Yulin.Because of this, she could only hide in the palace and accompany her mother.Of course, with Princess Yulin\u2019s personality.This caused her nothing but endless vexation. She wanted to go out, but she couldn\u2019t.There were just too many people that wanted to meet her.In Empress Dowager\u2019s palace, Princess Yulin chatted with her mother.The Empress Dowager asked Princess Yulin. \u201cHow did you learn all these skills?\u201dPrincess Yulin only replied, \u201cI have a Master who taught me these skills.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person is your Master? Can you invite him to the Yuhua God Dynasty to be a royal consecrator? There won\u2019t be any pressure on him, he just has to help the Yuhua God Dynasty in times of crisis.\u201d The Empress Dowager asked with concern.Although she held the biggest trump card of the Yuhua God Dynasty, it was the trump card that Emperor Ming\u2014Lin Tianyuan\u2014had left for her.She couldn\u2019t rely on this trump card for everything.She needed her own forces to solve her problems.Princess Yulin thought for a while, then she shook her head and replied, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. My master is indifferent to worldly affairs, so there is no way he will agree.\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026\u201d\u201cIn that case, you must build a good relationship with your Master. If the God Dynasty is in danger in the future, you will have the confidence to deal with it,\u201d The Empress Dowager said regrettably.Princess Yulin smiled bitterly.Facing the concern of the Empress Dowager, she could only agree.But in reality, it was no longer convenient for her to go to the Cold Palace.Her Master obviously didn\u2019t want to be disturbed.If she was disobedient, she risked angering her Master.Hence, she chose to spend her time comprehending the two sword techniques that her Master had imparted to her instead of going anywhere else.Ultimate Heaven Slashing Sword Skill!Death Bone Sword Technique!\u201cThe next time we meet, I will make Master look at me in a different light.\u201dPrincess Yulin decided in her heart.\u2026Time was constantly moving and the times were constantly changing.Any topic would soon dissipate in popularity as time went on.The common people of the world lived a busy and anxious life for the sake of a few taels of silver.Regarding Princess Yulin\u2019s matter, they had discussed it, felt proud of it, and gossiped about it before throwing it into the back of their minds.She was a princess.No matter how much they talked about her, they wouldn\u2019t gain anything from it.They still had to live their own lives.The days went on, and after about ten days, the common people weren\u2019t talking too much about it anymore.One month later, this matter wasn\u2019t even mentioned that often anymore.Half a year later, if one didn\u2019t deliberately think about this matter, no one would even remember it.Princess Yulin\u2019s presence had also gone thin as she stayed in seclusion, trying her best to comprehend the two sword techniques.The world was calm\u2014especially now that the Great Xia Dragon Sparrow no longer had the power to invade the borders of the Yuhua God Dynasty.Despite the turbulent undercurrents, the surface of the world remained peaceful.And so, another five years passed.In the past five years, Lin Jiufeng never once left the Cold Palace.Princess Yulin didn\u2019t come to the Cold Palace either.In fact, she didn\u2019t even leave her place.She was completely focused on her cultivation.However, the Yuhua God Dynasty hadn\u2019t been peaceful in the past five years.There were some rebellions and uprisings, some cultivators harmed the common people, and some demonic sects launched their own attacks.Especially the demonic sects.They were extremely terrifying as they swept over the lands this time.After these five years, Emperor De was finally the one handling the state affairs instead of the Empress Dowager.His thoughts had matured quite a lot.He was no longer the same as he was when he was 18 years old.He was no longer focused solely on cultivation.He took over the state affairs from the Empress Dowager and began to deal with them carefully.But he didn\u2019t give up on cultivating either.After five years, the Empress Dowager stayed behind the scenes.She only gave pointers to Empress Dowager behind his back.2She didn\u2019t compete with him for power.If she refused to give her only son his deserved power and continued to control the court with her status as the Empress Dowager, wouldn\u2019t the people call her a greedy wretch then?The Empress Dowager knew that it would be wrong to suppress Emperor De.She knew when to advance and when to retreat.She was smart and full of wisdom.With her talent, knowledge, and wisdom, she could become a solid backer of Emperor De.Hence, she was satisfied with how Emperor De had improved in handling the state affairs.From his immature, and dull start to his current proficiency in the court.The Empress Dowager was content with Emperor De\u2019s character development.The only headache that she had was that she could no longer understand the world itself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/80 Years Of Signing-In At The Cold Palace, I Am UnrivalledCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the past five years, the outside world has been turbulent, including the Yuhua God Dynasty.Only the Cold Palace remained the same.It hasn\u2019t changed that much in the past five years.However, some parts of the Cold Palace\u2019s outer walls had fallen off, revealing the mottled inner walls that showed its fight against time.Some dilapidated houses in the Cold Palace had collapsed.This Cold Palace had a history of more than a hundred years.No one had renovated it for a long time, so it wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary for some part of it to collapse.Fortunately, the courtyard that Lin Jiufeng chose was relatively clean and comfortable.He didn\u2019t plan on switching to another courtyard.After five years, he had long absorbed the Grotto-Heaven Great Pill and expanded his Divine Grade grotto-heaven.He truly stood at the peak of the Grotto-Heaven Realm by now.Ten years ago, he made a breakthrough into the Grotto-Heaven Realm and formed a Divine Grade Grotto-heaven.Ten years later, he finished absorbing the Grotto-Heaven Great Pill and stood at the pinnacle of the Grotto-Heaven Realm.In the past ten years, the only change was that Lin Jiufeng had more or less defeated most of the demons, Demon Kings, and Demon Gods in the demon\u2019s den beneath the underground palace.These 3,000 plus powerhouses from the demon\u2019s den were reputable powerhouses in the previous era. Every one of them were extremely terrifying existences that stood at the top when it comes to power in their own demonic sects.But in this brand new era, they had gotten trapped in the demon\u2019s den where they sealed themselves for hundreds of years and effectively became Lin Jiufeng\u2019s Monster Spawner.One per day.365 per year.After 10 years, Lin Jiufeng had defeated about 3600 demons from this demon\u2019s den.There were only about 10 demons that Lin Jiufeng hadn\u2019t defeated yet.The things that Lin Jiufeng received were mostly different.Most of them were demonic cultivation techniques.There were also some other treasures.For pills, Lin Jiufeng directly consumed them.The pills that he couldn\u2019t eat or were useless to him were then fed to the white cat.The white cat became a peak Human God just from consuming those pills.She was originally an ordinary cat, but after obtaining a heaven-defying opportunity and consuming the pills of the Demon Lord, she became a Martial Sage.But her cultivation speed after that had become extremely slow because her foundation was relatively weak.But even so, after being nurtured by Lin Jiufeng\u2019s vast amounts of pills and treasures, she still managed to reach the peak of the Human God Realm\u2014the Nirvana stage.From this, one could see how many treasures Lin Jiufeng had received from signing in for the past ten years that passed.On this day, Lin Jiufeng came to the demon\u2019s den early in the morning.After five years, Lin Jiufeng was already in his sixties, close to turning 70.Thinking carefully, he realized that he had been in the Cold Palace for almost 50 years now.50 years\u20262This was a large part of an ordinary mortal\u2019s life, and Lin Jiufeng had just spent it in the Cold Palace alone.It was all thanks to his character that he managed to do so.Ordinary people couldn\u2019t possibly endure staying here for so long.He was almost 70 years old, but he looked just like a teenager.His eyes were as bright as the stars and his teeth were pearly-white.He looked just like an elegant and handsome teenager.The white cat didn\u2019t change that much either.But her fur became even more radiant and soft.One could also feel a trace of nobility to it.A single look was all it took for anyone worth their salt to know that the white cat had a formidable bloodline.But in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes, she was just an abandoned stray cat.\u201cWhy are you always going down there every day to fight them? Is it fun torturing them?\u201dThe white cat followed Lin Jiufeng and asked, puzzled.\u201cAm I torturing them?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cYup. You always defeat them with one slap every day.\u201d The white cat nodded.She was thoroughly confused.Lin Jiufeng thought for a while and replied, \u201cI won\u2019t be able to do this to them any longer.\u201dOut of the 3,000 plus Demon Gods, only ten of them remained useful to Lin Jiufeng.10 days later, Lin Jiufeng wouldn\u2019t go to the demon\u2019s den anymore.By that time, even if the demons begged him to come, he wouldn\u2019t pay them a visit.Speaking of this, Lin Jiufeng was a little downcast.This Monster Spawner was about to lose its effectiveness.He would no longer have the advantage of repeatedly signing in there.He had to start looking for other places to repeatedly sign in after ten days.Lin Jiufeng was frustrated.In the end, he directly visited the demon\u2019s den. With a light tap of his toes, the seal of the demon\u2019s den vanished. The 3,000 plus demons below looked at the final 10.Lin Jiufeng hadn\u2019t defeated these remaining 10 yet.The other demons had been taught a harsh lesson by Lin Jiufeng.Compared to 10 years ago when they were indignant and angry\u2026They had already resigned themselves to their fates after so many years had passed.They stopped fantasizing about Lin Jiufeng letting them out as they watched on as he became stronger and stronger. They watched as they remained sealed, unable to absorb the spiritual energy of the outside world.Then, they watched as the gap between them and Lin Jiufeng continued to widen.The 10 demons who were being watched by everyone felt a myriad of emotions surging in their hearts. They felt extremely bitter.\u201cDamn it, we can\u2019t beat him in a fight, yet we must still fight him. How annoying.\u201dOne of the remaining 10 cursed.The others remained silent.\u201cIt\u2019s been 10 years. In these 10 years, we\u2019ve personally witnessed his terrifying strength from the moment he entered the Grotto-Heaven Realm until today. I reckon he is now at least at the peak of the Grotto-Heaven Realm. His improvement is simply too fast,\u201d A Demon God cried out.\u201cI even suspect that he has broken through to the next realm.\u201d\u201cWu, wu, wu~\u201d1Real men never shed tears easily, unless they were truly heartbroken.They were continuously suppressed by Lin Jiufeng for 10 whole years now.These 10 years didn\u2019t pass in a blink of an eye. It involved a painstakingly torturous daily routine where every day, one of them would be beaten up by Lin Jiufeng. Counting the days since he started beating them up, about 3,000 plus days have passed since then.\u201cBack then, I was really not afraid of anything. Even when the Daoist priests from Quan Zhen Sect provoked me, I still dared to kill and rob them.\u201d A Demon King couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and revealed his glorious deeds.This was his proudest moment.\u201cAt that time, the Quan Zhen Sect was very terrifying, they were a sect which even had Immortals at their peak. Even so, I dared to make a move on them. Who would have thought that I would have such a depressing day today?\u201d The Demon King said indignantly.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the previous era, who doesn\u2019t know of my great name, Demon King Pingtian?\u201d\u201cI was one of the Seven Great Sages of the Monster and Demon Race!\u201d\u201cI even participated in the construction of this demon\u2019s den and I did my best to make sure that it is built to last and will be able to maintain its stable state against the test of time!\u201d\u201cNow, I\u2019ve actually trapped myself inside my own creation. I have essentially played myself.\u201d1Demon King Pingtian was quite angry about this.It was only in the end that he realized that the clown was actually himself.The other demons were speechless.What he had done was really akin to digging his own grave in hindsight.Peng! Peng! Peng!Lin Jiufeng knocked on the ground on top.A continuous sonorous sound rang out.Lin Jiufeng then announced.\u201cDon\u2019t reminisce about the past anymore. Hurry up and make your move!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll fight it out with you!\u201d A Demon King in the form of a Tauren roared angrily.He directly charged upwards to fight it out with Lin Jiufeng.His aura was extraordinary and he had the strength of a peak Human God Realm expert.In fact, his realm faintly seemed to have surpassed that of the Human God Realm.In the demon\u2019s den that had been sealed for thousands of years, he was definitely a top existence.But Lin Jiufeng only stretched out his palm and pushed it downwards.Boom!The massive force behind his palm suppressed the Tauren Demon King.The shockwave exploded on his body and he was sent flying onto the ground like a kite with its strings broken.He ended up heavily injured in the ordeal.And even so, this result was Lin Jiufeng showing mercy and not killing him.When the other demons saw this scene, they shook their heads in regret.\u201cHe\u2019s even stronger now.\u201d A Demon God muttered.He felt extremely bitter. He really wanted to go out.But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t give him the chance to do so. He directly sealed the demon\u2019s den.Then, he signed in.[Sign-In successful. Received Sword Driving Technique!]Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes lit up as he said in surprise, \u201cIs this the Sword Driving Technique that can kill enemies thousands of miles away?\u201d[The range of the Sword Driving Technique depends on the strength of the caster. Moreover, the Sword Driving Technique only has one strike. If it cannot kill the enemy, the caster can only proceed to re-execute the strike.]The last sentence was vague, but Lin Jiufeng knew that the opponent would most likely be able to dodge the re-execution of the strike.\u201cThis isn\u2019t so bad either. With this Sword Driving Technique paired with my sword techniques, I will be invincible,\u201d Lin Jiufeng muttered.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t expect that the rewards close to the end of his routine would be this great.With the Sword Driving Technique in hand, Lin Jiufeng was reluctant to leave the demon\u2019s den and the 3,000 plus demons inside.If only he could sign in using each of them twice, how great would that be?1He would definitely cherish that opportunity until the very end!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t feel too bad about being injured. When he was roaming the world back then, he had been injured countless times. But each time, he relied on his tough skin and thick flesh to endure through it.Moreover, because of his special physique, there wouldn\u2019t be any hidden injuries after his injuries healed.Of course, despite his resilience, his mental state was the opposite.Right now, he was depressed.Raising his head in dejection, he asked softly, \u201cAre there still any chances for us, the demons who have stirred up trouble and turned the world upside down back then, to leave this place?\u201dThis question rendered the group of demons speechless.Lin Jiufeng was just too terrifying.The 10 years had left a deep shadow in their hearts.One must know that they were powerful demons\u2014the powerful demons that once ruled over their own regions.\u2026Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t know what these demons were thinking.After signing in successfully, he left the underground palace and went to his courtyard to silently comprehend the Sword Driving Technique.He didn\u2019t want to think about the disturbances in the outside world.Forbidden City!In the Great Council Hall, a group of court officials was arguing about the current state of the world. Demons had once again came out to stir up trouble, and the common people were living in unspeakable misery.They had to be stopped at all costs.But some people also said that the powerhouses sent by the Yuhua God Dynasty had all died while bleeding from their seven orifices. There were no traces of them being injured anywhere else, which was very strange.This alone proved that the demons this time were truly powerful.\u201cYour Majesty. In today\u2019s world, demons are rampant. Not only are there demons, but there are also monsters. It is rumored that the so-called Seven Great Sages of the Monster and Demon Race have appeared\u2026\u201d1\u201cThey are the main troublemakers that we are facing right now,\u201d The Cabinet Chief said.Since Emperor Yuan\u2019s ascension to the throne, he was promoted to the Cabinet.Until now, this Cabinet Chief was still around.He had dedicated his entire life to the Imperial Court and had no male descendants to succeed in his position. His daughter was also already married, so he had his heart set on serving the Yuhua God Dynasty.He was 80 years old this year, but was still energetic and had a clear mind.In fact, he was becoming more and more cunning as he aged.Although his cultivation base wasn\u2019t strong, his knowledge was as deep as the sea.With a scheme, he could make two powerful cultivators fall out with each other and become enemies.He was also the one who taught Emperor De about how to handle the state affairs.Hence, Emperor De trusted him a lot.\u201cTeacher\u2026 What\u2019s the situation with the Seven Great Sages that you mentioned?\u201dEmperor De frowned and asked in a low voice.The demonic sects\u2019 comeback was already causing him endless worries.Now, the so-called Seven Great Sages of the Monster and Demon Race had also appeared.Emperor De immediately guessed that they must be demons from the previous era that had sealed themselves and finally awakened in this brand new era.Emperor De gnashed his teeth in anger.It wasn\u2019t enough for them to rule over one entire era, they still wanted to rule over this era and harm the common people.\u201cYour Majesty, I believe that there\u2019s no need to bother the demonic sects\u2019 in their comeback because they aren\u2019t the main troublemakers this time,\u201d The Cabinet Chief replied firmly.He was already so old. His face was thin and so was his aura.But standing there, his back remained straight.A single look was all it took for anyone to tell that he had been a scholar in his entire life.Not only that, but he was a model example of scholars!This was the best description of him.\u201cTeacher, who are these Seven Great Sages?\u201d Emperor De asked curiously.\u201cThey are the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao. Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens, Demon King Dapeng. Great Sage of the Moving Mountain, Demon King Gui. Great Sage of the Blowing Wind, Demon King Yuan. Great Sage of the White Clothed, Bai Zilong. Great Sage of the Dreaming, Yun Shanhai.\u201dThe Cabinet Chief explained one by one.Emperor De counted carefully and frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s not right\u2026\u201d\u201cThere are only six Great Sages here.\u201dThe Cabinet Chief shook his head and said, \u201cI was also puzzled at the beginning as to why there were only six demons among the Seven Great Sages. But later on, someone found out that the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling, the Heaven Raising Bull, is still missing.\u201d1\u201cAre they very powerful?\u201d Emperor De asked solemnly.The Cabinet Chief replied solemnly, \u201cTheir cultivation bases are all beyond the Human God Realm. Moreover, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao, and the Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens, Demon King Dapeng both said that they would come to the Imperial Capital to ask His Majesty for a piece of land to build a place for the Demon Race to live in.\u201d\u201cIf we don\u2019t give in to their demands, they will replace us with another dynasty.\u201d\u201cWhat daring of them to threaten me?!\u201d Emperor De stood up angrily.\u201cYour Majesty, they are beyond the Human God Realm. The Human Gods that we have nurtured for the past ten years are nothing compared to these Great Sages.\u201d The Cabinet Chief shook his head.Emperor De was speechless.\u201cWill they be here soon?\u201d Emperor De asked through gritted teeth.\u201cYes. During this period of time, I will discuss with the court officials in detail as to which piece of land we should give them. Your Majesty, please bear with it.\u201d1The Cabinet Chief bowed and proposed a solution.Emperor De opened his mouth, wanting to say that he didn\u2019t agree to it.He hadn\u2019t fought a single war yet, but he was already going to lose a huge chunk of the land that his ancestors left behind for him. If he truly lost in this manner, then he would be scolded as an incapable emperor throughout his reign.But looking at the Cabinet Chief\u2019s thin face, it was obvious that he was worried sick over this matter.Emperor De could only agree, afraid of the Cabinet Chief\u2019s health.\u201cThank you, Teacher.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty, I am gratified that you are able to think it through.\u201dThe Cabinet Chief left in satisfaction and went down to start his research.Even if they were to give the demons a piece of land, there would still be some considerations that had to be taken into account.He could use the giving of land as a scheme to get rid of some enemies.1If he really wanted these Seven Great Sages to suffer, it would take some time to devise a plan.\u2026Emperor De felt aggrieved after the Cabinet Chief\u2019s departure.He was the Emperor, but he was being threatened by mere demons.And in the end, he had no choice but to compromise?In Emperor De\u2019s eyes, agreeing to the demons\u2019 request was akin to sacrificing land to seek peace.This was betraying the lands of his ancestors for the sake of his own peace and stability.\u201cIf I can agree once, then I can agree a second time, a third time\u2026 countless times.\u201dAt this moment, a sentence written by a predecessor appeared in Emperor De\u2019s mind.\u201cFive cities are to be given today, then ten cities will be given tomorrow, and then I will be able to sleep in peace for a night. When I wake up the next morning, the army of the Qin Dynasty will once again arrive\u2026\u201d\u201cThe land of the vassals is limited, but the greed of the tyrant Qin Dynasty is unlimited.\u201d\u201cIf I give them an inch, they\u2019ll ask for a mile.\u201d\u201cThe outcome of this war has already been determined without a single casualty nor fight\u2026\u201dIf he behaved cowardly now, the Yuhua God Dynasty could only be bullied by others in the future. By then, its demise would surely be nigh.\u201cNo, I cannot agree to it!\u201d Emperor De said firmly.But then, he became discouraged.\u2018What can I use to deal with the Seven Great Sages of the Demon Race who have broken through into the Grotto-Heaven Realm?\u2019 Emperor De asked himself.The most powerful people under him were only at the peak of the Human God Realm.It was enough to intimidate small factions and small sects.But to use them to threaten the Seven Sages who have broken through into the Grotto-Heaven Realm was merely a pipe dream.\u201cMy younger sister has been in seclusion for five years. I wonder how strong she is now. I should probably go and ask her for help.\u201dEmperor De immediately thought of the Princess Yulin who caused a storm five years ago.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the previous era, they were top powerhouses of the world and were a force to be reckoned with.Now that they have reappeared in this brand new era, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao, and the Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens, Demon King Dapeng were coming to the Yuhua God Dynasty to visit Emperor De.They wanted Emperor De to give them a piece of land.They were relying on their formidable strength to threaten Emperor De into doing this.Unfortunately, Emperor De had to accept the threat.Because he didn\u2019t have any subordinates who were as powerful as them.At the beginning of the recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy, a Martial Sage could already intimidate anyone in the entire world.Ever since that rain, Lin Jiufeng became the first person to step into the Human God Realm.For a long time after that, the Human God Realm became the pinnacle of the martial path.But following Emperor Ming\u2019s death and the invasion of the demons 10 years ago where the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty was surrounded by demons.Human Gods weren\u2019t truly powerful enough anymore.Lin Jiufeng once again lifted the curtain of the Grotto-Heaven Realm.But it was a pity.Perhaps it was because he improved too fast that the common people couldn\u2019t keep up with him. Or perhaps it was because the recovery of the spiritual energy in the world didn\u2019t bring with it the huge amount of spiritual energy needed for others to reach the Grotto-Heaven Realm..After all, the recovery itself would still take time to complete.This was also why the people who unsealed themselves at the beginning were all Martial Sages and Human Gods.The truly powerful ones were all waiting for the spiritual energy to become as vast and as boundless as the sea. Only when the world was completely moisturized with spiritual energy would they come out and display their ambitions into the world once more.Lin Jiufeng entered the Grotto-Heaven Realm 10 years ago, and it was only 10 years later that other people had started to reach the Grotto-Heaven Realm.Emperor De knew that the only person he could rely on now was his sister.After the Zenith Heaven Path Sect knew that Emperor De had discovered some clues regarding their true nature, they slowly became indifferent to Emperor De. In the past five years, they didn\u2019t do anything overboard, so Emperor De turned a blind eye to them.He wouldn\u2019t ask the Zenith Heaven Path Sect for help nor could he do so.He visited his younger sister, Princess Yulin\u2019s palace.Five years ago, the 16-year-old Princess Yulin made a name for herself and was remembered by everyone in the world.But she chose to cool down and live in seclusion for five years.Without leaving her palace, she quietly accumulated her strength as she continuously practiced to deepen her comprehension of the two sword techniques.The trip to the Plains back then had brought her a lot of things.Be it knowledge or other things, she was reborn and learned to think on her own.The whole world praised her.Countless invisible hands were constantly pushing her into the sky.So high that Princess Yulin became afraid of its height.Other people who were praised would definitely be happy.Then, they would lose themselves and become obsessed with it.But it wasn\u2019t the case for Princess Yulin\u2026She chose to wash off the fame and glory she obtained and returned to the beginning.She went back to holding the sword and practicing with it daily.In the past five years, she had rarely seen anyone, even the Empress Dowager.It has also been five years since she last saw Emperor De.After five years, Emperor De looked at his younger sister who had no makeup on.She was dressed in snow-white clothes.She now had a bearing similar to that of a jade beauty.Emperor De was moved by the sight that he saw.\u201cIt\u2019s been five years since we last met. You seem to have changed into a different person,\u201d Emperor De said.Princess Yulin smiled. She lifted her teacup and said, \u201cI just grew up, that\u2019s all.\u201dEmperor De looked at Princess Yulin, full of emotions.She just grew up, that\u2019s all.The 16-year-old Princess Yulin from five years ago was still a child.But to solve the problem that could implicate millions of common people, she went into the Plains and created her own path of slaughter.And today, five years later\u2014Princess Yulin told him that she had grown up now, that\u2019s all.\u201cIs there something on your mind today, Brother?\u201d Princess Yulin asked curiously.She knew that Emperor De was very busy.None of the issues that could reach the Imperial Court were small matters after all.Hence, there must be a reason why Emperor De came here.Emperor De nodded and explained the recent events in detail.Princess Yulin frowned slightly as she listened.\u201cThe Seven Great Sages of the Monster and Demon Race. If it\u2019s true that their cultivation bases are beyond the Human God Realm, then they are indeed very powerful.\u201d\u201cYes, they are very powerful. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t be distressed.\u201d Emperor De smiled bitterly.\u201cBrother, I haven\u2019t broken through into the Grotto-Heaven Realm yet.\u201dPrincess Yulin directly answered the question that Emperor De wanted to ask herEmperor De opened his mouth, then closed it.He dismissed the question that he wanted to ask.Instead, he changed it into something else. \u201cWhat about your master?\u201dPrincess Yulin asked in surprise, \u201cYou want to look for my Master?\u201dEmperor De nodded and looked calmly at Princess Yulin.His eyes gleamed with a faint shimmer.\u201cDid you gain some information or something?\u201dPrincess Yulin was indeed born from the same mother as Emperor De.She immediately guessed what he was thinking.\u201cThis needs to be confirmed first.\u201dEmperor De shook his head and refused to tell Princess Yulin about his recent discovery.Princess Yulin had no interest in continuing the conversation.\u201cI don\u2019t know where my Master is. I haven\u2019t gone out for five years.\u201dEmperor De looked at Princess Yulin and suddenly extended his hand.\u201cWhat?\u201d Princess Yulin raised her brows.\u201cGive me the key to the Cold Palace,\u201d said Emperor De.Princess Yulin laughed and said, \u201cThe walls of the Cold Palace courtyard aren\u2019t that high. You can just climb over them.\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t be polite.\u201d Emperor De smiled mysteriously.He looked at Princess Yulin and said, \u201cThat key is not something precious, but you are unwilling to give it to me. This means that there is something wrong with the Cold Palace. Give me the key, I will visit the place.\u201dEmperor De looked at Princess Yulin proudly.Princess Yulin had no choice but to hand over the key to Emperor De and remind him.\u201cDon\u2019t disturb the place. Also, what if there\u2019s no one around?\u201dEmperor De just smiled and got up to leave without saying anything.What if there\u2019s no one around?Impossible!Emperor De\u2019s recent five years consisted of handling the Imperial Court and the state affairs of the Yuhua God Dynasty. However, he had also been carefully investigating any information as to who could be living in the Cold Palace.What was the identity of that dethroned Crown Prince?Nearly 50 years have passed since then.No one knew about the matter of Lin Jiufeng being banished into the Cold Palace.And in the historical records, because it was considered a huge scandal, there wasn\u2019t a detailed description of it at all.There was only one sentence.[Because of his lust, the dethroned Crown Prince is to be locked in the Cold Palace till his death.]Thus, he was banished into the Cold Palace back then!But who was this dethroned Crown Prince?What was his background?Why was he banished into the Cold Palace?When he was investigating these matters, he only lacked a starting point.But after so many years, Emperor De was bound to find a piece of information that he could use as the starting point of his investigation. From there, he decisively searched for and discovered various answers to the burning questions he had in mind.\u2018It turns out that this dethroned Crown Prince and Grandpa Emperor are biological brothers.\u2019\u2018Then, I should address him as Big Grand-Uncle.\u2019\u2018He has been imprisoned in the Cold Palace for almost 50 years.\u2019\u2018Is he still alive?\u2019\u2018Since he has been banished into the Cold Palace, that courtyard must belong to Big Grand-Uncle.\u2019\u2018Therefore, the one who gave little sister pointers wasn\u2019t Grandpa Emperor\u2019s soul, but was instead Big Grand-Uncle.\u2019\u2018I shall go visit Big Grand-Uncle now.\u2019Emperor De has been investigating the truth for the past five years.Today, he was only one key away from the truth.Hence, he came to ask for the key.Moreover, he couldn\u2019t tell Princess Yulin about his speculations just now.It was better not to disclose any unverified information after all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t tell anyone and returned to the Forbidden City to continue dealing with the state affairs.In the latter half of the night, Emperor De quietly left the Forbidden City alone and went for the Cold Palace.Late at night, he opened the Cold Palace\u2019s door.Once the door to the Cold Palace was opened, Emperor De didn\u2019t go in.Instead, he bowed all the way and said in a deep voice, \u201cUnfilial descendant is disturbing Big Grand-Uncle\u2019s rest. I ask for Big Grand-Uncle\u2019s help.\u201dLin Jiufeng and the white cat who was cultivating opened their eyes.\u201cYour descendant is here.\u201d The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng.Lin Jiufeng was puzzled. \u201cHow did he know that I was here?\u201dDid the Empress Dowager tell him?That shouldn\u2019t be the case\u2026If the Empress Dowager wanted to tell Emperor De about him, then she would have already done so five years ago when Princess Yulin was forced into a marriage alliance.Why wait until now?Lin Jiufeng initially wanted to ignore him, but Emperor De had already addressed him as Big Grand-Uncle. His confident tone meant that he knew that Lin Jiufeng was there.\u201cHow did you know of my existence?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked curiously.Outside the Cold Palace, Emperor De\u2019s expression shook.He pulled himself together and said, \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve been looking through all sorts of information in the past five years, including things that happened decades ago, as well as the relics left behind by my father and grandfather.\u201d\u201cSmart.\u201d The white cat praised.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t expect that Emperor De discovered his identity through the latter\u2019s own deduction.This made Lin Jiufeng think highly of him.\u201cIsn\u2019t the Yuhua God Dynasty doing well? Why did you come to find me?\u201dSeeing that he was so smart, Lin Jiufeng decided to ask about his purpose for coming here.What exactly happened that Emperor De himself came here to look for him?Instead of the Empress Dowager coming here.After all, the Empress Dowager was the only one that was supposed to know of his existence.But the Empress Dowager didn\u2019t come to seek his help.Emperor De immediately told him about the recent events in the Yuhua God Dynasty and about the Seven Great Sages of the Monster and Demon Race.One stood before the Cold Palace while the other was within the courtyard.Their voices weren\u2019t loud, but both sides could hear each other properly.After Emperor De finished talking about the Seven Sages, he knelt on both knees and pleaded.\u201cBig Grand-Uncle, Grandpa Emperor and Father passed the Yuhua God Dynasty to me in one piece. Not to mention pioneering new territories, but it\u2019s my responsibility to guard the foundation of the ancestors without losing even an inch of land.\u201d\u201cBut the Seven Sages are simply too powerful\u2026\u201d\u201cThe power of a secular dynasty such as our Yuhua God Dynasty is no match for them. If the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s lands were to be given up by me, then I would really be a sinner for all eternity. Even if I were to die ten thousand times, I would still be unable to make up for it.\u201d\u201cToday, it is already an unforgivable sin for me, this unfilial descendant, to rashly come to your door and disturb Big Grand-Uncle\u2019s leisurely cultivation. I only hope that the Big Grand-Uncle can help the Yuhua God Dynasty and protect the foundation built by our ancestors\u2026\u201d\u201cThis way, in the netherworld, Grandpa Emperor will remain smiling.\u201dEmperor De had truly matured.Five years ago, he was still a stubborn child who didn\u2019t know how to take responsibility and was only focused on his own path of cultivation.But now, he had the responsibility of an emperor boring down his shoulders.Lin Jiufeng stood in the courtyard and looked at the walls that were covered with sword scars.His gaze was faint as he looked through the walls one after another.He then saw the kneeling Emperor De.He was impressed.Lin Jiufeng remembered very clearly that five years ago, the Emperor of the Great Xia\u2019s Dragon Sparrow came to ask for a marriage alliance in order to maintain peace with the Yuhua God Dynasty.The court officials were in a terrible dispute over it.As an elder brother and also the Emperor, Emperor De actually couldn\u2019t come up with a decision.He just vehemently disagreed and hid in the Forbidden City to cultivate diligently.If it wasn\u2019t for Lin Jiufeng, Princess Yulin wouldn\u2019t be able to escape that calamity.The Emperor De from five years ago was truly just a child.But five years later, he was now a man who could take up his responsibility as the Emperor of a God Dynasty.He knew that with the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s strength, it wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the attacks of the Seven Great Sages. At that time, the best outcome would be to compensate them with a large amount of land to appease their anger.But Emperor De knew that he couldn\u2019t do that. If he did so, then he would become the greatest sinner of his lineage. At his wits\u2019 end, he directly came to look for Lin Jiufeng.Without caring about his own reputation, he knelt down and sincerely asked for his help.But why did these so-called Seven Great Sages sound so familiar?Lin Jiufeng was certain that he had heard this from someone before.\u201cSeven Great Sages\u2026\u201d The white cat pointed underground with its white claws.Lin Jiufeng instantly remembered the Demon King that he had defeated earlier in the day in the demon\u2019s den beneath the copper coffin.That Demon King said that he was one of the Seven Great Sages, Demon King Pingtian.Lin Jiufeng asked curiously, \u201cWho are the Seven Great Sages?\u201dHearing Lin Jiufeng\u2019s question, Emperor De became excited.As long as Lin Jiufeng was willing to listen, there was hope for him to lend a hand.\u201cThey are the Great Sage of the Ocean Cove, Demon King Jiao, Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens, Demon King Dapeng, Great Sage of the Moving Mountain, Demon King Gui, Great Sage of the Blowing Wind, Demon King Yuan, Great Sage of the White Clothed, Bai Zilong, Great Sage of the Dreaming, Yun Shanhai, and Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling, the Heaven Raising Bull.\u201dEmperor De stated their names.When Lin Jiufeng heard about the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling, he revealed an \u2018as expected\u2019 expression on his face.The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling, one of the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race, was currently being suppressed inside the demon\u2019s den.Just today, he was defeated by Lin Jiufeng and the latter used him to sign-in for a good item.The Sword Driving Technique!And on the night of that same day, Emperor De came to ask for help, informing Lin Jiufeng that the other members of the Seven Sages were coming to the Yuhua God Dynasty to ask for a piece of land from the God Dynasty.Lin Jiufeng looked at Emperor De and said, \u201cGo back and find out how many of the Seven Great Sages are coming, and where they are right now. Also, don\u2019t tell anyone about me.\u201dEmperor De was overjoyed.When he heard this, he was finally reassured.He felt as if a great burden was lifted off his chest.Emperor De hurriedly kowtowed a few times and replied in excitement, \u201cI will go back and investigate this matter thoroughly before coming back here to report!\u201d\u201cGo,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said softly.Emperor De stood up and carefully closed the Cold Palace\u2019s door before rushing back to investigate.From the beginning till the end, he never saw Lin Jiufeng with his own eyes.But after hearing Lin Jiufeng\u2019s voice, he felt the urge to trust Lin Jiufeng in his heart.This was probably a form of trust that came from their bloodline connection.For some reason, Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words alone were enough to quell his panic and apprehension.\u2026After Emperor De left, Lin Jiufeng and the white cat looked at each other.\u201cYou want to interfere in this matter?\u201d The white cat asked.\u201cYes. If the Imperial Court were to start giving up land to compensate them, its demise would surely be nigh.\u201d Lin Jiufeng nodded.If there was a first time, there would be a second, third\u2026 countless times.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t want the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2014which Emperor Yuan and Emperor Ming had painstakingly reformed\u2014to fall into ruin after just three generations.\u201cYou are going to intervene?\u201d The white cat laid on Lin Jiufeng\u2019s shoulder and softly asked.Lin Jiufeng thought for a while.Then, he replied in a serious manner. \u201cMaybe\u2026 maybe there isn\u2019t a need for me to stop the Seven Sages myself.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t appear and stop the Seven Sages, who can possibly defeat them out there?\u201d The white cat said.The Seven Great Sages of the Monster and Demon Race weren\u2019t beings that those of the Human God Realm could match against.Lin Jiufeng smiled and said, \u201cIndeed, no one from the Yuhua God Dynasty can fight them, but there\u2019s someone who may be able to.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d The white cat asked curiously.Her eyes, which seemed to have celestial bodies in them, looked at Lin Jiufeng.Reflected in her eyes were not only the stars but also Lin Jiufeng himself.\u201cDidn\u2019t you see him this morning?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked softly.\u201cGreat Sage of the Heaven Leveling? That Demon King?\u201d The white cat recalled.That Demon King Pingtian was one of the Seven Great Sages.\u201cWhat do you think the effect would be if I released him and asked him to solve this problem for me?\u201d Lin Jiufeng told the white cat his plan.\u201cBe careful of creating problems for yourself. Those demons are not to be trifled with. Once they absorbed the spiritual energy in the outside world, their strength will increase by leaps and bounds.\u201d The white cat was worried.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. As long as I\u2019m around, the Imperial Capital and the Yuhua God Dynasty will never fall into chaos!\u201d Lin Jiufeng was confident.\u201cThen why don\u2019t you just stop the Seven Sages yourself?\u201d The white cat asked curiously.It\u2019s not convenient for me to fight now, I\u2019m waiting for the first spring rain!\u201dLin Jiufeng simply stated.\u201cWaiting for the rain again?\u201d The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise.Lin Jiufeng just smiled.But in the end, he didn\u2019t say anything.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Received 36 Swords of the Demon Path!]Lin Jiufeng looked in surprise at the 36 longswords that appeared out of thin air.They were entirely black in color, and each of them had a portion of a dragon\u2019s body carved on their surfaces. When the 36 swords were combined, they formed a hideous and vicious-looking demonic dragon that hovered in the air.\u201cThis is a combination sword formation to summon a demonic dragon. The 36 swords are the demonic dragon\u2019s body. Once successfully executed, its might will inevitably be shocking.\u201dAfter Lin Jiufeng understood its power, he happily kept the demonic swords and placed them into the sword case.He would nurture them and improve their quality.Since he had no use for them temporarily, he was planning on keeping them in the sword case where they could slowly be nurtured for improvement.Lin Jiufeng usually left the demon\u2019s den after a beatdown.The demons in the demon\u2019s den thought so too.The demon that was struck down received grievous injuries, but he didn\u2019t care. After all, Lin Jiufeng would only hit him once. It wouldn\u2019t be a problem for him to slowly recover back to his peak.The demons in the demon\u2019s den talked with each other and reminisced about the past once more.They were just like old men who sat at the entrance of their villages\u2026They were looking at each other with nostalgic looks on their faces.Their eyes were all filled with yearning.As they were discussing, Lin Jiufeng knocked on the entrance of the demon\u2019s den.Clang!This made the demons look at Lin Jiufeng, they were all confused.After defeating a demon with a slap, he actually didn\u2019t leave?Was Lin Jiufeng planning to continue and humiliate them even further?The hearts of the demons tightened for no reason.They looked at him nervously.But Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t continue to attack.He calmly asked, \u201cWho is the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling?\u201dThe demons in the demon\u2019s den were stunned.He was looking for the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling?Everyone looked at the Tauren demon that Lin Jiufeng injured yesterday.\u201cI am,\u201d the Heaven Raising Bull said, looking at Lin Jiufeng in confusion.What was he trying to do?Was he about to beat him up?That would be too unreasonable.Lin Jiufeng had just beaten him up yesterday.\u201cYou\u2019re from the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race?\u201dLin Jiufeng continued his line of questioning.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t attack or make any other moves.As a result, the demons in the demon\u2019s den heaved sighs of relief.\u201cYes.\u201d The Heaven Raising Bull nodded.\u201cAre you familiar with the other members of the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked once more.\u201cOf course, we were once sworn brothers,\u201d The Heaven Raising Bull said.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d The Heaven Raising Bull followed up.\u201cNothing much, it\u2019s just that the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover and the Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens are coming to the Imperial Capital to find trouble with the Yuhua God Dynasty,\u201d Lin Jiufeng casually replied.But this leisurely tone of his made the Heaven Raising Bull\u2019s heart tighten.The Great Sage of the Ocean Cover and the Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens actually provoked this fiendish man.Wouldn\u2019t there be a conflict between them then?\u201cThey are coming to find trouble with the Yuhua God Dynasty? What are you planning to do?\u201dThe Heaven Raising Bull asked.\u201cKill them, of course,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said in a matter-of-factly manner.The Heaven Raising Bull looked nervous.This ferocious man was truly planning to kill them.But there was also a demon who objected. \u201cSince the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover and the Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens have already appeared in the world, they must have absorbed the renewed spiritual energy of this era and had already recovered their formidable strength. Do you really think that you can win against the two of them alone?\u201dWith these words, the other demons became excited.If Lin Jiufeng was defeated or killed, then they would have a chance to escape.\u201cDo you think that they will be able to defeat me in the early stages of the recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy after just absorbing the renewed spiritual energy of the world?\u201dLin Jiufeng sarcastically asked.He wasn\u2019t worried about this problem at all.The excited demons seemed to have been strangled as they choked at the same time.Thinking about Lin Jiufeng\u2019s current strength, the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race that had only just appeared really wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat him.\u201cWhy are you telling me all of this?\u201d The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling asked curiously.Since Lin Jiufeng could win, why was he talking to him then?\u201cI want you to persuade the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race. Stop them from overestimating their capabilities and causing trouble for the Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d Lin Jiufeng calmly explained.But every demon in the demon\u2019s den suddenly became excited.Especially the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling.He pointed at himself in disbelief. \u201cYou\u2019re letting me out?\u201dHe was on the verge of tears.Ten years.Ten whole years.Lin Jiufeng had suppressed them for ten years.In these ten years, he had beaten up each and every one of them.Well, almost\u2026It could be said that every demon in here had lived a depressing life so far in this brand new era.But even so, they didn\u2019t give up on themselves.Instead, they kept thinking about when they could leave.As the world\u2019s spiritual energy recovered, more and more powerful cultivators would appear.If someone were to defeat or kill Lin Jiufeng one day\u2026Then wouldn\u2019t they be able to escape?But no one expected that Lin Jiufeng would actually take the initiative to release them.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go out?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cNo, I want to go out,\u201d The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling replied in a hurry.\u201cBut aren\u2019t you afraid that after I leave, I will join forces with the other Great Sages to destroy your Yuhua God Dynasty?\u201d The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling asked curiously.The other demons were also puzzled.Why would Lin Jiufeng do this?\u201cI am letting you out because I don\u2019t want to fight with anyone for the time being. I don\u2019t want to fight with the Seven Sages, so I want you to go and persuade them.\u201d\u201cAs for your question, if I am worried that you will bring me trouble when you got out, you\u2019re overthinking it.\u201d\u201cNot just you, but also the other demons. I am planning to release them all in the near future.\u201d\u201cIf you guys can deliver a devastating blow to me, I will praise you lot instead.\u201dLin Jiufeng sternly announced.In a few days, these demons would no longer be useful to him.Lin Jiufeng would no longer be able to sign in using the demons in this demon\u2019s den.Of course, he could continue to suppress them.But he had no intention of doing so.The demons below were all excited upon hearing Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words\u2014they were excited to hear that he was planning on releasing them.\u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that our 3,000 plus demons will completely destroy your Yuhua God Dynasty once we get out?\u201d A Demon God asked.\u201cThe strong will always remain strong. After I let you all out, don\u2019t you all still need some time to become stronger? To absorb the renewed spiritual energy of the world, and to recover your own strength before coming to me for revenge?\u201d Lin Jiufeng asked.\u201cTo be honest, after these ten years, you lot aren\u2019t so useful to me anymore. I\u2019ve thought about it seriously and I\u2019ve decided to let you lot out.\u201d\u201cThis world is simply too weak!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too slow to let the people of this world grow on their own. By releasing you guys, the world will have more powerhouses for they will feel pressured before your presences.\u201d\u201cThen, the recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy will also speed up.\u201d\u201cAt that time, I will still be the same as before. I will still be able to suppress the world.\u201d\u201cI am simply dissatisfied with the recovery speed of the world\u2019s spiritual energy!\u201dLin Jiufeng laid out his thoughts.The current him already felt that this world was a mere cage to him.The recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy was just incredibly slow for him.Thus, he decided that the world itself needed a push.He had to give the world a push so that the recovery speed of the world\u2019s spiritual energy would become slightly faster than a turtle\u2019s pace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was a plan that Lin Jiufeng had made a long time ago.The world was recovering from its previous drought and the quality of the world\u2019s spiritual energy was constantly improving.Countless people benefited from this.But for Lin Jiufeng, it simply wasn\u2019t enough.Because his progress was faster than the recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy.The recovery of the world\u2019s spiritual energy couldn\u2019t keep up with Lin Jiufeng\u2019s pace.In the end, Lin Jiufeng decided to give it a push from behind the scenes.When the demons in the demon\u2019s den heard Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words, they were all shocked.He was that confident?He was confident that he was powerful enough to suppress the world?Some demons sneered.They didn\u2019t believe Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words at all.Once they were released, the one who would suffer would only be Lin Jiufeng.Some demons were already planning to absorb the spiritual energy in the world to recover their strength after they got out.Then, they would immediately come over to kill Lin Jiufeng and take their revenge.1Lin Jiufeng knew that these demons were scheming against him, but he didn\u2019t care.He only looked at the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling and asked, \u201cDo you agree?\u201dThe Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling asked solemnly, \u201cI just need to persuade them not to make any trouble?\u201d\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t listen to me?\u201d He then followed up with another question.\u201cThen, they will be forcing me to make a move,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said coldly, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t make a move, but I don\u2019t want to. I have more important things to deal with.\u201dIf this Tauren-looking demon really couldn\u2019t persuade them, Lin Jiufeng could fight against them before the arrival of the first spring rain.But at that time, Lin Jiufeng would be forced to use the aura he had accumulated so far to aid his breakthrough. The talismans he had prepared would also be damaged.The gains would simply not make up for the losses.After hearing Lin Jiufeng\u2019s words, the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling said straightforwardly, \u201cSince you dare to let me out, I will definitely go out. I will also go and persuade them, but whether they will listen or not, I cannot guarantee.\u201dLin Jiufeng opened the seal of the demon\u2019s den and said, \u201cCome up yourself.\u201dThe Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling looked at the opened seal.Excitement flickered in his eyes.He had wanted to leave for a long time, but now, his dreams had finally come true.Boom!Ignoring his own injuries, the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling leaped into the air and directly left the demon\u2019s den.The other demons below watched enviously.They also wanted to go out.Lin Jiufeng said, \u201cDon\u2019t be envious. It won\u2019t be long before I release you all.\u201dAfter saying this\u2014without looking at their excited expressions\u2014Lin Jiufeng closed the seal once more.He looked at the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling.His form was a Tauren.But his original form was that of a Heaven Raising Bull\u2014an ancient mutated beast with boundless strength and incredibly thick skin.He was currently in his human form. There was a pair of horns on his head. His face was rough, and he was taller than Lin Jiufeng by a head. If estimated, he was about two meters tall.Two words could be used to describe him directly\u2014big and strong.But in front of the delicate and weak-looking Lin Jiufeng, he remained prudent and cautious.He didn\u2019t even dare to breathe loudly.\u201cCome out with me.\u201dLin Jiufeng turned and left, following the passageway into the Cold Palace up above.The white cat laid on top of the cherry blossom tree. She was waiting for Lin Jiufeng\u2019s return. When she saw Lin Jiufeng coming out, she immediately stood up.But when she saw the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling, she held back and curiously paced back and forth instead.Lin Jiufeng reached out, hugged the white cat into his arms, and gently stroked her fur.\u201cYou live here?\u201d The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling looked around and asked in confusion.This was indeed a huge palace.But the peeling walls, loose stone bricks, and the rotten wooden beams had all but decayed.Was this an abandoned palace?Lin Jiufeng might not be the strongest person in the world right now, but he was at least the strongest person from this era.But why was he staying in such a place?To think that his lifestyle was this modest\u2026Lin Jiufeng responded, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the height of the mountains that matters, but if there are Immortals living on it. A house might be dilapidated, but it\u2019s the virtue of the person staying there that matters in the end.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019m going now,\u201d said the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling.\u201cGo. Try to persuade them. I don\u2019t want to kill anyone for now,\u201d Lin Jiufeng calmly replied.The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling choked.These words of his were just too arrogant, but hearing them from Lin Jiufeng\u2019s mouth, he actually didn\u2019t think that there was anything wrong with them.\u2018There must be something wrong with me!\u2019The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling shook his head and turned to leave.He leaped up and rode the clouds, disappearing from the Cold Palace.In the Cold Palace, Lin Jiufeng stared at Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling\u2019s back without saying a word.\u201cWhy did you let him go?\u201d The white cat asked softly in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s arms.The white cat knew that he was a demon from that underground demon\u2019s den and that he was a very powerful existence. Once he was released, he would absorb the renewed spiritual energy in the air and recover his peak strength.By then, he would definitely be a huge problem.\u201cI am letting him persuade his comrades so that they won\u2019t come here to die,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to wait for the rain?\u201d The white cat asked curiously.\u201cThis rain might be arriving anytime now.\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked up at the sky.The sky was clear and the breeze was gentle.The air smelled of spring, moist and full of water.The first spring rain was coming!\u2026Forbidden City, Great Council Hall.Upon Emperor De\u2019s return, he got people to gather information about all sorts of things related to the Seven Great Sages.This investigation really made him discover a lot of things that he didn\u2019t know before.The Great Sage of the Ocean Cover came into being from overseas.His awakening was the result of a sea disaster that stirred up huge waves and shattered the island he was sealed on.The power of nature was truly formidable.The Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens came from a huge mountain.He woke up from the mountain and opened his eyes to look at the world.Then, he discovered that the Monster Race no longer had a place for them to live.Hence, he was the first to say that he wanted to come to the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty and take back the territory of the Monster Race from the human emperor of the God Dynasty.Upon hearing this news, the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover also crossed the sea to come here.He also wanted a piece of land for himself.Right now, these two were the only ones who publicly demanded territory and said that they wanted to come to the Imperial Capital and visit Emperor De.The other Great Sages appeared separately, but some only occupied a hilltop while others traveled the world to thoroughly take in the sights of this brand new era.They never explicitly said that they were coming to the Imperial Capital.The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race had different personalities.Among them, the ones that were the most irritable were the Great Sage of the Ocean Cover and the Great Sage of the Chaotic Heavens.Their arrival caused the demonic sects that had been silent for a long time to celebrate wantonly.The demonic sects that had become silent after being beaten up by Lin Jiufeng a few years ago now appeared once again. They were cheering for these two Great Sages with all of their might.The information that Emperor De gathered was also spread around by the demonic sects.After collecting this information, Emperor De happily brought the information he gathered along and went to see Lin Jiufeng on a dark and windy night.In front of the Cold Palace, Emperor De said respectfully, \u201cBig Grand-Uncle, I\u2019ve already gathered the information you need.\u201dMeow!The white cat appeared. It took away the bundle of information and left Emperor De alone.\u201cGo back and manage the dynasty properly. Someone will deal with the Seven Sages. Easing the worries of your citizens is what you should do right now,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said.\u201cOkay\u2026 Thank you in advance, Big Grand-Uncle! I shall take my leave now.\u201dEmperor De left in satisfaction.After receiving Lin Jiufeng\u2019s guarantee, his worries disappeared.To save the Yuhua God Dynasty and to protect Emperor Yuan\u2019s legacy, he had put in quite a bit of effort.Fortunately, there were people in the Yuhua God Dynasty that he could depend on.When Emperor De returned to the Forbidden City in a good mood, he was called over by the Empress Dowager. In Empress Dowager\u2019s palace, Princess Yulin was also present.Both women then looked at Emperor De.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With such a big problem happening to the God Dynasty, how can I continue to cultivate in seclusion?\u201d Princess Yulin asked.\u201cBig trouble?\u201d Emperor De looked puzzled. \u201cWhat trouble? Why didn\u2019t I know about it?\u201dPrincess Yulin looked at Emperor De in confusion.\u201cEmperor, isn\u2019t the biggest problem that we\u2019re facing right now are the Seven Great Sages?\u201dThe Empress Dowager asked.\u201cHow did Mother know of this?\u201d Emperor De asked curiously.Ever since the Empress Dowager transferred the God Dynasty\u2019s power to Emperor De, she had been living in seclusion without asking about the state affairs anymore.She believed that Emperor De would handle it well on his own.If he really encountered trouble, she still had a trump card that she could use to save the Yuhua God Dynasty.Hence, she had always been living peacefully in a rather stable state of mind.But in the past few days, the rumors of the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race had become increasingly rampant. This news quietly spread throughout the Imperial Capital even though Emperor De had ordered that discussing this issue publicly was forbidden.But defending against a flash flood was easier than defending against the mouths of the common people. In fact, preventing them from speaking up would just make them even more excited to speak about it.\u201cEmperor De. On the surface, the court officials and the commoners are not discussing this matter, but in private, even the maids and servants are talking about it. Do you think that it\u2019s possible for me to not know of this?\u201d The Empress Dowager asked solemnly.\u201cBrother, the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race are indeed very powerful. They have already broken through into the Grotto-Heaven Realm and are considered to be some of the most powerful demons in this world. What are your plans?\u201d Princess Yulin asked.Emperor De opened his mouth, wanting to answer.But the Empress Dowager interrupted.\u201cYou are not allowed to give up even an inch of the land that your Grandpa and Father Emperor left behind for you. If you did such a thing, I will surely break your legs.\u201dEmperor De smiled bitterly and replied,\u201cMother, I won\u2019t give up even an inch of the Yuhua God Dynasty\u2019s land.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry about it anymore. The Seven Great Sages are indeed powerful, but it\u2019s not like there\u2019s no one who can handle them in our Yuhua God Dynasty.\u201d\u201cLeave this matter to Mother to handle\u2026\u201d\u201cJust continue to do your job as the Emperor,\u201d The Empress Dowager said sternly.She was going to use the trump card that Emperor Ming left behind.She believed that the Yuhua God Dynasty was in grave danger.She had to treat this threat seriously and reveal that trump card.But Emperor De directly rejected her request and replied, \u201cMother, the news about the so-called Seven Great Sages is already spreading like wildfire, but we don\u2019t have to be afraid. I already have a solution, there\u2019s no need for you to worry.\u201dThe Empress Dowager and Princess Yulin were surprised by Emperor De\u2019s confidence.\u201cBrother, what are your chances of dealing with the Seven Great Sages whose cultivation bases are beyond the Human God Realm?\u201d Princess Yulin asked curiously.The Empress Dowager was also rather curious.The Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race were powerful existences beyond the Human God Realm.On the surface, no one in the entire Yuhua God Dynasty had exceeded the Human God Realm.How could they possibly be a match for them?Emperor De smiled mysteriously and said, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to worry. Someone has already taken responsibility for this matter.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the Emperor, I naturally have to be responsible for the people of the world and the foundation of my ancestors. You guys just have to watch over this matter, there\u2019s no need to worry about it anymore.\u201dPrincess Yulin stared meticulously at Emperor De.Suddenly, she asked in surprise, \u201cDid you go to find my Master?\u201dPrincess Yulin remembered that Emperor De had taken the key to the Cold Palace from her.The previous Emperor De looked very troubled.But now, he was full of confidence and high-spirited.He wasn\u2019t worried about the Seven Great Sages at all.The contrast between the before and after was just too obvious.Princess Yulin immediately understood the crux of the matter.Emperor De smiled without saying anything.\u201cIs it really my Master?\u201d Princess Yulin stood up in surprise.\u201cI want to go and find Master.\u201d Princess Yulin added anxiously.\u201cWait.\u201d Emperor De stopped Princess Yulin and shook his head. \u201cDon\u2019t disturb him.\u201dPrincess Yulin looked at Emperor De.She was unwilling to let the matter rest so easily.\u201cMaster has already seen you, but he doesn\u2019t even want to see me?\u201dEmperor De explained.\u201cHe\u2019s indifferent to worldly affairs and likes peace and quiet. Don\u2019t disturb him.\u201dPrincess Yulin murmured, \u201cIn the past five years, I\u2019ve been practicing my swordsmanship non-stop every day. I\u2019ve already learned the sword techniques that Master had imparted to me. I want to show my improvement on them to Master.\u201dEmperor De comforted her. \u201cThere will be a chance for that in the future.\u201dEmpress Dowager listened from the side and muttered in surprise, \u201cYou really found that mysterious master?\u201d\u201cMother, just the three of us shall know of this matter. There\u2019s no need to publicize it,\u201d Emperor De said softly.\u201cI know\u2026\u201d\u201cPowerhouses all like to be indifferent to fame and fortune. They don\u2019t want to expose themselves. Since you are confident about it, then I\u2019m relieved. I\u2019m saved from the headache and trouble.\u201d Empress Dowager was overjoyed.She didn\u2019t have to use her trump card for now.Moreover, Emperor De also had another powerhouse backing him right now and they also didn\u2019t have to worry about the Seven Great Sages of the Monster and Demon Race anymore.This was simply solving many problems at once.The Empress Dowager was overjoyed.It was just that neither she nor Emperor De expected that both of their backing was the same person\u2014Lin Jiufeng.\u2026Outside the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty, a huge river existed.The released Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling stood by the riverside and crazily absorbed the spiritual energy in the air.The surging spiritual energy was then swallowed by him like a whale. Then, he exerted his strength and pressed the spiritual energy into his stomach, causing it to explode.Moo!The roar of the Heaven Raising Bull shook the mountains and rivers.His roar resounded throughout the world.The injuries that Lin Jiufeng had inflicted on him were recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.He transformed into his true form and stood by the riverside.This was the roar of the Heaven Raising Bull from thousands of years ago, it was now echoing throughout the world.Thousands of miles away, a flood dragon was flying through the clouds and mist in the sky.Hearing the roar of the Heaven Raising Bull, it called out in excitement.Roar!This was the roar of the flood dragon. It shattered the white clouds within a thousand-mile radius and its roar itself was transmitted into the ears of the Heaven Raising Bull.The Heaven Raising Bull stood in its original spot. It wagged its tail and waited quietly.After a while, a flood dragon flew out from the clouds. It was huge with bumps on its head and black scales that were as tough as steel knives on its body.Rumble!It penetrated the clouds in the sky and its huge body dropped straight down.He smashed into the vast river, splashing water hundreds of meters high.In the very next moment, the water was split open and a huge flood dragon head emerged.It stared at the Heaven Raising Bull that was tens of meters tall as it asked.\u201cOld Bull, when did you wake up?\u201d\u201cJust now!\u201d The Heaven Raising Bull replied in a muffled voice.\u201cOkay. Come with me, let\u2019s go to the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty and look for that human emperor. Let them give up the territory that originally belonged to us and we will also ask him to compensate us!\u201d\u201cThey are just humans, we can easily manipulate them. We shall rebuild our strength and restore the terrifying reputation of the Monster Race.\u201d The Great Sage of the Ocean Cover, Demon King Jiao, announced loudly.The confidence in his tone sure was contagious.But the Heaven Raising Bull only shook its head and said, \u201cDemon King Jiao, we can\u2019t go to the Imperial Capital!\u201d\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Demon King Jiao looked at the Heaven Raising Bull in surprise.Its lantern-like eyes stared at the Heaven Raising Bull.Fury brewed inside.\u201cThere\u2019s a very terrifying existence in the Imperial Capital\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t provoke him,\u201d the Heaven Raising Bull replied honestly.\u201cAll this time, only others have been afraid of us\u2014the Seven Great Sages of the Monster Race and Demon Race. Since when have we been afraid of others?\u201d Demon King Jiao retorted in anger.His body suddenly rushed out of the water\u2019s surface as he raised his head in agitation.\u201cHe\u2019s different,\u201d Heaven Raising Bull replied in a low voice.\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? Is he the reincarnation of some terrifying big shot?\u201d Demon King Jiao snorted coldly.He levitated up in the air, his body was huge that it seemed to cover the sky itself.His attitude remained arrogant despite the Heaven Raising Bull\u2019s persuasion.\u201cI won\u2019t harm you. If you really insist on going to the Imperial Capital, you will be in big trouble.\u201dThe Heaven Raising Bull advised once more.\u201cOld Bull, you\u2019ve just come out. I reckon that you still don\u2019t understand the state of the world in this brand new era. But I don\u2019t blame you. You said that there\u2019s a terrifying existence in the Imperial Capital of the Yuhua God Dynasty?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go and kill him right now\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll show you what true terror is!\u201d Demon King Jiao\u2019s body shook and he was about to leave.In the Imperial Capital thousands of miles away, Lin Jiufeng looked at the sky and sighed.\u201cWhy must you force me to make a move?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Arriving In the RainOn the riverbank of the Wei River, a flood dragon\u2019s aura flourished. He refused to listen as his huge body twisted while his dragon claws gesticulated into the sky as if he was trying to grab the sun, moon, and the stars.His aura was clearly stronger than those in the early stages of the Grotto-Heaven Realm.In this world, he truly had the right to be arrogant.It has only been a few months since he came into being, yet he had already recovered to this extent. Why should he listen to the Heaven Raising Bull?The Heaven Raising Bull looked at the proud and conceited Demon King Jiao.He couldn\u2019t help but sigh in helplessness.Demon King Jiao was indeed powerful.He had recovered quite quickly, but he definitely wasn\u2019t in his peak condition.In contrast to him, that fellow in the Imperial Capital seemed to be always in his peak state.The demons in the demon\u2019s den inside the Cold Palace had long come to a consensus that they must not provoke Lin Jiufeng before they thoroughly recovered their strength.Every demon in that demon\u2019s den understood why this was important.But Demon King Jiao had no idea about what those demons experienced under Lin Jiufeng\u2019s hands.Demon King Jiao bared his fangs and brandished his claws.With his body in the form of a flood dragon, he moved through the clouds with his boundless aura pervading into everything around him.\u201cOld Bull, despite living through an entire era, you\u2019ve become a coward. I can already command the wind and the clouds with my ability right now. I have taken another step further into my journey of becoming a true dragon.\u201d\u201cWhy must I be afraid of humans?\u201d Demon King Jiao was unconvinced. To show his present might to the Heaven Raising Bull, he even flew into the air and used his ability to command the wind and the clouds.Countless people on the land underneath saw a humongous black dragon shuttling back and forth through the clouds. Not only that, but the black dragon was also showering the world beneath him with droplets of rain as it displayed its powerful abilities to the world.The people turned pale at such a terrifying sight. They knelt on the ground and prayed.When the cultivators saw this scene, their faces turned green with fear. To be able to control the wind and the clouds, and to produce rain in the process, this black dragon was tremendously powerful.Moreover, this theory of theirs was further supported by the fact that they recognized the identity of the black dragon soaring through the skies. They could see that it was Demon King Jiao\u2014one of the Seven Great Sages with the body of a flood dragon.When Demon King Wyrm Jiao saw the people\u2019s reaction beneath, he roared with laughter that was so loud it shook everything on the land underneath.He strutted around and said to the Heaven Raising Bull.\u201cLook! These ignorant humans have knelt down before me!\u201d\u201cThey are worshipping me as if I\u2019m a god.\u201d\u201cHumans have always been foolish and ignorant!\u201dDemon King Jiao looked triumphantly at the Heaven Raising Bull.The Heaven Raising Bull made a sidelong glance at the Demon King Jiao. After displaying his ability to command the winds and the clouds, the latter looked lofty, confident, and even arrogant.The Heaven Raising Bull wanted to say something, but he had only just left the demon\u2019s den beneath that Cold Palace and he hadn\u2019t completely recovered from his injuries just yet.He couldn\u2019t be bothered to argue.\u201cDemon King Jiao, you are still as arrogant as ever.\u201d The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling, the Heaven Raising Bull, sighed. In the end, this was all that he could say.\u201cI am already at the peak of the Grotto-Heaven Realm. I am the King of the Monster Race. If I don\u2019t stand up for the Monster Race as their King, who will?\u201dDemon King Jiao continued to stir the wind and the clouds.His terrifying aura covered an entire ten thousand miles with him standing at the center.Then, rain fell from the skies.It was accompanied by the deep roars of thunder above the clouds.The Demon King Jiao\u2019s haughty laughter soon followed.His aura alone made the human cultivators beneath him unable to breathe.In the Imperial Capital, countless people raised their heads and watched this scene with pale faces.Human Gods were very powerful, but they were unable to stir up a storm that spanned thousands of miles, nor were they able to make their auras surge for the same distance.In other words, this flood dragon was at the Grotto-Heaven Realm.And he was most certainly in the late stages of the terrifying Grotto-Heaven Realm.He was unrivaled in this world!Everyone looked at the massive Demon King Jiao.At this moment, fear rose in their hearts.How could they defend against an existence this strong?A million-strong army perhaps wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand even a flick of this flood dragon\u2019s tail.In the Forbidden City, Emperor De and Princess Yulin stood side by side as they watched this chilling scene.\u201cAn era where cultivators can change the world itself has arrived\u2026\u201dEmperor De sighed, his expression ugly.A Human God Realm was already strong enough to disregard the rules made by the mortals of the Mortal Realm. However, if one was at the Grotto-Heaven Realm. It would be an understatement to say that they would be able to deal with anything they were dissatisfied with.The scene shocked Emperor De.He was already a Martial Sage expert, but in front of an existence at the Grotto-Heaven Realm, he knew that he had absolutely no chance of surviving.He wouldn\u2019t even be able to attack such an enemy.After all, he couldn\u2019t even resist that existence\u2019s aura.Princess Yulin muttered all of a sudden.\u201cGive me some time, I will step into the Grotto-Heaven Realm.\u201dEmperor De looked at the heavy rain, at the rolling thunder, and at the deafening roar from thousands of miles away.Fear was written all over his face.His heart trembled, but his tone remained inexplicably firm.\u201cBig Grand-Uncle will definitely be able to defeat him!\u201dPrincess Yulin looked at Emperor De in surprise.Big Grand-Uncle?Her Master was her Big Grand-Uncle?She had no idea at all\u2026\u2026Imperial Capital, Cold Palace.Lin Jiufeng hugged the white cat.Dressed in green robes, his hair was rolled into a bun.He looked just like a little Daoist priest with a refreshing and bright demeanor.Lin Jiufeng\u2014despite being almost 70 years old\u2014still looked young as if he had never aged.The white cat in his arms looked at the rain that kept falling from the sky and said, \u201cIs this the rain that you are waiting for?\u201dLin Jiufeng smiled. \u201cI was patiently waiting for a particular rain. But that rain has come in advance, all thanks to Demon King Jiao.\u201dLin Jiufeng had estimated that the spring rain he was waiting for would arrive seven days later.His estimate was made after measuring the stars at night and measuring the occurrence frequency of astrological phenomena in recent months. In the remaining seven days, Lin Jiufeng planned to do his best not to get into a fight with anyone.But Demon King Jiao forced the spring rain to come in advance.In Lin Jiufeng\u2019s eyes, the world after this rain would be a brand new world.A world that belonged to the strong.The white cat asked curiously. \u201cWhat exactly do you want to do?\u201d\u201cCome with me\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to break through into the next realm with one strike!\u201d Lin Jiufeng replied.He carried the white cat and stepped into the rain.The heavy rain fell and lightning flashed in the air.It was like the end of the world.And there was no one loitering in the usually busy streets.The water droplets constantly splashed onto the ground.In just a short moment, Lin Jiufeng had already walked out of the Imperial Capital.With the disappearance of a single droplet into the ground, Lin Jiufeng had completed his journey.Amidst the lightning that filled the sky, Lin Jiufeng took a step forward.The lightning and water vapors gathered together and transformed into a lotus beneath his feet.A lotus bloomed with every step!Thousands of miles away on the riverbank of the Wei River, Demon King Jiao felt proud and rightfully arrogant.He watched as the world trembled and wailed under his might.He thoroughly enjoyed such a scene.\u201cOld Bull, do you still think that I can\u2019t defeat that human whom you\u2019re scared of in the Imperial Capital?\u201d Demon King Jiao asked.The Heaven Raising Bull was just about to speak when all the hairs on his body suddenly stood on end. His entire body screamed for him to make a run for it as he jolted and quickly turned his head to look into the distance that was being covered by the heavy rain.A figure walked over slowly.He was dressed in green and he had a pale look on his face.Nevertheless, his bearing remained leisurely and there was this otherworldly air around him.The rain avoided him.The lightning respected him.And the wind clung to him.Everything around him\u2014even the earth\u2014sang their praises for his presence.The sun, the moon, the stars, the rain, the thunder, and the lightning disappeared all at once.In the eyes of the Heaven Raising Bull, there was only Lin Jiufeng.The former\u2019s heart, body, and even his hair began to tremble.\u2018Lin Jiufeng\u2026 He\u2019s here.\u2019Amidst the heavy rain, Lin Jiufeng walked towards them.Despite walking ever so slowly and without a hint of any powerful aura coming from his body, every step that he took seemed to be in sync with the pounding of the Heaven Raising Bull\u2019s heart.The Heaven Raising Bull found it hard to breathe.No one understood Lin Jiufeng\u2019s might better than the demons trapped in the demon\u2019s den beneath that Cold Palace in the past ten years.\u201cDemon King Jiao, just surrender\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201dThe Heaven Raising Bull hurriedly turned around and roared in horror.He wanted to save this brother of his.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Suppressing the Flood Dragon with a SwordThe Heaven Raising Bull desperately roared.He was afraid that if he shouted even a second later, Lin Jiufeng would make his move and Demon King Jiao would be no more in a blink of an eye.But\u2026In this heavy rain, Demon King Jiao\u2019s confidence remained unprecedentedly high. He levitated in the air with his huge body. Exuding a boundless aura and confidence, how could he possibly listen to the words of the Heaven Raising Bull?Instead, he let out an even louder roar.The head of the flood dragon looked hideous and terrifying.His mouth opened and released a terrifying wave of air that charged over to Lin Jiufeng.Roar!!!His loud roar reverberated powerfully and it shattered the droplets of water in the air, causing it to splash everywhere.A powerful wave of air surged over, it was about to slap Lin Jiufeng on the face.Demon King Jiao directly roared, wanting to kill Lin Jiufeng through the vibration caused by his roar itself.The terrifying scene of a flood dragon fiercely roaring in the air became deeply imprinted in the minds of everyone.A young man in green clothes with a cat in his arms stood on the ground beneath the flood dragon.In between the young man and the flood dragon, the wave of air gathered more power as it surged and flew over.Just the edges of this wave alone were enough to kill a Martial Sage.It was an understatement to say that it was terrifying.The Heaven Raising Bull watched this scene.His vision went dark, and the hope inside his heart was extinguished.Demon King Jiao actually dared to attack Lin Jiufeng?Every powerful and confident demon in that demon\u2019s den knew the consequences of such a foolish act.After all, each and every one of them had once received a beatdown from Lin Jiufeng.But now, Demon King Jiao directly made a move that shook the world, especially the powerhouses in the Imperial Capital. These powerhouses looked into the distance and saw this shocking scene from thousands of miles away.The flood dragon\u2019s boundless might surged as the Wei River itself overflowed.However, on the Wei River\u2019s riverbanks was a young man dressed in green. His pale complexion betrayed the relaxed light within his eyes as he faced the Demon King Jiao who was more than hundreds of times bigger than him in size.Demon King Jiao let out a loud roar.His terrifying aura alone scared those that were keen to watch the battle.Feeling the chill that ran down their spines\u2014they knew at that moment that if they were in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s shoes\u2014they could only wait for their deaths against such a horrible monster.But Lin Jiufeng was different.Strong winds blew against his face.His clothes fluttered in the wind, but his feet remained motionless as he stood tall similar to a towering mountain.In the face of this wave of air, Lin Jiufeng merely raised his hand.Without making any other move, he lightly tapped his finger in the air.Crack!The void cracked like a mirror in front of Lin Jiufeng.The violent wave of air directly collided with the shattered space.In an instant, the shattered space was torn apart.Shuash!The wave of air remained steadfast as it constantly tore apart the void itself. In a blink of an eye, it had assimilated with the shattered space, forming an even larger storm that continuously expanded like the universe.It headed for Lin Jiufeng, clearly wanting to devour him whole.Those who saw this scene didn\u2019t even blink.How could they possibly miss such an exciting showdown?\u201cDie!\u201d Demon King Jiao roared with laughter.Although he was arrogant, the Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling remained apprehensive when mentioning Lin Jiufeng\u2026As a result, he didn\u2019t hold back at all.He had recovered his strength and was now at the peak of the Grotto-Heaven Realm.This was his first time using all of his strength upon waking up in this brand new era.Amidst his roar of laughter was a true dragon\u2019s might that he had just mulled over and understood. Despite being arrogant, he was also a demon that would never spare any of his enemies. He didn\u2019t hold back because he didn\u2019t want to give his enemy a chance to strike.In his eyes, Lin Jiufeng had already lost.Lin Jiufeng didn\u2019t take his roar seriously at all and was actually still standing motionless on the ground down below.It would be far too late for this human to regret since he had already made his move.Lin Jiufeng looked at the shattered space.The shattered space had assimilated the wave of air as it continued to fly over to him.The white cat became anxious.She hurriedly said in Lin Jiufeng\u2019s arms. \u201cMove, hurry! Dodge this strike.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to dodge,\u201d Lin Jiufeng simply replied.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d The white cat looked at Lin Jiufeng in surprise.\u201cYou asked me before why I was waiting for the rain. Let me tell you now, I\u2019m waiting for this spring rain to cleanse this world so that I can make a breakthrough with one strike!\u201dLin Jiufeng looked at the white cat and smiled.He remained confident and powerful in the face of danger.Then, he took a step forward\u2026Clang!A black sword appeared in his hand.What appeared was his Demon Slaying Sword.Rumble!The combined might of the wave of air and the shattered space was tremendously powerful.But Lin Jiufeng merely drew his sword and slashed forcefully.Crack!A crisp sound reverberated as it echoed throughout heaven and earth.What happened next was something that no spectator wanted to miss.They watched on with their eyes wide openFrom a distance far away, the wave of air combined with the shattered space\u2019s might was sliced into two halves by Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword.The sword energy produced by his attack didn\u2019t stop, however, as it flew towards Demon King Jiao.In a blink of an eye, the sword energy sliced off the pair of dragon horns that Demon King Jiao had painstakingly formed on his forehead for the sake of his journey into becoming a true dragon.Demon King Jiao instantly let out a mournful cry.Blood rolled down his forehead, dying his head completely red.The rest of his blood fell into the Wei River and it dyed the water in the same color.\u201cH-How\u2026 How can you be so powerful? Who\u2026 What exactly are you?\u201d Demon King Jiao let out a blood-curdling scream as he stared at Lin Jiufeng in shock and anger.His confidence from before had long been wiped out by Lin Jiufeng\u2019s sword move.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to know who I am. I\u2019ve already asked the Heaven Raising Bull to persuade you, but you refused to listen,\u201d Lin Jiufeng said helplessly.With the sword in hand, he pointed at Demon King Jiao while shaking his head.\u201cYou\u2019ve actually surpassed the Grotto-Heaven Realm in this brand new era? Which old monster are you from the previous epoch?\u201d Demon King Jiao felt bitter.He hurriedly tried to escape.Lin Jiufeng was just too terrifying.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to escape.\u201d Lin Jiufeng looked at the escaping Demon King Jiao.He raised his brows and was about to attack once more.\u201cSenior, I beg you! Don\u2019t kill him! All seven of us can pay any price, just keep him alive!\u201d The Great Sage of the Heaven Leveling, the Heaven Raising Bull, moved in front of Lin Jiufeng.His two front hooves went soft as he knelt on the ground and pleaded pitifully.Lin Jiufeng looked at the Heaven Raising Bull. He suddenly recalled the countless sign-in opportunities in the past ten years that the demons in the demon\u2019s den beneath the Cold Palace had brought him.\u201cAlright, for your sake, I won\u2019t kill him. I can spare his life, but he can\u2019t go unpunished.\u201d Lin Jiufeng raised his hand, and a sword case appeared in his palm.With a flick of his finger, the sword case opened and 36 swords flew out from within.36 Swords of the Demonic Path!The 36 swords formed a terrifying sword formation, manifesting into a demonic dragon that Lin Jiufeng could control at will.The demonic dragon materialized in the air and let out a true dragon\u2019s roar.Roar!The dragon\u2019s roar immediately extinguished the energy in Demon King Jiao\u2019s body as he went soft and lost his strength to escape.\u201cSpare me, Senior!\u201d Demon King Jiao panicked as he immediately begged for mercy.\u201cBe obedient and stay in silence beneath the Wei River.\u201d Lin Jiufeng coldly snorted.With a thought, the demonic dragon formed from the 36 demonic swords roared and directly swallowed Demon King Jiao before it sank into the Wei River.Rumble!A dragon\u2019s tomb appeared in the vast Wei River.Surrounding the dragon\u2019s tomb were 36 demonic swords that stood steadfast, seemingly having the ability to pierce the skies.The Heaven Raising Bull watched this scene with a complex expression on his face.He had already begged for mercy. Right now, he didn\u2019t even dare to speak anymore.Amidst the heavy rain, Lin Jiufeng displayed changed the way everyone looked at the world.One of the Seven Great Sages\u2014Demon King Jiao\u2014who was powerful enough to overturn the rules of the world itself was easily suppressed by Lin Jiufeng.The scene of which everyone unanimously described as\u2014Suppressing the Flood Dragon With a Sword Beneath the Rain\u2014had already become a legend in the minds of those that witnessed it with their very own eyes.Till the day they died, they were bound to never forget it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
