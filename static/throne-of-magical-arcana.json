I don\u2019t wanna\u2026 die\u2026\u201cXiafeng, wake up\u2026 don\u2019t fall asleep\u2026\u201d\u2026The endless flaming red light suddenly dimmed, followed by a deep darkness. Like a drowning man, Xiafeng tried his very best to grab onto anything that could save him from this darkness.At that moment, like a rising sun, a red light appeared in front of him.In that light, Xiafeng felt his strength recovering slightly, so he struggled desperately to get closer to the light. After taking a step forward, Xiafeng saw the light becoming brighter and brighter, changing from flaming red to pure white. The darkness was thoroughly entrapped by the light and completely dissipated in a second.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Xiafeng suddenly sat back up and was now panting with great effort. In his dream, the smoke of a terrifying fire had made him lose all means of resistance, leaving him unable to do anything but helplessly lie on the ground and wait for the flames to devour him. Like being constrained by a ghost, he knew that he was in a nightmare, but he just could not wake himself up.The dream was so real that it took Xiafeng quite a while to recover. After his fast-beating heart calmed down, he finally remembered that he had been working on his essay for the whole night in the school library. \u201cNo wonder I dreamed about the fire, I\u2019m practically burning my life here these days,\u201d Xiafeng thought to himself in a self-deprecating way.When he roused himself and was about to collect all the reference books and go back to the dorm, Xiafeng was stunned with the strange and unimaginable scene in front of him. Like being struck in the head, he was shocked and his mind went blank.All the nice-looking wooden desks were gone. There were no piles of reference books, paper manuscripts, and laptops. The only thing left was an old black blanket with loose threads covering him.Instead of sitting in the library chair, he was actually sitting on a narrow wooden bed.\u201cWhere am I?!\u201dIn this situation, even a person like Xiafeng, who was relatively quiet and slow, could feel things were going wrong. Even if he was caught in a fire and sent to a hospital, this place definitely did not resemble a hospital! Not even close!His heartbeat rose up due to the shock. He looked around and tried to stand up on his feet, but as soon as he put his feet on the ground, a sense of dizziness and weakness spread over him and almost made him hit the ground.Xiafeng hurriedly reached out and grabbed the handle of the bed to retain his balance. His face was pale and his heart was beating very fast. He was already aware of the surroundings from the quick look just now.This was a small shack. Including the wooden bed, there was a wooden table, which could possibly fall apart at any moment, two relatively ok-looking stools, and a crate with a hole in it. On the other side of the deteriorated wooden door, there was a crock hanging, a worn old stove was under it. The fire had been put out for quite a while. Just chilly kindling was lying underneath.Everything seemed strange to him. Xiafeng had no idea where he was. The weak and dizzy feeling was bothering him a lot as well:\u201cWhere is this place?! It feels like I just recovered from a serious illness\u2026 like pneumonia I had in high school.\u201d\u2026Countless thoughts were going through his mind, but Xiafeng had never been in this extremely weird situation before. Panic was violently stirring up in his mind.The only thing he felt lucky for was that there was nothing unpleasant or horrible that showed up. So, Xiafeng took several deep breaths and calmed himself down. Then, a loud shout came from afar outside the shack:\u201cBurn the witch! Aderon Cathedral is going to burn a witch!\u201d\u201cEverybody!\u201d\u201cBurn that damn witch to ashes!\u201dFear and excitement were mingled together in that strange accent. Xiafeng was distracted from his panic and felt curious, he thought to himself, \u201cWitch? What on earth is this world?\u201dAs an adult, Xiafeng could definitely feel that something bad was going to happen there. But his thought was cut off by a sudden crashing sound that came from the door. A twelve or thirteen-year-old boy came rushing in.\u201cLucien!\u201d The brown-haired boy, wearing linen clothes reaching to his knees, was standing beside the bed as he exclaimed in surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re awake! Thank god!\u201dLooking at the boy\u2019s completely different-styled clothes, Xiafeng nodded his head unconsciously. A ridiculous thought arose in his messy mind: \u201cLucien\u2026 Witch\u2026 Cathedral\u2026 Burn\u2026 Am I in a different world or even in another dimension? It seems like\u2026 I am in \u2018The Middle Ages\u2019 of Europe now, at the time when witch hunting was prevalent\u2026\u201dIf things had to go wrong, they always would. Murphy\u2019s Law was reminding Xiafeng in a cold way. The color of the boy\u2019s hair and his clothes were all proof of his guess. Xiafeng could instinctively understand and speak this unknown language, but he was far from being a linguist, so he could not even tell what kind of language they were speaking.The small boy, with several dusty black marks on his face, was not surprised at all when he saw Xiafeng\u2019s strange behavior. \u201cMom didn\u2019t believe me. During mid-night she always cries, and her eyes would swell up with tears, she keeps murmuring, \u2018my poor little Evans\u2019, like you were already buried in the cemetery.\u201d\u201cDaddy didn\u2019t know what to do, so he asked that little bastard Simon to bring a message to Lord Venn\u2019s mansion, asking for my brother to somehow come back. Now he is a Knight\u2019s Squire. Of course, the charity doctor would not dare to claim his unreasonable, ridiculous price in front of a knight squire!\u201d The boy talked with his chin slightly raised, feeling sincerely proud.\u201cBut look, I was right! I knew you were gonna be fine! I knew it!\u201d\u2014 he was talking, he grabbed Xiafeng\u2019s arm \u2014 \u201cLet\u2019s go! They are gonna burn that vicious witch. It\u2019s the very same witch who made you go to jail and be interrogated for the whole night by the church guards!\u201dXiafeng wanted to think more about his current situation, so he was not interested in going out at all. Besides, they were going to burn a person to death. That was something completely unacceptable for the kind-hearted Xiafeng, at least, he believed he was. But the last thing the boy mentioned shocked him, \u201cThe witch had something to do with me?\u201dXiafeng, therefore, changed his mind. With his arm in the boy\u2019s hand, he stumbled out of the room and followed the boy towards the cathedral.Xiafeng looked around the people on the way. It was warm outside. Most men were wearing narrow-sleeved linen clothes, the same color pants and shoes without heels, while women wore monotonous roughly cut long dresses with big pockets. It was simple and old.Most of them had brown hair and eyes, while some outstanding-outlined faces had red or black hair with green or blue eyes.\u201cThis is really Middle Age?\u201d Xiafeng found out he himself was wearing the same clothes.Soon after they came out of the slum filled with low and shabby shacks, they saw a not so large but solemn and grand cathedral with high arched ceilings in front of them. On the biggest ceiling hung a large white cross. The windows under it were very narrow and small.Lots of people had gathered there already. Following the small boy, Xiafeng squeezed through the crowd and kept pushing forward. This made some people irritated and they stared at them angrily, but they knew that as adults, they could not misbehave on the square of Aderon.Soon, Xiafeng could see ahead. They were in the very front of the crowd now.In the center of the square, a twenty-something, pale-faced beautiful woman in a black robe was tied to a wooden cross. People were throwing stones and pieces of wood while shouting, swearing, and spitting at her:\u201cGo to hell! Damned witch!\u201d\u201cYou wanted everyone in Aderon to die!?\u201d\u201cMy poor Tracy! She died several months ago\u2026 Must be because of you! You evil!\u201d\u2026The woman in the black robe got hit several times, but she just tightly shut her pale and thin lips, without letting out a groan. Standing there like a statue, she looked at the crowd.In the front of the crowd stood a middle-aged man wearing a baggy white golden embroidered robe, with a white beret on his head and a white cross in his hands. He remained silent all the time, appearing solemn and respectful. Several men and women were standing behind him. All of them were wearing the same neat white robes. Their faces were fresh and rosy, standing in a sharp contrast to the poor and dirty crowd on the square.Behind the white robes, there was a mighty row of armored guards in chainmail.The middle-aged man looked at his pocket watch and stepped forward. He raised the round badge in his hand.Instantly, those indignant and resentful people who were arguing all shut their mouths and quieted down.Xiafeng could hear the sound of wind passing through people\u2019s clothes.He was very impressed. Even in contemporary society, people\u2019s absolute obedience and quick response like this would require at least several months\u2019 of training. What kind of authority or power could be able to make all those poor people be so compliant like an army?The middle-aged man was holding the badge, speaking with a low but penetrating voice which resounded all over the square, \u201cYou poor sinner. You are deceived by the devil and become greedy for power. Both your body and soul have been corrupted. Only the Light can purify. It is punishment, but also the mercy of God.\u201d\u201cBurn her! Burn her!\u201d People\u2019s cries started gathering together and becoming louder and louder.The scene of the fanatical people crying loudly at the same time made Xiafeng shudder. If they knew he actually came from another world, Lucien, or say, Xiafeng, whose soul had been occupied by the \u201cdemon\u201d, would be the one on the gallows next time.\u201cBefore the Light shades on you,\u201d the man asked in a merciful manner, \u201cConfess your sins! Sincere penitence can save your soul. Then your soul would ascend to heaven where God lives.\u201dThe women in the black robe suddenly started crazily laughing, her voice was very powerful. \u201cWhat I pursue is the true form of magic, not the true form of God! Burn me! I will see your heaven being destroyed and your cathedral collapse in the flames!\u201d\u201cInsane!\u201d\u201cVicious!\u201d\u201cShe cursed the bishop! Kill them all! These damned witches following the demons!\u201d\u201cBurn her to ashes!\u201dThe bishop remained silent, but the poor people were screaming and shouting hysterically with great fever.It was the first time for Xiafeng to see this kind of terrifying madness. \u201cToo dangerous here.\u201d He was deeply shocked.He really wanted to be caring towards that woman, but he dared not take any action or those insane individuals would execute him with huge amounts of rocks. Xiafeng was also confused to find that there was no wood beneath that woman.\u201cHow are they gonna burn her without any firewood?\u201dThe bishop started praying, his voice was loud and cold, \u201cYou, the sinner. Go to hell under the Light!\u201dThe cross in his hand suddenly burst forth with splendid light. The light was so bright that all Xiafeng could see was a white mass.It was like the bishop was holding a small sun, solemn, pure, and grand looking. Including the small boy, everyone lowered their heads and started praying.Beams of light gathered and took off capably to the unmistakable blue sky. When it reached the ceiling, the light reflected back and fell straightforwardly on the gallows.Fierce red flames flared up even higher than a person\u2019s height and devoured the woman.She laughed and cursed Insanely.\u201cIn the blazes, I will see your shrewd paradise demolished.\u201d\u201cIn the blazes, I will see your fabulous house of God crumbling.\u201d\u201cIn the blazes, I will see you individuals everlastingly worsened!\u201d\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHer thrilling cries and curses were lingering in everyone\u2019s ears until she was burned down to ashes.However, Xiafeng was completely stunned since earlier when the cross erupted with dazzling light.\u201cThis is not medieval Europe\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a world where magic truly exists!\u201d\u201cMy name is\u2026 Lucien\u2026\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, her maniacal laughter and curses were still lingering there. Many people shuddered in fear and looked around, then they followed the bishop into the cathedral where they started to pray and confess their sins.Lucien felt as if the blazingly bright light was still present in the square. He could still feel the sacred and dominating power the light contained. Xiafeng was so shocked that he had already made up his mind to accept his identity as Lucien. He needed to bury his past in the very bottom of his heart, in fear that people in this world might regard him as evil too.\u201cThe divine power is so amazing\u2026\u201d Instead of feeling awed or even terrified by that power like common people, Lucien was wondering if he could have a chance of learning it.At this time, Lucien got such a heavy slap on his left shoulder that he almost lost his footing.\u201cOh, my poor little Evans! Thank God! Thank God, you don\u2019t have to suffer like your poor father! A nice young fellow like you deserves God\u2019s grace!\u201dLucien was dragged back from his thoughts. He found a middle-aged woman, who was twice his size, wiping her tears of joy as she kept patting his shoulder with her bear-paw-liked huge palms.Lucien managed to move a little bit to evade her palm which almost made him cough out blood. He opened his mouth but could not speak a word. He did not know her name, not even his own full name. Should he be Lucien Evans?After watching him just standing there, the woman had an even more sorry look on her face. \u201cMy little Evans. You\u2019re still suffering from your mental illness. Look at you, so skinny\u2026\u201dXiafeng was embarrassed because he had not acquired any memory from Lucien. He was also afraid of letting people know that he was not the real Lucien. From a certain perspective, yes, Lucien\u2019s body now was genuinely being occupied by someone else.Fortunately, a middle-aged man standing beside the middle-aged woman stopped her. \u201cAlisa, don\u2019t talk to little Evans too much. He has just recovered. He must be feeling tired right now. Iven, help your mom and let\u2019s go home.\u201dThe blonde-haired man was kind of skinny with his back bending forward slightly. But Lucien could still tell he was a good-looking guy in his younger days. For Lucien, the man was like an angel, who saved him from this difficult situation.\u201cThanks, auntie Alisa. I\u2019m fine. Just feeling a little bit dizzy.\u201d Lucien responded carefully.The boy, Iven, who dragged Lucien here to see the witch, was holding his mom\u2019s arm. He made a funny face and said to his mom, \u201cI knew he was not gonna die. Only you always think that he\u2019s still a baby who needs to be taken care of all the time.\u201dAuntie Alisa was still wiping her tears, \u201cEvans, it\u2019s so nice to see you\u2019re getting better now. She deserved this! That damned vicious witch!\u201dShe kept on nagging while walking, \u201cWhen she just moved close to your place, she looked so beautiful and nice. I was even thinking of marrying her to my little John. But she, she was a witch! She tried to steal the bodies buried in the cemetery to experiment her evil spells! Thanks to God! The night watchman of the inquisition caught her red-handed while stealing! I can\u2019t even imagine if she had succeeded, how many people would die in our area\u2026\u201dFollowing them, Lucien got a brief overview of what happened from Alisa\u2019s words. The woman got caught by the night watchman. As her neighbor, Lucien was also put under the interrogation of the inquisition. They probably used some kind of holy spell on him which affected him mentally. So they did figure out that he was innocent, but at the same time, they seriously hurt the real Lucien. He died after that and, therefore, Xiafeng got the chance to possess his body.The man noticed that Lucien remained silent all the way. He patted on Lucien\u2019s shoulder, comforting him in a low voice, \u201cShe\u2019s just like this. Just ignore her.\u201dLucien nodded.The man looked at Alisa from behind and sighed. \u201cAlisa, she was such a pleasant and beautiful girl in the past, but after she gave birth to John, she was like being controlled by the demon. Barely one year after we married, she became like this\u2026\u201dHe emotionally sighed again. He paused a bit and added, \u201cI\u2019m no longer a well-matched opponent for her, though.\u201dLucien was still suffering from his wide mood swings. He forced out a smile and did not say anything. He did not know the man\u2019s name yet.Somehow, Alisa heard her husband\u2019s complaint. She threw back a snort of contempt, \u201cJoel, the bard, you, who was once full of passion and romance, the young guy who came here to pursue his dream of music, are an incorrigible drunkard now.\u201dJoel smiled awkwardly. \u201cAalto is the City of Psalm. Countless young people are flocking to the city in pursuit of their dreams. But how many of them ever succeed? By the way, Alisa, I\u2019ve quit drinking since John started working\u2026\u201dAuntie Alisa looked back and stared at him, \u201cThanks God. You understand that we\u2019ve put all our hope on John and Iven. John\u2019s a good boy. He worked so hard and was selected by Sir Knight Venn as his squire. If John can manage to awaken the \u2018Blessing\u2019 in his blood and be knighted by the grand duke, then our son can be a lord! A respectable nobility!\u201dJoel shuddered slightly under the stern gaze from his wife, that just then thought about Lucien.\u201cOh! I\u2019m so sorry, little Evans!\u201d Alisa stopped herself and winked at Joel for help, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean that! You\u2019re talented too\u2026 You just needed more training when you were younger\u2026\u201dBut the apology did not really help with the situation.Joel laughed loudly and patted Lucien\u2019s shoulder again. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. Our Lucien is the guy who\u2019s gonna carry forward my dream of becoming a musician!\u201dLucien was not really paying attention to them. He half-heartedly said with a giggle, \u201cYeah\u2026I wanna be a musician\u2026\u201dSeeing Lucien laughing, Alisa felt relieved and continued her nagging again, which actually helped Lucien know more about the city.The City of Aalto was a big and prosperous city, located close to the Dark Mountain Range. It enjoyed the reputation as the City of Psalm and was full of opportunities.This area was named Aderon, which was the place where the poorest of peoples in Aalto gathered. Besides, because of his absence due to illness for the past couple of days, Lucien had already lost his job as a porter in the market.A moment later, the four of them arrived in front of Lucien\u2019s place.Alisa invited Lucien for dinner but he politely refused her, \u201cThanks, Aunty Alisa, but I need some more rest.\u201dBefore leaving, little Iven moved closer to Lucien, and asked curiously, \u201cLucien, when did you decide to become a musician? You never told me about it before\u2026\u201d\u201c5 minutes ago,\u201d Lucien answered emotionlessly.\u201cOH\u2026 I\u2026 SEE\u2026\u201d Iven nodded admiringly.After getting into his shack, Lucien locked the door from inside. He sat there unconsciously and buried his head deep into his elbows.\u201cNo kidding! I\u2019m in a different world!\u201cA crazy world where magic actually exists!\u201cIn this world, they burn people alive! With gallows!\u201dLucien\u2019s strong emotions finally burst out. He was surprised and scared. Xiafeng was kind of shy and not really experienced in his own world. Before, he often panicked facing difficult situation, but this time, Xiafeng himself was even surprised seeing how he managed to remain calm until now.Difficulties forge a person stronger. Time went by and night came. Lucien finally calmed himself down; Since he had decided to live in this time period, now he should not panic, worry or be scared at all. He should plan for his future carefully. If he died again this time, he was pretty sure it would be forever.He stopped himself from worrying about his parents and friends. When he was about to plan for what to do next, hunger struck him. It felt like there was a fire burning inside his stomach. Lucien swallowed his saliva several times and decided to find something to eat first.He walked towards the only crate in his place. Inside of the big box, except for some old clothes, there were two loafs of \u201cbread-shaped\u201d black thing and seven copper coins.Hunger controlled his brain. Lucien hurriedly took a big bite.\u201cCrack!\u201d This bite almost destroyed Lucien\u2019s front teeth. \u201cWhat the hell? It\u2019s like a wooden club?\u201dIt took Lucien quite a while to make sure the thing he was holding was a real bread, which was just hard enough to knock out an adult.Fighting against his hunger, Lucien found some flints in the crate and started roasting his bread.\u201cBrown Braised Pork, Spicy Chicken Wings, Roasted Beef, Kung Pao Chicken\u2026\u201d he muttered while staring at the bread as it was being roasted. When the bread became a little bit soft, Lucien could not stop himself and took a hurried bite\u2026 It was like\u2026chewing a piece of wood.But, that was all Lucien had. He devoured the bread and sighed. \u201cI\u2019d rather die if I\u2019m gonna eat this every day\u2026 I must earn more\u2026 I don\u2019t want to live like this.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThen he thought about the bishop and the pastors. Neatly dressed, they looked so noble with their incredible divine power. Lucien felt excited. \u201cI wonder if I could learn that power and become like one of them\u2026\u201d But the next moment he changed his mind, \u201c\u2026No\u2026a person like me going to church, it\u2019s like myself asking them to burn me to ashes. I don\u2019t know if there are other ways there, say\u2026 that blessing?\u201cWhat about all the knowledge I learned in my previous world. Is it still useful here?\u201d Stuffing the bread into his mouth, Lucien started thinking about how to make a living. When he was retrieving the knowledge he learned in the university, he found something astonishing present in his brain.After taking a close look, Lucien\u2019s eyes opened wide in surprise. \u201cThese are\u2026 these are the books from the library. They also came here\u2026 with me?\u201dAll the books collected in the library were present there in his mind. Instead of describing them as memories or, say, Lucien\u2019s own knowledge, they were more like projections or visuals placed into different categories, ready to be read by Lucien anytime.Lucien tried to read them with great curiosity. But, Lucien found that he could not open a majority of them. They were locked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What confused him more was that most of the books were locked.He tried to remain calm so that the visuals of the books could be more 'solid\u201d or 'substantial\u201d as entities. He went through them one by one and recorded the ones that could be read and the ones that could not.\u201cHistory\u2026 no problem\u2026\u201cEconomics\u2026 yup.\u201cArts\u2026 fine.\u201cMathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology\u2026 some of them are locked.\u201cIs it because I\u2019m in a different world, so I cannot read these books? I can still come up with the knowledge I gained at my university, though, it hasn\u2019t been blocked.\u201dMost of the unlocked books were of senior high or high school level, which was a small amount compared to teaching references of a university\u2019s general library. There were numerous other books locked there.Lucien was too weak to go through each category, and soon he was unable to concentrate anymore.He dragged his feet back to the bed to get a good sleep so that he could face his second day in this world better. Only one loaf of bread was left there. Survival was always the priority, Lucien too understood this.When his mind was getting dull and he almost went into his sweet dream, a rat\u2019s piercing squeak and noises of wood biting woke him up.\u201cRats?\u201dAt first, he did not pay much attention to it. He turned over in bed and was ready to fall asleep again. But the noise was getting louder and more disturbing like someone was grinding teeth on a rock.Lucien could not fall asleep anymore. He tried to cover his ears with the blanket but the attempt was in vain; the noise had a penetrating power, and it felt like it was coming from all directions.\u201cBloody hell!\u201d Feeling frustrated, Lucien cursed out loud. He was almost going insane; food tasted like wood; roughly-cut clothes irritated his skin; the old blanket was full of holes\u2026 Now he could not even have a good sleep! Squeak\u2026squeak\u2026he heard squeaking noises like thousands of mice were scratching a wall.Lucien gnashed his teeth in anger. He decided to kill one or two of the rats to scare the rest of them away. He got out of his bed and tried to listen carefully.\u201cI gotta get rid of this life. Soon.\u201d*sob\u2026 sob* *cry*\u2026 Now it was like someone was crying.Lucien tried to focus, but he found there was only ghastly bitter crying lingering there.Someone was crying\u2026 at midnight. Lucien\u2019s heart was beating fast, his brain flushed. Every hair on his body stood up. The freezing night wind blew through the broken door. Lucien grabbed the hard bread loaf to defend himself.The crying voice now sounded like a miserable song. Lucien was even more afraid now. \u201cIt\u2019s a world of magic and divinity power. Probably there are ghosts and spirits too!\u201dTaking a deep breath, Lucien tried his very best to calm down and moved towards the door. Someone was crying mournfully. The night was so quiet. It was like all his neighbors were lost in their dreams.\u201cIt\u2019s coming from\u2026 the right side of the wall.\u201d The closer Lucien got to the door, the clearer he could hear the crying voice, \u201cWait\u2026 the witch! The witch used to live there!\u201dHe was stunned, \u201cBut her place had been burned down completely by the church. Maybe\u2026 they missed something, like a secret chamber. She might have stored her vicious experiments there.\u201dLucien\u2019s mind went away a little bit. A secret chamber\u2026 like many novels he read before, he could probably find the witch\u2019s treasure or even notes on magic.The piercing crying dragged him back to reality. \u201cYeah\u2026 get real. Something must be guarding there. How can I fight against a ghost with a bread loaf in my hands?\u201cProbably I\u2019d be killed and possessed by the evil ghosts!\u201dHe got more careful now. Lucien was glad that his mind was not controlled by the greed. But he also did not want to keep waiting here. Nobody knew if the ghost would try to come for him.Lucien was thinking very fast. At the moment, he gathered all the strength he could muster, and carefully grabbed the handle of the door. The bread in his hand was now soaked with his sweat.He slowly opened the door. It was very dark outside and he could hear the whistling sound of cold wind.There was nothing terrifying there, and after he left his shack the crying voice dimmed a bit. He felt a little bit relieved and took a deep breath, then started shouting as loud as he could:\u201cGhost! There\u2019s a ghost here!\u201dIt was so loud that even Lucien himself got surprised.Then came a series of roaring barks from the wild dogs, and Lucien started madly rushing to the cathedral. These guys were professionals in this kind of stuff!As the previous neighbor of the witch, he might still be under the church\u2019s watch and there was one more benefit: Lucien\u2019s asking for help on his own could help him gain some of their trust while reducing the suspicion.Lucien shouted loudly to wake up the other neighbors so that if they attempted to rob the treasure and frame him or even kill him for it, they wouldn\u2019t be able to do so in front of the crowd. He tried his best to think of every measure to save his life in such a short time.Soon, he saw the cathedral in front of him with candlelight casting out of the windows.Two armored guards were guarding the front gate. Seeing Lucien running towards them in panic, one of the guards pulled half of his sword out to be alert.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d The other guard asked as he reached out his hand to stop Lucien.Lucien answered with trembling voice. \u201cGhost. There\u2019s a ghost there! In the witch\u2019s place!\u201dThe guard got nervous after hearing that. As a newly recruited guard, he could not tell whether Lucien was telling the truth or not. So, he asked his partner to stay and went back into the cathedral to report to the pastor on duty tonight. The noise from his chainmail gradually faded as he disappeared into the darkness.A short while later, a blond young pastor in a white robe walked out of the gate with the guard.The pastor had a thin face. He walked in an elegant rhythm. \u201cI\u2019m Pastor Benjamin. Can you tell me what happened?\u201dThe two guards were standing silently, in fear that any noise from them might disturb Pastor Benjamin.Lucien, politely and sincerely, described in detail how he heard the ghost\u2019s crying voice, how he got out of his place and ran here asking for their help.After hearing him, Benjamin gave Lucien a gentle smile, \u201cYou did well, my child. Your courage shows your devotion to God.\u201dThen he ordered the guards, \u201cThomson, get Gary, Paul and the two other knights here. The witch was just an apprentice. So, there\u2019s no need to report this to the Bishop.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord,\u201d Thomson replied reverently. Although Benjamin was only an Elementary Level Pastor, he was capable of dealing with the traps or spells left by a sorcerer\u2019s apprentice. There was a huge gap between a formal pastor and an apprentice.Benjamin asked Lucien\u2019s name and stopped their conversation when the other four knights arrived; they were also wearing chain mails, but they looked much more imposing compared to the other two guards.A crowd had already gathered some distance away from the witch\u2019s burned cabin. Candlelight flickered like scattered stars as if accompanying the moon in the sky.Lucien discovered that the moon in this world was silver colored.People stopped whispering when Benjamin showed up. The crowd suddenly felt relieved and started getting closer to the witch\u2019s cabin while talking to each other.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI don\u2019t hear anything.\u201d\u201cNo matter if it\u2019s true or not, it does no harm to have a purification performed here.\u201dBut Lucien could still hear the crying voice. He thought to himself, Why can\u2019t these people hear it?Benjamin, as if knowing what he was thinking, replied to Lucien calmly, \u201cYes. There are ghosts present here.\u201dObviously, he heard it, as well as the four guards, who nodded to show their consent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He talked in a low and gentle voice, \u201cVicious witches, they exploit people\u2019s psyche and awareness. Especially like today\u2019s night, when the silver moon is present in the sky. That woman, fortunately, hasn\u2019t gained any real dark power. Her spells can only affect several individuals at most.\u201dHe was clarifying why only Lucien could hear the crying voice. Before Lucien could ask, as if he knew what he wanted to ask. Benjamin reached out his hands wearing white gloves and continued, \u201cWe are blessed. So only we can hear the wicked crying.\u201dWhen Benjamin said that, the four guards instantly began drawing crosses on their chests and started yelling at the same time:\u201cOnly truth lives forever.\u201dThey became more excited as they spoke.The crowd started praying as well. \u201cOnly truth lives forever.\u201d\u201cThis is the power of divinity\u2026 Pastor Benjamin is truly blessed by God.\u201dBenjamin\u2019s face now looked more solemn and serious. He slowly opened his hands and spelled out an odd word:\u201cPaso.\u201dInstantly a sheet of white light covered the ruins like it was coming from the moon.In the white light, a small scarlet hole emerged on the broken wall connecting it to Lucien\u2019s place.Like the surrounding people, the mysterious power also shocked Lucien. But, rather than being awed and respectful like the crowd, he yearned for the divinity.Benjamin put his hands back and ordered, \u201cGary, that is the door. It doesn\u2019t have any trap. Go and open it.\u201dGary puffed out his chest, as the sound of his chainmail clashing came, \u201cYes, my lord.\u201dAs Gary walked past them, Lucien heard Benjamin complaining in a low voice. \u201cThose haughty inquisition bastards! Except \u2018Magic Trap Detection\u2019, they never bother double checking with \u2018Secret Door Detection\u2019. They can\u2019t be so irresponsible just because she was an apprentice.\u201dGary, effortlessly, broke down the wall with his strong muscle. The other guard hauled out his heavy sword and fiercely hacked. A black hole appeared in the corner of the wall.It was a narrow hole, enough for only one person to pass through. A stinking smell came from it, which made Lucien almost throw up. Lucien took a couple of steps backward, and he noticed that Benjamin was covering his nose and mouth with the right hand, with his eyebrows frowning.Gary reported, \u201cThis tunnel leads to the sewers.\u201dBenjamin was still frowning his eyebrows. His muffled voice came from under his covered mouth, \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYes. We can see the sewer from here.\u201d Gary was pretty certain.As an elegant and noble pastor from the long-established and honored Rafati family, Benjamin was more than reluctant to go down into the smelly, dirty pipes. He had not mastered a \u201cPurifying\u201d spell yet, so he must rely on the runes and divinity instruments. But no one knew how long it would take to find the witch\u2019s chamber.\u201cHmm\u2026 Just a Sorcerer Apprentice, a Saint Truth Badge would be enough.\u201d Benjamin turned his eyes towards Lucien. His voice became solemn again.\u201cLucien, you once lived near that vicious witch. Something evil must have contaminated you. But your devotion towards God touched me, and you deserve a chance to purify the evil in there as well as yourself. Go, Lucien, I\u2019m gonna lend you my badge to help you. May God bless you.\u201dLucien\u2019s brain started buzzing like it had just got hammered. He thought everything was going to be fine after he went to Pastor Benjamin and the guards. But, the pastor told him to go down there! He was just an ordinary guy, who recently recovered from illness, but now he had to go underground to face the devil! Were they kidding?Seeing Lucien\u2019s dumbfounded and hesitant face, Benjamin kindly asked,\u201cYou are saying\u2026 NO?\u201dLucien felt terrified hearing Benjamin\u2019s gentle voice. If he refused, he might again get suspected by the church. Besides, Benjamin will lend him the magic badge and his guards were supposed to go with Lucien. Lucien thought this mission would not be that dangerous.Lucien had no choice though. The crowd was praising Pastor Benjamin\u2019s generosity and the Mercy of God. Lucien squeezed out a bitter smile and answered, \u201cNo. That would be my honor.\u201dThe pastor just ignored Lucien\u2019s bitterness. He took off the badge on his neck and handed it to Lucien. \u201cThis is the Saint Truth Badge. I\u2019ll cast a Blessing spell on you as well, so you can focus better. When you chant the spell and touch the badge, you can call the power of God.\u201dHearing his words, Lucien calmed down a little bit, then he started getting curious about the badge.It was a gold badge embedded with a shining white cross, around which were different lines and patterns such as circles, squares, triangles. They were connected with each other, giving it an even more mysterious and solemn look.When Lucien was holding the badge, he felt a gentle and loving power penetrating all over his body. Even in the cold night, Lucien felt like he was standing under the warm sunshine.\u201cThe badge contains two inferior spells: Light and Minor Injury Healing. It additionally contains three level-one spells: Shield of Light, Sword of Light, and Holy Strike. Each can be used once a day. Now, pay attention to the chants.\u201dAs an ordinary individual, Lucien understood how important these spells were to him. The spells were not long, but rather their tone was hard to master. It took him a while to barely remember them.Benjamin reached out his hand again, casting a beam of white light on Lucien. Lucien felt refreshed and much healthier after the light vanished. People\u2019s voices also became more clear to him:\u201cThis guy got the badge from Pastor Benjamin.\u201d\u201cOh! Benevolent Lord Benjamin!\u201d\u201cWe praise god! We praise the pastor!\u201dLucien waited and watched Benjamin casting Blessing on the guards. There was always an interval of two to three seconds between his castings.After the preparation, Benjamin said, \u201cPaul, you stay at the entrance here. Gary, Howson, Corella, you go in with Lucien.\u201dHis face then became serious as he drew a cross on his chest, \u201cMay the lights of God bless you.\u201d\u201cOnly truth lives forever!\u201d Those guards got energized and started shouting. Lucien was a little bit slow, standing there he felt embarrassed.As they were walking towards the tunnel, the guard, Paul, went near Benjamin and asked in a low voice, \u201cMy lord, why him?\u201dWith the badge and spells, the guards could bring out the power as well. Despite the fact that they were slower than the pastors, they were still much better than a weak young boy. If Benjamin did not want to go down there on his own, he could still ask the guards to do the job.The pastor looked at the entrance of the secret passage, and replied slowly, \u201cHis soul is stronger than the average person. He can do the work better.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too old to be taught, though,\u201d he added.\u2026\u2026The mixed, stinking smell inside the hole made Lucien almost throw up.\u201cYou live in Aderon, and you dislike the smell of pipe? It seems like you all are living a better life than I thought. In the City of Chant, Antiffler, poor people with nowhere to hide live in the sewers.\u201d Corella, a guy with black hair and big cheekbones, remarked unexpectedly.Before Lucien opened his mouth, Gary moved and shushed Corella.The latter shrugged his shoulders and stopped talking. He stepped forward and jumped into the pipes, followed by Lucien.Lucien stepped on something slippery. After taking a close look, he found that they were weird mosses. They were everywhere and slightly lighted the whole space.Gary kept his voice low, \u201cI, Howson, and Corella are high-level knight squires. We\u2019ll try our best to protect you. When you are in danger, summon the Sword of Light as soon as possible.\u201d He wore blond whiskers. Every movement of his was calm and confident. He seemed like the acknowledged leader of the four guards.Gary was holding the sword in his right hand and a small shield in the left. He took the lead and moved deeper into the darkness.The miserable crying was increasing louder and louder. It originated from all around. For ordinary people, it was almost impossible to tell the direction. But, the special-trained guards and \u2018blessed\u2019 Lucien could easily find where the crying was coming from.No one was living down here as Corella mentioned. The whole space was terrifyingly quiet except for the lingering bitter crying.They passed several forks and stopped at a normal corner.Gary stared at the wall which was fully covered by dark green moss, telling Lucien in a cool voice, \u201cSummon the Sword of Light.\u201dTerrified and excited, Lucien calmed himself down under the help of Blessing and began concentrating on the badge hanging on his neck, feeling the warm and soft power in it. He put his left hand on the badge and gently rubbed it, and at the same time, he whispered:\u201cGeesairon.\u201dLucien\u2019s spirit blended with the white light and began to form into a shining sword.\u201cThis is my voice?\u201d Lucien was surprised. His voice sounded deep and husky.Lucien grabbed the sword. He could feel the power. Gary\u2019s order pulled him back to reality, \u201cSlash the wall there.\u201dHis body trembled slightly. Lucien didn\u2019t know what he was going to face: Powerful magic? Evil ghost? Fatal trap? He had no idea.Corella sneered at him.Lucien knew he had no other choice. He took a deep breath, clenched his teeth, and screamed loudly in his mind:Death is not a big deal!He slashed the disgusting slippery wall with all his might. The stone was like a pile of mud before the sword. Something weird got cut inside as well. Lucien felt something breaking, with dark gas leaking, and disappearing under the sword edge.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe wall collapsed completely.Behind the wall, there was endless deep darkness.Suddenly, two weird, cold, hideous spots of red rose in the darkness.And then more and more scarlet spots started emerging, densely dotted.They resembled\u2026 pairs of eyes!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Different thoughts about what he should or should not do overwhelmed him, so he just stood there.\u201cBadge! I still have the badge!\u201dThe badge was his greatest support. When Lucien was trying to concentrate and cast the shield spell, a sudden shout from Gary almost terrified him out of his wits.\u201cCast Light!\u201d Gary\u2019s voice was calm and decisive. He shouted loudly to bring them back to the reality from fear.Right! Lucien realized that their top priority was to be able to see clearly. He rubbed the badge and murmured, \u201cGaya.\u201dA ball of white light appeared in front of them and pushed the darkness away.Then Lucien saw them, red-eyed rats of regular size. The floor, walls and even a weird human-shaped plant were all covered with the black rats like a crazy swarm, giving Lucien goose bumps.The rats also saw their enemies. As soon as the light appeared, they started screaming and flooding towards the humans.At that moment, they managed to take a glimpse of the chamber: a desk was placed in the corner with three glowing books on it; another flat, broad, weird-looking table was at the center of the room, drawn with different strange patterns, like red, blue or green, similar to the Saint Truth Badge. There were also some small stoves, pots, and glass bottles.But, they did not get enough time to notice details as those crazy stinking monsters already jumped in front of them.Howson and Corella held their swords and shields, with their backs against Gary, in a simple formation.The leading rat threw himself right at Lucien. Its mouth was open wide, showing its two long and sharp fangs.Lucien raised his Sword of Light and hurriedly swung at the head of the red-eyed rat. However, he was too nervous to predict the rat\u2019s movement, and the blade missed, although the light coming out of the sword still caught it. Lucien could smell the rat\u2019s burning flesh. Its skin turned black and rolled up inwards.But the rat did not stop and was already in front of Lucien\u2019s face as if it could not feel the pain. He could smell the rotting odor coming from its mouth.Lucien was too nervous to make the right decision. He tried to lift his sword once again and at the same time reached out his left hand to try to defend. Due to his panic he almost dropped the sword.Feeling desperate, Lucien couldn\u2019t help but watch the creature about to sink its sharp teeth into his chest.At this critical point, a shining blade arrived and hacked the rat directly, splitting it in two parts.\u201cDo not panic. Protect your vital parts. You still have the healing spell.\u201d Commanded Gary.Corella also ordered in a sharp voice, \u201cYou idiot! Come here with us! You wanna die standing at the front?\u201dThey were aware that Lucien was the only guy among them with a badge, which was very important to them. They could probably survive facing these insane rats without any spells, but no one knew what was waiting for them next.Lucien tried to calm himself down. The guards were well-trained, so when facing dangers they knew what they should do. But, Lucien, a little boy, could not protect himself. No one was born for fighting, or with the ability to remain calm in the face of dangers.In this first real fight, the guidance from an experienced guard like Gary would be a precious lesson for Lucien in the future.After a moment Lucien finally calmed down. While hacking with his sword, he gradually stepped back and joined the guards.Now, instead of one or two, hundreds of rats started insanely attacking them.Lucien\u2019s sword was sharp and splendid. When he swung it, the sword was surrounded by a halo, and Lucien could see an almost solid afterimage of it through its path. According to Gary\u2019s command, Lucien\u2019s wielded the sword of light to shield them.Any rat that ran into him was cut down in half by his blade. The smoldering cuts burned rats\u2019 organs and skin charred without dropping a single drop of blood. Some of the strikes missed, but even then the fur and skin charred and they became slower, crashing into the floor right before Lucien.The three guards were responsible for the remaining ones.\u201cHaha, great job kid!\u201d Corella whistled.Lucien did not feel satisfied, though. He could feel the power of the sword was gradually decreasing.Gary was still hacking the remaining ones, \u201cCalm down. We have enough power to deal with these monsters.\u201dA new wave of attack came again, like a black swarm.Lucien was improving rapidly. Although still worried, he decided to trust himself and the three guards.The hacked bodies of dead rats fell to the ground like rain drops. But some red-eyed rats still managed to pass through the defense and moved towards them quickly.They cannot handle all of them. Lucien was thinking worriedly. Nobody could wield a sword that fast.Of course, they were fighting not only with their swords. Two small silver shields were cooperating with the swords. The crazy jumping rats could not stop in time and knocked directly into the metal. Many were twitching on the floor and died soon.Corella laughed, \u201cYou can\u2019t be a good knight without a shield!\u201dAfter several rounds of attack, the red-eyed rats changed their pattern. Instead of throwing themselves directly towards their faces, some started approaching through the floor, while others climbed on the wall to attack them from above.The situation again turned serious.\u201cLeave those coming from above to me.\u201d The tall Howson, who was silent all the time, said to them.Lucien nodded with appreciation, wielding his light sword to defend from the rats on the ground. \u201cShield of Light?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201d Gary shook his head.They were like a small boat floating in a roaring ocean. They could be easily destroyed.Suddenly, Howson missed one rat, which fell directly on Corella\u2019s shoulder. The rat gave him a bitter bite in his neck. Corella groaned with pain and twitched his shoulder.\u201cI got bit! It\u2019s numb there. Their teeth must be poisonous.\u201d He swore bitterly.\u201cLet me do the healing.\u201d Lucien was about to rub the badge but was stopped by Gary.\u201cCorella can still hang in there. There are too many rats. Save it after\u2026 Ouch!\u201dBefore he finished, Gary got bit under his kneecap.Soon the guards started focusing on their unprotected parts. But unlike them who were wearing kneecaps, boots and chain mails, Lucien was merely wearing linen short clothes. Suddenly he got bit in his ankle.Feeling pain and numbness from his ankle. Lucien almost lost his balance. He felt thirsty at the same time. He wanted water.\u201cProtect yourself. Raise your Shield of Light first. Then use Healing.\u201d Gary commanded. Half of the rats were dead already.Lucien quickly became focused and rubbed the badge.\u201cSimen.\u201dA white shield of light appeared and covered him. He would need more time to cast another spell, so he took a step forward, trying to cover his companions under the shield and the sword wall.After a couple of seconds, Lucien concentrated again. He rubbed the badge.\u201cGourdi.\u201dA white light radiated from the cross and covered his ankle. The numb feeling disappeared instantly.Although Corella and Gary were still injured, the situation had been turned around. The number of red-eyed rats decreased, so Lucien seized the chance and healed the wounded as well.Stabbing through the last rat, Corella sighed slightly, \u201cFinally over.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe ground was covered with layers of dead bodies and dark blood.Standing there, Lucien could not believe he actually made it. Gary nodded to him, \u201cYou did well, Lucien.\u201d Then he turned around, \u201cYou guys did a good job, too.\u201dCorella\u2019s face looked weird. Then he answered in a confused and fearful voice, \u201cHow\u2026Howson\u2019s not here\u2026\u201dThe silent but reliable Howson, who was protecting them from behind, disappeared?!Lucien started feeling creepy again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The robust and silent Howson, a high-level knight squire, just\u2026 disappeared?A chilly feeling rose from Lucien\u2019s feet and quickly spread all over his body. He held the hilt of his sword tight, and his breathing became heavier.He quickly turned his head but saw nothing. The sewer wall on the other side was covered with weird shining green moss.Suddenly, a bitter scream broke the deadly silence. Lucien quickly turned and saw a terrifying scene: a monstrous rat as big as a man had tripped Corella and sunk its sharp nails into his shoulder. Blood gushed all over Corella\u2019s silver chain mail, dying it red. The monster had scarlet evil eyes that withered.However, Corella\u2019s blade stopped its row of long and sharp teeth from causing damage.As a knight squire, Corella saved his own life with the most common movement in their training: he thrust the shield on his left hand with all his strength into the rat\u2019s stomach.Nothing was scarier than the unknown so, at least for Lucien, a huge rat showing itself was much better than an adult man disappearing all of a sudden for no reason.Lucien took a deep breath and swung his sword of light at the huge rat, to help Corella.At that moment, a bestial roar came from behind Lucien.\u201cGary?\u201d When Lucien was about to turn, a knight saber hacked at his back.The white light of the shield trembled and dimmed a bit. The huge impact pushed Lucien several steps forward, and he almost lost his balance.However, the attack didn\u2019t stop there. The saber was chasing Lucien and continuously tried to hurt him. Lucien did his best to dodge it, while having no time to fight back or use his badge. He felt confused and surprised. \u201cWhy? Gary?!\u201dLucien could not see clearly in the darkness. If it was not Gary, then there was only one possibility: Gary was already dead!With good timing, the saber gave Lucien no chance to find his balance, and soon he was pushed into the corner. Lucien was surprised that with the protection of the shield he did not get injured from the attacks at all. He took a deep breath and tried to calm down, getting ready for the next attack.Then, he dodged the saber\u2019s assault by throwing himself on the ground. At the same time, his left hand grabbed the badge.This time, Lucien finally saw who was attacking him. It was the group\u2019s leader, Gary.Nevertheless, the muscles on his face were contorted, and his eyes were shining with scarlet light. He looked like an insane beast.The poison from the rats! The poison could deprive human\u2019s consciousness and turn them into bloodthirsty beast! Lucien tried to understand, But why haven\u2019t I been affected?Without further thinking, Lucien rubbed the badge and started chanting. A round iron shield launched a hard whack on Lucien\u2019s shield of light. Although the shield did not break, the violent impact suffocated Lucien for a second, interrupting his casting.The continuous whacking prevented Lucien from concentrating. As a promising knight squire, Gary received formal training to interrupt spellcasting.A layman like Lucien, with no basic training, would be unable to resist the disturbances from a knight squire. Any trainee pastor or sorcerer apprentice, with a level-one Saint Truth Badge and a Shield of Light could have killed Gary.In the same level, a spellcaster was always superior.While Lucien was being trapped with Gary, Corella could not hold the rat back much longer. His right hand was trembling from the effort of holding the enemy\u2019s mouth away.Fortunately, the huge humanoid rat also became weaker.Unable to cast the spell, Lucien changed his mind and swung his sword of light upwards. He knew that his summoned sword was much stronger than the guard\u2019s saber.Although the swing did not strike true, the radiance from the sword terrified Gary. He stopped attacking Lucien\u2019s shield and switched to a defensive position hurriedly.It seemed like he didn\u2019t want to be further apart from Lucien: for a traditional knight, letting his enemy successfully cast a spell would be very dangerous.Without any sound of impact, the sword cut Gary\u2019s saber as if it was piece of wood. Gary barely managed to raise his shield in time and block with it, but the sword left a deep crack right in the middle of the shield.When Lucien was about to launch his next attack the sword of light suddenly turned into thousands of shining pieces, indicating the spell used up all its power. Actually, its power started decreasing at the very beginning, when it destroyed the magic wall concealing the chamber.Lucien was unable to react for a moment, and Gary seized the chance, smashing Lucien\u2019s protection with his shield.Now, Lucien\u2019s sword and shield were both gone.Having no time to hesitate, Lucien rubbed the badge desperately to cast his last spell.\u201cS\u2026 Ow!\u201dBefore Lucien could spell out the rest of the chant, Gary punched his stomach. Like a cooked shrimp, Lucien cowered in great pain. A wave of strong acid, rising from his stomach, burned his throat.Gary reached out his hand and squeezed Lucien\u2019s neck, choking him.Lucien struggled fiercely, and used his right hand to try to free his neck. He felt great pain in his neck and lungs, and his eyes were turning black. The badge in his left hand was being held firmly to his chest by Gary\u2019s other hand.Lucien could hear his own gasp. He could feel the cold metal glove Gary was wearing. It felt like Lucien\u2019s soul had left his body, and was observing from the side.Suddenly, Lucien\u2019s will to survive erupted. His soul power increased dramatically all of a sudden and broke through a certain limit, spreading like water from an ocean.At the same time, Gary\u2019s strength started disappearing. Lucien got a precious chance to breathe. Learning from his past mistakes, this time Lucien did not waste any time being hesitant or confused. He tried to focus and grabbed the badge again.As soon as he touched it, Lucien\u2019s spirit suddenly entered into an illusionary world of light, where many lines, circles and triangles formed a weird-looking cross in the air.Lucien recognized the cross instantly: It was the cross on Benjamin\u2019s badge! And he could feel that Benjamin\u2019s power was continuously coming out of the cross!Out of curiosity, Lucien moved closer and tried to touch it. The cross suddenly trembled and started accumulating power. Soon he felt its power became overwhelming!Feeling the danger, Lucien hurriedly tried to retrieve his spirit back to the real world but it was too late: A white beam of light shot out from the cross and burned his spirit on the side. A strong nauseous feeling hit him. Lucien felt like his head was splitting. And two streams of cool, rusty-metal-smelling liquid came down from his nose.Suddenly, the light beam somehow materialized and burst out from the badge that Lucien was wearing. Gary did not have a slight of chance to withdraw his hand. Starting from the hand squeezing Lucien\u2019s neck, the light beam quickly dissolved his arm and part of his shoulder in seconds like some kind of super-strong corroding acid. There was no blood coming out, and the wounds instantly turned black.Divine power can be activated without any spell? This surprised Lucien. He quickly dodged to avoid the enemy\u2019s following attack.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, he felt all his muscles aching and it was hard to move.Then, what Lucien saw shocked him greatly: Gary was lying on the ground, dying, with his eyes half open, and the scarlet light on them was gone.The pool of blood left by the dead rats had evaporated, forming a red mist and pervading the chamber and nearby pipes.The weird, human-shaped plant in the corner was stretching its branches cozily in the blood mist.On the other side lied Corella and Howson, with their own sabres stabbing each other\u2019s back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So, he concentrated and spread his spirit again like waves. Then, everything became stable. No changes or contortion happened.Lucien saw Corella and Howson lying on the ground, with wounds all over their bodies, dying.\u201cThis is a well-designed magic trap\u2026 Did the illusion originate from the blood of the rats, or the peculiar plant?\u201d Lucien thought to himself. He finally understood that from the very beginning, when they killed the first rat, they were already trapped in the illusion. Lucien was protected by the light shield, and his spiritual power was a little bit stronger than common people, so he was unaffected by the illusion.The Holy Strike that shot out of the badge not only evaporated Gary\u2019s right hand and shoulder, but also the stone ceiling of the chamber. There was a wide hole there, from which chunks of stone were falling like rain, as if the chamber would cave in at any time.Dust and small stones dispersed the red mist. Lucien felt his strength gradually recovering.Having no idea what would happen next, his brain started quickly functioning again: Except for two more Light spells, Lucien got nothing useful left. And his muscles were still weak from the paralyzing red mist.Then his attention was drawn to the plant in the corner, which was shaking and wobbling due to the falling stones.\u201cThe plant cannot protect itself aside from creating an illusion?\u201d Lucien wondered. He tried his best to stand up again and then dragged his body towards the plant. He moved very slowly and faltered several times. Sharp stones kept falling on him, leaving painful wounds all over his body.Lucien took a deep breath and kept moving. After so much experience, he became calm and decisive. Reaching out his right hand, he firmly grabbed the main stem of the plant.The plant had a pulse like that of a living being! Lucien felt like he was grabbing veins of a creature, beating with blood. He pulled the stem with all his strength.Suddenly, the plant shrank and burst out an extremely bitter and sharp scream.Lucien did not succeed on his first try. So, he kept twisting it with all his strength. Like a dying man struggling for survival, the plant screamed, stretched out its branches and entangled them around Lucien\u2019s arm.The plant was moist, slimy, and cold, and its tentacles had countless tiny burrs which kept burying themselves into Lucien\u2019s skin. Fighting back his fear, Lucien pulled hard again.\u201cCrack!\u201dThe plant suddenly stopped screaming. Red liquid spurted out of it and spattered all over Lucien\u2019s chest, leaving a strong bloody smell in the air. Feeling limp, Lucien hurriedly leaned against the wall to maintain his balance.After the plant was snapped in half, the red mist became much denser and almost turned into liquid. As soon as the blood mist from the plant reached the three books on the desk, they instantly started corroding. It only took a couple of seconds to completely corrode all the books. Lucien didn\u2019t get any time to read anything.\u201cIt must be another magic trap\u201d, Lucien thought. In case the chamber got discovered, these sorcerer\u2019s notes would destroy themselves automatically when the mist reached a certain density.\u201cArgh!\u201d It was such a pity for Lucien. He was hoping to find some mighty magic spells in the notes.Just then, he noticed something shining in his spirit library.Out of curiosity, Lucien let his spirit enter the library. Then, his eyes opened wide with great surprise: A new bookshelf appeared! And there was a small tag which read \u201cMagic (Arcana)\u201d. Under the tag there were three books. They were the same ones which got destroyed.\u201cThe library can collect books as well?!\u2026 Wait, what about the content, then? I didn\u2019t have a chance to read them at all.\u201d Lucien was trying to understand how the library worked. \u201cAs the corrosion happened really fast, the whole books were still destroyed page after page. Probably the library can copy the content\u2026 then the projections of the books can be stored here\u2026\u201dLucien was just guessing. He needed more proof.Staring at the three labels, a strong hesitant feeling rose in Lucien\u2019s mind: Wouldn\u2019t it be too dangerous to learn magic in a world where divine power dominated everything and sorcerers were hated by the public?Lucien knew he could not waste too much time down here. What was more surprising was that after the mist completely disappeared, both Corella and Howson twitched a little bit. They were still alive! Lucien knew that he really had to hurry up and get all of them out of this terrible place.\u2026\u2026Benjamin suddenly groaned when he felt Lucien activated Holy Strike. At that moment, their spirits were somehow connected. He was more than surprised.\u201cLord Benjamin?\u201d Pawl asked with concern.Under the silver moon, Benjamin\u2019s face did not look well. He said in a low voice: \u201cSomething unexpected happened down there. Damn it! She was just an apprentice. These guys are useless\u2026 Paul, you wait here. If I don\u2019t come back in five minutes, ask the bishop for help.\u201dBecause there was a spirit imprint on the badge, Benjamin could feel it. Or he would not have lent the badge to a young guy he had just met. He did not expect that his own imprint could be activated by someone else.Misfortune always comes with arrogance and prejudice.For Benjamin, knights were just a bunch of vulgar and ignorant guys, who knew nothing more than how to fight with just their physical strength. So, without giving any thought to whether the guards were actually more suitable, Benjamin directly gave the badge to Lucien, a young boy whose spirit was stronger than common people.Benjamin\u2019s perspective came from his past experiences.The family he came from, the Rafati family, was one of the most powerful families in the Duchy of Orvarit. Rafati family was known for producing gifted divines. While knights had to learn spells, offsprings of Rafati family were born with Blessing in their blood.Benjamin was no way close to being the most talented child in his family. But after entering the monastery, he stood out among his peers and soon became a formal pastor and a divine caster.But now, as a formal pastor, he was having trouble dealing with a trap left behind by a sorcerer\u2019s apprentice. It would definitely affect his reputation and position in the church. So he had no choice but to rush over there and solve the trouble himself.Paul was surprised as well, \u201cThey had the badge\u2026 Is there a real sorcerer present there?\u201d\u2026\u2026Sounds of footsteps came when Lucien was about to drag himself out the chamber to ask for help. He became anxious, for fear that if it was another witch or wizard who came then he would not be able to safely escape with his life again.Above all he felt worried, because a chamber was one of the best places to execute somebody and thus keep their mouths shut.\u201cLapland Bloodvine?\u201d Benjamin took a glimpse at the corner and quickly speculated what happened. He looked at Lucien and the three guards, \u201cFortunately, they\u2019re still alive.\u201dBenjamin was a little bit surprised when he saw Lucien. Benjamin thought, \u201cIt seems like when he activated my imprint, his spirit power also increased. He has reached the basic-level of a trainee pastor, quite lucky.\u201dHowever, everything has changed. The church, now, is not in its absolute dominant status like three hundred years ago. Today, divinity power can\u2019t be acquired with talent alone. Being a real pastor requires systematic learning from a young age.\u2018The Emperor of Magical Arcana\u2019, it was he who started the close to four-hundred-year golden age of the development of divinity power and magic. He changed the rule of how to become a Divine Caster.As a member of Rafati family, compared with most pastors, Benjamin knew more about the circumstances of the world. What\u2019s more, he was not that devoted to his own particular faith. More accurately, being an aristocrat actually conflicted with his identity of belonging to the church.Even further, after \u201cthe Highest Theology Conference\u201d more than three hundred years ago, the church was partitioned into two: one south, the other north. They both criticized each other for being a hearsay. But neither of them were ever interrupted or prevented from continuously gaining the divine power, which made many bishops and cardinals doubt whether God really existed, or if all this was a test for God\u2019s followers.This kind of attitude directly affected the following younger generations, like Benjamin, for hundreds of years.Besides, to fit into this fast developing era, several popes had introduced part of the knowledge gained through the exploration of the world by great Arcanists, to modify the foundation of theology.The adjustment guaranteed the fast development of divinity and the emergence of countless great spellcasters. Therefore, the South Church could still preserve its predominant position in general and keep growing while being surrounded by many powerful enemies like heretics, evil sorcerers, dark creatures and so on. But at the same time, this behavior additionally prompted more conflicts within the South Church itself.Benjamin\u2019s thought came back to reality. He released some white powder from his hand and chanted some weird spell. A strong wind blew the red mist away.He pointed his finger towards Gary. A white light fell down on his wound. The wound started healing and soon regained its original color.After curing Corella, Howson, and Lucien one by one, he confirmed with them what happened. Benjamin checked the desk to ensure nothing was left there. \u201cMove all the stuff back to the church, including the bodies of the rats.\u201dHe put the badge, which had already been returned by Lucien, back on his neck , and said, \u201cGod has forgiven you. Go back and rest. May God bless you.\u201dInitially, Benjamin wanted to reward Lucien with some money or even wait to see whether the kid had the potential to be further trained if things went well. But after all of this, the only thing Benjamin wanted was Lucien to leave as soon as possible. He got another problem to face: Gary\u2019s right hand. He did not master the spell for limb regeneration.Having the chance to leave, Lucien hurriedly walked towards the exit. By the moment he left the chamber, he heard Corella talking to Howson in a low voice, \u201cGary lost his right hand. He probably can\u2019t stay in the guards anymore\u2026\u201dHe walked outside the pipes with complicated, mixed feelings. The crowd mobbed him instantly with great concerns.\u201cLittle Evans, is the ghost gone now?\u201d Aunty Alisa asked loudly from far-off.Lucien nodded, \u201cYes. The place has been purified by the pastor and the guards.\u201dThe mood lightened immediately after they got Lucien\u2019s certain answer. They started being more curious about what happened down there.\u201cLucien, what did the ghost look like? Terrifying?\u201d\u201cI knew Lord Benjamin could handle it!\u201d\u201cLucien is blessed by God! He got the chance to use the badge!\u201d\u201cWhat a pity! Lucien is not a child anymore, or he would be able to go to the monastery and become a real pastor. Think about it! A pastor from Aderon!\u201dLucien was bothered by the comments, \u201cI\u2019m too old to be a pastor already?\u201dAlthough Lucien himself never thought about being a pastor because of his identity, it was still quite depressing knowing he was completely hopeless after seeing such an amazing power.\u201cMy poor little Evans. Look at your face. You must be very exhausted.\u201d Aunty Alisa asked.Lucien really needed some time for himself. He nodded and walked directly towards his small shanty. He closed the door and sat down on the bed. He could hear the crowd gradually dispersing after Benjamin and the guards left.Lucien missed his parents and friends but could not do anything about it. He started thinking about his own future again.\u201cThe real Lucien did not get any training before. So I could neither become a pastor nor a knight.\u201cIf I want to get rid of this life and become someone, then I need to learn magic.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026But then I would be an enemy of the church and all the people, including Aunty Alisa.\u201cDo I have other choices?\u201dFinally, Lucien decided to first look at the notes in his mental library.A little while later, Lucien talked to himself in a low voice, awkwardly.\u201cI can\u2019t read\u2026?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And Evans, as a poor child, was uneducated and illiterate.As a hopeless illiterate, Lucien could only helplessly stare at the notes and yearn for the amazing power. Although he had experienced a lot here, he still felt extremely depressed with the gap: He was a university student in another world, but now he was just a poor guy who couldn\u2019t even read.Lucien made up his mind: He must learn how to read.Even if Lucien could not be a pastor, learning how to read and write was not a bad thing in order to get rid of poverty. He had no physical strength. If there was a way out for Lucien, it would be something related to knowledge.Feeling motivated by his decision, Lucien again picked up the notes, hoping to uncover any other hidden secret.There were many strange but familiar patterns in the notes, like lines and geometric figures. Lucien guessed they were probably magic seals or circles because he saw them in the badge before. Then, he saw some formulas which might be used to make magic potions.The characters in the second note were even more complicated. Actually, the two notes were of different characters. Fortunately, the third one looked more interesting and contained the same character as the second one. It was filled with assorted hand-produced figures like plants, minerals, and creatures.After a new round of searching, he still couldn\u2019t find anything useful. Lucien stopped thinking and tried to fall asleep.He strongly desired to change his life. So, he could not let his messy concerns and worries disturb himself. From tomorrow onwards, he must fight for his own life.Lucien fell asleep quickly after the intense fight.Meanwhile, in the dark sewers, a black rat with scarlet and cold eyes was moving around the ruins and quickly went in another direction. After a while, the rat found a hidden hole and disappeared.\u2026\u2026In the early morning, sounds of people speaking with bucket clapping broke the silence. The street was already livened up.Lucien, who used to hate getting out of bed in the morning, forced himself to get up as soon as he woke up. He lighted the stove and boiled some hot water. While nibbling his last loaf of brown bread which felt like chewing a piece of wood, Lucien started planning his day.This world was still unfamiliar to Lucien, thus his plan was difficult to accomplish. He first decided to find a job to feed himself before learning how to read.\u201cI gotta be careful. Cannot let anyone notice.\u201d Lucien talked to himself.Before he left, Lucien grabbed his seven coins to feel a little bit more secure. He locked the door and went directly to auntie Alisa\u2019s place, who was the only one he knew there.\u201cMorning, Lucien.\u201d A girl with black hair greeted him on the streets, filled with curiosity.Lucien did not know her. Hurriedly, he made a smile and replied, \u201cHey. I\u2019m gonna visit aunty Alisa, sorry but I\u2019m running late.\u201d And the he quickly passed her by.\u201cHi Lucien, did you really face the ghost?\u201d\u201cHow did you feel when you cast the spell?\u201d\u201cI heard a guard lost his right arm. It was very dangerous last night, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dIt seemed that Lucien had become famous in the district overnight. Within three minutes\u2019 walking, a few neighbors came and asked about his adventure.Lucien knew none of them. He could only smile and head towards his destination.Before Lucien knocked the door, he heard a familiar voice. \u201cLittle Evans! Good morning!\u201d Joel was walking towards him.\u201cGood morning, uncle Joel!\u201d It was such a relief for Lucien.Dressing neatly, Joel was holding a classic harp. \u201cDid you have breakfast? Don\u2019t be in a rush to find a work until you\u2019re fully recovered. You can always eat here. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dLucien appreciated his kindness so much. He started feeling he was not alone here. \u201cThank you, uncle Joel, but, I had my breakfast already. And\u2026 I got blessed by pastor Benjamin last night. So, now I\u2019m completely fine.\u201dJoel nodded and walked with Lucien side by side. \u201cLater you could go and find Cohn at Copper Coronet. He still owes me a bottle of Lesse wine. He will introduce a good job for you.\u201dThen he turned his face towards Lucien and said in a serious voice. \u201cEvans, you\u2019re already seventeen. It\u2019s time you started thinking about your future.\u201d\u201cUncle Joel?\u201d Lucien knew he was saying the truth.Joel sighed slightly. \u201cNo one can make a living with only doing labor all the time. You know it. I\u2019ve seen a few old labor guys with no saving and no children to rely on in their last days. All of them died in their fifties or even forties.\u201dHe paused a little bit and continued. \u201cI know learning will take a long time. But if you\u2019re willing to work hard, you can always support yourself with a skill.\u201dDuring their conversation, they walked through a gate where two guards were standing on both sides. Lucien\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up: Broad and clean streets, busy stores, and pedestrians wearing colorful and fancy clothes. Music was wafting in the soft wind. It was a different world compared with the poor Aderon district.Lucien thanked Joel sincerely.Joel started joking again. \u201cBesides, sometimes a master only has a single daughter. Who knows, maybe, you can be promoted directly from an apprentice to the future owner. You know, a nice-looking promising young fellow is always in demand.\u201dLucien replied with an awkward smile.Joel finally stopped around a corner. He placed a hat on the ground and got ready to play his harp.Lucien was a little bit surprised to find that uncle Joel was a street artist.Joel pointed to the luxurious and magnificent palace in the distance and smiled. \u201cThat is the Hall of Chant. For me, I feel like I\u2019m playing music in the hall.\u201dBefore Lucien said anything, Joel continued murmuring as if something inside of his heart was triggered. \u201cFour hundred years ago, guided by the Holy Heilz Empire, the church marched towards the west. Finally, they occupied the last central city of the old Sylvanas Magic Empire, Aalto. The army drove the dark creatures and demons away into the Dark Mountain Range. Since then, Aalto has always been one of the most famous cities across the whole continent.\u201cThree hundred years ago, under the guidance of the Pope Charles I, who was still a cardinal at that time, lots of famous scholars and artists studied and edited together the hymns and poems of past ages. After he became the pope, he promoted the singing style in every church and started regular choirs. Since then, Aalto has been enjoying the reputation of \u2018City of Psalms\u2019.\u201cBecause we are close to the Dark Mountain Range, elves, dwarves and dog-headed men, or say, cynocephalus, often came in contact with us and some even became members of our duchy. Different kinds of music were mixed in Aalto and the polyphonic music was born here. Then followed formal symphony, gesu violin, etc.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCountless artists and musicians inscribed their names on the pages of history. Playing inside the Hall of Chant is a great honor for every musician and bard.\u201cAlthough I cannot get in there, it\u2019s also a pleasure for me to play my harp here.\u201d\u2026\u2026After parting from Joel, Lucien took Joel\u2019s suggestion and started heading towards Copper Coronet. While asking the way, he was enjoying the wonderful music in the wind. As soon as he returned back to Aderon, he saw a busy pub with a coronet board hanging there.Outside of the pub, from time to time, young girls and women could come and glance into it and then leave with disappointment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The morning was obviously not busy hours for a pub.A slender blonde girl was peeking inside from the pub door. Then, she sighed and was about to leave, but was surprised to notice Lucien standing there, waiting for her to get out of the way.\u201cOh! Lucien!\u201d She exclaimed.Lucien was already used to the situation. He smiled and greeted, \u201cMorning! What\u2019re you doing here?\u201dThe girl\u2019s tanned cheeks suddenly flushed, \u201cI\u2026 I am just on my way. I heard there\u2019s a new bard here today in the pub\u2026so\u2026Anyway, I gotta go, Lucien.\u201dBefore Lucien said his goodbye, the young girl rushed away with her cheeks red. Lucien guessed the bard she mentioned should be very attractive.However, it had nothing to do with Lucien. He was here to work. He gently pushed the door and stepped inside the pub.Lucien\u2019s first impression towards the pub was not very good: a dusky space, with a strong alcohol smell and messy tables and chairs. It took his eye a while to get accustomed to the dark environment.Several drunkards were woken by the noise. They emitted a few curses and went back to sleep on the tables. There was an hooked-nosed man in a tight black coat, probably in his thirties, sitting on a bar stool and was sipping his amber-coloured wine. Without saying anything he glimpsed at Lucien.Lucien looked around. Soon, he found a dwarf snoring loudly behind the counter. He was sitting on a high bar chair with his round head leaning against the wall. His shining saliva was dropping on his blonde beard which was tied into a bow.Knowing the dwarf would not wake up by himself, Lucien knocked on the counter loudly with his fingers.The drunkards started swearing in the background. The old dwarf slowly woke up with sleepy eyes, \u201cOh, my Lucien! Finally, you\u2019re a grown-up now! Finally, you understand the wonderfulness of wine! Cheers! For our new customer\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s already morning, uncle\u2026 Cohn.\u201d Lucien was hesitant about how to call the pub owner.Cohn rubbed his eyes and looked around, \u201cI\u2019m not drunk\u2026 Don\u2019t lie to me. What a wonderful night!\u201dAfter quite a while, Cohn finally sobered up. When Lucien asked about the jobs, Cohn made a slightly pained look and said, \u201cUm\u2026 I don\u2019t have really good ones now. All I got are some odd jobs. 9 o\u2019clock tomorrow morning\u2026 Let me see. Three Fells for carrying stuff from the grocery to the gate zone. But you know, you have to give one Fell to the gangsters there at the end of the day. Then\u2026 all you can get from the work is two Fells, only enough for buying an old brown bread.\u201cAnother thing\u2026 yes, here. The Musician Association\u2019s gonna do a cleaning today. You can rent a cart and help them with the garbage. You can get eight Fells after the rent. But also\u2026 three Fells to the bastards.\u201d\u201cThere is something else too\u2026 No, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re qualified for that.\u201dLucien nodded, he only had seven Fells with himself. He did not really have many choices. Working for the association was the best one.\u201cCohn, do you have jobs with better payment?\u201d Lucien asked again with curiosity.Cohn laughed loudly, \u201cYes, for sure, my boy. But those are for real men, as they require strength and courage, not for a young boy. You don\u2019t even know how to drink.\u201dThen, he lowered his voice. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many people setting off towards the Dark Mountain Range from my bar. They were mercenaries and experienced adventurers. But, very, very few of them came back alive.\u201d Cohn belched and continued, \u201cOf course they all made a big fortune, though.\u201cDon\u2019t underestimate them. Many of them were High-Level Knights.\u201d A gentle but attractive voice came from behind Lucien. His tone was lifted slightly in the end, sounding elegant and seductive.Lucien turned around and saw a silver-haired man walking towards them from one of the pub\u2019s rooms. He was wearing slim pants and a red jacket, covered with a black high-collared coat. Those formal clothes looked amazingly casual but elegant on him. He had quite refined features: silver eyes, tall and straight nose, thin lips\u2026The man almost looked like a charming elf with his silky silver hair, like a full moon at night.Holding a harp in his hand, the man picked a bar chair and sat down.\u201cHey, Rhine! Want a drink?\u201d Cohn grabbed a glass.\u201cThanks, but I only drink at night.\u201d He smiled. \u201cPeace has been prevailing on the continent for almost three hundred years. There are more knights than people need. The Duchy of Orvarit, the closest duchy to the Dark Mountain Range, is full of myths and mysterious treasures. Many new and honored knights come here to seek credits, honor, and fortune.\u201dHe fiddled with the harp and continued, \u201cBesides, some of them were broken knights, some of them were convicted, some of them were travelers, while some of them were dark knights who were not admitted by the church.\u201dCohn was a little bit unhappy with Rhine\u2019s rejection. He murmured, \u201cLucien, this is Rhine Carendia. As a bard, he travelled a lot. And he just got away from the passionate Tria ladies in the Kingdom of Syracuse.\u201d\u201cThe Kingdom of Syracuse?\u201d Lucien asked.Cohn burst out laughing. His long, blond beard swayed with his laughter. With an ambiguous smile on his wrinkled face, he replied. \u201cYes, The Syracuse. A passionate, romantic nation where love is the top priority.\u201dA drunkard joined them when they started talking about Syracuse. He loudly burped, and asked with eagerness, \u201cRhine, the la\u2026 ladies and madams\u2026 there, there in Tria, were they really that beautiful\u2026 and\u2026 hot?\u201dRhine smiled casually and answered with his unique tone, \u201cYes, they were. Their eyes were like morning stars, hair like silk, lips like roses, and their fair skin like milk. I can still remember the perfumes they wore and their wet, warm breaths. A few ladies and duchess even invited me to their secret manors\u2026\u201dThe drunkard cut in with excitement, \u201cDid you go then?\u201dLucien knew the most common topic within men was women. While he was listening, he was also thinking about his learning how to read.Rhine, with the same smile, answered, \u201cI told them I did not like dirty things that had been used by someone else. I love beautiful, clean, and pure lives, no matter men or women. They\u2019re the tastiest things in the world.\u201d\u201cBullshit, Rhine. There was no way you dared to speak to them like that.\u201d\u201cRight, if you had answered like this, you would be in the famous jail in Tria by now! Come on, Rhine!\u201d\u201cThose ladies, many of them could compete with the knights. Dare you!\u201dRhine shrugged his shoulders slightly facing Cohn and the drunkard\u2019s laughter, \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here now, not in Syracuse.\u201dPounding the counter, Cohn was laughing so hard that he almost got choked. Drunkards there were all wakened up by his pounding, looking angry but confused, \u201cSuch\u2026 such a good story from our beloved Rhine!\u201d Cohn\u2019s face turned red, \u201cCheers! For the wonderful story!\u201dAll the drunkards knew was ale. They pushed their ways to the counter to grab the free drink.\u201cCheers! For\u2026 Rhine, the blowhard!\u201d\u201cThe blowhard!\u201d They laughed and shouted.A while later, when the pub finally quieted down again, Cohn was very surprised to find that Lucien was still there.\u201cWhat else? My boy?\u201d Cohn asked.\u201cUm\u2026 yes. I\u2019ve got a new idea. I\u2026 I\u2019m thinking about\u2026learning how to read.\u201d\u201cAh? Read?\u201d Now Cohn was even more surprised, \u201cYou talked with Rhine? You two are dreamers.\u201dSeveral guys in the bar started heckling.\u201cWooo\u2026 What a magnificent, glorious dream for our brave little pauper!\u201dWhile some showed their support, \u201cLucien, good for you! Dreams make a real man!\u201dCohn laughed with them for a while and then turned to Lucien, \u201cTwo years, Lucien. It\u2019ll take you at least two years to learn how to read. You\u2019ll start from scratch. Do you have any idea how much money and effort it will cost you?\u201dLucien looked into his eye, nodded firmly, \u201cI understand. So many people tell me I\u2019m too old for this or that. But Cohn, as people said, better late than never. If I don\u2019t make up my mind, there will never be a start.\u201dAs a university student in his original world, Lucien was confident that, with the all the knowledge he mastered before, he would be able to understand the language rules and start reading very soon.Twirling his big beard, Cohn nodded, \u201cI see\u2026 You\u2019re too old to enter the church school\u2026 that\u2019s for sure. Then\u2026 There are two ways: either you become an apprentice for ten years, or you pay for a teacher. But, the first way\u2026 you know, it depends on whose apprentice you want to be. I don\u2019t see the necessity for a blacksmith to learn reading. They won\u2019t pay you for that. If you can afford a teacher\u2026 it will be five Nars a month. Five silver coins! And the price is same in the whole city.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLucien did not want to become an apprentice. Ten years was too long, but he also had to make sure no one would possibly find out that he was trying to learn magic. Being an apprentice meant he had to live in his master\u2019s place. That would not be good.\u201cFive Nars. It\u2019s probably gonna take you half year to save five Nars if you work from day to night and eat the cheapest brown bread.\u201d\u201cAnd how much can you learn within a month?\u201d Cohn added, \u201cAre you still going?\u201dLucien answered firmly, \u201cYes, I am.\u201dA hundred Fells equaled to one Nar. It was a tough start. But still possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sadly, none would be helpful for him. Seven Fells were insufficient to start anything.While the morning sun was shining on the market, Lucien was already carrying a heavy bag of goods towards the gate. No matter what great dreams a person got, survival always ranked first.Beads of sweat poured down from his face. His linen clothes were all wet. What\u2019s worse, the fat guy called Gutche kept nagging from the side:\u201cDamn\u2026 A child? Watch out! Don\u2019t ruin my stuff!\u201d He wiped his forehead with a handkerchief.\u201cOr you can just pay more to find someone else\u2026\u201d Lucien fought back in his mind. At the same time, he was also glad that he could earn one more Fell by doing all the work by himself.Finally, they reached the gate. Lucien laid the goods safely on the cart.Gutche reluctantly pulled out his purse and gave four Fells to Lucien. He then paused and said, \u201cYoung lad, you did a good job. Um\u2026 The work will be yours next time as well.\u201dLucien did all the work alone for a much lower price. No wonder, Gutche now forgot all his complaints.As soon as Lucien got his pay, two hooligan-looking guys approached them.\u201cWe work for Aaron. I\u2019m Andre.\u201d The brown-haired man identified himself. He had a scar on his face.Lucien was already prepared for this. He handed him a Fell.The other guy just stared at Lucien and said, \u201cTwo!\u201dLucien blurted out, \u201cBut it should be one! Everyone gives one!\u201d He knew that he was in no position to argue, but he just could not stand being robbed like this.\u201cUm\u2026 Usually, Gutche hires two people, so we charge one Fell for each person. We charge you double cos you did all the work alone. I don\u2019t see any problem here.\u201d Andre smiled like he was a decent businessman.A second later, Lucien lowered his head and passed the strong guy another Fell. Lucien did not want to offend these gangsters.\u201cSmart boy. You know the rule. Some young lads\u2026 they love challenging us. But you see, we\u2019re still here, while\u2026 some of them are at the bottom of the Belem River. All right, Mag. Let\u2019s go.\u201d Andre threatened him like it was usual and left.Of course, Lucien hated this. He was already prepared for this but still, could not control himself. He understood that either high status or strength could help him get rid of all the suffering.\u201cI wish there were some magic potions in the notes that would help to improve my strength, then\u2026\u201d Lucien tried his best to stop thinking. He knew that it was a dangerous sign. A sign that he was getting tempted to learn magic.\u2026\u2026Almost everyone in the city knew the unique-designed building of the Musicians\u2019 Association. Very quickly Lucien found the place called \u201cSparkling Flame\u201d.Assembled with lines, small towers, flying buttresses, stained glasses, and flame-shaped window lattices, the whole five-floored building held a particular unsymmetrical and flamboyant beauty.A skinny middle-aged man with a mustache hurriedly came down from the stairs, \u201cYou\u2019re late! I told you one o\u2019clock!\u201dThis man was George. Cohn had already introduced him to Lucien. George worked for the association, and it seemed like he knew quite a few guys there.\u201cGeorge, there are still ten minutes before the appointed time.\u201d Lucien pointed to the golden bell tower in the wealthy neighborhood, whose minute hand still had some way to go from number twelve.Waving his hands, George complained to Lucien, \u201cThe cleaners finished their job earlier. You gotta remove the rubbish piling up in the back as soon as possible. I don\u2019t wanna piss the musicians off. Some of them still have a performance this afternoon.\u201dLucien left his rented trolley to the guards and walked into the bright and grand hall.Covered with soft and thick carpet, the floor made no noise at all. There were just a few people walking across the cold, quiet hall.Following George, Lucien came to a waist-high counter in the center of the hall, behind which sat a green-eyed and pretty young girl.\u201cUncle George! Is he your helper?\u201d She greeted.While she was talking, she took out a tinkling purse and handed it to George. According to Lucien\u2019s estimation, approximately forty Fells were in there. However, after paying the trolley rent, he could only get eight Fells.Holding the purse in his palms, George grinned showing his yellow teeth and his eyes narrowed into two slits, \u201cHe is a good worker although a bit young.\u201dThen, he turned to Lucien, \u201cI\u2019ll leave your pay with Andre. Just find him after you finish.\u201dLucien nodded. He was not worried that George would keep the money himself. Even though the Aaron Gang was overbearing, they too had to follow the rules. Cohn mentioned before that someone tried to keep some money, and later he had to compensate twice the amount.When Elena was about to find a servant to show Lucien the way to the back yard, a middle-aged man wearing a red, loose coat came in. She hurriedly stood up and bowed slightly.\u201cGood Afternoon, Mr. Victor.\u201d\u201cGood Afternoon, Elena.\u201d The man replied politely. He had blue eyes as deep as an ocean, \u201cMay I have the latest Music Criticism?\u201d His voice was deep and rich.Lucien was surprised. He did not expect to find a newspaper in this world, and even specialized ones. What impressed him more was the polarization here, thinking about the fact that many people in Aderon were still illiterate. Lucien guessed not many people would buy newspapers.He also wondered how much the newspaper cost.Victor roughly went through the pages and gave Elena ten Fells. He then went towards the stairs after nodding politely to both of them, with the newspaper under his arm.After he left, Lucien asked Elena curiously.\u201cThe newspaper costs 10 Fells?\u201dHaving worked in the association for a whole year, Elena was proud that she could share her knowledge with someone, who was also from the same poor background like she was before.\u201cIn the year 426 of Saint Calendar, the Cardinal Adelaide enhanced the method for papermaking. Since then, the paper price continued declining. Now you can buy a dozen newspapers with just a couple of Fells. But only members of our association can buy Music Criticism with 10 Fells. Others, including nobles, have to pay a silver Nar.\u201d\u201cBoth Music Criticism and Symphony News are the most authoritative music publications across the continent.\u201d she then continued, \u201cEvery piece of music and article is produced by brilliant musicians and scholars. This month\u2019s Music Criticism published the comments from His Majesty and Princess Natasha on the concert held last week in the Psalm Hall.\u201dAside from showing off, Lucien\u2019s good looking face was another reason why she kept offering so much information.\u201cA Nar?!\u201d For a moment, an exciting plan of robbing newspapers appeared in his mind. Five Nars could easily solve Lucien\u2019s problem! A second later he realized the thought was too ridiculous: No one would buy from him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSure!\u201d Happy with Lucien\u2019s interaction, Elena kept talking. \u201cYou think it\u2019s too expensive? In places like Tria, Antiffler, Ifai, Tilis and Anhadur, these newspapers are very popular. People there honor Aalto\u2019s music very much and would even pay one gold Thale for an old one.\u201dLucien took a glance at the newspapers under the counter while trying hard to resist his impulse. But, he also got some information from her words: Under the mighty church, currency across the continent should be unified; Secondly, there was no such spell for teleportation. If there was, it must have very strict rules, or the nobles in other cities would not read old newspapers.More than ten minutes later, it finally occurred to Elena that Lucien still had work to do. She reluctantly stopped herself and asked a servant to lead him to the backyard garden.\u201cBe quiet. Don\u2019t talk loud. Don\u2019t move loud. In three months, Mr. Victor\u2019s gonna hold his first concert in the Psalm Hall. Recently, he\u2019s being pretty\u2026 um\u2026 sensitive,\u201d Elena kindly reminded him.Lucien nodded to her gratefully and followed the servant towards the garden.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It took Lucien a couple of rounds to throw it away.To keep the city clean, there were people collecting trash every morning. But, the fancy association just could not tolerate the trash piling up in their garden for a whole day.After finishing the work, Lucien sneaked into the hall and moved around the margins of the round hall towards the gate.\u201cDamn it! Wolf! Can you just leave me alone for one second and let me focus on my music?\u201d He heard a deep and rich voice which turned sharp in the end. At the same time, a man wearing a red coat rushed down from the stairs.Then, he ran right into Lucien.\u201cBang!\u201d Something heavy fell down on the carpet, making a dull sound.Victor nearly lost his footing.Taking a deep breath, Victor bent down and picked up a broken lamp which had fallen down from Lucien\u2019s pile of trash.\u201cSorry.\u201d He gave the lamp he picked up from the carpet back to Lucien.Another brown-haired man wearing dark blue long coat walked down from the stairs. There was an noticeable arch on his chin.\u201cVictor, you\u2019re not the only musician here. I can do whatever I want. If you have a problem with it, then go back home.\u201dThe smile on his face became even bigger, \u201cI know, I know. There are only three months left before your concert. And I understand, I\u2019m so looking forward to it. I\u2019ll write an article for you on Music Criticism, especially for you\u2026\u201d\u201cBastard! Let\u2019s see when you can have your own concert.\u201d Swearing in a low voice, Victor turned around and left the hall quickly.The moment Victor turned his back, the smile disappeared from Wolf\u2019s face. He walked back while murmuring, \u201cIt should be mine\u2026 \u201dAfter seeing their argument, Lucien continued carrying the trash to the gate. Then, he saw the broken lamp decorated with fancy patterns and the bottom of the lamp was made of metal.Dumping the trash into the cart, Lucien picked up the lamp. It felt like copper but more flexible. It would probably sell for several Fells at a smith\u2019s shop. For a poor guy like Lucien, everything he saw would be related to money.\u201cWait\u2026 maybe I can find more useful items like paper or quills in this pile.\u201dNow, this pile of trash was a treasure for Lucien. His heart was full of surprise and excitement. Although the rich people would not even bother looking at it, for Lucien this was his first chance of changing his life.Five silver Nars was sufficient for one month\u2019s educational cost. Besides, He got an entire library inside his mind which could be constantly expanded. If he was able to learn how to read, he trusted that he would discover better ways for making a fortune.Lucien felt energized just thinking about his future. Feeling excited, he pulled his cart out of the city. But, he was also worried: No one liked old things from trash.\u201cI just gotta be careful. If Aaron\u2019s gang caught wind of this, they\u2019re gonna demand more from me.\u201d After Lucien\u2019s fight in the sewers, his fear for this world and towards gangsters diminished. He knew more about how to fight than they did.After leaving the hall, Lucien saw a silver-haired man walking leisurely towards the association.\u201cRhine? What\u2019s he doing here?\u201dLucien did not think much about it. It was not strange for a bard visiting such a reputable place.Andre was at the gate. He recognized Lucien and saw his fully loaded cart. He just waved his hand and let him leave out of the city.Although excited, Lucien did not easily lower his guard. After a twenty-minute walk from the gate, Lucien finally stopped at a quiet place along the Belem River.Rummaging through the trash, Lucien got some useful stuff: A broken lamp, several rusty pieces of metal, eight worn out quills, and some bundles of paper, etc.Finally, Lucien pulled out a nice smelling damaged black lace. It looked like a veil, which might once belong to a female musician.Without any erotic imagination, all Lucien thought was just about money.\u201cIt got a fine craft. Maybe\u2026 maybe I can sell it to a tailor, who can probably use this as a decoration.\u201dWrapping that stuff with some paper, Lucien hid them in the grass. Then, he continued pulling his cart downstream to the place where the trash was piled up.He was surprised that the dump site was much smaller than he thought. The river beside it was very clean. No one was there except for Lucien. While smelling the awful stench emitted from trash, Lucien started his rummaging again.\u201cIn this world, nobody picks up trash for a living?\u201d Lucien wondered, \u201cMaybe they\u2019re afraid of catching any disease.\u201dHowever, Lucien\u2019s empty purse was clearly more of a threat to him than getting sick, which might or might not happen. Wrapping his hand with waste papers, he found something which was probably worth a few Fells.It was his first time, so Lucien was extremely cautious. He hid some of the stuff and went back for his paper parcel. Hiding his findings under a dirty old bag in his cart, Lucien tried to flatten the bag as much as he could to make it look like the cart\u2019s cover.Lucien stuffed the small things into his pocket.It was much easier than he thought. The guards just waved their hands and let him in after shooting a glance at him.When Lucien was pulling his cart towards Andre and Mag, he realized why the guards just let him pass easily. Covering their noses, Andre and Mag\u2019s eyebrows were twisted together when they saw him.Lucien was happy to see this. He pulled his smelling cart even closer to them and asked. \u201cI\u2019m Lucien. I come for my pay.\u201dMag immediately stepped back and took out the money while swearing.\u201cDamn you! Fuck off with your stinking cart.\u201dAndre, with his consistent smile, was standing even further, \u201cYour first time going to the river, isn\u2019t it? If you stay there until dark, you may get lucky. Just watch the ghosts there\u2026 haha\u2026 \u201dWithout asking about ghosts, Lucien quickly left with his pay to return the cart. He did not want any more trouble.Lucien made five Fells in total for cleaning up the garbage. However, his findings were more important than them, with them he could easily earn five Nars.After returning home, Lucien hurriedly hid the rest of the stuff and then rushed to the market.Lucien took it directly to a tailor without even cleaning the veil. He was rushing with quite a bit of excitement.However, when Lucien was standing in front of a tailor shop, he became hesitant. He would probably get scolded or turned out of the door before he could open his mouth. Lucien\u2019s face was flushed, like when he tried to do sales at the university.\u201cDon\u2019t be a coward, Lucien. Don\u2019t feel it\u2019s shameful.\u201d Lucien started encouraging himself, \u201cWhat can your dignity do for you now? Can your dignity turn your dark bread into white one? Or can it offer you steak, codfish, and wine? Can dignity teach you reading?\u201dLucien had experienced quite a bit after coming to this world. He had even wobbled on the borderline of death. He quickly made up his mind and walked into the shop with firm footsteps.An old man wearing glasses was sitting in the shop. Noticing Lucien entering, he asked with confusion.\u201cYes?\u201dLucien\u2019s dressing obviously showed that he was too poor to even visit an expensive tailor.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSmiling with great enthusiasm, Lucien rubbed his hands.\u201cHello, sir! I got a nice black lace\u2026 and I was wondering if you\u2019re interested in it\u2026\u201dBefore Lucien could finish his words, he was cut in by the old man fiercely.\u201cA fine black lace, from you? Get lost, you damned thief!\u201d He walked out of the counter and pushed Lucien out, \u201cI, Old Forau, am a decent tailor! I only buy clothes from the Lautsi!\u201dBeing driven out of the first shop, Lucien had no choice but to find the next one. And he would try a different approach this time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We don\u2019t need anything from you.\u201dIt was the third time that Lucien got rejected. These fancy tailors always hated poor guys like Lucien. Even when Lucien showed the lace, they were still not willing to waste a second on him.It was a big market. More than ten streets that crossed with each other. There were lots of different shops ran by humans, dwarves, and elves.Soon, Lucien found another neat little tailor\u2019s shop, at the end of a street.Standing behind the counter was a fifteen or sixteen-year-old shy looking blond boy.\u201cHi, I\u2019m Buster. Anything I can help you with?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Yes, could you take a look at this lace, please?\u201d Lucien placed the veil on the counter.Buster gently rubbed it with his fingers under the light and got surprised.\u201cSir, it\u2019s the Black Nightingale from the Kingdom of Holm! Where did you get it?\u201dLike other tailors, Buster knew Lucien could not afford this lace. Sometimes, even rich people might not be able to buy a small piece of Black Nightingale. All noble ladies wanted it.Lucien lowered his voice, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s clean.\u201d\u201cClean?\u201d A thirty something year old man walked out from behind. The thin-faced man was McDowell, the owner of this shop.Lucien was surprised that they did not immediately drive him away, which was a promising signal.\u201cYes, yes! I swear in the name of God! You see\u2026 there\u2019s a hole in it. It was abandoned by a noble lady and I just happened to find it. Turn it into a decoration on a dress or a band. I think with your hands, you can definitely make it become eye-catching again, sir.\u201d Lucien added eagerly.Taking the lace from Buster\u2019s hands, McDowell had a close look. After a moment\u2019s thinking, he asked calmly.\u201cHow much do you want, then?\u201dLucien clenched his fists in excitement but did not dare show it in his face.\u201cCome on, Lucien\u2026 you fought with the huge crazy rats before. Stay calm.\u201d Lucien secretly consoled himself.\u201cYou offer, sir. I believe your price wouldn\u2019t let me down.\u201d Lucien smiled and answered.Looking into Lucien\u2019s eyes, McDowell paused a little bit.\u201cForty Fells. It\u2019s not much use to me with a hole in it.\u201d\u201cA Nar. A fancy dress with a Black Nightingale on it, even distinguished ladies and madams will fight for it.\u201d Lucien more than doubled the offer.McDowell shook his head and handed the lace back to Lucien.\u201cFifty Fells. I cannot go any more than this.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, but thank you anyway, sir.\u201d Lucien calmly turned around and was ready to leave. Actually, he was very nervous. He was worrying that he might lose his only chance for being greedy.Step by step, Lucien dragged his feet towards the exit. When he was about to leave the shop, McDowell\u2019s voice suddenly came from behind.\u201cEighty Fells. My last offer. I\u2019m only paying this much because the lace is a perfect match for one of my dresses.\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Lucien waved his fist joyfully and then he turned around and smiled.\u201cDeal, sir.\u201dTinkling coins bulged Lucien\u2019s pocket. For Lucien, nothing was more lovely than getting rich.\u201cI don\u2019t know you. And I don\u2019t care either. But, if in the future you got some good stuff like this, you could bring it here, as long as it\u2019s clean.\u201d McDowell added.\u201cSure, sir. Thank you.\u201d Lucien slightly bowed and smiled.After stepping out of the shop, Lucien found the sunshine was very brilliant under the amazingly blue sky. Breathing the fresher-than-ever air, Lucien found this world was kind of lovely as well.Eighty Fells was pretty decent for him. For Lucien, he found his idea of collecting money actually worked. This was even more important to him!\u2026\u2026Iven was waiting for Lucien near his home. He waved his hand as soon as he saw Lucien coming, \u201cLucien! There you are! My mom sent me to invite you for dinner. My brother\u2019s home!\u201d\u201cJohn? Iven\u2019s elder brother?\u201d Lucien tried to recall, \u201cJohn\u2019s a\u2026 yes, knight squire in training.\u201dIt was not really safe for him to carry so much money everywhere with him.\u201cJust a moment, Iven. I gotta wipe my sweat a bit.\u201d Lucien smiled.\u201cSure, Lucien.\u201d Iven looked more excited than usual, \u201cYou know what? John brought a piece of beef from Lord Venn! We\u2019re gonna have beef stew tonight!\u201dHis little dirty face was full of excitement and expectancy.\u201cI haven\u2019t had any meat stew for quite a while!\u201dActually, little Iven\u2019s family was not as poor as most people living in Aderon. As a busker, Joel\u2019s income could vary sometimes, but it was still better than labors. Alisa worked as a laundry maid as well. But, they were always saving for John\u2019s training back in the days. Old Evans, Lucien\u2019s father, helped them quite a lot before.After hiding the money safely, Lucien quickly washed his face and followed Iven towards aunt Alisa\u2019s place.A bunch of neighbors were gathered in front of the cabin.\u201cLittle John\u2019s now the sworn knight squire following Lord Venn, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cYes, Alisa told me herself.\u201d\u201cLittle John\u2019s not even nineteen yet. One day he might get lucky and awaken the endowed blessing in his blood\u2026 then, he\u2019s gonna be a real knight!\u201d\u201cThen no more Little John. We shall say, Lord John!\u201d\u201cJohn can also be the commander of the City Guard as a sworn knight squire now.\u201d\u201cJoel and Alisa are so lucky\u2026 they must be very proud of their son!\u201dIven was nodding with great pride.As they entered the living room, a blond young man stood up from the chair. Inheriting his father\u2019s look, John was a handsome young lad, tall and straight. His elegant gesture was quite impressive to Lucien.\u201cI was quite worried hearing what happened to you, Lucien.\u201d John patted Lucien\u2019s shoulder and smiled, \u201cGlad to see, you\u2019re alright now. I guess it was a test for you from God.\u201dAlthough he was just one or two years older than Lucien, John appeared much more mature. His gray knight attire also made him quite out of the ordinary.\u201cThanks, John. It was not a big deal, really. Aunty Alisa always worries about me.\u201d Lucien nodded.When they sat down around the dinner table, John laid his hand on Lucien\u2019s shoulder.\u201cWhy do I feel strangeness between us? Come on, we are best friends.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 I guess you changed quite a bit since you left home.\u201d Lucien was a little bit nervous.John nodded seriously.\u201cYeah\u2026 I\u2019d say so. Training there changed me a lot, both physically and mentally. It was very hard, but I gained a lot from it as well.\u201dDinner was not a feast. They only got beef stew and roasted fish on the table. But for Lucien, this dinner was beyond delicious. He devoured his serve and even bit his tongue a few times. The happy reunion was so sweet that Joel even got a rare chance to enjoy his beef with ale.Alisa talked even more during the dinner. Most of the time, she was the only one who kept talking all the way. A couple of words from Joel, Lucien, or Iven were enough to keep her going. According to the rules of a knight, John did not talk very much.\u201cI\u2019m stuffed\u2026 \u201d The happy dinner ended with little Iven\u2019s loud burp.John smiled and shook his head, \u201cIven, eating too much is bad for you.\u201dThen, he turned to Lucien.\u201cHave you got any future plan?\u201d He asked.Carefully arranging his words, Lucien nodded.\u201cYeah\u2026 It was still unclear, but, I don\u2019t want to live a life like what I\u2019m doing now.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d John looked into his eyes, \u201cLord Venn told us, \u2018being unsatisfied with your life pushes you to move forward\u2019. The bakery and the cellar in Lord Venn\u2019s manor are now looking for apprentices. It\u2019s a pretty good chance but you gotta work there for ten years. If you\u2019re interested in this job, just tell me by next Monday.\u201dPeople in this world also believed in the myth that God created everything in seven days. They also attended church every single Sunday.Being a knight squire was very promising: Now, John was able to help his family and friends. Although the help could not change their lives completely, it was still of great importance.\u201cThank you, John.\u201d Honestly, Lucien was still reluctant to constrain himself in the following ten years, especially when he had just made his first small fortune. But, he still wanted to think for some time before making a decision.\u201cAlright, I gotta go back now.\u201d John stood up from his chair and hugged his family. And he gave Lucien a big hug.\u201cI wish you could read, Lucien. Downey is looking for a clerk for the court. It\u2019s a very decent job with nice payment.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m planning to start studying.\u201d Lucien seized the chance and told John.John was quite surprised. Soon, he smiled and nodded, \u201cI\u2019ll see if there\u2019s any chance for you.\u201dLucien thanked John again, sincerely, but he also did not place all his hope on John. He had to work on his own.\u2026\u2026For the following three days, Lucien did not find anything valuable like the Black Nightingale. But, he still managed to save a Nar and sixty-four Fells. Now, he was walking towards the city gate as usual, with great confidence.Looking at Lucien\u2019s back, Andre nudged Mag a bit.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhy does he leave the city every morning?\u201d\u201cLeave the city?\u201d An amiable voice came from behind them.Andre hurriedly turned around, looking serious.\u201cMorning, Jackson.\u201dJackson Riodors, one of the leaders of the Aaron gang, had a kind face.

What\u2019s going on here?\u201d\u201cNot a big deal, Jackson.\u201d Andre responded in a flattering way, \u201cA guy is recently going outside of the city every day. I was just wondering\u2026\u201d\u201cInteresting. Does he carry anything with him?\u201d Somehow Jackson\u2019s smile was kind of frightening, which for a moment gave both Andre and Mag goose bumps.Mag believed in both the God of Truth and his own fists, and claimed that he carried one sixteenth of the savage blood from Yaran Highland. However, his brain did not work as fast as his fists. Jackson\u2019s question was too demanding for him.\u201cUm\u2026 I remember he always carries an old sack. Sometimes, he comes back with something in it. There are many mushrooms near the Belem River\u2026 \u201d\u201cNo, not mushrooms.\u201d Jackson cut in.\u201cThen\u2026 what else could a poor guy like him do\u2026 \u201d Andre asked nervously. Facing the Belem River and the Melzer Black Forest, the gate that Andre and Mag were watching was the busiest one among the three gates of Aalto. Countless merchants, adventurers, and plain folks came back and forth every day. They never bothered paying extra attention to a poor boy like Lucien.Jackson came for a reason.\u201cThe blacksmith Rego came to me two days ago. A young lad sold him a nice piece of Orichalcum.\u201d\u201cOricha\u2026?\u201d\u201cOrichalcum, or say, Mountain Copper. Only wealthy nobles can afford it. Although the one he got was of the lowest quality, it was still quite enough to forge a fine dagger. Rego wanted to find more, so he came to me.\u201d\u201cLucien sold that?\u201d Mag asked directly.Jackson slightly nodded, \u201cHe was careful. The metal was polished so Rego couldn\u2019t find any clues. It took me a whole day to find him. But, he visited a couple of smith\u2019s. They remembered him.\u201cAnd you know him as well. Perfect.\u201d Jackson added.\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d Andre asked eagerly.\u201cFollow him and find where he found the Mountain Copper. If he notices you, beat the shit out of him and then ask. His money is all yours.\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201d Mag answered before Andre. It had been more than two weeks since he gave someone a good beating. He always got excited when it came to beating someone.\u2026\u2026Carrying his old sack, Lucien was walking in the direction of the Belem River.\u201cI gotta use the other two gates more.\u201d Lucien thought, \u201cIt\u2019s suspicious always taking the same way\u2026 Andre and Mag, they\u2019re always there.\u201dThe two gates, one in Purple Lily and the other in Nolan, were both far from his destination. Lucien sometimes would collect some mushrooms on his way back to disguise his real purpose, which took him more time.A figure flashed from behind him.\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d Lucien suddenly became alert.It was not the first time he found someone tracking him. Ever since his bitter fight under the sewers, he felt he became more sensitive to the surroundings now. Thanks to his sharp observation, he managed to get rid of those people who wanted to find out his secret.Pretending everything was fine, Lucien was seeking for a chance. When he arrived in a corner covered with thick grass and high trees, he dashed to a big tree with all his strength. Hiding behind it, Lucien quietly waited for the person.He was calm. He had to know who was following him to eliminate any future trouble.A moment later, a sound of heavy footsteps, together with swearing, came from the place Lucien was previously at. The sound came around the corner, very close to where Lucien was standing before.\u201cDamn it! We lost him!\u201d\u201cI was right, Andre. We should catch and beat him up. Only that way he will tell us everything!\u201dLucien was surprised. He did not expect that the Aaron gang would notice him so quickly.Feeling disappointed, Lucien decided to leave his home and hide somewhere with his money for a few days. He was waiting for Andre and Mag to leave first.\u201cI can still become an apprentice anyway.\u201d Lucien comforted himself silently.Andre and Mag knew what Jackson would do to them if they messed up. They were arguing with each other loudly.\u201cMag, savages can scent!\u201d Andre suddenly smacked Mag\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHey! Scent what\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said those savages are like hounds, and they can catch any scent in the wind!\u201d Andre was excited, \u201cYou have savage blood! Try it!\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Sometimes it doesn\u2019t work, though\u2026\u201d Mag scratched his bald head.Lucien suddenly became really nervous. He still knew too little about this new world.Raising his head slightly, Mag took a long deep breath.Then he shouted excitedly, \u201cI got his scent!\u201d\u201cThere he is!\u201d He started running towards the tree.Mag found him!As soon as Mag shouted, Lucien started running. Mag was surprisingly fast with his big muscles and, several times, he almost caught Lucien.Lucien kept running through the trees to avoid Mag. But after the woods, there was the open riverside. Lucien knew he could not escape anymore.\u201cI gotta beat Mag before the other guy comes.\u201d Lucien did not panic. Compared with those crazy red-eyed rats, Mag, although a bit big, was still a human being.Lucien was prepared. He heard Mag\u2019s excited howling coming close from behind him.Suddenly Lucien stopped, he lowered his body and pushed his leg against the ground. He butted Mag hard with all his strength.It was an unexpected attack. Mag swiftly tried to punch Lucien\u2019s head to avoid the attack, but he missed.Lucien passed right through Mag\u2019s arms. With the help of Mag\u2019s own momentum, Lucien\u2019s hard-clenched fist ran into Mag\u2019s soft belly.Mag felt a hard rock hit his stomach. As he was yelling in pain, a strong acid rose from his throat.Lucien knew a single punch could not solve the trouble completely. Thus, two seconds later he viciously attacked Mag\u2019s back with his elbow. Furthermore, almost at the same time, his lifted knee went straight between Mag\u2019s legs.\u201cOw!!!!!\u201dIt was a painful howling in the best savage style, and even Andre, who always made fun of Mag\u2019s blood, would not deny that.Covering his private part, Mag was rolling back and forth on the ground in great pain, snarling angrily.Seeing all that, Andre couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for his companion, kind of feeling some of that pain as well, so he ended up slowing down.Without a second\u2019s delay, Lucien turned around and ran away immediately. He saw a shining dagger in Andre\u2019s hand.Andre chased for a little bit, but it was too late. Soon, Lucien disappeared in the woods across the river. He finally stopped beside Mag.\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe weaker you are, the poorer you are. Those bastards just wouldn\u2019t let you have any chance!\u201d Lucien felt aggrieved.It was nine in the morning. Sneaking back through the gate in the district of Nolan, Lucien was carefully approaching his shack in Aalto. He needed to take his money before the gangsters found his place.After hiding behind a nearby cabin for a while, when Lucien was about to get out, a bunch of ferocious guys approached towards his shack.A common-looking man dressing neatly pointed to Lucien\u2019s place. Then another burly young guy directly gave a hard kick on the broken door.The door fell on the ground, leaving behind a cloud of dust.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When Jackson mentioned Mag, they somehow felt a chilly wind pass through their legs. Andre squeezed out an embarrassing giggling. But, he was still glad that he did not have to lie in bed for at least a week.\u201cAndre, you go. See if there\u2019s anything in this pigsty.\u201dSeveral minutes later, Andre came out with a handful of small things.\u201cJust some rubbish, Jackson.\u201dSigh\u2026 Lucien regretted not hiding this stuff elsewhere. It was very easy to tell where he found them. If the Aaron gang took control of the dump site, then it would be the end of his dream to become a rich man.\u201cRubbish\u2026 \u201d Jackson curled his lips, \u201cA pretty smart young lad. He found the Orichalcum in the dump site. Trash from the palace, nobles areas, Musicians\u2019 Association, Mercenaries Union\u2026 all go to the dump site beside the river. They\u2019re useless for rich people, but not for us\u2026 \u201dHis guess was right.\u201cThanks to the boy, we found a new way to make money!\u201d Fiddling with a piece of metal, Jackson commanded with his iconic smile, \u201cSmash all of his stuff. Keep the money to yourselves. The one who finds the guy will be rewarded!\u201dJackson did not bother sending his men searching for Lucien. They also got many things to do. Time was too precious to be wasted on a nobody like Lucien.Cheering loudly, they squeezed in Lucien\u2019s little shack started smashing his stuff.Clenching his fists and gnashing his teeth, Lucien could tell from the sound that his table, followed by his clay pot, were shattered to pieces. But he knew that he could do nothing against the gangsters with his current power. They would beat him to death and he did not want to die like that.Law would not help him, since people above it would not care.\u201cIf the witch had not gone to the cemetery, no one would have found her.\u201d Lucien\u2019s mind started wondering as the noise in the background faded, \u201cIf I become a sorcerer, I can protect myself\u2026 I don\u2019t want much. After learning magic, I just need to find a place to live.\u201d\u201cI need to\u2026 yes, I have no choice. Learning magic is dangerous, but being weak is no better.\u201dHis locked up thoughts all started resurfacing, like being summoned by the evil actions around him.Alisa\u2019s shout cut off his wondering.\u201cYou damned bastards! What the hell are you doing!\u201dWhile doing her housework, Alisa heard the mess coming from Lucien\u2019s place.Trying to stop them, she yelled and approached the gangsters while waving her long spoon.\u201cGet her away.\u201d said Jackson.Two ferocious men rolled up their sleeves and walked towards Alisa. But, they underestimated the housewife standing in front of them. Aunty Alisa directly hit one of them on the forehead with her wooden spoon.\u201cOuch!\u201d Facing the unexpected attack, the guy screamed in pain.But soon more guys joined in. Although Alisa was tall and sturdy, she was after all still a woman. A hard punch hit her shoulder and her spoon fell onto the ground. Alisa groaned in pain, but still did not flinch.\u201cYou wretches! Stop! The inspectors are coming!\u201dHiding behind a wall and watching all of this, Lucien\u2019s mind was filled with torment and suffering.\u201cLucien, are you a man?!\u201dAlthough he met Aunty Alisa many days ago, he did not have a very strong bond with her and her husband Joel. But now, when he saw Alisa get hurt because of him, he knew it was totally unacceptable for him to be hiding behind a woman and letting her fight for him.\u201cFuck!\u201d Clenching his fist, Lucien took a quick glimpse at his shack and jumped out.His target was Jackson, who was standing there alone.Lucien threw himself at Jackson with all his might. Feeling extremely surprised, Jackson was suddenly knocked down by Lucien. They wrestled on the ground, and Lucien tried to hold Jackson\u2019s hands tightly with his left hand, in case the thug was carrying a dagger. Meanwhile, his right hand was trying to reach Jackson\u2019s throat. Lucien needed to capture their leader to control the whole situation.However, Jackson was not inexperienced at all. He also had his share of fighting. Rolling on the ground, Jackson did not give Lucien any chance to grab his neck. At the same time, he continuously slammed his elbow at Lucien\u2019s rib.Due to the lack of space, Jackson\u2019s hits were not very strong. But still, for Lucien they were still unbearable. Wincing in pain, he still did not retrieve. He was almost there. He touched Jackson\u2019s throat.Suddenly, Lucien got a hard punch in his stomach. He was smashed hard on the ground by Jackson\u2019s men.Before he could stand up, fists and kicks started falling down on Lucien\u2019s body like rain drops. Lucien started rolling on the ground from unbearable pain, like a stray dog. He could barely cover his vital parts.Lucien\u2019s mind started wandering again. Everything seemed unreal and was fading away like in a movie. Aunty Alisa\u2019s crying voice came from another world, \u201cStop! Stop\u2026\u201dAt that moment, Lucien made up his mind.Whatever it took, he must become strong.Jackson was standing on the other side, looking at Lucien rolling back and forth on the ground. He trampled him hard and stopped his men.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHis friend is a knight squire. Let\u2019s not bring ourselves trouble.\u201dAlthough it was rumored that Rosan Aaron had some connections with a high noble, a gang still had to be relatively \u201cdisciplined\u201d, or it would be eliminated by the church or nobles in no time.Lucien was lying on the ground with blood coming out of his nose and mouth. Jackson smiled to him, \u201cActually I respect your courage and intelligence. I really do. But, my boy, don\u2019t be too greedy. I hope you understand what\u2019s yours and what\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lucien answered simply in a hoarse voice.Lucien\u2019s answer was a little bit weird for him, but Jackson did not bother too much. Jackson and his men left in triumph, together with Lucien\u2019s collections and forty-five Fells.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lucien was lying in the sun, covered with wounds and blood. Staring at the clear blue sky, breathing the fresh air gently, Lucien forgot the pain. His mind was waving like a deep ocean.Lucien realized that everything he had experienced before led him to his final decision: learning magic. Although he knew he had to be even more careful and cautious in the future, at the same time, he felt more relaxed than ever before, after making up his mind.There was even a smile on Lucien\u2019s bruised face. He felt he had genuinely grown up within the past couple of days, much faster than in his own world. The anger, the feeling of inferiority and the sense of insecurity had blended together and pushed him to that decision. And he was also gifted with the library.So why not? Lucien asked himself, feeling relieved from his long-time repression.\u201cMy poor Evans! Oh my poor Evans! Are you alright?\u201d Alisa tried to hold Lucien\u2019s hand.The slight movement of his arms and legs made Lucien wince in pain.\u201cI\u2019m okay, Aunty Alisa. They didn\u2019t want to kill me, fortunately.\u201dAunty Alisa held Lucien\u2019s arm and led him back to her place. She kept swearing with great anger, \u201cThese bastards would be hanged and tortured in hell by endless flames!\u201dAfter cleaning the wounds, Alisa was about to ask Lucien what happened today. Before that, it seemed like she suddenly thought of something, and her hands acted a bit awkward.\u201cLucien\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Aunty Alisa?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026 this is the thing. John\u2019s coming back today. Can you keep this to yourself without letting him know? You know John\u2026 You\u2019re his best friend. If he hears about it\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to constrain himself from taking revenge. As a knight squire, he would be in big trouble then\u2026\u201dKnowing John was Aunty Alisa and Uncle Joel\u2019s great hope, Lucien nodded.\u201cOf\u2026 of course. It\u2019s not a big deal, actually.\u201d Lucien put a hard smile.Alisa held Lucien\u2019s hand, with tears in her eyes.\u201cThank you, my little Evans.\u201d\u201cAre you trying to hide anything from me?\u201dIt was John\u2019s voice. Wearing the grey knight suit, John was standing by the door. Neither Alisa nor Lucien noticed him.Alisa answered hurriedly, \u201cNothing, nothing. You came back earlier?\u201dJohn walked in and pulled a chair for himself. He sat down beside Lucien.\u201cThe Grand Duke summoned Lord Venn, and I followed him back to Aalto. Mom, I\u2019m a knight squire now. I\u2019m not an imprudent young boy anymore.\u201dThen he turned to Lucien. \u201cYou look much worse than the last time we got thrashed together. What happened? Don\u2019t try to lie. I bet lots of neighbours were there and saw it.\u201d John added.Lucien looked at Alisa, who had already compromised the secret. Then he told John the story in full detail. During his talking, Lucien could feel the tension in the air due to John\u2019s feelings, which was the same that he felt from the guards he fought together in the sewers.Of course, John was very angry, but he managed to calm himself down quickly. He patted Lucien\u2019s hand gently and smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re really clever, the most clever among us. Find money in trash\u2026 really, good for you! I\u2019m sure you will do a good job if you learn to read.\u201dThen, shrugging his shoulders, John went outside of the room and fetched a long wooden club from the kitchen.\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d Alisa sighed.\u201cMom, you know I gotta do this, for my friend.\u201d\u201cBut John, Lord Venn won\u2019t be happy about this\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, John\u2026\u201d Lucien hurriedly asked, \u201cDon\u2019t go. It\u2019s not a big deal. Look at me. I\u2019m okay.\u201dJohn turned around and shook his head.\u201cLord Venn always told us, as a knight, one is supposed to protect the weak and fight against the violent. As a squire, I already regard myself as a knight and try to follow the knight\u2019s belief.\u201dHis eyes were intent. His gestures expansive.\u201cLucien, my friend, was bullied, and his place got ruined. If I remain silent simply to no piss Lord Venn off, my inner guiltiness will never leave me. Yes, maybe I will not be able to awaken the \u2018blessing\u2019 anymore because I broke the rules, but I\u2019ll be faithful to my beliefs. Lord Venn will be on my side, I believe.\u201d\u201cI know, John. I know\u2026 but\u2026\u201d Alisa got tears in her eyes.John hugged his mom and comforted her gently.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, mom, I\u2019m not gonna kill anyone. I will not overdo it. Look! I\u2019m holding a club, not a blade. Can you trust me, mom?\u201dFinally Alisa nodded with great effort. \u201cDo be careful, John.\u201d\u201cThey are the ones who have to be careful, mom.\u201d Grabbing the club, John smiled with confidence.When he was about to leave, Lucien called him from behind.\u201cWait, John.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d John looked back.With all his remaining strength, Lucien stood up from the bed. He felt his blood was flowing fast, burning his body.\u201cWe are going together.\u201dLucien\u2019s smile looked kind of funny with his swollen mouth. But John could tell his determination. He laughed, \u201cThere\u2019s another club in the kitchen. Let\u2019s go, like when we were kids.\u201dHolding the club, Lucien comforted aunty Alisa in a low voice when he passed by her.\u201cI\u2019ll watch him. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u2026\u2026It was easy for them to find out where Jackson and his men went by asking around. When they were on their way, John asked Lucien, all of a sudden:\u201cDo you believe in justice, Lucien?\u201d He sounded confused.\u201cYes, I do. Why do you ask?\u201dJohn lowered his head but did not stop.\u201cI do, too. But Lucien, I am not as noble and brave as I claim to be. I do this only because you\u2019re my friend. If it was someone else, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t think I would. I\u2019m used to picking my fights well, avoiding doing anything that would be beyond my capability. I\u2019m selfish\u2026 I only want to protect my family and friends. I\u2019m a coward, am I not?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Every knight, or say, every person, has a priority. Some pursue justice, some loyalty, some mercy\u2026 You chose family. Only when a person knows what he really wants to protect does he stick to justice. Or justice would be just like the clouds, nothing substantial.\u201dLucien just realized that John was still a young lad like himself, no matter how mature he appeared to be. Thanks to the book about the knight\u2019s spirit from his mental library, he was scrabbling up his sentences to comfort John. Now he was much better at looking up information among all the books in the library.\u201cYou really think so?\u201d John still looked puzzled.\u201cSure. If you\u2019re capable, will you protect the weak, fight against the wicked and uphold justice?\u201d\u201cIf I\u2019m capable, of course I will.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re still a knight of justice. If you were not capable, you would fight and die for nothing. You gotta be able to protect yourself first, only then you can protect those who need your help.\u201d Lucien felt he was quite suitable for being a mentor.John seemed relieved, and he started smiling, \u201cEvery time I asked Lord Venn about this, he told me I was too inexperienced to understand. But Lucien, you\u2019ve grown up, too. You\u2019re good at comforting and maybe you\u2019re right. But I\u2019m still longing for the genuine justice.\u201cOnce, Lord Venn told us a story about a legendary knight sword. The sword had divine power inside, but looked just like the common ones. Its hilt was made purely of wood, without any gems, pearls, or anything out of ordinary. The nobles and the high level knights wouldn\u2019t take a second look at the sword.\u201d John\u2019s eyes were on the far distance and he continued.\u201cBut actually the sword was far more powerful than they thought. Especially when it was used to fight against evil. What impressed me most was the words engraved on the sword: \u2018Justice is pale, compared with splendour and power. But everyone can be its representative: wealthy or poor, intelligent or illiterate, warrior or farmer. Justice is pale, but it is everywhere\u2019.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPale Justice, that\u2019s the name of the sword. It disappeared along with a Grand Arcana Knight in the the Dark Mountain Range.\u201dJohn became excited. His depression was gone.Lucien laughed, \u201cThen our slogan today is gonna be \u2018For Justice\u2019!\u201d\u201cFor Justice!\u201d John waved his club.A few minutes later they saw Jackson, who was walking on the broad street of the market. A bunch of guys were still following him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And you haven\u2019t received any formal training. Remember, Lucien, don\u2019t panic, and don\u2019t stop moving. We will keep changing positions. Don\u2019t let his men surround you. Use your club to keep them away, so their daggers won\u2019t harm you. You hear me, Lucien?\u201dJohn tried to advise Lucien as much as possible. He was worried that Lucien might lose control and launch an imprudent attack. However, Lucien had some decent experience before.\u201cNo worries, John. I\u2019ve survived an invasion into a witch\u2019s chamber before.\u201dHiding their clubs behind their backs, they approached Jackson in a quick pace.It was a pretty busy street in the market, only ten minutes away from one of Aaron gang\u2019s hideouts. Merchants, mercenaries and adventurers were gathering there, so no one paid attention to them.They looked at each other when they were just a few steps away from Jackson, nodded, and dashed towards the gangsters, holding the clubs tightly in their hands.Lucien recognized the guy who kicked him hard. Without a second thought, he wielded his club right towards the thug\u2019s head. If you\u2019re not trained or not strong enough, wield it hard with all your might. That\u2019s what Lucien learned.Before the guy could notice, he got bludgeoned bitterly in his lower jaw. Then he passed out and fell onto the ground directly.John, on the other side, quickly got rid of another guy. As a knight squire, John was really good at it. Although he did not aim at the head, his precise strike directly dislocated the guy\u2019s right arm.Two guys were down. But the harsh scream from one of them drew the others\u2019 attention. Jackson was surprised, but his eyes became vicious in an instant.His men pulled out their daggers. The sharp blades reflected the surrounding light.The pedestrians started scattering away quickly, leaving them more room to keep moving. Lucien and John kept running into different directions. They could not stop. The key to this strategy was not to spend too much time on a single enemy, in order to make sure they wouldn\u2019t be flanked.The strategy worked quite well: one more of the thugs was rolling on the ground. But it was also very hard to keep moving all the time.John was constraining himself. He did not want to be in trouble for hurting someone seriously. But his concern became his weakness: some guys on the ground were still in conditions to fight, and seized the chance to pull out their daggers and stab John\u2019s ankles. Busy dodging their low blades, John did not notice the others moved to surround him.Thanks to John\u2019s refined fighting skills, he barely avoided several strikes. But the circle of daggers was getting tighter and tighter.Lucien turned back to help John, his club whistling directly towards the back of a thug\u2019s head.\u201cJonny! Watch out!\u201d Warned by the other gang members, the man named Jonny dodged by bending forward quickly, and avoided Lucien\u2019s attack.However, that was enough for John, who seized the chance and broke the formation through the gap left by Jonny. However, the latter jumped up immediately and made the movement to throw his dagger at John\u2019s back.\u201cBang!\u201d Before the dagger flew away from his hand, Lucien pounded bitterly into Jonny\u2019s backbone. This time Lucien did not run away. Instead, he waited for a second chance to strike Jonny.Suddenly, a cold feeling came from Lucien\u2019s own back and immediately turned into agonizing pain. A dagger cut him badly, but Lucien did not panic. He knew John would not hold his hand anymore.And a determined and angry knight squire would be unstoppable when facing a bunch of gang bastards. Unlike Lucien, John never missed. Wielding his club with anger, he came to support Lucien.Watching the battle unfold, Jackson took a step back and started escaping.\u201cYou guys stop them!\u201d He shouted while running.The rest of his men started stabbing crazily. The shining blades came from different directions.Lucien got another cut on his right hand, and the blood came out immediately. His club almost flew out of his hand.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d John stood in front of Lucien, sheltering him from the enemies.\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d Lucien shook his head, \u201cWe gotta stop Jackson from bringing reinforcements.\u201dJohn nodded, \u201cRemember, use your club to keep the daggers away from you. Follow me!\u201d He struck down once more and started chasing Jackson.The rest of the guys slowed down and did not pursue any further, because they saw Jackson was already quite a distance away from them.However, after becoming the overseer, Jackson gained some weight from the lack of proper exercise. Thus, he ran slower and slower.\u201cKeep moving, keep moving\u2026 almost there.\u201d Jackson encouraged himself.Unfortunately, John, a squire in perfect shape, had another plan in mind. He was slowly gaining ground and, when the distance was proper, he swung his club with all his strength right into Jackson\u2019s back.Jackson felt like all his guts almost gushed out through his throat. With a loud groan, he fell on the ground, twitching in great pain. Then a knight boot stamped hard on his back. Lucien arrived a while later, panting heavily. He was more than tired after all the running and fighting, especially because of the bleeding wounds that covered his body. It was his anger that was keeping him up all the way here.Before Jackson could make any threat, John turned him over with his boot and pointed downwards, smiling and gasping.\u201cYou first, Lucien.\u201d\u201cThanks buddy.\u201d After taking several deep breaths, Lucien raised his club high and took a mighty swing at Jackson\u2019s face.\u201cHow dare\u2026 Ow!!\u201d Several teeth burst forth from Jackson\u2019s mouth, preventing the rest of his words from coming out. He was choking in his own blood. His ears were buzzing, his eyes were seeing stars.It was a f**king hard one. Those damned little bastards!\u201cWhat\u2026 what do you want?\u201d Jackson lisped with the mixture of blood and saliva in his mouth. With great dizziness, he noticed his voice was like coming from another world.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWe want nothing more than justice.\u201d Kicking away Jackson\u2019s dagger, John answered seriously, \u201cYou beat Lucien and my mom, which we\u2019ve paid you back. And you also robbed him and destroyed his place. You gotta compensate.\u201d\u201cJohn, if I remember correctly, you\u2019re a knight squire, aren\u2019t you? Fighting on the street\u2026 breaks your rules. Don\u2019t let Lord Venn down, young lad.\u201d Jackson spat out blood from his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019ve come to this extent\u2026 you don\u2019t care about your little brother and parents?\u201d He continued his threatening.\u201cI guess you still want more, don\u2019t you?\u201d Lucien was weighing his club.Facing violence, Jackson shut his mouth. His anger and shame mixed like a pot of boiling water, burning his guts to ashes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I don\u2019t see my fault here. Actually most people wouldn\u2019t stand for gangsters, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cYou need proof!\u201d Jackson yelled. A gang was often very good at keeping a witness silent.John looked a bit hesitant. What Alisa told him bothered him again.\u201cProof?\u201d Lucien smiled contemptuously, \u201cJohn\u2019s a knight squire, while you\u2019re a gangster. What else do you need?\u201dFrom what he learned in the Copper Coronet, Lucien was aware that in the Duchy of Orvarit, knights were the real nobles, and their recognized squires also held status. Lucien believed Jackson definitely wouldn\u2019t dare slander a knight squire. And he had no reason as well: A gangster was also a businessman. Jackson couldn\u2019t gain anything big from Lucien and John from doing so.Jackson, as Lucien expected, did not retort. Yes, they can put a knight squire into prison, but how much effort and resources they would have to use? Aaron, of course, would not do this for him, Jackson knew. Especially recently, something was going wrong in Aalto. The city was like a whirlpool where different powers were mingling. Aaron was often absent from the meetings, planning something.Knowing he was no longer in an advantageous position, Jackson tried his best to repress his anger and shame.\u201cHow much do you want, then\u2026\u201d He lowered his head and tried to make an agreement. \u201cI only got two Nars with me.\u201dLucien turned to John, \u201cThe sheriffs are coming. We\u2019d better leave before they arrive.\u201dJohn nodded. \u201cWell, two Nars.\u201dLucien was actually quite happy with the result. Knowing his table and chairs basically worth nothing, two Nars were more than two times what he had lost. By the way, he had already moved the rest of his money and hid it under the ruins of the witch\u2019s place. All the gangsters took away were just forty Fells and some useless rubbish.Pulling out a small bag, Jackson threw it to John. The bag was pretty empty except for two shining silver Nars. \u201cI left the rest to my men.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go, John.\u201d Lucien raised his chin towards the coming sheriffs and grabbed his club. He did not want to put John in trouble. Soon, they disappeared at the end of the street.\u2026\u201cAll right, all right\u2026 stop. We\u2019re safe now.\u201d Leaning against the wall, Lucien was panting heavily and felt as if his lungs were about to explode. He let his body fall on the ground, smiling.\u201cFinally, I can\u2019t run anymore.\u201dJohn sat down beside Lucien, also gasping for air. \u201cMe neither\u2026 It was pretty cool, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucien\u2019s mind started slowing down and feeling relaxed.\u201cThe fight. I can\u2019t remember the last time I had a good fight like this\u2026\u201dThey were just sitting on the ground, gasping, and looking at the blue sky.\u201cYeah\u2026 it was cool.\u201d Lucien smiled. It felt like a heavy rock had been lifted from his mind: All the pain, anger, and confusion Lucien hid at the bottom of his heart was gone like floating clouds. His mind was thinking clear, and he was more relaxed than ever before.Also, Lucien knew that he still had a real friend in this world who would shield him and fight for him, regardless of the cost. Lucien started laughing, aloud.\u201cWhat?\u201d John wondered.\u201cThe future. I\u2019m thinking\u2026 after I learn how to read, after I make some money, I\u2019ll go travelling across the continent, to see different sceneries, to know more foreign tales, to taste many cuisines\u2026\u201dLucien stopped and stared at the blue sky. But he continued thinking to himself:\u201cI will learn magic. I will understand how this world works. I will discover the truth of the world\u2026 and then, I will find the way back home.\u201d\u201cFor my parents, for the friends in my world and in this life\u2026 for myself.\u201dLucien had collected three Nars. He knew he had to start his learning as soon as possible. Who knew if the gangsters would take secret revenge on him secretly. The outside pressure from the bullies and his inner motivation mixed together and made learning magic the only way for Lucien to achieve his desires.\u201cTraveling?\u201d John laughed, \u201cIt\u2019s not safe, Lucien. Although most of the dark creatures in the east of our country have been eliminated by the church, they\u2019re still breeding like rats. Cynocephaluses, vicious goblins, gnolls\u2026 Sorry, Lucien\u2026 I don\u2019t think your dream will come true. At least you cannot go alone.\u201d\u201cUmm\u2026 I wonder, are they edible, the things you mentioned?\u201d Lucien asked subconsciously. For him, the most effective way for eliminating some overpopulated animals was turning them into food.\u201cEww!! What the hell are you thinking about?\u201d John was baffled.\u201cAll right\u2026\u201d Lucien answered with a bit of disappointment.\u201cIf I can turn into a real knight in the future, what will I do?\u201d John asked himself with a lot of expectation, \u201cI think I\u2019d be the same as you, Lucien. I also want to travel to see what the world looks like outside of Aalto. I wish it were really beautiful, like the bards described.\u201d\u201cBy the way, \u201d John said to him, \u201cbe careful in the next few days. Don\u2019t stray too far from the city walls, you never know what these bastards will do.\u201dLucien nodded, \u201cI know. And when you see Lord Venn, remember to tell him what you did right away, and ask for punishment yourself.\u201dJohn did not expect Lucien could be this considerate. He was also glad that his lifetime friend still cared a lot about him, even though sometimes he felt Lucien had changed quite a bit.\u201cI will. I wish I could teach you how to read, but I cannot read either.\u201d John sighed, \u201cOnly the high-level knight squires receive classes on how to read\u2026\u201d He looked a bit upset.\u201cJohn, you\u2019ve done a lot for me.\u201d Lucien laid his hand on John\u2019s shoulder, \u201cI\u2019m grateful for having a friend like you. I really am.\u201dJohn could see Lucien\u2019s sincere eyes. Soon he smiled.\u201cI know. Who doesn\u2019t want to have such a great friend like me? Let\u2019s go home. Mom\u2019s waiting for us.\u201d\u2026\u2026Joel was home when they came back. Alisa was walking back and forth in the living room. It was such a relief for Alisa seeing them come back, better yet, in one piece. Opening his arms, Joel grinned to them.\u201cWelcome back, heroes.\u201dAnd he gave both of them a big hug.\u201cYou guys remind me of my old days.\u201d Joel lowered his voice and winked when he turned his back to Alisa.\u201cDad, you and mom gotta be even more careful for some time.\u201d John was kind of worried.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Those bastards only give the weak a hard time. You once beat the shit out of them, you\u2019re no longer on their bullying list. Your mom and I will be fine.\u201d Joel left some space so Alisa could treat Lucien\u2019s wounds, and then he turned to John, dead serious.\u201cActually, John, you should have asked Lord Venn first. You\u2019re his squire, his representative. Your behaviour matters to his decency.\u201d\u201cYes, dad.\u201d John was aware of his rashness. \u201cLucien told me to take the initiative and ask for Lord Venn\u2019s forgiveness, and I will.\u201dJoel nodded, \u201cLucien\u2019s right.\u201dA while later, Lucien excused himself to find some usurer in Copper Coronet. He needed to start his studies as soon as possible, and thus he was prepared to face the risks in case he for some reason didn\u2019t manage to pay it back.Before Lucien left, Joel stopped him. When he turned around, he saw Joel was holding an old plain purse.\u201cThere are eight Nars in it.\u201d Joel put it into Lucien\u2019s hand, \u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cJoel\u2026\u201d Lucien was surprised. He never thought borrowing money from them because Evan was still young. \u201cAuntie Alisa\u2026?\u201dShe was smiling to him. \u201cThat\u2019s all we have for now. Not too much, but enough for you to start studying.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Lucien\u2019s eyes became filled with tears on the verge of falling. \u201cBut this is all your savings\u2026 I\u2026 I can\u2019t\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJoel laughed, \u201cBefore your father passed away, he helped us more than we could ever hope for. Now, you are in need. It\u2019s our responsibility to support you. After you learn to read, and then find a good job, you can pay us back easily.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll work hard.\u201d Lucien nodded with confidence.\u201cAll the money you have now can pay the fees for two months. If we work together, at least you can have a teacher every three or four months. That\u2019s my plan.\u201d Joel had regarded Lucien\u2019s study as their shared responsibility.Lucien grabbed the little purse tight, tears were falling from his eyes, \u201cThank you. Uncle Joel, Auntie Alisa, and you, John.\u201d At the same time, Lucien made up his mind to pay them back with a better life. After learning some magic, Lucien knew he had to leave Aalto as soon as possible. He could not put this family under any kind of risk.After leaving their place, Lucien still headed towards Copper Coronet. But this time, instead of finding an usurer, he was looking for a teacher.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Bards were singing, and mercenaries were talking loudly. Lucien noticed that there were beautiful women sitting beside the bar tables.Pushing through the crowd, Lucien finally squeezed his way to the counter.\u201cAny drink?\u201d Cohn asked without raising his hairy head.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Lucien.\u201dCohn was surprised when he saw Lucien\u2019s face.\u201cWhat did you do to yourself?\u201d His beard was slanted with concern, \u201cWait\u2026 Jackson came and asked about you earlier\u2026 Are you in trouble, my boy?\u201dLucien was not quite willing to repeat what happened one more time. \u201cI\u2019m fine, Cohn. The problem was solved\u2026 I\u2019m here to look for a teacher who can teach me how to read.\u201d\u201cOho! You made it?! You didn\u2019t rob the gangsters, did you?\u201d Now Cohn was even more surprised.Lucien had no choice but to explain what happened briefly to Cohn. After hearing that, Cohn was very impressed.\u201cLucien! You and John are finally real men now! I\u2019m proud of you lads!\u201d Gulping his ale, his face turned red, \u201cBut be careful, both you and John. Although chances are slim that they dare take revenge on a knight squire, but still, be wary of the bastards\u2026 you never know.\u201dLucien nodded seriously.Cohn pulled out a paper, on which there was a list of strange patterns and symbols. \u201cI cannot read,\u201d He laughed and continued, \u201cbut as a pub owner, you gotta put down something to help you remember.\u201dOn the list, there were a bunch of scholars who registered here and were willing to teach. While Cohn was speaking the names out loud, Lucien noticed a familiar name, which was written on a note beside the list.\u201cVictor? You just said Mr. Victor?\u201d Lucien stopped Cohn.\u201cYes, you know him?\u201d\u201cI met him once in the association.\u201d Lucien stared at the name, \u201cBut he\u2019s a musician, isn\u2019t he? You put a note beside his name as well.\u201dTwirling his moustache, Cohn took another look at the list and nodded. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s the same Victor we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\u201cI heard that he\u2019s gonna present a play in the Hall. Last time I saw him\u2026 he was quite busy.\u201dCohn laughed. \u201cThat\u2019s why he had to. Having a chance to play in the the Psalm Hall is even harder than you think. I heard this from other guests as well.\u201d Cohn climbed on a bar chair, \u201cSix month ago, Mr. Victor got the invitation from the Hall. Since then he turned down all his other presentations, even the one in Syracuse, to focus on his preparation. He was digging into his savings for the past couple of months.\u201d Cohn shrugged his shoulders.\u201cBut why doesn\u2019t he find another job related to music?\u201d Lucien asked.\u201cI have no idea, boy.\u201d Cohn took another sip of his ale, \u201cThose musicians\u2026 tend to be quite sensitive, or say, even crazy sometimes. I guess probably Mr. Victor also needed something to be his distraction. Who knows, those artists\u2026\u201dMr. Victor made an impression on Lucien last time, when they met in the association. Compared with the others that he did not even know, Lucien felt the musician would be a good choice.\u201cHow can I find Mr. Victor, then?\u201d he asked.\u2026\u2026The Gesu District was named after the most well-known instrument, the Gesu violin, and was where most musicians in Aalto were gathered.Big trees stood on both sides of the street, through whose branches the sunshine scattered into slightly trembling golden fragments that formed patterns on the ground. Light mixed with shadow. The street was like a painting.It took Lucien quite a long time to find the address Cohn offered. After getting lost a few times, finally he was standing in front of Victor\u2019s place, n. 12, Snehva Street.It was a two-floor small building covered with green vines. Everything was quiet and elegant here. If all went well, Lucien was going to have his reading lessons for the following two months, which could help him change his whole life.Knocking at the door gently, Lucien got a bit nervous. Soon a servant showed up inside the iron gate. Seeing Lucien, a boy wearing rough and old clothes, he frowned.\u201cYes?\u201d He asked coldly.After Lucien explained, he was still in doubt, \u201cFive Nars a month. Pay first. Are you sure?\u201dAs Lucien expected, he pulled out his money from the bag. \u201cYes, I\u2019m sure.\u201dThe servant was surprised. He couldn\u2019t believe this poor young boy could afford the price. As a servant of a famous musician, he earned ten Nars a month and could only save one every month, sometimes even less.\u201cMr. Victor enjoys high reputation. He has some acquaintances in the town hall.\u201d Opening the gate, the servant was still eyeing Lucien with suspicion. Who knew where the guy got so much money, he thought.Lucien just smiled without saying anything. The servant\u2019s attitude was within his expectation. Feel offended? That belonged to the wealthy and powerful.He followed the servant through the garden and stopped in front of the wooden gate, waiting there. A couple of minutes later, the servant showed up again.\u201cFollow me inside. Later you may give the tuition fee to Mr. Athy, the steward.\u201dIt was quite a spacious hall, decorated with a tea table, some brown couches and small desks. On the other side there was a long dining table, made of fine rosewood.Victor got a few students here as well. His study was too small for all of them. So they just sat in the hall. There were five boys and three girls sitting there, all pretty young, probably between thirteen and twenty.Quills and papers were lying in front of them on the small round tables. Some of them were transcribing something, while some were humming or reading in a low voice.According to Lucien\u2019s observation, the students also came from different backgrounds: some were of humble birth, and the others were dressing quite decently. The latter ones were usually from noble families. Most of them were not qualified to inherit their family titles and could not activate the Blessing eeither. For those children, becoming a graceful musician was quite a good choice.Mr. Victor, wearing his red jacket, was moving around and helping the students one by one.Looking around, Lucien noticed the steward in his decent black suit. From his black and white mixed hair and his wrinkled face one could tell he was not young anymore. But he was standing there straight and serious.The steward looked like a gentleman, Lucien thought. He walked towards him and asked, trying to keep his volume down.\u201cExcuse me, are you Mr. Athy?\u201d\u201cYes, I am. May I know your name and your past study?\u201d\u201cYeah, sure\u2026 I\u2019m Lucien. Lucien Evans. I never learned how to read before.\u201d While he was talking, Lucien took out five Nars.Taking the money, Athy was impressed. Apparently, the young lad was from the poor district. Most young people in Aderon were quite rude, based on his experience, while Lucien appeared pretty polite and mature.Then Athy walked to Victor and whispered to him a little bit. Victor turned around and nodded to Lucien kindly, pointing at a spare armchair.The students just noticed Lucien and were looking at their new classmate at the door curiously. Black hair, eyes, and well-formed features\u2026the new guy had a good-looking face. But he was wearing linen clothes and plain shoes. Although they were clean, they could tell from the first sight that Lucien came from a poor background.\u201cA poor wants to learn how to read?\u201d That was their first thought.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSoon most of them lowered their heads and went back to study again. Only the ones from ordinary families were still peeking at him carefully.As soon as Lucien sat down, the boy next to him moved a bit away subconsciously as if Lucien stank.Lucien did not feel offended. He shook his hand slightly and pulled out his new paper and quill. They were new. Lucien bought them with his left Fells.Victor came to Lucien a while later, with a black hard-covered book in his hand.\u201cStandard Pronunciation of Lingua Franca and Basic Grammar, very suitable for a beginner. Turn to page 1, chapter 1. We start from the pronunciation of the thirty-two letters.\u201d Victor said gently.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Carefully he opened the book like turning to a new page of his future. Within his expectation, the words in the book were the same as the ones in the magic tomes he collected at the witch\u2019s chamber.He knew how to learn a language well. As long as he learned the pronunciation of the letters and the basic rules of spelling, he could learn more by himself outside of the class by reading intensively.Victor repeated the pronunciations patiently two to three times on each word. Lucien followed him carefully and wrote down some notes on the paper. \u201cRead them until you becomes more fluent.\u201d Victor said, \u201cWhen it\u2019s good enough, we\u2019ll move to basic spelling and grammar.\u201dWhat he said was actually more like an encouragement. As a beginner, it would be almost impossible for Lucien to match the sounds and the letters in such a short amount of time.The notes Lucien jot down were Chinese characters. He tried to relate these letters with his mother tongue, just like he had done when he started learning English. Again, Lucien read through it and he stayed focused, so the knowledge would enter his spirit library.As expected, a new shelf labeled \u201cCommon Tongue\u201d appeared, on which there was a black hardcover book full of the strange characters, the same one that was lying in front of him on reality.Lucien opened the book in the library but found out only the first few pages were there, and the rest of the book was simply blank. He went through the book on the table quickly, and as he imagined, the spiritual version became complete instantly.\u201cYes!\u201d Lucien cheered in his mind.With the help of the library, Lucien became more confident. It was very hard from the beginning. Several times later he became better and better. After what seemed like the fifteenth time, he got finally satisfied with his ability to remember them.Of course, Lucien knew this would not last long. If he did not review that in a regular basis, they would be forgotten very soon. At the same time, Lucien also found out that his spiritual power, which helped him with the spellcasting before, could help improve his memory as well.At this time, Victor came back to teach Lucien again. After a while helping the students, his face looked tired but also more relaxed. Probably Cohn was right: Victor was using teaching as a distraction.\u201cHave you memorized all of them?\u201d Victor asked, smiling. \u201cLet me check it.\u201dLike a primary student facing his teacher, Lucien was a bit nervous. He did forget some of them, but mind then drifted into his library and he started reading according to his notes. It wasn\u2019t Lucien\u2019s intention to cheat, but both his money and time were limited. He had plenty of time reviewing them again in the library later.Victor was surprised, \u201cHave you learned before?\u201dSome of the students raised their heads and looked at Lucien.\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201d answered Lucien.\u201cImpressive.\u201d Victor commended, \u201cThen we will start learning how to spell.\u201dWhile some students were surprised, some of them scorned. In their eyes, Lucien must have learned it before, and was just another scheming guy who wanted to impress Mr. Victor and earn the chance to be his formal music student.Inside the study room, the three most noble among them had started learning music.However, that did not distract Lucien at all. There was only one goal in his mind: learn as much as possible. Time is money! A day\u2019s learning cost a lot!\u201cAll right, ladies and gentlemen. Let\u2019s take a break.\u201d Victor clapped gently and then walked upstairs. At the same time, the servants came with tea and fruits.The scent of Jasmine and lemon filled the room. Some of the fruits Lucien knew, and some he did not.A young guy decently dressed smiled at the classmates around him, with a piece of tablature in his hand. \u201cIt seems like Mr. Victor got some inspiration. We may call it a day now, if his inspiration keeps flowing.\u201d He looked a bit older than Lucien. His eyes were long and narrow and his nose straight. Among them, this guy was pretty outstanding.A noble girl in a wine-colored dress was sitting right beside him. \u201cIf class finishes earlier, we\u2019re gonna have an extra one during the weekend. Don\u2019t get too excited.\u201d She responded in a lazy voice, \u201cBut I do hope Mr. Victor finishes his new song for the concert as soon as possible. So we will finally be able to start practicing with the orchestra. Sitting in the room, merely reading tablatures and playing flute by myself can never compete with a real rehearsal.\u201dAround seventeen or eighteen, she was pretty good-looking: hair long and bright red, like fire, thick and sexy lip, and her waist was not tightened like most noble girls \u2013 otherwise she would not be able to play the flute well.Looking at her serious face, Lott laughed, \u201cThe first violinist, the man who is as handsome as a silver moon\u2026 You like Rhine, don\u2019t you? Felicia?\u201dThe first violinist, also called concertmaster, played a significant role in a symphony orchestra. When the conductor was absent, the first violinist would take the baton.\u201cI just feel he has excellent skills, much better than the last one.\u201d Felicia argued, but her face flushed, \u201cDon\u2019t you think his solo for violin sonata No.1 in G minor was really impressive?\u201dTalking about music, Lott became serious and excited. They started discussing sonatas and suites. Other noble students also joined them, showing their great interest. Even a pretty insightful comment made by a brown-haired girl with ordinary family background won their consent.In Aalto, music was another common tongue.However, consciously or subconsciously, the noble students still often ignored the others, while the common ones treated Lucien indifferently and tried to get close to the ones of higher status. For noble students it was likely that the ordinary and the poor did not even deserve their attention. There were no common things between them, as they had come from different worlds.There were no bitter words, nor scorn. But the cold wall was always there, preventing those of different social statuses from getting along.But for Lucien, none of these mattered. He was trying to make full use of every minute or even second, absorbing the knowledge like a dry sponge thrown into an ocean.Some of their humming came into Lucien\u2019s ears. He found music here was very similar to that of Earth. There were just some differences on notes.After a while, Lucien raised his head. The students were still discussing. Lucien took a sip from his tea cup and dove into his book again.Unfortunately, Mr. Victor\u2019s inspiration did not last long. Several minutes later, he walked downstairs with a tired and anxious face.Going back to teaching definitely helped him a lot.Lucien worked hard. By the end of the class, Lucien remembered most of the spelling rules and stored them in his spirit library.Their study ended around ten past four in the afternoon. Except for Lott, Felicia and another noble teen named Herodotus, who stayed to practice with instruments, the rest of the students left the hall in a row.Out of the hall, there were two carriages waiting. The brown horses were tall and strong, snorting. The two noble students were surely envied by the rest.Most nobles must maintain their decent look no matter if they were actually doing well or not.The carriages left in a cloud of dust. The other three students, however, headed towards Purple Lily district as a group, chatting and laughing.And thus Lucien was left behind, reviewing what he learned in his mind like a nerd.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re learning from Mr. Victor? He\u2019s the top musician!\u201d After dinner, Joel was quite excited, \u201cLittle Evans, are you really going to carry on my music dream?\u201d\u201cEvery dog has its day, uncle Joel. Probably I can.\u201d Lucien replied playfully.After coming back to his home, lying in his almost-broken, shaky bed, Lucien entered into his library and started reading one of the magic notes, trying to understand the words in it.Of course, Lucien was not expecting that he could learn how to read within one-day study. He was just trying to read some to reinforce his memory.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He read about ten pages, but most of them felt like independent words instead of meaningful sentences, probably because so many words in the notes about magic were really uncommon.For sure Lucien had his own guesses of the meaning of some of them. But it was magic. He had to be more than careful before actually taking actions. Lucien did not want to die because of a stupid misreading mistake.Fortunately, the previous owner of the notes treated it also like a diary. Some of her thoughts and experiences were written down as well. For this part, the witch used common words and grammar, from which Lucien managed to know the history of those magic notes, or say, books.The witch was born in the last sorcerer family of the destroyed ancient Sylvanas Magic Empire. Her family hid into their old castle deep into the mountains to avoid the church\u2019s slaughtering, ever since Aalto was taken over. But after hundreds of years there, the population of the family declined dramatically. In the end there were just three left: the witch and her parents.The witch\u2019s parents died in an accident when they tried to summon a creature whose name Lucien was not able to read. Then the witch became an orphan and she inherited two magic books: Astrology and Magic Elements; and Common Magic Related Materials Illustration.Lucien wished the notes were relatively complete so he could understand it, otherwise he would have to learn the dying Sylvana\u2019s language which, so to speak, was impossible.\u2026\u2026Almost all of the jobs Copper Cornet could offer were under the control of the Aaron gang. Lucien lost his job again. He had to dig into his savings recently to support himself.But it was also nice that Lucien could seize the chance staying focused on his study, as well as avoiding the possible revenge from the gang. Joel was still playing on the busy streets in the administrative district, while Alisa was doing laundries for the association. Both of them were relatively far from the market area, where the Aaron gang tyrannized the most.They all agreed that Lucien still ranked first among them regarding being in danger. They warned Lucien not to leave the city, not to go to anywhere deserted, and even told him to be alert during bed time in case some bastards tried to burn down his shack.So, after washing his face and finishing his hard brown bread softened in boiling water, Lucien felt there was nothing for him to do.But the feeling did not last more than a minute. Soon Lucien went outside and found an open field. He started to practice sword with a wood stick following John\u2019s direction. Lucien longed for strength to protect himself, even though he knew his training was too late. John told Lucien that after sixteen years old, the chance of a person being Blessed was very slim, close to none, unless he received the Holy Light Water from the church.Lucien also kept Jackson\u2019s dagger handy, in case of any danger.After practicing, Lucien went back home. It was nine o\u2019clock in the morning. The sun in the sky just started showing its real power. Taking a short rest, Lucien opened his books again and started reviewing. He was much more diligent and self-disciplined than ever before.\u2026\u202612 Snehva Street, Gesu.\u201cYou have never really learned these before?\u201d Victor asked with great surprise, \u201cNone of them?\u201dLucien\u2019s progress was more than impressive. He answered all the questions perfectly and fluently. He even asked some questions he found in spelling, which most students could not notice at all until they started having a solid foundation. With just one day study, Lucien had almost caught up with his classmates, Colin and Renee. The two students from common background had been studying here for more than three months.Was Lucien a genius? Or just a liar. The students were guessing.\u201cI swear I have not, Mr. Victor. We\u2019re already speaking common tongues in our lives, aren\u2019t we? I can\u2019t read, but I know the connections between the letters and sounds are more important. I used my imagination.\u201d Lucien explained. He wanted people to believe he was just smart, instead of regarding him as an incomprehensible monster, which would possibly bring him trouble.For sure Lucien did not tell him about the library.Victor nodded and smiled approvingly, \u201cGood, very good. You\u2019re gifted in learning language.\u201dLucien was envied by most students in the class. Hearing Victor\u2019s commendation, Lott and Felicia, who had been learning from Victor for five years, exchanged a look.\u201cIt sounds pretty useful.\u201d Felicia nodded slightly with her hands crossed over her lap. As a noble girl, she always sat straight.Lott was about to shrug his shoulders, but was stopped by the thought that the gesture might not look elegant. Facing Felicia, his long time competitor, Lott tended to be more careful.\u201cThe poor speak the common tongue as well. They just don\u2019t know how to spell and read. It\u2019s always better than starting from scratch, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He also added, \u201cEven if they learn it, it won\u2019t be much useful for learning music.\u201d\u201cI have my own idea for learning music, not like you.\u201d Felicia responded sharply, \u201cYou\u2019re gifted, but gift cannot last long. If I were you, I\u2019d spend more time on practicing instead of fooling around with girls.\u201d She then looked at Lucien. \u201cEven the poor guy, if he starts learning music he will probably do a better job than you.\u201d She smiled with her bright beautiful teeth.All the classmates believed that Lucien wanted to become a musician. They did not know the actual simple reason why Lucien chose Victor as his teacher. In the eyes of the common folk, choosing a teacher represented one\u2019s future path. For example, if a person wanted to be an official in the town hall or the court, he or she would definitely choose scholars with law or history background, instead of a musician.But all careers needed to be recognized by nobles. Only then it would indicate real success.\u201cIf he\u2019s better than me, he\u2019s better than you, Felicia.\u201d Lott sneered.Felicia was about to say more, but noticed Victor was looking in this direction. She raised her hand and tidied her red hair, then lowered her head and went back to her studies.Victor started speeding up Lucien\u2019s learning. Soon they finished the rest of the spelling rules and moved to basic grammar, which was exactly what Lucien was expecting.\u2026\u2026Friday, the last day of Lucien\u2019s study this week.After a few days\u2019 learning, Lucien had mastered most of the grammar. Were it not for lacking vocabulary, Lucien could even start learning magic now. He had made a big progress with the magic notes as well, in which the witch explained why she came to Aalto:\u201cAlong with the increase in my spiritual power, it has become harder for me to immerse myself in meditation\u2026 Shall I try the meditating the way only real sorcerers can?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cIt was too dangerous. I almost died. Perhaps I should improve the apprentice meditation based on my experience.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI got lost, completely. No wonder all the great seniors didn\u2019t make any improvement. I\u2019m too shallow, too arrogant.\u201d\u201cEven the magic structure of the first level is too complicated. I can\u2019t find a way to build the magic mark model. It\u2019s driving me crazy\u2026 I have the potion already, but without the model I can\u2019t move forward to be a real sorceress!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 maybe I should try to make a potion of \u2018Magic Gate\u2019. It contains a level-one magic in it. Perhaps I can make it this way.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u201cI need Snow Gorse\u2026 Maybe I should go to Aalto. It\u2019s the biggest city on the west continent. There\u2019re also many hidden sorcerers and sorceress. It\u2019s dangerous, but I shall still have a chance.\u201dSo far, that was all Lucien could read from the notes. He was very curious about her experience in Aalto, but decided to finish the remaining few pages later tonight.Today Lucien also wanted to borrow a common tongue dictionary and put it into his library. If everything went well, Lucien could start learning magic on the weekend.His heart was full of hope.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Within fifty minutes he absorbed the rest of the grammar rules. He was smart and gifted in learning language, and had a good memory as well.Good mood brought him ideas. Victor started humming.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, let\u2019s have a break. Help yourself to some tea and snack. I gotta jot this down.\u201d He was already trotting upstairs when he finished talking.Picking up the fine white teacup, Lucien took a sip of the weird-tasting tea. Rubbing his eyes, he tried to relax a little bit.\u201cFelicia, when can we go hunting in your family\u2019s manor again? I miss the deers and rabbits there so much, and also the fresh air.\u201dAnnie was another noble lady among them. However, except for her beautiful blond hair and gem-like green eyes, her appearance was just around average. Besides, her family was not that distinguished as well. Her father was just one of the many children of a common baron, who failed to inherit anything from the family. No title, no land, no manor. Annie\u2019s family had to struggle to live a seemingly decent life with the income from her father work as a court clerk and the annuity from their title.In comparison, the Hayne family, as one of the biggest families in the Duchy of Orvarit, still enjoyed a high reputation. Although her father did not inherit the title either, he still got a big manor outside of Aalto with its own woods, orchards, and even a granite quarry. They also possessed a property inside of the city.Among them, Felicia had the most distinguished family background.On hot summer days, there was nothing better than escaping from the heat enjoying some hunting and some homemade wine in a manor away from the city. Many young nobles who did not have a manor in their families would of course long for it. Lucien could tell Annie was trying to get close to Felicia.\u201cIs that true, lady Felicia? Are there rabbits and cute deers in your family\u2019s manor?\u201d Renee got in the conversation, asking with curiosity.Since they started studying together, Renee always tried to cotton up to the noble students by talking about music, which worked very well.She was thus encouraged. Through music, she started joining conversations between noble students more. Somehow she learned a bit on some theories about music. Often she asked Felicia or Annie related questions and became more and more acquainted with the nobles.Learning from her, Colin and David started doing the same.Lucien, perhaps because he was too nerdy and reserved, only cared about his own study. And for sure neither the nobles nor the commons would take the initiative to talk to him.\u201cI miss the place as well.\u201d Felicia was still sitting straight, answering with her standard smile, \u201cBut there are only around three months left before Mr. Victor\u2019s performance. Lott, Herodotus and I have to practice a lot. I really have no time to go there.\u201dFor sure, Felicia was happy for being flattered and being the envy of the other students. Who would not?It would not be true to say that Lucien did not want to have a look at such a fancy manor. But the most urgent thing in his mind was how to borrow the dictionary and finish browsing through it as quickly as possible.Victor came downstairs with a slight smile hanging on his face. Apparently he was pretty satisfied with his work. The chatting stopped.Athy, the steward, came in when Victor was about to continue his teaching. He whispered in Victor\u2019s ear, \u201cYour guest is here, my Lord.\u201d\u201cOh! I forgot!\u201d Shaking his right hand, he looked a bit annoyed, \u201cLet him in, please.\u201dThen he turned to his students, apologizing politely.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, ladies and gentlemen. I forgot I would have a guest here today. Can we resume the class tomorrow afternoon at two? I\u2019m really sorry.\u201dThe students were happy to have an early end today. When they were preparing to leave, Lucien walked closer to Mr. Victor, ready to ask him to borrow the common tongue dictionary for a few days.Before Lucien began his request, two guests came in following the steward. One was a silver-haired pretty man in a red shirt and black coat, and the other was a white-haired elderly man with a wooden suitcase in his hands.\u201cMr. Rhine\u2026\u201d Lucien and Felicia recognized the guest at the same time.Felicia\u2019s face turned pink, while Lucien felt even more surprised. He thought Rhine was just a bard living in the tavern. Rhine being Mr. Victor\u2019s important guest was quite unexpected for Lucien.\u201cHi, Felicia. And\u2026 you\u2019re here, Lucien!\u201d Rhine greeted them gracefully.Felicia smiled shyly, and a second later she was very surprised: how did Mr. Rhine know Lucien?\u201cLucien, you know Mr. Rhine?\u201d Victor smiled.\u201cYes, we\u2019ve met before.\u201d Lucien nodded, \u201cI Didn\u2019t expect I\u2019d meet Mr. Rhine again here at your place.\u201dRhine\u2019s smile was pretty attractive like an elf.\u201cYes, we met once before and Lucien impressed me. At that time he was telling us that he wanted to learn how to read. And look! Here he is! I always appreciate young people striving for their dreams.\u201dCommended by Rhine, even Lucien felt a bit shy.\u201cMr. Rhine is the concertmaster I\u2019m currently working with, who has very unique and excellent understanding towards music. Without his help, I don\u2019t think I could be inspired with my piano concerto.\u201d\u201cWhat!? Rhine\u2019s the master now!?\u201d That almost made Lucien\u2019s jaw drop. He had met Rhine in Copper Cornet in the slum several days before.From his classmates\u2019 conversation, Lucien knew that the structure of a symphony orchestra here was similar to the ones on the earth. The first violinist was the concertmaster, who would also be responsible for conducting the orchestra when the conductor was absent. How could Rhine, a stranger who had never cooperated with the team before, get such an important position?From Lucien\u2019s expression Rhine could tell he was very surprised. He explained easily, \u201cThe previous master fell in love with a noble lady, who eloped with her to Syracuse several days ago. Mr. Victor had no one else to find but me.\u201d He shrugged his shoulders and smiled.\u201cMr. Rhine should be the first violinist of the orchestra, even if the previous master was still here.\u201d Felicia cut in with her flushed face, \u201cMr. Rhine just needs more practice with the others.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d Victor also thought highly of Rhine, \u201cMr. Rhine\u2019s one of the best violinists I\u2019ve ever met. I was more than lucky to have him here.\u201dLucien looked at Rhine, who was smiling politely with his right hand laying on his heart, showing his gratitude. Within a few days, a bard was exiled from Syracuse with his harp, and he happened to become the first violinist of a symphony orchestra in Aalto. It was too strange for Lucien. It could not be a coincidence.\u201cThis is Mr. Shavell, the most excellent harpsichord maker in Aalto.\u201d Rhine started introducing the elderly man beside him, \u201cMr. Shavell shall be able to help you with the improvement.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Mr. Shavell. It\u2019s an honour for me to have you here.\u201d Victor shook hands with him enthusiastically and led him upstairs, before Lucien had any chance to talk to him.Victor was so excited that he forgot to ask Athy to see his students out. Unsure about the relationship between Lucien and Rhine, Athy did not ask him to leave instantly either. Next, Felicia, Annie, Colin and some other students came upstairs quietly, filled with curiosity.Lucien was not willing to leave without the dictionary, so he also followed upstairs to end up in Mr. Victor\u2019s practice room.\u201cMr. Shavell, I was hoping the harpsichord could be more sensitive to the pressure of my fingers, so the the control of its volume can be more accurate.\u201d Watching Shavell open his harpsichord, Victor made detailed his request, \u201cMy music requires a wider range of tones. More resonant and vigorous, but also delicate and clear.\u201dThere were lots of different components in it: springs, pivots, plectrums, strings\u2026 Since it was invented, many makers and musicians tried to improve the harpsichord, including adding extra pivots, stops, replacing soundboard, etc.Slightly frowning his eyebrows, Shevell was carefully checking the parts.\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s impossible, Mr. Victor. Over more than 300 years of upgrades, this kind of instrument has reached its limitation. Even a slight improvement on it would be quite hard.\u201dBoth Victor and Rhine lost their words, especially Victor. If the harpsichord could not be improved, his music would definitely not be perfect. In that case, the performance in the Psalm Hall would be a foreseeable failure for him.Everyone remained silent for a while, until Lucien started asking all of a sudden.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCan we\u2026 can we turn it into a kind of percussion instrument\u2026? Changing it from plucking to hitting.\u201dLucien noticed that this world had yet to invent the \u201cking of musical instruments\u201d, the piano. Musicians were still working on harpsichords and clavichords. He got his own plan: If he could help Mr. Victor with his improvement, probably there would be no more five Nars every month, and, of course, borrowing a dictionary would be a piece of cake.As early as they started talking about improving the harpsichord, Lucien opened his Piano: Manufacture and Tones and Mechanism of Modern Piano in his spirit library. He got a rough idea from leafing through the first several pages.\u201cThen what would be the difference between it and a clavichord?\u201d Shevell threw a stern look at Lucien, \u201cYes you can control the volume with percussion, but the sound\u2019s too delicate and the volume too low. It\u2019s only suitable for playing at home, not a hall.\u201dIt was in Aalto, the City of Psalm, the City of Music. No one suspected the real reason why Lucien understood the difference between a harpsichord and a clavichord.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He knew that without an improved harpsichord, those picky nobles, musicians and critics would by no means be satisfied with his performance. What was worse, he would also receive a bitter comment from Wolf on Music Criticism, and then he\u2019d never have a second chance to play in the Psalm Hall again during his life.He had seen many excellent musicians fail to perform perfectly in the Hall and suffer lots of setbacks afterwards. Every two or three years there would be a desperate musician among those committing suicide because of his failure. Indeed, most musicians could be quite sensitive and vulnerable.Although he understood Lucien was just trying to help, Victor still felt a bit annoyed by Lucien\u2019s groundless guessing. Controlling himself, he answered with his low voice.\u201cThank you, Lucien. But it\u2019s more complicated than just combining the two.\u201d\u201cSuch an arrogant fool from the slum\u2026\u201d The noble students were angry about Lucien\u2019s interruption. While Lott, Herodotus, and Felicia were glaring at Lucien with distaste, Rhine was standing to the site, with an almost undetectable smile on his face, as if he was looking forward to Lucien\u2019s answer.Although Lucien hadn\u2019t got a full understanding of the two books, he still had some overall ideas. By observing the inner structure of the harpsichord in front of him, he was ready to share his thoughts.\u201cWith the help of a certain\u2026 unit, the finger movement might be enlarged through the process of conduction, so the striking from the hammers inside could be louder.\u201dLucien explained it vaguely on purpose, carefully choosing his words to match those of a common lad living in the slum, to avoid suspicion. Terms like \u2018amplitude\u2019 were definitely not supposed to show up in his vocabulary.\u201cEnlarge? Like what?\u201d Shavell\u2019s eyes were still stern and his white eyebrows twisted together. He had heard similar ideas before, but after several attempts failed, they all gave up in the end.Under their gaze, Lucien took down a flute from the wall. \u201cOnce, I saw a farmer who lifted a big rock with a wooden stick and a small rock, like this\u2026\u201d He grabbed a ink bottle and put it under the flute and started doing levering.\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Instead of refuting, Shavell started thinking. Soon he noticed the disadvantage. \u201cBut like this, the striking speed would be slower.\u201d\u201cImpressive, Lucien. You are showing us the Lever Principle.\u201d Rhine watched Lucien\u2019s model carefully and took a step closer to him.Pretending confusion, Lucien was actually very surprised. How come Rhine knew the Lever Principle? People here called it the same way? But the rest of them seemed really confused.\u201cYou may all have seen it before in your lives. I heard the principle when I was traveling to Holm. Actually local scholars there already discovered it hundreds of years ago. But here, people worship divine power and the Blessing in the blood, so science doesn\u2019t pervade very fast.\u201d Rhine explained.\u201cHave you noticed that the longer the stick is, the easier you can lift something on the other end, Lucien?\u201d Rhine asked.\u201cObviously,\u201d Lucien thought, but his face put on a confused look as he said, \u201cReally? Then can we put more than one lever together?\u201dLucien stopped himself here. He could not go any further talking about stuff like multi-lever transmission.Rhine\u2019s eyes were lightened immediately. \u201cConnection! Multi levers!\u201d He walked close to Shavell and talked to him in a low voice. He was drawing on a paper.\u201cRhine\u2026 He\u2019s more than a bard. I\u2019m almost sure.\u201d Lucien thought while Rhine talking. The bard\u2019s hands were waving in the air explaining the principle.Soon Victor joined their heated discussion.\u201cLucien, how did you connect them together? I mean, yes, I saw it before several times but I never thought it could be used on this.\u201d Surprisingly, Lott started talking to Lucien.But he was stopped by Felicia, \u201cBe quiet. Go downstairs if you want to chat.\u201dLott did not want to miss their discussion now. He nodded and remained silent.The rest of the students were pretty annoyed by the factor that Lucien, the nobody who just recently arrived there, somehow got the spotlight. They were hoping his idea wouldn\u2019t work out.Understanding that there were still many more differences between a harpsichord and a modern piano, Lucien once again started reading his two books, to see if there was more he could help with.\u2026\u2026An elegant melody came out from the room, resonant and rich at the beginning, gentle and soft in the end.\u201cAwesome!\u201d Victor\u2019s face was glowing with excitement, \u201cThank you, Rhine. Thank you, Mr. Shavell.\u201d Although there was still a way to go, the key problem had been solved.\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure.\u201d Rhine smiled elegantly.After hugging both of them, Victor came to Lucien with his open arms. \u201cThank you, Lucien. You gave us the direction. Thanks God for bringing you to me.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Mr. Victor.\u201d Being hugged by a man, Lucien felt a bit awkward. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect I could actually help.\u201dVictor laughed and thanked Lucien again sincerely. \u201cAnyway, from now on, if you need any help, just ask.\u201dThe rest of the students started being envious again. The newcomer earned Mr. Victor\u2019s favour so quickly!Lucien was very glad as well.\u201cYes\u2026 Yes, Mr. Victor.\u201d He asked shyly, \u201cI do need help with something\u2026\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d Victor was waiting for his request, smiling. In his eyes, Lucien was genuinely a good-hearted and promising young lad.\u201cCan I borrow your common tongue dictionary?\u201d Rubbing his hands, Lucien was pretty unsure.\u201cAh?\u201d Rhine couldn\u2019t stop himself from laughing.

He felt he was asking for too much.Noticing Lucien\u2019s hesitation, Victor tried to encourage him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t be shy.

He was almost laughing to tears. Even a serious elderly man like Shavell was smiling and shaking his head, not to mention Lott, Felicia and Herodotus. The rest of the students who hadn\u2019t had a chance to be Mr. Victor\u2019s music students laughed as well, albeit bitterly to some extent.Lucien felt a bit awkward. \u201cMr. Victor?\u201d He asked carefully.Victor stopped himself after several coughs, looking at Lucien seriously. \u201cI mean, Lucien\u2026 would you like to study music under me? I know it\u2019s hard to start from scratch at your age, but a smart and hardworking young lad like you could still be a qualified musician in the future. Also, completely for free.\u201d Victor added humorously.Victor had three types of students: the ones learning how to read, which paid five Nars every month; the ones selected among the previous type, who would learn music from him for the price of ten Nars a month; and only a really gifted and outstanding student could perform with him and benefit from his fame and network. Victor, for now, had just one student like that, who was already a well-known musician.So, what Victor offered meant that Lucien could save ten Nars every month. On the other hand, that much was still not a lot for the musician, even now when he was kind of struggling because of his current income. Victor would only earn about seven gold Thales a year for teaching these students, which of course did not mean much to him. When Victor was performing for the nobles, his income was around 100 gold Thales annually.Actually, merely seven Thales a year was already pretty good for most of the commoners. Annie\u2019s father, a court clerk, earned no more than fifteen Thales a year.Although the other students envied Lucien, he was a bit hesitant about the offer. He never thought he would learn music. Different thoughts were flashing through his mind: the witch\u2019s note, John\u2019s family, and his own plan\u2026\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to live in Aalto for a longer time, until I find a better place to learn magic. After all, Aalto\u2019s the biggest and busiest city in the west. Being a respectable musician can be a pretty good cover for me.\u201dSoon Lucien made up his mind, and his face lit up with a smile.\u201cOf course. That would be great honor.Thank you, Mr. Victor. Really.\u201dVictor was nodding with satisfaction, \u201cYou\u2019re both smart and diligent, and also have a simple heart. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll achieve something if you keep working like this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that simple\u2026\u201d Lucien thought to himself. At the same time, he felt slightly uncomfortable with the way the other students were looking at him.Having his dictionary and the returned five Nars with him, Lucien left the house and was ready to go back home.\u201cGood job, Lucien!\u201d The girl with brown hair and green eyes caught up with Lucien from behind. \u201cI\u2019m Renee, Renee Weisz. I just want to say that your talent really impressed me\u2026\u201dBeing eager to read the rest of the witch\u2019s note, Lucien was not in a chatting mood now. \u201cHi, Renee. I\u2019m running late for an appointment\u2026 I\u2019m sorry but\u2026 can we talk next time?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 all right..\u201d Her expression froze for a second but soon the smile came back.At this time Annie and another noble student, Maxi, passed by them and Annie\u2019s mouth twisted in a contemptuous sneer. Keeping her elegant paces, Annie directly walked away without having a glimpse of Renee.From a distance, Colin and David sneered at Renee as well. But they also wished they could be as lucky as Lucien.\u2026\u2026The early summer sunshine still shone over Aderon at around five in the afternoon, when Lucien arrived at his house. He couldn\u2019t wait to read the rest of the notes. The good news could wait until tomorrow to be shared with Alisa and her family.Devouring the brown bread, Lucien locked the wooden door from the inside. After taking out his quill and paper he was ready to start his exploration again. Then he entered into his spirit library to copy the dictionary.Finishing the work, Lucien opened the witch\u2019s book again.By ten o\u2019clock that night, Lucien had finished all of his reading. With a long sigh, he stretched slowly.It looked like the witch was not very good at reading ancient Sylvanas texts as well, because she took the notes in great detail. Some of the parts came directly from her ancestors. Lucien was pretty confident that he could just follow her notes to learn magic.The only problem was that the notes explained no further than how to become a primary-level sorcerer. After that point Lucien would have to find other ways to advance. Or maybe he could learn some ancient Sylvanas characters from the note and learn the contents from the book Astrology and Magic Elements.Anyway, now Lucien was ready to start learning magic.According to the notes, people in ancient magic empires believed that magic worked as the result of four basic elements \u2013 earth, fire, wind, water \u2013 releasing power under the guidance of their spirit. Later, light, darkness and necromancy magic joined in. And sorcerers were also able to summon demons from hell, pits or other dimensions.At the same time, all the magic could be divided into eight schools: Element, Astrology, Necromancy, Illusion, Summoning, Force, Transformation and Alchemy. The book Astrology and Magic Elements was mainly focused on Element and Astrology magic.Before becoming a real sorcerer, an apprentice could only learn some simple tricks instead of real first circle magic.In Lucien\u2019s viewpoint, the structure of those apprentice spells was very simple. They were just some geometric patterns combined together, which could be triggered by the spells and corresponding magic reagents.There were also three levels of the sorcerer apprentices: in training, intermediate, and advanced, graded according to the different levels of spiritual power, which determined how many spells they were able to cast in a row \u2013 five, ten and twenty, respectively.Through meditation an apprentice could improve his or her spiritual power. With the help of certain magic potions, he or she could start mentally building a first circle magic structure. Those who succeeded would become real sorcerers. Having sufficient spiritual power was the key factor during the process, because the casting of magic from the first circle did not require any spelling, magic reagents or gestures.\u201cToday I met another sorcerer here in Aalto. I\u2019m really excited. But he looked a bit weird\u2026 very different from the ones hiding.\u201d Lucien got really encouraged when he found out that there were still other sorcerers in the city.\u2026\u201cI found some strange red-eyed rats in the sewers. I detected magic on them, but I cannot trace them, yet.\u201d\u2026\u201cMy experiment shows that they\u2019re very fast-breeding, and their blood is toxic, which can lead to hallucinatory experience and paralysis. It is a perfect match for my Lapland Bloodvine. I think my magic trap is ready now\u2026 But who do those rats belong to?\u201d\u2026Lucien was shocked to know that the rats didn\u2019t belong to the witch. That was to say, there were probably still other dangerous things down there.And the notes kept going:\u201cI met the sorcerer again. His thoughts about magic were so unique, his knowledge broad and profound. He was\u2026 very attractive.\u201cBut he said that the ancient magic was outdated, except for those really powerful ones, which could still be valuable. Also, he mentioned those ancient people were ignorant and uncivilized\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026 It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cHe showed me a magic book called Arcana. It was thin. Actually he called it a\u2026 journal. He said that Arcana is the nature, the theory of magic. But I never thought magic could actually be explained. I was shocked\u2026\u201cThe book, or journal, was first released more than three hundred years ago. It started from a script of a great arcanist in a sorcerer conference. Three hundred years ago\u2026 I\u2019ve never heard of any of this before\u2026 After reading it, I was shocked. I don\u2019t even know how I came back home.\u201dThe witch took down some of the script from the journal. Her writing was messy in this part. Lucien could tell her hands were shaking with great excitement.Here was the script in the note:\u201cLadies and gentlemen. Many years ago, in order to fight against the magic creatures, our respectable ancestors learned how to exert our spiritual power directly from dragons, elves, giants, and even from demons. They studied them: their bodies, their blood, their inner magic patterns\u2026 and thus our ancestors were able to evolve their own human bodies. They left us the meditation to strengthen our spirit; they left us magic structures to empower their offsprings; and they left us a peaceful continent by pushing those evil creatures back into the pits with their great power.\u201cDragons are hiding. Giants migrated. Elves are gone deep inside their forests\u2026 Now we are the owners of the land!\u201cThe Great Victory, ladies and gentlemen. The Great Victory had been reminding us for hundreds of years to keep seeking greater power, from the pits to hell, from hell to other dimensions, until the Saint Truth Church gained its power\u2026 Within a few hundred years, our empires were conquered, our sorcerers slaughtered and exiled. Our past glory died in the ashes of our castles.\u201cIt\u2019s about time we take a step back and ask ourselves: What on earth are we pursuing? What can we do to prevent our magic from dying? Have you ever thought about the following questions:\u201cWhat\u2019s the nature of magic?\u201cWhy are we endowed with spiritual power?\u201cHow does that power exist?\u201cAre earth, fire, wind and water, really the most basic elements in the world? If they are, how do they stick together to form everything we know? And if not, which are the real magic elements?\u201cWhat\u2019s the nature of the soul? Is it different from consciousness?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201dDo we need any certain \u2018tools\u2019 to help us with the magic structures?\u201cDoes God exist? If God exists, who is our God? Why can vampires remain undead forever?\u201cWhy is there a sun and a moon in the world? Why do they rise and set every day? What keeps them moving in such a manner?\u201cIf we can explore more about the world itself instead of chasing power around blindly, we can find the truth about magic, know who we are and understand where we should go.\u201dThe name of the great arcanist was Douglas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he first came here he also had many questions about the world. However, he soon forgot all his questions while struggling to survive.These overwhelming questions pointed directly to the origin of the world. Lucien believed that if he could figure them out, he might be able to learn how he came here and how to go back.\u201cEven if the arcanist named Douglas had not completely understood any of the problems, as long as he was still working on them he should be an extraordinary arcanist nowadays, comparable to the sorcerers and sorceress of legend.\u201d Lucien was organizing his thoughts.\u201cThere\u2019s a journal called Arcana. The witch did meet other sorcerer in this city. Everything seems to indicate there are still safe places for people to learn magic. But why would it be a journal? It sounds pretty academic\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy call him an arcanist instead of a sorcerer? Does an arcanist rank higher than a sorcerer?\u201d\u2026\u2026Lucien got more and more excited with his thoughts. He wished he could meet the sorcerer as soon as possible and move somewhere where he could learn magic safely. He would come back to Aalto and do something for little Iven\u2019s family when he became stronger.Among all questions, the two Lucien felt most interested in were:\u201cAre earth, fire, wind and water, really the most basic elements in the world? If they are, how do they stick together to form everything we know? And if not, which are the real magic elements?\u201d\u201cWhy is there a sun and a moon in the world? Why do they rise and set every day? What keeps them moving in such a manner?\u201dAccording to what Lucien had learned before, earth, fire, wind and water were not basic elements. As for the second question, it drew his attention because they seemed to want to combine the rules of the physical universe with magic, in case Lucien\u2019s knowledge might really come in handy to learn magic faster.However, Lucien didn\u2019t know how helpful his knowledge would be in this world. It was a world full of incredible creatures, magic, divine power and souls. Nevertheless, Lucien hadn\u2019t met anything that varied from the basic laws of physics. And he did find the same materials, like silver, copper and iron.\u201cI might have been wrong before, regarding why some books in my library were locked.\u201d Lucien guessed, agitated with the prospect.Gradually he calmed down. He was now more mature and understood that no matter how great ambition one had, sitting there and daydreaming would not change anything. After all, every person still had to be practical.He turned to the last page of the note:\u201cSometimes, during the break of my meditation and experiments, I think about him. He\u2019s wise, elegant, and attractive.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cHe said he came here to Aalto for an important secret mission. If everything goes well, in some months he might take me to the heaven of our sorcerers and sorceress \u2014 \u2018The Continental Congress of Magic\u2019.\u201cWe have an appointment in the cemetery. I wonder what he\u2019ll tell me.\u201dThe witch\u2019s notes ended here. \u201cShe and her sorcerer friend must have been ambushed by the night watchmen. I wonder if the sorcerer managed to escape\u2026\u201d Lucien thought with some disappointment. The Continental Congress of Magic was his only clue for now. But he had no idea how to find other hiding sorcerers and sorceresses.Taking a deep breath, Lucien decided to start his first meditation. He eliminated all the distractions in his mind and got ready for it.Following the note, Lucien kept his breathes long and gentle. Along with the breathing he let his spirit freely spread like water and then drew it back in, similar to waves, again and again until he entered into a blank world. A world where nothing existed.Talented as the witch was, it took her more than two years to reach this level. Plus another year to augment her spirit until it was strong enough to sense the surrounding magic elements as a junior apprentice\u201d.However, after becoming a junior apprentice, it would still take quite a while before one could move forward and become a real sorcerer or sorceress. An apprentice needed to keep forging his or her spirit by doing meditation, to only then be able to analyze and build different magic structures.Having started meditating when she was ten, the witch became an apprentice at the age of thirteen. A year later she became an intermediate apprentice and was really satisfied with her progress. But then, since she was not good at analyzing the patterns of magic and building their structures, she could not progress any further. So she tried to use a precious magic potion called \u201cMagic Gate\u201d to break through the bottleneck.Lucien felt both disappointed and excited. From the witch\u2019s note Lucien understood that learning magic did take time, so unfortunately there was no way for him to take revenge on the gangsters within a short period. Actually, as Victor\u2019s music student, Lucien was now in no hurry to protect himself with magic, since a mistake could affect his teacher\u2019s social status. At the same time, it was exciting because Lucien was unexpectedly great at the meditation. After the bitter fight underground, Lucien\u2019s spiritual power was improved by a great extent. It only took him less than thirty seconds to successfully enter into the meditation world! Observant as he was now, Lucien was guessing he could probably shorten the time for becoming a junior apprentice remarkably, doing so probably in months or even weeks!Actually, it was even faster than he thought.The meditation world was very different. Lucien could feel all sorts of power here: some of them were steady, some restless, others were dynamic, and there were even gentle ones, among others\u2026\u201cThey are\u2026 earth, fire, wind and water\u2026 the four elements? My spiritual power has reached the level of a junior apprentice?!\u201d Lucien was so surprised that he almost failed to maintain his meditation. \u201cThe badge really helped me a lot!\u201dHe became truly happy. Soon he would start learning his first magic!\u201cI wonder\u2026 why do the four basic elements feel more like\u2026 forces\u2026\u201d When Lucien was about to follow the basic Element Meditation mentioned in Astrology and Magic Elements, a question came to him. Then he noticed the similarity with the question raised by Douglas. \u201cMaybe\u2026 they are actually the four fundamental forces \u2014 gravity, weak nuclear force, electromagnetism and strong nuclear force \u2014 in the universe? \u201d\u201cBut then gravity would definitely be related to the earth element, while the other three are in fact different manifestations from the other forces, according to what I learned in my world\u2026\u201dAs soon as the idea came up, Lucien noticed that the world around him changed: A starry sky showed up and the stars were shining brightly against the dark background. Every star had an invisible string of force hanging down to the earth. Attracting those countless strings, the earth, gentle and profound, was like a silent giant grabbing mysterious ropes in its hand.On the other hand, the remaining three elements \u2014 fire, wind and water \u2014 showed no such change, since Lucien could not figure out the corresponding connections between them and the other three forces yet. However, the previous clear boundaries between them were seemingly blurred now.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe world\u2026 changes with my cognition?\u201d Lucien was guessing that the sky appeared because he happened to understand the connection between gravity and the Earth Element. He suddenly recalled an excerpt from the witch\u2019s notes: \u201cStars \u2014 It was a way of meditation belonging to another school for advanced apprentices.\u201dAs the note mentioned before, there were eight schools in the world of magic, and each of them had its own way of meditation. The witch just had a brief description in the note about the Astrology School because it was the Element School she majored in. However, as the fundamental way of meditation for the Astrology School, the first time an apprentice entered into his or her meditation world it would allow them to see one\u2019s own night sky, from which he or she could choose a \u201cHost Star of Destiny\u201d by themselves. The star could be connected with the person, which would provide great help in the person\u2019s future learning. More importantly, without a Host Star, magic belonging to Astrology, like Horoscope, could not be obtained.That school believed that every soul matched a star in the boundless sky. One\u2019s destiny kept changing along with his or her Host Star. The sorcerer would not be able to see the strings of destiny without a connection, and thus could not cast a Horoscope.Therefore, even the basic meditation of Astrology School required an advanced apprentice\u2019s spirit level. Before achieving that requirement an apprentice was supposed to refer to other ways of meditation to improve their power until they became qualified.\u201cIn this world, gravity has something to do with destiny? Interesting\u2026\u201d Lucien thought to himself. \u201cIt seems like many things happening here do not comply with my previous knowledge\u2026 Or maybe I just cannot understand it fully.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The star was not very bright, seeming like a newborn one.Extending his spirit, Lucien approached the star. Under the guidance of meditation, little by little, Lucien started connecting his spirit with the star.Suddenly, like a string being plucked, Lucien\u2019s soul shook and started vibrating fiercely. Knowing it was the hardest but also the most important part in the process, Lucien quickly reached out his spirit again to grab the almost broken string between the star and himself.Gradually, the thin string started shining bright as the stars, and gradually grew stronger. The vibrating slowly disappeared. With a last sudden vibration in the end, an image of the star showed up in his soul.Drawing the power from the star greedily, Lucien continued tempering his soul and spirit until his soul felt 'swollen\u201d. Then he switched to element meditation to improve the interaction and strengthen the bond between his spirit and the elements. The stronger the bond was, the faster one could cast the element-specific spells and shorten the cooldown (CD) in general.Lucien finally opened his eyes when he started feeling extremely tired deep in his soul. They were full of excitement and ecstasy.\u201cEven when I\u2019m not practicing meditation, I can still feel my Host Star in my soul. And if I focus more, I can even feel that there\u2019s a star shining afar in the sky that is connected with me. I can feel the power of the star\u2026\u201dBut soon he felt confused, \u201cWait\u2026 I came here by mistake. I don\u2019t belong to this world, so why would I find my Host Star of Destiny here? Theoretically speaking, if someone dies, that person\u2019s star would gradually dim until it finally disappeared. But the star I felt just now\u2026 It belongs to me, the real me\u2026Xiafeng.\u201dLucien could not figure it out at the moment.Also, from the notes, Lucien learned that a sorcerer or sorceress needed to use specific magic to measure other people\u2019s spiritual power. Only those who just broke through to a new level could be detected in a direct way, without using any magic, due to the instability of their power.Of course, magic that could hide one\u2019s power existed.After taking a very short break, Lucien opened the notes with great excitement. He couldn\u2019t wait any longer to see what magic spells were waiting for him.Since he now had the Host Star of Destiny, Lucien could master all three apprentice spells in the School of Astrology, which were relatively powerful among those of similar level from other schools. But for now, Lucien\u2019s power was only enough to cast the spells two to three times before his spirit was exhausted.Different levels of apprentice were accessed depending on how many spells an apprentice could cast before exhausting his spirit. An apprentice in training could cast up to five spells, while and intermediate doubled that number, and an advanced doubled it again to cast no less than twenty spells before running out of power. That was to say that, for now, Lucien could only use up to five spells of apprentice level consecutively. As for the Astrology magic, probably only three. When feeling exhausted, one needed to rest or take magic potions to help his or her power to fill up again.The three spells of apprentice level were: Horoscope (basic-level), Eyes of Stars, and Disarming Loop.Among them, Horoscope was the best-known one. Even the basic level required lots of knowledge to understand the movement of stars and tell the precise moment to tell the fortune. It took the witch several years to barely understand some of them, but her predictions were often inaccurate.While for Lucien, the most challenging part was to find a crystal ball made of pure and precious Morning-light Crystal. He had no idea where to find one. The witch\u2019s crystal ball came from her family, but it was taken away by the church.As for the astrology-related basic knowledge, which the witch found very complex, Lucien realized it was basically just celestial mechanics of high-school level, but it was described in a messy way.However, Lucien could not explain with his current knowledge why a star would have something to do with a person\u2019s fate.Picturing himself in the future sitting in front of a crystal ball and casting spells, Lucien felt thrilled. If he wore a black sorcerer\u2019s robe, Lucien had the impression he would look more like an evil wizard.\u201cEyes of Stars\u201d: An hypnotism magic. The caster needed to have the person staring at his eyes.\u201cDisarming Loop\u201d: Lucien\u2019s understanding was that the magic could use the gravity from the stars and build an about twenty-centimetre thick loop, in which the gravity could be controlled. It was a magic mainly used for defence.Lucien decided to start by protecting himself \u3161 he would learn Disarming Loop.Besides, the other spells all required other materials. For example, Eyes of Stars needed Night Star (a type of herb) as its reagent. And almost all the Element-specific spells had similar requirements.Although Lucien could also learn magic from other schools, his meditation technique would make it easier for him to start with Astrology and Element.Keeping himself focused, Lucien cast the strange spell in a low voice, trying to search for the power in the hanging string connecting the star with his own Host Star. He felt his spirit started vibrating with the casting. It was possible to feel the gravity from the star!Hurriedly, Lucien tried to shape his spirit according to the simple magic pattern in the notes. However, before the pattern was created the combination of his spirit and the gravity ceased. Lucien had failed.After five failures, finally his efforts were successful. An almost invisible loop of soft light fell down on the table, surrounding a previously lit candle. Controlled by Lucien, the candle flame was suddenly constrained, and in the next second soared up in the air. After two minutes of practice Lucien stopped.Crossing his fingers, Lucien bit his lip thoughtfully. \u201cI\u2019m not able to create a big difference in gravity. The loop might be barely enough for people to lose control of their weapons to some extent, but not strong enough to disarm them completely. After all, it\u2019s just an apprentice spell.\u201cAnd it takes me too long to cast it. If I practice more, I should be able to create the loop within three seconds.\u201cAnyway, it is my first magic.\u201d Lucien was glad that he could master Disarming Loop in such a short time, while it took the witch more than a month.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe witch explained in the note that the difficulty came from the the fact that she couldn\u2019t understand why would the stars lead to the chaos of the Earth Element, so she had no choice but to practice over and over again without knowing the reason. But I know the reason behind \u3161 gravity. It seems the saying also works here in this world: Knowledge is power.\u201dRecalling the whole process, Lucien tried to reduce the casting time. \u201cI felt the spell just created a certain frequency and then made my spirit start vibrating with it. What if\u2026 I just remember and follow the specific frequency and skip the spell?\u201dThe answer was yes, but it definitely required a spiritual power control of a higher level. After a long time of practice Lucien was exhausted and he had to call it a day, but by then he had reduced the activating time (no casting since there was no spell needed now) to a bit more than three seconds.\u201cI need more practice tomorrow. And\u2026 I\u2019ll try to find some common materials for magic potions\u2026\u201d Lucien\u2019s brain was not working properly due to his sleepiness.Even if a sorcerer or sorceress didn\u2019t aim at being an alchemist, the process of learning from creating magic potions was still very significant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Every one of them was amazing. For example, \u201cBrown Owl\u201d was helpful for restoring energy. The most precious among them were three: \u201cMagic Gate\u201d provided a great boost for those apprentices who found themselves stuck because of certain magic structures; \u201cSilver Moon\u201d was a potion that could help the apprentice during the process of break through; and \u201cCrying Soul\u201d could reveal the power hidden in a developed body, or so to speak, an adult.For now, Crying Soul was the one Lucien was longing for the most.The materials required for Magic Gate and Silver Moon were precious and hard to find. They also demanded a higher level of spiritual power, close to the one a real sorcerer had. Only Crying Soul could be used on any healthy person, becoming a very famous potion back in the days when the ancient sorcerers were trying to have more low-level squires to face moments of crisis. But there was also a side effect: the potion would overdraw one\u2019s strength, causing problems in the future development. If a person became a knight by using Crying Soul, he wouldn\u2019t be as strong as the normally-trained ones in the future, and his final development would be overall inferior.But for Lucien, he never really expected being a knight. It was just a good way for him to become stronger quickly.The problem was that even the materials for Crying Soul were still not that very easy to collect. They were either expensive or very strange. And Lucien was not yet an adult, so the potion might be dangerous for him. The stronger the person was, the greater chance of success for the procedure.Crying Soul belonged to the Necromancy School. Its simplified magic formula was:\u201cCorpse mushroom + Aquatic Zombie brain tissue + Revenant dust + Moonlight Rose dust = Crying Soul Potion\u201dCorpse Mushrooms grew on dead bodies. Before they were ripe, they were white like milk, but then turned black within a day. They could last for one month when they were ripe. Smelling them could lead the person to suffer from light delusion. If someone ate the mushroom they would be infected with diseases from the corpse. The darker the color was, the better the quality the potion would have.It was the same for the other materials: stronger aquatic zombies and revenant with stronger hatred would improve the potion\u2019s effect as well.Moonlight Rose was precious and expensive, costing about a gold Thale per gram (a hundred silver Nars). It shone like the silver moon at night. Also, high-level knight squires would use the Rose to help them awaken the \u201cBlessing\u201d in their blood. One dose would need at least ten grams, if everything went well.The witch once tried to make a Crying Soul potion to become stronger, in order to help on the search for Snow Gorse later. After all, the potion could help a person fight in the same conditions with a level one knight. And there were just about four hundred knights in the whole Duchy.She could not afford the Rose. But the witch mentioned in her notes that there were aquatic zombies along the Belem River at night. She also recorded that the Revenant Dust could be obtained by summoning a low-level Revenant using the blood of evil creatures, which was also an apprentice-level necromancy spell.Lucien had no better options available. The only thing he could do now was keep practicing and strengthening his spiritual power, while at the same time trying to find these materials secretly.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Approaching the Month of Fire, the sun rose much earlier than before. The orange-colored clouds were slowly changing as they crossed the sky like blooming flowers.Lucien succeeded in activating Disarming Loop again. He already knew that the spelling was not necessary if he first made his spirit resonate in the same frequency of the spell. However, that method was more energy-consuming. He was disappointed to see that without the spelling, activating the magic even once could drain his spiritual power completely.After doing meditation, Lucien felt invigorated. He tidied his messy place a little bit, leaving no proof of the magic practice, and headed to Auntie Alisa\u2019s house.\u201cMorning, Lucien! Come and join us for breakfast!\u201d Iven opened the door. Recently he was helping his mom in the Textile Association and thus looked more mature now.\u201cSure! I planned my arrival time just to be able to have breakfast.\u201d Lucien smiled.\u201cYou\u2019re playing the funny now, little Evans!\u201d Joel was having the veggie soup with dark bread. He was happy to see Lucien\u2019s growth, \u201cYou seem more confident now.\u201dEvery Sunday morning, those faithful ones among the citizens would go to the Saint Truth Church. Lucien did not want to go with them because was too afraid of being found out, so he always sought different excuses not to join them.\u201cHave some hot soup, little Evans.\u201d Auntie Alisa scooped a bowl of hot soup and handed it over to Lucien.Lucien was starving from his previous meditation and casting. Sipping the hot soup with dark bread, Lucien felt much better.The dark bread here was still not tasty. Lucien could taste some wheat bran mixed in the bread, and it was much better than what he had at home. His bread tasted like pure wood.\u201cUncle Joel, I got something else to do tomorrow. Sorry, but I can\u2019t go with you to the church.\u201d Despite the risk, Lucien also had no time to waste with that.\u201cDon\u2019t you have to work in the market tomorrow?\u201d Auntie Alisa asked.Lucien pulled out the old purse and gave it back to Joel. He smiled and answered, \u201cI\u2019m Mr.Victor\u2019s admitted student now. I\u2019m going to study music under Mr. Victor.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Lucien paused a bit, \u201che will teach me for free.\u201d\u201cWhat!?\u201d Joel almost choked on the bread. His face turned red from coughing. \u201cHe allowed you to learn music there? You just wanted to learn how to read, like\u2026 like a week ago!\u201dClearly Alisa had a different focus.\u201cFor free? Really for free?\u201dIven gasped in great admiration. \u201cLucien, what did you do?\u201dLucien told them the full story. \u201cI\u2019m pretty lucky to have this opportunity. I\u2019m gonna visit Mr. Victor tomorrow morning and borrow some related books.\u201dIn fact Lucien was going to study at Victor\u2019s place this afternoon to make up for lesson they had missed. But it was also a very good excuse for him to be absent from the church again. And he was going to visit Mr. Victor tomorrow morning again to collect more books in his spirit library.Being a musician was a perfect cover for Lucien. He had to take it seriously.\u201cOh, Mr. Victor! What a generous, nice and talented gentleman!\u201d Alisa was touched, again. \u201cThanks God! God bless you, little Evans! After so many difficulties, your beautiful new life has finally come!\u201dJoel stared at Lucien for a while with complicated emotions. Finally he started patting on Lucien\u2019s shoulder with great joy. His voice was trembling, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky, yes. But you\u2019re also smart, diligent and gifted. Mr. Victor is an awesome teacher and I\u2019m sure you can accomplish big achievements in the future. Do your best, little Evans. If you manage to have a chance to play in the Psalm Hall, let me be there to watch you, then I will have no regrets in music in my life.\u201dOn the opposite side of the table, Iven was nodding as well. \u201cThen I can tell my friends that I have two elder brothers, one is a knight and the other is a great musician! Cool!\u201d\u201cOf course, uncle Joel, I\u2019ll work hard.\u201d Lucien nodded seriously but sighed in his heart.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe felt sorry that he wouldn\u2019t be able to put lots of energy and time in music. Last night Lucien had been drawn into the amazing magic world. For him, being a musician was just a camouflage and a way of making money for learning magic. Joel loved music deep within his heart, but Lucien did not.He did not know much about music here, but from his experience many songs he heard before were very beautiful, and some of them shared the same features with the classical masterpieces on Earth.Putting the purse back, Joel reminded Lucien. \u201cWhen you decide what instrument you\u2019d like to start with, don\u2019t be shy and come here to ask for help.\u201d\u201cSure. Thank you so much, uncle Joel, auntie Alisa. I\u2019m planning to find a new job as well, but not in the market. I\u2019m Mr. Victor\u2019s student now, so I hope it\u2019ll be a bit easier.\u201d Finished the breakfast, it was time for Lucien to leave.After reading the magic notes, Lucien knew that learning magic was very expensive. He had to hurry up and make money!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, he went back home for his wood stick and started practicing basic fighting skills as usual. Since Lucien\u2019s spirit was not strong enough, being physically strong was also very important.Besides, the stronger the person was, the more likely they would successfully get improved by the Crying Soul Potion.An hour later, in the market.It had been five days since Lucien came here last time. The market area was busy as usual. Human and other kinds of humanoid creatures were walking around and bargaining. The assorted shops and stores were like colourful mushrooms in the woods.Lucien was very careful when he was walking on the streets. The gangsters would probably take revenge on him. But Lucien was pretty sure that with his good perception he would notice if anyone tried to attack him.However, until he finished buying the materials and was ready to leave, not even a single gangster came to bother him. In fact, the gangsters on the street were in much smaller numbers than usual. They were often in groups of two or three, but today most of them were hanging around alone. Lucien was pretty confused.No matter what happened, Lucien still had to be careful and try to master all the apprentice spells as soon as possible. Although these spells were not very powerful, Lucien believed that they were already enough for dealing with a bunch of gangsters holding daggers.It took Lucien more than three hours just to buy three of these materials. Worrying that his shopping might bring any suspiciousness, he was very cautious and decided not to buy anything that was not used for common tasks.He bought some sulphur, which was very useful for disinfestation in the Month of Fire; nightstar, a type of plant that could promote sleep quality; and icestone, that could be used for keeping stuff fresh.For the materials that could be found outside of the city, Lucien definitely wouldn\u2019t buy them.The shopping cost Lucien a Nar and twenty Fells, which represented half of his savings, but what he bought was only enough for about a hundred experiments. Among them, the most expensive one was nightstar, followed by icestone, but sulphur was the cheapest, as expected.Lucien sighed, \u201cI\u2019d better be careful with these experiments\u2026 I really can\u2019t afford to waste any material.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Spells like Acid Splash and Freezing Rays would definitely mess Lucien\u2019s place. And he was afraid that someone would notice it during daytime. So he decided to find a new place for practicing, the sewers.At two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Lucien started his study on time at Victor\u2019s house.An hour later, the class was over. After Renee, Colin and Annie left, Victor asked in a gentle voice.\u201cLucien, do you have a job now?\u201dThere were only four students left in the living room \u2013 Lott, Felicia, Herodotus and Lucien.Shaking his head, Lucien answered with slight depression.\u201cNo, sir\u2026 I lost my job for some reason. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m still looking for a new one.\u201dIt was kind of embarrassing for Lucien to admit, but he was also a bit excited. Did Mr. Victor have a job offer?\u201cStudying here from two to six in the afternoon everyday can be quite demanding for you. I know you gotta support yourself. Even if you can study here for free, I guess you\u2019re still facing a pretty big challenge with your living expenses.\u201d Victor tried to be careful with his words to avoid undermining Lucien\u2019s self-esteem. He asked Colin and Renee before, so he knew that a poor guy like Lucien had to work at least ten hours a day to barely support himself.\u201cI know a relatively easy job. You work four hours every morning and you get ten Nars every month. What do you think?\u201dLucien felt so touched facing this kind offer. Although he had been through many difficulties and bad things before, Lucien felt he was so lucky to have many kind people helping him like uncle Joel, untie Alisa and Mr. Victor.\u201cYes\u2026 Sure. That\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what kind of work it is.\u201d Victor smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s a job in the association library. They are short of hands now. Another good thing is that when you work there, you can have access to many music or theory-related books. I think it\u2019ll be pretty helpful.\u201dNot being sure of Lucien\u2019s music talent, Victor wanted him to be a basic-level musician first to support himself. Then Lucien could advance forward to the next step if he was really born for this.That was another surprise for Lucien. He never thought he could have a chance working in a library. He was so excited and happy that the only thing he could do was say \u201cthank you\u201d to Victor many times.Victor was the only reason why Lucien could get this job. People in the association knew that this job was mainly for Mr. Victor\u2019s student. Lucien was working like a dog all day long for just three Nars a month. Now Lucien could work for a salary similar to what a common citizen could earn every month. That was another reason why so many people wanted to be Mr. Victor\u2019s music students.\u201cGreat!\u201d Victor clapped his hands with joy, \u201cThis afternoon, I\u2019m gonna take Lott, Felicia and Herodotus to the association for rehearsal. You can come with us together and sign the contract, then you can start working tomorrow.\u201dWhen Victor went back upstairs to find some of his music work, Lott came and smiled to Lucien.\u201cHi, Lucien. I\u2019m Lott, Lott Griffith. We haven\u2019t really talked to each other before. I\u2019m here to say that Mr. Victor is a very, very nice teacher and a very kind man as well. I hope you won\u2019t let him down as his music student.\u201dLott was pretty unhappy with this newcomer suddenly becoming one of Mr. Victor\u2019s music students. In his eyes, there was definitely no position in the world of musician for a poor, uneducated and ignorant boy like Lucien. As a noble from the Griffith family, he felt ashamed of studying with the poor.But from Mr. Victor\u2019s words, Lott found out that Victor was expecting Lucien to be a common musician first, not really a music master. Therefore his anger and dissatisfaction turned into noble\u2019s arrogance and pride, looking down upon the poor and miserable guy standing in front of him.\u201cMr. Victor must be happy so I\u2019m willing to accept him.\u201d Lott thought to himself. He always tried to give a good impression to Victor, in order to become his most outstanding student.Lucien was not very interested in Lott\u2019s intention, because he knew that he had a different path to go \u2013 magic. He just replied politely, \u201cI won\u2019t. Thank you, Lott. I\u2019m Lucien Evans.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Felicia Hayne.\u201d Politely but also coldly, the red-haired girl nodded to Lucien. She didn\u2019t believe Lucien would achieve something in music. Besides, she couldn\u2019t allow herself to get too close to a poor guy. It was bad for her reputation.And Herodotus, who always disliked Lucien, also did just a simple self-introduction like Felicia.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The hall of the Musicians\u2019 Association.Stepping on the thick and soft carpet, Lucien was following Mr. Victor to the reception counter, while the other students were practicing upstairs.\u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Victor.\u201d The cute girl, Elena, slightly bowed and greeted him.\u201cGood afternoon, Elena.\u201d Victor was always kind to everyone, \u201cThis is Lucien, my new music student. From tomorrow on he will be working in the library. Can you kindly help him sign the contract and hand it to Mr. Hank later?\u201dShe nodded and took out the already prepared contract and a quill. When she was passing Lucien the contract, her green eyes were opened with surprise.\u201cLucien! It\u2019s you! No wonder I just thought it was a familiar name!\u201dShe couldn\u2019t believe her own eyes. About more than a week ago, Lucien, the guy from the slum, was rummaging through trash from the association. Today he was standing here as Mr. Victor\u2019s music student! What a crazy world!\u201cHi, Elena. Nice to see you again.\u201d Lucien took the contract and started reading it. Still not very good at reading, it took him quite a while to understand the few lines on the paper, during which Elena finally calmed down and was staring at Lucien with great curiosity.\u201cYou can do fingerprint or sign here, either way is fine.\u201d She smiled, \u201cYou changed so much since last time I saw you.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou know Lucien?\u201d Victor asked.\u201cYou were there at that time as well, Mr. Victor\u2026\u201d Elena started explaining to him. Lucien finished reading and wrote down his name slowly.\u201cI see\u2026No wonder I feel I\u2019ve seen you before somewhere. You\u2019re always diligent, Lucien. You\u2019ll be successful if you keep working hard in music.\u201d\u201cSucceed in music? Victor, are you prepared for the concert?\u201d A sharp voice came from behind them.It was Wolf, the brown-haired musician with a protruding jaw. Lucien still remembered him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After a fierce competition, Victor and Wolf were the last two competitors remaining. In Victor\u2019s opinion, Wolf lost the chance in the end because he spent too much time on criticizing other musician\u2019s work instead of investing more energy in studying music itself.\u201cI do think so, Wolf. Actually I\u2019m pretty happy with my new work. Do you want to give me some suggestion on it?\u201d Victor had registered his new piano concerto at the association. There was no chance for Wolf to try to plagiarize it.Wolf thought Victor was still very frustrated with his work. Now Victor\u2019s confidence was something beyond his expectation. Wolf\u2019s face turned ashen and he murmured,\u201cNot really, Victor. I\u2019d rather keep my curiosity. We\u2019ll see it in three months.\u201dShrugging his shoulders, Victor smiled, \u201cAll right. I was quite looking forward to your opinion.\u201dWolf just wanted to get rid of this topic, and he saw Lucien was standing aside in his cheap and old linen clothes. Raising his chin, he asked in contempt, \u201cWhen did you become friends with people from the slum?\u201dThat behavior came from a long time ago when Wolf\u2019s family still ranked among nobles. From his great-grandfather on, Wolf\u2019s family lost the title, but it did not prevent him from regarding himself as a noble. He looked down upon the musicians like Victor who came from common families, not to mention poor people like Lucien. His arrogance was mixed with the hatred towards Victor, so in his eyes Lucien was comparable to a disgusting mouse jumping onto his dinner table.Lucien was a bit angry, but he was already used to this kind of contempt. As long as there was social status and wealth in a world, people would be divided into different levels \u2013 the superior and the inferior, the decent and the filthy\u2026The only way for a person to change the situation was striving for power and wealth. But once someone succeeded, they would often join the group and become one among the ones who looked down upon the common folk.\u201cMind your words, Wolf.\u201d Frowning his eyebrows, Victor warned him seriously, \u201cLucien\u2019s my new music student. He\u2019s a\u2026 a very talented young lad.\u201d Honestly speaking, Victor boasted about Lucien\u2019s ability. He was not sure about Lucien\u2019s music gift yet.\u201cAre you serious, Victor? Really?\u201d Wolf started laughing so hard that he almost lost his footing, \u201cYou got that nervous with your performance and lost your mind?\u201dLacking a bit of confidence, Victor tried to fight back.\u201cAalto is the City of Psalm, the City of Music, everyone here can have a chance at learning music. Many outstanding bards are of poor background. The talent of music is a gift from God, and God doesn\u2019t only bless the wealthy and the noble.\u201dWolf shook his head while he was still laughing, \u201cCome on, Victor! Both you and I know that a talent can easily awaken the Blessing in their blood. We call people like Princess Natasha and Lord Verdi talents, but your student\u2026 Get real!\u201cIf he manage to become an outstanding musician in the future, I will do an open apology to you and your student on Music Criticism, and never hold my own concert again.\u201dWolf made the bet on impulse, but he was pretty cautious as well. He added the word \u201coutstanding\u201d on purpose since it was really hard to reach a consensus on what really made an outstanding artist.Lucien heard that Princess Natasha, also known as the Violet Countess, was the only child of the Grand Duke of Orvarit. And her current title was also one of the prerequisites to become the Grand Duke of the Duchy. She was very gifted in music and had excellent skills in playing violin, flute and harpsichord. Besides, the twenty-five-year-old princess was also an outstanding level five Grand Knight, who was expected to become a Radiant Knight soon.Lord Verdi, the nephew of the Grand Duke and also a member of the Violet family, just became a level five Grand Knight, and was currently serving as the chief commander of the City Guards in Aalto.After making the comment, Wolf directly turned and left the hall.Victor shook his head in repulsion. \u201cLucien, just ignore him. Everyone knows Wolf is a total bastard. Your work starts from tomorrow. One day off a week. You can arrange your day off with the library administrators. I have to go to the odeon now.\u201dLucien nodded and watched Mr. Victor leave the hall. Then he turned to Elena and gave the contract back to her. \u201cThank you, Elena,\u201d he said.There was a sweet little dimple in Elena\u2019s left check. \u201cNo worries, it\u2019s my job. Like Mr. Victor said, never let Mr. Wolf bother you. He\u2019s always like that\u2026 looking down upon most people in the association, except several directors with titles.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing Mr. Wolf\u2019s high-lifted jaw digging a hole into the carpet along with the noble directors.\u201d Lucien shrugged a bit and smiled.Elena started giggling with his words.When Lucien was about to leave, Elena stopped him. Her right hand clenched into a small fist, and her face looked serious.\u201cI believe in you, Lucien! You can be an outstanding musician! Mr. Wolf would deeply regret his bet!\u201dHonestly speaking, Lucien did not take the bet seriously. But he also raised his fist like Elena and replied, \u201cI certainly will.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026There was no nightlife in Aderon. At nine o\u2019clock at night most residents in this area were already in bed, except for several drunkards who were still hanging around. Everybody else had to prepare for the hard work in the following morning.Lucien told Joel and Alisa he got a new job over dinner, and then went back to his shack to meditate and prepare for his magic experiments.Gently closing the door, Lucien sneaked out of his shack and walked towards one of the entrances to the sewers. It would still take Lucien quite some time to learn how to build a secret passage like the witch did.After making sure that no one was watching, Lucien stepped into the underground world.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe stinking smell and the slimy wall were still the same, disgusting and gloomy, but none of that would prevent him from exploring magic. Walking in the pipes, Lucien was mapping in his spirit library and trying to find a proper corner to start his experiments.He also scraped off some of the moss on the wall and put them into his pocket. It was called Light Moss, which was the reagent for the apprentice magic Extinguishment.The deeper Lucien went, the more gruesome the place became. Down there Lucien never met any homeless guy, like Corella mentioned. The sound of his footsteps was intensified within the sewers. Lucien could even hear his own breath.Finally Lucien found his ideal place: a fork path. The front way was blocked by a huge rock, while the one turning left went further into the darkness. Lucien could easily notice if anyone was approaching him from this position.Lucien pinched some sulphur from his pocket while recalling the structure of the magic. Then he started casting a strange spell and the powder slipped through his fingers. His face looked serious and mysterious in the cold light.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Furthermore, now Lucien could activate Disarming Loop without a verbal component in about three seconds.It took the witch much longer to understand all these spells. It was amazing how Lucien could grasp them in such a short period of time. In his eyes these magic structures were related to different mathematical models and the knowledge of planar geometry. After reviewing what he had learned before in high school, Lucien found they were actually pretty easy to be understood.Here magic could be explained by science. In Acid Splashing, for example, sulphur was transformed into sulfuric acid. However, Lucien had a hard time understanding how Darkness worked. His farfetched guess was that the magic reconstructed the Light Moss and made it absorb the light. As expected, Lucien had to spend more time to master the Darkness spell.Lucien reflected on his magic experiment: His knowledge from the past, like physics and chemistry, was useful, but it could not be used to explain everything in this magic world. There were some similarities shared between this place and the earth, but there were also many things he couldn\u2019t understand, like those precious metals and magic materials. He knew he should explore the world more by himself.After a ten-minute break, Lucien started doing some simple cleaning.\u201cThese apprentice spells are not powerful enough.\u201d Rubbing the floor, Lucien thought to himself, \u201cThey can only kill someone when they hit the vital parts, or the most they could do is make the person move slower or suffer a bit.\u201d But Lucien was not disappointed. He knew that, if need arose, they could still be more than helpful.Finishing the cleaning, Lucien carefully hid the materials nearby. He didn\u2019t go back to the surface directly but continued his exploration towards the end of the outlets. He was looking for Corpse Mushroom, which meant he had to find some carcasses first. Searching in a graveyard under the nose of the church was too risky. Lucien heard that many poor people, who had no families or friends, died lonely and miserably down there. Besides, dead animals and rotten flesh were even easier to be found.The witch did not mention any possible danger in the pipes, but Lucien was still very cautious, staying alert to any sign of trouble.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Within twenty minutes, Lucien had found two dead rats and a jelly-like creature body, but no Corpse Mushroom was there.Turning around a corner, an open area appeared in front of Lucien. That was where the homeless people lived.The sewer here was very broad. An underground river was flowing slowly with waste floating in the middle, which went all the way to the Belem River. On both sides of the river old dirty rugs and pots were scattered everywhere. The clothes the beggars were wearing could barely cover their bodies.\u201cWhy did you come here, young lad? You don\u2019t belong here.\u201d An old man probably in his sixties asked Lucien. His ribs stood out like arching blades. However, when Lucien heard his voice, the old man sounded like he was only forty or something.Lucien\u2019s old but clean linen clothes were far from decent, but compared to what they were wearing, the youngster looked like a noble.\u201cI have a friend who also lives here.\u201d Lucien tried to sound confident and strong. He must hide his feeling of insecurity in front of these guys, or they would think it was easy to prey on the teen standing there.Several beggars behind the old man stood up. Their eyes were full of greed and ferocity. Lucien was not scared. Instead, he pulled out his dagger and took a step forward.The beggars did not dare take any further action. On the contrary, they were now standing in a defensive position.At this time, the old man started grinning. \u201cYou don\u2019t look like a guy with a decent job, young lad.\u201d\u201cNone of your business.\u201d Lucien answered coldly.\u201cAnyway, I can tell you\u2019re not doing very well. Even a hard-working young lad like you couldn\u2019t afford proper bread and beef. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201dLucien was not sure about the old man\u2019s intention.\u201cThe Saint Truth Church tells people that all of us are God\u2019s servants. But why can the noble live an extravagant life while the poor have to suffer every day and night. There\u2019s no difference between us, and all human beings are born with sin!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in your nonsense.\u201d Although his words were pretty obscure, Lucien knew the old man was trying to preach, but obviously not the Saint Truth. No matter what the old man believed in, other Gods or demons, Lucien had no interest in it. The price for having something to do with a heresy in this world could be his own life.He did not want to end up being tied to a stake and burned to ashes alive.Facing such direct rejection, the old man and the other beggars were very angry. Their belief was blasphemed.Lucien knew it was time to get away from those guys. He started walking towards the outlets slowly and calmly, grabbing his shiny dagger in his hand.\u201cAnyone wanna try me?\u201d Lucien stared at them fearlessly.When he walked by, Lucien noticed that there was a clean black cloth lying on the ground, on which there was a shiny silver-colored horn. He remembered these beggars were sitting around the cloth when he arrived here.The beggars were hesitant. No one wanted to fall on Lucien. Finally they gave up and sat back on the ground.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After walking for another ten minutes, the sound of the river flow gradually became louder.\u201cHere should be the end of the sewers. The underground river joins the Belem River here,\u201d Lucien thought to himself. There was a iron net covering the water outlet at the confluence and tons of floating trash accumulated in front of the net.Lucien slowed down his pace. He was hoping that he could find more dead bodies here.Lucien did not find anything until he walked towards the end of the sewer. When he started feeling disappointed and was about to go back to the surface, Lucien suddenly noticed that the net was missing a part, under the water.Out of curiosity, Lucien grabbed the net and tried to shake it. As expected, there was a big hole under there on the iron net. What was really unexpected was that, at this time, a black bulk of something gradually surfaced from the water.Lucien moved closer. It was a dead body, swollen and rotten. Many parts of its skin had fallen off. The clothes on the body were tangled with lots of trash, which increased the buoyancy a lot.Lucien felt very disgusted and also a bit scared. However, he was still trying to see if there was any Corpse Mushroom on it.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was a long wound on its chest. Someone cut the poor man open vertically and took away his heart. Checking with the dagger, Lucien\u2019s eyebrows frowned.\u201cWait\u2026This is\u2026my purse?!\u201d Lucien was shocked. He picked the purse up using the dagger and was certain that it was the purse which was taken away by the gangsters some days ago.\u201cWhy is it here\u2026\u201d Lucien was confused.Then he looked at the face of the dead body. The corpse was so badly decomposed that it took Lucien quite a while to finally recognize the guy.\u201cAn\u2026Andre?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A face on which Lucien could still tell his great fear and pain before he died.\u201cThe gangsters under Aaron are acting weird recently\u2026Does it have anything to do with Andre\u2019s death?\u201d Lucien had absolutely no clue.Wrapping his hand with a piece of cloth, Lucien pressed Andre\u2019s body hard back into the water. This time the body did not hook on the iron net. It was washed away directly into the Belem River and disappeared.Lucien stood up and set off for the surface, but to avoid the beggars, he did not take the same route. According to the map he drew in his spirit library, he took another direction about twenty meters away from the place where the beggars gathered. If the map was correct, Lucien would pass by the ruins of the witch\u2019s chamber and come back to the ground from the same entrance through which he came down earlier.Several meters away from the corner, Lucien heard the sound of some heavy footsteps and suddenly stopped. The footsteps echoed in the sewers, loud and clear. It sounded like there were a bunch of people approaching, and some of them must be pretty big.Lucien looked around calmly. Soon he found there was a hole in the wall, big enough for someone to hide. Lucien hid himself in the hole, with his back against the wall.A while later, those guys walked directly past him, turning around a corner a few steps ahead. In such a dark place, they would not notice Lucien hiding a in the hole without a careful check.\u201cThrow these bodies into the river. Hurry up.\u201d It was a low voice from a man. However, he was speaking indistinctly, as if he missed some front teeth.Lucien felt he had heard this voice somewhere before, but could not remember where.\u201cWhy did it take you guys so long. Remember, don\u2019t screw up the whole plan.\u201d It was the old man\u2019s voice.After a few seconds of silence, the first man answered with slight fear.\u201cSorry\u2026 But within ten days, we promise it will be enough\u2026 at any cost, like Aaron said.\u201dAaron\u2026 Rosan Aaron?Now Lucien finally recognized the first voice. It was Jackson, the guy who smashed Lucien\u2019s shack, and also because of Lucien, Jackson could not even speak clearly now.From their conversations, Lucien\u2019s guess was that the Aaron gang was by no means a victim of the heresy, but an accomplice, and probably Andre was killed because of his disobedience.The old man\u2019s voice was very unpleasant. \u201cPlease tell Mr. Aaron\u2026 and the other guy, that as long as you continuously spare no efforts in helping us grow, you will all receive huge rewards. I know that, in your eyes, I\u2019m only a dying, useless old man, which is true, but we are just tiny worms on the ground. Our priests are already powerful enough to beat their bishop. We wouldn\u2019t need any of your help were it not for maintaining that\u2026 thing.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Jackson answered in a low mood.\u201cBut\u2026 Jackson, I don\u2019t think we can meet their requirement\u2026\u201d Another voice came, trembling, \u201cWe gotta make sure that those are people that no one would care about. Homeless guys are ideal, but we cannot find any of them down here, other than his people\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, Jackson. It\u2019s too difficult to find fifty of them within ten days.\u201d Someone else agreed.The old man laughed, \u201cThe rest of them are at the bottom of the Belem River. Eels in the river will clean them up for us.\u201d\u201cSkar, Aaron told us to make it at any cost. We don\u2019t necessarily have to focus on homeless guys. If they are just the poor\u2026 Aaron will be able to handle this.\u201d A cold smile appeared on Jackson\u2019s face.\u201cYou have any target already, Jackson?\u201d Skar was a bit surprised.\u201cYes, I do.\u201d Jackson\u2019s face turned hideous, \u201cThey gotta pay the price\u2026 the two little bastards, and their families.\u201dLucien was shocked. His anger was burning his guts. He knew Jackson hated them, but he never expected that the thug could be so cruel and inhuman to the point of planning to kill the whole family!But thank God Lucien was here and found out about Jackson\u2019s plan.\u201cI gotta solve the problem here and now.\u201d The plan of killing them all in the sewers arose in Lucien\u2019s mind. He couldn\u2019t let them go back onto the ground, or he would not be able to protect John\u2019s family anymore.Lucien must kill them all. Then Lucien could tell John about the heresy and no one would know what happened down here.Many thoughts quickly passed through his mind. Lucien\u2019s reached out to his pocket and made sure that all the magic materials were in position. Carefully, he creeped out of the hole and approached the corner.They had nine people there. But Lucien had no choice. Staying calm was his most important and powerful weapon.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Throwing the last sack into the water, Skar poked the body bag with a long pole in fear. Although they were gangsters, gouging out people\u2019s hearts alive was still too much for them, and they also believed in the God of Truth. So they prayed in their mind, begging for forgiveness.\u201cJackson, all of the bags are gone.\u201d Glancing at the weird old man, Skar carefully asked, \u201cWe\u2019d better go now\u2026 I heard there are lot of aquatic zombies in the Belem River.\u201dJackson turned to the old man, \u201cDoes it have anything to do with the bodies we threw away? I\u2019ve never heard of zombies in the river before.\u201dThe old man shook his head, \u201cWe don\u2019t want any trouble while we\u2019re not strong enough. Aalto was the core city of the previous magic empire. Maybe some kind of death power was sealed deep within the river, and now the seal is no longer effective.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d When Jackson was about to leave with his men, he saw Scar\u2019s terrified face. At the same time, Jackson heard a weird, low voice murmuring in the back, like a spell\u2026Twenty meters away from them, there was a dark humanoid shadow standing there. Half of his body and face were hidden in the darkness. In the shimmer of the moss, the mysterious shadow was even more strange and terrifying.\u201cGh\u2026 Ghost!\u201d Skar screamed at the top of his lungs. Since he was involved in this, his conscience was tortured by the fear that the people they killed would come back and seek revenge. When he closed his eyes, the warm and bloody hearts that they took from those people\u2019s chests when they were still alive were still beating in his mind.Great fear seized him. Skar now could not even move at all.The ghost raised his right hand, and some shimmering powder fell through its fingers. Jackson and the old man started running as soon as they saw the ghost, but all of a sudden they were devoured by complete darkness.The glimmer from the moss disappeared. The darkness spread quickly like a bottle of spilled ink and no light could penetrate it.They couldn\u2019t see anything. Except for the old man, the rest of them were crazily wielding their daggers, trying to keep the bloody ghost away.The pipe was narrow. They hurt each other by accident and some of them started screaming in pain. But fear and panic did not help them at all.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDarkness, an apprentice spell. It could block all kinds of natural light in an area no larger than 6 by 6 meters, enveloping everything in complete darkness.. For now, as an apprentice, Lucien could maintain the spell for one minute.\u201cYou idiots! Calm down! Stop!\u201d Although he could not cast a single spell, the old man heard the priests mentioning about different kinds of magic before.\u201c\u2026Ouch!\u201d However, before the old man made that command, Jackson\u2019s dagger scratched him.Within little more than ten seconds, two guys got stabbed by the chaotic attacks of daggers and fell on the ground. The others were also injured to some extent. Driven by the horrible fear, Skar and other three guys started running backwards. In the darkness, two of them fell into the river like the body bags, while the old man, Jackson, another thug started rushing towards the shadow.At this time, the weird spellcasting voice arose again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, his eyes were no longer accustomed to the weak light from the moss.It was just a blink. When he opened his eyes again, some kind of pungent, dark green liquid hit his face directly.\u201cOw!!\u201d The shrill cry from the old man scared the rest of them. Jackson looked back subconsciously, even though he could not see anything.With both hands covering his eyes, the old man was rolling on the ground in horrible pain. The skin of his face burned and turned black instantly. His scream was so bitter that Jackson and the rest of them shuddered with fear. Several second later, the old man fell into the river and the scream disappeared.Jackson knew there was no way to escape. They would either kill the shadow, or be killed by it.Their only hope was to fight it!\u201cRun! Run close to that fucking thing!\u201d Jackson yelled and dashed to the shadow.Then he saw it was Lucien!Jackson was furious. Hatred replaced his fear and the only thing in his mind was to tear the fucking bastard up into thousands of pieces.When he was about to throw his dagger towards Lucien, he saw a blue beam of light in Lucien\u2019s hand. Jackson hurriedly dodged to the left and barely avoided it.Unfortunately for them, the other thug following behind him was not that lucky. The light beam hit directly in his face and a thin layer of ice quickly filmed his eyes, nose and mouth. Freezing cold invaded the guy\u2019s brain and made him lose most of his power before he could smash the ice.The guy was choked. Then he banged his head fiercely on the ground.At this time Jackson finally realized that the person standing in front of him was no more that weak poor guy. However, he became a wizard, an evil wizard with terrible power!Jackson was not an idiot. He understood that by no means Lucien would let him go. Grabbing his dagger, he leaped at Lucien\u2019s throat with all his strength.Suddenly, Jackson felt a heavy pressure fell on him and then his legs caved. Then his body fell down directly onto the ground.\u201cFuck!\u201d Jackson swore desperately. He did not know what was going on there, but he knew that losing his footing at this point would be fatal.Longer before Lucien cast Acid Splash, he had already activated his defensive magic \u2014 Disarming Loop, without saying a word.Lucien walked towards Jackson, looking at him wielding his dagger in vain. Without saying anything, Lucien grabbed Jackson\u2019s hand and slowly pushed the dagger into his neck.The gravity affected the blood and it didn\u2019t squirt out from his neck too much. It was ideal because Lucien did not want any of Jackson\u2019s dirty blood on his clothes.Jackson\u2019s great anger and pain were choked in his throat. His eyes were wide open and his eyeballs almost burst out, while his arms and legs were twitching against the wall. Jackson\u2019s nails were scratching on the ground, but soon his resistance was no more.The other guy did not take Lucien much time as well.Standing beside the underground sewage river, Lucien saw the old man\u2019s body floating quietly downstream with his face soaking in the water. Lucien felt relieved, because he thought the old man would be the biggest threat among them. Who knew if the old man had some kind of evil power from his heretic belief.All this happened within just twenty seconds. The darkness was still covering the area some distance away. The two injured beggars were still writhing in agony on the ground. Some beggars and gangsters were still floating on the water. But they were too scared to find the broken steel net to escape.Lucien did not want to kill them all by himself, and he was also not able to. His power had a limit. So the easiest way was driving the rest of them into the Belem River and leaving them to the ghosts there.But there was one problem. Lucien also could not see anything in the dark area, so he had to stand there for now, waiting for the magic to expire. At the same time, he was adjusting his respiratory rhythm in order to recover his power.Casting the four spells was very tiring. Lucien\u2019s remaining power was only enough to use either Darkness or Freezing Rays once.Suddenly the light returned within the spell area. The light startled Skar and he couldn\u2019t help but close his eyes. The fear of death scared him to his knees. He trembled and prayed, \u201cMay God forgive me\u2026 May God forgive me\u2026\u201dSlowly opening his eyes, Skar was shocked to find how young the wizard was. In the dim light, the wizard had fine features.Skar had lost his mind and surrendered. He could not tell whether the man standing in front of him was an evil wizard or a hateful ghost.It was a good chance to cast Eyes of Stars on Skar, when he was suffering a mental breakdown. The apprentice magic could mesmerize the enemy or make the person fall into a trance state.The two effects were different: The former, mesmerization, required the caster to look into the other person\u2019s eyes for almost ten minutes, while the latter, trancing, only needed some eye contact, which was more helpful in a fight.If Lucien could take control of Skar, he could use him to kill the rest of them.When Lucien was about to cast the spell, a sudden short scream pierced the silence and echoed in the whole space. Even Lucien felt very strange.As suddenly as the scream of agony started, it stopped.Lucien stopped his spelling and took a step behind his Disarming Loop. His Freezing Rays were ready to go.At this time, both Lucien and Skar saw the horrific scene: In the river, a strong and pale hand was holding tight at a gangster\u2019s neck, whose skull was half opened. A black tongue was licking the white brain inside with some effort.The owner of the tongue was a humanoid monster, whose body was so swollen that its skin appeared almost transparent. Parts of its skin were hanging, showing its rotten flesh beneath. Under the cover of the monster\u2019s seaweed-like long hair, there were facial muscles that could fall off at any time. The place where the eyeballs should be was completely hollow, and there were two tiny white flames burning inside the two eye sockets.Another beggar\u2019s body, whose brain was completely gone already, was floating towards the river through the big hole on the steel net.\u201cThe Great Master of Argent, the forever lasting silence, may you bless your servants\u2026\u201d A beggar sitting next to the wall started praying desperately.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe monster had a frightening power that reeked of doom. Even Lucien was extremely nervous and terrified, although he was quite a distance away from the monster.Aquatic Zombies! These were the monsters in the Belem River! They were zombies!Lucien suddenly recalled the witch\u2019s note, which described the features of the undead creature:\u201cAquatic Zombie: immune to Mind magic; No Morale; Immune to poison, sleep, paralysis, stun, disease effects; No fatigue, exhaustion, breath; Do not feel cold; Strong resistance towards ice and acid; Extremely afraid of Fire and Light magic.\u201dBut what frightened Lucien was that the note did not mention anything about the flames in the Zombie\u2019s eyes. Something was definitely not right.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But unlike most of the undead, these zombies were way faster and swift, while they still carried the features belonging to the undead \u2014 strong resistance to physical damage and other immunities. Therefore, common people and even some knight squires usually did not have any chance to survive when facing these zombies, unless they had a significant advantage in numbers.Since aquatic zombies were extremely afraid of Fire and Light magic, a torch could burn them down if it was used properly. However, this zombie just showed up from the water, which meant its strength and agility would be increased significantly. Fire magic was also not that powerful anymore because of the water. Only Light magic could be helpful under this circumstance.Lucien was absolutely not prepared. Although he knew that he had to confront aquatic zombies some day, it definitely should not be today. The witch mentioned in the note that there was a kind of material called Flame Jelly which could be used for alchemy. A piece of jelly could even burn in water for a while. However, at the moment Lucien mastered no useful Light magic and also had no such jelly. Even worse was that somehow he felt the zombie he was facing was way stronger than the common ones described by the witch.Regarding Light magic, sorcerers could never compete with pastors. Aside from Light Rays in the first circle and on, all Light-related spells of apprentice level were not for attack purpose.Nevertheless, among Element magic Fire magic ranked top mainly because it was hard to be brought under control. The only Fire magic in apprentice magic list was Marius\u2019s Small Fire, which could only be used to kindle firewood when an apprentice forgot his or her flints in the wild.Escape was the first idea in Lucien\u2019s mind. At the same time, the mutant zombie had finished the gangster\u2019s brain and swiftly jumped on one of the beggars. Then Lucien heard a crisp crack in the beggar\u2019s neck. Pressing its fingernails deeply into the skull, the zombie opened the beggar\u2019s head very easily like opening a walnut.Its speed and strength made Lucien stop. After seeing that, he understood that escape simply meant death. There was no other way to survive other than fight back, and for that he needed to calm down.Lucien\u2019s brain quickly started analyzing.\u201cThe zombie\u2019s afraid of light. But it\u2019s very early in the morning and it is still dark outside.\u201cThe zombie won\u2019t give me enough time to light anything with my flints.\u201cMarius\u2019s Small Fire\u2026 No, I don\u2019t know how to cast the spell yet.\u201dLucien was standing there, watching the zombie finishing the brain and then jumping onto Skar. His mind was being occupied by different thoughts and plans, but each of them was denied by him calmly.The ability to stay calm was the most important character of an outstanding sorcerer.Mutant zombies could impose a magical effect called Dread Aura on their targets to freeze them with fear. But Skar\u2019s fear of the zombie was so great that he managed to move his legs and started running for his life.However, only after few steps, the zombie swiftly overtook him and grabbed his feet. Skar squeaked out shrill cries desperately.\u201cDisarming Loop, Eyes of Stars, Mage Hand, Extinguishment, Acid Splash, Freezing Ray\u2026That\u2019s all I know.\u201cAmong them, Eyes of Stars and Extinguishment are of no use here.\u201cDisarming Loop is useful, but it\u2019s far from enough to stop the monster.\u201dLucien was still standing there, his eyes staring at the monster.The zombie raised Skar with its two claws and directly tore him in half. Lucien could hear that Skar\u2019s heart, liver and guts fell onto the ground with profuse bleeding. Skar\u2019s thrilling scream was still echoing in the pipes.\u201cMage Hand\u2026 also not powerful enough.\u201c\u2026 Acid Splash\u2026 Wait! Sulphur is required to cast Acid Splash, which is also a component of gunpowder. And during the casting process the sulphur is lit.\u201dLucien\u2019s brain was striving for survival. He would not let his brain become another feast for the monster.The zombie opened Skar\u2019s head, in which the white brain tissue was still slightly shaking like a bowl of jelly.Lucien could feel the effects of its Dread Aura. His heart was racing and he felt breathless.He knew he couldn\u2019t lose his mind. Thus, he started analyzing the magic structure of Acid Splash, while his right hand reached into his pocket and grabbed a handful of sulphur.\u201cI gotta stop the magic reaction halfway when the sulphur is lit.\u201cThe notes mentioned that it would backfire. The consequence going from exhausting spiritual power to severe damage in soul, or even worse.\u201dAnalyzing the structure of the magic, Lucien tried to break it down into several parts to skip the acid-reaction part during the casting process and only keep the fire from the sulphur.The process of deconstruction and reconstruction needed to be repeated several times. Even if Acid Splash was only a very simple apprentice-level spell, it was still very challenging for Lucien.Honestly, he was not sure if he wouldn\u2019t kill himself by doing this. But he had no other choice.The zombie devoured the brain and threw Skar\u2019s body away. Slowly it turned to Lucien and suddenly started running towards its last target. In Lucien\u2019s eyes all of these was like a slow motion, he could smell the stink of death and feel the overwhelming horror.No one could tell Lucien\u2019s fear from his face. Lucien didn\u2019t move at all. He was just standing there with the sulphur slowly falling through his fingers.The zombie was even faster than Lucien thought. In a second, the horrible creature was only a meter away from him.In the meantime Lucien started casting the spell and then forced himself to stop before it was completely finished. As if he was hammered in the head, dizziness seized him and his nose started to bleed, but instantly a trail of fire showed up in front of Lucien.The claw of the zombie was just a few inches away from Lucien\u2019s head.Lucien\u2019s power was completely exhausted and he could not sustain the fire and let it grow anymore. In the last moment he released the fire and fell onto the ground.He had tried his best.The zombie\u2019s claw got his clothes and left a long tear on them.Suddenly a fire wall exploded between Lucien and the zombie. He raised his injured hands instinctively to protect his head, and then rolled away from the blue fire.The fire wall did not last long. However, after a whoosh the zombie was covered in flames like a human-shaped torch.Swinging its claws, the zombie stopped attacking Lucien and started stumbling towards the water, but the monster became much slower now.Of course, Lucien wouldn\u2019t let it go back into the river.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euGrabbing the dagger, he stood up and caught up with the zombie. Lucien fiercely kicked the zombie down and stabbed the dagger into the holes where the two white flames were flickering. Lucien felt the burning pain caused by the heat.Once, twice\u2026 Lucien was too afraid to stop himself from stabbing the monster, as if the zombie would seize the chance and tear him in half if he lost the momentum for even a second.Even though, the zombie was still crawling towards the river with flame on its back. But few meters away from the river, the white flames in its eyes were finally extinguished and its bones collapsed.Gasping with great effort, Lucien took out the zombie\u2019s brain with his dagger. He still remember that he needed it.After its brain had been taken away, soon the zombie turned completely into ashes, in which something small was shining there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He picked the ring up and started scrutinizing it carefully.There was a line of letters on its surface, which was written in the common tongue.\u201cHuman nature can be colder than snow.\u201dThe ring was just plain-looking, but when Lucien rubbed it gently he felt a mysterious and amazing power coming from the gem. After a few minutes, when Lucien\u2019s power started slowly recovering from the magic backfire, he carefully examined the ring again using his spiritual power.Lucien\u2019s injured soul was slightly shocked as soon as his spirit entered into the ring. He felt inside the gem what seemed to be the power of blizzard, but its structure was way more complicated than that of the apprentice-level magic.\u201cIt\u2019s a magic ring! Maybe that\u2019s why the zombie seemed much stronger than the others.\u201d Lucien was excited, \u201cIt seems that the ring\u2019s even superior to Benjamin\u2019s Truth Badge. I wonder which power level the ring belongs to\u2026\u201dWith his remaining spiritual power, Lucien couldn\u2019t even understand the magic structure in the ring, not to mention how to leave his own spiritual imprint on the structure, in order to use the power.A sorcerer with the first circle spell called Identify could directly understand the magic properties of all level one magic items, without having to analyze their inner structures. One\u2019s ability in using Identify would grow along with their accumulated knowledge, and thus the person could progress and start using the items of higher level.Sometimes there was extra information in some of them, including their makers, for what purposes they were made, and so on.According to the witch\u2019s notes, all of the magic items could be divided into different standards: apprentice level, level one to nine, and legend level.The evaluation criteria was based on the power of the magic item: if the power was equal to a first circle magic or to the ability of a level one knight, it was, correspondingly, a level one magic item. Nevertheless, there were four ranks within each level \u2014 low, medium, high and perfect. Taking a ring enchanted with the third circle spell Lightning for example, if the ring could be used once a day, it was a low-rank level three magic ring; if it could be used three times a day, it would instead be considered a medium-rank level three one; if the ring had some extra benefits like increasing the magic resistance of the user, it would be a high-rank level three item.If a magic item had some kind of permanent augmentation effect, it would be a level higher than the other common ones. For example, Mind Blank was an eight circle spell, and a magic item with the immunity towards this ring-eight magic would be recognized as a precious level nine magic artifact.Furthermore, the grading was also applied to magic weapons and armors.Lucien did not know the ring very well, so he dare not wear it casually in case there was any curse on it. After putting the ring in his pocket he was in a pretty good mood.However, when he noticed all the bodies and blood around him, he knew that he had more work to do. Most importantly, he needed to learn how to preserve the aquatic zombie\u2019s brain tissue.Lucien did not know how to use the apprentice spell called Organ Preservation yet, but the zombie\u2019s brain tissue should be able to last from three to five days, which should be enough time for Lucien to master the spell.According to the notes, Organ Preservation was a spell that could actually be used for keeping many other things fresh, besides organs. Twenty four hours duration each time. No magic reagent required.After opening the zombie\u2019s skull with the dagger, Lucien saw its black brain, which looked like countless disgusting worms entangling each other. Carefully, Lucien put the brain into a bag together with his icestones.Knowing lots of money would be needed for learning magic in the future, Lucien plundered all the money from the bodies, including the two hollow-headed ones in the river. He got thirty-three Nars and fifty-two Fells in total.Looking at his bulging money bag, a smile appeared on Lucien\u2019s face.However, when Lucien was collecting the money he noticed he couldn\u2019t see things clearly and his head was buzzing sometimes. Finally he realized that these were the sequelae from his spirit damage. There was no magic potion mentioned in the notes that could be used for this kind of injury. Therefore, the recovery might take a while.Then, Lucien started doing the labor. Holding his breath, he wrapped up the guts scattered on the ground and threw them away into the river, along with the bodies. Gradually he started getting used to the scene and even took a closer look at Skar\u2019s kidney. Lucien believed that soon all of them would become fish food in the Belem River.After rinsing away the blood on the ground, it was about time he left this place.\u201cIt seems like the heresy has nothing to do with the aquatic zombie.\u201d Lucien thought to himself while he was walking, \u201cThen what about the red-eyed rats\u2026?\u201dLucien decided that tomorrow morning he would go to Lord Venn\u2019s manor to find John before going to the Musicians\u2019 Association. He had to talk to John about the heresy, but, of course, without telling him what actually happened down here.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Several pastors in training would come down to the sewers once every three days to clean up the trash in the river using spells.But the person stepping out of a shadow after Lucien left was definitely not a new pastor.\u201cThe Lord of Argent, the forever lasting silence\u2026\u201d The person giggled in a mix of disgust and amusement, continuously talking to himself, \u201cA different name, a different identity? Interesting\u2026 That person must have been bewitched by him. I can\u2019t wait to see his shadow coming upon the land. A battle between him and the Cardinal of Aalto will be very interesting\u2026\u201cUmm\u2026 Probably there is some kind of legacy left by the previous ancient magic empire that he could utilize.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBut the church would interrupt his plan, I bet.\u201dThe person looked around. A cunning smile appeared upon his face.\u201cThe pretty smart young guy just created the new apprentice magic, Sulphuric Fire Wall, by himself.

His moustache was carefully trimmed, and his hair was of Pompadour style.Graceful as the man might look, he had a dark aura of ferocity and brutality, and he was not a nobleman.He was Rosan Aaron.All his men knew that Rosan Aaron was a knight who had already awakened the Blessing in his blood. When he was about to become a grand knight, unfortunately, his power went awry and turned out to be vicious and dark. The power not only destroyed his noble title, but also caused Aaron\u2019s endless hiding from the church.Aaron hated the God for treating him so cruelly. Losing all of his possessions, for a long time he lived like a rat, hiding all the time. While he was trying to at least dress like a nobleman, bitter hatred was still burning his guts day and night.The grading of knight and pastor was similar to the different levels of sorcerer.The ability to use the third circle spell Fly, the sixth circle spell Magic Trigger, or many other ninth circle spells symbolized different levels of sorcerer. When a sorcerer or sorceress could start using one of these spells, it meant he or she had made a new breakthrough. Their spiritual power would grow by a large extent, and their souls would transform into a higher-level form. Even their lives would be extended.In the ancient magic empire, people regarded the first and second circle sorcerers as junior-rank mages, while third to fifth circle were middle-rank mages, and sixth to eight circle, senior-rank mages. Above them, a ninth circle sorcerer or sorceress would be respected as an Archmage.Similarly, the levels three, six and nine were the key promoting points for a knight. If a person successfully awakened the Blessing in their blood, they would first become a level one or level two knight. From level three to five, they would be regarded as a grand knight; then six to eight, a radiant knight; in level nine the title was gold knight; and after that was the highest level of all, a legendary knight.For pastors, it went from junior-rank to middle-rank pastor. Then a middle-rank pastor could be promoted to bishop. For the senior-rank pastors, most of them would become cardinals. There was no special title for a level nine pastor, but if one could successfully join the conclave, he or she would be respected as a grand cardinal.There were more than four hundred registered official knights in the Duchy of Orvarit. Among them, there were only around fifty grand knights and less than ten radiant knights.Most of them were members of the Violet Knights, garrisoning different key fortresses.Back then, Aaron, who was a level two knight, was very close to becoming a grand knight, and thus ranking among the top fifty knights in the Duchy. Now, he has been working for a big man for a long time, doing all the evil and bloody things for him to maintain his fake honor.Jackson and his men did not come back to the hideout in time. Aaron felt something went wrong, so he came down here himself.\u201cSulphur, blood\u2026 and something else.\u201d Sniffing the air, Aaron\u2019s eyebrows frowned together. With the Blessing power, Aaron was more sensitive to environment in general than common people.Aaron could tell that someone had cleaned this place up before. But there were still slight traces of blood, brain tissue, acid and sulphur on the ground, showing that a fierce struggle just happened here.\u201cAcid\u2026 sulphur\u2026\u201d Aaron was thinking out loud, \u201cAcid Splash? It was a typical apprentice spell. An apprentice sorcerer did all this?!\u201d Aaron could not believe his guess, but the reasoning did make sense.The person who did this had left quite a while before he arrived. It was too late for Aaron to track the responsible. Aaron was also concerned that what they were doing would be reported to the church or nobles.It was still possible to track him if he turned to the priests of Silver Horn for help, but Aaron would not. He knew their magic could not guarantee finding the person, and more importantly, if the person had already reported what they did to the church, what he should do immediately was escape.Then Aaron quickly turned around and disappeared in the darkness. Only his footsteps were still echoing there in the sewers.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lying in the bed, Lucien was too nervous to fall asleep. Any little noise could scare Lucien out of the bed. Since there was no chance for him to have a good rest for now, he decided to take a look at the ring again. Doing research could calm Lucien down, and also if his enemies did find him, the ring might help.Inside the ring there was a solid geometric model, of which the structure was not very complicated. With his high school mathematics and physics knowledge, it only took Lucien an hour to finish the analysis. But when Lucien was trying to imprint his spiritual mark on the magic structure, he almost failed during the process. His soul was damaged and Lucien felt his power totally unstable.With great effort, the magic structure was finally imprinted with Lucien\u2019s mark. The information of the ring came to his mind:\u201cThe original owner of the ring, Ice Revenger, was a sorcerer apprentice who was betrayed by his best friend. In order to take his revenge, the apprentice turned to a great alchemist for help and spent all his money on that. The ring felt ice-cold, so he could bear the bitterness of being betrayed in his mind. A second circle spell, Palmeira\u2019s Frost Blades, was sealed in the ring. The spell could torture people with bitter cold and pain.\u201dThe ring could help promoting the spiritual power of its owner to match a level one knight\u2019s strength. Furthermore, its owner could also use Palmeira\u2019s Frost Blades once a day. Therefore, it was a middle-rank level two magic item.Lucien was not going to wear the ring for now, since it would definitely draw some attention and bring him unnecessary trouble, but he decided to carry the ring in his pocket, just in case.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lucien woke up early at dawn with a bad headache. He felt dizzy and also had a fever. His physical weakness was caused by his internal injury from the magic backfire.There was no time for breakfast. Lucien wanted to report the heretics to Lord Venn as soon as possible. After changing to new linen clothes, he pushed the door open and headed towards Lord Venn\u2019s manor.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe cool air outside was refreshing. He took a deep breath and felt his headache lessened. After forty minutes walking, Lucien finally saw the magnificent manor.Lord Venn was a level two knight who used to pledge his allegiance to the Violet Knights. The grand duke of Orvarit and him became good friends when the grand duke was still the Violet Count and the commander of the Violet Knights. When Lord Venn became older, he left the fortress in the Dark Mountain Range and started having a more peaceful lifestyle here. But from time to time, he was summoned to the palace to be the grand duke\u2019s military consultant.The manor was surrounded by a high wall and several watchtowers, demonstrating the owner\u2019s military background.Outside of the manor, a number of farmers had already started working. Two young men in their grey knight squire uniforms were patrolling, followed by some guards.\u201cWho are you? What are you doing here?\u201d Noticing Lucien was walking towards them, a dark blond knight asked sternly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019m looking for John to tell him something important\u201dThe dark blonde man, Ian, made a snort in contempt. \u201cWhy should I trust you? Just because you claim to be John\u2019s friend? John and other knight squires are in training. I can\u2019t let you in, unless you have proof of your identity.\u201dQuite obviously, Ian did not get along well with John. Lord Venn always had John in high esteem, which made Ian feel more than jealous. In his eyes, John was just a stupid pauper who somehow got a chance to become a knight squire and was always using the knight rules to please Lord Venn, while he was definitely better-educated and more talented.Another knight squire, Durago, felt the same way. Thus he just stood there, watching while Ian gave the newcomer a hard time.Ian thought that a poor youngster like the one who was standing in front of him would be frightened by the posture of a knight squire. Were it the case, the youngster might just give up or start begging them on his knees.After going through so many difficulties and challenges, Lucien understood clearly what he was facing. In his eyes, it was ridiculous to see the two squires trying to pick on him, a nobody.Lucien answered seriously, \u201cJohn\u2019s friend is in great danger. If John can\u2019t make it back in time to avoid it, both of you will be responsible for the consequences. I\u2019m pretty sure that Lord Venn would definitely not be happy with what you guys are doing here.\u201dHe knew that Lord Venn was a nobleman who strictly sticked to knight rules all the way in his life. If Lord Venn knew his men violated the rules, he would punish them severely and drive them away from his land with no hesitation.\u201cHow dare you threaten me, you little bastard!\u201d Stepping forward, Ian was so furious that he almost pulled out his knight sword.Lucien could feel the pressure coming from the high level knight squire. Even the guards standing behind him felt frightened.What was out of their expectation was that Lucien was still the same, calm and serious. He asked sternly, \u201cAre you gonna kill me, an innocent and unarmed boy, right now?\u201dIt seemed like he was not affected by Ian\u2019s posture at all. His willpower was stronger than the threat.\u201cDid you hear what I said?\u201d Now it was Lucien\u2019s turn to take a step forward, \u201cDo you still want to be a knight?\u201dIan\u2019s anger was burning his guts, but he knew if he really killed this bastard, his future title, rank, land and manor would all be gone. He was not stupid.Durago tried to make the situation easier for Ian. After giving Lucien a distasteful glance, Durago hauled Ian back. \u201cDon\u2019t waste our time on this.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let me see you again,\u201d said Ian viciously. Then he turned directly toward the manor.Durago\u2019s face looked grim. He just stood there, waiting for Ian.It didn\u2019t bother Lucien at all. As soon as he realized Ian and Durago were trying to cause him trouble, Lucien reached his hand into the pocket carrying the ring. The power of the ring helped increase his willpower to a higher level that could compete with a level one knight. Thus, of course the pressure from Ian, a knight squire, could not affect him.Less than five minutes later, Lucien saw John running out from the gate in a hurry, followed by Ian, who was walking slowly behind him. John was very surprised when he recognized that it was Lucien.\u201cYou\u2019re here, Lucien! I thought you were the one who was in danger.\u201d\u201cFollow me. I\u2019ll explain it to you.\u201dLucien stopped when he was sure that Ian and Durago couldn\u2019t hear their conversation. Then he turned to John, and started telling his well-prepared story.\u201cI met a weird old beggar a few days ago,\u201d Lucien put a worried look on his face, \u201cAt first, he was just complaining about the nobles and knights, but later, yesterday, when no one was around, he started accusing God. And I realized he was a believer of the devil, who was doing his vicious missionary work in Aalto.\u201cI was about to report to the church, but I saw he was secretly meeting Jackson. I\u2019m afraid that the gangsters are involved with the heretic, and they may seize the chance and take revenge on us, or what\u2019s worse, on your parents. If you can report to Lord Venn directly about what\u2019s going on here, I believe the nobles and the church would pay more attention to it.\u201d Lucien looked into John\u2019s eyes.\u201cThese damned scum\u2026 Now they\u2019re involved with the devil. Yes, you\u2019re right. I should report it to Lord Venn immediately.\u201d John took Lucien\u2019s words directly without any doubt.\u201cAnd John, I\u2019m afraid the situation is even more severe than you thought. I counted\u2026 there are just about ten beggars now in Aalto. Many of them\u2026 disappeared.\u201d Lucien continued warning him. But he could not tell John what happened in the sewers.Frowning his eyebrows, John could guess what happened to these poor homeless guys, \u201cBlood sacrifice\u2026\u201d he murmured.Lucien nodded seriously. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I\u2019m guessing. But John, remember, don\u2019t tell Lord Venn that I was the one who found this out. I\u2019m afraid some heretics would seek revenge on me. I have no power to protect myself.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019ll be awarded for reporting this,\u201d said John.Clapping on John\u2019s shoulder, Lucien\u2019s face softened a bit. \u201cI\u2019m more concerned with my life, John. Remember to ask Lord Venn not to divulge your information as well. You have a family to take care. They don\u2019t know how to fight as well.\u201d\u201cI will. You\u2019re always this careful, Lucien.\u201d John nodded. There was nothing more important than his family. \u201cBut if there\u2019s any award, part of it is still yours.\u201d John promised.Lucien smiled, \u201cThanks John.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJohn stayed a bit longer with Lucien. Since Lucien told Ian and Durago that John\u2019s friend was in danger, it would be quite suspicious if John went back to the manor straight away.After John left, Lucien decided to wait for a few more minutes to make sure that everything was going as expected. A while later, Lucien was relieved when he saw a line of knights galloping across the field. Besides John, there were six squires and a young pastor led by a serious-looking elder knight.When Lucien went back to Aalto, he felt some vibration under the ground from the sewers. Lord Venn\u2019s men were there already.To be prudent, Lucien decided he would not go back into the sewers for a while. Recently he was focusing on analyzing magic.Some time before the clock showed eight thirty, Lucien finally arrived at his workplace, the Musicians\u2019 Association, in time for his shift.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Being late on the first day of work would definitely not make a good first impression on the director, Mr. Hank.Another receptionist, Cathy, smiled to her colleague and joked, \u201cElena, who are you waiting for? Your sweetheart?\u201d\u201cCome on, Cathy. I\u2019m waiting for a friend of mine. Today\u2019s his first day working for the association.\u201dWhen Elena was talking, Lucien came into the hall.\u201cThanks God, you are here, Lucien.\u201d Elena walked out of the counter and toward Lucien, \u201cWhy do you look so tired? Are you sick?\u201dLucien knew he must look terrible. The headache caused by his soul injury was torturing him all the way. After rushing here, he felt quite dizzy.\u201cWell\u2026 I think so. But I\u2019m okay. Thank you for asking, Elena.\u201d Lucien smiled to Elena, who was wearing a long white dress today. \u201cI think we\u2019re gonna meet Mr. Hank now, aren\u2019t we?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cYes, we are.\u201d Elena started walking upstairs, and was followed by Lucien, \u201cNo worries. Sunday\u2019s never a busy day, or say, the work is not busy in general.\u201dMr. Hank was a middle-aged serious man, who was always wearing a decent suit. After asking some basic questions, Mr. Hank just nodded and asked Elena to lead Lucien directly to the library.The library was on the second floor. While they were heading toward it, Elena was trying to describe the other librarian to Lucien, \u201cHis name is Pierre Sandor. Both of you work the morning shift in the library. He\u2019s an ok guy. I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll give you a hard time, so no worries. But he\u2019s a bit\u2026 umm\u2026\u201d Elena paused for a few seconds, \u201cweird.\u201dThe guy called Pierre should also have some connections in the association, or he would have no chance working as a librarian here if he was just a nobody. Lucien just wanted to do his own work and avoid trouble as much as possible.The Music Library was huge and quiet, and thousands of precious music books, journals, and newspaper were collected here.There was only a black-haired young guy sitting behind the wood counter, reading the tablature carefully. In Lucien\u2019s eyes, the guy looked like a big fan of music.\u201cPierre, Pierre\u2026\u201d Elena tried to draw his attention, \u201cThis is the new librarian, Lucien.\u201dFinally, Pierre raised his head from the book. His brown eyes looked a bit confused.\u201cMorning, Elena! What day is it today\u2026 Sunday?\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Pierre. I\u2019m Lucien Evans, the new librarian.\u201d Lucien introduced himself with a warm smile.Just realizing his new colleague was standing in front of him, Pierre walked out of the counter and greeted Lucien, \u201cNice to meet you, Lucien. I\u2019m Pierre Sandor.\u201dWhen they were shaking hands, Pierre put on a sly smile, \u201cLucien, you\u2019d better\u2026 refrain yourself a bit\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, Pierre?\u201d Elena was confused.\u201cJust guys\u2019 conversation,\u201d answered Pierre casually.Shrugging her shoulders, Elena whispered to Lucien, \u201cYou see. I told you\u2026 And I gotta go now, Lucien. Make good use of the books here, and work hard.\u201dAfter Elena left, Pierre started showing Lucien around. While he was walking, he talked to Lucien casually, \u201cUmm\u2026 I sometimes talk in a weird way. If you don\u2019t understand, don\u2019t let my words disturb you.\u201d\u201cSo you asking me to \u2018refrain myself\u2019 was also a casual talk?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cNope, that was serious. Guys in our age can easily drain ourselves from too much\u2026 Umm, you know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201dLucien didn\u2019t know what to say. Now in Lucien\u2019s eyes, Pierre looked like a big fan of music, and kind of nasty.After introducing the basic stuff that Lucien had to do as a librarian here, Pierre stretched himself a bit and said, \u201cOnly the members of the association can have access to this library, so it\u2019s never busy here. Just remember to be polite to the musicians. You can spend more time here, and I\u2019m gonna go back and enjoy The Well-Tempered Clavier now.\u201dHis eyes were glowing when he mentioned music.\u201cSure.\u201d Lucien was more than willing to be left alone. With his spirit library, Lucien was always trying to store more books in it, like a squirrel collecting its favourite cones.Lucien quickly leafed through a book, and a copy of the book instantly appeared in his spirit library. Then Lucien directly turned to another one.\u201cHey, what are you doing there?\u201d Pierre asked in a confused way. He hadn\u2019t gone far yet.\u201cI\u2019m doing a random check here to see if there are any damaged ones. Then I can take note of them and report to the association.\u201d Lucien immediately made up an excuse.\u201cYou\u2019re as careful as a woman, Lucien.\u201d Pierre commented.In the following four hours, only two musicians visited the library. Lucien thus managed to collect more than a hundred of the books there. His arms felt pretty sore from leafing through them.The books covered many aspects of the world, not just music. Lucien wanted to have a better understanding of the world as soon as possible.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lucien finished his work at about half past midday. When he was leaving the library, Pierre was still immersed in music, with a bread in his hand.Later, Lucien went to Mr. Victor\u2019s place and continued his study.Life was pretty peaceful in the following couple of days.One evening, John came back. When no one was around, he started telling Lucien what happened on that day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Their youngest son, Iven, was still playing on the streets with his friends.\u201cYou can never imagine what we found down there,\u201d John said seriously, \u201cThere was a demon hall!\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lucien was more than surprised, \u201cThey built a hall down the sewers? Has Lord Venn questioned the heretics yet?\u201dShaking his head, John sighed with disappointment, \u201cNo, Lucien. We didn\u2019t find anyone there. All of them were already gone by the time we arrived.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s impossible, John. I didn\u2019t tell anyone else about this except you.\u201d Lucien started feeling worried. What if the demon followers somehow found out it was him who exposed and denounced them?\u201cLord Venn told me that information about our actions might have been leaked by a knight. We don\u2019t know who did this yet, but if it\u2019s true, the knight should be of a relatively high level.\u201dLucien thought about the possibility that the heretic power had infiltrated into the upper class. However, it was astonishing to imagine that the evil power had corroded some of the noble knights.\u201cWhat about Aaron\u2019s Gang?\u201d Lucien asked.\u201cThe leaders escaped, including Rosan Aaron. The rest of the gangsters know nothing about the heresy. They can\u2019t lie in front of the divine power of the inquisition.\u201d John\u2019s eyebrows frowned, \u201cEven though they know nothing, all of them will be sentenced to death by the judges.\u201dFacing heresy, the church never showed mercy. And Lucien believed that the way the church treated sorcerers would not be any better than that.One of the books from the library that Lucien read recently was called Hunting Sorcerer, which was written in the year 392 of the Saint Calendar, or say, 423 years ago. It was an instruction for sorcerer hunters and night watchers telling them how to identify the sorcerers, how to track them and even how to torture them. Lucien remembered some of the paragraphs, which sounded ridiculous and cruel to him:\u201cIf a suspect lives in an unsociable or eccentric way, the chance of him or her being a sorcerer or a sorceress is high. However, even if a suspect is always sociable and passionate, the possibility still could not be ruled out, because he or she might just be pretending.\u201d\u201cIf the person you suspect panics when he or she knows who you are, the person is a sorcerer. But if the person does not, don\u2019t lower our guard, because all the sorcerers are experienced liars.\u201d\u201cIf your divine spells cannot help you make sure the identity of the suspect, inflicting sacred punishment on the suspect can be useful: If the person rolls eyes when facing the punishment, that means he or she is trying to communicate with demons to seek for power; If the person\u2019s eyes glaze fearlessly, that means he or she has got the protection from devil power and thus you must torture the person in a more severe way; If the person dies, it is because the demons took his or her life in order to keep their secrets safe.\u201d\u201cIf you have tried them all but still cannot be sure, leave the suspect to our almighty God. Burn the suspect. A sorcerer would burn down to ashes, while God would protect the person safe and sound in the fire if he or she is innocent.\u201dLucien was grateful for still being alive. If Lucien had lived four hundred years ago when the book was written, he would have been burned to death thousands of times. The church had been dominating the whole continent for so many years; thus they were now paying more attention to the heresy in the north, instead of going all out hunting scattered sorcerers and sorceresses.\u201cThen did you find anything in the demon hall?\u201d Lucien asked with curiosity.Bad memories made John\u2019s eyebrows frown even tighter, \u201cWe knight squires didn\u2019t go in there. Knights and pastors led by Lord Venn, Lord Verdi and the cardinal of Salvatore searched the hall. Lord Venn never told me what he saw there, but I saw his face when he walked out\u2026 He looked very serious.\u201cI was guarding outside of the gate.\u201d John\u2019s eyes looked down at the ground and Lucien could tell the bad memory still disturbed him, \u201cWhen they opened the gate, I saw the ground was covered with blood. And I saw hearts\u2026. living throbbing hearts on the ground. They said that those were hearts extracted from people\u2019s chests when they were alive.\u201cLucien, I\u2019ve heard many stories, poems and rumours saying how horrible and vicious the heresy is, but today I finally realized how hateful and inhuman it can be.\u201d John raised his head and looked at Lucien, speaking with great determination, \u201cI hate them, the heretics. I can never forget what I saw there. I want to grow stronger and eliminate the demons completely.\u201dLooking at his serious face, Lucien smiled, \u201cThis is the justice you\u2019re looking for, isn\u2019t it, John?\u201dJohn nodded, but then shook his head, \u201cI still don\u2019t clearly know what kind of justice I\u2019m looking for, Lucien. All I know is that I not only want to protect my families and friends, but I also want to protect more people and fight against the dark powers.\u201d\u201cI know there\u2019s a class among the knights called \u2018Demon Hunter\u2019. They walk in the darkness and are willing to die fighting against the devil power. Is that your dream now?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cI don\u2019t know, Lucien. I still can\u2019t awaken my Blessing power. Not everyone can become a real knight, not to mention becoming a demon hunter.\u201d John replied, a bit depressed.\u201cCome on! Of course you can.\u201d Lucien gave John a friendly nudge, \u201cLook who am I talking to? The most promising knight squire appreciated by Lord Venn!\u201dFeeling the encouragement from his best friend, John grinned at Lucien.\u201cTalking about Lord Venn\u2026\u201d Lucien asked, \u201cDid he mention anything about your reward?\u201d\u201cYes, sure!\u201d John\u2019s face was lightened by this topic, \u201cLord Venn promised to give me a good knight sword made of fine steel. Compared with what I\u2019m using now, this one would be much sharper and even have some magic effects on it!\u201dTalking about the new sword, John even giggled a bit with sweet expectation.Lucien and John stopped their conversation when Joel came back. In the end, John reminded Lucien, \u201cLord Venn told me that security will be tightened and there will be much more undercover investigations in Aalto recently. You were questioned before because of the witch, so be careful recently. You\u2019re Mr. Victor\u2019s student now, and you never know if there\u2019s anyone who\u2019d frame you for this out of jealousy.\u201d\u201cThank you, John. I\u2019ll be careful,\u201d said Lucien gratefully. He knew that, as a knight squire, John was not allowed to leak this kind of information to someone else. Lucien knew he had to be really careful recently and stop practicing most of the spells that could cause a mess. However, Lucien also believed that after this massive search, when the knights and the nobles started letting down their vigilance, it would be even safer than before.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Another Sunday morning, and Lucien was trying to organize everything on his day off. Although he was not practicing much casting during the past couple of days, his analysis work of the other several magic spells went on pretty well. His spiritual power was completely recovered and grew even stronger than ever with his meditation. For now, Lucien could cast up to six spells of the Element School successively.In his spare time, Lucien also worked hard on his music studies. He spent lots of time with reading different books in his spirit library, but not only music books. From a variety of books, Lucien started to learn more about the continent: those countries believing in the God of Truth in the south, and heretic countries in the north, as well as the evil creatures living in the the Dark Mountain Range.The brain tissue of the mutant aquatic zombie could be preserved up to three years by exerting the magic once a day, which enabled Lucien to have enough time to collect the rest of the magic matters.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cYour progress impressed me again, Lucien.\u201d After testing Lucien\u2019s basic music knowledge learned within the several classes, Mr. Victor commended, \u201cThen we can move forward to actual practice and to learn how to integrate what you\u2019ve learned from the books into it.\u201dWhen Lucien first helped with improving the harpsichord, Victor thought that Lucien might just happen to have an inspiration there. But now Victor felt that Lucien at least had some talent in music.\u201cLucien, what musical instrument do you want to learn?\u201d asked Victor gently, \u201cI\u2019m relatively good at violin, harpsichord, pipe organ and flute. But if you want to learn something else, I should also be able to help.\u201dLucien never really put much thought into it. He was a bit hesitant. Lucien was a fan of piano back in the days, but he never had a chance to learn how to play it. But on second thought, one day Lucien would set out to find the headquarter of the Continental Congress of Magic and, of course, he could not carry a piano with him all the way. Probably he should choose something relatively portable, like a violin?Lott, Felicia and Herodotus were curious to see which one Lucien would choose, but Lucien was still hesitating.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Lucien.\u201d Victor smiled, \u201cIf you have any concern, just tell me. Maybe I can help you.\u201dSo Lucien asked cordially, \u201cMr. Victor, can I choose both the improved harpsichord and violin?\u201dThe rest of the three students were a bit pissed off. They felt Lucien was being really greedy because he could learn for free.\u201cNo problem,\u201d answered Victor, \u201cbut you gotta focus on one thing at a time. What about we start from learning harpsichord? And I can probably get some new ideas while I\u2019m teaching.\u201d\u201cSure, thank you, Mr. Victor.\u201d Lucien was grateful.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Mr. Rhine and Mr. Shavell have finished the improvement of the harpsichord a couple of days ago. Let\u2019s try the new harpsichord today! All of you can come! I even feel that I shouldn\u2019t call it a harpsichord anymore, since its tone, its range, and its volume are completely different now. For me, it\u2019s a revolution in string instruments!\u201dSeeing the joy on his face, Lucien could tell that Mr.Victor was very satisfied with the improvement.\u201cMr. Victor, as the initiator of the harpsichord improvement, you may like to give the new invention an official name.\u201d When they were walking upstairs, Lott talked to his teacher in a flattering way.\u201cYes, Rhine, Shavell and I actually talked about the name before. However, none of us could find a proper name for it.\u201d Victor looked at Lucien with a mild smile on his face, \u201cLucien, what\u2019s your idea?\u201d\u201cMy idea?\u201d Lucien was a bit surprised.\u201cOf course, you made no small contribution to this. We\u2019d like to hear your suggestion.\u201d said Victor, \u201cWell\u2026 Rhine appreciated its mechanical sophistication, so he wanted to name it mechanical harpsichord. I mean\u2026Mr. Rhine is a talent in music, but definitely not good at naming a new musical instrument. Mechanical harpsichord doesn\u2019t sound right to me at all.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your idea then, sir?\u201d Lucien asked.\u201cUm\u2026 I prefer to have a new name. This new musical instrument combines both the features of harpsichord and clavichord, and it has a much wider range of tones compared with its predecessors. So I would suggest the name to be\u2026 superchord!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Including Lucien, none of the students present knew what to say toward this name.\u201cWell, what about the name \u2018pianoforte\u2019?\u201d Lucien said with uncertainty.\u201cPianoforte? It\u2019s a pretty new name, but it sounds a bit weird.\u201d Victor rubbed his chin with his hand in thoughts.\u201cThe sounds produced by the new instrument were an extension of what the harpsichord could do.\u201d Lucien was trying to make the weird name make sense. Lucien knew, in his world, the first piano made by the Italian harpsichord maker Cristofori was first called \u201cpianoforte\u201d. In Italian, pianoforte meant 'soft loud\u201d. Lucien wanted to keep the name, because it would be sweet if he could play an instrument in this world which was almost the same as a piano on Earth.\u201cPianoforte\u2026 Pianoforte\u2026\u201d Victor found the name was pretty interesting, \u201cWhat about just \u2018piano\u2019?\u201dLucien was very surprised that Victor would appreciate the name.\u201cI like the name, \u2018piano\u2019.\u201d Felicia agreed, which was even more beyond Lucien\u2019s expectation. It was the first time Felicia showed her commendation for any of Lucien\u2019s ideas. A faint blush appeared on her beautiful face, \u201cI don\u2019t know why\u2026 I just somehow feel like it\u2019s the proper name.\u201dMr. Victor nodded with a bit of confusion, \u201cYes\u2026 I feel the same way, Felicia. Piano\u2026 It feels like it should be called piano\u2026 Weird\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026That\u2019s how I feel as well.\u201d Lucien was a bit nervous. He did not understand why both Mr. Victor and Felicia had a special feeling toward the name. Hurriedly, he changed the topic, \u201cI can hear someone playing music in the practice room upstairs.\u201d\u201cYes, Mr. Rhine is here today. Didn\u2019t I mention it?\u201d Victor answered with joy.Felicia\u2019s face was now as red as a ripe tomato.Rhine was sitting in front of the \u2018piano\u2019, his hair silver and his gesture charming. Without moving his shoulders and arms, his fingers were dancing on the piano keyboards, and a beautiful piece of music was flowing out of the musical instrument.They indulged themselves in the joys of the song. No one made a sound until Rhine finished playing. All the students and Mr. Victor started applauding for the amazing performance.\u201cMr. Rhine! As an excellent violinist, it\u2019s amazing that your skill in playing clavichord is also great.\u201d Felicia\u2019s eyes were glowing, \u201cYour performance was as good as Ms. Silvia\u2019s!\u201dStanding from the bench, Rhine bowed to them elegantly with his right hand on his chest. He was trying to play the same song on both the clavichord and the piano to see the difference. He turned to Felicia and smiled, \u201cI\u2019m flattered, Felicia. But I can never compete with Ms. Silvia. It was she who wrote this song after all.\u201dMs. Silvia was the best clavichord player in Aalto. Since clavichord was ideal for playing in a relatively small space, like in a living room or even bedroom, Mr. Silvia was often invited by the noble ladies to play in their places. It was said that Ms. Silvia was a close friend of Princess Natasha, and thus she enjoyed a high reputation in the association.When Rhine was playing, Lucien paid more attention on the movement of his fingers. At the same time, he searched in his spirit library and found some useful books to refer to. According to these books, the modification of a musical instrument was the main cause of the changes in fingerings, as well as the holistic style. The piano standing beside them had eighty-eight keys and different pedals, which was already very close to a modern piano on Earth. Thus Lucien believed the modern piano fingering should be the best way of playing it.On earth, people used to play clavichord with three fingers of each hand. Then the famous pianist, Bach, started using his thumbs and little fingers. When piano gained its popularity, Chopin made a second revolution in fingerings by also playing the black keys with his thumb and little finger.When Lucien was reviewing the basic modern fingering books in his mind, Victor told Rhine about the new name of the instrument. It turned out that Rhine loved the name as well.\u201cCome here, Lucien. Sit in front of the piano. I\u2019m gonna show you the basic fingerings.\u201d Victor said to him.Lucien trotted toward Mr. Victor with a bit excitement. However, as soon as he sat on the bench, Lucien felt something was not right. It was a bit too short for the piano.\u201cMr. Victor, can I have a taller bench?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cWhy? You\u2019re not much shorter than Mr. Rhine. The height should be fine.\u201d Victor was a bit surprised.Extending his arms, Lucien tried to show it to Mr. Victor, \u201cBut if I sit on a bench of this height, I could only use my fingers and wrists. If I want to use my lower and upper arm, as well as my shoulder, I need a taller bench, otherwise it would be too awkward.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re not supposed to use your arms and shoulders. That\u2019s too rude!\u201d Victor was pretty serious, \u201cForget about what you\u2019ve seen in the pubs. You saw how Mr. Rhine played, didn\u2019t you? Did he ever use his arms and shoulders?\u201dVictor\u2019s reaction was within Lucien\u2019s expectation. Modern piano fingering was quite hard to be accepted by many famous pianists back in the days. In their eyes, pianists using modern fingering like Franz Liszt were rude. The way of swinging arms and shoulders in their mind looked very barbaric and it was like smashing the piano.\u201cYes, Lucien. Those players in the pubs are not well-educated. I know\u2026 umm\u2026 you probably grew up in that environment, but now you\u2019re here. It\u2019s time for you to see what is noble music now.\u201d Seizing the chance, Herodotus scoffed at Lucien\u2019s words.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMr. Victor, the piano is a new musical instrument.\u201d Lucien explained calmly, \u201cI feel that how a musician plays the instrument should depend on the features of it. As an extension of harpsichord, piano is superior in both volume and range. With the strength of arm and shoulder, I feel its features could be presented in a better way.\u201dRhine took a step forward and smiled at Victor, \u201cI agree with Lucien. Remember the discussion about fingerings several years ago? Probably we can make a real difference again with it.\u201dVictor thought for a while and finally said, \u201cAll right, maybe we can give it a shot. But Lucien, if it later is considered wrong, it would take you a long time to forget the wrong movements and start over again. Are you sure you want to do this?\u201dLucien nodded at Mr. Victor with a determined look.In the other students\u2019 eyes, Lucien was no more than an arrogant boy trying to impress Mr. Victor and Mr. Rhine in this stupid way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The song did not require any expert skills, and thus, when it was played on a harpsichord, it was quite plain. However, after the improvement, the tone of the piano would definitely add some splendour to it.With his diligent practice of meditation, Lucien had an even better memory now. It only took him a while to roughly go through the music several times. Before him, Mr. Victor only saw noble students, like Lott and Felicia, being able to do this, because they grew up under the nurture of music since they were born.\u201cAll right, Lucien. I know you still feel you\u2019re not prepared, but it\u2019s time for you to start playing. Don\u2019t be nervous and just pay attention to the keys you should press down. Take it easy.\u201d Mr. Victor was quite looking forward to Lucien\u2019s first play.Putting his hands on the keyboard in a defined arch, Lucien pressed down the first key. It was not difficult for him to remember the song, but, as expected, playing it was a completely different story. Lucien felt his fingers were too clumsy to reach the right keys in time. Slow as he was, Lucien tried his best to focus on the keys to make sure they were the correct ones. Instead of a song, his first-time playing sounded more like a bunch of separated notes climbing out of the piano slowly one by one, or like a dying man exhaling with great effort.However, no one there ever laughed at him, including the three noble students. Watching Lucien play reminded them of their own past struggle, which was even more terrible.It was a short piece of melody, that should last around a minute, but it took Lucien more than three minutes to finish playing it. After he pressed down the last key, his forehead was oozing sweat. Lucien felt that even fighting with an aquatic zombie in the pipes could not be more exhausting.Mr.Victor was the first person who started applauding Lucien, followed by Rhine and the other students.\u201cYou did a good job, Lucien.\u201d Victor comforted him, smiling, \u201cI know how clumsy a person would feel when he or she first started playing. But you are the only student I\u2019ve seen that managed to press every key correctly. It\u2019s impressive.\u201dRhine nodded, \u201cYes, you are very smart, Lucien. I\u2019m sure you will improve quickly with more practice. But the coordination of your hands was for sure not your strong point, and later you will also need to use your feet for the pedals. It\u2019ll be pretty challenging for you.\u201d\u201cI agree,\u201d said Mr. Victor, \u201cBut being more coordinate is just a matter of time. If you\u2019re willing to work hard, you\u2019ll be a qualified musician within ten years.\u201d\u201cTen years?\u201d It seemed that even with the direction of a master musician, it still would take a long time for a person to make achieve something in music. However, Lucien was still expecting that, by becoming a qualified musician as soon as possible, his living expenses as well as the cost for his magic experiments could be fully covered.\u201cIs there any way to become a qualified musician faster?\u201d Lucien asked.\u201cYes, sure, if you\u2019re a genius.\u201d Felicia interjected, \u201cBut you are not, Lucien. Working hard is the only way to become a qualified musician, and of course it takes time. Don\u2019t let Mr. Victor lose his face for having a student who couldn\u2019t even play the piano decently.\u201dIn Felicia\u2019s eyes, Lucien\u2019a question fully showed his shallowness.Rhine responded in a more mild way, \u201cI understand young people\u2019s eagerness, but like Felicia said, my current small achievement in playing violin took me a long time, and it\u2019s the same with other instruments.\u201d Then he paused a bit, \u201cWell, actually hard practice is not the only way to become a qualified musician. If you could awaken the Blessing in your blood, your ability of controlling your body would be increased by a large extent. With your smart little brain, you could probably become a piano musician within a few weeks.\u201d\u201cBut how long it would take you to awaken the Blessing?\u201d Rhine shrugged his shoulders, \u201cMaybe ten years, maybe twenty years, or forever\u2026 What do you think?\u201d\u201cBecoming a genius sounds more practical, Lucien.\u201d Lott laughed.Victor turned to Lucien, \u201cIf you just want to master a relatively hard piece of melody, an intensive practice within a short period of time may be helpful, but this can never help you become a really good musician. Do not rush, but always work hard, Lucien.\u201d Victor tapped Lucien on his shoulders to encourage him.Lucien looked at Mr. Victor and nodded.After the class, Lucien started working on his monthly budget. He needed to give auntie Alisa three Nars every month for the meals because he was now eating with their family more often. Also, more money would be spent on building a secret magic lab in the future, when Aalto calmed down and became safer.Besides money, Lucien still had lots of concerns: buying too many glasswares for magic experiments could be very suspicious to the church, and Lucien currently had no idea what to do with them; he also needed some black robes, so he could sew some rows of small pockets inside for carrying more different magic reagents in the future.Burying his head in his arms, Lucien thought to himself, \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll become a tailor sewing clothes for people rather than a sorcerer.\u201d The idea amused him a bit.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Several days later, at night, Lucien was reviewing the last magic he analyzed, Homan\u2019s Oscillation, even though it was too risky for him to practice the spell at this moment. Besides, by changing the vibration frequency of his spiritual power, now Lucien could leave an imperceptible magic mark on a target, which made him very happy.As for music, like Rhine commented, after a certain stage, his good memory could not help much anymore. His poor coordination became his biggest problem, so Lucien was still practicing the same etude.All of a sudden, Lucien heard someone or something was swiftly approaching his shack.Lucien hid all his stuff under the bed in a hurry and stood there in a defensive posture.*Knock, knock, knock*\u2026The window opened by itself!Lucien felt a familiar wave of magic power coming inside. He was very nervous, but also kind of excited. Was it another sorcerer apprentice, or even a real sorcerer?A tawny owl flew in through the window and landed on the table. Somehow Lucien felt it had an arrogant-looking face.And the owl started speaking in a harsh voice.\u201cYou should open the window for me, you little boy.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLucien was not really scared. In the notes, the witch mentioned some animals that could talk. Some of them were sorcerers or sorceresses transformed into different kind of animals, while some of them were summoned pets. However, Lucien was not sure which one the owl was, yet.Strolling on the table, the arrogant owl looked at Lucien from top to bottom. Then it started talking again.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, boy. As long as you answer my questions honestly, Lord Doro won\u2019t hurt you.\u201dLucien nodded his head, feeling a bit confused\u2026Who was Lord Doro?The owl took a step forward and looked at Lucien\u2019s eyes, \u201cListen to my question\u2026 After the apprentice died, did any sorcerer or sorceress come here and asked you about her?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With different reagents, there were also different summoned animals. Some could be common animals like owls, cats or ravens, while some could be very powerful magic creatures like a Faerie Dragon.Once they were summoned, mysterious connections would be built between the owners and them. Thus, an owner could gain some special abilities based on the features of his or her summoned pet, and vice versa. As long as the pet was strong enough to handle magic, it could also use some of its owner\u2019s basic spells. For example, if one could summon a cat as his or her companion, the summoner usually would then have good night vision, and there would be also a significant improvement in the person\u2019s agility. Meanwhile, the cat could help its owner to cast some of the apprentice spells like Darkness and Organ Preservation, even some basic Necromantic spells.However, as to how many spells a companion pet could master, and how many times it could cast the spells depended on its owner\u2019s level. That was to say, the power consumed by a spell would not come from the pet, but still from its owner. If the owner\u2019s remaining spiritual power was not enough, the pet would not be able to use magic.A summoned companion pet could also grow stronger to higher levels, but the special abilities its owner gained would not be further improved along the process. If the pet died, or somehow the connection was broken, the owner would lose the special abilities deriving from the pet and even be injured.Lucien had never paid much attention to summoning spells before, because having a magic pet in the city under the nose of the church could easily bring him big trouble.A few seconds later, Lucien slowly answered the owl\u2019s question, \u201cNo\u2026 I didn\u2019t see any other sorcerer or sorceress.\u201dThe owl flapped its wings in satisfaction, \u201cVery well\u2026 You are indeed not lying. Lord Doro has been watching you for some time, and no one came or asked about her.\u201d\u201cSneaky little bird\u2026\u201d Lucien almost rolled his eyes.\u201cThen, the second question. What happened in the witch\u2019s secret chamber and what did you find there?\u201d The owl\u2019s big round eyes blinked.\u201cWell\u2026 I went down there with a few guards\u2026\u201d Lucien told the owl exactly what had happened in the chamber, except, of course, the part about the magic books being copied to his spirit library. No one would believe that there was a whole library in his soul anyway.\u201cWhat a tragedy for the guard! He lost his arm!\u201d The owl sighed, \u201cGood boy, Lord Doro\u2019s job is done now. Good night, little boy!\u201d Then it flew directly toward the open window and gradually disappeared in the darkness.Then Lucien finally realized that Doro was the owl\u2019s name. Without doubt, the owl had a master, and Lucien wanted to figure out who the person was.So when Lucien was talking, he left an almost undetectable mark on Doro, the owl, with his spiritual power. When he was sure that the owl had flown some distance away from his place, Lucien quickly put on his black robe and ran out of the door.It was very dark outside at midnight and the streets were quiet. Lucien spread his power out and soon detected the owl.The owl did not fly very fast. Lucien was a bit hesitant whether he should follow the bird or not. Doro didn\u2019t look like a very strong summoned pet, so Lucien was guessing that its owner probably was also an apprentice. But what if there were other sorcerers at the place?A few seconds later, Lucien decided to take the risk. After all, sooner or later, he needed to find other apprentices or sorcerers and join them. Such a good opportunity like the one sitting in front of him was definitely worth the risk. Furthermore, if Lucien found himself in a dangerous situation, he still had a level-two magic ring to help him, the Ice Revenger.Lucien followed the target and ran on the streets. At the same time, he kept some distance between him and Doro to make sure he wouldn\u2019t be noticed.About ten minutes later, Lucien saw the owl flying into a window on the second floor of a building covered by darkness. Carefully, he approached it, and was a bit surprised when he found out it was actually the Copper Coronet.Lucien put his Ice Revenger on the finger, and then carefully walked toward the back door of the pub. With some easy apprentice spells, he sneaked into the tavern and went upstairs. Luckily, no one was on the corridor at this time.Listening carefully with the help of his spiritual power, Lucien could hear a man talking in a low voice inside one of the rooms.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Listening to his owl\u2019s report, Smile was sitting in a rocking chair with a glass of wine in his hand.Then he closed his eyes and lay back on the chair, \u201cWell\u2026 It seems that the guy doesn\u2019t know the witch as well. Oh no\u2026 I have no clue now, not at all. How can I find the man from the Continental Congress\u2026\u201d\u201cSmile, as long as we keep collecting information\u2026\u201d Doro was trying to comfort him.While he was feeling depressed, there was a knock on the front door.Doro jumped to the bed at once and buried himself under the blanket, while Smile bounced out of the rocking chair and asked nervously, \u201cWho is it?!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking for Doro, the owl, and you, Mr. Smile\u201d A man answered in a calm way. His voice sounded harsh and cold.\u201cWhat?!\u201d Doro screamed and its big round eyes opened even wider.Smile\u2019s spell was ready, but he dare not launch the attack rashly on a stranger who he knew nothing about.\u201cI asked, who are you?!\u201d Smile repeated.\u201cI\u2019m a sorcerer, and I know the witch. Like you, I\u2019m also looking for the man from the Congress.\u201d The harsh voice paused a bit and continued, \u201cEarlier I heard your owl asking a young boy about the witch, so I followed your pet and came here.\u201d\u201cWhat?! It was Lord Doro\u2019s mistake! What a tragedy!\u201d yelled the owl.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSmile relaxed a bit. At least he knew it was not the church, or they would have broken the door at once, without any explanation.\u201cIf you\u2019re a sorcerer, you don\u2019t need me to open the door for you.\u201d Smile did not lower his guard though. If the man opened the door by himself, he could have a few more seconds to better cast defensive measures. Besides, he could tell from the spell if the guy was really a sorcerer, or a pastor in disguise. The two powers were different.Then, the door opened. A freezing cold and threatening power came into the place before the sorcerer entered.Smile took a step back. He knew he was definitely overpowered. None of his apprentice spells would be helpful when facing the other sorcerer\u2019s power. Then he saw a mysterious man wearing a black robe, whose face was hidden in the shadow of a hood.Lucien, on the other hand, saw the apprentice\u2019s face well enough, and realized that he actually met Smile before. When Lucien first visited Copper Coronet, Smile was the hooked-nosed man sitting beside the pub counter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He even thought it was possible that the sorcerer in front of him was a user of black magic.After putting on Ice Revenger, it kept infusing a steady cold flow into Lucien\u2019s body, strengthening his willpower. At the same time, Lucien could also sense the tension in the air built by the ring.With Ice Revenger, Lucien could be immune to all the apprentice-level magics working on his mind. The person who wore the ring could, at the same time, have the Frightful Presence buff forcing people surrounding him or her to feel frightened, which was usually a buff of knight.Without asking for permission, Lucien entered the room and closed the door behind him. Under the alert gaze of Smile, Lucien casually found a chair and sat down, then he started talking again in the pretended harsh voice,\u201cI knew the apprentice by accident. She made an appointment for me to meet the sorcerer who came from the headquarter of the Continental Congress of Magic. I was looking forward to meeting him to find the land where sorcerers and sorceress can feel free to study magic. But before the meeting, she died, and I never had the chance to meet the sorcerer. I was planning on asking the young lad named Lucien the same question as well, but your owl was a step ahead of me.\u201dKnowing that the sorcerer sitting in front of him was not his enemy, Smile finally relaxed. Rubbing his hands, he started explaining why he was also looking for the mysterious sorcerer,\u201cI met the her several months ago, and I invited her to our secret apprentice group meeting. Later she told us that she met a great sorcerer from the Congress. In her description, on the land where the Congress sits, all the sorcerers and sorceresses don\u2019t have to hide anymore. We were\u2026so encouraged\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand,\u201d Lucien nodded, \u201cWe are sorcerers, not rats. We deserve much better than this.\u201dSmile raised his head and started feeling close to this unexpected visitor. Sorcerers and sorceresses always understood their shared struggle and fear. Facing the same enemy, most sorcerers and sorceresses united to help each other and to escape from the search of the church.\u201cYes, sir. You must understand our excitement.\u201d Smile lowered his head and looked at his hands again, \u201cWe also asked her to invite the great sorcerer to come to our meeting. Although he didn\u2019t show up for the first time, the sorceress brought a journal called Arcana from him to us.\u201dLucien remembered the journal. It must be the same one the sorceress mentioned in her notebook.\u201cArcana?\u201d Lucien pretended he never heard of the journal before.\u201cYes, sir. When she first mentioned the Congress, some of us didn\u2019t believe it. After reading it, all of us started yearning for the place. The journal was old, very old\u2026 it was published about twenty-five years ago. But the ideas in the journal were amazing, way beyond imagination\u2026 It was like a new world.\u201d Smile\u2019s face lightened up a bit.A few seconds later, Smile continued in a depressed voice, \u201cBut she was found by the church before our next meeting. I know it was dangerous, but I still don\u2019t want to give up. I moved from Purple Lily into this pub, hoping I could find any clue related to the Congress. Before, I was afraid that the church might still be watching her place, so I waited for almost a month and finally sent Doro there tonight.\u201dLucien saw Smile\u2019s face was changing with different emotions\u2014excitement, astonishment, sadness and depression. He was pretty sure Smile was not lying. Hearing Smile\u2019s explanation, Lucien felt kind of disappointed, since he was hoping that Smile might know something more about the Congress.\u201cHer death is our loss.\u201d Lucien said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid the sorcerer you were talking about might get caught with her at the same time. A sorcerer from the headquarter can easily catch the church\u2019s attention.\u201d\u201cI guess so\u2026\u201d Smile nodded with a sad look.\u201cWhat a tragedy!\u201d yelled the owl Doro.\u201cSmile, can I take a look at the journal?\u201d Lucien was trying to see if he could find any information from it.Smile shook his head and replied, \u201cSorry, sir. The journal is not here now. We take turns to read it. The journal was very hard for us apprentices to understand, but I guess for a real sorcerer like you, it won\u2019t be a problem.\u201dThe power of the ring made Smile think Lucien was at least a sorcerer of the first or second circle, instead of an apprentice like him. Toward Smile\u2019s assumption, Lucien neither admitted nor denied, since Smile\u2019s respect might bring him some benefits.\u201cSo\u2026If you don\u2019t mind, sir,\u201d Smile asked Lucien with a bit hesitation, \u201cyou can join us. The journal will be passed on to another apprentice over the next meeting.\u201dLucien thought about the potential risk, but he also didn\u2019t want to miss the chance to find the apprentice group in Aalto.\u201cWhat do you usually do during the meeting?\u201d Lucien asked.\u201cAalto is the last city of ancient Sylvanas Magic Empire, and there are still many sorcerers and sorceresses teaching their apprentices secretly. Apprentices gather together to exchange information, magic materials and views. We work together and help each other.\u201d Smile explained.\u201cI see\u2026 But the church is watching us all the time. How did the founders manage to start the group at the very beginning?\u201d Lucien wanted to ask more questions to make sure it was not a trap.\u201cWell\u2026 there\u2019re several apprentice groups. Most apprentices here belong to one of them, while some join more than one group. The founders of our group first met each other by accident in the Melzer Black Forest when they were seeking the same magic materials.\u201d Smile answered in a patient way, \u201c\u2026I know you\u2019re very cautious, sir, and I completely understand. Every one of us all felt the same way when we first joined the meeting group. You\u2019ll see that it\u2019s a very secret group. Except the one who introduces you to the meeting, you can hardly can recognize anyone else there, because we\u2019d all dress like the way you\u2019re dressing now.\u201d\u201cIf you can join us, sir, it will be our pleasure. And I\u2019m pretty sure you can also find what you need there, at least we can try.\u201d Smile added.Despite the man\u2019s harsh voice, Smile felt the man in the black robe was not a vicious sorcerer, instead, he appeared to be quite calm and understanding. If their apprentice group could have a real sorcerer as a regular member, these apprentices, including Smile himself, could definitely benefit a lot from it. Even if the man was actually not as powerful as he appeared to be, Smile didn\u2019t think he would do any harm to the group.Lucien was persuaded. He knew sooner or later he had to find a group instead of always working alone, and the magic potions and reagents were also too tempting for Lucien to refuse, \u201cWell\u2026 My lab was damaged several days ago, if your group can provide me with a whole set of labware, I\u2019ll be more than willing to go.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be a problem, sir.\u201d Smile grinned.\u201cThank you, Smile. Then where is the group meeting, and when?\u201d\u201cThis Saturday evening,\u201d answered Smile, \u201cIt would be held in the sewers, but we haven\u2019t agreed on the specific location. Please tell me how to find you when we decide, sir.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t hold your meeting in the sewers.\u201d Lucien warned Smile seriously, \u201cThe church is lately keeping a close watching there. Don\u2019t ask me what happened there, and don\u2019t ask why I know this. Just tell all your group members not to go down there recently.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Smile was shocked. Even thinking about what would happen to the apprentice group if he hadn\u2019t met the mysterious sorcerer tonight made his heart beat really fast.\u201cWe can develop a set of code first. Then when you decide where and when to hold the meeting, find the eighth house opposite to the ruin of the apprentice\u2019s place and leave the secret code on the corner of the wall. It\u2019s easier and also safer for both of us.\u201d said Lucien.The house sat right beside auntie Alisa\u2019s place. It was very convenient for Lucien to see the code on his way.After agreeing on the secret code, Lucien stood up from the chair and was about to leave. Simile stopped him and asked,Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSir, can you give me your pseudonym? We don\u2019t use real names during the meeting.\u201dLucien thought for a few seconds and replied, \u201cWell\u2026 call me \u2018Professor\u2019.\u201dLucien slightly dusted his black robe and walked toward the door. Before he left, he turned towards Smile, \u201cI almost forgot\u2026 I\u2019m working on an experiment recently which requires Corpse Mushroom and Revenant Dust. I\u2019m running out of these two materials. If you guys can provide some, I\u2019d really appreciate it.\u201dThen he opened the door and stepped out of the room, \u201cGood night, Owl.\u201d Lucien nodded politely. \u201cOwl\u201d was Smile\u2019s pseudonym.Smile watched the mysterious sorcerer closing the door gently and heard his light footsteps downstairs. Like a dream, the room became quiet again, as if the man never had never been there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Again, with some easy spells, Lucien managed to leave Copper Coronet quietly and no one ever noticed him. Just in case, Lucien took a very roundabout way first, instead of going back to his place directly,Lying in his bed, Lucien felt kind of encouraged since now he was certain that he was not alone. He was comforted by the fact that there were still other apprentices working hard while carefully hiding from the church. He wondered how many apprentices, sorcerers, and sorceresses were there in Aalto in total.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the following few days, Lucien\u2019s life was pretty plain but peaceful. Lucien got up early in the morning to do some work out and then went to work. Sometimes he read music books, and sometimes religion and travel book, sometimes he read in his own spirit library and analyzed the magic structures.Although Pierre could be kind of weird sometimes, when he was reading his music books, Lucien almost couldn\u2019t feel his existence. And luckily, Wolf had been out of town for a while, and no one else in the association would ever give them a hard time.Life was almost perfect these days. The only pity was that Lucien didn\u2019t have a chance to see Ms. Silvia, the famous violinist who was still single. According to Pierre, she was a goddess-like lady and was very talented. Since Pierre kept mentioning her for countless times, Lucien also started feeling curious. However, Mr. Silvia didn\u2019t come to the association very often.While learning music, Lucien was still learning how to read, but the time spent on the latter was much shorter now, since he was learning really fast. Like the rest of the music students, after finishing the class, Lucien would stay at Mr. Victor\u2019s place and start another two-hour piano practicing. Lucien\u2019s quality of being persistent helped him a lot. He never stopped practicing until he had really sore fingers and arms and sweated a lot.The evening was reserved to the study of magic. Nothing could pull Lucien out of the magic world in this period of time.On Friday evening, what Lucien was on his way to auntie Alisa\u2019s place, he noticed there were some doodle-like patterns at the very corner of a wall. Lucien quickly understood what they meant.\u201cTen o\u2019clock. Saturday night. The abandoned house in the easternmost area in Aderon. Owl.\u201dLucien\u2019s expression did not change at all. He kept calmly walking toward Alisa\u2019s place as if he had seen nothing unusual.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lucien arrived at the place ten minutes earlier in his black robe, with Ice Revenger on his left hand. Before Lucien left his place, he also checked all the magic reagents in the pockets of the robe.There was neither moon nor stars that night. Thick clouds covered all the light in the sky.As soon as Lucien arrived, he heard an owl hoot in the darkness. It was Doro standing on the tall willow, serving as a sentinel. Under the tree stood Smile in a black robe. In order to let Lucien recognize him, Smile didn\u2019t wear his hood.\u201cWelcome, Mr. Professor.\u201d Smiled walked toward Lucien and put on the hood, \u201cI told the other members about you, and they were looking forward to your presence. Several apprentices also wanted to ask you for help with some magic problems. Of course, they will pay.\u201dKnowing that Smile was trying to test him, Lucien, however, didn\u2019t feel nervous. He was pretty sure that he was more advanced than most of his peer apprentices, although he couldn\u2019t guarantee that he was able to solve all the problems, \u201cI major in Astrology and Element magic. So if these are questions related to those, I shall be able to help them a bit.\u201dSmile nodded, \u201cThen please follow me, Mr. Professor.\u201dSmile stopped in front of the old wood door of the abandoned place. After knocking on the door in a unique rhythm, Smile mimicked an owl hoot.A few seconds later, a man wearing the same black robe opened the door slowly. When the man saw Lucien, he slightly nodded towards Lucien, \u201cThis must be Mr. Professor, then.\u201dLucien could tell it was not the man\u2019s real voice as well.\u201cYes, this is Mr. Professor,\u201d Smile\u2019s voice was also lower than the other night, \u201cand Professor, this is Fire Wolf.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Lucien lowered his head slightly and greeted him. His left hand stayed in the sleeve, and his Ice Revenger was ready.After walking through the living room and another door, Fire Wolf led them to the storage room. At the corner of the room, there was a staircase that led underground.A basement! He wondered why he never thought about building a basement under his shack, instead of taking the risk and going down into the sewers every time. And at the same time, he could build a bigger crypt in Melzer Black Forest for practicing more powerful spells.This was not a very spacious basement. Eleven low stools were placed surrounding a long table. Flickering candles sparsely illuminated the place. The other eight apprentices were already sitting there. All of them were wearing black robes.Lucien walked downstairs with great caution, followed by Fire Wolf and Smile. They closed the door of the basement before they sat down.\u201cEveryone, today we\u2019re honoured to have Mr. Professor here to exchange ideas and thoughts with us.\u201d Smile stood up and started the introduction, \u201cMr. Professor is a real sorcerer. I\u2019m sure our apprentice group meeting would benefit a lot from Mr. Professor\u2019s profound knowledge.\u201dThen Smile started introducing the apprentices present one by one, \u201cThis is White Honey, Morning Star, Reindeer, White Glove, Oak, Philosopher, Mercury and Hanger.\u201d\u201cThe honour is all mine.\u201d Lucien slightly bowed, \u201cPlease forgive me for being so direct. I come here largely because of the journal, Arcana. Can I take a look at it first?\u201d\u201cNo problem, Professor. Take your time and we can do random discussion first.\u201d Philosopher nodded and slowly handed Lucien a black hardback book. His voice sounded pretty old, \u201cBesides, I heard from Owl that you need a whole set of labwares and I brought them here tonight. I\u2019ll be glad to give them to you as a gift if you can solve a problem for me later.\u201dLucien didn\u2019t open the book instantly, but carefully checked the cover of the book first.There were a few separate silver lines joining together in the end on the black cover, which formed the word, Arcana, right in the centre. Under the name of the journal, a line of words wrote \u201cVolume 11, the year 392 of Saint Calendar\u201d. There were parchment pages inside it.From the content page, Lucien found there were twenty-four articles in the journal. The first one was Discussion about the Fifth Failure of Finding the New Planets. Lucien felt interested in it and started reading.\u201cThe theory of gravitation proposed by Douglas could explain lots of force field spells, even most spells of the Astrology school. Besides, the three laws of planetary motion also derives from that theory, which is of great significance for guiding the field of fortunetelling.\u201cBased on this theory, we have created many new and powerful spells. Thus we can say, if there are two major columns supporting the classical magic system, the theory of gravitation could be valued as the most important foundation for one of the columns \u2014 force field study.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u201cThere is still one question remaining to be demonstrated: The theory of gravitation enables us to figure out many guiding formulas, and thus we know that the continent where we live in also belongs to a planet. The planet keeps rotating and at the same time revolving around the sun, so do the rest of the planets in the sky. Following the formulas mentioned above, we can also locate these planets.\u201cHowever, no one, not even the greatest sorcerer or sorceress, ever managed to reach the planets using the most advanced space magic, including me. Even we can calculate the coordinates of them, we can find none of them in the presumed places in space.\u201cWhen I was trying to cast the advanced space magic, although I could not reach the planet, I could feel the gravity of the target planet from my presupposed transit spot. The planets are there, but at the same time, they are not there.\u201dWhen Lucien found out that the planets in this world could tell destinies, Lucien was already quite surprised. Now he felt surprised again, and very confused.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If there was no calculation mistake, the sorcerer should be able to locate and find the planet. However, including the author, no one ever managed to arrive on the target planet.\u201cSo weird\u2026\u201d Lucien thought to himself, feeling confused. Then he saw the author\u2019s introduction:Oliver Constantine\u2014Grand arcanist; Legendary archmage; Level three in the profession of \u201cthe Hand of Annihilation\u201d.\u201cIt looks like the title of grand arcanist is even superior than legendary archmage, and the two titles are not overlapping. They should belong to different evaluation or ranking systems\u2014the latter is decided by how powerful the sorcerer or sorceress is, while the former depends on one\u2019s contribution to the study of arcana\u2026\u201d Lucien was guessing. Then when he looked at the other authors\u2019 titles in the journal, his thought was proved right: All of them had two different titles, for example, \u201clevel eight arcanist, 9th circle Astrology mage\u201d, \u201clevel six arcanist, 8th circle Element mage\u201d\u2026 Lucien also noticed that, in most cases, the authors\u2019 levels in arcana were lower than their magic power ranks. Therefore, it seemed the achievement in academic study was even harder.Some of the rest of the articles were:\u201cStudy of String Vibration in Some of the Magics\u201d\u201cBrief Introduction of Differential Method and Infinite Series\u201d\u201cThoughts about Seven-bridge Problem\u201d\u201cThe Mutual Transformation Between Electricity and Magnetism in Magic\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cA New Element Detected by a New Method\u201d\u201cA Forever Debate: Whether Spiritual Power Exists in the Form of Wave or Particle \u2014 A Study of \u2018Spirit Storm\u2019\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026While Lucien was reading the book, other apprentices were observing him in secret.Half an hour later, Lucien already had a general idea of the journal.The study of arcana in this world could be understood as science on Earth. The development of mathematics and physics here was close to the one at the middle of the 18th century on Earth. Calculus had been basically built up, while there was a very rapid growth in the development of geometry. Also, the development in Mechanics and electromagnetism had been pushed further in this world. At the same time, some spells here were beyond the comprehension of Earth\u2019s science, for example, Space Jump.As for Element Magic, it was close to the development level of chemistry in the early nineteenth century on Earth. Researchers, or say, arcanists, had determined what particles made the elements and had realized that earth, fire, wind and water were actually not elements. Besides, they had started measuring atomic weight as well.But the journal was published twenty years ago, Lucien speculated that the current development level of arcana should be even more advanced.After he closed the journal, Lucien found that all the apprentices present were looking at him. He smiled and asked, \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting book. Can I keep it for about two weeks?\u201d\u201cAs long as you can answer my questions, Mr. Professor.\u201d The voice of Philosopher sounded very old.\u201cOf course, Philosopher. You may ask now.\u201d Knowing that the elder apprentice was trying to test him, Lucien was pretty confident. He believed that his knowledge should be enough to answer some apprentice questions.Philosopher took out a stack of papers filled with words and numbers, \u201cProfessor, since you specialize in Element and Astrology, I have some questions for you related to the first article in the journal\u2026 When I first met these formulas which can predict the orbiting of stars, I was so fascinated, but I couldn\u2019t understand how they were derived and why they actually work. Can you explain it for us, sir?\u201dIt seemed like a shared question for all the apprentice present. All of them turned around and were waiting for Lucien\u2019s explanation.Within Lucien\u2019s expectation, what Philosopher asked was related to celestial mechanics. He answered calmly, \u201cYour question is too big to be fully explained at a time, because it involves too many different aspects. Tonight I can explain to you the basic principles of the formula and how to use them, are you okay with it?\u201d\u201cSure, Mr. Professor.\u201d Philosopher answered politely.\u201cThis symbol represents gravitational constant. Some of you may wonder what is gravity. Well, gravity is the force that makes you fall back to the ground when you jump up without using any magic, the force that makes apples drop. These phenomena never follow the will of God, and they should not be taken for granted\u2026\u201dLucien was trying to make his explanation simple. And when the other apprentices interrupted him to ask why, he just answered in this way, \u201cIn order to explain this question, many more concepts and principles will be involved, and they can not be comprehended when you are apprentices. After you become real sorcerers and sorceresses, these questions will be easier to be studied.\u201dThat was actually because Lucien himself did not fully understand the underlying principles of the formula as well.Philosopher sighed with emotion, \u201cOne can never learn enough in the world of magic. Before I thought I had made some progress in this field, but now I just realized I\u2019m way far from that.\u201dThe rest of the apprentices also nodded. Toward these formulas, although the mysterious \u201cProfessor\u201d did not explain \u201cwhy\u201d, he indeed clarified \u201chow\u201d, from which they were provided with new ideas about how to analyze and construct many new magic structures.After Lucien finished his \u201clecture\u201d, Philosopher fell silent. After a few seconds, he grabbed his quill and started writing numbers on a piece of paper excitedly. Other apprentices were also lost in thought.\u201cMr. Professor, I want to apologize for suspecting you were a liar\u2026\u201d White Honey was a female, who did not speak very much before, \u201cYou\u2019re the most elegant and erudite sorcerer I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Although she was trying to make herself sound like an elder woman, she was too excited to hide her original charming voice.From her comment, Lucien, Smile and Oak immediately drew an important conclusion: White honey was a member of more than one apprentice group.Lucien answered in his pretended harsh voice, \u201cI accept your apology. But actually, I don\u2019t really care what other people think of me. My knowledge and power is always mine.\u201d\u2026\u2026Later, when White Honey, Smile and Oak were exchanging magic materials, Lucien also bought some of them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLaying the right hand on his forehead, Philosopher made a deep bow towards Lucien. It was the manner of the ancient sorcerers.\u201cI want to extend my sincere thanks to you, sir, my mentor.\u201d Philosopher said, excitedly, \u201cYour explanation solved many of my questions. I\u2019m hoping that, with your help, I can figure out how to analyze the key 1st circle Astrology magic, in order to become a real sorcerer. Mr. Professor, to show my appreciation I hope you can accept this set of labware. Besides, you can choose any one of my stuff here.\u201d\u201cMr. Professor, I heard that you need Corpse Mushroom, and I\u2019ve brought them here. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re willing to solve a question of mine\u2026\u201d Mercury was another female in the group, who sounded quite nervous but also excited.Other apprentices were looking at Lucien respectfully, hoping to learn more from him.Lucien started feeling that he was a real \u201cProfessor\u201d now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One was darker than the other two. She asked politely, \u201cYou can take them all if you\u2019re willing to answer my question, sir.\u201dCorpse Mushroom was required in many magic potions. The average price was about ten Nars. And the darker ones were even more expensive. If they were badly in need, the price could be doubled or even more.Lucien couldn\u2019t resist the offer. He nodded, \u201cAll right.\u201dMercury found the article in the journal titled \u201cA New Element Detected by A New Method\u201d and asked, \u201cMy question is about the basic elements\u2026 The author defines \u2018Tai\u2019 which is extracted from sunstones as an element in this article, but I thought only earth, fire, wind and water were basic elements\u2026\u201dHer voice was slightly trembling, as if she knew that the answer to her question would overthrow all of her previous knowledge about Element magic. In fact, the question was related to the important difference between the ancient and the contemporary magic system.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d After a while, Lucien finally responded, \u201cHonestly speaking, I\u2019m not sure neither. I studied the ancient magic system like all of you. In the past, I often found conflicts between some theories and my own experiment practices, and thus I started putting more thoughts on it. The reason that I\u2019m able to explain those formula is not because I already have a deep understanding of them, but because many of the corresponding questions have been existing in my mind for a long time, and the article just solved them.\u201dIt was very suspicious that a sorcerer who claimed himself to have nothing to do with the Continental Congress of Magic could understand all of the formula in the article, but Lucien was too excited to realize the fact when he first read the journal. Now he had to restrain himself a bit.\u201cThat\u2019s why I was only explaining the application of the formulas. As for the principles lying behind them, they\u2019re also strange to me.\u201d Lucien continued. He did not want to take even a slight risk of being suspected, \u201cThis article showed the process and the result of an experiment, with only a few formulas. I can only share some of my thoughts roughly toward the theories mentioned in it, but I can be wrong.\u201d\u201cNo problem, sir.\u201d Mercury answered firmly, and turned to the other apprentices, \u201cAnd I want to invite all of you here to join our discussion.\u201dThis kind of instruction could be very expensive. Without the questioner\u2019s permission, others were usually not allowed to listen to it. Important information sometimes would be protected by a special magic called 'secret communication\u201d in order to avoid eavesdropping.\u201cI heard that there has been a longtime discussion between sorcerers and sorceresses on whether the belief of four basic elements of the world is just a myth.\u201d Lucien started analyzing, \u201cMany believe that the real elements should be more abstract, and should be more than just four kinds.\u201dThe other apprentices nodded thoughtfully. Many of them had the same doubt as well when they were conducting magic experiments.\u201cI\u2019m not sure what are the real elements instead. But from this article, it seems like they have redefined element and found many new ones through different experiments.\u201dThe experiment in this article was an example. The author showed his way to find the new element \u2014 By using the 9th circle magic Fire Storm to bombard Sunstone in an enclosed magic circle, the author obtained a beautiful and pure crystal called Tai, which was both more flexible and lighter than Mythril.Lucien speculated that there was no periodic table of the elements in this world yet. But in this magic world, elements here were probably totally unpredictable.In order to show the conflict between the ancient element theory and real-life practice, Lucien took a few apprentice element magics for example. After hearing his idea, the rest of the apprentices present were very excited.\u201cMr. Professor\u2026 I, I believe you\u2019re right! Being explained in this way, many of my experiment questions can be easily solved!\u201d Mercury was very grateful, \u201cThank you so much, Mr. Professor!\u201dHanger, who was standing in the corner all the time, also could hardly conceal his excitement, \u201cMr. Professor, what about spirit? Is it also composed of certain elements? I don\u2019t have the materials you need, but you can choose anything you want in my bag.\u201dThe other apprentices now held no suspicion of Lucien\u2019s identity. They all firmly believed that Lucien was the most knowledgeable sorcerer they had ever met, and were all eagerly hoping that the great sorcerer could share more of his ideas with them.Disappointingly, Lucien shook his head, \u201cSorry, I haven\u2019t dipped into Necromancy, so I cannot answer your question.\u201dAfter putting the three Corpse Mushrooms into his pocket and taking Philosopher\u2019s suitcase, Lucien asked, \u201cDo you have extra Corpse Mushroom or Revenant Dust? I want to buy more, or you can ask more questions.\u201dThe brain tissue of the aquatic zombie was enough for about seven to eight experiments, and each of them would consume one Corpse Mushroom. Lucien hoped that he could collect the materials as much as possible.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSince the church has been keeping an eye on us for a long time and it\u2019s too risky to cultivate the mushroom by ourselves, Corpse Mushroom is very rare these days. Except Mercury, I don\u2019t think other apprentices here would be able to offer you more, Mr. Professor.\u201d Philosopher answered respectfully. He seemed like the leader of the group.Like White Honey, Philosopher was a member of another two sorcerer groups. But the other sorcerers and sorceresses he had met were all very arrogant. They would only help the other group members who could offer something they really want, or give instructions to their own apprentices. Therefore, he was very grateful for Lucien\u2019s help.\u201cCompared with Corpse Mushroom, Revenant Dust is even harder to find.\u201d White Honey added, \u201cThe formation of revenant requires strong grievance and resentment gathering in a certain way. Although using the blood of some evil creatures can summon revenants, the blood is even more precious than the dust itself; after all, this is Aalto.\u201dLucien was kind of disappointed, but he quickly moved on. Later he answered more questions raised by the other group members and got more materials and magic reagents in return. Lucien\u2019s knowledge earned great respect for him among the apprentices.Besides respect, Lucien also earned a whole set of magic labware, three Corpse Mushroom, many other magic materials and reagents. Just like the saying goes, \u201cKnowledge is Money\u201d.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Each of us is going to share our recent thoughts by presenting them to the others later. It would be our great pleasure to have you here.\u201d Philosopher hopefully asked.The discussion part was open to anyone. All of the apprentices present were hoping Lucien would possible make comments on their ideas. Even some random words from such a knowledgeable sorcerer could benefit them a great deal.For Lucien, the invitation was an extra surprise tonight. Although Lucien could understand many advanced formula based on his previous knowledge, he, on the contrary, was having a hard time analyzing some of the apprentice spells. Concealing his excitement, Lucien was trying to make himself sound as calm as possible, \u201cAll right.\u201d\u201cThank you, Professor.\u201d White Honey first showed her appreciation.It was a productive discussion, from which Lucien also gained a lot from the other group members. Many of his questions related to apprentice magics were solved and his knowledge gap was filled. At the same time, the other apprentices were also every encouraged to see that Mr. Professor was actually paying attention to their discussion.In the early morning, after exchanging some more information, the meeting was drawing to a close. Lucien was stopped by Philosopher when he was about to leave.\u201cMr. Professor,\u201d asked Philosopher hopefully, \u201cdo you mind leaving your contact information to me? So if we can find any Revenant Dust, we can contact you immediately.\u201dHowever, Lucien shook his head, \u201cSorry, I\u2019d rather not. Owl knows how to contact me.\u201d Cautious as Lucien was, he would never trust anyone easily.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Philosopher nodded disappointingly, \u201cWill you attend our next meeting two weeks from now?\u201d The other apprentices present were also waiting for Lucien\u2019s answer eagerly.\u201cI don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Lucien\u2019s attitude was ambiguous, since he did not want his attendance to be regular, \u201cI might be in Melzer Black Forest at that time, preparing some experiments. Anyway, I\u2019ll let Owl know in advance.\u201d But Lucien\u2019s vague answer was good enough for the members. At least this great sorcerer didn\u2019t refuse them directly.After Smile made sure that it was safe outside, Lucien and other apprentices left the basement in succession. Having the suitcase in his hand, and some new magic materials in his pockets, Lucien walked home with no companion. On his way home, Lucien spread his spiritual power which covered a certain range to detect if there was anyone following him. And all he found was a raven.He didn\u2019t feel even slightly relieved until he was finally back in his shack.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026One week later, using the magic which could turn stone into soil and mud, Lucien successfully dug a pit very close to his place. The three meters long, two-and-a-half meters wide pit connected to his shack with a small stone stairway was Lucien\u2019s new and also his first magic lab. Standing on a small stool, Lucien was carving lines on the wall with a silver dagger which came from the labware set. He was creating a magic circle in order to block energy waves caused by spell casting or magic experiments.In addition to that, Lucien cast some more magic circles to protect the lab. Using \u201cEcho Elimination\u201d, no one would notice that there was a basement under there by simply stamping on the floor. Other magic circles were used for placing magic traps which could be triggered when necessary.After the carving work was done, Lucien pulled out a small bag of black powder. The powder was made from Black Curving Vine and it could quickly stick to almost everything. Carefully picking it out with the dagger, Lucien colored these lines with the black powder, and then he poured mercury on them little by little. Amazingly, the mercury did not drip at all, instead, it was instantly absorbed by the power. Now the outline of the magic circle was very distinct.Pressing his palm in the centre of the pattern, Lucien spread out his spiritual power and activated the magic circle. The silver lines were lit bit by bit. After a burst of silver light, the magic circle completely disappeared in the wall as if nothing ever existed there at all.Lucien stepped down from the stool, feeling exhausted. Building a magic circle could be very tiring. The more troublesome part was that, ten days later, it had to be replaced with a new one when the power of the circle was gone. For real sorcerers or sorceresses, they could maintain their magic circle using their own spiritual power, or building much more complicated ones which could recover the power automatically by themselves. Some parts of magic creatures, like their fur, horn or blood, could also do the job.Then it was the last step. Casting the spell in an opposite way, Lucien built a long stone table from the soil. Placing all the glasswares and small stoves on the table, Lucien was more than happy and satisfied.The lab was ready. From now on, Lucien finally had his own place to practice spells and conduct experiments. Obviously, this basement, although not very spacious, was much better than the cold, stinky sewers.Standing on the stairs, Lucien nodded with great satisfaction. Then Lucien went back to his place upstairs and locked the entrance with magic after making sure the magic trap circle was also in position.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was already in the early morning. As soon as Lucien\u2019s head hit the pillow, he fell asleep. He had to go to work in the library a few hours later.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cLike I said\u2026\u201d Pierre stared at Lucien with concern, \u201cYou gotta control yourself a bit.\u201d\u201cI just didn\u2019t sleep well last night.\u201d Lucien shook his head slowly.\u201cBy the way, what musical instrument are you learning, Lucien?\u201d Pierre suddenly switched the topic.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Soon he will register the new musical instrument in the association.\u201dWhile Lucien had made some progress in learning magic, he never slacked off in studying music. After all, he needed a decent job to make a living, and more importantly, to disguise his identity. Being a musician would be ideal enough. After all, no one would easily suspect an elegant and young musician to be an evil and notorious sorcerer.\u201cHarpsichord\u2026 Piano\u2026\u201d Pierre repeated thoughtfully. Suddenly he became excited and dashed into the bookshelves. A moment later, Pierre came back with a book in his hand, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna need the book! I gained a lot from it! By the way, did I ever tell you that in four months I\u2019ll take the qualification test of the association? If I can pass it, I\u2019ll finally be a qualified musician!\u201dLike other associations, the Musicians\u2019 Association also practised monopoly. The evaluation of musician was completely controlled by it.\u201cNo, you never mentioned it,\u201d Lucien took over the book titled The Art of Harpsichord Performance, \u201cbut I believe you can do it, Pierre,\u201d said Lucien sincerely.In the next hour, Pierre did not give Lucien any time to study the book. Since he knew that Lucien was also a music student, Pierre tried to seize every chance to share his thought on music with his buddy.However, today was definitely not a good time for discussion since Lucien was too sleepy to follow Pierre. His eyelids were so heavy that he could barely keep his eyes open. Lucien did try to stop Pierre many times, but Pierre never let him have a chance to cut in.Fortunately, at this time, a lady wearing a long white dress and a black pillbox hat walked into the library. She was a very elegant lady, her waist was slender and her legs rangy, as if she just walked out of a fine picture.Lucien also noticed her long white stockings, which made the lady\u2019s legs looked even sexier. However, that was not Lucien\u2019s focus. Instead, he was thinking about where that rayon-like material came from. Probably it was a byproduct of alchemy?\u201cGood morning, Ms. Silvia,\u201d suddenly switching his attitude, Pierre greeted the lady politely and slightly nudged Lucien, \u201cAnything I can do for you today?\u201dLucien then realized she was the Silvia that Pierre was talking about all the time. Her long black hair was like silk, shiny and soft. Under her small lovely nose, there were cherry-like lips. For sure, she was very beautiful and graceful.\u201cMorning Pierre, I need to borrow several books. They are\u2026\u201d said Silvia with a sweet smile on her face. She had got used to people\u2019s special attention, so Lucien\u2019s long stare didn\u2019t bother her.Pierre\u2019s face instantly flushed with excitement, since he never expected that Silvia would remember his name. He nodded several times and dashed into the shelves again to get the books for his goddess.Lucien stayed behind the counter. A sweet and familiar fragrance slipped into his nose. Not until a few seconds later did Lucien realize that the smell was very similar to that of the black veil he found in the dump site, the expensive cloth called Black Nightingale.But Lucien couldn\u2019t make sure, and there was also no need for him to figure out whether Ms. Silvia was the veil\u2019s owner or not. After all, the smell was still slightly different.Out of nervousness and excitement, the more Pierre wanted to impress Ms. Silvia, the more clumsy he was. After a few minutes, he started feeling embarrassed.\u201cYou need my help there?\u201d Lucien turned around and asked. Then Lucien walked directly toward a bookshelf and pulled out one of the books Ms. Silvia was looking for in front of Pierre\u2019s face. Of course, it was not because of Lucien\u2019s good memory, but his amazing spirit library, which could even store the arrangement of the whole library.\u201cLucien!\u201d Pierre\u2019s mouth dropped open, \u201cWhen did you become so familiar with the place?!\u201dWith a pile of books in his arms, Lucien came to Silvia and asked politely, \u201cMa\u2019am, do you want me to take these books to the reading room?\u201dOf course, Lucien couldn\u2019t claim that he had no man\u2019s thoughts when he was looking at such a beautiful woman like Silvia. But Lucien knew that a romantic relationship was too luxury and impractical to be put in his future plans for now. Therefore, Lucien\u2019s indifferent attitude contrasted sharply with Pierre\u2019s nervousness.\u201cJust leave them on the table, please. Someone else will get them later.\u201d Silvia\u2019s voice was husky and sexy, \u201cWhat\u2019s your name? I never saw you before.\u201d\u201cMy name\u2019s Lucien Evans. I\u2019m new here.\u201d answered Lucien slowly. Then he added, \u201cI\u2019m Mr. Victor\u2019s student.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Silvia smiled sweetly, \u201cNo wonder\u2026 I heard that Mr. Victor had successfully improved harpsichord and named it \u2018piano\u2019. Please tell him that I\u2019m really looking forward to his concert, Lucien.\u201dThe quick change of Lucien\u2019s attitude was a bit strange for Silvia. When she just walked in the library, Lucien was staring at her legs like a pervert, while now it seemed that Lucien was not interested in women at all.After Lucien finished registering the borrowed books, Silvia thanked them and left the library. Lucien noticed that there was a lady wearing a black pillbox hat waiting for Ms. Silvia. Standing there straightly like a spear, the slim lady was taller than Lucien by about half a head. Behind the lady stood a beautiful young maid and an elegant middle-aged woman.Noticing that someone was looking at them, the poker-faced, middle-aged woman instantly threw Lucien a cold eye. At that moment, Lucien felt he was suddenly thrown off a cliff and all the colors of the world faded. As if the woman had a rough ocean in her eyes, Lucien couldn\u2019t stop trembling in front of the huge waves of the ocean.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLucien lost his ability of thinking. He didn\u2019t fully recover until he could only see the woman\u2019s back. The woman and the slim lady changed a few words and the latter looked back at Lucien with some amusement in her eyes. But Lucien could also feel the great pressure in it and her authoritative aura.\u201cWho are they\u2026?\u201d Lucien was astonished. He had never met someone like them before in this world, especially the middle-aged woman. It felt like her gaze could easily disarm Lucien completely.Pierre came close to Lucien and made a long sigh, \u201cSilvia, she\u2019s my goddess. I know\u2026 I was not very impressive though.\u201d Then he nudged Lucien, \u201cBut buddy, you can\u2019t just stare at Ms. Silvia\u2019s legs like that. That\u2019s\u2026 too much.\u201dBut Lucien paid no attention to what Pierre just said.\u201c\u2026Wait, why do you look even paler now, Lucien?\u201d Pierre asked, surprised.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Well\u2026 you were staring at her legs so impolitely, so one of her friends probably just gave you a lesson using her knight power.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 I wonder if the younger lady was Princess Natasha. Her power was so overwhelming. Except Princess Natasha, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s another female knight in Aalto who has such power. And the middle-aged woman standing beside her might be her guard\u2026\u201d Lucien said to Pierre thoughtfully.\u201cNo matter who they are, my friend, the noble ladies have nothing to do with you, and never will.\u201d Pierre patted Lucien on his shoulder, \u201cNoble ladies would never waste a second on common folks like us.\u201dAlthough everyone was endowed with the Blessing, offsprings of nobles always had a better chance of awakening the power. Therefore, nobles would never marry common people but only nobles in order to keep their blood pure.\u201cMs. Silvia is my goddess but is too far away from me. All we can rely on is music, buddy,\u201d said Pierre earnestly, although he was the one who flushed his face just now.In the following several hours, Lucien was being tortured by his sleepiness. At noon, Lucien refused Pierre\u2019s invitation of having lunch together and was going back home to get some rest.When Lucien was walking downstairs, he saw Elena was talking joyfully with a tall and young man who had shining blonde hair and a very well-featured, pretty face. From his fancy clothes, Lucien could tell the man was a noble.Soon the man bid farewell to Elena and walked upstairs, passing by Lucien. He was really a very good-looking man.Lucien came downstairs and talked to Elena half jokingly, \u201cYou have feelings for him?\u201d\u201cCome on, Lucien\u2026 You\u2019re my friend, and you can\u2019t tell that was fake smile on my face?\u201d Gently rubbing her face, Elena answered in a low voice, \u201cHe\u2019s Mekanzi Griffith, the second-in-line of the Griffith Family, Director Othello\u2019s student, and also, the no.1 playboy in our association.\u201d\u201cThe Griffith Family?\u201d Lucien heard the name before.\u201cYes, Griffith.\u201d Elena nodded, \u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, you know Lott, right? Mekanzi is his elder cousin. He\u2019s very good at playing harpsichord and violin.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 but why you don\u2019t like him? And why were you still pretending?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cWell\u2026 I know I shouldn\u2019t talk like this about a noble, but he\u2019s a bastard. As a notorious playboy, Mekanzi is known for his misbehavior. He especially enjoys conquering women who do not have interest in him, who treat him coldly. It is said that once there was a girl from a common family who refused Mekanzi a few times, in the end he, he\u2026\u201d Elena pursed her lips with strong disgust.\u201cBe careful, Elena.\u201d He said with concern, \u201cBut in a couple of years, you\u2019ll be married, I guess.\u201d\u201cGet married\u2026\u201d Elena slightly sighed and her eyes looked sad, \u201cAfter seeing so many elegant musicians and gentlemen in the association, now it\u2019s impossible for me to marry an ordinary guy.\u201dWhat Elena said was true. Once a person had enjoyed many delicacies, plain bread and water became hard to swallow.\u201cThen what\u2019s your plan, Elena?\u201d As a friend, Lucien did care about her.\u201cWell\u2026 probably to be a mistress of a noble or famous musician\u2026\u201d Elena laughed when she saw Lucien\u2019s astonished face, \u201cI\u2019m just joking! I\u2019ve saved some money and I\u2019m gonna learn music like you, Lucien!\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s really cool, Elena.\u201d Lucien was impressed. An independent and hard-working girl was always impressive.\u201cI know! Ms. Silvia is my idol. I wish someday I could also be an elegant and beautiful female music master like her. For such a music goddess, nobody would say that staying single in her age is a big deal, because she doesn\u2019t need a man at all \u2014 she has the world of music! Although I know many musicians in our association have a crush on her\u2026 well, Mr. Victor is not included.\u201dMr. Victor\u2019s wife had passed away almost ten years ago. Since then Victor remained single and put all his passion into music. Everyone in the association knew that, including Lucien.\u201cSo are you gonna be Ms. Silvia\u2019s student?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cI\u2019ll try, but Ms. Silvia rarely looks for new students.\u201d Elena nodded. Her green eyes were filled with happiness and excitement, \u201cOr I can be your student, Lucien, when you become a good musician!\u201d she smiled.\u201cIt will be my pleasure.\u201d Lucien also laughed.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026With plenty of magic materials, Lucien didn\u2019t attend the apprentice meeting for the following several times. He had copied the journal Arcana in his spirit library before he buried it at the foot of the wall to let Smile take it back.From the marks left by Smile, Lucien could tell they were pretty disappointed and were still looking forward to his presence. But Lucien did not want to rush \u2014 he still needed a few more weeks to fully absorb the knowledge that he gained from both the journal and the last meeting.\u2026\u2026Time went by. When Lucien was able to cast nine apprentice-level spells consecutively at a time and was very close to moving to the next level, intermediate apprentice, there was only one month left before Mr. Victor\u2019s concert was held in the Psalm Hall.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBeing uninspired, this musician again became anxious and fretful. The tune of the fourth and also the last symphony just wouldn\u2019t come in Victor\u2019s mind. Soon he got too stressed to teach so many students, so he had no choice but to suspend the class for those non-music students for a whole month.But his unusual testiness was still very obvious in the music students\u2019 eyes.\u201cBang!\u201dSomething that sounded like an ink bottle fell on the floor and all of the students downstairs raised their heads.

For a concert, four symphonies are enough. I don\u2019t understand why Mr. Victor insists on creating new symphonies, after all, he got so many good ones he wrote before to choose from.\u201d\u201cMr. Victor did pick out the best one, and it will be one of the four symphonies.\u201d Standing beside, Athy joined their conversation, \u201cBut it is also the only ready-made one from the four symphonies. Mr. Victor felt all the others are nowhere close to the best one. In order to present an excellent concert, Mr. Victor has to make sure all the pieces of music are equally impressive.\u201dRubbing his eyes, Herodotus sighed, \u201cMr. Victor always want to be perfect. His previous works were actually very popular among many musicians and nobles, or he would never be qualified to give a concert in the Psalm Hall. If we try, probably we can persuade him.\u201d He looked at Lott and Felicia, while Lucien, a poor student who could only play the simplest music for now, was subconsciously ignored by him.\u201cWhat do you think, Mr. Athy?\u201d asked Felicia. She knew that, among all the people in the sitting room, Athy was the one who knew Mr. Victor the best. After all, Athy had been taking care of Victor for almost thirty years.\u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Slowly, Athy shook his head, \u201cThe concert is of great significance for Victor. He wants to fulfill the wish of his late wife, which is to have a perfect performance in the Psalm Hall, thus he won\u2019t make any compromise.\u201d\u201cProbably\u2026 we can look for some potions that are helpful for him to relax.\u201d As an apprentice, Lucien\u2019s first idea was seeking the help of potions and drugs.\u201cNo we can\u2019t. Those drugs will slow down one\u2019s mind and cause the inhibition of inspiration.\u201d Athy denied Lucien\u2019s proposal seriously.\u201cBut we can\u2019t just let Mr. Victor torture himself like this,\u201d said Lucien with concern.\u201cThen what can you do, Lucien? Come up with a new masterpiece for Mr. Victor?\u201d said Herodotus with clear sarcasm. He never liked Lucien, \u201cIf you cannot, please shut up.\u201dLucien didn\u2019t feel really offended, instead, what Herodotus just said gave him some new thoughts. Mr. Victor needed his help, Lucien knew.When they were talking, Victor opened the door and walked downstairs, looking very tired. The students stopped their conversation instantly and looked at him.Victor\u2019s hair was messy, and his eyes red. \u201cI\u2019m going to the association to practice the first three symphonies. All of you come with me to see how the different parts of the orchestra cooperates. \u201dAlthough all of them were a bit relieved to see that Victor\u2019s mood had returned to normal, they knew the trouble still remained unsolved.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026On the fifth floor of the association, the orchestra was playing a magnificent symphony. The four parts of the symphony were integrated perfectly and together provided the audiences with a grand acoustic feast.As soon as the orchestra finished playing the last part, a cold applause came from behind. All the students looked backwards.It was Wolf.\u201cGood, very good. It looks like you\u2019re ready for the concert, Victor.\u201d Holding his chin high, Wolf still looked the same, arrogant and mean. Victor enjoyed a period of peaceful time when Wolf was out of town, and now apparently the happy time was over.Victor\u2019s face instantly darkened since he knew Wolf must have heard something. Before Victor said anything, Wolf asked with a fake smile on his face, \u201cI remember you asked for my advice before I left. Now I\u2019m back, so let me see your work.\u201d\u201cYou just heard it.\u201d Victor just wanted to cut the conversation short as much as he could.\u201cNo, I mean\u2026 all the four symphonies.\u201d Wolf lifted his eyebrows.\u201cWolf, you\u2026!\u201d Victor was very pissed off. Before his rage took over, two men walked into the hall. One of them was a white-haired old man, wearing a decent black suit and with a black cane in his hand; The other was the good-looking blond that Lucien met a few weeks ago, Mekanzi, who was Lott\u2019s elder cousin.\u201cDirector.\u201d Putting their argument aside temporarily, both Victor and Wolf slightly bowed to the old man.Victor\u2019s students also bowed following their teacher. It was Lucien\u2019s first time meeting Baron Othello, director of the association, who was also Mekanzi\u2019s mentor.In the law among nobles which was constructed over a long time, those noble offsprings who managed to awaken their Blessing in their blood and thus became royal knights were more qualified to inherit their titles, but it was not to say that the rest of them who failed to awaken the blood power could not be the next head of their houses. As a gifted musician, Othello was also the only son of his house, thus he rightly inherited the title of his family and became the Baron.\u201cVictor, I heard that you\u2019re having a hard time with the fourth symphony?\u201d Othello walked to Victor and asked him seriously.Victor nodded his head, his eyes lowered, \u201cYes, sir\u2026\u201dOthello slightly raised the cane in his hand along with his voice, \u201cYou must know how important this concert is. You\u2019re representing our association to play in front of Grand Duke and the princess, and you gotta make sure nothing will go wrong. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI do, sir. I will make sure every piece of work will be really impressive\u2026\u201d answered Victor in a low voice, \u201c\u2026at least I\u2019m trying my best.\u201dWolf gave Victor a loud snort on the side.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not asking for everything to be that impressive, Victor,\u201d nodded Othello, \u201cI\u2019m asking for a safe and smooth performance. I understand your pressure, but you cannot keep delaying like this. You have to hand in all of your music as soon as possible to give the orchestra enough time to practice.\u201d Then Othello paused a bit, \u201cWell\u2026 let me give you a deadline. By the last week before the concert, I want to see all of your work laying on my office desk. Any problem, Victor?\u201dVictor shook his head with great effort, \u201cNo\u2026 sir.\u201d He knew that if he still could not come up with the last symphony, someone else in the association would replace him very soon.\u201cI hope you understand why I\u2019m pushing you.\u201d Othello looked less serious now, \u201cI believe you can do it, Victor.\u201d The director nodded to show his encouragement and then walked out of the hall.At this time, Mekanzi approached Lott with a smile on face, \u201cMy dear little cousin, I hope you won\u2019t have any trouble with the musician qualification test like your teacher is having here. Although I\u2019ll be one of the examiners in the next three years and I\u2019m very looking forward to your violin performance, my integrity will never allow me to lower my standard.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need you to lower your standard.\u201d answered Lott, clenching his teeth.Then Mekanzi turned to Lucien, \u201cYou know what? As a pauper, how lucky you are that you may have the chance to be a musician. It\u2019s not really wise wasting your time on fooling around with girls instead of practicing your skills.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLucien was very confused when he just heard Mekanzi\u2019s comment, but soon he realized he was talking about Elena. Recently, Elena spent some time with Lucien in order to learn more about music.Then Mekanzi left and caught up with Othello with a lovely smile on his face. In the family of Griffith, as the second-in-line to inherit the title, Mekanzi always spared no effort to please the house master.\u201cOh my\u2026 Victor, you\u2019re still racking your wits about your last masterpiece?\u201d Pretending that he didn\u2019t know the fact before, there was a smile of triumph on Wolf\u2019s face, \u201cEnjoy, Victor. Enjoy your first play in the Psalm Hall, cause it may as well be the last.\u201dBefore Wolf left, he glanced at Lucien, \u201cIs this your talented pauper student, Victor? Well\u2026 wish him good luck with his qualification test in the future. After all, your reputation is directly related to his. What a poor young lad!\u201dWolf was amused by his own words. Laughing, he went out of the hall. While Lucien noticed that Victor\u2019s face was flushed and the blue veins on his hands stood out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With a long sigh, he turned around and said to Rhine and the rest of the orchestra, \u201cI\u2019m going back to my office to finish my work. Everyone, keep practicing please.\u201d\u201cMr. Victor, please don\u2019t push yourself too much.\u201d Rhine put down his violin and walked to Victor. His face looked serious, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can come up with a good melody with your current mood.\u201dVictor\u2019s mind was being bothered by fatigue, depression and anger at the same time. He nodded, \u201cThank you, Rhine. I just\u2026 need some rest.\u201d\u201cLucien, Lott, you two accompany Mr. Victor to his office. Felicia and Herodotus, you two keep practicing.\u201d Rhine said to the students.On the way to the third floor, Victor didn\u2019t say anything. Neither Lucien nor Lott knew what to do, so they just followed him silently.Before leaving the office, Lucien noticed that Victor was looking at a lifelike portrait hanging on the wall. On the portrait there was a beautiful young woman with a smile on her face. She had black hair and black eyes.When Lucien closed the door, Victor was still staring at the portrait like a statue.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026When Lucien and Lott came back to the practice room on the fourth floor, they saw Felicia and Herodotus were lost in thought.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lott tried to break the silence, \u201cAll director Othello asked was to give a smooth concert, Mr. Victor might feel less stressed now.\u201d Apparently, his words didn\u2019t help.\u201cCome on\u2026 I care about Mr. Victor\u2019s performance very much, okay?\u201d Lott hurriedly added, \u201cYou all saw my cousin Mekanzi. If Mr. Victor\u2019s concert can be a huge success, I can call myself the student of a top musician, which will help me with my qualification test.\u201dFelicia puckered her mouth a bit, \u201cYes, we are all linked to Mr. Victor. I\u2019m worried about him. If the concert goes wrong, I can\u2019t imagine what is waiting for him.\u201dOn the other side, Herodotus leaned his forehead against his violin, murmuring.Lucien got ignored again, but he didn\u2019t care at all. He was also busy with thinking. In order to repay Victor\u2019s kindness, Lucien was looking for a musical masterpiece from his world as a plan B. Before that, he had gone through all the songs in his spirit library to make sure there was nothing similar to what he was going to choose. The work was actually easier than Lucien thought, since all the songs were stored in Lucien\u2019s spirit library and he could easily search them in his storage. Then Lucien had to find a proper way to give the music to Mr. Victor.Fortunately, Lucien had finished the difficult part \u2013 translation. When Lucien was practicing reading music here, he marked many masterpieces from his world with the notes he had learned here.During this period of time, Lucien had a better understanding toward the music trend in this world. Being affected by the church, music in Aalto featured traditional structure and religious style. Lucien wanted to choose one that fitted the trend. Therefore, Bach came first to his mind since his music also had some religious taste.However, after comparing Bach\u2019s work with many musical masterpieces in this world, Lucien found they were somehow too similar to each other! He was glad that he was cautious enough.Then Lucien turned to Beethoven. Fortunately, none of Beethoven\u2019s work overlapped the music from this world. Lucien didn\u2019t want to waste much time on selecting, and thus he soon decided to use one of Beethoven\u2019s most well known masterpieces\u2014Symphony No. 5. Lucien still remembered when he first heard it, he was shocked by the great momentum of the symphony.The most difficult part that Lucien had to think about was how to \u201cgive\u201d it to Victor. Lucien couldn\u2019t just directly hand Victor a piece of paper with such an excellent music masterpiece on it, telling Victor that he found it in a book in the library. On the other hand, it would be even more suspicious if he claimed that he came up with the melody by himself, since a beginner like him writing a piece of symphony like this would obviously make no sense.Lucien wished he knew how to do hypnosis, but his current spiritual power was not enough to infuse a whole piece of symphony into Victor\u2019s mind.Finally, he decided to rewrite Symphony No. 5, but instead of revitalizing it, Lucien was going to \u201cdegrade\u201d it. Lucien needed to destroy the whole structure of the masterpiece but leave some fragments for Victor. Lucien was hoping that his teacher could get inspired from these fragments.After writing a small piece of melody down on the paper, Lucien sat down in front of the piano and heavily pressed the keyboard with his hands.\u201cDang dang dang dang!\u201dIt was so loud that Herodotus almost fell off his chair. Following the magnificent beginning, the rest part of the melody was like a disaster.\u201cWhat the heck are you doing?\u201d Lott asked while frowning his eyebrows.\u201cI want to help Mr. Victor. What I saw today made me feel depressed but also angry, and this combined emotion just gave me some inspiration. I\u2019m going to write it down.\u201d Lucien explained.\u201cWhat?\u201d Lott almost laughed, \u201cAre you saying you are writing a symphony?\u201d\u201cHow long have you been learning music? You don\u2019t really understand how to play piano yet!\u201d Felicia\u2019s voice became higher.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSpreading his hands, Lott replied directly. \u201cNo, you\u2019re not able to help Mr. Victor, Lucien. I understand your will but you are just a beginner.\u201d\u201cYou think everyone can write a symphony just because they have so-called \u2018inspiration\u2019?!\u201d Herodotus sneered, \u201cWhat you just played was rubbish. Stop showing off in front of Mr. Victor to please him, you jester!\u201d\u201cLucien, please stop.\u201d Felicia shook her head with depression, \u201cCan you just stop? Don\u2019t make the situation harder.\u201dBut Lucien also shook his head firmly, \u201cNo. I\u2019m inspired. I can write a good one.\u201dLott, Felicia and Herodotus were staring at Lucien as if he was a madman.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He could only press the keys one by one since the skills required in this symphony were far beyond his beginner level. Lott, Felicia and Herodotus felt there was a heavy hammer knocking on their heads. Their anxiety and anger were accumulating.\u201cEnough!\u201d Herodotus and Lott cried out at the same time.\u201cWhat?\u201d Lucien turned his head and looked at them innocently, \u201cMr. Victor asked us to practice. And I am practicing. Then what are you two doing here?\u201d\u201cLucien!\u201d Gripping his fists, Herodotus\u2019s face flushed with anger. However, he was too short and thin for a fight. Lucien had been practicing fighting for a while and was half a head taller than him. A few seconds later, Herodotus shook his fist in the air, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be punished by Mr. Victor for beating you up.\u201d Then he turned around and burst out of the practice room.\u201cSorry about the noise.\u201d Lucien shrugged his shoulder but had no plan to stop. He grabbed his quill again and wrote more music notes down. The melody now only contained small pieces of the masterpiece but most of it were Lucien\u2019s stupid creation.\u201cAre you serious, Lucien?\u201d Lott was looking at the ceiling of the room, rubbing his forehead.\u201cYou wanna have a look?\u201d Lucien was about to shove his piece of paper into Lott\u2019s hand but the latter directly rejected.Lott looked at Felicia, \u201cLet\u2019s go. Staying here for one more second will drive me crazy.\u201dShe nodded, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I need some fresh air\u2026\u201dFinally, as he wished, Lucien was left alone in the practice room. After locking the door, Lucien went back to work. He started adding more pieces from Symphony No. 5 into the melody, hoping that he could come up with a degraded version of Symphony No. 5 with lots of imperfection, and thus Victor could improve it to restore it to a real symphony masterpiece.In order to show the progress, Lucien had to provide many drafts. Also, Lucien needed to practice lots of times to make sure his poor playing wouldn\u2019t completely ruined the music, at least he had to show some of the value of the music in front of his teacher.In the following several hours, the drafts of many versions piled up on the desk and the pile was growing taller and taller. Playing many parts of the music over and over again, Lucien was sweating all over.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026When the sky became darker, Lucien stretched himself a bit and then left the practice room with a thick stack of paper in his hand.Lott, Felicia and Herodotus were sitting in the hall, watching Mr. Victor conducting the orchestra. When Lucien came in, they rolled their eyes simultaneously with antipathy. However, Lucien in turn gave them a big smile. Felicia shook her head with a long sigh.Sitting in the soft audience seat, Lucien closed his eyes and continued thinking about his work. Half an hour later, the rehearsal finished. Victor and Rhine came down from the stage and walked in front of them. Mr. Victor now looked much better.\u201cHow was the practice this afternoon, everyone? Any problems?\u201d asked Victor.\u201cLucien is the biggest problem, Mr. Victor!\u201d Herodotus answered instantly, \u201cHe\u2026 he was writing a symphony! A beginner! The noise was so horrible that all of us left the practice room in the end!\u201dRejoicing in secret, Lucien almost couldn\u2019t hold his smile back anymore. He had to thank Herodotus for letting Mr. Victor know what he was doing.\u201cIs that true, Lucien?\u201d Victor looked at Lucien with great surprise, \u201cYou\u2019re composing a symphony?\u201dSlightly raising one of his silver eyebrows, Rhine was looking at Lucien with great interest.Lucien nodded seriously, \u201cWhat I saw today and what I\u2019ve experienced before brought me some inspiration, so I wanted to write it down.\u201dGentle and kind as Victor, he didn\u2019t immediately scold Lucien for being to arrogant. Instead, he asked his student, \u201cCan I have a look at it?\u201d\u201cMe, too.\u201d Rhine cut in with great curiosity, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Lucien.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d Lucien handed Victor the whole stack of paper.When Rhine was reading Lucien\u2019s work, his thin lips closed tightly as if he was going to burst into laughter at any time. While Victor looked pretty serious.\u201cLucien,\u201d Victor gave the drafts back to him, \u201cI know you\u2019re doing this for me and I appreciate your effort. But Lucien, writing a symphony requires much more solid knowledge foundation than you thought. As a beginner, I suggest you start from the most basic theories for at least a few years before you actually write anything.\u201dVictor was gratified to see his student was trying to help him, at least the intention was good. Furthermore, the rest of the students just realized why Lucien did all of these. They suddenly felt Lucien was even more crafty and sophisticated than they thought.\u201cWell\u2026 although your work is still very\u2026 say, immature, there are a few highlights in it.\u201d Rhine was trying to comfort Lucien, \u201cFor example, this part.\u201d The exactly few bars that Rhine was pointing at came from Symphony No. 5.\u201cThank you, Mr. Rhine.\u201d Lucien nodded to him with appreciation, then he turned to Victor, \u201cMr. Victor, I know you do not agree with what I\u2019m doing, but I still want to finish it. No matter if it turns out to be good or bad, or even horrible, it is the first piece of music work in my life.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSimilar situations had happened more than once before. Victor knew how stubborn Lucien could be, and at the same time, Victor was very tired with his own concert stuff. Finally, he made a compromise, \u201cDon\u2019t let it affect your daily practice.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026After having Victor\u2019s permission, Lucien started working on his composing task almost every day. Adding more and more parts of Symphony No. 5 into his work, Lucien\u2019s gradual progress was hidden in the disturbing noise.In these days, Lott, Felicia and Herodotus were avoiding him as much as possible, while Mr. Victor was trapped in his office working on his last symphony. No one paid attention to Lucien.By the last week before the concert, after countless times of practice, Lucien was able to completely play his version of Symphony No. 5, although it was not exactly the same as and was much easier than the original masterpiece.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A feeling of accomplishment rose in his mind. Through the three weeks of diligent practice, now Lucien could play the masterpiece relatively fluently with some simple skills. Of course, it was not perfect, but Lucien believed that Mr. Victor could easily tell its value.\u201cLucien\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Felicia was standing beside the door with her hand on the doorknob, looking very confused but also surprised.\u201cFelicia, sorry, I didn\u2019t notice you were here.\u201d Lucien stood up and pushed the piano stool under the keyboard, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cThe song you played\u2026 was quite impressive. You\u2019ve\u2026 made great progress.\u201d Felicia looked away. She was not used to making compliments, especially to Lucien.\u201cThank you, Felicia.\u201d Grabbing his music sheets, Lucien walked to Felicia, \u201cI gotta go now. It looks like a storm is coming.\u201dIn the Month of Harvest (September), there was always a downpour every few days. The weather today was very muggy, and the sky was much darker than usual.\u201cYes\u2026 Sure. See you tomorrow, Lucien.\u201d Felicia was kind of distracted.When Lucien came downstairs, he saw Athy asking the servants to do cleaning there. Lucien walked toward him asked, \u201cMr. Athy, did you see Mr. Victor? I have something to tell him.\u201d\u201cMr. Victor just left for the cemetery. I\u2019m afraid he might not be able to come back until late.\u201d Athy was always polite and serious, \u201cWould you like to leave a message?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019m not in a hurry. Thank you, Athy.\u201d Lucien waved his hands. He could talk to Victor in person the next day. Tonight he had some magic experiments to carry out, which were his priority.In the last few weeks, Lucien managed to read the journal, Arcana, many times. With the help of the literature stored in his spirit library, his basic knowledge foundation grew more solid. Combining that with what he had learned about vibrational frequency, Lucien improved the spell \u201cHoman Oscillation\u201d and created two new apprentice-level spells.For most apprentices, the development of their spiritual power often was much faster than the accumulation of their knowledge. Lucien, on the other hand, was facing a totally opposite situation due to his background. His spiritual power was still insufficient for casting ten apprentice spells consecutively at a time.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the early evening, on his way to auntie Alisa\u2019s place, Lucien noticed that there was a new secret message on the wall.\u201cWe have news about the evil creatures. Tonight. Ten o\u2019clock. The same place,\u201d said the secret message.Lucien kept walking as though he saw nothing. In his mind, he was guessing the intention of this message. He never attended the meeting after his first appearance, so it seemed they were using the information to lure him.Another reason that Lucien was this cautious was the raven he saw last time on his way back home from the apprentice meeting. When Lucien first encountered the raven, he didn\u2019t put any thought into it, since there were countless ravens in Aalto. However, afterwards he recalled what he had read in the notes \u2013 raven was the most common summoned pet. The more he thought about it, the more concerned he felt. Now Lucien couldn\u2019t help worrying that the message might be a trap, in case it would probably have been set by the raven\u2019s master.However, the attraction exerted by the information was irresistible. Lucien always yearned for the Crying Soul potion, which could reveal the power hidden in a developed body. He had been looking for the ingredients for quite a long time. Now, he already had the Corpse Mushroom and the brain tissue of the Aquatic Zombie, so Lucien wanted to get Revenant Dust and Moonlight Rose as soon as possible. Except for using the blood of a revenant to summon another, Lucien couldn\u2019t come up with a second way to get any revenant dust in Aalto, especially under the watch of the church.Chewing his bread, Lucien was thinking carefully, struggling between his feeling of insecurity and his desire. Finally, Lucien decided to accept the invitation. However, before going there, he needed to be prepared.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Nighttime, in Lucien\u2019s lab.On the magic circle carved on the stone table, a cup-sized black container was being heated over the blue fire, in which a certain kind of thick red liquid was boiling.Lucien\u2019s face looked very serious. He was stirring the liquid in the container with a long ceramic stick. In his right hand, there was a test tube with some black liquid in it. Pouring it into the container, Lucien slowly mixed them up.Every drop of the black liquid brought a gauze of white mist. As if it was alive, the red liquid kept shrinking fiercely and became thicker and thicker, like gel. Lucien knew that a tiny mistake would cause a devastating explosion. He must keep concentrating.Mixing all the black liquid with the red one, Lucien pressed his right hand on the circle and use his spiritual power to change the way the circle worked. Many red thin lines emerged and covered the container. Meanwhile, Lucien started casting. A white beam of cold light showed up between his fingers and flashed into the container.Heat met cold, but the magic red lines prevented the gel from exploding, and it slowly became more stable.When the white mist around it slowly disappeared, only a small amount of flame-colored gel was left in the black container. Lucien carefully put the very thick gel into a glass tube and sealed it, which was the last step required to make the Flame Gel.Lucien found the making process in the witch\u2019s notes. According to her description, he guessed the Flame Gel should be as powerful as napalm.In order to improve its power, Lucien was about to add some nitroglycerin into the formula, but in the end he decided not to, because he didn\u2019t want to turn his new lab into a heap of ruins for being too hasty.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn a box in the corner of his lab, there were seven tubes, each of them containing different potions. Two of them were Flame Gel, two other were Storm, which was used for fast healing and boosting energy, and the last three were Brown Owl, which could accelerate the speed of spiritual power recovery.Lucien put all seven glass tubes, along with the Flame Gel he had just made, into the small pockets of his black robe. They were made specially for safely carrying different potions and magic reagents.Then, he opened his own notes lying on the table, in which he wrote down the structures and the principles of the two new apprentice spells that he had created. Based on his knowledge of vibration and frequency and after hundreds of tests, Lucien improved the spell Homan Oscillation, and thus he had his own new spells: one called Bat Screaming and the other The Professor\u2019s Oscillating Hand.After closing the notebook, Lucien climbed back to the room and lay down on his bed to have a bit of rest.Lucien left his shack that night at nine forty.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A storm was coming.Lucien purposely chose a different way, approaching the abandoned house from beside the tall willow, which took him more than ten minutes. Standing in the shadow, he did not approach the building immediately. Instead, he stayed there for a while and noticed there were three people dressed in black robes standing in front of the abandoned house.From their figures, Lucien could tell one was Smile and another one was Philosopher. However, Lucien could not recognize the third person. Thus, he did not lower his guard. Grabbing a black, weird-shaped magic reagent in his hand, he silently cast a spell.The thing in his hand started trembling faster and faster, and ultrasonic waves began to expand outwards in all directions.That was Bat Screaming, the first spell created by Lucien on his own.Lucien was inspired by bats using ultrasonic waves to detect objects, like a radar. By reading the witch\u2019s notes Lucien became aware that many sorcerers and sorceresses would hide their magic aura, which was brought by their spiritual power, on purpose to avoid being found by their enemies. When Lucien was learning the apprentice spell called Magic Aura Detection, he realized that the apprentice-level detection spell would be ineffective when facing corresponding defensive spells of higher levels.Thus, Lucien combined Magic Aura Detection with his knowledge of ultrasonic wave and created Bat Screaming, which could even detect objects with no spiritual power or that released no magic Aura.Of course, Bat Screaming could also fail if a sorcerer or sorceress knew the spell in advance. They would still have other ways to avoid being found. Therefore, choosing proper spells was of great significance in a magic battle.The ultrasonic waves were like invisible water waves spreading around Lucien. When the waves hit something, they would reflect back to the black reagent in his hand. Lucien kept focusing on the spell and gradually pictured the surroundings, as if he was observing all around him carefully in broad daylight.\u201cThe detection range has a radius of about 100 meters. And it is a three-dimensional detection.\u201d Lucien thought to himself, \u201cThere\u2019s an owl on the tree\u2026 yes, it\u2019s Doro. Well\u2026 there\u2019s a raven\u2026 the raven.\u201dLucien recognized the raven that he encountered the other night. This time, Lucien felt the magic power in this pet, but he could tell the raven\u2019s master was very cautious as nothing weird happened since he met it the first time. Its master was only watching and waiting for something.\u201cI should come up with an infrared spell, then I would be able to see the inside of the buildings.\u201d A new idea hit Lucien\u2019s mind. The black thing Lucien was grabbing was a dried bat pituitary, and after some time it turned into a small pile of ashes and slipped through his fingers. For now, his spiritual power was not enough to cast the spell without using the additional component.Lucien was still hesitant since he could not make sure who the third person was. At this time, the person started talking in a relatively loud voice, \u201cMr. Professor, I think you\u2019re here but you\u2019re still watching. I\u2019m White Honey, Mr. Professor. It was my mentor who found the trace of the evil creature. He respects your profound knowledge and he hopes to meet you.\u201dA moment later, Lucien walked out of the shadow and approached the willow slowly. \u201cNice to see you again, White Honey, \u201d Lucien nodded to her, \u201cIt\u2019s my honor winning your mentor\u2019s respect, but at the same time, it seems like your mentor doesn\u2019t trust me very much.\u201d\u201cMr. Professor\u2026?\u201d White Honey looked very surprised.\u201cThe raven. You know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d Lucien looked into the darkness.\u201cYou\u2026 you found Ashley?!\u201d White Honey looked in the same direction.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d White Honey wondered, \u201cIt\u2019s nighttime, and the magic light of the raven has been hidden on purpose. How did he notice Ashley?\u201dShe now felt that the mysterious Mr. Professor was even stranger.When Lucien looked in that direction, the raven on the branch started to fall to the ground as if it was suddenly struck by lightning. Fortunately, the raven spread its wings in time and swiftly flew away, disappearing in the dark sky.\u201cYou\u2019d better explain this, White Honey.\u201d Smile and Philosopher asked in great anger.White Honey lowered her head and apologized sincerely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t tell you about this. And I also brought some gifts to show my sincerity. My mentor\u2026 he just wanted to see Mr. Professor. If anything unexpected happened when Mr. Professor was hunting the evil creature, my mentor might be able to help as well through the raven, Ashley. Now Ashley just left.\u201dSmile and Philosopher were aware that in fact there was nothing they could do about what White Honey had done, since they did not know how powerful her mentor was.\u201cWell\u2026 hopefully it will be a lesson to you, White Honey.\u201d Smile cleared his throat a bit, \u201cIn Aalto, what your mentor just did can easily put him in trouble. Many of us will take your mentor as a spy from the church. I hope he isn\u2019t, though.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry, but I assure you he is not, Owl.\u201d White Honey apologized again.Lucien walked in front of them and asked in his pretended harsh voice, \u201cWhite Honey, now, can I know where the evil creature is?\u201d\u201cIn the old house of Baron Laurent, in the Noble District.\u201d White Honey replied, \u201cNo one in the last three generations of the house has successfully awaken the Blessing, and thus the status of the house has been declining. Furthermore, there are just few servants still serving the family. The other day, when my mentor\u2019s raven flew over the old house, Ashley found it was a bit noisy down there. Out of curiosity, it flew down and found the people in the house were having\u2026 a sex party.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Owl sounded very surprised.\u201cIn fact it was more than just a sex party. My mentor believed that it was an evil ritual. When the people were crazily having sex in the chamber, Baron Laurent was standing in an altar at the center of the place and seemed to be gathering some kind of unknown power. At that time, Ashley noticed the demon\u2019s smell in him.\u201dPhilosopher was more sophisticated than Smile. He nodded with thoughts, \u201cI\u2019m quite sure Baron Laurent is not the only one. Many nobles who failed to awake the Blessing or to get the Holy Water from the church turned to demons and other evil beings to seek power. Their titles are worth the risk.\u201dUnless a noble house violated one of the first ten articles of the Holy Law, the hereditary land and title of the house could forever be passed on to the next generations. However, if no one of the house could awaken the Blessing in a few generations, the house would start to decline. Other houses would gradually devour its land and leave the house with only an useless noble title. In the end, the house would disappear on its own and the nobles would become common folks. No one would remember the family\u2019s past glory.Lucien had his own guess about the party. He believed it was the heretical ritual of Argent Horn. After two months, Lucien believed that they started taking action again.\u201cDo you know how powerful the creature is? How can I get to the Noble District?\u201d Lucien asked.The area the nobles lived was enclosed by the inner city wall. At this time, the city gates were already closed. City guards would only open the gates for the nobles who lived there.\u201cFrom the scale of the altar, my mentor speculated that it should be a low-rank demon of an ordinary knight level. But before the ritual is finished, the cast shadow of the demon should be only of a high-rank knight squire level.\u201d White Honey explained. She did not think a powerful sorcerer with such profound knowledge like Mr. Professor would be in any danger when facing a cast shadow of a low rank demon.\u201cWhite Honey didn\u2019t know how to find Owl, so she found me first. I happened to know a secret passage to the Noble District, and so I came with them here tonight, hoping that I could be of some help. After all, Mr. Professor, your explanation and guidance helped me a lot.\u201d Philosopher lowered his head to show his respect, \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Mr. Professor, I am more than willing to kill it for you. It\u2019s just a low rank demon. There\u2019s no need for you to do this personally.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLucien was feeling concerned that the heresy might bring some unexpected trouble into the action, and having more helpers on his side was definitely a good thing. After thinking for a moment, Lucien nodded, \u201cThank you, Philosopher. After this, you may ask me a question.\u201d\u201cCan I go with you, Professor?\u201d White Honey wanted to join them as well. Ashley was gone, and so she had to watch the mysterious sorcerer for her mentor instead.At the same time, Lucien viewed her as a hostage. Thus, he instantly said \u201cyes\u201d.Smile also asked to join. He had his own thoughts as well\u2015he wanted to stay as close as possible to Professor. Then, he was also accepted.Guided by Philosopher, Lucien, White Honey and Smile headed toward the Nobel District.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Aside from them, only a few drunkards were loafing around aimlessly. However, Lucien and his companions did not lower their guard at all. They had to be very careful to avoid the night watchers of the church. Those church watchers were like hounds wandering at night, chasing after the scent of evil. The black gloves those watchers always wore were the shared nightmare of every sorcerer in Aalto.After ten minutes, Philosopher stopped and said to Lucien in a low voice, \u201cMr. Professor, we\u2019re here. The passage is in the house.\u201d The house was sitting on the boundary of the Noble and Aderon Districts, looking pretty plain, even old, and was enclosed by a few dilapidated buildings.Each of them examined the house separately to make sure there was no magic trap in the building, while Lucien used Bat Screaming and secured the surroundings. Then they followed Philosopher and entered the house.From the thick spider web hanging down from the girder and brushing his forehead, Lucien could tell this place had been abandoned for a long time. \u201cSome beggars used to stay here overnight. But recently, all the beggars in Aalto went missing.\u201d Philosopher said casually when he was walking.Neither Lucien nor White Honey replied. Only Smile asked out of surprise, \u201cAll missing? What\u2019s possible for the beggars to do? Where could they have gone?\u201d\u201cI have no idea as well, Owl,\u201d answered Philosopher, \u201cSome said this had something to do with the evil creature.\u201d While Lucien and White Honey remained silent.When they came to one of the bedrooms, Philosopher started removing some old crates which were hiding a secret entrance behind them. Cold wind came from the passage, but the air smelled fresh. That meant it was being used pretty frequently.\u201cHow does Philosopher know the secret passage? Is he one of the nobles?\u201d Lucien felt a bit confused. However, obviously, he could not ask that directly.When they all came into the secret passage, Philosopher prudently closed the entrance behind them. Lucien noticed many magic circles on the ceiling.\u201cPhilosopher,\u201d Smile noticed them as well, \u201cWhat are these for?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. In case of emergency, the magic traps will be activated to destroy the passage.\u201d Philosopher answered with a smile.\u201cI like your prudence.\u201d Lucien commended in his pretended harsh voice.\u201cI agree. I\u2019m feeling more assured now.\u201d White Honey smiled.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Another ten minutes later, Philosopher, Lucien, Owl and White Honey climbed out of the secret passage from a dark corner. Under the cover of the shadow of the tall trees, soon they came in front of Baron Laurent\u2019s old three-floor house.Beside the iron gate of the house stood a guard wearing a set of plain leather armor. Compared with the many guards on the other nobles\u2019 properties who were wearing silver chainmail, the single guard here was clearly showing the family\u2019s decline.\u201cOnly one guard is here. We can go in there directly.\u201d Smile proposed.\u201cLeave this to me.\u201d Philosopher took a step forward, \u201cLeave this to an apprentice from the School of Astrology.\u201d\u201cI agree. Philosopher can handle this.\u201d Lucien nodded under his hood.\u201cThen let me help you, Philosopher.\u201d Smile came closer to Philosopher.\u2026\u2026Luke was yawning in front of the big iron gate, complaining about the Baron in his mind.\u201cParty, party and party. Baron Laurent doesn\u2019t even have enough money to pay us guards. Ten Nars every month for standing here the whole night? Come on\u2026 The old Baron was paying my grandpa and dad twenty Nars a month!\u201dA sudden owl hoot interrupted Luke\u2019s thought, since it sounded a bit weird. \u201cGo and catch your mice! You nasty thing!\u201d Luke swore.Luke couldn\u2019t see anything in the darkness. However, when he turned around, he suddenly saw a ghost in a black robe standing a few steps away from him.Before Luke opened his mouth to scream, he saw the ghost\u2019s face under the hood: except for the two eye holes, its nose, mouth and ears were blurred together.The ghost slowly raised its head. It was looking at Luke through the two dark holes, in which there were countless stars. The stars were shining like a dream.\u201cStars\u2026\u201d Luke murmured. All of a sudden, he felt completely relaxed, as if he was facing the person who he trusted the most in the world.Philosopher clearly knew that Luke had been hypnotized. Walking closer to Luke, Philosopher whispered in his ear, \u201cWe are Baron Laurent\u2019s guests. Open the gate and let us in. Be quiet. Don\u2019t let other people know.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Luke slightly opened the gate following Philosopher\u2019s command, \u201cPlease, sir.\u201dCarefully, Philosopher, Lucien, Smile and White Honey went through the gate and headed toward the house.After they went in there, Luke did not close the gate. Instead, he turned around and started guarding the gate with great passion as if his chest was on fire! He did not know why, but he wanted to do more for the mister.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The house\u2019s wooden door of the house was tightly locked, and the heavy curtains were also tightly drawn. In the big hall, a number of naked or half-naked men and women were having intercourse. Men\u2019s gasps, women\u2019s groans, a sweet aroma and the smell of certain fluids were mixing together. The hall was warm, even hot.On the couches, carpets, and even on the long table, pairs of man and woman, man and man, woman and woman, were moaning during coitus. They were having sex as if they were totally crazy. Some women\u2019s dresses were rolled up around their waists, while some other women were completely naked, and men were humping them like beasts.Only one person in the licentious sex party was totally different. It was a middle-aged man in a silver robe. He did not join these people. Instead, he raised his hands up and closed his eyes, as if he was enjoying the moans and was listening to someone talking to him. His face looked extremely excited, lightened with ecstasy.Black mist gradually rose up from the crazy people and slowly gathered behind the middle-aged man. The man was standing in the center of the pattern of an argent horn drawn on the altar, from which many silver lines stretched out and enclosed the shadow. Then the shadow became darker and darker, mixing with the colors of pink and black. Gradually, it turned into a tall and big shadow with two horns on its head.\u201cAre you ready for my power?\u201d The shadow suddenly spoke.The middle-aged man, Baron Laurent, answered in his lunatic tone, \u201cThe Great Master of Argent, the forever lasting silence, I\u2019ve given my soul to you. Please, please endow me with your power!\u201dSlowly the shadow approached him and started entering his body, bit by bit.Laurent\u2019s face contorted. Obviously, merging was not a very pleasant process. However, the pain was suppressed by the ecstasy shining in his eyes.\u201cNo one can stop me now. No one can stop me from regaining the glory of my family anymore.\u201d Apart from the ecstasy, there were also tears in his eyes.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Outside the house, Lucien and the other three apprentices did not intrude obtrusively. They first had to make sure there were no magic circles or traps around.\u201cMr. Professor, it will take at least half an hour to eliminate all the magic traps here.\u201d Philosopher said to Lucien.\u201cNo, we can\u2019t.\u201d White Honey sounded nervous, \u201cWe\u2019re relatively late, and I can feel the demon already. We only have up to ten minutes. Ten minutes later, the demon will arrive in its complete form. Then we will be too late.\u201d\u201cGoing into the hall directly will also cost us lots of spiritual power as well to deal with the traps.\u201d Smile turned to Lucien, \u201cProfessor, you must have some more powerful spells that can eliminate all the magic traps at once.\u201dAll the three apprentices were looking at the mysterious sorcerer. Similar thoughts came in their mind. Although they all knew that the sorcerer was very profound, none of them ever saw in person how powerful the mysterious Professor was.\u201cIs Mr. Professor a real powerful sorcerer?\u201d\u201cHow powerful can he be?\u201d\u201cIs he even stronger than White Honey\u2019s mentor?\u201dLucien knew clearly what they were thinking. He was prepared. Under their gaze, he answered with confidence, \u201cNo problem, Smile. I\u2019ll handle this.\u201dLucien came close to the wall of the house and pressed both of his hands on it. Moving his lips silently, Lucien started casting the spell.Invisible waves spread out of Lucien\u2019s hand. The waves hit the wall instantly and were reflected back. The following waves thus became different.In Philosopher, Owl and White Honey\u2019s eyes, nothing happened. They exchanged worried glances with confusion but did not say anything.Suddenly, White Honey felt the earth was shaking.\u201cAre you trembling?\u201d Philosopher asked her at the same time.\u201cNot me.\u201d She answered with surprise.\u201cLook!\u201d Smile was pointing at the building, \u201cLook! The whole house\u2019s shaking!\u201dWhite Honey and Philosopher immediately looked in the direction of the house. The old three-story house was shaking forward and backward, and the movement was becoming fiercer and fiercer. They could hear the glasses were shattering.\u201cEarthquake?!\u201d White Honey wondered.\u201cNo, it\u2019s the house itself!\u201d answered Owl.\u201cMr. Professor?\u201d Philosopher looked at Lucien and was shocked.Lucien\u2019s hands were still pressed against the house\u2019s wall. His whole body was shaking along with the building. His lips were still moving.\u201cThe house\u2019s gonna collapse!\u201d White Honey took a step back.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPhilosopher could not believe his eyes, \u201cEven a third circle spell Fireball could not completely destroy a whole building at once! What is this spell?!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 is\u2026 this\u2026!\u201d Doro, the owl, was standing on Smile\u2019s shoulder, yelling.No one noticed when the raven caught up with them again. It almost fell down from the tree once more, because of the sudden shaking.\u201cWhat\u2019s the circle of this spell!\u201d The raven cried as well.Only Lucien knew it was just an apprentice spell, the Professor\u2019s Oscillation Hand. The spell could detect the frequency of vibration of a building and created a resonance to destroy the construction. It worked the best with bridges!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His distorted face was full of excitement and ecstasy.He could feel it. He could feel the shadow entering his body. His blood was running and crying, gradually changing his body.Forty years, forty years of waiting and dreaming. Today he could finally start regaining the glory of his family.The mixed moans in his ears changed into the applauses and cheers on his knight title conferring ceremony. However, at this time, the whole house started shaking all of a sudden.\u201cEarthquake?! It this a punishment?!\u201d Although Laurent had changed his belief in order to chase the dark power, in his mind, he still respected and feared the God of Truth. However, now he was just one step away from the great success. He could not give up at this point.The ceiling of the hall started falling. Chunks of stone and wood fell on the ground, and some of them fell on Laurent\u2019s head. Of course, he was afraid. The only hope he had was the dark power he was going to be endowed with soon.\u201cDo not panic, Laurent.\u201d The shadow spoke to him as if it could read his mind, \u201cIt will take another six to seven minutes for you to fully merge with me. If the house collapses, you will die. Stop the ritual at once. You\u2019ve got a small part of my power, which already rivals the top senior-rank knight squire. We can complete it next time.\u201dThe shadow spoke very fast. Within ten seconds, the shadow\u2019s thought had all passed to Laurent.Laurent was very angry. He could not stand watching his great plan being interrupted in the final stage. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not leaving!\u201d Laurent shouted, \u201cThe house won\u2019t collapse! The earthquake won\u2019t last!\u201dThe windows broke in the violate shake. The strong wind of the upcoming storm blew in the hall and instantly drove the sweet and dreamy fragrance away. The people who were crazy with their desire suddenly sobered up.\u201cMy god, earthquake!\u201d\u201cRun, run!\u201dPeople were yelling. Some were wearing clothes in a hurry, some were running towards the gate naked, while some were even trying to escape through the windows.The evil ritual took away their strength. They stumbled in panic and fear. One of the women slumped to the ground and was crawling towards the gate. The man who was having a pleasant time with her ran directly past the woman without a glance.Watching these people leaving, Laurent knew his ritual had ended. The silver lines on the pattern disappeared with the shadow. With an angry shout, he stepped out of the altar and joined the panicky crowd. On his way running towards the exit, he hurriedly destroyed the magic traps one by one.Behind Laurent, a man in black suit who was seemingly enjoying the sex party just now looked out of the window, with his face looking serious.\u2026In the shadow of the house, Philosopher, White Honey and Smile were standing there, looking at Professor with their mouths and eyes widely open. Taking back his hands, the mysterious Professor said to the apprentices in a very calm tone, \u201cThey\u2019re leaving the house. Be prepared. Hunt the evil creature.\u201d\u201cWhy not just make the house collapse, Professor?\u201d White Honey asked.\u201cI prefer not to,\u201d Lucien stretched his hands a bit, \u201cIf the creature dies in the ruins, it\u2019ll be quite inconvenient for me to collect the blood. On the other hand, the sound of collapsing will alert the church. We don\u2019t want this big trouble.\u201dHowever, it was not the most important reason. Actually, Lucien did not have enough power to make the house collapse completely. Compared with a bridge of simpler structure, the structure of a house was more complicated, and its vibration frequency also varied. Lucien could only follow one of them. Therefore, destroying a bridge might be within Lucien\u2019s ability, but definitely not a house.The power stunned Philosopher, Smile and White Honey. They never saw a sorcerer who could cast such a powerful spell without using any reagent. Now they had no doubt toward the mysterious and profound sorcerer, Mr. Professor.White Honey was the first one who calmed down among the three. With the help of a magic item, she started tracking the crowd,\u201cEvil light detected. Fifteen meters away from the nearest window. We move one meter to the left to better release the spells,\u201d she calmly said.Philosopher quickly moved to the left and said to Smile, \u201cOwl, cast Homan\u2019s Oscillation.\u201dHoman Oscillation was also a sonic attack magic, which used high decibel to hurt people. In the most serious case, it could even take a person\u2019s life. Other people nearby would get hurt in their eardrums and might black out.\u201cThen you use Silence Wall, Philosopher,\u201d Smile also answered calmly, \u201cTo prevent the night watchers from noticing us.\u201d\u201cMerged with a low-rank demon shadow. Senior-rank knight squire level. Five meters away. \u201d White Honey reported, \u201cNo acid and fire magic. I\u2019ll use Arrow.\u201d\u201cOne meter. Get ready.\u201d she said.Within just a few seconds, the first round of the attack plan had been made. That was the first time Lucien saw how the well-trained apprentices fought.In order to get out of the house as soon as possible, Laurent roughly pushed the guests in front of him away. In just a few seconds, Laurent came to the window, hit the glass with his body and jumped out of the house.At this time, a loud blast struck his head, as if he was hit by a thunder. All of a sudden, his head started buzzing and he felt bad nausea and dizziness. Losing his balance, he almost fell on the ground with his head.Before Laurent could see anything in the darkness clearly, a metal arrow directly shot in his right eye. His blood was darker than common people, with a special smell of sulphur. The great pain made him break out in a frightful yell but his voice was blocked by Silence Wall. Laurent finally realized the fact that he got attacked.However, it was too late. The second metal arrow flew directly into his throat. Laurent struggled a bit and soon his body stopped moving.Lucien couldn\u2019t believe that killing this evil baron who had just merged with a demon was this easy. He was also very glad, since casting a spell silently cost him more power than usual, and his remaining spiritual power was only enough for using about two apprentice spells.Beside the Baron Laurent lied several naked and half-naked women and men, all unconscious. The panicked crowd running toward other directions paid no attention to what just happened here.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUsing Mage Hand, Lucien and the other three apprentices started collecting the baron\u2019s blood. After putting three glass tubes of blood into his pockets, Lucien stood up and said to them,\u201cTime to go.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d Philosopher, White Honey and Smile answered.When they were about to leave, all of a sudden a man jumped out of the house from the nearest window like a ghost and dashed toward Lucien with a sharp dagger in his hand, aiming at Lucien\u2019s heart!He was waiting in the house. Now he knew it was the best chance to kill this powerful sorcerer! And he only got this single chance!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the men and women who were screaming and escaping had stopped at this time, the only thing they would see was a blurry shadow.Only a person who had awakened Blessing in their blood could be this fast. The person was a genuine knight!Within two seconds, the dagger already came close to Lucien\u2019s back.None of them realized what was going on behind them but Lucien. He suddenly sensed the great danger when the dagger was only a few centimeters away from him.However, Lucien knew he was no rival to the attacker. Also, it was too late for him to cast any protection spell, thus the only choice Lucien had was to fiercely leap forward as fast as he could.Although Lucien was smart enough to create his own spells, he was still of apprentice level, and a magic apprentice was not able to construct a spell structure using his or her spiritual power in one\u2019s soul, which was the premise of casting a spell instantly.Lucien was clearly aware that very likely he would still be badly injured, but as long as the attacker could not kill him in a single strike, Lucien would seize the chance to fight back with his Ice Revenger Ring.Suddenly, when the dagger was almost at him, with a loud caw from above a light appeared and instantly covered Lucien\u2019s whole body, protecting him like a chain mail.It was the 1st circle spell, Mage Armor.The spell was cast by the raven, Ashley, which was standing on the branch. Ashley was the pet of the genuine sorcerer. It could not only see clearly during night time but also borrow its owner\u2019s power and cast some of the spells.The armor was totally beyond the black shadow\u2019s expectation. But the momentum of the dagger was so fierce that even the magic armor cannot fully stop it. In the blink of an eye, the transparent armor broke into many pieces, shinning in the darkness. However, the shadow did hesitate for several seconds.It was already enough time for Lucien, and he knew it was his only chance. Lucien swiftly turned around and activated his ring. Three rays of cold light were shining in his left hand.Lucien activated the 2nd circle spell in the ring, Palmeira\u2019s Frost Blades!At this key moment, Lucien knew that the attack was the best form of defense.The ring also strengthened Lucien\u2019s willpower, or he would be totally stunned and lose the ability to fight back by the knight power of the attacker.The three rays of white light were shining, and they targeted directly the attacker\u2019s throat, chest and the lower part of the body.Facing the frost blades, the attacker quickly covered his body with dark flames, which were full of the evil power of tyranny and destruction. Although he could have used the protecting power 'shadow\u201d coming from Blessing, he decided to be more careful. The guy in front of him just ruined his whole plan. Of course he wanted to kill him right on the spot, but he had to guarantee his own safety first.Wielding the dagger, he precisely shattered the two blades targeting his throat and chest. At the same time, he brought up his right leg and melt the blade with the dark fire. The pieces of the blades scattered and were shining like falling snow.After solving all the troubles, the knight turned the dagger in his hand around and continued chasing Lucien. He also noticed two black balls shooting out of the raven\u2019s beak. It was another 1st circle spell, Magic Missile.This time the 1st circle spell would not be a problem for him, since his whole body was still covered by the sinister fire. Now the only thing he wanted to do was to kill this sorcerer in front of him who just destroyed his plan.All of a sudden, the tiny pieces of ice from the frost blades turned the air around the knight freezing cold. For a couple of seconds, he was frozen still and the two magic bullets shot him directly in the body.That was the power of Palmeira\u2019s Frost Blades \u2014 not only blades, but also the coldness of ice and snow.\u201cA level two knight!\u201d Ashley screamed.Philosopher, White Honey and Smile finally found out something was going on behind them, and then they saw the attacker.Without too much thought, both Philosopher and White Honey activated their magic items immediately.Waves of light spread out around Philosopher. Within the radius of ten meters, all the ordinary people quickly collapsed and fell asleep.1st circle spell, Sleep.A strong onset of tiredness hit the attacker\u2019s brain, but as a level two knight, the 1st circle spell was still not powerful enough to drag him into his dreamland. He shook his head and drove the drowsiness away with his willpower.But a powerful air blast followed and hit the knight right into his chest. With a big bang, the power threw him directly back into the house through the window behind him, with lots of broken glass scattering on the ground.1st circle spell, Force Wave, carried by White Honey\u2019s magic robe.\u201cHe\u2019s a level two knight. He won\u2019t die this easily.\u201d Ashley flew closer to Lucien, \u201cMr. Professor, keep attacking please.\u201dWhen Lucien was about to take out his Flame Gel, the old house suddenly started shaking fiercely. The ceiling was dropping and walls collapsing. Within only a few seconds, the whole house finally came down and buried the knight under the ruins.Lucien\u2019s spell already damaged the structure of the old house before, and with the heavy hit of the knight, now the place was totally destroyed.Boom\u2026Boom! The collapse of the house was extremely loud like an earthquake. And it was too late for Philosopher to block the huge noise.Instantly, all of them realized that they were in trouble \u2014 the Night Watchers would come soon.Now they did not have time to find and kill the knight attacker. Without any hesitation, Ashley, the crow, turned into a cloud of shadow and enveloped White Honey.\u201cSee you next time, Mr. Professor.\u201d said the crow.And then it flew away quickly and disappeared in the sky.\u201cWe gotta go now as well, Mr. Professor.\u201d Philosopher and Smile made a slight bow and also ran into the darkness.In their mind, Mr. Professor was so powerful that there was no need for them to give him a hand in this case. It was taken for granted that Mr. Professor would have assorted ways to get out of here easily.However, actually, Lucien did not.There was no time for being hesitant now, Lucien knew. He quickly turned around to find the entrance of the secret passage through which they just came here.A burst of thunder just arrived. Rain drops fell from the sky in a crazy way. The long-awaited storm finally started.Under the ruins, small clusters of dark flame were raised one by one. Quickly they burned down the pieces of the broken ceiling and stones, then a black figure scrambled to his feet in the rain.In the lightning, the man\u2019s face was revealed.He was Rosan Aaron, the head of Aaron\u2019s Gang.Aaron stared at the direction where Lucien disappeared and thought to himself, \u201cHe could not cast a spell instantly, which means currently he\u2019s still an apprentice\u2026 He is much weaker than I thought\u2026\u201dFor a few second, Aaron\u2019s mind was dominated by his anger, which almost made him try to catch up with Lucien and kill the guy.But soon Aaron calmed down. For now his priority was escaping from the coming night watchers. He needed to leave now as well.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lucien was running in the cold rain, feeling pain from the falling rain drops. Luckily the glass tubes and waterproof cloth worked pretty well. His magic reagents and potions were still fine in his robe.Lucien did not have any companion nor support. He was alone, running towards the secret passage.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLuckily, Lucien saw the entrance was just over there, hidden by the trees, bushes and grass.However, what Lucien saw was not only the secret passage, but also a man in white suit, his wet red hair sticking to his forehead.And he was wearing a pair of black gloves.The man was a night watcher.In the lightning, they saw each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was aware that Bat Screaming couldn\u2019t work well in such a stormy night. The only thing Lucien could blame now was his bad luck.The night watcher, wearing a pair of black gloves, was also very experienced in fighting with magic apprentices, sorcerers, as well as evil creatures at night. And the gloves he was wearing were also a decent magic item, enchanted with different demon-constraining spells. That was why there were not many night watchers from the church. Besides, every night watcher was by no means being unskilled. Some of them were high level squires, some of them pastors, and some were even knights.The night watcher firmly caught the first tube of Flame Gel flying towards his face. Being controlled by the maker\u2019s spiritual power, the gel was supposed to explode instantly, however, grabbed by his hand in the black glove, the momentum of explosion was suddenly stopped, like a fuse on fire suddenly being extinguished by a bucket of water.In few seconds, the second tube of Flame Gel followed. Unexpectedly, this time, the tube did not target the night watcher directly, but hit the ground and exploded fiercely before the night watcher could react. The fire of the explosion also set fire to the tube of gel he was grabbing. Immediately, the night watcher\u2019s body was covered with raging flame. Since the comburent was gel, even the pouring rain couldn\u2019t put out the fire easily.Lucien had no time to check if his enemy was down. He quickly ran to the entrance.Before he entered the passage, a great pressure suddenly struck his mind. He couldn\u2019t help shaking. Thanks to the ring he was wearing, at least he could still stand.Lucien subconsciously looked back and instantly realized what was going on there.In the bright lightning, the night watcher was still chasing him, with the upper part of his body covered with fire, but it seemed the pain was not bothering him at all. However, his skin had turned into pieces of scarlet scales, protecting him from further burning.The night watcher was a dark knight with an awakened Blessing, and his Blessing was called \u201cred dragon\u201d!With the help of Ice Revenger, Lucien did not panic under the pressure from the night watcher. He was calculating the distance between them.\u201cTwenty meters\u2026ten\u2026\u201dThen he threw his last tube of Flame Gel at the night watcher, who was only around five meters away from him. The great power of the blast spread fiercely and the wave separated them apart.While the night watcher took a step back, Lucien was directly thrown into the secret passage. Since there was a slope near the entrance, he kept rolling for quite a few meters in there.Lucien felt like he was struck by a huge hammer in his stomach and great dizziness took over his mind. A mouthful of blood just burst out.Lucien had to hurry, knowing that the night watcher would catch up with him in few seconds. However, he was also very confident, since he had a plan.When the night watcher was about to enter the passage, Lucien activated the magic traps set by Philosopher, which could instantly turn stones into piles of mud.In only a second, the entrance was blocked by the mix of stones and mud. The night watcher couldn\u2019t stop himself in time and ran directly into them. The last thing he saw was the sorcerer slightly making a bow, mocking him.\u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see, you wretch.\u201d The night watcher punched the mound of dirt with all the strength.\u2026While he was running, Lucien took out a tube of Storm and unplugged it. He needed the potion for fast healing and energy boosting. At the same time, he triggered the magic traps one by one to destroy the tunnel. However, he did not trigger all of the traps to prevent the night watcher from tracking him by following the sound.With the potion\u2019s help, Lucien managed to get out of the passage way faster. Then he removed all the remaining potions and reagents from the pocket of his linen shirt, and burnt down his robe, since his robe had a special herbal scent which was used for hiding Lucien\u2019s own smell. Lucien did not want to leave the night watcher any chance to somehow find him.When he finished doing all of these, Lucien went back to his shack and stored safely all the tubes and reagents. After drying his shirt and pants, he finally collapsed into bed, exhausted at the end of the day.He did not realize how weak he was until his head hit the pillow. Storm boosted the energy for some time but also drained him completely. He was not very worried about the church, partly because of the bad weather, and more importantly, Lucien was pretty sure that the church would focus on investigating the dead baron, Laurent, since obviously, he was more related to the heresy, Argent Horn.Soon Lucien fell into sleep.The rain was still pelting down outside.\u2026In the early morning, the rain did not stop.Lucien was awakened by the different sounds coming from the people\u2019s work in the neighborhood.He felt sick, and his body was very heavy, so Lucien decided to skip his shift this morning. The library was never busy, and Pierre was there all the time.Later, Iven was sent by his mom to see why Lucien did not show up for breakfast. Lucien made Iven go to the library to ask for a sick leave.Then Lucien went back to sleep and did not wake up again until noon. He felt much better, but still a bit sick. He had lunch with auntie Alisa\u2019s family and left for Victor\u2019s place.There were just three days left before the due time for Victor to submit his last piece of work for the concert.\u2026Ten in the morning. Victor\u2019s practice room.Victor was very distressed, feeling desperate with the new melody. Then he heard a knock at the door. It was Lott, Felicia and Herodotus, who were supposed to come in the afternoon.\u201cWhy so early?\u201d Victor was surprised.\u201cWell\u2026 Mr. Victor\u2026\u201d Lott was a bit hesitant, \u201cMekanzi asked me to tell you that\u2026 um\u2026 Baron Othello wants you to go to the association as soon as possible. The princess is there today. Her Highness wants to see your work, Mr. Victor.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201d Victor\u2019s face suddenly turned pale, but he could not speak a word.Then with a long sigh, he nodded, \u201cI will be there in half an hour.\u201d\u2026When Lucien arrived, Victor had already left his place.\u201cMr. Athy, where did Mr. Victor go?\u201d Lucien asked.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMr. Victors was summoned by the Princess in the morning,\u201d answered Athy, looking rather worried, \u201cHer Highness wants to know about Mr. Victor\u2019s three pieces of work for the concert today.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201d Lucien felt very regretful for being absent from work today.\u201cMr. Victor left around ten forty. If you want to wait, Mr. Victor should be back soon.\u201d said Athy.Now it was twelve thirty-five in the afternoon.\u201cNo, I need to find him now. Thank you, Mr. Athy.\u201d Lucien grabbed his umbrella and dashed into the rain toward the association.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These are all your good works from the past,\u201d said Othello with his eyebrows frowning, \u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting for you for about twenty minutes.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Othello\u2026Can\u2026 can I have some more time?\u201d Victor\u2019s face had a deadly paleness. His dim eyes had been losing focus for a while, and the musical notes were not making sense at all to him.Wolf was there as well, sitting right across the desk with Director Othello. A contemptuous smile appeared on his face, \u201cStop struggling, my friend. Just randomly pick one out, after all, they look pretty much the same to me. Mr. Othello still needs to have lunch with Her Highness later.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Othello took out his pocket watch, \u201cThe lunch will be at one o\u2019clock. I will give you\u2026 another ten minutes. If you still can\u2019t make a decision by then, I\u2019m afraid the association might need to have someone else for the concert. Wolf just came back from Ratacia Palace. He should be able to handle this.\u201dRatacia Palace was the royal concert hall of the Duchy of Orvarit.Wolf couldn\u2019t hold his excitement back, \u201cVictor, I\u2019m sorry to see you struggling. But we, as the musicians in our association, we should regard the interest of our association as the top priority. What do you think?\u201dVictor did not say anything. After another two minutes, Victor fell back into the chair and pointed at a piece of paper, \u201cThat one then.\u201dThe three words took away all his strength, but he also felt a bit relaxed. Victor did not want to spend more time and effort pursuing the piece of work which he had been working on for nine years.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Victor thought to himself.\u201cGood,\u201d Othello clapped his hands, \u201cI\u2019m glad you finally made the decision. I have some medicines that may be helpful your to mental state, but they can have some side effects. Anyway, I gotta take a little nap, you guys can leave now.\u201dAfter they left the office, Wolf threw a bitter glance at Victor, \u201cEnjoy your last chance playing in the Psalm Hall. Don\u2019t let your wife down in heaven.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Victor\u2019s face was a bit distorted with anger.\u201cMe?\u201d Wolf snorted, \u201cIt is you who will disappoint your wife, not me.\u201dThen he quickly walked downstairs.Victor felt very sick and his head became dizzy. Lott, Felicia and Herodotus, who were waiting outside, quickly came close to their teacher.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Felicia asked worriedly.\u201cI\u2019m okay. Just need some rest. We\u2019ll start practicing this afternoon.\u201d Victor answered in a weak voice.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lucien was running in the heavy rain.He had not fully recovered from his injury. Holding the umbrella, the wind was preventing him from running faster, but he had to. The earlier he could get to the association, the better his chances would be to give Mr. Victor the new piece of work before the princess saw the song list.Finally, he folded his umbrella under his arm, so he could run faster.He just wanted to try his best, he didn\u2019t want any regrets.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026It only took Lucien six minutes to get to the association from Victor\u2019s place, a quarter of the usual time.Twelve forty-one in the afternoon. Lucien pushed open the gate, soaked wet, with water drops falling down from his face on the floor.\u201cLucien!\u201d Elena approached him in a hurry from the counter, \u201care you all right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, Elena. Where\u2019s Mr. Victor?\u201d Lucien asked without delay.\u201cShould be in his own office. I saw Felicia brought him lunch,\u201d answered Elena.\u201cThanks!\u201d Leaving his umbrella at the gate, Lucien rushed upstairs.\u201cWhat is going on there?\u201d Elena wondered.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026It was Lott who opened the door, whose face looked pretty gloomy. Lott did not ask Lucien why he was there. He just nodded to Lucien.Lucien entered Victor\u2019s office. He saw Victor was sitting behind his desk, looking very absent-minded. The lunch tray was sitting in front of him, remaining untouched. Lucien saw Rhine was also there.\u201cDid Mr. Victor hand in the music list for the concert?\u201d asked Lucien.Lott, Felicia and Herodotus just ignored him. Only Rhine nodded, \u201cYes, the third one was from Mr. Victor\u2019s past work.\u201dTaking a deep breath, Lucien went directly to Victor and said to him aloud, \u201cMr. Victor. I wrote a great piece of music! I hope you can give me a chance to listen to it! I\u2019m sure my work can give you some inspiration! Can we change the list afterwards?\u201dLucien was too urgent and nervous to select his words. He sounded too direct, almost stupid.\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Herodotus was shocked.Lott walked to Lucien and was about to pull Lucien away from Victor\u2019s desk.Hiding his face in his palms, Victor answered weakly, \u201cNo, we can\u2019t. Director Othello went for lunch with Her Highness ten minutes ago. The list has been sent already. We cannot change it now.\u201d\u201cMr. Victor, it\u2019s raining heavily outside! Mr. Othello can still be on the way. We still got a chance!\u201d\u201cNo, we don\u2019t.\u201d Victor murmured like being in a dream. He was not listening.Being pulled back by Lott, Lucien did not know what to say.The rest of the students had given up as well.\u201cStop, Lucien. We tried, and that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too late. Mr. Othello must be in Ratacia Palace now.\u201d\u201cEven if he\u2019s not there yet, it is too late to write a new piece of symphony. We\u2019d better just practice what we have now\u2026 it can still be a success.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Lucien took a few steps back, feeling rather tired. Maybe it was the arrangement of God. Maybe it was God who prevented him from going to work in the association today.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s not my concert, not my business.\u201d Lucien thought to himself, and became gloomy as well, like the rest of the people in the office.However, when Lucien was sitting in the couch, images of Mr. Victor teaching him, taking care of him, and encouraging him for the past several months suddenly hit Lucien\u2019s mind. He was reminded of the hard work Mr. Victor, the other students and he had to practice for the concert, and of his effortful running in the pouring rain.However, looking at these people in the room now, why their efforts couldn\u2019t bear fruits?Lucien did not want to end up like this.As long as there was still a slight of chance, he couldn\u2019t just give up like this and accept the result. As long as they were still there, there had to be something else they could do instead of just complaining. As long as he still had hope and faith, he should keep fighting until the last second.And this was not the last second yet.Taking a deep breath, Lucien looked around the office and walked to the piano.\u201cWhat are you doing, Lucien?\u201d Lott yelled at him.Lucien did not answer him. Sitting in front of the piano, Lucien laid both of his hands on the keyboard.Even Rhine was very surprised. He had no idea what kind of music Lucien, as a new music learner, would present.However, the first several notes shocked all the people in the office.The notes were more powerful than ever. Victor raised his head up and turned to look at the piano, looking confused.The following several bars of the symphony came like an overwhelming storm, fast, intense and fierce. They were like the misfortunes in life, one after another, like huge raging waves in the ocean, like the continuous call to the battlefield, and like countless enemies coming for you.There were some bars of relief, but they were followed by even more intense and desperate struggles.However, the fight of the warriors never stopped. No one ever gave up. They kept fighting: Sailors were fighting against the monster-like waves on top of their ships; Soldiers were fighting against their enemies in the battlefield. People died in waves and arrows, in tears and blood, but there were more newcomers following.The students were shocked. Rhine stood up from the couch.Lucien kept playing with all his effort.Why give up? Why?They still had time. They could catch up with Baron Othello. If it failed, they could still persuade Princess Natasha with the charm of the symphony.Why give up?There was still a glimmer of hope. They couldn\u2019t just give up!The first chapter of the symphony grew more and more vehement. Lott and Felicia were shaking with both fear and excitement.Was it fate that made you give up, or was it yourself?Was it fate that beat you, or was it the difficulties and obstacles?The music was asking. The player was asking.Victor stood up straight. He felt the questioning. The question was addressed to him as well.Lucien\u2019s soul had just been entirely devoted to the music. More thoughts rose in everyone\u2019s mind:\u201cI want to have a peaceful life. I miss my family. But I somehow came to this world and lost everything.\u201cI saw people here burning a woman to death.\u201cI went through the sewers.\u201cI wanted to learn how to read and wanted a better life, but I was beaten by gangsters.\u201cI wanted to learn magic to protect myself, but being a sorcerer here in Aalto meant I had to risk my life everyday, wandering between light and darkness.\u201cDid I give up? Do I want to give up?\u201cNo!\u201cI\u2019ll keep fighting against the so-called fate until the last second of my life!\u201cI can change the fate. I can change my life!\u201dLucien almost had a heart attack. He just let all his emotion out. He wanted to speak out loud:\u201cWas it fate that made you lose hope, or was it yourself?\u201cWas it fate that made you lower your head, or was it yourself?\u201cIs it fate that decides your life, or do you choose your own destiny?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMe, Lucien, Xiafeng, will never give in to fate.\u201cI\u2019ll take fate by the throat and beat all the difficulties. I\u2019ll never stop moving forward!\u201dVictor stood up from his chair, both of his fists clenching tightly.P.S.The author: Thank you to my friend, Cheese Cat. It was he who wrote the many questions towards fate in this chapter. He did a better work than I did. Many thanks.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lucien\u2019s persistence and faith were on full display in his playing.Although Lucien was still a bit unskilled, it did not affect the audiences in the room. Felicia, Lott, Herodotus, Rhine and, of course, Victor, all felt what Lucien wanted to tell them, while they had different understandings.Felicia, as the only girl present, was holding her hands and twisting her fingers together. Her father did not inherit the family\u2019s title, so she almost gave up her music dream and married a random noble. She often doubted herself, asking herself if she could really make her dream come true, if her choice was right.Hearing Lucien\u2019s fully dedicated playing, all her worries came to her mind:\u201cCan I overcome all the difficulties and become a female musician?\u201cWill I be respected because of my own achievements and be able to choose my own love?\u201dShe did not know. The music thrilled her.Lott and Herodotus also had their own pressure in the family, and their fates were doomed as well \u2015 they would not be able to inherit the titles. They could indulge themselves hopelessly in wine and women, or they could do something greater, such as becoming great musicians.Lott\u2019s hands were shaking. The music reminded him of his cousin, Mekanzi.Herodotus took a few steps back. He had always been weak among his family.Even Rhine was feeling something. His face, which was always serene, was now lightened with excitement. He was beating time with the music, feeling the long-lost intense emotion.Victor was the most excited one among them all. His hands were clenching, his face was slightly distorted, and his whole body was shaking. The music reminded him of so many things in the past: his first failed concert; the encouragement from his wife; his hard work and his successful second performance. He thought of the great grief when his wife passed away, and of all his effort and the hard time Wolf and Othello gave him\u2026The music notes were like sharp arrows, going directly to his heart.Victor could tell the sense of insistence and stiffness in it.\u201cI failed so many times, and I recovered the same amount of times.\u201cThen, why give up this time?\u201cWinnie, is that you encouraging me?\u201dLucien started feeling tired. He knew it was because of the injury he got, but he couldn\u2019t stop playing. As a musician, or just a music student for now, it was his responsibility to finish the whole work.\u201cI\u2019ll let Mr. Victor feel it!\u201d He thought to himself.His listeners could tell he was exhausted, feeling rather worried. Lucien\u2019s playing was like walking on a tightrope, but it did not stop.Lucien seized the chance to have a bit of rest through the relatively softer and slow rhythm in the end of the first movement. And then the intense part came back again, which was just like a long battle.The second movement was more soothing, like sunlight driving away dark clouds and the raging waves in the ocean calming down, like the soldiers going back to their campsite for a short rest during the break.The following third and fourth movements were interwoven with each other, and the tune became pressing and overwhelming again.The sunlight disappeared and the dark clouds came back again; the seemingly quiet ocean was secretly building even bigger waves; The soldiers picked up their weapons and headed toward the battlefield.The greatest and final battle was about to come.The feeling of anxiety, worry and fear gradually accumulated with the development of the music.Eventually the storm came, throwing a fishing boat up above the raging waves and, in the next second, fiercely dropping it down. Faced with the power of nature, the little boat seemed so helpless and weak; In the battlefield, the final round was about to decide the fate of the soldiers, who were fighting, killing or being killed, but they were still brave.The fishing boat did not give in to the roaring waves; The soldiers were beating back their enemies.In the last movement, the music became gentle again, which sounded a bit grieved, as if the soldiers were lamenting their dead comrades in the battlefield, as if the sailors were missing their families in the waves.There came the darkest hour before the dawn. The listeners felt nervous again.What was waiting for them in the end? Failure or victory?Did they overcome the difficulties, or get completely defeated by the difficulties?Did they finally take fate by the throat?Or did they give in to fate?Suddenly, the exciting and splendid chapter arrived and directly struck the listeners\u2019 hearts. That was a chapter of great victory!Feeling excited and encouraged, Victor could not stop himself from raising his arm. He wanted to cheer, cheer for the sunlight driving away the dark clouds, for the sailors surviving on the fishing ship, for the soldiers successfully protecting their land!The rest of the listeners were feeling gratified and excited as well, as if they got the faith and power for themselves to fight against their own sufferings.Rhine, who always looked calmer than others, was also smiling.Lucien moved his hands from the keyboard and wanted to stand up, but found himself so weak. The playing consumed all his strength and energy.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d murmured Victor, as if he was asking Lucien, or asking himself.Rhine, Lott, Felicia and Herodotus all looked at Lucien, waiting for his answer.\u201cThis is fate.\u201d Lucien tried hard to stand up, and replied him.Rhine was the first one applauding, then followed by the rest of the students. Victor also joined them, applauding hard.\u201cThis is music, genuine music!\u201d Victor walked close to Lucien and commented.Lucien smiled, and he said sincerely, \u201cThank you, Mr. Victor. Since you like my composition, I wonder if I could have the honor of having you revise it for me. We can tell Mr. Othello and Her Highness that we want to alter the list. I\u2019m sure they would agree and you will find it a good piece of work for your concert, Mr. Victor.\u201dLucien\u2019s intention was clear to everyone in the room \u2015 he wanted to give his work to Victor and he was willing to give up the honor and fame he deserved. They turned their eyes on Victor, waiting excitedly for his response.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA mixture of emotions spread over Victor\u2019s face: ecstasy, relief, excitement, greed, hesitation\u2026 An inner struggle was going on in his mind.\u201cYou can put my name on the second position, if you want. I cannot refine it, and your work will be really important, Mr. Victor.\u201d Lucien tried to make his teacher feel less guilty for taking his student\u2019s work.After a while, with a long sigh, a smile appeared on Victor\u2019s face and he turned to Lucien.\u201cNo, I won\u2019t. It is yours. This is your great work. I already can see your name being registered in the history of music. Apart from God and Winnie, who are supporting me, I still have my moral creed. That\u2019s what Winnie appreciated most.\u201dThis was Mr. Victor, his music teacher. Lucien could feel the tears in his own eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If Victor was willing to revise it and recompose it into a symphony, it could possibly become one of the greatest works in the music history, the most brilliant gem on the crown of symphony! Even Felicia felt that what Mr. Victor just said was unbelievable.Waving his right hand, Victor stopped them and turned to Lucien again.\u201cMr. Victor\u2026\u201d Lucien realized that he couldn\u2019t persuade his teacher unless he cast a spell on him. He did not know what to say.\u201cThank you, Lucien. Thanks God.\u201d Holding his hand over his heart, Victor smiled, \u201cIt is the most touching music I\u2019ve ever heard. Thank you. Now I have a new understanding toward music. And\u2026 can I have the honor to present this great piece of work on the concert as conductor?\u201d\u201cThank you for your comment, Mr. Victor\u2026 Wait, conductor?\u201d Lucien was very surprised, \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u2026 It\u2019s your concert.\u201d\u201cDid anyone say that I cannot be a conductor on my own concert?\u201d Victor grinned.\u201cIdiot\u2026\u201d Felicia commented in a very low voice, \u201cMr. Victor is going to introduce your work to all the distinguished audiences on his concert.\u201d She envied Lucien for having such a great chance of gaining much fame within a short period of time. However, she also admitted that Lucien\u2019s talent did deserve this chance.After hearing Felicia\u2019s words, Lucien hurriedly said to Victor, \u201cIt is my great pleasure.\u201d\u201cI have a question for you, Lucien.\u201d Herodotus asked him from a distance, with his hands holding tightly, \u201cDoes the work really come from you? Yes, or no?\u201dThe rest of the people in the room just now realize that Lucien was only a very inexperienced music student. How did he manage to compose such an exciting, brilliant solo?Was he really a genius, a hidden gem?Everyone was looking at Lucien.Lucien did not know how to explain to them, and he also couldn\u2019t. With regard to being righteous and honest, he was no way close to his music teacher.Now, there was only one thing Lucien could do \u2015 stick to his plan.\u201cYes,\u201d answered Lucien, \u201cThe inspiration of the solo came to my mind a long time ago. At that time, I had not received any formal music education before I met Mr. Victor. I had no idea how to write down the pieces of tunes in my head.\u201dVictor looked at Lucien and nodded.\u201cThe inspiration came from my daily life, from poverty, desperation and struggle. Every time I saw other people dressing decently, or having fancy dishes, I wonder why that was not my life. I want to fight for my own future.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you came to look for Mr. Victor?\u201d asked Rhine.\u201cThat\u2019s right. But becoming Mr. Victor\u2019s music student was something out of my expectation. I never thought I could be so lucky. After all, I started from learning how to read, not music.\u201d Lucien answered, \u201cAlthough I met lots of difficulties in the past several months, I\u2019m really grateful for all the support and encouragement you gave me, Mr. Victor.\u201dLucien\u2019s real experiences and lies mixed together, which made his words sound more persuasive, \u201cI\u2019ve been working on this for more than three weeks, and I was trying to make lots of improvement during these days. Lott, Felicia and Herodotus are my witnesses.\u201dRhine and Victor turned to look at the rest of the students, wondering why they never found the value of Lucien\u2019s work.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Felicia looked at Lucien with a mixed feeling, \u201cProbably it was our prejudice that made us deaf. Actually, I can recall some of the pieces that I heard while Lucien was composing and practicing. At that time, Lucien was still working on it, and his playing was pretty\u2026 awful. So we did not really pay attention to it.\u201dOnly Lucien himself knew that his awful playing was made on purpose.\u201cAs Felicia said, our prejudice deafened us.\u201d Lott admitted, \u201cLucien, you are a genius. A great song like this usually takes months or even years of hard work.\u201dLott was very impressed with Lucien\u2019s playing. If his work had not been this good, maybe he would still feel a bit jealousy and angry, but now he saw the huge gap between himself and Lucien. He was well aware of the fact that being mean and hostile towards a possible great musician in the future couldn\u2019t bring him any benefit.\u201cThank you, Lott. But I am not a genius\u2026 It also took me many years\u2026\u201d Lucien tried to explain.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s okay to just accept praise from others, Lucien.\u201d Victor smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve never heard anything similar to this before. I believe it\u2019s your own work.\u201dRhine also nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve been traveling in many countries. It\u2019s also my first time hearing it. I believe it is your tough life which gives you the inspiration. Suffering made you a genius. Thank you for bringing this to us, Lucien.\u201dLucien\u2019s face blushed. While other people thought he was just being shy, Lucien knew that he was feeling embarrassed and ashamed.\u201cI agree with Rhine. Sometimes, without the many boundaries and limits in mind, a new learner might be able to better release his or her feelings and inspiration and create great works, flying free in the world of music.\u201d Victor took over the words from Rhine, \u201cI\u2019ve been working on my fourth symphony for nine years in memory of my wife, Winnie, but I was having a hard time since I was constrained by my past experience and what I learned from my teachers. I thought a symphony was not suitable for expressing personal emotions, but serious religious theme instead. Thank you, Lucien, You provided me with a new insight of my work.\u201dThen Victor turned around and clapped his hands with satisfaction, \u201cAll right, Lucien. Carefully write your work down and I will revamp it for you and turn it into a symphony. I will also talk to Mr. Othello to change the list. Then we need to do a lot of practice for the coming concert.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thus, music was always regarded as a symbol of light and hope, having nothing to do with darkness and evil.Besides, from the books he read and the conversations among Lott, Felicia and Herodotus, Lucien noticed the barrier between the church and the nobles. Although the nobles still revered God, the idea that religion and government should work separately started emerging in Aalto, the city where the church dominated almost everything..Therefore, Lucien was pretty sure that the church would not easily suspect a new musician from the association, which had a close relationship with both the nobles and the church.Lucien\u2019s only concern was that he might need to go through security inspection in the future, when being invited to attend concerts or evening parties. However, Lucien believed that if he could be relatively famous, there would be rare or even no security inspection toward him.Rhine took up a pile of paper and a quill from the desk and handed them to Lucien.Lucien grabbed the quill. Before he had the chance to write anything down, he suddenly sneezed. His hair was still wet, and several drops of water fell onto the paper.Victor just noticed that Lucien\u2019s clothes were still wet, \u201cYou didn\u2019t bring an umbrella?\u201dFelicia\u2019s face slightly blushed, since she could see Lucien\u2019s fit body underneath his wet shirt.\u201cI did. But the rain was too heavy. I ran all the way,\u201d answered Lucien.Victor was moved, \u201cLet\u2019s find you some dry clothes first, Lucien. I got several suits here. Some of them should fit you well.\u201d\u201cI can do part of the work for you first, \u201d urged Rhine. He took away the quill in Lucien\u2019s hand, \u201cGo and change your clothes.\u201dAt that moment, Rhine\u2019s fingers touched Lucien\u2019s hand. Lucien surprisedly noticed that Rhine\u2019s hand was even colder than his.\u2026In the changing room, Lucian dried his hair and put on Victor\u2019s white shirt, black coat, pants and leather shoes. By then he looked brand new\u2015black hair, black eyes. In the mirror stood a good-looking young man.\u201cLook at you, Lucien! You look really good in this suit!\u201d Victor nodded with satisfaction.Seeing Lucien in this decent suit, Felicia, Lott and Herodotus felt somehow Lucien looked more reliable now.Judging a person by one\u2019s appearance did not only happen on Earth.\u201cLucien, come and check if this part Mr. Rhine just wrote down is correct,\u201d asked Victor.When Lucien passed Lott, the latter said to him in a low voice with his standard, polite smile, \u201cHope we can exchange our ideas more often in the future.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d replied Lucien politely as well.Hearing their conversation, Felicia bit her lips with her white teeth a bit and made a tough decision, \u201cLucien, you have my apology. I am sorry that I was being really mean to you because of my prejudice. I hope we can get along well and help each other in the future.\u201dHer face blushed again.Only Herodotus was still standing on the other side, his head lowered and his eyes staring at the feet, without saying anything.\u201cNot a problem, Felicia.\u201d Lucien nodded and then walked toward Rhine and Victor.\u2026Three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Felicia saw that Baron Othello\u2019s coach stopped in front of the association building.Victor looked very pleasant, \u201cGreat work, everyone! We are such an efficient group, aren\u2019t we? The excitement I felt from the music is still lingering upon my mind. Although the rewriting hasn\u2019t been finished yet, the rest of the work is pretty detailed. I feel like it\u2019s ready to be registered with the association now. And I don\u2019t think changing the list will be a problem either.\u201dLucien knew that his playing just now was still not very skilled, and thus he believed that it was his emotions infused in his playing that moved his listeners.Following Victor, Lucien came to one of the rooms on the third floor, where an elder gentleman wearing glasses was sitting there.\u201cYou got your work done, Victor?\u201d asked the elder man.\u201cJoseph, not me, it\u2019s my student, Lucien. We want to get his great work registered,\u201d Victor answered and then introduced him to Lucien, \u201cThis is Mr. Joseph, a very experienced senior music critic. Mr. Joseph knows most of the music works in the world, including those of other nonhuman species like elf\u2019s music. At the same time, Mr. Joseph is also a pastor in training. He can tell if you are plagiarizing or it\u2019s really you own work. After that, Mr. Joseph will register you work with a time mark using his pastor power. Any work that comes afterwards which is similar to your work will be regarded as plagiarism.\u201d\u201cHow long have you been learning music after Victor?\u201d adjusting his glasses, Joseph asked, \u201cA pretty promising young lad, uh\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 about\u2026 three months.\u201d Lucien felt a bit embarrassed.\u201cYou must be kidding me.\u201d Joseph\u2019s eyes were full of surprise, \u201cThree months?\u201d\u201cTake a look at it first, please.\u201d Victor did not say anything else, but stood there with a smile on his face.\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s see what are we looking at here.\u201d Joseph felt like it was somewhat a joke.Soon the smile on Joseph\u2019s face was replaced by a serious look. His left hand was beating time when he was humming the music notes, as if he entered into a whole new world, or a fascinating story.About ten minutes later, with a long sigh, Joseph told Victor with excitement, \u201cWhat a great work! It reminds me of the years when I was helping the knights fighting against the evil creatures in the Dark Mountain Range. Oh those years, with courage, with faith and with hope\u2026\u201d\u201cI told you, Joseph.\u201d Victor looked proud.\u201cI\u2026 I still cannot believe it. You said it\u2019s your student\u2019s work\u2026 from this young lad?\u201d Joseph\u2019s glasses were slanted on his nose.\u201cLucien\u2019s a young lad who knows about tough life,\u201d said Victor. Then he shared some of Lucien\u2019s stories with Joseph.\u201cWell\u2026 I guess our association\u2019s gonna have another gifted musician then.\u201d Joseph was very impressed, but still found it unbelievable. He turned around and said to Lucien, \u201cIf you want to further prove yoursef, keep working on new music themes. About every two years, you gotta have something new to prove yourself.\u201d\u201cIn two years\u2026 I would have left Aalto already.\u201d Lucien thought to himself, while watching Joseph leaving a time mark with his pastor power on the music sheets.\u201cDoes your work have a name? It\u2019s sort of a trend now.\u201d Joseph raised his head.\u201cFate.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026After Victor and Lucien finished the registration, they came to the Director\u2019s office.Before entering the office, Victor suddenly smiled.\u201cI can\u2019t wait to see Mr. Othello\u2019s reaction to this.\u201dLucien realized that it had been a couple of months since he last saw this bright smile on Victor\u2019s face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Othello raised his head and asked, \u201cWho is that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me, Victor.\u201d Victor\u2019s voice sounded softer now.\u201cWell, come in then, Victor.\u201d Othello seemed to be in quite a good mood.Othello had failed to awaken the Blessing. In order to secure his title and fortune, he worked hard to please the Grand Duke and also Princess Natasha, who had already inherited the title of Violet Countess.It seemed like Othello had a pretty good conversation with Her Highness.Victor slowly opened the door and entered the room, along with Lucien.Othello raised his head with a bit of a smile on his face, which was very rarely to see. His black suit was still clean and tidy, without any stain from the heavy rain.\u201cVictor!\u201d Sitting behind the red desk, Othello talked to Victor with excitement, \u201cHer Highness is looking forward to your new concertos this year and the new music instrument, the piano! Do work hard, Victor. You don\u2019t want to let Her Highness down. Well, and this is\u2026\u201d Othello noticed the finely dressed young man following Victor, but he already forgot that he had actually met Lucien once before.\u201cI don\u2019t, and I won\u2019t, Mr. Othello,\u201d answered Victor. Then he slightly pushed Lucien forward and introduced him to Othello, \u201cThis is my student, Lucien\u2026 Lucien Evans. He just wrote his first piece of music and I am hoping that you can have a look at it. After all, it is known to all that you are such an authority in serious-style music.\u201dVictor wanted Othello to take a careful look at Lucien\u2019s work without any prejudice, so he did not tell Othello his actual intention directly.\u201cWhen did you have this new student? I never heard that before.\u201d Othello was still in his pretty good mood.When Othello took over the paper file and started reading the sheet music, very soon a serious look appeared on his face.Othello was very impressed by the beginning part. He could surely say that, in the past couple of decades, he never met a music work like this. After reading the first several bars, Othello could already tell that the following movements were going to be very intense and passionate.He was clearly aware of the fact that he was old. And he devoted pretty much all his life to religious music. Facing the new music trend in Aalto where many young musicians were trying to express their own feelings through music, he felt quite reluctant and disagreeable since he believed that music should be much more sacred than this.However, his heart was beating so fiercely when he was reading the sheets of music. After reading the first movement, Othello found the palms of his hands covered in a film of sweat as if he just had a fierce fight.He did not like this kind of music. He wanted to tear these sheets up to prevent this work from influencing more people. In his mind, authentic music should be way more calm, sacred and serious.At the same time, he couldn\u2019t deny the value of this young man\u2019s work. He knew that Music Criticism and Symphony News were holding an open attitude towards the new music style, and so was Princess Natasha.He also did not want to lose his manner in front of the younger generations, as a renowned, experienced noble musician.When the silence in the office started becoming more and more torturing, Othello finally dropped the sheets and talked to them, \u201cYou\u2019re very gifted, Lucien. I\u2019m glad to see that we\u2019re having a promising young musician. However, Lucien, what I want to remind you is that music is a sacred tool for us to praise the Lord. Music is something powerful and serious and we\u2019re supposed to serve the Lord with music. I hope you can put more thoughts and work into the authentic theme of music.\u201d\u201cI see. Thank you, Director Othello.\u201d Lucien was not really paying attention to his comment. In his mind, picturing a magic apprentice like him praising the Lord was a pretty funny joke.Victor was already satisfied with Othello\u2019s reaction. At least Othello did not say Lucien\u2019s work was not good. So he decided to take his plan a step forward.\u201cSir, I really appreciate Lucien\u2019s work, and I believe you can also see the value of it. Therefore, I want to present Lucien\u2019s work to everyone in my concert.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Without even thinking, Othello rejected Victor\u2019s proposal directly.\u201cWhy? Mr. Othello?\u201d Victor took a tough stance.Although Othello was a bit surprised with Victor\u2019s attitude, soon enough he believed that he understood Victor\u2019s intention. Othello thought that Victor wanted to use his student\u2019s work to increase his own fame and reputation.\u201cI showed Princess Natasha the list already. If we just change the list casually, Her Highness would think the association is not serious, not reliable. You want to do harm to the reputation of our association for your own benefit, Victor?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid it\u2019s just the reverse, Mr. Othello.\u201d Victor was very motivated, \u201cIf we have a better option, but choose not to present the best work to the Grand Duke and Princess Natasha, that will definitely harm the reputation of our association. And, Mr. Othello, if you insist\u2026\u201d Victor paused a bit, \u201cif you insist, I will bring the music sheets to Ms. Silvia and ask her to take them to Princess Natasha. I will not give up.\u201d\u201cVictor!\u201d Feeling challenged, Othello stood up from his armchair and stared at Victor angrily.\u201cMr. Othello,\u201d Victor tried to be a bit more gentle, \u201cGrand Duke and Princess Natasha hold no prejudice toward this kind of music style\u2026 Actually, they prefer this style. Sir, please think about what their reaction would be after hearing Lucien\u2019s work. I believe it\u2019s beneficial for you as well.\u201dOthello clearly knew that without the support from many nobles, this new music trend would not have gained its momentum so quickly.He was old, and none of his offspring had awaken the Blessing. Othello knew that he must prepare a good future for them to make sure the glory of his family could last. Besides, Victor rarely looked so serious and firm before. Even if he insisted on not allowing them to replace that part of the list, Othello believed that they would find another way out.Taking many factors into consideration, finally, Othello made his compromise, \u201cAll right. Two days before the concert, I\u2019ll be watching the rehearsal to make sure everything\u2019s going on well.\u201d\u201cOf course, Mr. Othello.\u201d Victor slightly shook his right fist excitedly.\u201cWell\u2026 I have to say that you have a very talented student.\u201d Othello glanced at Lucien, \u201cI wonder why I never heard his name before\u2026\u201d\u201cHe just became my music student three months ago,\u201d answered Victor honestly.\u201cThree months? What do you mean?\u201d Othello was confused.\u201cYes. He first started learning music three months ago.\u201d Victor was kind of expecting Othello\u2019s reaction.\u201c\u2026\u201d With his mouth half open, Othello was shocked.After a while, he suddenly stood up again and started yelling at Victor, \u201cAre you kidding?! Are you sure this is his work?!\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure, sir,\u201d Victor nodded and said, \u201cMy other students witnessed his gradual improvement and Lucien had a dozen of the manuscripts from his past work. Joseph has proved his work as well.\u201dOthello sat back down, panting and murmuring weakly, as if he lost all his strength.Maybe he was mourning for his past glory in his music achievement.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt took him a while to calm down. Othello waved his hand and motioned them to leave.When Victor and Lucien left the office, Lucien noticed a very familiar person. When he got closer, Lucien recognized that it was Corella, the high-rank knight squire who fought against the red-eyed mice together with him in the sewers.Corella was still wearing the silver chain mail and his face looked serious. Following Elena, Corella came straight to Lucien.Before Lucien said anything to him, Corella asked Lucien directly, \u201cLucien, tell me why you didn\u2019t come to the library this morning.\u201dBoth Victor and Elena were surprised. They never thought that the church would care about some random guy being absent from work for a single morning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, a series of thoughts came to his mind:\u201cDid the church find out it was me?\u201c\u2026No, it can\u2019t be. If the church had found this out, they wouldn\u2019t have waited until now. I was involved in the witch\u2019s trouble before\u2026 I must be on their list of suspects, but not on the top.\u201dLucien paused a bit and answered, \u201cI stood up late to complete the last part of my music work, then I felt very sick in the morning, so I asked for a leave. Now I\u2019m feeling much better. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cDid you see a doctor? What was wrong with you? Can anyone prove it?\u201d Corella questioned closely.\u201cNo one. I was not sick\u2026 I was just really tired,\u201d Lucien answered calmly.\u201cI can prove for him, sir.\u201d Victor took a step forward, \u201cEvery time when I finished composing, I felt the same tiredness.\u201d\u201cYou are\u2026?\u201d Corella glanced at him.\u201cMr. Victor is Lucien\u2019s music teacher, a musician.\u201d Elena introduced, feeling very surprised that Lucien could somehow compose a piece of music so quickly.Corella took out his quill and quickly wrote something down on his notebook, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Victor. You\u2019re Lucien\u2019s teacher, so your testimony cannot be fully trusted. I wonder if there is anyone else who can prove for him, or I have to take him back to the church to do a physical examination, just in case.\u201dLucien\u2019s face did not show any different, but his mind was being busy with finding possible excuses. For a few seconds, he did not say anything.\u201cI can also prove for this young man. I\u2019m the director of the association, Baron, Othello.\u201d Hearing the noise, Othello came out of his office, \u201cLucien just finished his first music work. It was great. He must have devoted all his soul and strength to it.\u201dAlthough Othello disliked this young man\u2019s music style, he still admitted Lucien\u2019s talent and effort. Besides, the upcoming concert, and also the association, needed Lucien.Corella nodded, and wrote a line of words on the notebook again.\u201cWith your words, Mr. Baron, I believe it\u2019s time for me to leave now.\u201dActually, Corella himself did not believe that Lucien would be the the one under the wanted-notice either. According to the information from the inquisition, they were looking for a sorcerer at least of the third circle. There was no way that an ordinary young man who was a nobody three months before could turn into an evil and powerful sorcerer so quickly.The cardinals of the inquisition did not put Lucien\u2019s name on the list in the first round either.Now there was a Baron speaking for Lucien. Pissing off a noble was the last thing he wanted to do before he became a real knight.Watching Corella leaving, Lucien breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cDon\u2019t let this bother you two. I\u2019m gonna be very demanding.\u201d Othello nodded to them and went back in his office.\u201cOh my god, Lucien, Mr. Othello said you composed your own musical work? Holy\u2026\u201d Elena looked Lucien up and down as if he suddenly became a stranger.Lucien just nodded with a smile.\u201cWhat is going on here? Why are you here, Victor?\u201d It was Wolf, who was walking downstairs.\u201cNothing.\u201d Victor shook his head, \u201cI just talked to Mr. Othello about a change in one of the pieces of symphony on the list.\u201dVictor knew that Wolf would know this sooner or later anyway, so he did not really care.Wolf\u2019s face suddenly darkened, \u201cYou got a new piece of work? It\u2019s impossible. You were that desperate several hours before\u2026Wait, how could Mr. Othello allow you to change the list? Did he allow you to?\u201dWith a series of questions, Wolf couldn\u2019t wait to figure out what was going on there.\u201cSince we met Mr. Othello\u2019s expectation.\u201d Victor shrugged his shoulder pleasantly.\u201cWhat requirement? Within several hours, you suddenly can meet Mr. Othello\u2019s requirement? It\u2019s ridiculous\u2026!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Victor blinked, \u201cIf the fact pisses you off, that\u2019s too bad. By the way, it was not my work, but my student\u2019s work. You said a pauper cannot become a musician. Lucien proved that you\u2019re wrong.\u201dPointing at Lucien, who was standing aside, Wolf laughed as if he heard a rather funny joke, \u201cAre you kidding me, Victor? This poor guy just started to learn music three months ago, and now you\u2019re saying that he composed a piece of music work that is qualified to be played in the Psalm Hall? If it\u2019s true, I\u2019ll fulfill my promise\u2026 I will never compose again but only do music criticism. But if it\u2019s not, you really have to apologize to me for lying.\u201d\u201cIf I were you, I wouldn\u2019t say this too soon, Wolf.\u201d Victor looked very serious, \u201cYou can laugh. But you will see on the concert. And then you will see Lucien\u2019s work in the library.\u201dWolf stopped laughing. He took a glance at Lucien and cursed, \u201cYou guys are just lunatic. I\u2019ll wait and see how you\u2019re going to shame yourself. We\u2019ll see if you can make my words come true.\u201d Before he left, Wolf glared at Lucien and added fiercely.Watching Wolf leaving, Victor commented, \u201cArrogance brings prejudice, and prejudice makes a person an idiot. Lucien, take a rest today and let\u2019s get started tomorrow. I\u2019ll talk to Mr. Hank and tell him I have to borrow you from him for a while.\u201d Victor smiled.Still feeling tired, Lucien nodded and said his farewell to Mr. Victor.After grabbing his umbrella, Lucien walked toward the gate together with Elena.\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that, Elena?\u201d Lucien was feeling a bit bothered with Elena\u2019s continuous gaze.\u201cHonestly, I feel like you\u2019re not the Lucien I knew before\u2026 I always knew that you\u2019re talented, but I still can\u2019t believe you can compose such a great music work on your own which is appreciated by both Mr. Victor and Mr. Othello.\u201dLucien slightly waved his hands, \u201cI guess I just got inspired somehow. Maybe my inspiration came from my past experiences.\u201dElena had no idea of how long it often took a musician to compose a piece of music. She slightly tilted her head and smiled, \u201cMaybe you\u2019re really a genius. I always trusted you, Lucien. Don\u2019t forget me as a friend when you become a really great musician.\u201d\u201cOf course I won\u2019t.\u201d Lucien also smiled to her and then left the association.Watching Lucien leave, Elena stood there for a long time and murmured to herself, \u201cWhy he\u2019s so talented\u2026?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Seeing Lucien\u2019s nice suit, Joel joked with Lucien a bit over dinner for suddenly turning into a gentleman. Then, Lucien went back to his place and fell asleep directly. He did not wake up until nine in the night.When Lucien woke up, he felt much better. Although he really wanted to start making Revenant Dust right now, Lucien knew he should not act too hastily, or it would be too risky.Taking another tube of Storm, Lucien felt more energized. Tonight he decided to refine his spiritual power using the power of the star. Hopefully he could become a real magic apprentice tonight.After becoming a junior apprentice, Lucien would be able to cast one more apprentice spell. The recovery speed of Lucien\u2019s spiritual power would be increased by a bit, and the ability to withstand Mind Magic would also be improved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Again, Lucien was using the power of the star to refine his spiritual power in the meditation world.Among all the stars, Lucien\u2019s Host Star was the brightest one, and also the easiest one for him to control.The light of the star slowly covered Lucien\u2019s soul. Lucien could feel his soul was being nurtured by the star and his spiritual power was improving.With the help of Storm, Lucien was more energetic than ever, so his progress was rapid. Soon, he felt his soul was filled with power. It seemed like the power was outstretching his soul to reach the stars. For the first time, Lucien realized that his soul could be solidified with power.Finishing the meditation, the illusion of the starry sky also disappeared. Lucien\u2019s mind was more sober and clearer than ever, and he knew he had become a junior apprentice. Although the change in his soul was too tiny to be observed by other people, Lucien\u2019s soul could now better withstand Mind Magic, recover from common injuries twice faster than before, and be more alert to the surroundings.However, the damage to his body from taking Storm and achieving the breakthrough was also obvious. Soon Lucien felt exhausted again. Lucien knew that he had to become a real sorcerer to employ certain spells prolonging his lifespan, or he would probably die in his early sixties.\u2026In the following several days, with Lucien\u2019s help, Victor successfully refined Fate and rewrote it into a piece of symphony work. After countless times of practicing, and also with the support of Rhine, finally their playing impressed Mr. Othello.Mr. Othello\u2019s applause lasted for a while in the music hall, \u201cIt\u2019s an awesome piece of work. It\u2019s gonna make a stir in the audience. Victor, you really have a good student.\u201d\u201cAnd you, Lucien,\u201d Othello turned around, \u201cyou\u2019re indeed talented. But remember, becoming famous at such young age can be risky.\u201dOthello slightly shook his head, still feeling disappointed that Lucien would not devote himself to religious music, and then he left.\u201cI think what Othello said was right, Lucien.\u201d Victor seemed to be a bit concerned, \u201cYou\u2019ll be facing lots of pressure, mostly because of me.\u201d\u201cPlease do not worry, Mr. Victor.\u201d Lucien comforted him, \u201cI\u2019ll be driven by pressure and you know I can handle it pretty well.\u201dLucien had his own plan: If he could really become famous, he would be able to meet more people from higher status. It would be very beneficial for him to get some precious magic materials such as Moonlight Rose Dust and to earn more Thales to support himself.\u201cI do believe in you,\u201d Victor nodded, \u201cand after the concert, your top priority will be practicing piano, which will definitely be your most important skill as a good musician. I\u2019ll try my best to help you stay focused.\u201dThen Victor switched the topic, \u201cIf you want, Lucien, you can invite some of your families or friends to the concert.\u201d\u201cReally?! But I heard that one ticket for a Psalm Hall Concert is worth at least a Thale\u2026 it\u2019s like a whole-year saving for a common family.\u201d Lucien felt it was too good to be true.\u201cYes, it is, but you\u2019ve made a great contribution to the concert, so you deserve this.\u201d Victor smiled, \u201cThe leading musician, the conductor and the chief instrumentalist of a Psalm Hall Concert always have some extra tickets for their families and friends. It\u2019s pretty nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s awesome, Mr. Victor! Thanks a lot!\u201d Lucien was very excited, as he still remembered uncle Joel\u2019s music dream. \u201cCan I bring five people there?\u201d Lucien was thinking about uncle Joel, auntie Alisa, John, Iven and Elena.\u201cWell\u2026 It seems like you relate pretty well to people, Lucien.\u201d Victor grinned, \u201cI got this covered. No worries.\u201d\u2026\u201cSeriously, the Psalm Hall? The one in Aalto?\u201d Alisa could not believe her ears.\u201cYes, it is. Will you go there?\u201d Lucien asked the family again with a smile on his face.\u201cFor sure we will, Lucien.\u201d Joel was feeling very excited but also confused, \u201cBut we are\u2026 we are not qualified for going there, are we? I thought only families and friends of the musicians of the concert were invited.\u201d\u201cCome on, dad! Lucien is Mr. Victor\u2019s student!\u201d Iven\u2019s eyes were gleaming with excitement, \u201cOh my god\u2026 I\u2019m gonna be the envy of all the kids in Aderon!\u201d\u201cActually\u2026 I helped Mr. Victor with a piece of music work for the concert, so I can invite some of my families and friends.\u201d Lucien was a bit shy to admit.\u201cWhat?\u201d Joel\u2019s fork dropped on the table, \u201cYou did?\u201d As a bard, he seriously understood how hard composing was.Lucien did not explain directly, \u201cI know it\u2019s pretty unexpected, uncle Joel, but you will see.\u201d\u201cNow our little Evans got his own secret!\u201d Joel laughed, \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll wait and see. And before that, we need to rent some decent clothes.\u201d\u201cSure. We\u2019ll tell John as well.\u201d Alisa\u2019s face was glowing with pride, \u201cI really hope he\u2019ll be able to come.\u201d\u2026Saturday. Eight o\u2019clock in the evening. The Psalm Hall.Decent coaches with assorted family insignias gathered in front of the hall. Some of them were luxury and some of them were simple but tasteful, but all were pulled by the strong and fine horses called Dragon Scale.Finely dressed ladies and gentlemen came out of the coaches, took over the music list for tonight and started greeting each other.\u201cIt\u2019s such a pleasure to see you here, sir. I wish you had a pleasant trip coming back to Aalto from your manor.\u201d A middle-aged man slight bowed to the earl with red hair. The other nobles around him were also being very respectful, since the earl was the head of one of the most dominant families in Aalto, the Hayne family, and was also Felicia\u2019s uncle.\u201cMr. Victor is my niece\u2019s music teacher. For sure I should attend the concert.\u201d Earl Hayne smiled, \u201cBesides, there are many different issues going on in Aalto recently. It is my duty to come back and serve the Grand Duke.\u201dEarl Hayne was in his fifties, but as a level three grand knight with the Blessing of Fire, no one could really tell his age based on his appearance. And his son, Harrington, was an outstanding young man, who just became a level six radiant knight in his early thirties and consolidated the family status.Other nobles around were all nodding with compliments.Taking over the music list and quickly glancing over it, Hayne noticed the name on the list, \u201cLucien Evans? Since when did Victor have such a student who can already compose?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t seen Felicia for a while,\u201d a noble lady named Yvette wondered, 'she never mentioned a student whose name\u2019s Lucien several months ago when we were on vacation.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s wait and see then.\u201d Lord Hayne started walking to the hallway. He unbuckled his sword and handed it to the guard, letting them check his other personal belongings.Since the Grand Duke would be here tonight as well, the security check must be strict.At the same time, the church laid a very large magic-blocking circle covering the whole Psalm Hall, in which almost all the supernatural magic spells, except legendary spells, were completely blocked. The blocking circle has been the church\u2019s greatest work in more than a hundred years.After Earl Hayne entered the hallway, two fine, dark purple coaches came, followed by two lines of guards in red uniforms with golden stripes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Both coaches were emblazoned with the same coat of arms\u2015a strong armored arm grabbing a silver shield, surrounded by many bright purple violets together with fortress-like patterns.It was the coat of arms of Orvarit Family, which was called the Family of Violet and also the Shield of Truth.The two coaches stopped in front of the long red carpet. Nobles who had already entered the hall left their seats and came outside again, following Count Hayne and Count Rafati, to welcome the grand duke, while the musicians were standing in the distance to show their respect.A tall young lady with bright purple hair got off the coach first in her elegant black evening dress.Her deep eyes were purple like a dream, her eyebrows were heavier and longer than common ladies, and her nose was high and straight, which matched perfectly with her pink, bloom-like lips. The young lady was gorgeous, and her beauty was unique: her beauty was of vitality, confidence, and heroic spirit. If it was appropriate to compare Ms. Silvia to the lily, who was gentle and elegant, the young lady would be a flourishing violet, lively and passionate.This young lady was the well-known Violet Countess, Natasha.And the middle-aged woman that Lucien saw last time was standing by Natasha\u2019s side.As a level five grand knight, Natasha was half-head taller than most men. She quickly walked to the other coach and supported her father, the grand duke, with his hand, to get off.Orvarit also had purple hair, but much lighter than his daughter\u2019s. In his early sixties, the grand duke looked weaker than his peers. When he was younger, Orvarit was not as gifted as Natasha, therefore, he had to rely on the many secret potions provided by the church and the family in order to awaken his Blessing, and then he became a level two knight. His health had been damaged by the potions in the early years, and the loss of his wife and the eldest son in the following years were also devastating to him.Even with all the sufferings, Orvarit was still very handsome and attractive. His love towards his late wife was well-known and touching. Many years before, Orvarit fell in love with the only princess of the Kingdom of Holm across Storm Strait when he was staying there as an ambassador. They overcame countless difficulties together and finally got married. In the following years, he gave all his love to his wife and never had any affair. The love story was still being sung by many bards until today.Supported by Natasha, the grand duke got off the coach and walked towards the red carpet. In his eyes, the sacred Psalm Hall never changed in his memory, and then he started thinking about his whole life. After so many years, Natasha was now his only concern. Indeed, he was very proud of his daughter, but also felt worried, since Natasha had an even stronger personality than many men.In front of the splendid and magnificent hall, the nobles were saluting the grand duke and the princess, showing their great respect. Orvarit was smiling to the nobles in his grave and dignified bearing, while Natasha was slightly nodding to them. Even Lucien could tell from a distance that although the princess was more than used to all of these noble manners, she was not much interested in them. However, when she later found Silvia standing among the nobles, a big and lovely smile appeared on her face.Lucien saw Natasha was slightly bowing to Silvia with her right hand on her chest, which was a typical male greeting.\u201cThat\u2019s weird\u2026 Um\u2026 If I\u2019m not mistaken, there is definitely something between Princess Natasha and Ms. Silvia\u2026\u201d Lucien did not want to gossip about it, but still felt a bit sorry for the noble gentlemen present. After all, both Silvia and Natasha were both very attractive and charming.\u201cI suggest we go inside and get seated first, your majesty.\u201d Count Hayne grinned after saluting the grand duke respectfully, \u201cLet\u2019s leave some free space to the young people.\u201dHis son Viscount Harrington was talking to Princess Natasha. Harrington was a nice-looking and enthusiastic young man. The concert for tonight was important, and so was the socializing part.Orvarit only took a quick glance at the young man without too much hope, \u201cWe should wait a bit. I believe Cardinal Sard will be here tonight as well.\u201dHearing the name, many nobles standing close by stopped talking, looking rather surprised.Sard, the Saint Cardinal, the presider of the church in the Duchy of Orvarit, member of the Episcopal Conference, was known for almost living in seclusion. It was very unexpected that he was attending the concert tonight, which reminded many of the nobles present of the evil ritual previously conducted in Baron Laurent\u2019s house.At this time, a simple coach with the Saint Truth Badge on it stopped in front of the hall. Everyone there could guess it was Sard\u2019s coach.Being helped by a young knight, an old man in his white robe got off the coach. He looked very kind with his totally white hair, just like a loving grandpa. Walking with firm and steady steps, Sard was still in pretty good health. No one could really tell he was actually already over two-hundred years old.As the old cardinal walked closer, Lucien suddenly felt a warm air gently breezing in his spirit, like his soul was basking in the holy light.Lucien was very surprised with how powerful the old man\u2019s spiritual power was. When his spiritual power got totally blocked by the magic circle laid by the church, the power of the old man\u2019s soul was still this influential. He had actually heard Sard\u2019s name before, since he was like a legend in this world. In that moment, Lucien finally saw the legend with his own eyes.It was said that, among all the cardinals in the Saint Truth Church, only about ten of them were Saint Cardinals. According to Lucien\u2019s knowledge, taking those people, including the greatest knight commanders, leaders of the inquisition and the monks into consideration, there could be no more than thirty people in this world who had this kind of power like Sard did.Standing close to Lucien, Rhine narrowed his eyes and wrinkled his brows in concentration as if something was too burning bright for him.Lucien noticed Rhine\u2019s difference and turned to look at him, and his eyes just met Rhine\u2019s in that moment. The corner of Rhine\u2019s mouth quirked up, putting a casual smile on his face.It was not the first time that Lucien noticed Rhine was behaving in a weird way. However, Lucien knew that tonight was not a proper time for solving the many questions about Rhine in his mind.When Cardinal Sard entered the hallway, following the knight manner, Orvarit kissed Sard\u2019s right hand respectfully with his knees slightly bent.\u201cOnly truth lives forever,\u201d said the grand duke.It looked like religious authority was still above imperial power in Aalto.\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to see you, Your Majesty. I\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re still doing this great, and I\u2019m glad to see our lovely little Natasha is an outstanding knight now.\u201d Sard held Orvarit\u2019s arm and smiled lovingly.The grand duke and the cardinal walked into the concert hall hand in hand, with Natasha holding Sard\u2019s arm on the other side slightly behind them. They were followed by the nobles walking in the strict rank rules.\u201cWell\u2026 It\u2019s time to get prepared in the backstage.\u201d Victor smiled, \u201cLucien, you may want to wait here for your friends and lead them to their seats later.\u201dLucien nodded and watched Victor and Rhine leaving. Soon Felicia, Lott and Herodotus went into the hall as well, and they would be sitting in the good seats assigned for their families.Close to the hallway, only Athy and Lucien were still waiting there. Athy was waiting for Victor\u2019s relatives and Lucien was waiting for his friends.A moment later, a plain and fully-loaded coach came. Iven was the first one getting off the coach, followed by his elder brother, John. Iven looked very adorable in his little suit, while John was the same, tall and handsome, whose blonde hair was shining in the light.Joel and Alisa got off the coach as well. Lucien felt auntie Alisa\u2019s dress was pretty tight for her, but her happy smile made her look much younger than usual. Seeing the whole family, Lucien smiled without knowing.\u201cI thought you wouldn\u2019t come.\u201d Lucien playfully hit John on his shoulder. The two buddies had not seen each other for a while.\u201cCome on\u2026!\u201d John also hit Lucien back cheerily, \u201cYour first music work will be played in the Psalm Hall. As your best friend, how can I miss it! By the way, Lucien, I have a good news too.\u201d John hugged Lucien and patted him on the back, \u201cI\u2019m a high-rank knight squire now!\u201d\u201cWow! That\u2019s awesome, John! Good for you!\u201d Lucien grinned.At this time, Elena also arrived. In her long, light yellow dress, Elena looked like a lovely angel tonight.\u201cGood for you too, Lucien.\u201d Joel took a glance at Elena and nudged Lucien slightly, \u201cShe\u2019s adorable.\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 no\u2026 we\u2019re just friends.\u201d Lucien was a bit shy and embarrassed.Then Lucien led them to the west stand. It was much smaller than the other stands, and could only seat twenty people.\u2026The best seats belonged to the distinguished counts and above. After taking his seat, Orvarit slightly leaned forward and asked the cardinal, \u201cYour Eminence, is there any progress in investigating Baron Laurent\u2019s case?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlthough the city guards and the intelligence division of the Duchy were also looking into this thing, they could never compete with the great pastors from the inquisition who claimed that they could hear from the God of Truth.\u201cWell\u2026 some.\u201d Cardinal Sard was watching the orchestra being prepared on the stage in the front, with a casual smile on his face, \u201cWe believe that it has something to do with the duke in the hell. His predecessor was sealed somewhere under the Dark Mountain Range by the ancient magic empire, and he\u2019s always been trying to find his predecessor and absorb the power.\u201d\u201cI thought he could have been more careful,\u201d Natasha joined their conversation, \u201cand we heard that some sorcerers were involved in it as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Sard nodded, \u201cGod revealed to me that they do have other plans, so we\u2019re still gathering more information, especially looking up the ancient documents from Sylvanas Magic Empire. As for the sorcerers, they are just several apprentices with a sorcerer coming from the headquarter of the Congress of Magic. He calls himself \u2018professor\u2019 but he\u2019s only a third or fourth circle sorcerer, so we don\u2019t have to worry too much about them.\u201d\u201cThe headquarter of the Congress of Magic?\u201d the grand duke and the princess asked at the same time with wonder.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did not respond to Orvarit and Natasha\u2019s question immediately, but followed his own pace to tell the story.\u201cSeveral months ago, some of our night watchers successfully targeted a sorcerer from the congress, which is very rare, since most of them who came to Aalto before never stayed here long, not to mention trying to contact the many hiding sorcerers in Aalto. After all, their shared goal was to find the remains of the ancient magic empire in the Dark Mountain Range.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Orvarit rubbed his chin thoughtfully, \u201cmaybe they were also trying to have more sorcerers and sorceresses in Aalto to know and join their congress in order to grow and expand. As far as I know, that\u2019s something that the congress has been working on for more than two hundred years.\u201d As a pious believer, the grand duke definitely knew much more about sorcerers than most other people did.Several nobles sitting behind were paying close attention to what Sard, the grand duke and the princess were talking about. Their faces looked odd, as if there was something on their mind, but all of them decided to remain silent.\u201cYou\u2019re right, Your Highness.\u201d Sard adjusted his sitting position a bit and continued, \u201cUnfortunately, the night watchers failed to catch him alive, and the sorcerer destroyed himself.\u201d Then he took a glance at the tall and strong saint knight standing beside him, letting the knight continue with the rest of the explanation.Only the church knights can be called saint knights.The knight\u2019s face was fully covered by his protection mask, through which his dull voice came, \u201cWe think the sorcerer who called himself \u2018professor\u2019 came here for the same reason, and maybe also to investigate what happened to the last sorcerer.\u201dSitting in and leaning against her seat, Natasha looked pretty relaxed. Now she was looking in another direction with a hint of a smile on her face, \u201cIt seems like you know a lot about what the sorcerers are doing in Aalto, don\u2019t you?\u201dShe was not being disrespectful, actually, her piousness was acknowledged before by Sard himself, and her teacher was the chief commander of Sword Brothers serving the church. However, except when she was praying in front of the God of Truth, Natasha was always quite casual about almost everything.\u201cYour Highness, the church has been tracking them for years, and the sorcerers never hid themselves in front of the church perfectly,\u201d the knight lowered his head, 'so did the so-called \u2018Professor\u2019. Some clues are showing that he follows the contemporary magic system, and that\u2019s why we speculate that Professor is from the congress. It seems like he does not really trust the sorcerers in Aalto. He was being very careful, so although we have two people spying on them, what we know about Professor is still relatively limited. The church decided to be more cautious.\u201dIn the hundreds of years in Aalto, a few sorcerers betraying their belief and turning to work for the church was not something new. Knowing that the sorcerer groups in Aalto were too small to cause them much trouble, instead of destroying them all at once, the church decided to leave them in Aalto in order to play a long game with the Congress of Magic.\u201cWell\u2026 at this point, the mysterious Professor is not a big deal yet, as far as I\u2019m concerned. What makes me feel worried is Argent Horn. I wonder what they are planning in Aalto.\u201d Orvarit cupped his chin in his hand.\u201cAs you wish, your majesty, \u201d the knight slightly bowed, \u201cWe will leave the junior night watchers to trace the case of Professor, and the main force of the church keeps investigating the heresy.\u201d\u201cStill haven\u2019t found Rosan Aaron?\u201d Twirling her long purple hair with her finger breezily, Natasha asked.\u201cNot yet. We\u2019re trying our best,\u201d answered the saint knight.The orchestra was ready.At this time, a young, purple-haired man entered the balcony. His facial features were a bit similar to that of Natasha, but he was even taller than her. His suit was emblazoned with the coat of arms of the Violet family.The young man nodded to the nobles in the balcony, smiling. Then he walked toward the first row of seats in the front, saluting the grand duke and the cardinal respectfully in the knight manner.\u201cMy dear cousin, you\u2019re late.\u201d Natasha waved to him.This young man was the nephew of the grand duke, the chief commander of Aalto\u2019s city guard, Count Verdi.\u201cSorry.\u201d He sat down relatively close to Natasha, \u201cJust got some news about Argent Horn, but it turned out to be quite useless\u2026 Lucien Evans\u2026 the composer of Fate? I never heard this name before.\u201dCount Verdi, at the same time, was also quite famous in the music field.\u201cInteresting\u2026 I don\u2019t know this name either,\u201d said the grand duke. Hearing Verdi\u2019s comment, both Orvarit and Sard picked up the lists.\u201cThe name of the symphony is \u2018Fate\u2019. I bet this Lucien is a pretty brave and creative composer,\u201d Sard responded kindly, \u201cI don\u2019t really have a preference between the two music trends.\u201dNatasha grinned. \u201cI happen to know something about this Lucien. Yesterday, Baron Othello came to me and asked for the permission to replace the third piece of music on the list with a new symphony. And here it is, from this Victor\u2019s new student, Lucien Evans, who just started to learn music three months ago.\u201d\u201cThree months ago? That\u2019s insane.\u201d Verdi slightly frowned. Pursuing to be perfect, Verdi was strict with himself and knowing the fact that there was someone even more talented than him was definitely not pleasant.\u201cWell\u2026 Unfortunately, it looks like this guy is pretty talented, even more than you are, although you started to learn music at eight and at nine you were already able to compose. But seriously, don\u2019t worry Verdi. He cannot compete with you. I met the guy the other day, and he looked like a woman! I\u2019m quite curious to see what he can do.\u201d\u201cWell, some people are just geniuses, which is not fair per se, but it is the intention of God.\u201d Sard commented.And that reminded Natasha of the story of Sard.Sard was not a genius, ever. Since the first day he entered Aalto Monastery, he was never able to compete with his smart peers. However, in the end, it was Sard who became the Saint Cardinal, although it took him more than a hundred years.So he often told the followers, \u201cThe faith in God has nothing to do with talent.\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019ll wait and see.\u201d Orvarit laughed, \u201cWhat Natasha said makes me feel curious now, too.\u201dAt this time, Victor walked on the stage with a baton in his hand.Firstly, he bowed in the direction of the grand duke\u2019s balcony in a solemn manner, then he bowed to the other nobles and musicians. Finally, he turned around and lowered his head, staring at the baton in his hand.The playing started. Orvarit closed his eyes and smiled, \u201cThis is the best one among Victor\u2019s previous work. It\u2019s just beautiful.\u201dEveryone stopped talking and immersed themselves in the music.Looking into each other\u2019s eyes, Lucien, Lott and Felicia smiled together behind the backstage. They could tell Victor was in a very good form. Now they had become real classmates, if not yet friends.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe first symphony lasted for about forty minutes, and it went very well. During the break, some of the audiences expressed their concern that if the first symphony was already the best one among Victor\u2019s previous work, the rest of them might not be that good.But Victor proved that they were wrong. The second piece of symphony was actually even better. It was lively, vivid and full of life, like a cool summer breeze, like an autumn field. At the end of it, Orvarit applauded for a long time with satisfaction.\u201cVictor never stops making progress. He\u2019s awesome,\u201d commented the grand duke.\u201cThat\u2019s true. It\u2019s soothing and beautiful,\u201d echoed Verdi, although in his mind, he did not really appreciate this kind of country style symphony.\u201cWell, it\u2019s good, but I think Victor is capable of doing an even better job. I didn\u2019t feel his passion in it. There\u2019s still space for improvement,\u201d said Natasha.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 66: The Concert (2)Translator:\u00a0Kris_Liu\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Vermillion\u201cMy little niece mentioned before that the composition of the second symphony took Victor around two to three years. After knowing that he would be holding a concert in the Psalm Hall, he spent another three months in my younger brother\u2019s manor for improvement. And it indeed reminded me of the boundless ripe wheat field in my hometown.\u201d Smiling, Earl Hayne introduced the story behind the symphony to the grand duke and the princess, feeling slightly grateful to his niece, Felicia, who he never had fondness for in the past.Since the eldest son of the previous earl died in a fight against the heretics, a contest started between the second and the youngest son of the Hayne family. At that time, because the second son, who is also the current Earl Hayne, had not awakened his Blessing yet, and Felicia\u2019s father was much better-favored by their father, the present earl was in a great anxiety almost all the time.Then a favorable turn came to the second son, who awoke his Blessing. Furthermore, his son Harrington grew into a very talented young man who wasn\u2019t even inferior to Princess Natasha and Earl Verdi. The second son successfully inherited the title and all the land the Hayne family had.\u201cI feel the same way.\u201d Orvarit nodded, \u201cThis piece of symphony reminded me of the beautiful country life. Maybe you\u2019re right, Natasha, but the concert is already very impressive. Let\u2019s wait and see the following two pieces of work.\u201d\u201cThe last symphony is from his student, though. I can\u2019t believe a new learner who just started learning music three months ago can compose a symphony, and I don\u2019t have much expectation on the young lad\u2019s so-called talent.\u201d Earl Rafati also joined their conversation, a very handsome man seemingly to be in his early thirties.\u201cUncle Hart, I believe you\u2019re the last person who should claim that talent doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d Natasha laughed in a very non-noble-lady way, \u201cYou awoke the Blessing of Sun when you were ten, and became an 8th circle senior-rank holy magus in your sixties. No one is more promising than you are for finally becoming a legendary holy magus.\u201dThe seemingly young Earl Rafati was actually way elder than he looked like, and he was a very powerful holy magus. Holy magi were people who awoke their Blessing and therefore were granted with magic power. To differentiate the blessed spellcasters from the notorious sorcerers, people called them magi.There was also a reason for the great power of the Rafati family. While other noble families were relating to each other by intermarriage, the Rafati family insisted on royal incest to make sure the great family power and the purest blood could be inherited by their younger generations. Although many deformed babies were thus born, the family also had many genius members such as the present earl.Verdi commented seriously, \u201cUncle Hart\u2019s talent is a gift from God. It\u2019s different.\u201d\u201cSo is musical talent, I heard.\u201d Natasha smiled, \u201cSeriously, I\u2019m quite looking forward to Lucien\u2019s work. No matter if it\u2019s good or bad, it\u2019s gonna be interesting.\u201d\u201cThe fourth piece of symphony should be the most impressive and outstanding one for tonight\u2019s concert. I hope Victor knows what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Rafati slightly shook his head.\u201cAside Lucien\u2019s work, I\u2019m also quite excited about the new musical instrument, the piano.\u201d Natasha switched the topic to the following piano concerto.\u201cI wonder how piano performs compared with harpsichord.\u201d Sitting on the chair, Verdi\u2019s back was straightened in a serious manner.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Now Victor was more relaxed, knowing that his first two pieces of symphonies were acknowledged by the grand duke. During the break, he was chatting with his students casually, while Rhine appeared to be more silent than usual.Soon it was time for Victor to go back to the stage. This time Rhine would be his designated conductor to direct the orchestra, and Victor would be the one who played the new musical instrument, the piano.The sound of the piano was rich and resounding. The first note of the piano concerto instantly caught the whole audience\u2019s attention. This was a piece of concerto with religious profundity.\u201cImpressive,\u201d Verdi commented with satisfaction and then closed his eyes to listen carefully.The high sound quality of piano fitted perfectly well with the solemnity and sacredness of the religious music. Several higher pitches were also handled very well by the piano. The whole Psalm Hall was immersed in the majestic melody.When the concerto came to its end, Cardinal Sard crossed himself and said, \u201cThis is an eulogy for God. The success of this concerto is accomplished by this brand new musical instrument.\u201d\u201cIt is awesome. It is the best keyboard instrument ever!\u201d Natasha gasped with admiration, \u201cCompared with piano, harpsichord and clavichord are just like toys for girls!\u201d\u201cYou are a girl as well, Natasha.\u201d Orvarit\u2019s brows were slightly frowned. The grand duke was about to applause when he heard his daughter\u2019s improper comment.Regarding her father with reverence, Natasha mumbled, \u201cEven so, I\u2019m still the most special girl among them all, no inferior to any man.\u201dHearing Natasha\u2019s murmuring, a meaningful smile appeared on Verdi\u2019s face, but he did not say anything.\u201cI saw you, Verdi!\u201d Natasha straightened her back instantly and stared at him seriously, \u201cYou don\u2019t think so, do you? Or you want a fight outside?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t want any trouble.\u201d Verdi was still smiling.\u201cAll right, Natasha. Symphony of Fate is coming.\u201d The grand duke was trying to change the topic between the two.Taking a glance at the stage, Natasha squinted at Verdi, \u201cMy dear cousin, I believe Lucien\u2019s work will be better than all of yours.\u201d\u201cWell, at least I have my music works to be compared. While you, my dear Natasha, you\u2019re not good at composing at all. With regard to the talent of composing, I believe I\u2019m way more gifted than you are.\u201d Verdi instantly fought back.\u201cThat\u2019s really true, isn\u2019t it? Well\u2026 well\u2026 then how strange it is that none of your brilliant work has ever been played in the Psalm Hall, while a random guy who just started learning music three months ago somehow managed to do it?\u201d Natasha put on a rather surprised look.\u201cI just don\u2019t want to\u2026\u201d Verdi gnashed his teeth, feeling sort of speechless, \u201cThe guy named Lucien\u2026 his work can never be better than mine.\u201d\u201cAha! I heard what you said!\u201d Natasha laughed, \u201cLet\u2019s see what will happen if his work indeed is better than yours.\u201dThe grand duke also nodded, feeling very expectant like the other nobles, except Wolf. Wolf\u2019s face was almost twisted together. Although the success of Victor\u2019s concert would not do any harm to him, in Wolf\u2019s mind, it was Victor who took away the success he deserved. So Wolf was going to pay very close attention to every single note of the following symphony, finding the tiniest flaws and putting all of them on Music Criticism.On the small west balcony, Alisa and Joel\u2019s hands were grabbing together tightly. Even John was feeling sort of nervous. All of them were waiting for Symphony of Fate, the last piece of work tonight.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Standing in front of the orchestra, with the baton in his hand again, Victor\u2019s mind churned. He thought back to the failure of his first concert, the great success of the second concert, the many memorable moments between Winnie and him, Winnie\u2019s affectionate gaze toward the end of her life, as well as the encouragement from Lucien, Rhine and the rest of his students\u2026\u201cWinnie, can you hear me?\u201d Victor knew he was ready, and he slowly lifted the baton.The moment when Victor waved his baton, the beginning of the symphony shocked every audience present. The first few bars of the symphony were like the loud knocks at the door that instantly woke everyone up. Orvarit, Natasha and Verdi opened their eyes at the same time with great surprise.It was fate that was knocking the door, in an irresistible and fierce manner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No one could hide from the trials of life. The theme of the symphony was revealed directly, without any foreshadowing or implication.The horns took place before a second theme was introduced, symbolizing the fierce struggling between fate and will. As the first and the second theme interweaved with each other, the audience experienced great tension and pressure, as if they were personally on the battlefield, although they were only sitting in their seats.The reactions of the audience varied. Grabbing the armrests, the nobles such as the grand duke and Wolf who had never experienced the cruelty of war in person almost couldn\u2019t stand the fear in their hearts, while Knight Venn became very engulfed by the memories of the deep fear and horror that he suffered back in the days when he was fighting against the evil creatures and the heretics.Sard remained relatively calm, but his eyes were open. This time his eyes were no longer dull, instead, they were bright and sharp. He was associating the music work with his own stories back in the day.Facing the tension and the great pressure coming from the symphony, younger nobles, such as Verdi and Natasha, showed their rising fighting will. Clenching his right fist, Verdi tightened every muscle in his body to be ready for fronting the blows of fate, showing the spirit of the Violet family as the Shield of Truth. Natasha\u2019s body was leaning forward, and her face looked serious but also excited. She wanted a good fight to beat the darkness and the so-called fate.Victor devoted his heart and soul to the conducting. Compared with Lucien\u2019s original work, now the symphony was much better developed and even more thrilling. The combination of viola, cello and woodwind in the second movement gave the audience a short break from the intensity, and soon the third movement again threw them back to the front, encountering the overwhelming fear of darkness.Pain, hope, fear, anger and so many other feelings mixed together. When the light finally beat the darkness, when the final movement of great victory was played in the Psalm Hall, many of the audience spontaneously stood up and cheered with thunderous applause.The grand duke gave a long sigh of relief and raised his hand to wave, as if he was cheering for his brave knights and soldiers returning home in triumph. With great excitement as well as satisfaction, Natasha left her seat and walked close to the handrail, staring at the orchestra as if she was still immersed in her own world of music.Leaning comfortably against the back of the seat, Silvia and the other musicians spontaneously exchanged a look. They could tell the great surprise and admiration in each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cThis young man\u2026 He\u2019s probably another genius after Gesu and Twal,\u201d Silvia murmured to herself.Joel\u2019s family and Elena were cheering and applauding. Although they did not know a lot about music, they felt from the bottom of their hearts that Lucien\u2019s work was truly shocking and touching. They had tears in their eyes.Joel was tingling with excitement, feeling that his dream was accomplished by Lucien. He was more than proud, regarding Lucien\u2019s success and honor as his own.Grabbing his father\u2019s shoulder, John\u2019s face flushed with gratification, \u201cDad, Lucien is such a genius, isn\u2019t he?!\u201d\u201cFrom now on, we can call him \u2018Mr. Lucien\u2019\u2026\u201d Elena couldn\u2019t believe what just happened in the hall. After all, when she first met Lucien several months ago, this young man was carrying bags of garbage.Wolf\u2019s face turned deathly pale, knowing that he could never deny the greatness of this symphony. And now he finally realized why Victor was willing to have such a pauper as his music student\u2014this poor guy was indeed a genius.Turning his head restlessly in the tumultuous applause, Wolf relied his last bit of hope on the picky nobles and musicians, wishing that at least a couple of them who always preferred religious music would show their dislike toward the theme of the symphony.The grand duke joined his daughter, walking toward the front of the balcony to applaud warmly. Being led by the grand duke and the princess, the second round of wild applause with the tumultuous ovation burst out, reverberating through the Psalm Hall.Without any doubt, the concert was a great success!After saluting the grand duke and the rest of the audience, Victor trotted back and pulled Lucien out from the backstage. Lucien was prepared, so he calmly followed Victor and came to stand in front of all the audience.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, please let me introduce you my student, Lucien Evans. It is Lucien Evans who composed this great piece of symphony,\u201d said Victor loudly to all of the balconies.\u201cWhat a talent!\u201d The applause from the nobles and the musicians became even louder, showing their great recognition toward this young musician.\u201cGreat music. Great young man.\u201d Earl Hayne nodded, \u201cEven a person who knows nothing about music can feel the greatness of his work.\u201dThe grand duke commented in a loud voice, \u201cUnparalleled! This young man will grow into a great musician!\u201dNatasha\u2019s mind was full of emotional thoughts, \u201cI was almost speechless. I felt something\u2026 very unique. I know it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been always looking for. Lucien, you\u2019re the innovator in the history of music!\u201dEven Verdi couldn\u2019t say anything to refute her at this point.\u201cYou got the soul that never yields. God bless you, young man.\u201d Slowly, Sard stood up. He looked at Lucien with a loving smile on his face.Among all the people, Wolf was the only one who remained slouching in his seat. He felt too weak to even talk.\u201cThanks God. This is the gift of God.\u201d Lucien saluted the balconies in a gentleman manner, playing his role as a believer with great piety. The great success of the concert would bring him lots of benefits, and one of them would be a higher social status which was very helpful for him to hide his identity. The guards from the church and the sheriffs of the city would not dare to casually arrest or investigate a musician who had received the recognition from the grand duke, the cardinal and the princess.The cardinal nodded and said to the grand duke, \u201cI\u2019m very glad that I attended the concert tonight. All of the music works tonight are great, and Symphony of Fate is especially the most impressive one. Light conquers darkness. The God of Truth empowers us to fight against difficulties. God bless us all.\u201d\u201cGod bless us all.\u201d Orvarit lowered his head, putting his palm on his chest.On the stage, Victor\u2019s eyes were wet with tears. How he wished that Winnie could see all of this in heaven.\u201cHow do you feel now, my cousin?\u201d Natasha looked at Verdi and asked pleasantly.\u201cThis piece of work belongs to Lucien, not you, Natasha. And unfortunately, his talent can never be yours as well.\u201d Verdi did not answer directly.\u201cWell\u2026 actually the unique theme of his work inspired me a lot. Maybe I should have him to be my music consultant to produce my own music work,\u201d said Natasha, tilting her head on one side.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHis success comes from both of his talent and his life experience. And the accumulation of inspiration and good ideas takes time. I don\u2019t think it will work, Natasha.\u201d Verdi shrugged his shoulders disapprovingly.\u201cStill worth a shot.\u201d Lifting her brows, Natasha chuckled.\u2026When the nobles were leaving the Psalm Hall in order, Victor and Lucien came to the backstage. The orchestra members there were still feeling excited.\u201cMr. Victor, Mr. Evans, this is the best concert we\u2019ve ever attended!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although when practicing, they already had a pretty high expectation on this concert, especially on Symphony of Fate, the heated response from the noble audiences and the many famous musicians tonight was still a great surprise for them.Victor was also very excited. He walked toward Rhine, his most intimate comrade in these days, and gave him a big hug, \u201cThank you so much, Mr. Rhine. You helped me with improving the harpsichord. You supported me all the time during the countless times of rehearsal. Without you, this concert could never be this perfect.\u201dAlthough Rhine remained quite silent all the evening, he was also very gratified by the success of the concert, \u201cThank you, Victor. It is my honor to work with you, Mr. Victor, and with Lucien as well.\u201d He smiled.\u201cMr. Evans!\u201d Thomas, the cellist of the orchestra, hugged Lucien with great enthusiasm, \u201cYou\u2019ll become the most well-known musician in Aalto, no\u2026 on the whole continent!\u201dLucien felt a bit awkward when people, especially the orchestra members, called his surname with respect.Lucien\u2019s promising future in music was already widely expected by many of the orchestra members when they first started to rehearse the fourth piece of symphony composed by the young music student of Mr. Victor. Now Lucien\u2019s talent was acknowledged by the distinguished nobles in the public. Since the grand duke used the word \u201cunparalleled\u201d to comment on Lucien\u2019s music work, and the princess Natasha directly called Lucien \u201cthe innovator of the music history\u201d, Lucien would definitely become the brightest new star in the field of music very soon.Everyone in the orchestra knew that as long as Lucien could compose another piece of symphony of the same high quality within the following two years, his status in the field of music would be completely fastened. If this new trend of music could be popularized in the future, then Lucien would undoubtedly be a high authority. Thus, the orchestra members showed great respect toward Lucien.Lucien hugged the members one by one. Although the status and the income of a musician was way higher than the common players in an orchestra, Lucien was clearly aware of the fact that the full cooperation of the players was also one of the key factors in determining the outcome of a concert.\u201cLucien,\u201d Rhine also gave Lucien a big hug, \u201cI can imagine that, in the near future, more and more pieces of music work will be composed to express human being\u2019s feelings and emotions, instead of merely praising God. I shall call you Mr. Evans as well, since you are absolutely the pioneer of the new trend.\u201dAlthough Lucien was not used to that intimate way of celebrating, he also did not mind it. Lucien also hugged Rhine, \u201cThank you, Mr. Rhine. Unfortunately, I\u2019m still far away from being a pioneer, after all, even playing piano is still challenging for me. And by the way, your violin playing was awesome, Mr. Rhine, but just lacked some passion.\u201dIn Lucien\u2019s eyes, Rhine was sometimes a bit weird. Taking this chance, Lucien was trying to test Rhine.\u201cYou\u2019re right. Maybe I am too calm most of the time.\u201d Rhine released his arms and explained casually. Although Rhine looked pretty lean, Lucien could feel the strength in his arms and his body from the short hug.Lucien was also supposed to hug his classmates.\u201cGreat work, Lucien.\u201d When hugging Lucien, Felicia\u2019s face flushed. Lucien\u2019s success would bring her lots of benefits as well. She could already picture the scene of she being surrounded by many noble ladies and madams, asking about her talented classmate.\u201cI\u2019m proud of having you as my classmate, Lucien.\u201d Lott offered Lucien a big hug and congratulated him, while Herodotus remained silent when he was hugging Lucien. A while later, Herodotus said to Lucien in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019re something.\u201dVictor saved his warmest and biggest hug for Lucien, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to express to you my thankfulness, Lucien. You\u2019re a gift for me from God. Having you as my student is my great blessing.\u201d\u201cBeing your student is my greatest honor, Mr. Victor,\u201d said Lucien sincerely.\u201cOh, there\u2019s one thing\u2026\u201d Victor said to Lucien, \u201cYou\u2019ll get half of the money tonight. Don\u2019t say no, Lucien. With the money, you don\u2019t have to live in Aderon anymore. Aderon is not safe.\u201dAs far as Lucien knew, ticket for the concerts held in the Psalm Hall was always in high demand. The ticket revenue tonight was three hundred and sixty-five Thales, which was quite a lot. Three hundred and sixty-five Thales was four times the number of Victor\u2019s annual income, while the annual income of a noble knight was only about three to five hundred Thale.According to the regulation of the association, forty percent of the ticket income would be contributed to the church, and thirty percent would be used for the maintenance of the association and the Psalm Hall, as well as paying the whole orchestra. For the remaining thirty percent, about a hundred and ten Thales would be Victor\u2019s. In other words, Lucien would earn around thirty to thirty-five Thales.Thirty to thirty-five Thales equalled several decades of saving for a common person, even a life long effort. With the money, Lucien could move to a decent three-storey house in Purple Lily district, or a relatively old two-storey house with a small garden in Gesu district.\u201cI can\u2019t say no. Thank you very much, Mr. Victor,\u201d Lucien answered sincerely, as if he could already see the gold coins shining in front of his eyes. With the money, the dust of Moonlight Rose would not be a dream for Lucien anymore. The only problem was that it was not easy to find Moonlight Rose dust.A decent place in a decent area was also what Lucien needed, not only because he wanted a better living condition, but also because of the need to stay away from Aderon where he got involved with the other sorcerers using the identity \u201cProfessor\u201d. With a bigger house, Lucien could also build a bigger and safer magic lab underground.After the celebration, when Felicia was about to invite everyone present to visit her family\u2019s manor tomorrow, the middle-aged lady who always stood by Princess Natasha\u2019s side came to the backstage.\u201cLady Camil.\u201d Felicia, Lott and Herodotus heard her story before. They hurriedly saluted her.Victor, Lucien and the other people present also followed the manner.\u201cMr. Evans,\u201d said Lady Camil seriously, \u201cPrincess Natasha wants you to be her personal music consultant. About an hour each time, twice a week, in Ratacia Palace. The pay is very decent, two Thale a month.\u201dHer words instantly turned Lucien into the envy of the people present, even including Victor. Only Rhine\u2019s eyes dimmed for a moment.\u201cI\u2026 I can\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Lucien turned down the offer subconsciously, \u201cI just started learning music three months ago. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not qualified for this position, and the success this time might just be a random explosion of my accumulated inspiration.\u201dLucien had another reason that he could not speak out. He was afraid that entering the palace would be too risky and his sorcerer identity might be revealed by the princess, who was a level five grand knight herself, or this lady Camil, a radiant knight.However, the job was also very alluring. From another perspective, serving Princess Natasha could be his perfect disguise as well.\u201cThe princess doesn\u2019t mind. What Her Royal Highness values is the unique skills you employed in your composition and your understanding toward the new theme of music.\u201d said Camil emotionlessly, \u201cWould you like to accept the job, Mr. Evans?\u201dThe other people in the room were looking at Lucien with expectation. Finally, Lucien nodded his head.\u201cIt would be my pleasure to serve the princess.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThank you, Mr. Evans.\u201d Lady Camil said and then left the backstage.The pay was truly very good. At least before becoming a 1st circle sorcerer, Lucien wouldn\u2019t have to worry with the expenses of buying most of the materials.Also, the job offered Lucien a high social status.\u201cWe really envy you, Lucien.\u201d Felicia and Lott congratulated him in a very direct way.Victor also cast his eyes to Lucien with delight and satisfaction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Only few lights were still twinkling along the dark and empty street.Although the daytime in the Month of Harvest was hot, the rain-swept night was very cool and pleasant. Lucien\u2019s mind was refreshed by the cool air. He gradually woke up from the ecstasy and started to plan his next step. If everything went well, Lucien would be leaving Aderon very soon, thus he had to clean the underground lab up as soon as possible in case some random tramps would inadvertently enter the shack when there was no one there. Before that, Lucien decided to collect some Revenant Dust tonight when the lab was still fully equipped, and then he could turn his attention to the search of Moonlight Rose tomorrow.Moonlight Rose was always in high demand and very expensive, since it was the main ingredient of the magic potion which could help a knight squire awaken Blessing, and thus become a real knight. As most squires couldn\u2019t afford the Moonlight Rose, some knights would occasionally select their best squires and award them with the dust of the rose.In addition to that, the market of Moonlight Rose was controlled by the church, the Violet family and a few other big families, which was also one of the strategies how the big families consolidated their status in the Duchy of Orvarit.Lucien was hoping that probably Felicia could help him, since she was a member of the Hayne family. Felicia was qualified enough to buy some Moonlight Roses within her family.What Lucien did not know was that, actually, Felicia had already bought the roses three times before, hoping that she could awaken her Blessing. However, her hope finally failed, and since then she started to pay her full attention to learning music.Lucien currently had no idea how to ask Felicia to do him a favor without being suspected, which sort of bothered him. If Felicia was not willing to help, then Lucien would have no other choice but to find the black market in Aalto or join another secret sorcerer meeting again, which was the last thing Lucien wanted to do for now.Two simple wagons were waiting in front of the Psalm Hall in the corner. Uncle Joel and his family as well as Elena were waiting for Lucien beside the wagons.Seeing Lucien coming in their direction, Joel waved to him with both of his hands. He came toward Lucien and gave Lucien a big warm hug.\u201cTonight\u2019s like a dream.\u201d Joel patted Lucien\u2019s back with great joy, \u201cYou invited me to the concert and fulfilled my dream. We\u2026 and your dad\u2026 we are all so proud of you, Lucien.\u201dFollowing Joel, John also hugged Lucien. His arms were shaking a bit, and his voice was trembling, \u201cI knew it! I knew you\u2019re something! But your growth is still way beyond my expectation, after all, I thought at least I would become a knight first, haha. Now I gotta work even harder or I\u2019ll fall behind.\u201dLucien was inspired\u2014maybe he could use John as an excuse for buying Moonlight Rose. After all, Lucien could now afford to buy Moonlight Rose for his close friend John, who was a knight squire, which definitely made sense.And it was part of Lucien\u2019s original plan as well. Some of his roses would be a gift for John. Lucien already regarded Joel\u2019s family as his own family and John as his most important friend. The support Joel\u2019s family offered Lucien meant a lot to him.Now the only problem was how Lucien could persuade Felicia to do him the favor.\u201cMy career in music has just started. There\u2019s still a long way to go.\u201d Lucien smiled, \u201cI\u2019m sure soon you will awake your Blessing and become a real knight.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m not sure about that yet, Lucien.\u201d John shook his head and released his arms, \u201cThe first try to awake the Blessing is the most likely to succeed. I have to be more prepared for that.\u201d\u201cCongratulations, Mr. Evans!\u201d Elena hugged Lucien. Her big eyes were blinking with joy.\u201cI\u2019m really flattered, Elena.\u201d Lucien grinned, \u201cWe are friends. Please, don\u2019t call me a mister.\u201d\u2026\u2026After sending Elena and Joel\u2019s family home, Lucien went back to his shack and lay in bed.About one o\u2019clock in the early morning, suddenly Lucien got up. Making sure that it was safe around, Lucien quietly entered his magic lab.It took Lucien an hour to set up some magic traps just in case. Then Lucien took out a tube of blood from a box. At the same time, the magic notebook was open in his spirit library, ready for taking notes at any time. Lucien was hoping that during the process of collecting the revenant dust, he could also gain a better understanding toward the undead creatures.As soon as Lucien opened the tube inscribed with runes, a strong smell of sulphur came into his nose. As if it was alive, the dark blood kept bubbling like lava.Murmuring the awkward-sounding and obscure spell, Lucien connected his spirit with another space dimension. Suddenly, he grabbed the tube and spilled the blood forward.Weirdly, instead of dropping on the ground, the blood suspended in the air and divided into many small drops.The drops of blood moved quickly, and a magic circle took shape in front of Lucien. The whole space of the lab was instantly filled with the stinky smell of blood.Blood fog diffused around the lab. Suddenly, a transparent human figure appeared in the air, of which its face and limbs remained very blurry, but its resentment was so strong that it almost became visible.Although Lucien still did not understand how different space dimensions were connected by spiritual power, the structure of this apprentice summoning spell itself was not complicated.A hole, probably its mouth, appeared on the figure\u2019s face, and the vicious revenant started screaming and suddenly leaped at Lucien\u2019s throat.Lucien stayed very calm and activated the magic traps around him. The air flows restricted the revenant like ropes and shackled it in the air.Wraith Shackle, an apprentice level spell.At the same time, transparent walls appeared in the air and surrounded the revenant inside. The surface of the walls was rippling like water as the sound waves of the scream kept hitting the walls.Silence Wall, also an apprentice spell.Although the scream of the revenant was blocked, Lucien still felt a sudden surge of nausea and he heard someone was screaming in his brain.Quickly Lucien took down the notes in his spirit library.\u201cThe scream of revenant transmits in the form of infrasonic waves. High penetrating power. Causes illusion.\u201dLucien hoped that he could know the rough vibration frequency of the waves, but with limited lab equipment, Lucien\u2019s note couldn\u2019t be more detailed and accurate.Being trapped, the revenant\u2019s scream became even crazier, but the scream couldn\u2019t bother Lucien anymore. Calmly, Lucien activated the magic circle drawn on the table, from which many golden rays of light immediately scattered.\u201cWeight, 21.26g. Heavier than expected. Power\u2026 remain unknown.\u201d The information was stored.Then Lucien started to cast different spells on the revenant to see the effects.\u201cImmune to Mage Hand.\u201d\u201cImmune to Acid Splash.\u201d\u201cImmune to Freezing Rays.\u201d\u201cSmall damage caused by Homan\u2019s Oscillation. Might be because of the intervention of waves, or magnetic interference.\u201d\u201cMinor damaged caused by Marius\u2019 Small Flame. Reason unknown.\u201d\u2026\u2026As the experiment went on, the revenant in the air became weaker and weaker, and even more transparent. As if it was afraid of Lucien, the revenant huddled in the corner of the surrounding magic walls.\u201cSome instinct remained.\u201d Lucien kept recording.Then Lucien cast the spell Illumination. In the light, the revenant became irritated again, but had nowhere to escape. Its resentment gradually disappeared in the light, but rather slowly.\u201cAfraid of strong light.\u201d Another line of words appeared on the notebook.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The experiment finally came to the end. Looking at the very weak revenant huddling in the corner, Lucien shook his head.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe summoned revenant was now badly damaged and soon it disappeared completely. Shiny fine dust slowly fell into the magic circle.\u201c21.25g. The reason of the weight difference remains unknown. Maybe the consciousness of the revenant also has weight.\u201dLucien collected the dust of the revenant in a glass tube, and then slowly tidied up the lab, since it should also be the last time he used it before Lucien moved out.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the morning, Lucien got up early and headed for the Association for two reasons. Firstly, Lucien had become Princess Natasha\u2019s personal music consultant, so he should quit the librarian job and leave it to someone who really needed it. Secondly, Lucien was too excited to wait another day to get his lovely and shiny Thales.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since the concert finished late last night, it was quite surprising that the guards were already showing respect to him in this following Sunday morning. Lucien wondered if maybe it was Elena who told the guards, because she was the only one among all the concert audience who needed to work on Sunday.Before Lucien entered the building, he heard they were whispering, \u201cThree months ago, Mr. Evans was still carrying garbage for our association. He asked me to do him a favor looking after his trolley. Now look at him, a musician!\u201d\u201cI know\u2026 The last time I saw him he was still a music student. Never expected he was such a genius!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Elena and Cathy were tidying up the documents behind the counter when Lucien came into the lobby. Both of them greeted Lucien with respect, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Evans.\u201dElena winked at Lucien with a sweet smile on her face, and Cathy seemed to be a bit nervous.\u201cGood morning, Elena. Morning, Cathy.\u201d Lucien asked with curiosity, \u201cWhat keeps you girls this busy this morning?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked.\u201d Elena answered in excitement, \u201cLucien, you know what? Your name is on both the latest Music Criticism and Symphony News.\u201d\u201cWhat? I thought the next issue for both of them would be released at the end of the month\u2026\u201d Now Lucien was really surprised.\u201cThat\u2019s because your music work is so amazing!\u201d Elena was very proud of Lucien, \u201cMany musicians were deeply touched by your Symphony of Fate, and they worked overnight on their reviews! The association thus decided to issue both of the newspapers in advance this month. Now we have the first copies!\u201d\u201cMr. Evans, do you want one?\u201d asked Cathy with respect and curiosity.\u201cWell\u2026 I think I should.\u201d Lucien smiled and poured out twenty Fells from his moneybag. From hard saving, Lucien\u2019s small moneybag finally bulged a bit.\u201cWhat did they say, Lucien?\u201d Elena still couldn\u2019t read very well, \u201cCathy and I are really curious.\u201dPicking up the latest Music Criticism, Lucien saw a painting of the Psalm Hall and two lines of black bold words,\u201cLadies and gentlemen, hats off to the real genius!\u2014 Othello\u201dLucien read Mr. Othello\u2019s comment to Elena and Cathy, and the girls\u2019 eyes were filled with reverence.Turning the page, the first review article titled Music with Soul\u2014Salute to Symphony of Fate:\u201cAs a gift from God, music encourages us to continuously progress toward a better future. However, in the past three hundred years, the main role that the solemn and sacred religious music was playing was never challenged on the stage of music, since other music themes were always hiding behind the scenes and paled in comparison with it.\u2026\u2026\u201cUntil we met Symphony of Fate, a great piece of music composed by Lucien Evans and first played on Mr. Victor\u2019s concert held in the Psalm Hall last night, I finally realized what is the most indispensable quality of a masterpiece!\u201cMusic is emotion. Music is feelings. Without emotion and feelings, without soul, music can never be deeply moving to people. And the young musician Lucien Evans knows clearly about this: The four movements of Symphony of Fate are connected by a consistent faith all along\u2014hope and persistence can conquer any difficulty. It is the most exciting, encouraging and touching symphony I have ever appreciated.\u2026\u2026\u201cLucien Evans, without any doubt, is a genius. His music talent shocked Aalto, and I believe he will shock the whole continent in the future.\u2026\u2026\u201cAs soul is to life, so is emotion to music!\u201dThe review article was pretty long, which was more about expressing feelings instead of professional analyzing. The reason this article ranked the first was that it was written by the grand duke, Orvarit.\u201cWow\u2026 The grand duke really likes your symphony!\u201d exclaimed Elena in surprise and joy.\u201cI heard Princess Natasha also contributed,\u201d said Cathy politely, \u201cMr. Evans, can you please read her article to us? I know the princess\u2019s very good at reviewing music works.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d answered Lucien, feeling a bit nervous to read the princess\u2019s comment.Natasha\u2019s article ranked second place in Music Criticism following her father\u2019s work, which titled A Future Trend\u2014The Music Revolution Led by Symphony of Fate:\u201cA great piece of symphony with magnificent theme and touching emotion running through.\u201cThe talented musician, Lucien Evans, creatively used the four stress accents to form the first bar as the beginning of Symphony of Fate. Each of the four movements of the symphony was relatively independent but yet connected to each other, highlighting the shared theme: Light would conquer darkness and courage would overcome difficulty. The flexible and skilled utilization of assorted music instruments enriched the symphony\u2019s emotion world and grabbed every audience\u2019s heart last night.\u2026\u2026\u201cCall it heroism. Call it persistence. Call it knight spirit. I was deeply touched by the great work. The short bar which is composed of the four stress accents is still striking my heart, as if it synchronizes with my heart beat.\u201cThis young, unfettered music genius, Mr. Evans, revealed a brand new music world in front of us, where new music skills should be explored, and new music themes should be developed.\u201cGreat innovator! Great pioneer!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lucien\u2019s face blushed when he was reading the article. Flipping through this Music Criticism, Lucien found that twenty-nine out of the forty articles here were music reviews about Symphony of Fate. Some of them analyzed its theme and some of them skills. The other several articles were about Victor\u2019s piano concerto and the concert in general.Urged by Elena and Cathy, Lucien briefly glanced through the latest Symphony News and found the same situation\u2014all of the articles were about either Victor or himself.\u201cWait\u2026I know this name.\u201d Elena pointed her finger at a name under the first review article on Symphony News, \u201cChristopher\u2026 Gionis.\u201dChristopher Gionis was the president of the Musicians\u2019 Association, and also the most well-known musician in Aalto who composed more than a hundred great music works. Gionis was respected as a \u201cliving music legend\u201d.Here was Gionis\u2019s comment:\u201cIf you haven\u2019t heard Symphony of Fate, you heard no music in your life.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d Except exclaiming, Elena and Cathy had no idea how to express their admiration to Lucien.A while later, Elena said to Lucien, \u201cI\u2019m sure few months later, you\u2019ll become one of the most renowned young musicians throughout the continent.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithout saying anything, Lucien smiled and slightly shook his head. Then he left for Mr. Hank\u2019s office on the third floor.\u201cCongratulations, Evans.\u201d Hank rose from his seat behind the desk, walked toward Lucien and gave him a hug.\u201cThank you, Mr. Hank.\u201d Lucien smiled, \u201cI\u2019m here to quit my librarian\u2019s job.\u201d\u201cOf course, I expected so.\u201d Hank agreed without hesitation, and then he took out a money bag, \u201cAccording to Mr. Victor, this is yours.\u201dThe money bag was not big but quite heavy, in which thirty-three gold coins were fascinatingly shining.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lucien was aware that there was supposed to be thirty-four gold coins in the bag, but he did not say anything about it, and of course Hank would not mention anything as well. It was an unspoken rule, Lucien knew that.After leaving Hank\u2019s office, Lucien decided to visit Pierre in the library. After all, they worked together for more than two months. Lucien should a least say goodbye to him as friends.\u2026Staring blankly, Pierre was sitting behind the counter, which was blanketed by two outspread newspapers.\u201cGood morning, Pierre.\u201d Lucien greeted.As if he was suddenly awakened from a dream, Pierre gazed at the person standing in front of him for a moment in puzzlement, then he slowly answered, \u201cLucien\u2026\u201d As soon as he called the name, his face darkened, \u201cMy fault\u2026 I shall call you Mr. Evans now.\u201dPierre\u2019s attitude surprised Lucien quite a bit. Lucien thought he knew Pierre\u2019s personality relatively well from working together with him in the past two months. In his mind, Pierre was never a silly or an arrogant jerk.\u201cPierre\u2026 Why\u2026?\u201d Lucien was confused.\u201cYou guys ruined harpsichord! You guys know nothing about harpsichord!\u201d Pierre\u2019s dark brown eyes were filled with anger.Lowering his head, Lucien saw the newspapers on the counter, of which the two articles on the current pages were both about Victor\u2019s piano concerto.Lucien remembered the details of the two articles, since the content was already stored in his spirit library just now when he was flipping through the newspapers.One of the article praised the improvement that Victor made with traditional harpsichord and applauded for the impressive features of the new music instrument\u2015the piano, while the other criticized the playing skills Victor used during his playing, accusing Victor\u2019s new fingering with piano a betrayal of classical fingerings and the great tradition of music.\u201cYou may hold different opinions, and I understand, Pierre.\u201d Lucien tried to mediate, \u201cBut we don\u2019t have to argue over this. Just leave the discussion to the musicians and critics.\u201d\u201cAnswer me. Do you think you really understand harpsichord?\u201d Pierre directly ignored Lucien\u2019s words and questioned him again.Lucien came up with the book that Pierre once recommended him to read, which was titled The Art of Harpsichord Performance. Locating it in his spirit library, Lucien noticed the name of the author was Antonio Sandor.\u201cYour father is\u2026 Antonio Sandor, the author of The Art of Harpsichord Performance?\u201d asked Lucien.Pierre paused a moment. Then he squared his shoulders and answered proudly, \u201cYes, I am the son of Antonio Sandor, a great harpsichord musician.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re so angry?\u201d Lucien stared up at Pierre and asked calmly.\u201cThe great achievement made by my father can never been ruined by you guys!\u201d answered Pierre with excitement.\u201cWhat is talking to me now is your prejudice, Pierre, not you.\u201d Lucien did not want to argue with him, \u201cAnyway, I just wanted to say goodbye to you. From today on I won\u2019t be working in this library anymore.\u201d\u201cI was wrong about you, Lucien,\u201d said Pierre with strong dislike, \u201cI thought you honored music a lot, but in fact you\u2019re too arrogant to show your respect. You\u2019ll definitely regret in the future if you don\u2019t stick to traditional fingerings. Watch out, you genius!\u201dLucien opened his mouth and tried to say something, but finally gave up. He directly turned around and left the library.He thought Pierre and he would become friends. Lucien sighed in his mind. After all, a friend was easier lost than found.\u2026Since the concert was a great success, everyone was taking a weekend off for the first time in a long while. Lucien did not find Felicia in their practicing room on the fourth floor.\u201cMaybe Felicia will be at home in the afternoon,\u201d wondered Lucien. He still had no idea how to persuade Felicia to help him.Thinking about this, Lucien went back to the lobby and asked Elena if she knew about any house for rent in Gesu area. Since most of the musicians and players in Aalto lived in Gesu, the Musicians\u2019 Association was also responsible for providing house information and helping its musicians to find ideal places to live close to each other.Among the many choices, Lucien liked the two-storey house located at no. 116 in Gesu the most. The house was owned by a not very famous musician, who was now far away in the Kingdom of Syracuse serving a viscount as his music consultant. The location of the house was a bit remote in the area, but the rent was also cheaper\u2014one Thale per year.It was almost ten in the morning. Lucien planned to take a look at the house this afternoon, after visiting Felicia. He wanted to move out as soon as possible. Now Lucien had to go back home and clean some of his stuff.\u201cTake care, Mr. Evans.\u201d Elena smiled to Lucien, and Cathy slightly bowed to him respectfully.\u2026When Lucien came back to Aderon, he saw many of the neighbors were standing in front of auntie Alisa\u2019s place like the last time when John became a knight squire.Every week, these poor people in Aderon could luckily take a short break on Sunday, since they also went to the church in the morning.With the improvement of his spiritual power, Lucien\u2019s hearing was also now better than that of common people. He captured some of the words from the neighbors\u2019 conversation and an ominous feeling came over him.\u201cHi, Roy. Why there\u2019re so many people gathering here?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cHey, Lucien! It\u2019s been a while since the last time I saw you!\u201d With too much labor work, Roy, in his early thirties, looked much older than his age, and he did not know that Lucien had become the princess\u2019s music consultant yet, \u201cYou know what? Every dog has its day! And Joel\u2019s lucky day finally comes! A noble lord invited Joel to be his family musician this morning.\u201d\u201cWhat? Where is uncle Joel now?\u201d Lucien was surprised.\u201cJoel left in a hurry, and he took Alisa and his son together as well. I bet the pay must be very good.\u201d Roy grinned.\u201cLucien, you did not know about it?\u201d asked a middle-aged woman named Lizz with curiosity, \u201cPeople say you\u2019re a famous musician now and it is because of your reputation that Joel has been invited. Is it true, Lucien? Are you famous now?\u201d\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d Lucien murmured, and he hurriedly asked them, \u201cWho invited Joel?\u201dUncle Joel would never leave in such a hurry without even telling him first. Besides, even if there was a noble who admired Lucien\u2019s music and thus wanted uncle Joel to be his musician, Lucien should be informed first.\u201cHow dare we ask a lord\u2019s name!\u201d Lizz and some other neighbors shook their heads, \u201cWe saw the lord dressed very decently. And he had many squires and servants.\u201dIt was not right\u2026 Lucien\u2019s heart was torn with anxiety, but Lucien knew that he must stay calm.\u201cAuntie Lizz, do you remember what the lord looked like?\u201d Lucien frowned his brows, \u201cDid uncle Joel leave me any message?\u201d\u201cHow dare we look at a lord\u2019s face!\u201d answered Roy, \u201cI only remember the lord was a very decent gentleman. His hair was all white. Black suit\u2026 and a walking stick. The squires were so strong\u2026 all in their early twenties\u2026\u201dAlthough Roy tried his best to recall it, the information he provided was not really helpful.\u201cJoel did leave a message to you,\u201d said Lizz, \u201cbut nothing really special\u2026 He asked me to tell you that do not worry about him, and he will ask someone to send you a message when he reaches there.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d asked Lucien, putting up with the great anxiety in his mind.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d The neighbors knew nothing else.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAnything wrong, Lucien?\u201d some of the neighbors asked.Taking a deep breath, Lucien calmed himself a bit.\u201cNot really,\u201d Lucien answered. He decided to look for clues first and then inform John. There must be a purpose that they took uncle Joel\u2019s family.Lucien had a spare key for the door. As soon as he entered the place, Lucien\u2019s spiritual power and his soul told him something was indeed not right. Lucien sensed a smell of a stranger in the room, and fortunately, this person did not erase the invisible smell and trail he or she left.And there was a white letter on the table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then he reached his left hand into the pocket and grabbed Ice Revenger. Carefully, he controlled the aura of the ring surrounding his own body, since Lucien speculated that the person leaving the letter should not know that he was a sorcerer, instead of a common young man.The ice coldness from the ring cooled Lucien down. With great caution, Lucien opened the letter using his right hand.This piece of paper was of no special material. It looked like the letter was printed instead of written, since every single letter on the paper was almost too neat.\u201cDear Mr. Evans,It is our great honor to have Mr. Joel and his family with us. As long as you are willing to do us a little favor, we will take good care of them here. When we get what we want, Mr. Joel and his family will be back safe and sound, and with a decent amount of money. It is a fair trade.\u201d\u201cKidnap, I knew it!\u201d Lucien lowered his voice and said to himself, \u201cBut what do they want from me?\u201dSoon after Lucien asked this question, the lines on the paper quickly faded and new black words appeared.\u201cMr. Evans, as a music genius, your calmness is also impressive. Please let me repeat what I said just now\u2014it is a fair deal, not a kidnap. Of course, when we talk about being fair, that means if you betray our agreement, you will never be able to see Joel and his family again.\u201d\u201cIt is a supernatural power\u2026\u201d Lucien\u2019s brain was working very fast. In order to have a bigger chance to save uncle Joel and his family, Lucien couldn\u2019t let these people know the fact that he was a sorcerer as well. This was definitely not a trade, and kidnappers\u2019 promises were never trustworthy. Therefore, Lucien made an immediate decision: instead of passively following the kidnappers\u2019 orders, he should have a careful plan and save uncle Joel and his family himself.At the same time, buying time for planning was also very important. Taking a deep breath, Lucien talked to the piece of paper in a low voice, \u201cWhat do you want me to do? How can I know they\u2019re still alive?\u201dSeveral new lines appeared on the paper again:\u201cWhat we are asking is very simple, Mr. Evans. Use your talent and write more great music works to become Princess Natasha\u2019s long-term music consultant. And we believe that this is also your goal, Mr. Evans. Aren\u2019t we being really considerate? As for Joel and his family, as long as you are willing to work with us, we have no reason to kill them.\u201dMany thoughts quickly passed through Lucien\u2019s mind:\u201cWere they targeting Princess Natasha, or other secrets in Ratacia Palace? I was just invited to be the princess\u2019 temporary music consultant last night, and today these people kidnapped uncle Joel and his family, which was almost impossible, unless\u2026 unless one of them, or even all of them, were among the audience in the concert last night!\u201d\u201cIf I cannot make sure uncle Joel and his family are safe, I will not work with you. You can kill me,\u201d said Lucien decisively.\u201cMr. Evans, I just want to clarify one thing. You are one of our plans, but not the only one. Unfortunately, you are not as important as you think.\u201dLucien sneered, \u201cThen kill them, and kill me.\u201dIt looked like Lucien\u2019s reaction surprised the kidnappers. After the last message disappeared from the paper, nothing new appeared for quite a while.Lucien was extremely nervous. He was not sure if his answer would put uncle Joel and his family to death, but he had no other choice. Lucien must make sure they were still alive. Now it was time to be patient.Finally, several lines emerged on the paper again:\u201cEvery once in a while, we will send you a picture of Joel and his family. Starting from tomorrow. However, since you pissed us off, we decided to send you one of Joel\u2019s fingers tomorrow as well, to relieve your concern, Mr. Evans.\u201d\u201cBastards!\u201d Grinding his teeth with hatred, Lucien said to the kidnappers, \u201cEvery time, the picture you send must contain completely date and time information, or I won\u2019t be able to know if these are fake pictures that you make with your evil power.\u201d Lucien was hoping that he might be able to find some clues from the pictures.\u201cIt won\u2019t be a problem. Deal?\u201d replied the kidnappers.\u201cNot until I see the picture tomorrow. \u201d Lucien was pretending that he knew nothing about magic power, \u201cBut when I see uncle Joel and his family, I\u2019ll keep my word. I swear.\u201d\u201cYour word means nothing.\u201d The lines showed up again, \u201cWe can see. And if you dare report to the princess, we will send Joel and his family to hell in a second.\u201dLucien had no idea how the kidnappers could observe him secretly in the palace. He wanted to know more, since purpose often revealed motive, and motive was the key clue to find the enemies hiding behind this.\u201cWhat specifically do you want me to do? It can\u2019t be just staying close to the princess,\u201d asked Lucien.The writing became a bit hasty, \u201cWe\u2019re more than happy to know the schedule of the princess and the grand duke, as well as other interesting things going on in Ratacia Palace. You just need to write what you know down on this piece of paper with a quill.\u201dThe kidnappers were very crafty, and their real motives remained blurry.\u201cI see,\u201d answered Lucien slowly.\u201cIf you have any need, you\u2019re welcome to ask us for help, Mr. Lucien. Hope we have a nice cooperation.\u201d The new lines were more illegible compared with the previous ones.All the lines disappeared, and the letter returned to a piece of white paper.Lucien removed his left hand from Ice Revenger and instantly felt the supernatural power disappear. Staring at the closed window with an expressionless face, Lucien slowly folded the piece of paper back and put it into the envelope. His heart was full of anger and hatred, and he already figured out who did this.They were the heretics of Argent Horn.With the help of Ice Revenger, when Lucien was opening the envelope, he sensed a tiny amount of supernatural power remained on the paper. When he was communicating with the kidnappers, Lucien was also doing his analysis of the power by comparing it with the different kinds of power he met before. Every time the letters appeared and disappeared, Lucien got one step closer to his conclusion: Firstly, the power was not magic; Secondly, the supernatural power was very similar to the power that Lucien felt from Cardinal Sard and pastor Benjamin. Although Lucien could not tell the specific differences between the magic power he followed and the powers empowered by either God or demons, he was quite sure that what he was facing now was the latter.If Lucien\u2019s observation and speculation were correct, Argent Horn was the most likely, or say, the only possible answer for now.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt looks like there\u2019s a bond between me and these bastards\u2026\u201d Lucien needed to control himself hard from tearing the paper to shreds with anger.\u201cThe piece of white paper should be a magic item of apprentice level. Someone\u2019s eavesdropping on me right now and the person needs to stay relatively close to me\u2026 probably, within a radius of a hundred meters\u2026 Still hard to find, though.\u201d Lucien thought to himself, \u201cAccording to the time it took the kidnapper to reply, the person should be a bit above senior apprentice level.\u201dLucien was a bit encouraged, carrying the hope that he could save Joel and his family. He did not really trust the church, the princess, and the grand duke, since they would only focus on exterminating the heresy, instead of making sure the hostages were safe first. At the same time, Lucien never even considered for a second obeying the heretics\u2019 order. He would never surrender to those untrustworthy bastards.He knew what he was doing here.Walking out of the door, Lucien headed for the noble district.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Meanwhile, he was also much calmer than most of the ordinary people. He knew where to go and what to do right now.Lucien tried to stay focused when he was walking on the street, separating his spiritual power from his body and making the power float in the air, as if his soul was overlooking his body. Lucien wanted to test if there was anyone among the crowd who was following him.However, since Sunday noon was often the busiest time in Aderon, and the kidnapper was currently more powerful than Lucien, he did not find anything special.The gate between Aderon district and the noble district was open, however, this area was not busy at all. Only a few poor people from Aderon who were doing the most menial work in the nobles\u2019 places were going through the gate after going to the church.Two guards were standing there, lazily leaning against the wall and looking at the poor people walking in hurry with some feeling of superiority. The guards were hopeless for becoming real knights, and since they joined the city guard and got spoiled by the prosperity of Aalto, they soon forgot the many fighting skills that they learned from their previous training.All of a sudden, the guards noticed a young good-looking man in decent white shirt and black suite coming toward the gate, which was quite unusual. They stopped Lucien instantly and asked,\u201cSir, what is your purpose entering the noble district?\u201dLucien\u2019s heart was being burned by the great anxiety, thus his attitude was not very nice.\u201cAre you questioning me here? Since when do I have to be questioned first to pass through the gate?\u201dRander, one of the guards, immediately regretted as soon as he stopped the young man in front of him. Without knowing a visitor\u2019s background, stopping the person randomly may put them in trouble since they never knew whether the person was actually a noble or someone important.Lucien\u2019s tough attitude made him even more nervous. He hurriedly apologized, \u201cSorry, sir. We\u2019re having a hard time searching for the demon followers and tend to overreact sometimes. I\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201dLucien slightly nodded and was about to pass through the gate when he changed his mind. He turned to the guard and asked in a low voice, \u201cMay I ask where does the chief clerk of the town hall, Mr. Urbain Hayne, live? I\u2019m his daughter Felicia Hayne\u2019s classmate.\u201dHappening to know where the chief clerk lived, Rander answered, \u201cMr. Hayne lives at no.158 Noble Street, one of the Hayne family\u2019s houses.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201d Lucien replied shortly and walked through the gate.In the noble district, where many knights and even grand knights lived, Lucien expected that the kidnapper from Argent Horn would not be able to follow too close. Therefore, by asking the guard, Lucien purposefully let the kidnapper know where he was going. If the kidnapper still could not follow up, that meant he or she was not at all capable of tailing Lucien for a long time, and then Lucien could find a proper chance to get rid of the kidnapper and conduct his own plan.Staring at Lucien from behind, Rander complained to the other guard, \u201cAlthough the guy dressed like a gentleman, he even didn\u2019t know where the chief clerk lives. Probably there\u2019s something between this effeminate guy and lady Hayne\u2026 who knows\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026It was the second time Lucien came to the noble district. Compared with the stormy night when Baron Laurent died, the noble district looked much more appealing today. Green trees lined up on both sides and flowers flourished. Among the trees stood the big and luxury houses. Many of them were of different architectural styles\u2014some were similar to baroque style, others of religious style, while some were emulating the gloomy and extravagant architectural design of the ancient magic empire. And often there was only one house on each fork of the road.Lucien appeared to be rather weird on the street since he dressed decent but was walking on foot. A few noble ladies and gentlemen passing by in their coaches threw Lucien a surprised glance, certain that Lucien was by no chance a noble.All of a sudden, a coach stopped beside Lucien. The window on the coach opened and inside of the coach sat an elegant young lady of full figure and fine presence, with a black crape bonnet veiling half of her face. She laughed and asked, \u201cIs this Mr. Evans? The concert last night was awesome.\u201dDespite being anxious, Lucien maintained his gentleman manner, \u201cThank you, my lady. Can I have the honor of knowing your name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Yvette Hill, Felicia\u2019s friend.\u201d Yvette glanced at Lucien with great interest, \u201cAre you looking for Felicia, Mr. Evans?\u201dExcluding the family of Violet, the Hill family, together with the Hayne and the Rafati family, were the three most influential noble families in the Duchy of Orvarit. Each of the three families had a whole shire as their domain.Lucien just recognized the coat of arms on the coach consisting of spears and grizzly. He answered with respect, \u201cYes, my lady.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 then you might have to wait a bit, Mr. Evans.\u201d Yvette\u2019s smile was very charming, \u201cSince the concert was a great success, Felicia is still praying in Golden Cathedral to thank the blessing of God. And, by the way, just call me Yvette. I\u2019m a fan of your music, Mr. Evans.\u201d\u201cThen miss Yvette, you just call me Lucien.\u201d Lucien worked at a smile, \u201cI can just wait for Felicia to come back outside of her house.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, Lucien, I can give you a lift.\u201d Yvette took off her crape bonnet and her beautiful face was completely revealed, \u201cYou\u2019re two years younger than me. What a genius you are.\u201dHer maid opened the coach door and invited Lucien to come in. It seemed like Yvette did not worry at all that this might damage her reputation as a noble lady.Lucien did not refuse. As a member of the Hill family, Yvette was also able to get Moonlight Rose. If Felicia rejected Lucien\u2019s request, becoming a friend with lady Yvette would be Lucien\u2019s second possible chance.Entering the carriage, a sweet, alluring scent snuck into Lucien\u2019s nose.\u201cVery nice\u2026 A genius is indeed different,\u201d said Yvette with satisfaction, \u201cMost of the men that I invited before were just hypocritical. They wanted to come in, but they didn\u2019t dare.\u201dLeaning forward, her plump and fair chest was half revealed in front of Lucien.However, Lucien was really not in the mood. Slightly turning his eyes away, Lucien forced a smile, \u201cStick to your own path, and let the irrelevant people say whatever they want to say. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u201cInteresting. I like it.\u201d Yvette\u2019s eyes lit up for a moment, \u201cYou\u2019re more interesting than I thought, Lucien.\u201dThe coach went slowly. Inside of the coach, Yvette was casually talking to Lucien about music, and purposefully made tiny physical contact with Lucien. Unfortunately Lucien\u2019s mind was completely occupied by the kidnapping, and he completely ignored this noble lady\u2019s elaborate seducing. Yvette was quite disappointed.Half an hour later, Yvette\u2019s coach finally stopped in front of a luxurious three-storey house. At the same time, Felicia\u2019s carriage arrived as well.\u201cLucien? Why you\u2019re with Yvette?\u201d Felicia looked at her classmate quizzically.Getting off the coach, Lucien answered, \u201cI was looking for you when I met lady Yvette. She kindly offered me a ride.\u201d\u201cWhat did you do, Yvette?\u201d Felicia looked a bit angry.\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Yvette grinned in her coach, \u201cNo worries, Felicia. I prefer mysterious sorcerers compared with musicians.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Since when you changed your preference?\u201d asked Felicia with surprise.\u201cSince last night,\u201d replied Yvette full of yearning, \u201cLast night during the concert, I heard Cardinal Sard and the grand duke were talking about a mysterious sorcerer called \u2018Professor\u2019. I\u2019m very curious\u2026 after all I haven\u2019t tried any sorcerer yet. I wonder\u2026 these gloomy guys who always hide their faces in their hoods\u2026 what do they look like when they are naked in bed, and how they react when they see a beautiful woman\u2026\u201dAs the youngest daughter of Earl Hill, she was qualified to sit in the same balcony with the grand duke.\u201cYvette\u2026\u201d Felicia was speechless. Although Yvette and Felicia were pretty good friends, Felicia never understood Yvette\u2019s openness with men. As a very maverick noble lady in Aalto, Yvette was even much more open than the noble madams and ladies in the palace of Tria.Lucien was very surprised, not because of Yvette\u2019s openness, but the fact that the church and the grand duke had already found out his pseudonym, \u201cProfessor\u201d.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWas anyone caught that night? Or were there moles among the sorcerers\u2026 Lucien wondered, with his back being covered by a thin layer of cold sweat. Lucien was just about to buy some magic potions that increased his power from the other sorcerers to save Joel and his family. Luckily, he heard the conversation between the noble ladies. What a valuable piece of information!\u201cI have to go now. Bye.\u201d Yvette was happy to see the surprised look on both Felicia and Lucien\u2019s faces. Turning around, Yvette\u2019s coach left.Noticing that Lucien was still staring at the coach in a trance, Felicia sneered at him,\u201cYou want to be part of Yvette\u2019s collection, don\u2019t you?\u201dAnd then she paused a bit and asked, \u201cWhy you came to me today, Lucien?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then Felicia and Lucien walked through the garden in front of the house.\u201cCan I ask you to do me a favor, Felicia?\u201d Lucien looked serious.\u201cA favor?\u201d Felicia slightly frowned her beautiful eyebrows, \u201cMy father\u2019s just a chief clerk, and my uncle never liked us. I\u2019m not sure if I can help.\u201dIf Lucien asked before the concert, Felicia would directly reject him. However, now that Felicia had seen Lucien\u2019s talent, she knew that having a good relationship with Lucien would definitely benefit her a lot. What the noble life taught Felicia in the past years was not only how to enjoy the luxury lifestyle, but also how to weigh the advantages and disadvantages.Lucien spoke to Felicia with a bit hesitation, \u201cI have a good friend, John. He\u2019s currently Lord Venn\u2019s high level knight squire. John\u2019s family offered me lots of help when I was sick and poor. Since last night the concert was a great success, I believe it\u2019s time for me to pay them back. And the best way is to help John become a real knight.\u201d\u201cI think I know what you want now.\u201d Felicia guessed, \u201cYou want to buy Moonlight Rose from me to help your friend awaken his Blessing?\u201d\u201cYes, I believe it\u2019s the best I can do.\u201d Lucien was sort of relieved that Felicia did not doubt his motive.\u201cYou\u2019re a good person, Lucien.\u201d Felicia appreciated his character, \u201cIt\u2019s pleasant to have a friend like you. But Lucien, Moonlight Rose is expensive, and it\u2019s never a guarantee for awakening Blessing. Many nobles tried and failed\u2026\u201dFelicia\u2019s heart slightly sank when she was speaking, since she was one of the nobles she just mentioned.\u201cI did some research about it.\u201d Lucien was trying to make his request as reasonable as possible, \u201cJohn\u2019s a promising young man. Lord Venn might soon award John with some of the dust of the rose, but it probably won\u2019t be enough. The more dust of Moonlight Rose John has, the better the chance he would have to successfully awaken his Blessing. I want to help John with it.\u201dA beautiful smile appeared on Felicia\u2019s face. She slightly nodded, \u201cWell\u2026 you\u2019re really something, Lucien. How much do you want, then?\u201d\u201cFifty grams.\u201d Lucien needed to make sure that he would have enough of the ingredients to make the potion named Crying Soul, including the possible failures during the process.\u201cWhat? That\u2019s too much!\u201d Felicia was very surprised, \u201cBased on my status in the family, I can only buy up to ten grams.\u201dAlthough Felicia\u2019s father and the current Earl Hayne were brothers, they had a poor relationship with each other due to the many years of contending for power. Thanks to the generous legacy left by the previous Earl, Felicia\u2019s grandfather, Felicia\u2019s family could still maintain a decent noble lifestyle.\u201cFelicia, can you figure out a way to get more? As much as possible\u2026\u201d Lucien came up with another reason, \u201cI heard people say that the dust of Moonlight Rose can also improve one\u2019s coordination. I might need some as well to improve my piano playing skill. I\u2019ll never forget your help, Felicia.\u201dCrossing her hands together, many thoughts flashed through Felicia\u2019s mind. As friends, she could help Lucien with ten grams of the rose. However, now Lucien was asking way more than that, then Felicia needed to see how she could benefit from it.Lucien did not urge Felicia, leaving her some time to consider. A while later Felicia said to Lucien seriously, \u201cTen grams from my father. Yvette and Melissa, ten grams each. Lucien, forty grams is my limit, and I won\u2019t do this for free.\u201dAlthough Felicia did not have any title, and her family status was not very superordinate, as a noble, Felicia\u2019s social circle was still of great value.\u201cForty grams\u2026 Well, let\u2019s do forty grams. Thank you so much, Felicia, and what you want me to do?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cMy request is simple and easy.\u201d Felicia smiled, \u201cFirstly, you gotta pay me in advance. Secondly, my birthday party will be held next month, and I want you to be there on my birthday and play several songs in front of the guests. And thirdly, I want you to teach me how to play piano, how to compose, and offer me your help as much as possible in music field, such as introducing my future music work to the princess.\u201dFelicia heard that Princess Natasha appreciated piano very much. Among her three requests, without doubt, the most important one was the last. Every time a new piece of musical instrument was invented, many musicians were thus inspired and became famous with their new music works. Felicia did not want to miss this precious chance.Since she held little hope in becoming Mr. Victor\u2019s honor student, learning from her talented classmate who was now the personal music consultant of the princess was not bad.\u201cYou have my word, Felicia.\u201d Lucien agreed, and he said silently in his mind, \u201c\u2026as long as I\u2019m still in Aalto at that time. Even if I were to leave, I\u2019d do something else to compensate for it.\u201dFelicia trusted Lucien\u2019s good character. She nodded and said, \u201cForty Thales. Give me two days.\u201d\u201cTwo days is fine. But Felicia\u2026\u201d said Lucien with embarrassment, \u201cI only have thirty Thales for now. The rest of it, ten Thales\u2026 Can I pay you back in five months? You know I\u2019m currently working for the princess. The salary should not be a problem.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 all right,\u201d agreed Felicia. \u201cPay me back as soon as possible. The ten Thales will come from my savings. Don\u2019t let me go broke, Lucien.\u201d\u201cThank you so much, Felicia!\u201d Lucien was excited, although his bellying moneybag instantly shriveled.After all, buying Moonlight Rose was Lucien\u2019s top priority for now. Lucien was very grateful that he had the chance to enter the music circle in Aalto and thus got to know the nobles like Felicia, or he would have no choice but to go to the black market or join another sorcerer group to find the rose, which would be way more risky.Leaving Felicia\u2019s place, Lucien bought some good-quality bread and beef on his way home.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026By cooking and eating, Lucien calmed himself down. Closing the door and the windows, he took out the envelope from the crate and opened the letter again.Within his expectations, there were a few lines on the paper, \u201cWhy did you go to the noble district and met your classmate? You stayed in the garden with her for more than twenty minutes, and we saw it. Don\u2019t act like an idiot, Mr. Evans.\u201dLucien sneered in his mind. It looked like the bastards used other ways to trail Lucien instead of marking him with their fiend power, in case Lucien would be detected by the many divine power circles placed in Ratacia Palace.Since Lucien also understood about supernatural power, he was quite sure about it.Lucien answered honestly, \u201cI went to buy Moonlight Rose from Felicia to help John. You kidnapped Joel and his families, and I\u2019m not sure if they can come back safe and sound. John is the only one in the family I can take care of for now.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA few sentences appeared, \u201cTaking care of John? We know what you want to do. Please stop daydreaming, Mr. Evans. It\u2019s not easy at all to awaken the Blessing, or there would be way more knights in the world. Since your stupidness and recklessness is very impressive, we decided to give you a bonus\u2014a finger from Alisa.\u201d\u201cGod damn it!\u201d Lucien swore in his mind, which was filled with hatred.At the same time, Lucien took out a quill and started transcribing the sentences on the back of a piece of used paper. The great hatred was burning Lucien\u2019s guts like fire, while his brain was as cool as a piece of ice. The strange mixture of fire and ice shaped Lucien\u2019s character.Lucien was transcribing the sentences to figure out if the kidnappers could see what he was doing now!He would not start making Crying Soul until he knew more about these bastards.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Or you\u2019ll receive a body!\u201dThe quill dropped on the ground. Lucien pretended that he was scared, \u201cI was just\u2026 just trying to make some notes\u2026 in case I might forget some of your requests\u2026\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t see any necessity to take this ridiculous notes. This is your last chance, Mr. Evans. Keep taking similar actions if you\u2019re looking forward to a dead body. Let me remind you\u2026 Thanks to what you did, one more finger for you tomorrow.\u201d replied the kidnappers.Of course, the fact that uncle Joel and auntie Alisa were hurt was very painful to Lucien, however, he couldn\u2019t let the feeling of guiltiness and pain affect his judgement too much. From the moment Lucien decided not to cooperate with the kidnappers, he knew that there must be a cost. What he could do was minimise the cost as much as possible.\u201cI\u2019ll behave.\u201d Lucien tore the used paper up.\u201cThe kidnappers can see me. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d Lucien silently thought in his mind, \u201cBut how? Are they observing me through the letter, or with something else? I shall figure this out next, but not in a hurry, in case they will find out what I\u2019m trying to do.\u201dPutting the letter back in the crate, Lucien lay in his bed, pretending he was totally out, while trying to cover the whole shack with his spiritual power to sense if there was any supernatural power around. At this time, using spells to help with the detection might put him in big trouble, since Lucien knew that his current biggest advantage was that the heretics did not know he was actually a sorcerer.Except for the letter in the crate, nothing supernatural was detected in the shack.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026In the afternoon, Lucien came to Gesu district and found the house at no. 116, that Elena introduced to him.The location was even better than Lucien thought. Located beside the city wall, the house was far away from the gate, and thus the place was very quiet and isolated. Only a few two-storey small houses were sitting a distance away from no. 116, almost fully shaded by the many tall trees named Rava.Earlier, Lucien had made an appointment with the agent. Knocking at the gate, he waited in front of the iron fence.Soon a middle-aged man walked out from no. 116 and opened the gate. His beard was well-trimmed and his brown suit was neatly ironed. The agent looked pretty shrewd.\u201cYou must be Mr. Evans,\u201d The man greeted Lucien, \u201cI\u2019m Brian. It\u2019s very nice to meet you. Everyone in the Association is talking about you.\u201dLucien nodded and extended his right hand to shook hands with Brian. Brian took a step forward and held Lucien\u2019s right hand with his both hands, to show his respect. Facing such a promising young musician whose talent was already recognized by the grand duke and the princess, Brian, of course, would show his greatest esteem for Lucien.\u201cPlease let me lead you into the house and take a look around, Mr. Evans.\u201d Brian slightly bowed.Under Brian\u2019s guidance, Lucien walked throughout the house and found that although the size of the garden and the lawn were not big, inside the house the decoration style was very elegant and unique. Compared with the present luxurious \u201cTria Palace\u201d trend in decoration, this house looked neat in a very tasteful way.The only disadvantage of the house was that the tall trees and the city wall shaded most of the sunlight, and thus the place looked a bit gloomy especially with the vines covering the outside of the house.\u201cIt\u2019s a very, very quiet place, with no bright sunlight disturbing your music creation work.\u201d Brian tried to persuade Lucien to see this as an advantage instead of something not ideal, although poor lighting was the only reason that they were having a hard time renting the house out.Lucien did not mind the poor lighting at all, since this could provide him with a safer environment to conduct his magic experiments. So he nodded, \u201cDo you have the lease agreement with you?\u201dBrian was very happy, trying hard to prevent his crafty smile from showing on his face. He took out a pile of papers and handed them to Lucien.Taking a rough look at the lease agreement, Lucien signed his name on it and took out a Thale from his moneybag. Luckily, as a rather promising musician, Lucien did not have to pay any security deposit.Brian quickly wrote the receipt and took care of the agreement, and then handed a copy back to Lucien.\u201cThis is a house with a decent size, Mr. Evans. You\u2019ll need at least\u2026 a steward, four servants, a cook, a gardener, a coach and a coachman. I can find these people for you from other associations,\u201d offered Brian fawningly.\u201cI\u2019m pretty busy recently, and I won\u2019t be moving in very soon. You can bring them here next Monday and let me have a look.\u201d Lucien agreed but postponed it for a week, since he did not want anything to disturb him from saving Joel and his family. This week would be the key time for him to save the hostages.Brian handed the keys to Lucien and left briskly. Lucien was by himself standing in the living room, staring at the stairs to the second floor.There were four bedrooms, a study, a music practicing room and a decent-sized patio on the second floor. On the ground floor, there was a living room, a dining room, four servant rooms, a storage room, and there was also a basement. The kitchen was isolated, connected with the house by a door on the left. And the sewers were well-built, linked to the whole sewer system of Aalto.If the kidnapping had not happened, Lucien would feel very excited and proud that he finally moved into such a nice place. However, now the only thing Lucien felt was anger and anxiety.After a while, Lucien went back to his shack. He brought some clothes with him and took them back to the new house.He left his clothes in the master bedroom and walked into the practicing room, which was built with a special kind of stone to prevent the sound from disturbing other people, and at the same time, to create a nice reverberation effect.He closed the door and the curtain. The whole room was very quiet. Except for his own footsteps, Lucien could hear nothing else.Sitting in the rocking chair, Lucien rocked himself back and forth in the darkness. Spreading his spiritual power within the room, he was carefully sensing the surroundings.He wondered how the heretics would observe him without the letter.For quite a while, Lucien found nothing. His awareness gradually reached out to every corner of the room.At that moment, Lucien finally sensed what he was looking for\u2014a tiny disturbance wave caused by a supernatural power, and he heard something buzzing lightly.He didn\u2019t open his eyes and pretended to be asleep while thinking to himself, \u201cAalto Tigorid Mosquito? Did they mark the mosquito with their fiend power or was it directly Transfiguration?\u201dLucien\u2019s purpose was already achieved. Now he was sure that the heretics were using the letter for both communicating and monitoring. However, when Lucien was away from the letter, they needed to use other ways to trail him.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The letter did not mention anything special in the evening, but only reminded Lucien to bring the letter with him if he was moving out.Staring at the the shades of the night, Lucien kept repeating the process of making Crying Soul in his mind, to get familiar with it. However, it was not the proper time to make the potion yet. Lucien still had to take care of several things first.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the morning of the second day, when Lucien was about to go outside, he noticed that there was a ball of paper beneath the door.His heart suddenly sank. Lucien knew what was in it.Slowly opening the paper ball, Lucien saw three fingers\u2014two were long but with heavy callus, and one was stubby. The fractured white bones were slightly reflecting the sunlight.Lucien closed his eyes to hold back his tears and to hide the anger and hatred. When he opened his eyes again, he also noticed a small black ball wrapped in the paper, with a scarlet line of words beside.\u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted, Mr. Evans.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Within his expectations, a few lines of words just emerged.\u201cIt seems like you received our gift already. The three fingers are just a warning for you. Don\u2019t do stupid things, or we\u2019ll have no choice but to kill Joel and his family. We can see you, and we\u2019re way more powerful than you think. The ball is called Scene. Crumble the ball, and you\u2019ll see what you want.\u201dLucien already sensed the magnetism of the small ball, which should be able to function like a camera. Thus, without hesitation, Lucien destroyed the ball with his hand.Dark smoke came out from the ball, and the smoke gradually took the shape of a black and white screen, showing Lucien a short moving scene.In the video, Joel, Alisa and Iven were sitting around a wooden table. Iven\u2019s eyes were half closed, looking rather sleepy, while Joel and Alisa looked very worried, with their hands swathed in bandages. From the window of the log cabin, Lucien could tell it was late at night. Few dim stars were hanging in the sky, and the silver moon was shaded by the clouds.The moving scene lasted for a minute.On the letter, new sentences emerged, \u201cMr. Evans, now you see they are still alive. We\u2019ll send you more scenes when the weather changes. We believe that the weather, the stars and the silver moon can provide you with enough information to tell the different dates. You see, we always value our words.\u201d\u201cThat is a good relief to me,\u201d wrote Lucien, \u201cWhat shall I say if John comes back?\u201dWhile Lucien was asking, he was picturing in his mind the sky that he just saw from the ball. What he was trying to do was to tell what stars they were based on the stellar map drawn by the witch in her notes. Combining the season, the arrangement and the brightness of the stars, as well as the angle that Lucien was observing the sky through the window, Lucien was confident he could find some valuable information from this one-minute moving scene. After all, Astrology was his speciality. From the several apprentice meetings that he attended before, Lucien already had a solid understanding in apprentice level Astrology, and as a college student crossing over, his knowledge in Astrology was relatively more advanced compared with the ancient system.The letter replied, \u201cJust tell him honestly. We don\u2019t care about a knight squire, and we bet he wouldn\u2019t dare to risk his family\u2019s lives. And you, Mr. Evans, be careful when you go to Ratacia Palace tomorrow.\u201dEvery Tuesday and Thursday, Lucien was scheduled to go to Ratacia Palace to meet the princess and discuss music with her. If the princess had extra need, she would summon Lucien at any time, and there would also be an extra pay for him.The words on the letter gradually disappeared one by one. Finally, the paper returned to normal blank. Folding the letter and wrapping up the three fingers, Lucien put them back into the crate.\u2026On his way to the Musicians\u2019 Association, Lucien\u2019s mind was fully occupied with the stars.\u201cI made my request yesterday, then the ball and the fingers arrived today. So first of all, uncle Joel and his family should still be somewhere close to Aalto. A village, small town, or even a forest\u2026 all possible.\u201dLucien\u2019s brain was working hard. By comparing the stellar maps in his spiritual library and through lots of calculations of the coordinates of the stars, Lucien identified the few stars that he saw from the scene. Looking up the star list in the spiritual library, Lucien targeted one of the stars and found out its detailed record.\u201cThe log cabin should be\u2026 about 20 kilometers west of Aalto. That is to say\u2026\u201d Lucien was looking up a simple map of Aalto and its surroundings stored in his own library, \u201cthe cabin is deep within Melzer Black Forest!\u201dDrawing a circle on the map, Lucien was very excited. Although he still couldn\u2019t accurately locate where uncle Joel and his family were, and he was also not sure about how powerful the heretics were, knowing that Joel, Alisa and Iven were not far away from him provided him with a bit comfort.Lucien hoped that the next time he saw the scene the log cabin would still be there. Then he would be able to narrow down the range further.Trying to calm himself down, Lucien sighed silently, \u201cEvery step is so tough.\u201d He knew that, currently, he was still not prepared to save Joel and his family.\u2026The two ladies who were on duty today in the association\u2019s lobby weren\u2019t familiar to Lucien. One of them stood up and bowed slightly, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Evans. Your personal office has been assigned by Mr. Hank. Please go to Mr. Hank\u2019s office when you have time.\u201dLucien was about to find a quiet practicing room. Now it was a surprise for him to have his own office, which was great for his plan.A while later, being led by Mr. Hank, Lucien entered his own office on the third floor.\u201cEvans, this is your office now. Unless you join other countries\u2019 music associations, until the last day of your life, the office will still be yours.\u201dThe building of the Musician\u2019s Association was magnificent. A courtyard was surrounded by seventy to eighty different rooms on the third floor, but almost half of them were currently vacant, since many of the famous musicians in Aalto had been invited to other countries.The office was decorated with a brown carpet, fine statues, paintings and lights. The dark blue couch looked very comfy, beside which stood a decent red wood desk. A milk-white piano was in the corner of the office. And there was also a den in the office, where the musician could rest a bit in the bed without being disturbed.\u201cIt\u2019s a great room.\u201d Lucien smiled politely, \u201cThank you, Mr. Hank.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re more than welcome, Evans. And just call me Hank.\u201d Hank nodded.After Hank left, Lucien closed the office door and walked back and forth in his office with great anger and anxiety.He was holding back his emotion when he saw the fingers. Now he was by himself, Lucien could not take it anymore.All of a sudden Lucien sat in front of the piano and pressed the keys with both of his hands. It was Symphony of Fate that Lucien was playing.When the sound of the piano became louder and louder, Lucien started swearing in a low voice:\u201cBastards! Jerks! You f**king evil kidnappers!\u201d\u2026The swearing was not only for venting, Lucien was testing to what extent the kidnappers could monitor him.When he Finished playing, Lucien stood up and gave out a long sigh. Even if the heretics did hear his swearing just now, he could still explain to them that he was doing this was to prepare himself for the meeting with the princess tomorrow.However, when Lucien came back to his home in Aderon, he only found a simple sentence on the letter.\u201cMusic is an ideal way to release emotions, Mr. Evans.\u201dAlthough the kidnappers just wanted to remind Lucien that he was under their surveillance all the time, the message offered Lucien another piece of valuable information\u2014the method the kidnappers were using couldn\u2019t let them hear Lucien very well!\u2026At two o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Lucien arrived at Victor\u2019s place on time.Although without saying anything, the way Athy looked at Lucien was filled with gratefulness. Athy had been accompanying Victor for many years, and he was sincerely glad that the concert was a great success.Renee, Colin and David were also there. They stood up and greeted, \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Evans.\u201dAlthough Lucien\u2019s success was not yet well-known among the common residents in Aalto, Renee, Colin and David had heard about it from Felicia and Annie\u2019s conversation. All of a sudden they felt Lucien became strange in their eyes, and they subconsciously treated Lucien the same way they greeted their teacher Mr. Victor.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI still feel it\u2019s sort of unreal until now.\u201d Lott stood up from the couch and gave Lucien a hug, smiling.Felicia also walked close to Lucien, and whispered in his ear, \u201cTomorrow afternoon, I shall be able to give you the roses.\u201d\u201cThank you. Thanks a lot, Felicia,\u201d said Lucien sincerely.Standing beside them, Lott almost could not believe his eyes.\u201cSince when they became this close to each other?\u201d Lott wondered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She slightly smiled and took a step forward.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, in order to celebrate the great success of the concert and the achievement Lucien made with his Symphony of Fate, I want to invite everyone to the ball on Friday evening in my family\u2019s house. Mr. Victor agreed, and now I want to see how many of us want to attend the ball.\u201dAlthough Felicia was not willing to let other of her classmates have a close relationship with Lucien like she already did, she understood that purposefully excluding the other classmates was not a good way to leave a favorable impression on Lucien.\u201cReally? I\u2019d love to!\u201d Renee put a big smile on her face, \u201cIt\u2019s my great pleasure!\u201dAll of the other students promised to go as well.\u201cWhat about you, Lucien?\u201d Felicia smiled.An idea suddenly flashed through Lucien\u2019s mind. He nodded and answered, \u201cOf course, Felicia.\u201dThe other students looked even more excited hearing that Lucien would attend the ball as well.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, let\u2019s save the excitement for the Friday.\u201d Mr. Victor walked downstairs with books under his arm, looking rather energized, \u201cNow we have to start studying.\u201dLucien was about to find a seat to sit down when Lott stopped him. Lott whispered in Lucien\u2019s ear, \u201cI heard that Mekanzi doesn\u2019t like you at all. Be careful when you\u2019re in the palace.\u201d\u201cThank you, Lott. I will,\u201d replied Lucien politely. However, his mind was fully focused on how to save Joel and his family. Lucien knew clearly that the longer he waited, the less chances he would have to save them. He was really not in the mood to consider how to deal with Mekanzi.Meanwhile, Lucien was also aware of the fact that he also had to be very patient. Unwisely rushing would put Joel and his family in great danger.At that moment, Lucien felt like he was tightrope walking over a cliff. He had to find his balance between being patient and being ready to seize the chance. Leaning too much toward either side would instantly throw him off the wire.With the outstanding memory and proper ways of studying, now Lucien could read most of the materials with ease. Immersing himself in the world of music, for a moment Lucien was distracted from his anxiety.And a bold plan was gradually taking shape in his mind.Finishing today\u2019s study, Lucien went back to his shack, wrapped some stuff up and brought them to his rented house.Everything seemed to be quite normal. Thus, when Lucien took out the letter at night, there were only a few simple sentences on it:\u201cBe careful tomorrow. Don\u2019t do stupid things. We\u2019re watching.\u201d\u2026\u2026Lucien had a sound sleep last night, and he felt rather revitalized when he woke up.\u201cToday is very important. I can\u2019t make any mistake.\u201d Lucien thought to himself.Nothing new was on the letter. After having breakfast, Lucien came to the association and found a practicing room. He started playing the piano to reduce his anxiety.Lucien was still not skilled enough to perfectly play Symphony of Fate. After reviewing the basic fingering, Lucien started to play Beethoven\u2019s Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, commonly known as Sonata Path\u00e9tique.He did not know why he found special affection in Beethoven\u2019s music works. Maybe it was because he could understand the sufferings and the pain Beethoven went through, and he appreciated the music master\u2019s perseverance and heroic spirit.Since Lucien never practiced Sonata Path\u00e9tique before, his playing was pretty horrible. However, playing this piece of music over and over again became a good way for Lucien to exhaust himself and thus to release the pressure.Later Lucien took a break in his office.Someone knocked at the door of Lucien\u2019s office at ten thirty. It was Elena.\u201cLucien. The princess\u2019s coach is waiting for you in the front.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be right there. Thanks, Elena,\u201d replied Lucien.He slowly stood up from the couch and walked toward the mirror. Staring at himself in the mirror for thirty seconds, Lucien took a deep breath and walked out of his office.\u2026\u2026Sitting straight inside of the dark purple coach decorated with the coat of arms of the Violet family, Lucien felt the movement of the coach was rather smooth. The dark yellow carpet made in Tria was thick and comfy, and the wine on the small table had a nice deep ruby red color. However, Lucien did not feel like having a drink at all, since he had to make sure he would stay sober and calm in the palace.A bit more than ten minutes later, the coach arrived at Ratacia Palace on time. The magnificent front gate of the palace was made of stone and was engraved with relief sculptures of many famous heroes in history. A dozen of guards led by a mighty and muscular knight were standing in front of the gate.After a security check of Lucien\u2019s personal belongings, the knight waved his hand and let the coach pass.As soon as Lucien entered the huge gate, he sensed the solemn and mighty divine power enveloping the whole palace.This light golden-colored palace was the most spectacular and magnificent structure in Aalto. Besides its great momentum, the details of Ratacia Palace were also created with exquisite handcraft. The symmetrical architecture showed the majesty of the grand duke house. The two castle-like palaces in both western and eastern wings were connected by a grand palace complex in the center.In front of the main palace there was a large square with fine spray fountains, covered with rare and beautiful trees and flowers.A broad artificial river ran through the square, in which a few boats were floating by the river bank.The coach which Lucien was sitting in followed the avenue going through the garden and crossed the long bridge over the artificial river, and it finally stopped right in front of the main palace. Two beautiful maids were already waiting there.\u201cMr. Evans, please follow us to the princess\u2019 music practicing room.\u201d The two blond-haired girls looked like twins. They greeted Lucien with respect.\u201cThank you.\u201d Lucien nodded politely.Following the two maids, he saw more details of the palace on his way to the practicing room. The designers and the architects used the finest colorful stone as the main building material of the palaces, and all the different kinds of stones were shining brightly in the sunlight. Inside of the palaces, the stairs and the handrails were carefully gilded, and according to the different themes of the palaces, dazzling decorations such as huge crystals, fine white laces and gorgeous dome paintings could be seen everywhere.Being very familiar with the path, neither of the maids talked to Lucien on the way but just walked in front of him. They were trained to be respectful and remain silent. Soon Lucien came to a very charming corridor.Facing the direction of the garden, there were twenty-four arched windows on one side of the corridor, while on the other side, twenty-four mirrors were reflecting the beauty of the sight in the garden, as if the corridor was also fully planted with the fine trees and flowers, which added radiance and beauty to the magnificent huge dome painting above.This was the best-known part of Ratacia Palace\u2014the Paradise Corridor. Lucien had read about it before, when he was working in the Association\u2019s library.Passing Paradise Corridor, which featured the great style of divinity, Lucien finally arrived at the palace where princess Natasha lived. The palace had a unique name\u2014War Gallery. Here Lucien saw many fine oil paintings showing the theme of war on the walls.\u201cThis is the princess\u2019s practicing room, Mr. Evans.\u201d The two maids led Lucien to a quiet room in the corner, and asked him to wait for a moment outside, since they had to report to lady Camil first.A moment later, Lucien was invited to enter the room.\u2026\u2026The practicing room was way bigger than any one in the association. The warm and sweet orange color of the room was peaceful and soothing. The carpet was very fancy, on which different kinds of musical instruments were carefully placed, and in the center of the room stood a light golden piano.Natasha was sitting in front of the piano, playing a piece of music called March of War. Her playing was very skilled, even better than many professional instrumentalists. However, it seemed like she was mimicking Victor\u2019s fingering intentionally, and thus her playing sounded a bit rigid.In her black dress, Camil was sitting in the couch at the far end of the room.Natasha stopped playing when Lucien came into the room. She turned around and smiled to him, \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time here following Victor\u2019s new fingering. Can you help me, Lucien?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe talked to Lucien in a nice way, as if he was her old friend.\u201cOf course. It\u2019s my great pleasure.\u201d Lucien sat on the other bench and started to explain.Lucien knew that the princess was very interested in piano and thus he was relatively well-prepared for the possible questions the princess might have. Although he could not make a perfect explanation, Lucien was very honest and sincere, which made Natasha feel that when Lucien was providing her with the proper guidance she needed, at the same time they were also learning and exploring piano together.Time passed quickly. When Lucien was still introducing the new fingering, all of a sudden Natasha looked at him and asked, \u201cLucien, is your mind being bothered by something? I can feel your anxiety.\u201dAs a level five grand knight, Natasha\u2019s intuition told her that something was wrong with Lucien. With the outspokenness in her personality, the princess asked directly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Please forgive me, Your Grace.\u201dAt the same time, Lucien had a good relief in his mind, \u201cFinally\u2026 the princess asked.\u201dThe anxiety, the restlessness and the nervousness that Natasha noticed were all conveyed by Lucien purposefully.Lifting her beautiful eyebrows, Natasha said to Lucien, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of me because I\u2019m a princess or a knight, Lucien. A man can respect or even worship someone else, but not be intimidated. That\u2019s the spirit of men, the spirit of knights.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll work on it. Although I have a rather poor background, I\u2019ll get better.\u201d Lucien was a bit surprised by Natasha\u2019s comment, but he still answered properly.A gorgeous smile appeared on Natasha\u2019s face, \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re already much braver than most people. Many of them couldn\u2019t even speak properly the first time they saw me, while you\u2019re brave enough to stare at Silvia\u2019s legs the first time you saw her. Impressive.\u201dNatasha was talking about it pretty casually, as if it was just a joke.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m terribly sorry. It was the first time I saw silk stocking\u2026 I sort of forgot myself\u2026\u201d explained Lucien awkwardly, \u201cI\u2019m not a pervert\u2026\u201dThe left corner of Natasha\u2019s lips curled up, \u201cI totally understand, Lucien. Both ladies and gentlemen like the interesting byproduct of alchemy, and you\u2019re not excluded, of course. Silk stockings is precious since the magic empire was destroyed and the ancient alchemy was lost many years ago.\u201d\u201cI appreciate your understanding, Your Grace.\u201d Lucien nodded.\u201cBut you looked at Silvia for a pretty long time, which was not common. Are you really not a pervert?\u201d Natasha asked Lucien with great interest. She was making fun of him.\u201cI\u2019m not. In fact, I haven\u2019t touched a girl\u2019s hand yet, in my whole life,\u201d admitted Lucien to justify his innocence.\u201cOh\u2026 I\u2026 see\u2026\u201d Natasha drawled purposefully, \u201cToo bad for a seventeen-year-old boy. But now it won\u2019t be a problem anymore, after the concert. There will be lots of girls having interest in you. Do you want me to introduce you to some ladies? Although all of them will end up marrying nobles, it\u2019s not bad to have some sweet memories before getting married.\u201d\u201cYour\u2026 Your Grace, thank you for your good will but I want to devote myself to music in the next few years. You don\u2019t have to introduce me to any lady,\u201d refused Lucien, seriously.\u201cI don\u2019t have to?\u201d The princess did not have enough fun yet, \u201cSo you want to pursue them on your own? I can teach you some secrets to win the heart of a young lady. I\u2019m good at it. Silvia, that little wild cat, she likes me\u2026\u201dCamil all of a sudden started coughing and cut off Natasha.\u201cYour Grace, I feel this topic\u2019s a bit weird.\u201d said Lucien. He felt the princess was very approachable, but the conversations they had always tended to go somewhere else.Natasha glanced at Camil sitting on the other side and asked with surprise, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? It\u2019s no more than a common conversation between guys.\u201dFinally, Lucien realized the problem, \u201cYes, between guys, but you\u2019re a noble lady, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, Lucien.\u201d Natasha shrugged, \u201cActually I can teach you more about how to pursue a girl than many guys.\u201dLucien did not know what to say.\u201cAll right, all right\u2026\u201d She waved her hand and smiled, \u201cLook at your nervous face, Lucien. Let\u2019s switch back to music.\u201dShe was glad that Lucien was not like the many other nobles. Most of them directly refused to talk about this and viewed it as an improper topic for chatting.\u201cAs for the playing skills we just mentioned\u2026\u201d Lucien was a bit relieved.\u201cI got a question.\u201d Natasha was behaving like a good student.\u201cYes, please?\u201d Lucien was waiting for the question.\u201cYou sure you don\u2019t need any of my suggestion about pursuing girls?\u201d Natasha laughed loudly.\u201c\u2026\u201d Lucien was speechless.An hour flew by. Natasha was inspired and kept working on her composing. Camil stood up and walked Lucien out.In front of the gate, Camil said to Lucien in a low voice, \u201cAbout the princess\u2026 don\u2019t be a gossiper.\u201dLucien nodded seriously.\u2026After having lunch, Lucien came to Victor\u2019s place and waited for Felicia patiently.\u201cMr. Athy, please sprinkle some sulphur in the living room. In the Month of Harvest, there are many mosquitos around.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201d Athy nodded.Felicia arrived half an hour earlier that day, knowing that Lucien must be waiting for the roses. In the corner of the living room, she took out a unique black bag with embroidered flame patterns on it and handed it to Lucien.\u201cForty grams of dried Moonlight Rose. The roses were ground into dust already. This special bag can make the dust of Moonlight Rose last much longer. You can return the bag to me when you finish using it.\u201d\u201cThanks a lot, Felicia.\u201d With great excitement, Lucien opened the small black bag, in which the fine white powder was shining like a beautiful dream.After roughly weighing the bag, Lucien put it in his pocket, \u201cI\u2019ll pay the money back to you as soon as possible, Felicia.\u201d\u201cI hope so. That was my personal savings.\u201d Felicia smiled, and then she sniffed a bit, \u201cWhy I smell sulphur here?\u201d\u201cTo drive the mosquitos and bugs away,\u201d answered Lucien casually.\u2026Lucien made more mistakes than usual this afternoon, although he was trying hard to stay focused. Luckily, Mr. Victor did not say anything about it, thinking Lucien might need some more time to adjust to the big changes that the great success of the concert brought into his life.Finally, the class ended at six in the evening. Lucien came back to his shack in Aderon, wrapped up some of his stuff in a small box and cooked himself dinner. After all that, he opened the letter again.\u201cMr. Evans, you did a good job in front of the princess today. We hope you can be calmer, since your nervousness made you a bit suspicious. Talented as you are, we believe that it is not too hard.\u201dThe heretics did not ask anything about the conversations Lucien had with the princess and what he saw in the palace. Lucien could tell they were trying to make him believe they had everything under their control.Putting on a worried look, Lucien folded the letter and put it into the small box. Then he carried the box with him and left for his rented house in Gesu district.In the house, Lucien put down the box in the master bedroom and took out a music book. It seemed like he would stay there for the night.When it was getting late, Lucien lay down in the bed and soon stood up again, looking a bit irritated, \u201cThe sheet is so soggy! Brian should find someone to dry the sheet first before asking me to move in!\u201dThen he stepped out of his bedroom and left the house, leaving the small box in his new place.\u2026After closing the window and locking the door, now Lucien was lying in his small bed in his shabby shack.Ten minutes later, Lucien jumped out of the bed again and swore, \u201cThese bloody mosquitos!\u201dIn the crate Lucien found some sulphur and he sprinkled the sulphur in the every corner of his place. He wanted all the annoying mosquitos and bugs to leave right now.Then he went back to bed and closed his eyes with satisfaction.In the night, Lucien faintly sensed the existence of a supernatural power in his shack, like a pair of eyes staring at him in the air.Without the help of Aalto Tigorid Mosquito, the heretics finally started to monitor him directly using their fiend power.Pretending to be sleeping, Lucien waited patiently. An hour later, the magic eyes disappeared, but soon came back again.\u201cThe duration is about an hour.\u201d Lucien thought to himself.Within his expectation, an hour later, the eyes disappeared again. Maybe the kidnappers believed that Lucien was just sleeping, or maybe they were changing shifts. Ten minutes later, Lucien sensed the eyes again.Thirty minutes later, the eyes, all of a sudden, disappeared for the third time.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnd Lucien knew that now it was time for him to take action!He jumped out of the bed swiftly and messed up his blanket and sheet to give the kidnappers a false impression that someone was still sleeping in the bed.Recently in Aderon, there were night watchers patrolling at night, and they could easily target the existence of the fiend power. Lucien knew that the heretics would not take the risk of being found by the church.Seizing the chance, Lucien sneaked into his underground magic lab.Lucien was aware that his whole plan was very risky, however, in the current situation, he did not have a second choice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was no scent of any strangers, but only the slight smell of sulphur coming from the secret air vent.In the first half an hour, Lucien was doing meditation to stay focused, and more importantly, to wait until the night watchers left and the heretics started to monitor his room again.After making sure nothing on the ground went wrong, Lucien started to activate the magic circles engraved on the table with his spiritual power. Then he took out a tube of Revenant dust, three Corpse Mushrooms, some brain tissue of the aquatic zombie and some other reagents.Wearing the gloves, Lucien picked up a Corpse Mushroom with a silver dagger and moved it into a magic circle for weighing.\u201c6.72 grams.\u201d In his spirit library, Lucien recorded the weight of the mushroom, as well as the amount of usage of other materials and reagents. He put the mushroom into a glass container with magic runes on it, and then weighed a dry glass beaker.Lucien watched carefully when he was putting Revenant dust into the dry breaker and stopped when there were 3 grams of the dust in it. Using the same method, Lucien weighed out 10 grams of Moonlight Rose dust.Then he turned to the brain tissue. Lucien grabbed the dagger and carefully cut it.As if the aquatic zombie\u2019s brain tissue was still alive, the moment Lucien\u2019s dagger touched it, the brain tissue suddenly shrank, as if many worms were living inside of it.Cold and sticky as the brain was, Lucien almost threw up when he was cutting it. All of a sudden the phantom of countless ferocious aquatic zombies and revenants appeared in front of Lucien\u2019s eyes. Their skin and flesh were rotten, teeth were bleeding, and the smell of corpses was more than disgusting.Lucien frowned his eyebrows to stay focused. Following the structure of the cortex, he took out the inner part of the brain.And the phantom instantly disappeared. The rest of the brain tissue gradually calmed down.After weighing the brain tissue, Lucien put a black thick pot on the magic flame circle and adjusted the flame bit by bit until the color of the flame became a mix of gold and white.Lucien threw the Corpse Mushroom into the pot and added a small amount of water. Then he carefully stirred the mixture inside the container.The mushroom slowly melted in the pot in a weird way. The stink was constrained within the magic circle.When the black thick liquid in the pot started to bubble, Lucien calmly added the Revenant dust and the dust of the rose.As soon as the three materials met each other, a thick black and silver smoke came out. There seemed to be lots of revenants fighting with each other. A sharp scream came into Lucien\u2019s ears and the sharpness made him feel a bit nauseous.Lucien knew that he could not slack at the crucial moment. Being controlled by his spiritual power, the flame turned white.The black and silver smoke began to merge with each other and became pale, like the skin of a dead body.As time passed by, the smoke turned into water drops and stayed within the pot. Seizing the moment, Lucien added the brain tissue into the liquid.The water drops in the container quickly soaked the black brain tissue, and within one second, the brain disappeared.The whole magic lab suddenly became cold and dark. Even the flame in the magic circle looked a bit green.Suddenly being attacked by the infrasonic waves, Lucien retreated several steps and almost passed out. His guts were stirring inside of his body and his head was buzzing.Lucien never expected this. Nothing like this was mentioned in the witch\u2019s notes.He started to cast the spell Silence Wall. Transparent walls showed up around Lucien to protect him from the attack of the sound waves.Several seconds later, Lucien cast Illumination.A bright light ball appeared in the air. In the light, Lucien saw lots of pale human faces in the container!These transparent faces were rather blurry, but their viciousness and perniciousness was overwhelming. They were struggling in the magic circle, trying to get into Lucien\u2019s body.In the strong light, the faces gradually disappeared. When everything returned to normal, Lucien saw a small amount of black liquid remaining in the pot with a strong burnt smell.\u201cThe recipe should be correct. But the witch might have left out some annotations that she did not translate. Possibly it was because the brain tissue was from a mutant aquatic zombie. That almost killed me.\u201d Taking off the gloves, Lucien wiped the sweat on his forehead, \u201cI gotta find a chance to learn the language of the ancient magic empire.\u201dCrying Soul was one of the greatest achievements of the ancient Sylvanas Magic Empire. According to the witch\u2019s notes, only a few sorcerers had the recipe, and the making of the potion required an accurate amount of different materials and reagents. Even a tiny mistake would lead to failure.Luckily, this mutant aquatic zombie\u2019s brain had only a little more soul power than common ones. This time Lucien decided to use the best Corpse Mushroom he had. Following the same procedures, Lucien came to the last step smoothly.When Lucien threw another piece of aquatic zombie\u2019s brain into the pot, the sharp and bitter scream came out again. However, this time the noise was totally blocked by the transparent walls. Then he calmly added a small amount of other reagents.The white flame suddenly soared and fully covered the whole pot. Then, the now big flame quickly disappeared in the next second.Some black, bubbling liquid remained in the pot. Inside each of the bubbles, there was a horrifying and vicious face, crying and screaming.That was why the potion was called Crying Soul.Using Mage Hand, Lucien poured the black liquid into a glass tube.Observing carefully, Lucien was sure that the potion was made correctly. Lucien bit his lips for a moment and directly drank all the dark liquid in one draught.He did not have enough time to test the features of the potion. He needed to take the risk.The taste of the potion was actually not that horrible, but the texture was pretty weird.Soon Lucien felt a great pain in his body, as if the potion was tearing up his body into pieces.Lucien heard lots of crying, but he did not know if they were real.He crouched in great pain and then lay down, rolling back and forth on the ground. Lucien grabbed a piece of cloth and stuffed it into his mouth, in case he felt the need to scream.Although Lucien thought he was stronger than common people because of his exercising routine, now, when facing the pain, he became very uncertain whether he could really awaken the potential in his body.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis blood was burning and his veins were swelling. Lucien felt his body was about to explode. His skin was covered by thick blue and green veins, which looked very horrible.Blood came out of Lucien\u2019s body like red vapor, and then it went back into his body. In his blurry awareness, Lucien felt a cold and dark power was gradually taking over him. At that time, a bright light suddenly burst out of the projection of Lucien\u2019s Host Star in his soul, and quickly linked to the real Host Star in the starry sky, which unrolled in front of Lucien\u2019s eyes. The star power started to infuse into Lucien\u2019s veins, fighting against the pain and trying hard to drive away the power of darkness.Lucien was hoping that the power of star could win inside his body. He did not want to be dominated by a more vicious power, which might also bring him trouble and danger in the future.Unfortunately, the power of death from the crying souls was still stronger. When Lucien was almost dead from the conflict of the two powers, his blood flow started to slow down.After all, Lucien\u2019s Blessing was awakened by the mysterious potion, not on his own.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Within only a few seconds, the new power overthrew the dark power and dominated the body.Lucien\u2019s Blessing had finally awakened, and his power was related to the silver moon.His heartbeat gradually slowed down, calm as usual, although his body still felt limp and numb.Nothing like this was ever mentioned in the witch\u2019s notes or in the books that Lucien read before. He had no idea why the environment could affect his way of awakening the Blessing.Outside of the shack, the other foot also took a step forward, leaving the shadows. On the feet there was a pair of black leather shoes. Then the leather shoes went back into the darkness and disappeared. The silver moon dimmed.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Lucien stood up from the ground, feeling the power in his body.His hands became way stronger, and now could easily break a person\u2019s neck. However, compared with the obvious increase of strength, Lucien could tell that the major benefit of his Blessing was the great improvement to his agility, speed and coordination.Lifting one foot, Lucien started to ran in the lab. Although he was fast like a shadow, Lucien did not run down anything in that small place.\u201cMy speed and my agility can almost compete with the level two knight with the \u2018Shadow\u2019 Blessing that I met before, even though my power was awakened by the potion. Thus, if a level one knight has the same Blessing I have, I\u2019m sure that he would be even more capable in terms of agility when compared with a level two knight whose Blessing is different.\u201d Lucien stopped to evaluate his power, \u201cHowever, regarding constitution and strength, a common level one knight can easily defeat me.\u201dLucien calmed himself down to carefully feel the power, and started to try the different aspects.\u201cDark Vision. I can see about two hundred meters away at night.\u201d A silver light appeared in his black eyes.\u201cMy body can be dematerialized into moonlight to protect myself, but right now I cannot do this completely, so the protection is relatively limited, for now.\u201d Lucien\u2019s hands gradually became transparent, \u201cOnly level seven radiant knights can do this dematerialization completely.\u201dHowever, for now Lucien was already immune to the attack of common weapons such as swords and arrows, and could better stand the damage caused by magic weapons, divine power weapons and shockwaves, elemental damage caused by fire and acid, as well as necromantic power. Although currently the protection of Moonlight seemed to be inferior than the night watcher\u2019s Dragon Scale from the Blessing of the Red Dragon, Lucien was still pretty satisfied with his own Blessing.Then Lucien cut himself with the silver dagger on his hand. The wound bled a bit and quickly recovered.\u201cTo some extent\u2026 self-healing\u201d Lucien recorded.Unfortunately, Lucien\u2019s Blessing couldn\u2019t be really used for launching attacks. Moonlight was not a dark Blessing.The church had compiled a book about the knowledge of the most common Blessings in order to help the new knights to improve themselves faster and also for other uses. Lucien read the book in the association\u2019s library before, and he also heard John mentioning to him about his most yearning Blessings, which helped him a lot to know about his Moonlight Blessing.According to The Handbook of Blessing, the power of Moonlight could be further improved in general when the silver moon was present. However, at the same time, it would be weakened under the midday sun, but not as badly as the dark Blessings, such as Darkness, Silver Moon, Vampire, etc.Lucien finally smiled for the first time in the last days. In general, Moonlight was an ideal Blessing for him.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026When Lucien was casting the spell to preserve the experiment materials, he surprisedly found that his spiritual power had been improved a lot as well.Now Lucien was only one step away from becoming a senior apprentice, and he could cast nineteen apprentice spells successively before his spiritual power was drained.The improvement was such a bonus for Lucien, but soon he calmed down. Putting all the stuff into boxes, Lucien was planning to secretly move them away to the house when there was a chance.The corner of the lab was piled with many grey stones, which were previously dirt from when Lucien was digging the basement. Some of the stones had been thrown away, but Lucien purposefully left many stones there as well. When he was digging, with an easy spell Lucien turned the dirt into stones and now it was time for the stones to come in handy again.Lucien arranged the stones to make sure that they were in the correct position. When the chance was appropriate. Lucien would come back and easily fill the basement with dirt again adversely using the same spell. Although more dirt was definitely needed to fully fill the place and make it even with the ground level, it would not be too difficult for Lucien since now he was almost as powerful as a knight.After Lucien finished doing all of these, he walked to the wall and activated a small magic circle on it. Part of the stone wall gradually turned into dirt and then he started to dig.Ten minutes later, the passage he was digging directly connected to an old one\u2014the passage which was built by the witch to the sewers!As early as when Lucien was building his magic lab, he knew that a second secret exit was definitely necessary. And the easiest way of doing this was to link his secret passage to the one of the witch, since the deeper part of the witch\u2019s secret passage was still intact.Briefly concealing the new passage that he just dug, Lucien ran into the sewer as fast as he could with his Moonlight Blessing. His figure disappeared in the darkness like a shadow.Within Lucien\u2019s expectation, the church\u2019s security already decreased, as two to three months had passed since the last time the heresy was performed down here. Therefore, it did not take Lucien long to come back to the ground through the sewers, safe and sound.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLucien could see very well in the night with his Dark Vision.Instead of finding the kidnappers who were monitoring him in the area, Lucien first came to the old wall close to auntie Alisa\u2019s place, and wrote down a series of simple patterns, which meant:\u201cI read about a magic relic named Emden in an ancient literature, which sat in the southeast of Melzer Black Forest. Owl, please find me a guide who knows the place among the apprentices in Aalto.\u201cMake sure that Philosopher, White Honey and yourself are safe.\u201cProfessor\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lucien even directly wrote down the word \u201cEmden\u201d, since he had no idea how to express it in the secret code.Then, using the Moonlight Blessing, Lucien left the area and carefully approached his shack. Hiding in the darkness, he intently sensed the supernatural power inside his house.The night watchers had left. In the moonlight, Lucien could directly see the \u201ceyes\u201d which were monitoring him the whole night. The pair of eyes floating in the air were almost transparent, staring at the pile of messy blankets in the bed. However, the eyes did not have pupils!While common people would be really scared by the horrible scene, Lucien felt quite lucky. Fortunately, this pair of eyes could not sense the heat, or he would have been found out already.In the darkness, Lucien waited patiently. Half an hour later, the transparent eyes gradually disappeared. A new cycle should start soon.Lucien stayed highly focused. Within his expectations, a moment later, a sudden wave of supernatural power was detected coming from a certain direction. That was where the heretic was hiding!Lucien grabbed a small stone in his hand and quickly threw it against the wall in the opposite direction. The sound of the stone hitting the wall and falling on the ground was especially clear in the late night. As if the kidnapper was startled, the pair of eyes being formed suddenly rippled and soon disappeared.Seizing the chance, Lucien started to move as fast as he could with the help of Moonlight. He was fast like a shadow. His movement was so agile that his blurry figure instantly integrated into the silver moonlight. No one could notice him unless they observed carefully.Lucien pushed one of the windows open, quickly jumped into his shack, closed the window and tucked himself in his bed. Lucien clearly knew that it would take the heretic some time to recover from the power backfire of the failed casting he or she just did, thus he unhurriedly covered himself with the blanket and made sure the shape of the blanket was not of a big difference.More than a minute later, the eyes rose in the air again with caution.In the next ten minutes, pretending that he was still sleeping, Lucien purposefully turned his face towards the eyes and kicked away the blanket to let the eyes see him directly.Luckily, Lucien successfully awoke his Blessing tonight, or his night would be way tougher than this.Everything went on smoothly. After all, anything could have caused the little noise from the stone, such as a wild cat, or a crow.Slowly, Lucien felt asleep, knowing that he had more work to do tomorrow.\u2026\u2026After having breakfast, Lucien arrived at the Musicians\u2019 Association.Knocking the door of the office which was in charge of musicians\u2019 accommodation, Lucien was putting on a play in front of the heretics who were still monitoring somewhere.A middle-aged woman opened the door and asked, \u201cMr. Evans? What can I do for you?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019m looking for Brian,\u201d answered Lucien, and he saw Brian was coming over.\u201cAnything wrong with the house?\u201d asked Brian a bit nervously.\u201cThe place is fine. Just the sheet and the blanket in the bedroom are too soggy. Can you find someone to dry them for me and make sure the cleaning of the whole house will be done by next Monday?\u201d\u201cFor sure, Mr. Evans.\u201d Brian was relieved, and a smile appeared on his face, \u201cBy next Monday, everything will be ready for you to move in.\u201dLater Lucien came back to his own office. Today he was definitely in a better mood, knowing that he was finally capable of saving uncle Joel and his families when time was proper.In order to hide his excitement, Lucien started to practice. With the awakened Blessing, his coordination had improved a lot. Along with his great memory, Lucien could master a piece of music way faster than ever, and of course, faster than many other people.After several rounds of practicing, Lucien had mastered Symphony of Fate and other several pieces of etude pretty well like a well-qualified instrumentalist.\u201cNo wonder Rhine said that the combination of Blessing and good memory can easily produce a qualified pianist. That does make sense.\u201d Lucien wondered to himself.Actually, it was not too hard for a knight to learn how to use a musical instrument. However, mastering a musical instrument and becoming a great musician was a totally different story.After giving the Moonlight Rose to Lucien, Felicia started to ask Lucien many questions about music all the time. This morning she visited his office and asked for Lucien\u2019s suggestion about her composition. Since she regarded this as an agreement between them, Felicia did not want to waste any time.In fact, Lucien\u2019s understanding in music was no better than Felicia\u2019s. He had no choice but to search for the masterpieces from his original world in his spirit library in order to provide feedback by adding pieces of those great music works to Felicia\u2019s composition. However, that already impressed Felicia a lot. She was very inspired by Lucien\u2019s feedback.\u201cYour talent is astonishing.\u201d Felicia\u2019s red eyes were shining like rubies, \u201cYour playing skills progressed a lot as well.\u201dLucien just smiled politely.\u2026\u2026After lunch, Lucien brought some of his stuff from the shack to Gesu district.The blankets and sheets were hanging up in the backyard, bathing in the sunlight. Lucien felt a bit nervous, having no idea what the kidnappers would say about he leaving the letter here last night.Opening the letter slowly, Lucien held his breath. A new sentence was on the letter.\u201cBring the letter with you, Mr. Evans.\u201dLucien pretended he was confused, behaving like an ordinary person who had no idea how useful the letter actually was.\u201cI accidentally left the letter here last night. I\u2019ll be living in Aderon this week since the house is not ready yet.\u201d Lucien said to the letter.A while later, the letter replied:\u201cThen bring the letter back with you. So we can communicate easier.\u201d\u201cI will, but I want another Scene ball,\u201d requested Lucien.\u201cSure,\u201d replied the letter immediately.\u2026\u2026On his way back home, with his sharper vision, Lucien saw that the marks that he left on the wall last night had been replaced by new marks:\u201cProfessor, we are fine. Fire Wolf volunteered to be your guide for Emden Relic. Where should he meet you?\u201cOwl\u201dLucien kept walking without stopping his footsteps.There was no magic relic named Emden. Lucien made it up.During midnight, the heretics started to be less alert. With Moonlight, Lucien avoided their monitoring again and came to the mark wall.He left a new line of marks on it.\u201cEleven, Friday night. East entrance of Larnaca Canyon, Melzer Black Forest. Professor.\u201d\u2026\u2026On thursday morning, Lucien found the second Scene ball in front of his shack before leaving for the association.The same wood cabin, the same wood table. Joel\u2019s face was emotionless, while Elisa was wiping tears silently, and Iven looked scared. Silver moon could be seen through the window, and several stars were shining in the background.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLucien saw fresh dirt on their shoes. Suddenly he realized something.Maybe the wood cabin was just the place for making Scene balls. The real place that they were taken captive should be somewhere else. According to the freshness of the dirt, the actual place should not be too far away from that cabin.\u2026\u2026In the princess\u2019s practicing room, when Lucien was playing the piano loudly, he suddenly said to Natasha:\u201cYour Grace, I need to confess.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Her legs were long and straight.\u201cConfess?\u201d She looked a bit confused but soon became serious, \u201cConfess what, Lucien?\u201dNatasha was very different than usual. Now she was like a leopard ready to launch an attack.Lucien did not answer the princess instantly, instead, he turned around and looked at lady Camil silently.Natasha was very smart. She understood what Lucien was worrying, especially seeing that Lucien was still playing the piano, \u201cI trust lady Camil with my life, Lucien, so there\u2019s no need to ask her to leave. And in Ratacia, no one can spy on us.\u201d\u201cYour Grace, we can never be too careful.\u201d Camil stood up and her blue eyes started to shine brightly. Her whole body gradually became transparent and turned into a statue made of seawater.Then the seawater from the statue overflowed onto the floor, and soon reached to Lucien\u2019s ankles. A moment later, the whole practicing room was half filled with seawater, and the water level already reached to Lucien\u2019s chest. Seeing Lucien\u2019s confused eyes, Natasha nodded to him.Soon the room was fully filled with the water. Lucien came to the bottom of the sea.However, the practicing room was like a big water cube, and the water was not leaking anywhere else at all. Besides, Lucien could breathe easily as usual. The only difference was that Lucien\u2019s skin was covered with a thin layer of silver light.\u201cBlessing?\u201d Natasha lifted her eyebrows, and soon apologized sincerely, \u201cSorry\u2026 I did not know Lady Camil would examine you.\u201d\u201cI totally understand. That\u2019s what lady Camil should do. You don\u2019t need to apologize at all.\u201d Lucien was ready for the examination, and that was one of the many reasons that Lucien did not tell the princess what happened to him the first time he came to Ratacia Palace. Now his Blessing had been awakened, and his spiritual power from practicing magic could thus be hidden.Lucien understood that, if he faced the heretics by himself, he would absolutely not be enough. Currently, the best choice was to report to the princess and refer to the noble power. And the key point was that he needed to figure out a proper chance to make sure his plan would not threaten the hostages and his own safety.Now it was the proper chance.Looking at the silver light covering Lucien\u2019s skin, Natasha rested her chin in the left hand and said, \u201cMoonlight Blessing, but weaker than a knight\u2019s Blessing\u2026 Well, Lucien, now you can tell me what happened. The whole room has been isolated by Camil\u2019s power.\u201d\u201cAs you can see, Your Grace, my Blessing is weaker. That\u2019s because my Blessing was awakened by a bottle of magic potion given by someone else.\u201d Lucien was well-prepared for what he was going to say, \u201cSince the night when I got invited to be your consultant, I was involved in a conspiracy aiming at you and the grand duke.\u201d\u201cI see. That\u2019s what you get from working with them, a potion to awaken Blessing,\u201d The corner of Natasha\u2019s lips curled up.\u201cThat is not true, Your Grace.\u201d Lucien mixed the truth and his lie together, \u201cThey kidnapped uncle Joel and his family. They offered me a lot of help in the past when I was struggling. The kidnappers wanted me to report your schedule to them, as well as things that I hear in the palace. They want me to have my Blessing awakened in order to work better for them.\u201d\u201cCamil?\u201d Natasha was a bit surprised, \u201cAll the people who work for me\u2026 they got carefully investigated first, right?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Grace. Mr. Evans\u2019s music talent is beyond doubt. Although he got involved with a witch\u2019s case, there is no evidence showing that Mr. Evans, or any of his friends, was suspicious.\u201d Camil stopped examining Lucien and said to the princess. Her voice came from different directions under the water.As the future grand duke, the security measures around Natasha were very strict.Natasha nodded, \u201cDo you know anything about Mr. Joel and his family?\u201d\u201cOur intelligence department reported that Mr. Joel and his family were invited by a noble lord.\u201d Camil sounded a bit angry.\u201cAlthough the security measures in the palace are very strict,\u201d said Lucien, \u201cwhen I was acting nervous in front of you the last time, the kidnappers warned me about it in the evening of that day. So I suspect that there might be spies around you, Your Grace.\u201d\u201cSo you were doing that on purpose. Lucien, I really did underestimate you.\u201d Natasha looked quite serious but then smiled, slightly shaking her head.Then Natasha stood up from the bench and walked around in the room filled with water, \u201cThe intelligence department is untrustworthy right now. Auntie Camil, please go to the church and tell this to the two cardinals, Amelton and Gossett.\u201dEnjoying his isolated life, now Cardinal Sard was not actively involved with the church. Two younger cardinals, Amelton and Gossett, were currently in charge.Then Lucien told Natasha more details, such as how he bought Moonlight Rose from Felicia. And of course, he mentioned nothing about how he figured out those people were from Argent Horn and how he investigated them.\u201cSomeone must be trailing you all the time recently,\u201d Natasha said to Lucien, \u201cAuntie Camil, catch the guy and put the guy to torture.\u201dLucien hurriedly stopped her, \u201cYour Grace, we don\u2019t need to hurry. Instead, we should be patient. We shall start from secretly investigating the intelligence department and the kidnappers, following the clues and finally figuring out the big man who is hiding behind.\u201dLucien must make sure uncle Joel and his family were safe. And he also wanted to solve the issue of the heresy once and for all, or he would be facing lots of trouble in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s not that complicated.\u201d Natasha frowned her eyebrows, \u201cWe catch the person who\u2019s trailing you, beat the person until he or she tells the truth, and then we quickly take action to take the bastards down. Come on! You\u2019re a man, Lucien!\u201d\u201cYour Grace, I think Mr. Evans is right. If our intelligence department is involved, this whole thing would be much more complicated. We should be more careful,\u201d commented Camil.\u201cAll right\u2026 I think you and Lucien are right. I won\u2019t tell this to anyone else.\u201d Natasha curled her lips, \u201cI never like complicated things. How dare the bastards come to my palace!\u201d\u201cEvery once in a while, the kidnappers send me a small magic ball. I can see uncle Joel and his family through the ball. If I find any clue from the balls, how can I tell you?\u201d Lucien kept pushing forward, but started to feel quite nervous. Princess Natasha was much more straightforward than he thought.\u201cI\u2019ll give you several drops of my blood, which contain the elemental power of water,\u201d said Camil, 'so keep them with you. When you need to contact us, put a drop of blood into water and you can temporarily talk to me. Unless they have someone who\u2019s as powerful as a level seven knight, and unless it is that person who\u2019s trailing you, the blood will be impossible for them to spot.\u201dThree small sapphires appeared in front of Lucien, floating in the water.After agreeing on the secret code for communication, Lucien put the sapphires into his pocket. While Natasha sat down in a couch and asked Lucien with interest,\u201cThese people are using lives to threaten you, power and possible fortune to lure you, then why you decided to tell us, Lucien?\u201d\u201cI did feel hesitant,\u201d Lucien paused a bit, \u201cbut I never trust that kidnappers would keep their word. Only referring to your help, Your Grace, I could save uncle Joel and his family. I never make a concession to my enemy, and that is my creed.\u201d\u201cNever make a concession to the enemy? Interesting.\u201d Natasha\u2019s purple eyes lit up, \u201cNo wonder you can compose Symphony of Fate, such a great work. I apologize for what I just said. You\u2019re a real man, Lucien.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Grace.\u201d Lucien slightly bowed.\u201cWell, well\u2026 real man Lucien. You really don\u2019t need me to teach you how to pursue girls?\u201d Natasha laughed, \u201cOur personalities are quite similar. You can be pretty attractive to girls, just like me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Sorry Your Grace. I\u2019m really not in the mood.\u201d answered Lucien seriously, \u201cAnd by the way, please don\u2019t tell the church that my Blessing has been awakened, after all, the way I did it was not proper in the church\u2019s eyes.\u201dNatasha nodded, \u201cI understand, Lucien, and I won\u2019t. Luckily, Moonlight is not a dark Blessing. After we solve this problem, I\u2019ll tell the church that the potion you had was given by me, as your reward.\u201dThat was really a surprise for Lucien.Then Natasha shrugged her shoulders, \u201cRelax, Lucien. So you can better fight against your enemy.\u201dThe level of the seawater was gradually falling and finally disappeared. Lady Camil showed up again in the practicing room, and Natasha and Lucien were sitting in front of the piano, talking about music as if nothing special ever happened.Later, when Lucien came back home, the letter urgently asked him what he saw today in the palace and what the princess told him. The kidnappers had no idea about Lucien\u2019s earlier confession.Telling the kidnappers that John would be back this Saturday morning, Lucien used this as an excuse to request another Scene ball on Friday evening.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe heretics agreed.\u2026\u2026On the second day, Friday.After class, Felicia\u2019s coach was waiting in front of the place. To prepare the ball, Felicia asked for a leave of the class today.Of course, Lucien was asked to bring the letter with him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019re not interested in Berne, the wine exclusively produced by Hayne family\u2019s chateau?\u201d Noticing Lucien\u2019s silence, Rhine smiled to him and asked.The wine named Berne was very famous in Aalto. The especial grapes produced in the manor\u2019s field were of great quality. Only guests who were invited to the manor could have a chance to taste it.\u201cI\u2019m fine, Mr. Rhine. Actually\u2026 I\u2019m feeling a bit concerned, since I know nothing about dancing. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s quite embarrassing.\u201d Lucien found an excuse to disguise the load on his mind.\u201cI can teach you, although you\u2019re not a lady,\u201d Rhine joked, \u201cYou can take me as your beautiful lady.\u201dLucien put an awkward smile on his face.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to worry about, Lucien,\u201d Victor comforted him. \u201cWe all know about your background. No one will purposefully invite you to dance to humiliate you. But if you want to learn how to dance, I\u2019m sure many of the beautiful ladies there will be willing to teach you.\u201dLucien gradually relaxed in this happy atmosphere, knowing that nervousness could not help his plan tonight at all.The coach soon ran out of town and passed Belem River, heading for the manor sitting in the north of Melzer Black Forest.Hayne\u2019s family\u2019s manor was magnificent. Built with fine granite, everything in the manor looked luxury.Wearing a flame-red evening dress, Felicia was already waiting in front of the lobby, followed by two rows of servants standing behind her. The yellow flame of the six bronze torch holders lit up the evening at seven o\u2019clock.\u201cGood Evening, Mr. Victor and Mr. Rhine. Good evening, Lucien and Lott,\u201d Felicia welcomed them. Tonight she was the host, and her parents did not come.Every noble lady must be able to host a ball or a party on her own.\u201cYou look gorgeous tonight, Felicia.\u201d Victor hugged Felicia a bit and smiled.Dressing in red, Felicia\u2019s red eyes and fair skin looked even more beautiful.Felicia thanked her teacher in a noble lady manner, and then she turned to welcome the other many guests. Not only Felicia\u2019s classmates were present, but also many of her noble friends.Following Victor and Rhine, Lucien entered the lobby, which could accommodate more than a hundred people.The long dining table was sitting in the corner of the lobby. There were wine, assorted salads and pies, sausages, beef, chicken, duck, fine bread, fruits and many good-looking desserts that Lucien could not even name.The invited band was playing a nice song, making this evening rather tasteful.Lucien picked up a plate on the dining table and loaded it with lots of food. Eating quietly in the corner, he was waiting for Felicia to announce the beginning of the ball.\u201cThank you all for coming tonight. That\u2019s my great pleasure and the great pleasure of our Hayne family!\u201d Felicia said to all the guests in a decent manner, \u201cNow, let\u2019s dance and enjoy the night!\u201dAs she was talking, the lobby dimmed a bit and the band changed the song.The gentlemen walked towards the young ladies and they started to dance in a manner called Whirling from the palace of Tria. While Whirling was very popular among young nobles, the conservative elder nobles were denouncing it as \u201cvery improper\u201dand \u201cimmoral\u201d because of the intimacy in Whirling.\u201cLucien, are you still eating? This is a ball!\u201d After her opening dance with Mr. Victor, Felicia finally found Lucien in the corner beside the dining table.Putting down the plate, Lucien shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to whirl, Felicia.\u201dLucien always felt rather hungry after awakening the Blessing. In addition to that, a tough task was waiting for him tonight.\u201cI can teach you, Lucien,\u201d Felicia said to him sincerely, \u201cDancing, along with appreciating music and hunting, is very important in social life. If you want to get along with the nobles, you have to know how to dance.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019m not made for this.\u201d Lucien was a bit nervous, and he did not want to act weirdly at the ball. He awkwardly reached out his hand to invite Felicia for a dance.\u201cYou\u2019re doing good.\u201d Felicia put her hand in Lucien\u2019s, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. First time can never be perfect.\u201dSlightly putting one of his hands on Felicia\u2019s waist and the other on her shoulder, Lucien started to dance following her instruction, and he was mindfully keeping a distance from Felicia\u2019s body.Several minutes later, Felicia looked at Lucien with surprise, \u201cYou can dance very well\u2026 except you\u2019re a bit stiff. Is this your first time practicing Whirling?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026 not really.\u201d Lucien couldn\u2019t tell her about his Blessing and quickly found an excuse, \u201cThe princess taught me a bit before.\u201d\u201cNo wonder. After all, the princess is a grand knight, and she must be a good dance teacher, too.\u201d Felicia nodded, and then she suddenly giggled, \u201cHer Grace is half-head taller than you, and she is a great knight. When you were dancing with her, you probably look more like a lady.\u201dFelicia definitely heard some gossip about the princess. After all, Natasha never hid herself in front of people.Lucien was a bit speechless. Then an idea flashed into his mind.Suddenly Lucien lost his balance and slipped on the floor. He gasped in pain.\u201cAre you all right?\u201d asked Felicia with concern, \u201cYou need a doctor?\u201d\u201cMy ankle hurts. Can you just have someone to lead me to a guest room? I just need a rest.\u201d Lucien shook his head.Felicia nodded and asked a servant to walk Lucien to the guest room on the third floor.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The guest room was clean and nice, and the blanket on the bed was light and soft.Sitting on the bed on his own, Lucien took out the letter and wrote several words down on it:\u201cI need the ball.\u201dIt was close to eight at night, and it was dark outside.More than ten minutes later, the heretics replied, \u201cOpen the window.\u201dAs Lucien opened the window, the lively music playing downstairs immediately drifted up to him. Together with the music, a small black ball was thrown into the room.Lucien agilely caught the ball.This time, instead of crumbling the ball, Lucien took a peek at the inside of the ball. Through the heavy smoke in it, he saw the same cabin.Luckily, the kidnappers did not move.Putting the ball back into his pocket, Lucien responded through the letter, \u201cI\u2019ll calm John down tomorrow morning when I meet him.\u201d\u201cYour cooperation is appreciated,\u201d answered the letter coldly.Lucien folded the letter, put it back into the pocket of his black suit, and hung his suit on the rack.In the following hour, a few people came to visit Lucien, including Victor, Rhine, and even some young nobles that Lucien did not know. Yvette looked a bit disappointed when she visited Lucien since obviously the injured young man could not do anything that night.After nine thirty, the guest room finally quieted down. Lucien locked the door from inside, blew out the candles and lied in the darkness.A while later, he finally stood up and poured himself a cup of water. At the same time, he secretly dropped one sapphire given by Camil into the water.\u201cYou found anything, Lucien?\u201d Camil\u2019s voice directly sounded in his mind.Lucien answered to Camil silently in his mind, \u201cSoutheast of Melzer Black Forest, close to Lubeck Mountain.\u201d Then, pretending that it was an accident, he dropped the cup on the ground.The direction was very inaccurate, and it was far away from where the cabin was located. Even if Camil was going to search the whole area, she would not be able to find the cabin.Lucien swore a bit and went back to the bed. He stuffed the other two sapphires under the pillow and covered himself with the big and soft blanket.The ball was still going on, and the noise of the party made the night feel even quieter.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSome random dogs were barking afar.The silver moon was up, and the moonlight sneaked into the room. In the moonlight, the blanket covering Lucien slightly twisted a bit.Lucien escaped again from the window that was left open by him purposefully.With his sharp vision, Lucien saw a black figure hiding behind a big tree not far away from the manor. Taking the opposite direction, Lucien climbed over the wall of the manor and ran into the forest behind it.In the forest, he put on the black sorcerer robe that he prepared in advance and then ran toward Larnaca Canyon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although the manor was quite far from Larnaca Canyon, twenty minutes later, he could already see the shining Massol River, which was very close to the canyon, reflecting the moonlight in front of him.Lucien slowed down a bit to be more cautious. He saw several campfires blazing in the distance, which were probably lit by adventurers.\u2026The river bed was covered with countless pebbles. The river named Massol kept running eastwards and in the end joined Belem River.Wearing a black hood, Fire Wolf stepped out of the trees\u2019 shadow very cautiously. There was an unfeathered, bright red-skinned bird standing on his shoulder. Tonight, the night watchers were making an ambush in a distance and the leader of the night watchers, Clown, was waiting for his signal.Fire Wolf betrayed the apprentices group for a reason: a magic potion called Magic Gate would be given to him from the Church after successfully arresting Professor. The potion could help him become a real sorcerer and then he would be allowed to join the Night Watch. At that time, there would be no need for him to hide as a spy and a betrayer anymore.Grabbing the bracelet in his pocket nervously, Fire Wolf was trying his best to stay focused, in order to sense if anyone was approaching. The bracelet called Fire Weaver was a level three magic item given by the Church to help protect himself when facing Professor.Although Clown promised to him that they would arrive within thirty seconds after they saw his signal, Fire Wolf\u2019s heart was still beating very fast. No one knew what was going to happen within the thirty seconds.It was already ten forty. Fire Wolf heard wolves howling deep in the woods. Hearrived at the the entrance to the canyon but did not see Professor.Turning around, he saw something shining on a big rock. It was a message left by Professor.\u201cMeet you in the Black Forest, close to the south entrance to the canyon.\u201dFire Wolf was not really surprised that Professor changed the meeting place all of a sudden. After all, it was a quite common way to avoid being tailed after.After the weird-looking bird, Fire Feather, made several chirps as a signal for the night watchers, Fire Wolf headed into the deeper woods.This time it took him more than ten minutes to arrive at the designated place. It was very dark around since the moonlight was completely shaded by the tall and thick cedars.Fire Wolf heard several savage howls in a distance, sounding rather thrilling. However, it was a relief for him since the howls were made by the night watchers.They had followed Fire Wolf here and then the team scattered to check the surroundings.Half an hour later, Professor still did not show up. Fire Wolf started to feel irritated, pacing back and forth and wondering if Professor had somehow found out that it was s trap.The night watchers also lost their patience. Clown sent the message to the other night watchers using a secret method:\u201cSearch this area, in a five-hundred-meter radius around the south entrance.\u201dThe night watchers around started to move instantly.Soon Minsk, one of the night watchers, found a wood cabin in the forest.\u2026In the forest on the other side of the cabin, one of the night watchers had become a dead body with the fear still lingering on his face, and part of his brains were visible.A slender man wearing a long black jacket was standing beside the dead body. The silver horn pattern on his jacket was rather noticeable. His right hand was covered with the night watcher\u2019s white brain tissue, and the man was sucking his fingers to enjoy the taste, as if he was tasting the sweetest candy.A crystal ball on the man\u2019s left hand suddenly emitted a rather old voice, \u201cKill them all, Dragan. The temple knights will help you. Do not let them find our relic.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201d The man finished licking his fingers, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m quite sure these poor guys\u2019 target is not us, I enjoy killing\u2026 and brains.\u201dHis black jacket billowed out in the wind and within a second he disappeared in the darkness.\u2026Tonight, the two Night Watcher teams were composed of a total of thirty members. Among them there were pastors, knights and even four grand knights as the team leaders. Close to half of the night watchers of the inquisition were sent in order to capture the mysterious Professor alive.However, the dark forest unexpectedly turned into a hell to them tonight. They forfeited their lives here without even knowing who was their real enemy.The smell of blood spread through the forest.Clown was trying to contact the other night watchers. Suddenly, he sensed the threat from behind and immediately rolled forward.A black ball fiercely struck the place where Clown was just standing. After that moment, the stones, grass and trees in the area disappeared completely, like water completely vaporized within a second.Clown remained calm. His fingers started to move in a weird way like he was playing piano. Translucent lines grew out from his fingers and quickly shot out into the woods, pulling someone out.It was Gragan.\u201cPuppet Blessing. Interesting.\u201d Dragan\u2019s body gradually melted within the darkness and escaped from the fine lines, \u201cIs it how you utilize your dark Blessing? Ummm\u2026 I see\u2026 you became the hound of the inquisition.\u201d Dragan\u2019s voice was rather cold.\u201cPuppet is no dark Blessing. It\u2019s a special gift from the God of Truth, not like your filthy dark power, Dragan!\u201d Clown recognized him and called his name.Clown lifted his arms again and this time the fine lines became much stronger. When the lines captured Dragan again, at the same time, Clown shot off the magic firework as a signal asking for help from the church.However, before the firework was fully spread in the sky, a sudden strong black wave directly struck it. The firework signal was instantly devoured by the wave and disappeared in the sky.Dark Devourer, a level six fiend spell, which was how the Church called the power that did not come from the God of Truth. The person who just cast this spell was of cardinal level!\u2026In the underground relic, five high priests wearing silver robes were looking up at the two great priests standing on the altar respectfully.\u201cIt\u2019s time to show your loyalty to our true God. Lead the other priests to devastate our enemies outside, the hounds of the so-called God of Truth.\u201d The bald old man on the altar commanded.\u201cBe quick.\u201d The other great priest added, coldly, \u201cAlthough I stopped the signal, we shall still finish them as soon as possible before the heretics outside can ask for help again.\u201d\u201cYour will is God\u2019s will, great priests,\u201d answered the five high priests at the same time.\u2026The night watchers were very experienced fighters, and they did not earn their name undeservedly. When they realized that their enemies tonight were actually the heretics, they started to fight back.A night watcher was holding a thick canon of scripture in his hand. This man was called Canon Holder, and he was the leader of the other Night Watcher team tonight.Canon Holder\u2019s steps were firm and steady. As he flipped the pages of the canon, a huge flame ball came right down from the sky and instantly vaporized a dark knight in front of him.Level four divine spell, Flame Strike.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWithout any interval, this night watcher flipped the pages again and summoned a flame wall and protected his team members, who were facing another dark knight.Canon Holder was a level five bishop, who voluntarily gave up his life under the sunlight and joined the Night Watch to fight for his true God.Lucien was sitting on a big tree quite a distance away, looking at the explosions on the ground expressionlessly as if he was appreciating nice fireworks.He saw that the rest of the night watchers were approaching the wood cabin; he saw that the night watcher Minsk survived for now with his defense called Dragon Scale from his Red Dragon Blessing; and he saw that there were only eighteen night watchers left out of thirty.However, Lucien was still waiting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lucien was sitting on the cedar waiting for the end of the fight between the Church and Argent Horn.When he saw the black wave which devoured the night watcher\u2019s signal, Lucien calculated the angle and the distance and thus located where Argent Horn was actually hiding.\u201cAbout ninety meters northwest of the wood cabin,\u201d Lucien murmured in a low voice.At the same time, Lucien looked at another direction and wondered in his mind, \u201cShe should have noticed the chaos already.\u201dAs the heretics and the night watchers started to gather together, Lucien felt it was finally time for him to take action.\u2026Flame Strike, Angel Summoning, Healing\u2026 Canon Holder kept casting spells without interval. As a level five bishop, he was able to both devastate his enemies and save his comrades. His spells destroyed many magic circles and traps placed by Argent Horn, and thus the two great priests in the underground palace lost their control on the ground.As six out of the eighteen night watchers were pastors, they were able to heal their injured comrades over and over again. Under the command of the two team leaders, the gathered night watchers kept moving forward and the situation started to turn around and became more favorable to the Church.However, at this time, a dark cloud arrived, and the cloud was somehow squeaking.\u201cBugs!\u201d cried Minsk to alert the other night watchers.These bugs were just too many to be immediately eliminated. They moved very fast and soon encircled the night watchers. Countless bugs fully covered the shields of light that were protecting the night watchers. As the several pastors were trying to strengthen their Light Shields, they suddenly felt too weak to cast any spell. Their faces were burning like they were having a fever.As soon as the shields expired, the bugs launched their attack onto the night watchers.Using his Red Dragon Blessing, Minsk blocked some of the bugs away from them with Dragon Scale, but he knew that he was also reaching his limit.It was a level five fiend spell, Plague, co-cast by the five high priests.More dark knights and heretic priests arrived. The situation the night watchers were facing became tough again.Canon Holder stopped attacking and turned to focus on driving away the bugs and curing the night watchers, especially the pastors. Several night watchers wearing silver armor stood in front of the pastors to protect them.As the bugs were dying, the pastors were gradually recovering. Then they started to cast many divine spells such as \u201cBlessing\u201d, \u201cMorale\u201d and \u201cPray\u201d on the four fully armored night watchers to improve their strength, agility and persistence. Clown and Minsk were protecting them from the fierce attack of the dark knights and the priests.The four warriors, blessed by the divine power, shouted and hacked their huge swords toward their enemies at the same time. The black gloves they were wearing covered their swords with a layer of black light, making the swords sharper and more powerful.Although the several dark knights up front had different powers such as Black Dragon, Rock Titan, and Gray Elf, they were not able to resist the furious four warriors with such combined divine power.For some reason, when facing the huge swords, Shield of Darkness became useless, and so did Flame Wall. Four dark priests and a high priest suddenly became totally unprotected and got hacked into half.\u201cThis Blessing is\u2026 Elimination!\u201d The elder great priest in the underground palace was quite surprised, \u201cFour knights with Elimination Blessing\u2026 and one of them is a level five grand knight!\u201dThe Blessing called Elimination could make any supernatural power that did not belong to the real God become invalid. And, of course, the effectiveness of this Blessing depended on the individual power, and the real God it referred to could be chosen.Elimination was the most precious and purest Blessing among the traditional demon hunters.\u201cAngola, you gotta help them,\u201d the other great priest said to the bald priest, \u201cWe should not waste our power here, for such an accident.\u201d\u201cThis accident is a test from God.\u201d Angola smiled, looking rather old, \u201cInteresting. Their original target was a sorcerer, and now we\u2019re fighting.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stay here to protect the temple,\u201d said the great priest in silver robe.\u2026When the night watchers finally found a chance to send the signals, blurs of shadows rushed at them from different directions with great momentum. A knight among the night watchers got struck by the black shadow right in his face and he gave out shrill cries.Level seven fiend spell, Hungry Shadow.Soon the knight\u2019s eyes became red. He slowly lifted his huge sword up and hacked toward the other night watchers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHis soul was eaten by the shadow, and his body would be controlled by the spell caster for a short time.\u2026The moment Lucien sensed the evil aura from the great priest, he suddenly sat up and became translucent to some extent in the moonlight. He quickly landed on the ground and started to run toward the underground temple as fast as he could from the other side of the forest, in order to avoid the battlefield.Standing in front of the entrance to the underground temple of Argent Horn, although he was almost invisible in the moonlight, Lucien was still very nervous that he might be found by the heretics. However, he knew that uncle Joel and his family were in great danger, so he had no choice but to take the risk.Then, a piece of moonlight secretly sneaked into the cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Around every ten meters, there was a candlestick on the stone wall. The yellow candlelight was rather dim and made the pathway even more thrilling.Quick as a shadow, Lucien quietly followed the pathway and went into the deeper darkness.\u2026The silver-robed great priest was checking the other pathways through which the hounds of the Church might sneak into the relic. However, he left the main entrance for last since Angola was fighting in the front, and that gave Lucien precious time to find the dungeon.\u2026Instead of spreading his spiritual power, Lucien was using his acute hearing to sense his surroundings. It seemed most of the guards were currently out to fight against the night watchers, since Lucien heard no one talking or walking. In the nest of the heresy, he needed to be very cautious with the use of any supernatural power.The underground relic was huge. Although he did have a few rough guesses from observing the surroundings in the Scene balls, Lucien never expected that there was indeed such a magnificent relic here.As the ground became smoother, Lucien saw that there were many iron doors on both sides of the pathway. Feeling rather hesitant, he was not sure if he should open the closest door in front of him.His right hand grabbed the handle, slightly shaking. Lucien had no idea what was waiting for him in the room.Just when he was about to turn the handle, Lucien heard someone talking. The voice came from another room, but not far from where Lucien was standing now.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on outside? All the priests are out?\u201d a man asked. His voice sounded nervous.\u201cI have no idea what is happening. The explosion sounded horrible.\u201d answered the second person.After roughly estimating the strength of the two heretics, Lucien decisively opened the door and fiercely rushed at them. The heretics were totally unprepared for this sudden attack and in the next second they were knocked out and fell on the ground.Closing the door behind him, Lucien awoke one of the young heretics.After feeling rather confused for a second, the heretic recalled what just happened and was about to scream for help. However, the only thing he managed to do was opening his mouth. As soon as he made eye contact with Lucien, his mind got lost.There were countless stars in Lucien\u2019s eyes, and his eyes were as deep as two black holes.\u201cDo you know where they are, the poor family that they just caught several days ago?\u201d asked Lucien in a soft and low voice.\u201cYes\u2026 yes my lord.\u201d The young heretic looked rather respectful since he had been hypnotized by Lucien\u2019s Eyes of Stars. And as Eyes of Stars was more of a kind of hypnotism, very little magic wave could be detected.From that hypnotized heretic, Lucien collected some important information: the palace was located in the west side of the huge relic, where the main force of Argent Horn usually patrolled, while the dungeon was in the northwest, guarded by an average dark knight and several of his squires.Besides, the relic actually had more than one level. However, the several levels beneath were completely destroyed and could not be utilized anymore. On this level, there was a total of five pathways connected to the Black Forest.Knowing that the main force could come back at any moment, Lucien needed to be hurry. Breaking the two heretics\u2019 necks, he left the room, bypassed the palace in the west and headed toward the dungeon fast and quietly.\u2026With a better knowledge of this relic, Lucien calmed down a bit. Soon he arrived at the dungeon.The dungeon was quite big, and it was divided into half by the iron bars. There were around seven or eight cells on one side, while on the other side four knight squires were pacing back and forth, talking about what was going on outside. Behind them, assorted instruments of torture were hanging on the wall.The old man wearing black leather armor had a twisted face. At this moment, he was sitting on a bench, listening to the sound of fighting outside and looking at the cells on the other side with an irritated expression. Lucien thought that he must be the dark knight.Then the old knight stood up and said with anger, \u201cBring them here\u2026 the two who lost their fingers. I need to have something to do.\u201dLucien\u2019s heart suddenly sank.\u201cLord Janson, they can\u2019t be killed right now!\u201d A knight squire dissuaded him.\u201cI don\u2019t need you to remind me!\u201d shouted Janson irritably, \u201cThey\u2019re the most f***king troublesome prisoners in the whole bloody dungeon. I gotta take them to that shitty cabin every couple of days! So what am I in the priests\u2019 eyes? A f***king dog walker?!\u201dJanson\u2019s irritability and anger came from his Blessing. The squires exchanged a look and one of them took the keys and opened a cell.\u201cYou two, get out of here.\u201d Tim kicked Joel and Alisa who were lying on the ground.Joel and Alisa were very scared. Iven\u2019s eyes were filled with tears and he bit his lips silently, since there was nothing he could do as a young boy.\u201cMove!\u201d Tim kicked Joel on his back. Out of the iron bars, Joel staggered forward and fell over in front of Janson.Taking the leather whip down from the wall, Jason fiercely flipped the whip on Joel and Alisa with great anger, \u201cRubbish! Damned idiots! And I need to f***king walk you EVERY\u2026 F***KING\u2026 DAY!\u201dEvery time he burst out a word, Janson lashed at them with a bitter whip.Although Janson was still constraining himself to avoid killing Joel and Alisa, his whips still made Joel and Alisa scream at the top of their lungs in great pain and roll on the ground back and forth.While Janson was enjoying the screams, Lucien was clenching his fists with great anger. The muscles of his body were all tensed up. He wanted to kill all the bastards and tear them up to pieces, right now.However, he still had to bide his time. Acting in a rush and impulsively could easily kill him here, not to mention rescuing uncle Joel and his family.Hiding in the darkness, Lucien was waiting.\u2026\u201cIlia, these night watchers are tough.\u201d Angola was floating high in the air, sending his voice to the other great priest using his fiend power, \u201cThey have lots of powerful magic items. Luckily, we took the initiative and all of their magic items are destroyed.\u201dOnly five night watchers were still standing. They were Clown, Salvador\u2015the Canon Holder, a grand knight, Minsk\u2015the Red Dragon, and a pastor. The other twenty five night watchers were all dead, and some of the bodies were even destroyed.\u201cDon\u2019t waste our time anymore, Angola. Finish them all, and we have to destroy this entrance.\u201dIlia\u2019s voice came and urged him.\u201cAll right.\u201d Angola raised his arms again, covered by dark shadows.At this time, the night sky suddenly turned blue in a weird way, as if the ocean and the sky exchanged their positions. The ocean was hanging up above them and a huge water column shot downward and overwhelmed Angola!Ilia sensed the power, and he stood up instantly.Camil, the Blue Tide.The level seven radiant knight arrived!Flying high in the sky, the two great cardinals, Gossett and Amelton, also arrived following lady Camil.\u201cKill all the prisoners! Destroy all the evidence! Everyone leave through the other pathways!\u201d Ilia commanded immediately.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the same time, he started to cast the spells to destroy the altar. Although he was a level seven priest himself as well, the reinforcements of the Church consisting of the two great cardinals and a radiant knight were irresistible.Besides, Sard, the horrible monster, also could show up there at any moment.\u2026Receiving the order, Janson lifted his whip high with a savage look on his face.When Lucien heard the deafening splash coming from outside, he knew it was time for him to take action. Like a white shadow, Lucien jumped out of the darkness and rushed at the dark knight with great momentum.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The moment he sensed the danger, Janson turned his wrist and fiercely flipped the leather whip backwards.Lucien was prepared and he was also faster than Janson. Tapping the ground with one foot, Lucien quickly changed the direction of his movement and, at the same time, he easily cut off the leather whip with the dagger in his hand.Without any hesitation, Janson threw the whip away and grabbed his triple-headed flail from the table. The big chunks of muscle under his leather armor almost burst out and his eyes became red, like those of a furious bull.Facing Janson\u2019s huge weapon, Lucien suddenly stopped and dropped a handful of fine powder on the ground.A deafening thunder burst out.The loud thunder almost knocked Janson unconscious for a second, not to mention his four squires. When they were about to pick up their weapons, they were attacked by the strong sound waves and then fell on the ground.Uncle Joel and Alisa also passed out.Homan\u2019s Oscillation, a spell of apprentice level which utilized high-decibel sound waves as the weapon. Being used properly, a low level spell could also be quite effective.Facing the great thunder, Lucien himself also felt a bit sick. By the time when he was able to take a firm stand again, Janson had also recovered and started to wield his huge flail.That was a triple-headed flail, looking rather heavy, and the three heads were also different: one was covered with lightning, one with fire and the last one with a green and sticky slime.The big chunks of muscle in Janson\u2019s arms were like rocks, and the whole dungeon was slightly trembling from his angry howling. He wielded his flail in a crazy manner, and it seemed like the word \u201cdefense\u201d never existed in his dictionary.Lucien was a bit surprised. After all, most knights, no matter if they were from the Church or the dark knights, were well trained with different fighting skills, however, Janson was not one of them. Probably it was because his physical strength was so overwhelming that there was no need for him to carry out the strategies in his mind.The idea of a direct head-on resistance was obviously too stupid, and Lucien was way smarter than that. Employing delaying tactics together with his Moonlight Blessing, Lucien kept moving around swiftly in the dungeon to avoid the three huge iron balls of the flail, waiting for the dark knight to get tired.However, Lucien soon noticed that something was not right: It seemed that the one who would be exhausted first was himself. The buzzing lightning on one of the iron balls was somehow slowly paralyzing his body, even if the flail never actually hit Lucien.Lucien could not waste time anymore. He took a few large steps back, to gain some distance from Janson who was fighting like a furious beast, and within few seconds Janson was once again in front of Lucien, wielding his terrifying black flail with great momentum.Throwing another handful of shining power to the ground, Lucien activated the spell without casting. Although that would cost him more spiritual power, it was definitely worth it.A dazzling light ball suddenly appeared in the dungeon, and it instantly lit up the whole place like the midday sun.Janson subconsciously closed his eyes to protect them from the bright light and his movement paused for a second. That second was more than enough for Lucien.Curling his body a bit, Lucien shot himself out toward Janson, as fast as an arrow. The dagger was shining with a cool radiance in his hand.Janson quickly turned his wrist inwards to attack Lucien with his flail, but it was too late. Although the three iron balls were still chasing Lucien\u2019s back, he was already very close to Janson!However, Lucien\u2019s silver dagger almost cracked when he stabbed Janson in the chest. Because of his Furious Savage Blessing, Janson\u2019s chest muscles were like big pieces of rock, which were also covered by his fine leather armor.Janson\u2019s relentless attack was supported by his great defensive capability!The flail was just a few centimeters away from Lucien\u2019s back.Janson looked at Lucien with a cruel smile on his face, but surprisingly, this skinny little bastard smiled back at him.The dark knight immediately realized the great danger. Fiercely leaning back his body, Janson tried to avoid the second round attack.Palmeira\u2019s Frost Blades. Three sharp ice blades targeted Janson\u2019s throat, heart and waist.Since they were too close to each other, by the time Janson started to tilt backward, the blades had already arrived.While the one targeting his heart was stopped by the tough muscle in his left chest, the other two blades cut his throat and his abdomen wide open. His blood spurted out but froze instantly.At the same time, Lucien quickly covered his body with a layer of moonlight to take the attack of the flail. While the flame and acid were blocked by Lucien\u2019s Moonlight Armor, the lightning went directly through and struck him.Janson and Lucien fell onto the ground at the same time. Lucien was paralyzed by the lightning and he felt both pain and itch in his body.Bang! The flail fell to the ground from Janson\u2019s hand as well.Rough and muffled groans came from Janson\u2019s throat. Lucien could see that the fresh blood was still running out of the big man\u2019s body.A few seconds later, the groans stopped. Jason\u2019s eyes were still wide open, filled with anger and astonishment.Lucien stood up with great effort and finally stabilized his legs. Slowly, he approached Janson\u2019s body and broke the savage\u2019s neck, just in case.Luckily, his tactics worked. By hiding his Blessing and the magic item Ice Revenger, Lucien pretended he was nothing other than an ordinary sorcerer apprentice. If Janson had not underestimated his enemy, Lucien would be in big trouble.Then, without any hesitation, Lucien came to the squires who were trying to stand up from the ground with dizziness and decisively wrenched their necks.He purposefully saved Tim for last.\u201cI beg\u2026 I beg your mercy\u2026 Please!\u201d cried Tim, crawling on the ground.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMercy?\u201d Lucien sneered, \u201cWhen the innocent people were begging, where was your mercy?\u201dA pair of cold hands reached Tim\u2019s throat, and the fingers slowly tightened. Finally, there was a crack in Tim\u2019s neck.Now Lucien held no more fear and hesitation toward killing, since in this world, people like him had to either kill or be killed.\u2026Picking up the heavy flail, Lucien started to attack the five bodies to destroy the evidence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Powerful as it was, the flail soon tore the bodies into pieces and the flame and acid quickly destroyed the body parts completely.Lucien was now feeling a bit concerned because during the fight he had absolutely no idea how dangerous this weapon was. If he really got hit by this flail without his Moonlight Armor, he would be seriously injured.Within only thirty seconds, the bodies turned into a small puddle of unknown green liquid and some ashes floating in the air.Lucien kicked over the water bucket in the corner and quickly cleaned up the mess on the floor. As for the floating ashes, he summoned a gust of wind by heating up some of the air inside that room and cooling down the air outside of it, to blow the ashes away to the aisle.Then, with great caution, Lucien carried Joel and Alisa back to the cell with Iven, who were still unconscious from the oscillation spell. Although Lucien was very excited to see Joel, Alisa and Iven again, he could not leave with them right now, or he would definitely be suspected by the Church. After all, in people\u2019s eyes, he was no more than a physically weak musician.After all the work, he pulled out a tube of Brown Owl and drank it, as his natural recovery was slower underground due to the lack of moonlight.A moment later, Lucien was rushing through the most remote pathway to leave the underground palace, carrying the flail with him. The pathway was very far from the palace and the other core places in the complex, therefore, it should be relatively safe. However, the weird thing was that Lucien did not see any heretics on his way.\u2026Down on their knees, these ordinary heretics in the stone room sounded rather panicked, \u201cLord Jerome, what shall we do right now! We\u2026!\u201dBefore they could finish their words, their faces suddenly twisted with great pain. Pieces of black cloud came out of their bodies and instantly took their souls away.As the masses of black cloud were absorbed into Jerome\u2019s body, he shrugged a bit, \u201cWell\u2026 what you guys should do is to die.\u201dIt would be impossible for those ordinary heretics to escape from the Church, so they must die, or more information about Argent Horn would be revealed.\u2026Lucien was getting close to his destination. He could see dim rays of moonlight cast from the outside of the cave. Suddenly, he stopped running and hid himself in a dark corner because he sensed the strong smell of blood.There were several dead bodies scattered on the ground on the way out of the complex. According to their special robes, Lucien could tell they were the heretics from Argent Horn.Realizing that the heretics were killing their ordinary followers, Lucien decided to wait there a bit more, just in case.Someone was screaming with great fear in the darkness. As the squeal was getting closer and closer, Lucien clenched his fists.Suddenly, the squeal stopped. The person was killed.\u201cThis should be the last one,\u201d sounded a cold voice. \u201cIlia asked us to leave as soon as possible after cleaning up.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see Janson\u2026\u201d the other young but hoarse voice answered.\u201cWe\u2019re not gonna wait for the savage. We can\u2019t,\u201d urged the cold voice.\u201cAll right\u2026 We leave now,\u201d agreed the second person.Then Lucien heard their steps leaving the cave.Taking a deep breath, Lucien made his body partially translucent into the moonlight and rushed to the exit. Under the cover of the silver moon, he successfully jumped into a bush.Breathing the air mixed with the smell of dirt, Lucien released a long sigh of relief.It was very quiet around him. For a moment, he felt that what happened in the underground palace was almost like a dream. However, the many scattered dead bodies of the heretics around the bush were reminding him how cruel the night was.Looking up at the moon and the few stars in the sky, Lucien roughly figured out his current location and started to run toward Massol River, to get back to Family Hayne\u2019s manor.\u2026The heavy flail was quite cumbersome, but luckily the silver moon was out tonight, and Lucien\u2019s speed and strength were both improved in the moonlight.Several minutes later, he approached the wood cabin with great caution. Almost everything was destroyed in this area from the many powerful divine and fiend spells.Dead bodies were everywhere, and many of them were burned beyond recognition.Among the bodies, Lucien saw one wearing a sorcerer robe, which draw his attention the most.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSo Lucien flipped the body over, and he saw the young man\u2019s face. The great fear the man experienced before he died was still there.\u201cFire Wolf\u2026\u201d Lucien murmured the name.An idea came to Lucien\u2019s mind.Using Mage Hand, Lucien left a line of words on Fire Wolf\u2019s body with his half-clotted blood.\u201cTHE END OF THE BETRAYER.

Although it looked rather plain, the bracelet possessed a great power of illusory flame that surprised Lucien quite a bit when he was examining it with his spiritual power. He believed that this bracelet was even more powerful than his Ice Revenger, and the bracelet was at least a level two high-ranked magic item.The other thing Lucien found was an iron black dagger, that felt very cold and sharp.Lucien put the bracelet and the dagger into the pockets of his robe. Standing up and looking around, he was quite sure that he could still find more magic items from these dead bodies scattered everywhere. In the next second, however, Lucien quickly dispelled this idea, warning himself not to be greedy.After crossing the river, Lucien found a place for a short rest in the Black Forest to recover his spiritual and physical power. During the break, he registered the inner magic structures of the flail, the bracelet and the iron black dagger in his spirit library for a detailed analysis later.Then, Lucien buried the flail under a weird-shaped big cedar, and hid the bracelet and the dagger underneath a big rock.Without a deeper analysis, Lucien could not make sure that the magic items were clean and safe. If there were any trailing or locating marks on them and if Lucien just took them back home carelessly, these things would become his catastrophe.\u2026Larnaca Canyon.In a dark corner in the canyon, Angola was grabbed by the neck and lifted up by a long and fair hand. The seemingly delicate hand was doing the job easily, as if it was picking up a little mouse, instead of a level seven great priest.\u201cYou can\u2019t kill me! You don\u2019t have to\u2026!\u201d Angola\u2019s voice squeezed out from his throat, filled with great fear and surprise.\u201cWell\u2026 Unfortunately, I\u2019m afraid I have to.\u201d The voice was was soft and sweet, \u201cIt\u2019s very impressive that you could escape from Amelton, one of the top three experts in tracking in the duchy. However, you still represent a great danger to us. If she finds you, all of us will be in deep trouble.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s just your excuse!\u201d cried Angola, \u201cWe share the same goal\u2026 and we shall find the\u2026!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Angola. I\u2019m fed up with the awful sulphur smell in the evil blood you all have.\u201d The soft voice cut him off, \u201cYou think we are allies? Don\u2019t be silly. I\u2019ve changed my mind and I don\u2019t want to be a part of it anymore.\u201d\u201cAre you insane?! You can\u2019t!\u201d Angola\u2019s voice came out from his throat with great difficulty, \u201cYou\u2019ll be punished!\u201d\u201cNone of your business.\u201d The beautiful long hand tightened a bit, and Angola\u2019s body started to get dehydrated very fast. In the next second, the body exploded silently into fine, light yellow powder that spread through the air.\u201cI can share a piece of news with you, for free, Angola\u2026 since you\u2019re dead already,\u201d said the soft voice, \u201cHathaway will soon be back from the secret dimension.\u201dThen, the beautiful pale hand disappeared in the darkness.Two minutes later, a woman in cardinal clothes arrived. Floating in the air and looking around, her eyes were cold in contrast with her bright red rob.\u201cAngola disappeared\u2026 completely?\u201d She murmured in a low voice.\u2026Running at full speed in the Black Forest, Lucien was like a white shadow.Twenty minutes later, he saw the manor of House Hayne. Lights were still on, and music was still playing. The big party was still going on around the midnight.And like what he was expecting, the heretic who had been trailing him all the time was still there observing the manor, but now it was Lucien that was watching him from behind.If this heretic was caught by the Church, Lucien would be in trouble for lying about how he awoke his Blessing.As he was very close to the manor, Lucien needed to finish the heretic as quietly as possible. After estimating the heretic\u2019s level, he slowly approached him and silently activated Darkness silently.The heretic looked very confused for a second, as all the light suddenly disappeared and the pure darkness pressed on his head. Then he sensed the magic wave coming from behind him. He was under attack!Because of Lucien\u2019s Dark Vision, the spell did not affect him at all.Before the heretic could see anything, Lucien\u2019s hands had already reached his neck.\u201cCrack.\u201dAnd that was the last thing the heretic heard in this world.\u2026Clown, Canon Holder, Lend, Juliana and Minsk gathered in front of the cabin. After the bitter fight, the great depression and tiredness on their faces were impossible to hide. When the night watchers were searching the underground complex and chasing the heretics, they were silently immersed in their mourning.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOnly five night watchers survived the battle, out of thirty, who were all excellent and brave warriors in fighting against the darkness and evil.

Deep silence enwrapped everyone with tremendous pressure.In the darkness, Clown clenched his fists with rage and slowly squeezed out a word through his teeth:\u201cProfessor\u2026!\u201dTaking off the black gloves, Salvador, the Canon Holder, put his bare hands on the chest and started to pray for the twenty-five deceased night watchers. His voice sounded very solemn, \u201cYou gain when you give. You live forever after you die. Paradise is open to you.\u201dThen Salvador pulled out his white handkerchief and tied it on his wrist, \u201cThe day that I burn Professor to death will be the day I take this off.\u201dFollowing Salvador\u2019s suit, the grand knight Lend also tied on a white handkerchief and lowered his head, \u201cI\u2019ll never forget this battle, my fellows. This so-called Professor will pay in blood.\u201d\u201cProfessor is on the top of my target list,\u201d joined Juliana. Recalling the bitter battle, Juliana\u2019s heart was still filled with fear. She suffered the pain of watching her teammates dying one by one right in front of her eyes. She remembered the desperation she experienced when her healing spells became useless when facing the dark power. Although Juliana did hate Professor to the guts, she was also subconsciously afraid of him.\u201cBastard\u2026 You bloody bastard!\u201d Clown could not hold himself back anymore, \u201cI\u2019ll find you and torture you. Wherever you go, whoever you are, I\u2019ll turn your body into my puppet and I\u2019ll have your soul gnawed by the demons, suffering in hell!\u201d Clown never experienced such failure since he joined the Night Watch. As a level five grand knight, his confidence was ruined tonight.The forever-smiling clown mask on his face looked rather strange and horrible in the darkness.\u201cIt was my fault. I was so close to Professor\u2026\u201d Minsk put on a white handkerchief as well.Clown slowly calmed down, then turned around to the other four night watchers, \u201cProfessor must be leaving Aalto soon. We should add Professor to our Cleansing List and search him all over the continent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the bastard is not qualified for this,\u201d said Lend with a bit of hesitation, \u201cAfter all, the names on the list were all extremely powerful. Some of them are even capable of changing the situation of the whole world. Professor\u2026 he is only a level three or four sorcerer.\u201dThe Cleansing List was shared by all the inquisitions on the continent. Every name was regarded as a great trouble to the Church and was continuously hunted by the most powerful pastors and night watchers from different inquisitions. However, the list had not changed for many years, since hunting them down was extremely difficult.\u201cTwenty-five night watchers died because of him,\u201d said Canon Holder seriously. \u201cAlthough he\u2019s not even of a senior rank, his cruelty and slyness should not be underestimated.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d Lend nodded. \u201cWe shall make a proposal to Cardinal Amelton, then. \u201d\u201cLet\u2019s find our teammates\u2026 at least part of them,\u201d said Salvador solemnly.\u2026It took Lucien a while to wipe out all the evidence, including the heretic\u2019s body and his own torn robe, and he also cleaned himself a bit. Then he came to the other side of the manor through the woods and climbed over the tall wall of the manor.Quietly and carefully, Lucien landed in the shadow of the three-storey house, covered by the tall, lush grass and bushes.When Lucien stood up and was patting away the dust on his hands, his heart suddenly skipped a beat.\u201cGood evening, Lucien.\u201d It was Rhine. He was only wearing a loose, dark red shirt, of which the top part was unbuttoned. His skin looked even paler than that of a noble lady in the moonlight.\u201cGo-good evening, Mr. Rhine.\u201d Seeing that it was Rhine, Lucien was a bit relieved, but he still remained cautious, \u201cYou\u2019re still up?\u201d\u201cSo are you.\u201d Rhine\u2019s put on a meaningful smile.Lucien forced a smile on his face, \u201cIf I told you that I\u2019m wandering here to enjoy the beautiful silver moon tonight, would you believe my words?\u201dWhen he was talking, Lucien lowered his head and looked at himself. Parts of his lower arms were stained by muddy water, and his shirt was crumpled out of shape. Most importantly, as he looked up, Lucien found that the silver moon was hidden by the tall stone wall.What an excellent excuse it was!\u201cYes, I believe your words, because\u2026\u201d Rhine shrugged his shoulders, \u201cI\u2019m here for the moon as well.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026?\u201d Lucien was suddenly at a loss.\u201cFor sure\u2026 Did you see how charming, how bright the silver moon is tonight!\u201d Rhine raised his head and praised the stone wall standing in front of him with affection, \u201cWe are here for the same reason, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Lucien took a longer breath and became serious, \u201cCan you tell me who you are, Mr. Rhine?\u201d As he could not pretend he was an innocent young man anymore, Lucien decided to ask Rhine directly, and he had the feeling that Rhine held no hostility toward him.\u201cI\u2019m just a bard.\u201d Rhine shook his head, \u201cA bard who has nothing to do with the place you are longing for. And even if I tell you where it is, you are still not capable of going there.\u201d\u201cYou can tell me now! At least I can have a more specific goal!\u201d asked Lucien eagerly.\u201cMy suggestion is that you should work hard and become a real musician, then you can travel to the many countries around the continent. That\u2019ll be a great benefit to your goal.\u201d Then Rhine turned around and left.Lucien was confused. Eager as he was, he knew that he must leave now, in case someone else showed up.After climbing into the guest room, Lucien put the two sapphires back into his pocket and lay down.What happened tonight already seemed like a dream to Lucien. Shutting down the brain and feeling the cozy blanket, he slowly fell into sleep.Lucien did not know how long his sleep lasted when he was awakened by a gentle knock at the door.\u201cWho is that?\u201d asked Lucien in a low voice.\u201cIt\u2019s me, Yvette. Do you want to take a walk with me to enjoy the fantastic silver moon tonight?\u201d invited the noble lady in an alluring way.Lucien was a bit choked with what Yvette just said. He was already very impressed with the moon, and it seemed like everyone wanted to take a walk in the moonlight that night.\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m terribly sorry, Yvette. I twisted my ankle and I\u2019m feeling sleepy.\u201d Lucien refused her directly, \u201cMaybe next time. Thank you for asking.\u201dYvette slightly stamped her foot with disappointment and anger outside of Lucien\u2019s room, \u201cSuch an idiot!

No wonder you have no girlfriend!\u201d A female voice came from the window, \u201cYou should learn from me! I always knocked the door of Silvia\u2019s room at midnight.\u201dIt was Princess Natasha, who was standing on the windowsill, followed by lady Camil floating in the air. With a longsword in one hand and her visor in the other hand, Natasha\u2019s purple hair was fluttering in the wind. The central part of her white armor was dark red, which was from the blood of a dragon.Noticing that Lucien was looking at her armor, Natasha smiled, \u201cYou like this armor, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s called Dragon Blood, I\u2019m wearing it because I just came back from the battle with Argent Horn.\u201dPausing a bit, Natasha continued, \u201cBy the way, Lucien, would you like to take a walk in the beautiful moonlight?

Are they safe now? Where are they now?\u201d Recovering from the surprise of suddenly seeing the princess on his windowsill, Lucien asked so eagerly that he forgot to use the proper salutation.Anyone who cared about his or her family would definitely react like this. And Lucien regarded them as his closest relatives in this world.Although he had killed Janson and the squires in the dungeon, Lucien was still looking forward to the confirmation from the princess. After all, the battle tonight was so cruel that ordinary people like Joel, Alisa and Iven could easily become the innocent victims of the many powerful magic spells.\u201cWell\u2026 I was fighting on the frontline, Lucien,\u201d said Natasha a bit embarrassed. \u201cSorry, I should\u2019ve paid more attention to your family\u2026 But don\u2019t worry, Lucien. I did confirm with the knight who was responsible for saving the hostages, and they are safe.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Your Grace.\u201d A sincere smile appeared on Lucien\u2019s face. As his whole plan was like walking a tightrope, any tiny mistake could kill the people that he cared the most in this world. \u201cThen where are they now? When I can see them?\u201d Lucien asked again.\u201cThey are in the main cathedral right now, since they were tortured badly, both physically and mentally,\u201d Camil answered. \u201cThe pastors in the church will take care of them, and they need to be questioned later.\u201d\u201cBut they are innocent! They\u2019re just ordinary people\u2026\u201d Lucien shuddered to think of the questioning that he received, or say, the one this body once received, from the Church.\u201cI know what you\u2019re worrying about, Lucien,\u201d Natasha comforted him, \u201cLast time you were wronged as a suspect, but this time it\u2019s different. The Church just wants to ask them some questions about the dungeon guards of Argent Horn, nothing else.\u201dThen Natasha said to lady Camil, \u201cThe power of a radiant knight is surely impressive. That sudden attack you launched toward the great priest was so powerful that the poor people in the dungeon were even knocked out. I wonder when I will become a radiant knight.\u201d\u201cMay\u2026 may I ask what is Argent Horn?\u201d asked Lucien purposefully.\u201cIt was Argent Horn that kidnapped your uncle and his family. They are followers of demon, and they call themselves Argent Horn,\u201d explained Natasha. \u201cTheir souls are completely corrupted by darkness. When we were trying to catch the heretics alive, they shouted \u2018Return to the eternal silence\u2019 and blew themselves up.\u201dSpeaking of this, Natasha\u2019s heart was still beating fast. Although she was only one step away from becoming a radiant knight and was quite experienced in fighting, the horrible scene of the heretics exploding themselves in front of her was still bothering the princess\u2019s mind.\u201cAll of the heretics\u2026 they killed themselves?\u201d Lucien of course hoped that they were all dead so the Church and the princess would never know how he actually awoke his Blessing.\u201cMost of the heretics died, and some of their leaders escaped.\u201d Then Natasha slightly raised her head and said with pride, \u201cBut I caught a priest alive. And we learned that the right hand of a powerful demon was sealed in the relic, but it was taken away by the heretics who escaped.\u201dHearing that a heretic got caught, Lucien\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He quickly calmed down and asked, \u201cAny other information? I\u2019m afraid they\u2019re plotting something toward you and the grand duke.\u201d\u201cYes, they are planning on something big.\u201d Natasha touched her chin thoughtfully, \u201cBut only the great priests know the plan.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll investigate the personnel of our intelligence department. I\u2019m sure we can find more later,\u201d added Camil seriously.\u201cI see\u2026 so I\u2019m safe now, right?\u201d asked Lucien although he already knew the answer. He felt he could be a pretty good actor.\u201cAlthough we did not find the person who was always watching you, I\u2019m quite sure that you\u2019re safe now. After all, the heretics suffered a great loss tonight, and they are currently busy with running for their lives.\u201dLucien nodded, putting on a relieved look.\u201cThank you, Lucien. Your information helped us a lot this time,\u201d said Natasha sincerely.\u201cThat\u2019s my pleasure,\u201d Lucien lowered his head and answered politely.At that moment, Camil\u2019s face darkened and her eyebrows frowned together, which made her look even more serious than usual.\u201cWhat happened, auntie?\u201d\u201cViscount Stuart killed himself before our people arrived, Your Grace,\u201d answered Camil in a low voice.Viscount Stuart was in charge of the intelligence department of the duchy, who was also a grand knight.Natasha waved her right hand and her vambrace made a crisp clack, \u201cSomeone\u2019s behind Stuart\u2026 But why did Stuart betray us? Why he wanted to become the enemy of the Church?\u201d\u201cWe should go now, Your Grace,\u201d Camil reminded her.\u201cOh\u2026 I just realized that I\u2019m still standing on the window. I gotta go now, Lucien.\u201d Natasha nodded to him, \u201cThe whole thing is even more complicated than I thought. And I\u2019ll tell the Church that you\u2019ve awakened your Blessing under my help.\u201dThen she paused a bit and said to Lucien, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I cannot make you a knight and give you a title, since according to the law, you\u2019re not as powerful as a knight yet. Besides, making you a knight at this time might put you at great risk. I hope you understand.\u201d\u201cI totally understand, Your Grace,\u201d answered Lucien. \u201cYour trust is the most important thing to me, and my family is safe. I cannot ask for more.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll reward you with a manor several months later. You have my word,\u201d said Natasha.\u201cA manor? Your Grace, that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s too much.\u201d Lucien refused subconsciously, knowing that he would be leaving Aalto sooner or later. Money was better than a manor to him.Natasha waved her hands and insisted, \u201cHouse Violet always pays. It\u2019s our royal tradition. By the way, how did you find out the approximate location, Lucien?\u201d\u201cI saw a special kind of long-tailed tit in the ball.\u201d Lucien was prepared for this question and thus lied without any hesitation, \u201cWhen I was too poor to feed myself, I often went to the Black Forest for the wild mushrooms and I saw them a few times. Around Aalto, these birds only live around Melzer Black Forest and Lubeck Mountain.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cInteresting. Never heard it before.\u201d Natasha nodded, \u201cBesides the manor, you should have a knight sword. I\u2019ll find you one, Lucien.\u201d\u201cThank you so much, Your Grace.\u201d Lucien bowed to the princess.Natasha took a step backward and floated in the air. Although she was not a radiant knight, her Dragon Blood Armor could help her fly.\u201cRemember to take a walk in the moonlight, Lucien.\u201d Natasha laughed and then flew away with Camil.After watching them leave, Lucien released a long sigh of relief. Suddenly, he felt very exhausted.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The huge rock started to crack from his dark power.\u201cWho can tell me\u2026 what the hell happened?!\u201d Ilia was shouting like a wounded beast.They suffered a great loss tonight. The power of Argent Horn in the duchy was almost annihilated. The number of the members who survived was less than ten, including a level five dark knight, Dragan, two high priests, three ordinary priests and an ordinary dark knight.Years of Ilia\u2019s hard work were ruined overnight. Now his body was covered by a layer of black fire with a strong smell of sulphur. As the silver hood slipped down, Ilia\u2019s face was revealed.There were two goat horns on his head, and his eyes were bloody red. The knights and the priests kneeling in front of him didn\u2019t dare to look up.After a while, Ilia calmed himself down and put the hood on again. Then, he asked, \u201cWho can tell me\u2026 why the Church and House Violet were there tonight?\u201d\u201cThe so-called Professor\u2026 he was escaping from the Church tonight and somehow he found the underground palace. That\u2019s what I know,\u201d answered Dragan carefully.After a moment of silence, Ilia shouted again, \u201cThen who\u2019s that bloody Professor?!\u201d\u201cThe night watcher said that this Professor might come from the Continental Congress of Magic,\u201d answered Dragan, \u201cActually, we got the news that Professor was gonna meet a sorcerer apprentice somewhere in the Black Forest. Since it was very far from us\u2026\u201d\u201cYou f***king idiots!\u201d Ilia almost wanted to tear Dragan into pieces.Knowing that he said something stupid, Dragan lowered his head and dared not contradict the great priest. In Dragan\u2019s mind, it was just impossible for them to block the whole Black Forest and drive all the people in the forest away.\u201cProfessor\u2026 he did this on purpose.\u201d Gnashing his teeth, Ilia said slowly, \u201cKilling two birds with one stone, even without getting any blood on his own hands. But why he did this\u2026\u201d\u201cBut I thought the Congress of Magic was on our side\u2026\u201d asked a level five priest with confusion.\u201cInternal conflict is everywhere,\u201d sneered Ilia.Then Ilia turned around and started to pray to the Great Master of Argent, seeking for the revelation from his God.All the followers started to pray as well.A black shadow came out from Ilia\u2019s silver robe and gradually covered all of them.In the darkness, all the followers present heard a deep voice in their mind, but only Ilia could understand the message.Soon the shadow disappeared and Ilia stood up. He raised his right hand high and said to all the followers, \u201cThe Great Master of Argent assured me that despite the setback we suffered tonight, we\u2019ll still be able to accomplish the task, and build the great realm for our true God on the ground.\u201d\u201cMay you walk on the ground, as you walk in your realm,\u201d responded the other followers in an encouraged way.\u201cThe Great Master also showed me a prophecy: \u2018A falling star has brought the chaos. The throne of fate has lost its master. The nonbeliever who walks in light and darkness will make his debut\u2019.\u201d\u201cWhat does it mean?\u201d asked Dragan, \u201cIt\u2019s like a poem\u2026\u201d\u201cThe devil sullied Aalto. We cannot see it clearly.\u201d Ilia shook his head.Fate and time were the hardest to understand. Even the greatest prophet was like an ordinary person when facing a huge mountain, and all he or she could see was only a very small part of it.\u2026Lucien slept very well last night. He woke up with the pleasant twitter of birds around eight in the morning.The ball ended very late. Many people were still in their beds. Thus, no one urged Lucien to go for breakfast.It was the first time Lucien enjoyed such nice and soft blankets since he crossed over to this world, thus it took Lucien more than half an hour to actually get up and get dressed.When Lucien was walking downstairs, a maid came to him and smiled, \u201cGood morning, Mr. Evans, what do you want to have for breakfast?\u201d\u201cBread, cheese sausage\u2026 with milk, please,\u201d answered Lucien. He ordered a rich breakfast since he had a pretty good work out last night.\u201cSure.\u201d The maid nodded, \u201cYou\u2019d like to have the breakfast in the dining room or your own room, sir?\u201dLucien glanced at the dining room downstairs and saw Rhine was sitting there.\u201cDining room, thank you.\u201dWhen Lucien entered the dining room, Rhine was sending a piece of rare-cooked steak into his mouth.\u201cMorning, Lucien!\u201d greeted Rhine, \u201cYou really should try the steak, very juicy.\u201dLucien took an opposite seat and said to the maid, \u201cA steak for me, please. Medium.\u201dThen Lucien turned to Rhine and smiled, \u201cGood breakfast starts a good day.\u201d\u201cAlso a perfect supplement for a good work out,\u201d said Rhine meaningfully.\u201cEvans, Yvette is like a beast.\u201d A young noble man was sitting beside them. He laughed a bit, but had clearly misunderstood their conversation.\u201cCome on, Albay. I didn\u2019t do anything last night.\u201d Lucien was introduced to this young man last night by Felicia, \u201cI hurt my ankle.\u201d\u201cI see. No wonder\u2026\u201d Albay laughed even harder, \u201cNo wonder Yvette went for hunting very early this morning and she looked angry. Good for you, Lucien.\u201dThe breakfast was pleasant. Seeing that Rhine almost finished his food, Lucien asked hurriedly, \u201cCan you tell me where it is\u2026 the dream like place that you mentioned to me last night?\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s as beautiful as paradise, I\u2019ll tell you the location after you can hold your own concert, as an award.\u201d Rhine smiled in a cunning way. To him, it was very interesting to see Lucien\u2019s growth.After Rhine left, Albay asked Lucien curiously, \u201cWhere is that place you were talking about?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. He won\u2019t tell me right now,\u201d answered Lucien, shrugging his shoulders.What he knew was that his life had better go back to normal, at least for a period of time, to meet Rhine\u2019s requirement as soon as possible. Firstly, Lucien had to abandon the pseudonym Professor.Finishing his breakfast, Lucien saw a sleepy Felicia coming downstairs. He greeted, \u201cGood morning, Felicia.\u201d\u201cMorning, Lucien. How\u2019s your ankle?\u201d asked her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s fine now,\u201d answered Lucien. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Felicia. I\u2019m afraid I cannot go hunting today. I have to go now to deal with some of my personal stuff.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Felicia asked with concern.\u201cSorry, but I have to keep it a secret, Felicia,\u201d Lucien put on a slightly awkward look, 'since it has something to do with the princess.\u201d\u201cSure, Lucien.\u201d Felicia was a bit surprised for a moment, \u201cI\u2019ll send a coach for you.\u201dGetting on the coach, Lucien asked the coachman to go to Lord Venn\u2019s manor first.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Do you need me to tell the guards?\u201d The coachman turned around and asked Lucien politely. An elegant gentleman usually did not talk to ordinary guards.\u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Lucien smiled, \u201cMy friend is a squire here. We\u2019re equal.\u201dWith his awakened Blessing, Lucien was only a step away from becoming a knight. However, in his mind, he and John were simply good friends, and there was no level or class difference between them.It was Ian and Durago who were guarding the gate today. Immediately they puffed out their chests when they saw the fine coach with the coat of arms of Fire Bull, ready to welcome the guest.They were very surprised when they saw Lucien again. They still remembered him: in their memory, Lucien was only a pauper who did not show much respect to them, and now in the white shirt and black suit, the young man looked like a decent noble.They did not come to themselves until Lucien was standing in front of them, \u201cSo\u2026 sorry, are you looking for John?\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201d Lucien did not recognize them.When Ian was about to go into the manor, Durago asked with a bit hesitation, \u201cExcuse me, sir. Are you\u2026 are you Mr. Evans?\u201dAfter the great success of the concert, even John, as a very moderate young man, could not help himself sharing what he knew about Lucien and all the praises his good friend received from the grand duke, the grand cardinal and princess.\u201cYes, I\u2019m John\u2019s friend,\u201d answered Lucien.\u201cYour work, Fate, was played on Lord Venn\u2019s banquet several days ago. It was fantastic!\u201d Durago said to Lucien with great excitement, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry that I was being really rude to you.\u201dThis big tough guy was very sincere and excited. Lucien sort of recalled the conflict that happened between them before and was quite surprised that Durago was this enthusiastic about music.Soon Lucien realized Aalto was indeed the City of Psalm.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m glad you like my work,\u201d answered Lucien politely.Standing beside Durago, Ian put on an embarrassed smile.After the concert, Lucien experienced a big change in the way many people treated him. Durago\u2019s sincere apology and all the flattering words triggered Lucien\u2019s thought. The sudden upgrade in his social status turned what happened several months ago into a distant dream.\u201cMr. Evans, can I invite you to my place?\u201d asked Durago, rubbing his hands nervously with excitement.Finding a random excuse, Lucien refused him politely, but he felt quite awkward.Soon John came following Ian, looking a bit confused, \u201cLucien! I\u2019m going back home later this afternoon. Has anything happened?\u201d\u201cYes, but it has been solved. No worries.\u201d Lucien pulled John\u2019s arm, \u201cLet\u2019s get on the coach first.\u201dThe old coachman was smart enough to know that he should not be listening to the conversation. So he tied the horses firmly to the hitching post, walked away from the coach, and took out his tobacco under a big tree.When John was listening to Lucien, his face darkened and his brows knotted. His knuckles turned white as he gripped his hands so tightly that his whole body was shaking. When he heard that his parents\u2019 fingers were cut, his teeth were gnashing. However, John did not say even a single word. He remained silent and listened carefully.\u201cI\u2019m terribly sorry, John,\u201d said Lucien, whose heart was full of guilt.Lowering his head, John did not answer immediately.Lucien knew that his friend needed some time to recover from his pain and great anger. So he remained silent with John.After a while, John finally started to talk,\u201cLucien, it\u2019s not your fault. I don\u2019t blame you.\u201dThat was the first thing John said to Lucien. Instead of venting his frustration, John chose to comfort his best friend to free him of his horrible guilt.Lucien was quite surprised, and he was touched, \u201cThank you so much, John. What you just said means a lot to me.\u201dWhen John was about to go back to ask for a longer leave from his duty, Lucien stopped him.\u201cWait, John. Here\u2019s twenty grams of Moonlight Rose dust.\u201d Lucien pulled out the small black bag and handed it over to his friend.John had heard just now where did the Moonlight Rose come from. After more than ten seconds, he firmly took the small bag from Lucien\u2019s hand.\u201cThank you, Lucien. I\u2019ll awake my Blessing. Only this way I can protect my family and friends,\u201d said John seriously.\u201cNo rush. Follow Lord Venn\u2019s instruction and take your time.\u201d Lucien nodded, \u201cAlso, can you keep this a secret? After all, I lied to the princess about how I got these roses.\u201d\u201cYou know me, Lucien. I\u2019m more reliable than a dead man.\u201d John patted his friend on the shoulder and promised seriously.\u2026The arrival of the House Hayne\u2019s coach caused a stir in Aderon, the poorest district in the whole city. Although most of them could not name all the coat of arms of the big families in Aalto, they still registered in mind those of the few most powerful noble families.Joel, Alisa and Iven had been sent back home by the Church. The pastors did not find much valuable information with them.Seeing John and Lucien getting off the coach, Iven suddenly burst out crying, as if the little boy was trying to wash away all the horrible memories with his tears.John gently patted Iven\u2019s head and gave him a firm hug, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, now, Iven. You\u2019re already a grown-up man and you did a great job. God bless us.\u201dLucien hugged Joel and Alisa. His apology, worry and joy were all in this big hug.\u201cIt\u2019s not your fault, Lucien.\u201d Joel and Alisa comforted him, \u201cAnd you see\u2026 we\u2019re fine now.\u201dAs the hostages of the vicious heretics, they did not expect that they could survive in the end. When they were saved, they were so grateful to the God of Truth that now they became even more understanding and tolerant. After all, nothing else really mattered when facing death.Then Alisa and Joel told Lucien what the Church and the intelligence department of the duchy questioned them. The thing that concerned the pastors and the intelligence the most was why Alisa and Joel passed out outside of the cell, but were found by the knight inside of the cell later.As the great thunder caused by lady Camil\u2019s power knocked them out instantly, no hostages present could provide any valuable information. In the end, the people from the Church and the intelligence department were guessing that it was probably because the heretics first locked the hostages back in case they would escape, and later on they did not have enough time to come back and kill them all.\u201cWe got really lucky there. Thank God!\u201d Drying her eyes, Alisa was telling Lucien the story.At this time, there came a knock on the door.It was Corella and a church guard that Lucien did not know.Lucien was a bit more relieved seeing that the Church only sent a knight squire there, which meant he was not really suspicious to the Church.After a short and regular investigation, Corella stood up and thanked Lucien on behalf of the Church, \u201cThe bishop appreciated what you did. Without your information, we would have suffered a greater loss.\u201dLucien\u2019s musician identity made it almost impossible for the Church to draw a link between Professor and the princess\u2019 personal consultant. However, there were still some coincidences which involved Lucien that they were unable to explain right now.\u2026Lucien finally came back to his normal life, busy with studying music and magic. He also asked Joel and his family to move into his new house temporarily, since Gesu was way safer than Aderon.In these days, Lucien did not take even a single glance at the broken wall where he usually left secret messages to communicate with the apprentices. To be prudent, he also left aside his plan of destroying his magic lab for the time being.This day Victor started to teach them \u201ccanon\u201d, a contrapuntal compositional technique that employed a melody with imitations of it played after a given duration.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith just a few rules, even beginners could achieve much with canon.\u201cActually, you\u2019ve subconsciously employed cannon in your Symphony of Fate, Lucien,\u201d commented Victor. \u201cIt looks like you learned a lot in the library of the association.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 yes, I guess. Thank you, Mr. Victor,\u201d answered Lucien, a bit absent-minded.His mind was occupied by the thought that he needed to come up with enough music works for holding a concert to meet Rhine\u2019s requirement. Eighty years ago, someone produced a piece of music work which was very similar to the well-known Pachelbel\u2019s Canon, or Canon and Gigue in D, in his original world. However, he could still rewrite Pachelbel\u2019s Canon into a piece of piano concerto.Although he still needed some more \u201coriginal\u201d pieces of music for a personal concert, recomposing was definitely the best time-saving way for Lucien to have his repertoire as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94: The SwordTranslator: Kris_Liu Editor: VermillionAt the end of the class, Victor said to his students, \u201cI know many of you are hard-working and some of you have been studying canon on your own for a while. I\u2019d like to see every one of you try to write a piece of canon to facilitate your understanding toward this compositional technique.\u201dWhile the other students were pretty excited about it, Lucien remained silent with his own thoughts. Seeing that, Victor said to Lucien, \u201cLucien, although you\u2019re indeed very talented, don\u2019t underestimate canon. Simple as it seems to be, an outstanding piece of cannon can still become a masterpiece that lasts for generations, just like Mr. Hersey\u2019s Canon in D. And practicing cannon is very beneficial to a student like you who don\u2019t have a very solid music foundation.\u201dVictor was often mindful of giving Lucien, the young genius, some proper \u201cwarning\u201d to avoid his possible arrogance, which was very common among musicians who became famous at an early age, and unfortunately most of them ended up wasting their talent and lost their reputation very quickly.Not until Victor started to talk to him did Lucien come to himself. He nodded and explained, \u201cThank you, Mr. Victor. I understand how important a solid foundation is and I\u2019ll definitely go all out to work on my canon.\u201d\u201cGood. Then what were you thinking about?\u201d asked Victor.\u201cWhen you were introducing Mr. Hersey\u2019s Canon in D, I was thinking that I could probably recompose this classic piece of work and turn it into a piano concerto. Maybe a piano concerto version of Canon in D will be quite unique.\u201d\u201cInteresting idea, Lucien.\u201d Victor touched his chin a bit when he was thinking, \u201cThe challenging part is that Mr. Hersey\u2019s Canon is composed of very short music bars, thus it\u2019s hard to make considerable changes within it.\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s doable, Mr, Victor?\u201d asked Lucien with expectation.\u201cWell\u2026 Canon in D was recomposed into a few different versions before, so I\u2019d say a piano concerto version is definitely something to look forward to.\u201d Victor confirmed Lucien\u2019s idea and smiled.After the class, when the students were heading toward the practicing rooms, Felicia caught up with Lucien and asked him in a low voice with expectation, \u201cAre you gonna play the piano concerto version of Canon in D on my birthday party next month?\u201dCanon was not a very demanding nor complicated technique. She did not think it would take Lucien too long to do it.Lucien was suddenly inspired, then he smiled, \u201cFelicia, I won\u2019t forget the help you offered me. I\u2019ll play the piano on your birthday party, but not a canon. I\u2019ll compose a piece of serenade for you.\u201d\u201cReally!\u201d That was a big surprise for Felicia.The fact that the personal music consultant of the princess would write a piece of serenade specially for her was totally beyond her expectation.\u201cYes, but it won\u2019t be a very complete one since the time is quite limited. It\u2019s probably only an opusculum.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so great, Lucien!\u201d Felicia was excited but also feeling a bit concerned, \u201cBut you only have a month\u2026 If the work is not good enough, that might damage your reputation.\u201dAlthough composing a piece of opusculum within a month was not rare, Felicia still worried about Lucien. Since Lucien was drawing so much attention right now after the concert, many people who envied his talent were watching him like vicious beasts at night, waiting for any possible chance to launch their attack and to give this young musician a hard time.\u201cA piece of serenade shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d Lucien seemed to be quite confident. And Lucien\u2019s confidence came from the fact that he already found a very classic piece of serenade in his spirit library which resembled no music work in this world.In order to avoid being too suspicious, Lucien decided only to do an opusculum on the birthday party.\u201cAlright\u2026 I\u2019m looking forward to your serenade,\u201d said Felicia with both expectation and concern.\u2026In the following month, except for analyzing magic spells and reading the book named Astrology and Magic Elements written in the ancient Sylvanas language with the help of the witch\u2019s note at night, Lucien spent all his time on studying music and composing his canon and the serenade. After all, music now could provide him with the chance to find the headquarter of the Congress of Magic.With his hard work and great memory, Lucien now finally felt he was qualified enough as a music student. Within this month, he also successfully recomposed Canon in D and finished the serenade for Felicia\u2019s birthday.Meanwhile, John was still working on his knight training. Although he wanted to awaken his Blessing as soon as possible, he was warned by Lord Venn that, without a solid foundation, the awakening would be very likely to fail. Even if he succeed this time, his future growth would be very limited.Thus, John was being very patient, even though that meant he needed to do the same training over and over again everyday. In John\u2019s spare time, he would go into the Black Forest to fight with goblins and cynocephaluses to gather more experience. At the same time, Lord Venn gave John a sum of money and asked him to rent a unit in the administrative district, in order to protect his family.Although Joel and his family had a pretty good time in Lucien\u2019s house, they were definitely even happier with their own place, especially since it was a place that was earned by their son. Therefore, they soon moved out of Lucien\u2019s house, and Lucien respected their choice. After all, they were family, and that would never change, no matter if they lived together or not.\u2026The last Thursday of the Month of Gold (October). War Gallery.\u201cI\u2019m finally satisfied with this part.\u201d Natasha just finished her discussion with Lucien about a movement, \u201cNow this part is exciting enough to meet the theme.\u201d\u201cThe last version was pretty good already.\u201d Lucien smiled, \u201cYou indeed have very high expectations on yourself, Your Grace.\u201dNatasha\u2019s music knowledge was actually way more profound than Lucien\u2019s. By working together, Lucien also learned a lot from the princess.\u201cWell\u2026 if you do something, then you do your best,\u201d said Natasha in a good mood.\u201cYes, Your Grace,\u201d Lucien agreed.When Lucien was about to leave, Natasha asked him with curiosity, \u201cI heard that you wrote a new serenade for your classmate\u2019s birthday party tonight?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Lucien nodded.Pointing at the piano standing in the center of the room, Natasha asked, \u201cCan I listen to it first?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. It\u2019s a gift for Felicia\u2019s birthday,\u201d Lucien refused the princess politely.\u201cWell, I guess\u2026\u201d Natasha took a few steps back and forth, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m very curious, I think you\u2019re right. I feel like writing a love serenade for Silvia\u2019s birthday, too.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s very considerate.\u201d Lucien was almost used to it now.At this time, Natasha turned around and said something to lady Camil. Camil left the room and, a moment later, came back with a fine sword in her hand.\u201cThis is the knight sword that I promised you,\u201d said Natasha. \u201cIts name is \u2018Alert\u2019, and it\u2019s a level one high rank sword with an extraordinary quality. With Alert, your instincts will be way sharper, making you more aware of any approaching danger.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lucien saluted the princess with a knight\u2019s etiquette and the princess leaned the sword against Lucien\u2019s shoulder.\u201cMay your sword guard your will,\u201d said Natasha seriously.Then Lucien took the sword from Natasha\u2019s hands, and followed her instruction to leave a willpower mark on Alert.Alert was of an ordinary level one knight\u2019s attack force, and it could help its owner to be as sensitive to the surroundings as a level two knight.While sorcerers called them magic weapons, the nobles and pastors called them extraordinary weapons, which did not require registration in their owner\u2019s spirit. The owner of an extraordinary weapon or item just needed to leave a mark of his or her will power to activate it. However, according to some makers\u2019 will, some of these weapons or items rejected certain kinds of users and their power could not be activated.Carrying the sword, Lucien saluted the princess again and left the room. Watching Lucien leave, Natasha said to Camil gently, \u201cYou have any plans for this evening, auntie?\u201d\u2026In preparation for the birthday party that night, Felicia did not attend the class today.During the break, Lott and Lucien were chatting casually. Lott told Lucien that this was Felicia\u2019s eighteenth birthday and this was her coming-of-age ceremony, thus many nobles and all the musicians of the association would be present.\u201cAre you feeling nervous? After all, this is your first performance after the concert,\u201d asked Lott.In order to make sure Lucien could focus on studying music after his success, Victor was \u201cprotecting\u201d Lucien with great caution. On behalf of his student, Victor turned down many invitations and offers for Lucien, and that made many people feel even more curious about this young talented musician.\u201cNot really,\u201d answered Lucien in a relaxed way, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be that many guests tonight though.\u201d\u201cAt least some of them will be there just because of your birthday gift for Felicia, the new serenade,\u201d Herodotus, who was usually very quiet, joined their conversation, and commented in a calm voice, \u201cThey\u2019re hoping to see what you can present a whole month after the concert.\u201d\u201cI agree with Herodotus,\u201d said Lott. \u201cAs the current host of House Hayne, Felicia\u2019s uncle should be there tonight, too. Hopefully he won\u2019t find an excuse to give Felicia and her parents a hard time.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 we\u2019ll see, then,\u201d said Lucien thoughtfully.\u2026In the early evening, Lucien got on the coach and headed toward the house where Felicia lived. This time he hired his own coach and felt a bit proud of it.By the time Lucien arrived, it was already very busy in front of the luxury three-storey house. Lots of well-dressed ladies and gentlemen were getting off their coaches, chatting and laughing.The house was originally built by the old count to host parties.Through the gate, Lucien walked on the path and went through the garden. Then he saw Felicia was standing in front of the hallway.She was welcoming the guests accompanied by her mother, wearing another bright red dress tonight. Red was House Hayne\u2019s color and the color always suited her very well.\u201cThank you for coming, Lucien,\u201d said Felicia sincerely. \u201cLots of famous musicians came here tonight because of you, including Christopher, the president of the association.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m quite sure they came because of you.\u201d Lucien smiled and kissed Felicia\u2019s hand without his lips actually touching the hand to show his politeness.\u201cWelcome, Lucien. We\u2019re all talking about you recently. You\u2019re such a genius.\u201d Felicia\u2019s mother greeted him. Felicia really looked like her mother, except for the hair, since her mother\u2019s was brown.Lucien nodded to them and entered the hall. Lots of guests were holding their cups and talking to each other. It was a perfect chance for socializing.\u201cHi, Evans.\u201d Many people greeted Lucien when he was walking. Their facial expressions varied. Some of them looked excited and curious, while some were throwing Lucien meaningful and unfriendly looks.What would the so-called most gifted and creative genius ever present tonight? Everyone was waiting for Lucien\u2019s new serenade.Among those serenades made for parties good ones seldom appeared, since their themes and styles were rather limited. Many musicians commented that these serenades were \u201cnot even close to being elegant\u201d. Thus, many of them tonight were actually expecting Lucien\u2019s failure tonight, and then they could teach this young genius a lesson.Christopher, who was surrounded by many musicians, said to the many musicians who did not have much hope in Lucien, \u201cHe\u2019s still young, and we shouldn\u2019t be too critical with those younger musicians. We shall applaud for their success, and also be more tolerant of their failure. Just leave them some space.\u201dWhen Lucien came over, the musicians ended the topic and started to talk about music creation. Lucien took a cup of water from a waiter and listened to their conversation quietly and politely, a few steps away.Several elder musicians noticed that and significantly changed their attitude toward Lucien, since clearly he was not one of those young musicians who instantly become very arrogant after making some achievement.Then Victor, Rhine, Lott and some other of Lucien\u2019s classmates arrived too.\u2026It was already seven thirty in the evening, but Count Hayne was still not there. The atmosphere started to become a bit awkward.Felicia\u2019s father, Urbain, looked every embarrassed. He was also very angry with Scott, his brother. Despite all the conflict they had in the past, Felicia is Scott\u2019s niece, and today was her eighteenth birthday. It was the current Count Hayne\u2019s responsibility to show up and send his best wishes to Felicia. Urbain was really angry with his brother.Wringing her hands, Felicia looked embarrassed to the point of almost bursting into tears. On this occasion, Count Hayne\u2019s absence definitely would do damage to her reputation among the nobles.Ten minutes later, the steward of Count Hayne finally arrived and said to Urbain in a polite but also cold manner, \u201cLord Hayne will not be able to come tonight, since he\u2019s sick.\u201dUrbain\u2019s face looked very gloomy, and he was so choked that he could not even say a single word.A few high-status nobles who were close to Count Hayne were waiting in their houses, since they were not sure if they should attend the party or not. After confirming that Count Hayne would not be there tonight, several servants who were waiting outside of the party house secretly left to report this to their masters.Fortunately, some other nobles were still coming, since Urbain was still the clerk of the town hall.Taking a deep breath, Urbain asked his daughter to stay calm and continue to welcome the guests.\u201cToo bad. If a family member is held in detestation by the host of the family, unless the member could awaken his or her Blessing and become a knight, the family member would always have a hard time in whatever they want to do.\u201d A musician named Comotz said to Lucien in a meaningful way.Lucien pretended that he did not get it, \u201cI believe no matter what a person wants to do, as long as he or she is persistent enough and works really hard, the person can be successful.\u201dHis voice was a bit loud, and it could be clearly heard since the hall was relatively quiet from the weird atmosphere.Felicia heard what Lucien just said, and the fact that Lucien made such an achievement from scratch cheered her up. As a noble lady from one of the most important families in the Duchy of Orvarit, Felicia was way more privileged than her classmate and there was no reason for her to easily give up her dream.After a while, Othello, the director of the association, came to Lucien, followed by Mekanzi Griffith and three young men.Mekanzi greeted the other musicians present and introduced the three young men to Lucien, \u201cMr. Clemen, Mr. Baret and Mr. Julian are from Tria. They\u2019ve read all the reviews of Symphony of Fate on Music Criticism and Symphony News, and they come here especially for you, Lucien.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad to meet you. Thank you so much for coming.\u201d Lucien shook hands with them one by one. The three young musicians from Tria were all in their early twenties. Dressing tastefully, they were all very decent young men.\u201cYour teacher, Francois, had already introduced all of you to me through a letter he wrote.\u201d Christopher recalled their names, \u201cI\u2019ve listened to your music works before. All of you are very talented.\u201dFrancois was born in the Kingdom of Syracuse. When he was a teenager, Francois came to Aalto to study music and then achieved great success in music in his late twenties. A few years ago, Francois went back to Syracuse and became the prime music consultant for the royal family.The three young musicians hurriedly saluted Christopher, who was known as the \u201cliving music legend\u201d, with great respect.Mekanzi said to Lucien with malicious intention, \u201cI hope your serenade surprises everyone here tonight, genius!\u201d\u201cA serenade? I have a piece of serenade for miss Hayne tonight, too!\u201d The black-haired Julian was the most talented and also the most arrogant one among the three, \u201cWe can present our serenades together.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMekanzi seemed to be relatively acquainted with Julian.When Lucien was about to answer, the whole hall suddenly quieted down. The sword \u201cAlert\u201d Lucien was wearing reminded him that someone he knew was coming.Lucien turned around and saw a luxury coach stopping in front of the steps on the other end.A tall, purple-haired beauty in her white uniform and black long boots was walking toward Felicia, with a pretty young lady walking with her arm in arm, while Camil was quietly following behind.\u201cYour Grace?!\u201d Felicia exclaimed with great surprise.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Happy birthday!\u201d Standing in front of Felicia, Natasha smiled, \u201cSorry that I came without being invited.\u201d\u201cNo, no\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s my great pleasure, Your Grace.\u201d Felicia was almost too excited to speak properly, \u201cI really wanted to invite you, Your Grace. But I\u2019m not qualified\u2026 I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d\u201cI know, I know\u2026\u201d Natasha gently touched Felicia\u2019s hair and comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t call me \u2018Your Grace\u2019. Just call me Natasha like many years ago when we were playing together in the manor. I remember that back in the days when the old count was still alive, we always went hunting with uncle Samuel, Alfred and Harrington.\u201d\u201cI was so short and always fell over.\u201d All those memories came back to Felicia, \u201cI cried a lot.\u201d\u201cYes, you did. And ten years later, you\u2019re turning eighteen.\u201d Natasha\u2019s heart was also softened by those memories, \u201cAlfred and uncle Samuel must be very happy in heaven seeing you become such a gorgeous noble lady.\u201dAlfred was the eldest son of the grand duke, Natasha\u2019s elder brother, who was also a level five grand knight in his early twenties. Samuel was the elder brother of the current Count Hayne and Urbain Hayne, who was the first heir of House Hayne\u2019s title. Both of them died in the battle with the heretic knights almost ten years ago.Ten years changed a lot. Felicia\u2019s father did not manage to inherit the title and Natasha turned from a little girl into a real warrior after her elder brother died. All the friends back in the old days gradually drifted away from each other, and those beautiful days would never come back again.Before the princess arrived, Felicia was forcing herself to smile in order to welcome the guests and keep the party going, although she was facing great disappointment and anger. Now, different emotions mixed together in her mind and she could not hold her tears back anymore, \u201cI\u2019m so happy you\u2019re here tonight, Natasha.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Felicia.\u201d Natasha gave Felicia a big warm hug, \u201cYou\u2019re my younger sister. As Count Hayne is sick tonight, I\u2019ll host your coming-of-age ceremony tonight.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d Felicia sniffed and put on a smile, \u201cI\u2019m so honored that the princess is going to host my ceremony.\u201dNatasha also had tears in her eyes but she was trying to cheer Felicia up, \u201cAnd my personal music consultant is gonna present you with a beautiful piece of serenade.\u201dIn her mind, Natasha was blaming Lucien for tempting her to attend the party tonight with his new serenade. As a grand knight, she did not expect that she would cry when she saw Felicia and that made her feel very shy.Natasha and Lucien were getting more and more like friends after what happened with the heresy.Mentioned by the princess, Lucien suddenly captured a lot of attention from the nobles and musicians present. Now all of the guests were expecting Lucien\u2019s serenade tonight.\u201cWelcome, Your Grace. Welcome, lady Camil, lady Silvia.\u201d Urbain was also excited and led the princess into the hall.All the nobles and musicians were saluting the princess. Natasha was fed up with all the noble manners but was still smiling and nodding politely toward them. Silvia, while holding the princess\u2019s arm, was very nervous and her face flushed, since it was her first time showing up in public with Natasha like this, facing lots of musicians she knew.\u201cMr. Christopher, good evening,\u201d Silvia greeted her teacher.Looking at his student coming together with the princess, Christopher paused a bit as if he wanted to say something but he stopped himself. He just simply said, \u201cGood evening, Silvia. There\u2019re several musicians here tonight, and I know you\u2019re very interested in this new music instrument.\u201dNatasha had previously told Lucien that Silvia was interested in his new fingerings, but also that she might be too shy to talk to him, so Lucien took the initiative to talk to her. Silvia was encouraged and started to share her understanding of piano with Lucien.The three musicians coming from Tria were completely ignored. They were a bit pissed off but there was not much they could do. After all, no one really knew them in Aalto.However, their angry faces amused Mekanzi, standing on the other side.\u2026When they heard that the princess went to the party tonight, many nobles rushed to come. Thus, the ceremony was put off for half an hour.The coming-of-age ceremony was not complicated. Taking a flame-like flower and the badge of House Hayne from Felicia\u2019s mother, Natasha put them on the left side of Felicia\u2019s chest and delivered a short speech.Then Natasha invited Felicia for an opening dance, which was the last part of the ceremony.The dance was just gorgeous. As a level five grand knight, Natasha was excellent in strength, agility and coordination. Led by the princess, Felicia presented the best dance in her life so far.Then it should be Lucien\u2019s turn to present his new serenade for Felicia. However, at this time, Julian came to the center of the hall.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYour Grace, Distinguished guests, I\u2019m Julian from the palace of Tria. I\u2019m sorry that I just came here tonight with Mr. Griffith without lady Felicia\u2019s invitation. Here I want to present lady Felicia with a piece of my newly-written serenade, in order to bring all my best wishes.\u201d\u201cIt seems like our talented young musician is having an unexpected challenger here.\u201d Natasha lifted her eyebrows and said to Lucien in a low voice.Lucien shrugged his shoulders a bit. He did not really care.Natasha nodded, \u201cWell. Then let\u2019s welcome Julian from Tria.\u201dHanding his sheets of music to the band, Julian was waiting for them to get prepared. Julian was quite excited since the music genre of serenade was Tria\u2019s forte.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As there were many nobles who were fond of chasing different music trends, the style of serenade also changed over time, and was played more and more often over evening parties.In Aalto, the City of Psalm, serenade was never really mainstream, instead, symphony and concerto were more popular as they were always regarded as \u201cmore solemn and elegant\u201d.When they were talking about piano fingerings, Silvia smiled to her teacher and said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen Mr. Julian\u2019s serenade in your office before, and indeed it\u2019s very suitable for playing on evening parties.\u201dChristopher immediately understood the intention of her words. He shook his head and smiled.Several of the famous musicians present like Othello and Victor smiled with the president as well. What Silvia was actually saying was that Julian\u2019s work was to some extent too shallow to be presented on formal occasions.On the other hand, Baret and Clemen, the two musicians who were visiting Aalto for the first time, were not quite sure about the connotation of Silvia\u2019s words.Lucien did not realize the meaning of Silvia\u2019s comment until he saw the other musicians\u2019 meaningful smile. Maybe it was Lucien\u2019s friendly attitude that won Silvia\u2019s preference for him over Julian.At that time, Julian picked up his violin and his playing started.The beginning of his serenade surprised many of the traditional musicians present, including Christopher, Othello and Victor. Julian recomposed his music work and made it relatively solemn and serious.An interested smile emerged on Natasha\u2019s face. She has always loved surprises. Silvia, standing beside her, looked more confused than surprised.Julian was indeed a genius. The combination of the pleasant features of serenade and the solemnity of orchestra in his music work impressed every musician present at the party.During the second movement of Julian\u2019s serenade, even the president Christopher smiled and praised, \u201cThis part is challenging but Julian handled it very well.\u201dClemen and Baret gave Julian an admiring glance, since a good comment from the president of the musicians\u2019 association of Aalto meant a lot for a young musician.The gentle and elegant lento was followed by a more cheerful allegro, designed for the evening party. The playing ended in a pleasant and high-spirited atmosphere.Warm applause came to Julian. Felicia, as the host of the coming-of-age ceremony and the evening party, thanked Julian, \u201cI appreciate your gift a lot, Mr. Julian. It\u2019s very impressive as a piece of serenade.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my great pleasure playing for you, Miss Hayne.\u201d Julian kissed Felicia\u2019s hand and bowed to her, \u201cMay your beauty and happiness always be with you.\u201dThen he left the dancing floor and rejoined the musicians with a big smile on his face, knowing that the piece of serenade which took him more than five months to accomplish was acknowledged by the many musicians in Aalto.Although the playing was not perfect because of the lack of practicing of the band, Julian still achieved success.\u201cAwesome, elegant, passionate! No one can compete with you in the field of serenade.\u201d While Mekanzi was complimenting Julian, his eyes were peeking at Lucien.However, Lucien did not care. Lucien never regarded himself as a real musician.Othello, as the director of the association, also extended his congratulation.After Othello, Silvia expressed her different opinion with a gentle smile, \u201cImpressive as it is, the pace of the serenade in general is a bit sluggish and the structure is not well-designed.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Julian felt a bit embarrassed, \u201cWhat you just said\u2026 The problems you just mentioned are relatively inevitable for a serenade, aren\u2019t they?\u201dChristopher was a bit surprised that his student, who was always nice and gentle, was this aggressive and sharp tonight. Thus, he took a step forward and took over the conversation, \u201cAnyway, this is a piece of serenade with outstanding quality.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201d Julian\u2019s big smile came back again. He could already see the prosperous future that awaited him as a very famous musician in Aalto.Then suddenly he turned around and said to Lucien in an arrogant intonation, \u201cNow, it\u2019s your turn, Mr. Evans.\u201dAt this time, Felicia\u2019s mother said to all the guests, \u201cThank you, Mr. Julian. Thank you for your passionate playing. In this beautiful evening, Mr. Lucien Evans, as my daughter\u2019s music classmate, will also present us a piece of bagatelle as well!\u201dLucien\u2019s name caused a stir in the crowd.\u201cYes, \u2018the\u2019 Mr. Lucien Evans. The young talented musician who composed Symphony of Fate!\u201d Felicia\u2019s mother introduced with pride.Lucien tidied his clothes a bit and was about to walk to the center of the hall, when Mekanzi said to him in an ill-intentioned way, \u201cHope you don\u2019t press the wrong key, Lucien.\u201dNatasha took a glance at Mekanzi and lifted her eyebrows, and then looked at Lucien. She had confidence in Lucien since she had seen Lucien playing piano several times after he awoke his Blessing, and his playing skill had improved a lot.\u201cDon\u2019t let Natasha down,\u201d Silvia said to Lucien in a low voice, \u201cYou\u2019re Natasha\u2019s musician consultant.\u201dLucien was not bothered by Mekanzi. He nodded to Natasha, Silvia and his teacher Mr. Victor, and then walked toward the center of the hall where a piano was placed. Victor raised his glass toward his student as his encouragement.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFelicia was a bit nervous, since she was not sure whether playing a piece of bagatelle tonight was a good idea. Now in comparison to Julian\u2019s serenade, any flaw in Lucien\u2019s playing might be exaggerated.The applause to welcome Lucien gradually stopped. Many musicians and nobles were waiting.The first movement was an Allegro, pleasant, graceful and brief. And it captured everyone\u2019s attention immediately with a very cheerful sonata-allegro form.Julian\u2019s smile froze on his face. As a musician, he instantly realized the gap existing between his serenade and Lucien\u2019s work. Excellent as his work was, this young Aalto musician\u2019s serenade could be called classical.What Lucien was playing was Amadeus Mozart\u2019s Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After listening to the first two bars, she instantly knew that this piece of bagatelle would not let her down.Subconsciously relaxing her hands, all of Felicia\u2019s concerns disappeared and her eyes started to shine with excitement. That was the most fabulous serenade she had even heard, even though it was just part of the whole work.Pleasant and cheerful, gentle and elegant, a few guests at the party nodded slightly following the rhythm while beating time to the music. They wanted to dance. Smiles appeared on their faces.Lucien\u2019s long and beautiful hands were moving on the keyboard in a smooth and free manner. His fingers, wrists, arms and even his body were working cooperatively to present this perfect piece of piano bagatelle.Besides the melody itself, Lucien\u2019s manner of playing was also a feast for the guests\u2019 eyes.Many young nobles, while enjoying the music, were longing for learning piano and Lucien\u2019s new fingerings. Many noble ladies were staring at Lucien in great admiration.\u201cWhat a decent, elegant and talented gentleman!\u201d The girls were wondering about how much a piano playing could show one\u2019s artistic elegance.Several minutes later, Lucien pressed down the last key of the piano bagatelle. His right hand was raised in a d\u00e9gag\u00e9 way to show the end of his playing.Then he stood up, bowed to Natasha, then Felicia and the guests present.Lucien\u2019s listeners paused a bit, as if they needed some time to recover from the great surprise and excitement. A couple of seconds later, Lucien was surrounded by the thunder of applause from the guests.\u201cBeautiful, graceful and balanced. I\u2019m proud of you, Lucien!\u201d commented Natasha, \u201cFinish the following movements and turn this amazing piece of bagatelle into a serenade masterpiece.\u201dFelicia\u2019s face flushed with excitement, \u201cLucien, thank you so much for the gift. I think my coming-of-age ceremony will be recorded in the history of music because of your serenade.\u201dLucien gently hugged Felicia, giving her an encouraging pat on the shoulder.Then he went back and rejoined the musicians.\u201cLucien, you\u2019re indeed a genius. This piano bagatelle is the most beautiful serenade I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Christopher smiled and his eyes were shining with praise.\u201cNo one can doubt your talent anymore, Lucien.\u201d Silvia nodded. She was very impressed with the movement of Lucien\u2019s fingers, wrists and arms when he was playing, and with the elegance of this new musical instrument, piano. In her mind, the piano was no inferior to the violin, the queen of all the musical instruments.As Lucien\u2019s teacher, Victor was very proud, \u201cI believe that this piece of serenade will become the most popular music work for parties and feasts, even more popular than Symphony of Fate.\u201d Then, Victor paused a bit before continuing, \u201cWhat I appreciate the most is that you employed many challenging playing skills in the bagatelle. After all, beautiful as a serenade is, it cannot be the mainstream of music in Aalto.\u201dLucien nodded with mixed feelings. He always appreciated all the help that Victor provided him, but he also knew that his future might not have anything to do with music, since the path that he chose was magic. After he got to know where the Continental Congress of Magic was from Rhine, he would leave Aalto very soon. Lucien did not want to let Victor down.While most of the musicians present were marveling at Lucien\u2019s extraordinary talent, Mekanzi looked very resentful. He took a glance at the very disappointed Julian and then he stepped forward as if something hit him all of a sudden.Mekanzi pointed at Lucian and said in a loud voice in front of the guests, \u201cThere\u2019s no way that a beginner can compose something like this! You, so despicable, you made a pact with the devil!\u201dAll of the guests were shocked. They turned around and looked at Mekanzi as if he was insane. It was a very, very serious accusation against Lucien. In other words, Mekanzi wanted Lucien to die.\u201cMind your words, Mekanzi!\u201d Victor looked angry and serious, \u201cTalented as Lucien is, he still works very hard.\u201d He was the first person speaking out for Lucien, while Lott and Herodotus remained silent. Facing an accusation involving a deal with the devil, even nobles didn\u2019t easily dare to defend their classmate.\u201cYou\u2019re Lucien\u2019s teacher. Of course you speak for him.\u201d Mekanzi looked around at the guests, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, do you really believe that a pauper who just started to learn music several months ago can achieve such a level?\u201dThe guests started to whisper to each other. Indeed, the fact that, within only a few months\u2019 learning of music, a poor, young man was already capable of holding his own concert was definitely very surprising.\u201cYou betrayed the God of truth,\u201d said Mekanzi in a vicious way.Everyone was looking at Lucien now. When he was about to say something, Natasha said to Mekanzi in a slow but authoritative way,\u201cI know you want to put Lucien onto burning gallows very much, Mekanzi.\u201d There was a slight of smile on Natasha\u2019s beautiful face, \u201cHowever, Mekanzi, Lucien\u2019s my personal music consultant. You think I\u2019m that stupid to have someone who made a deal with the devil to serve me?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 No, I\u2019m not saying that, Your Grace.\u201d Mekanzi was flustered by the princess\u2019s words.\u201cThen what do you mean?\u201d asked Natasha sternly.\u201cI\u2026 I mean\u2026 It\u2019s not normal for\u2026\u201d stammered Mekanzi.Natasha cut him off right away, \u201cThat\u2019s why we call him a genius. Lucien received rewards from my family, and that\u2019s also why he made such a progress. You have anything to say about that?\u201dMekanzi\u2019s face was as red as a tomato. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but finally he released a long sigh like a deflated ball, \u201cOf course you\u2019re right, Your Grace. I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m overreacting.\u201dThen, Mekanzi found an excuse and left the party, followed by the frustrated Baret and Clemen, while Julian cheered himself up and said to Christopher sincerely, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was being so arrogant. I want to stay in Aalto for several years to learn from the great musicians\u2026 Aalto is the paradise for musicians.\u201d\u201cWelcome, Julian.\u201d Christopher nodded to him, \u201cWe need fresh blood for our association, and we learn from each other.\u201dJulian picked up a glass of wine and turned around to face Lucien, \u201cI gotta admit that your serenade is better than mine. I\u2019ll learn from you, and one day I\u2019ll catch up with you.\u201d\u201cThen I wish you success.\u201d Lucien slightly raised his glass of water.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe music for the party started again. Instantly, Lucien was surrounded by a bunch of noble ladies.\u201cMr. Evans, can I have a dance with you?\u201d\u201cMr. Evans, you were so charming when you were playing the piano!\u201d\u201cCan you take a look at my hands to see if I\u2019m suitable for playing piano?\u201dThe mix of sweet perfumes dizzied Lucien. Luckily, at that moment Felicia came over and saved Lucian by having a minuet with him, after which he went to the patio to stay away from the ladies.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Standing on the patio and bathing the bright moonlight, Lucien felt revitalized.However, at that time, Lucien realized that he was being rude since he saw that two beautiful ladies were on the patio as well, snuggling and kissing. The arousing scene of the two beauties showing their love toward each other in the moonlight was like a fabulous painting.Lucien\u2019s face twitched a bit and then blushed. When he was about to leave the patio, one of them stopped him and asked, \u201cLucien, what\u2019s that look on your face?\u201d It was Natasha.With a slight redness on her cheeks, Silvia was hiding behind Natasha, slightly gasping from the intense kissing.\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026 fine.\u201d Lucien smiled in an embarrassed way.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on in your mind?\u201d Natasha slightly lifted her eyebrows and questioned Lucien closely.\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m thinking that\u2026 what I just saw was not good for my eyes,\u201d said Lucien in a playful way.\u201cUmm\u2026\u201d Natasha pointed at herself and then at Silvia, \u201cAren\u2019t we beautiful?\u201d\u201cSure, both of you are real beauties.\u201d Having never been with any girl before, Lucien made fun of himself, \u201cLet me put it this way. What I just saw hurt my heart.\u201dNatasha laughed and stretched herself a bit, \u201cI like your personality, Lucien. You\u2019re interesting enough to be my friend.\u201dThen she said something to Silvia in a low voice, which made Silvia giggle.\u201cExcuse me, I need to have some water.\u201d Silvia then said to Lucien and left the patio.After Silvia left, Natasha asked Lucien to follow her back to the party. When they were on the dance floor, Natasha turned around, bowed to Lucien and reached out her right hand, \u201cMay I have a dance with you?\u201dLucien looked at her hand and paused a bit, \u201cYour Grace, I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s not a proper invitation.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Natasha looked surprised. When she realized what was wrong, she took back her right hand and stood straight, waiting for Lucien\u2019s invitation, \u201cSorry, my bad. I forgot you\u2019re the gentleman and I\u2019m the lady. I\u2019m used to\u2026 you know what I mean.\u201dLucien nodded and smiled, \u201cYes, I know.\u201dRecalling the dancing manner, Lucien reached out his right hand to the princess, \u201cYour Grace, may I have the honor to dance with you?\u201d\u201cSure, you\u2019re my music consultant.\u201d Natasha laid her hand on Lucien\u2019s palm and followed Lucien to the center of the dance floor.The dance between a decent gentleman and a beautiful young lady should be very pleasant. Unfortunately, their dance wasn\u2019t exactly like that.\u201cYou stepped on my foot, Lucien!\u201d said Natasha.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace,\u201d Lucien apologized. \u201cBut have you figured why? You\u2019re dancing in the manner of man.\u201d\u201cAm I? Um\u2026\u201d\u201cYour Grace, you just stepped on my foot.\u201d\u201cSorry Lucien. Why don\u2019t you dance in the lady\u2019s way, then? That would solve all the problems,\u201d Natasha suggested.\u201cI\u2019d rather keep letting you step on me.\u201d Lucien shook his head.It took them a while to become cooperative. Natasha asked, \u201cLucien? Can I ask you to do me a favor?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Lucien.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d A rare shy look appeared on Natasha\u2019s face, \u201cSilvia likes your serenade a lot, and she wants me to play a piece of love-themed serenade for her birthday before the new year.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s sweet.\u201d Lucien did not understand how he would be useful to Natasha yet.\u201cBut you know I\u2019m not really a serenade person\u2026\u201d said Natasha, \u201cI like music which is intense and passionate, not soft and gentle. I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d\u201cSo, Your Grace, you want me to compose the serenade for you?\u201d Lucien asked.\u201cUmm\u2026 sort of\u2026\u201d Natasha looked a bit embarrassed but soon made up her mind, \u201cYes, can you do me that favor?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t think a decent knight like Your Grace would find a ghostwriter for herself.\u201d Lucien blinked in a funny way.\u201cYou\u2019re not my ghostwriter! I just don\u2019t want to present Silvia with a piece of mediocre work on her birthday.\u201d Natasha was trying to justify it, \u201cI\u2019ll tell Silvia that it\u2019s your work\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Your Grace.\u201d Lucien grinned, \u201cI was just joking. I would be honored if I could help you solve that problem, Your Grace.\u201dNatasha nodded, \u201cAwesome. Thank you, Lucien. I\u2019ll at least try to work on it as well, and your work will be my second plan.\u201d\u201cThe name of the serenade will be \u2018For Silvia\u2019, then.\u201d Lucien paused a few seconds and looked a bit worried, \u201cSince I haven\u2019t gone through any love experience yet, I may need some extra help.\u201d\u201cSuch as\u2026?\u201d Natasha leaned forward a bit.\u201cI noticed that you have lots of books in your study, Your Grace.\u201d Lucien had been coveting the great number of books in Natasha\u2019s study for a long time, and he would not let this precious chance slip away, \u201cI wonder if I can have the chance to read some of them, say, those love stories books and some books that introduce histories, cultures and traditions of other countries, in order to be inspired. The library of the association has only music books.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Natasha smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal at all. As many of the old books are actually written in the language used by the ancient Sylvanas Magic Empire, I can ask the scholars to translate them for you.\u201d\u201cThat would be great.\u201d Although Lucien looked pretty calm, his heart was full of excitement. He did not expect that one of his biggest problems could just be solved like that. By copying the many books from the ancient Sylvanas Magic Empire, Lucien could not only better plan his future trip on the continent, but also learn how to read ancient Sylvanas characters.Although many books of college level were still sealed in Lucien\u2019s spirit library, he was already way more knowledgable than a common sorcerer. Had it not been for the insufficiency of his spiritual power, Lucien should had already become a first circle sorcerer, which was exactly the opposite situation for the other sorcerer apprentices. Most of them were having a hard time moving forward because they did not have enough knowledge to analyze more complicated spells.\u201cLucien, you stepped on me again!\u201d complained Natasha.When the dance ended, Natasha asked Lucien, \u201cDo you have any other plans recently, aside from composing the canon and finishing the bagatelle? I don\u2019t want to interrupt your schedule.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Not really. Composing serenade can help me relax. Actually, I\u2019m considering composing a piece of sonata to record the perseverance and the great faith that supported me all along when uncle Joel and his family were held as hostages,\u201d answered Lucien. All he wanted to do now was to come up with new music works and hold his own concert.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d Natasha looked at him seriously, \u201cI know you\u2019re good at this theme. And I\u2019ll have the scholars translate the books for you starting from tomorrow.\u201dAfter the dance, Lucien was about to get some water when he met Rhine, who was holding a glass of wine in a very elegant way.\u201cGood work!\u201d Then Rhine whispered to Lucien, \u201cI almost forgot to tell you that I already helped you get rid of your basement. No worries anymore.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lucien was very surprised. He never expected that Rhine knew this much about him. He was also glad that he did not have to worry about his underground lab anymore, which had been a burden on his heart for a long time since he just could not find a proper chance to destroy it.\u201cI know you want to thank me, and you\u2019re welcome,\u201d Rhine said to Lucien, smiling, \u201cI mean no harm toward you. I hope you can trust me.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBut why\u2026 Mr. Rhine?\u201d asked Lucien. After all, the whole thing had nothing to do with Rhine at all.\u201cThere\u2019s no why.\u201d Rhine shrugged casually, \u201cMaybe I just want to see a great musician making progress without being distracted by something trivial.\u201dThen, Rhine raised his glass toward Lucien with a meaningful smile and left.The party tonight was perfect because of Lucien\u2019s serenade. Thus, Felicia exempted the debt that Lucien owned her to show her family\u2019s appreciation.At a cost of ten Thales, Felicia made a great deal with Lucien!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were hoping that they could become your piano students. Miss Felicia\u2019s friend, Yvette, was here as well.\u201dThen, she handed a pile of letters to Lucien, \u201cThese are all feedbacks from musicians who live nearby.\u201dLucien took the letters and was about to walk upstairs, but paused a bit and turned to Elena instead, \u201cCan you tell the ladies that this year I won\u2019t accept any students? Apart from being the princess\u2019 music consultant, I still have to work on producing more music.\u201d\u201cMr. Lucien, how come you\u2019re always that inspired?\u201d Cathy\u2019s eyes were wide open and she asked with great curiosity, \u201cI heard that, aside from the serenade, you also finished recomposing Mr. Hersey\u2019s Canon in D.\u201dLucien nodded, \u201cI\u2019m just hoping that I can hold my own concert as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201d exclaimed Elena and Cathy at the same time.Then, Elena asked Lucien with expectancy, \u201cI understand that you don\u2019t want to have any student right now\u2026 but can I ask you some questions related to music once in a while?\u201d\u201cOf course, we can exchange our ideas,\u201d said Lucien. The true reason that Lucien refused to have any student was that, as a sorcerer, he might be found out by the church someday and his students would be in great trouble.After giving Joseph the music sheet of his serenade for registration, from the window Lucien saw that a purple coach was arriving, which was sent by Natasha.\u2026In the study of War Gallery.Natasha, wearing a long black dress, was introducing the books to Lucien, \u201cSome of them are written in common tongue. I take it that you want to start to read them as soon as possible.\u201dThat was Natasha, passionate, decisive and motivated. As soon as she decided to do something, she wanted to get it done as fast as she could.From her introduction, Lucien had a rough idea about the different book sections in the princess\u2019 study. At that moment, a middle-aged man came in and bowed to Natasha, \u201cYour Grace.\u201dTurning around, Natasha nodded to the man and then said to Lucien, \u201cMr. Bake, from House Hill, is a very reputable scholar and linguist. He is your designated consultant and translator for these books.\u201dBake was already bald in his forties. A thick pair of glasses was sitting on his round face.\u201cThank you, Mr. Bake,\u201d said Lucien.\u201cIt\u2019s my great pleasure to serve the princess and to be your consultant, Mr. Evans,\u201d Bake bowed slightly to Lucien.\u201cYou\u2019re working on translating the books already, Mr. Bake?\u201d Lucien noticed that there was a thick book under Bake\u2019s arm with many small colorful tags among the pages.\u201cYes\u2026 as you may see, Mr. Evans, translating these books takes time, and the princess told me about your hunger for knowledge. I\u2019m hoping that I can cover as many books as possible in this study for you, Mr. Evans,\u201d answered Bake slowly.\u201cThat\u2019s very nice of you, Mr. Bake.\u201d Lucien was grateful, \u201cAnd thank you, Your Grace.\u201d Lucien smiled to Natasha.\u201cIt\u2019s very sweet to see that, young as you are, Mr. Evans, you\u2019re this interested in the ancient language and culture of Sylvanas Magic Empire. You\u2019ll see that their culture was fascinating.\u201d Bake walked toward the desk and opened the black book in front of Lucien, \u201cThe book that I\u2019m working on right now is Heroes\u2019 Epic, very beautiful poems\u2026\u201d Bake became a bit excited.\u201cWhat is this book about?\u201d asked Lucien, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not really well-educated with in history.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s totally fine.\u201d Bake smiled. \u201cThe beauty of poem does not require its reader to have much educational background. Instead, it\u2019s something you can feel. Get closer and take a look, Mr. Evans.\u201dLucien\u2019s long fingers gently ran down the spine of the thick, black book, feeling its antiquity.When Lucien was flipping through the pages, Bake said to him, \u201cThe poems in the book were written in memory of those great heroes who followed the lead of the God of truth and together overthrew the rule of the vicious mages.\u201d\u201cFascinating.\u201d Lucien quickly went through all the pages, and then in his spirit library the copy of the book emerged on one of the bookshelves in the \u201cAncient Literature\u201d entry.Then, Lucien turned to Natasha, \u201cHave you read these books before, Your Grace? Do you have any book that has already been translated?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve learned Sylvanas in the noble abbey before. I don\u2019t need translation,\u201d answered Natasha casually. \u201cI\u2019m going to the practicing room now. If I have any question I\u2019ll come back for you. Enjoy your reading, Lucien.\u201dAfter Natasha left, Lucien directly jumped onto the books and started to read them assiduously.\u2026In the following month, Lucien gradually gained a new perspective toward the continent and even this whole world from the effort he put on reading.In order to gain great power and break the limit of the human body, lots of sorcerers and sorceresses in the past operated countless cruel experiments on human beings by infusing them with the different powers extracted from magic creatures. Most of the subjects died, but the ones who made it gained tremendous power.Surprisingly, yet undoubtedly reasonable, following the lead of those surviving experiment subjects, people from different parts of the continent who were fed up with being bullied launched uprisings against the empire.At the same time, the Saint Truth, with its many years of secret development, quickly gained its momentum and became the shared belief for those people. That was when the great powers derived from the magic creatures started to be called \u201cBlessings\u201d and the Saint Calendar started to count, followed by the epic war called \u201cthe War of Dawn\u201d, which lasted for over four hundred years.Because Lucien was reading the translated versions of the books, all the texts were shedding glory light on the people fighting against the empire while depicting the sorcerers and sorceresses as terrifying representatives of the darkness and the devil.At that time, Natasha\u2019s family, House Violet, was guarding the remote west territory of Holy Heilz Empire with the great power of the Violet Knights. In the end of the War of Dawn, House Violet provided the Church with great help and became the biggest contributor to the success of taking down Aalto. The host of House Violet was thus granted the title of the grand duke of Aalto and became independent from Holy Heilz Empire.In the year 425 of Saint Calendar, the church held one of the most significant synods in history, discussing the topics related to the final stage of the war and the further attack toward the fiend empires across the Dark Mountain Range in the west. However, during that meeting, a great, carefully premeditated divergence over the reading of the doctrine bursted out between some of the grand cardinals and the pope.Since then the Church was divided into two. Supported by Schachran Empire and the other duchies, the grand cardinals betrayed the pope and set up a separatist regime in the north. The westward march of the Church\u2019s army was thus stopped.Lucien realized that the topic of heresy in this world was way more complicated than he thought.Knowing that the Sword Brothers were stationed on the border between the Duchy of Orvarit and Schachran Empire, Lucien asked Natasha why the Church never started to march westward again. Her answer was very obscure but meaningful, \u201cIn most believers\u2019 eyes, the enemy within concerns us more than external threats. Today, no one except the pope knows why those cardinals betrayed us.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLucien also read from the books that the the frontline against the heresy was formed by the north provinces of the Duchy of Orvarit, the Kingdom of Syracuse and Holy Heilz Empire. Among the total of 60 kingdoms, duchies, empires and territories on the continent, most of them retained their glory through the years. However, in some, like the Gusta Empire to the far south, the royal family had lost their control over the empire, since the several preeminent noble families in Gusta seized a major part of the political and economical power.Besides, there was a continental sea in the center of the continent, which was called Storm Sea. Natasha\u2019s mom was the princess from the kingdom across the Storm Strait, although very little reference could be found about that kingdom.\u2026Two weeks before the new year, sitting in front of the fireplace, Lucien was reading Astrology and Magic Elements.After the great amount of reading, now Lucien could already understand the most commonly used characters in Sylvanas.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
