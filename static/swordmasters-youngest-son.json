    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 \u2013 Runcandel\u2019s SuperstitionWaaah, uwaaah.\u2018Is it normal to hear a baby\u2019s cries as you die\u2026?\u2019Jin thought to himself.Was he having auditory hallucinations from the blood loss? Or was the neighbor\u2019s child crying from the 9-star knights\u2019 attack?If it were the latter, then it was unfortunate. The Akin Kingdom would fall today, so there was no way a newborn could survive the destruction.\u2018I\u2019d love to save it, but I\u2019m in no condition to help others. My body was cut in half. I hope I\u2019ll be reborn in a blissful world instead of a miserable one.\u2019Waaaaaaah!The wail was getting louder and louder. It wouldn\u2019t surprise him if the baby died of asphyxiation from crying at the top of its lungs.\u2018What a pathetic death. I couldn\u2019t even save a baby in front of me.\u2019His vision was filled with darkness.There was no sign of the baby stopping. As he endured the shame and listened helplessly, Jin wondered why he wasn\u2019t dead yet.Not only had he received countless fatal wounds, his body had been sliced in two at the waist. There was no way he could\u2019ve survived for another 10 seconds. Nonetheless, the wailing never stopped\u2026\u2018Wait, the sound is coming from my body!\u2019He couldn\u2019t understand what was happening.Jin was the one letting out those cries.Today was September 9th, 1780.The youngest son of the clan of swordmasters, Jin Runcandel, was born.***100 days have passed since his rebirth.Jin could now skillfully crawl around, and he had no choice but to accept the truth unfolding before him.He had been reborn after his death. There was no other explanation. And there was no way he could explain it to others, as he could barely form any words.\u2018And even if I tell people after I become 5 years old, no one would believe that I have 28 years\u2019 worth of memories in my head.\u2019They would just dismiss it as a child\u2019s joke or delusion.If he were to mention the detailed history or secrets of the family, then some people could potentially believe him. However, the chances of him being treated as a cursed child were extremely high.Therefore, Jin was once again destined to live as the youngest son of the dreadful Runcandel Clan.The youngest child of the Runcandel Clan!It was an incredible privilege.Most people living in the world would consider being born as the Runcandels\u2019 youngest an extraordinary blessing.However, Jin was at a loss.\u2018I would\u2019ve preferred being reborn in an ordinary family.\u2019In that scenario, it wouldn\u2019t have taken him 100 days to accept the truth about his situation.He was reborn in the same family, as the same child, on the same day as his past life. In other words, he was most likely gifted with the same talents as his previous life.Swordsmanship and magic.However, the Runcandels hated magic. The Zipfel Clan, the clan of magicians, was the Runcandel\u2019s greatest enemy.\u2018The youngest child of the Runcandel again. I wonder if the curse that Solderet dispelled is still on me. How should I run away from this family and learn magic this time?\u2019There was no way he could learn magic without leaving the Runcandel House.If the curse that Solderet had dispelled was affecting him again, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to learn swordsmanship either.As he pondered deeply, Jin\u2019s eyes slowly began to shut.His body couldn\u2019t obey his mind and resist its natural needs. And so, he fell into a deep sleep.***1 year has passed since his rebirth.Time was trickling slowly, one day at a time.Jin was sick of coming up with plans for the future now. His body could never resist the temptation of a snooze, and he was bored to death of living as an inarticulate baby.\u2018I want to grow up faster! This is so frustrating! I can\u2019t do anything as I am right now!\u2019All he could do was drink milk from a bottle and fall asleep when the time came. And whenever he relieved himself in his diapers, Gilly, his nanny, would come replace them. It was an extremely shameful experience for Jin, who had the mind of an adult man.That was all his daily schedule had entailed during the entire year.Step, step.A certain woman entered Jin\u2019s room. She was the mistress of the house, Rosa Runcandel.She had ebony hair and a sharp gaze decorating her straight, pointy nose. Despite her alluring charm, she appeared quite shrewd and overpowering, which earned her the nickname \u2018Black Panther\u2019 from others.\u201cAre the preparations over, Gilly?\u201d\u201cOf course, ma\u2019am. Today\u2019s the day the young master \u2018selects\u2019, so I\u2019ve paid special attention to everything.\u201d\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s go immediately.\u201dJin realized that today was his birthday from their conversation.The children of the Runcandel family go through a certain ritual called \u2018Selection\u2019 on their first birthday.It was a ritual where the adults laid around dozens of items on the floor, and made the baby crawl towards one of them and grab the item.There was a superstition that when the child \u2018selected\u2019 an item, the item would be a representation of the child\u2019s future and destiny. Strangely enough, the Runcandels were obsessed with this superstition.Rosa picked up Jin and moved to the castle\u2019s central hall.At the hall\u2019s center stood a man, arms crossed.He was Jin\u2019s father, the strongest knight of the present era, Cyron Runcandel.\u2018Father.\u2019It was Jin\u2019s first time seeing his father after his rebirth. Having reached the demigod realm, Cyron was very rarely present at the castle.He was always away fighting wars or training in some remote location.\u2018And my siblings\u2026\u2019His 12 siblings were also present.While they had treated Jin like a weakling and a useless insect in his past life, they hadn\u2019t committed such acts as of yet. They were all waiting for Jin with wide smiles on their faces.As he remembered the suffering he had gone through because of them, his chest began to feel stuffy.\u201cRosa, put Jin down.\u201dHis mother followed his father\u2019s instructions. As his limbs reached the cold marble floor, a slight shiver shook his body.Two meters away from him lay the items for the Selection ritual.He could see a book, two coins, a single grain of rice, along with over twenty different types of swords impaling the hall floor.Jin just had to choose one item among all these.\u2018This is crazy. I couldn\u2019t remember the ritual from my past life because I was too young back then, but now that I see it in person, it\u2019s insane. Do they actually plan on making a baby crawl through countless swords and grab one by the blade?\u2019In his past life, Jin had selected a sword. Since the book, coins and grain of rice were hidden amongst the countless swords, it was no surprise that all the Runcandel children had selected the weapons.\u201cNow, choose one of them, son.\u201dThe members of the Runcandel family watched Jin crawl with great anticipation.They were all curious to see which sword the youngest child would select. Whether it would be twinswords, a greatsword, a longsword, or a completely different one.As the tense gazes focused on Jin, he began to crawl towards the sword he had selected previously.The people around the world probably had no idea that the renowned Runcandels made their children go through such a ridiculous ritual every time.Ugh.\u00a0Jin was frustrated that he couldn\u2019t advance faster. Crawling was taking so long and so much energy.\u2018The sword I subconsciously chose in the past was quite an inconvenience, but this time, I\u2019ll intentionally select that same sword.\u2019Badump. Badump.\u00a0He could feel his tiny heart beating with power.The weapons were planted in a circle. The item Jin wanted was in the middle.As he rolled and crawled around, Jin passed by the sword closest to him. The eyes of all the observers in the hall went wide.Even if the child were from the renowned clan of swordmasters, babies would almost always select the item closest to them.However, Jin was zigzagging through the forest of swords, and the others couldn\u2019t help but gulp with each of his movements.They were all thinking the same thing.\u2018Could he be\u2026 going for\u00a0that\u00a0sword?\u2019Jin continued swerving through the blades as the eyebrows on Cyron and Rosa\u2019s frozen faces began twitching in response to each sword he grazed.\u201cGah gah!\u201dJin had finally selected his sword. Blood began dripping down the fingers touching the blade.Everyone\u2019s gazes slowly moved from the baby towards the sword in question, and the siblings\u2019 jaws instantly dropped.They all believed that Jin had coincidentally selected that sword, but the truth couldn\u2019t be more different. He had crawled like a madman to reach this specific weapon. He ended up depleting all his energy, as controlling a 1-year-old\u2019s body wasn\u2019t simple, even with the mind of an adult.\u2018Crawling all the way here intentionally was so exhausting, so how on earth did I accidentally select this sword in my previous life\u2026?\u2019His hand was touching Barisada.It was the sword\u2019s name, and was the clan\u2019s emblem.For many generations, this sword could only be wielded by the Runcandel patriarchs. To be more specific, the patriarchs that had been recognized and acknowledged by all the members of the Runcandel Clan.The number of times Barisada had been \u2018selected\u2019 during the ritual in Runcandel history could be counted on one hand.And every single child that had selected Barisada grew up to become the patriarch of the Runcandel House. Every single child except for Jin Runcandel from his first life.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cJin chose the Founder\u2019s sword.\u201dCyron spoke in a solemn tone.A few people were cheering in joy, and a few others were trying their best to hide their displeasure.This was what the Runcandel superstition was about.\u201cThe ritual is over. And bring Jin to the Storm Castle.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 \u2013 Stormy Days at the Castle (1)6 years have passed since the day Jin selected Barisada.He no longer had to experience the shame of having his nanny replace his diapers, but it was still difficult for him to imitate the attitude of a child.\u2018I want to escape from this Storm Castle already.\u2019The Storm Castle.A castle detached from the Runcandel Clan\u2019s main castle. Every Runcandel child cannot take a single footstep outside the Storm Castle until they turn ten, to protect them from assassination attempts.\u2018What kind of madman would try to assassinate the Runcandel children? Even their worst enemies, the Zipfels, wouldn\u2019t dare to.\u2019In actuality, there was a certain case around 200 years ago when someone had attempted it.The Kungen Clan, another clan of swordmasters, had attacked the Runcandels, and 9 young children of the Runcandel Clan ended up getting killed.However, the very next day the entire Kungen Clan was annihilated, including every family member and the extended families of the servants, and disappeared into the annals of history.Ever since then, it had been a tradition and rule within the Runcandel household to have every child remain within the Storm Castle after their \u2018Selection\u2019 rituals until they became 10 years of age.\u2018I\u2019m so bored.\u2019The atmosphere in the Storm Castle was indeed worthy of its name.It was located at the peak of Mt. Murakan, which was presumed to be the tallest mountain in the world. As its name suggested, a tempest was surrounding the castle at all times, during all four seasons. The rain, gales, and lightning constantly affected the mountaintop.\u2018This place isn\u2019t suitable for a child\u2019s emotional growth. No wonder my brothers ended up becoming so violent and brutal\u2026 It\u2019s because of this goddamn place.\u2019There were only two other Runcandel children residing in the castle with Jin. His 10 other siblings had all exceeded the age of ten.Jin and his two brothers, the 5 elite knights protecting them, their nannies, and the 10-ish servants were the only people occupying the Storm Castle.\u201cJin!\u201dAs soon as he heard the voice calling him, Jin\u2019s frustration and irritation increased exponentially.The boy calling for him with that annoying voice was Daytona Runcandel. He was older than Jin by two years.\u201cWhy are you alone without your incredible Barisada? Did you lose it? Kuhaha.\u201dAnd the other brother who was mocking him was Haytona Runcandel. As their names implied, the two were identical twins.The Tona twins of the Runcandel Clan.During his first life, everyone who had dealt with these twins unanimously agreed on one statement.That they were the Devil\u2019s Spawn.\u2018These annoying brats.\u2019Jin turned around to face them.He had not a single good memory about the Tona twins.They had bullied him from an early age solely for selecting Barisada during his ritual.And one would be severely mistaken to underestimate the 9-year-old brats and their harassments.The first thing these brothers did when they left the Storm Castle at the age of 10 in his previous life was to assassinate someone. That was how messed up they were by nature.As Jin didn\u2019t react to their mockery, the Tona twins continued to harass him.Gilly, Jin\u2019s nanny, had temporarily left the Storm Castle today. The twins had been eagerly waiting for this day to come, and had no intention to let Jin spend the day in peace.\u201cOi, we\u2019re talking to you. Where is Barisada?\u201dThe Tona twins had begun to torment him one year ago in this life.It had started off as some light harassment that Gilly wouldn\u2019t notice. Some examples were locking the door when Jin went to the bathroom, or pouring a bunch of salt in his soup.But afterwards, it began to escalate. They tied a dead bird on the door handle to Jin\u2019s room, and secretly released a venomous scorpion from the Storm Castle\u2019s garden onto Jin\u2019s bed.Nonetheless, Jin had endured the harassment in silence.The twins approached their younger brother with large strides.As he watched them indifferently, a smirk began to form on Jin\u2019s face.\u201cHm, I\u2019m not sure where I put it. Oh, maybe I stuffed it up your asshole?\u201dSnap.The twins froze, and stared back and forth between each other and their youngest brother. That wasn\u2019t the reaction they had been expecting from him.Asshole\u2026Despite being innate murderers, the Tona twins were still 9-year-old children. It was an aggressive term for the two of them. When they realized the offensive nature of the expression, the Tonas\u2019 faces began boiling in rage.\u201cWhat did you just\u2026 Did you lose your mind, Jin?\u201d\u201cWake up already. Your nanny isn\u2019t here to protect you today.\u201d\u201cPffft.\u201dJin let out a small sneer, and took a step towards his brothers.The Tona twins weren\u2019t the only ones waiting for his nanny\u2019s absence. Rather, Jin had been waiting for this day to come far more ardently than them.He couldn\u2019t wait to beat these little demons into submission.\u2018My past 7-year-old self could never even have thought of standing up against the Tona twins.\u2019But he was different now.Even if the two brothers before him were a decade older, Jin was confident he could kill at least one of them.Not having realized the urgency of their situation, the Tona twins boldly continued glaring at Jin.\u201cIf you beg for forgiveness right now, we\u2019ll let you off by just breaking your nose.\u201d\u201cOtherwise, we\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re in a state far worse than the bird on your door yesterday.\u201dApproximately 5 steps for a 7-year-old. That was the distance between Jin and his brothers in the Storm Castle\u2019s hallway.\u201cAack!\u201dSuddenly, Haytona yelped as he crouched on the floor. The startled Daytona looked around to check their surroundings, only to realize that his twin brother\u2019s back was being squashed by Jin underfoot.Jin had instantaneously narrowed the distance between them and had planted his fist in Haytona\u2019s stomach.\u201cEh?\u201dUgh.Eventually, Daytona took a punch to the jaw and collapsed on the floor. It was their first time being hit in this manner. Moreover, their 7-year-old brother\u2019s fist felt like a chunk of ice. Cold and hard.\u2018Wha-What was that?\u2019The instant he got hit, Daytona caught sight of a dark aura surrounding Jin\u2019s fist.But he didn\u2019t have time to dwell on it. As he began to return to his senses, another punch came flying at him.Thwack!\u201cUrgh!\u201dHis painful cry couldn\u2019t escape from his mouth, as if his throat were blocked by something. All he could do was rack his brains and figure out where everything had gone wrong as throbbing tears ran down his face.No one else was in the hallway.They had chosen this location specifically to harass Jin, but the Tona twins could never have imagined that their decision would come back to bite them.\u201cAbout that pitiful bird you two trampled to death, I gave it a proper burial.\u201dThud, thud, thwack.Jin continued straddling the two unconscious twins and swung his fists as he spoke in a monotonous voice.\u2018Am I going too far? They are technically still kids.\u2019A sudden hesitation came over him, but ended up disappearing as quickly as it had come. The previous versions of the 9-year-old Tona brothers were far worse than the current him. They even made him swallow horse shit.If Jin were to hold back today, the twins would most likely try to commit similar acts again.\u201cPhew.\u201dTwitch, twitch!After a long beating, the bodies of the two unconscious twins began convulsing. Their youngest brother finally stood up and looked down on them indifferently.\u201cYou two better do your best not to catch my attention from now on. As long as you want to live, that is.\u201d\u201cYoung master!\u201dHaving sensed the unusual atmosphere in the castle, a knight in charge of their protection came running down the hallway.He was a top-class guardian knight, and normally wouldn\u2019t have been shocked by a fistfight between kids, even if they were from the Runcandel Clan.However, even he couldn\u2019t help but stare in disbelief at Jin who was looking down indifferently towards the unconscious twins lying on the ground.\u2018The 7-year-old young master pummelled his older brothers?\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe it. Normally, there should\u2019ve been a large difference in physique between a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old. Moreover, the Tona twins had been learning the Runcandel Martial Arts recently.On the other hand, Jin had yet to start learning martial arts. In fact, he hadn\u2019t begun to learn anything at all. At least, that\u2019s what the guardian knight had been told.\u201cUuugh.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Jin, what just\u2026\u201dThe knight asked him as Daytona let out a barely audible moan.\u201cThey started fighting each other out of nowhere.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cThey fought each other.\u201dThe knight realized immediately that Jin was lying, but he couldn\u2019t pursue the matter anymore. He could see Jin smirking, as if everything had gone according to his plan.While the guardian knight\u2019s duty was to protect the children, he was still an outsider to this family. He was not in a position where he could argue with the young masters of the Storm Castle.\u2018I already knew that the children of the Runcandel Clan were violent and brutal, but this just confirms my beliefs\u2026 I should just report to the patriarch and stay out of this.\u2019The knight courteously bowed to Jin. He may be a 7-year-old, but he was still a bona fide Runcandel by blood.\u201cI understand. Then I shall take the Tona young masters to the doctor.\u201d\u201cNo need. There\u2019s somewhere else my brothers need to go.\u201d\u201cSomewhere else? Where is that?\u201d\u201cThe grave.\u201d\u201cThe\u2026 grave?\u201d\u201cCarry them for me.\u201dAs the light in Jin\u2019s eyes changed, the knight had no choice but to pick up the unconscious boys on his shoulders.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHe awkwardly followed the young boy before him. Jin was headed towards the small mound in the Storm Castle\u2019s backyard, where a heavy rainstorm was crashing down.It was the bird\u2019s grave. The bird the Tona twins had killed.The small mound hadn\u2019t been destroyed by the downpour yet.\u201cPut them down.\u201d\u201cBut Young Master, the storm\u2026\u201dThe fierce rainstorm was about to swallow up the knight and Jin, not to mention the two unconscious boys.Jin didn\u2019t reply and merely stared at him dead in the eye.The knight soon realized that it was a command. He could see it from Jin\u2019s attitude. It was the attitude of a Runcandel who was giving a serious order.He could never have imagined that a 7-year-old could have such an imposing and kingly aura.The knight had no right to refuse. Even if the command would harm another Runcandel, he still couldn\u2019t refuse it. In the first place, the Tona twins weren\u2019t awake to order him to refuse right now.All he could do was follow the command of the Runcandel before him.It wasn\u2019t up to him to consider the consequences of these orders, it was up to the patriarch and the elders. Even if the Tona twins were to die of hypothermia, the Runcandel Clan wouldn\u2019t put the blame on the knight.Familial disputes and quarrels were common within the clan.\u201cI shall comply, Young Master.\u201dHe put the twins down in front of the grave. The two boys were still motionless, except for a few occasional twitches.The Tona twins were rescued two hours later by Gilly, who was returning from her outing.The two of them had acute pneumonia for a few days, and didn\u2019t dare to look Jin in the eyes until the day they left the Storm Castle.***The continent\u2019s eastern region, the unprotected area. Also known as the Black Sea.Cyron had been meditating in this monster-infested land for a few days now.He was merely sitting on the ground, but the nearby monsters wouldn\u2019t dare approach him, even the ones the size of buildings.Soon, a man covered in the blood of countless monsters walked towards Cyron.\u201cGreetings to the patriarch. This is Khan.\u201dIt was the guardian knight who had obeyed Jin\u2019s orders and left the Tona twins out in the rainstorm ten days ago.\u201cIs something the matter?\u201dCyron asked as he carefully opened his eyes.\u201cI have come to report about a dispute between the young masters at the Storm Castle.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019d disturb my training just because of a dispute between children. Speak freely.\u201dKhan explained the details of the incident, and a smile grew on Cyron\u2019s face.\u201cSo, did the twins die?\u201d\u201cThey did get acute pneumonia, but their lives aren\u2019t in danger.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThen they must\u2019ve learnt an important lesson. I see. You may return.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dKhan had desperately struggled against countless monsters for three whole days just to make this short report, but he didn\u2019t hold any resentment against the patriarch or the young master. He silently returned to the direction of the Storm Castle.\u2018I should go see the youngest for myself.\u2019And so, Cyron made an appearance at the Storm Castle one month later.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3 \u2013 Stormy Days at the Castle (2)When Cyron left the Black Sea, the Runcandels living outside the Storm Castle became busy. They had to welcome back the patriarch who was returning from his outing for the first time in 5 years.\u201cEvery Runcandel flag-bearer must gather at the Storm Castle, except for those working on imperial requests.\u201dThe Black Panther Rosa Runcandel\u2019s command spread around the world like a pulse. The flag-bearers of the clan working in the Vermont Empire, Akin Kingdom, Zhan Kingdom, Curano Dukedom, etc. all promptly gathered at the Storm Castle.\u201cWhat is going on? Our youngest brother\u2019s Selection ritual ended years ago, so why is father coming to the Storm Castle?\u201dCyron\u2019s third son, Ran Runcandel, had returned from the continent\u2019s northern region, where he had been mowing down monsters.\u201cDid the guardian knights stationed at the Storm Castle mention anything?\u201dCyron\u2019s fourth son, Vigo Runcandel. He had to suspend his assassination task commissioned by a big shot of the Curano Dukedom in order to return.His client would most definitely be displeased, but he had no other choice. Unfortunately for him, the Runcandel Clan wouldn\u2019t compensate its agents for discontinuing their ongoing missions in order to answer their summons.\u201cNothing at all. Seems like it\u2019s a confidential matter. Well, I\u2019m not surprised. Even father is personally coming\u2026\u201dCyron\u2019s third daughter, Mary Runcandel. She had been duelling and defeating powerful warriors in the southern region.And so, seven of Cyron\u2019s children assembled at the Storm Castle, along with a total of more than 200 knights and aides who had been assisting them.With this many members, they could destroy an average city in a mere 30 minutes, and an average country in a single day.When the news that Cyron had begun to move spread around the world, various rumors began to spread within the ruling class.\u2018Why is Cyron making a move? Didn\u2019t he say he wouldn\u2019t leave the Black Sea for another 10 years?\u2019\u2018Are the Runcandels finally planning to dominate the world?\u2019\u2018Did the Zipfel Clan show any reaction to this?\u2019The world\u2019s one and only True Holy Knight, Cyron.Cyron\u2019s offsprings, the Runcandels.The ripple effect of these names was huge.Cyron\u2019s children and the clan\u2019s guardian knights were standing in two rows on both sides of the stairs leading up to the Storm Castle. Under the heavy rainstorm, the look in everyone\u2019s eyes was serious. They all appeared determined, as if they were about to go to war.\u201cGreetings to the patriarch!\u201d\u201cGreetings to the patriarch!\u201dAs Cyron arrived at the Storm Castle\u2019s entrance, they simultaneously raised their swords in the air. The mountaintop shook with their resonating voices, as if landslides would occur everywhere.\u201cMhm.\u201dWith a slight nod, Cyron began ascending the stairs.\u2018Father\u2019s mood is odd. Is something extremely important about to happen?\u2019The Runcandel children exchanged glances, sharing their thoughts without any words. As Cyron passed by them, they slowly followed his footsteps with serious expressions. The guardian knights remained behind and guarded the Storm Castle gates.However, none of them were aware of the truth.The reason Cyron had come to the Storm Castle was simply to see his youngest child.***\u201cDaytona, Haytona.\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201dCyron summoned the Tona twins first. The sick brothers knelt before their father as their runny noses caused snuffles to resound in the throne room.\u201cTell me what mistake the two of you made.\u201dJin was waiting inside his room with Gilly, so he couldn\u2019t hear the conversation.The Tona twins hesitated to answer. As seconds passed, Cyron\u2019s eyebrow twitched slightly.\u201cI asked you to tell me what mistake you made.\u201d\u201cTh-That\u2019s\u2026\u201dIn Jin\u2019s previous life, the Tona twins had committed their first murder right after leaving the Storm Castle, at the age of 10. And as they grew older, they killed an average of 50 people every year. They were, quite literally, homicidal maniacs.However, as of right now, they were just 9-year-old brats.They were at the age when their strict father terrified them. Moreover, the word \u2018strict\u2019 couldn\u2019t do their father justice.Not only that, their father had asked for their mistake.They had gotten pummelled by their younger brother. If they had to blame something or someone, it was Jin.The twins seemed to have forgotten how they had harassed their brother before.As they reached this conclusion, the Tona twins made up their minds.\u201cWe haven\u2019t made any mistakes.\u201dDaytona gathered his courage and answered. Cyron propped his chin on his hand, as if he were waiting for his son to finish speaking.\u201cJin used some unknown power to punch Haytona and me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. He used a power that wasn\u2019t aura!\u201dHaytona intervened as he accentuated the second half of his sentence.\u2018A power that wasn\u2019t aura\u2019. In this world, there could only be one answer when it came to a power that wasn\u2019t aura.Magic.If the 7-year-old Jin had used aura in order to beat them, he would\u2019ve been praised by the others. However, it was an entirely different case if it were magic.A child with Runcandel blood using magic was blasphemy.Therefore, the Tona twins were trying to convey the fact that Jin had used magic to defeat them.\u201cMy sons.\u201dA gentle tone resounded.\u201cYes, father!\u201dThe twins answered brightly, as if they were criminals who had found a loophole to take advantage of. Realizing that their father\u2019s voice was gentle, they believed that they had a chance to seize victory.However, Cyron completely ignored the Tona twins\u2019 excuse and spoke in a mellow voice.\u201cI shall give you two a piece of advice that you should engrave in your hearts. If you keep behaving like this\u2026 you will never survive within the Runcandel Clan.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cW-We apologize, father.\u201d\u201cGo call Jin for me.\u201d***As he walked down the hallway, Jin thought about the Tona twins who had come to fetch him.They were completely shrivelled up and looked close to collapsing, as if they had fallen into a beast\u2019s cage and had barely escaped with their lives.\u2018I used to wear the same expression in my previous life whenever I met up with father. I can imagine what those two went through.\u2019Jin hadn\u2019t heard the conversation between the twins and Cyron, but he had an idea about what had been discussed.\u2018Father most likely asked them a question, and the twins weren\u2019t able to give him a satisfying answer. Well, it\u2019s understandable since they\u2019re still kids.\u2019That was how Cyron educated his children.No, it couldn\u2019t even qualify as education. Despite having 13 children, Cyron never raised a single child himself.The people who raised the children within the Runcandel Clan were the nannies.All Cyron and Rosa did was observe their children. They observed how their children grew up, and tried to determine which one of them was most worthy of leading the clan after their father.Furthermore, they would slowly get involved with their children only after they grew into adults and showed results exceeding the \u2018Runcandel standard\u2019.Therefore, Cyron\u2019s arrival at the Storm Castle had become a huge deal.The other siblings waiting in the lobby were dying to know what was occurring inside the throne room.Step, step.Jin could finally see the throne. His father was seated, waiting for him to arrive. He carefully walked towards Cyron as the events in his past life flashed through his head.\u2018My father. The strongest person I\u2019ve ever seen, yet also the cruelest I\u2019ve known.\u2019His mother, Rosa Runcandel, somewhat had a humane aspect to her. When Jin was kicked out of the clan, the news that she refused to eat anything for two days had spread around the world.Nonetheless, she ended up erasing the existence known as \u2018Jin\u2019 from her heart entirely after a few days.However, Cyron was different.He still had some human aspects to him, such as twitching his brows when he got angry or slightly smiling when he found something entertaining.Jin had also heard that when Cyron was younger and hadn\u2019t become the patriarch yet, he could get frustrated, happy, and also struggled for his life.However, when he reached the demigod realm and became the True Holy Knight, those emotions slowly faded away. All that was left within him was an unconditional concern for the clan.\u2018It\u2019s a funny story. Even though he\u2019s reached the demigod realm, he\u2019s still protecting the clan as Eldest Brother hasn\u2019t taken over.\u2019Jin was clenching his teeth so hard he could hear them grinding.He had lived a miserable life in the clan until he got banished. Even when they ate at the same dinner table, the other clan members treated him like air.However, he couldn\u2019t continue acting like this. Cyron would definitely notice it. There\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t realize his youngest son was grinding his teeth as soon as he saw him.\u2018He may be my father, but I\u2019ll make sure he can\u2019t look down on me in this life.\u2019Jin knelt before Cyron as he vowed this to himself, and greeted him.\u201cGreetings to the patriarch.\u201dHe was behaving like the adults of the clan who had long since departed the Storm Castle. He was welcoming Cyron not as his youngest son, but as a member of the clan.Cyron nodded in satisfaction and spoke to his son.\u201cWhy did you call me \u2018patriarch\u2019 instead of \u2018father\u2019?\u201dJin pretended to ponder for a while. He had already predicted Cyron\u2019s reaction to his greeting.\u201cMy elder brothers, elder sisters, and the guardian knights numbering over 100 returned to this castle to welcome you. So I inferred that the patriarch\u2019s visit to the castle was a formal one.\u201dCyron\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cExcellent.\u201dJin didn\u2019t respond to his father\u2019s exclamation and slightly lowered his head to show his gratitude.While it was unthinkable for a 7-year-old to show such impressive manners, Cyron didn\u2019t suspect anything. He merely believed that Gilly had educated Jin properly and that his son had a keen insight, just like how he had selected Barisada during the ritual.However, Jin wasn\u2019t a genuine 7-year-old. He had the mind of an adult from his past life. Cyron was unaware of that fact, despite having reached the demigod realm.As he gazed at his son vacantly, Cyron spoke once again.\u201cJust now, I asked your brothers what mistake they had made. They weren\u2019t able to answer my question.\u201d\u201cYes, patriarch.\u201d\u201cHowever, I feel like I should try asking you that same question. So, what mistake did Daytona and Haytona make?\u201dOnce again, Jin pretended to think to himself. He had somewhat foreseen the conversation developing in this direction.No. In fact, he had completely predicted this outcome because Cyron Runcandel would not hesitate to treat his sick children like war veterans who had been through countless hardships.The answer Cyron wanted to hear had already been decided from the beginning.\u201cIt\u2019s revenge.\u201d\u201cHm!\u201dCyron\u2019s wide eyes glinted in astonishment. As he sat quietly for a few seconds, Jin explained his previous answer.\u201cMy brothers should\u2019ve tried to get revenge on me. A Runcandel must always repay one\u2019s dues to another, whether it be a favor or a grudge.\u201dSilence ensued.Jin was certain that this lack of reaction from his father was synonymous to satisfaction.However, he now had to show a childish attitude to eliminate any suspicions Cyron could have. He raised his head ever so slightly with a worried gaze, and asked his father.\u201cWas my answer incorrect?\u201d\u201cNo. On the contrary, it was extremely satisfactory.\u201d\u201cThank you, patriarch.\u201dAt his son\u2019s words, Cyron showed hints of sadness in his eyes.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou may call me \u2018father\u2019 for now. Our clan members may have gathered at this castle to welcome me, but my visit here is purely for personal reasons.\u201d\u201cYes, father.\u201dCyron faintly smiled as he looked down at his son.In the blink of an eye, all signs of contentment disappeared from his face. As his aloof and indifferent expression returned, Cyron asked his son another question.\u201cWhat is this special power you used to defeat your brothers?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 \u2013 Stormy Days at the Castle (3)\u201cI do not know either.\u201dJin responded in a calm tone.\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201dCyron raised his head. He hadn\u2019t expected this reply from his clever son, who had been giving satisfactory answers all this time.\u201cYes, father. This power isn\u2019t aura, so I\u2019m not sure what I should call it.\u201dOnce again, the flow of the conversation had been predicted by Jin. He had shown a child-like innocence on purpose, just like he had done earlier.Swoosh.The sound of flames swirling resounded. Jin had generated a handful of dark energy atop his palm. It was the power he had used to pummel the Tona twins.He had gained this power, Spiritual Power, through his contract with Solderet, the God of Shadows. Despite acting like an ignorant child, Jin knew better than anyone what this power was.He also knew that Cyron would recognize this power.\u201cMay I request father to give this power a name?\u201dJin looked up to Cyron with twinkling eyes.Cyron\u2019s jaw dropped for the first time since he reached the demigod realm and became a True Holy Knight\u2026\u2018Lord Solderet\u2026\u2019He finally managed to shut his mouth. As he stared at his son\u2019s palm, Cyron gulped.Could it be that this child was the reincarnation of the clan\u2019s founder and first patriarch? Such questions went through his mind as Cyron thought to himself.Solderet. The God of Shadows. A being that all the magicians of the world yearn for.However, Cyron and Jin were both aware of a different truth.Originally, Solderet didn\u2019t specialize in magic, but was something akin to a God of Swords. Moreover, 1000 years ago, he had made a contract with the clan\u2019s founder and had protected the Runcandels for years.\u2018I thought that he had abandoned the clan ever since the founder passed away, but it seems that he has taken an interest in my youngest child.\u2019Could this be a sign that the Runcandels could once again rise and prosper in the future?No, it was also possible that the god who had once abandoned them had returned on a whim, and would soon leave again. Cyron began to calculate the possibilities as he watched the shadows dance upon Jin\u2019s palm.\u2018I\u2019m certain that he hasn\u2019t made a contract with the god yet. If he had gained this power through the contract, there\u2019s no way he wouldn\u2019t know what power this is.\u2019Jin could easily guess the thoughts passing through his father\u2019s mind.He started getting somewhat nervous as everything had gone according to his plan. It was far too easy. He believed that Cyron would show some suspicions at some moment, but that moment never came. Maybe it was because of his young age and childish appearance.7 years of age was an excellent period to lie and trick people.\u201cMy son.\u201dCyron had finished sorting out his thoughts.\u201cYes, father.\u201d\u201cThat is the power of a god named Solderet. Therefore, I cannot name it. Lord Solderet is one of the secrets our clan has kept hidden for a long time.\u201d\u201cSolderet\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is the being who brought about shadows in this world. You may be a clever child, but you\u2019re still too young to understand this.\u201d\u201cIs he\u2026\u201dWhen Jin paused, Cyron nodded to urge him to continue.\u201cIs God Solderet stronger than father?\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201dCyron let out an awkward laugh signifying his defeat. He had never laughed like this ever since becoming a demigod.Having devoted his time and energy to his training for countless years now, his emotions and spirit had been stirred for the first time in a long time.\u201cI wonder\u2026 Your father has never attempted to challenge gods, so I cannot say.\u201dTruly a prideful reply. Not knowing the answer for never having battled gods.Nonetheless, Jin shuddered as he listened to his father\u2019s reply. The person in question was Cyron Runcandel.The strongest man on the continent.Even the clanmaster of the Zipfel Clan, Kelliark Zipfel, could not hold a candle to this man.Smirk.Cyron showed a toothy grin.\u201cI\u2019ve truly made the correct decision to come and meet you today. Your naive question has become a great topic of interest for me. Thank you, my son. Come closer.\u201dCould he win against a god? Cyron had called this question a \u2018topic of interest\u2019.Once Jin walked up to him, his father lightly patted his head. The handful of shadow was still swirling on Jin\u2019s palm right now.\u201cHow do you want to use this power?\u201d\u201cI want to use it for the clan, father.\u201dI want to use it for myself.There was no need for him to answer honestly. The only things the clan had given Jin in his past life was scorn and contempt.He had never felt the warmth called \u2018family\u2019 again after turning 7 years old. Therefore, Jin had absolutely no intention of using his life to serve the clan, unless he somehow became the patriarch of the family. However, in order to do that, he would have to defeat his monstrously powerful siblings.\u201cKuhahaha!\u201dCyron suddenly burst into laughter. The echoes resounded throughout the entire Storm Castle and shook the ground.The siblings waiting outside the throne room all jolted in surprise. They had never heard their father laugh so vigorously in recent years.After a while, the laughter subsided and Cyron turned expressionless as usual. He bent down and brought his face up close to Jin\u2019s.\u201cWhat an amusing lie. You can be more honest with your father, you know?\u201dJin hadn\u2019t expected this situation. Nevertheless, he suppressed his shock and slowly spoke.\u201c\u2026for me.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cI want to use it for myself.\u201d\u201cRight. After having pummelled your brothers and leaving them out in the storm, there\u2019s no way you\u2019d use your power for the clan. I\u2019ll be watching over you from here on out.\u201dCyron walked past Jin and left the room. After his father\u2019s footsteps disappeared into the distance, Jin finally noticed the cold sweat running down his face and back.A mixture of disbelief and relief painted across his face.\u201cPhew!\u201dHe let out a large breath of air and wiped his sweat with his sleeve. He had never faced his father in such a bold manner during his past 28 years of life.\u2018I did it. I made it!\u2019As the adrenaline rush subsided, he could finally hear his heart beating like crazy.Through today\u2019s conversation with his father, Jin had obtained Cyron\u2019s approval to use Solderet\u2019s power freely, and his father\u2019s expectations of him were high.\u2018In my first life, I ended up dying without getting the chance to properly use Solderet\u2019s power, and I never would\u2019ve thought that father would hold expectations for me back then.\u2019Even after getting banished from the clan, Jin did not have the liberty of using Solderet\u2019s power freely.The clan wouldn\u2019t allow a banished Runcandel to gain power and potentially use it against them.Therefore, Jin had to hide in the Akin Kingdom and train in secrecy. The Akin Kingdom was affiliated to the Lutero Magic Federation, which was under the Zipfel Clan\u2019s influence. It was the perfect place for Jin to hide, as he was technically a magician back then.The Runcandel Clan\u2019s long-time secret: the founder\u2019s contract with Solderet.Jin was already aware of this undisclosed information before his rebirth. Cyron had called it a secret the clan had \u2018kept hidden for a long time\u2019, but Jin was more knowledgeable about the details of the founder\u2019s relation with Solderet than his father.Solderet had told Jin about his history with the Runcandel Clan personally after their contract was made. At that time, Solderet and Jin would chat amicably like two close friends.\u2018But he never told me why he left the Runcandels and became a god of magic instead of the god of swords. He didn\u2019t get involved during my death either.\u2019Moreover, ever since his rebirth, Solderet hadn\u2019t spoken to him once.Jin speculated that his rebirth was a phenomenon that had transpired due to Solderet\u2019s power and authority, but that was merely a hypothesis.When Jin was one year old, he realized that the power he had obtained through the contract was still available to him.It became usable immediately after I \u2018selected\u2019 Barisada.On his \u2018Selection\u2019 day, during the night after the ritual was over, a 9-star magician\u2019s curse, the \u2018Bladed Illusion\u2019, was cast on Jin. It was the same curse as his past life. The incident was repeating itself.[Contractor, it seems that someone bore a grudge against you since your childhood. You haven\u2019t been able to use your full potential due to a trivial curse. That might\u2019ve been the reason why I was so captivated by you.]Those were Solderet\u2019s words right after they had made their contract.As Jin remembered that conversation, he watched the curse\u2019s chains slowly crawl into his cradle. While he was fully conscious, he couldn\u2019t resist or block the curse with the body of a 1-year-old.He began blaming his newborn body for his powerlessness. He could neither resist the curse slithering towards him, nor call out for help.Suddenly, Solderet\u2019s power manifested itself.The chains never managed to reach Jin, and disappeared into his shadow.Curses of this level could not affect Solderet\u2019s contractor. Using his past life\u2019s magic teacher\u2019s expression, it was an \u2018extremely cheat-like\u2019 effect.\u2018Just you wait. I don\u2019t know who cast this curse on me, but once I\u2019ve grown up, I will find you. And I will kill you.\u2019The power to control shadows; his knowledge of magic he gained in his past life; and, despite having unlocked and practiced it belatedly, his skills and talent with the sword. Jin had retained all these qualities through the reincarnation.He would not face the same fate as last time. The clan would not banish him for not having any talents this time. An entirely different future was awaiting him.\u201cYoung Master.\u201d\u201cYes, Nanny Gilly?\u201dAs he turned around, Gilly was waiting for him at the entrance.\u201cThe patriarch has announced his departure. You must come to see him off.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026 are you alright?\u201dGilly asked in concern.She had seen the Tona twins returning to their rooms with ashen-white faces and expressions of terror, therefore she couldn\u2019t hide her worries for Jin.\u201cI\u2019m okay. Are my elder brothers and sisters leaving as well?\u201d\u201cYes. They only came here to greet the patriarch. Ah! But Lady Mary has left behind a gift for you, Young Master.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll open the gift later. I should go see father off first.\u201dThere were over 200 guardian knights who had turned up at the Storm Castle, accompanying their respective Runcandel flag-bearers.As Cyron was preparing to leave again, the others had no reason to stay. Once they would leave, Jin could ignore the Tona twins and spend his days quietly at the Storm Castle here on out.Spend his days quietly gaining strength without anyone noticing, in fact.\u201cAll hail!\u201d\u201cAll hail!\u201dThe knights raised their swords to the sky as Cyron exited the gates. Jin and the Tona twins stood next to them and bowed their heads as well.\u2018The next time I see father will be at the main house instead of the Storm Castle.\u2019Cyron returned to the direction of the Black Sea.The people who were expecting Cyron to lead them to a bloody battle against the Zipfel clan all hid their disappointment deep in their hearts. The Runcandel flag-bearers each returned to their original whereabouts, followed by their guardian knights.Cyron never returned to the Storm Castle again until Jin turned 10 and left. However, the guardian knight called Khan would occasionally leave for the Black Sea in order to inform the patriarch about Jin\u2019s recent actions.\u2018Elder sister Mary isn\u2019t in her right mind. I\u2019m still only 7 years old\u2026 Hahaha. To think she\u2019d give me such an amazing present!\u2019Jin shouted out in his mind as he opened the gift in his room. Gilly\u2019s eyes also turned wide as she checked the item left behind by Jin\u2019s third sister, Mary.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euBefore their eyes was the heart of a beast summoned by a magician from the Zipfel Clan. Mary had personally killed the summoned beast in the continent\u2019s southern region.A Phoenix Heart.A rare and precious gift Jin never received in his previous life.Mary was wishing for his well-being and wanted her youngest brother to grow up strong and healthy.Jin could now decoct the heart and consume it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 \u2013 Stormy Days at the Castle (4)Jin\u2019s third sister, Mary Runcandel.Currently aged 19, she is known around the world as \u2018Stormwind Mary\u2019.In the Runcandel Clan\u2019s thousand-year-old history, not a single child failed to become a 1-star knight before reaching 14. By 16, most would be 3-star knights, and the average would become a 5-star before the age of 20.Mary\u2019s case was the complete opposite of the past Jin.She exceeded the Runcandel Clan\u2019s norm. While Jin became a 1-star knight at 25 years old, she achieved the same feat at 12 and was already a 5-star knight at 16.Moreover, she was currently a 6-star knight.Despite not being 20 yet, she reached a stage that most people around the world could only dream of attaining.By exceeding the Runcandel norm, the word \u2018genius\u2019 that applied to all Runcandels could no longer do justice to her and her achievements.Regardless of her talents, Mary was one of the few people who had shown goodwill and compassion towards Jin in his previous life.\u2018She may have a screw or two loose in her head, but she\u2019s given me an incredible gift. I was just starting to get frustrated by my slow growth speed.\u2019One month has passed since Cyron left the Storm Castle.During that time, the smell of the Phoenix Heart being decocted in the kitchen had spread throughout the entire castle. Moreover, several corridors and halls near the kitchen were scorching due to the special heat released by the Phoenix Heart.Despite all this havoc, Mary had returned to the southern region as if the heart was insignificant to her.Normally speaking, a Phoenix Heart was\u2026 a rarity similar to an elixir that even kings and queens couldn\u2019t eat often.The meat was tender and softer than veal, it had a richer fragrance than truffles, and its effects were far more potent than herbal tonics.\u201cYoung Master, within a couple of hours, you\u2019ll finally be able to eat the heart. Good job waiting patiently until now.\u201dJin nodded excitedly as his eyes glimmered.It had taken Mary\u2019s gift a month to be fully cooked. Gilly hadn\u2019t been able to sleep properly during this entire month because she was busy simmering the Phoenix Heart for her young master.Nevertheless, she was ecstatic. Jin\u2019s happiness was her happiness. A nanny within this clan was responsible for a Runcandel child\u2019s growth, and their future depended greatly on how strong and dependable the child became.Due to this tradition, Jin felt guilt-ridden towards Gilly. In his previous life, his nanny\u2019s life had taken a turn for the worse after his banishment from the clan. Her future was bleak and her lifestyle had completely crumbled.\u201cYou may not be aware, Young Master, but the Phoenix Heart is an elixir that is especially effective on children. You can increase your tolerance against flames only by eating it at a young age. Lady Mary has given you a truly priceless gift.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dJin was far more knowledgeable about the heart than Gilly, but he pretended to be interested by her explanation.He had studied about the Phoenix Heart endlessly during the years when he was training his magic.\u2018However, I didn\u2019t do research on it back then because I wanted to eat one, but because I wanted to learn the traits of a phoenix as a magician.\u2019Summoning a phoenix was every magician\u2019s dream. But Jin had died right before becoming a 6-star magician, the stage at which one can finally summon the bird in question.\u201cOf course! I hid your eyes when I first saw the puddle of blood inside the box, but once I realized it was the priceless product that even the Vermont imperial family couldn\u2019t easily obtain\u2026\u201dAs Gilly continued her lengthy commentary, Jin began to think about phoenixes.He couldn\u2019t wait until he could finally summon one during this life. Learning magic as a Runcandel was strictly prohibited, but Jin had no intentions of giving up on it.As long as he didn\u2019t get caught, everything would work out.Moreover, if he gained unparalleled power or influence, or if he had a good enough justification, then it wouldn\u2019t matter even if he did get discovered.Martial arts and magic.A lifestyle and path that encompassed both of those aspects: the Magic Swordsman. In order to become a magic swordsman, Jin was prepared to shoulder any hardships.\u2018If it were me\u2026 I would never have let my enemies steal and eat my phoenix\u2019s heart.\u2019Phoenixes were immortal beings that would be reborn even after death. Even if one were killed by an enemy and had its heart stolen, it would revive 100 years later in nature.Nevertheless, 100 years was a long period of time. The phoenix\u2019s original summoner would\u2019ve died by then.\u201cYou mustn\u2019t forget to thank Lady Mary the next time you see her, Young Master.\u201d\u201cYeah, I won\u2019t.\u201dThe Phoenix Heart was ready. A strong and rich fragrance began to spread throughout the castle.\u201cI must go prepare your meal, so come down in a little while, Young Master!\u201dGilly exited the room, humming and skipping in joy as the door remained ajar. Once she left his field of vision, a deep sigh escaped Jin\u2019s mouth.\u201cStop loitering around me. It\u2019s annoying.\u201d\u201cAh, o-okay.\u201d\u201cSure\u2026\u201dThe Tona twins had been dawdling outside the room since a while ago. Once Gilly had left, they stood by the entrance, close to the door, and shot glances towards their youngest brother.Jin let out a light snicker when he noticed the twins drooling from the smell.\u2018Geez, look at these cute, little brats\u2026\u2019When he gestured them to get closer with his finger, the Tona twins dashed inside the room.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dJin asked them coldly despite knowing full well that they were here for the Phoenix Heart. The Tona twins were squirming awkwardly, as if they desperately needed to head to the bathroom.They wanted to ask Jin to share some of the Phoenix Heart, but were too afraid to do so. The beating from last month and their father\u2019s scolding had traumatized them.Jin found this situation quite entertaining. In his previous life, the Tona twins would always steal something from him or beat him up if he bumped into them in the hallways. He could never have imagined that they\u2019d be the ones being cautious of him now.\u2018They were probably ordered by Emma to convince me to share some Phoenix Heart with them.\u2019Emma Niltro.Just like Gilly, she was a nanny living in the Storm Castle. She was in charge of the Tona twins\u2019 growth. However, unlike Gilly who had died a gruesome death during Jin\u2019s first life, Emma had been living lavishly thanks to the well-off Tona twins.Despite becoming crazed murderers, Daytona and Haytona never forgot about Emma and took good care of her. But that was all part of her plan.If Gilly was the type to raise children with love and affection, Emma was the type to raise them using the carrot and stick approach. She never taught the Tona twins concepts such as selflessness or morality.Truth be told, both of those concepts weren\u2019t very useful in the Runcandel Clan, as one\u2019s enemies could take advantage of them. But Jin still believed that Emma\u2019s teachings were distorted.She was the biggest influence upon the Tona twins\u2019 upbringing, and was the cause of their twisted characters.\u201cUm\u2026 you see\u2026 the Phoenix\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 isn\u2019t there\u2026 a bit too much to eat\u2026 on your own?\u201d\u201cWhat was that? I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d\u201cThe Phoenix Heart soup. Could you share a bowl with us? Otherwise, we\u2019ll get scolded by Emma.\u201d\u201cDo us a favor, brother.\u201d\u2018Seems like they\u2019re more afraid of Emma than me.\u2019Jin snickered as he thought to himself.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d\u201cAh, please\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re begging you!\u201dThe Tona twins were on the verge of crying, but Jin had not a speck of sympathy for them within his heart.Jin already knew that the Tonas were used to the carrot and stick approach, so he planned on making them do some physically exhausting work in return for the Phoenix Heart soup.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to go that far, then I won\u2019t refuse. But I have a condition.\u201d\u201cOh, what is it? What is it?\u201d\u201cRemember that grave I made?\u201dThe Tona twins shuddered and turned pale at the word \u2018grave\u2019. The memories of being pummelled and left out in the rainstorm in front of the grave had resurfaced.\u201cIf you look carefully, there\u2019s a small hole behind that grave.\u201d\u201cA hole?\u201d\u201cYeah. Like a burrow. I want you two to dig into that hole and make it deeper. You have until nightfall. Of course, you can\u2019t rest at all.\u201dThe task Jin had given to his 9-year-old brothers was, quite literally, a waste of time.\u201cWhy\u2026 do we need to dig there?\u201d\u201cI want to bury the bird you two killed in a deeper hole and give it a better grave.\u201dThe twins lost strength in their legs and felt them wobble.However, if they didn\u2019t have to face their terrifying brother in another fight, and could eat the Phoenix Heart soup with such a trifling task, then they had no complaints.\u201cHow deep do we need to dig?\u201d\u201cI told you to dig until nightfall with no rest, didn\u2019t I?\u201d\u201cAlright. So if we dig until then, you\u2019ll share some Phoenix Heart soup with us?\u201d\u201cOf course I will. But you need to do your best. If I\u2019m not satisfied by the depth of the hole, this agreement is invalid. Oh, by the way, there are plenty of shovels in the warehouse. You should use those.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d\u201cAnd this is pretty obvious, but you can\u2019t order someone else to dig for you, alright?\u201dThe twins nodded vigorously and immediately departed to begin their work.******While the Tona twins were shovelling in the backyard, Jin was eating the Phoenix Heart soup at the dinner table.\u201cIs it that tasty, Young Master?\u201dGilly asked as she watched Jin gleefully slurping down the meal. She thought that Jin was joyful because of the delicious soup.\u201cYeah, it\u2019s so tasty!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s more than enough to last you for 3 days, so don\u2019t hesitate to ask if you want another serving.\u201dWith each spoonful going down his throat, Jin could feel his bones and skin becoming sturdy. If he ate the soup for 3 days, his affinity and resistance against fire would increase substantially.However, Jin wasn\u2019t smiling from ear to ear because of the Phoenix Heart.\u2018Within a few days, I\u2019ll have access to the secret tomes\u2026!\u2019The spot where the Tona twins were digging, behind the bird\u2019s grave.Despite being only 9 years old, the twins\u2019 physical abilities were still far above the world\u2019s average as they were of the Runcandel bloodline.The Runcandels had special bodies as if they had been blessed by the heavens.So if the twins continued digging until nightfall using their blessed bodies, the hole would reach the \u2018underground wall\u2019.\u2018They won\u2019t be able to tell if it\u2019s a wall or just a hard boulder, though.\u2019Below the Storm Castle was a secret underground area where some of the Runcandel Clan\u2019s \u2018wrongdoings\u2019 were hidden.The secret tomes of other clans.The Runcandels had subdued and destroyed other clans throughout their history. During these wars, they would steal their enemies\u2019 secret books, scrolls, and records.It goes without saying that Jin wouldn\u2019t be able to easily infiltrate the underground area just because the Tona twins dug until the wall. He would have to deal with the two protective installations that repelled outsiders first.But Jin already knew how to disable them. He had technically lived in the Runcandel Clan for 25 years during his previous life, despite being treated worse than bugs. He had picked up some information and a few tricks here and there within the clan.\u2018I\u2019ll just study those books until the day I leave the Storm Castle.\u2019Jin had emptied two bowls of soup for dinner.\u201cNanny Gilly.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master?\u201d\u201cCould you share some of the Phoenix Heart soup with the twins when night falls?\u201d\u201cAh, how much should I give them?\u201d\u201cOne spoonful each.\u201d\u201cO-One\u2026 spoonful? Why bother sharing some with them in that case? You should eat it all on your own instead.\u201d\u201cI must keep my promise. If they complain about it and ask for more, tell them I said this: \u2018I\u2019ll show you how kind and gentle Emma is compared to me\u2019.\u201dGilly smiled awkwardly as she bowed to him.\u2018Young Master Jin\u2026 Has the ruthlessness of the clan already started to affect him? He\u2019s still too young to be acting like this.\u2019As her wry smile turned into a bitter expression, Jin cuddled into Gilly\u2019s embrace.\u201cElder sister Mary gave me the heart for my sake, and Gilly carefully prepared the soup for an entire month with dozens of sleepless nights. I don\u2019t want to share such a precious meal with those idiots.\u201d\u201cYoung master\u2026\u201dShcrrt, shcrrt.Despite being drenched from the rain, the twins continued shovelling the earth.They reached the underground wall around midnight, which was when they finally stopped digging.\u201cOne spoon?!\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOne spoonful only? That\u2019s just unfair! We dug the ground for the entire day!\u201dThe Tona twins belatedly realized that they hadn\u2019t decided upon a proper \u2018amount\u2019 during their agreement with Jin, and were enraged by their so-called \u2018reward\u2019.However, they couldn\u2019t voice out their frustrations for too long, as Jin glared at them, as if to tell them to savour the spoonful gratefully.\u2018You brats\u2026 If one could earn a spoonful of Phoenix Heart soup with one day of shovelling, most people around the world would come running to me.\u2019Jin truly believed that the twins should be extremely grateful to receive a spoonful of the soup from him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 \u2013 Stormy Days at the Castle (5)Translator \u2013 KokonutMilkProofreader \u2013 yukitokataThe next morning, Jin went to the hole the Tona twins had dug.It appeared that the twins hadn\u2019t resorted to petty tricks. They had dug the hole quite seriously. Inside the deep hole, Jin could see a goldish stone wall on the side at the bottom.Currently, there were 7 guardian knights, 2 nannies and a dozen servants at the castle. Of course, the Tona twins were here as well.Nobody would come here looking for Jin or suspect him of scheming something.\u2018Telling them that I wanted to come here to pray for the dead bird was a pretty good excuse.\u2019Recently, the members of the Runcandel Clan residing at the Storm Castle were wary of Jin. The youngest child of the patriarch did not behave like a young child, and was eerily mature.In fact, some were more than just wary. Many were afraid of the 7-year-old boy.\u00a0 The servants gossiped about him, saying that he was a perfect copy of his cold-hearted father, and the guardian knights obeyed him as if he were their superior.But when Jin said that he would go pray for the bird, they were all relieved. They thought that despite being Cyron Runcandel\u2019s son, a child is still a child.\u2018I pray that you\u2019ll find happiness in your next life.\u2019Jin hadn\u2019t lied when he said he would pray for the bird. He truly did pity it.Once he finished moving the bird\u2019s grave to the bottom of the deep hole the twins had dug, Jin approached the stone wall on the side. There were scratches made by the shovels on its surface.The wall itself wasn\u2019t very solid. There weren\u2019t any metal bars or wires inside to increase its durability, so Jin could easily destroy it with a punch wrapped in shadows.However, breaking it like that would definitely create a loud explosion.The constant rain outside would somewhat muffle the sound, but the 7-star knights in the castle would most likely catch the noise.\u201cHahaha.\u201dJin suddenly laughed as he couldn\u2019t hold himself back. He then spread out his arms and placed his hands against the wall. Immediately, the stone wall began to vibrate ever so slightly.Wroooom!It was the 1-star earth magic spell, \u2018Earth Resonance\u2019.Earth Resonance was a spell that magicians often used while camping outside or exploring the wild, but its lethality was nigh-zero.\u201cI\u2019ve been dying to use magic!\u201dThe practicality and pleasure of using magic!He hadn\u2019t felt this liberating sensation for the past 7 years. Because he had retained his memories and knowledge from his past life, being unable to use magic since he was born was like a punishment to Jin.Magic, a magician\u2019s strength.When he first realized he had been reborn, Jin wondered how he should start learning magic and store mana again\u2026However, his worries were unfounded. Just like how Solderet\u2019s power was still available to him, the mana he had amassed during his previous life was also accessible in this new life.\u2018The only issue is that there\u2019s a limit to the amount of mana I can use right now because of my immature body. But it\u2019s better than nothing!\u2019In his past life, Jin was about to reach the 6-star realm in magic after training for 3 years.Currently, the amount of mana Jin could utilize was equivalent to that of a 1-star magician, but it would increase over time as he grew up.Everytime he aged by another year, he could feel more mana generating within him. Moreover, it was a natural occurrence. Jin hadn\u2019t been training to increase his mana or anything.Therefore, he came to the conclusion that the mana he had accumulated in his past life was slowly returning to him over the years.\u2018The mana of a 1-star magician at 7 years old! I\u2019m certain that no one else in history managed to achieve this feat. At this pace, I\u2019ll reach 6-star before I turn 20 at the latest.\u2019His second life was incomparably preferable and advantageous compared to his first one.He was ecstatic and overjoyed right now. At the young age of 7, Jin could utilize both spiritual power and mana, along with the knowledge and expertise in 3-star swordsmanship and 5-star magic.Furthermore, he could now study the secret tomes of countless martial clans around the world that the Runcandel Clan plundered from! His motivation was at its peak currently, and it would not die down for a long while.\u2018Heh, I truly am a magician down to the core. I never thought I\u2019d be so delighted to use a simple spell like Earth Resonance.\u2019The times he could use magic within the Runcandel Clan was extremely limited.One could even say that until this moment, Jin had no other opportunities to use magic. There were almost no instances when Jin was on his own without anyone accompanying him.Gilly would always be with him, and the rare cases when she wasn\u2019t present, the guardian knights and servants would be by his side. And if, by some miracle, none of them were next to Jin, the Tona twins would come bother him.Therefore, Jin never had the chance to use magic. There were also no moments when he would have no other choice but to resort to magic.Even though Jin could now push the twins around like his servants, he could not afford to use magic and get busted by them.If word spread to his parents or older siblings that Jin had used magic\u2026 his pleasant new life would immediately come to a close at that exact moment.\u2018I should seal away my magic for a while after today. Can\u2019t afford to get caught. But one day, I\u2019ll find a way to use as much magic as I want. Just you wait.\u2019As he licked his lips in anticipation, Jin once again focused on his hands placed against the wall. The sensation of having mana flow through his hands and fingers, and spread throughout the wall sent shivers down his spine.Sssssssssst\u2026And so, 10 minutes passed by quietly. Earth Resonance\u2019s vibrations silently created dozens of cracks and fissures on the wall. Dirt and dust fell down heavily, as if the stone wall would soon collapse.Krrrrrrt!As a matter of fact, the center of the wall where Jin\u2019s hands were located crumbled into fine particles. A small hole appeared, where Jin could barely squeeze his body through. The child stared into the sight beyond the wall for a short instance.There was an old, long hallway\u2014as if he were in some ancient ruins\u2014along with a large steel gate in the distance.It would be a mistake to think that the Runcandel Clan\u2019s secret underground room could be so easily broken into.The \u2018Storm Castle\u2019 was a fortress that even the Zipfel Clan\u2019s elite troops wouldn\u2019t be able to easily conquer. Jin was just lucky as he was a member of the Runcandel Clan who was residing within the said castle.\u2018So this is the secret underground sector that only the Runcandel flag-bearers can enter\u2026 Interesting layout.\u2019Flag-bearers.They were the clan\u2019s representatives who stood on the front lines, waving the clan\u2019s emblem.All the children of the Runcandel Clan became flag-bearers when they reached a certain level, barring the few exceptions like the previous Jin who was deemed incompetent.Jin had heard countless stories about this underground room from his siblings. He, who could only imagine the wonders hiding inside, could finally see it with his own eyes.Jin slightly choked up, as if something deep within his heart had surfaced.\u2018I didn\u2019t think it would affect me this much, but seeing it for myself, my emotions reacted subconsciously.\u2019Phew\u2026After exhaling and calming down, Jin squeezed himself into the hole.Back in the pit the twins had dug, he could hear the constant downpour crashing onto the ground, but as soon as he entered the underground corridor, the noise completely disappeared. With a solemn heart, Jin removed his shoes.He couldn\u2019t leave behind traces of mud in the corridor.The path was dimly lit by a few torches on the walls, where oil dripped down.Jin was about to create a flame with magic to illuminate the place, but decided to grab one of the torches instead. Walking down a worn down corridor barefoot with a torch in hand, he felt like he had become a monk.\u2018Mother used to tell me that before reaching that door, the Runcandel children need to prove that they\u2019re part of the bloodline.\u2019Jin remembered hearing that when he was around 16.Back then, Rosa still believed that her youngest child would one day become a respectable member of the clan.She could not accept the fact that her child was untalented, and held distorted expectations towards him.Rosa had secretly broken the clan rules in order to give Jin confidential information, despite the fact that he wasn\u2019t a genius like his siblings.She wanted to believe that Jin would one day become a 6-star knight and receive the qualifications of a flag-bearer.Rosa Runcandel, the Black Panther, was one of the strongest people in the clan and the world. However, the reason why she couldn\u2019t have an objective view and judgement towards Jin was simply because she was a mother.His mother.\u2018Even so, she ended up facing and accepting the reality later on.\u2019Jin stopped reminiscing the past and paused his walk towards the metal door.He was at the center of the corridor. There were still around 50 steps left until he reached the gate.\u2018Runcandels and magic\u2026?\u2019Pfft.Jin couldn\u2019t help but chuckle when he noticed the magic circle on the floor.It was a large magic circle, but even apprentice magicians could easily analyze it.The Magic Circle of Blood and Barrier.It was a popular magic circle one could often find at the entrances to kingdoms, or inside a businessman\u2019s warehouse, or at a famous mercenary group\u2019s headquarters.Despite its impressive and grand name, it was a basic circle.It was no different to a simple security device. All it could do was determine whether someone would pose a threat through one\u2019s blood.\u2018Those magic-hating clan members actually laid down a magic circle in front of the clan\u2019s secret chamber? Not only that, it\u2019s such a flimsy circle!\u2019Jin bit down on the inside of his cheek. A trail of blood seeped out of his mouth and ran down his chin. Before it could drop on the floor, Jin caught the blood with his hand.Drip, drip\u2026All he needed was a few drops in order to activate the Magic Circle of Blood and Barrier. As he shook off the blood on his hands onto the circle, a blue aura began to fill the air from all four directions.\u2018Proof that we\u2019re part of the bloodline? What a joke.\u2019Jin was curious to know which of his ancestors was stupid enough to place this magic circle here.This magic circle wasn\u2019t elaborate enough to be able to verify someone\u2019s bloodline and lineage. In fact, Jin wasn\u2019t sure if such magic existed in the first place.There were only 3 things this magic circle could determine.It could detect whether the blood was that of a monster, a human, or a plague-stricken human.In other words, as long as they\u2019re able to reach this underground corridor, any healthy human is able to activate this magic circle safely.The magic circle was completely useless, except for how it added an air of mystery to this ancient, hidden chamber.\u2018They believe in that weird superstition called the Selection ritual. They also believe that this magic circle is able to recognize a pure-blooded Runcandel. This clan is quite\u2026 peculiar. Very peculiar.\u2019Clang! Clang! Creaaaak\u2026.!With the circle\u2019s activation, Jin could hear gears and metallic parts grinding and moving beneath the floor.The circle was stopping the traps\u2019 operation\u2014the traps that would\u2019ve attacked Jin if he didn\u2019t activate the magic circle. He silently stood still and waited for the noise to subside.\u2018There are quite a lot of traps. I don\u2019t know the specifics, but the traps here are more elaborate than those found in a royal palace.\u2019The magic circle soon began to dim down, and lost its lustre. The traps had all been disabled. Jin resumed his march and headed towards the door.He had safely dealt with one of the security systems of the Storm Castle\u2019s secret chamber. The remaining one was to safely open the door.But that was even easier to do than activating the magic circle.\u201cRuncandel\u2019s descendant has come to solace Murakan.\u201dCreaaak!The gate began to slide open as soon as Jin uttered the password.It was another type of \u2018barrier magic\u2019 similar to the magic circle just now, but was on a completely different level. It was a spell cast by a great dragon, who has since fallen into a deep slumber.The password deactivates the spell, but without the correct words, the door will never budge open. That was the potency of this barrier magic.One would have to be at least a 9-star knight in order to break the door open.\u2018I heard the password from my second brother before my rebirth, though he was being sarcastic, saying that it would never be of use to me.\u2019The Storm Castle\u2019s location: Mt. Murakan\u2019s summit.The name \u2018Murakan\u2019 did not signify the mountain in the first place. It was the name of the Black Dragon who once reigned over this region.Murakan was defeated 1000 years ago by the first Runcandel patriarch, and went into a deep slumber after handing over the Storm Castle.This story was the most popular legend of the Runcandel Clan, known to everyone around the world.The first thing Jin saw when the door opened wasn\u2019t a shelf with countless books, but a glass coffin.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euInside the glass coffin was a human body. It was Murakan who had transformed into a human before entering a deep slumber.\u2018Nobody told me about this\u2026\u2019Ba-dump, Ba-dump.Having come across an unexpected sight, Jin\u2019s body froze in surprise and unease.He then slowly began approaching the glass coffin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 \u2013 Black Dragon Murakan (1)\u2018I remember hearing the story that the Black Dragon Murakan was defeated by the first patriarch and fell into a deep slumber\u2026 So he was sleeping here?\u2019Jin didn\u2019t know a lot about Murakan. The legends and myths of the clan rarely mentioned him.They just didn\u2019t care much about a dragon that had long since disappeared into the annals of history. The currently active dragons were more worrisome and troubling.The glass coffin was sparkling clean, without a single speck of dust on its surface. But it wasn\u2019t being cleaned every day by a maid. The spotlessness was due to the mana surrounding the coffin.Jin touched the mana with one hand, and chills immediately ran down his spine. As he swallowed his saliva, Jin took another step forward.\u2018That was an interesting sight.\u2019There was nothing Jin could learn from Murakan. If it were an awake and active dragon, things would\u2019ve been different. But Murakan was a hibernating dragon inside a coffin, so Jin was more interested in finding the secret tomes.\u2018This place is bigger than I thought.\u2019The underground chamber seemed larger than the central hall at the Storm Castle. However, it felt empty as there were no decorations furbishing the place. Jin quickly began searching for the tomes.Creaaak\u2026He pushed open the sliding door and located the library. Actually, it was far too shabby to be called a library. The Runcandel Secret \u2018Library\u2019 only contained one bookshelf and a few chairs. However, that was more than enough space to house the secret tomes.There could only be so many books written by other martial clans around the world. The library would have no use of extra shelves.\u2018The tomes!\u2019On the 1.50 meter-wide shelf were dusty books arranged neatly. These books had once been written and used by martial clans around the world, and tried to protect them with their lives on the line.These were the essence of the martial clans that only the flag-bearers could read.Jin calmed down his trembling heart and began checking the names on each of the books on the shelf.\u2018The hand-to-hand combat techniques of the Meyer Clan and Typhen Clan, spear techniques of the Euron Clan and Shagal Clan, swordsmanship from the Attila Clan, etc.\u2026 There are so many of them.\u2019Jin also found a few books from the Kungen Clan, the clan of swordsmen that had attacked the Storm Castle around 200 years ago. Jin\u2019s hands were trembling ever so slightly as he checked the tomes one by one.His excitement was overflowing.In his first life, he had always wished to become a flag-bearer and come down here to read the secret tomes. Now that he was finally here, the memories of his hardships and despair flashed through his mind.Of course, he hadn\u2019t come down to the underground chamber as a flag-bearer this time. Despite having the \u2018Runcandel\u2019 family name, he was no different to a thief who had infiltrated the library.However, Jin didn\u2019t care about those small details.Using whatever methods at hand was part of the Runcandels\u2019 virtue. Moreover, he was planning on officially coming to this underground chamber in a few years after becoming a true flag-bearer.\u2018Which one should I start with?\u2019What a first world problem. He was spoiled for choice. Jin wondered whether his older brothers felt this way when they were secretly reading porn books when their nannies were away. Jin chuckled as he scanned the books before him.He didn\u2019t have a lot of time to remain down here.2 hours.The free time he had obtained through the excuse of wanting to pray for the bird was a mere 2 hours. After this amount of time, Gilly would most probably come to the castle\u2019s backyard in order to look for him.It was as if Jin had a mountain of food before him, but could only eat for a few minutes.\u2018But I\u2019ll have another opportunity. I can come back here another day if I tell them I want to pray for the bird again or that I want to meditate.\u2019Ssst.He pulled out a book from the shelf. Jin\u2019s first secret tome was the Kungen Clan\u2019s book of swordsmanship.\u2018Third Brother once told me that there is a lot to learn from this tome\u2026 Let\u2019s start with this.\u2019There were a total of 3 volumes of the Kungen Clan\u2019s secret tomes. Jin also picked out the remaining two volumes and sat on a chair.Originally, the Kungen Clan\u2019s secret tomes numbered over 10. But when the Runcandels destroyed the clan 200 years ago, most of them were lost during the conflict.The Runcandel Clan had destroyed them intentionally.However, the three volumes in his hands were left untouched. These tomes summarized the essence of the Kungen Swordsmanship\u2019s greatest techniques.Flutter, flutter.The sound of pages turning accelerated. Despite being a secret tome, the first few pages of volume 1 only talked about the base and foundation of the swordsmanship, as well as the behaviour of the Kungen knights.The flutter of pages stopped once Jin arrived at the middle of the book. His gaze deepened as his mind tried to absorb the words on the page.The book that had only been describing the bases suddenly broached upon a difficult subject that Jin couldn\u2019t comprehend at all.\u2018I see\u2026 No wonder they\u2019re called secret tomes. It\u2019s not as easy as I thought.\u2019Despite being written in the continent\u2019s common language, Jin couldn\u2019t understand most of its contents due to his lacking skills and knowledge in swordsmanship.Before his sudden death in the Akin Kingdom, the 28-year-old Jin had attained the 3-star realm in swordsmanship.Not only was he slower to reach that stage than \u2018slightly skilled\u2019 people in general, he could be considered \u2018defective\u2019 compared to the average Runcandel.However, it had only taken him half a year to reach that stage after his contract with Solderet, which could be considered an incredible feat.Nonetheless, the Kungen book was far too difficult for him to understand with his 3-star skills and knowledge in swordsmanship.Be that as it may, Jin had expected this outcome.He took out a notebook and pencil he had brought with him.Jin then began to copy the contents of the tome into his notebook. It was a transcription. In roughly 2 hours, he could copy around 10 pages of the book.Back in his days as a magician, he had transcribed so many books that the fingerprints on his fingers holding the pencil had begun to fade away.10 pages per day.There were 3 years left until Jin would have to leave the Storm Castle. If he transcribed 10 pages every day during those 3 years, he could easily copy all the books here.\u2018And as I continue studying these, I\u2019ll slowly begin to understand the content over time. I\u2019m sure there will be some tomes I won\u2019t have to transcribe.\u2019Scrt, scrt\u2026The sound of a pencil scratching paper resonated in the silent underground room. Jin took exactly 1 hour to copy 10 pages. He then retraced his steps and left the library.He plugged the hole in the wall with earth magic and the dirt around him.And so, 2 months went by. During that time, Jin had fully transcribed the 3 volumes from the Kungen Clan, as well as 2 tomes about the Meyer Clan\u2019s hand-to-hand combat techniques.As the days went by, Jin felt more and more energetic and enthusiastic. He had never felt happier to get out of bed in the mornings before.\u2018What excuse should I use to go down there today? Praying? Meditating? No\u2026 I used those yesterday and the day before that already.\u2019There was a rumour going around the castle, where the servants believed that the spirit of the dead bird had possessed Jin.He continuously went to its grave for 2 months in order to pray and meditate, so their confusion was understandable. Moreover, having heard this odd rumour, the Tona twins began to fear Jin to a far greater extent.\u2018Should I come up with an excuse\u2026 that will let me go there every day without raising suspicion?\u2019After pondering for a while, Jin couldn\u2019t think of anything. How could he possibly convince everyone to let him go to the grave every day?Therefore, Jin began to change his train of thought.\u2018There\u2019s no need to convince them. If I tell them I\u2019ll go there every day, who would dare stand against me? This is the Storm Castle, not the clan\u2019s main residence.\u2019The guardian knights living here already served Jin as a \u2018true Runcandel\u2019 instead of treating him like a child, and the servants had no right to disprove his decisions from the start. The Tona twins were terrified of Jin, so he had no reason to worry about them.The only problem was Gilly.A nanny\u2019s role was different to that of a knight or a servant. They were people who supervised and guided the children they were in charge of.\u201cNanny Gilly.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d\u201cI want to go there again.\u201d\u201cAgain\u2026?\u201dGilly\u2019s gaze was filled with concern.Haaa.She let out a deep sigh and patted Jin on the head.\u201cYoung Master. It\u2019s unfortunate, but the bird has already passed away. It\u2019s been 2 months now. This nanny of yours is so concerned about you that she can\u2019t sleep properly at night.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve forgotten about the bird already. Honestly, I\u2019m only going there everyday because I like it there.\u201d\u201cY-You like it there? Young Master. You mustn\u2019t enjoy being near a grave. Misfortune will befall upon you!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of misfortune?\u201d\u201cGraves are the home of the deceased. Nothing good will happen by staying close to one. You must steer clear from those places to be blessed with good fortune, Young Master.\u201dApparently, the nannies of the Runcandel Clan had a tendency to believe in superstitions as well. Jin was sighing and shaking his head in his mind.\u201cNo, I\u2019ll keep liking graves from now on.\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201d\u201cNanny. Think about it. I\u2019m the youngest child of the Runcandel Clan.\u201dOnce Jin took on a serious tone, Gilly\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cWhy are you suddenly talking about\u2026\u201d\u201cHow many graves do you think I\u2019ll have to make as I live in this world as a Runcandel? To tell the truth, I\u2019m trying my best to understand what \u2018death\u2019 is these days. So I\u2019m going to that grave every day in order to get used to it.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dGilly let out a mumble and stood there wordlessly.She stared blankly at her young master as if her thoughts had come to a sudden stop.Her 7-year-old young master, who was born as a \u2018predator\u2019 amongst the Runcandels, was trying to face the concept of fate and destiny already.Needless to say, that was all her own misunderstanding.Jin was just tricking his nanny\u2014who was younger than him in his first life\u2014to do his bidding.To be frank, no actual 7-year-old would talk about such topics, even if they were geniuses born in the dreadful Runcandel Clan.Nevertheless, Gilly and the others at the Storm Castle had no reason to doubt Jin\u2019s words and actions. No one would imagine that he had retained the memories from his first life.\u2018Something has definitely changed about the young master ever since he met the patriarch. The patriarch must\u2019ve told him something crucial.\u2019Gilly fixed her expression and bowed down.\u201c\u2026In that case, I will not stop you. I believe that the young master will one day become a remarkable knight who will lead the clan. And having listened to your honest opinion, I must say that I\u2019m extremely proud of you, Young Master.\u201d\u201cThanks, Gilly. Until I leave the Storm Castle, I\u2019ll be spending time at the grave for 1 to 2 hours every day.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d\u201cAnd while I\u2019m over there, I don\u2019t want to be disturbed in any way. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI shall inform the knights about that. Also, Young Master?\u201d\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cIf I were to say something as your nanny and as an adult\u2026 it\u2019s not always a good thing to think too deeply about such topics at a young age. Please enjoy yourself doing fun activities from time to time.\u201d\u201cAlright, Gilly. In that case\u2026 hmm\u2026 I want a strawberry pie as a snack later. With lots of honey on it.\u201dGilly\u2019s stiff expression finally loosened as color returned to her face.\u201cI\u2019ll bake the best strawberry pie in the world. Have a good time.\u201dJin smiled brightly and immediately left the room.\u2018I did it! Now I can concentrate on transcribing without having to worry about anything.\u2019During the past 2 months, Jin was always nervous when he entered the underground chamber. If the knights or Gilly came looking for him and discovered the hole, chaos would descend upon the clan.\u2018Since I managed to catch father\u2019s interest, they probably won\u2019t execute me even if they find out about this. But it would still be extremely troublesome and unnerving.\u2019A humming sound escaped his nose unconsciously. Even the Earth Resonance spell felt like it was creating a rhythm as it destroyed the underground wall he had resealed the previous day.He was planning on transcribing the final volume of the Meyer Clan\u2019s tomes on hand-to-hand combat techniques.Scribble, scribble!As he rejoiced at how his remaining 3 years at the castle would be peaceful, he copied the contents of the page.His reincarnation was truly a blessing to him.\u2018The Meyer Clan\u2019s hand-to-hand combat technique doesn\u2019t seem as difficult to understand as the Kungen Clan\u2019s swordsmanship. But this passage about merging one\u2019s physical body with aura\u2026 I don\u2019t get it. Oh well, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll become clear with time.\u2019Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euAn hour went by inside the underground library.Having transcribed several pages without rest, Jin\u2019s thin and soft fingers were throbbing. As he decided to take a 3-minute break,Click\u2026He heard a noise behind the sliding door. Jin immediately stood up in surprise and focused his senses.It was the sound of the glass coffin opening.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 \u2013 Black Dragon Murakan (2)During the past 2 months he had spent transcribing the books underground, the only sounds that resounded down there were that of his pencil scribbling on paper and the occasional wind blowing.Therefore, despite being separated by the sliding door, Jin instinctively knew that Murakan\u2019s glass coffin was opening. Anyone else in Jin\u2019s situation would\u2019ve come to the same conclusion.\u2018Goddammit. Why is Murakan waking up now of all times?!\u2019Badump! Badump!His heart accelerated like crazy as if it had lost complete control over itself.The calm and safe Storm Castle\u2019s underground area had suddenly become menacing and hazardous. A chill ran up his spine as cold sweat slid down his face.\u2018Could it be\u2026 that I misheard it?\u2019As silence ensued, Jin began to doubt his ears. The previous sound could\u2019ve been something else, or Jin might\u2019ve imagined it from the beginning.However, his hopes were destroyed, as another\u00a0click\u00a0rang beyond the sliding door.As a matter of fact, that wasn\u2019t the only noise this time. He could hear clothes brushing against the glass coffin, along with the sound of someone\u2019s feet touching the ground.There was no way the dragon who had been sleeping for 1000 years was suddenly sleepwalking. It could only have woken up for a clear reason and purpose.Or it could be that its slumber was finally over, and that the timing was a complete coincidence.\u2018Calm down, calm down. I\u2019ve never offended Murakan before. It shouldn\u2019t be hostile against me\u2026\u2019He didn\u2019t remember Murakan waking up in his past life.There\u2019s no way Jin couldn\u2019t have heard of the news of Murakan\u2019s awakening, especially since he was still living in the Storm Castle back then as well.\u2018In that case, this incident is because of my return in time. My guess is that Murakan woke up because of my constant appearance here.\u2019There was a famous story around the continent. It said that one shouldn\u2019t disturb a sleeping dragon. Otherwise, one\u2019s life would be forfeited.Needless to say, despite being a famous story, people rarely came across dragons in real life.In any case, the moral of the story was that\u2026Dragons have terrible personalities.\u201cHey.\u201dFlinch.A low and deep voice reached Jin from behind the door. Jin was still pondering on how to survive this situation.A few chaotic seconds went by. He made up his mind on how to behave towards Murakan.\u2018Be respectful yet brazen. Even if Murakan tries to attack me\u2026 I just need to buy time until the knights arrive.\u2019But that was only for the worst case scenario.And even if the worst case scenario were to occur, Jin was confident that he could survive with his life intact at the very least. He could easily buy time with Solderet\u2019s spiritual power, his own magic, and his silver tongue.It was unlikely that he would die.As soon as he reached that conclusion, the stress weighing down on his shoulders eased up. Murakan could also be different from what he imagined. The dragon could be friendly with him instead of being hostile.Sccrt.Jin stood up and slid the door open to face Murakan.The black-haired handsome young man he saw every day in the coffin was now standing straight before him. The dragon\u2019s human body was toned, and one would never believe that he had been asleep for over 1000 years.\u201cR-Runcandel\u2019s descendent\u2026 greets the clan\u2019s guardian.\u201dJin deliberately stuttered and spoke nervously.He believed that he should act like a child who was afraid of the thousand-year-old dragon. Moreover, the Runcandels used to call Murakan their \u2018guardian\u2019, so Jin decided to emphasize that word.\u201cHa!\u201dMurakan snorted.\u201cGuardiannnn? Guardian? Did you just say \u2018guardian\u2019? Huh?\u201dWoooong!All he had done was speak out loud, but the mana inside the room began to tremble and spin around like a vortex.\u201cSay that again, you shitty brat. Did you just say that I\u2019m your clan\u2019s guardian?\u201dMurakan\u2019s body disappeared into a handful of black smoke, only to materialize right before his eyes.\u201cAre you not Lord Murakan? I\u2019ve been told that the Black Dragon Murakan is the Runcandel Clan\u2019s guardian.\u201dWhen Jin answered properly, Murakan stared at him and blinked several times. He felt like there was no need to stutter and act scared anymore.\u201cSigh, I see. Those damned Runcandel bastards\u2026 So that\u2019s what you told your descendants. Haha! And it\u2019s not like I can take out my anger on this chestnut-sized kid. This is driving me crazy!\u201dJin was relieved after hearing the dragon\u2019s reply.\u2018Looks like he\u2019s not completely merciless against children.\u2019Nevertheless, the murderous intent within the dragon\u2019s black irides were an indication of his character.If Jin were in his original 28-year-old body, Murakan would\u2019ve broken a limb or two without hesitation before continuing the conversation.\u2018But why on earth did the black dragon wake up now? It doesn\u2019t seem to be because I\u2019ve been coming down here every day. Could there be some other reason\u2026? Ah, maybe it\u2019s because of Solderet\u2019s power?\u2019Spiritual power.The power of shadows.That was the only thing Jin could think of as the reason behind Murakan\u2019s awakening from his thousand-year slumber.Jin didn\u2019t use spiritual power outside of special circumstances. But there was always a subtle amount of spiritual energy swirling around him, an amount that humans wouldn\u2019t be able to detect.\u2018Come to think of it, the contractors of gods generally have a guardian dragon by their sides, other than certain exceptional cases\u2026\u2019Contractors of the God of Flames Sheenu received the favour of fire dragons, while contractors of the God of Wind Melzeyer are favoured by wind dragons.That was the reason why the Zipfel Clan was slightly more advanced than the Runcandel Clan. Officially speaking, the Zipfel Clan has more than 100 dragons under their command. Who knows how many more they have behind the scenes?While this was just Jin\u2019s hypothesis, depending on the outcome, this encounter between Jin and Murakan may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\u2018The only problem is that my theory may be wrong. Moreover, I\u2019ve never heard of a dragon whose attribute is similar to \u2018shadows\u2019\u2026\u2019The current patriarch of the Zipfel Clan is Kelliark Zipfel, the contractor of the God of Flames Sheenu. They say that he is very close with the fire dragon \u2018Kadun\u2019.The contractor of the God of Wind Melzeyer is the current second-in-command of the Zipfel Clan, and is famous for handling a wind dragon.According to these two examples, dragons try to look for contractors who have a similar attribute as them.However, Jin had never heard of a story associating Solderet with a dragon.Even during his conversations with Solderet in his first life, the topic of Murakan was never brought up.\u2018Let\u2019s test it out for now. Thankfully, this isn\u2019t the worst case scenario.\u2019If Murakan had truly woken up due to Jin\u2019s spiritual energy, then there was nothing for him to be afraid of.Sssssst\u2026Hmph!Murakan suddenly took in a deep breath, just like a dog who got a whiff of something delicious, or a heavy smoker who finally managed to light a cigarette.\u201cHa\u2026 Anyways. This child isn\u2019t to blame for any of that. Hmm\u2026 This energy smells nice. For some reason, it makes me feel great! What\u2019s your name, kid?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Jin Runcandel, Lord Murakan.\u201d\u201cGood, good. Jin, you say? Honestly, I couldn\u2019t care less about your name. You\u2019re a Runcandel, right? Then lead me to Solderet\u2019s contractor right away.\u201d\u201cSolderet\u2019s contractor?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! This deep energy\u2026 Only the contractor could have such strong spiritual energy. I just hope this contractor isn\u2019t as rude as Temar, that son of a bitch.\u201dTemar Runcandel.The name of the first patriarch.Jin almost accidentally cried out in joy.It seemed his second life was going to be smooth sailing. To think that his earlier questions and concerns would be answered and resolved so quickly!\u2018It\u2019s certain now. He woke up because of the spiritual energy! Moreover, his reaction\u2026 It means that I\u2019m the one in power in this relationship!\u2019Sniff, sniff. Sniff!Murakan was now completely ignoring Jin. He closed his eyes and focused on sensing the energy.Meanwhile, Jin pondered for a moment.\u2018Should I tell him I\u2019m the contractor? Or should I say that I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about?\u2019The first option would be preferable. With the first option, Jin would be able to order Murakan around like a servant in the future.The second option would be a lot more troublesome. If Jin acted ignorant, the dragon would tell him to bring an adult of the clan. And if Jin did bring an adult down here, he would have to explain how this situation occurred in the first place.In that scenario, he would have to kiss these peaceful days goodbye. He wouldn\u2019t be able to transcribe any more books. Moreover, his fateful encounter with Murakan would have amounted to nothing.Fwoosh.A small ball of energy that danced like flames appeared on Jin\u2019s palm.\u201cSniff!\u00a0Hm! Oooh! It\u2019s like my mind is getting clearer\u2026 Huh?\u201dMurakan savoured the energy\u2019s scent before opening his eyes. Immediately, he couldn\u2019t hide his surprise.\u201cIt seems that I\u2019m the contractor you\u2019re looking for, Lord Murakan.\u201d\u201cY-Y-Y-Y-You? Impossible. This is madness! Solderet made a contract with a kid like you?\u201dMurakan began to retreat in fear. He almost fell down from tripping on his own feet, as the panic in him began to grow.\u201cThis is crazy. Unacceptable. Oi, Solderet! You\u2019re listening, right? Did you finally go batshit? Explain yourself!\u201dWhile Murakan was freaking out, Jin created a second cluster of shadows on his other hand.\u201cMy father told me that this power was given to me by the being who brought shadows into this world.\u201d\u201cUrgh.\u201dThump.Murakan fell on his behind and looked up at Jin.Silence ensued. Jin wanted to continue their conversation, but the mood wasn\u2019t right. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to do so when he saw Murakan\u2019s composure fall apart in real time.Denial. Anger. Doubt. Fear. Surrender.His expressions were changing in that exact order.\u201cOi\u2026 Solderet. This is a joke, right? This isn\u2019t right. Say something. Why is the promised contractor of a thousand years this kid\u2026\u2026?\u201dSolderet never showed himself.His silence was also one of Jin\u2019s concerns.Back when they had made their contract, the two used to chat like good friends. But ever since right before his death, Solderet never spoke to Jin again to this day.In any case, it seemed Murakan needed some time to accept this reality.However, he was a dragon.Despite his short temper and wicked personality, he was still a dragon who had lived for thousands of years. He had a keen insight, along with an indomitable spirit that wouldn\u2019t despair at unexpected situations.Murakan soon ended up accepting this absurd situation. That was the most he could do right now.\u201cSigh\u2026 Kid.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt seems that you\u2019re the individual with whom I must adjust my breath, as according to my promise with Solderet.\u201dA dragon\u2019s breath!A dragon had personally declared as such to Jin. And it was Murakan, the black dragon the first patriarch had defeated, to boot!Back when he was a magician, his heart used to beat so loudly whenever he heard rumours of magicians fighting side by side with a dragon.Jin\u2019s nose began to itch as his emotions intensified. He couldn\u2019t control the heat rising to his face in excitement, so he ended up lowering his head.\u201cUm, by adjusting your breath, you mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 You\u2019re still too young to understand the details. And I\u2019m not in the right mind to explain it to you right now.\u201dJin silently nodded at his answer.\u201cFirst and foremost, as a friend of Solderet\u2019s, allow me to formally introduce myself to Solderet\u2019s contractor.\u201dWhoosh\u2026A heavy wind blew in the room. A dark energy began to form in the air and swirled around Murakan\u2019s body.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe was transforming into his dragon form. The dark energy covering Murakan expanded like a cloud, and a huge black dragon that completely filled up the underground room entered Jin\u2019s vision.[I am Murakan. Solderet\u2019s proxy as well as his friend. The last descendant of the first being to be created from shadows. Following the thousand-year promise, I shall be your life-long partner from today onwards. State your name.]A grandiose voice shook the room. The hot-tempered attitude from earlier was nowhere to be found.\u201cI am Jin Runcandel. Thirteenth and final child of the Runcandels.\u201dJin answered as he barely repressed his trembling heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 \u2013 Until I Turn Ten (1)Fun.Every day is so fun.It\u2019s been about 6 months since the encounter with Murakan. Jin turned 8 years old and transcribed a total of 50 secret tomes.Today is the day the Tona twins leave the Storm Castle.\u2018Now no one will be bothering me for the next 2 years.\u2019Jin thought as he stared out the window, watching the servants pack the twins\u2019 luggage in the carriage.Ever since the day he pummelled them in the hallway and left them out by the bird\u2019s grave, the Tona twins never bothered him again. The servants delightfully call that incident the \u2018Revenge of the Bird\u2019, as they weren\u2019t very fond of the twins either. Jin wasn\u2019t the only one who was harassed by them in the past.But ever since that day, Jin\u2019s older brothers were obedient and would listen to his every word. He could order them around and treat them like servants, which was quite practical.However, the existence of their nanny \u2018Emma\u2019 was disturbing. She would outright monitor Jin while pretending to be friendly with him.\u2018Within another few months, that shrewd woman would\u2019ve tried to follow me when I\u2019d go \u2018meditate\u2019 at the grave. I can\u2019t have her discover that I\u2019ve been going underground, so it\u2019s perfect that she\u2019s leaving now.\u2019To this day, Jin viciously ignored Emma and cut her off whenever she tried to approach him. Her true intentions were as clear as day.On the outside, she wanted him to get along with the Tona twins.But deep down, she was hoping for Jin to fall from grace and be trampled on by the twins.\u2018Emma\u2019s disturbing gaze will finally be no more. If something like this happens again in the future, I\u2019ll have to take action and deal with her.\u2019Until this day, Emma hadn\u2019t bared her fangs or backstabbed Jin openly.Despite that, Jin decided to give Emma a farewell gift that would haunt her for the rest of her life.\u201cYoung Master, you must go bid farewell to your brothers now.\u201d\u201cAlright, Gilly. Let\u2019s go.\u201dThe two of them descended to the Storm Castle\u2019s courtyard.Under the constant downpour, the knights who had come to escort the Tona twins to the main house were standing in silence.One 7-star guardian knight, and five 6-star guardian knights. They were all part of the Runcandel\u2019s main house.The twins were at the center, wearing relieved smiles as they would finally be distanced from their devilish brother.\u201cElder brothers.\u201d\u201cAh, yeah, Jin.\u201d\u201cH-Hey.\u201dAs Jin spoke to them with a large grin, his brothers tensed up.\u201cWhy are you so surprised? I\u2019m just here to see you off.\u201d\u201cThanks\u2026\u201d\u201cThanks\u2026 Jin!\u201d\u201cI guess I won\u2019t be seeing you for another two years. That\u2019s too bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201dDespite not agreeing with him, the Tona twins furiously nodded their heads.After patting them on the shoulders, Jin then turned to Emma.\u201cStay safe too, Nanny Emma.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Young Master.\u201d\u201cCould you bend down for a bit?\u201dEmma lowered herself to match Jin\u2019s eye level. He then approached her ear and whispered.\u2018Emma. I hope you act with a bit more caution at the main house.\u2019As soon as her brain processed the meaning behind his words, Emma\u2019s face paled into a deathly white hue.When she realized that this 8-year-old child had fully noticed her actions and hidden intentions, a jolting chill ran down her spine.Her throat squeezed up, and she couldn\u2019t respond to him. Nevertheless, Emma somehow forced her body to move and bowed to Jin, while trying to conceal her trembling.\u201cWe must depart now. Young Master Jin, I shall await with impatience to see your dignified appearance in 2 years!\u201d\u201cVery well.\u201dThe knights raised their swords to salute Jin before departing.They then got on the carriage waiting at the bottom of Mt. Murakan and headed to the Runcandel main house, the \u2018Garden of Swords\u2019.Jin would also head there in another 2 years.***\u201cBlasted kid! Explain yourself already. An explanation that I can understand.\u201dThe Storm Castle\u2019s underground area.Murakan expressed his frustrations to Jin as he grabbed the basket Jin had brought. The 8-year-old boy lightly brushed off his words and moved to the shelf.\u201cHow\u2026 How can this be\u2026 Why is there only one strawberry pie in the basket? Are you looking down on the Great Murakan?\u201dMurakan was angry\u2026 because of a strawberry pie.\u201cAh, geez. Be thankful you at least have one pie. I had to save some of my share.\u201d\u201cDo you truly believe a dragon would feel full from a single measly pie?!\u201d\u2018Well, I didn\u2019t believe dragons could become furious because of strawberry pies\u2026 but now I do.\u2019The \u2018strawberry pie\u2019 was the first gourmet food Murakan had eaten in a thousand years.It was also the only food that could satiate his stomach, tongue, and mind in this underground chamber since he was still \u2018trapped down here\u2019.\u201cDon\u2019t you feel full even without food thanks to my spiritual energy? Enough with that nonsense of yours.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 you heartless brat! Don\u2019t you know that dragons are very picky gourmets? And not only am I unable to leave this stuffy place because of your circumstances, now you won\u2019t give me extra strawberry pies?\u201dMurakan hadn\u2019t left the underground chamber ever since his awakening.It was all for Jin. He needed to hide his connection with Murakan until he was strong enough, and Murakan also believed that was the correct choice.The underground chamber was only accessible to the \u2018flag-bearers\u2019.If the clan learned that Jin had been sneaking down here in order to copy the secret tomes, Cyron would most probably ask Murakan to take responsibility as well\u2014even if he were the clan\u2019s guardian deity who had awoken from a thousand-year slumber.In other words, Jin and Murakan were accomplices of the same crime.\u201cHa! You and that gourmet tongue of yours! You\u2019re the one who said you didn\u2019t like any of the food I brought other than the pie. Do you think it\u2019s so easy to airlift strawberries to this Storm Castle?\u201dJin also wanted to give a piece of his mind about this topic.Not only was there a constant downpour at the castle regardless of seasons, it was also located at the peak of Mt. Murakan. It wasn\u2019t a simple task to supply the castle with fresh strawberries.Moreover, this gourmet black dragon said that all the other food at the Storm Castle was\u2026 trash, and only asked for Gilly\u2019s strawberry pie.\u201cGoddammit\u2026 Is this an era where people can\u2019t even eat strawberry pies properly?\u201d\u201cThere are only 2 years left of this \u2018era\u2019 you speak of, so finish eating that already. Let\u2019s begin training.\u201d\u201cIt also seems to be an era where rude kids mess around with powerful black dragons.\u201dMunch.In the end, Murakan yielded. It wasn\u2019t as if a non-existing strawberry pie would appear out of thin air just because he got mad at the kid.\u201cDelicious\u2026 Damn, this is crazy delicious. Did you say your nanny cooked it? You must definitely introduce me to her when I get out of here.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah, you already said that dozens of times.\u201dJin replied as he shook his head in exasperation.During the past 6 months, Jin\u2019s vision of dragons was completely destroyed by the slob before him.The legendary dragons he had imagined during his days as a magician\u2026 The wise, majestic, mysterious yet powerful beings\u2026But the dragon before him was childish, extremely whimsical, and a complete slob. He would always be lying down, scratching his groins as he complained about something.Scratch, scratch.Having devoured the strawberry pie in an instant, Murakan was once again scratching an\u2026 odd place.\u2018The only thing that my imagination was correct about is\u2026 how powerful dragons are, maybe\u2026?\u2019Ever since the day after their first encounter, Murakan began to teach Jin how to manipulate spiritual power along with several types of martial arts.Despite having never fought him in person, Jin could sense how strong Murakan was through his teachings and guidance.However, most of Murakan\u2019s strength was currently sealed because Jin\u2019s \u2018spiritual energy\u2019 was still too weak. Spiritual energy was a necessity to Murakan\u2019s strength and survival, just like how the sun was necessary to plants, and how aquatic life forms needed the sea to survive.In other words, Jin was like the sun to Murakan. An irreplaceable existence.However, it was a sun that needed to grow stronger. In order for Murakan\u2019s full strength to return, Jin had to grow older and become more powerful.\u201cDo that transcription thing for 30 minutes, then come to the hallway.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter finishing the transcription, Jin left and entered the hallway to face Murakan.\u201cWhat did you copy today?\u201d\u201cThe Attila Clan\u2019s book of swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cOh! Attila. Their swordsmanship was pretty decent. Reminds me of how I sunk my teeth into their patriarch and killed him about 1500 years ago. Did you understand some of it?\u201d\u201cAbout 30% of the content. I didn\u2019t quite get the rest of it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be discouraged. It\u2019s still incredible that you understood 30% of it at your age.\u201dHaving comprehended about 30% of the Attila Clan\u2019s secret book at the tender age of 8 was an enormous feat.However, Jin was craving for more. The \u2018enormous feat\u2019 was according to the Runcandel standards. But with this being his second life, Jin wanted to achieve far more than just that.If he couldn\u2019t exceed the normal genius standard, he would once again be unable to overpower his 12 genius siblings.\u201cHow much of this book would the first patriarch have understood at my age?\u201d\u201cKuhaha. Right, right. You did say that you chose Temar\u2019s sword during the Selection Ritual. Is that why you keep comparing yourself to him?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve heard people endlessly say that the first patriarch was the \u2018strongest man in history\u2019. So much that the phrase is engraved in my mind now. That\u2019s why I\u2019m comparing myself to him.\u201d\u201cThe strongest man in history, you say\u2026 Fair enough. Temar truly was incredibly strong. Even your father, who\u2019s called the True Holy Knight, is probably one level weaker than Temar.\u201dThat was a realm of strength that Jin couldn\u2019t even imagine.Despite Jin\u2019s rapid growth speed during his final 3 years of life after making a contract with Solderet, he still had a long way to go to reach the True Holy Knight realm. Even if he became an \u2018unparalleled magic swordsman\u2019 like Solderet had said, Jin still wasn\u2019t sure if he could defeat his father.\u201cHm, sure. Alright. I guess it would be best to make it clear.\u201d\u201cMake what clear?\u201d\u201cThe difference between you and Temar.\u201dJin nodded as he focused on Murakan\u2019s next words.\u201cAt the age of 8, Temar would not have been able to understand a single sentence in that book.\u201dA short pause followed, before Murakan continued speaking.\u201cBut one\u2019s talents cannot always be measured by one\u2019s knowledge and understanding of swordsmanship. From what I\u2019ve seen, you are quite gifted. In fact, you\u2019re like a genius that\u2019s born once every hundreds of years\u2026 However, you still can\u2019t compare to Temar.\u201d\u201cHm, that\u2019s somewhat disheartening.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure that your True Holy Knight father is far more gifted than you are.\u201d\u201cThen, will I never be able to overpower my father because of the disparity in our talents?\u201dTo overpower his father.That was the reborn Jin\u2019s biggest and most ambitious goal. If he couldn\u2019t win against Cyron, Jin would have no choice but to live while trying not to stand out again, so that he doesn\u2019t incur the Runcandels\u2019 wrath.The pathetic death in his first life.Three 9-star knights who had attacked the Akin Kingdom. Jin\u2019s hypothesis was that Cyron had secretly dispatched those three, even though he strongly wished it were false.\u201cIndeed, you won\u2019t win against your father if it purely comes to swordsmanship.\u201d\u201cIf it purely comes to swordsmanship?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, you brat. Don\u2019t think that the world solely revolves around swordsmanship. You also have spiritual power and magic at your disposal.\u201d\u201cTrue enough.\u201d\u201cIf you master magic and spiritual power to the extreme limits, it may be possible to become stronger than Temar, let alone your father. So don\u2019t be impatient.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not impatient. I just wanted to know my limits.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHa! You\u2019re still thinking about your \u2018limits\u2019 even after gaining Solderet\u2019s spiritual power? Maybe it\u2019s because you\u2019re still a kid. You\u2019re just too unaware. Solderet\u2019s nickname amongst the gods is\u2026 \u2018the Infinite\u2019.\u201d\u201cInfinite?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, infinite. The potential you have is far greater than anyone else in the world. It\u2019s infinite. Limitless. That\u2019s why, just focus on growing up for now. You have to leave this suffocating place and explore the world in order to experience life.\u201d\u201cIn that case, what\u2019s today\u2019s training about?\u201d\u201cReleasing your spiritual energy. You can always learn the basics of martial arts later on. So from today onwards, till the day you leave the Storm Castle, you will only train your spiritual powers.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 \u2013 Until I Turn Ten (2)Translator \u2013 KokonutMilkProofreader \u2013 yukitokataAside from aura and mana, there are some people in this world who wield other special powers\u2014although they are few and far between. Amongst these \u2018special powers\u2019, spiritual power is the rarest of them all.And the beings who control spiritual power can be separated into two categories.Those who were born from Solderet, just like Murakan, and people who made a contract with the god, just like Jin.During his prime, Murakan could use spiritual power to fend off five 9-star magicians simultaneously without having to escape. Jin couldn\u2019t even picture the dragon\u2019s full power.In other words, now that Solderet was refusing to show himself, Murakan was the perfect teacher for Jin.\u201cPeople like you and me who can use spiritual power can release spiritual energy. It\u2019s the first and last technique we need to know.\u201d\u201cFirst and last?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a basic technique yet also a lethal move. The principle is easy. It\u2019s similar to how a magician uses mana.\u201dWhen magicians reached the 3-star stage, they could release mana.In other words, if someone could release mana, they had reached the 3-star stage. Since Jin was a 5-star magician in his past life, releasing mana was a piece of cake for him.However, while Murakan knew that Jin had \u2018mana\u2019 within him, he didn\u2019t know that the child had the \u2018knowledge and skills of a 5-star magician\u2019.Jin had yet to tell the dragon about his rebirth, and he wasn\u2019t planning on telling anyone from here on out.\u201cBut as far as I know, magicians don\u2019t use mana release as a lethal move\u2026 do they?\u201d\u201cJust because they both use the word \u2018release\u2019 and are similar in style doesn\u2019t mean mana release is on the same level as releasing spiritual energy.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201d\u201cIn any case, before you learn how to release spiritual energy, you must learn how to release mana first.\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201dAt Jin\u2019s question, Murakan simply shrugged.\u201cYou need to begin with learning the easier techniques. Would you try to learn how to swing a steel sword when you can\u2019t even lift a wooden one?\u201d\u201cAha.\u201dJin nodded as he grasped the meaning, despite his reluctance. He had already mastered how to release mana in his previous life, so he was feeling impatient\u2026\u2018Oh well, I should just think of this as a revision. I haven\u2019t tried to release mana ever since my regression either, so this is a good opportunity.\u2019Once Murakan sat straight before Jin, he suddenly burst out in laughter.\u201cPffft hahaha\u2026 How amusing. I never would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d teach magic to a Runcandel child. If your father ever finds out about this, you and I are both as good as dead.\u201dLearning magic as a Runcandel signified treason.Most martial clans disliked magic, but not many of them despised the very thought of magic as much as the Runcandel Clan. Ever since the death of the first patriarch, the Runcandels considered magic and its usage a taboo within the clan.The clan members\u2019 thought process was that if one learned magic, one wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the pinnacle of swordsmanship. In actuality, several magic swordsmen had appeared throughout history, but none of them achieved incredible feats. They slowly disappeared and all traces of them vanished.It was the same for the magic clans.While magic clans didn\u2019t ban martial arts, they highly looked down upon the usage of \u2018aura\u2019. It was believed that aura would dirty and muddy the purity of mana.However, these beliefs were flawed.The true reason why the Runcandels had banned magic was due to a humiliating and disgraceful pledge made with the Zipfels a thousand years ago.During the era when Temar was still alive, the Runcandels were a clan of \u2018magic swordsmen\u2019.Back then, the Runcandel Clan wasn\u2019t as famous as it was today, and history wasn\u2019t as distorted and fabricated.The only ones who were aware of this truth were Jin\u2014the regressor and Solderet\u2019s contractor\u2014and Murakan, along with some key figures of the Runcandel and Zipfel Clans.\u201cMy father will kill us when he realizes I learned magic from you? Not if he kills me before that for secretly coming down here without authorization.\u201d\u201cIndeed. If what you\u2019ve told me about your father is true, then I have no doubt he\u2019d kill you. Since we are accomplices, let me tell you a secret before we begin training. The people around the world believe that despite being rare, \u2018magic swordsmen\u2019 can never become truly powerful, right?\u201d\u201cThey certainly do, oddly enough.\u201dJin pretended to be ignorant, to which Murakan chuckled.\u201cThat\u2019s all bullshit! It\u2019s a lie made up by those Zipfel morons who are far more evil than the Runcandels. While you need a precondition to achieve it, magic swordsmen are the ultimate powerhouses. Your clan was once a venerable and respected clan of magic swordsmen.\u201d\u201cReally? First time hearing this story.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you not surprised?\u201dMurakan asked in a disappointed voice. Albeit belatedly, Jin let out a gasp and wowed at the dragon, who just shook his head at the child\u2019s terrible acting.\u201cHaha, nothing could ever top the surprise I felt the day I met you. Anyways, you said something about a precondition?\u201d\u201cGeez, you really aren\u2019t cute at all, kid. So, you need to have a great affinity with mana, sensitivity to aura, and an excellent physical body. Oh, and a contract with a god.\u201d\u201cSo I already cleared the conditions.\u201d\u201cNow that you understand, there\u2019s no need to be afraid of learning magic from here on out. But promise me one thing, kid. You must never reveal your magic to the clan until you\u2019re strong enough.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to make me promise that. I already know of the potential consequences. I\u2019ve only just turned eight, and I don\u2019t plan on biting the dust anytime soon.\u201d\u201cGood, good. Then from now on, your objective in life is to stand at the summit\u2014stronger than anyone else\u2014in order to let me live comfortably and in luxury. Let\u2019s begin training now. First, let\u2019s try to stimulate and awaken your mana. Hm, in order to do that, you need to\u2026\u201dVwwooong.Jin created a mana sphere the size of a walnut on top of his palm, and Murakan could only stare in disbelief.\u201cThis crazy twat\u2026 What in the world? How could you do that in a second? You didn\u2019t even let me finish explaining!\u201dJin also couldn\u2019t hide his surprise.He was planning on holding back and showing the dragon only the bare minimum in order to satisfy him, but had created the mana sphere subconsciously. It was more difficult to minutiously control the body of an 8-year-old compared to that of a 28-year-old.Moreover, he hadn\u2019t used magic in a long time, which was another cause of this mistake.Before Jin could come up with an excuse, Murakan clenched his fists tightly and stood up.\u201cI see, Solderet! I finally understand why you chose him as your contractor after a thousand years! Kuhaha, he\u2019s really something. He\u2019s truly unbelievable! Kid, you make my heart beat so fast in excitement!\u201dThe mistake seemed to have benefited Jin.In order to continue his childish act, Jin scratched the back of his head and wore an awkward smile.\u201cIs this something that impressive?\u201d\u201cIs that even a question? I\u2019ve only ever seen three people succeed in creating a mana sphere so early in their childhood! The first time was with the Zipfel Clan\u2019s first patriarch, the second was with the fourth patriarch. And finally, you!\u201dMurakan began to recount the story of how the first and fourth Zipfel patriarchs had achieved this feat at the tender ages of 5 and 7, respectively. However, Jin wasn\u2019t very inspired by the story.Because he was the same as them.Jin, along with those two patriarchs, were all \u2018magic geniuses\u2019 in its truest meaning.Before his regression, Jin had become a 5-star magician within 3 years. And since he had managed to make a contract with Solderet, Jin was potentially even more talented than those two acclaimed magicians.\u2018If I were born in the Zipfel Clan during my first life, I would\u2019ve reached the 8-star stage, at the very least, by 28 years old. Maybe even the 9-star stage.\u2019Murakan finally ended his maniacal laughter.\u201cKid. Honestly, I thought it would take you at least a few years in order to learn how to release spiritual energy. But at this rate, you might be able to succeed before you leave the Storm Castle. Let\u2019s move onto the next phase immediately!\u201dThe next lesson was on mana transfer. It was a basic technique which required one to extinguish the mana on one hand, and move it to the other with pinpoint accuracy.Learning this technique was a piece of cake for Jin once again, but he had to control himself and hold back this time.Now that Murakan held high expectations towards Jin, there was no need to increase it even further. Otherwise, Murakan\u2019s overwhelming yet unbearable expectations would become a burden to Jin, and could come back to bite him later on in life.Additionally, even though his earlier mistake benefited Jin this time, the fact that he made the mistake was important and alarming. In order to gain the skills and techniques to control mana as proficient as his previous life, he had to train repeatedly, even for the basic techniques.Jin listened to Murakan\u2019s explanation and attempted to transfer the mana on his right hand to his left.\u2018Hm\u2026 I should fail on purpose for a while before succeeding. 10 minutes should be enough.\u201910 minutes later, Jin successfully transferred the mana on his right hand to his left accurately. Murakan then grinned widely.Droplets of sweat began forming on Jin\u2019s forehead. It was actually more difficult for him to purposefully perform an easy technique a lot slower, just like how lifting a heavy object slowly was more taxing compared to lifting it quickly.\u201cGood. Excellent work. If you manage to complete this procedure within 5 seconds, you should be able to release mana. In other words, you\u2019ll have become a 3-star magician.\u201d\u201cHow long do you think it will take me to achieve that?\u201dJin asked as he wiped his sweat away.\u201c2 years.\u201dHearing the answer, Jin decided that achieving it in 1 year would be convincing enough.Having finished the calculations in his mind, Jin nodded to the dragon.\u201cGood. Then practice mana transfer for a bit more and then head back up for today. And just in case, don\u2019t practice within the castle when I\u2019m not with you.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAfter training for another hour, it was time for Jin to return to the surface. As he packed up his notebooks and the basket, Murakan lied back down on the floor, scratching his groins.\u201cOh also, kid. When you come by tomorrow, make sure to fill that basket to the brim with strawberry pies. Otherwise, I\u2019ll make sure you know of the consequences.\u201dMurakan warned Jin as he began walking away.\u201cThe strawberry pie you ate earlier was the last of it. Do you have any idea how many strawberries you ate during the past 6 months?\u201d\u201cGoddammit, then bring me another type of pie your nanny bakes!\u201d\u201cThen what about a rat pie?\u201d\u201cYou wretched brat, come here and have a taste of my fist\u2026 Hey, hey! Hey!\u201dSwoosh!Jin dashed out the hole connected to the underground corridor.\u201cSomething other than rats! Please! I\u2019m begging you!\u201dWhen Jin returned the next day, his basket was full of apple pies instead.Murakan was satisfied and stroked the child\u2019s head.A year went by. Today was September 9th, 1789. Jin\u2019s ninth birthday.Spending their birthdays at the Storm Castle\u2014which was stormy and wet all year round\u2014wasn\u2019t good for children\u2019s mental and emotional growth.As a dozen servants and Gilly, along with 5 knights, placed candles on the cake, the fierce gale outside was smashing into the castle windows.\u201cHappy birthday, Young Master Jin.\u201d\u201cHappy birthday!\u201d\u201cThank you, everyone.\u201dAs the 9-year-old blew on the candle flames, everyone gathered around him and clapped.Clang, clang, clang, clang.Since the knights were wearing gauntlets, their powerful \u2018clapping\u2019 noises overpowered everyone else\u2019s. The birthday party was bleak and desolate, as if they were mere commoners who couldn\u2019t afford a lavishing meal.Despite this, Jin was still overjoyed and felt blessed. In his previous life, he hadn\u2019t even received greetings from the people living in the castle for his birthday, other than his nanny.As Gilly sliced the cake and gave everyone a piece, the lone knight who was guarding the Storm Castle\u2019s main entrance suddenly barged in the room.\u201cYoung Master Jin!\u201dIt was the guardian knight called Khan.\u201cKhan?\u201dThere weren\u2019t many situations in which Khan would dare to run within the castle hallways.Jin\u2019s intuition told him that someone from the clan\u2019s main house had come to visit.\u201cThe eldest lady has come to visit!\u201d\u201cElder sister Luna\u2026?\u201dJin exclaimed as he stood up.Jin\u2019s eldest sister, Luna Runcandel.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe firstborn of Cyron Runcandel\u2019s 13 children. It was a well-established fact that she was the strongest out of all the siblings. At her current age of 28, she became a 9-star knight, which proved the previous assumption.However, despite her strength and fame, she never participated in the Runcandel\u2019s \u2018War of Succession\u2019\u2014a hideous and unsightly competition for the throne\u2014in Jin\u2019s first life, and always moved on her own.\u2018She\u2019s not the type of person to come congratulate her younger sibling on his birthday. Why is she here\u2026?\u2019Jin ran to the window and looked outside. Luna was taking large strides as she walked up the stairs leading to the Storm Castle.On her back was her emblematic sword: the enormous chopsword, \u2018Crantel\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 \u2013 Until I Turn Ten (3)Luna and Jin had an age gap of 19 years, which was to no surprise as they were respectively Cyron and Rosa\u2019s first and last children.With such a large age gap, there are many cases where the older sibling dotes on the younger one\u2026 But that wasn\u2019t the case for Jin in his first life.And so, with Luna\u2019s sudden visit, Jin was more panicked than joyful.\u2018This is somewhat concerning. Has my eldest sister ever shown interest in our other siblings as well?\u2019Despite rummaging through his memories, Jin couldn\u2019t remember a similar event in the past.The nickname the public used to call Luna was the \u2018White Whale\u2019.She was aloof, distant, and hard to get in touch with just like the \u2018White Whale\u2019 in the myths. And since there was only a single white whale in the world, the nickname also reflected her anti-social tendencies.\u201cGreetings to the eldest lady!\u201d\u201cGreetings to the eldest lady!\u201dThe knights who were gathered for Jin\u2019s birthday all ran outside and shouted in unison.Even though she had yet to enter the castle, the servants in the dining room also began to bow in advance.\u201cLet\u2019s head downstairs to welcome my sister, Nanny.\u201dGilly was dumbfounded and staring into nothingness. Having the opportunity to meet the clan\u2019s eldest child was rare, yet extremely nerve-wracking.\u201cAh, yes, Young Master.\u201dJin and Luna came face to face in the central hall. It was the child\u2019s first time seeing his eldest sister ever since the Selection Ritual.Dazzling silver hair, porcelain-like skin, and\u2026 deep eyes that appeared to pierce through everything in their vision.Luna\u2019s deep gaze contained an inexplicable sense of danger and menace. Those were the eyes of someone who had slain myriads of powerful warriors around the world as she slowly approached the realm of a sword emperor.As they made eye contact, Jin\u2019s heart began beating furiously.\u2018So this is the gaze of someone who\u2019s close to being the world\u2019s strongest\u2026\u2019However, Jin hadn\u2019t the leisure to admire her forever. He couldn\u2019t put aside the possibility that she had come all this way as she had somehow sensed Murakan\u2019s awakening.If that were the case, Jin had to come up with a solution to his pinch.As he racked his brain, Luna appeased the knights around them by speaking out first.\u201cYou\u2019ve grown a lot.\u201dA cold and dry voice. It wasn\u2019t a tone suitable to address a sibling she hadn\u2019t seen in 8 years.However, Jin sensed a faint amount of goodwill within that dry voice. Nonetheless, it was far too early for him to let down his guard.\u201cThank you for coming all this way. We would\u2019ve prepared a far more suitable feast had you notified us in advance, Elder Sister.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s cute. But there\u2019s no need for such hospitality when I\u2019m simply visiting my younger brother.\u201dLuna replied as she patted her brother\u2019s head.To think that his eldest sister\u2014with whom he had barely talked to in his past life\u2014was patting him\u2026 Jin couldn\u2019t understand what was happening.\u2018Just why? Why? Why is she acting like this?\u2019The same question kept repeating itself in his mind.When Cyron had come to visit, everything occurred as he had predicted, but he just simply couldn\u2019t read through Luna\u2019s true intentions.However, just because it was difficult didn\u2019t mean he had to stop trying. No matter how incredible of a fighter she was, Luna was still a 28-year-old lady.As for Jin, this was his 37th year alive in total, so there was no need to feel pressured.\u201cThat\u2019s true. There\u2019s no need for you to do that when you\u2019re merely travelling within Runcandel territory, Elder Sister. But honestly speaking\u2026 since I don\u2019t know you well enough, I was subconsciously feeling nervous and on edge.\u201dThe hand that was stroking Jin\u2019s head froze. Gilly was bewildered by Jin\u2019s honest statement and made a dry cough. Even the knights around them were staring in disbelief.Silence ensued. The surrounding people were sweating buckets as they watched the siblings stare at each other.\u201cYou were\u2026 nervous?\u201d\u201cYes, Sister.\u201d\u201cShould I interpret that as you being uncomfortable around me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not uncomfortable. It\u2019s just that since this is basically my first time meeting you\u2026\u201dAnother round of silence.The atmosphere around Luna was ambiguous.The knights and Gilly all thought that she would be furious, but it was the opposite. They could never have predicted the emotions they saw in the woman\u2019s deep ocean eyes.Sorrow, regret, and bitterness.Those were the emotions surfacing on Luna\u2019s face.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right, I was being inconsiderate. You may be young, but you\u2019re still a Runcandel. How could I forget that\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dEven Jin was taken by surprise by her reaction.Runcandel.This large clan of swordmasters wasn\u2019t a family where siblings would support and love each other, and sacrifice oneself for a brother or sister.Monitoring each other, stealing from each other, and dragging another down were the family traditions. Therefore, having heard Jin\u2019s explanation, Luna believed that the young child thought of her as an \u2018obstacle\u2019 and a \u2018hindrance\u2019.That was the reason behind her sorrowful gaze.\u201cGive us some space\u2026 Actually, nevermind. Can I ask your knights and nanny to leave the hall, Jin?\u201dLuna bent down and matched her eye-level with her brother\u2019s. Once Jin nodded, the knights and Gilly emptied the place.While he still couldn\u2019t read her true intentions, Jin believed that Luna didn\u2019t mean him any harm.\u201cMy youngest sibling.\u201d\u201cYes, Sister.\u201d\u201cThe reason I came looking for you so suddenly is because\u2026 I have something I must tell you. And today happened to be your birthday as well.\u201dJin let down his guard visibly.\u201cSomething to tell me\u2026?\u201d\u201cDue to Father\u2019s interest in you, all of our siblings are keeping an eye on you. And seeing your attitude today, it seems I don\u2019t need to explain what that signifies.\u201dEvery Runcandel was paying great attention to Jin.And it was to no surprise. It was widely known that Cyron had come all the way to the Storm Castle last year in order to see his youngest child.Moreover, Jin had chosen Barisada during his Selection Ritual, so it would be weirder if they weren\u2019t keeping an eye on him.\u201cYes, I am aware. You mean that once I leave the Storm Castle, our siblings will try to keep me in check, right?\u201dLuna removed the chopsword Crantel from her back and placed it on the floor.Thud!Despite her best attempt at being quiet, it still ended up creating a large echo in the hall.\u201cThat\u2019s right. So you know already. You must\u2019ve been on guard against me for that same reason as well.\u201dJin didn\u2019t answer and stared back into Luna\u2019s deep blue eyes.\u201cBut this is what I wanted to tell you. I truly hope\u2014from the bottom of my heart\u2014that you won\u2019t take part in this dirty family feud and let your happiness slip away from your grasp.\u201dHer words came crashing down on Jin\u2019s mind.\u2018Is this what Eldest Sister has been thinking all this time? Is this why\u2026 she didn\u2019t participate in the bloody succession war in my past life?\u2019Being the strongest of the siblings, Luna could easily take the throne from their other siblings.However, Jin didn\u2019t find her true intentions absurd or hard to believe. Luna did indeed steer away from the bloody succession war before, so there was a speck of credibility in her words. He was simply surprised from hearing those words from the person herself.But Jin still felt some revulsion towards her mindset.\u2018If you don\u2019t want to see me be sacrificed by our other siblings during the succession war, then why didn\u2019t you say anything back in my first life?\u2019Was it because he held no value at all back then, that she didn\u2019t bother warning him?Or was it because their other siblings didn\u2019t even consider Jin a dangerous opponent in the succession war?Such questions popped up in his mind, but they were not relevant in the situation at hand.\u201cElder Sister Luna.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI am very grateful for those words, but I do not intend on dropping out of the conflict.\u201dA polite yet resolute tone.\u201cI\u2019m being genuine here. I\u2019m not saying this because I fear you could surpass me, Jin.\u201d\u201cI am also aware of that, Elder Sister. I can see your pure intentions, and I am very grateful for that. I never expected a sibling of mine to be worried about me. But I don\u2019t plan on changing my mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then could I ask the reason behind your decision?\u201d\u201cYou may not know about this, but\u2026\u201dJin took in a deep breath before continuing his story.\u201cThere has already been an assassination attempt against me. I\u2019ve never talked about it to anyone else. Not even Gilly. And due to that incident, my fight has already begun.\u201dTechnically speaking, it wasn\u2019t an assassination attempt but rather a curse. However, the \u2018Bladed Illusion\u2019 curse was no different to a death sentence for a child living in the Runcandel Clan.\u201cWho dared to!\u201dRumble!At her shout, aura began to pour out of Luna\u2019s body, expanding in the empty hall. A rumbling shook the closed space as the aura swirled around in a whirlpool.\u201cA sibling of ours dared to attempt to kill you inside the Storm Castle?! Who was it? Was it the Tona twins?\u201d\u201cThat, I cannot tell you.\u201dDespite his dry response, Jin\u2019s heart and chest felt warm and content from seeing Luna get enraged for his sake.\u201cBut rather than being unwilling to tell you, I am incapable of answering that question, as there are many things I\u2019m unaware of as well.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dThere was no need to continue this conversation.Luna could only accept the fact that her youngest brother was already far too involved in the family feud to break free now.As Luna tried to sort out her mixed feelings, Jin carefully approached her and hugged her around the neck.\u201cBut I am extremely happy to have learned that not all of my siblings despise me and are after my life, Elder Sister.\u201d\u201cJin. My brother. This saddens me so deeply.\u201dWho could\u2019ve thought that the famous White Whale was such a sweet and tender sister.Jin no longer thought of her as a terrifying 9-star knight, but instead considered her a mere human being who was suffering within this messed up family.\u201cPlease don\u2019t be so dejected.\u201dAfter their conversation inside the hall, Luna stayed at the castle for another 2 hours before leaving. Jin\u2019s bleak and desolate birthday was brightened by his sister\u2019s presence.\u2018I never knew there was such a kind side to my eldest sister.\u2019Jin thought to himself as he touched the pendant around his neck.It was Luna\u2019s birthday present for him.\u2018She told me to break the gem on the pendant when I\u2019m in a critical situation I can\u2019t deal with.\u2019If he broke the deep blue gem on the pendant, Luna would be sent to Jin\u2019s location just once. She had obtained this artifact after killing a demon a while ago.\u201cOh, kid! That thing around your neck! Isn\u2019t that Demonic Beast King Orgal\u2019s pendant? It is! Dayum, you got yourself a priceless birthday present. Dozens of monarchs and rulers lost their lives trying to obtain that pendant a thousand years ago.\u201d\u201cDemonic Beast King Orgal? Who\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cAn incredible demon from back in the days. I could recognize that at a glance. I imagine you received it from the person with the powerful aura I sensed earlier. Damn, you basically have an extra life now. Congrats, kid.\u201dMurakan was aware of the pendant\u2019s effects.\u201cI can see that it\u2019s an amazing artifact. But Murakan, did you say \u2018powerful aura\u2019? You felt that from down here?\u201d\u201cOf course I did, brat. I may have lost a lot of my strength, but I\u2019m still a dragon. Who was it? I first thought it was your father, but seeing how they noticed me and still left without making a fuss, I imagine it was someone else.\u201d\u201cWhat? Wait a second. My eldest sister noticed you?\u201dThe bewildered Jin asked back.\u201cHaha, so that aura\u2019s owner was your sister? I see that this clan is still as crazy powerful as ever. I was even thinking of grabbing you and running away if things went south.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201d\u201cWell, seeing how she gave you Orgal\u2019s pendant, I don\u2019t think your sister will tell the other clan members about us. Today was a great day.\u201d\u201cSo you think my sister will just let it pass?\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI bet a hundred apple pies on that. If she were narrow-minded, she would never have given you that pendant in the first place. You have a great sister. Ugh, I\u2019m so jealous of you, kid. Whereas my sister is\u2026\u201dAs Murakan began describing his elder sister, Jin pondered on what to do if\u2014in the one in a million chance\u2014Luna decided to tell the clan about Murakan\u2019s existence.However, he soon remembered Luna\u2019s last words before leaving, and soon calmed down.\u2018I just want you to remember this, Jin. My brother. No matter what you do, no matter what you become, I will always be rooting for you.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 \u2013 Departing the Storm Castle (1)And so, another 6 months went by.March 12th, 1790. In the Mitel Kingdom\u2014located south of the Storm Castle\u2014spring was finally here. In another half a year, Jin would turn 10 years old and leave the Storm Castle.In the end, Luna never informed the clan about Murakan\u2019s existence, just as he had bet 100 apple pies on it.However, he didn\u2019t get a single apple pie for winning that bet as Jin also ended up betting that she wouldn\u2019t betray them. So technically, Jin had also won the wager.The past 6 months were a period of peace and boredom for the knights and servants working at the Storm Castle. On the other hand, it was a period of growth and development for Jin, for whom time went by in a flash.\u201cI\u2019m sick of this. I\u2019m so freaking sick of this.\u201dMurakan spoke as he stared blankly at the soon-to-be 10-year-old.\u201cNot only did you manage to reduce the time it takes you to transfer mana from 10 minutes to 5 seconds in a single year, you also learned how to release mana in half a year. And you act as if it\u2019s so easy to you! I can\u2019t believe my eyes.\u201dJust as Jin had planned, he mastered mana transfer in 1 year instead of the 2 years Murakan had predicted, and mastered mana release within the 6 months after Luna\u2019s visit.Jin successfully held himself back and learned how to fine-tune his control over mana. And that wasn\u2019t the only favourable result.In his past life, he rushed to quickly reach the 5-star stage within a mere 3 years, so he had no time to train and practice the basic techniques. Since he was already 25 years old by the time he began learning magic, he didn\u2019t have the leeway to take his time learning the basics.However, now that he had repeatedly practiced mana transfer while making sure he had full control over his speed, Jin felt like he had attained a new realm of magic. It was like the difference between sprinting and taking a slow stroll. The scenery one sees during those two instances are completely different.\u201cI\u2019ve always behaved the same way ever since I met you, so no need to overreact now.\u201dIn addition, after Luna\u2019s visit, Jin began to train mana release.Just like mana transfer, it was an easy task for the regressor, but he still practiced seriously for 6 months. And through this training, he realized that his past life\u2019s basics were sloppy.\u201cBe grateful that you\u2019re currently living in the Storm Castle, kid. If this were the Vermont Empire\u2019s academy, the others would\u2019ve alienated you for your talent.\u201dJin had heard the exact same words dozens of times from his past life\u2019s \u2018master\u2019.\u2018I wonder what Master is doing right now. I suppose he\u2019s just a shitty brat whose nose keeps dripping or something.\u2019The boy recalled his master\u2019s face. The magician who had informed Jin about his talent in magic and taught him everything was, in fact, 2 years younger than him.\u2018Despite that, he was a 7-star magician back then. Actually, he was almost at the 8-star stage. Geez, there are far too many geniuses in this world. I can\u2019t let myself be pushed around by them. I need to devote myself to my studies and training.\u2019Jin shrugged with a smirk forming on his face.\u201cThen, will you teach me how to release spiritual energy starting today?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Tell me when you\u2019re done transcribing those books.\u201d\u201cMurakan, do you care that little about me? I already finished transcribing all the books a week ago.\u201dExcept for the ones Jin didn\u2019t need, he had fully copied the contents of all the secret tomes that were only available to the clan\u2019s flag-bearers.He still couldn\u2019t understand every notion and idea explored in the books, but Jin would slowly realize their meanings in the future as his swordsmanship got better.All that was left for him to do before leaving the Storm Castle was to learn how to release spiritual energy.When Murakan first mentioned this technique, he never imagined Jin would be skilled enough to start learning it before leaving the castle.The dragon had only told Jin about the technique in order to motivate him to train harder, but it seemed that Murakan had underestimated the child.He would be at Jin\u2019s mercy until they left the castle.\u201cOh right, that\u2019s true. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about you, it just slipped my mind. Well then, let\u2019s begin now.\u201dWith a serious tone, Murakan sat down with his back straight, and Jin followed suit.\u201cI\u2019m warning you in advance, but releasing spiritual energy isn\u2019t a technique you can quickly master. It\u2019ll take longer than it did for mana transfer and release.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cSo don\u2019t be impatient. Just like I said before, it\u2019s both a basic and lethal technique. Let me show you.\u201dSwoosh!Even before he finished talking, a dark energy materialized like smoke and burst out of Murakan.It was spiritual energy. If Jin\u2019s spiritual energy was like a light fog that blurred one\u2019s vision, Murakan\u2019s spiritual energy was like the deep abyss that could swallow light and extinguish it.It was Jin\u2019s second time ever seeing the dragon\u2019s power\u2014the first being the day Murakan woke up.\u2018It\u2019s a lot denser and heavier than my energy.\u2019Swoosh\u2026Jin observed the dancing energy that swirled around.It felt as if the energy was waving at him, telling him to approach it. Jin caught himself about to reach out to the dark smoke.\u201cThe energy\u2019s colour is different, but overall, it looks similar to mana release, right?\u201d\u201cYeah, but it does feel a lot more mysterious.\u201d\u201cFor magicians, mana release is the act of connecting the mana inside their body with the mana in the environment. What\u2019s the intention behind that technique, Jin?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for mana recovery and strengthening.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. By releasing mana, the body is open to accepting the outside mana. Then, you can use the outside mana in order to recover your own, or to strengthen the magic spell you\u2019re about to cast. Releasing spiritual energy is more or less the same, but there are a few differences.\u201d\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\u201cReleasing spiritual energy isn\u2019t connecting your energy to the energy in your surroundings. It\u2019s connecting the natural energy around you to your inner energy.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 it\u2019s the other way around?\u201dIt was somewhat difficult to understand this notion.The aura and magic inside humans behave like rivers.The water in rivers always flows towards the open sea. Rivers are never bigger than seas or oceans. They\u2019re offshoots of the sea that branch out into the land.However, it was the opposite for spiritual energy.\u201cShadows.\u201dMurakan spoke out as he waved his hand to disperse the smoke covering half of his appearance.\u201cSpiritual power is derived from shadows. In that case, where do shadows come from?\u201dIt was a simple and short question. Yet, it was full of divine subtlety.\u201cI imagine that they come from Solderet.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018I imagine\u2019. All shadows in this world unambiguously originate from Solderet. He\u2019s the master of all shadows around the world, and you are his one and only contractor.\u201dMurakan voiced powerfully as he continued.\u201cIn other words, you can also become the master of all shadows around the world.\u201dThe countless offshoots around the world called \u2018shadows\u2019 would gather to a singular point. To the \u2018sea\u2019. To Jin Runcandel.That was the theory behind spiritual energy release.Murakan\u2019s spiritual energy began to swirl in countless tiny vortices, no bigger than plums. They then suddenly fused and created a bright and colourful pattern.\u201cPay close attention to what\u2019s about to happen.\u201dJin focused all his senses and observed his surroundings. It felt like time had slowed to the speed of a crawl as he tried to see what change the energy release would bring.\u2018What on earth!\u2019Jin could only gasp in shock when he noticed a big change.Near the glass coffin behind Murakan were several candlesticks and torches.The shadows of these light sources in the underground chamber extended like long streams of water, and began flowing towards Murakan\u2019s energy whirlpool. Jin turned back to observe the other objects in the room, and the same phenomenon was affecting the bookshelf\u2019s shadow.Soon, a sudden dizziness struck the child.A powerful sense of dissociation encroached upon him. He could feel the damp sweat in his tightly clenched fist. An urge to take several steps backwards rose in him.\u2018Is this an illusion?\u2019As soon as such thoughts came to mind, Jin shook his head to clear his mind. However, the phenomenon occurring before him was no illusion. The shadows of the objects in their surroundings were indeed gathering towards Murakan.It looked like a supernatural spectacle.The overwhelmingly menacing aura around Murakan made Jin\u2019s hair stand on end.It was as if\u2026 not a single existence in this world could ever kill the being before Jin.And Jin instinctively realized that he couldn\u2019t let this threatening aura crush his spirit. According to Murakan, the ones who should be trembling in fear were the shadows.Because one day, Jin would be the one wielding that dark and terrifying power.Murakan smirked at the sight of fear dissipating from the child\u2019s eyes.\u201cGood. That should be the attitude of the promised contractor of a thousand years.\u201dSwoosh\u2026The shadow vortex soon halted its movement, and the rivers of shadows returned to their respective positions.Having gone through an intense experience about the extent of this power, the usual peaceful and calm scenery around him somewhat felt pleasing, unlike before.It was like the night had passed. Or maybe like a festival had finally ended.The last stream of shadow reached its original object, and the oppressive atmosphere had completely vanished.Jin was sweating buckets, but wore a refreshing smile as he pulled his drenched shirt away from his chest.\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cIncredible.\u201d\u201cIs that all? You do realize that was the Great Murakan\u2019s killer blow, right?\u201d\u201cIt was like you had complete control over day and night inside this room.\u201dMurakan nodded, seemingly satisfied by Jin\u2019s spontaneous comment.\u201cDay and night\u2026 I haven\u2019t heard that expression in a long while. People love associating users of spiritual power with those kinds of words and expressions since ancient times. Things like \u2018Ruler of the Night\u2019, or \u2018Creator of Darkness in Daylight\u2019. They\u2019re pretty childish, honestly.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201d\u201cI know, right? And \u2018Ruler of the Night\u2019 is a nickname that holds so many misconceptions and prejudices\u2026 For your information, people used to call me that around two thousand years ago. Actually, it\u2019s technically not wrong to call me that. Bwahahaha!\u201d\u2018Is this dragon seriously saying such cheap jokes in front of a child?\u2019Jin swallowed his comeback and giggled.\u201cHm, in any case, do you understand what spiritual energy release is? Technically, it\u2019s just like a different version of mana release, so I assume you understand the principle behind it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got a good grasp over it. Just give me one hour. I think I\u2019ll be able to do it.\u201d\u201cGet off your high horse, kid. Like I said earlier, releasing spiritual energy isn\u2019t something you can master in a short period of time\u2026\u201d\u201cI know that. I didn\u2019t mean I could master the technique with your level of proficiency in an hour, but I think I could at least manage a small energy release. You know, like how the simplest of sword slashes performed by a novice and a swordmaster can be completely different.\u201d\u201cExactly! That\u2019s why I said that spiritual energy release is both a basic and lethal move.\u201d\u201cThen, what level of mastery was the technique you showed me just now?\u201d\u201cAround intermediate level. Maybe a bit above intermediate.\u201dIntermediate.Jin was sure of himself. Even if a grand magician from the Zipfel Clan were to perform a 9-star magic spell, it wouldn\u2019t be any stronger than the energy release he had observed just now.Murakan hadn\u2019t used the spiritual energy to destroy anything in order to show its strength, so Jin had no concrete proof to back his opinion. However, even if he didn\u2019t see its destructive power with his own eyes, he could accurately sense the spiritual power\u2019s superiority over 9-star magic.\u201cIf you fully master this technique, you could even completely annihilate an army of one million in an instant. Having the shadow taken away from a lifeform is synonymous to death.\u201dCrack!A couple of torches placed in the corridor suddenly broke apart and fell to the floor.\u201cAnd having the shadow taken away from an object is synonymous to destruction.\u201dJin couldn\u2019t hide his shock, and blankly stared at the broken torches.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Still, dammit! I did my best to hold back so that nothing would get destroyed, so why did those torches break?! We\u2019ll have to fix those before leaving the castle. What a pain in the ass.\u201dCrack, crack!The torches weren\u2019t the only things that broke down. The stone parts of the glass coffin Murakan was slumbering inside of had large fissures across them.\u201cFuck.\u201dA deep sigh escaped the dragon\u2019s mouth as he frowned. He now had small chores to do while waiting for Jin from here on out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 \u2013 Departing the Storm Castle (2)Orgal\u2019s Pendant.The Phoenix Heart.And the manuscript of the secret tomes.These were the physical gains Jin had obtained during his stay in the Storm Castle.And according to Murakan\u2019s explanation, Jin could use the pendant to summon Luna once. Moreover, the artifact\u2019s effect also provided him a powerful immunity against 5-star or lower attack spells.Additionally, the pendant could\u00a0amplify the effects of magic buffs cast on its user.Two years have already passed since Jin ate the Phoenix Heart, but it had yet to be fully absorbed by his body.One month after he ate the heart, Jin tested how much his body had absorbed its effects every day by placing his finger on a candle flame.\u201cLady Mary would be very proud of you if she were here, Young Master.\u201dAnd sure enough, Jin placed his index finger above a candle flame today as well.The flame that touched the tip of his finger had absolutely no effect on it. Jin felt no burning sensation\u2014it was as if he had placed his finger in warm water.Gilly was thrilled by this sight and slowly approached the young boy.\u201cGilly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also my first time seeing the effects of the Phoenix Heart. And as your nanny, I\u2019m overjoyed to know that the beneficiary of the heart is you, Young Master Jin.\u201dA wide smile drew on Gilly\u2019s face. Jin truly believed that amongst the nannies working for the Runcandel Clan, she was the most honest and sincere.\u2018If my knowledge from when I was a magician doesn\u2019t betray me, I seem to have absorbed around 50% of the heart.\u2019Should he absorb 100% of the heart, Jin would be able to withstand a fearsome firestorm that could burn down an entire castle\u2014let alone a candle flame. In other words, Jin would be near-perfectly resistant to all flames that don\u2019t contain mana.To put it another way, Jin wouldn\u2019t be fully resistant against flames generated with magic.Needless to say, unless it\u2019s a high-rank fire magic spell cast by a 6-star or higher magician, they wouldn\u2019t be able to break through the heart\u2019s flame resistance effects. However, there is another reason why the Phoenix Heart is considered such a crucial item amongst magicians.\u2018If I fully absorb the heart, I won\u2019t be restricted when I summon a phoenix in a few years.\u2019The flames that are constantly swirling around the mystical beasts known as phoenixes generally have the force of 5-star spells. So whenever a phoenix flaps its wings, it\u2019s no different from having 5-star fire magic being shot out constantly.And unfortunately, these flames can also injure the magician who summoned the phoenix. So even if someone were to become a 6-star magician, it would be difficult to summon and use a phoenix unless they have a high resistance against flames.In other words, one had to eat a Phoenix Heart to have complete control over a phoenix familiar and make full use of it.\u2018I can\u2019t wait.\u2019To this day, Jin was far more interested in magic than in swordsmanship. Before his regression, the last three years of his 28 years of life were far more enjoyable than the initial 25.\u201cYou seem to be quite loved by your sisters, Young Master. There\u2019s Lady Luna as well as Lady Mary. I wonder how you will repay their affection, hohoho.\u201dJin nearly snorted from hearing Gilly\u2019s words.He couldn\u2019t help but laugh to himself when he remembered the stories about \u2018Mary Runcandel\u2019 from his past life, along with her unique personality.\u2018I\u2019m sure that Mary gave me the Phoenix Heart to speed up my growth, so that I can challenge her later on in life.\u2019That was how Jin\u2019s third sister\u2019s mind functioned.She was a battle-crazed, muscle-brained maniac. Moreover, she loved fighting against other Runcandels or enemies from the Zipfel Clan.That was why she became a 6-star knight and roamed around the continent\u2014challenging powerful opponents despite not being 20 yet. She stirred trouble everywhere she went, which earned her the nickname \u2018Stormwind Mary\u2019.Initially, it was \u2018The Southern Region\u2019s Madwoman\u2019. However, Mary slaughtered everyone who called her that, so she received a cooler sounding nickname.\u2018Not only does she want me to challenge her after I become powerful, she also gave the heart away because she believes that she doesn\u2019t need it. So it was a gift that originated from her pride and self-confidence. Mary\u2019s one helluva prideful nutcase.\u2019Jin grinned as his thoughts reached a conclusion.\u201cI should repay them the way they want me to.\u201dLuna wanted Jin to grow up strong and healthy, and to survive the family\u2019s deadly feud.Mary wanted Jin to grow up strong and healthy, and attempt to cleanly slice off her head with his sword.Therefore, Jin had to repay them by doing exactly what they expected of him.Knock-knock.Someone was behind the door to Jin\u2019s room.\u201cThis is Khan, Young Master Jin. It\u2019s time for your training.\u201d\u201cOh, so it\u2019s already time. I\u2019ll be there.\u201dCurrently, Jin was training two skills simultaneously.He was learning spirit energy release from Murakan in the underground chamber, and was being taught the Runcandel martial arts by Khan, a knight at the castle. As a result, Jin had no time to rest on a daily basis.When he opened the door and exited his room, Khan politely bowed.\u201cWhat will today\u2019s lesson be about, Khan?\u201d\u201cIn the morning, we\u2019ll study combat footwork. Around noon, it will be the different striking techniques using both punches and kicks. Then, we\u2019ll tackle joint lock techniques in the evening together with some general physical training.\u201dIt was a busy schedule, but Jin nodded in satisfaction. He was emanating an aura of dignity and majesty like a ruler who had received a report from a subordinate.Khan tensed up as he observed Jin\u2019s behaviour.As a guardian knight of the Runcandel Clan and the young master\u2019s martial arts instructor, he should\u2019ve been extremely proud of the child\u2019s growth.However, Khan was on edge and nervous whenever he trained the young boy.\u2018I mustn\u2019t slack off and idle around while teaching Young Master Jin.\u2019Khan had taught the clan\u2019s combat techniques to a total of six Runcandel children in the Storm Castle.The Tona twins, who had left two years ago; Jin\u2019s sixth sister, Yona; his fifth sister, Anne; his fourth sister, Myu; and finally, Jin himself.Except for the twins, the other three had already left the Storm Castle when Jin was still a baby.\u2018I\u2019ve never felt like this when I was teaching the others. They were all busy keeping up with the training program, and all I had to do was evaluate their growth. But for Young Master Jin\u2026 He\u2019s the one evaluating me. There\u2019s something different about him.\u2019Evaluate.Normally, the instructor is the only one with the right to evaluate his student\u2014similar to the relationship between a boss and a subordinate.But Khan could sense that Jin was inversely evaluating his \u2018teaching skills\u2019. And it happened on a daily basis during their training sessions ever since their first lesson.During the exhausting physical training when Jin would sweat buckets, during the exercises where he\u2019d get bruised and his youthful skin would tear and burst, even during the spars when he\u2019d get thrown onto the floor.Jin would always be closely observing Khan\u2019s teaching skills.This was a first for Khan.However, he didn\u2019t find it unpleasant or uncomfortable. On the contrary, Khan believed that Jin possessed all the virtues a pure-blooded Runcandel should have.\u2018No wonder the patriarch shows great interest in him. I mustn\u2019t let down my guard today as well.\u2019Khan focused his attention as a flame of enthusiasm sparked in his eyes. He and Jin then moved to the training grounds inside the castle.\u201cYoung Master Jin.\u201d\u201cSpeak freely, Khan.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a great honour to be able to instruct you, Young Master. I promise to provide you the best possible training regime and guide you to the best of my abilities in the next few months, until your 10th birthday.\u201d\u201cI appreciate your thoughts. I\u2019ll be in your care until then.\u201dIt was only after the combat training session had ended that Jin could go visit Murakan, despite his complete exhaustion.He then practiced the spirit energy release technique under the dragon\u2019s guidance.Today was a gruelling and demanding day, but still a joyous one.\u201cKya!\u201dMurakan let out a cry of excitement and amazement.Jin wondered how many times Murakan had been astonished already. According to a quick calculation, it was over 20 times during the past hour.\u201cAre you that happy, Murakan?\u201dMurakan turned his head back and stared at Jin.\u201cIs that even a question, kid? I can finally get out of this boring and stuffy place! And it\u2019s tomorrow!\u201dTwo years have passed since the Tona twins left the castle. But for Jin, the two years went by in a flash. He had countless more things he wanted to learn and practice, so he would\u2019ve loved to stay for a few more years.\u2018He\u2019s right. Up until the day I met him down here, I also found every day boring as hell in this castle.\u2019He had graduated from Khan\u2019s combat lessons 10 days ago with his instructor\u2019s recognition, and he had achieved double the progress Murakan had expected Jin to accomplish when it came to spiritual energy release.In the clan\u2019s history, there was not a single Runcandel who had achieved as many feats as Jin during their stay in the Storm Castle. Normally, the only training the Runcandel children could receive at the castle was combat training. Thus, it was to no surprise that Jin was the highest achiever ever.However, the boy in question was still not satisfied.\u2018I wanted to reach 5-star in mana and 2-star in spiritual energy before leaving the castle\u2026 Oh well, I guess I was being too impatient.\u2019He was, indeed, being impatient. Even in the entire world\u2019s history, there was not a single individual who had gained such powers at the age of ten.\u2018Stay calm. Don\u2019t rush. My achievements so far are already impressive enough. If the world knew about my powers, everyone would treat me like an unprecedented genius.\u2019Today was October 30th, 1790.Tomorrow, the Runcandel Clan\u2019s guardian knights would arrive to escort Jin back to the clan\u2019s main house, the \u2018Garden of Swords\u2019.\u201cBy the way, if you leave this place, what do we do about your empty coffin, Murakan?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. Those who come down here will just read those books and won\u2019t notice that I\u2019m not inside.\u201d\u201cHow will they not notice it? Even though you fixed that glass coffin, the insides are still empty.\u201d\u201cKuhaha. Your knowledge in magic is still lacking if you\u2019re worrying about such things, kid.\u201d\u201cSheesh, fine. Then tell me what your fail-safe plan is.\u201d\u201cI just need to create an illusion of myself lying down inside the coffin using Draconic Magic.\u201d\u2018Holy cow, you can do that?\u2019Jin almost spontaneously shouted that out, but barely held himself back. According to his knowledge, illusion magic couldn\u2019t recreate elaborate images.\u201cWho do you think I am? I\u2019m a dragon. Moreover, the Shadow Dragon. Creating an illusion like that is as easy as blowing my nose into your shirt.\u201d\u201cAmazing. Is it possible to maintain the illusion over a long period of time?\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 That might be harder, even for me. Oh well, what other choice do we have? I\u2019ll just do my best to sustain it for as long as possible until you grow old enough to protect yourself. So be grateful, alright? Respect and revere me, alright kid?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why I brought you a little special something today.\u201dAs Jin opened up the basket, stars shone in Murakan\u2019s eyes. The basket was filled to the brim with strawberry pies. Gilly had made them using the Mitel Kingdom\u2019s first harvest.\u201cS-Strawberry pies\u2026\u2026! My strawberry pies!\u201dJin grinned as he watched Murakan wolf down the pies before him. He then took out a few bottles from the cloth bag that usually held his notebooks.\u201cThose bottles! Don\u2019t tell me\u2026! Is that alcohol?\u201d\u201cYep. Since today\u2019s our last day here, I stole some without letting my nanny know.\u201d\u201cSo you do have some humanity left in you, kid! My time spent educating you was worth it. Hahaha!!\u201dHe was such an easy dragon to manipulate.***The next day, around lunchtime, two knights from the Runcandel main house came to the castle.There were fewer escorts compared to the time the Tona twins left the castle, but both escorts were 7-star knights this time around.\u201cYoung Master, you must steel yourself now. From here on out, your every desire won\u2019t be fulfilled. It will be difficult for me to bake you strawberry pies all the time too\u2026\u201dGilly spoke in a solemn tone as she stared directly into Jin\u2019s eyes.\u201cThe main house won\u2019t be as tranquil and peaceful as our days here. You must keep that in mind.\u201dJin\u2019s days at the Storm Castle were rarely tranquil and peaceful due to his constant training sessions, but he adjusted his attitude to the serious atmosphere.\u201cI know. Don\u2019t worry, Gilly. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\u201cI will faithfully assist you to the best of my abilities out there, Young Master. Well then, let us go.\u201d\u201cGuardian Knights Jerome and Holtz greet Young Master Jin. The two of us will safely escort you to the Garden of Swords.\u201dThe knights from the main house politely saluted the young boy.A steel, horse-drawn carriage was waiting for them at the bottom of the mountain.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu***Later, during the night.A group of unidentified assailants attacked the steel carriage belonging to the Runcandel Clan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 \u2013 AttackJin\u2019s days at the Storm Castle were accompanied by constant rain. However, once they descended the mountain and reached the bottom, the scenery was white.It was the Mitel Kingdom\u2019s first snowfall. Moreover, a heavy snowfall. Within hours, the snow had piled up to knee-level.Due to this pure white landscape, the carriage had to slow down its pace. The knights Jerome and Holtz got off and began to sweep the snow in their way with their swords.\u201cWe should take refuge in a village nearby and wait for it to stop snowing, Young Master. Even if we were to reach the capital without stopping, we wouldn\u2019t be able to use the transfer gate due to the snow.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. We\u2019ve got no choice.\u201dAlthough this was Jin\u2019s first time seeing snow in a long while, he wasn\u2019t particularly excited about it due to their grave circumstances.A carriage advancing slowly, and a snowfall that seems to be attempting to swallow the entire world whole. Jin was flipping through his notes\u2014the transcripts of the secret tomes at the Storm Castle\u2014in order to kill time.But in the middle of the night\u2026Swoosh!Neiiiigh-!Suddenly, the two horses pulling the carriage screamed out in horror.The 3-star magic spell \u2018Icicle Shot\u2019 had pierced the horses\u2019 flanks. The carriage shook as if it were about to flip over, and in the next second, the coachman was killed by the same spell.\u201cWe\u2019re being attacked! Please stay inside the carriage, Young Master!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an attack!\u201dJerome and Holtz shouted out loud. Immediately, Gilly covered Jin with her body and observed the situation outside.The usual gentle and kind gaze was nowhere to be seen. Her eyes appeared to be burning with rage as she showed fierce killing intent.\u201cWe\u2019ll be alright, Young Master. You have me and two 7-star guardian knights to protect you. No need to worry.\u201dA calm and relaxed voice. Jin had seen Gilly behave like this a couple of times in his past life. It would happen everytime the Runcandels got attacked and Jin was in danger.\u201cThere are around 20 assassins. They seem to be composed of magicians and warriors, but we cannot eliminate the possibility that they have archers with them. I have yet to determine whether there are 7-star or higher enemies.\u201dGilly reported her own observations of the situation.The Runcandel nannies were all 7-star or higher warriors. Before long, Gilly\u2019s weapon\u2014a claw\u2014revealed itself from within her sleeve and gave off a sharp glow.\u2018What a mess. An attack as soon as we left the Storm Castle? Who are they?\u2019Although Gilly was trying to reassure Jin, he was far more composed than the nanny was.Fear due to the sudden attack?There was no way that was possible. He had three 7-star combatants by his side protecting him. And if the worst was to come, he could use Orgal\u2019s Pendant.As long as the pendant was with him, he could definitely survive any threat a single time.\u2018If they\u2019re willing to attack a Runcandel carriage, these attackers aren\u2019t nobodies. Since the knights couldn\u2019t detect them beforehand, there must be at least a 6-star magician amongst them.\u2019Jin was calmly evaluating the situation outside.\u2018The carriage wasn\u2019t attacked after those first few spells, and I can hear weapons clashing in the distance. In other words, the enemies were hiding in the distance, and Jerome and Holtz went after them to counter\u2026 attack?\u2019As his thought process reached that conclusion, Jin realized that something was wrong.\u201cGilly.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master?\u201d\u201cJerome and Holtz. Those two weren\u2019t sent by the clan. That, or they\u2019re traitors.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, what are you talking about\u2026? Everyone at the Storm Castle knows of their faces, including me. They\u2019re definitely Jerome and Holtz of the clan.\u201dEven Jin knew of their faces. He had come across them a few times in his past life.Nevertheless, Jin had his reasons for treating them as impostors or traitors.\u201cGilly. The guardian knights of the clan never leave the Runcandel children unattended like this, even if the nannies are with them.\u201d\u201cAh!\u201d\u201cOne of those two should\u2019ve stayed next to the carriage. But Jerome and Holtz both went out to engage the enemies. They\u2019re either traitors or impostors.\u201dGilly checked the situation outside through the window. Just as Jin had remarked, Jerome and Holtz had left their positions as soon as the attack began.Crack!Gilly\u2019s face distorted in fury as she grinded her teeth. The anger was directed towards the two traitors, as well as to herself for noticing the situation only after Jin had pointed it out.\u201c\u2026I apologize, Young Master. I will make sure to receive severe punishment for this oversight of mine once we return to the clan.\u201cAs of right now, Gilly McRolan will protect Young Master Jin as a member of the Runcandel Clan. Please be patient and lenient even if my protection ends up being somewhat drastic and violent.\u201d\u201cWhile it\u2019s important to get us out of danger, it\u2019s also crucial to learn who these assassins are, since they may be allies who are here to rescue us from those two traitors.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master. I will not bring dishonor to the clan.\u201dSlash!Gilly suddenly swung her claw diagonally while still being seated. The steel carriage was cleanly bisected and easily fell apart. Jin could now see the sky from inside(?) the carriage.She then immediately carried her young master and jumped out of the metal, running like an arrow flying with the wind. Since the traitors had prepared the carriage, there could\u2019ve been hidden features to prevent them from escaping. Therefore, the nanny had to be quick in order to avoid all the potential traps.Due to the darkness of the night and the heavy snow, their visibility wasn\u2019t any better outside. All they could see was some flashes and sparks about 200 meters away from them.\u2018Since the both of them left to fight the attackers as soon as the battle began, they must\u2019ve judged that they couldn\u2019t stop the enemies alone.\u2019If the opponents that Jerome and Holtz were fighting against were Jin\u2019s allies, then the boy and the nanny were about to be saved.But Jin couldn\u2019t discard the possibility that the attackers were, in fact, other enemies who had different goals than the two traitors. Nevertheless, Gilly carried the boy and ran towards the battlefield.\u201cFind Jin Runcandel!\u201d\u201cTeam 3! Block the one on the left!\u201dThe voices of those who had attacked the carriage. At a closer look, Jerome and Holtz were fighting on equal grounds against 20 or so opponents.\u201cYoung Master, why did you leave the carriage!\u201d\u201cThis place is dangerous. Please return to the carriage for now!\u201dJerome and Holtz shouted towards Jin when they noticed him.\u201cShut it, you dirty treacherous bastards. On whose orders are you two here? How dare you attempt to kidnap the young master\u2026\u2026!\u201dGilly wrapped aura around her claw and glared furiously. The face of the two traitors distorted visibly, and smiles began forming on the attackers\u2019 faces who had surrounded the 7-star knights.\u201cThat woman is Gilly McRolan! Jin Runcandel\u2019s presence has been confirmed!\u201d\u201cAll men, prioritize the protection of Jin Runcandel!\u201dThe attackers were indeed the boy and nanny\u2019s allies.Jin felt somewhat relieved. If Gilly joined forces with them, he wouldn\u2019t have to break Orgal\u2019s Pendant in order to activate it.The battle came to a sudden standstill with Jin\u2019s arrival. During this short moment in time, the boy scanned the armors and robes of his presumed allies.\u2018A leaf and a black grebe. It\u2019s the Yuta Clan and the Black King Mercenaries.\u2019The Yuta Clan was a clan of magicians in the Mitel Kingdom, whereas the Black King was a group of mercenaries that could be considered one of the strongest mercenary groups out there. Since there was only a single black grebe on their crest, it seemed that it wasn\u2019t their most elite troops.Nonetheless, each mercenary was in the 5-star realm, and the Yuta magicians seemed to be masters of their craft.\u2018So they aren\u2019t traitors but impostors. The horses and coachman were killed with the Icicle Shots\u2026 due to a failed preemptive attack.\u2019Having surveyed his allies and observed their strength and numbers, Jin came to a sound conclusion.If Jerome and Holtz were truly 7-star knights, they could\u2019ve easily decimated the twenty 5-star attackers\u2014particularly in the darkness and heavy snowfall where everyone\u2019s vision is restricted.However, despite the battle having lasted for a long while, there were no visible casualties amongst the assailants. In other words, Jerome and Holtz weren\u2019t true 7-star knights from the Runcandel Clan.\u201cI am Murka, Vice-captain of the Black King Mercenaries\u2019 3rd Corps! Having received a commission from the Runcandel Clan, we joined forces with the Yuta Clan of the Mitel Kingdom in order to rescue Jin Runcandel!\u201d\u201cPfft hahaha\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the fake Jerome let out a small chuckle.The odd laughter lasted for a long time. Due to the strange sense of incongruity, the Yuta magicians and Black King mercenaries readied their weapons as a chill ran down their spines.Gilly stood before Jin and spoke.\u201cWho are you two?\u201dShe had also realized that the two knights were not the Runcandel knights she knew of. Just like Jin, she was aware of the might and strength that true 7-star knights held.\u201cKek, what a stupid question, Gilly McRolan\u2026 We have nothing to say to a mutt who licks the boots of the Runcandels.\u201dThe fake Holtz also let out a sickening chuckle and repositioned himself. They didn\u2019t seem to be willing to give more information.\u201c\u2026What should I do, Young Master?\u201dJin answered Gilly\u2019s questions without an ounce of hesitation.\u201cKill one of them and cut the arms of the other before you bring him to me.\u201d\u201cYour wish is my command.\u201d\u201cYou may be powerful, Gilly McRolan, but you shouldn\u2019t underestimate us.\u201d\u201cMurka of the Black King Mercenaries. I shall leave the Young Master in your care for 30 seconds.\u201dGilly ignored the fake Jerome\u2019s retort and addressed Murka. The vice-captain immediately ran before Jin with his men, and formed a line of defense.\u2018I haven\u2019t seen a 7-star knight\u2019s battle in a long while.\u2019As Jin thought to himself, Gilly had already shot towards the two impostors. As she flashed across the snow-filled landscape, the air tore as a sonic boom blasted.She was a speeding arrow. The mercenaries and magicians couldn\u2019t believe that one could reach such speeds by running on this thick layer of soft snow.Rip-!The three-pronged claw tore through the fake Jerome\u2019s neck.The impostor couldn\u2019t even react to the nanny\u2019s speed. He only noticed his incoming death when his head touched the snow.The fake Holtz who was next to Jerome turned around in order to find Gilly\u2019s figure, who had shot past them.However, he couldn\u2019t follow her movements with his untrained eyes. As he tried to retaliate by swinging the sword in his hand\u2026Thump.The sound of his right arm and sword falling into the snow reached his ears.\u201cOh.\u201dSlash!Swoosh-!The fake Holtz somehow managed to avoid Gilly\u2019s follow-up dance of fury a couple of times.However, that was his limit. Without his right arm, his unbalanced body couldn\u2019t properly follow his mind\u2019s orders. Before long, Gilly\u2019s claw cleanly cut off her enemy\u2019s left arm.Seven seconds.Barely seven seconds had passed since her involvement in the battle. Gilly used the remaining 23 seconds to stop the blood pouring out of the victim\u2019s wounds. She cut off the dead Jerome(?)\u2019s long hair to tie up Holtz(?)\u2019s armless stumps.The mercenaries and magicians couldn\u2019t help but watch the phenomenon occurring before them in astonishment.\u2018S-Such a powerful woman is merely a nanny?\u2019\u2018She\u2019s in a whole different realm compared to us\u2026!\u2019On the other hand, Jin was wearing a satisfied smile.\u201cI have carried out your command, Young Master.\u201dGilly dragged the fake Holtz behind her and walked towards the boy. As snow kept entering his mouth, the armless victim couldn\u2019t even scream in pain properly.Thud!Upon her arrival, she grabbed the impostor\u2019s head and anchored it firmly before Jin\u2019s feet.\u201cIt seems like the one who was underestimating their opponent wasn\u2019t Gilly, but you two. If you were attempting to assassinate the Runcandels\u2019 youngest child, you should\u2019ve sent three or four 8-star knights instead.\u201dAs Jin spoke in a cold tone, the fake Holtz spat out.\u201cKeuk, Kuhuhu\u2026 This is merely a warning. The Era of the Runcandels is, urgh\u2026 coming to an end.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s actually something I look forward to.\u201dJin\u2019s statement sparked surprise and confusion amongst the mercenaries and magicians.\u201cBecause the Era of the Runcandels will end, and the Era of Jin Runcandel is about to begin.\u201d\u201cGlory to the Zipfels!\u201d\u201cOh, so you\u2019re a follower of the Zipfels. I guess there\u2019s no need to take you back to the clan and torture information out of you anymore.\u201dSmash!Jin covered his fist in aura and slammed it down next to the impostor\u2019s head. He had learned how to wield aura through his martial arts classes with Khan.\u201cRelease him.\u201d\u201cMen, kill him!\u201d\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t mean it like that. Try your best to survive and return to your base in that state, Mr. Impostor. It\u2019ll teach your comrades a lesson. Well, this was a waste of time. Gilly, throw away this little piece of junk somewhere.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Young Master.\u201dGilly picked up the armless man and threw him away in the distant snowfield.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euJin thought to himself as he watched the fake Holtz coughing in the snow.\u2018Geez, what naive lunatics. Did they think the Zipfels would be thankful to them for doing something like this?\u2019***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 \u2013 Truth Revealed?A tense mood filled the air.Sweat could be seen dripping down people\u2019s necks.Having dealt with the impostors, the Black King Mercenaries ended up becoming Jin\u2019s new escorts. However, the escorts couldn\u2019t help but hold their breaths around their client. Now that the Yuta magicians had returned on their own, the mercenaries were the only ones left to take care of the terrifying kid.\u2018What kind of a 10-year-old boy acts like this?\u2019The vice-captain of the Black King Mercenaries\u2019 3rd Corps asked himself\u2014a question that all his men were also thinking.The Black King Mercenaries! They are veteran warriors who can turn the tables on the battlefield. Bloodshed, broken bones, burnt skin! Nothing can stop these battle-scarred soldiers.The sight of prisoners being mercilessly tortured and murdered is a daily occurrence to these men. Watching Jin order Gilly to kill the fake Jerome and Holtz in a bloody manner was nothing new to them.Nevertheless, these vicious mercenaries were wary of Jin due to his age.Where else would they ever find a 10-year-old behaving this way towards their assassin? Even though he was a Runcandel, he was merely a kid who had just left the Storm Castle and entered the world.In fact, their senses were warning them to be extremely careful with Jin when they saw him give Gilly orders. His speech and behaviour weren\u2019t those of a child, not to mention his method of disposal of the surviving assassin.The mercenaries could only see Jin as a Runcandel overlord\u2014who just happened to be somewhat short in height.\u201cWe mustn\u2019t make the slightest mistake until we successfully escort him to the transfer gate. Any frivolous or superficial behaviour is absolutely prohibited, do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, Vice-captain Murka.\u201dThe Black King Mercenaries\u2014known for their rough and boorish behaviour\u2014were acting like dignified gentlemen. They were all standing stiff and nervous, as if they were wearing tight, uncomfortable clothes.However, they weren\u2019t acting like this solely due to their fear of the child known as Jin Runcandel. There was also a hint of admiration and fascination in their eyes towards this dangerous boy.\u201cYoung Master.\u201dWhile Jin was kicking the snow away as he walked, Gilly called out to him. She was wearing a calm expression and tone, but the boy caught the slight melancholic look that lasted for an instant.\u201cWe\u2019ll reach the village in about two hours. Once we arrive, it would be best to wait for the snowfall to die down before continuing our journey.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s do that.\u201dJin brushed off the snow piling on his shoulder.\u201cOh, Gilly?\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about what happened. It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201dJin truly believed so in his heart. Even Khan hadn\u2019t noticed that Jerome and Holtz were impostors back at the Storm Castle, so there was no way Gilly would\u2019ve.In addition, the fact that Jin knew better about the guardian knights\u2019 rules than his nanny wasn\u2019t much of a problem either. At the very least, Jin didn\u2019t think so. Yet, Gilly was still dwelling on this incident.\u201cI apologize.\u201dOnce he heard her reply, Jin wore a bitter smile as he recalled some memories.Gilly never makes excuses.She never brings up justifications such as \u2018I\u2019ve lost my touch from spending ten peaceful years at the Storm Castle\u2019 or \u2018I was feeling under the weather, which dulled my senses\u2019.\u2018In my first life\u2026 Gilly was the same, always apologizing for something that wasn\u2019t her fault. Made me feel sorry for her. All the torment she must\u2019ve gone through\u2026\u2019Before his regression, the only person within the clan who unconditionally cared for Jin was Gilly. When Jin was banished, her life took a terrible turn and she became miserable. Nevertheless, Gilly never blamed her Young Master.Even when her 7-star aura was sealed and she was kicked out of the clan with Jin, she repeated the same sentence as today.\u2018I apologize\u2019.\u201cOnce we return to the main house, I shall accept any punishment for\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough. I told you not to worry about it, didn\u2019t I? It\u2019s an order.\u201dGilly lowered her head.\u201cI understand.\u201d\u201cYou may be my nanny, but you\u2019re also my lone guardian knight right now. If you continue brooding over a minor mistake which doesn\u2019t bother me, you won\u2019t be able to protect me to the fullest extent. I hope I won\u2019t have to repeat myself.\u201dJin didn\u2019t want to talk to Gilly in such an overbearing manner, but it was the only way to get her to listen.In this life, it was his turn to protect his nanny. Even if Jin had to act cold-blooded at times, he had to make sure the harsh reality wouldn\u2019t crush her kind and warm heart. It was the boy\u2019s turn to lead his nanny to a better life.\u201cYour wish is my command, Young Master.\u201dGilly answered as she bit her lower lip. She was aware that Jin\u2019s indifferent tone was due to his goodwill towards her.\u2018Why did such a bright and intelligent young master have to get stuck with a dull and slow nanny like me? I should come to my senses and make sure no other troublesome matters bother the young master today.\u2019Becoming a person worthy of the young master!As she made a pledge to herself, Gilly tightened her fist and raised her head. Feeling relieved by her resolute face, Jin began to think about the assassins.The fake Jerome and Holtz.They were part of a radical group of Zipfel followers and had perfectly disguised themselves, fooling everyone at the Storm Castle.It was impossible to create such a perfect disguise with magic. \u2018Transformation\u2019 was a special privilege granted only to dragons, and even with that power, it was impossible to perfectly replicate and imitate another individual.In that case, how did the assassins recreate the knights\u2019 appearance without any imperfections?Once they verified the deaths of the real Jerome and Holtz, the Runcandel main house immediately dispatched the Black King Mercenaries who were on standby in the Mitel Kingdom, and began to investigate the identities of the impostors.However, Jin didn\u2019t expect them to discover anything. The entire world was crawling with followers of the Zipfel Clan. Blaming and executing them all would be impossible to achieve, both practically and politically.Moreover, revealing the assassination attempt on Jin and arranging a search warrant around the world would be unfavourable to the Runcandels.Therefore, the Runcandels will definitely do as usual. They\u2019ll find a random group of Zipfel followers and punish them to make an example out of them, and instill fear in the others.However, Jin already knew who the mastermind was.\u2018Bouvard Gaston.\u2019Technically speaking, he wasn\u2019t the mastermind\u2026 but the culprit behind the excellent disguises.According to Jin\u2019s knowledge, Bouvard Gaston was the only person in this world who could successfully create a \u2018perfect transformation\u2019.By the time Jin turned 20, Bouvard\u2019s identity was revealed to the world. The Vermont Empire had dispatched a group of special forces in order to track down the unknown criminal behind the \u2018transformation crimes\u2019, and finally captured him after a 10-year pursuit.Jin still remembered how the news about the transformation criminal Bouvard spread around the entire world in his first life.In the future, people would come to learn about Bouvard. However, Jin was the only person who knew about him in his current life.\u2018His perfect transformations would be quite useful to have. If I win Bouvard over and make use of his skills\u2026\u2019But Jin then shook his head.\u2018He\u2019s a complete lunatic. When Bouvard was imprisoned in Vermont, he wouldn\u2019t stop proclaiming that he\u2019s an artist and no criminal. It would be best to get rid of him instead. At this point, he\u2019s already raised his blade against me.\u2019Bouvard was an existence that only created chaos in the world. Chaos for the sake of chaos. That was his inspiration and \u2018artstyle\u2019.Now that he had remembered everything terrible about this lunatic, Jin was starting to get a headache.Fortunately, there was no need for Jin to spend years searching for Bouvard. He already knew that Bouvard was pretending to be an ordinary citizen, and remembered the location of the \u2018fragmented workshop\u2019 the artist was managing.\u201cWe will arrive soon. If there is anything you need, please don\u2019t hesitate to tell my subordinates.\u201dAs soon as one of Jin\u2019s escorts spoke to him, the morning sun began to rise.Jin had a simple meal composed of soup and eggs at the inn, before taking a rest in his room. Despite having trained his magic, spiritual arts, and martial arts at the Storm Castle, walking under heavy snowfall for several hours was still an exhausting task for a child\u2019s body.\u201cMeoow.\u201d\u201cMeow.\u201d\u201cMeow!\u201dNovember 2nd, 1790. 3 PM.The heavy snowfall lasted until noon, but completely vanished soon afterwards as if it had never existed. Now, a certain black cat was meowing.The cat was outside the 3rd floor window of an inn. Inside, it could see a certain boy quietly sleeping on the bed.The adorable little feline raised its front paw and began tapping on the window. It didn\u2019t look any different from your ordinary cheerful cat.\u201cMmm.\u201dNow awake, Jin sat up and rubbed his eyes. Having slept for several hours, his body now felt as light as a feather.\u201cMeow~ Meow!\u201dNoticing the change, the cat was now violently scratching the glass with both its front paws, as if it wanted to desperately get inside.Pffft.Seeing the cat\u2019s behaviour, a short snicker escaped the boy\u2019s mouth. Who would ever imagine that this ultra-adorable cat was actually the Great Black Dragon Murakan?\u2018Damn\u2026 so cute. Should I tease him a bit?\u2019Jin\u2019s playfulness had activated. He feigned ignorance and grabbed the cup of warm water next to his bed, when suddenly\u2026Hissss! Hiiissssss!Murakan began to get impatient and irritated. Jin realized that if he continued, it would soon be a bother to pacify the angry cat. He then stopped his taunt and opened the window.\u201cI-I get it. I get it. I was just joking around, no need to get so mad\u2026\u201dPoof!Murakan instantly transformed back into a human and did a faceplant on the floor.WhaBAM!A heavy sound shook the room, and the nanny\u2014who was on standby next to the door\u2014immediately rushed inside.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dClang!As soon as the unknown human on the floor entered her vision, she swiftly took out her claw. It was already covered in a layer of abyssal blue, ready to engage the enemy.\u2018We fucked up. God, why\u2026\u2019It was all over. An unexpected situation had completely foiled his plans, and put him between a rock and a hard place\u2026Before Jin and Murakan could utter any word, Gilly shot towards the man lying on the floor and pressed her claw against his nape.\u201cWho sent you?! Speak before I tear you to shreds and slice you into a thousand pieces\u2026!\u201dShe mistakenly believed that Murakan was an assassin. There was not a single speck of hesitation in her mind.As he stood agape, Jin could feel something slowly escape his mouth. It was most probably his soul and his hope for the future\u2026\u201cG-Gilly.\u201d\u201cPlease stay back, Young Master! He is an extremely skilled assassin. To think he sneaked into your room without a single trace of his presence\u2026!\u201dIt was not surprising that Gilly hadn\u2019t sensed Murakan\u2019s presence despite standing guard in front of the room the entire time Jin was sleeping. Because moments ago, Murakan was\u2026 merely a small cat.In an instant, Jin came up with dozens of excuses he could use in order to deal with this unplanned situation peacefully.\u2026None of them were good excuses.\u2018It\u2019s impossible. There\u2019s no way to handle this situation without telling her the truth.\u2019Sigh!Jin took in a deep breath before opening his mouth.\u201cGilly, that man isn\u2019t an assassin. Retract your claw.\u201dThe nanny\u2019s eyes opened wide. She then swiftly stood up and took a few steps back. Murakan, who had his arm twisted backwards until a few moments ago, was now coughing and writhing on the floor.\u201cYoung Master, who is\u2026\u201d\u201cOnce you\u2019ve apologized properly, greet him with respect. He is the clan\u2019s guardian, Black Dragon Murakan.\u201dGilly couldn\u2019t believe her own ears.This shabby-looking pathetic man\u2014who was still grunting on the floor\u2014was the Great Black Dragon Murakan? This man, who was still agonizing due to that small arm twist, was the clan\u2019s guardian?The reason Murakan was in so much pain wasn\u2019t due to Gilly\u2019s overwhelming strength, but because of the side effects of his transformation. But there was no way Gilly would know that. In fact, even Jin wasn\u2019t told about these side effects.After observing Jin\u2019s expression, Gilly obediently followed his order.\u201cAs a lowly member of the Runcandel Clan, I have shown great disrespect to the clan\u2019s guardian. Please have mercy on me.\u201d\u201cUrghhh\u2026\u201dMurakan flipped around and stared blankly at Gilly.\u201cI forgive you\u2026 my strawberry pie.\u201dStrawberry pie!As soon as she heard those words, Gilly finally realized the truth.The reason why Jin was always craving for strawberry pies. The reason he\u2019d always go down the burrow in the Storm Castle\u2019s backyard, and why he\u2019d always take those pies with him.She had no definite proof, but her intuition had already come to a conclusion.Whoooosh\u2026!A gust of cold wind blew from the window. In the quiet winter air, the three individuals only exchanged awkward glances and stares.\u201cGilly.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 Young Master.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the entire truth, so could you close the door?\u201dCreak.Once the deed was done, Jin began recounting and explaining his recent years spent at the Storm Castle. Although he didn\u2019t mention his regression, he did tell her about his transcription of the secret tomes and about his status as Solderet\u2019s contractor.Surprisingly, Gilly stayed calm and composed during Jin\u2019s story. She did, however, nod intensely during the entire time.\u201cSo now, you\u2019re also an accomplice. I cannot let the clan know about Murakan\u2019s awakening, nor about my connection with him yet.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019ll be in your care from now on, Strawberry Pie.\u201dIt was at this moment the informal group of three Runcandels\u2014composed of a nanny, a child, and a dragon\u2014was formed.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 \u2013 Garden of Swords (1)\u201cI mean, why didn\u2019t you tell me about the side effects of the transformation before?\u201dOne hour had passed since the creation of the informal group of three Runcandels.Outside the inn, the Black King Mercenaries were busy preparing to depart. Meanwhile, the three members of the new group were sitting in a circle in Jin\u2019s room, having a friendly conversation.\u201cKid, try sleeping for a thousand years yourself. When you finally wake up, your mind doesn\u2019t function properly, alright? Anyways, I totally forgot to tell you about it. Not only that, it\u2019s been so long that it\u2019s hard to maintain a transformation.\u201d\u201cYou crazy dragon. You almost ended up staying in the form of a cat for eternity!\u201dA special privilege given to dragons only: transformation.While it\u2019s a privilege, it\u2019s by no means an ability that can be called a \u2018blessing\u2019. In fact, there are a few crucial and fatal restrictions to this ability.Firstly, a dragon in a transformed state is extremely weak.If one transforms into a cat, they only have the fighting prowess of a cat. The same would happen if one transforms into a lion, fish, bird, or any other animal.Secondly, if the transformation exceeds a time limit, the dragon becomes incapable of returning to its original form on its own.Once they reach that point, the dragon begins to lose its ego and consciousness as the mighty beast, and will end up gaining the mind of the animal they transformed into.\u201cThat was close. Too close. I was freaking out. In the past, I once saw a dragon transform into a fish and enjoy a leisurely life, but they ended up getting caught by a fisherman. I laughed for around 200 years because of that~ But damn, I almost ended up having the same fate\u2026\u201d\u201cHahaha! I can\u2019t believe there are actually such stupid dragons out th\u2014oops.\u201dAfter accidentally letting her inner thoughts escape, Gilly immediately fixed her expression and attitude.\u201cApologies, Young Master, Lord Murakan.\u201d\u201cWhy are you apologizing, Strawberry Pie?\u201d\u201cIt was unmannerly of me to laugh out loud while on duty.\u201d\u201cGeez, are you some sort of golem, Strawberry Pie? Every human should be allowed to laugh, no? Oi, kid! Did you not even allow your nanny to laugh thus far?\u201d\u201cL-Lord Murakan, the young master isn\u2019t at fault. He treats me very well all the time.\u201d\u201cIf he treats you badly from now on, don\u2019t hesitate to tell me. I\u2019ll teach him a lesson.\u201d\u2018They\u2019re getting along pretty well\u2026\u2019Jin lightly chuckled to himself. He hadn\u2019t seen Gilly be so lively in a long time.\u201cBy the way, Murakan, do the restrictions not apply when you\u2019re transformed as a human?\u201d\u201cYeah. There aren\u2019t any huge limitations when it comes to transforming into a human. In fact, it\u2019s more comfortable being a human. When we\u2019re in our original forms, we continuously consume mana. It takes a lot of energy to maintain such a large body.\u201d\u201cWhy are there no restrictions for human transformations?\u201d\u201cThe gods were being considerate to us dragons. When we\u2019re born, we look the same as humans, you know? In our dragon forms, it\u2019s difficult to propagate as a species and satisfy our various desires, so\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s already too much information.\u201dFor some reason, Murakan was cracking up on his own as if he had heard a hilarious joke. Surprisingly, the corners of Gilly\u2019s mouth were trembling as she tried her hardest to hold back her laughter.\u2018I\u2019m so done with them.\u2019Although that thought came to Jin\u2019s mind, he didn\u2019t really mean it. Even though this team was formed on the spur of the moment, Jin didn\u2019t dislike their strange interactions and atmosphere.In fact, he quite enjoyed being with them. Having trustworthy comrades he could share his secrets with was convenient and pleasant.\u201cAnyways, we\u2019ll be leaving soon. Transform into a cat again.\u201dMurakan grumbled as he became an adorable black cat again. He would have to continue doing this until Jin became strong enough.For the next two days, the Black King Mercenaries properly escorted Jin and company to the Mitel Kingdom\u2019s capital. It wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to compare the mercenaries to actual knights for their surprising dignity and the courtesy they showed to their clients.However, they never understood why their client picked up a black cat halfway through their journey.The Black King Mercenaries just came to the conclusion that the tiny yet merciless overlord called Jin also had a childish aspect to him.\u201cThank you for your work, Vice-Captain Murka of the Black King Mercenaries\u2019 3rd Corps. The Runcandel Clan\u2019s main house will properly reward you for escorting us\u2014which wasn\u2019t part of the original commission\u2014on a later date.\u201d\u201cThis mission was also a good experience for us, Gilly. I can\u2019t wait to see the future of the young Runcandel you serve.\u201dGilly and Murka exchanged their farewells while Jin watched from a distance with a cat on his shoulder.\u201cBy the way, Gilly McRolan.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Murka?\u201d\u201cI may be overstepping my boundaries, but I\u2019ve come to admire you after seeing you in battle. Therefore, as a warrior who makes a living by fighting, I must ask you. Why did the McRolan Clan do such a thing to y\u2014\u201dGilly\u2019s expression immediately darkened. Murka swiftly shook his hand and coughed loudly.\u201cI apologize. I shouldn\u2019t have. If only I could punch myself from 10 seconds ago.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine. Well then, I wish you the best.\u201dAs soon as the Black King Mercenaries took their leave, Gilly sighed deeply. Once she fixed her appearance, she joined Jin and Murakan, and they went to the administrative office of the Mitel Kingdom\u2019s transfer gate.\u201cWelcome to the Mitel Transfer Gate. Do you have any identification?\u201dGilly presented a dagger with the Runcandel emblem, the \u2018Black Sword\u2019, engraved on it.\u201cOh! So you belong to the Runcandel Clan. It\u2019s an honour to meet you. Are you headed to the Huphester Alliance\u2019s Karlon City?\u201dKarlon is the city where the Runcandel main house, \u2018Garden of Swords\u2019, is located. In addition, the Huphester Alliance was a group of nations under the rule of the Runcandels.\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cPlease come this way. I will lead you to the first-class seats.\u201dSince the Mitel Kingdom was part of the Huphester Alliance, it was basically part of the Runcandel Clan\u2019s territory. The manager of the transfer gate guided Jin and his companions with a beaming smile, as if it was the greatest thing to happen in his life.\u201cWe will depart in two hours and arrive in the blink of an eye. I hope you have a comfortable journey.\u201dThe Mitel Special Transfer Gate had a waiting room which was as luxurious as a rich noble\u2019s living room. There was no other client using the first-class waiting room.Jin leaped onto a soft sofa and took out his notebook as his body sank in it. He had gained the habit of using any free time to study from his days as a magician in his past life.\u201cSigh,\u00a0Young Master.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf I were to be fully honest, I\u2019m quite worried. We could somehow find a way to explain your contract with a god and Lord Murakan\u2019s true identity if the clan were to find out, but\u2026\u201d\u201cMy magic is the problem, right?\u201d\u201cYes. That is the one thing the Runcandels will never tolerate and approve of.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll make sure to keep it a secr\u2014\u201dSuddenly, the door to the first-class waiting room was swung open.It was a young boy who appeared to be from a noble family. He had light brown skin, and seemed taller than Jin by 20 centimeters. He was accompanied by two escorts.As soon as they stepped inside the room, the atmosphere changed. Tension grew in the air as Gilly and the noble boy\u2019s escorts glared at each other.This situation was inevitable, as Runcandels and Zipfels had come face to face in person.\u2018Members of the Zipfel Clan? Who exactly are these assholes?\u2019Jin calmly observed the Zipfel boy\u2019s face and pondered. His face seemed somewhat familiar, but Jin couldn\u2019t quite remember who that was. He hadn\u2019t seen many Zipfels from close up in his past life.\u201cNo wonder I didn\u2019t want to come to Huphester. My instincts were warning me that I\u2019d come across these cocksuckers.\u201dThe Zipfel boy, who was still by the entrance and distant from Jin\u2019s position, muttered audibly. His escorts were now also quietly observing Jin once they were done scrutinizing Gilly.It was just a childish provocation.The veins on Gilly\u2019s neck began popping out, but since Jin remained silent and was observing the situation, she didn\u2019t step forward.\u201cMeow~\u201dMurakan was walking in circles between the opposing groups, meowing as if he found the situation entertaining.\u201cOh, at least the cat they\u2019re raising is cute. Those cowards don\u2019t deserve to raise such a cute pet. Come over here, kitty~\u201d\u201cMeow!\u201dThe tiny Murakan leaped into the Zipfel boy\u2019s arms. He let the boy stroke him for a moment, until\u2026\u201cKyaa!\u201dThe cat brandished its claws and scratched the boy\u2019s nose before quickly escaping his grasp.Pfft!Seeing this spectacle, Jin couldn\u2019t help but burst out in laughter.\u201cUrgh!\u201d\u201c8th Young Master!\u201dAs the escorts attempted to draw their swords on their waists, the boy raised his hands to stop them.\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just a light scratch. No need to overreact because of a cat. I guess I deserved it for provoking them.\u201d(T/N: Good, I like this kid. No one should hurt pets, especially cats. Cats are the bestest~~!)As he wiped the blood on the bridge of his nose, the boy continued speaking.\u201c\u2026And above all, drawing your swords before Runcandels is a foolish act.\u201dThe boy shrugged and directed his gaze to Jin.\u2018I was mistaken. He\u2019s not a coward, he\u2019s calmly watching us. No, maybe he just doesn\u2019t care about us?\u2019The boy had intentionally provoked Jin as soon as he entered the waiting room in order to check Jin\u2019s reaction.He wanted to know whether the youngest child of the Runcandels\u2014who had just left the Storm Castle\u2014was promising and showed potential or not. The boy promptly made his mind about the Runcandel before him.\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you an interesting one, Jin Runcandel?\u201dThe boy approached Jin and extended his hand.\u201cI\u2019m Beradin Zipfel. I only provoked you to test you, but allow me to apologize properly.\u201dBeradin Zipfel!As soon as he heard the name, Jin finally remembered why the boy before him looked so familiar.In his past life, Beradin became a 9-star magician by the age of 30, and was near-unanimously chosen to become the next Zipfel patriarch. As he was a famous and influential figure, Jin had often seen his face in the newspaper along with news of his achievements.Having equally great skills and personality, he was highly popular and idolized by young magicians around the world.Jin\u2014who had just become a 5-star magician\u2014also looked up to Beradin and considered him a goal he could never catch up to.\u201cIs that so? I was also quietly observing you to see what kind of a person you are, so it\u2019s a relief to see you\u2019re not a complete moron.\u201d\u201cOho, why did you make such a judgement?\u201d\u201cEven if it was just a joke, had you allowed your subordinates to draw their swords, you would\u2019ve had to travel around Huphester without any attendants. You would\u2019ve also lost a couple fingers.\u201d\u201cHaha, what an entertaining joke.\u201d\u201cDo I sound like I\u2019m joking?\u201dAs Beradin received Jin\u2019s cold gaze upfront, he flinched and pursed his lips.\u201c\u2026Well, fine. You\u2019re a confident one. But let me give you some advice as someone who\u2019s in similar circumstances as you. Next time you meet a rude Zipfel who does something offensive, don\u2019t recklessly cut off their fingers. It would stir trouble in both our clans, don\u2019t you think?\u201dBeradin was warning Jin not to carelessly start a war between the two clans.It was actual serious advice coming from a member of the enemy clan.\u201cNow that\u2019s what a real joke sounds like, Beradin Zipfel.\u201d\u201cHm? Why do you say so? If the Zipfels and Runcandels fought to the death for every trivial issue we faced, the world wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the bloody battles. I\u2019m telling you to keep in mind the potential disasters and chaos the innocent civilians would face because of us.\u201d\u201cMy father, Cyron Runcandel, and your father, Kelliark Zipfel.\u201dJin smirked before continuing his words.\u201cDo you really think they would mobilize their entire clans due to a trivial quarrel between kids?\u201dBeradin\u2019s eyes opened wide, as if he had nothing to say to Jin\u2019s words.\u201cEven if I were to cut off your fingers today, the Runcandels and Zipfels wouldn\u2019t go to war. We\u2019d just have to pay a few thousand gold bars or something.\u201dBeradin stared dumbfounded and blinked several times before nodding his head.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat was surprisingly enlightening and informative. I shall definitely repay this debt to you in the future.\u201d\u201cForget about the future. Repay it now.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cJust wait silently until the transfer gate activates. Don\u2019t disturb my quiet time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did glance at Jin from time to time to check what the Runcandel boy was doing.\u2018Jin Runcandel\u2026 I\u2019m certain he\u2019ll shake the world and spread his name within a few years. Ugh, I\u2019m so curious! I wanna talk with him a bit more, but he doesn\u2019t want me to.\u2019Beradin\u2019s eyes were gleaming with curiosity as he kept glancing at the 10-year-old. They had only shared a short conversation, but their encounter was a refreshing and exciting one.Hence, there was a certain amount of goodwill within Beradin\u2019s curious gaze.\u2018If he weren\u2019t a Runcandel, we could\u2019ve been good friends\u2026 Oh well, let\u2019s be satisfied with the fact that I discovered a worthy enemy. In fact, he might become my lifelong rival!\u2019Beradin quietly chuckled as he let his imagination fly to the skies. In the meantime, Jin also thought to himself.\u2018Whether he was a celebrity amongst magicians before my regression or not, he\u2019s somewhat of a pain in the ass.\u2019As a matter of fact, whenever Beradin stared at Jin and they made eye contact, the Zipfel boy would turn his head away with a blush.(T/N: Is this a BL ship??? Or is he a reverse trap????)(PR/N: Ohoho~? Fujoshi senses are tingling\u2014)\u2018That red face and that gaze\u2026 He\u2019s definitely some sort of lunatic.\u00a0Sigh, should I really cut off a couple of fingers to set his head straight?\u2019There was no way Jin could concentrate when such a disturbing gaze was directed towards him. In the end, he just closed his notebook and put it away. As they waited for the transfer gate to activate, Jin just petted the cat Murakan.\u201cThank you for your patience. You shall be teleported in a few moments. There may be side effects from the teleportation, such as headaches or nausea, so please be seated as we\u2026\u201dWhirrrrr!Blue mana began to dye the special waiting room. It then softly covered the members inside.\u201cI had fun. Let\u2019s meet again, Jin Runcandel!\u201dBeradin shouted with an excited voice. Since their destinations were different, this was the only opportunity he had to bid Jin farewell.\u201cYeah, whatever.\u201dBut Beradin couldn\u2019t hear Jin\u2019s reply.He was sent to his destination and had to deal with formalities for his entry in the country, whereas Jin and his companions were directly sent to another first-class waiting room.The Runcandel Clan held absolute power within the Huphester Alliance along with a great reputation. On the other hand, the Zipfels were absolutely detested, which led to some discrimination in their treatments.Most places in the world loved one clan and hated the other, and vice versa. There weren\u2019t many nations which were free from the two clans\u2019 influence.\u201cBlaargh, urrggh\u2026!\u201dPat, pat.Gilly was awkwardly patting Murakan\u2019s back, unable to do anything else to help.\u201cGeez, you\u2019re one pathetic dragon\u2026\u201d\u201cBlargh, urgh, keuk!\u00a0We didn\u2019t have these kinds of devices in my era.\u00a0Urgh, it\u2019s like my organs were flipped around.\u201dIt had only been a hundred years since magicians had developed transfer gates.But since the gates were invented based on humans, it wasn\u2019t quite suitable for dragons. After retching for a while, Murakan exhaled deeply as if he could finally breathe properly.\u201cAre you alright, Lord Murakan?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s been a thousand years since I last threw up. In the past, there were even some morons who\u2019d use dragon puke as ingredients for perfume.\u201d\u201cThey still do that today. If you gather what you just puked and take it to some nobles, they\u2019d instantly buy it with gold coins.\u201d\u201cOh, they still do it today? Is there anything you want, Strawberry Pie? I could go sell this and\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough talking. Just throw it in the incinerator over there. Our clansmen are probably waiting outside right now.\u201dOnce they exited the waiting room, they were welcomed by the quiet scenery of the Huphester Alliance\u2019s transfer gate.Generally speaking, there would be countless people in the area, but since the Runcandel youngest child was coming today, the administration had set up severe regulations.Clang, clang!A group of knights approached Jin and his crew. They were Runcandel guardian knights.\u201cWe have been expecting you, Young Master. Pleased to meet you. I am Petro, the second butler of the house.\u201dThe middle-aged man at the center of the knights spoke up.Jin and the others got on the steel carriage prepared in advance and headed to the Garden of Swords.Garden of Swords.The place that symbolized and represented the Runcandels.As the name suggested, the wide and vast garden had more swords planted in the ground than flowers or trees.The thousands of swords belonged to deceased Runcandels and clansmen, but not just any clansmen. One didn\u2019t obtain the right to have their swords planted in the garden just because they were a member of the clan.It was a special right only granted to clansmen who had contributed to the clan\u2019s growth and prosperity.Once they entered the Garden of Swords, the steel carriage began to slow down. Jin watched the countless swords pass by outside the window, and mulled over the past.\u2018It was once my greatest wish in life to have my sword planted in this garden.\u2019Why was he so naive and foolish back then?Had he accepted the reality of his situation earlier, Jin would\u2019ve left the clan sooner than he did in his first life. The clan would never allow the \u2018clan\u2019s disgrace\u2019\u2014who became a 1-star knight at the age of 25\u2014to plant his sword in the garden.\u2018Why\u2026 Why was I so naive and foolish?\u2019Jin asked himself a second time. He already knew the answer to his question. The boy only asked himself again to remind himself of his past mistakes, and to steel himself now that he had returned to the clan\u2019s main house.\u2018I was weak. A weak person can only survive and thrive by being smart and cunning, but that wasn\u2019t the case for me either.\u2019Jin smirked and closed his eyes.His gift with the sword he regained after contracting Solderet, his gift with magic he\u2019d always had, the tricks he learned over 38 years of life and his maturity, the recklessness and guts one can only obtain by dying once, the knowledge about the future only a regressor can acquire.Finally, Gilly and Murakan. Powerful allies he could share his secrets with. Moreover, one of them was the legendary Black Dragon.\u2018Right. This time, I\u2019ll survive and thrive in this shitty hellhole.\u2019This was only the beginning.Jin believed that he would be nervous on his way to the Garden of Swords, but it was the opposite. In fact, the sight of the swords planted in the garden made him gain confidence and mental fortitude.\u201cAll hail!\u201d\u201cAll hail!\u201dThe carriage came to a stop at the center of the garden. The guardian knights who were on duty raised their blades and gave a sword salute.Standing before them were Jin\u2019s 12 siblings and\u2026 his parents.The Runcandel Clan masters and all the potential successors to the throne were gathered in one place. Having every single direct descendant of the Runcandel bloodline together was an extremely rare occasion.Creak\u2026The butler Petro opened the carriage door. Jin gently descended with Gilly and Murakan in his arms. As soon as she got down, Gilly bowed deeply before Cyron and Jin lowered his head.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, my child.\u201dJin\u2019s mother, Rosa Runcandel was the first to speak.\u201cYes, mother.\u201dStep, step.Jin slowly walked towards his parents. As he tread forwards, Jin could feel the gazes of his siblings who were standing in line on both sides.Murakan was the cause of this. Their youngest sibling\u2014who had caught their father\u2019s attention\u2014was lovingly caring for a cat. They showed a mixture of surprise, amazement, and ridicule.As Cyron frowned, he asked Jin.\u201cDid you pick it up?\u201dAgain, it was about Murakan.Jin had expected his father to ask this question first before any greeting. And he also knew what to answer in order to satisfy this nitpicky man, who happened to be the world\u2019s strongest.\u201cI acquired it, father.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t pick it up, but acquired it\u2026?\u201dThe corners of Cyron\u2019s mouth rose to shape a light grin.\u201cA bold and confident answer. I like it. That\u2019s right. It\u2019s only proper for a Runcandel to have such an attitude when they obtain something.\u201dSome of his siblings\u2019 expressions turned grim. Probably because they had been severely punished by their father before when they picked up a cute pet.Or maybe some of them just didn\u2019t like Jin.The 10-year-old turned his head to observe each of his siblings.\u2018Among them\u2026 is the one who cursed me.\u2019Who could it be?Ever since the day he saw the curse with his own two eyes inside his cradle nine years ago, Jin asked himself this question on a daily basis.And why did they curse him?Why curse their 1-year-old sibling who hadn\u2019t done anything? Why did they attempt to curse him\u2014a curse that would give him a fate far worse than death as a Runcandel?\u2018Is it just because I chose Barisada on my Selection Ritual? Or are they trying to get rid of every competitor for the throne, and I just happened to be an easy target?\u2019Jin wanted to question all his siblings immediately, but this wasn\u2019t the right moment.None of his 12 siblings were weaker than the current Jin. Even the Tona twins\u2014the idiots he used to boss around at the Storm Castle\u2014had trained their swordsmanship for two years, so they were most likely stronger than Jin.\u2018Moreover, today is a joyous day where the entire family has finally reunited, isn\u2019t it?\u2019The days filled with bloodshed were about to begin.As he smiled with somewhat malicious intent, Jin put Murakan down.\u201cMeow.\u201dThe cat leaped into Rosa\u2019s arms. Surprisingly, she simply caught it and began calmly stroking its fur.\u201cSon, what is this child\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cHis name is Nabi Runcandel, mother.\u201d(T/N: \u2018Nabi\u2019 means \u2018butterfly\u2019 in Korean.)Pfft.Rosa couldn\u2019t hold back her laughter, and most of his siblings wore a sinister look. Cyron stared at Jin in silence.\u201cFather, mother! No matter how young he is, this is unacceptable.\u201d\u201cHow dare he give the Runcandel family name to such a lowly beast! I also agree with Fourth Brother\u2019s opinion.\u201d\u201cGilly! You wench, how on earth did you educate the youngest? How could you let him call a mere cat such a name\u2026!\u201dThere was a hurl of complaints. But as soon as Cyron opened his mouth, everyone immediately shut up.\u201cWhy did you give it the Runcandel family name?\u201dJin made eye contact with Cyron and answered.\u201cIt was to give myself a sense of responsibility. He may be a mere cat, but he is the first living being I\u2019ve acquired. I thought that I should give him a name with meaning and weight.\u201dThe gaze of the silent siblings were dyed with shock, and Cyron calmly nodded.\u201cHow amusing. But son\u2026 Do you truly realize how much weight the Runcandel name actually bears?\u201dIt was a tricky question, but Jin nodded without hesitation.\u201cI am aware of the weight it has. It signifies that if someone were to attempt to hurt Nabi, I would have to make them pay the price personally.\u201dThe death stares directed by the Tona twins promptly changed into shock.They believed that they wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid of Jin anymore, but seeing his current attitude, their trauma from the Storm Castle resurfaced.\u201cYou seem to be gifted at making enemies, son. Your siblings are glaring at you so intensely, don\u2019t you think?\u201dThis was a warning.Not towards Jin\u2014who had caused a ruckus as soon as he arrived at the main house\u2014but towards the others. A warning to them for daring to show killing intent in front of the patriarch.The siblings immediately adjusted their expressions and stances.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt appears so. But I believe I\u2019m also gifted at killing my enemies, father.\u201d\u201cKuhaha\u2026 Then you all should be mindful of that when dealing with your strong-willed little brother.\u201dCyron\u2019s children, with the exception of Jin, all lowered their heads in response to their father\u2019s statement.Soon afterwards, every Runcandel gathered today entered the mansion, and the banquet celebrating Jin\u2019s arrival began.During the entire meal, most of the siblings stared at their ludicrous youngest brother with complex feelings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 \u2013 What Even is the Eye of the Mind? (1)It is the beginning of summer, 1794.Four years have passed since Jin returned to the main house.\u201cWe will end the training with this. Good work today, Young Master.\u201d\u201cPhew, is it already time, Garon?\u201dGaron Altemiro.This young 7-star knight teaches the basics and foundations of swordsmanship at the Garden of Swords.His pupils include Runcandel children when they first arrive at the main house, and clansmen who are training to become guardian knights. Every Runcandel has to learn the basics under Garon.\u201cHaha, surely you jest. Please take a look at the guardian cadets around you, Young Master. They are all on death\u2019s door.\u201dJin took a look around him. There were young boys and girls around his age. Just as Garon stated, they were all sweating profusely, panting and wheezing to catch their breaths.\u2018I guess he\u2019s right. I would\u2019ve been in the same state as them.\u2019Two years ago, when Garon was assigned this job, his training regimen quickly gained the reputation of being harsh and intense.Guardian cadets are young elite trainees who stood out amongst other trainees and were selected to become future guardian knights. The competition to become a guardian cadet is high, and trainees have to undergo difficult training in order to gain that rank.However, despite their expertise and experience, many guardian cadets dropped out due to being unable to endure Garon\u2019s severe training.Jin did the same in his past life. He couldn\u2019t continue Garon\u2019s training regimen, and instead received individual lessons from his siblings. It may appear like preferential treatment, but for Runcandels, there is no greater disgrace.Even though other children are able to withstand Garon\u2019s lessons, a Runcandel child dropping out and being taught by his siblings is unacceptable. Not to mention that Jin couldn\u2019t endure his siblings\u2019 lessons either, and ended up being neglected by everyone.Having recalled the past, Jin shook his head to stop thinking about it.\u201cMoreover, you will have to attend Lady Luna\u2019s training session in the afternoon.\u201dJin nodded to Garon\u2019s point.These days, Jin trains under Garon as well his eldest sister, Luna \u201cWhite Whale\u201d Runcandel.However, unlike his first life, it wasn\u2019t a disgraceful individual lesson. Having noticed Jin\u2019s terrifying growth speed, Luna volunteered to teach him herself. Thus, it was an achievement instead of a disgrace.However, it brought Jin both the admiration from the guardian cadets and the jealousy from his other siblings.\u201cThat\u2019s true. Then I should go get lunch now.\u201d\u201cWill you partake with the other cadets today as well? Dame Rosa appears to be dejected for being unable to eat with you every time\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019d rather eat with these cadets with whom I train every day, not my siblings who seem displeased about my very existence.\u201d\u201cI understand, Young Master.\u201dServants began to bring their meals to the training ground.There was an enormous pot with rice, vegetables and meat. It was a simple and crude meal, but the ingredients were top-class.The guardian cadets stood in line, waiting for the food to be distributed. Jin didn\u2019t follow them since \u2018Bellop\u2019 was in charge of getting his food.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cNot at all, Young Master.\u201d\u201cAs if. Sit down, let\u2019s eat.\u201dBellop Schmitz. A 13-year-old commoner boy, one year younger than Jin.He was destined to fall behind in Garon\u2019s training and lose his qualifications as a guardian cadet, getting kicked out of the Garden of Swords.At least, that was before Jin\u2019s regression.\u201cIs it good?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s delicious. I am always grateful to the clan for allowing me to eat such good meat, as well as to the 13th Young Master for sharing his portion of meat with me\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough, enough.\u00a0Sigh, how do you give the same answer every single time without a single mistake? Did you memorize the phrase by heart or something?\u201dBellop coughed and blushed in embarrassment.\u201cYou need to learn how to speak simply and concisely, Bellop. The others are ignoring you because you keep giving a speech every time you open your mouth, you know?\u201d\u201cI-Is that so\u2026\u201d\u201cShoulders straight! Have some more pride. You\u2019re a Runcandel guardian cadet.\u201d\u201cBut my grades are the lowest, and I have yet to become a 1-star knight\u2026\u201d\u201cGeez, do you think anyone can become a Runcandel cadet? You\u2019ve already achieved a lot by reaching where you are currently.\u201dHe\u2019s quite timid, and has little to no self-confidence. He\u2019s as innocent and naive as one can be.That\u2019s why Jin was still confused.\u2018I can see why the clan kicked him out. But I still can\u2019t figure out how such an innocent boy grew up to become the Vermont Empire\u2019s notorious imperial guard.\u2019Before his regression, Bellop\u2019s life ended up having an amazing reversal after getting kicked out of the Runcandel Clan.After barely passing the exam to become a guardian cadet, Bellop Schmitz always stayed amongst the worst of the cadets, before having to leave\u2026 But afterwards, he caught the eye of another clan of swordsmen, the Hairan Clan.The Hairan Clan is the empire\u2019s greatest clan of swordsmen, and one of the biggest noble families.Bellop\u2019s talent with the sword bloomed belatedly in the Hairan Clan. He then became an imperial guard and received the nickname \u201cVermont\u2019s Loyal Hound\u201d.Vermont\u2019s Loyal Hound.Jin had no idea what Bellop experienced at the Hairan Clan for him to change so much.When Bellop received that nickname, he was no longer the naive and gentle Bellop Jin now knows. He followed the emperor\u2019s orders, led the imperial guards to battle, and slaughtered countless people without mercy.But one year before Jin\u2019s death, Bellop ended his unfortunate life filled with bloodshed himself, leaving behind a will with a message of repentance.\u2018I was shocked to hear he became the imperial guard, and felt vexed when the news of his suicide reached me.\u2019Jin glanced at his surroundings. After making sure no one else was looking in their direction, he quickly passed his remaining pieces of meat to Bellop.\u201cEh, Young Master?\u201d\u201cShush. I\u2019m not feeling hungry.\u201dJin pretended to eat until lunchtime ended as he vacantly watched Bellop.\u2018Bellop Schmitz\u2026 This time, I\u2019ll take care of you so that you don\u2019t fall behind and get kicked out.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just because Jin wanted to keep this diamond in the rough within the clan.He also felt somewhat empathetic towards this boy. Both had discovered their true talents belatedly, and had miserable deaths.\u2018If he has the potential to become an imperial guard, it would also be beneficial to keep him by my side. I\u2019ll have to keep guardian knights around me and command them in the future, anyways.\u2019Instead of becoming a murder puppet of the Vermont Empire, it was favourable for both Bellop and Jin to raise him as a Runcandel guardian knight.Once lunch ended, Jin stood up and Garon approached him.\u201cI shall see you tomorrow, Young Master. Oh, tomorrow we\u2019ll be having spars during training.\u201d\u201cAlright. Good work today, Garon.\u201d\u201cThank you, Young Master.\u201dOnce Jin returned to his room, there stood Gilly with a change of clothes in her arms and a hot bath behind her.\u201cGood work during training, Young Master. The eldest lady\u2019s lesson will begin in three hours.\u201d\u201cAlright. Thanks, Strawberry P\u2014\u201dCatching himself saying something unexpected, Jin suddenly stopped dead in his tracks.\u201cGeez, Murakan calls you Strawberry Pie so often that even I\u2019m getting confused now\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re here, kid?\u201dJin turned his head and saw Murakan lazily flipping through an erotic drawing magazine on the sofa.\u201cYou crazy dragon, what on earth are you reading in broad daylight?\u201d\u201cThis? A limited edition erotic magazine. I had a hard time getting this. Haha, don\u2019t hesitate to tell me if you want one too. Fourteen is the age when you begin to get horn\u2026\u201d\u201cAlso. Didn\u2019t. I. Tell. You. To. Stay. In. Cat. Form. As. Much. As. Possible. At. Home? What if someone sees you?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t get caught, don\u2019t worry. I also have the right to be free, no? Just come over and look at this. Should I kidnap the guy who drew this?\u201dSeeing him snicker and return to his erotic magazine, Jin suddenly gained the urge to punch the dragon in the face.However, punching a dragon who had lived for thousands of years was unreasonable. Jin gave a deep sigh and sat beside Murakan.\u201cI guess it\u2019s not bad. How much did you buy it for?\u201d\u201cAbout 100 gold coins, I think\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, izzat so? A hundred gold coins, you say? A hundred\u2026 gold coins. Where on earth did you find that money?\u201d\u201cI borrowed from Strawberry Pie. Gosh, the Runcandel nannies\u2019 salary is no joke.\u201dJin turned his gaze to Gilly, who only gave a dry cough.\u201cSigh,\u00a0just tell me if you need money from now on. Don\u2019t bother Gilly.\u201d\u201cReally? Then 1000 gold coins please~\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you 1000 gold coins if you write a report which explains why you need that money. And please prepare a simple meal for me, Gilly.\u201dMurakan closed and put away the magazine at the speed of light and began writing a report. He even started mumbling to himself. This disturbing sight of extreme tenacity made Jin speechless.\u201cDid you not have lunch outside already?\u201d\u201cI did, but I\u2019m at the age where I\u2019m growing.\u201d\u201cWhat would you like to have?\u201d\u201cJust a simple sandwich.\u201d\u201cStrawberry Pie, I\u2019d like a strawberry pie.\u201dAn hour had passed by the time Jin finished eating.During the two hours until Luna\u2019s lesson, Jin sat in his room and practiced releasing his spiritual energy.\u2018I\u2019m about to reach 2-star in spiritual release\u2026 4-star in mana and 2-star in swordsmanship.\u2019These were the results of four years of training after leaving the Storm Castle.His growth speed in spiritual release was far beyond what Murakan was expecting. However, the growth of his mana was far too slow according to Jin\u2019s standards. But it wasn\u2019t exactly a surprise since he couldn\u2019t use magic within the Garden of Swords.Still, reaching the 4-star stage at the age of fourteen was an incredible achievement that was comparable to the geniuses at the Zipfel Clan.His swordsmanship would also reach 3-star by the age of sixteen, which was one year earlier than the \u2018Runcandel average\u2019.Jin\u2019s growth was progressing favourably.Feeling himself getting stronger by the day was the best feeling there could ever be.There was Garon\u2019s intense training regimen, Jin\u2019s notebook which he studied every day, and his spiritual energy he would strengthen whenever he had time.All these activities were far more enjoyable than resting for the 14-year-old boy.However, Luna\u2019s training was\u2026 pure drudgery, even for the workaholic Jin.\u2018Even our other siblings who envy me for receiving her guidance would immediately change their minds if they were in my shoes.\u2019Jin smiled bitterly in his heart before looking up at Luna.\u201cMy dearest brother.\u201d\u201cYes, sister?\u201d\u201cToday\u2019s training will be the same as yesterday.\u201d\u201cI am aware.\u201d\u201cBut you will have to change your approach and methods every day during this repetitive training.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLuna walked towards Jin and closed her eyes. Jin copied her and also closed his.Then, the same line he had heard over and over during the past month resounded.\u201cBrother. The eye of the mind\u2026 Use the eye of the mind to observe\u2026\u201dThis was the drudgery in question.Luna\u2019s lessons weren\u2019t methodical, intuitive and physically painful like Garon\u2019s lessons.It was always about\u2026 the eye of the mind!She would just repeat that.\u2018This is driving me crazy.\u2019Jin had often heard the 8-star and above knights mention the \u2018Mind\u2019s Blade\u2019 realm.But normally speaking, one would start training the Mind\u2019s Blade after reaching the 7-star stage. And it wouldn\u2019t be through silent lessons like this, but\u2026 by trying to scatter aura in all directions naturally.\u2018Why doesn\u2019t Eldest Sister do or say anything else? She always stands still, telling me to open the eye of the mind.\u2019He had never heard of a training like this.\u201cFor people who wield blades to advance in life, gaining the Mind\u2019s Eye is the most important thing of all. Never open your physical eyes during our training.\u201dNevertheless, Jin obeyed his eldest sister\u2019s guidance and kept his eyes closed because he knew her personality. Moreover, she was widely known as the strongest among the 13 Runcandel children.If any other sibling were to teach Jin like Luna was currently doing, he would\u2019ve thought that they were trying to obstruct Jin\u2019s growth with some bullshit. Or maybe that they had become a fanatic of some pseudo-religion.\u2018I\u2019m sure the day will come when I finally understand Eldest Sister\u2019s guidance.\u2019The two of them stood facing each other, eyes closed, until evening came. Once their lesson ended, Luna wore a refreshing smile.\u201cYou did good today. You can head back now, brother.\u201dJin had absolutely no idea what he had done well, but he could only nod to her statement.Jin began walking away and Luna pondered as she watched his back.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018The incredible concentration he shows when he closes his eyes, and the tenacity to maintain that posture for several hours\u2026 With Jin\u2019s potential, he should realize it within a few years. Keep growing like this, Jin.\u2019Luna wore a satisfied smile and closed her eyes once again.Even as a 9-star knight, she had yet to have the second enlightenment necessary to reach the Mind\u2019s Eye realm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 \u2013 What Even is the Eye of the Mind? (2)What even is the eye of the mind?Whenever his training with Luna ended, Jin never failed to ask himself this question. He continued pondering about this for days and weeks since the start of the training, due to which his head hurt and frustration grew inside.This time, his concern lasted until the very next day.Luna\u2019s training most definitely had some sort of effect and aim. There was no way the famous \u2018genius among geniuses\u2019 would make him practice so much for no reason.\u2018Hm, my body feels heavy. Must be because I spent the entire night asking myself that question. Let\u2019s cool my head down during morning training and stop worrying for a while.\u2019Did Eldest Sister Luna also do the same training as what she was ordering Jin to do when she was 14 years old? As he proceeded to Garon\u2019s training ground, Jin thought about his 1st sister\u2019s past.As they were 19 years apart, he hadn\u2019t seen her growth and development. But he had heard that during her puberty, she was quite the problem child.\u2018Either way, Eldest Sister must be making me do this training because she believes I can figure out the meaning and goal behind it.\u20197 AM.The guardian cadets were gathering at the training ground. They would be sparring today, so there was a bizarre mood between everyone.The results of the spars were quite important to their overall scores and assessments.And having higher scores would grant them greater salaries and the possibility of becoming a guardian knight with special treatment. It was to no surprise the cadets were all on edge.\u2018What a heavy and competitive atmosphere. Their gazes show that they wouldn\u2019t hesitate to beat any opponent half dead. As for Bellop\u2026\u00a0Sigh.\u2019Jin turned his attention to the corner, where Bellop was crouching down.As one would expect, the cowardly boy was looking at his surroundings with nervous eyes. He reminded Jin of a small prey having barely escaped its predator and hiding in a small hole.\u2018What on earth is wrong with him? Actually, how on earth did he pass the exam to become a guardian cadet?\u2019After passing the exam, Bellop must\u2019ve probably been called a \u2018genius\u2019 by many outside the Garden of Swords. So Jin couldn\u2019t understand the reason behind his shyness.\u2018Hm\u2026 It might be that he once believed he was a genius, but found out that there were far better and stronger geniuses than him here, which made him lose confidence. Or was he just born this way\u2026?\u2019As his thoughts reached that point, Jin shook his head.\u2018I\u2019m already busy enough thinking about the meaning behind Eldest Sister\u2019s training. I don\u2019t have the time and energy to figure out what his deal is. I just need to make it so that he doesn\u2019t get kicked out, which should be more than enough!\u2019Garon arrived at the training ground, and the cadets immediately stood in line. After a simple warm-up and physical exercise, Garon announced the order of the spars and the schedule.\u201cThere will be three rounds of spars! You will be changing opponents each time. And the ten most notable winners will be able to challenge Young Master Jin one at a time.\u201d\u201cYes, Instructor!\u201dThere was not a single cadet in Garon\u2019s class who could defeat Jin. Therefore, whenever there was a sparring session, Jin would be fighting several duels more than the others.\u201cGaron, when will I be able to move up to the intermediate training class?\u201dStarting from the intermediate training class, the instructor was a veteran knight of the clan instead of a guest instructor like Garon. Moreover, during the lessons, the students were allowed to use aura and real swords, which was still prohibited in the beginner class.Jin now wanted to move up to the next stage.\u201cMadame Rosa stated that if Young Master Jin wins against ten opponents today, you will be allowed to join the intermediate class at the start of next year.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201dWhile the story so far had belittled them, they were still guardian cadets of the Runcandel Clan.They were the top ten cadets who won their other spars to boot. Facing all ten of them consecutively wouldn\u2019t be so easy for Jin.Runcandel cadets were on a whole other level compared to the cadets of other nations\u2019 swordsmanship academies and mercenary trainees.\u201cEdington, Mark! You\u2019re up first. Get ready!\u201dTwo boys with resolute expressions faced each other in the center of the training ground. Once Garon\u2019s signal arrived, the spar began. Jin observed their movements without much concern.\u2018Everyone\u2019s doing pretty well.\u2019Their movements were flexible and agile, yet powerful. Despite looking nervous, they were calmly calculating their actions and scanning their opponents. They weren\u2019t Runcandel cadets for nothing.Swoosh, swoosh!Although they were wielding wooden swords, each swing was slicing the wind. Even with the lack of sharp edges, a clean blow would completely smash an ordinary human\u2019s head.\u201cUrgh!\u201dCrack!The boy called Edington\u2019s wooden sword landed on his opponent\u2019s flank. As the sound of a rib breaking resounded, Mark crouched on the spot and trembled in pain.The Runcandel\u2019s medical team\u2014which was waiting on one side of the training ground\u2014laid the injured boy on a stretcher.\u201cWinner, Edington. Take a break over there and stay on standby. Next up are Phils and Sierra\u2026\u201dAnd so, nine matches followed. The tenth was between Bellop and a girl called Mesa Milkano.Jin paid close attention to Bellop\u2019s spar.\u2018Bellop seems to be focused on defense as usual.\u2019On the other side, Mesa was ruthlessly attacking him. As one of the top cadets of the beginner training class, her strength was evident.But Jin was used to this sight. It wasn\u2019t his first time watching one of Bellop\u2019s spars.\u201cFight me, Bellop Schmitz! Stop running and fight me like a man!\u201dMesa was hurling provocations while wildly swinging her wooden sword.Suddenly, Jin noticed that Bellop\u2019s movements were \u2018better than expected\u2019\u2026 He then realized that it was the result of the development of his \u2018eyes\u2019.\u2018Bellop, that prick. He\u2019s not just getting pushed back. He\u2019s going easy on her!\u2019Jin instinctively got up.It looked like Bellop was barely blocking Mesa\u2019s attacks at the last moment, but Jin could see that Bellop\u2019s movements were somewhat easygoing.\u2018During this exchange\u2014where their swords clashed twenty times\u2014Bellop had the chance to counterattack three times. They weren\u2019t by chance either. Bellop guided her movements to create those opportunities himself. So why?\u2019Why won\u2019t he fight back?While Jin was racking his brain, the other cadets were just waiting for Mesa to deal the finishing blow.They didn\u2019t think there was anything to learn from such a one-sided battle, especially since it was Bellop on the receiving side.\u2018\u2026Could it be\u2026?\u2019Jin carefully observed Bellop again. He scanned how Bellop avoided and parried the attacks, along with his expression.Overall, he wasn\u2019t looking good. His nervous eyes were showing pain and his clenched jaw showed how he wanted to get out of this situation as soon as possible.However, his movements were far better than Mesa\u2019s. While it appeared as if he was getting pushed back, his actions were carefree at times. As long as he wished for it, he could turn the tables on her at any time.Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t counterattack, a discrepancy which confused Jin.Other than the Runcandel boy, the others were completely oblivious to Bellop\u2019s actions.Soon, Jin figured out the origin of this discrepancy.\u2018He\u2019s not scared of getting hit or feeling pain.\u2019There was no reason for a human to feel fear due to another being that was obviously \u2018weaker\u2019 than them. And from Jin\u2019s perspective, Bellop was stronger than Mesa.\u2018He\u2019s worried about hurting his opponent. That\u2019s why he\u2019s being so passive in this fight.\u2019Other than that, there was no other way of explaining this odd spar.\u2018Knowing his personality, he\u2019s not being overconfident in his skills and going easy on her on purpose. He just doesn\u2019t know what to do, and can only defend without attacking, which ended up looking like he\u2019s going easy on her.\u2019As Jin\u2019s thoughts came to a conclusion, Bellop\u2019s wooden sword was stabbed in the ground. Mesa immediately flew forward and slammed him in the chin with her knee.\u201cStop. Winner, Mesa. Wait over there.\u201d\u201cYes, Instructor.\u201dThese spars continued for another two hours, and it was finally Jin\u2019s turn. Amongst the 24 winners, Garon selected the top 10.\u201cPlease get ready, Young Master.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAs Jin stood at the center of the training ground, the eyes of the cadets shone. He was the youngest child of the Runcandels they would have to serve, and an extremely skilled monster.According to the cadets, being able to witness Jin\u2019s skills was the highlight of the sparring sessions.\u201cEdington, Sierra, David, Mesa\u2026 You will be facing Young Master Jin in that order.\u201dJin grabbed his wooden sword and faced his first opponent.\u2018Hm, so I need to defeat ten cadets.\u2019His highest score so far was eight.By increasing that number by two, he would be allowed to attend the intermediate classes his siblings were taking by next year.If this were a real battle to the death instead of a spar, he could easily take down twenty of them without question\u2026 But during a spar, he couldn\u2019t use spiritual power and magic.He could only use pure swordsmanship in order to win. Moreover, he couldn\u2019t kill his opponents.\u2018Even the Tona morons entered the intermediate class last year.\u2019It goes without saying that the twins entered the intermediate class faster than Jin not because they were more skilled than him.While they could overpower Jin when he first arrived at the Garden of Swords, their younger brother could easily turn them into rags during spars one year later. However, they went out with their other siblings on \u2018commissions\u2019 and made achievements, which allowed them to advance to the intermediate class.Furthermore, Jin believed that there were still a few more things he could learn from the beginner class until recently. And having seen through Bellop\u2019s movements today, Jin realized that he had made the correct decision to stay behind a little longer.\u201cIf you shall allow me, Young Master Jin.\u201d\u201cYes, Edington. I\u2019ll be in your care.\u201dSwoosh!Edington darted towards Jin and wielded his wooden sword. A surprise attack. He had calculated that if he didn\u2019t seize control of the duel from the start, he would never win against Jin.However, that was a bad move.As he watched the wooden sword fly towards his chest, Jin pushed himself forward instead of dodging. But at the last moment, he sidestepped, trampled on Edington\u2019s foot, and swung his sword towards his opponent\u2019s neck.Be that as it may, Edington hadn\u2019t become a Runcandel guardian cadet through pure luck. He twisted his body out of reflex and avoided Jin\u2019s attack.\u201cUrgh!\u201dBut it wasn\u2019t a perfect evasion. Jin\u2019s sword hit Edington\u2019s ear instead of his neck before slashing the air behind.\u2018I missed, but it wasn\u2019t bad.\u2019After having put some distance between them, Edington gripped his sword tightly. But because of the injury, his eardrums were ringing and his sense of balance took a turn for the worse for a short while.If Jin were facing only a single opponent, he could\u2019ve waited to let Edington recover.But he had another nine spars to fight. Jin suddenly appeared before Edington and ended the first duel.Since he had lost his sense of balance, Jin could easily defeat Edington without hurting him too badly.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s my loss, Young Master.\u201d\u201cGood game, Edington Wez. Go have the medical team check your ear.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you very much.\u201d\u201cNext up, Sierra! Begin the spar immediately.\u201dWith Garon\u2019s shout, the second duel was initiated.\u201cI\u2019ll be in your care, Young Master Jin.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLikewise, Sierra Camaro.\u201dThe second fight didn\u2019t end as quickly as it did with Edington. The ten winners Garon had chosen were ordered from the weakest to the strongest.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20 \u2013 What Even is the Eye of the Mind? (3)Sierra Camaro lasted about one minute longer than Edington, but still didn\u2019t manage to injure or wear out Jin.After her was David McChi, but Jin\u2019s spar against him ended in a similar way as his two previous ones. However, David was somewhat more tenacious than Sierra and Jin had to exert more strength than before, due to which his opponent ended up with a broken rib.A simple fracture can easily be dealt with by the Runcandel medical team. As long as the injuries aren\u2019t fatal\u2014such as amputated limbs or damaged vital organs\u2014the medical team can fully heal the victim in an instant.\u201cUrgh, that was enlightening, Young Master. Thank you for your guidance!\u00a0Urgh!\u201dJin flinched when he saw David lose consciousness and fall over, all the while keeping a smile on his face and a thumbs up.Just\u2026 how many more of these muscle-brained lunatics are there in this crazy clan?? Even if Jin was David\u2019s superior, no sane person would smile and show gratitude to the man who just destroyed one of their ribs.Moreover, it wasn\u2019t a forced statement. David was truly grateful from the bottom of his heart. Jin hid his discomfort and lightly nodded back.\u2018Well, come to think of it, I used to behave the same way while learning and training magic under my master before my regression. I shouldn\u2019t be judging David right now.\u2019Jin\u2019s master\u2014who was two years younger than him\u2014wasn\u2019t your ordinary teacher.They once scorched Jin with lightning for hours on end to \u2018teach him lightning magic\u2019, and also sent him flying in the air for an entire day to \u2018teach him wind magic\u2019. And they were laughing the entire time.Each time something like this happened during his training, Jin would be thanking his master with a smile on his face like the current David. The desire to \u2018become stronger\u2019 can sometimes turn humans into muscle-brained maniacs.\u2018I really wasn\u2019t thinking straight back then, was I?\u2019Swoosh, swoosh.Jin lightly swung his wooden sword around, waiting for his next opponent.\u201cI am Mesa Milkano, Young Master.\u201d\u201cI am aware of your name. You\u2019re the second daughter of the Milkano family.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have you remember me. I won\u2019t be as easy to deal with as the other cadets you faced before me. Today, I will definitely defeat you, Young Master.\u201d\u201cI look forward to it.\u201dMesa positioned herself and prepared for battle. She then calmly began circling Jin without showing any openings. No wonder she was the strongest of Garon\u2019s beginner class cadets.She wasn\u2019t behaving the same way as when she was mercilessly attacking Bellop.Mesa was looking down on Bellop and attacking without considering the consequences. However, Jin was a completely different opponent compared to Bellop, so she completely changed her attitude and approach to the duel.\u2018Mesa Milkano. I remember that in my first life, she passed all the exams and qualifications required to graduate as a cadet, and was quickly deployed to the main house as a guardian knight. I never interacted with her personally, though, so I don\u2019t quite remember the details of her life.\u2019She was the perfect example of an elite.Even though she hadn\u2019t seen through Bellop\u2019s true strength, Mesa was still an extremely gifted fighter.Jin had sparred against Mesa a total of seven times until now. He had lost the first two times, and won the remaining five. And each time, the difference in their skills and strength was getting wider and wider.And through his duels against talented individuals like Mesa, Jin realized how impressive his gift with the sword was\u2014a gift he never got to use and experience to the full extent in his first life due to the Bladed Illusion curse.\u2018I still need to face six more opponents after Mesa. But holding back my strength and energy while facing Mesa is a bad idea. I need to defeat her in a direct confrontation in order to plant fear in my next opponents\u2019 heads.\u2019His spars against Edington, Sierra and David were merely appetizers.The duels against the real elites of the beginner training class started with Mesa. And for the 14-year-old Jin, defeating them all head-on in succession would be demanding and strenuous.Therefore, Jin was planning on planting a \u2018misconception\u2019 in the other cadets\u2019 minds during his duel against Mesa: that they would never be able to win against Jin in a head-on battle.\u2018Having a frontal clash, while still looking relaxed and calm the entire time. Those are the two key points I need to keep in mind during this spar.\u2019This time, Jin was the first to make a move.His attacks consisted of the most basic of stabs and slashes. Not a single irregular or odd movement was added. Mesa easily parried and avoided his attacks, but as the offensive continued, her thoughts got complicated and heavy.\u2018Why is the young master only using such basic attacks?\u2019While they were your standard attacks, each move was heavy and sharp. Mesa\u2019s hands and wrists were going numb from parrying all of them.However, that wasn\u2019t the reason why her mind was boggled.\u2018When will he start going all out?\u2019\u2018He had the opportunity to send my sword flying just now, but he didn\u2019t.\u2019\u2018He\u2019s definitely doing this on purpose. But why\u2026\u2019While Mesa racked her brain, Jin continued swinging his wooden sword with a composed expression. Even when Mesa twisted her body in order to escape his sequence of basic attacks, he still adhered to the fundamentals.\u2018Is he looking down on me?\u2019Ugh!Mesa ground her teeth and stomped on the ground in order to stabilize her stance.\u201cFine, allow me to entertain you, Young Master!\u201dOnce Mesa fixed her posture and gripped her wooden sword tightly, her worries vanished. She also began using only the most basic of attacks in order to face Jin.Soon, all the fancy techniques and complex movements completely disappeared from their duel. They were each taking turns attacking and defending. It had become an extremely simple fight.A simple battle of brute strength.Mesa was quite confident and proud of her physical strength. She wasn\u2019t being conceited, as she had learned the basics of aura manipulation back at the Milkano castle before coming to the Runcandel Clan.Bang, skrrrt! Boom!Explosive sounds echoed throughout the training ground as the two fighters\u2019 wooden swords hit each other. This battle of brute strength had already lasted for over five minutes. The other cadets could only watch the duel with wide eyes.Huff, huff.Someone was now out of breath. It was the sound of Mesa panting.\u2018I\u2019m\u2026 being pushed back in terms of physical strength?\u2019Even Mesa knew that she couldn\u2019t win against Jin in this spar.But she believed that her physical strength surpassed his, if not equal. Mesa couldn\u2019t accept that she would get pushed back by someone younger than her.She was still not aware of the gap between ordinary people and people of Runcandel descent\u2014who own blessed bodies.\u201cHaaah!\u201dMesa suddenly shouted loudly as she swung down her wooden sword. She was attempting to regain full control of her emotions, but it ended up being the cause of her defeat.Jin didn\u2019t avoid the strike containing the entirety of Mesa\u2019s strength, and received it head-on.Mesa had expected him to step back in order to dodge her attack, so she was planning on swiftly dashing forward to deal the final blow after her swing.But even if Jin received her frontal attack head-on, Mesa had a backup plan. She would let go of her sword at the last moment, grab his sword arm, swing her legs upwards and catch his neck and shoulders in a front triangle choke.In other words, this was Mesa\u2019s trump card. Even Garon judged that her plan was reasonable.However, the situation didn\u2019t develop the way Mesa had been expecting.Crack!\u201cEh\u2026\u2026?!\u201dThe wooden sword she was swinging downwards with all her strength shattered as Jin\u2019s sword hit it in an upwards swing.\u2018How come? It\u2019s not like Young Master Jin used aura just now\u2026\u2019As Mesa asked herself the question subconsciously, Jin\u2019s wooden sword had already reached her neck, waiting a few millimeters away from her skin.Pheww.Jin exhaled deeply and fixed his breath.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s my loss, Young Master.\u201d\u201cThat was a great duel, Mesa Milkano.\u201dWhile he replied calmly, Jin\u2019s forehead was drenched in sweat.Mesa then shifted her gaze down to her broken sword. This was neither a trick nor an illusion. Jin hadn\u2019t used aura either. So why was her wooden sword the only one that broke?\u2018Dammit!\u2019As she watched Jin head to one side of the training ground to get a new wooden sword, Mesa finally realized the reason behind this phenomenon.\u201cI can\u2019t use this one anymore.\u201dEvery onlooker believed that the duel between Jin and Mesa was one of brute strength with no intricacy or elaborate techniques.However, there was one hidden truth within the battle.While Jin and Mesa were exchanging blows one after another, the boy had aimed for the center of Mesa\u2019s blade each time.On the other hand, Mesa\u2019s attacks had affected the entire surface of Jin\u2019s wooden blade.Jin\u2019s resolve to break Mesa\u2019s sword, versus Mesa\u2019s resolve to face him in a head-on battle. Mesa\u2019s wooden sword breaking was by no means a coincidence.She had believed that this was a battle of \u2018brute strength\u2019, but in reality, it was a battle of \u2018accuracy\u2019.There wasn\u2019t a big difference in their strength and stamina. However, the cause of her loss was the difference in their accuracy and persistence.\u2018Is this even humanly possible?\u2019Mesa asked herself as she bit her lower lip.A few seconds later, she came to the conclusion that it was indeed possible to achieve such a feat. As long as one was more skilled than their opponent and predicted the development of the battle, it would be easy to achieve.However, she had never thought it would be possible to pull it off right here, right now. Despite being in the renowned Runcandel Clan\u2019s training class, it was still the \u2018beginner\u2019 training class. No one was supposed to be skilled enough to pull this off.\u2018So, is this what it means to be a Runcandel? I\u2019ll have to devote myself to my training, and next time, I\u2019ll definitely\u2026!\u2019Mesa returned to her seat.Even if one was expecting to lose, actually experiencing the defeat always left a bitter taste in the mouth. Mesa\u2019s heart was filled with pain from the defeat, but also gratitude for having learned an important lesson from Jin.Following his duel with Mesa, Jin faced the remaining six cadets. However, he was able to win without much difficulty. No one else faced him head-on like Mesa. Therefore, none of them could steal control over the flow of the battle from Jin.When the final opponent fell before Jin, the other cadets all gulped audibly.In their eyes, Jin had easily defeated all the challengers after Mesa.However, it wasn\u2019t as easy as it appeared to be.Having faced ten extremely talented cadets one after another, Jin was somewhat out of breath after his final battle.\u2018Great, I still have some energy left.\u2019Jin hadn\u2019t made an example out of Mesa just to save his energy as much as possible because he feared he couldn\u2019t defeat all ten cadets.Even if he hadn\u2019t planted a misconception in the other challengers\u2019 minds by breaking Mesa\u2019s sword, he could\u2019ve still defeated them all.\u201cExcellent work, Young Master. With this, you shall be permitted to attend the intermediate training class starting next year. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cHuff, huff\u2026\u00a0Thanks, Garon. I\u2019ll be in your care until next year.\u201d\u201cShould we end the morning training session now? It\u2019s almost time for lunch.\u201d\u201cHow long until lunchtime?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s about ten minutes left. Is something the matter?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s one more person I want to face.\u201dGaron froze at Jin\u2019s words, and stared at the boy\u2019s eyes.\u201cWho do you have in mind?\u201dJin slowly turned his gaze to the cadets.In one corner of the group was a boy sitting with a blank expression, scratching his head.\u201cBellop. Bellop Schmitz.\u201dAll the cadets\u2019 gazes turned to Bellop in an instant.Garon\u2019s eyes opened wide as the name escaped Jin\u2019s mouth.\u2018\u2026Has the young master seen through Bellop\u2019s hidden talent?\u2019The person in question was looking around, dumbfounded. He and the other cadets had no idea why Jin had chosen him.\u201cGet up. Come on over and fight me.\u201dJin lightly threw a wooden sword towards the startled boy.\u201cY-Young Master? I\u2026 Um, I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\u201cBellop Schmitz!\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euJin suddenly yelled his name, to which Bellop instinctively stood up.\u201cYou cannot survive within this clan if you continue acting like that. Get over here. I\u2019ll knock your sleepy head awake.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 \u2013 What Even is the Eye of the Mind? (4)Bellop stood before Jin, squeezing his wooden sword\u2019s handle as cold sweat ran down his face. His eyes kept darting around as he wiped his forehead with his sleeve.He hadn\u2019t received so much attention ever since becoming a guardian cadet, which explained his restlessness.The other spectating cadets could see Bellop\u2019s soul escaping through his mouth already as the staredown with Jin continued.Everyone couldn\u2019t help but think back on the words the Runcandel boy had told the coward.You cannot survive within this clan if you continue acting like that.\u2018Why did the Young Master tell me such things\u2026?\u2019Is it because I\u2019m too weak? Or because I\u2019m too timid? Such questions went through Bellop\u2019s mind.\u2018Is Young Master Jin trying to humiliate Bellop since he gets on the Young Master\u2019s nerves?\u2019\u2018Is he warning Bellop that he won\u2019t survive in the Runcandel Clan because he\u2019s such a weakling?\u2019\u2018Young Master Jin is crueler than I thought\u2026\u2019The cadets were all in agreement.Nevertheless, Jin\u2019s eyes were fixated on Bellop, and he tightened his grip on the sword.\u201cBellop.\u201d\u201cOh! Y-Yes, Young Master.\u201dSnicker, snicker.Some suppressed scornful laughs echoed amongst the spectators. But the cadets who reacted immediately corrected their expressions and attitude, as they feared Garon would chastise them.However, nevermind Garon, even Jin didn\u2019t give them a glance and kept his eyes on Bellop.\u201cI\u2019ve already lost a lot of stamina from sparring against ten cadets.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dHaving barely come to his senses, Bellop answered respectfully.\u201cAnd you are still unscathed.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIn spite of that,\u201dJin began walking towards Bellop before continuing his sentence.\u201cI am probably stronger than you right now. Excluding Garon, I would most likely win against anyone here in one last duel.\u201dBellop didn\u2019t know how to reply to that, so he simply nodded quietly.\u201cThat is the reason why I want to fight you right now.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, I still do not understand what you\u2026\u00a0Urgh!\u201dThud!Jin instantly reduced the distance between the two. His wooden sword flew towards Bellop\u2019s shoulder, but the latter somehow managed to avoid the blow at the last second, despite his panicked footwork.Following that, the attacks continued nonstop, like an endlessly flowing river. Bellop parried and avoided the sword while retreating.\u201cGood moves.\u201d\u201cThank you very mu\u2014\u00a0Urgh!\u201dShwoop!Jin suddenly grabbed a handful of sand on the training ground and scattered it in Bellop\u2019s face. As Bellop tried to resist the urge to close and rub his eyes, he tightened his hold on his wooden sword and stood strong.\u201cY-Young Master\u2026?!\u201dBut Jin didn\u2019t answer and darted towards Bellop again, grabbed his shirt, and slammed his shin into his opponent\u2019s thigh. As the impact resounded, Bellop let out a deep groan and collapsed to the ground.\u201cI didn\u2019t call you here to have a spar. As I said, I want to \u2018fight\u2019 you.\u201dJin approached the seated Bellop, who could barely open his irritated eyes and look up to the Runcandel boy.\u201cI also said that I would \u2018most likely\u2019 win. That I would \u2018most likely win against anyone here in one last duel\u2019. That means that I\u2019m not 100% certain about it. Wipe your face.\u201dBellop used his shirt to wipe off the sand on his face and eyes.\u201c\u2026Does that mean that the opponent you\u2019re not certain of winning against is me, Young Master?\u201d\u201cFinally, we\u2019re on the same page. This isn\u2019t a spar, this is a real fight. So it\u2019s time you wipe off that incredulous expression and face me seriously. I could have killed you countless times while you were on the ground.\u201d\u201cYoung Master.\u201d\u201cBut the only reason I didn\u2019t deal the final blow yet is because I\u2019m showing mercy, for you are incapable of comprehending my intentions. Stand up. I won\u2019t go easy on you again.\u201dHis tone was far too dreary for this to be considered a prank of bad taste.Jin turned around and began to widen the space between them once again. Bellop lowered his face and let out a deep sigh, before lifting himself up and wielding his wooden sword.The cadets who were spectating so far began to wonder whether Jin was actually deranged.No matter how foolish and cowardly Bellop was, the Young Master was going too far\u2026 or so thought some of the observers.Some even expected Garon to intervene and stop the bloodbath that was about to begin.Nevertheless, the instructor only stood on the side, carefully watching the scene before his eyes.Seeing his lack of mediation, frustration grew in the cadets\u2019 hearts as they became disheartened. Simultaneously, anger sparked in their eyes. The 7-star knight\u2014who also happened to be a swordsmanship instructor of the clan\u2014couldn\u2019t stop Jin Runcandel.So what on earth could the lowly cadets even do on their own? Nothing at all.Yet, they couldn\u2019t stop anger from forming. Anger and dissatisfaction that the training class\u2019s strongest\u2014Jin Runcandel\u2014could allow himself to bully the weakest of the class, Bellop.Where had the dignity and honor of the Runcandels gone?! Was the act of throwing sand at a cadet far weaker than oneself also part of the Runcandels\u2019 glory?!All the spectators\u2019 faces twisted in fury and despair as they watched the two extremes face each other.However, the next moment, all their expressions collapsed into shock and astonishment.Beam!Bellop\u2019s wooden sword was shining with aura. It was pale and dim, but true aura nonetheless. Even with that little amount of aura, a swordsman\u2019s slashing power would increase exponentially and become fatal.\u201cA-Aura\u2026?!\u201dThe weakest of the class, the eternal loser. That boy was suddenly wielding aura, so the cadets were shocked and confused.At this rate, one of the two fighters could potentially perish during this duel.\u201cInstructor! We must stop them! This is a training class, not a battlefield!\u201d\u201cInstructor Gar\u2026\u201d\u201cSwordsmanship Instructor, Garon Altemiro!\u201dJin turned to Garon and yelled at the top of his lungs.\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d\u201cYou must keep what you see today a secret and take it to your grave. You cannot inform any other Runcandel of this incident.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dIn the meantime, Bellop put out the aura covering his wooden sword.However, his face wasn\u2019t dyed in fear anymore. He seemed dispirited yet furious.\u201cIs this what you truly wish to happen, Young Master?\u201d\u201cSo you are able to use aura. In that case, you shouldn\u2019t hold back and make the most of it.\u201dJin versus Bellop.The two of them had a short staredown. The cadets who were complaining all shut their mouths and watched the inevitable clash as cold sweat ran down their cheeks.Bellop was the first to make a move. He instantly zoomed across the field and appeared before Jin with surprisingly agile movements.Crash!Jin blocked Bellop\u2019s heavy wooden blow.As their swords got tangled, the battle came to a standstill as it became one of strength. The veins on their arms bulged as their muscles contracted, and the wooden swords trembled under the equal pushing forces.\u201cIf you wanted to duel me, you\u2019ve made a grave mistake, Young Master.\u201dScrrrrrt!Jin\u2019s wooden sword began slipping and cracking as Bellop coated his sword in aura once again.\u201cYou should\u2019ve challenged me\u2026 before dueling the others!\u201dSnap!Jin\u2019s sword broke under the pressure. Immediately, time slowed down for Bellop and the other cadets during the short instant when Bellop\u2019s shining wooden sword dug into Jin\u2019s shoulder.The wooden sword had completely cut through the shoulder and was about to reach Jin\u2019s heart. As he saw the blade dig deeper and deeper, Jin caught sight of Bellop\u2019s expression twisting into despair.Despair for having gotten on the wrong side of the youngest Runcandel.In addition, despair for cutting down Young Master Jin who had taken good care of him for so long. Bellop\u2019s innocent eyes were filled with such hopeless thoughts.\u201cAs if I\u2019d let you!\u201dBang!A sudden heavy blow hit the side of Bellop\u2019s sword. The Runcandel Hand-to-Hand Combat Technique, Deflect Strike. It was Jin\u2019s strong palm.As the sword flew away, the recoil shook Bellop\u2019s body. Having lost his balance and footing, Jin swiftly grabbed him from behind and choked him.\u201cKeuk!\u201dThe other cadets didn\u2019t realize what had happened in that short moment, omitting a few top-class cadets like Mesa Milkano.\u2018The fuck?! Are you for real? He\u2019s nuts!\u2019Mesa couldn\u2019t believe what she saw. Although her spar with Jin had astonished her earlier, it couldn\u2019t compare to the shock she received from seeing Jin\u2019s current superhuman movements.\u201cUrgh!\u201dBellop couldn\u2019t do anything but struggle for air as he got choked from behind. As the other cadets stood up to stop him, Jin released his arms on his own.As he coughed and gasped for air, Bellop turned around to face Jin with a displeased look.\u201cWhy did you stop? You said you wouldn\u2019t go easy again. Don\u2019t stop, Young Master! You won this fight, have you not?! Are you satisfied now? Is it fun messing around with others, huh?!\u201dBellop\u2019s pent-up anger all burst out.Jin shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s not fun, then why\u2026!\u201d\u201cHaving to push you beyond your limits is also unbearable for me. Unbearable and agonizing.\u201d\u201cWhat do you even know about me! Why do you torment me like so?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know much about you. But there\u2019s one thing I know. Being considerate\u2026 is something you can only afford once you\u2019ve become an extremely powerful figure.\u201dBellop froze. He then recalled the words Jin had told him before the start of the fight.You cannot survive within this clan if you continue acting like that.\u201cYou\u2019ve probably realized just now, but you\u2019re weaker than me. You\u2019re also kinder than me. I like that aspect of you. But you cannot survive in this hellhole by being a bootlicker.\u201dAs Jin spoke, the other cadets couldn\u2019t even utter a sound.In consequence, Bellop\u2019s weeping and tearful sobs echoed around.\u201cBellop. Bellop Schmitz. Look at me. Lift your head and look into my eyes.\u201dHe raised his head and their eyes met.\u201cI truly wish from the bottom of my heart that\u2026\u201dJin paused and placed his hand on the boy\u2019s shoulder.\u201cYou gain enough power and strength to protect that good-natured and kind heart of yours, along with the others here. Lastly, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dBellop nodded at his words. Actually, it looked more like he was shaking his head. No, nevermind. It was a mix of both movements.Thus, Jin couldn\u2019t figure out whether it was an affirmation or a denial. The boy with tears running down his face walked towards the other cadets.Suddenly, the servants carrying large pots of crude dishes appeared at the training ground.\u201cEh\u2026? The atmosphere seems a bit\u2026 Should we come back later, Instructor Garon? Young Master Jin?\u201dAs the servants hesitated on what to do, Bellop spoke up.\u201cPlease go get your serving on your own today, Young Master.\u201dJin chuckled awkwardly.\u201cAlright. In fact, I\u2019ll bring your portion too today.\u201dAs lunchtime came to an end, Garon quietly approached Jin before the afternoon training session began.\u201cSo, you\u2019ve awakened Bellop Schmitz. The boy has outstanding talents, but his heart and mind were a bit weak, so I wasn\u2019t sure what to do\u2026 I am grateful to you, Young Master. It must\u2019ve been a great stimulus for him.\u201d\u201cGaron.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t run your mouth thoughtlessly. Awakened him? His heart and mind? No matter what my intentions were, it must\u2019ve been a traumatic experience for Bellop.\u201d\u201cYour actions and behaviour today were befitting of a Runcandel. Please do not worry too much about that. He is but a guardian cadet. He is not worthy of your pity, his soon-to-be master.\u201dJin stared at Garon, before letting out a small sneer.\u201cSwordsmanship Instructor of the Guardian Cadets, Garon Altemiro. The only field you are allowed to judge and evaluate me in is swordsmanship. Do not overstep your boundaries and keep those impertinent opinions to yourself.\u201dGaron felt his stomach drop as Jin stated his point.\u2018The Black King Mercenaries I met before once described him as a young overlord\u2026 and sure enough, he\u2019s one terrifying predator.\u2019Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euGaron smirked and immediately lowered his head.\u201cMy sincere apologies, Young Master. As you have ordered, I shall take today\u2019s events to the grave.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 \u2013 What Even is the Eye of the Mind? (5)The unique Genesis Knight in the world, Cyron Runcandel.After he welcomed his youngest son at the Garden of Swords four years ago, he immediately left for the Black Sea again. The question the boy had asked before was still weighing on his mind.Is God Solderet stronger than father?\u2018I can be stronger than a god.\u2019The monsters at the Black Sea didn\u2019t attack Cyron. They didn\u2019t even approach the center of the Black Sea where Cyron was currently sitting. It was their method of conserving the natural ecosystem.To eat and be eaten.Cyron quite liked the simplicity of this system, which was why he came to the Black Sea so often.A few days ago, a knight came looking for him at the Black Sea. The knight in question had fought and killed countless monsters and bathed in their blood in order to see Cyron.\u201cThis is Khan, Patriarch.\u201dCyron didn\u2019t turn around to face him and simply opened his eyes. He was sitting cross-legged, but his body was levitating above the ground by a hand span.\u201cSpeak freely, Khan.\u201dKhan approached him while wiping off the blood on his armor.He then gave his report with a stiff face, and Cyron waited for Khan to finish speaking with a composed look.However, halfway through the report, the corners of Cyron\u2019s lips rose to form a grin.\u201c\u2026That is all.\u201dThe floating body slowly began its descent onto the ground.\u201cSo, that\u2019s what\u2026 the youngest did?\u201d\u201cIndeed, Patriarch.\u201dThe content of Khan\u2019s report was the details of the uproar at the beginner training class caused by Jin\u2019s recent actions.Although Garon had said that he wouldn\u2019t disclose the details of the incident to other Runcandels, he couldn\u2019t keep it a secret from the Runcandel patriarch. Therefore, he informed Khan\u2014Cyron\u2019s right-hand man\u2014about the incident.He didn\u2019t tell other individuals, however. Garon wasn\u2019t afraid of the current Jin, but he did fear the future Jin.\u201cKuhaha.\u201dCyron suddenly threw his head back and laughed out loud.\u201cSo those are the principles the youngest believes in. He\u2019ll use overwhelming force to dominate others, while also embracing and caring for the weaker humans at times.\u201dKhan didn\u2019t answer and simply lowered his head.Smirk.A wide grin formed on Cyron\u2019s face. In recent years, he was laughing so much, far more than he had ever laughed after reaching the demigod realm.\u201cThen we\u2019ll need to check whether those principles of his hold any value or worth.\u201d\u201cYes, Patriarch.\u201d\u201cReturn and tell this to Garon. Before he moves up to the intermediate training class, have the youngest do a\u2026\u201dIn consequence, Khan had to spend another several days getting out of the Black Sea and fighting monsters in order to relay the command to Garon.January 1795.Jin\u2014now 15 years old\u2014was acknowledged as a 3-star knight and was enjoying the final break of the beginner training class.Every year, cadets receive a two-week vacation during the first month. It was their one and only break, as the cadets trained every single day the rest of the year.It was more or less a vacation.Most cadets return to their hometowns during this period. Competent cadets train on their own and inspect their equipment, whereas outstanding cadets roam around the Huphester Alliance\u2019s smithies and order custom-made swords.Why do they order swords, you ask?The reason is that they\u2019re aware of how they\u2019re the most likely candidates to advance to the next class. The results and nominees are announced only after the end of the two-week break, but most of the time, it\u2019s quite easy to predict who will advance to the intermediate class.Starting from the intermediate training class, the cadets no longer use wooden swords. They will have to use personal swords tailor-made for them.The excelling cadets of the beginner class\u2014such as Mesa Milkano\u2014all temporarily left the Garden of Swords in order to acquire their weapons. Even though the results weren\u2019t revealed yet, these cadets all knew they would definitely be chosen.\u201cJin, my brother.\u201d\u201cYes, Eldest Sister.\u201dNeedless to say, the top ranker of the beginner class this year was Jin.If Jin were a cadet like Mesa and the others, he would\u2019ve been roaming around the smithies and forges in Huphester.However, he was a Runcandel.He was the youngest son of the distinguished clan of swordmasters, which had far too many invaluable and top-notch swords. Therefore, he only had to grab a random sword in the clan\u2019s armory.He didn\u2019t need a tailor-made weapon. Amongst the thousands of swords sitting in the armory, a couple of them should fit in his hands perfectly at the very least.\u201cIt was quite troublesome finding a sword that suited you, you know?\u201dHowever, Jin couldn\u2019t choose his sword himself. Luna said that she wanted to gift him his sword and spent an entire month going through the armory.In any case, Luna was far better at spotting good swords compared to the current Jin, so he had nothing to lose by accepting her suggestion.\u201cI look forward to it, Eldest Sister.\u201dBang!Luna removed the enormous axe-sword on her back and laid it on the floor. It was a different sword compared to her beloved \u2018Crantel\u2019.Jin couldn\u2019t help but make a confused face. The axe-sword Luna had laid seemed even bigger than himself.On the other hand, Luna\u2019s eyes were glittering with impatience.\u201cThis sword was once called the \u2018Bayles Slaughterer\u2019. It\u2019s the weapon I enjoyed using back in my teens.\u201dWhat is an axe-sword, you ask?Just as its name implies, it\u2019s a sword with an axe blade attached to the tip. It\u2019s massive, heavy and bulky. The history of axe-swords is\u2026 not very long.It\u2019s a weapon that Luna Runcandel personally invented at the age of fifteen. Until then, no one had used a weapon like this.In other words, the name \u2018Bayles Slaughterer\u2019 originated from Luna\u2019s own\u2026 chaotic, wild, and unstable period of adolescence.\u201cSo? Do you like it?\u201dLuna spoke with innocent eyes full of hopes and expectations. Chills ran up Jin\u2019s spine as he coughed awkwardly.\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t quite think this one is\u2026 suitable.\u201dLuna\u2019s joyful and hopeful mood immediately crashed down on her. She wore a sullen smile as a glum atmosphere formed around her.\u201cHaha, I was just joking. Just joking\u2026\u201d\u2018It didn\u2019t seem like a joke, though\u2026\u2019Jin barely stopped himself from saying that out loud, and just chuckled awkwardly.For a few more seconds, Luna held onto the pipe dream that Jin would take the axe-sword. However she soon gave up and sighed deeply before taking out another sword.\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped\u2026 What about this one, then\u2026?\u201dThe sword Luna showed next was inside a neat, black scabbard without a single ornament or decoration.It appeared ordinary, but when Jin received the sword from Luna, his eyes began to tremble.\u201c\u2026Since you chose Barisada during the Selection Ritual, it\u2019s only fitting that you get this blade. It also suits your swordsmanship style.\u201dShrrrrt.As he grabbed the handle and pulled, a snow-white blade entered his sight.\u2018Bradamante!\u2019Jin admired the pure, undyed sword as he shouted the weapon\u2019s name in his mind. He gazed at the multicoloured reflection that shone like a stellar diamond, as if he had fallen head over heels for it.Bradamante.It is the brother of Barisada, the blade once used by the First Patriarch Temar Runcandel. Excluding Barisada, there were very few swords that outperformed Bradamante in the Runcandel armory.Before forging Barisada, the legendary blacksmith \u2018Picon Minche\u2019 created Bradamante as a prototype, which is now known as one of the finest swords around the world.\u201cYou seem to like it.\u201d\u201cOf course, Eldest Sister. It\u2019s one of the greatest weapons even amongst the swords we have in the clan. Thank you very much.\u201dJin\u2019s tone was composed, but he was so happy he wanted to jump around in joy right now.\u2018If it weren\u2019t for Luna, it would\u2019ve been practically impossible for me to take Bradamante from the armory. The clan wouldn\u2019t have allowed it. Still, to think she\u2019d give me Bradamante\u2026 It\u2019s the sword Murakan told me to obtain in the future!\u2019Since Bradamante was an excellent sword, many of Jin\u2019s siblings were aiming for it.But there was a reason why this sword was special to Jin.Spiritual energy.When Barisada and Bradamante absorb spiritual energy, they reveal their true worth.But this was a feature only accessible by those who control shadows.\u201cEven though many of our siblings yearn for Bradamante\u2026 How can I ever repay you for this, Eldest Sister?\u201d\u201cRepay\u2026 It seems you\u2019re still uncomfortable when around me. How saddening.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, Sister.\u201d\u201cIn order to soothe my sorrow, I\u2019ll have to bully you. Close your eyes right now, Brother. Let\u2019s begin our lesson.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dLuna grinned mischievously as she rubbed Jin\u2019s head and messed up his hair.\u201cToday again, I will be telling you to observe using the eye of the mind.\u201d\u201cI am aware.\u201d\u201cBut unlike before, I will tell you something else you need to know about the eye of the mind.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Sister?\u201dLuna crouched down and held Jin\u2019s hands.\u201cKnow that within our family, where siblings are busy trampling over each other, there is at least one person who loves you unconditionally without expecting something in return. So don\u2019t sadden your sister any more than this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sister.\u201d\u201cBefore you were born, I was spending my days in loneliness inside this family. But one victim is more than enough. There is no need for you to go through that too.\u201dJin decided not to question Luna\u2019s goodwill and love from here on out.It was true that this kind-hearted sister had turned a blind eye to Jin and his misery in his first life. But Jin was willing to turn the page and forget her past disregard towards him.\u2018I don\u2019t even know everything about her from that life. Maybe she was going through difficult times. I shouldn\u2019t judge with incomplete information.\u2019***\u201cIt\u2019s too soon.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYour control over spiritual energy is still imperfect in order to awaken Bradamante. You need to reach at least 3-star spiritual release in order to attempt awakening the sword.\u201d\u201c3-star? I think I\u2019ll reach that soon enough. I should be able to use the sword soon!\u201dThump!Murakan closed the erotic magazine in his hands with force and stared at Jin.\u201cListen carefully, kid. Barisada and Bradamante. Those two spirit swords are dangerous weapons that mustn\u2019t be awakened carelessly. 3-star is the bare minimum requirement. But use Bradamante as an ordinary sword until you reach 5-star, understood?\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t have a lot of patience\u2026 I guess I\u2019ll have to reach 5-star within the next year.\u201d\u201cYeah right. Even if you\u2019re the best spirit controller in his teens and you eat spiritual energy every meal instead of real food, that\u2019s still impossible. Enough with the nonsense. Even a street dog would stop on its path to laugh at you right now.\u201dHow immature. Jin couldn\u2019t believe the individual in front of him was really a dragon who has existed for over 3,000 years.Jin frowned visibly and snatched away the magazine in Murakan\u2019s hands.\u201cWhat was that? Huh? Something about a street dog? Say that again, I didn\u2019t hear you.\u201d\u201cGive my magazine back. Give it back, you brat. Do you know how hard it was to\u2026\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201dThe bickering duo paused and turned to Gilly, who was running towards them. She seemed to be in a hurry.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Gilly?\u201d\u201cInstructor Garon is asking for you, Young Master.\u201d\u201cWhy would Garon want to see me during the break? If he has something to say, tell him to come find me personally.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dAs her eyes shook in worry, Gilly approached Jin and spoke quietly.\u201cHe says he needs to give a rundown of the operation to you using the map, Young Master.\u201d\u201cOperation?\u201d\u201cYes, Instructor Garon has assigned you your first \u2018mission\u2019. And apparently, you\u2019ll need to depart as soon as the break ends.\u201dJin put down the magazine in his hand.\u2018A mission\u2026 True, now that I\u2019m a 3-star knight, it\u2019s about time I was given my first assignment. But leaving as soon as the break ends?\u2019Something was fishy.\u2018Missions\u2019 were given starting from the intermediate training class. As missions usually concerned assassination, combat, monster subjugation, etc., the beginner class wasn\u2019t involved with them.Moreover, the advancement to the intermediate class happened one month after the break for Runcandel cadets, so it was odd to be assigned a mission right after the break.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018Well, I guess I could technically be considered a member of the intermediate class since my advancement was confirmed a few months ago. Maybe they judged that it wouldn\u2019t matter to give me an assignment.\u2019Once Jin sorted out his thoughts and nodded, Gilly gave him additional information.\u201cAnd the participants of this mission are\u2026 ten members of the beginner training class including you, Young Master. Something is amiss. You should quickly go talk to Instructor Garon.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 \u2013 Jin, the Cadets, the Beastman, and\u2026 (1)There were already three cadets inside Garon\u2019s office. They were standing stiffly and nervously from the sudden summons. Garon was explaining the mission while looking at the map on the wall.\u201cDue to the excellent results of this year\u2019s beginner class, this mission was specially assigned to\u2026 Ah, you\u2019ve arrived, Young Master.\u201dWith Jin\u2019s arrival, Garon wore a faint smile and bowed.While the beginner class normally doesn\u2019t receive missions, this case wasn\u2019t the first time it had happened. If the beginner class\u2019s cadets showed outstanding performance and results, they were issued missions on rare occasions.The current batch of beginner class cadets could only show so much growth worthy of being sent on a mission due to Jin\u2019s influence.During Jin and Bellop\u2019s duel last year, the latter wasn\u2019t the only individual to be awakened. While it wasn\u2019t Jin\u2019s intention or plan, the battle from that fateful day had greatly impacted the other spectating cadets.\u201cWe were given a mission, Garon?\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master. This mission involves ten beginner class cadets including you.\u201dJin turned his attention to the world map behind Garon.\u2018The red symbol must be the mission\u2019s destination. That location is\u2026 someplace near the Zhan Kingdom.\u2019The Zhan Kingdom was in proximity to the \u2018Land of the Beastmen\u2019. In fact, it was adjacent to the headquarters of the most dangerous race\u2014the White Wolf Tribe. Travelers avoid that area, adventurers flock to it, and mercenaries detest it.\u201cI\u2019ve also contacted the cadets who have temporarily left the Garden of Swords. There are ten participants including you, Young Master. You will have to carry out the mission in two different groups.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll divide the ten participants of the beginner class into two groups?\u201d\u201cIndeed. You will be the leader of Group 1, Young Master. Group 2 will be led by Scott Limon.\u201dScott Limon. While the results hadn\u2019t been announced yet, everyone predicted that Mesa or Scott would be the runner-up cadet of the beginner class, behind Jin.\u2018Even so, Scott is only at the level of a 2-star knight. If it\u2019s a mission near the Zhan Kingdom, it\u2019s highly probable that it\u2019ll involve beastmen\u2026\u2019Something was off.Even if they were Runcandel cadets, they were merely rookies between the age of 14 to 16. They weren\u2019t the appropriate participants to carry out a mission dealing with beastmen.\u2018Did one of my siblings bribe Garon to assign us on a difficult mission? No\u2026 Seeing Garon\u2019s confident face, I\u2019m pretty sure Father personally instructed him to do so.\u2019But why would Cyron do that? Jin calmly thought to himself.\u2018I highly doubt it\u2019s simply because I\u2019m connected to Solderet or because of my high scores. In that case\u2026 the incident with Bellop was probably relayed to Father. I see. I\u2019m starting to see the full picture now.\u2019Jin calmly nodded.\u201cThen one group must be composed of five members. Who will I be working with?\u201d\u201cYes. Group 1 is composed of Bellop, Phils, Edington, Sierra and you, Young Master. Scott\u2019s group is composed of Mesa, Kiko, Taimont and Zhushen.\u201dHaving heard the formation of the groups, Jin immediately saw through Cyron\u2019s intentions.The four cadets of his group were all middle- to low-ranked within the beginner class, with the exception of Bellop. Having \u2018awakened\u2019 with the duel against Jin, Bellop was now part of the mid-upper ranks.On the other hand, Scott\u2019s team was composed of top-rank cadets. There was only one explanation behind this uneven formation of groups.\u2018Father wants to test me. He wants to check if my principles of leading those weaker than me won\u2019t change during this mission.\u2019In that case, this mission was certain to be troublesome.As Jin\u2019s intuition told him so, he spoke up again.\u201cGive me a rundown of the mission and operation.\u201d\u201cThe mission is to scout the vicinity of the Zhan Kingdom\u2019s southern border. It seems a certain tycoon\u2019s son went missing in that area. The groups will be in charge of separate areas, and as soon as you find the missing person or clues, you must report back to me.\u201dThe cadets in the office all calmed down when they learned that the mission was simply a search-and-report task.\u201cAnd after having reported?\u201d\u201cIf the victim\u2019s survival is confirmed, we will dispatch guardian knights in order to perform a rescue operation. In the meantime, Groups 1 and 2 will return to base. But if the victim is reported dead, the mission will come to an end as long as there aren\u2019t additional requests from the client.\u201d\u201cSounds simple enough.\u201d\u201cYes. However, you must move with prudence as the chances of encountering beastmen are high.\u201d\u201cI assume so. And since the Zhan Kingdom\u2019s southern border is where the White Wolf Tribe is most active, we\u2019ll have to be extra careful.\u201dThe White Wolf Tribe. Just as their name implies, they are a race of beastmen who look like wolves with white fur. They\u2019re famous for being the most talented and skilled amongst beastmen in combat.\u201cYoung Master, if you encounter White Wolf beastmen during the mission, you are to abandon the mission and retreat immediately. That goes for everyone else too.\u201d\u201cI also know that. No matter how outstanding this year\u2019s batch of cadets are, we\u2019re no match to the White Wolf warriors. No need to worry.\u201dGaron smiled at his words.\u201cI am not concerned. I\u2019ve personally witnessed how much this year\u2019s cadets have grown\u2014including you, Young Master. However, one never knows what kinds of unpredictable dangers are lurking around oneself.\u201dJin stared straight back at Garon and also smirked.\u201cYou talk as if a dangerous incident will definitely occur during the mission, Garon.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve caught me. Personally, I can\u2019t wait to witness your marvelous figure as you overcome the situation, Young Master.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a good teacher. Inform me when the cadets who aren\u2019t at the Garden have all returned.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dThree days later, the cadets\u2019 break ended. Without further ado, the beginner class\u2019s mission began.Jin and nine other cadets went to the transfer gate in order to depart to the Zhan Kingdom.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be able to carry out our very first mission with you, Young Master. Group 2 will do our best not to inconvenience you.\u201dScott approached Jin and spoke as they waited for the transfer gate to open.\u201cHaha, are you putting pressure on me, Scott Limon?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely not the case! I am simply showing my gratitude towards the Young Master for giving us the opportunity to carry out our first mission while still in the beginner class.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just kidding.\u201dScott was extremely loyal towards the Runcandels, and his admiration and respect towards Jin were immense as well.However, Scott wasn\u2019t the only one to hold Jin in high esteem.\u201cHey, Group 1. Make sure you don\u2019t get in Young Master Jin\u2019s way, and assist him to the best of your abilities.\u201dAs Mesa sharply declared, the cadets of Group 1 all nodded in sync.\u201cMoreover, if we successfully carry out this mission, you may be given a chance to advance to the intermediate class despite your low scores. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cWe understand, Mesa. We\u2019ll do our best.\u201dJin smiled to himself as he watched their interactions.It may seem like Mesa was being rude to them, but she truly hoped from the bottom of her heart that all the members of Group 1 would advance to the next class with her.She behaved like the disciplinarian of the class (it seems she has an aptitude for it), but in truth, she was a big-hearted cadet\u2014one who cared most about her comrades.There certainly was something special about this year\u2019s batch of beginner class cadets. They all had developed strong bonds centered around Jin.This was a rare case within the competitive system of the Runcandel Clan. Moreover, in most cases where strong bonds formed between cadets, they excluded the \u2018Young Masters\u2019 and \u2018Ladies\u2019 from the group.However, during the past few years, Jin had completely made these cadets his subjects.\u201cQuiet, everyone. As the transfer gate will soon open, I shall issue a command.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe cadets gathered around Jin in a circle.\u201cAs soon as we arrive at the southern border, we will set camp at the center of the area. Once everyone\u2019s done preparing the campsite, Groups 1 and 2 will go their separate ways and begin surveying the area in earnest.\u201dJin pointed at the map before continuing his speech.\u201cThe camp\u2019s use is for sharing information between us and reporting casualties. Each group will send a member to the campsite in order to share information once a day at a prearranged time.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Young Master.\u201d\u201cYou shall refer to me as Captain and not Young Master during the mission. And members other than casualties are not to rest at the campsite. However, each group may take breaks at their own discretion. Any questions?\u201d\u201cNone, Captain!\u201d\u201cThat is all. Let us hope that our target is alive and well.\u201dA few moments later, the transfer gate activated and everyone\u2019s bodies were surrounded by glowing mana.Once the teleportation was completed, the cadets and Jin found themselves at the transfer gate in the central-southern region of the Zhan Kingdom.Normally speaking, they would\u2019ve had to go through all the administrative procedures after arriving, but as soon as the employees saw the robes the cadets were wearing, they skipped all the procedures. The robes had the Runcandel\u2019s \u2018Black Sword\u2019 emblem on it.***Three days have passed since they arrived in the southern region of the Zhan Kingdom.The cadets had constructed the campsite and were surveying the area, but to no avail.The Zhan Kingdom\u2019s southern region was a land composed of grassy plains and forests. They were thoroughly searching through the open, grassy fields, but finding traces of a single missing human wasn\u2019t a simple task.\u201cIt seems we\u2019ll have to focus our search inside the forest. There isn\u2019t a single clue in the grasslands.\u201d\u201cCaptain, Edington says he saw Watertail beastmen earlier.\u201d\u201cWatertail beastmen? If they\u2019re here, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll encounter White Wolf beastmen.\u201dWatertail Tribe beastmen are a docile and gentle tribe that catch fish in rivers or seas using their harpoon-shaped tails.They aren\u2019t found in areas where White Wolf beastmen or Red Tiger beastmen reside. Watertail beastmen always avoid predators when building their villages.\u201cThe one who\u2019ll return to camp and meet Group 2 today is Bellop, right?\u201d\u201cThat is correct.\u201d\u201cBellop, depart for the campsite two hours earlier than usual today. You\u2019ll be slowed down by the sleet. And once you\u2019re done exchanging info, go to Area 13 instead of here. We\u2019ll be surveying that zone.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Captain.\u201dGroups 1 and 2 were meeting up at 9 PM every evening at the camp in order to exchange information.Once Bellop left the group, the other members also began moving towards Area 13. \u2018Area 13\u2019 was a woodland that hadn\u2019t been surveyed yet.\u2018Something\u2019s off. Even though Father personally gave us this mission, nothing has happened so far. Was I mistaken thinking that he was trying to test me?\u2019No incidents happened at Area 13 either, and they couldn\u2019t find any clues about the missing person.The only special incident that occurred was that they were gifted roasted fish from the Watertail Tribe village they found by coincidence.\u201cMissing human? We, not know. Watertail Tribe, nice. You all, miserable look. Fish, take. Gift.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. I know. Thanks. They\u2019re well-cooked. We\u2019ll repay you next time we come over.\u201dHaving searched the area well past midnight, the members of Group 1 were now waiting for Bellop to return in the rain as they wiped their wet swords. As the sleet continued, they found it meaningless to continue the search in the darkness in this weather.\u2018Since we didn\u2019t find anything even after surveying Area 13, we\u2019ll have to approach the beastmen\u2019s territory in order to continue the mission\u2026\u2019However, surveying the beastmen\u2019s territory wasn\u2019t a mission a beginner class cadet could do.\u2018There\u2019s no need to do such an unreasonable thing just to obtain good results. It\u2019s foolish to go so far. We should spend the remaining three days checking the surveyed areas again, before ending the mission.\u2019Bellop finally returned from the camp as the watches neared 2 AM.\u201cYoung Master! Young Master Jin!\u201dHe was in such a hurry that he had completely forgotten about calling him Captain. The cadets on standby stood up and rushed to Bellop as well.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Bellop?\u201d\u201cGroup 2 was attacked! Even Kiko\u2014who was sent to the camp by them\u2014had minor injuries.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEveryone, prepare to move. Was it beastmen?\u201dThe cadets immediately stood in line, ready to start running at any moment.\u201cNo, they say it was humans. Group 2 cannot use their flares as they have gone into hiding, so we must hurry to them!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24 \u2013 Jin, the Cadets, the Beastman, and\u2026 (2)\u201cTheir numbers?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ve confirmed three individuals.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way a mere three idiots would attack Runcandel cadets. There are definitely more of them somewhere. Edington, David! Once we get near the campsite, search for the assailants.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIf you find them, do not engage. Report back to me as fast as possible.\u201dJin hadn\u2019t expected the cadets to be attacked by humans instead of beastmen.\u2018If they still attacked us despite our Runcandel robes\u2026 Are they radical Zipfel followers?\u2019As they urgently ran, Jin continued to listen to Bellop\u2019s report.\u201cThe assailants were all wearing masks, so Group 2 couldn\u2019t identify them. But they did mention that the attackers were using the most widespread and common long swords in the Zhan Kingdom.\u201dIn that case, it was likely this was the work of insiders from the Zhan Kingdom.But he still couldn\u2019t put aside the possibility that Zipfel followers were behind this attack. It was possible that they had purposefully used weapons manufactured in Zhan in order to confuse us.\u2018If Group 2 managed to escape after the battle, the enemies mustn\u2019t be 5-star knights or higher. The problem is that we don\u2019t know who they are\u2026\u2019Why had they attacked Group 2?If they were indeed radical Zipfel followers, and if they had come here after hearing that \u2018Runcandel cadets were carrying out a mission in this area\u2019, then they would\u2019ve targeted Group 1 first, as Jin was part of it.After running non-stop for three hours, the campsite was finally in sight. They would\u2019ve arrived faster if they had travelled through the grasslands instead of the woodlands, but they couldn\u2019t afford to get discovered by the enemies.Edington and David separated from the group in order to search for the attackers. The only ones remaining near the camp were Jin, Bellop and Sierra.5 AM.If they headed towards Group 2\u2019s hiding place now, dawn would arrive. Since they still didn\u2019t know the number of enemies and their forces, the cadets and Jin would be at a disadvantage if light returned.\u2018I hope Group 2 hid themselves properly. They\u2019re all skilled kids, so I shouldn\u2019t have to worry too much\u2026\u2019The remaining three members of Group 1 began to move again. They planned on joining Group 2 at their hideout and waiting for Edington and David to return with details on the assailants.Jin and the others swiftly arrived at the hideout, but Group 2 was no longer there. All that was left was a letter at the entrance to the cave and puddles of blood on the ground.\u201cY-Young Master. This\u2026\u201d\u201cLooks like they got found already.\u201dJin clenched and ground his teeth at this sight.\u2018These motherfu\u2026 I don\u2019t know who you are, but I will find you, and I will kill you all.\u2019Jin hadn\u2019t felt anger in a long time. Even during his sudden death in his first life, he felt more despair than rage. And after his regression, he was busy making the most of his new life every day and had no time to think about his emotions.But this time, his head heated up with rage in an instant.The bloodstains around the cave all came from children in their teens. Moreover, those children were his subordinates who were following him.Jin closed his eyes and composed himself before acting rashly. He had to keep a cool head in order to find the enemies and avenge the cadets.\u201cCalm down, Bellop. The blood hasn\u2019t fully dried yet. It hasn\u2019t been long since they were found.\u201dJin spoke to Bellop\u2014who was gasping heavily. There was so much blood that he thought Group 2 had all been killed.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of blood, but no pieces of flesh or bones. And there aren\u2019t any traces of bodies falling onto the grass. Group 2 managed to escape during the battle. There are many footprints here. But looking at the sizes, it seems there were only a couple of enemies who were searching this area when they were discovered.\u201dSierra calmly nodded to Jin\u2019s observations. She was already tracing down Group 2\u2019s movements by examining the footprints and bloodstains.\u201cThey seem to have gone west, Young Master. And there\u2019s a piece of bandage here.\u201d\u201cBandage?\u201dJin quickly joined Sierra\u2019s side and observed the strip of bandage. It was most definitely manufactured in Huphester.\u201cThere was one attacker. He must\u2019ve wounded Group 2 before escaping first. Group 2 seems to have stayed here for a moment in order to tend to their wounds but had to escape as they predicted the attackers would return.\u201dLooking west, Jin would see a long path of grass being stepped on. Since there were no traces of horse hoof prints and only human footprints along with bloodstains, there was no reason for Jin to hesitate.\u201cSierra, hide in this area and wait for Edington and David to return. Then come rejoin us. We\u2019ll go after them, Bellop.\u201dThey were puffing and blowing as they ran at full speed. As none of them had slept a wink and spent the entire night running and searching, their stamina was nearing its limits.Bellop was exhausted just from keeping up with Jin, but the latter wasn\u2019t too worried right now. As long as there were five or less 4-star warriors to face, Jin could easily deal with them all.In fact, the one thing that concerned him was how he\u2019d use mana and spiritual power without the cadets noticing, but he didn\u2019t drown himself in those worries.He cared more about saving the cadets than keeping his secret hidden.\u2018Metallic sounds! The cadets are fighting people!\u2019Jin and Bellop\u2019s rushed pursuit was fruitful. After around 30 minutes of chase, they could hear noises in the distance. Bellop also noticed the sounds. They both stopped on their tracks to find the source.Jin stopped his breath and scanned his surroundings, checking if any enemies had followed them as well.\u2018We will move undercover from now on, Bellop.\u2019\u2018But Group 2 is fighting the enemies right now, Young Master.\u2019\u2018We\u2019re in a forest right now. Instead of announcing our arrival to everyone, it\u2019s better to sneak behind the attackers and strike them in surprise. If there aren\u2019t many enemies, we can end this within a few seconds.\u2019As the two covertly travelled between the trees and approached the source of the noises, they could finally check on the cadets of Group 2.They were in the middle of combat in the center of the forest. None of them had received fatal wounds such as amputations, but everyone had minor injuries such as small cuts around their bodies.\u2018Scott, Kiko, Zhushen\u2026 Where\u2019s Mesa?\u2019He could only see three cadets.(T/N & PR/N: #JusticeForTaimont!)The masked enemies numbered two. Seeing their movements, Jin came to the conclusion that they were indeed 4-star warriors.\u2018We\u2019ll strike them from behind simultaneously at my signal. I\u2019ll take the left, you take the right\u2026 Wait, no. Do you have a dagger with you?\u2019Bellop took out a dagger stored in his chest strap.\u2018Close your eyes.\u2019Why was Jin telling him to close his eyes in a situation like this?Bellop wasn\u2019t the type of person to ask himself such questions. If the Young Master ordered him to close his eyes, he would close his eyes. Once Bellop did so, Jin covered the dagger in spiritual energy.Spiritual power could enhance the cutting and destructive power of a weapon like aura.However, it had one more effect. When a weapon is covered in spiritual energy, the object\u2019s existence and presence thins out. Therefore, it could greatly increase the chances of success of a surprise attack, especially if one accurately threw the dagger without making a sound.\u2018Listen carefully, Bellop. As soon as I\u2019m done talking, wait for two more seconds and go attack the enemy on the left.\u2019Swoosh!As soon as he finished whispering, Jin threw the darkened dagger. The blade cut the wind as it zoomed across the forest, and lodged itself in the back of the rightmost enemy\u2019s head.\u201cUrgh.\u201dThe attacker that was swinging his sword around immediately stopped moving. But before his ally on the left could even turn his head to check on him, Bellop ran up to him from behind and swung his sword down the surviving enemy\u2019s back.The assailant quickly noticed the attack and turned around to parry Bellop\u2019s sword, but had his Achilles tendon cut by Jin\u2019s follow-up surprise attack.\u201cArgh!\u201dThud! Thump!Jin didn\u2019t reap the attacker\u2019s life immediately, and striked the back of his head and his temple with the pommel of his sword. And as the enemy fell to the ground half-unconscious, Jin pressed his knee onto his nape and completely suppressed him.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dThe Group 2 cadets ran up to Jin. Their faces were painted with relief and hope for their survival, but was soon followed by the despair of having ruined the young master\u2019s very first mission.\u201cIs everyone alright? Do you know who sent this bastard?\u201dJin slammed his fist down on the attacker\u2019s calf as he kept groaning and wheezing. He also put more strength in his knee to dunk the assailant\u2019s head in the mud.\u201cWe\u2019re okay. But Mesa was\u2026 captured by them.\u201d\u201cWe have failed you, Young Master.\u201dSigh.Jin exhaled deeply and grabbed the surviving assailant by the hair and removed his mask. It was the face of a 30-something-year-old man he had never seen before.\u201cThe ones who\u2019ve failed are him and his boss. You guys take care of your injuries for now. Scott seems to have been wounded the most.\u201d\u201cS-Spare me\u2026\u201d\u201cYou want me to spare you?\u201dJin couldn\u2019t help but let out a sarcastic chuckle at the assailant\u2019s words.\u2018Doesn\u2019t seem to be a Zipfel follower since he cares for his life.\u2019\u2018Spare me\u2019 aren\u2019t the first words a bold and reckless person would say after daring to attack Runcandel cadets.\u201cYou should\u2019ve said that before attacking my subordinates. You have two choices right now. Either you tell us your affiliation and why you attacked us along with where your headquarters are, and we\u2019ll kill you\u2014and only you\u2014painlessly.\u201dSmack, smack.Jin spoke as he slapped the assailant\u2019s cheeks from side to side.\u201cOr you keep your mouth shut, and the Runcandel Clan will kill anyone and everyone related to you in the most painful manner that exists. Choose wisely.\u201dThe attacker\u2019s eyes trembled as he listened to Jin\u2019s cold voice.\u201cYou don\u2019t have a lot of time to think. Make a choice already.\u201d\u201cWill\u2026 Will you really kill\u2026 only me if I talk? I know that\u2026 the revenge of the Runcandels\u2026 is never this merciful\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s usually the case. But I am someone who keeps my promises. My name is Jin Runcandel. If you talk, your family and friends won\u2019t be put in harm\u2019s way. I put my honor and the clan\u2019s honor on the line.\u201dThe attacker turned his gaze to observe the cadets. They simply stood quietly and nodded.\u201cI will talk.\u201d\u201cA wise choice.\u201d\u201cI am from a revolutionary group called \u2018Kinzelo\u2019.\u201dKinzelo.As soon as he heard the name, Jin remembered an incident which created an uproar and shook the Zhan Kingdom in his first life. It was the large-scale terror attack committed by the self-proclaimed \u2018revolutionary group\u2019 Kinzelo.Kinzelo was different compared to the radical followers of the Zipfel Clan.The Zipfel followers only targeted the Runcandels when performing terror attacks, but Kinzelo\u2019s area of activity was all around the world. They were crazy lunatics who believed that their king had to become the king of the world in order for their \u2018revolution\u2019 to be complete.\u2018Kinzelo had ties with the beastmen and caused so much chaos. They became famous for assassinating the King of Zhan and massacring so many civilians.\u2019However, Jin didn\u2019t know what happened to Kinzelo afterwards. He only knew that they were still active and thriving around the time he died.\u201cA revolutionary group\u2026 I see now. You planned on attacking Runcandel cadets, causing disorder in the Zhan Kingdom, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m only a low-ranked member, so I don\u2019t know that much. I also don\u2019t know the location of our headquarters, but the branch I was part of is located at the entrance of the beastmen\u2019s territory. There are around 20 members in that branch.\u201d\u201cI see. I\u2019ll ask one last question. Why did you capture Mesa?\u201dThe attacker shook his head and sighed.\u201cFor propaganda. Apparently, the superiors ordered us to capture the female cadets alive if possible in order to use them for propaganda and publicity for the revolution\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat a foul story.\u201dSccrrt!Jin pulled Bradamante out of its scabbard, and the attacker closed his eyes.Thud.\u201cWith this, I have kept my promise.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euA head fell to the ground, and Jin swung his sword one last time to remove the blood on his blade.\u2018The situation is dire. We don\u2019t have time to ask for reinforcements from the clan. I\u2019ll have to go on my own.\u2019***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25 \u2013 Jin, the Cadets, the Beastman, and\u2026 (3)Jin couldn\u2019t have predicted that they were dealing with the terrorist group from his past life\u2014a group he had only heard about from rumors. Moreover, they weren\u2019t satisfied with just attacking the Runcandel cadets. They also planned on kidnapping the girls.\u201cHow long has it been since Mesa was captured?\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been an hour yet.\u201d\u201cThen they must still be on their way to the beastmen\u2019s territory\u2019s entrance.\u201dJin approached the dead body with the dagger in the head and pulled it out. He then received two more daggers from the cadets and stored them in his boots and inside his robe.\u201cWe will also prepare to pursue them, Young Master.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019ll go rescue Mesa on my own. You stay here and finish treating your wounds. Once you\u2019re done, reunite with Group 1 and request for assistance from the clan.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201dThe cadets all showed surprised expressions.\u201cThe attackers we faced were all about 4-star warriors. How could we send you alone when there are twenty of them?!\u201d\u201cYou mustn\u2019t, Young Master. Please take us with you.\u201d\u201cRescuing Mesa is important, but your safety is our utmost priority, Young Master. In fact, it\u2019s far too dangerous for you to pursue them. Let\u2019s return and ask for reinforcements from the clan together\u2026\u201dThe cadets all raised their voices in disapproval.According to the now-dead assailant, there were a total of twenty members in their branch.The cadets were right. Chasing them to rescue Mesa was foolhardy. Especially if he were to go alone.\u201cAnd he might\u2019ve been lying when he said there were twenty of them. If we all die\u2014including you, Young Master\u2014the promise you made with him would be voided. Please make a careful judgement.\u201d\u201cMesa is a comrade we all care about, but deaths happen regularly on missions. And if we immediately ask for reinforcements from the clan, she could be safely rescued\u2026\u201d\u201cScott.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d\u201cAs you say, deaths happen regularly on missions. But how can a legitimate Runcandel child sit by and not do anything when a cadet was captured?\u201dJin calmly looked around, making eye contact with each cadet.\u201cI am stronger than you all think I am. So stand up straight and follow my orders. Any other objections will be considered insubordination.\u201dThe cadets all erased their distressed expressions. They couldn\u2019t say anything else due to Jin\u2019s powerful tone and gaze.\u201cI await with impatience for all of you to grow stronger so that we can fight side by side in the future. I will get going now. Oh, and Bellop.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSince everyone from Group 2 has been wounded, you are the strongest person after me now. Do you understand? You mustn\u2019t hesitate anymore.\u201d\u201cI shall bear that in mind.\u201dNow that all was said, Jin sprinted away as time was of the utmost importance.All the cadets bowed in his direction until he was out of view.Currently, Jin has reached 3-star spiritual release, 3-star swordsmanship and 4-star mana.Nobody would believe it if someone said these were the abilities and strengths of a 15-year-old boy. However, it was still reckless to face twenty 4-star warriors simultaneously with these abilities.Furthermore, if the low-ranked lackeys were 4-star warriors, it was likely that the superiors were 5-star or stronger.However, Jin was confident enough to go face them all alone, as the enemies weren\u2019t aware of his \u2018spiritual power\u2019 and \u2018magic\u2019.Moreover, although his swordsmanship was 3-star only, he had gained the knowledge of the secret tomes of countless martial clans. His chances of winning were not that low.\u2018I won\u2019t have to fight against twenty opponents at the same time. They\u2019ve all scattered around, looking for the cadets, so I just need to deal with one small group at a time while searching for Mesa.\u2019Jin judged that there was enough distance between him and the cadets as he came to a halt.As he calmed his breath, Jin created a ball of mana on his right palm. He planned on using mana to search for the enemies.\u2018Seismic Sense.\u2019Seismic Sense was a 3-star earth magic spell. As its name implies, it is a spell that senses the state of the ground, and is often used to detect earthquakes or other natural disasters.In other words, it wasn\u2019t the appropriate spell to use to track down enemies.However, depending on its application and links, magic has an infinite amount of possibilities and usages. Be that as it may, ordinary magicians require cooperation with another when trying to make use of the application and link tricks.Whoosh!As the ball of mana on Jin\u2019s right hand gradually permeated the ground, Jin created a second ball of mana on his left hand. This one was partially transparent as it was of the wind attribute.Multicasting.This was a skill that most magicians around the world could only dream of mastering. Without an aptitude for it, even 7-star magicians are unable to use this crucial skill.Jin could use multicasting since his past life, as soon as he became his magic teacher\u2019s pupil.\u2018Wind Pursuit.\u2019As he finished casting the second spell, wind began to gather around the transparent mana. After the wind blew around Jin for a few seconds, it detected the slight reaction from Seismic Sense and began flowing in that direction.The wind was following the information given to it by Seismic Sense.\u2018I\u2019m lucky they\u2019re moving in the grasslands. If they were in the woods, it would\u2019ve been hard to track them even with these two spells.\u2019If the members of Kinzelo had gone through the forest, the trees and lifeforms in there would\u2019ve disturbed the detection, making it nigh-impossible to find them.Jin cancelled his magic.Multicasting consumed an extreme amount of mana, and if there was a magician amongst the enemies, they could find out that they were being pursued.\u2018They haven\u2019t gone very far.\u2019After running for around an hour, Jin could finally see physical traces of the terrorists around him, such as footprints or flattened grass.As he was about to start running again, Jin flinched and immediately stopped all movements.When he checked the footprints again, the number of pairs had gone down.Thwish!An arrow came flying at him through the high grass. Jin effortlessly avoided it and aimed his sword in the direction it had come from.There was a ditch.The attackers had expected the cadets to follow them, and had dug a hole in advance.\u201cAs I thought, a Runcandel cadet! Your movements are good. I can see why Chaph had such a hard time earlier.\u201d\u201cThe kid dodged the arrow, Clark. Give me a gold coin!\u201dThree men wearing masks came out of the burrow and giggled amongst themselves.It seemed they had made a bet when they saw Jin: whether he would be able to avoid the surprise attack or not.The man they called Clark took out a gold coin and tossed it.\u201cYou made money thanks to that fucking brat. Good for you.\u201dThe winner of the bet caught the coin and smirked as he took out his sword. Jin was still silently observing his opponents.They were composed of one magician and two warriors.\u2018Their aura and mana aren\u2019t that strong. They must all be around the 4-star stage.\u2019While Jin carefully judged his enemies\u2019 strengths, the people in question thought the boy was frozen in fear.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much, kid. I don\u2019t have a habit of torturing people to death on purpose. We\u2019ll end this asap.\u201d\u201cBut why is he alone? Where are all the other brats?\u201d\u201cThey must\u2019ve all been killed by Chaph and Greg,\u00a0kekek.\u201d\u201cAbout this Chaph and Greg, does one have a scar on his left cheek and is the other bald?\u201dWhen Jin spoke up for the first time, two of the men burst out in laughter.\u201cBwahaha, scar on his cheek, bald!!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be hilarious when we tell them about this, hahaha!\u201dHowever, one of them wasn\u2019t laughing. The magician.\u201cYou, how do you know about Chaph and Greg\u2019s appearances?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious? I took off their masks to check after killing them. They were fighting against my subordinates, you know?\u201dThe glee in their eyes immediately disappeared. Jin was still holding his sword casually with an indifferent expression.\u201cStop bluffing. Those two are 4-star knights. They\u2019re not people some Runcandel beginner class cadets can defea\u2014\u201d\u201cDo you guys actually call assholes who gang up on kids \u2018knights\u2019 in Kinzelo? Your group seems vastly different compared to the Runcandel Clan.\u201d\u201cClark, Mills. Check our surroundings. It seems there weren\u2019t just children on this mission. This brat isn\u2019t a cadet. There must be a guardian knight somewhere!\u201dThe men didn\u2019t seem to think that Jin could\u2019ve killed Chaph and Greg. Even if he was a pure-blooded Runcandel, they couldn\u2019t imagine that a child who had yet to fully develop had killed two 4-star knights.Thus, the three of them immediately steeled themselves. Death could arrive at any moment for them. Before joining Kinzelo, they were either mercenaries or knights. And during those days, they had heard plenty about the strength of Runcandel guardian knights.Pfft hahaha\u2026Jin let out a chuckle.\u201cEven though you guys fear the Runcandels, you didn\u2019t think twice about attacking our cadets? There are no guardian knights here. I came alone.\u201d\u201cBullshit!\u201d\u201cIf I had a guardian knight with me, you guys wouldn\u2019t have been able to chat leisurely like this. And if I had one with me, where could they be hiding in these plains? Also, there\u2019s no way our knights would need to hide in front of three baboons like you.\u201dThe nervous men controlled their breaths as they observed their surroundings. Jin\u2019s words weren\u2019t wrong. There was nowhere to hide in this open area.And so, the men returned to their threatening and arrogant attitude.They were embarrassed and felt humiliated for being afraid of a kid like Jin\u2014a brat who seemed 20 years younger than them.\u201cYou really came alone\u2026 I thought you were an arrogant kid who trusted his clan\u2019s knights, but you\u2019re just an ignorant brat who doesn\u2019t know when to fear for his life.\u201d\u201cYou think so? It would\u2019ve been better for you guys\u2026\u201dBefore letting Jin finish, Clark dashed to him and swung his sword at the boy\u2019s neck.\u201cIf I were merely an arrogant kid who trusted his clan\u2019s knights.\u201d\u201cDieeee\u2014urgh!\u201dClark suddenly fell flat on his face with a groan even though he was just about to kill Jin. One of his legs had been cleanly sliced off without warning.\u2018Good thing I bought time.\u2019The cause of Clark\u2019s amputation was a spell called \u2018Wind Blade\u2019. It was one of the hardest spells to use amongst the 4-star wind magic spells.Jin had secretly prepared the spell while chatting with them.\u201cClark! What kind of Runcandel uses magic\u2026?!\u201dThe magician began to cast a spell to counterattack while Mills sprinted towards Jin in a fury as he wielded his sword.\u201cYou bastard!\u201dClang!Jin took a stance as he parried Mill\u2019s downward swing. The aura-covered attack felt heavy to Jin due to his immature body.Nevertheless, a single 4-star knight was no problem for him.As Jin pivoted and aimed for Mill\u2019s flank with his sword, the magician yelled.\u201cMills, fall back!\u201dFwoosh!A huge flame had formed on the magician\u2019s palm. He then launched his spell, swinging his arm, and the flame streaked towards the boy like a rope.A 4-star fire spell, Flame Whip. It was the strongest spell the Kinzelo magician could cast right now.Jin didn\u2019t avoid the attack and received it with his body. The corner of the magician\u2019s lips rose as he saw his spell hit. Jin then used the fact that his body was hidden by the flames to stab Mills in the neck with Bradamante.Slrrt\u2026!With a blade in his neck, Mills couldn\u2019t even cry out in pain and fell into death\u2019s embrace. The magician stepped back in shock as he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. The final member, Clark, was still on the floor, crying in pain as he held his stump of a leg.Jin grabbed the Flame Whip clinging to his robe with his hand and extinguished it. Sparks scattered around as the mana in the spell disappeared in the wind like ashes.As he had fully absorbed the Phoenix Heart, all fire spells of 6-star or lower rank couldn\u2019t inflict damage on Jin anymore.\u201cBlasted!\u201dThe magician began casting a new spell when he realized Jin had high resistance against fire magic. Icicle Shot. The same spell that had attacked Jin\u2019s carriage on his way to the Garden of Swords.\u201cDon\u2019t approach me!\u201dThe Icicle Shot flew towards Jin, but this time, it broke apart and fell to the ground before even reaching him.Beast King Orgal\u2019s Pendant. The artifact\u2019s mana had protected Jin. Penetrating the pendant\u2019s mana with spells of 5-star or lower was going to be difficult for the magician.\u201cH-How\u2026!\u00a0Uwack!\u201dBradamante drew a parabola as it slashed the magician in the waist. When Jin twisted the blade inside the man\u2019s body, the trembling magician bit the dust.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI have a nice sister, that\u2019s how.\u201dAfter finishing off Clark who was going into shock, Jin began running across the grasslands again.Obviously, he made sure to disguise Clark\u2019s injury as a sword cut instead of a magic attack before leaving.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swordmaster\u2019s Youngest SonCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018They weren\u2019t lying in ambush for long. The ones who captured Mesa aren\u2019t far from here.\u2019Jin\u2019s entire body was soaking in sweat as he ran across the plains.Since yesterday morning to now, he had been awake for over 24 hours searching for clues and pursuing the enemies. And since he had also engaged them in combat, his stamina was starting to reach its limits.In fact, the use of Multicasting and \u2018Wind Blade\u2019 were the decisive factors behind his stamina\u2019s depletion.There were still 15 enemies left.In the worst case scenario, he would have to face them all simultaneously, but if he is lucky, he would face them in small groups of two or three.\u2018Having a child\u2019s body is such a pain. I\u2019m still too young. If I had my past life\u2019s combat abilities, I could\u2019ve easily decimated those morons from earlier without having to strategize everything.\u2019During his chase, Jin realized that the attackers from Kinzelo were all shabby and unskilled.They were all ex-mercenaries or knights, but it bugged Jin how they didn\u2019t even bother erasing their tracks while moving.\u2018It\u2019s probably because they\u2019re underestimating us.\u2019Jin was on point. Kinzelo was looking down on the Runcandel cadets. While the cadets were part of the Runcandel Clan, they were all rookies who had yet to experience a real battlefield in their lives.Kinzelo\u2019s lack of caution was also evident in how they only left behind two members to finish off Group 2 after they captured Mesa. They had also placed just one magician and two warriors in that ditch to deal with potential survivors and pursuers.\u2018Keep underestimating us. I\u2019ll make sure you regret it later, though.\u2019Jin\u2019s greatest weapon right now was the fact that they were underestimating him. That was why he wasn\u2019t afraid of facing them all in battle despite his low stamina.He ran for another hour. This time, he was keeping an eye out for ambushes, but the footprints remained unchanged.In fact, he could now see the wheel tracks of a carriage in addition. Jin stopped for a moment in order to inspect those tracks.\u2018The ones who captured Mesa reunited with another group here. They probably locked her in the carriage.\u2019Now that a carriage was involved, it would be much easier for Jin to catch up to them. The ground was uneven due to the sleet from the previous night, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to advance quickly.As he followed the wheel tracks for a while, Jin came across an unknown path that continued into a forest.It was a road that led to the beastmen\u2019s territory.After recollecting himself and his breath, Jin entered the forest. The wheel tracks continued along the unique path into the depth of the trees.\u2018Well then, how should I plan it out?\u2019Jin was in the middle of the Cadet Rescue Operation. An unexpected situation had arisen during their mission, so his current operation had changed from scouting to rescuing. The search mission for the tycoon\u2019s missing son wasn\u2019t the priority anymore.In that case, what was the most important aspect of a rescue mission?The answer was obvious: the protection and safety of the target.\u2018Killing all my enemies isn\u2019t the priority. I need to make sure Mesa doesn\u2019t get hurt.\u2019Currently, three hours have passed since Mesa\u2019s kidnapping.Three hours. Too much time had passed. The dishonorable and immoral kidnappers could\u2019ve started using Mesa as a plaything during this timespan.However, Jin still believed that Mesa was safe. If they were humiliating Mesa, Jin would\u2019ve caught up to them already.The only information about Kinzelo Jin had was from the newspapers in his past life.They were a criminal armed group of radicals, who followed a strict hierarchy on the inside. That was how Jin viewed Kinzelo.A strict hierarchy.That was the aspect Jin was focusing on. It was highly likely that Kinzelo\u2019s members enjoyed their \u2018spoils of war\u2019 in an order of privilege amongst them, and hence Jin believed Mesa was still safe.\u2018I should reach their branch headquarters soon if I continue along this path. And it hasn\u2019t been long since Mesa and her kidnappers arrived there.\u2019About thirty minutes ago? One hour?It was probably something between that. The kidnappers were most likely handing Mesa over to their superiors right now.Therefore, this was the last chance he could rescue Mesa safely. Every minute, every second was crucial now. Thus, he had to attack them head-on in order to save time.However, if he did such a frontal assault at their branch headquarters, several problems would arise.If all the surviving members of the group were gathered there, Jin would have to face dozens of enemies on his own. And even if he could kill them all, they would probably use Mesa as a hostage.After thinking for a few seconds, Jin nodded to himself.\u2018First, I need to create confusion and chaos amongst them, so that they wouldn\u2019t even think of using Mesa. Fortunately, we\u2019re inside a forest right now.\u2019Two balls of crimson mana formed on Jin\u2019s hands. They were the same spell the enemy magician had used earlier: the 4-star fire spell, Flame Whip.\u2018Good thing I reached 4-star in magic before this mission. It would\u2019ve been difficult to burn down a damp forest with just the firepower of a 3-star magician.\u2019Fwoosh!Jin swung his two Flame Whips in all four directions. The spell has decent firepower, but its real advantage is that once it hits a target, it doesn\u2019t get detached so easily from it.In other words, there was no better spell than this to burn down a drenched forest. Jin cast the same spells over and over again.Magical arson was a serious felony in this world.However, such restrictions didn\u2019t matter to Jin Runcandel. Once the area was ablaze, Jin then conjured wind mana.\u2018Wind Wave.\u2019Another 4-star spell. Once he finished casting it, a blueish wind filled with mana began blowing the blaze forward. Just like the name implied, it was a spell that created a huge gust of wind that undulated forward like a wave.The blaze encroached onto the forest. Initially, it was unable to burn the damp trees, but once the flames grew large enough, it began swallowing everything in its path, wet or not.And so, Jin advanced through the forest as he burned it down. He concealed his body behind the flames, taking advantage of his resistance provided by the Phoenix Heart.His mana had greatly diminished due to blindly casting 4-star spells, but his plan was extremely successful.Now, he could see a building in the distance. It was Kinzelo\u2019s branch headquarters. People were exiting the building in panic one by one.\u201cFire! The forest is burning!\u201d\u201cReport to the captain! And gather the magicians!\u201d\u201cWater! We need water!\u201d\u201cWhy is there a fire\u2026?!\u201dKinzelo\u2019s members were running around chaotically. As the fire hadn\u2019t reached the headquarters yet, they planned on extinguishing it beforehand.\u2018I don\u2019t know who their leader is, but he\u2019s probably not crazy enough to enjoy the spoils of war during a forest fire.\u2019Now, he just had to kill them one by one and rescue Mesa. Jin removed the two daggers in his boots and covered them in spiritual energy.In the meantime, Kinzelo had no idea someone was aiming for their lives. People usually can\u2019t think rationally while in a state of panic during a sudden disaster.If there were a single cool-headed individual amongst them, they would\u2019ve realized this forest fire was created artificially.However, the warriors were hastily pouring water on the fire, whereas the magicians were busy casting water or ice spells.Jin easily managed to get near them as he was hidden amongst the flames.Swoosh!A shadowy dagger flew and stabbed a magician in the neck. The victim let out a yelp, but it was camouflaged by the sound of crackling branches and the panicked shouts of the others.\u2018That\u2019s one down.\u2019Jin threw the corpse into the blaze and set his eyes on his next prey: an out-of-breath warrior holding buckets of water. He perished the same way as the magician.Detecting the dark blade flying through the flames was difficult for mere 4-star warriors.Jin retrieved one of the daggers he threw. Including the one in his robe, he still had two remaining.\u2018It would be so satisfying if I killed them all like this, but even these morons would notice something if people keep disappearing like this.\u2019Jin lowered himself and observed the situation amongst the enemies. A man who appeared higher-ranked than the others seemed to have noticed something. He began leading the others and giving out orders.\u2018I should kill him first.\u2019As the man yelled something that was inaudible to Jin, the men around him all took out their weapons. They then scattered around the building.\u2018He had two magicians and warriors stay to put out the fire and had the others stay on alert around the building. Not a bad decision.\u2019Well, it would\u2019ve been a great decision if Jin weren\u2019t within the fire.Jin flew towards the commander\u2014who was left alone\u2014like a whistling arrow. He hadn\u2019t removed Bradamante from its scabbard yet on purpose. The metallic sound and Bradamante\u2019s white blade would\u2019ve ruined his surprise attack.Streak!As Jin suddenly appeared from within the fire, the commander swung his sword around in shock and panic. The boy bent down to avoid the blade, but he couldn\u2019t dodge the kick that followed.Bam!As Jin rolled on the ground, the man continued his flurry of attacks.\u201cYou rat! So you\u2019re the one who set the forest on fire!\u201dStab! Slash!The man kept aiming for the boy on the ground, and Jin rolled his body to avoid the attacks without a moment to rest. The man then threw his sword away and jumped onto Jin, seizing him.\u201cYou fucking brat! I\u2019ll definitely kill y\u2014\u201dBut Jin had allowed himself to get captured on purpose. He had also initiated this hand-to-hand fight on purpose by leaving Bradamante sheathed.Despite the man\u2019s entire body weight pushing down on Jin\u2019s body, he wriggled around like a flexible snake. Before the man could realize what was happening, Jin had already snapped his neck after deforming his body into an unnatural position.Crack!With the sound of the neck bones snapping, the man flopped onto the ground as saliva dripped out of his mouth.\u2018It was my first time using the Meyer-style martial arts. Fuck, it hurts.\u2019Jin could only deform his body beyond its limits to kill the man thanks to the Meyer Clan\u2019s martial arts.He dislocated his own shoulder in mere instants and passed his legs in between their bodies to twist the enemy\u2019s neck. It was one of the techniques written in the Meyer Clan\u2019s secret tomes: the \u2018Revenant\u2019s Assassination\u2019.He had killed the man who appeared to be the leader.All he had to do now was deal with the underlings who were mindlessly running around the blaze and the morons who were nervously guarding the building\u2019s surroundings.After fixing his shoulder, Jin set his gaze on Kinzelo\u2019s branch headquarters. The old stone building was slightly smaller than the residence of middle-class nobles. Jin speculated that there weren\u2019t many enemies left inside.\u2018He also had all the keys.\u2019After going through the leader-like man\u2019s corpse, Jin found a keyring and some gold coins. He threw the body and the coins into the fire and approached the building\u2019s front gate.Creaaaak\u2026As he opened the rusty iron door, the first thing he saw were candles. And on the walls were bizarre drawings he couldn\u2019t understand the meaning behind. They were Kinzelo\u2019s symbols.\u2018What an unpleasant bunch of people.\u2019He stuck to the wall and walked down the corridor. Not long after, Jin realized that he couldn\u2019t sense anyone in the area. At the very least, there wasn\u2019t anyone on his floor.And after using the keys to open every room he came across, there was a single key left untouched.\u2018Is it a key that leads to the basement?\u2019As the building\u2019s structure was fairly simple, Jin quickly found the entrance to the basement.The remaining key fit perfectly inside the keyhole. Once he descended the stairs, he saw Mesa chained to the wall.\u201cMesa.\u201dAs soon as he saw her, Jin felt relieved.She hadn\u2019t experienced anything concerning yet. She was still wearing the cadets\u2019 uniform. However, her face was bruised all over from being seemingly beaten.Clang! Clang!Jin imbued aura into Bradamante and cut the chains tying her against the wall.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 dangerous, Young Master\u2026 Why are you\u2026\u201dWhen he heard the very first words she spoke to him, Jin couldn\u2019t help but clench his fist and grind his teeth.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the moment to worry about me, Mesa Milkano. Can you walk?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I can run.\u201d\u201cI see. For now I\u2019ll support you, so let\u2019s\u2014\u201dBooooooom!The two of them flinched and raised their heads. With that sudden explosive sound, the entire building began trembling.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swordmaster\u2019s Youngest SonCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018Shit, what\u2019s going on now?\u2019After propping one of Mesa\u2019s arms over his shoulders, Jin was about to get up.Boom! Boom!But due to the sudden explosions, they had to stay crouching. The Kinzelo branch headquarters shook as if it were about to collapse on itself.An earthquake?Or did someone upstairs accidentally blow up some explosives?Jin stared at the ceiling and sharpened his senses. He had a bad feeling, but kept his composure.\u201cYoung Master, please escape first!\u201d\u201cSilence, Mesa.\u201d\u201cPlease promise me one thing.\u201dMesa spoke as she stared directly into Jin\u2019s eyes.\u201cIf we\u2019re confronted with a life-threatening situation, you must abandon me. You cannot lay down your life here.\u201dJin nodded silently.But that didn\u2019t mean he agreed with Mesa. If he actually agreed with her, he wouldn\u2019t have come to rescue her on his own in the first place. However, he judged that pretending to agree with her was the best way to calm her down in this situation.\u201cWe need to figure out what\u2019s happening up there first.\u201d\u201cCould it be magicians attacking the building? It feels like it\u2019ll collapse at any moment.\u201d\u201cThe magicians here don\u2019t have this much power.\u201dThe reverberations and explosions continued throughout their conversation.\u201cWe\u2019re going up. Unfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to support you. Concentrate and stay right behind me.\u201dThe two of them sneaked up the stairs.The impacts were happening on the outside, but the walls inside the building already had fissures and cracks all over them. The murals with Kinzelo\u2019s symbols were destroyed as pieces fell to the floor.However, oddly enough, despite the critical situation on the inside, not a single member of Kinzelo had entered to check up on the building.\u2018They\u2019re either still outside trying to figure out what\u2019s happening, or they\u2019re already dead.\u2019Jin exited the headquarters accompanied by Mesa. Once they were outside, he finally understood what was going on.It was the latter. When he opened the iron gates, he was greeted by the corpses of the Kinzelo members. They appeared to have been slashed by large claws, as their bodies were covered in scratches and lacerations.\u2018They were killed while trying to return to the building. And this\u2026 is the work of beastmen.\u2019They ended up encountering the one group of foes he wanted to see the least. Jin felt a bitter taste in his mouth.The outside was synonymous to hell.The blaze Jin had caused had already reached the building, and the small paths that weren\u2019t burning between the flames were covered in corpses in hideous states.\u201cMesa.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the beastmen. Looking at the corpses, it\u2019s a tribe that fights with their claws. Shush, don\u2019t say anything. Follow that path and keep walking. I\u2019m sure you can avoid the flames yours\u2014shit.\u201dHaving stopped midway through his sentence, Jin unsheathed Bradamante and raised it. Something was slowly walking out of the inferno not too far from them.His fur was far too white to belong to someone who had just stepped out of the fire behind them. A height that exceeded two meters and eyes that shone blue.The White Wolf Tribe.Their opponent held an enormous hammer in his right hand, and that weapon was the cause of the tremors so far that shook the entire building.With his herculean strength\u2014a characteristic that belonged to their tribe specializing in combat\u2014he had smashed the hammer around the building the entire time, as if to get some cornered mice to reveal themselves.\u201cHuh? I was wondering who subdued these pieces of shit, but it\u2019s just a kid?\u201dTheir opponent stopped on his tracks and began swinging his hammer. Meanwhile, Mesa was struck with fear. Not because of her impending death, but because of the Young Master\u2019s.\u201c\u2026Young Master, it\u2019s the White Wolf Tribe. I will buy you some time. Please keep your promise.\u201dHaaah.Jin exhaled deeply. He then turned around and karate-chopped Mesa in the back of the neck. Her trembling body flopped as she fell unconscious before she could say anything else.The beastman shrugged and grinned as if they found the situation amusing.\u201cGeez, what a tearful scene. Such a shame I\u2019m the only one here to see it. Is this\u2026 y\u2019know, that thing you humans talk about. That thing, um\u2026 Ah, right! Love! Are you two lovers? Hm?\u201dHe spoke like some crude, backstreet gangster, but the White Wolf tribe couldn\u2019t be compared to such weaklings.When compared to a knight, White Wolf beastmen were at least 6-star. And that was for your average adult beastman. In other words, they were a race born and raised solely for combat.Therefore, if Jin faced him in battle right now, his chances of survival were close to zero.\u201cI am Jin Runcandel, legitimate son of Cyron Runcandel. Reveal your name, beastman.\u201d\u201cRuncandel\u2026?\u201dThe smile on the beastman\u2019s face vanished. In these situations, there are only two reasons why an individual\u2019s smile disappears after hearing the Runcandel name.Either they fear the Runcandels\u2026\u201cLooks like among the prey I\u2019ve killed so far in life, today\u2019s prey takes the win as the most pricey one\u2026 Come to think of it, your robes do have the Black Sword on it. My name is Quazito Truka, warrior of the Truka Tribe.\u201dOr they loathe the Runcandels.And the White Wolf beastmen\u2019s case is the latter. Back in the day, it was the Runcandel Clan\u2019s first patriarch who killed \u2018Javier\u2019, a White Wolf beastman the tribe worshipped as a god.\u201cToday I will offer you to Javier at the altar to soothe his grudge and sorrows! Jin Runcandel! Make a choice. Will you have an honorable duel with me, or will you attempt to run away like a coward before being torn to thousands of pieces?\u201dJin imbued aura into his sword.\u201cI shall have an honorable duel.\u201dJin made that decision after taking the White Wolf beastmen\u2019s characteristics into account.Generally, they considered humans as mere preys or toys they could mess around with. They never showed honor or dignity, and cruelly killed their prey.However, there are specific situations in which they put their honor on the line to battle the enemy. It happens when they consider their enemy to be strong enough, or when they\u2019re a Runcandel.In these cases, they attempt to have an honorable duel with their opponent. They will put aside all underhanded methods and face their adversary with respect.Since those who die through this duel don\u2019t experience \u2018unfairness or corruption\u2019, they can be offered to Javier at the altar.\u201cQuazito Truka, I would like to make a suggestion before the duel begins.\u201d\u201cSpeak, Little Runcandel.\u201d\u201cDuring the duel, you cannot harm the unconscious human behind me.\u201dQuazito nodded in agreement.\u201cAlright. But if I win, that lass is mine to kill as well.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dJin moved to the empty area in front of the building. By doing that, he walked past Quazito. Nevertheless, the beastman didn\u2019t attack the boy who had shown his back to him. It was due to the White Wolf tribe\u2019s laws about honor and duels.\u201cThis seems like a good place. That way, you can keep your promise during the duel.\u201d\u201cGood idea. It seems you\u2019re knowledgeable about our laws. But keep this in mind, Little Runcandel. If you take advantage of our laws to double-cross me\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll tear me to pieces, whether or not that \u2018corrupts\u2019 me. I don\u2019t plan on doing that.\u201d\u201cKuhaha! It seems there are some honorable humans even among the Runcandels.\u201dJin smiled as he listened to the beastman\u2019s words.This Quazito seemed to have met a Runcandel for the first time ever. If he had encountered one of Jin\u2019s siblings instead of himself, there was no way he would\u2019ve survived and talked for so long like this.Jin and Quazito faced each other with around ten steps between them.\u201cLet\u2019s begin!\u201dQuazito lifted his hammer and took a stance. He planned on making the first move.Swoosh!Quazito darted forward as he wielded his hammer. He was unbelievably fast that no one would think his speed came from someone with over 200 kilograms of pure muscle mass.Jin avoided the blow by stepping backwards with skilled footwork and thrusted Bradamante towards the beastman\u2019s chest.However, a White Wolf beastman wasn\u2019t about to get injured from Jin\u2019s swordsmanship. Quazito adeptly changed his attack patterns as he overwhelmed the boy. Jin could only helplessly get pushed around by the giant enemy.Clang!During these few seconds of exchange, their weapons only made contact once. But that single blow was enough to make Jin feel like his wrists were about to fall off.No, it wasn\u2019t just his wrists. His entire body was stinging and in pain, from his head to the tip of his toes. Jin judged that he could only parry ten blows from this beast at most, before his body collapsed.\u2018I\u2019ll only get one chance.\u2019If he had no chances at winning at all, Jin would\u2019ve immediately broken Orgal\u2019s Pendant to summon Luna. And if his eldest sister were here, a weakling like Quazito wouldn\u2019t have lasted a single second against her.But this crisis wasn\u2019t life-threatening enough that he\u2019d break the pendant.Moreover, if he couldn\u2019t overcome a simple crisis like this, he wouldn\u2019t have the right or qualification to become the world\u2019s most powerful magic swordsman in the future. All the powerful and mighty individuals Jin knew overcame deadly crises in their lives and became symbols of strength.In cases like this, having a weapon that the opponent wasn\u2019t aware of was always an advantage.There were two crucial things Quazito didn\u2019t know about Jin. The fact that he could use both spiritual power and magic.\u2018I can\u2019t use magic, though.\u2019Magic was out of the question. If he missed the opportunity and failed to kill Quazito, he would have to break the pendant to summon Luna.If Luna noticed the traces of magic and Quazito blabbed about it, Jin\u2019s life would take a turn for the worse.Furthermore, 4-star magic spells wouldn\u2019t be strong enough to pierce through the White Wolf beastman\u2019s thick coat.In other words, he only had one choice: spiritual power. And Jin had already made up his mind on how to use it to overpower his opponent.\u2018I\u2019ll awaken the sword.\u2019Awakening Bradamante.The exclusive function that was only available to a contractor that controlled spiritual energy. The function Murakan told Jin not to dream of using until he reached 5-star in spiritual release.The day Jin received the sword from Luna, he actually attempted to awaken Bradamante that evening.When he awakened the sword, Jin felt a surge of power overflowing within and coiling around him. However, Murakan intervened and pummeled him, so Jin couldn\u2019t complete the awakening.\u2014Are you trying to kill yourself, Jin Runcandel?! You\u2019re the unique contractor! If something happens to you\u2026!That was the first time Jin saw Murakan get genuinely angry and furiously yell like that. In order to make up for that, Jin had to buy countless types of erotic magazines for the perverted dragon\u2026And now, Jin was waiting for an opportunity to experience that surge of power again.Slam!Jin groaned loudly as he blocked a heavy blow from Quazito\u2019s hammer. Despite Bradamante\u2019s perfect shielding, the boy\u2019s body was nearing its breaking point.\u201cThat\u2019s a good sword, Little Runcandel. It doesn\u2019t have a single nick even after receiving my hammer\u2019s attacks.\u201d\u201cThanks for the compliment.\u201d\u201cBut it doesn\u2019t match well with your symbol, the Black Sword. It\u2019s too white and dazzling.\u201dClang!Another blow came at him. This time, Jin was sent flying all the way to the Kinzelo building\u2019s wall.Slam!Feeling the hard stone wall in his back, Jin felt like his skull and spine would shatter. But he somehow managed to hold onto his consciousness and stay awake.Haaaa. Cough! Haaaa\u2026As he panted while coughing up blood, Jin could see two Quazitos approaching him, his vision doubling due to the concussion.\u201cIt\u2019s over now. I\u2019ll offer that sword along with you to Javier. That was a good duel.\u201dQuazito raised his hammer up high. If that boulder-esque weapon fell on Jin, he would perish without a doubt.\u201cFarewell!\u201dThe moment he was about to deal the finishing blow, Quazito felt his vision suddenly go dark. It was only for an instant, but for some reason, he felt like several hours had gone by.Quazito couldn\u2019t swing the hammer.Time had stopped momentarily for him.When he regained consciousness and looked down, his now-clear eyes saw a black blade impaling his body.A black blade that seemed to have been dyed by the shadows within the darkness.And on the other end of the sword was Jin, whose hair was swaying in the air like a blazing fire being fueled by a warm wind.\u201cJust\u2026 when\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know why a black sword was the clan\u2019s emblem either until recently.\u201dQuazito coughed and red blood splattered on the ground. But suddenly, Jin let out a horrible shriek.Once he calmed down, he spoke in a voice that was completely different than usual. A coarse, rough and unsettling voice.\u201cThat was a good duel.\u201dShhhhraaaaaaaa!The dead Quazito\u2019s shadow. Mesa\u2019s shadow in the distance. The shadows of the burning trees.They all flew towards Jin before getting absorbed by him.The shadows moved as if they were avoiding the light and taking cover inside the boy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swordmaster\u2019s Youngest SonCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFortunately, Jin successfully awakened Bradamante.Unfortunately, as all the shadows in the area were sucked into him, Jin felt the searing pain of his body tearing into thousands of pieces.His mouth was screaming on its own volition, and his limbs were subconsciously twisting around. Whether he opened or closed his eyes, he still saw the same muddled and dizzying darkness. Jin wondered whether this was going to be the end of him.It was a miracle he hadn\u2019t fainted yet.Jin realized this was the \u2018spiritual energy congestion\u2019 Murakan had warned him about.When the boy first attempted to awaken Bradamante and Murakan became infuriated, the dragon later sat down and calmly explained the dangers of the sword.When individuals with insufficient spiritual energy try to awaken the sword recklessly, they pay the price for it. If one experiences spiritual energy congestion, nine in ten people immediately perish.It wasn\u2019t as if Jin had forgotten about the energy congestion when awakening Bradamante during the fight.He simply didn\u2019t have any other solution to win and survive, other than Orgal\u2019s Pendant. But Jin didn\u2019t want to break it yet, as it could only be used once in his lifetime.The sudden mission issued to the beginner class cadets. The appearance of Kinzelo and a White Wolf beastman.Jin believed that while Cyron hadn\u2019t predicted Mesa\u2019s kidnapping, his father had planned for this unexpected incident to occur to examine Jin\u2019s handling of the situation.This mission wasn\u2019t to test the cadets. It\u2019s true objective was to evaluate Jin, and Jin only.\u2018If I had used the pendant to survive the life-threatening situation, Father would\u2019ve given me the worst possible score.\u2019Jin\u2019s father, Cyron Runcandel, was an extremely cold-hearted person.The patriarch was only showing interest in Jin because the boy was connected to Solderet and because of his prominent results and skills in class.However, if Jin disappointed his father a single time, Cyron would ruthlessly abandon all hopes and interests in his youngest son immediately.In truth, Jin was hoping for that to happen. As long as Cyron\u2019s interest in him persisted, the boy would have a harder time to act covertly and train his magic. Jin didn\u2019t really hold any attachments towards the clan and his reputation in the first place.However, today wasn\u2019t the right day to disappoint his father. Jin still had a lot to learn and receive from the Runcandel Clan.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRGHHH!Jin cried out in agony again as he bent his back on the wrong side. Each time a shadow got absorbed in his body, Jin thought that death wouldn\u2019t be a bad solution to escape this pain.If there truly were punishments waiting for sinners in hell, would it feel like this?The boy was experiencing the sensation of being burned alive as well as having his organs frozen at the same time.\u2018I can\u2019t lose consciousness. If I do, it\u2019s over for me. Stay focused\u2026!\u2019He had never experienced such pain even in his first life. The suffering wasn\u2019t as bad as this back when his teacher struck lightning at him for several hours to make him understand the essence behind lightning magic.Jin had no idea whether time was flowing or not. He wasn\u2019t sure whether a couple of minutes or several hours had passed since the agony began.He couldn\u2019t resist this forever. Jin had to do something in order to overcome this crisis.And the answer to this \u2018something\u2019 was obvious.\u2018Spiritual release.\u2019The boy barely managed to sit cross-legged on the ground and began gathering the spiritual energy inside his body to one location.Dark red blood poured out between his trembling lips, and his eyes had completely rolled back, unable to return to their original positions.He constantly coughed and gasped for air. Jin could feel that he was walking on a thin line between life and death right now.However, he couldn\u2019t control the violent and chaotic spiritual energy inside him merely with 3-star spiritual release, a stage he had just recently reached. Having started the spiritual release, Jin spat out a clot of dark blood and fell forward.\u2018Again, again\u2026 Again. Keep your cool.\u2019A strong dizziness took over him as he began to hear auditory hallucinations.Most of the hallucinations were related to the events in Jin\u2019s past life. Stuff like \u2018You\u2019re the disgrace of the clan\u2019 or \u2018A failure like you shouldn\u2019t have been born in our clan\u2019. Those kinds of auditory hallucinations kept constantly bothering him.However, such words and slander had no effect on the current Jin. He completely ignored what his ears were telling him, and concentrated on the spiritual energy inside him.Hot energy on one side, cold energy on the other.Jin instinctively separated the spiritual energy inside his body to the right and left according to their properties, as if he were sorting out pebbles on the ground according to their colours.The violent pain rooted in his brain slowly started to dissipate.His eyes rolled back to their normal positions and light returned to his vision. Jin\u2019s intuition was telling him that he was about to successfully gain control over the spiritual energy congestion inside him. As the agony diminished, Jin slowly inspected his surroundings.The shadows Jin had absorbed had returned to their original positions. However, unlike what Murakan had shown him in the Storm Castle\u2019s underground chamber, the objects that had their shadows stolen from them didn\u2019t get damaged or broken.The more the pain disappeared, the better Jin could think with a clear mind. Soon enough, Jin fully separated the two types of spiritual energy remaining inside him.His surroundings regained their original colours. The blaze died down under the influence of the spiritual energy, and the burnt forest smelled of ashes.\u201cPhew.\u201dAs he exhaled deeply, the disciplined spiritual energy came to a standstill.The energy no longer harmed Jin in any way.\u2018Did it work? The pain disappeared unnaturally quickly that it\u2019s making me nervous now.\u2019Jin stood up and started stretching his body. He felt nothing out of place. In fact, everything was as usual.However, the one difference compared to before was the abundant spiritual energy inside him. It felt like it was about to leak even if Jin stood still, doing nothing.\u2018In any case, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll have any problems moving around now. I should quickly head back with Mesa.\u2019Mesa was still unconscious in front of the Kinzelo building. In order words, not much time had passed since the beginning of his battle against Quazito.As he passed Mesa\u2019s arms over his shoulders, Jin suddenly turned around to face the building again.\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201dHe had detected someone. Someone was walking down the corridor inside the building towards the front door.However, unlike the Kinzelo members he had fought against earlier, this person didn\u2019t feel like a trained fighter. The unknown individual was walking carelessly as Jin heard their ragged breath.\u201cP-Please save me!\u201dAs Jin ripped the door open, he saw a terrified young man raise both his hands in defense. He looked delicate and weak, as if he hadn\u2019t faced any hardships in life. Jin couldn\u2019t help but tilt his head in confusion.\u201cWho\u2019re you? Another Kinzelo member?\u201d\u201cNo! Absolutely not! I am Cember Bill, from the Bill Clan of the Zhan Kingdom\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, so it\u2019s you. I almost missed you. Nice to meet you.\u201dJin grinned as he spoke.Cember Bill. He was the heir of the \u2018Bill\u2019 Merchant Clan of the Zhan Kingdom. He was the missing individual the cadets were searching for.\u201cY-You are?\u201d\u201cJin Runcandel. I was looking for you after receiving a request from your father.\u201d\u201cRuncandel?! Thank the heavens!\u201dAs soon as Cember heard Jin\u2019s name, his eyes began to glisten in tears.\u201cYou have saved my life. I, Cember Bill, will never forget this favour, Lord Jin. Thank you very much!\u201dAs he received the heartfelt gratitude, Jin could only stand awkwardly and feel guilty.Ever since the Kinzelo members had attacked the cadets, he had completely forgotten about Cember\u2019s existence and their mission to search for him.\u201cThere\u2019s no favour to repay. We received this mission after being remunerated. Now, stop crying. It\u2019s time to go home.\u201d\u201cSob, sob. Sniff. Yes.\u201dAnd so, Jin and Cember left the ashen forest as the former carried Mesa on his back. Cember only recovered his senses a while after they had left the forest.\u201cCome to think of it, how did you get captured by them, Cember? We only heard that you had disappeared in this area.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s difficult to talk about, you don\u2019t have to.\u201d\u201cNot at all. In truth, it was because of my lover. But I\u2019m not sure whether Lord Jin will believe me.\u201d\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I believe you? Did you elope with her or something?\u201d\u201c\u2026No. I came to the southern border because I was following my lover, who passed away two years ago.\u201dJin stopped nodding along and froze in his footsteps.\u201cYou followed your deceased lover here? What do you mean?\u201dHad he lost his mind from the shock of being kidnapped? Jin thought to himself as he observed Cember\u2019s gaze. However, his eyes seemed clear and alive.\u201cI\u2019m also wondering whether I saw a ghost or not. But it was definitely her. She had the exact same face, and also had the two moles on her wrist. She gave me a note that told me to come here. And you know what happened afterwards.\u201dCember awkwardly turned to Jin.\u201cHaha. As I thought, you don\u2019t believe me. I\u2019m also not sure whether I should tell my clansmen about this or not once I\u2019m home.\u201d\u201cNo, keep talking. The woman who gave you the note\u2026 Was it really your lover?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying. There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t recognize her. Her face, voice, her gaze as she looked at me. Everything was exactly the same as before.\u201dAt those words, Jin thought of a single name.\u2018Bouvard Gaston. This seems to be that transformation master\u2019s handiwork.\u2019The transformation crimes.A series of uncommon crimes that shook the world in his past life. When the Vermont Empire\u2019s special forces revealed Bouvard Gaston\u2019s crimes to the public after capturing him, a majority of them were kidnapping cases.And there was only one reason why he would kidnap a rich tycoon\u2019s son.\u2018He was planning on demanding a ransom. What is the relation between Bouvard and Kinzelo?\u2019Jin couldn\u2019t find the answer to that right now. The boy decided that it was about time he went to find Bouvard himself.Ever since the Zipfel followers tried to kidnap Jin when he left the Storm Castle, he and Bouvard were fated to meet one day. However, Jin hadn\u2019t gone to find the criminal until now as he was still growing and had no opportunities.\u2018The \u201cfragmented workshop\u201d he manages is located in the Curano Dukedom\u2019s capital. I should find an opportunity to go see him while I\u2019m in the intermediate training class.\u2019Jin felt a sense of incongruity whenever he thought of Bouvard.If the criminal was truly connected to Kinzelo and the radical Zipfel followers, Jin couldn\u2019t recklessly stir trouble with Bouvard as the backlash would be immense.\u2018I need to meet him face to face and find out what kind of person he is. It would also be a good idea to obtain more information about him that wasn\u2019t written in the newspapers in my past life.\u2019Having finished recounting his story, Cember smiled bashfully.\u201cThank you for taking me seriously, Lord Jin. In truth, I thought no one would believe me if I went back home, which was giving me a heavy heart. But seeing you listen earnestly is a breath of fresh air.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief to know.\u201dAfter walking for another two hours, Jin took out a flare from his chest pocket and shot it in the sky.\u201cThe main house must\u2019ve sent some reinforcements by now. Let us wait for them to arrive here.\u201d\u201cHuh? Lord Jin, did you actually call for Runcandel guardian knights just to rescue me?\u201dCember was moved by Jin\u2019s sincerity(?) and appeared as if he would willingly pay several golden crowns to Jin if the latter asked for it. Jin didn\u2019t have the heart to say that it was all for Mesa, so he only nodded awkwardly.Ignorance is bliss.\u201cI will never forget today, Lord Jin. If you ever need my help in some way, please don\u2019t hesitate to come to me.\u201dCember Bill spoke as he extended his hand.Jin didn\u2019t think the Runcandels would ever need the help of a mere clan of merchants, but again, he didn\u2019t say that out loud.Jin replied positively as he shook Cember\u2019s hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jin fought against a White Wolf warrior beastman and won?!\u201d\u201cImpossible. Must\u2019ve been some bandit wearing wolf fur or something. How could a brat who just became a 3-star knight kill a White Wolf beastman?\u201dThe fourth daughter Myu Runcandel and fifth daughter Anne Runcandel were chatting amongst themselves. They were respectively ten and nine years older than Jin and were both currently 7-star knights.A powerful White Wolf warrior beastman would be a difficult opponent even for knights who recently reached the 7-star stage. It was to no surprise that Myu and Anne couldn\u2019t believe Jin\u2019s achievement.\u201cEven if the youngest faced a beastman that was extremely weak compared to their tribe\u2019s average, a 3-star still can\u2019t defeat a White Wolf beastman.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. But are you telling me Mother seriously believed what the report said?\u201dThe two disgruntled ladies shook their heads. Meanwhile, two young men were as white as a sheet.Needless to say, they were Daytona and Haytona.Ever since the beginning of their ill-fated relationship with Jin back at the Storm Castle, the twins couldn\u2019t see Jin as a little brother. To them, Jin was a monster.\u201cD-Do you think that\u2026 Jin actually killed the beastman?\u201dHaytona spoke as he grabbed his twin\u2019s shoulder. His hand was visibly shaking in fear.\u201cNo matter how strong that monster is, a White Wolf beastman is impossible for him.\u201d\u201cI thought so\u2026\u201dA relieved smile grew on Haytona\u2019s face. But Daytona turned to his brother and stared at him in the eyes.\u201cBut it\u2019s not important whether he actually killed a White Wolf beastman or not, Haytona. What\u2019s more urgent is that we\u2019re done for if he advances to the intermediate class!\u201dDespair rooted itself in the Tona twins\u2019 eyes as they visibly lost their will to live.In truth, the twins were hoping deep down that Jin would fail his mission miserably. They were expecting for his advancement to be postponed due to his failure, and in the meantime, the twins would train harder than ever to grow stronger. And once Jin finally advanced to the intermediate class, they wouldn\u2019t have to quiver in fear of their little brother.However, it was all over for them. Not only did Jin successfully rescue the missing individual, he also defeated a White Wolf beastman. In fact, Jin was considered a hero amongst the cadets in the beginner class.\u2018Fuck, fuck, fuck! Sure, he could\u2019ve been stronger than us back at the Storm Castle since we were also young, but really? Even now?? We shouldn\u2019t have messed with him back when he first joined the beginner training class\u2026!\u2019Daytona sighed deeply as he recalled past events.Back when the Tona twins were in their 2nd year of the beginner class, there was a period of time when they fervently bullied Jin. As they had started learning proper swordsmanship two years earlier than Jin, the twins were stronger than their brother for a short while.Those first few months were full of delight and exhilaration.They could use the spars as a pretext to beat up their brother\u2014who used to boss the twins around back at the Storm Castle. It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that those months were the best days of their lives.However, their happiness didn\u2019t last long. A few months after Jin joined the training class, the twins got clobbered and thrashed by their little brother in front of the cadets almost everyday.And now, that nightmare was about to start over again as their devil of a brother would soon join the intermediate training class!\u201cThis is depressing\u2026\u201dHaytona spoke as he recalled the same events as his twin. His voice was weak and feeble, as if his soul was escaping through his mouth.\u201cWait, no. No! It might be alright. We might be able to win against him! Our hard work so far in the intermediate class won\u2019t go to waste!\u201dHaytona spoke with hope as he changed his mind.\u201c\u2026No. We can\u2019t win against him. Honestly, I can\u2019t believe that he defeated a White Wolf beastman. But I\u2019m sure that story has some level of truth behind it.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dThe twins lowered their heads once again and sighed. They were fully aware that they were \u2018below\u2019 Jin in the food chain.While the Tona brothers stood in dismay, Myu and Anne snorted and sneered.\u201cRight, I forgot we had these morons within the family. Sheesh!\u201d\u201cAre you actually terrified that the youngest is advancing to the intermediate class? Kyahaha!\u201d\u201cHiiik!\u201dThe twins glared back at them with tomato-red faces, but that only lasted for two seconds. Since they were in the middle of the 3-star stage, they wouldn\u2019t dare anger their 7-star elder sisters.\u201cDaytona, you just went hiik and squealed like a pig, right?\u201d\u201cWant me to break your arm and put you in the pigpen?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not it!\u201d\u201cOh? Aren\u2019t you missing something there?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s not it, Elder Sister\u2026\u201dThe sisters laughed as they watched the Tona twins. After a while, Myu and Anne grabbed one Tona each and kissed them on the forehead.\u201cGeez, we\u2019re just kidding! Our little brothers are just so cute~\u201d\u201cI know, right? They\u2019re so sweet that sometimes, I want to bite them and crush them into little pieces, you know?\u201dThe brothers trembled as they watched their sisters express their excessive love(?) for them. Then, Myu suddenly smacked her lips and grinned.\u201cHm, so\u2026 Our dear little brothers are scared of Jin?\u201d\u201cAs if we\u2019d fear the youngest, Elder Sister. Haha\u2026 There\u2019s no way that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cShush! You can be honest, you know? Keep in mind that I absolutely detest liars.\u201d\u201c\u2026We\u2019re scared of him.\u201dThis time, Anne wore an evil grin as she nodded. Myu and Anne were a great sister duo that got along very well, just like the twins.\u201cThen do you want us to help you out?\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cWhen there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way. And he\u2019s just about to get in the intermediate class, right?\u201dThe Runcandel\u2019s intermediate training class.It was on a completely different scale compared to the beginner class. The weaker cadets were at the 3-star stage, while the stronger ones were around the 5-star stage.There were far more members compared to the beginner class. The intermediate class was no different to a wild savanna or jungle: a place where the law of the survival of the fittest applied.In this setting, 3-star knights are herbivores, 4-stars are strong herbivores, and 5-star knights are savage predators.It was a completely different environment and atmosphere compared to the current beginner class, where the cadets considered each other as \u2018comrades\u2019 and helped each other out.As the spectrum of cadets was quite wide\u2014from 3-star to 5-star\u2014there were several cadets who had remained within the intermediate class for over ten years. Myu and Anne were using these \u2018senior intermediate cadets\u2019 as slaves and pushing them around.\u201cI\u2019ll tell our slaves in the intermediate class about you two. Use them to trample on the youngest.\u201d\u201cThey may be untalented pieces of crap who couldn\u2019t even graduate from the intermediate class, but they\u2019re still 5-star knights. They should be somewhat useful. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cOh, oooooh\u2026!\u201dThe Tona twins\u2019 eyes glittered.\u201cAre you handing over your faction within the intermediate class to us, Elder Sisters? For real?\u201dAs there were 13 siblings, there were obviously factions within the Runcandel Clan.Even the Tona twins had somewhat created their own faction within the intermediate class. In fact, one could consider the current beginner class cadets to be part of Jin\u2019s faction.\u201cHahaha, we\u2019re just lending them to you, you foolish boys. I don\u2019t like how the youngest is growing rapidly either. He makes me uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cIf you use our slaves and fail to trample on Jin, then you two better prepare yourselves, my adorable brothers.\u201dThe Tona twins squeezed their fists tightly and nodded.If they used their sisters\u2019 5-star cadets, then destroying Jin wasn\u2019t just a pipe dream.\u2018Is someone talking about me?\u2019Jin thought as he scratched his ear after finishing his report.(T/N: In Korea, there\u2019s this superstition where people believe that if their ears are itchy, it means someone is talking about them behind their back.)\u201cI hear you successfully completed your first mission. Congratulations, Young Master. Your nanny is so proud of you\u2026!\u201d\u201cThanks, Gilly. Can you prepare the warm water? I want to take a bath.\u201d\u201cEverything\u2019s already been prepared.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the best.\u201dYes, and being at home was the best as well. Jin began humming to himself. As he had been camping outside for an entire week, he missed taking a warm bath with pleasing soap scents.\u201cOi, kid.\u201dBut before Jin could enter the bathroom\u2026 an angry Murakan stood in his way.\u201cOh, my dearest Nabi Runcandel. I missed you so mu\u2014\u201d\u201cDid you lose your freaking mind?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see what you\u2019re talking about.\u201dJin flinched and avoided making eye contact with Murakan.\u201cHow. Many. Times. Did. I. Tell. You. NOT. To. Awaken. The. Sword?! You could die if things go wrong, alright? Are your ears the problem here or is it your head? Answer me. I\u2019ll get rid of one of those two for you.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 Why would the Great Black Dragon talk of such grim stuff? There were some circumstan\u2014\u201d\u201cHuuuh? Some circumstancessss?? So, those circumstances were more important than your own life??? Where in the world are there circumstances that are more important than Solderet\u2019s ONE AND ONLY contractor, HUH?\u201d\u201cLord Murakan, please calm down for now. The young master only just came back from\u2026\u201d\u201cStay out of this, Strawberry Pie. This is a serious conversation between us two.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cWait, Murakan. You see, I didn\u2019t do it intentionally. My cadet was kidnapped right in front of me, so how could I let them be? And I almost ended up becoming minced meat under the hands of the White Wolf beastman.\u201d\u201cThe pendant! Is Orgal\u2019s Pendant around your neck just for decoration? You could\u2019ve summoned your sister using that!\u201d\u201cThat would\u2019ve been a waste! You never know who I\u2019ll fight against in the future, so how could I use it now?\u201d\u201cA-A waste? Do you value that pendant more than your own life? Ah, my head hurts from talking with you. Ugh!\u201dMurakan held his head with his hands and fell. A flustered Gilly quickly ran and caught him.\u201cAre you okay, Lord Murakan?\u201d\u201cHey, you alright? Don\u2019t faint for something like this.\u201d\u201c\u2026Whatever. Fuck, what\u2019s done is done. It\u2019s a waste of time for me to get angry now. It just overheats my head and makes me collapse.\u201dHowever, as Gilly supported him, Murakan grinned from ear to ear. It was such a satisfied smile that Jin wondered whether he was actually mad at him, or whether he was just acting to get some skinship with Gilly.(PR/N: MAH MAN WITH THE MOOOOOOVESSSSSS!)\u201cHm, by the way, Murakan. How did you know I awakened the sword?\u201d\u201cYour spiritual energy suddenly spiked up to the 4-star middle stage, so how could I not know? You blasted kid. Do you think the promised contractor of a thousand years can just jump up a rank after a simple week-long outing like that?\u201d\u201cI did feel stronger than before after experiencing the spiritual energy congestion, but I didn\u2019t know it was by a whole rank.\u201dJin could only scream in delight on the inside. In truth, he was secretly concerned as his spiritual energy had suddenly increased, but seeing Murakan\u2019s reaction, it seemed there were no side effects to worry about.\u201cBe thankful to Solderet for being interested in you. I\u2019ve seen ten people experience spiritual energy congestion in my lifetime, and nine out of ten died from it. No, I guess it\u2019s nine out of eleven now.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the other person who survived? The first patriarch?\u201d\u201cNo, it was me. Temar would\u2019ve died from it too.\u201dPffft.Murakan and Jin chuckled simultaneously.\u201cAnyways, I dare you to attempt to awaken the sword again. Aren\u2019t you happy that you\u2019ve jumped to 4-star in mere instants? Well, that\u2019s the reward for putting your life on the line. So I dare you to try awakening the sword again before reaching 5-star. Because you\u2019ll definitely die this time around.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to go through that painful experience a second time either. Anyways, are you finished scolding me? I\u2019m gonna take a bath now.\u201dJin darted away and ran to the bathroom.\u201cStrawberry Pie, don\u2019t give him dinner today. We need to starve him for at least two days in order to set his mind straight. Understand?\u201dMurakan spoke as he saw Jin scurrying away.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I apologize, Lord Murakan. I cannot ignore my duties of serving the Young Master.\u201d\u201cGeez, I\u2019m so jealous of him. It\u2019s driving me crazy. That kid was born with such good fortune that he\u2019s overflowing with luck now.\u201dAs soon as the beginner class cadets finished reporting the results of their mission, chaos descended upon the Garden of Swords.As Garon announced the mission\u2019s flawless completion to Rosa, she wore a satisfied smile.The other Runcandels who were waiting at the main house couldn\u2019t hide their shock and disbelief.\u201cWhat?

It just overheats my head and makes me collapse.\u201dHowever, as Gilly supported him, Murakan grinned from ear to ear. It was such a satisfied smile that Jin wondered whether he was actually mad at him, or whether he was just acting to get some skinship with Gilly.(PR/N: MAH MAN WITH THE MOOOOOOVESSSSSS!)\u201cHm, by the way, Murakan. How did you know I awakened the sword?\u201d\u201cYour spiritual energy suddenly spiked up to the 4-star middle stage, so how could I not know? You blasted kid. Do you think the promised contractor of a thousand years can just jump up a rank after a simple week-long outing like that?\u201d\u201cI did feel stronger than before after experiencing the spiritual energy congestion, but I didn\u2019t know it was by a whole rank.\u201dJin could only scream in delight on the inside. In truth, he was secretly concerned as his spiritual energy had suddenly increased, but seeing Murakan\u2019s reaction, it seemed there were no side effects to worry about.\u201cBe thankful to Solderet for being interested in you. I\u2019ve seen ten people experience spiritual energy congestion in my lifetime, and nine out of ten died from it. No, I guess it\u2019s nine out of eleven now.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the other person who survived? The first patriarch?\u201d\u201cNo, it was me. Temar would\u2019ve died from it too.\u201dPffft.Murakan and Jin chuckled simultaneously.\u201cAnyways, I dare you to attempt to awaken the sword again. Aren\u2019t you happy that you\u2019ve jumped to 4-star in mere instants? Well, that\u2019s the reward for putting your life on the line. So I dare you to try awakening the sword again before reaching 5-star. Because you\u2019ll definitely die this time around.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to go through that painful experience a second time either. Anyways, are you finished scolding me? I\u2019m gonna take a bath now.\u201dJin darted away and ran to the bathroom.\u201cStrawberry Pie, don\u2019t give him dinner today. We need to starve him for at least two days in order to set his mind straight. Understand?\u201dMurakan spoke as he saw Jin scurrying away.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I apologize, Lord Murakan. I cannot ignore my duties of serving the Young Master.\u201d\u201cGeez, I\u2019m so jealous of him. It\u2019s driving me crazy. That kid was born with such good fortune that he\u2019s overflowing with luck now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swordmaster\u2019s Youngest SonCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs he relaxed in the warm bath, Jin thought about the fruits of his latest mission.He had strengthened the cadets\u2019 admiration and faith towards him. Where else would someone find a Runcandel who would willingly put their life on the line to rescue a mere cadet? Normally speaking, a hundred cadets would be forced to risk their lives to save a single Runcandel.Many of the beginner cadets held great potential. Mesa and Bellop were obviously very promising, but most of the cadets who participated in the mission were also very gifted.None of them would ever forget Jin\u2019s valour when rescuing Mesa in their lifetime.\u2018I didn\u2019t necessarily act like I did to gain their trust or admiration, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to have those.\u2019Rescuing Mesa wasn\u2019t a calculated scheme.Jin has lived for 43 years if you include his past life. So as a skilled, strong, and mature human being, he couldn\u2019t sit by and do nothing as a young girl got kidnapped and almost had terrible things done to her.If Jin hadn\u2019t saved Mesa during this mission, he would\u2019ve been plagued by a sense of guilt and shame for a long while. And he hadn\u2019t regressed to relive a life of such disgrace.He had experienced more than enough feelings of helplessness in his first life.It was now time for him to live a different lifestyle.\u201cHm.\u201dSwoosh!A black ball of energy formed on top of his wet, soapy palm.\u2018So this is 4-star spiritual energy\u2026\u2019It didn\u2019t appear different on the outside from back when it was 3-star. However, the weight was different. The ball of spiritual energy pulsating on his hand felt substantially heavier than before.4-star spiritual energy had as much destructive power as 6-star aura and mana.It was on a different level compared to ordinary forces. In fact, due to his spiritual energy, the current Jin was stronger than he ever was in his past life in terms of pure destructive power.\u2018But since my swordsmanship is still 3-star, I can\u2019t make full use of the spiritual energy.\u2019Spiritual power is most effective when used with a sword. Moreover, its effect is maximized when used with \u2018Bradamante\u2019 or \u2018Barisada\u2019, swords that were specially crafted to channel spiritual energy.Solderet is the God of Shadows as well as the God of Swords.Therefore, it was to no surprise that spiritual power and magic weren\u2019t a good match. Although magicians yearn for Solderet, they are only interested in the superior strength of spiritual power.\u2018But just because they\u2019re not a good match doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re useless with one another.\u2019It was all a question of efficiency.And now, Jin had the freedom of choice to select the most efficient methods at all times, as he could also combine magic with swordsmanship if he wanted.\u2018I should reach 6-star swordsmanship in the next five years.\u20196-star swordsmanship.It is commonly known that 1-star to 2-star are considered novice knights, 3 to 4-star are common knights, 5-stars are superior knights, and finally, 6-stars are elite knights. The rankings for magicians are more or less the same as for knights.7-star onwards are \u2018master\u2019 knights.However, there are countless masters around the world, which comes to no surprise as the continent has a population of two billion people.7-star is only considered a transcendental realm amongst ordinary people. However, amongst warriors, the 8-star stage and onwards is truly considered \u2018exceptional\u2019.There are noticeably less people who have reached 8-star around the world.As for the 9-star stage, there probably exist less than one hundred, even if one were to find every single eccentric hermit training in seclusion. Needless to say, there are far less than that at 10-star.Finally, the stage where there exists only one person.The unique realm, Genesis. That is the realm where one has transcended the limitations of humanity and has become a demigod.(T/N: The Korean word the author uses for \u201cGenesis\u201d has several meanings, and they didn\u2019t specify which one. Previously, the same Korean word was used for Cyron Runcandel\u2019s title \u201cTrue Holy Knight\u201d. So technically, we should\u2019ve translated it as \u201cTrue Holy\u201d. But according to the context here, we decided that \u201ctrue holy\u201d wasn\u2019t the right one, and changed it to \u201cGenesis\u201d. So from now on, Cyron will be called the \u201cGenesis Knight\u201d.)\u2018I\u2019ll definitely reach that realm in this life. No, I\u2019ll surpass that realm.\u2019In order to do that, Jin first had to successfully deal with his siblings\u2019 schemes and ruses once he advanced to the intermediate training class.Although Myu, Anne, and the Tona twins were conversing in a secluded area earlier, Jin could already predict the twins\u2019 movements. He was already anticipating all their possible plans of action.As someone who had lived at the bottom of the Runcandel food chain for 25 years in his past life, there was no way Jin didn\u2019t know about their schemes.Jin had never experienced the intermediate training class in his first life due to dropping out of the beginner class. But he was more than aware that the intermediate class was like the wilderness, a place where only the strongest survive.In other words, logic and reason were unnecessary in the intermediate training class.It was the same in the jungles around the continent. Although there are some smart and cunning animals at times who use their brains to survive, most of them are in the middle or bottom of the food chain.In that case, which animals live peacefully in the jungle without being bothered?\u2018I\u2019ll dominate the intermediate class with pure power.\u2019The ferocious predators that hold absolute strength.February 1795.The cadets\u2019 results and scores have been announced.All the members who accompanied Jin on the mission have advanced to the intermediate class. As the valedictorian of the beginner training class, Jin received a medal and the encouragement of the Runcandel Clan\u2019s elders. All the cadets that advanced have now moved to their new dormitories.Jin also received an offer from the second butler, Petro, to change rooms. Rosa had prepared a large room at the center of the mansion for her youngest son.The room was previously used by \u2018Joshua Runcandel\u2019 in his youth, Jin\u2019s eldest brother. After Joshua stopped using the room, no one was allowed to use it ever since.\u201cPetro, tell my mother that I\u2019m fine where I am right now. I\u2019d like to continue using this room.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Jin, the room Young Master Joshua used to use is the best in the Garden of Swords and holds great significance. It is the room that was only bestowed to the clan\u2019s eldest son.\u201d\u201cI know that much. But tell Mother that I just prefer it here so that she doesn\u2019t get upset. Understood?\u201dPetro had gained a good understanding of Jin\u2019s personality over the past few years. The 13th young master he knew had never changed his mind after making a decision.That\u2019s why it was such a pity.The room symbolizing the eldest son had been offered to him, so why was he refusing it? Jin\u2019s other siblings could only suck their thumbs while secretly wishing they\u2019d receive the room for themselves!\u201cYoung Master, please reconsider one more time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thankful for your concern, but I already said I didn\u2019t need it. And if you think it\u2019s a pity, use the room for yourself.\u201d\u201cYoung Master!\u201d\u201cHaha, in the end it\u2019s just a room. You may take your leave. I don\u2019t really enjoy using such big and burdensome rooms.\u201dPetro lowered his head in response as if he had gotten a wind of Jin\u2019s intention.The butler couldn\u2019t believe that the 13th young master\u2014a 15-year-old boy\u2014had such deep insight.\u2018He noticed that the Madame offered the room to him as a test instead of a reward!\u2019Petro then returned to Rosa and informed her of Jin\u2019s decision.\u201cJin refused?\u201d\u201cYes, Madame.\u201dRosa listened as she rested her chin on one hand and hummed softly. She was content with Jin\u2019s refusal of receiving Joshua\u2019s room.\u2018Jin. I sometimes can\u2019t distinguish if our youngest son has no desires or has too many of them.\u2019The room Jin had refused was none other than the Great Runcandel Clan\u2019s eldest son\u2019s room.It remained empty ever since Joshua moved out of it. In other words, it implied that the room was only bestowed to the child who would be \u2018responsible for the clan in the future\u2019. As soon as they took a step inside the room, they\u2019d get the full backing from the clan.And Jin had immediately realized that this beautiful offer was sweet bait connected to a terrifying fishing line. As soon as he moved into that room, Jin would\u2019ve been targeted by all his siblings.\u2018Mother is annoyingly insistent.\u2019Clack.Jin left his room with Bradamante on his hip.He was going out to check on the cadets he\u2019d train with starting tomorrow at the intermediate training class.\u201cGood morning, Young Master!\u201d\u201cScott, gather all the cadets who advanced to the intermediate class.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA total of nine cadets gathered in Scott\u2019s room, including Mesa and Bellop. Although they pretended to be fine, you could see the stress and unease in their eyes.\u201cWe\u2019ll be in the intermediate class starting tomorrow. Have you all resolved yourselves?\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cYes!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201cAs you may know, the intermediate class is divided into several forces under the name of \u2018factions\u2019.\u201dThe cadets all nodded in unison. They knew better than anyone else that they were the only people in Jin\u2019s faction.The cadets also knew they\u2019d be the targets of harassment, threats, and coercion due to that.It was a natural occurrence. While the other cadets couldn\u2019t torment a pure-blooded Runcandel, they could still target his faction.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be afraid. I called you all here to say that.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cYes!\u201d\u201d\u201dThe cadets answered with determined faces. Jin found their behaviour adorable and endearing.It was obvious who would be the first to aim at these kids starting tomorrow.\u2018First off, the Tona twins.\u2019Although the twins were probably still afraid of Jin right now, he was certain that they were scheming something.\u2018And someone else who\u2019ll help the Tona twins to keep me in check. It\u2019s highly likely to be Elder Sisters Myu or Anne. It could also be Elder Brother Vigo.\u2019Whoever the Tona twins\u2019 backer was, Jin was planning on outsmarting them.\u201cI\u2019ll see you all tomorrow. Oh, and during hours outside of training sessions, make sure you move around in groups of three minimum. You are forbidden from acting individually until I completely conquer the intermediate class.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201d\u201d***Starting from the intermediate training class, the cadets aren\u2019t taught by a guest instructor from outside the clan like Garon Altemiro. It\u2019s an elder of the Runcandel Clan who is in charge of the cadets.The elders of the clan who used to be 8-star or higher knights in their youth take turns teaching the class. They also used to be flag-bearers of the clan who failed to become the patriarch.Currently, there are around 150 cadets in the intermediate class. The elder who has been in charge of instructing them the past few years is \u2018Zed Runcandel\u2019. He\u2014who was once famed for being an 8-star knight\u2014was Cyron\u2019s younger brother.\u201cAttention.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cAttention!\u201d\u201d\u201dThe cadets repeated Zed\u2019s command as they stood at the training ground.\u201cThis year, we have ten new cadets amongst us, while 27 dropped out.\u201dZed spoke with a displeased look as he stood on the platform. He was dissatisfied by how there were more dropouts than newcomers.\u201cNewbies, learn from your seniors how an intermediate cadet\u2019s lifestyle is. My role is only to teach swordsmanship and evaluate everyone. As long as there are no deaths, just deal with all your internal problems between yourselves.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201cI ask the seniors. What is it that I always emphasize?\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cThe Runcandels have no need for weaklings!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cThe Runcandels have no need for weaklings!\u201d\u201d\u201dThe intermediate cadets suddenly yelled in unison and continued chanting the motto as they stared at the newcomers. Moreover, there was obvious malice in their gazes.Jin\u2019s cadets were pressured by their stares and shouts that they had a hard time keeping their heads up.Anyone around the world would also feel oppressed by a sudden ceremony where their seniors preyed on them with a morbid warning.Amongst the group of people shouting the motto were the Tona twins. Standing around them were several 4 and 5-star knights, who were all part of Myu and Anne\u2019s factions.\u2018How noisy. Anyways, the Tona twins are over there\u2026 There are a few people around them with deep frowns. Ah, they\u2019re from Elder Sister Anne\u2019s faction.\u2019The Runcandels have no need for weaklings!The Runcandels have no need for weaklings!The chanting continued endlessly. The intermediate cadets seemed to be planning on shouting the warning until the newcomers all lowered their heads.Suddenly, Jin stepped forward and approached the twins. His steps were light and relaxed as if he were taking a mere walk.\u2018Wh-Why is he coming over here?\u2019\u2018Don\u2019t be afraid! Just think of destroying him starting from today!\u2019The Tona twins communicated with their gazes and began yelling louder than ever. Zed watched Jin with great interest as he stroked his beard.Jin\u2019s pace didn\u2019t slow down. It appeared like he wouldn\u2019t stop until he stood centimeters away from the twins. The other intermediate cadets shifted their gazes from the newcomers to the Runcandel boy.Skrrrt! Slash!Jin unsheathed Bradamante out of nowhere and cut something.\u201cArrghhh!\u201dThe cadets\u2019 deafening chanting ended instantly. Their jaws dropped as they watched the astonishing scene before them in shock.The Tona twins were petrified like stone statues. Zed\u2019s hand also froze halfway down his beard.Jin had sliced off a forearm. The forearm that belonged to one of the cadets standing around the twins.As a member of Anne\u2019s faction, he was a 5-star knight. In other words, he was at the top of the food chain in the intermediate class. Until now.There was no way the cadet could have predicted or defended himself from that surprise attack.Even if one were a pure-blooded Runcandel, who in their right mind would brandish their sword on their first day in the intermediate class? During the warning welcoming ceremony organized by Zed Runcandel, to boot?As blood gushed out of the cadet\u2019s wound, the Tona twins couldn\u2019t do anything as they panicked. The heat and excitement that was overwhelming the training ground moments ago had completely vanished.The 150 pairs of gazes were all concentrated on Jin. But the boy in question didn\u2019t give any explanation for his actions and simply sheathed his sword.Instead, he spoke with a composed tone.\u201cCall the medical team.\u201dJin thought to himself:The ones that needed a warning weren\u2019t him and his cadets. It was their seniors.As he relaxed in the warm bath, Jin thought about the fruits of his latest mission.He had strengthened the cadets\u2019 admiration and faith towards him. Where else would someone find a Runcandel who would willingly put their life on the line to rescue a mere cadet?

And he hadn\u2019t regressed to relive a life of such disgrace.He had experienced more than enough feelings of helplessness in his first life.It was now time for him to live a different lifestyle.\u201cHm.\u201dSwoosh!A black ball of energy formed on top of his wet, soapy palm.\u2018So this is 4-star spiritual energy\u2026\u2019It didn\u2019t appear different on the outside from back when it was 3-star. However, the weight was different.

As soon as he moved into that room, Jin would\u2019ve been targeted by all his siblings.\u2018Mother is annoyingly insistent.\u2019Clack.Jin left his room with Bradamante on his hip.He was going out to check on the cadets he\u2019d train with starting tomorrow at the intermediate training class.\u201cGood morning, Young Master!\u201d\u201cScott, gather all the cadets who advanced to the intermediate class.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA total of nine cadets gathered in Scott\u2019s room, including Mesa and Bellop. Although they pretended to be fine, you could see the stress and unease in their eyes.\u201cWe\u2019ll be in the intermediate class starting tomorrow. Have you all resolved yourselves?\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cYes!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201cAs you may know, the intermediate class is divided into several forces under the name of \u2018factions\u2019.\u201dThe cadets all nodded in unison. They knew better than anyone else that they were the only people in Jin\u2019s faction.The cadets also knew they\u2019d be the targets of harassment, threats, and coercion due to that.It was a natural occurrence. While the other cadets couldn\u2019t torment a pure-blooded Runcandel, they could still target his faction.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be afraid. I called you all here to say that.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cYes!\u201d\u201d\u201dThe cadets answered with determined faces. Jin found their behaviour adorable and endearing.It was obvious who would be the first to aim at these kids starting tomorrow.\u2018First off, the Tona twins.\u2019Although the twins were probably still afraid of Jin right now, he was certain that they were scheming something.\u2018And someone else who\u2019ll help the Tona twins to keep me in check. It\u2019s highly likely to be Elder Sisters Myu or Anne. It could also be Elder Brother Vigo.\u2019Whoever the Tona twins\u2019 backer was, Jin was planning on outsmarting them.\u201cI\u2019ll see you all tomorrow. Oh, and during hours outside of training sessions, make sure you move around in groups of three minimum. You are forbidden from acting individually until I completely conquer the intermediate class.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201d\u201d***Starting from the intermediate training class, the cadets aren\u2019t taught by a guest instructor from outside the clan like Garon Altemiro. It\u2019s an elder of the Runcandel Clan who is in charge of the cadets.The elders of the clan who used to be 8-star or higher knights in their youth take turns teaching the class. They also used to be flag-bearers of the clan who failed to become the patriarch.Currently, there are around 150 cadets in the intermediate class. The elder who has been in charge of instructing them the past few years is \u2018Zed Runcandel\u2019. He\u2014who was once famed for being an 8-star knight\u2014was Cyron\u2019s younger brother.\u201cAttention.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cAttention!\u201d\u201d\u201dThe cadets repeated Zed\u2019s command as they stood at the training ground.\u201cThis year, we have ten new cadets amongst us, while 27 dropped out.\u201dZed spoke with a displeased look as he stood on the platform. He was dissatisfied by how there were more dropouts than newcomers.\u201cNewbies, learn from your seniors how an intermediate cadet\u2019s lifestyle is. My role is only to teach swordsmanship and evaluate everyone. As long as there are no deaths, just deal with all your internal problems between yourselves.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cUnderstood!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201cI ask the seniors. What is it that I always emphasize?\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cThe Runcandels have no need for weaklings!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cThe Runcandels have no need for weaklings!\u201d\u201d\u201dThe intermediate cadets suddenly yelled in unison and continued chanting the motto as they stared at the newcomers. Moreover, there was obvious malice in their gazes.Jin\u2019s cadets were pressured by their stares and shouts that they had a hard time keeping their heads up.Anyone around the world would also feel oppressed by a sudden ceremony where their seniors preyed on them with a morbid warning.Amongst the group of people shouting the motto were the Tona twins. Standing around them were several 4 and 5-star knights, who were all part of Myu and Anne\u2019s factions.\u2018How noisy. Anyways, the Tona twins are over there\u2026 There are a few people around them with deep frowns. Ah, they\u2019re from Elder Sister Anne\u2019s faction.\u2019The Runcandels have no need for weaklings!The Runcandels have no need for weaklings!The chanting continued endlessly. The intermediate cadets seemed to be planning on shouting the warning until the newcomers all lowered their heads.Suddenly, Jin stepped forward and approached the twins. His steps were light and relaxed as if he were taking a mere walk.\u2018Wh-Why is he coming over here?\u2019\u2018Don\u2019t be afraid! Just think of destroying him starting from today!\u2019The Tona twins communicated with their gazes and began yelling louder than ever. Zed watched Jin with great interest as he stroked his beard.Jin\u2019s pace didn\u2019t slow down. It appeared like he wouldn\u2019t stop until he stood centimeters away from the twins. The other intermediate cadets shifted their gazes from the newcomers to the Runcandel boy.Skrrrt! Slash!Jin unsheathed Bradamante out of nowhere and cut something.\u201cArrghhh!\u201dThe cadets\u2019 deafening chanting ended instantly. Their jaws dropped as they watched the astonishing scene before them in shock.The Tona twins were petrified like stone statues. Zed\u2019s hand also froze halfway down his beard.Jin had sliced off a forearm. The forearm that belonged to one of the cadets standing around the twins.As a member of Anne\u2019s faction, he was a 5-star knight. In other words, he was at the top of the food chain in the intermediate class. Until now.There was no way the cadet could have predicted or defended himself from that surprise attack.Even if one were a pure-blooded Runcandel, who in their right mind would brandish their sword on their first day in the intermediate class? During the warning welcoming ceremony organized by Zed Runcandel, to boot?As blood gushed out of the cadet\u2019s wound, the Tona twins couldn\u2019t do anything as they panicked. The heat and excitement that was overwhelming the training ground moments ago had completely vanished.The 150 pairs of gazes were all concentrated on Jin. But the boy in question didn\u2019t give any explanation for his actions and simply sheathed his sword.Instead, he spoke with a composed tone.\u201cCall the medical team.\u201dJin thought to himself:The ones that needed a warning weren\u2019t him and his cadets. It was their seniors.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31 \u2013 Fight, Win, Enjoy (1)\u201cKugh. Argh!\u201dEveryone stood quietly in shock as the amputated cadet\u2019s groans echoed in the training ground. The other cadets just couldn\u2019t believe what they were witnessing that they doubted their eyes and ears.\u201cArghhhh!\u201d\u201cWh-What do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201d\u201cStop wasting time! Go call the medical team!\u201dThe Tona twins raised their voices, although it was one step too late. Jin was still standing before them with an indifferent look.\u201cJin! You bastard\u2026! Did you lose your mind?\u201d\u201cWhy did you swing your sword without warning?!\u201dAlthough the twins objected to Jin\u2019s actions, their eyes were trembling in anxiety.\u2018Did he already notice that we borrowed our elder sisters\u2019 lackeys?\u2019\u2018But how could he pinpoint them so accurately and cut one\u2019s arm?!\u2019All the twins could think of right now was dealing with this problem no matter what.Otherwise, they\u2019d have to handle two catastrophes.Firstly, they had let one of their elder sisters\u2019 lackeys get injured on their very first day. At this rate, their sisters would reprimand them to death.Secondly, if they didn\u2019t avenge the cadet immediately and acted against Jin, their dignity would hit rock bottom.The news that the Tona twins had been humiliated by their youngest brother in front of all the other intermediate cadets would instantly spread within the clan. Shivers ran down their spine as they stared at the composed Jin in the eyes, but they couldn\u2019t allow themselves to shrink back in fear.How would they explain themselves to their sisters? \u2018We\u2019re terribly sorry. We were terrified of the youngest even though we had your lackeys with us.\u2019 \u2026 As if they could say something like that.Skrrt!In the end, the Tona twins unsheathed their swords simultaneously.\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it! Stop trying to crawl your way up the ranks!\u201d\u201cYou.\u201dJin completely ignored the Tona twins and turned to the cadet holding his bloody arm(?). The cadet raised his head and stared at Jin.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201c\u2026Kajin Romello.\u201d\u201cDo you know why I cut your arm?\u201d\u201cUrgh, I do not. Why did you do such a thing?\u201d\u201cHey, Jin! Are you ignoring us? Unsheathe your weapon again, bastard! It\u2019s time we brought this conflict to an en\u2014\u201d\u201cElder Brothers.\u201dJin slightly tilted his head to make eye contact with the twins.\u201cI am talking with Kajin right now.\u201d\u201cWh-What was that?\u201d\u201cPlease be quiet. If you wish to battle me, I will indulge on a later date.\u201d\u201cHow dare you! After attacking our cadet\u2014!\u201d\u201cYour cadet?\u201dHaytona almost instinctively blocked his own mouth with his hand.\u201cWas this individual a part of your clique? I only slashed him as he was directing killing intent towards me.\u201dSilence descended upon the training ground once again. The Tona twins could only stare in astonishment with their mouths and eyes wide open.They were planning on confronting Jin, but got wrapped up in his pace. With the exchange just now, Kajin Romello was established as part of the \u201cTona twins\u2019 faction\u201d.In other words, Jin\u2019s actions just now weren\u2019t a simple rebellious outbreak, but rather, a part of a long-lasting tradition within the Runcandel Clan.It was a part of their \u2018battle for dominance\u2019.The Runcandel\u2019s familial conflict was always a source of inspiration for travelling bards and minstrels. It was also great gossip material for drunk customers in bars.In general, there were no stories more exhilarating than the story of siblings having a bloody battle to trample on each other.\u201cThe medical team has arrived!\u201dAs a yell resounded from behind the rank of cadets, the crowd split in half to create a passage. The medical team behaved as usual, unlike the Tona twins or the other cadets. They had gotten used to seeing blood and wounds on a daily basis in the clan.Due to the medical team\u2019s natural movements as they settled around Kajin, the twins also had to get out of their way. Although they were pure-blooded Runcandels, they still couldn\u2019t disturb an emergency medical operation.\u201cListen carefully, Kajin. That also goes for all the cadets here!\u201dJin suddenly cried out as he lifted his head.\u201cI am Jin Runcandel. From now on, I do not mind if any of you behave like I just did towards Kajin. You can surprise attack me with your swords, or strike me from behind when I\u2019ve let my guard down.\u201dThe dumbfounded cadets stared at Jin with mouths agape.\u201cBut keep this in mind. If I sense anyone directing even the slightest amount of murderous intent towards me, I will not hesitate to cut you down as well. Just like what I did moments ago.\u201dAfter saying what he had to say, Jin casually returned to his original position. The cadets in the area could only gulp as Jin passed by them.He had caused such chaos, even as Zed Runcandel watched him with wide eyes from the stage.However, Jin didn\u2019t even bother apologizing to Zed. The boy knew that, according to the Zed he knew, his uncle would praise him instead of punishing him.\u2018He loves familial conflict and bold people more than anyone else in this clan. More than father, in fact.\u2019The medical team left the training ground with Kajin on a stretcher. The cadets all watched with impatience to see how Zed would penalize Jin.They all expected the boy to be reproached by the instructor. The Tona twins especially hoped that their uncle would severely punish their brother.\u201cJin Runcandel. The patriarch\u2019s 13th child.\u201d\u201cYes, Elder.\u201dJin didn\u2019t call him uncle on purpose. His father and uncle were similar. It seemed that the elders of the clan all preferred to be shown respect according to their ranks.\u201cYou\u2019ve done something quite dreadful. You dare\u2026 do such a thing in my presence?\u201dColour returned to the Tona twins\u2019 faces as they stood frozen.Zed Runcandel, their awe-inspiring uncle! Zed\u2019s thunderous roars could make anyone shrink back in fear, even their monstrous younger brother.\u201cThat is correct.\u201d\u201cHow insolent. Why did you do so?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t challenge my brothers just now. I was challenging you, Elder.\u201dNot only had he cut Kajin, Jin also made an offensive remark.At this point, even the Tona twins could only hold their breath in shock, despite their wish to see Jin getting demolished.\u2018Did he actually lose his mind? Goodness. How can he act like this?\u2019The twins were having the same thoughts as the other cadets.\u201cYou? Challenging me? What a very, very interesting story. What made you do that?\u201dSssssssssst\u2026!A white sword took shape in Zed\u2019s hand. Forming a sword of pure aura was something that only outstanding 8-star knights could do.\u201cSpeak. Depending on your answer, I may cut your head off immediately.\u201d\u201cDespite the fact that I was amongst the new cadets, you organized a special intermediate class welcoming ceremony. I perceived that as a challenge and attack from you, Elder.\u201dSwoosh, slit!Zed lightly swung his sword and a small gash appeared on Jin\u2019s left cheek. But the boy stood still and waited for a reply from his uncle.\u201cSo, you were offended by the ceremony I organized and caused all this confusion and chaos? You thought I was challenging and attacking you?\u201d\u201cWhile I was not offended, that is exactly it.\u201d\u201cIn that case, why did you attack a cadet instead of me?\u201d\u201cBecause I cannot win against the elder yet. Had I had a real chance of winning, I would\u2019ve slashed you instead of Kajin or my brothers, Elder.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to care about your life. Or maybe you trust your position as the patriarch\u2019s son too much.\u201d\u201cJust because my opponent is stronger than me does not mean I should sit back and get abused by them. I merely believe such thoughts aren\u2019t a part of the Runcandels\u2019 virtues and standards.\u201dThe legs of the cadets nearby were on the brink of trembling. They had no idea on what basis this 15-year-old rookie could stand his ground and run his mouth as such.Zed only spoke again after thinking to himself for a few minutes.\u201cSo you mean that one\u2019s life may only be temporary, but one\u2019s honor lasts forever? How foolish.\u201dThe sword-shaped aura on his hand dispersed and scattered away.\u201cBut this uncle of yours quite likes your foolish audacity. Good, I shall admit it. You are worthy of surviving amongst the Runcandels.\u201dKuhahaha!Zed suddenly burst out in laughter.\u201cRemember this day, cadets. Today, you have witnessed the very essence of the Runcandels. This rookie\u2019s attitude is the core of our identities as swordmasters.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cYes!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201cEvery day is a battle. You are dismissed! Daytona and Haytona will stay behind. The rest of you may return. Training starts tomorrow.\u201dThe cadets began to exit the training ground in an orderly fashion. The Tona twins felt like their blood was being drained from their bodies. As Jin passed by them, he spoke.\u201cAs your little brother, I\u2019d like to give you some advice.\u201dThe twins turned their heads to face him with blank expressions.\u201cAlways think about the future. You may be more afraid of our older siblings than me right now, but that may change later on. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dThe Tona twins couldn\u2019t even answer Jin as he smiled gently.\u201cWoah, I gotta say\u2026 His drive and willpower were amazing. Were we dreaming just now? I still can\u2019t believe that happened.\u201d\u201cDo you think the rumours that he killed the White Wolf warrior are true? Putting how we could join his faction aside, we definitely shouldn\u2019t have him as an enemy.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s still the 13th amongst the 13 Runcandel children. We don\u2019t want to ruin our entire lives by joining the wrong faction. The other Runcandels are all already distinguished\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not wrong. But still, he was quite the sight to behold. Just who would ever be brave enough to act like that in front of Elder Zed?\u201d\u201cAnd have you heard? They say that Young Master Jin may one day be the successor of the clan. It\u2019s an open secret that the patriarch has been dissatisfied by Lord Joshua, so\u2026\u201d\u201cShush! What if someone hears us? You\u2019re gonna get us all in trouble!\u201dThe recent incident in the intermediate training class immediately spread amongst the cadets. Every single intermediate cadet in the dormitory was talking about Jin\u2019s behaviour today.Meanwhile, Scott, Mesa, Bellop and the other cadets who had advanced with Jin this year were already being called the \u2018Youngest Division\u2019. In other words, they were the object of their seniors\u2019 sharp and pressuring gazes.The new intermediate cadets were moving around in groups at all times, just as Jin had told them to.\u201cSince Young Master Jin cut Kajin\u2019s arm, they may retaliate to get revenge within the day. Keep an eye on your surroundings at all times and stay sharp!\u201dMesa\u2014the unofficial leader of the group\u2014gave out orders to the rest of them. And around an hour later, a group of intermediate cadets came to the room where the Youngest Division was gathered.The Youngest Division members exchanged nervous gazes and took their stances as one of them carefully opened the door.Just like what Young Master Jin had done in class today, they were prepared to swing their fists as soon as they detected the slightest bit of murderous intent.\u201cNice to meet you, juniors.\u201dHowever, the intermediate cadets standing before the door were holding cigarettes, alcohol, and all kinds of food and snacks.It was as if an enemy nation had sent an ambassador in order to build a friendly relationship between the two countries.The Youngest Division was in shock, and couldn\u2019t help but receive the basket of food with blank expressions.In truth, after experiencing the welcoming ceremony earlier today, the newbies were extremely nervous about the chaos and violence that would ensue in their dormitories.They weren\u2019t afraid of being beaten by their seniors. In fact, they couldn\u2019t care less about themselves.Instead, they were worried that if they got beaten down by their seniors every day, it would sully Young Master Jin\u2019s dignity and reputation.\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what you like, so we just got a bunch of different stuff. The cigarettes were made in Milla, and the alcohol is from a famous brand in the Curano Dukedom. They were expensive, you know? We didn\u2019t put poison or anything in them, so we\u2019d be grateful if you accepted these.\u201d\u201cWhy are you suddenly giving us such things?\u201d\u201cWhy, you ask? Because we\u2019re currying favour with you. We\u2019re not affiliated with any faction, so while we can\u2019t participate in the family dispute, we do want to root for Young Master Jin.\u201dIn the Runcandel Clan, being unaffiliated to any faction meant that the cadets were not skilled enough.And despite being in this non-committal situation, these cadets had come looking for the Youngest Division because of the Tona twins.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euThese cadets had experienced all kinds of torment and bullying ever since the Tona twins had advanced to the intermediate class one year ago. Therefore, they wanted to express their gratitude to Jin.The Tona twins only behaved like obedient sheep in front of Jin or other Runcandel children, but most of the time, they were tyrannical madmen.They weren\u2019t known as the Nefarious Homicidal Maniacs for nothing in Jin\u2019s first life.\u201cWell then, we\u2019ll be going. I hope that your future is brighter and more promising than ours.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32 \u2013 Fight, Win, Enjoy (2)Phewwww!Having returned to his room, Jin let out a long sigh. He shut the door and leaned against the wall as the tension left him.In fact, he was glad he could finally express his stress and nervousness ever since the beginning of class.\u2018Sheesh, I thought my heart would explode.\u2019As he recalled his conversation with his uncle, Zed Runcandel, Jin could only stare at the ceiling in astonishment.Thanks to his regression, Jin was aware of his uncle\u2019s personality and thought process, so he knew what to say exactly to satisfy the instructor. However, knowing what to say and actually having to say it in front of his uncle were completely different problems.Had Jin shown even the slightest hint of fear on his expression before Zed, one of his limbs would\u2019ve been sent flying immediately. In fact, his uncle might\u2019ve even cleanly sliced Jin\u2019s head off like he had said.However, Jin had successfully resolved the situation. He had planted a powerful and intense image of himself inside Zed and the other cadets\u2019 minds. Moreover, Jin had already declared war on the Tona twins\u2019 faction over the hegemony of the intermediate class.Although the benefits Jin received seemed far too little compared to how he had risked his life to confront Zed, the boy knew it was worth it.Jin knew better than anyone else that one could very easily lose their life in the Runcandel Clan for the smallest of issues, and that one couldn\u2019t earn anything unless they used all their forces and strength.\u2018Fight, win, and enjoy the benefits\u2026 I\u2019m sure that even if everyone were a regressor, they wouldn\u2019t be able to act and behave like me.\u2019The three great virtues of the Runcandel Clan he once hated in his first life.The current Jin was closer than anyone else to attaining these virtues.\u201cGilly.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve officially declared war on the Tona elder brothers. But it seems that Elder Sisters Anne and Myu are secretly backing them.\u201dGilly instantly froze. The hand that was wiping the tea cup stopped dead in its tracks.She had been expecting Jin and the Tona twins to fight over the hegemony when the youngest boy advanced classes. It was an inevitable conflict as long as they were all standing inside the same enclosure called the intermediate class.However, Gilly hadn\u2019t expected the Tona twins to have a backer. Soon, her gaze darkened and deepened.\u201cLadies Anne and Myu\u2026 Are you certain?\u201d\u201cYeah. Today, I cut down a cadet who was alongside Elder Brothers, and after looking into it, he was a part of Elder Sisters Anne and Myu\u2019s faction. In fact, there\u2019s no way the Tona Elder Brothers would already have a 5-star knight in their faction.\u201dEven if someone is a part of the Runcandel direct lineage, a knight of the clan won\u2019t be willing to subordinate themselves to someone weaker than them. However, the Tona twins were still only at the 3-star stage.\u201cHaa, I didn\u2019t expect them to already start trying to keep you in check, Young Master, since they\u2019re already active flag-bearers.\u201dMyu and Anne were 7-star knights who had already fought on many battlefields. Due to their numerous contributions, they received the flag-bearer qualification from the clan.Amongst Cyron Runcandel\u2019s 13 children, only four had yet to become flag-bearers.Jin, the Tona twins, and Cyron\u2019s youngest daughter, Yona.Gilly fiddled with the dry tea towel with complicated feelings.\u201cIt\u2019s actually good news that my elder sisters are trying to keep me in check already. It means that they\u2019re already concerned by me despite our age gap.\u201d\u201cEven so, it\u2019s unreasonable. You\u2019re only 15 years old, Young Master. And it\u2019s an unwritten rule that flag-bearers should only fight between themselves and not get involved with their youngest siblings!\u201dGilly bursted out in fury.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I just have to change things so that my elder sisters don\u2019t just feel concerned by me, but also fear me.\u201dPoof!The sunbathing cat lying next to the window suddenly turned around and transformed into a human.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What are you talking about? Lemme in on it as well.\u201dGilly explained the situation in simple terms to Murakan, who then sighed deeply.\u201cIt\u2019s such a pity I can\u2019t reveal my identity yet. I could easily beat up two 7-star knights with the flick of a finger. Why do your siblings obsess with trampling on you even though you\u2019re the clan\u2019s only hope of defeating the Zipfels in the future?\u201dThe clan\u2019s only hope of defeating the Zipfels in the future.Murakan\u2019s words were accurate. If Jin mastered Solderet\u2019s power and stayed within the clan, the Runcandels could trample on the Zipfels and take over the world in the future.Currently, the Zipfels had the upper hand. If the Runcandels and Zipfels were to start an all out war today, the clan of magicians would come out victorious in the end.But the Zipfel Clan hadn\u2019t declared war on the Runcandels yet for two reasons:The conflict would cause irreparable damage to the Zipfels, and the existence of Cyron Runcandel.However, there was one teensy-weensy, but ever so crucial, little tiny detail the Zipfels weren\u2019t aware of. The god they were desperately yearning for\u2014Solderet\u2014was currently contracted to Jin.\u201cAre your siblings acting like this because they don\u2019t know you\u2019re Solderet\u2019s contractor?\u201d\u201cNo, they just try to keep anyone who shows potential in check. In fact, if they knew I was Solderet\u2019s contractor, they would\u2019ve been ten times more motivated to trample me down. It would\u2019ve been a miracle if I survived till the age of 15.\u201d\u201cEven so, the clan is still as fucked up as it was a thousand years ago. In fact, things might\u2019ve been better back then. Your first patriarch was rude and insolent, but he still had compassion and heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026Then what do you plan on doing from now on, Young Master?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve got no reason to hesitate. I\u2019ve already dealt my sisters a heavy blow. Not only did I cut down their strongest intermediate-class subordinate on my first day, I also shifted his official affiliation to the Tona faction instead of my sisters\u2019.\u201dJin explained the incident at the training ground to the other two in detail.Officially speaking, Kajin was not a member of Anne and Myu\u2019s faction anymore, as the Tona twins had called him \u2018our cadet\u2019.\u201cI\u2019m sure my elder brothers will get beaten to death by our sisters. They\u2019ll definitely come to the training ground tomorrow with bruised and swollen faces. It\u2019ll be hard for them to try to oppress me with their intermediate-class subordinates now.\u201dIf a king bestowed his strongest army to a general and the general returned after getting the entire army decimated, the king wouldn\u2019t give them a second chance.That was the situation between Myu, Anne, and the Tona twins.\u201cAnd since they\u2019re already flag-bearers, my elder sisters can\u2019t personally come to the intermediate class to beat me to death. In that case, there\u2019s just one last method they can use to attempt to oppress me.\u201dGilly gasped as she realized what Jin was talking about.\u201cThrough missions!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. They\u2019ll most likely manipulate the missions I receive with their authority as flag-bearers. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll specifically choose to assign me disgustingly difficult missions and earnestly wait for me to die on duty or to return with a severe injury.\u201d\u201cI will try to discuss it with the ladies\u2019 nannies. I cannot let such a thing happen to you, Young Master.\u201dThe kind and naive Gilly didn\u2019t know how to think in a cunning and sly manner.\u201cYou mustn\u2019t, Gilly. If they find out, Elder Sisters will accuse me of trying to abuse my power and will take disciplinary action against me. And the supervision of missions is part of the flag-bearers\u2019 jurisdiction, so if we have no real explanation, we cannot stop them from manipulating my schedule of missions.\u201d\u201cShit! God-fucking-dammit! Ack, apologies, Young Master. That came out on the spur of the moment\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Strawberry Pie.\u201dMurakan replied in Jin\u2019s stead. The boy also smiled gently and continued his words.\u201cBut there\u2019s one thing my elder sisters aren\u2019t aware of. Most of the difficult missions are one-man tasks\u2026 But if I\u2019m assigned one-man missions, I won\u2019t have to hold back and hide my true abilities, don\u2019t you think?\u201dUnlike group missions, Jin would be able to use magic and spiritual power when carrying out solo missions.He could use magic, spiritual power, and the combat techniques written in the secret tomes of the various martial clans as long as there was no one around or he killed all the witnesses.\u201cSo solo missions are actually a great opportunity for me. If my elder sisters send me on solo missions, I\u2019d be infinitely grateful. It\u2019s suffocating having to limit myself with just swordsmanship. I\u2019ll just go on the missions, use my hidden abilities to wipe out my enemies, and gain some achievements.\u201dAchievements on missions. That was the absolute criterion the instructors used to evaluate the cadets in the intermediate class.There were cases where a cadet had excellent swordsmanship but fell behind on missions, and vice versa. Needless to say, the more important criterion was the missions.Moreover, solo missions with high difficulties were the best missions to carry out in order to gain the most points. Solo missions usually consisted of assassinations and espionage, so they were the most dangerous tasks.\u201cThat\u2019s a great plan, kid!\u201d\u201c\u2026If you were to use all your hidden abilities, you should be able to rival the weaker advanced-class cadets, Young Master.\u201dMurakan and Gilly were well aware of Jin\u2019s true combat capabilities. Since Jin\u2019s swordsmanship was developing at a quick pace, he would probably reach the 4-star stage before being sent on his first mission.\u201cAnd if one of the missions appears to be too difficult for you, I could accompany you to help out. Even if it\u2019s a solo mission, they should allow you to take a mere cat along, no?\u201d\u201cThey would. But I need you to do something else for me.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you later. Since we\u2019ve discussed the most important stuff, I should head over to Elder Sister Luna\u2019s training session now. Behave yourself while I\u2019m gone and don\u2019t cause any problems.\u201dThe intermediate class began its training in earnest.Compared to the beginner training class, there were no particular differences in the regimen other than the fact that the cadets used real swords and that the difficulty was higher.However, when the afternoon classes began, Jin and the Tona twins were led to a hidden area inside the training ground and were taught the \u2018Runcandel Swordsmanship\u2019. This was a privilege only available to direct Runcandel descendants.\u201cOur clan\u2019s swordsmanship is, in simple terms, overpowering. It\u2019s destructive and unwavering. The clan\u2019s personality and virtues are perfectly embodied in our swordsmanship.\u201dThe three boys sitting cross-legged on the floor nodded in sync.The Tona twins\u2019 faces were bruised and swollen just as Jin had predicted. They had been pummelled and beaten by their sisters all night long.However, Zed didn\u2019t even bother asking why the twins were in such pitiable states. He didn\u2019t care. He already knew that the Tona twins didn\u2019t have great potential since before Jin joined the intermediate class.\u2018I never thought the day would ever come when I\u2019d feel pity for the Tona twins. Still, they reap what they sow.\u2019They were crazy homicidal maniacs in Jin\u2019s past life and were growing up to become the same homicidal maniacs right now.However, the twins were treated as outstanding, genius kids in the outside world. Yet, they fell short in Zed\u2019s eyes, and their uncle couldn\u2019t care less about them now.Moreover, the twins had gotten humiliated by their little brother yesterday, so Zed couldn\u2019t be more displeased with them.However, it wasn\u2019t as if Zed held absolutely no sense of affection towards them.Do not confront the youngest until you two are strong enough. That is, if you wish to live long. That child isn\u2019t someone you two can rival.Yesterday, after telling the twins to stay behind after class, Zed warned Jin\u2019s older brothers as so.\u201cYou three must already be aware, but our clan\u2019s swordsmanship doesn\u2019t have a single style or form. While we do have secret techniques and decisive killing moves, those are only taught once you become flag-bearers.\u201dThe swordsmanship that is taught to the direct Runcandel descendants is a formless style of swordsmanship. It was different compared to the style taught to the cadets.There were no patterns, no footwork, and no real shape or form. This was the biggest difference between the Runcandel Clan and other martial clans.\u201cDo you know why our clan\u2019s swordsmanship is formless?\u201d\u201cIt is due to the special physical capabilities and sensory faculties that the Runcandel bloodline possesses.\u201d\u201cCorrect. The Runcandel lineage possesses blessed bodies. We hold special sensory faculties towards our own bodies and the sword that no ordinary human could understand. No one else! Not a single person out of thousands or tens of thousands.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe timing at which the bloodline\u2019s blessing blooms and the overall effect on one\u2019s talents were different for each individual. However, the blessing did indeed bloom in every single Runcandel since a thousand years ago. No one was exempted from it.However, the bloodline\u2019s affinity with magic was incredibly low. Jin was an extremely rare exception to the rule amongst the Runcandels.Zed continued his words and finished his explanation.\u201cAnd so, what I\u2019m about to teach you three is extremely simple and unsophisticated. Get up.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33 \u2013 Fight, Win, Enjoy (3)Zed pointed next to the three kids.Over there were roundish balls of metal piled up like mountains, and several tables standing next to those piles.\u201cBring those tables and steel balls here.\u201d\u201cHow many of them should we move?\u201dZed smirked maliciously at Haytona\u2019s question.\u201cFour tables, and as many steel balls as you can.\u201dThe three boys began moving the tables and balls towards the center of the hidden area. The steel balls were heavier than your average person. Moreover, when they picked one up, they felt something dense moving around inside.\u2018What are these?\u2019As he moved the steel balls, Jin scanned through his memories, and confirmed that he had never seen these objects in his past life.Yet, he wasn\u2019t surprised about that. From what he had deduced, these steel balls were used to teach the direct Runcandel descendants the clan\u2019s swordsmanship. However, Jin wasn\u2019t talented enough to enter the intermediate class and train with his uncle in his first life.Thud, thud.Each time they dropped a ball to the floor, it left dents on the hard ground.Zed only told them to stop after the three boys moved around fifty of those steel balls.\u201cDo you know what these balls are?\u201dHe asked as he placed one of them on a table. The ball was now sitting slightly below the height of Zed\u2019s waist.\u201cNo, sir.\u201d\u201cThese steel balls are called Clear Stones, because you can hear a clear echo resounding when you hit them.\u201dThe Tona twins tilted their heads in confusion. They couldn\u2019t understand why they needed these stones in order to train their swordsmanship. Meanwhile, Jin didn\u2019t show his emotions, but he was curious to know how they\u2019d end up using these Clear Stones.Zed slowly unsheathed the sword attached to his waist and placed it against the Clear Stone.\u201cI will swing my blade down onto this ball a total of three times. Try comparing the sounds that are created.\u201dThe first swing. Zed didn\u2019t put much force behind his sword and simply lowered his blade onto the ball lightly.Thoomp\u2026A rather thick and murky sound echoed in the room. It felt as if one would feel nauseous by listening to it for an extended period of time.\u201cNot a pleasant sound, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSoon enough, Zed striked the ball again. This time, his swing contained far more strength and speed than before.Claaang!This time, a pure and elegant sound worthy of the Clear Stone\u2019s name resonated in the room. It felt like the sound entered their ears and soothed their entire bodies from the inside.\u201cOooh!\u201dThe twins exclaimed simultaneously. Jin\u2019s eyes also widened as he stared at the Clear Stone.\u201cHm, it\u2019s also quite pleasant for me to listen to. It\u2019s been a while since I last heard this sound. As you have seen, the Clear Stone emits a thick and murky sound when you hit it weakly, but creates a beautiful sound when hit with the perfect amount of strength.\u201dIt was a simple principle.But Jin was concerned about how Zed didn\u2019t tell them what this \u2018perfect amount of strength\u2019 was exactly. Thus, he soon realized the purpose behind this training method.\u2018The goal of this exercise is to create that beautiful sound every single time you strike the Clear Stone.\u2019Striking it with the perfect amount of force and speed once would be easy to achieve. But after observing Zed\u2019s behaviour, it seemed that achieving it every single time was a much harder exercise.They would have to strike the ball countless times until they found the perfect strength. However, the boys would most likely be distracted by the unpleasant sounds created by their imperfect strikes every time.Even so, just because their concentration had been disturbed didn\u2019t mean they could abandon this exercise. In other words, this exercise was also to train their willpower and mental strength.\u2018But why did he say he\u2019d strike it three times?\u2019The first and second swings were to show the importance of fine control over one\u2019s strength.The third swing would most probably be for the same objective. Jin couldn\u2019t see another reason behind hitting the Clear Stone.\u2018We\u2019re doing this exercise since it fits the Runcandels\u2019 physical capabilities quite well. Uncle said that this training was simple and unsophisticated. However, there\u2019s far too few dangerous hazards in this exercise.\u2019The Runcandel-style swordsmanship was all about overpowering another and ruling by force. In other words, their techniques were powerful enough that it could potentially harm its user. Thus, there was no way the training exercise that was only accessible to pure-blooded Runcandels would be so safe and risk-free.\u2018There was definitely something shaking around inside the Clear Stones when I picked them up. It felt and sounded like some piece of metal\u2026\u2019Ah!Jin found the answer to his question as Zed raised his sword one last time. He then immediately grabbed the back of the Tona twins\u2019 necks standing on both of his sides and pushed.\u201cAnd now, the third strike.\u201d\u201cGet down!\u201dJin shouted as he shoved them forward. The surprised twins fell to the ground along with their little brother due to his strength.As soon as they touched the floor, the twins were about to hurl curses at Jin, but could only blink their eyes in shock as they watched the situation unfold.Booooom!With Zed\u2019s final swing, the Clear Stone exploded with a deafening roar.And from within it came hurling out dozens of steel marbles. They flew in all directions like arrows. An average person would\u2019ve easily died from being pierced by all these powerful projectiles.\u201cEh\u2026 Huh?\u201d\u201cWha\u2014!\u201dThe astonished twins stared at their surroundings. They felt their heart drop as the marbles rolled around on the ground.\u201cThe youngest has great instincts. These Clear Stones have been designed to explode if they sustain too great of an impact.\u201dZed spoke with a pleased smile on his face.Jin got up and dusted himself off. It seemed that his uncle wasn\u2019t in his right mind either. He had put his nephews in life-threatening danger without a word of warning beforehand.Was anyone in this clan actually sane?In any case, Jin began to ponder.\u2018Every Runcandel has gone through this training. Since most of my siblings have been taught by Uncle Zed as well, they somehow survived this hazardous demonstration.\u2019In Jin\u2019s case, he had survived the explosion by getting on the ground in time thanks to his instincts. The Tona twins had survived thanks to their brother.Then what about all the others?\u201cYou three are the first ones not to get injured during the Clear Stone\u2019s demonstration session since Luna. Other than her and you boys, all your other siblings were gravely wounded by the steel marbles. You can think of this as a rite of passage.\u201dAs they watched Zed laughing out loud, the Tona twins once again realized that their upcoming adventures in the intermediate class were full of pain, agony and struggles.Meanwhile, Jin felt proud by the fact that they were the first ones to be unscathed after Luna.\u201cUncle, may I ask you how Eldest Sister Luna avoided these steel projectiles?\u201d\u201cHm, you\u2019ll get upset if you hear about it. At least, all your other siblings got upset when they heard what she did.\u201d\u201cI do not mind.\u201d\u201cTechnically speaking, Luna couldn\u2019t avoid the marbles like you. In fact, none of your siblings managed to avoid them all. She just received them head-on, but didn\u2019t get injured. She was just that robust and strong\u2026\u201dJust as Zed had warned them, it was a somewhat disheartening story.Even so, Jin was quite satisfied. Had one of his siblings avoided all the pellets while being ignorant of the dangers of this demonstration, it would\u2019ve meant that they were more gifted and talented than Jin himself.\u201cIn any case, I assume that you three have understood the content of this exercise. From today onwards, you boys will spend your afternoons swinging your swords onto the steel balls every day. You\u2019ll only stop when you\u2019re able to strike the Clear Stones in any circumstances and successfully create a clear and beautiful sound each time.\u201d**Luna\u2019s room.The woman in question was spending a peaceful and relaxing time inside, sipping on a cup of tea with her nanny.\u2018It\u2019s about time the youngest starts to show some results from our Mind\u2019s Eye training sessions. It\u2019ll hurt if he gets hit by the Clear Stone\u2019s projectiles, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll manage to do something about it. It\u2019s so gratifying to watch him grow up and get stronger.\u2019Siiip.\u201cLady Luna.\u201d\u201cYes, Nanny?\u201d\u201cI believe that Lady Anne and Myu are quite suspicious. There is the incident where they tried to keep Young Master Jin in check to take into account.\u201dThe two of them were conversing about the potential suspects behind the \u2018assassination attempt\u2019 on Jin when he was merely a year old.There has already been an assassination attempt against me. I\u2019ve never talked about it to anyone else. Not even Gilly. And due to that incident, my fight has already begun.Ever since Luna first heard Jin\u2019s words when she visited him at the Storm Castle, she has been searching for the culprit to this day. She hadn\u2019t given up even after five whole years.It was because she greatly cared about her youngest brother, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason.It was a long-established and traditional taboo within the clan for a pure-blooded Runcandel residing in the main house to aim for the life of a family member that had yet to leave the Storm Castle.If Luna informed Cyron about this incident, it would cause great chaos within the clan. However, she judged that doing so wouldn\u2019t benefit Jin, so Luna decided against reporting to her father.Moreover, they had no evidence to show Cyron about this attempted assassination.\u201cHm, it\u2019s true that those two are very domineering and tend to step over their boundaries, but I don\u2019t think so. Would they be crazy enough to attempt to assassinate someone inside the Storm Castle?\u201dTechnically speaking, Jin hadn\u2019t been the target of an assassination attempt, but rather the target of the \u2018Bladed Illusion\u2019 curse. However, Luna wasn\u2019t aware of this truth yet.\u201cTo be truthful, I believe that there\u2019s the possibility of Young Master Jin having lied to you. He was only 10 years old back then, so isn\u2019t it highly likely? We haven\u2019t found out anything after all these years.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think Jin lied to me. Back then, he was wary of me. Not because he found it awkward to interact with me for the first time ever, but because he was on guard. His gaze\u2026 It was the gaze of someone whose life was being threatened.\u201d\u201cThen should we investigate Lady Myu and Anne for the time being?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll leave it in your care. I\u2019m more concerned by the fact that we haven\u2019t discovered anything so far. Something\u2019s wrong\u2026 I have an ominous presentiment.\u201d\u201cI feel the same way. But I\u2019m more concerned for you, Lady Luna. I\u2019m worried your siblings will break your heart again.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m already in my thirties, Nanny.\u201dLuna hid her bitter smile with her teacup.***And so, a day went by.Jin and the Tona twins had yet to create a beautiful sound by striking the Clear Stones. Fortunately, there were still no incidents where someone accidentally burst the steel balls.Thooomp\u2026!Thuud\u2026!The unpleasant noises have been echoing inside the hidden training room for four hours straight.\u2018I can declare with certainty that amongst all the training I\u2019ve done in my life, this is by far the nastiest.\u2019These abominable sounds had been disturbing his concentration. The twins had already vomited on the ground a couple of times. In the meantime, Jin was sweating buckets, but somehow managed not to let go of his sword and drop to the ground.In the morning, he had experienced the intermediate class\u2019s hellish training, and in the afternoon, he was constantly hitting the Clear Stones; Jin was on the verge of death. He couldn\u2019t get used to these unpleasant sounds and echoes no matter how hard he tried to.\u201cTake a five-minute break.\u201dAs soon as the words left Zed\u2019s mouth, the three boys sat cross-legged on the floor. However, the Tona twins\u2019 posture was terrible as they were exhausted both mentally and physically.In fact, the five-minute break wasn\u2019t quite a \u2018break\u2019.According to Zed\u2019s training regime, the boys had to hold their swords straight and cover them in aura while sitting upright and maintain that position during the so-called \u2018break\u2019. So the break was, in other words, an exercise where they were training their aura.Jin\u2019s hands were trembling as they squeezed the sword\u2019s handle, whereas the Tona twins couldn\u2019t even hold onto theirs properly.While it was the nastiest training Jin had ever experienced, it wasn\u2019t the most difficult one.In his past life, Jin had trained several dozens of times more than others in order to become a 1-star knight by the age of 25. Compared to his despairing and miserable days back then, this exercise with the Clear Stones was somewhat bearable.\u2018The purpose of this training was to increase our aura\u2019s destructive power in the first place.\u2019Zed had destroyed the Clear Stone without using any aura, but that was only possible because he was an 8-star knight. The three boys first had to train and develop their auras in order to strike the Clear Stones with enough force to make a beautiful sound, let alone make them explode.\u201cDaytona, Haytona. Sit straight. If you can\u2019t endure this, you won\u2019t be able to survive within the clan.\u201dAs Zed spoke calmly, the twins fixed their postures with tears in their eyes. It was tear-jerkingly difficult for them, but Jin knew that they would successfully become flag-bearers of the clan thanks to his past life\u2019s knowledge.\u2018Even my stupid brothers managed to become flag-bearers in the past, so there\u2019s no way I won\u2019t be able to do it.\u2019Therefore, there was no need for Jin to feel impatient.The boy closed his eyes and focused his senses on the aura covering his sword.Thooomp, Thooooomp.Even though he could hear the residual auditory hallucinations from the echoes earlier, Jin kept his eyes closed and concentrated. He was quite good at erasing all distracting thoughts and keeping his eyes closed.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018I noticed it the first day as well, but that kid\u2026 he\u2019s quite something. The Tona twins aren\u2019t doing so badly either, but this one\u2026 He might even break Luna\u2019s record.\u2019Zed praised Jin in his mind but didn\u2019t express it out loud.He could always praise the boy when he broke Luna\u2019s record.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34 \u2013 Fight, Win, Enjoy (4)________The Clear Stone training session only ended at 9 PM, after the Tona twins collapsed side by side.They had completely exhausted their physical and mental strength that they ended up falling unconscious.\u201cPathetic.\u201dZed clicked his tongue and called the medical team. Meanwhile, Jin didn\u2019t fully agree with his uncle\u2019s statement.\u2018It\u2019s quite impressive they\u2019ve lasted this long in the first place.\u2019Jin was still standing on both feet. His legs were trembling like crazy and the unpleasant ringing was still echoing in his mind, but he was standing.The attitude and dedication the twins had shown today were praiseworthy. In all honesty, even Jin was on the verge of collapsing. If the training had continued for another thirty minutes, he would\u2019ve surely flopped onto the ground.The medical team placed the twins on stretchers and took them out.\u201cMake sure you tell your brothers that if they plan on fainting during tomorrow\u2019s training as well, they shouldn\u2019t come to class in the first place.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dJin exited the hidden training room and pondered to himself as he walked back to his dorm.\u2018Seeing Uncle\u2019s reaction, I was close to disappointing him as well. Had the training been slightly longer, I would\u2019ve fainted. And Uncle would\u2019ve considered me a failure as well\u2026 I should be more careful tomorrow.\u2019However, Zed was having different thoughts than what Jin was predicting. He stayed behind in the hidden room, staring at the spots where his three nephews had been standing until moments ago.\u2018The Tona twins ended up collapsing far later than what I was initially expecting. Kekek, they\u2019re Runcandels alright. But the youngest\u2026\u2019Despite being two years younger than the twins, he had managed to endure the training today without falling unconscious. It was an incredible feat, considering his body hadn\u2019t developed as much as theirs.\u2018A shame. Such a shame! Why did he have to be born as the youngest?!\u2019According to what Zed had witnessed today, Jin was the most talented child amongst Cyron\u2019s 13 children. While it was debatable whether or not he was better than Luna, he was far more gifted than Joshua, the soon-to-be patriarch.However, he was too young.Jin was only 15 years old.Even if he trained seriously and became a 9-star knight by the age of 30, Joshua would already be leading the clan by then.These days,\u00a0 the patriarch\u2019s authority and power were slowly beginning to be transferred over to Joshua already. Very slowly, but steadily.\u2018If only he were born ten years earlier, he would\u2019ve had the Runcandel Clan in his grasp\u2026!\u2019Currently, Jin\u2019s talents and growth speed were\u2026 seeds that would sow chaos and havoc in the clan.If Jin were to become the strongest person in the clan in ten or fifteen years and aimed for the throne\u2026 how much damage would he cause to Joshua\u2019s rule? To the Runcandel Clan?And what if the clan\u2019s enemies\u2014such as the Zipfels\u2014took advantage of the inner conflict to attack the clan?As his thoughts reached that conclusion, Zed let out a deep sigh.\u2018Let\u2019s keep watch for now. Seeing how Luna cares for him, Jin might grow up to resemble her. He might become a Shadow that protects the clan just like that child.\u2019Countless variables that could affect Jin\u2019s \u2018future\u2019 and \u2018growth\u2019 existed. The boy could die during a mission or could suddenly decide to leave the clan one day and become a wanderer.Children go through many different experiences and incidents as they grow up, so Zed couldn\u2019t predict Jin and the clan\u2019s future as of yet.March 1795. A month had gone by.Jin and the Tona twins were in open warfare for hegemony from day one, but since they were stuck in the Clear Stone training room the entire afternoon, there were no real fights between them.Ever since Kajin Romello was cut down by Jin, the other cadets didn\u2019t dare lay a finger on the Youngest Division even when the young master was away. They had also been ordered by Myu and Anne not to do so.Jin\u2019s two older sisters had decided not to interfere with the happenings within the intermediate training class, just as he had predicted.They had no more expectations for the Tona twins. The idiots had borrowed their best intermediate-class cadet and had returned him defective, so they had no reason to support the twins anymore.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s so peaceful that it\u2019s concerning.\u201dMesa spoke as she dusted the dirt off her clothes, which were in terrible condition as they had just finished their morning training session. The cadets around her were in the same condition as her.\u201cDo you think the young master is doing okay in the afternoons? We don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re being taught.\u201dBellop asked with a worried tone, but Mesa snorted.\u201cWe aren\u2019t at the level where we can worry about the young master.\u201d\u201cBut from time to time, I hear explosions inside the hidden training room along with people screaming\u2026 The medical team always seems to be in a hurry to head inside when that happens. The Tona young masters were even brought out on stretchers before the training session had ended two days ago.\u201d\u201cStop worrying and focus on your own training. Don\u2019t you remember what the young master told us? We\u2019ll be assigned missions soon enough. Disgustingly difficult missions, according to the young master.\u201dExcept for Mesa, Scott, Zhushen, Taimont and Kiko, the other members of the Youngest Division didn\u2019t reach the average level of intermediate-class cadets.In other words, Edington, Sierra, Phils and Bellop weren\u2019t supposed to be sent out on missions yet. Well, technically speaking, Bellop was skilled enough. He just hadn\u2019t recovered a good enough mental strength yet in order to utilize his abilities to the maximum.\u201cI do not wish to be a hindrance to the young master from now on. So we should focus on our own problems right now. We all need to reach 3-star at the very least before we\u2019re given our first missions.\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s right. And it\u2019s thanks to Young Master Jin that we\u2019re not being harassed or persecuted during this faction war.\u201dThe cadets nodded with resolute expressions.\u201cAttention!\u201dThe intermediate training class\u2019s assistant instructor, \u2018Mael Trasil\u2019, yelled out loud. There were a total of three assistant instructors in the intermediate class, and they were all guardian knights of the Runcandel Clan. Mael was the main assistant instructor.\u201cThe first missions of this year\u2019s intermediate class have been issued. There are a total of five missions. I will now call out names. The cadets who have their names called must step forward. There are a total of 60 cadets who will be dispatched this time.\u201dThe cadets who had spent several years in the intermediate class didn\u2019t show any particular reactions. However, those who were in their 3rd year or less were showing tense expressions.\u201cThe first is a monster subjugation mission. The subjugation targets are goblins. You shall hear the details of the mission from Petro, the second butler. The cadets involved are Denkello, Atan, John\u2026\u201d\u201cThe second is a bodyguard mission. The commissioners that need protection are the rookies within the Minche Smithy Association. It would be beneficial to some of you if you get friendly with them. Those involved are Houston, Bading\u2026\u201d\u201cThe third mission is another monster subjugation. The targets are orcs this time. The area of operations is an unprotected zone as well. The cadets involved are, um\u2026\u201dMael\u2019s hands stopped once he flipped the page. He frowned before making sure he had read the names right on the document.\u2018The area of operations is an unprotected area, but all the cadets are newcomers\u2026 Young Master Jin will be displeased by this. It\u2019ll be difficult for everyone to return alive. But it\u2019s not like we can complain to the flag-bearers.\u2019Mael coughed awkwardly before finishing his sentence.\u201cMesa, Scott, Taimont, Kiko, Zhushen, Edington, Sierra, Phils, and David. Petro will inform you about the details as well. I bid you all godspeed\u2026\u201dA ruckus began amongst the intermediate cadets. Not only were the targets orcs, but they were to enter an unprotected zone. Half or more of the Youngest Division would certainly die during this mission.However, there wasn\u2019t a single word of protest addressed to the assistant instructors.Since the flag-bearers had chosen this lineup, they had no say in this. If someone were to object to this, it had to be the faction\u2019s leader, Jin himself.If Jin were to go find the flag-bearers personally in order to complain, he could easily change the members of the 3rd mission. He could either make a deal or make use of Luna\u2019s authority and influence.However, that would end up biting him back later on.He would be publicly admitting that his faction\u2019s members weren\u2019t skilled enough to be sent on official missions. And if he made use of Luna\u2019s authority, Jin would be proving that he himself had no power or qualifications.In this case, Jin would checkmate himself. Thus, the Youngest Division had no choice but to go along with it and carry out the mission.\u201cInstructor, what are the 4th and 5th missions?\u201d\u201cThose were assigned to the young masters. You need not concern yourselves. Dismissed! Once you\u2019ve had lunch, the cadets who were assigned missions may take a break from class until they depart. You will be dispatched in two days.\u201dOnce the assistant instructors made their leave, a commotion began within the cadets.\u201cDamn, good luck to those kids.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s gonna be at least four or five deaths\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would\u2019ve been better for them to not be a part of any faction.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I say so? If you join the wrong faction, you\u2019ll only see a sea of blood.\u201d\u201cThe poor kids.\u201dThe cadets who were part of Myu and Anne\u2019s faction, like Kajin, all wore suspicious grins as they nodded between themselves.\u201cWe\u2019ll have to prepare some coffins. Kekek.\u201d\u201cWe should have a proper funeral for them. Since they have two days left, let\u2019s have someone paint their portraits in advance. Oh, and they shouldn\u2019t forget to write a will.\u201d\u201cBwahaha! Have a good trip, you cutie-pies! Otherwise, you could ask Young Master Jin for some help. \u2018Please save us! Please save us!\u2019 Kekekek.\u201dThe cadets in Myu and Anne\u2019s faction giggled between themselves as they stared at the Youngest Division. Taimont was about to stand up and face them, but Mesa grabbed him by the shoulder and held him back.\u201cEndure it. We still can\u2019t win against them, and starting a fight right before we leave on a mission will do us no good.\u201d\u201cBut those bastards were\u2026!\u201d\u201cShut up and sit down, Taimont. You don\u2019t want to cause problems for the young master, do you? Do I really have to spell it out to you?\u201dA fuming Taimont sat back down.\u201c\u2026What do we do?\u201dSierra sighed deeply. The other members of the Youngest Division were also wearing distressed expressions.\u201cIs that a question? This is the Runcandel Clan. If they want us to go out and fight, we go and fight. We\u2019ll do whatever we can to accomplish the mission successfully and return alive. That\u2019s the one and only way we can trample on those bastards\u2019 pride and humiliate them.\u201dMesa spoke as she ground her teeth. Despite her confident front, her hands were trembling lightly.No, she wasn\u2019t afraid of death. She was simply disappointed in herself that she could only be a hindrance to Young Master Jin and cause him problems.***Boooom!\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cHaytona!\u201d\u201cUrgh!\u201dHaytona\u2019s Clear Stone had exploded. This was already his third stone today. The steel marbles grazed Daytona and headed towards Jin, who was concentrating on his own sword and steel ball.Haytona was hit in the chest, and Jin in the flank. Had it been his own steel ball exploding, Jin would have avoided the projectiles. But someone else\u2019s ball exploding and marbles flying at him from the side? Even that was unavoidable for him.Zed was sitting in the corner, calmly reading the mission documents as if he didn\u2019t care what was happening to them.\u201cUrgh, fuck!\u201d\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m fine, Daytona. Um\u2026 sorry, Jin. Uh, I didn\u2019t do that on purpose\u2026\u201dHaytona fearfully approached Jin. Daytona followed suit as he scratched the back of his head.As he watched their actions, Jin began to wonder if they were truly the same Nefarious Homicidal Maniacs from his first life.\u201cI\u2019m fine. But from now on, I want you two to practice in that corner over there.\u201d\u201cS-Sure.\u201dThe Tona twins grunted as they pushed their tables towards the corner.There was a reason why the twins were so obedient to their little brother. After having spent time training together for an entire month, they soon realized that their uncle\u2019s words were correct.Do not confront the youngest until you two are strong enough. That is, if you wish to live long.The Jin they had witnessed so far was a beast. Today, the Tona twins had finally gained enough strength to make the Clear Stones blow up three to four times per session. However, Jin had already been blowing the Stones up since a couple of days ago, creating five to six explosions every session.\u2018Today, I will definitely create a clear sound. Definitely.\u2019His flank was throbbing from the pain. He didn\u2019t feel his ribs cracking, so he was physically fine. However, his breath was completely erratic now.Phew\u2026 Phew\u2026Jin closed his eyes and regulated his breathing. He could subconsciously see the Clear Stone\u2019s surface, its rigidity, and its weight in his mind, despite the darkness.As the pain in his flank kept disturbing his focus, Jin felt a sudden change.\u2018Huh?\u2019A strange sensation overtook his senses. For some reason, he could precisely see the direction the steel marble had flown to hit him despite his closed eyes. It was being drawn in his mind.\u2018What is this? Why do I suddenly feel like\u2026\u2019As he was about to open his eyes and verify the marble\u2019s actual trajectory, Zed suddenly stood up. Jin and the Tona twins immediately ran before him and corrected their stances.\u201cThe details of your missions have been delivered.\u201dChapter 34 \u2013 Fight, Win, Enjoy (4)________The Clear Stone training session only ended at 9 PM, after the Tona twins collapsed side by side.They had completely exhausted their physical and mental strength that they ended up falling unconscious.\u201cPathetic.\u201dZed clicked his tongue and called the medical team. Meanwhile, Jin didn\u2019t fully agree with his uncle\u2019s statement.\u2018It\u2019s quite impressive they\u2019ve lasted this long in the first place.\u2019Jin was still standing on both feet. His legs were trembling like crazy and the unpleasant ringing was still echoing in his mind, but he was standing.The attitude and dedication the twins had shown today were praiseworthy. In all honesty, even Jin was on the verge of collapsing. If the training had continued for another thirty minutes, he would\u2019ve surely flopped onto the ground.The medical team placed the twins on stretchers and took them out.\u201cMake sure you tell your brothers that if they plan on fainting during tomorrow\u2019s training as well, they shouldn\u2019t come to class in the first place.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dJin exited the hidden training room and pondered to himself as he walked back to his dorm.\u2018Seeing Uncle\u2019s reaction, I was close to disappointing him as well. Had the training been slightly longer, I would\u2019ve fainted. And Uncle would\u2019ve considered me a failure as well\u2026 I should be more careful tomorrow.\u2019However, Zed was having different thoughts than what Jin was predicting. He stayed behind in the hidden room, staring at the spots where his three nephews had been standing until moments ago.\u2018The Tona twins ended up collapsing far later than what I was initially expecting. Kekek, they\u2019re Runcandels alright. But the youngest\u2026\u2019Despite being two years younger than the twins, he had managed to endure the training today without falling unconscious. It was an incredible feat, considering his body hadn\u2019t developed as much as theirs.\u2018A shame. Such a shame! Why did he have to be born as the youngest?!\u2019According to what Zed had witnessed today, Jin was the most talented child amongst Cyron\u2019s 13 children. While it was debatable whether or not he was better than Luna, he was far more gifted than Joshua, the soon-to-be patriarch.However, he was too young.Jin was only 15 years old.Even if he trained seriously and became a 9-star knight by the age of 30, Joshua would already be leading the clan by then.These days,\u00a0 the patriarch\u2019s authority and power were slowly beginning to be transferred over to Joshua already. Very slowly, but steadily.\u2018If only he were born ten years earlier, he would\u2019ve had the Runcandel Clan in his grasp\u2026!\u2019Currently, Jin\u2019s talents and growth speed were\u2026 seeds that would sow chaos and havoc in the clan.If Jin were to become the strongest person in the clan in ten or fifteen years and aimed for the throne\u2026 how much damage would he cause to Joshua\u2019s rule? To the Runcandel Clan?And what if the clan\u2019s enemies\u2014such as the Zipfels\u2014took advantage of the inner conflict to attack the clan?As his thoughts reached that conclusion, Zed let out a deep sigh.\u2018Let\u2019s keep watch for now. Seeing how Luna cares for him, Jin might grow up to resemble her. He might become a Shadow that protects the clan just like that child.\u2019Countless variables that could affect Jin\u2019s \u2018future\u2019 and \u2018growth\u2019 existed. The boy could die during a mission or could suddenly decide to leave the clan one day and become a wanderer.Children go through many different experiences and incidents as they grow up, so Zed couldn\u2019t predict Jin and the clan\u2019s future as of yet.March 1795. A month had gone by.Jin and the Tona twins were in open warfare for hegemony from day one, but since they were stuck in the Clear Stone training room the entire afternoon, there were no real fights between them.Ever since Kajin Romello was cut down by Jin, the other cadets didn\u2019t dare lay a finger on the Youngest Division even when the young master was away. They had also been ordered by Myu and Anne not to do so.Jin\u2019s two older sisters had decided not to interfere with the happenings within the intermediate training class, just as he had predicted.They had no more expectations for the Tona twins. The idiots had borrowed their best intermediate-class cadet and had returned him defective, so they had no reason to support the twins anymore.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s so peaceful that it\u2019s concerning.\u201dMesa spoke as she dusted the dirt off her clothes, which were in terrible condition as they had just finished their morning training session. The cadets around her were in the same condition as her.\u201cDo you think the young master is doing okay in the afternoons? We don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re being taught.\u201dBellop asked with a worried tone, but Mesa snorted.\u201cWe aren\u2019t at the level where we can worry about the young master.\u201d\u201cBut from time to time, I hear explosions inside the hidden training room along with people screaming\u2026 The medical team always seems to be in a hurry to head inside when that happens.

    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35 \u2013 Receiving His First Solo MissionThe Tona twins\u2019 mission was to attend a ceremony.They were being ordered to attend several events and parties organized by the Vermont emperor and the empire\u2019s dukes to curry favours with them.In truth, calling this invitation to parties a \u2018mission\u2019 was an embarrassment. There was absolutely no risk of them seeing any blood or conflict during this mission. All they had to do was eat the excellent dishes prepared at the parties and have fun in the empire.\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cA ceremony?! In the Vermont Empire at that\u2026\u201dHowever, the Tona twins\u2019 faces crumpled once they heard the details of their mission.\u2018Attending ceremonies\u2019 was a type of mission that was only assigned to direct members of the Runcandel lineage.The clan could ignore invitations and the like from your average nation, but the empire\u2019s invitation was a different story. The Runcandels couldn\u2019t refuse them so easily.Thus, one of the Runcandel children had to accept the invitation and attend the events.So whenever an invitation arrived from the Vermont Empire, the Runcandel children prayed to avoid being chosen.None of them wanted to attend those sickening and boring parties.\u201cMy condolences, boys. Thanks to your sacrifices, your siblings won\u2019t have to go to the empire and dance around aimlessly.\u201d\u201cHaaaa\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that a sigh I hear? Although it\u2019s an invitation to parties, this is a bona fide mission. If you show this sort of attitude again, I\u2019ll beat you two up so badly you\u2019ll beg me to kill you.\u201dThe Tona twins nodded as they hid away their disgusted expressions.This mission was more or less a \u2018punishment\u2019 for them. Their elder sisters were punishing them, as they had failed to trample on their youngest sibling even after borrowing a 5-star cadet from their faction.Attending parties was a drudgery for the twins, as they didn\u2019t have an ounce of oratory skills and hadn\u2019t learnt the subtle art of surviving in social situations.\u2018Geez, Elder Sister Myu and Anne are so ill-natured.\u2019Jin laughed to himself.\u201cIt\u2019s a mission someone has to accomplish. And when you arrive on site, you will see dozens of powerful people, whether it be in their combat prowess or their authority and influence. Make sure you observe them carefully.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Uncle\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd you, Jin.\u201d\u201cYes, Uncle.\u201d\u201cThe mission you\u2019ve been assigned is\u2026\u201dZed stopped halfway through the sentence. The Tona twins paid close attention to his next words.They were curious to know how crazy of a mission their sisters had assigned to their youngest sibling.Hopefully, it was something that would break Jin physically and mentally. In fact, the best case scenario would be that Jin wouldn\u2019t return at all from the mission.\u201cAn assassination task. Your target is the Master of the Hidden Palace Talaris\u2019s plaything. Hm\u2026 You basically need to kill a loafer.\u201dThe Master of the Hidden Palace.That is the title given to the owner of the \u2018Hidden Palace\u2019, an enormous tower standing in the middle of the west sea. The 51st master is Talaris, nicknamed the \u2018Abyssal Spider\u2019.The Hidden Palace is an independent force that is influenced by neither the Runcandels nor the Zipfels.\u201cUncle, by \u2018plaything\u2019, you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Abyssal Spider\u2019s plaything? It\u2019s that woman\u2019s lover.\u201dJin\u2019s assassination target was the master\u2019s plaything.In other words, her paramour. Jin had to kill one of the countless young men Talaris was playing around with.\u201cOh snap.\u201dThe Tona twins unintentionally let out words of shock.They didn\u2019t believe that Jin would be able to kill the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s lover and return alive.Talaris\u2019s notoriety was known around the world, even to the country bumpkins living in some corner of the Mitel Kingdom. She was especially known for being merciless to the people who laid a finger on her lovers.\u201cYour target is currently residing in the lawless zone of Mamit under the protection of members of the Hidden Palace.\u201d\u201cMamit?!\u201d\u201cHoly smokes!\u201dThe twins exclaimed out loud once again.Missions in the Mamit Lawless Zone were generally assigned to guardian knights. It wasn\u2019t a mission that a mere intermediate-class cadet like Jin was supposed to undertake.Killing the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s lover in Mamit.You could easily summarize the mission with that sentence. The Tona twins already believed that Jin would never return alive from this mission.\u201cThere is one question I\u2019d like to ask, Uncle.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWho is our client?\u201dAs Jin asked in a confident tone, Zed\u2019s lips rose into a soft smirk.\u2018This kid\u2026 He should know who the Master of the Hidden Palace and where Mamit is, but he\u2019s going to accept the mission immediately? If he claimed the mission was irrational, I would\u2019ve been willing to go say a word to the flag-bearers myself.\u2019Zed was somewhat hoping Jin would be shocked and vexed.Recently, the elder\u2019s greatest enjoyment was watching his youngest nephew grow. Even the unsympathetic Zed didn\u2019t appreciate sending a yet-to-be-fully-forged sword on a dangerous mission like this where it would most certainly break.However, Jin didn\u2019t show an ounce of shock or vexation.Since the cadet in question was planning on accepting the mission, Zed had no reason to intervene.\u201cThe Tzendler Clan. Your target\u2014the loafer\u2014is called Alkaro Tzendler, the disgrace of the clan.\u201d\u201cI see now. They\u2019re worried that the child who left the clan will spill the clan\u2019s secrets to the Master of the Hidden Palace.\u201d\u201cExactly. It seems the Tzendler Clan tried to solve this issue on their own, but gave up and came to us instead. Looks like the child in question doesn\u2019t have a good reputation in the first place\u2026 Hm, can you do it?\u201dZed asked with great anticipation.He was deeply hoping the words \u2018this mission should be assigned to guardian knights instead\u2019 would leave Jin\u2019s mouth.\u201cI will do it.\u201d\u201cWhy are you so\u2026 No, nevermind.\u00a0Haaa, it\u2019s good to be decisive.\u201dZed coughed awkwardly before handing over the documents to his nephews.\u201cYou will all depart in two days. You are excused from the afternoon training sessions until then. In the meantime, make sure to train on your own, but only to the extent that it doesn\u2019t hinder your mission.\u201d\u201cYes, Uncle.\u201dZed exited the hidden training room first.The Tona twins stood around Jin awkwardly for a while.While they felt ecstatic by the fact that their brother was about to die, they were also disgruntled by it, as if there was a bitter taste in their mouths. The twins didn\u2019t know that they had a strong bond of love and hatred with their little brother.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo, um\u2026 Good luck. Come back safely\u201d\u201cYeah. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re gonna die, right? If something goes wrong, just reveal that you\u2019re a Runcandel! Then no one will be able to lay a finger on you.\u201d\u201cHaha, geez. Are you worried about me? I didn\u2019t know you two had such adorable sides to you.\u201d\u201cW-We\u2019re not worried! We\u2014\u201d\u201cBefore I return\u2026\u201dJin interrupted Daytona and unsheathed Bradamante, covering it in aura. The twins froze as their brother had suddenly pulled out his weapon.Swoosh!Before they could even ask what he was doing, Jin swung his sword, aiming it at the Clear Stone sitting behind them.Claaaang\u2014!A beautiful metallic sound resonated, bouncing off the arched ceiling and echoing in the room.Jin smiled in satisfaction.He had suddenly felt like he would definitely succeed if he struck the Clear Stone right now, and that feeling turned into reality within a few instants.One month had passed since they began training with the Clear Stones.Jin had no idea how inconceivable this record was.\u201cYou two should make a choice, Elder Brothers. Whether you prefer our elder sisters\u2026 or me.\u201dThe Tona twins gulped audibly before clumsily nodding.Jin then exited the room, leaving the two of them behind in silence.\u201c\u2026What do we do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Elder Sisters are out of their minds, while our younger brother is not in his right mind. Seriously\u2026 But I think that the youngest is scarier than Elder Sisters\u2026\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dThe twins sighed in dejection.Having made his way outside, Jin wasn\u2019t concerned about his mission. Rather than the dangerous task, his mind was far more interested in another topic.\u2018What was that sensation earlier?\u2019The steel marble that had come flying out of the Clear Stone Haytona had blown up.After getting hit by it, Jin suddenly pictured the marble\u2019s detailed trajectory in his mind for no reason. It also felt like if another marble came hurling at him from the same direction, he would be able to avoid it.\u2018I should ask Elder Sister Luna about this once I return from my mission. This sensation might be related to the training I had been doing with her.\u2019Two days went by in a flash.Those who had been assigned a mission had finished their preparations yesterday. All that was left to do was to go to the Huphester Transfer Gate and teleport to their respective destinations.\u201cPhew\u2026\u00a0Young Master.\u201dBefore he got on the steel carriage, the members of the Youngest Division called out to him.They were all wearing somber expressions, as if they were a herd of cows being led to a slaughterhouse. No one could guess how many of them would die in their upcoming mission.However, that wasn\u2019t the only reason they were dejected.\u201cWe heard you\u2019re going to the Mamit Lawless Zone.\u201d\u201cIndeed. I need to go to the transfer gate separately since I was tasked with an assassination mission. I also need to go through all the administrative procedures properly. How annoying.\u201d\u201c\u2026We\u2019ve come to bid you farewell before departing.\u201dThe reason why the Youngest Division had come to salute him was quite obvious.This could be the final time they would see the young master. Not only was it likely that some of them would die during their mission in the unprotected area, Young Master Jin himself was tasked with a mission in which he had an 80% chance of dying.Other than Jin, everyone else in the intermediate class thought he was headed to his death.\u201cNo need to. Why, do you think we\u2019ll never see each other again?\u201dJin said in a playful tone, to which Mesa sighed deeply. The other cadets couldn\u2019t even lift their heads up properly to face the young master.\u201cWell, it\u2019s true that life doesn\u2019t always go the way one expects it to. Some of us may die on our mission if we\u2019re ill-fortuned.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be okay. But the mission you were assigned is\u2026\u201d\u201cGeez, no need to worry about me, you brats. Focus on your own mission only, alright?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cGet going, then. We\u2019ll see each other when we\u2019re back.\u201dThe Youngest Division hesitantly stood around before going down the corridor.\u201cSuch endearing kids. Keep them safe, Murakan.\u201d\u201cMeow~\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve said this already, but make sure you don\u2019t get seen, alright?\u201d\u201cMeooow~\u201dThe black cat raised its front paw and waved it, as if he were saying \u2018worry more about yourself, kid\u2019.\u201cI\u2019ll be lonely for a while since both of you are leaving, Young Master, Lord Murakan.\u201d\u201cThink of it as a break, Gilly. Do you want some souvenirs from Mamit?\u201d\u201cI know that you\u2019re stronger than intermediate-class cadets, Young Master, but please be careful. Mamit is a dangerous place. To think that you have to assassinate the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s paramour\u2026 Please take good care of yourself.\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019ll see you soon!\u201dJin didn\u2019t get on the steel carriage, but rather on horseback. He had already dyed his hair brown yesterday and was currently dressed like an ordinary traveler.The boy had Bradamante with him, but he had covered the blade in a layer of metallic coating to conceal its normal colour. With such a disguise, no one would ever think of him as a Runcandel.This was his second mission, but his first solo mission.As Gilly had stated, the current Jin was quite a force to be reckoned with if you took all his abilities into account. Even so, the mission was a dangerous one where he could lose his life.Nevertheless, Jin was fearless. In fact, he was excited about how he\u2019d be able to use spiritual power and magic as much as possible.\u2018I\u2019ve always wanted to visit Mamit since my past life.\u2019Before his regression, Jin\u2019s magic teacher had mentioned that Mamit was more of a \u2018romantic city\u2019 than he had expected.Having spent two years in Mamit, his master would tell fond stories about the city. Within those stories were countless details about the city and its populace.\u2018I remember Master saying that the pubs in the center of the city are locations where informers and spies often go. And if I want to buy high-class information, I need to head to the underground black market\u2026\u2019To think that his master\u2019s boring stories would come in handy like this. Of course, there was a difference in time period, so some of the information may be inaccurate for now. But the system and order within the city was unlikely to have changed.With a feeling of gratitude towards his master in his heart, Jin pulled on the horse\u2019s reins and began his journey.A refreshing sense of liberty rushed through him as he departed the Garden of Swords on his own.Chapter 35 \u2013 Receiving His First Solo MissionPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36 \u2013 Mamit Lawless Zone (1)The Mamit Lawless Zone was a region where all kinds of criminals and offenders gathered.There were even rumours around the world that due to the evil energy these lawbreakers emitted, this criminal-infested land was so desolate that no plants could grow on it.But it was no rumour. Mamit was, in actual fact, a barren wasteland where not a single strand of grass grew.The scorching sun that glared down on the area.The criminals that crawled around in the small city like disgusting insects.There was no gateway to enter the city. There was only a broken signpost surrounded by rubbish. And once you walked past that signpost, you were inside Mamit.\u201cHere comes a newcomer, you sons of bitches!\u201dA hulking man shouted as he barged inside one of the pubs in the center of the city. He was carrying an equally large and terrifying iron mace on his back.\u201cBwahaha! Newcomer my ass. I bet you\u2019re back cuz you were put on the wanted list again. Freaking hell, are you a salmon or something? Stop coming back all the time, lmao!\u201dThe people inside the pub cheered joyfully as they all recognized the hulking man. Mocking someone until one loses their voice, pointing fingers, and throwing entire mugs of beer are Mamit\u2019s traditional yet peculiar ways of greeting others.Crash! Smash! Clang!The thick mugs smashed into the \u2018newcomer\u2019s head and chest. The glass fragments covered the floor along with a sea of beer. Nevertheless, the barman didn\u2019t even bother glancing at the mess, let alone clean it up.The hulking man that was hit by countless cups smiled delightfully and grabbed one of the glass shards on the floor.Crunch.Soon enough, a sight that one could normally only see in a circus occurred. The man chewed on the piece of glass and swallowed it.\u201cThat\u2019s right! I\u2019m a salmon. The Great Thonk\u2019s true birthplace is right here, in Mamit! Drink up, everyone! The drinks are on me today!\u201d\u201cGeez, Thonk. What did you do this time that you had to run away and come back here? C\u2019mon, speak up. Let\u2019s hear the story.\u201d\u201cKuhaha! I, the Great Thonk, had some fun with a high-class bitch in the Ekan Kingdom.\u201d\u201cOooh! Who was it?\u201d\u201cNo idea, just some girl from a noble family. And I killed the five guards who came to arrest me. Geez, do they seriously think they can capture me with ordinary guards? They kept sending them as well.\u201d\u201cKuhaha, those fucking morons.\u201d\u201cYep, yep. That\u2019s why I smashed them up like mashed potatoes. About fifty of them? While I was destroying them, I subconsciously headed towards Mamit, and found myself here before I realized it\u2026\u201d\u201cTo Thonk\u2019s massacre! Cheers!\u201d\u201cCheers! Welcome back home! It\u2019s good to see you again!\u201dGulp, gulp, gulp!The men were emptying their glasses.The rowdy craze calmed down as everyone was busy finishing their beers. But in the meantime\u2026Creaaak\u2026One boy entered the bar covered up in a tattered robe.It was Jin.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cLooks like there\u2019s a real newcomer this time.\u201dThonk and the other men exchanged glances, asking each other if anyone knew who this was. But everyone shook their heads.Thud, thud.A thick noise echoed every time Jin took a step with his old, ragged boots. He silently crossed the room and sat down next to Thonk.\u201cOne glass of cold water. And some simple snacks.\u201dJin took out one silver coin from his chest pocket and flicked it to the barman.\u201cHah.\u201dThe barman caught the coin and snorted as if he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Soon enough, the entire pub roared in laughter.\u201cKya!\u201d\u201cWow, I thought I was watching the protagonist of an action novel or something. Look at him. He\u2019s a natural at acting cool!\u201d\u201cSo? Who are you, hm? Some 9-star knight?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see? He\u2019s gotta be a legendary swordsman! Pfffft!\u201dThe men spouting sarcastic comments all simultaneously changed their expressions. They swiftly stood up and surrounded Jin with menacing grins and chuckles.\u201cHey, Mr. Newcomer. I, the Great Thonk, am in a good mood today. So let\u2019s not get on each others\u2019 nerves, alright? If you get on your knees and suck on everyone\u2019s toes right now, I will forgive y\u2014kurgh!\u201dThonk was interrupted before he could even finish his sentence. In fact, he would never be able to finish his sentence ever again because the tip of the dagger Jin had taken out was lodged in Thonk\u2019s neck.The hulking man was standing too close to Jin without keeping his guard up, so he didn\u2019t even have the time to react to the boy\u2019s attack. No one had expected this young brat to stab a giant like Thonk in the neck without a speck of hesitation.\u201cKeuk, grrr\u2026\u201dOnce Jin retracted his dagger, blood gushed out of Thonk\u2019s wound as he fell to the floor.A long moment of silence followed. No one uttered a single sound. Jin silently waved his finger at the barman, urging him to bring his cold water and snacks.\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\u201cThonk\u2019s gone!\u201d\u201cI knew this would happen one day, pffft.\u201dSoon enough, the men surrounding Jin scattered around.They behaved as if the friendly exchanges they had with Thonk until not long ago were a sham and returned to their respective tables, downing beer in their original groups.This was a common occurrence. No matter how friendly they acted with Thonk, there was no true friendship between them.\u2018Just as Master used to say, this place is filled with lunatics.\u2019The reason they had shown interest in Jin was because he appeared weak. They were curious to know why a boy\u2014who seemed to have yet to grow any hair down there\u2014had entered a den of criminals like it was nothing.However, their questions had found an answer.Jin killed Thonk with a dagger and, by doing so, gained the approval of the criminals inside the pub. This was how the residents of Mamit \u2018truly welcomed\u2019 a newcomer.\u2018I always seem to be in your debt. You\u2019ve been a great help to me, both in my past and present life. I hope the day comes when I get an opportunity to repay you, Master.\u2019Clack.The barman placed a glass cup on Jin\u2019s table. A cup of cold water.\u201cI didn\u2019t put in any poison.\u201d\u201cEven I know that killing people with poison is a taboo here.\u201d\u201cYou seem to know a great deal about Mamit despite your youth. Are your parents or siblings familiar with this place?\u201d\u201cNone of your business.\u201dCling.This time, Jin flicked a gold coin to the barman, who just shrugged in response.\u201cWhat do you want? Drugs? There\u2019s one product that\u2019s been the craze in Mamit recently. Or are you looking for someone?\u201d\u201cThe latter. Is that enough to cover the fee?\u201dThe barman rubbed the coin with a handkerchief and calmly weighed it with his hand. The substantial weight proved that it was a genuine gold coin.\u201cDepends on who you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\u201cIs there someone who goes by Hister in this area?\u201d\u201cNo. That, I\u2019m certain of.\u201dJin clicked his tongue as if he were disappointed.\u201cI see. Then just bring over my snacks. And if you could, recommend some inn to stay at tonight. Preferably a place without any bugs.\u201d\u2018A place without any bugs\u2019 signified the safest inn in Mamit.\u201cThen I know just the place. There\u2019s an inn called the Moonlit Well west of the city. The Kings of Mamit reside there, so no need to cause a fuss when you enter.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dJin emptied his plate of rough bread and dry bacon before leaving the pub.The atmosphere inside the \u2018Moonlit Well\u2019 was vastly different from the pub, since the most influential people of Mamit resided in it. It was surprisingly clean and orderly, just like an ordinary inn outside of Mamit.It wasn\u2019t comparable to a high-class inn in a big city. But at the very least, the clients wouldn\u2019t come across lowly criminals who behaved like wild dogs.\u2018Even if he\u2019s the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s lover, he\u2019s just the disgrace of the Tzendler Clan. This is the only place where Alkaro Tzendler could stay in the city.\u2019There was no real need to go down to the underground black market to buy more information on Alkaro.According to the documents and information sent by the Tzendler Clan to the Runcandels, Alkaro wasn\u2019t someone who would be willing to spend the night in a dirty and damp inn. He was a conceited rich brat who hadn\u2019t experienced any hardships in life.Alkaro Tzendler acts obedient to powerful people and overbearing to the weak. He only wants premium goods and services and is obsessed with hedonistic pleasures. The only qualities he has are his good looks and his lineage.There was only one reason why this fancy-pants was residing in this dangerous city.It was a superficial scheme trying to regain the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s attention, as she was recently engrossed in another paramour.A childish tantrum along the lines of \u2018will you really not show any attention to me when I\u2019m in such a dangerous place?\u2019But if the Master of the Hidden Palace genuinely paid attention to him and came to Mamit to check on Alkaro now, Jin wouldn\u2019t have another opportunity to kill him for a long time. If the Master herself protected Alkaro personally, even Luna wouldn\u2019t be able to assassinate him.That was why the Tzendler Clan had urgently commissioned the Runcandels using this opportunity.\u2018For now, rumours about me will spread around Mamit. Things like \u201csome kid killed Thonk as soon as he arrived, and he\u2019s looking for someone called Hister,\u201d should spread to everyone.\u2019Jin had wreaked havoc in the pub for a reason.After causing a ruckus in a location where low-ranking informants gathered, he had spread false information, saying that he was looking for Hister. That he had come this far in search of this specific person.And this rumour would reach the Hidden Palace bodyguards protecting Alkaro within the day. Jin had done this because the bodyguards were most likely checking every customer\u2019s identity.In consequence, Jin would naturally be excluded from their prioritized surveillance target. If someone were to come with the goal of assassinating Alkaro, they wouldn\u2019t suspect a boy like Jin who wasn\u2019t hiding his presence and clumsily trudging along in the city.\u2018The people who had come to assassinate Alkaro so far were all skilled, hired mercenaries. But since I look a lot sloppier, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll suspect me much.\u2019Alkaro\u2019s bodyguards wouldn\u2019t focus on people like Jin who had a clear objective.In fact, they would be more wary of someone like Thonk\u2014a criminal who was familiar with the city\u2014who recently returned to Mamit for no apparent reason.An assassin wants to blend in with the residents and mingle with them, trying not to attract attention. But with how Jin was doing it, he was standing out to be forgotten. As they say, it is darkest under the lamp.In fact, his strategy worked like magic.The men who were observing Jin inside the Moonlit Well during the day visibly let down their guards once night fell.\u2018It seems that those three are the Hidden Palace guards protecting Alkaro\u2026 They appear to be 6-star or stronger. If I face them head-on, I have a very low chance of winning.\u2019If he fully utilized both magic and spiritual power, Jin could somehow deal with one of them. But two or more were impossible.An entire day went by, but Alkaro was nowhere to be seen. Jin came to the conclusion that Alkaro was constantly staying inside his room, eating the food that his bodyguards were bringing him.\u2018It\u2019s impossible to assassinate him by entering his room. There are probably more men standing guard inside at all times. In that case, I need to wait for him to come out.\u2019Jin recalled Alkaro\u2019s personality as it was written in the documents sent by the Tzendler Clan.\u2018Alkaro Tzendler is obsessed with hedonistic pleasures.\u2019Suddenly, Jin remembered something the barman had told him the day before at the pub.What do you want? Drugs? There\u2019s one product that\u2019s been the craze in Mamit recently.It was very likely that Alkaro was stuck in his room doing drugs.Once his thoughts reached that conclusion, Jin wiped his forehead and headed downstairs to the lobby. He was planning on cracking open a cold one and getting to know the others in the lobby.But once he arrived, he had to prevent his shock and surprise from appearing on his face.\u201cJust why?! Why can\u2019t you do it?! You were getting it fine until yesterday!\u201d\u201cI cannot do it anymore.\u201d\u201cGoddammit! Go get some more, I\u2019m telling you!\u201dThe young man having a temper tantrum at the center of the lobby was Alkaro Tzendler himself. Jin had memorized his target\u2019s face in advance, so he recognized him immediately. It appeared that he was enraged as one of his bodyguards wouldn\u2019t get him more of the drugs.\u2018Ah\u2026 Your typical lowlife douchebag.\u2019Jin smiled maliciously in his mind.Chapter 36 \u2013 Mamit Lawless Zone (1)The Mamit Lawless Zone was a region where all kinds of criminals and offenders gathered.There were even rumours around the world that due to the evil energy these lawbreakers emitted, this criminal-infested land was so desolate that no plants could grow on it.But it was no rumour.

Freaking hell, are you a salmon or something? Stop coming back all the time, lmao!\u201dThe people inside the pub cheered joyfully as they all recognized the hulking man. Mocking someone until one loses their voice, pointing fingers, and throwing entire mugs of beer are Mamit\u2019s traditional yet peculiar ways of greeting others.Crash! Smash!

The drinks are on me today!\u201d\u201cGeez, Thonk. What did you do this time that you had to run away and come back here? C\u2019mon, speak up. Let\u2019s hear the story.\u201d\u201cKuhaha! I, the Great Thonk, had some fun with a high-class bitch in the Ekan Kingdom.\u201d\u201cOooh! Who was it?\u201d\u201cNo idea, just some girl from a noble family. And I killed the five guards who came to arrest me. Geez, do they seriously think they can capture me with ordinary guards?

While I was destroying them, I subconsciously headed towards Mamit, and found myself here before I realized it\u2026\u201d\u201cTo Thonk\u2019s massacre! Cheers!\u201d\u201cCheers! Welcome back home! It\u2019s good to see you again!\u201dGulp, gulp, gulp!The men were emptying their glasses.The rowdy craze calmed down as everyone was busy finishing their beers. But in the meantime\u2026Creaaak\u2026One boy entered the bar covered up in a tattered robe.It was Jin.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cLooks like there\u2019s a real newcomer this time.\u201dThonk and the other men exchanged glances, asking each other if anyone knew who this was. But everyone shook their heads.Thud, thud.A thick noise echoed every time Jin took a step with his old, ragged boots. He silently crossed the room and sat down next to Thonk.\u201cOne glass of cold water. And some simple snacks.\u201dJin took out one silver coin from his chest pocket and flicked it to the barman.\u201cHah.\u201dThe barman caught the coin and snorted as if he couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. Soon enough, the entire pub roared in laughter.\u201cKya!\u201d\u201cWow, I thought I was watching the protagonist of an action novel or something. Look at him. He\u2019s a natural at acting cool!\u201d\u201cSo? Who are you, hm? Some 9-star knight?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you see? He\u2019s gotta be a legendary swordsman! Pfffft!\u201dThe men spouting sarcastic comments all simultaneously changed their expressions. They swiftly stood up and surrounded Jin with menacing grins and chuckles.\u201cHey, Mr. Newcomer. I, the Great Thonk, am in a good mood today. So let\u2019s not get on each others\u2019 nerves, alright? If you get on your knees and suck on everyone\u2019s toes right now, I will forgive y\u2014kurgh!\u201dThonk was interrupted before he could even finish his sentence. In fact, he would never be able to finish his sentence ever again because the tip of the dagger Jin had taken out was lodged in Thonk\u2019s neck.The hulking man was standing too close to Jin without keeping his guard up, so he didn\u2019t even have the time to react to the boy\u2019s attack. No one had expected this young brat to stab a giant like Thonk in the neck without a speck of hesitation.\u201cKeuk, grrr\u2026\u201dOnce Jin retracted his dagger, blood gushed out of Thonk\u2019s wound as he fell to the floor.A long moment of silence followed. No one uttered a single sound. Jin silently waved his finger at the barman, urging him to bring his cold water and snacks.\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\u201cThonk\u2019s gone!\u201d\u201cI knew this would happen one day, pffft.\u201dSoon enough, the men surrounding Jin scattered around.They behaved as if the friendly exchanges they had with Thonk until not long ago were a sham and returned to their respective tables, downing beer in their original groups.This was a common occurrence. No matter how friendly they acted with Thonk, there was no true friendship between them.\u2018Just as Master used to say, this place is filled with lunatics.\u2019The reason they had shown interest in Jin was because he appeared weak. They were curious to know why a boy\u2014who seemed to have yet to grow any hair down there\u2014had entered a den of criminals like it was nothing.However, their questions had found an answer.Jin killed Thonk with a dagger and, by doing so, gained the approval of the criminals inside the pub. This was how the residents of Mamit \u2018truly welcomed\u2019 a newcomer.\u2018I always seem to be in your debt. You\u2019ve been a great help to me, both in my past and present life. I hope the day comes when I get an opportunity to repay you, Master.\u2019Clack.The barman placed a glass cup on Jin\u2019s table. A cup of cold water.\u201cI didn\u2019t put in any poison.\u201d\u201cEven I know that killing people with poison is a taboo here.\u201d\u201cYou seem to know a great deal about Mamit despite your youth. Are your parents or siblings familiar with this place?\u201d\u201cNone of your business.\u201dCling.This time, Jin flicked a gold coin to the barman, who just shrugged in response.\u201cWhat do you want? Drugs? There\u2019s one product that\u2019s been the craze in Mamit recently. Or are you looking for someone?\u201d\u201cThe latter. Is that enough to cover the fee?\u201dThe barman rubbed the coin with a handkerchief and calmly weighed it with his hand. The substantial weight proved that it was a genuine gold coin.\u201cDepends on who you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\u201cIs there someone who goes by Hister in this area?\u201d\u201cNo. That, I\u2019m certain of.\u201dJin clicked his tongue as if he were disappointed.\u201cI see. Then just bring over my snacks. And if you could, recommend some inn to stay at tonight. Preferably a place without any bugs.\u201d\u2018A place without any bugs\u2019 signified the safest inn in Mamit.\u201cThen I know just the place. There\u2019s an inn called the Moonlit Well west of the city. The Kings of Mamit reside there, so no need to cause a fuss when you enter.\u201d\u201cThanks.\u201dJin emptied his plate of rough bread and dry bacon before leaving the pub.The atmosphere inside the \u2018Moonlit Well\u2019 was vastly different from the pub, since the most influential people of Mamit resided in it. It was surprisingly clean and orderly, just like an ordinary inn outside of Mamit.It wasn\u2019t comparable to a high-class inn in a big city. But at the very least, the clients wouldn\u2019t come across lowly criminals who behaved like wild dogs.\u2018Even if he\u2019s the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s lover, he\u2019s just the disgrace of the Tzendler Clan. This is the only place where Alkaro Tzendler could stay in the city.\u2019There was no real need to go down to the underground black market to buy more information on Alkaro.According to the documents and information sent by the Tzendler Clan to the Runcandels, Alkaro wasn\u2019t someone who would be willing to spend the night in a dirty and damp inn. He was a conceited rich brat who hadn\u2019t experienced any hardships in life.Alkaro Tzendler acts obedient to powerful people and overbearing to the weak. He only wants premium goods and services and is obsessed with hedonistic pleasures. The only qualities he has are his good looks and his lineage.There was only one reason why this fancy-pants was residing in this dangerous city.It was a superficial scheme trying to regain the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s attention, as she was recently engrossed in another paramour.A childish tantrum along the lines of \u2018will you really not show any attention to me when I\u2019m in such a dangerous place?\u2019But if the Master of the Hidden Palace genuinely paid attention to him and came to Mamit to check on Alkaro now, Jin wouldn\u2019t have another opportunity to kill him for a long time. If the Master herself protected Alkaro personally, even Luna wouldn\u2019t be able to assassinate him.That was why the Tzendler Clan had urgently commissioned the Runcandels using this opportunity.\u2018For now, rumours about me will spread around Mamit. Things like \u201csome kid killed Thonk as soon as he arrived, and he\u2019s looking for someone called Hister,\u201d should spread to everyone.\u2019Jin had wreaked havoc in the pub for a reason.After causing a ruckus in a location where low-ranking informants gathered, he had spread false information, saying that he was looking for Hister. That he had come this far in search of this specific person.And this rumour would reach the Hidden Palace bodyguards protecting Alkaro within the day. Jin had done this because the bodyguards were most likely checking every customer\u2019s identity.In consequence, Jin would naturally be excluded from their prioritized surveillance target. If someone were to come with the goal of assassinating Alkaro, they wouldn\u2019t suspect a boy like Jin who wasn\u2019t hiding his presence and clumsily trudging along in the city.\u2018The people who had come to assassinate Alkaro so far were all skilled, hired mercenaries. But since I look a lot sloppier, it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll suspect me much.\u2019Alkaro\u2019s bodyguards wouldn\u2019t focus on people like Jin who had a clear objective.In fact, they would be more wary of someone like Thonk\u2014a criminal who was familiar with the city\u2014who recently returned to Mamit for no apparent reason.An assassin wants to blend in with the residents and mingle with them, trying not to attract attention. But with how Jin was doing it, he was standing out to be forgotten. As they say, it is darkest under the lamp.In fact, his strategy worked like magic.The men who were observing Jin inside the Moonlit Well during the day visibly let down their guards once night fell.\u2018It seems that those three are the Hidden Palace guards protecting Alkaro\u2026 They appear to be 6-star or stronger. If I face them head-on, I have a very low chance of winning.\u2019If he fully utilized both magic and spiritual power, Jin could somehow deal with one of them. But two or more were impossible.An entire day went by, but Alkaro was nowhere to be seen. Jin came to the conclusion that Alkaro was constantly staying inside his room, eating the food that his bodyguards were bringing him.\u2018It\u2019s impossible to assassinate him by entering his room. There are probably more men standing guard inside at all times. In that case, I need to wait for him to come out.\u2019Jin recalled Alkaro\u2019s personality as it was written in the documents sent by the Tzendler Clan.\u2018Alkaro Tzendler is obsessed with hedonistic pleasures.\u2019Suddenly, Jin remembered something the barman had told him the day before at the pub.What do you want? Drugs? There\u2019s one product that\u2019s been the craze in Mamit recently.It was very likely that Alkaro was stuck in his room doing drugs.Once his thoughts reached that conclusion, Jin wiped his forehead and headed downstairs to the lobby. He was planning on cracking open a cold one and getting to know the others in the lobby.But once he arrived, he had to prevent his shock and surprise from appearing on his face.\u201cJust why?! Why can\u2019t you do it?! You were getting it fine until yesterday!\u201d\u201cI cannot do it anymore.\u201d\u201cGoddammit! Go get some more, I\u2019m telling you!\u201dThe young man having a temper tantrum at the center of the lobby was Alkaro Tzendler himself. Jin had memorized his target\u2019s face in advance, so he recognized him immediately. It appeared that he was enraged as one of his bodyguards wouldn\u2019t get him more of the drugs.\u2018Ah\u2026 Your typical lowlife douchebag.\u2019Jin smiled maliciously in his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37 \u2013 Mamit Lawless Zone (2)[Translator \u2013 Koko\u2019s muscles are sore from bouldering][Proofreader \u2013 yuki\u2019s brain is sore from thinking]Before Jin\u2019s regression\u2014back when he had just been banished from the Garden of Swords\u2014there was a period when he roamed from country to country, sleeping out in the open.He had lost his lifelong goal after being banished from his clan and was surviving like a cripple on the streets. But everything changed when he met his magic teacher.Nevertheless, until the day he met his master, Jin had seen and experienced countless types of criminals and scoundrels in the dark alleyways where no one entered.Petty thieves, robbers, beggars, alcoholics, etc. Those people lived like no tomorrow, and were only loyal to their desires.\u2018The most notable scumbags amongst them were druggies.\u2019Drug addicts.Those people couldn\u2019t survive for another day without their drugs. Without their \u2018medicine\u2019, they would sit lifelessly with hollow eyes and foam in their mouths. But if someone were to offer them the drugs, it was second nature for them to be willing to carve out their hearts to pay.Ten times out of ten. A hundred out of a hundred. A thousand out of a thousand!Every single drug addict Jin had seen was the same, without a single exception.There were some rare people who had managed to stop their addiction with their superhuman willpower and returned to an ordinary lifestyle, but obviously enough, they were one in a million.In any case, according to Jin\u2019s observations and the documents he had read, Alkaro Tzendler wasn\u2019t someone with such strong willpower.\u201cFuck! Please, do me a favour, alright? I don\u2019t think I can survive for another hour without it. Please, I\u2019m begging you\u2026\u201dAlkaro flopped onto the floor and put his hands together, begging his bodyguards.The Hidden Palace guards were all wearing composed looks, but Jin noticed the slight disgust in their gazes that appeared momentarily.\u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, it cannot be done. Our task is to prioritize your safety, Young Master. Please keep in mind that we\u2019re not here to babysit you. If you continue to have a temper tantrum, we will have to\u2014\u201d\u201cAaaaargh! I don\u2019t care! Shut up! If you won\u2019t get me the drugs, then I\u2019ll do something myself! Fucking hell, just you wait. Once my sweetheart returns, you\u2019re all losing your heads! Your heads, do you hear that?! I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re all executed!\u201d\u201cHaaa.\u201d\u201cHuh? Did you just sigh? Am I a joke to you? You lowly guards! You insignificant pleb bastards! I\u2019m from the Tzend\u2014\u201dThwack!One guard suddenly punched Alkaro in the abdomen. The arrogant druggy trembled on the spot for a few seconds before fainting.\u201cGoddammit. How much longer do we have to protect this piece of crap?\u201d\u201cI wish he\u2019d just die from an overdose or something. Just why is the master keeping this piece of shit alive\u2026?\u201d\u201cSilence. We just need to fulfill the mission we\u2019ve been assigned. You mustn\u2019t get your personal feelings involved.\u201dThe guards carried the unconscious Alkaro back to the room.Having witnessed the entire scene, Jin felt like he had discovered a treasure chest full of gold.\u2018Alkaro\u2019s relationship with his bodyguards is the worst. And it seems like he\u2019d be willing to do anything to get drugs once he wakes up.\u2019Hm\u2026As he drank the beer the inn\u2019s employee brought him, Jin pondered to himself. Assassinating Alkaro would not be such a difficult task in the end.The druggy young master\u2019s tantrums would get worse and worse as the days went by. And if his outbursts repeated enough times, Jin would have more opportunities to assassinate him throughout the next few days.Whether he used magic, spiritual power, or a plain old dagger, killing Alkaro was going to be a piece of cake.\u2018But the problem is the aftermath. I need to find a way to avoid the guards and return home safely after I\u2019ve killed him.\u2019That was the most difficult aspect of this mission.It was impossible to kill him in broad daylight inside the inn and escape alive. The 6-star or higher bodyguards were far more physically capable than Jin and could catch up to him in no time.Poison wouldn\u2019t work either. If Jin baited Alkaro with drugs and killed him using poison, the entirety of Mamit would be in an uproar.The greatest unwritten taboo in the lawless city is the usage of poison.Jin\u2019s head began aching as he tried to come up with a plan. Assassinating Alkaro inside the Moonlit Well using traditional methods was impossible.Bang.Having chugged down his beer, Jin placed the mug back on the table with vigour.\u2018I\u2019ve made up my mind.\u2019Jin had come up with a strategy.He would do a terror attack on the Moonlit Well using magic from inside his room.The Moonlit Well was the inn where the kings of Mamit resided.A building where the most notorious and prominent figures amongst the worst criminals of Mamit were gathered. As soon as the terror attack begins, these \u2018kings\u2019 of Mamit would counterattack and track down the culprit.Moreover, their main suspect would be a \u20186-star or higher magician\u2019.\u2018If I cast a 4-star spell and enhance its effects with spiritual energy, it should be as powerful as a 6-star spell. The most effective way would be to use the lightning spell \u2018Summon Lightning\u2019 and amplify its firepower.\u2019Who in the world would ever believe that a 15-year-old kid was a 6-star magician?No one. Not a single soul.Even Beradin Zipfel\u2014a candidate to become the next Zipfel patriarch\u2014had just become a 6-star magician at the age of 18, shaking the entire world with his genius.Blindly casting 6-star spells at the age of 15 was impossible to do, even for geniuses from the Zipfel Clan.\u2018No need to overthink this. I\u2019ll fill my room with spiritual energy to cover up the traces of magic being cast.\u2019When something gets covered in spiritual energy, its existence and presence becomes faint, no matter what it is.Jin had once thrown a dagger covered in spiritual energy and easily managed to kill a 4-star warrior. Mana and aura weren\u2019t an exception to this rule either. Jin was confident that he could effortlessly conceal 4-star spells with his spiritual energy.Thus, the guests residing in the Moonlit Well would believe that the terror attack had originated from outside.There was no way the powerful kings of Mamit wouldn\u2019t notice mana suddenly being generated inside the inn. Therefore, they\u2019d trust their senses and believe that the culprit was outside.\u2018I\u2019ll amplify the Summon Lightning spell and drop it on the Moonlit Well. I\u2019ll probably be injured as well, but I should be fine since I have Orgal\u2019s Pendant with me.\u2019Orgal\u2019s Pendant could nullify most of the effects of 5-star or lower magic spells. 6-star and onwards were a bit more dangerous, but the pendant\u2019s nullifying powers weren\u2019t completely useless.\u2018With my current mana and spiritual energy, I think I can use the amplified Summon Lightning spell a total of four times. If I cast the spell four times on different areas of the inn, it should start an uproar amongst the guests.\u2019In the meantime, Jin would pretend to be injured and walk around the inn. And once he found Alkaro, he\u2019d kill him and complete his task.It would be even better if Alkaro unluckily got hit directly by one of the lightning spells and died immediately.\u2018I\u2019ve always felt annoyed by how young I am, but it\u2019s pretty helpful at times.\u2019Just as its name implies, Summon Lightning is a spell that attacks someone with a sudden streak of lightning falling from the sky. It only lasts for an instant; thus, it would be hard for people to notice that there was spiritual energy mixed in with the spell.And even if someone did discern some dark energy within the streak of lightning, it was likely that they\u2019d just think of it as some unknown variant of the normal spell. Spiritual power wasn\u2019t very well-known around the world, whereas all kinds of magic variants existed throughout the continent.Jin\u2019s regression, his spiritual power, along with his innate talent with magic.Had he been missing one of these, he wouldn\u2019t have even thought of attempting a terror attack on the Moonlit Well.\u2018There\u2019s no need to wait a few more days. We never know what that drug addict might attempt to do if I wait for too long. I\u2019ll initiate the plan at noon tomorrow.\u2019Instead of attacking during the evening or the middle of the night when most people were asleep, it would be far more efficient to attack in broad daylight.The more people witnessed the 6-star Summon Lightning spell with their own eyes, the more beneficial it was for Jin.***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Koko\u2019s muscles are sore from bouldering[Proofreader \u2013 yuki\u2019s brain is sore from thinking]Join our discord to get the latest news and updates about the translations!https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv***10:30 AM.Jin descended to the lobby and ordered a late breakfast. He was served freshly baked bread, boiled eggs, and soup.This was all part of his plan. He had to behave like every other guest staying at the Moonlit Well and start his morning as a normal human being.Five of Mamit\u2019s kings were at the lobby eating breakfast as well. They smirked as they sensed the weak aura exuding from Jin.\u201cKid. You seem to be quite talented for your age, but you shouldn\u2019t stay for too long in this city with that level of skills. You\u2019ll just be at a disadvantage if you stir up trouble.\u201dOne of the five spoke to the boy.\u201cThank you for the advice. But there is someone I must find. I will make sure I don\u2019t cause any trouble for the people residing here.\u201d\u201cHaha, what a docile lamb. Even though you were a ferocious wolf who killed someone with a dagger in mere instants not long ago.\u201d\u201cYou are on a completely different level compared to those drunkards. I know my place and know when not to cross the line.\u201d\u201cYour manners are adequate. Good, I shall allow you to stay here for a few more days.\u201d\u201cThank you very much. I shall never forget how the kings of Mamit took care of me even after I leave the city.\u201dJin slightly lowered his head and left his seat, returning to his room. The kings of Mamit found his attitude endearing and began chatting amongst each other.\u201cMamit is done for. Look, even brats like him are coming and going as they please now.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll leave after a few days. If not, he\u2019ll probably get killed by some random lowlifes in the area.\u201d\u201cStill, he seemed like quite the decent kid. Maybe I should recruit him into our organization as a rookie.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t. He\u2019ll probably end up a cripple if you let your men loose around him due to his good looks.\u201dBwahahaha!The kings of Mamit all burst out in laughter.\u2018My manners are adequate? What laughable pieces of trash.\u2019Having returned to his room, Jin also exploded in laughter. He found it hilarious that the scoundrels who had committed some of the worst crimes in the city were being advocates of manners and courtesy. He couldn\u2019t wait to drop some thunderbolts on their heads.Jin sat down cross-legged in the middle of the room.He closed his eyes and released spiritual energy. Soon enough, dark smoky energy began seeping out of his entire body. In order to start the attack at noon, he had to diligently prepare the smaller details early on.\u2018I\u2019ll fill up the entire room with spiritual energy so that no one can sense anything from outside.\u2019As his room was tiny, he could cover up and fill in every little crack within an hour.This single hour was the most important step of the plan. If someone came to his room during this time, his plan would be in shambles.He could constantly hear footsteps outside his room, in the corridor. It was the sound of the employees cleaning the place, and guests leaving and entering their rooms.\u2018Well, I have to take a risk. Otherwise, I won\u2019t be able to accomplish anything.\u2019Jin properly began the spiritual release. As the room filled up with more and more dark energy, the sounds from beyond his door got fainter and fainter. This gave Jin a sense of security and calm.The hour went by. The room was filled with spiritual energy, as if ink had permeated into every surface and into the air. One couldn\u2019t discern the outline of the furniture. It was basically synonymous to total darkness.The only entity that had retained colour inside the room was Jin.\u2018I gotta say, quite the perfect work, Jin.\u2019Phewww.Jin regained control over his breathing and wiped off the sweat on his forehead. All that was left to do was generating mana and preparing to cast Summon Lightning.\u2018I\u2019ll make the spiritual energy inside the room disappear by infusing it inside the final Summon Lightning spell. Afterwards, all that\u2019s left to do is scream and run out of the room, pretending to be injured, and to check whether Alkaro\u2019s alive or not\u2026\u2019A simple, yet effective strategy.As Jin praised himself and his plan, he began gathering mana in both his hands.Crackle! Crack!Blue electricity ran down his arms to his hands as they generated a lot of noise. However, not a single soul could hear sounds outside the room, just as Jin had planned.Next, string-like strands of spiritual energy were mixed into the electricity.\u2018Summon Lightning.\u2019Boooooooooooom!The first bolt of lightning fell onto the Moonlit Well, destroying half the building\u2019s roof.\u201cAaarg\u2014!\u201dBefore the casualties could cry out in pain, before the uninjured could raise their heads to look at the sky\u2026A second streak of dark-blue lightning struck down on the Moonlit Well. It was the second attack.People began running out of the ashen and destroyed guest rooms, screaming for their lives.\u201cWhat the\u2026 Looks like I chose the wrong day to come here.\u201dAnd a certain girl\u2014who was about to set foot inside the Moonlit Well\u2014tilted her head in confusion as she watched this spectacle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You stay here and protect milady.\u201dThe two men standing beside the girl spoke in turn.However, she just snorted and spoke in a mocking tone.\u201cDo you think I\u2019m some powerless idiot who can\u2019t even protect herself? There are six of our guards inside the inn already. In other words, this may be a terror attack against the Hidden Palace. Ryu, go search for the magician. Hiten, come check on the guards inside with me.\u201dRyu and Hiten lowered their heads in respect to the lady.The girl who had commanded them was Syris Endorma.She was the Master of the Hidden Palace Talaris Endorma\u2019s daughter.\u201cWe can kill someone like Alkaro whenever we want. So instead of him, make it your top priority to check on our guards\u2019 safety and well-being.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Milady.\u201dRyu leaped in the air to track down the magician. Meanwhile, Syris and Hiten entered the inn.Boooom!The third bolt of lightning fell onto the Moonlit Well. This time, an entire floor was destroyed, and the Kings of Mamit shouted their frustrations at the top of their lungs.Even Syris and Hiten stopped in their tracks. Now that they were seeing it from up close, the lightning bolt\u2019s power was far greater than they had expected.\u201cFucking hell! Just which son of a bitch is it?!\u201d\u201cMenka, you bastard! Didn\u2019t you say you killed a few magicians from the Zipfel Clan not long ago? Aren\u2019t they back to get revenge on you?\u201d\u201cI was bluffing! It never happened!\u201dThe customers ran out of the inn and bickered amongst each other.But not all of them were doing so. As they were called the Kings of Mamit, some of them were getting ready for battle, while the others were trying to find the source of the magic spells.Immediately, the final lightning bolt struck the inn.The fourth bolt was far stronger than the initial three as Jin had amplified the spell using all the spiritual energy in his room; this, in turn, erased all traces of dark energy in it.Boooom! Craaaash!The streak of electricity struck the inn in the center, and the building was split in half. The divided inn was on the verge of collapsing on either side.\u201cArgh!\u201d\u201cKeuk!\u201dMore guests covered in soot and ashes escaped from the dust and joined the lobby.Barely thirty seconds had passed since the beginning of this pandemonium. The people had no idea who had attacked the Moonlit Well.\u201c\u2026Looks like the attacks have ceased.\u201d\u201cYes, Milady.\u201dAs Syris and Hiten entered the remains of the building, Jin came falling down from the 2nd floor.Thud!\u201cUrgh\u2026!\u201dFalling from the 2nd floor wasn\u2019t that painful, but Jin had dropped the final bolt near his guestroom.(TL/N: In Korea, you start counting floors from 1st, 2nd. So there\u2019s no ground floor/floor zero. So he didn\u2019t fall from that high up.)\u2018That last one was closer to the level of a 7-star spell\u2026 Maybe because I infused all the spiritual energy in the room with the spell.\u2019Had it not been for Orgal\u2019s Pendant around his neck, Jin would\u2019ve received a fatal injury. But as of right now, he had gotten away with a burnt robe and some veins popping here and there in his body.The boy looked at his surroundings, acting as naturally as possible.He had to check whether Alkaro was still alive or not. While he didn\u2019t see his assassination target, Jin did catch the bodyguards running around in a rush.There was still smoke filling up the air in the lobby. If Alkaro had survived the extremely powerful lightning spells, Jin had to find him now and kill him. This was his only chance.Jin was about to take out his dagger, but froze. He looked up and saw an unknown girl looking down at him.\u201cOh? I never thought I\u2019d find a boy around my age here in Mamit. Hey, are you alright? You should head outside to safety for now.\u201d\u201cMilady, our men seem to be gathered over there. All six of them are safe and sound.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. For now, tell them to assemble. And if they\u2019re still protecting Alkaro, just order them to kill him.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cAnd once Ryu finds the magician, go capture him with our men. Since the spells all looked similar, it must be a single magician behind this attack.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe boy on the floor immediately came to a realization as he listened to their exchange.\u2018She\u2019s the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter! From her attitude, she came all this way to deal with Alkaro.\u2019An unexpected encounter.But Jin thought of this meeting as a blessing rather than misfortune.\u2018According to what she said, even if Alkaro survived the spells, they\u2019ll kill him anyway. So there\u2019s no need for me to check on him and kill him myself. Moreover, the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter thinks this attack was caused by a magician and doesn\u2019t suspect me.\u2019From now on, the person holding the highest authority here in the inn would be the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter.Even if the Kings of Mamit were revered by the city and treated as royals here, they didn\u2019t stand a chance against her.\u2018It\u2019s highly likely that she\u2019ll suspect this was a terror attack against the Hidden Palace. Then all I need to do is pretend to be terrified and escape from this place.\u2019It wasn\u2019t just the girl. The rest of the customers residing in the Moonlit Well were thinking a magician had attacked them.Thus, the chances of Jin being accused as the culprit were extremely low.However, there was one problem.\u2018If the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter sees my face, things can get complicated later on in life.\u2019It didn\u2019t matter much if the leaders of Mamit or the small fry of the city saw his face. They would never meet again in Jin\u2019s life, and even if it ended up becoming problematic, he could just silence them in the future.But the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter was a completely different story.She was someone Jin inevitably had to meet if he stayed at the Garden of Swords.\u201cMilady!\u201d\u201cIs everyone alright? Where\u2019s Alkaro?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s\u2026 We have no excuses. Alkaro has perished from the attacks just now. We have failed to protect him.\u201d\u201cIs that so? That\u2019s perfect. No need to be ashamed. Good work enduring that moron\u2019s irritating behaviour so far. I came all this way to deal with him in the first place.\u201dWhile the girl conversed with her men, Jin grabbed a handful of soot and rubbed it all over his face. This was better than nothing to hide his face.Shling!Syris unsheathed a pure-white sword and raised it in the air.\u201cThe Hidden Palace shall now take control over this inn! I am Syris Endorma, daughter of the Master of the Hidden Palace Talaris Endorma, captain of the Hidden Palace\u2019s Seven Swords. All those who oppose will be considered enemies of the Hidden Palace from now on.\u201cHiten, order our men to block and regulate all movement and activity in a radius of five hundred meters. Make sure nobody can move until Ryu has found the magician. Understood?\u201d\u201cYes, Milady.\u201d\u201cAh, um. Did you say you\u2019re the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter? Still, this place is Mamit. So as the Kings of Mamit, it\u2019s a bit irritating if you try to take control of the situation despite our very obvious presence. Also, isn\u2019t it highly possible that we were attacked because of the Hidden Palace in the first place?\u201dThe one who spoke up was the King of Mamit who had mentioned about \u2018manners\u2019 this morning to Jin. Once he finished stating his point, the other kings around him nodded in agreement.\u201cHiten.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBring me his head.\u201dAs those terrifying words echoed, Hiten vanished from his spot without a trace.Scrrt!The guard appeared behind the opposer out of nowhere, and a metallic linear flash was reflected in everyone\u2019s eyes. Hiten brought the head of the dead man\u2014who still had his eyes open\u2014and politely laid it at Syris\u2019s feet.\u201cI mentioned that all those who oppose would be considered enemies, didn\u2019t I? And \u2018Kings of Mamit\u2019? Have you been playing royals in this rubbish heap of a city for so long that you\u2019ve forgotten your places? Is the Hidden Palace a joke to you \u2018kings\u2019?\u201dThe Kings of Mamit all averted their gazes, some coughing awkwardly.They weren\u2019t weak in any way. If the Kings of Mamit all united their forces, they could even stand a chance against Syris\u2019s subordinates. However, none of them wanted to have the Hidden Palace as their enemy.\u201cEhem. We don\u2019t want to have you people as our enemies either. But at the very least, do respect us and be mindful of our positions. The one who just died wasn\u2019t completely wrong either, was he?\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s revealed that the attack was aimed at the guards of the Hidden Palace, we will compensate you for the damages. But what if it\u2019s the other way around? What if our men were innocent bystanders of an attack that was aimed at one of you people?\u201dSyris sharply retorted, to which the Kings of Mamit couldn\u2019t refute.\u201cSigh, alright. Do as you wish. We didn\u2019t know that the guards who were protecting that druggy were part of the Hidden Palace. We shall leave you in charge. We also wish to find the magician and kill him, so our goals are aligned.\u201d\u201cGood. For now, have all the survivors gather here. Currently, one of the Hidden Palace\u2019s Seven Swords is searching for the magician out there. But it\u2019s still possible that the culprit is someone amongst you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s unlikely. None of us are magicians.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t doubt that. But it\u2019s possible that one of you recently got on the bad side of this magician in question. Pieces of trash like you cause all kinds of trouble wherever you go, am I right? In any case, have everyone gather here.\u201dThe Kings of Mamit all sighed as they descended the stairs along with the other survivors. Meanwhile, Syris lowered her gaze.\u201cWhy are you still dilly-dallying here? Didn\u2019t I tell you to head outside to safety about three minutes ago?\u201dUnlike her conversation with the Kings of Mamit, Syris was using a much softer and tender tone when addressing Jin. The boy curled up in order to hide his face as much as possible.\u201cTha-That\u2019s\u2026 Because it\u2019s terrifying. And I hurt my leg earlier. I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cAhahaha, you\u2019re quite fearful for a young man, even though you\u2019ve got a sword at your belt. How cute. Now, get moving. And forget everything you saw today. Oh, and put this on your leg before leaving.\u201d\u201cThank you very much.\u201dSyris took out an ointment that was brewed using healing mana. Jin was about to receive it with his sooty hands, but Syris smiled and shook her head.\u201cLook at your dirty hands. Just let me put it on you. Pull back your pant leg. Still, aren\u2019t you quite the lucky one? Not only did you survive a terror attack, I, Syris Endorma, am personally putting ointment on your leg. You should feel honoured.\u201dJin clumsily pulled back his pant leg. Syris crouched down and rubbed some ointment on the boy\u2019s shin. In the middle of his shin was a deep and long gash.\u2018Why is she so kind? The Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter was infamous in my first life for being crazed and out of her mind. Were the rumours completely unfounded?\u2019Once she finished putting on the ointment, Syris and Jin\u2019s gazes met each other.The girl had not a single ounce of suspicion towards the boy. Furthermore, she was happy to finally meet someone of her age group in this desolate city and felt like helping him out.\u201cThere, all done. Hiten! Why is Ryu taking so long? Don\u2019t tell me he can\u2019t find the magician?\u00a0That\u00a0Ryu?\u201d\u201cHe is somewhat late indeed. Should I head out there and search for the culprit as well?\u201d\u201cHm, forget it. The magician seems to be skilled at concealing themselves. Even so, they must be inside the city, so it\u2019s only a question of time. I doubt Ryu won\u2019t be able to find his target. It\u2019s just a measly magician after all.\u201d\u201cI concur.\u201dAfter straightening his pant leg, Jin stood up and bowed deeply.\u201cUm, how can I return this favour?\u201dAs he asked her, Jin had to hold back the smile that was about to creep up on his face. After completing the terror attack, if the Kings of Mamit held him back for some reason, things could\u2019ve gotten complicated for him. However, the situation had unfolded so easily.Moreover, Syris wasn\u2019t trying to check Jin\u2019s face properly either. She was simply showing him kindness and sending him on his way.\u201cHow could you ever repay a debt to someone like me? Just think of this as a nice memory. And if you remember me from time to time, just bow in the direction of the Hidden Palace whenever you can. Well then, bye!\u201dHaving left the Moonlit Well inn, Jin followed the streets and left Mamit.While he had gotten some help from Syris, Alkaro had still died from Jin\u2019s own magic, so he had no reason to feel guilty or ashamed about the completion of his mission.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39 \u2013 Kinzelo\u2019s Misunderstanding[Translator \u2013 Koko is addicted to Breath of the Wild\u2026 I need to stop procrastinating\u2026][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is just casually drowning in PR slavery\u2026 nothing new there\u2026]In the meantime, the Youngest Division was on their own mission.And contrary to the expectations of all members of the intermediate class, the members of Jin\u2019s faction were faring quite well against the orcs. They had already subjugated 17 of the 25 orcs they were assigned to defeat.\u201cThis makes 18! At this rate, we might all actually return alive with no casualties!\u201dScott and Taimont extracted their swords from the orc\u2019s corpse.\u201cLet\u2019s return safely and destroy all of those bastards\u2019 pride and ego. I was worried we\u2019d ruin the Young Master\u2019s reputation, but if this goes on, it might be the opposite instead.\u201d\u201cThere are still seven orcs left. We mustn\u2019t let down our guards until we subjugate them all.\u201dWhile Mesa burst their little bubble of excitement, she was actually smiling deep inside.\u2018It\u2019s almost as if we were blessed by the gods. No, it might be Young Master Jin who was blessed by the gods, and his good fortune rubbed off on us as well.\u2019All the members of Jin\u2019s division were of the same opinion.Normally, orcs moved in groups. However, for some reason, these orcs were appearing one at a time, as if they were asking to be killed. Moreover, they were never in a hurry, and attacked the cadets sluggishly.No wonder they thought they were extremely lucky.\u201cResume scouting the area! Make sure you stay vigilant, everyone!\u201dThe Jin Division cut and stored the dead orc\u2019s ear in a bag and returned to their respective positions in the formation.As they moved through the forest, one man observed the cadets from behind, hidden in the dense, tall grass.\u2018Once they defeat the remaining seven orcs, I can finally go back home as well\u2026\u2019The man wearing a bored and dull face was Murakan.Mesa thought that the gods\u2019 blessing was protecting them, but it was in fact the Black Dragon Murakan who was acting as their guardian angel.Murakan had arrived here, in the unprotected zone of the Curano Dukedom, before the Jin Division and had assembled the orcs.Afterwards, he told them as such:\u2014Listen carefully, you stinking pigs. I won\u2019t say this twice. From today onwards, you all need to move around alone. If I see a single one of you trying to build a group and gather other orcs, I will personally annihilate you all. Do you understand?Lowly orcs couldn\u2019t go against the orders of the Great Black Dragon.Moreover, he had spoken to them in \u2018Dragon-Tongue\u2019, the language that represented the authority of the dragons. Dominating the minds of low-class monsters with Dragon-Tongue was as easy as breathing to Murakan.He was the only reason the Jin Division could safely defeat the orcs one by one so far. Needless to say, the cadets had no idea about this truth.\u2018Still, it seems like Jin, that kid\u2026 he\u2019s planning on continuously sending me on these trivial missions. Geez, do you think being the promised contractor of a thousand years makes you the boss of me? Fuck, it does! Dammit! That son of a\u2014!\u2019The members of the Jin Division managed to subjugate the remaining seven orcs the next day in the middle of the night.\u201cWe did it!\u201d\u201cWe really made it alive!\u201dThis time around, even Mesa couldn\u2019t hide her joy and glee, and cheered along with her teammates. They had completed the mission one day earlier than what they had expected.\u201cWe\u2019ll take turns resting and keeping watch until the afternoon. Once everyone has gotten some sleep, we\u2019re returning to the Garden of Swords! We switch the members on night watch duty every 45 minutes. The one on food duty will prepare breakfast.\u201dAnd so began their late-night/early morning camp.Murakan also lied down amongst the tall grass near the campsite. He was planning on spending time until afternoon came by reading the erotic magazines he had brought with him.As he read the magazines, his annoyance and irritation slowly disappeared. He hadn\u2019t been able to spend time reading them until now as he had to keep an eye on the human brats\u2014kids who weren\u2019t even involved in his destiny.\u2018Once we\u2019re back, I\u2019m definitely telling the kid to get me several limited edition magazines in return for this favour. Hehe, thinking of it like that, helping these brats on their mission is quite profitable for me as well\u2014\u2019Floop.Murakan suddenly closed the magazine he was reading and sighed.He could sense a dangerous presence in the distance slowly approaching the campsite where the Jin Division was staying. He didn\u2019t know who this presence belonged to or what their objective was, but Murakan was certain about two things:One, the individual was slowly approaching the cadets\u2019 campsite.And two, the individual had considerable power.\u2018Seems like fate isn\u2019t on our side. At this rate, the effort I put in this mission won\u2019t match the profit I\u2019ll make. Where did this bastard suddenly pop out of?\u2019Tsk!Murakan clicked his tongue bitterly and stood up.Fortunately, the cadets of the Jin Division were only at the 3-star level. Thus, Murakan could erect a large barrier around the campsite, and the kids wouldn\u2019t be able to differentiate the darkness of the night from the shadowy hemisphere protecting them.Ssssssssssssst\u2026!A handful of shadows gathered in both of his palms.This was on a completely different scale compared to the demonstration he had done in the underground chamber of the Storm Castle. As Murakan lived alongside Jin on the surface of the continent, he was slowly breathing in some of the abundant shadows around him on a daily basis. Therefore, he had regained some of his strength from the era when he was known as the Black Dragon that shook the world.\u201cHm?\u201dAs Murakan covered the campsite in a barrier of spiritual energy, Bellop\u2014who was on night watch duty\u2014tilted his head in confusion.He felt like his surroundings had suddenly gotten darker than before. However, he didn\u2019t think much of it. The boy merely believed they were deeper into the night, and didn\u2019t notice the barrier.As a gust of heavy wind shook the trees, Murakan covered his entire body in spiritual energy as well. Soon, what emerged from his original position was an enormous black dragon. It was Murakan\u2019s original form.Swoosh!His gigantic pair of wings covered the moon. All the monsters, alongside the animals and other living creatures in the area, began to tremble in instinctive fear and subconscious terror.Unsurprisingly, the powerful entity that was approaching the campsite also stopped in its tracks; it had detected Murakan.[Who dares to leak their energy in my presence without my permission?]Murakan flew into the sky and covered the moon and stars. The black dragon blocking the moonlight exuded a dangerous air that no one would doubt it of being an agent of the gods.However, there was no answer.Unfortunately, Murakan wasn\u2019t as merciful as usual when in his original form.Swooooosh! Swooooosh!With each flap of a wing, a dark storm swept through the area.A storm of shadows. As the tempest raged in the forest, it snapped large trees like twigs and swirled around the source of this spiritual energy.Only then did the individual lying down in the distance finally stand up to reveal themselves. Having verified the response from this \u2018entity\u2019, Murakan stopped flapping his wings.Its gigantic body that could be compared to a fortress was covered in rocks. Beneath the large helmet moulded with ancient magic were two bright-red eyes, glaring at the dragon.Finally, there was an immense spear and shield in both of its hands.It was a being called a \u2018Cemetery Giant\u2019.[\u2026Oho, I see. It wasn\u2019t a living being, but rather an outdated relic from the old ages.]Murakan was surprised by the appearance of this Cemetery Giant.The Cemetery Giants had already disappeared without a trace around two thousand years ago. They were tasked with protecting the graves of the deceased gods, but the dragon race had exterminated them.In other words, this giant wasn\u2019t supposed to exist in modern times anymore, let alone appear before Murakan.As the dragon calmly landed on the ground, the Cemetery Giant raised its shield. For a short while, Murakan looked down at his enemy and felt something was wrong with this situation.[But I\u2019m not pleased to see you.]Krrrrr.The Cemetery Giant let out a disgusting groan and lowered its stance. Murakan tightened his scales as he recalled the ancient war between both races.He was preparing to release his breath. While it would leave behind traces, he had to finish this fight as quickly as possible.Murakan opened his jaw and darkness gathered in a dangerous sphere. After a few seconds, he had amassed enough spiritual energy to completely raze an entire mountain range to the ground.Ziiingggg!As he fired his breath, the surrounding area was suddenly submerged in total darkness. The Cemetery Giant lowered one leg and hid its body behind its shield, but it couldn\u2019t withstand Murakan\u2019s strength.\u201cGuoooo\u2026!\u201dAll it could do was yell one last groan upon death\u2019s door, just as the rest of the Cemetery Giants had done two thousand years ago when facing the dragons.Crumble.As it breathed its last, the Cemetery Giant fell apart into small pieces, and a rain of rubble came down where it was previously standing.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026!\u201dAfter the end of the battle, Murakan returned to his human form and panted intensely. His entire body felt like it was breaking apart as he had used too much power for the first time in a long period.\u2018There\u2019s no way one Cemetery Giant just randomly survived the war until today and stayed undetected. Fuck, I\u2019m sure that the Zipfels are somehow related to this incident. What on earth is happening around the world right now?\u2019After pondering for a short moment, Murakan shook his head.\u2018For now, I shouldn\u2019t tell Jin about this. No matter what happens, I just need to protect him. As long as the kid grows steadily for another ten years\u2026 he\u2019ll be strong enough to face the Zipfels.\u2019***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Koko is addicted to Breath of the Wild\u2026 I need to stop procrastinating\u2026][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is just casually drowning in PR slavery\u2026 nothing new there\u2026]Join our discord to get the latest news and updates about the translations!https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv***The next day, in Bouvard Gaston\u2019s Fragmented Workshop\u2019s underground room.Bouvard was walking in circles and dragging his fat body around; he was anxious enough that he couldn\u2019t stop biting on his thumbnail.Creak.One man entered the room. With a slick coat and a fierce gaze, this stern individual was Vishukel Yvliano.He was the vice-leader of the revolutionary group \u2018Kinzelo\u2019.\u201cL-Lord Vishukel! A problem has occurred! My work of art\u2026 My masterful work of art was\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve already been told about it. The Cemetery Giant was destroyed last night, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIndeed! Urgh, just who would do such an atrocious act\u2026?! How dare they treat my artwork in such a way! Are they looking down on the soul of an artisan?!\u201dVishukel sighed deeply.In order to achieve Kinzelo\u2019s grand objective, this moron who preached about the \u2018soul of an artisan\u2019 was indispensable, and Vishukel found that truth to be unfortunate.\u201cBouvard. Your artisan\u2019s soul isn\u2019t what\u2019s important right now. The Cemetery Giant was destroyed by a dragon last night.\u201d\u201cA-A dragon?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. In fact, it was a dragon that controls shadows. I confirmed it with my own eyes before coming here.\u201dVishukel was extremely anxious and on edge that he was about to go crazy.Kinzelo had prepared their grand masterplan since five hundred years ago.They were finally putting their plan in action, but this incident had suddenly hindered them. Moreover, most active dragons these days were working for the \u2018Zipfels\u2019.Bouvard stopped making a fuss and stared at Vishukel silently.\u201c\u2026That can\u2019t be. Are you saying the dragons have already noticed our movements and plans? Not only that, it was a shadow dragon?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2019s certain for now, but that was definitely a warning from them. I\u2019ll try to have a meeting with the Zipfels sometime soon. In the meantime, make sure you keep an eye on everything that happens in this area. I\u2019ll lend you some useful men to work with.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. Urgh, I can\u2019t believe this\u2026 Ah, speaking of which, Lord Vishukel, have you had breakfast yet? I\u2019d like to have a sweet potato croquette.\u201dVishukel endured the boiling rage inside him and barely answered back.\u201c\u2026Sure, I\u2019ll go buy some, so let\u2019s eat together.\u201d\u201cHehe, that sounds good. I\u2019d like some fresh milk as well.\u201dHe also vowed to himself that he\u2019d murder this sickening fatass with his own hands one day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40 \u2013 Dominating the Intermediate Class[Translator \u2013 Koko just woke up][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is heavily caffeinated]Jin and the Youngest Division\u2019s successful return from their respective missions were the hottest topics within the intermediate class.Nobody had predicted this outcome. Most people believed that while some members of the Youngest Division would return alive, many of them would perish during the mission.However, Jin was the biggest surprise. He had to assassinate the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s lover in Mamit, and no one thought it was achievable.They all thought that Jin would return without completing the mission. No one in the world wants to die at the tender age of 15.\u201cKuhahaha, the flag-bearers who assigned you this mission must be taken aback. I bet they\u2019re fuming right now.\u201dEven Zed was surprised by the success of the mission.He praised Jin in front of the other cadets several times and showed his satisfaction and delight. Every time it happened, the Tona twins shrank back in fear, and the other cadets accepted that Jin had become the new trend of the intermediate class.Yes, the new trend.The members of the Youngest Division were the target of envy from the others. More and more cadets were hoping to join the Youngest Division instead of Myu, Anne, or the Tona twins\u2019 factions.But there was one group of cadets who were grinding their teeth in irritation as they watched this new trend.\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard, some random magician happened to attack the inn where the assassination target was residing on the same day. The damned Young Master Jin has such good luck.\u201d\u201cWhat an unfair world. Not only was he born a Runcandel, he\u2019s also blessed with good fortune? Some of us are only intermediate-class cadets even though we used up all the luck in our lives\u2026 Tch.\u201dThey were the cadets from Myu and Anne\u2019s faction, including Kajin Romello, sitting on the ground and complaining together.Previously, they were at the top of the food chain in this jungle-like intermediate class, but recently, their authority and power had taken a nosedive.The lowly cadets who once used to be wary of them were now sucking up to the Youngest Division, and that annoyed them to death.\u201cIf Young Master Jin or the other brats were exceptionally strong, I\u2019d accept this outcome. But Young Master Jin is only a 4-star knight, and the others are 3-stars! Kajin, are we seriously letting them do as they please?\u201dKajin smiled bitterly and shook his head.\u201cWhat would happen to us if we attempted something? He may be irritating, but Young Master Jin is still a pure-blooded Runcandel. There\u2019s nothing we can do until Ladies Myu and Anne give us ord\u2014\u201dKajin suddenly stopped talking.He noticed that Jin\u2014who was sitting on the other side of the training ground\u2014was suddenly approaching them.\u201c\u2026Why is he\u2014? Did he hear us?\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t. It\u2019s impossible with this distance.\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, I heard everything, my friends.\u201dJin shrugged and spoke as he joined the group. Kajin and the others\u2019 expressions visibly darkened. Despite his shock and surprise, Kajin changed his attitude and let out a soft chuckle.\u201cMy apologies, Young Master Jin. Lowly weaklings like us are only able to rival your mighty strength by talking behind your back like this. Please forgive us for this blunder.\u201dKajin\u2019s sarcastic and arrogant tone surprised his own associates. Even the other cadets in the area who were having their own conversations stopped talking and turned to them, eyes wide open.But the boy in question didn\u2019t think much of Kajin\u2019s words.\u201cI mean, there\u2019s nothing to forgive. I\u2019m not a flag-bearer yet, so strictly speaking, it\u2019s not up to me.\u201d\u201cYou may say that, but can\u2019t you use your authority as a Runcandel to have a lowly cadet like me be whipped as punishment? I shall humbly accept any punishment you are to give me.\u201dThe situation had turned sour, but Kajin hadn\u2019t forgotten that Myu and Anne\u2014who were backing him\u2014had far more authority than Jin.\u201cWhy do you believe that I\u2019d do such a thing?\u201d\u201cBecause of my insolent and disrespectful attitude.\u201dThe other cadets began to gather around them, whispering to each other. Class had ended for the day already, so Zed and the assistant instructors had already left.\u201cHey! Kajin! Watch your tongue when talking to the young master!\u201d\u201cAre you crazy? He\u2019s already overlooked your offense. Don\u2019t push your luck!\u201d\u201cYou guys are the ones who shouldn\u2019t push their luck. I\u2019m the one who\u2019ll get punished, not you bastards. Geez, all of you have grown so much in such a short while. You couldn\u2019t even look me in the eyes until not long ago. Should I consider you guys as part of Young Master Jin\u2019s faction now?\u201dKajin glared at the spectators and they avoided his gaze.He was the apex predator of the intermediate class until Jin arrived.He was one of the most skilled 5-star knights in the class and had the support of Myu and Anne Runcandel. Even the Tona twins couldn\u2019t carelessly talk to Kajin.\u201cWhat a distasteful sight, Kajin.\u201d\u201cYes, I bet it must be distasteful to you, Young Master. But I find it equally unpleasant to watch others respect you for a mission you didn\u2019t accomplish with your own strength. It\u2019s only because you\u2019re a pure-blooded Runcandel that they\u2019re wagging their tails at you.\u201d\u201cThis crazy bastard! Who do you think you\u2019re talking to\u2026!\u201dShling!The onlooking Mesa stepped forward and unsheathed her sword. She was about to leap at Kajin to murder him, but Jin raised his hand and stopped her.\u201cYoung Master! I must kill that insolent bastard today. Even if I die trying, I will definitely cut off an arm at the very least!\u201d\u201cEnough.\u201dMesa hesitated for a moment before putting away her blade.\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve misunderstood me, Kajin. When I said it was a distasteful sight, I wasn\u2019t talking about your sarcastic comments to the others or your insolent attitude towards me.\u201d\u201cHa! Then what is it that you found so distasteful, Young Master?\u201d\u201cAs a 5-star knight, you are one of, if not the most skilled cadet in the intermediate class. You may even be stronger than me. So why do you resort to simple badmouthing behind my back?\u201dShling!This time, Jin unsheathed his sword and aimed it at Kajin.\u201cYou could just slander me right in my face. Was it because you weren\u2019t courageous enough to face me in a fight? I\u2019m pretty certain I said anyone could attack me if they wanted to on my first day here.\u201dKajin raised his head and silently stared at Jin\u2019s eyes.\u201c\u2026Are you certain about this?\u201d\u201cIndeed. Stand up and ready your sword.\u201dJin took a few steps back and prepared his stance. Kajin only stared dumbfounded and the other cadets couldn\u2019t hide their shock and tension.Just why was Young Master Jin doing this?Everyone was asking the same question. While Jin was strong, they all believed that he was still lacking compared to Kajin and that he could never win against the 5-star knight.\u201cNo need to go easy on me. Let\u2019s take this seriously.\u201d\u201cThat sounds like you want me to go all out and even use aura.\u201dKajin stood up and unsheathed his own sword.\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u201cYou will regret this, Young Master. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll be able to take me by surprise and cut my arm off so easily like last time. You will need to go all out in order to even dream of facing me.\u201d\u201cIf I were to go all out, you would never be able to win against me, even in a thousand years.\u201d\u201cWhat an empty bluff!\u201dClang!Kajin was the one to make the first move.He shortened the distance between them in an instant and made use of his superior build to overpower his opponent in a frontal attack. Each sharp swing created deep reverberations which made Jin stagger.\u2018His attacks are all so heavy.\u2019Kajin Romello, 24 years old, 5-star knight.He was only an intermediate cadet in the Runcandel Clan, but in the outside world, he was strong enough that every group and organization around the world would try to recruit him. Even if he left the clan right now, he could easily find a job as a knight and be revered by the public as a respected warrior.Amongst all the people Jin had faced in a duel of swordsmanship, Kajin was the strongest opponent so far, even if you included Jin\u2019s adversaries from his past life.\u2018But compared to the people I\u2019ll be fighting from here on out, this is nothing.\u2019Clang! Clang!As the battle continued, Jin kept retreating as Kajin chased him like a predator. One could easily notice the overflowing malice in Kajin\u2019s eyes as he swung his sword.\u201cKeuk!\u201d\u201cAre you giving up already? Do you finally have a grasp of reality now? You aren\u2019t skilled enough to pick a fight with me, Young Master!\u201dKajin instantly changed his stance and grabbed his sword with both hands. He then enveloped it with aura and swung it with all his might.It was as if he were wielding a warhammer instead of a sword. He had even tilted his sword to strike with the flat of his blade.He was trying to destroy Jin\u2019s guard.Boom!Even though Jin parried the blow, an explosion resonated in the area and Jin barely managed to hold onto his sword.However, his posture was disrupted. It was the same for Kajin, but that was his intention from the start; Kajin had swung with all his might expecting to ruin his stance.Making use of the recoil from his extreme swing, Kajin roundhouse kicked his opponent in the thigh. The shin guards he was wearing amplified the total force and damage.Jin ground his teeth as his thigh throbbed in agony. He didn\u2019t have the time to groan out loud. Kajin had already regained his balance and was making a flurry of attacks.Slit!Kajin\u2019s blade grazed Jin\u2019s forehead, cutting off some of his front hair. Had Jin not leaned his head backwards, his brain would be visible to everyone by now.At that moment, Taimont stood up in a hurry. He was planning on stopping the fight as he feared for the Young Master\u2019s life. However, Mesa stopped him.\u201cDo you think the Young Master will lose?\u201dThe convinced Taimont scratched the back of his head awkwardly and sat back down.By now, all the spectating cadets believed the battle was completely one-sided. Compared to the breathless Jin, Kajin was still swiftly swinging his sword covered in powerful and glaring aura.However, Jin wasn\u2019t retreating out of fear.He was trying to concentrate his mind on a certain sensation.\u2018Just like when I got hit by Haytona\u2019s steel marble\u2026 I can slowly start seeing the trajectories of Kajin\u2019s attacks.\u2019The strange sensation he had felt when he trained with the Clear Stones with his brothers.There are an infinite number of paths a single blade can take when gliding through the air. But for a 5-star knight, there are only so many trajectories they can take with their level of skill.That was especially the case for opponents like Kajin, who was letting rage control his mind and body. Thus, Jin decided to end the fight with the next three moves.He had to provoke Kajin even more to make him use his hidden skills and techniques in case there were any.\u201cI\u2019ve gotten a good grasp of your attacks now. You won\u2019t be able to win against me.\u201d\u201cI see that you\u2019ll continue bluffing to the end, Young Master.\u201dJin only had to dodge the attacks two more times.He believed that Kajin was going to adhere to the attack patterns he had used so far.There was no need to change plans or tactics when it had been useful so far. In fact, now that Jin had provoked him by saying he could read Kajin\u2019s moves, the 5-star knight was never going to change his approach due to his fury and arrogance.But if Jin avoided Kajin\u2019s attacks perfectly two more times, Kajin would have to make a choice.Either he changed tactics with a calm mind, or he used his most powerful attack that Jin wouldn\u2019t be able to evade or block even if he saw it coming.And needless to say, the fight progressed just as Jin had predicted.One left swing followed by an irregular upward slash. Jin didn\u2019t parry those attacks and dodged them perfectly. He spread his feet apart and crouched to avoid the first move, and side-stepped in advance to dodge the second one.During this short exchange, Kajin\u2019s mind was in turmoil. He admitted that Jin could\u2019ve evaded the first left swing. But the boy had dodged the unpredictable upward swing even before Kajin had begun to raise his sword.\u201cTch!\u201dThus, Kajin released all the aura he had to power-up his third attack. Whether Jin had evaded his attacks by reading his moves or through pure coincidence, the boy wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge this one. The human body wasn\u2019t as free and flexible as water.And in the slight chance that Jin did manage to avoid it, his stance would be completely ruined, creating a great opening for Kajin to take advantage of. Therefore, Kajin decided to release a large amount of aura so powerful that no 4-star knight could ever defend from.\u201cThis is\u2014!\u201dThe end!But Kajin couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. Something unexpected had occurred.Jin didn\u2019t try to evade the powerful attack. Instead, he covered his own sword with aura as well and swung it with all his might, receiving the attack head-on.Booom!When the two blades met each other, the one who was pushed back was, surprisingly, Kajin. The 5-star knight had lost to the 4-star.He had been pushed back in a battle of strength. Until seconds ago, he had been overpowering Jin with his bigger build, but Kajin had been overwhelmed this time around.His eyes trembled as he couldn\u2019t hide his shock. The aura covering Bradamante had a colour and glint that was far deeper than that of a 4-star knight.\u201cI also thought it would take me a few more years to reach 5-star.\u201dSwoosh!Jin made use of Kajin\u2019s disarray and bolted before him.Anyone would be in a predicament when facing an opponent who was far stronger than what they had initially expected.Kajin finally realized he had let his guard down when Bradamante\u2019s blade reached his neck.And so, the victor was decided.\u201cDid you\u2026 trick me? To think you were 5-star already\u2026 haha.\u201dKajin spoke in a disheartened voice as his sword fell to the ground.\u201cNo, you just don\u2019t know me well enough. I never fight a battle where I\u2019m not confident of winning.\u201d\u201cWh-What\u2019s going on here?!\u201dTwo individuals came running belatedly to the training grounds; they were the Tona twins, who had heard the news of this fight moments ago.The twins couldn\u2019t hide their astonishment as they saw the two figures standing at the center of the crowd.\u2018H-He defeated Kajin? The youngest actually beat him?!\u2019Jin turned around and sheathed his sword. As he passed by his older brothers with a slow pace, he calmly said,\u201cNothing important.\u201dThe twins felt chills run down their spines and got goosebumps from their little brother\u2019s words.***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Koko just woke up][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is heavily caffeinated]Join our discord to get the latest news and updates about the translations!https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv_______Translator\u2019s Section:So\u2026 nice fight, right?Also, anyone else confused on how Kajin got his arm back? xDThe author didn\u2019t give any details, but he did somehow get it back.But after the PR and I check back on the older chapters, in chapter 20 they say: \u201cAs long as the injuries aren\u2019t fatal\u2014such as amputated limbs or damaged vital organs\u2014the medical team can fully heal the victim in an instant. \u201dSo\u2026 we assume that the medical team just can\u2019t heal amputations\u00a0in an instant.

    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41 \u2013 Enemies In And Out (1)[Translator \u2013 Koko keeps procrastinating][Proofreader \u2013 yuki doesn\u2019t get distracte\u2014SQUIRREL!]A 5-star knight.Jin had predicted that he would take at least three years and five at most in order to reach that stage. In fact, the average Runcandel reached the 5-star stage by the age of 20.However, Jin had defeated the 5-star knight Kajin at the age of 15.While it was true that Kajin had underestimated Jin and had let down his guard, the boy would still win even if they had another duel.\u201cYou\u2026 lost against the youngest?\u201d\u201cHaa, are you seriously going to lie to us? Does that even make sense? The youngest was only a 3-star knight until not long ago. No matter how much of a moron you are, this is just impossible.\u201dMyu and Anne couldn\u2019t believe what they heard from Kajin\u2019s report.This wasn\u2019t a surprising reaction. Jin hadn\u2019t done a surprise attack and Kajin hadn\u2019t given himself a handicap. The 5-star knight had far more experience and physical strength than the Runcandel boy.\u201cI have no excuses.\u201d\u201cOr did you go easy on him since he\u2019s a pure-blooded Runcandel?\u201d\u201cOr did you get bribed by him?\u201d\u201c\u2026That is definitely not the case, Miladies.\u201d\u201cThen what is it? Are you seriously telling me the youngest reached the 5-star stage in such a short amount of time? Do you seriously want us to believe that?\u201d\u201cEveryone else at the training ground can testify for me. His aura was that of a 5-star knight at least.\u201d\u201cHa!\u201dMyu frowned deeply and Anne sneered.\u201cForget it. It\u2019s my fault for having high expectations for someone like you. Get out of my sight.\u201dAs soon as Kajin left the room, the two women stared at each other.\u201cThe youngest is officially baring his fangs against us, isn\u2019t he?\u201dAnne asked her sister.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not just to us. He\u2019s baring his fangs against everyone in the clan. We\u2019ll have to assign him a mission that\u2019s certain to kill him next time\u2026 by sending some of our men as well.\u201d***The Garden of Swords was suddenly in an uproar.The rumour that Jin had defeated Kajin and had officially become the strongest cadet in the intermediate class had spread amongst the servants. However, many amongst them couldn\u2019t believe this story, just like Myu and Anne.That was how unbelievably fast Jin had grown. If you counted all the Runcandels who had become 5-star knights before the age of 16 in the clan\u2019s thousand-year history, there were only three: the first patriarch Temar, Cyron, and Luna.However, the clansmen only knew of his growth in swordsmanship.\u20185-star in swordsmanship, 4-star in magic, and 4-star in spiritual power.\u2019The person in question hadn\u2019t expected to reach the 5-star stage so quickly either.He was simply training with the Clear Stones ever since returning from Mamit, but his aura reached 5-star in no time.During the breaks from the Clear Stone training sessions, he would cover his sword with aura and maintain it as such. And every time, he could sense aura amassing inside his body at an incredible speed.This phenomenon wasn\u2019t happening solely because of Jin\u2019s natural talent for swordsmanship.It was due to the synergy.The synergy between the three powers flowing in his body: spiritual energy, mana, and aura.Ordinary people have never had the chance of using all three types of energies, so they\u2019re unaware of this fact, but Jin noticed that the energies interacted with each other.If one of the powers gets stronger, it influences and strengthens the other two as well. Moreover, the most influential energy amongst the three is spiritual energy.Therefore, due to the \u2018spiritual energy congestion\u2019 Jin had experienced last time, his spiritual energy had increased, strengthening his two other powers as well.In consequence, the channels through which aura and mana flow in his body had increased in number. It was as if Jin had won the lottery without doing a single thing.\u2018Now that I\u2019ve publicly revealed having reached 5-star at the age of 15, my siblings will start getting properly nervous here on out.\u2019Jin had made an incredible accomplishment.However, he wasn\u2019t strong enough to face his siblings yet. Excluding the Tona twins, the other flag-bearers of the clan could easily trample on Jin if they ever had the chance to.It wasn\u2019t just Myu and Anne.There was Joshua, Cyron\u2019s most likely successor, along with Jin\u2019s other older siblings who were aiming to take that position for themselves as well. They now had no choice but to keep an eye on Jin and his growth.The youngest was a thorn in the side of those who were aiming for the position of patriarch.Choosing Barisada during the Selection Ritual could be considered a coincidence. But revealing his true talents and gaining prominence was a completely different story.\u2018It might\u2019ve been a good idea to stay low and hide my talents for now, but no.\u2019Had he revealed his abilities when he was 18, the candidates for the throne would\u2019ve been less wary of him.However, Jin believed that he had benefited far more by doing the reveal today.\u2018From today onwards, people outside of the Runcandel Clan will learn of me\u2014of how I became a 5-star knight at the age of 15. Countless clans and alliances will come and take a look at me out of curiosity and wariness. My siblings won\u2019t be able to move or aim for my life recklessly due to the observant eyes on me.\u2019Moreover, his father\u2014Cyron Runcandel\u2014would most definitely return to the Garden of Swords.He was currently thinking of having someone other than Joshua take over the clan, and was keeping an eye on all his children in the hopes of finding a better successor. Yet, all his children after Luna hadn\u2019t been able to satisfy him a single time.However, the only child whom he was content with\u2014Luna\u2014wasn\u2019t interested in the throne. In fact, she said that she didn\u2019t like this familial conflict and wished to simply observe from the sidelines.Therefore, no matter how strong she was, Cyron judged that Luna wasn\u2019t suited to rule and lead the clan.He then designated his second child Joshua as his provisional successor, as he was the best alternative after Luna. Joshua was suited to lead the clan personality-wise. While he wasn\u2019t extremely satisfactory, he was decisive, level-headed, sharp like a blade, and had a powerful drive.Alternatively, if something ever happened to Joshua, Cyron still had a third option.Cyron\u2019s second son Dipus, his second daughter Luntia, or even his third daughter Mary were decent candidates for the throne as well.That was the order amongst the candidates for the Runcandel throne, which solidified over the years as no one stood out particularly.\u2018But now, there\u2019s me.\u2019With Jin\u2019s arrival, the battlefield for the throne had an upheaval. Cyron was someone who didn\u2019t care about age and gave opportunities to his children according to their accomplishments.\u2018Just like when he sent me on the special mission when I was still in the beginner class, my growth and achievement this time will definitely be reported to father\u2026 And he\u2019ll issue some orders.\u2019Jin predicted that whatever Cyron\u2019s orders were going to be, they would include two things:First was a trial.Cyron would test Jin with the intention of checking whether the boy was able to overcome his age difference with his older siblings who were already candidates for the throne.Second was protection.Having revealed his true abilities, it was inevitable that Jin\u2019s older siblings would start attacking him personally. However, Cyron didn\u2019t want Jin to be trampled on by his siblings before he could even test his youngest child.Jin was a special case. He was just far too young compared to his other siblings, which was why Cyron would exceptionally intervene in his children\u2019s conflict.\u201cGilly.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201d\u201cIn the near future, many important clans and organizations will request a meeting with the Runcandel Clan. They will want to see the new 15-year-old 5-star knight with their own eyes since rumours of the youngest child of the Runcandels will spread throughout the world.\u201dThe Yvliano Clan of swordsmanship, the Ken Clan of spearmanship, the Tuko Clan of hand-to-hand combat, and all the other martial clans would want to see Jin.Even national organizations like the Vermont Empire\u2019s Imperial Guards and Special Forces as well as the Dragon King Knights would send some men. It was the same case for the armed forces around the world like the Hidden Palace, the Black King Mercenaries, and the Ghost Mercenaries.\u201cGeez, look at you, bragging with such a smug face, kid. Do you think they\u2019ve got nothing else to do but to come visit you?\u201d\u201cTo those people, figuring out the changes and trends in the Runcandel Clan is of the utmost importance. They\u2019re all expecting my achievements to bring change to the current hierarchy amongst the candidates for the throne. So they all need to come personally to check on me.\u201dJin was certain about his predictions not only because he was good at reading the political changes in the clan, but also because of a story he had heard from his past life.He had heard that when Luna became a 5-star knight at the age of 15 as well, countless people had gathered at the clan in order to see her. It was like a legend amongst his siblings.\u201cGeez, good for you. Nobody ever cares about a lowly black dragon like me.\u201d\u201cYep. That\u2019s exactly right. Anyways, once the official requests to visit the clan arrive, father will return to the Garden of Swords. He\u2019ll probably start a banquet as well.\u201d\u201cI see. The patriarch will vacate the Black Sea once again. I shall make preparations in advance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll leave that in your care, Gilly. And make sure to keep Murakan hidden away from the public. If he transforms into a human and sneaks into the banquet, we\u2019re done for. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not a kid. I can take care of myse\u2014\u201d\u201cI will bear that in mind.\u201dMurakan glared at Gilly, but the nanny simply avoided making eye contact and looked away.***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Koko keeps procrastinating][Proofreader \u2013 yuki doesn\u2019t get distracte\u2014SQUIRREL!]Join our discord to get the latest news and updates about the translations!https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv***Two days later, the clan began receiving letters regarding the Runcandels\u2019 youngest child just as Jin had predicted.As Jin had never shown himself to the public outside of the clan, the reporters and envoys were desperate to get more information about him.In fact, all that was known about him outside the clan was his age and his 5-star rank.The rich reporters and journalists bribed the servants of the Garden of Swords in order to get some insider information, whereas the skilled ones went to find the receptionist at the Mitel Kingdom\u2019s Transfer Gate and the Black King Mercenaries\u2019 3rd Corps.Those two were the only group of people around the world who had met Jin in person. However, the receptionist was someone who cared for her life and didn\u2019t reveal her clients\u2019 information, while the Black King Mercenaries absolutely detested journalists.Meanwhile, the less skilled reporters\u2014in other words, the naive ones who didn\u2019t know much about the world\u2014thought that the Runcandels had spread a fake rumour in order to gain some attention.\u201cJust what kind of person is Jin Runcandel?\u201dThe reporters were all sighing and groaning to each other.The Garden of Swords wasn\u2019t a place mere reporters could set their foot into. All they could do was wait impatiently as they tried to make use of their connections with other clans; those that had enough influence to enter the Garden of Swords as visitors.And so, another week went by. It was now May 1795.Countless demands and requests to visit the Garden of Swords came rushing to the clan like a broken dam. Everything was going as Jin had predicted.\u201cIt seems the butlers are extremely busy writing replies to all the requests these days, Young Master. When I asked Petro, he mentioned that even the Vermont Imperial Family sent an official letter.\u201d\u201cThe Imperial Family? I didn\u2019t expect that. Those mystics couldn\u2019t hold back their curiosity either, it seems.\u201d\u201cI find it more mystical that you managed to predict the future so accurately, Young Master Jin.\u201dGilly smiled as she felt proud of the boy and continued speaking.\u201cAlso, Guardian Knight Khan returned to the main house today and announced the patriarch\u2019s decision. He will return in one month. The clan is now matching the timing of the visitors with the patriarch\u2019s return.\u201dThe clan was in an uproar both on the inside and outside due to Jin.However, there were no movements or odd actions from his siblings as of yet. They were simply going on missions or training as usual, and it was the same for Jin.But this wasn\u2019t a surprising outcome. Trying to attack or keep Jin in check while the entire clan\u2019s attention was on him was a stupid move.The moment they would try to keep him in check, they would be announcing to the world that they feared and/or detested their youngest sibling. It would cause great damage to their reputation.But it wasn\u2019t as if all his siblings weren\u2019t willing to make this stupid move.\u201cY-Young Master!\u201dThe man who came running to Jin with a distressed expression was Petro, the 2nd butler.As soon as he saw the butler\u2019s face, Jin knew the time had finally come.\u2018Elder Sisters Myu and Anne must\u2019ve schemed something again.\u2019Petro\u2019s entire body was drenched in sweat. It appeared he had run across the enormous Garden of Swords to tell Jin of this urgent news.\u201cTake your time to catch your breath, Petro.\u201d\u201cHaaa, haaa\u2026 Thank you very much. Phew\u2026 You have been assigned a new mission, Young Master. But the place you\u2019ll be dispatched to is\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere is it?\u201d\u201cThe Kollon Ruins.\u201d\u201cHa! The Kollon Ruins? Young Master, the flag-bearers have gone too far this time. The Kollon Ruins are in Zipfel territory!\u201d\u201cThat is correct\u2026 The flag-bearers have gone too far. Thus, Madame Rosa has become enraged. She has already summoned the flag-bearers to admonish them. I believe Young Master Jin should go see Madame Rosa as well.\u201dJin calmly nodded and began making his way to the main building.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42 \u2013 Enemies In And Out (2)[Translator \u2013 Koko is hungry][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is also hungry]There were a total of five flag-bearers who came running to the main building with Rosa\u2019s summons.They were the third son Ran, the fourth son Vigo, the fourth daughter Myu, the fifth daughter Anne, and finally, the second daughter Luntia.Rosa made them stand straight in a single file and glared at them with a dark, heavy gaze. The flurry of shouts and reprimands she had been hurling at them had calmed down a bit.But once Jin entered the room, she raised her voice again.\u201cHow can you people who call themselves \u2018flag-bearers\u2019 mess up so badly?!\u201dAs Rosa let out a thunderous roar, the documents and pen holder on her table went flying in all four directions. In fact, the pen holder cracked and broke apart due to the energy in her voice.Haaaaa\u2026!She let out a deep sigh and turned to Jin.\u201c\u2026You\u2019ve arrived.\u201d\u201cYes, Mother.\u201dHis siblings\u2019 attention turned to him as well.Ran and Vigo\u2019s gazes were dyed in annoyance and irritation. Their reactions were natural as they weren\u2019t involved in the issuing of his mission.Myu and Anne were openly showing their animosity towards Jin.Their lips were curled upwards, but their pupils were dyed red in bloodthirst, as if they were warning him they\u2019d kill him if they ever had the chance.Meanwhile, Luntia had a calm bearing. She was merely curious to know if her youngest sibling\u2014whom she hadn\u2019t seen in a long while\u2014was truly a 5-star knight as the rumours said.\u201cHave you heard of the news? Your next mission will be at the Kollon Ruins.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been told.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m cancelling that mission. You won\u2019t be going to Kollon.\u201d\u201c\u201cMother!\u201d\u201dMyu and Anne raised their voices simultaneously and took a couple of steps forward.\u201cYou wenches only care about killing the youngest, don\u2019t you? Did gaining the petty authority and power of a flag-bearer grant you nonexistent balls to stand against your mother?\u201dRosa looked down at her daughters with ice-cold eyes.However, the two daughters didn\u2019t let themselves get intimidated.\u201cMother, is it really so strange that we\u2019re trying to kill the youngest?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I cannot understand why you try to protect the youngest so much.\u201dMyu stared at her mother in the eyes.\u201cGo on, I dare you to continue yapping with that piehole. Have you lost your mind?\u201d\u201cEver since we were born, you have merely watched us from the sidelines with father and even encouraged us to fight amongst each other, Mother. Was that not because competition is a necessity in our family?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s right, Mother. In fact, you must know how much everyone here has been oppressed and pressured by our older siblings while growing up. Back when I was in the intermediate class, I was also sent on highly difficult missions assigned to me by my older siblings! Dozens of times!\u201dA moment of silence followed.Myu and Anne weren\u2019t completely in the wrong. Conflict and secret harassment between siblings in the Runcandel Clan was inevitable. In fact, it was the fate of all Runcandel children. Moreover, Cyron and Rosa never intervened to stop the bloodbath occurring amongst their children.\u201cIndeed, you two aren\u2019t wrong. Competition is necessary, and you can use whatever means at your disposal to come out on top.\u201dRosa spoke with a soft smile. Myu and Anne understood their mother\u2019s intentions.\u201cBe that as it may, did you two reach the 5-star stage by the age of 15?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cYou two are different compared to the youngest. Had you two made the same achievements as him in your teenage years, I would\u2019ve protected you as well. However, you didn\u2019t.\u201dRosa openly revealed that she was giving Jin preferential treatment.\u201cIn other words, you two weren\u2019t worthy of my protection and care. As a matter of fact, seeing how you two are now insolently talking back to me after becoming flag-bearers, I don\u2019t regret never having protected you two.\u201dMyu and Anne\u2019s faces distorted as they blinked, dumbfounded.No matter how harsh of an environment the clan was and how cruel one\u2019s siblings were, every child in the world would be hurt after hearing such heart-wrenching words from their parents.\u201c\u2026Haa, you are correct, Mother. I was being insensible and naive.\u201d\u201cThank you for your guidance, Mother.\u201dThe two girls lowered their heads and turned around, exiting the room. Despite having turned their backs to Jin, their burning rage and hatred towards their youngest sibling could be distinguished more than ever.\u201cLuntia, Ran, Vigo.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201cAs Myu and Anne\u2019s fellow flag-bearers, you three aren\u2019t guilt-free either. Especially you, Luntia. I\u2019m very disappointed in you. You will need to reflect on your oversight for a while. Ran and Vigo, return one of your swords each.\u201dLuntia merely shrugged and went along with it, whereas Ran and Vigo protested.\u201cM-Mother? Y-You want us to return a sword?\u201d\u201cAre you dissatisfied? You should be glad it\u2019s only one sword. I personally would\u2019ve preferred confiscating all the invaluable swords you two took from the clan\u2019s armory, so be grateful I didn\u2019t do that.\u201dThe brothers couldn\u2019t say anything in return and lowered their heads. Ran and Vigo felt like they were being framed for a crime they hadn\u2019t committed, and obviously enough, their frustration and anger diverted to Jin.\u2018Our family is so messed up. Things are getting troublesome.\u2019Jin discreetly clicked his tongue and thought to himself.Rosa Runcandel.Was she truly rebuking the flag-bearers out of love for Jin?Jin was certain that it wasn\u2019t the case.\u2018Mother\u2026 wants me to clash with my siblings far more fiercely and violently. She purposefully summoned Elder Sister Luntia and Elder Brothers Ran and Vigo\u2014even though they\u2019re unrelated to this incident\u2014in order to have them develop animosity towards me.\u2019Correct.Rosa had summoned three other flag-bearers in addition to Myu and Anne in order to test Jin.To be more precise, she was testing every single child in this room.She wanted to see how far she could push her children, and whether they\u2019d persistently try to tear each other apart.\u2018I wonder how the youngest will pull through this situation. He\u2019s a smart boy, so I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t act conceited from here on out just because he thinks I\u2019m favouring him\u2026 So what\u00a0will\u00a0he do?\u2019Rosa asked herself. She was excited and curious, but made sure to maintain the furious expression on her face.Would he pretend to defend his siblings and tell her to punish him instead?If he simply stood there with a content smile for having his mother on his side, then that was the end of it. While Jin was a rare genius for reaching 5-star at 15 years old, if that was the extent of his reaction and intelligence, then Rosa was planning on erasing all her interest in her youngest son immediately.Needless to say, even if she were disappointed, he would still be her beloved youngest son. He would just be eliminated from the list of candidates for the succession.If Jin did nothing when she gave him an advantage, Rosa would judge that he wasn\u2019t suited to lead the Runcandel clan.\u201cMother.\u201d\u201cSpeak freely, Jin.\u201dRosa spoke in a low tone, hiding her excitement.\u201cI quite like the mission Elder Sisters assigned to me.\u201d\u201cDo you even know where the Kollon Ruins are?\u201dRosa sneered.\u201cYes. It\u2019s in Zipfel territory, and the Runcandels once tried to invade and capture it, but failed to do so. It happened long before I was born, though.\u201d\u201cSo you are aware. Back then, Elder Tellot went to battle with thirty guardian knights but faced a predicament. It\u2019s now a tourist spot, but the Zipfels are still greatly involved with it. You won\u2019t be able to do anything even if you go there.\u201dThe mission that was assigned to Jin was \u2018theft\u2019.He had to steal some of the ancient relics the Zipfels were excavating from the Kollon Ruins. Jin hadn\u2019t checked the list of items he had to steal yet, but there were probably at least three relics on it.\u201cWe can\u2019t verify that if I don\u2019t head there. While it\u2019s a dangerous place, I do not believe it\u2019s an unreasonable mission. Don\u2019t you think Elder Sisters assigned this mission to me as they believed I was skilled enough for it?\u201d\u201cWhat reckless bravado. That, or you\u2019re trying to test your mother.\u201dReckless bravado.It wasn\u2019t a bad reaction, but it wasn\u2019t what Rosa was hoping for.\u201cMoreover, if we suddenly change the issuing of the mission, we will be showing our clansmen how lax and careless our clan\u2019s system is.\u201d\u201cNo clansmen would question the Runcandels just because of something like that. Your sisters were simply trying to harm you. And since they couldn\u2019t attack you physically, they took advantage of their authority as flag-bearers.\u201d\u201cThat is exactly what I mean, Mother.\u201dJin grinned brightly.\u201cI do not plan on backing away from this fight. If I were to duel Elder Sisters right here, right now, I will definitely lose miserably. However, if I successfully accomplish my mission, I would be able to deal them a powerful blow.\u201dRosa\u2019s eyes glittered.\u201cIn other words, I have a slight chance of winning this fight. I know it would be wiser for me to back away now, develop my strength, and defeat them in a duel in a few years\u2026 But I simply cannot wait that long, as Elder Sisters are getting on my nerves.\u201d\u201cYou could easily die at the Kollon Ruins with the smallest of mistakes. Are you really confident in yourself?\u201d\u201cYes. And if I return successfully from the mission, I\u2019d like to be awarded the swords that were confiscated from Elder Brothers. Since you judged this mission to be extremely dangerous, Mother, I wish to be rewarded according to the amount of risk I took.\u201d\u201c\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u201dRan and Vigo spontaneously glared at Jin, whereas Rosa hid her delighted smile.The youngest was provoking his older siblings just as she had hoped for, as if he had read her mind.\u201cBrother, why are you saying you\u2019d like to take the swords we\u2019re returning\u2014\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll allow it.\u201dRosa interrupted Vigo\u2019s remark.Nevertheless, Ran sighed deeply before giving a piece of his own mind.\u201cIf you desire to gain some top-notch swords, I can simply give you one of the weapons I own. But give up on this mission. Your achievements have spread around the world already, so you must remain alive until father returns to the Garden.\u201dIf Cyron returned to the Garden of Swords in one month and Jin wasn\u2019t present, then all the guests who came to visit the Runcandel Clan would be disappointed.Thus, people would raise suspicions and say that the 5-star 15-year-old knight was a false rumour started by the Runcandels. Some would even believe that the clan tried to cover up the false rumour by saying the child had died on a mission right before the visit.Ran acted as if he were worried about this outcome, but Jin tilted his head in confusion.\u201cYou\u2019re being hypocritical, Elder Brother Ran. If that were such an important problem you were wary of, you should\u2019ve stopped Elder Sisters from assigning this mission to me in the first place.\u201dRan was pretending to be generous and kind-hearted, but Jin didn\u2019t buy it. Ran and Vigo hadn\u2019t opposed Myu and Anne when they decided to assign the Kollon Ruins mission to Jin.Jin could see that Ran was blatantly acting broad-minded in order to gain their mother\u2019s approval.\u201cHahaha\u2026 That must be quite humiliating, Ran. You should\u2019ve stayed silent like your elder sister instead.\u201dRan couldn\u2019t stop his ears from turning bright red as their mother laughed.\u201cI\u2019m quite curious to know whether the youngest will be able to steal his brothers\u2019 swords now. I\u2019ll be watching carefully to see whether it was just an empty provocation, or whether he\u2019ll be able to make it a reality. You may all take your leave now.\u201dOnce all her children left the room, Rosa propped her chin on her hand.\u2018\u2026I trampled on the others\u2019 pride so that the youngest doesn\u2019t turn out like Luna, but it seems that was unnecessary.\u2019The youngest seemed to be famished for conflict. Today, it was a verbal battle and not a physical one, but he had completely dominated the flow of the conversation, overwhelming his siblings who were several years older than him.\u2018Cyron will be happy to see the youngest\u2019s growth so far when he\u2019s back.\u2019Of course, such a thing wouldn\u2019t happen if Jin didn\u2019t return alive from the Kollon Ruins.As soon as they exited the building, Ran and Vigo immediately returned to their rooms. Luntia hesitated to talk with the youngest for a bit, but simply returned to her room as if she couldn\u2019t be bothered to do so.\u201cDo you actually think you\u2019ll be so lucky this time around as well?\u201dMyu spoke up without even looking her brother in the eyes. She and Anne were standing against the wall, waiting for him to come out.\u201cWho knows? Elder Sisters might not know this well, but I\u2019m actually pretty unlucky in life.\u201d\u201cThis is the last time you\u2019ll ever act so easygoing. The mission isn\u2019t a solo mission. You won\u2019t be feeling so lonely on your way to your destination.\u201d\u201cHaha, thank you for your concern, Elder Sisters. Well then, I shall see you another time.\u201dThe two women glared at the boy\u2019s back as he strided away until he disappeared from their sights.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43 \u2013 An Unexpected Incident(1)[Translator \u2013 Koko has bad stomach ache today][Proofreader \u2013 yuki\u2019s back hurts]There were three other cadets who were assigned the Kollon Ruins mission alongside Jin.Kajin Romello, Mayl Hass, and Rima Hass. All three were part of Myu and Anne\u2019s faction. The Hass brothers were slightly weaker than Kajin, but were still bona fide 5-star knights.\u201cYoung Master. Allow me to apologize for my transgression a few days ago. I will make sure not to disappoint you anymore during the upcoming mission.\u201d\u201cIt is an honour to be given the chance to work alongside Young Master Jin.\u201dThe day before their departure, Kajin and the Hass brothers came to find Jin.Their behaviour had made a full 180 compared to a few days ago. Their sarcastic remarks had completely vanished and had been replaced by courteous and submissive attitudes.Jin wore a wide smile to show his satisfaction.\u201cIndeed, the past is in the past. Let\u2019s turn the page now. I\u2019ll be in your care from here on out.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Young Master.\u201d\u201cThank you very much!\u201dOnce the three of them left the room, Murakan leaped onto Jin\u2019s lap.\u201cIt\u2019s because they kept talking behind my back without having the courage to confront me that they were abandoned by Elder Sisters. Sending those three to the Kollon Ruins is basically being sent to die\u2026 Backstabbing me during the mission must be their desperate last-ditch effort.\u201dJin was sure of himself.Myu and Anne. Those sly foxes must\u2019ve ordered their lackeys to kill Jin during the mission. He was also certain that his sisters had promised to look after their family if they successfully killed Jin and also died bravely on the battlefield.The boy had witnessed Myu and Anne deal with people using this exact same method in his past life countless times.\u201cMeow~\u201dThe cat sitting on his lap laughed out loud.***They had to use a transfer gate and travel on land to reach the Kollon Ruins.The Kollon Ruins originally had around a couple of thousands of natives living in villages. However, the Zipfels discovered the land several hundreds of years ago and took control of the area, so the ruins became a part of the Peylon Kingdom.Afterwards, most of the natives were slaughtered and the survivors were enslaved. The descendants of the natives who are still living in Kollon to this day appear to be respected by the Zipfels, but they gnash their teeth at the clan of magicians.However, there was nothing the descendants could do.While they appeared respected, they were still slaves. Moreover, the rest of the world didn\u2019t really care about the lives and rights of the Kollon natives.The Zipfels spared the descendents and allowed them to remain in Kollon with the excuse of preserving the land in its original state. However, it was all an act where they were trying to redeem themselves from their horrible past deeds.As he thought about this sad truth, Jin frowned deeply.\u2018The weak being trampled on by the strong is a common occurrence around the world, but the Zipfels really went too far back then.\u2019Originally, the Zipfels weren\u2019t the type to commit such massacres.They normally prefer to conquer new lands peacefully and reasonably, while trying to gain the natural respect and loyalty of the conquered. The Zipfels were far more advanced in terms of their public image and relations compared to the Runcandels.In fact, ruling by force was the Runcandels\u2019 style.If so, why did the Zipfels suppress the Kollon natives in such a violent and cruel way back then?Jin knew the answer to this question.\u2018It was because of the mirror-like artifact the natives hid away. The Zipfels had some vague knowledge of this artifact when they discovered the island. So they trampled on the natives in order to find it.\u2019Currently, the existence of this \u2018ancient mirror\u2019 was top secret information that hadn\u2019t spread outside of the Zipfel Clan.However, before Jin\u2019s regression, the entire world came to know of this mirror by the time he was 27. One brave journalist wrote an article about this ancient artifact the Zipfels had recently found.The journalist even recorded the details of the artifact\u2019s excavation site. The natives who bore a grudge against the Zipfels informed the journalist about how the clan had robbed them of their divine artifact and the history of the oppression.\u2018Later on, people started calling that mirror the Fountain of Mana.\u2019The mirror artifact\u2014the Fountain of Mana\u2014had a simple yet terrifying effect.It could increase your mana just by staring into it. Needless to say, there were some extreme side effects, but the artifact\u2019s value and benefits were still considerable even when taking those into account.The limit of the increase in mana using the Fountain was up to 7-star.Thanks to the item, the Zipfels were able to nurture and develop countless 7-star magicians as if they were a factory. And once these \u2018mass-produced magicians\u2019 made their appearance in the world, numerous aspirants aiming to become magicians joined their clan.Thus, the already-powerful Zipfel Clan began leaving the Runcandels behind in the dust and solidified their standing on the continent while putting pressure on their enemy clan of swordsmen.\u2018This time, I won\u2019t let those Zipfel bastards get the mirror in their hands.\u2019As one would expect, he wasn\u2019t planning on stealing the artifact while oppressing the natives like the Zipfels had done. However, for the price of suppressing the natives for several hundreds of years, he was planning on stopping the Zipfels from gaining more power using the Fountain.There was no need to hurry. According to his knowledge from his past life, the Zipfels needed another ten years or more in order to find the mirror. Thus, Jin only needed to steal it before that day came.\u201cWe will arrive soon, Young Master.\u201dJin\u2019s strides came to a halt. They were walking down a mountainous road in disguises and masks.\u201cThis place is the Zipfel magicians\u2019 lodgings. This one is for independent magicians. And the relics we must find are here, in the third warehouse.\u201dKajin spread open a map of the Kollon Ruins and pointed at each vital location.\u201cAre you certain that the items are in the 3rd warehouse?\u201d\u201cWe must hope so. If it isn\u2019t the case, then our chances at succeeding this mission will drop to zero.\u201dThere were a total of four relics they had to steal: three slabs of stones the size of their palms, and one bronze bowl.They were worthless items for most people, but for historians, these items were far more valuable than gold.The cadets had to sneak inside the warehouse, steal the relics, and return to the clan.Sneaking inside the warehouse wasn\u2019t such a difficult task. The 3rd warehouse didn\u2019t contain precious artifacts, so the security was lax. In fact, the warehouse was open to visitors during the day.However, the problem was returning safely to the clan.\u2018No matter how worthless the items in the warehouse are, I\u2019m certain there\u2019ll be several layers of protective barriers around the building. It\u2019s almost impossible to enter the warehouse without getting detected with our current party.\u2019The Zipfel magicians weren\u2019t pushovers. If the 3rd warehouse was attacked, they\u2019d be dispatched and would arrive within five minutes. Obviously, they\u2019d also capture and punish all intruders.\u201cDue to the rich and curious historians making a request to the clan, it seems the four of us may die tonight trying to complete our tasks.\u201d\u201cNo matter what happens, the three of us will lay our lives down to protect you, Young Master.\u201dKajin spoke with resolute eyes and the Hass brothers nodded with determined looks.Their acting was pitiful. As he chuckled in his mind, Jin took out some beef jerky from his pocket.\u201cLaying your lives down to protect me\u2026 That\u2019s good to hear. Have some jerky and rest for a bit. We\u2019ll commence the operation in an hour.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201d\u201dThe three cadets eagerly received the jerky.Chomp, munch, nibble, chew, gulp.As soon as he saw them swallow their food, Jin immediately spat out the jerky he was chewing on.\u201cYoung Master? Eh? Huhh\u2026\u201dThe three of them realized that something was wrong, but it was already too late.The jerky was coated with a sleep-inducing drug that could make even a 7-star knight fall asleep in a couple of seconds. Kajin and the Hass brothers were already feeling drowsy and were barely staying standing.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It wasn\u2019t poisoned.\u201d\u201cWh-What are youuuuu\u2026\u201d\u201cYou c-cannn\u2019t\u2026\u201dThump, flop, thud.All three fell over, entering the dreamland. Jin dug a hole in the ground and pushed them inside, and proceeded to cover up the hole with leaves.They were unlikely to wake up for another 24 hours. And when they did, the mission would already be finished.\u201c\u2018You c-cannn\u2019t\u2019, he said. As if I could keep traitors who were planning on backstabbing me by my side when entering enemy territory.\u201dIn fact, had they not acted so polite, Jin would\u2019ve been less suspicious of them.However, during their entire trip here, the three cadets were constantly currying favours with Jin. They were planning on having Jin let down his guard, and when the opportunity arose, they\u2019d slice his throat with no hesitation.But Jin had seen through their utterly predictable strategy.It wasn\u2019t as if he couldn\u2019t understand and sympathize with those three. It was normal for a dog to follow its owner\u2019s orders, especially when they were facing a crisis after having made several mistakes.However, they had chosen the worst opponent. As he was living in the Runcandel Clan for the second time, Jin could not be tricked by his elder sisters\u2019 sloppy schemes.\u2018Moreover, I can\u2019t use magic or spiritual power while these three are watching me.\u2019Brazenly attacking the warehouse while being fully aware of the magic barrier protecting it was suicide if Jin didn\u2019t use magic or spiritual power.If the four of them tried to infiltrate the warehouse, the spell would definitely detect them. However, it was a different story if Jin sneaked in alone.\u2018Well then, shall we get going?\u2019Jin wore his mask properly and headed down the mountain road. The evening breeze blowing between the trees and branches was refreshing.The Kollon Ruins were shaped like an enormous ellipse.The important excavation site was located at the center, whereas the 3rd warehouse was on the outskirts. It was now 6 PM, and the ruins had closed. The path to the warehouse\u2019s entrance was quiet and dull.Jin lay down on the grass in the forest from where he could see the 3rd warehouse. As he observed the area, he noticed people walking by from time to time. They were magicians dispatched here to investigate the ruins. Fortunately, Jin couldn\u2019t see anyone at the 5-star stage or above.Additionally, the guards standing by the warehouse\u2019s main and back entrances weren\u2019t magicians, just as Jin had predicted. They seemed to be 1-star or 2-star warriors at best.This didn\u2019t come as a surprise. They had no need to assign magicians\u2014expensive and valuable manpower\u2014just to guard a warehouse of little importance.The guards seemed bored and kept yawning as they waited for time to pass. They even joked between each other at times, laughing and chuckling.Once the magicians in the area were at a proper distance, Jin dashed towards the warehouse\u2019s main entrance.\u201cSo remember that girl I met last night?\u201d\u201cOh yeah, how far did you two go? Hm? C\u2019mon, spill the beans!\u201d\u201cGeez, should I really say it? You might punch me out of jealousy, lmao. Oh well, so what happened is\u2014\u201dKurgh.One mercenary fainted after taking Jin\u2019s punch to the chin. The other guard who was waiting for the rest of the story immediately thrust his spear towards the intruder.Jin swiftly turned around and avoided the spearhead, and used his momentum to jab his opponent in the throat with his elbow. The second mercenary\u2019s eyes lost their focus and flopped onto the ground.\u2018Maybe I should\u2019ve waited for him to end the story before attacking them\u2026\u2019Jin chuckled before picking up the two unconscious bodies, got them on their feet, and leaned them against the wall. By sticking the spears between their legs, they could somehow stay upright. This way, they appeared to be properly standing guard from afar.Jin rummaged through their pockets and found the keys to the warehouse door. The lock on the door was an ordinary one without any spells protecting it. That was how much the Zipfels didn\u2019t care about the 3rd warehouse.\u2018No wonder the historians fearlessly requested the Runcandels to rob these relics.\u2019Creaaaak!There was no way of repressing the sound of the metal door grinding open. Jin hesitated to use some noise-cancelling or noise-reduction magic spells, but decided not to. If there were a magician nearby, the chances of his mana getting detected were high.Before entering the warehouse, Jin observed the interior. After a short while, he noticed a certain familiar magic circle on the floor right in front of the door.\u2018Isn\u2019t this the Magic Circle of Blood and Barrier?\u2019It was the same magic circle as the one he had seen several years ago, when he first sneaked inside the underground chambers beneath the Storm Castle. By dropping a few droplets of human blood on it, he could easily neutralize the effects of the circle.The defensive magic circle protecting an unimportant Zipfel warehouse was the same as the one protecting a secret chamber only the Runcandel flag-bearers could enter. If the public ever came to learn of this truth, the clan of swordsmen would become a laughingstock.The Magic Circle of Blood and Barrier can recognize the blood of a human, a monster, or a plague-stricken human. As long as it was someone healthy, the blood of any human was enough to neutralize it.Jin approached the unconscious yet standing mercenaries again. He then used his dagger to lightly cut the tip of one\u2019s finger and caught a few drops of blood with his palm. Afterwards, he sprinkled the blood onto the magic circle.Jin had used the mercenary\u2019s blood in order to avoid getting caught after he accomplished his mission. If the Zipfels came to investigate the intrusion, they might believe that the magic circle had been neutralized due to the mercenaries\u2019 mistake.\u2018The first protective spell was easily dealt with. Let\u2019s search for the relics now\u2014\u2019Kiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!Suddenly, the magic circle glowed bright red and let out a sharp squeal. The flustered Jin flinched in panic, but soon calmed down and looked back at the bloodstain on his palm.The stain had been made using the unconscious mercenary\u2019s blood. In other words, it was definitely human blood.Nevertheless, the Magic Circle of Blood and Barrier had reacted to it. In other words, either the mercenary was currently afflicted by the plague\u2026\u201cKrrrrrr.\u201dOr the mercenary\u2026 wasn\u2019t a human.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44 \u2013 An Unexpected Incident (2)[Translator \u2013 Koko didn\u2019t sleep last night\u2026 I\u2019m so tired][Proofreader \u2013 yuki doesn\u2019t know what sleep is\u2026 want some coffee?]\u2018What the fu\u2014!\u2019Jin abruptly turned around and unsheathed his dagger.The unconscious mercenaries were regaining control over their body.\u2018Their eyes are red?\u2019Moreover, the two of them were growling like beasts and breathing heavily inconsistently. It sounded almost like the breathing pattern of an orc or a troll.Jin had no time to ask himself how this had happened.The steel armours of these ex-human mercenaries were inflating. The rapidly swelling muscles on the inside were tearing the metal apart.Crack!The moment the armour tore apart, Jin reflexively cast a spell.\u2018Silent Wind!\u2019A gust of mana instantly engulfed the inside of the warehouse and formed a thin hemispherical layer.It was a 4-star spell that reduced all noises in a radius of 15 meters. Jin had decided not to use magic earlier as he didn\u2019t want to risk getting detected by the magicians in the area, but the situation had changed.He couldn\u2019t avoid fighting the mercenaries who had transformed into monsters. They were already reaching their hands out towards Jin. Their fingers had grown sharp and long claws, just like those of the Red Tiger Tribe.\u2018I can only hope the magicians out there don\u2019t notice us.\u2019Krawwr!His two enemies were already pouncing towards him simultaneously.Jin didn\u2019t even have time to unsheathe Bradamante. The monsters were swinging their arms one after another, taking turns so that their target had no time to breathe.Swish!The claws sharply tore the air as they drew arcs. Jin narrowly dodged the attacks by crouching down, and stabbed one of the monsters in the ribs with his dagger.He had aimed at the heart, but the monster had barely managed to avoid getting killed by twisting its body. However, Jin definitely felt the sensation of flesh being torn and bones breaking.\u201cGraah!\u201dThe monster let out a horrible shriek.It didn\u2019t appear to be a fatal injury. The monster didn\u2019t bother removing the dagger in its torso and continued swinging its claws.Fortunately, Jin made use of this short breather to create some distance between them and unsheathed Bradamante. As he hurriedly enveloped the blade in aura, the dark warehouse was brightened up a little.The monsters seemed to have sensed that aura was a dangerous power. As Jin adjusted the distance between them while keeping his sword straight, the black fur covering the monsters\u2019 bodies stood on end.\u201cKrrrr\u2026!\u201d\u201cKraaagh.\u201dThe wounded monster belatedly removed the dagger in its chest.Seeing what happened afterwards, Jin couldn\u2019t help but let his face show his shock.\u2018They can even regenerate?\u2019The monster\u2019s deep gash in its chest was rapidly healing and closing. The dark red blood quickly stopped gushing out after a couple of seconds.This sort of high-speed regeneration could only be seen in high-ranking and powerful monsters.However, Jin\u2019s opponents weren\u2019t your typical, naturally born monsters. These enemies were undoubtedly humans even a minute ago.With every passing second, all sorts of thoughts and hypotheses passed through Jin\u2019s mind. However, he didn\u2019t have the necessary knowledge to understand exactly how this mysterious and freaky incident had happened.He had never seen anything like this in his total 43 years of life.Fortunately, while he couldn\u2019t understand how it had happened, Jin could somewhat grasp the fundamentals behind it, thanks to his life as a magician in his past life.\u2018It\u2019s highly likely these are living golems created through forbidden magic. Those Zipfel bastards\u2026 Are they using the Kollon Ruins as an experimental facility for forbidden magic?\u2019Swoosh!The monsters resumed their flurry of attacks.Jin could only narrowly evade the attacks earlier as he was taken by surprise, but now that he had regained his calm, his enemies\u2019 movements appeared clumsy. They had the strength and speed of low-leveled 4-star fighters.However, there was a vast difference between a trained 4-star knight and monsters that only had 4-star physical abilities. Jin easily parried and dodged the monsters\u2019 claws and counterattacked.\u2018It\u2019s not too difficult facing them.\u2019Whenever Jin made a feint or moved irregularly, the monsters fell for it each time. He could see their feet getting tangled up, resulting in the monsters losing their balance.\u2018There are three places the core could be located: the heart, head, or lower abdomen.\u2019When it comes to these magical weapons called golems, they never stop moving no matter how much they get wrecked. In fact, Jin had sliced one of the monsters\u2019 wrist and shoulder, yet there was no change in its behaviour.On the other hand, if their cores get destroyed, it\u2019s over for them. This was the case even for these living golems that were made with forbidden magic.Stab!Jin backstepped and changed his attack pattern, easily piercing one in the head. The aura surrounding his sword was spinning rapidly, so there was a large hole the size of a fist in the monster\u2019s head.\u2018So it\u2019s not the head.\u2019Had Jin fought like he was facing humans, he would\u2019ve been in a predicament just now. After inflicting a deadly blow to one of the enemies, most fighters would have shifted their focus on the remaining foe.However, the golem with a hole in its head continued swiping its claws. Its speed and power hadn\u2019t been affected a single bit. Rather, it became more violent and aggressive.Jin spun around to dodge the attacks and thrust his sword again, this time in the lower abdomen.But this time, he raised his arm with the blade until he reached the heart. This sort of attack would\u2019ve been nigh-impossible for ordinary people. It was at times like this when Jin was grateful for his Runcandel bloodline for giving him a blessed body with superhuman strength.Scriieaakch!The disgusting sound of the monster\u2019s flesh ripping apart and its rib cage shattering echoed. Once he retracted his blade, Jin realized that the core was located at the heart.Instead of an actual beating heart, there was a ball of blue mana at the center of the chest.However, it was a completely different-looking core than what Jin was familiar with. Instead of mana, it almost looked like a big glass marble filled with some blue liquid.Moreover, it was incomparably harder than what a normal human\u2019s heart was supposed to be. Through the recoil Jin felt when cutting the core apart, he realized that he had barely managed to break it despite the 5-star aura covering his sword.Pfffcht!The solid-looking ball of mana burst and a terrible stench spread in the air.The dead monster was now slowly\u2026 slowly transforming back into a human. It couldn\u2019t turn back into its previous form perfectly, as the swollen skin and ripped muscles were irreversible.Nevertheless, the shrivelled up corpse on the ground was undoubtedly that of a human.As soon as he saw that, a complicated sentiment grew within Jin, and rage suddenly began boiling in his heart.\u2018How dare they do something like this to a fellow human being\u2026\u2019Rage towards the Zipfels.The remaining monster pounced on Jin as if in response to the boy\u2019s anger. Jin had yet to fix his posture after finishing off the first foe.Screeee!Its claws slammed and scratched against Bradamante, creating an unpleasant sound. Jin placed his right foot back and pushed with all his strength to stand his ground.His foe\u2019s claws weren\u2019t as tough as Bradamante\u2019s blade. While it seemed stronger than ordinary steel, it couldn\u2019t compare to the blade of a powerful, ancient sword from thousands of years ago.Crack!As the two opponents clashed, five claws broke away, disrupting the power balance. The monster lost its footing and fell face-first to the floor.Jin stamped on the back of its head and stabbed it in the heart from above.He felt the solid ball of mana break at the tip of his sword. The fallen monster\u2019s body trembled, and soon enough, it returned to its human form as well.\u201cPhew.\u201dOnly then could Jin finally sigh and relax. He looked at his surroundings and saw that the floor was drenched in the monsters\u2019 dark red blood. The Silent Wind spell he had cast earlier was still present.Fortunately, it seemed the magicians in the area hadn\u2019t sensed the usage of magic.\u201cK-Ki\u2026\u201dJin suddenly heard a voice. It came from the fallen monster\u2026 no, from the human writhing on the floor.\u201cKill\u2026 me\u2026\u201dHe hurriedly crouched down and examined the second victim. Surprisingly, he was still breathing. Barely, but breathing. However, he still had a somewhat inhuman appearance.It was obvious their entire bodies had swollen and torn beyond their limits. Jin soon came to the conclusion that he couldn\u2019t be saved.He had countless questions to ask. How and why had they become living golems, who was behind this, how they had become the Zipfels\u2019 experimental subjects.However, the mercenary had no strength left to speak. All Jin could do was liberate him from the pain and agony.Stab.Jin pierced the man in his disturbingly skinny neck, and the victim closed his eyes peacefully.Jin also closed his eyes for a moment and lifted his head.He did not know of their circumstances, but no human in the world wished to become a living golem willingly.Especially if they were made to transform into monsters and were treated as expendables.A flame burned in Jin\u2019s eyes as he ground his teeth.But this wasn\u2019t the moment to lose his cool.An unexpected incident had occurred, through which Jin witnessed the horrible acts committed by the Zipfels behind the scenes. And now, Jin was suspicious of his elder sisters, wondering if they were aware of this truth when sending him on this mission.However, he still had a task to complete.He couldn\u2019t just go back home and tell his siblings \u2018I couldn\u2019t finish the mission because a monster attacked me\u2019. Otherwise, his entire clan would mock him.And even if the Runcandels decided to bear the disgrace and publicized the details of this mission\u2014about the horrible experiments being secretly performed in the Zipfel Clan\u2014nothing would change. The Runcandels could demand the Vermont Empire to perform an official investigation of the Zipfels, but the clan of magicians would never admit to having used forbidden magic.Creating living golems was a terrible crime. Simply finding signs of living golems was more than enough to pressure the empire to do a formal investigation. However, the Zipfels could just feign innocence even if conclusive evidence were to be found.In that case, no one would be able to hold them responsible for this crime. That was how much power and authority the Zipfels wielded.\u2018First, I should take some broken shards of the ball of mana and quickly finish my mission.\u2019After a while, Jin regained his composure and picked up a few pieces of the lump of mana. He then walked to the warehouse entrance and checked the situation outside.\u2018\u2026The magicians aren\u2019t making any moves. In other words, most of the magicians here don\u2019t know of these living golems and were just told that the warehouse was just an ordinary one.\u2019If the magicians knew that living golems were placed as guards outside this building, the security here wouldn\u2019t be so lax. There would be at least twenty 7-star magicians constantly keeping an eye on this place.In other words, not every personnel stationed at the Kollon Ruins were involved with the use of forbidden magic in the clan.\u2018I just need to steal the relics and escape as originally planned.\u2019Jin carefully dispelled the Silent Wind spell he had cast and searched around the warehouse.Finding three slabs of stone was a piece of cake.They were all stored away on the first floor of the warehouse. He also found the bronze bowl very quickly.(TL/N: Final reminder to people living in countries where you have a \u2018ground floor\u2019: Korea calls the lowest floor the \u2018first floor\u2019 like the USA. Keep it in mind when you see another \u201cX floor\u201d in the future in this novel.)However, unlike the slabs of stone, the bronze bowl was protected by a complex spell. It was set to activate when the bowl was removed from its display case.This entire protective spell was the reason why the mission\u2019s difficulty was so high.\u2018The standard procedure would be to spend several hours trying to dispel the magic like untying a string knot, but\u2026\u2019Ooooong.Jin sheathed his sword and gathered mana in both his hands.\u2018I\u2019ll steal it using a more extreme method. Since there are already two living golems lying here as corpses, no matter what crazy thing I do in this building today\u2026\u2019Fwoosh!The mana in his hands gained a fire attribute.But Jin then infused the mana with spiritual energy. The flame mixed with darkness projected large shadows in the room.\u2018The Zipfels will have no choice but to sweep it under the rug.\u2019The ancient relics he had to steal were merely stone slabs and one bronze bowl. Even if those were stolen, the Zipfels had nothing to worry about.Nevertheless, the Zipfels would normally do their utmost when trying to find the culprit as the clan\u2019s dignity was on the line.However, the situation was different if you added living golems created with forbidden magic into the equation. They would have to conceal the incident and let no rumours spread at all costs.\u2018Flame Explosion.\u2019Therefore, causing a commotion would actually benefit Jin when escaping. He planned on lighting a fire that engulfed the entire building and escaping while hiding his body inside the flames.Fwooooosh!The burning balls of mana in his hands floated in the air. They glowed bright scarlet as spiritual energy had amplified them.Once the preparations were done, the two balls of mana exploded.Boooooooooom!The inside of the warehouse was engulfed in flames in mere instants, and the ceiling collapsed due to the explosion.Kiiiing! Kiiiing!The protection spells cast on all the items and relics\u2019 display cases activated simultaneously. The shrilling noises resounded everywhere in the warehouse. However, Jin ignored the spells and simply grabbed the bronze bowl and quickly left the front door.The Zipfels were probably going to disguise this incident as an accidental fire outbreak.***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45 \u2013 An Unexpected Incident (3)[Translator \u2013 Koko\u2026 Just Koko\u2026 I\u2019m not feeling anything today][Proofreader \u2013 just yuki giving koko head pats]\u201cJust what on earth do you two think you\u2019re doing?!\u201dTHWACK! THWACK!Luna aggressively slapped two women. The strength of a 9-star knight was nothing to scoff at, even if it were a simple slap. The two victims let out short groans which were barely audible due to the loud smack. In fact, they were sent back flying from the overwhelming force.Boom!The two women slammed into the wall behind them and trembled.They were Myu and Anne. The instant they got slapped, they protected their bodies with aura. However, the shock was so strong that they couldn\u2019t avoid coughing up blood.\u201cYou sent him to Zipfel territory? Myu, he\u2019s ten years younger than you! Have you lost your mind?\u201dLuna had just returned to the Garden of Swords after leaving to deal with some personal issues. As soon as she arrived home, she summoned her two little sisters who had assigned Jin his most recent mission.The girls couldn\u2019t even look their sister in the eyes.Luna wasn\u2019t just their eldest sibling to them. She was an existence they feared more than their father at times.\u201cGet up.\u201dThe sisters stood up with unsteady steps. These two were also Luna\u2019s youngest siblings like Jin. Her own flesh and blood. Seeing their lowered gazes and trembling, Luna pitied them a little, but she had decided to give them a stern warning today no matter what.\u201cWhy did you do it?\u201dMyu and Anne didn\u2019t answer for a while and kept their heads down.It wasn\u2019t because they had nothing to say. They were feeling bitter towards their eldest sister because she already knew the answer to that question. That it was because of the traditional familial conflict\u2014the battle for hegemony\u2014where children fought between each other for a higher standing in the clan.\u201c\u2026Elder Sister Luna, are you seriously asking that question because you don\u2019t know the answer?\u201dMyu spoke up with difficulty to which Luna snickered.\u201cSo what if I really didn\u2019t know the answer? You\u2019re not saying that a flag-bearer of the clan is now waging war against their youngest brother who\u2019s still in the intermediate class, are you?\u201dThe two sisters couldn\u2019t say anything in return and trembled.They felt embarrassed. While the battle for hegemony was a long-lasting tradition in the Runcandel Clan, a flag-bearer confronting a yet-to-be flag-bearer was a complete mismatch.Flag-bearers fighting other flag-bearers, and cadets fighting other cadets.That was the unwritten rule of the battle for hegemony in the Runcandel Clan. While the children didn\u2019t have to follow the rule at all times, Myu and Anne had taken it one step too far with their recent actions.Luna looked down at her siblings for a moment before opening her mouth. Before one could react, her look of disdain had changed into that of murderous intent.\u201cLearn to be ashamed. The fact that you two are flag-bearers of this clan is a disgrace. It\u2019s humiliating for me.\u201d\u201c\u201cElder Sister!\u201d\u201dThe younger sisters raised their voices at the same time. However, Luna paid no heed to that and smirked.\u201cWhat? Do you think I\u2019m exaggerating? Is it unpleasant getting mocked by me? Did I hurt your pride as flag-bearers?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve never gotten involved in the conflicts of the clan, so what right do you have to say all thi\u2014\u201d\u201cHad you confronted the youngest and won, I wouldn\u2019t have gone this far.\u201d\u201c\u2026What do you mean?\u201dMyu and Anne\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cYou\u2019ve already lost against him. The youngest returned from the Kollon Ruins after completing his mission. Jin arrived not long ago and went to report to Mother. I ran into him on my way home and verified his success with my own two eyes.\u201dThe two girls bit down on their lips.\u201cDo you understand why I told you to be ashamed now? You two ended up attaching wings on the youngest\u2019s back while trying to trample on him. I wonder whether there\u2019s ever been any flag-bearer in history who lost this miserably after confronting their youngest sibling\u2026\u201dLuna continued talking sarcastically and her younger sisters\u2019 ears turned bright red. On one hand, they couldn\u2019t handle this humiliation. On the other, they were also terrified.Myu and Anne wouldn\u2019t be able to lay a finger on Jin for a while. Their plan of destroying the youngest before he could fully develop had gone up in flames.The sisters weren\u2019t confident that they\u2019d be able to defeat Jin after he fully matured.In a few years, the youngest would start getting his revenge against them. As they feared the future, a freezing chill ran down their spines.They could only stare into the emptiness in stupefaction as they turned around to exit Luna\u2019s room.Luna spoke up one final time before they could leave.\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve observed so far, the youngest isn\u2019t a merciful child. You two should be careful from here on out.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you still have more mockery left to throw at us, Elder Sister?\u201dLuna wore a bitter smile on her face.\u201cNo, I\u2019m saying this because I\u2019m truly concerned for you. Our relationship may have gone astray sometime in the past, but you two are still my little sisters.\u201dMyu and Anne left without saying anything. Luna stared at the door for a while after their exit and sighed deeply.Clack.As she sat back down at her desk, a teacup was placed in front of her. Taimyun\u2014her nanny who was waiting in the room next door\u2014had returned to Luna\u2019s room.\u201cAh, thanks, Nanny.\u201d\u201cHoho, I thought that you had relapsed into your period of adolescence when you came home and immediately pummelled your siblings, Milady.\u201d\u201cAdolescence? At my age? As if\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because your teenage years were quite memorable.\u00a0Sigh\u2026 Still, I\u2019m worried about Ladies Myu and Anne. Considering the 13th young master\u2019s personality, I\u2019m sure he won\u2019t forget what happened even in the distant future.\u201d\u201cDo you also think that they won\u2019t be able to compete with Jin, Nanny?\u201d\u201cHm, I believe that in another five years, they won\u2019t be able to rival Young Master Jin even in a formal duel. Considering that, Ladies Myu and Anne have less than five years left to live.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk about such gruesome things. They\u2019re still our flesh and blood. If the youngest kills them once he\u2019s older\u2026 It gives me shivers just thinking of it. Speaking of which, have you looked into what we were talking about last time, Nanny?\u201dBy \u2018what we were talking about last time\u2019, Luna meant the incident when someone attempted to assassinate Jin in the Storm Castle. She had asked her nanny to look into their other siblings to find out who was the culprit behind the attempt.Technically speaking, it was a curse instead of an assassination attempt, but Luna didn\u2019t know about that.Moreover, she had misunderstood the situation. When Jin brought it up, she believed that he was around 5 or 6 years old. However, he was actually a 1-year-old baby when someone had attempted to cast the Bladed Illusion curse on him.This was because Jin hadn\u2019t mentioned that he still remembered everything from back when he was an infant.\u201cYes. First of all, the culprits aren\u2019t Ladies Myu and Anne whom you pummelled earlier. Back then, they were still in the intermediate class, so it wasn\u2019t difficult to dig up information about them.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 That makes sense. I\u2019m pretty certain it\u2019s not Mary or Yona either. Same with the Tona twins.\u201d\u201cThen the remaining suspects are Young Masters Joshua, Dipus, Ran, Vigo, and Lady Luntia. Except for Young Masters Ran and Vigo, I cannot carelessly investigate the others.\u201d\u201cRight. Joshua, Dipus, and Luntia\u2019s standings are already established and stable. Things can get troublesome if we investigate them recklessly.\u201d\u201cThen should I begin with Young Masters Ran and Vigo for now?\u201dLuna pondered for a moment and tapped on the table with her finger.\u201cNo. Let\u2019s just keep an eye on everyone for now. If we keep poking our heads in everyone\u2019s affairs, you might get in danger, Nanny.\u201d\u201cA wise decision. Although there was an assassination attempt back in the Storm Castle, Young Master Jin is growing properly, so I believe there is no need to worry too much now.\u201d\u201cNo matter who the culprit is, they must know that I\u2019m looking after Jin now. They won\u2019t make a move carelessly anymore. Anyways, thank you for your help so far, Nanny.\u201d\u201cIt was my pleasure. Should I prepare your meal now?\u201d\u201cYeah. Some alcohol as well. The usual.\u201d***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Koko\u2026 Just Koko\u2026 I\u2019m not feeling anything today][Proofreader \u2013 just yuki giving koko head pats]Join our discord to get the latest news and updates about the translations!https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv***Rosa had myriads of questions she wanted to ask her youngest son when he returned after accomplishing his mission. However, she didn\u2019t express them out loud.Mamit and the Kollon Ruins. Everyone had expected him to fail, but each time, he returned triumphant and proud.Was he blessed by the heavens? Or did he receive the help of a third party each time? Nobody knew the answer.But with this mission, Rosa was certain that it was the latter.\u2018There\u2019s an exceptional expert supporting the youngest from the shadows. And the youngest is using that to his advantage to complete his missions.\u2019Accomplishing one\u2019s missions with the help of another went against the unwritten rule of the clan. The only help one could ask for during a difficult mission was reinforcements from the clan.However, Rosa decided not to question her son nor to blame him.Soon, countless influential envoys from all around the world would come visit the Garden of Swords just to have a look at the youngest. Cyron would host a banquet, and the star of the show would be Jin.Even if he had gotten the help of a third party from outside the clan without informing them, the most important fact was that he had returned alive from the mission.Rosa could always reprimand her son on a later date at an appropriate moment after having gathered enough evidence.\u201cGood work. No need to go report to the flag-bearers. Go take a good rest for today. I\u2019ll inform them about your return.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Mother.\u201dAs soon as he exited the main building where Rosa\u2019s office was located, Jin sensed gazes on him. Cadets showed admiration in their eyes, guardian knights wore looks of astonishment, whereas flag-bearers had looks of contempt and disgust.\u2018Mother and my siblings must think I received the help of someone else to complete my missions.\u2019Well, that wasn\u2019t his problem.Jin didn\u2019t plan on resolving this misunderstanding for now. Everything would be uncovered in the future when he reveals his true powers and declares himself a magic swordsman who had contracted with Solderet.As soon as Jin entered his room, Gilly ran up to him and hugged him tightly. When he felt her tears on his cheek, Jin realized how worried Gilly had been for him.\u201cI\u2019m alright, Gilly. I\u2019m strong now. I might even win against you in a duel in the near future if I went all out.\u201d\u201cIf something terrible had happened to you, I would\u2019ve done everything to get revenge on the ladies at the expense of my own life, Young Master.\u201d\u201cGeez, don\u2019t talk about such scary things, Strawberry Pie. You\u2019re too hot-blooded. Isn\u2019t it good now that he\u2019s back with us safe and sound?\u201d\u201cGive me a minute, Gilly. Murakan, take a look at this.\u201dJin took out the glass bottle in which he had put the shards of the living golem\u2019s core.\u201cIt\u2019s the heart of a living golem. You were lucky, kid. Seeing how you\u2019re unscathed, this one must\u2019ve been a failure. Did you find it at the Kollon Ruins?\u201d\u201cThe two guards positioned outside the warehouse suddenly transformed into monsters and attacked me. They regenerated no matter where I cut them. But I managed to kill them by destroying the cores in their chests.\u201dAs Jin explained the situation, Gilly\u2019s face turned pale. Murakan calmly explained what forbidden magic and living golems were to her.\u2018Last time, it was a cemetary giant, and now it\u2019s a living golem? Those Zipfel bastards are getting on my nerves\u2026\u2019What on earth were they scheming?Murakan shook his head and spoke to the other two.\u201cIn any case, this must be the Zipfels\u2019 handiwork as you said, since the Kollon Ruins are in Zipfel territory.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cYou and I need to make some time and visit that area again in the future. I need to go take a look and ask them what they\u2019re scheming personally.\u201dJin was somewhat nervous about having to return to the ruins due to the living golems, but since Murakan was going with him, it would be a much safer trip than his recent mission.\u2018And if we\u2019re lucky enough, we could even try searching for the mirror, the Fountain of Mana. Even if we wreak havoc, the Zipfels will have no choice but to sweep it under the rug due to their usage of forbidden magic.\u2019Jin nodded to the dragon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46 \u2013 Banquet (1)[Translakoko \u2013 Tor][yukireader \u2013 Proof]Translator\u2019s Corner:Sorry for the late release! I was busy due to real life matters, and had no time to translate the past 10 days. We\u2019re back to a 5 chap/week rate (with the 5th\u00a0chapter releasing on Monday this time). Hope you enjoy!_________________________________Three weeks have passed since Jin returned to the clan.He had left Kajin and the Hass brothers down in the hole on the mountainous road on his way back. Fortunately, the three of them woke up the next day and returned safely to the Garden of Swords afterwards.However, this time around, Myu and Anne abandoned them for good and cast them aside. In fact, it wasn\u2019t just those three, but all the members of their faction within the intermediate class.Additionally, Kajin and the Hass brothers were stripped of their titles and qualifications as Runcandel cadets.These appeared to be extreme punishments to others, especially considering those three had, officially speaking, accomplished the mission at the Kollon Ruins with Jin.However, all the other cadets knew of the truth. Kajin and the Hass brothers were being banished from the Runcandel Clan due to their mistake; the mistake of joining the wrong faction.\u201cYou must find me foolish and laughable.\u201dBefore leaving the Garden of Swords, Kajin shouted to the intermediate cadets. He looked around the crowd, but then stopped his gaze on the leader of the Youngest Division, Mesa Milkano.\u201cBut soon enough, you all will be in the same situation as me. We\u2019re different from purebloods. No matter how much effort we put into the clan, we\u2019re mere mutts being bred by the Runcandels\u2026 And in the end, you get cast aside like trash\u2026 Kekeke, I wish you all the best.\u201dNevertheless, not a single cadet shared sympathy towards Kajin Romello.No one had forgotten his tyrannical rule and terrible deeds from back when he was the intermediate class\u2019s dictator.\u201cWhatever, you retarded dog.\u201dMesa snorted and waved her hand towards Kajin, shooing him away as if he were a street dog.***Claaang!Clang!Every time Jin swung down on the Clear Stone, a beautiful sound resonated inside the hidden training area.\u201cThat\u2019s enough. Your training with the Clear Stones ends today. Tomorrow onwards, the Tona twins will be the only ones who have to attend.\u201dAlthough he spoke with a composed tone, Zed was actually having a difficult time hiding his shock. Jin was the first Runcandel child he had trained to complete the Clear Stone training within half a year.\u2018Moreover, he perfectly completed the mission at the Kollon Ruins. Whether he\u2019s been blessed with great fortune since his mission at Mamit, or whether he\u2019s accomplished his tasks with his own capabilities, I guess we\u2019ll never know\u2026 But whatever the answer is, my elder brother won\u2019t leave him to stagnate amongst the cadets here on out.\u2019Zed was somewhat suspicious of the incidents that had occurred every time Jin was dispatched on a mission. There was the magician\u2019s terror attack at Mamit, and now there was a fire at the Kollon Ruins.However, he didn\u2019t find it to be particularly problematic. He didn\u2019t care how Jin had accomplished the missions. What mattered most was that he had skillfully and neatly completed all his tasks using whatever method he had planned in advance.After Jin escaped from the Kollon Ruins, the Zipfels reported the incident as an accidental fire at the warehouse, just as he had predicted.There was neither a single bit of information about the robbery of ancient relics nor about the living golems and usage of forbidden magic.Jin didn\u2019t inform the clan about the Zipfels\u2019 illegal experiments, though.\u201cJin.\u201d\u201cYes, Uncle.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t need to attend the morning classes with the cadets anymore either. Next week, the patriarch will make you take an oath.\u201dThe Tona twins\u2019 ears perked up.Although they were usually dense and dull-witted, they could still understand what Zed was implying with his words.\u2018Will Father grant the position of provisional flag-bearer to Jin\u2026?\u2019\u2018Already?\u2019The minimum qualification necessary to become a Runcandel flag-bearer was being a 6-star knight. Jin was still at 5-star, so he didn\u2019t meet the requirements. However, his age was a game changer. He was a 5-star knight at such a young age that he had caught Cyron\u2019s attention.But that young age was the entire reason why he was at the bottom of the hierarchy in the family, so his youth had its merits and demerits.\u201cDo you understand what I mean? No matter what the patriarch demands of you, I believe that you will be successful henceforth.\u201dSince Zed was going as far as saying so, it was almost certain that Jin would become a provisional flag-bearer.The Runcandels\u2019 provisional flag-bearers were given one command: to accumulate achievements and gain honour. It was a trial.Honour wasn\u2019t something one could suddenly obtain one day. Therefore, provisional flag-bearers often left the clan for a long period of time and ventured out into the world on their own.Jin was a super rookie amongst the cadets, but no one outside the clan would recognize him. Someone like Mary Runcandel\u2014Jin\u2019s third sister\u2014had to leave to the south and earn the nicknames \u2018The Southern Region\u2019s Madwoman\u2019 and \u2018Stormwind Mary\u2019 in order to become a fully-fledged flag-bearer.Thus, one had to gain reputation about their battle prowess and have everyone recognize their glory to become a true flag-bearer. Needless to say, the provisional flag-bearers weren\u2019t allowed to get any help or support from the clan during this entire trial.\u201cYes, Uncle! Thank you very much!\u201dFor once, Jin didn\u2019t hide his emotions and expressed his joy.So far, his life at the Storm Castle and the Garden of Swords was filled with restrictions. He could only train his swordsmanship openly and not his magic or spiritual power.The other two had to be practiced in secret, away from the public\u2019s eyes as if he were a criminal. However, if he gained the opportunity to spend a long period of time outside the Runcandel Clan\u2026\u2018I can train my powers as much as I want, without having to be wary of others!\u2019Obviously speaking, he would have to return to the Garden of Swords after having gained great fame and hide his abilities again. But there was no need to complain as he would finally gain the proper authority and power of a true flag-bearer.Because when that day arrives, he would create an enormous fissure in the succession, where the positions and standings of the candidates for the throne would be flipped around.***Reaper Scans[Translakoko \u2013 Tor][yukireader \u2013 Proof]Join our discord to get the latest news and updates about the translations!https://discord.gg/sb2jqkv***June 1795.The atmosphere at the Garden of Swords was greatly tense and agitated. All kinds of renowned celebrities and envoys were about to visit the Runcandel Clan to see the youngest child, so everything had to be prepared carefully and be absolutely perfect.Moreover, the world\u2019s one-and-only Genesis Knight\u2014their patriarch\u2014was returning to the main house.Cyron was on his way to the Garden of Swords. Not only was it an official visit, he was organizing a large banquet with all the guests.Currently, there were over five hundred guardian knights escorting Cyron from the Black Sea as a formality. Cyron had departed the Black Sea two weeks ago. While he could\u2019ve used transfer gates to arrive faster, he insisted on walking his way back home.Travelling from the Black Sea to the main house on foot and by sea would take them at least two weeks to arrive.During the entire two weeks, the five-hundred-plus guardian knights would be travelling alongside the patriarch, so the necessary expenses were astronomical. Moreover, since over five hundred guardian knights had emptied their positions at the main house, the others had to fill in the empty spots and work a lot harder than usual.Nevertheless, Cyron insisted on travelling by foot in order to show the entire world the Runcandels\u2019 dignity.During the past two weeks, the outside world was constantly talking about how Cyron was doing a magnificent parade across the continent to return home.Whenever Cyron and the guardian knights marched through cities and towns, the inhabitants stood on the side to watch the incredible spectacle and bowed when the Genesis Knight passed in front of them.\u201cLord Patriarch, we will be arriving at the Garden of Swords in two hours.\u201d\u201cMy youngest child seems to enjoy constantly disturbing my training. I was planning on staying at the Black Sea for at least ten years. How many times have I left the Black Sea to return to the clan just because of him?\u201dAlthough he appeared to be irritated, Cyron had a soft grin on his face.\u201cI noticed that Young Master Jin was out of the ordinary since his days at the Storm Castle, but\u2026 to be honest, I never thought he\u2019d be this outstanding. His behaviour and achievements at the Garden of Swords are really astonishing.\u201d\u201cHis fighting spirit and audacity are quite exceptional. That little kid\u2019s gaze has always shown great ambition and drive ever since I went to visit the Storm Castle. He thinks he kept it properly hidden and that I hadn\u2019t noticed it though\u2026 Haha.\u201dJin Runcandel. His 13th child. Even Cyron could see that his youngest son was greatly different compared to his other children.It wasn\u2019t just a question of being able to use a bit of spiritual power due to having gained Solderet\u2019s interest. Cyron had been keeping an eye on Jin because of the fighting spirit and resolve he had seen in the boy\u2019s eyes many years ago.Although no one had specifically taught him, the youngest already knew how to properly destroy and tear someone down back then.Even if one assumed that he was able to defeat and oppress the Tona twins back at the Storm Castle thanks to his spiritual power, Cyron was still unable to forget Jin\u2019s silhouette as he provoked his other siblings as soon as he had arrived at the Garden of Swords.\u201cI already have plenty of children who are eloquent and have a way with words. I wasn\u2019t very surprised when the youngest came to the Garden and immediately provoked the others, but I still had some interest in him. And look at how far he\u2019s come now. He\u2019s returned alive every time his siblings sent him out to die and even became a 5-star knight.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still more amazed by the results of his very first mission\u2014the one you assigned to him, Lord Patriarch\u2014rather than his achievements at Mamit and the Kollon Ruins. While Mesa Milkano getting kidnapped was outside our expectations, we could never have imagined the young master would fight and kill the white wolf warrior.\u201d\u201cIt was quite an odd incident. I was hoping the youngest would use his companions as meat shields in order to kill the white wolf warrior; never in my wildest dreams did I think he\u2019d defeat the warrior on his own. He even rescued the kidnapped cadet. It seems he proved to us the weight of his principles and beliefs.\u201dAs he reminisced about the past, Cyron nodded to himself in satisfaction.\u201cDo you truly believe that the young master defeated the white wolf warrior on his own?\u201d\u201cI do. Oh, technically speaking, I guess it\u2019s not quite \u2018on his own\u2019. In any case, he\u2019s quite the interesting brat. I\u2019ll ask him some questions about that incident when I see him this time.\u201dCyron was thinking that Jin had used spiritual power to kill the white wolf warrior.***The parade reached the Garden of Swords at noon.The guardian knights who were at the Garden of Swords had already finished lining up at the gate three hours before Cyron\u2019s arrival.The knights wearing shining armours all raised their swords in synchronization.\u201c\u201c\u201cAll hail!\u201d\u201d\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cAll hail!\u201d\u201d\u201dCyron stood silently and stared at everyone, and nodded in satisfaction after a while. Immediately, all the swords returned to their original positions, by the knights\u2019 sides.Soon enough, Rosa and the clan\u2019s flag-bearers appeared from behind the guardian knights. The pure-blooded Runcandels who had yet to become flag-bearers were standing behind them.Jin was the youngest Runcandel pureblood\u2014even when including all his cousins\u2014thus, he was standing at the very back.\u201cWe\u2019ve been expecting you, Lord Patriarch.\u201d\u201cRosa. It must\u2019ve been quite exhausting preparing all this.\u201d\u201cNot at all. Our reliable children were the ones who arranged this, so I had nothing to do with it.\u201dAs she replied, Rosa\u2019s gaze discreetly moved towards Joshua.She truly believed that the infighting and competition amongst the Runcandels was the virtue of the clan. Moreover, she had recently started to hold great expectations towards her youngest child\u2014who had started showing his prominence and potential.Nevertheless, she still hoped for Joshua to become the next patriarch. The expectations she had towards her second daughter Luntia, second son Dipus, third daughter Mary, and youngest son Jin were all as candidates for the throne after Joshua.Cyron could clearly read Rosa\u2019s intentions, but didn\u2019t react to them.However, there was one thing he found unpleasant: the imposing and confident expression on his eldest son\u2019s face.Ever since Luna renounced her right for the throne, Joshua was convinced he\u2019d become the next patriarch. He considered this \u2018battle for hegemony\u2019 a walk in the park and believed the throne was guaranteed to be his.Cyron actually thought that his second son Dipus or third daughter Mary were more suited for the throne, despite the fact that they weren\u2019t perfectly satisfactory either.\u201cIf our children were truly so reliable, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to leave the Black Sea. The guests visiting today are only coming here to stay on my good side, not out of fear of our\u00a0children.\u201dCyron put emphasis on the word \u2018children\u2019.\u201cYou are indeed correct. Let us head inside. I\u2019ve personally prepared your favourite dishes for the first time in a while.\u201d\u201cNow that must\u2019ve been quite strenuous. I have great expectations for today\u2019s lunch.\u201dCyron walked past Joshua and didn\u2019t even glance at his eldest son. Strictly speaking, he didn\u2019t glance at his other children either as he continued walking. However, it must\u2019ve felt like a humiliation to Joshua as they were standing before the entire clan.Cyron continued making his way but came to a halt just a single time and spoke out loud.\u201cRan, Vigo.\u201d\u201cYes, Father.\u201d\u201cDid you gift your swords to the youngest? The swords I gave you special permission to take from the clan\u2019s armory?\u201dCyron finally turned his gaze and stared at the two swords hanging by Jin\u2019s waist.It was a somewhat reprimanding tone. Cyron was implying his dissatisfaction at his sons for giving away the precious swords he had lent them without his permission, and that they shouldn\u2019t expect to be allowed to borrow any other item from the clan in the future.Ran and Vigo were about to lose their minds.If they had indeed gifted those swords, they could somehow appease their father\u2019s anger in the future. But if they told him they had lost the weapons to the youngest, they were doomed.Yet, that was their only choice. They could only answer honestly.\u201c\u2026The youngest took them away from us.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you telling me you two lost against the youngest?\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2019s not the case. We promised to give them to the youngest if he accomplished his mission at the Kollon Ruins, so\u2026\u201dRan and Vigo wanted to dig a hole on the spot and hide. The humiliation was horrible, and they couldn\u2019t bear the thought of their father being disappointed and losing all interest in them.\u201cBwahahaha!\u201dHowever, Cyron simply laughed out loud and patted his sons on the shoulder.\u201cI see, I see. Then next time, make sure you get the swords back from him. The youngest is always so shrewd. I sometimes wonder whether it really comes from my blood. Haha!\u201dRan and Vigo sighed in relief. Not only had they avoided their father\u2019s fury, he had also cracked a joke, which washed away all their worries.However, they didn\u2019t know one important fact.When Cyron said \u2018I sometimes wonder whether it really comes from my blood\u2019, he wasn\u2019t talking about Jin\u2019s shrewdness.He was talking about Ran and Vigo\u2019s uselessness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47 \u2013 Banquet (2)[Translator \u2013 Chapter 46 was a fucking nightmare. Longest chap so far\u2026 Koko wakes up in drenched clothes, breathing heavily, terrified of the number 46 now\u2026][Proofreader \u2013 yuki\u2026 wants to feel sorry for koko but is staring in amazement instead; that chapter was gold]Since the master of the clan had arrived, the guests began entering the Garden of Swords.There were delegates from every nation, including the Vermont Empire; The Imperial Guards, Special Forces, Dragon King Knights, the Yvliano Clan, the Tuko Clan, the Ken Clan, the Black King Mercenaries, the Ghost Mercenaries, etc.Each and every one of them were people with great power from highly influential clans or organizations. As they entered the Garden one after another, it appeared as if the Garden\u2019s mansion stood with pride, looming over them like a monarch on the throne.It was like the building was commanding the guests to show the minimum courtesy and manners when in its presence.Additionally, there were the several thousands of swords planted in the ground around the Garden of Swords, and the myriads of highly important visitors walked through this metal forest.It was a majestic sight. In fact, the Vermont Emperor\u2019s coronation ceremony wasn\u2019t as luxurious or radiant as this spectacle. The thousand guests who had come to the clan today represented the Runcandels\u2019 prestige, authority, and power.The guardian knights and servants of the clan were intoxicated with this feeling of importance as they all stood with imposing expressions. They had to show that the Runcandel Clan\u2019s guardian knights and servants weren\u2019t ordinary people either, that they shared the glory of the clan as well.Except the Zipfels, there wasn\u2019t a single other clan that could rival the Runcandels. And since the Zipfels hadn\u2019t sent an official request to visit the clan today, the Runcandel clansmen could stand straight with their chests puffed out without fearing anything.Meanwhile, Jin was witnessing this incredible sight alongside Cyron. They stood on the balcony looking down at the courtyard. Cyron waved his hand towards the guests from time to time, while Jin lowered his head in courtesy.\u201cThis must be your first banquet.\u201d\u201cYes, Father.\u201dJin had actually attended a few banquets in his past life thanks to his magic teacher, but this was his first time taking part in a banquet hosted by the Runcandels, even if he took his past life into account.Back then, whenever the clan organized a banquet, he wasn\u2019t allowed to attend and had to keep himself out of sight like a criminal. A pure-blooded Runcandel becoming a 1-star knight at the age of 25 was an embodiment of the clan\u2019s disgrace.\u2018But now, I\u2019m standing next to Father during the banquet as one of the main stars of the night\u2026 To think I\u2019d finally reach this place after dying once.\u2019Jin felt proud yet bitter at the same time. In fact, if you took a deeper look into his emotions, the bitterness overwhelmed the feeling of pride and joy.However, Jin didn\u2019t express his feelings and simply waited for his father\u2019s next words.\u201cAs you may know, our clan seldom hosts banquets.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWe only organize one when there\u2019s something truly worth celebrating. In other words, the feats you\u2019ve achieved so far are that impressive.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Father.\u201dCyron softly stroked Jin on the head. Jin was initially scared out of his wits, but managed to keep his shock hidden.\u201cHow many guests do you think there are today?\u201d\u201cMy rough estimate would be a thousand, Father.\u201d\u201cRight, I received a report that it was about a thousand. There are around two hundred more guests today compared to the banquet we organized seven years ago. Do you understand what that signifies?\u201dJin didn\u2019t need to think about the answer.\u201cIt means that during the past seven years, our clan\u2019s authority and power has increased.\u201dCyron had a satisfied smile.\u201cExactly. Other clans could easily have a thousand guests come to their banquet as well\u2026 But all the visitors today are prominent and distinguished figures. We don\u2019t let small fry or worthless people attend our banquets.\u201dJin nodded to his father\u2019s words.Just as Cyron had said, the thousand guests today were all stars and celebrities. They were the leaders standing at the steering wheel of the world, ruling over the billions of people inhabiting this continent.But even amongst all these rulers, the one standing at the summit was Cyron Runcandel.\u201cAll I\u2019ve done during the past seven years was killing monsters in the Black Sea and training in seclusion. Yet, our clan\u2019s prestige has increased over the years, and the only reason behind it is that I\u2019m the only Genesis Knight of this era.\u201dJin politely waited for Cyron to continue his speech.\u201cIn other words\u2026 Once I disappear, most of the people gathered here today may turn their backs on the Runcandel Clan.\u201dJin was aware of this truth better than anyone else.Without his father, Cyron Runcandel, the clan would never have been able to amass so much power and influence. The Runcandels were one of the two major clans on this continent alongside the Zipfels. But if Cyron were to be taken out of the equation, the gap in power and military strength between the Zipfels and the Runcandels would only grow larger and larger.Thus, the world would head towards a system where the Zipfels held total power over the continent. The Vermont Empire\u2014which was currently acting as the mediator between the two clans\u2014would most definitely side with the clan of magicians if things took such a drastic turn.\u2018I wonder what the youngest has to say about this.\u2019Cyron has had this conversation with all his children so far.He had asked them similar questions along the lines of \u2018If I disappear, people will turn their backs on the Runcandels. What do you think of this?\u2019Most of the time, his children gave similar answers, such as \u2018That won\u2019t happen, Father!\u2019 or \u2018Why would you ever disappear, Father!\u2019 Some of them would even foolishly declare that they\u2019d become the next Genesis Knight.\u201cFather.\u201dAfter a long silence, Jin called out to his father.\u201cSpeak freely, Son.\u201d\u201cIf you were to disappear one day, and all these guests truly turned their backs on the Runcandels\u2026 And in consequence, the Zipfels mobilized all their forces to suppress us, and the clan were to be at the point of no return\u2026\u201dJin paused for a moment and made eye contact with Cyron.\u201cI would leave the clan.\u201dHaving heard the answer, Cyron glared at Jin with bloodshot eyes.\u201cWhat? Did you say you\u2019d leave the clan?\u201d\u201cYes. If the Runcandel Clan were to collapse just because you aren\u2019t present, Father, then it would be due to the succeeding clan leader\u2019s incompetence. I do not plan on dying a dog\u2019s death under an incompetent patriarch or matriarch.\u201dIt was a shocking and absurd answer. Cyron was angered by the youngest\u2019s insolent attitude for a short while, but it was soon replaced with great curiosity.\u201cKeep talking.\u201dJin let out a deep breath before continuing his words.\u201cHow many of those guests\u2019 weaknesses do we, as a clan, have in our grasp?\u201d\u201cWeaknesses?\u201d\u201cYes. Allow me to take Duke Bern over there as an example. The Bern Clan\u2019s head tricked the Emperor and embezzled some of the empire\u2019s treasures. Nevertheless, he\u2019s confidently attending our banquet, all thanks to our help and the debt he owes us.\u201cThere is also the man smoking towards the left of the courtyard. He is Lance Cleaver, am I correct? It\u2019s a bit difficult to recognize people just from the portraits I\u2019ve seen before. In any case, Lance\u2014the Cleaver Clan\u2019s greatest warrior\u2014once requested us to kill three Zipfel magicians for him.\u201cOver there is Miss Charlotte Herald, who once sold her family\u2019s heirloom due to her terrible gambling addiction. She then requested us to recover it for her, and the Herald Clan has yet to repay us that debt in full to this day.\u201cAnd the woman behind Miss Charlotte is Lord Bellard\u2019s mistress. She was originally an illegitimate daughter of the Vermont Imperial Family. But due to her talent as a genius magician, she was oppressed by the legitimate children and was later banished. Lord Bellard has been commissioning us to protect her for several years already.\u201cAnd the person over at the\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough.\u201dCyron lightly shook his hand.\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve read through the clan\u2019s commission contracts. But that\u2019s normally only allowed to flag-bearers. Did Luna show them to you? I won\u2019t punish you, so speak truthfully.\u201d\u201cNo. I asked Elder Brother Vigo to show them to me in exchange for returning his sword, since I had no use for that weapon.\u201d\u201cKuhaha, you really are remarkable.\u201d\u201cJust by skimming through those documents, one can find all these weapons that aren\u2019t swords the clan could make use of. I imagine that the classified documents that only Father and Mother are allowed to read must hold even greater and numerous weapons.\u201d\u201cSo, are you saying that one could use those to protect the clan even when I\u2019m not here?\u201d\u201cIt all depends on the next clan leader\u2019s negotiation skills. In your case, Father, you have no use of negotiation skills as you are the strongest knight in existence. However, the circumstances are different for future patriarchs and matriarchs who aren\u2019t Genesis Knights.\u201dCyron slowly and calmly nodded and smiled.\u201cYou are correct. But we aren\u2019t the only ones who have a grasp on others\u2019 weaknesses, Son. The Zipfels also have a hold on their weaknesses as much as we do.\u201d\u201cI assume so. However, the Zipfels don\u2019t have an adequate justification to thoughtlessly take advantage of those weaknesses.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t have a justification? Why so?\u201d\u201cBecause the role of the villain belongs to us Runcandels. In any case, if the next patriarch is unable to protect the clan even with all these weapons at his disposal, I will leave the clan without a speck of hesitation. I will depart and prepare my revenge against those who brought us to ruin.\u201dWhether they secretly performed experiments with forbidden magic at the Kollon Ruins, whether they found the Fountain of Mana and used it to print out 7-star magicians like a factory, the Zipfels were still the clan that symbolized good and justice to the public.They couldn\u2019t openly commit evil deeds like the Runcandels.\u201cHaha, revenge you say\u2026 I see, one can only get revenge if they\u2019re still alive. I see your point. It\u2019s not bad.\u201dJin silently lowered his head in response to his father\u2019s approval. He was still somewhat disappointed by Cyron\u2019s strict assessment.\u2018Well, I guess I\u2019ve put up a good defense nonetheless. Father is usually far more stern and uncompromising.\u2019\u2014It\u2019s not bad.Although he had said so, Cyron was actually quite content with Jin\u2019s answer. Cyron believed that the youngest was pragmatic enough and had come up with an effective plan.It wasn\u2019t as if his other children hadn\u2019t come up with similar ideas in their heads.But their problem was that they didn\u2019t dare to assume the \u2018Runcandel Clan would be destroyed\u2019 and say it out loud to their father. Meanwhile, Jin\u2019s honest and confident beliefs were quite a breath of fresh air to Cyron.The boy wasn\u2019t being conceited and getting ahead of himself. Calculating wasn\u2019t quite the right word to describe him right now; cool-headed was a better choice. And that collected attitude of his was what Cyron was highly satisfied with in Jin.\u2018It\u2019s such a pity this child was born so late. It\u2019s as if Luna\u2019s talent, Mary\u2019s wild nature, and Dipus\u2019s competitive spirit were collected into one single body.\u2019Ten years at the shortest, and fifteen at the longest. That was Cyron\u2019s prediction on how long he could protect his position as patriarch.He was now curious to know whether the youngest would be able to turn around the current successor candidate hierarchy in that period of time. Watching over Jin would be his new entertainment and hobby now.\u201cThe guests have almost reached the mansion. Let\u2019s head back inside.\u201dUnder the dark evening sky, countless lights illuminated the plains beyond the Garden of Swords\u2019s front gate. Those lights belonged to the campsites that were created outside the Runcandel main house, where the attendants of today\u2019s visitors remained at.These people would have to wait under the tents for three days until the banquet ended.\u201cYes, Father.\u201d\u201cOh, and after the banquet ends, I need to have a word with you. Stay on standby in the house until I summon you.\u201dJin\u2019s promotion to a provisional flag-bearer!That was what this was about. As he had already heard about it from his uncle, Jin wasn\u2019t quite surprised. However, hearing about it from his father\u2019s mouth directly was a completely different feeling.\u2018So once the banquet ends, I\u2019ll have to set out and travel for a long time.\u2019One thing that was necessary to become a true flag-bearer was honour and reputation.Jin would have to wander around the world after the banquet in order to build up his honour.During that time, he would not be restricted by the clan in any way, so he could use his magic and spiritual power alongside his swordsmanship as much as he wanted.Using his past life\u2019s knowledge, he could even find great opportunities for himself and search for artifacts or divine objects. His memories would be a great advantage for him.\u2018The next three days will feel like an eternity. I can\u2019t wait to depart already.\u2019Cyron and Jin left the balcony and entered the central hall. The gigantic chandelier hanging on the ceiling illuminated their faces as they took a step inside.The two headed up the second floor and waited for the guests to arrive and greet them, when suddenly, three butlers came rushing towards Cyron.\u201cLord Patriarch, guests who hadn\u2019t sent a formal request to visit have arrived. What should we do?\u201dGuests who hadn\u2019t sent a formal request.The Zipfels had come.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48 \u2013 Banquet (3)[Translator \u2013 okoK][Proofreader \u2013 iyuk]The butlers continued reporting to the patriarch with concerned looks.\u201cThere are five of them. Andrei Zipfel came personally with other family members.\u201dAndrei Zipfel, the Zipfel Clan\u2019s second-in-command.He was given the title of \u2018Wind King\u2019 due to his contract with the God of Wind Melzeyer and the blessing he received from the Wind Dragon Vyuretta.He was the man with the highest authority in the clan after Kelliark Zipfel, the patriarch. He was a 9-star magician who could annihilate a couple of small nations within a morning if he felt like it.Such a powerful man had suddenly come to the Runcandel Clan without any forewarning.\u2018Andrei Zipfel\u2026?\u2019Just like Beradin Zipfel, he was someone Jin envied and idolized in his past life as a rookie magician.If it were the Jin from before his death, his heart would be racing like crazy right now from the excitement of meeting his idol, a grand magician even his master had acknowledged.\u2018But it seems like he\u2019s someone without any manners.\u2019Right now, he was merely an impudent and rude guest who had come uninvited.Whether he was a grand magician or a grand magician\u2019s grandfather, one had to show the proper courtesy and manners when visiting the Runcandels\u2019 venerated Garden.Even Kelliark Zipfel\u2014the patriarch\u2014had shown the proper respect when visiting the clan twenty years ago, and the Vermont Emperor had done the same twelve years ago.Jin discreetly turned his head to check his father, and Cyron appeared to be of the same opinion as his son.\u201cWhat an impertinent prick.\u201dThe visitors who were looking up at Cyron from the first floor didn\u2019t know what was going on, but the sharp ones amongst them noticed the change of expression on Cyron\u2019s face. Soon enough, a tense atmosphere took over the hall.The butlers kept their heads lowered and waited for Cyron to respond.\u201cHeinz.\u201dThe first-class butler in the middle with clean, white hair approached Cyron.\u201cYes, Lord Patriarch.\u201d\u201cInform Andrei Zipfel to get lost, but let the other Zipfel clansmen with him inside. And don\u2019t do it yourself. Tell the servants to do it.\u201dJin almost choked on his saliva as he listened from the side.Although Andrei had been rude to come uninvited, to send him away at the gate like this would be a terrible insult\u2026 Only a true monarch would be allowed to refuse and humiliate Andrei like this.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dHeinz replied with a composed tone.Once the butlers took their leave, Cyron turned to Jin with a softened look.\u201cDo you think that my decision was a bit extreme?\u201d\u201cI found it quite gratifying. This should embarrass Andrei Zipfel quite a bit and put him in a tough spot.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think it\u2019ll put him in a tough spot?\u201d\u201cFather ordered to \u2018let the other Zipfel clansmen inside\u2019. In other words, if Andrei Zipfel takes his leave with the other clansmen out of embarrassment, he\u2019ll have ignored the Runcandel patriarch\u2019s permission. But such a thing is not permitted in the Garden of Swords.\u201d\u201cHaha, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d have deduced it that far. Indeed, Andrei will follow my orders. If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll have to crawl his way back to the Zipfels without his two legs.\u201dHad Andrei arrived uninvited at a banquet hosted by another clan, the head would\u2019ve had to allow him inside despite the discomfort.However, no matter how influential and powerful he was as a grand magician, he was merely a human compared to Cyron, who had entered the realm of demigods. A slightly powerful human, but a human nonetheless.And even if Cyron turned Andrei into a cripple, the Zipfels wouldn\u2019t begin an all-out war against the Runcandels. However, they would retaliate once Cyron passed away.Around twenty minutes later, four people entered the banquet hall. They were the Zipfel purebloods who had come with Andrei. The grand magician himself didn\u2019t join the venue though, just as the father and son had predicted.Three of the four Zipfels were anxiously looking around the hall, carefully keeping an eye on their surroundings. They appeared to be between 15 and 20 years of age.Cyron smiled in satisfaction at the sight, stood up, and clapped a single time.Thump\u2026!It sounded more like a deep and powerful drum than that of a clap. As the echo resonated in the hall, the guests chatting on the first floor stopped talking and raised their heads to the second floor where Cyron was waiting.The boys and girls from the Zipfel Clan were concerned that Cyron would rebuke them in public. Needless to say, the Genesis Knight had already turned the page and held no more interest in them.Amidst the silence, Cyron looked down at the guests and spoke out loud.\u201cLadies and gentlemen, thank you for coming all this way to the Garden of Swords. I am Cyron, patriarch of the Runcandel Clan. It seems I\u2019ve gotten myself quite a decent son in my latter years. Thanks to him, I have another opportunity to reunite with all these familiar faces and spend a good time. So, a round of applause to Jin Runcandel.\u201dClap-clap-clap-clap!Cheers and applause ensued like every formal banquet.However, the banquets hosted by the Runcandels were known for being quite peculiar\u2014where the greetings were short, and the hosts didn\u2019t accept gifts.\u201cAs you all may know, there are just two simple rules you need to follow at Runcandel banquets. First, if a fight breaks out during the merrymaking, the people involved will be escorted to the duelling arena by the guardian knights. Second, the loser must accept their defeat, and the winner must show mercy. Don\u2019t forget that this is a celebration.\u201dThe public called the Runcandel banquets a \u2018single-log bridge party\u2019.The principle behind a single-log bridge is that if two people come face to face on the bridge, it will be followed by confrontation and dispute until one person admits defeat and goes back the way they came.And that was exactly the case at Runcandel banquets.A thousand influential and powerful figures from around the world had gathered in one place. Many of them held grudges against other guests, so confrontation and disputes were inevitable since the guests would\u2019ve gotten drunk from the available alcohol.In normal banquets, the two parties with animosity would just stare at each other from afar or would simply have light verbal disputes. But the banquets hosted by the Runcandels were different.If two drunk archenemies made eye contact, they just had to head to the arena without making a fuss.The only rules were no killing, and accepting the results of the duels.Some would find it a shame, not being able to kill their nemesis, but it was still quite enjoyable for the winner to pummel and clobber their opponent to the ground. The loser would even have to admit being weaker and inferior to them, which was very satisfying.\u201cWell then, I hope you all have a great time before you return.\u201dWoohoooooo!More cheers followed, and Jin trembled as he watched the flushed and joyful faces downstairs. A refreshing and thrilling chill ran down his spine and spread around his body.\u2018Seriously\u2026 this is one hell of a crazy clan.\u2019And unfortunately, he was a part of this crazy clan.\u201cYou can also head downstairs and enjoy yourself. And if someone piques your interest, you can take them to the arena. But it can\u2019t be someone who looks weaker than you, unless they insulted you and the clan.\u201d\u201cYes, Father. And I assume I\u2019m not allowed to lose either.\u201d\u201cObviously. If you do, I will take away everything I\u2019ve given you so far. Bradamante and your nanny included.\u201d\u201cI shall keep that in mind.\u201dCyron went downstairs first and mingled with the guests. Although he had organized this banquet for Jin, he didn\u2019t plan on bringing his son everywhere with him and bragging to the guests.Jin chuckled as he watched his father\u2019s back. He then turned around and went down the stairs on the other side.\u2018\u2026Come to think of it, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve chatted with my father like this.\u2019Back in his past life, he could never have imagined a day like this would come; the day he and his father would chat like a typical father & son relationship.Suddenly, a surge of emotions took over him and a lump formed in his throat. But Jin then took a deep breath and erased these feelings.Having a good father-son relationship or making his father proud weren\u2019t part of his objectives for his new life.\u2018What matters most is for me to surpass you, Father.\u2019In truth, that was what Cyron wished for the most from his children. But Jin had no way of knowing that fact.As soon as Jin arrived on the first floor, he immediately sensed countless gazes on him, scrutinizing him. Some of them came from large groups of people who stared at him openly, while others were far more discreet.They were all surprised yet interested.Was this delicate and childish-looking boy really a 5-star knight? The guests asked each other with eyes filled with curiosity.What should Jin do now?Should he confidently walk towards the crowd with an imposing expression like a lion? Or should he act like an innocent child and approach the guests, thanking them for coming today?Jin grinned to himself as he realized he had come up with ridiculous ideas he\u2019d never even carry out.He planned on walking to the center of the hall and standing still with a composed look, as if he had little to no regard for the guests. His position tonight would be at the center of everything, and this would continue being the case for the rest of his life.The future owner of the house merely had to stay still at his position.The ones who had to make an effort to come talk to him were the guests.Jin grabbed a glass of wine from the tray of a busy servant. The expensive and famed wine that even a rich aristocrat only opened on special days was being handed out like cheap water.\u201cHa, haha\u2026 Congratulations, Brother.\u201d\u201cCan we stay by your side for a while?\u201dThe first ones to come talk to Jin were none other than the Tona twins. Jin stared at his brothers standing side by side and smiled.\u201cOf course. How is your Clear Stone training going these days?\u201dAs Jin happily welcomed them, colour returned to the twins\u2019 faces.Amidst all these guests, they wanted to use Jin\u2019s fame to increase their own standing and reputation. Something along the lines of \u2018We\u2019re close to him, everyone!\u2019.Not to mention that Emma had told them to do so.Now that Myu and Anne had given up on them, their nanny had told the twins to get on Jin\u2019s good side. Needless to say, Jin had already predicted all this, and he decided to turn the page and put aside his previous enmity towards Emma.That woman was quite unpleasant to be around, but she seemed to be one of the more perceptive and sharper people of the Runcandel Clan.\u201cIt\u2019s getting better these days. We changed our main weapons to a greatsword and a chainsword as advised by Uncle Zed, and it\u2019s so much better now.\u201d\u201cReally? That\u2019s great. I\u2019m always cheering for you two, Elder Brothers. You know that, right?\u201d\u201cO-Of course! Of course we do. It\u2019s so reassuring to know you have our backs.\u201dAs he awkwardly replied, Daytona mustered all the courage inside him and placed his arm on Jin\u2019s shoulders.Meanwhile, Jin found the twins\u2019 fidgeting and their desperate attempts quite endearing and let his brother do as he pleased.Instead, he quietly whispered in Daytona\u2019s ear.\u2018Once you\u2019ve done enough acting and are satisfied, get moving. And tell Emma to keep making good use of her sharp wit in the future.\u2019Daytona barely managed to prevent his face from showing his terror and nodded discreetly. Afterwards, the Tona twins stayed for another five minutes making small talk with Jin before taking their leave.The twins\u2019 withdrawal was like the breaking of a dam. Once they had emptied the spot, the guests who had been glancing at the star of the night began approaching him one after another.Thanks to the Tona twins, the guests had learned that Jin wasn\u2019t as irritable or ill-tempered as Luna from the past. Most of the guests tonight had also attended the banquet from nineteen years ago to congratulate Luna for becoming a 5-star knight at the age of 15.And back then, they had all learned of how bad-tempered and cold-hearted Luna was\u2026 There was no way anyone could ever forget.\u201cNice to meet you. I am Julard Ken from the Ken Clan.\u201d\u201cA pleasure to meet you, Sir Julard Ken. Does the food prepared by the Runcandel Clan suit your tastes?\u201d\u201cNice to meet you. I am Seager Ken, also from the Ken Clan.\u201d\u201cLikewise. I am Jin Runcandel. I\u2019ve always wanted to meet people from the Ken Clan who are renowned for their spearmanship.\u201d\u201cHaha, we came running here as fast as possible when we heard the young master of the Runcandel Clan had become a 5-star knight. Pleasure to meet you! I am Jonsina Perral of the Dragon King Knights.\u201d\u201cOh, so you are Sir Jonsina! My nanny has often told me stories of your heroic exploits when I was younger. It\u2019s an honour to finally meet you.\u201dAnd so, the guests formally yet warmly greeted Jin one after another. Suddenly, one titanic man loomed over Jin, rumpled his hair and spoke loudly in a casual and friendly manner.\u201cHaha, so you\u2019re Jin Runcandel! I was so curious to know what brat had reached the 5-star stage at 15 years old. Ha, you really are just a little brat ten years younger than me. Good to meet you! The name\u2019s Huger.\u201dHuger didn\u2019t reveal his family name as he believed Jin would recognize him\u2014and recognize, he did. He was a talented, strong, and promising warrior from the Tuko Clan.Maybe it was because he was respected and looked up to in his clan, but Huger seemed to have forgotten that he was at the Garden of Swords\u2014the Runcandel Clan\u2019s main house\u2014and that he had to show proper manners.And so, Jin gently smiled and replied.\u201cOh, yeah, good to meet you, Huger.\u201dThe air surrounding them immediately became heavy. Tension spread amongst the guests who were watching their interaction.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 \u2013 Banquet (4)[Translator \u2013 kkoo][Proofreader \u2013 ykiu]Huger\u2019s vigorous laughter and excitement disappeared, and his face hardened.One second\u2026 two seconds\u2026 three seconds\u2026 four seconds\u2026 five seconds\u2026Jin waited for Huger to make up for his mistake, while Huger\u2019s expression slowly began showing displeasure.This wasn\u2019t some complicated issue. Even Jonsina Perral\u2014who was entering his fifties this year\u2014was showing proper respect to a boy decades younger than him. So Huger\u2014who had yet to turn thirty\u2014had no right to speak informally to Jin.\u201cAh, I\u2019m not sure the food we\u2019ve prepared will suit that tactless and rude cakehole of yours, Huger.\u201dJin followed up and spoke softly, to which Huger\u2019s ears turned bright red. Many guests were watching the two of them. The anger and slander made Huger\u2019s blood boil and pump faster through his veins.\u201cOi, Mr. Outstanding Brat. Are you trying to embarrass me just because I spoke a bit casually? You may be a Runcandel, but in the world of warriors and martial artists, I\u2019m your senior by far. I was just being friendly since you\u2019re an impressive rookie, so don\u2019t get ahead of yourself!\u201dHuger spoke as if he couldn\u2019t believe the absurdity of the boy.But Jin realized he had to explain the current situation in great detail to get across the moron\u2019s empty head.\u201cListen carefully, Huger of the Tuko Clan. Your behaviour was an insult not just to me, but also to all the guests who have shown proper courtesy to me. If you really care about senior-junior relations, then you should\u2019ve been far more careful than usual.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThe first and second flag-bearers of the Ken Clan, Sir Jonsina Perral of the Dragon King Knights, and everyone else. Aren\u2019t they all your seniors? If you have proper eyes and earholes, you should\u2019ve noticed how they have behaved towards me so far.\u201dJulard and Seager Ken nodded in affirmation, while Jonsina watched with shining eyes as he found the situation interesting.The other onlookers either sighed or whispered to each other.\u201cIf you behave like that, then what does that make of the others\u2014your seniors? Acknowledge your blunder and apologize. I\u2019ll turn a blind eye to this incident if you do, since I\u2019ve already said my piece.\u201dHuger was about to explode in rage, but\u2026Ooooh\u2014!The spectators let out sounds of admiration and awe, while some of them even whistled out loud.\u201cHe\u2019s got you this time, Huger!\u201d\u201cKuhaha, see? I\u2019ve always told you to be more careful in front of others, Huger. My friend, it seems you\u2019ve been taught an important life lesson by the Runcandel young master.\u201d\u201cThe youngest master has saved your life, you know? I\u2019m sure you would\u2019ve gotten in deep trouble later on in life due to your yapping trap. Haha, listen to the young master\u2019s teachings.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell us you\u2019re gonna challenge him to a duel due to your embarrassment. I\u2019d like to think you aren\u2019t such a narrow-minded person.\u201dThe other guests naturally approached Huger and patted him on the back and shoulders to lighten the atmosphere. They were all senior martial artists who were close with Huger.Moreover, Huger was a very simple-minded man. Soon enough, his anger disappeared and he spoke with a light-hearted tone.\u201cHm-hm, since my seniors are saying as such\u2026 Geez, it seems I\u2019ve blundered. I hope you will forgive your foolish junior for his mistake, Seniors and Elders. I\u2019d be grateful if Young Master Jin were to forgive me as well.\u201d\u201cOf course, Sir Huger.\u201dA situation that could\u2019ve escalated terribly had concluded itself in a warm and friendly manner.The slightly shy Huger laughed out loud to wash away his embarrassment and walked away towards his clansmen.After a while, the guests around Jin slowly returned to their original groups. Soon, Luna\u2014who was watching this spectacle from the other side of the banquet hall\u2014slowly approached Jin.\u201cElder Sister Luna.\u201d\u201cHaha, you really do have an innate talent at making enemies, don\u2019t you? You can behave more like a cute and ordinary child from time to time if you want.\u201dClang.The two of them lightly clinked their glasses together.\u201cIf there weren\u2019t so many guests watching us, I would\u2019ve shrugged it off and moved on as well. But just now, I was no different to a representative of the Runcandel Clan, so I had to force myself to become a strict and uncompromising figure of authority.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. But what would you have done had Huger challenged you to a duel? He is still stronger than you. I think he\u2019s around the 6-star stage?\u201d\u201cI believed that it was unlikely. And if he truly challenged me to a duel, the Tuko Clan\u2019s patriarch and elders who were watching nervously from the table over there would\u2019ve come running at full speed to take Huger away from me.\u201dJin discreetly directed his gaze, and Luna turned her attention towards the Tuko Clan\u2019s table. The Tuko Clan\u2019s patriarch was personally scolding Huger for his behaviour.\u201c\u2026Goodness. Did you actually take them into account and calculated the entire situation as it happened?\u201d\u201cYes. Moreover, the Tuko Clan\u2019s patriarch was already frowning when Huger spoke to me informally. He had already realized that his clan member had committed a blunder.\u201d\u201cDid you learn how to deal with conflicts and how to conduct yourself appropriately from an aristocrat or something?\u201d\u201cIf there really is someone who teaches such life lessons, it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea to keep them by my side. The only thing I\u2019m taught here at the Garden of Swords is swordsmanship after all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s more than enough, no\u2026? What else do you need to learn?\u201d\u201cOh, no, someone like Elder Sister doesn\u2019t need to learn anything else. But youngest-born children who are hated by their siblings like me need to learn countless things in order to ensure their survival.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026?\u201dLuna adorably tilted her head with naivety, as if she truly had no idea what Jin was talking about. She was born as a predator and had no need to be wary of others during her entire life. So it wasn\u2019t surprising that Luna found Jin intriguing.On the other hand, Jin was watching his elder sister with amazement and surprise.Meanwhile, Luna thought to herself.\u2018He is as gifted, if not more gifted than I am, but he also has a good head on his shoulders. No wonder someone tried to kill him back at the Storm Castle\u2026 Just which of our siblings noticed Jin\u2019s potential so many years ago?\u2019As the guests watched the two siblings have a friendly chat, they wondered whether Luna was truly the terrifying \u2018White Whale\u2019.Ever since the banquet celebrating her reaching the 5-star stage when she was 15 years old, Luna hadn\u2019t participated in any other parties. Moreover, during her own banquet, she took everyone who approached her to the duelling arena and killed about half of her opponents.People believed that Luna hated parties and being around people like the White Whale from the myths. However, they couldn\u2019t be more wrong. In fact, Luna loved social events more than anyone.To be more precise, she loved hiding her identity and going to pubs down the street to attend their small parties and dance with others.\u201cAnyways, I came to this banquet to congratulate you, but as I thought, this type of event isn\u2019t my cup of tea. I\u2019ll be heading over to another, more enjoyable place now.\u201d\u201cAre you leaving already?\u201d\u201cYeah. You\u2019re still a bit too short to dance with me right now. Once you\u2019ve grown enough, I\u2019ll take you to a fun little place I know of.\u201dThe brother and sister stared at each other and grinned joyfully.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for that day to arrive, Elder Sister.\u201d\u201cOh, before I go, I should leave behind a message to the guests here like you do.\u201dLuna got up from her chair and walked behind Jin. Then, she gave him a big and deep hug from behind.\u2018Geez, why are you doing this? I almost got a heart attack.\u2019Indeed, Jin almost got a heart attack from her sudden actions.\u2018With this, everyone gathered here today will realize that I deeply care for you, won\u2019t they? Then they\u2019ll be less likely to make mistakes and behave rudely towards you out of fear of me. I\u2019ll see you later.\u2019Just as Luna had whispered, the guests witnessing this scene barely managed to stop their astonishment and shock from appearing in their expressions.The\u00a0White Whale\u2014who was known for being awkward around her siblings\u2014was openly and proudly showing her love and affection towards the youngest.Moreover, the men who secretly had a crush on Luna were divided into two groups. One group realized they had to get on Jin\u2019s good side and use the boy to get an opportunity to meet and converse with Luna. Meanwhile, the other group of people were\u2026\u201cUrgh\u2026 I\u2019m so jealous! Fuck! I also want to hug Lady Luna like that, Lord Vishukel! Uuuuugh, that brat is so lucky!\u201dCrazy jealous. And one man in particular was expressing his displeasure. He\u2014who considered himself Luna\u2019s greatest fan\u2014was Bouvard Gaston.\u201cAh! Lord Vishukel, I will definitely write a poem about her tonight. Haaa, even with my perfect transformation skills, I will never be able to make someone as beautiful and stunning as her\u2026\u201dMeanwhile, Vishukel Yvliano\u2019s head was about to explode out of irritation.He had come to attend this banquet using his position as the Yvliano Clan\u2019s next patriarch, but his true objective was to observe the movements and actions of the Runcandel Clan for Kinzelo.He was originally planning on coming alone, but Bouvard begged him to bring him along as Vishukel\u2019s attendant, and threw a fit until the vice-leader of Kinzelo agreed to it.This decision had created so many problems and issues.But the main problem was that \u2018attendants\u2019 of guests weren\u2019t allowed to join the Runcandel banquets. Thus, Vishukel had to beg the Garden to allow Bouvard inside. He even had to convince his little sister to come and used her handicapped legs as an excuse to let the fat-ass inside.However, the only reason behind Bouvard\u2019s wish to attend the banquet\u2026 was to see Luna Runcandel. Vishukel hid his trembling fist that couldn\u2019t wait to punch Bouvard inside his coat pocket.\u201cAaaah, Lord Vishukel. Tonight, I\u2019ll write a poem for Lady Luna and sing it for the entire night. The entire night!\u201d\u201cJust\u2026 shut up for a minute, Bouvard Gaston.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t be like that, Elder Brother. This may be an important issue for Mr. Bouvard. And thanks to Mr. Bouvard, I\u2019m able to attend and observe the Runcandels\u2019 famous banquet called the \u2018single-log bridge\u2019 party.\u201dA woman with beaming eyes spoke to her brother from the wheelchair Bouvard was pushing.Vishukel\u2019s one and only little sister, Margiela Yvliano.\u201cLady Margiela is such an understanding and kind lady.\u00a0Sniff, sniff\u2026 I, Bouvard Gaston, will explore every nook and cranny of this banquet hall for you, Milady!\u201d\u201cThank you, Bouvard.\u201dThe group of three was quite conspicuous due to the wheelchair. In fact, Jin\u2019s attention was caught by them and he was calmly watching them, but he didn\u2019t recognize Vishukel or Bouvard.He didn\u2019t know Vishukel was Kinzelo\u2019s vice-leader in his past life either, while Bouvard had changed his appearance with his transformation skills.After a while, Jin shifted his gaze away from them. People were once again coming to make small talk with him, so he didn\u2019t have the leeway to continue observing them.\u2018It\u2019s tiresome, being the star of the night. In any case, where did those Zipfels go\u2026?\u2019Jin had been searching for the Zipfel visitors who had arrived at the last moment. They were, quite obviously, the guests Jin was most wary of.However, Jin couldn\u2019t find the Zipfel boys and girls amidst the thousand guests in the hall. Maybe they were hiding in one corner of the room, trying not to catch anyone\u2019s attention.\u2018Hm, it\u2019s a bit annoying, but let\u2019s try walking around the hall to look for them.\u2019Jin was about to get off his chair, when suddenly\u2026Clack!Someone laid down their wine glass on Jin\u2019s table and sat down next to him.\u201cMay I dare ask the Runcandels\u2019 rising star for a glass?\u201dAlthough her words were polite, her tone wasn\u2019t the same. It was the voice of a young woman who sounded like she was challenging him.Jin raised his head and made eye contact with the girl. He then couldn\u2019t stop himself from chuckling softly.\u201cAh, you are\u2026\u201d\u201cI am Syris Endorma of the Hidden Palace. It\u2019s an honour to meet you.\u201dSyris smiled thinly with squinted eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 \u2013 Banquet (5)\u2018Of course the Hidden Palace sent an envoy to the Runcandel banquet.\u2019Jin had somewhat expected this reunion.He stared at Syris for a few seconds before grabbing the wine bottle. He then calmly poured her a glass.\u201cSo you are the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter. Likewise, it\u2019s an honour to meet you.\u201dJin handed her glass back as he stayed wary of her.\u2014How could you ever repay a debt to someone like me? Just think of this as a nice memory. And if you remember me from time to time, just bow in the direction of the Hidden Palace whenever you can. Well then, bye!Those were Syris\u2019s words back at Mamit.Back then, she was oddly kind to Jin. Not only had she immediately removed Jin from the list of suspects for the terror attack on the Moonlit Well, she had even rubbed some ointment on his injured shin.She seemed very different from the rumours Jin had heard about her in his past life.Nevertheless, Jin didn\u2019t think much about her show of kindness.\u2018She was probably nice to me on a whim as someone with more power than me.\u2019That was how Jin understood Syris Endorma as a person. Needless to say, this didn\u2019t mean Syris was actually stronger than Jin. She just believed herself to be stronger than him back at Mamit.\u201cI am quite jealous of you for growing so strong so quickly, even though we are the same age. How envious I am of your blessed Runcandel blood and body.\u201dAlthough she was expressing her envy, Syris herself was no ordinary girl either. She was already in the middle phase of the 4-star stage and was still growing at an incredible speed.\u201cIndeed, we Runcandels are fortunate to have these blessed bodies. However, the Hidden Palace\u2019s bloodline can also be considered blessed, no? I cannot even imagine how much the Master of the Hidden Palace must cherish Milady.\u201d\u201cYes, unlike you, I am an only child. Thus, it is true that I receive a lot of love and attention. Ah, is it considered discourteous to bring up such a topic?\u201dSyris\u2019s gaze softened a little. Her silver hair was naturally swaying, as if to accentuate her beauty.\u201cNot at all. Everyone around the world knows the fact that I\u2019m the youngest-born child of the Runcandels already. In fact, I should be the one envious of you, Lady Syris. It\u2019s quite troublesome having numerous siblings.\u201d\u201cOh my, you speak of such things so casually despite all these eyes and ears watching and listening to us. What if your siblings interrogate you about this later on?\u201d\u201cIs it not considered the youngest child\u2019s privilege to be able to complain whenever and wherever they want? Hahaha. In any case, I would love to visit the Hidden Palace one day. And it may not be a pipe dream if I maintain close relations with Lady Syris from now on.\u201d\u201cHaha, I never expected someone from the Garden of Swords to wish to visit the Hidden Palace\u2026 Alright, we shall send you an invitation in the near future.\u201dBefore Jin could respond, Syris grabbed the wine bottle and poured Jin a glass as well. His attention moved towards the glass, which was now being filled with colour once more. A few minutes went by where the two 15-year-olds didn\u2019t share a word.\u2018I\u2019m quite certain she recognized me. Isn\u2019t it about time for her to bring up that incident?\u2019It wasn\u2019t as if soot could completely hide someone\u2019s face, and he couldn\u2019t change his voice either. Jin was confident Syris had recognized him today.\u2018And if the Hidden Palace\u2019s successor did in fact fail to recognize me, then I\u2019d be greatly disappointed in her.\u2019Syris suddenly leaned closer to Jin.\u201cThere is one thing I\u2019d like to ask you, Young Master Jin Runcandel.\u201d\u201cYes, Lady Syris. Ask away.\u201d\u201cHas the wound on your shin healed already?\u201dFinally, the real conversation was about to begin.Jin smiled and shrugged lightly.\u201cYes, it has, all thanks to a certain outstanding lady\u2014to whom a lowly boy like me will never be able to repay his debt\u2014who rubbed some ointment on it with her own hands.\u201dHe answered in an offhand manner, to which Syris frowned.\u201cYou\u2019re a lot more shameless than you look, Young Master Jin. In this case, you will need to explain to me why you were present at the Moonlit Well in Mamit that day.\u201d\u201cAnd why must I do that?\u201d\u201cOn that day, my subordinate\u2014Ryu of the Hidden Palace\u2019s Seven Swords\u2014didn\u2019t manage to find the culprit behind the magic attack. It was quite a disgraceful incident for all of us. Later on, I even wondered whether the young boy I had released was in fact the culprit.\u201dCrrrrrr.Syris dragged her chair closer to Jin. The two of them were now sitting side by side but staring in each others\u2019 eyes, face to face. There was merely the length of a handspan between their noses.\u201cI see. That is understandable. But magic, you say? As you can see, I am a Runcandel. Do you believe I\u2019d be the culprit? My hand has only ever held a sword since birth, never a magician\u2019s staff.\u201d\u201cOf course, I am of the same opinion. However, I assume that you were at Mamit that day on a mission for the Runcandel Clan. So it is possible that you found the task difficult to achieve alone and hired a magician to help you out.\u201dSyris ground her teeth and continued talking.\u201cMoreover, no matter how much I think about it, the only people worthy of being assassination targets of the Runcandel Clan on that day at the Moonlit Well were our guards from the Hidden Palace. Thus, as the Captain of the Hidden Palace\u2019s Seven Swords, this isn\u2019t an issue I can simply forget about.\u201dAlthough she was speaking softly and calmly, there was a hint of killing intent in her voice.The moment she had seen Jin\u2019s face in the banquet hall, she was absolutely certain that Jin had been sent to Mamit to assassinate one or more of the Hidden Palace guards.Moreover, she was disappointed in herself for having failed to recognize the culprit behind the attack on her subordinates and for foolishly showing good will to the boy.\u2018She thinks that I attacked the Moonlit Well because my targets were the Hidden Palace guards. Well, I guess she\u2019s half-right since I did end up injuring some of the guards while trying to kill Alkaro.\u2019Having read through Syris\u2019s intentions, Jin continued feigning ignorance.\u201cHm, I thought we were getting along quite well, so I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re acting like this, Lady Syris.\u201d\u201cHmph! So you plan on pleading innocent until the end. Alright, then. If that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be, I have an idea of my own.\u201d\u201cMay I ask what this plan of yours is?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll drag you to the duelling arena and beat you up like a sandbag! Once I\u2019m done, I\u2019ll spit on that contemptible smug face of yours. I challenge you to a duel, Jin Runcandel.\u201d\u201cGoodness\u2026\u201dJin urgently checked his surroundings to see if anyone had heard Syris\u2019s declaration.Fortunately, no one appeared to have heard her as she was whispering to him from up close.\u201cShould I say it louder? Let\u2019s go. You need to pay for ridiculing me back then.\u201dAt this rate, Jin wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid fighting her.\u2018Syris would be the perfect opponent for me to test my current swordplay skills on. But\u2026\u2019The Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s only child, Syris Endorma. She was definitely strong and talented for her age, but\u2026 Jin remembered his father\u2019s words.\u201cLady Syris. I\u2019m terribly sorry, but I cannot accept your challenge.\u201d\u201cIs it because you\u2019re not confident in yourself?\u201d\u201cAh, the thing is\u2026 My father gave me a stern warning not to duel anyone weaker than myself.\u201dCrack!The wine glass Syris was holding with two fingers broke at the stem. Her now-clenched fist was trembling like crazy.\u201cWhat\u2026 did you just say?\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t misunderstand. I would love to duel you, Lady Syris. However, I cannot go against my father\u2019s orders.\u201d\u201cYou little\u2026! Haaaaa\u2026!\u201dSyris glared at Jin with bloodshot eyes, but soon sighed deeply to compose herself. As she regained her calm, Syris carefully placed the pieces of broken glass in her hand onto the table.\u201cYou seem to enjoy messing with me, Young Master Jin. Then, should I give you a taste of your own medicine?\u201dSyris suddenly grabbed Jin\u2019s hand and placed it on her thigh.\u201cNow, if I were to shout out \u2018Kyaa, where do you think you\u2019re touching?!\u2019 and shoved you away\u2026\u201dJin hurriedly blocked her mouth with his other hand. He then chuckled to himself and nodded in defeat.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to go that far, then I guess I have no choice. Let us make our leave quietly.\u201d\u201cYou should\u2019ve said so earlier.\u201dThe two of them stood up simultaneously and made their way to the door.However, the few people who had been observing them couldn\u2019t help but misunderstand.\u201cHow immoral\u2026 Depraved\u2026 Did you see that, Mary? The youngest put his hand on her thigh\u2026 And I think they even kissed. Do kids these days actually behave like that the moment they make eye contact with a stranger? Unbelievable. Where do they think they\u2019re going?\u201dAt the table on the other side was Dipus Runcandel gulping down wine with his sister Mary. From their position, it almost looked like Jin had kissed Syris when he blocked her mouth with his hand.\u201cWe\u2019ve got countless empty rooms nearby, so I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll just go to one of those. Stop thinking about them, Elder Brother. They\u2019re all grown up already. They\u2019re fifteen.\u201d\u201cGoodness gracious. Are you telling me you also behaved like that when you were fifteen?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s none of your business. Or do you think you can handle the truth?\u201d\u201cForget it\u2026\u201d\u201cJust drink some more wine. Whether it be the Master of the Hidden Palace\u2019s daughter or our youngest sibling, they won\u2019t be able to date others freely in a couple of years. So let them have their fun while they still can.\u201d***The duelling arena was still quiet.The combatants and spectators would begin gathering here once midnight passed. It appeared Jin and Syris would do the honour of having the first duel of this banquet.Jin actually preferred this silence. Defeating Syris in front of countless guests would\u2019ve been far too cruel to the girl.Once they entered the arena, the guardian knights stationed inside raised their blades in salutation.\u201cHave you come to duel, Young Master?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Other than the medic, you may all take a break outside. Oh, and bring us two decent swords to use.\u201d\u201cYes. We shall seal off the arena until your duel is over.\u201dThe sharp-witted guardian knight replied to Jin, and the boy nodded in satisfaction.\u201cThat would be perfect.\u201dThe medic also read the room and left Jin and Syris alone. He would remain in the waiting room until the battle ended.Now, there were only two people standing inside the wide, round arena. Not long afterwards, the guardian knight returned with two swords. Jin told Syris to choose her weapon first.\u201cPlease choose the one that best fits in your hand, Lady Syris.\u201d\u201cJin Runcandel. Your arrogance pierces through the skies, even though you\u2019re just an ordinary 5-star knight.\u201dSyris didn\u2019t bother comparing the blades and simply grabbed the one closest to her.Once she got in her stance and raised her weapon, the air around her changed completely. The burning anger in her eyes was replaced with icy-cold concentration, and the sword she held diagonally didn\u2019t show any visible trembling.\u2018So this is how I get to experience the famous Hidden Palace\u2019s swordsmanship from the rumours.\u2019An ordinary 5-star knight.That was how Syris had described Jin. And she wasn\u2019t wrong. Syris knew that Jin had yet to learn the Runcandels\u2019 secret techniques and decisive killing moves.On the other hand, while Syris was still at 4-star, she was the Hidden Palace\u2019s only successor. That was why she could openly look down on Jin, who had reached a higher stage than her.\u201cBefore we begin, I want you to promise me something.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIf I win, you must tell me everything related to the incident at Mamit. Not a single piece of information left out, do you understand?\u201d\u201cI understand. In that case, if I win, Lady Syris will have to forget our coincidental encounter that day. You will never have seen me that day. Today is the first time you will have met me.\u201d\u201cLooks like you truly were doing something fishy. Come at me!\u201dAs soon as she finished talking, Jin dashed and reduced the distance between them. He was planning on overpowering her with the vast difference in their physical capabilities.Sckrrrr\u2014!Suddenly, a strange cold energy swirled around Syris\u2019s sword and froze her blade.It was the main reason why the Hidden Palace could stand tall in the middle of the West Sea, as well as the power that symbolized the Endorma bloodline.The \u2018Myriad Iceblades\u2019.______Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euTranslator\u2019s Corner:AAAAAH! Another cliffhanger!!!! The author just loves torturing their readers!!!This is by far my favourite chapter in this novel as of now! Loved Jin\u2019s interactions with Syris and his siblings\u2019 reaction to their \u201cimmoral\u201d behaviour lmaoWelp, it\u2019s the end of volume 2!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 \u2013 Banquet (6)[Translator \u2013 Koko can\u2019t wait to read this chapter][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is excited for the fight]Sharp and hard crystals of ice were swirling around Syris\u2019s blade.Although it was the innate power of the Endorma bloodline used to kill their opponents, Jin couldn\u2019t help but find her figure beautiful and breathtaking, shining under the crystal lights.Every time she thrust her sword, the small crystals broke apart and reflected the moonlight.The cold energy\u2019s crystals were spread apart densely like a net and shone brilliantly. And while it gave Jin the urge to touch these beautiful floating shards, they were lethal weapons that would tear him apart.Craack!The two blades collided, and the sound of ice breaking echoed in the arena. Had Jin not covered his sword with aura instinctively, his weapon would\u2019ve shattered into bits and pieces.\u2018So this is the rumoured\u00a0Myriad Iceblades.\u2019Most people would\u2019ve been bewildered when suddenly facing the\u00a0Myriad Iceblades, but Jin didn\u2019t show any change in his expression.\u201cIt\u2019s still too early to be surprised, Jin Runcandel!\u201d\u2018Um, I\u2019m not really surprised\u2026\u2019 or so Jin would\u2019ve liked to reply, but his opponent had such an elated and triumphant face that he didn\u2019t want to spoil her mood.So he didn\u2019t say anything and calmly dodged her attack with nimble footwork. Although Jin had some time and room to spare, Syris believed he had narrowly avoided her blade.As Jin adjusted the distance between them and continued retreating, a wide grin grew on Syris\u2019s face.\u201cYou\u00a0will\u00a0tell me everything related to that day.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be so sure. I could\u2019ve cut you down just now if I wished for it.\u201dIndeed, it would\u2019ve been possible had he used spiritual power, so Jin was technically telling the truth.\u201cLooks like your bluffs are 5-star like your swordsmanship!\u201dSyris swung her sword with full power once again.There are many cases where a 4-star defeats a 5-star in a duel of pure swordsmanship. Thus, if you added the\u00a0Myriad Iceblades\u00a0and Syris\u2019s abundant fighting experience into the equation, it was beyond doubt that she would win this duel. At least, that\u2019s what Syris was thinking.Shhhrk! Shrrrrk!Every time her sword was swung, the air around the blade froze.It was a highly dangerous power. In fact, the rumours say that an Endorma who masters the\u00a0Myriad Iceblades\u00a0can freeze an entire ocean.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d use your secret technique right off the bat, Syris. As the youngest child who has yet to learn the clan\u2019s secret techniques, it\u2019s quite disheartening to watch.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem!\u201dJin didn\u2019t counterattack and simply continued concentrating on his defense. Thus, Syris believed that her victory was guaranteed.A horizontal slash. Lower slash. Now a diagonal.Syris\u2019s swordplay was fierce yet drew flexible trajectories. Jin threw his body around to dodge and fend off her attacks.Although it appeared as if he was being pushed back, Jin was waiting for an opening. Moreover, the fact that he was able to ward off her sword every time proved his swordsmanship\u2019s superiority to Syris\u2019s.Soon enough, Syris realized that her opponent was more composed than she had expected.\u2018I guess a 5-star is still a 5-star. He was narrowly dodging and parrying my attacks earlier, but as we continue fighting, his true character and skills are showing.\u2019It took a genius to know another genius.Syris admitted the fact that she had underestimated Jin. His swordsmanship was clearly far more advanced than hers.\u2018But that\u2019s the extent of it. The\u00a0Myriad Iceblades\u00a03rd Form can easily make up for the difference.\u2019The\u00a0Myriad Iceblades\u00a03rd Form. It was a technique that the Endormas called \u2018Avalanche\u2019. Syris could only use this technique a single time. Its consumption of aura and cold energy was severe, so it was a last resort she could only use at a decisive moment in a duel.\u2018His strength and stamina are superior to mine, so there\u2019s no need to drag out this fight. When he finishes reading my attack pattern and finally counterattacks, I\u2019ll turn the tables on him and finish this once and for all!\u2019Clang! Clang! Skrrrt!Their messy and chaotic duel slowly but gradually came to a stalemate. As time passed, both of them were getting used to each other\u2019s movements.But there was no reason to let the fight drag out.And Syris wasn\u2019t the only one thinking that. Jin was slowly changing to a footwork that put him on the offensive, and he had the same thoughts as his opponent.\u2018Syris should have recognized the difference in our skills by now, and she must be preparing to deal a decisive blow to end the fight. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll use some secret technique, but the question is: how powerful is it going to be?\u2019Jin couldn\u2019t quite estimate the strength of her secret technique as he had never confronted someone using the\u00a0Myriad Iceblades.Therefore, Jin decided to use the most powerful \u2018secret technique\u2019 he himself knew.Back when he was at the Storm Castle, he wasn\u2019t just reading the secret tomes underground in order to kill time. Needless to say, Syris didn\u2019t know that Jin already knew several secret techniques of various martial clans from history.Before Jin could decide on his countermeasure, Syris boldly charged at him. She yelled loudly and swung her sword down, aimed at Jin\u2019s shoulder. A few strands of her long, silver hair got in the way of her blade and were sliced off.\u201cIt\u2019s over, Jin!\u201dFwoooosh!Suddenly, a violent blizzard materialized in the arena, swirling around in a circle with Syris at the center. But unlike the blizzards that form naturally, when the icy winds reached Jin, he received small gashes on his forehead.The sharp winds were slicing away at his clothes, and the cold air was making his neck and joints stiff.Myriad Iceblades\u00a03rd Form, Avalanche!Once Syris finished generating this snowstorm, the arena was completely dyed white. Crystals of ice formed and exploded with dull sounds, and pure-white aura crashed into the obstacles like an avalanche.The scenery had unexpectedly changed to that of a snowy mountain peak in winter. The snow/aura blocked Jin\u2019s vision, and the wave of cold energy made it impossible to breathe.At the center was Syris with an enthusiastic expression showing her confidence in her victory.But she then saw Jin wearing the same look on his face. It was the glow and grin of a human who knew they had already defeated their opponent.\u2018How come?\u2019The avalanche-esque snowstorm was already rampaging in the arena, so even if he was a 5-star genius swordsman, he wouldn\u2019t be able to overcome the Hidden Palace\u2019s secret technique.Although she felt uneasy for a short moment, Syris didn\u2019t pay it much heed. The main force which prevented the world\u2019s two superpowers\u2014the Runcandels and Zipfels\u2014from conquering the Hidden Palace was this power.Stagger.Syris stumbled as she had used up all the energy and aura within her. Since she had avoided hitting Jin in the vital areas, he would most likely survive this ordeal. But at the very least, the Runcandels\u2019 youngest child would fear her from today onwards.However, Syris couldn\u2019t savour the taste of victory yet.Akin to an ice pick, a single handle-less blade pierced through the thick layer of white, snowy energy that blocked their vision.\u2018What? How did he\u2014!\u2019Syris hastily fixed her posture\u2026 At least, she tried to. The will wasn\u2019t enough on its own. Her body\u2019s lack of strength from using the secret technique prevented it from following her brain\u2019s orders. She could only wait for the next sequence of events to occur in her bad posture.Shhhhrk!A single flash of light streaked through the snowstorm.The blade didn\u2019t contain a god\u2019s power like Syris\u2019s sword\u2014in which she had injected her cold energy. In fact, the blade wasn\u2019t even covered in aura, the universal and basic power that every knight used.It merely appeared to be an ordinary steel edge without a handle.Syris couldn\u2019t accept the fact that such an unremarkable weapon was tearing through her Avalanche.\u201cThis can\u2019t\u2014\u201dBe!She couldn\u2019t even finish her sentence, because the annoyingly persistent blade coming at her was about to explode.Crrrk!Crack!Syris clearly witnessed the steel crumbling on itself as dents formed on it, along with a bright and dangerous glow escaping through the cracks on the metal. Before she could even realize what was happening, a loud and urgent yell pierced her ears.\u201cGet down!\u201dIt was the boy whom she had been fighting until now.Syris didn\u2019t plan on listening to him. Even if she was in great peril and could lose her life, accepting her opponent\u2019s mercy in order to avoid the danger was a greater humiliation than being defeated.BOOOOOOM!Jin\u2019s steel blade that had been compressed to the size of a knuckle exploded.Tiny steel shards flew forward. Each little fragment was shining with aura.Although the weapon that tore through the storm wasn\u2019t covered in aura, its blade was filled to the brim with energy.It was the decisive and killing move called\u00a0\u2018Blade Storm\u2019\u00a0of the ancient and ruined clan of swordsmen\u2014the Attila Clan. Since they had been destroyed by the Runcandels, there were barely any records left of their swordplay and techniques. In other words, this move was quite literally Jin\u2019s secret technique.This was the strongest technique Jin had mastered amongst all the ones he had learned from the secret tomes beneath the Storm Castle. Even if she was a user of the\u00a0Myriad Iceblades, Syris wouldn\u2019t be able to handle the\u00a0Blade Storm\u2019s\u00a0firepower as a 4-star knight.\u2018Dammit!\u2019Either Jin had overestimated the power of the\u00a0Myriad Iceblades, or the Attila Clan\u2019s secret technique was far more powerful than he had expected.Whatever the answer was, Jin was regretting having used the\u00a0Blade Storm. If she didn\u2019t dodge it, Syris would definitely die. If not, she would at least be crippled for life.Jin\u2019s heart was beating rapidly in worry of her possible death.Meanwhile, Syris clenched her teeth to suppress her instincts of wanting to save herself by crouching, since she didn\u2019t want to be humiliated.And so, a second went by.\u2018Ah!\u2019\u2018Ah\u2026\u2019Once the\u00a0Blade Storm\u00a0subsided, the two fighters exclaimed to themselves.One had a sense of relief, while the other groaned in mortification.Syris had crouched just as Jin had shouted.\u201cAre you alright?\u201dJin threw away the sword handle that was remaining in his hand and grabbed Syris by the shoulders. She was just staring into the emptiness with wide eyes due to the big shock.This was her first ever defeat since the first time she grabbed a sword in her life.\u2018I\u2026 crouched because\u2026 I was afraid of dying or getting hurt? I, Syris Endorma, was afraid?\u2019When victory was within hand\u2019s reach but the\u00a0Blade Storm\u00a0turned the tables, Syris had made up her mind not to avoid the blow. She believed that she wasn\u2019t a weak human who needed to rely on her enemies\u2019 mercy and pity.However, no matter how strong her pride was, no matter how important her honour was compared to her life, no matter how iron-willed she was, she was still a 15-year-old girl. She was too young to willingly and forcibly suppress her survival instincts and desire to live.\u201cPhew, things could\u2019ve taken a dangerous turn just now. I deeply apologize for that.\u201dOnce he made sure Syris was unscathed, Jin sighed and put a hand on his chest.He could tell what the silent Syris was thinking. No matter what he says to cheer her up, she would still be crushed by this sense of defeat.\u2018Geez, I\u2019m so\u2026 I should\u2019ve held myself back and narrowly lost to her\u2026 She\u2019s just a kid.\u2019If one counted the total number of years Jin had lived, he was already in his forties. When he realized that he was almost the cause of death of a young 15-year-old girl, he was crushed by a sense of guilt.Moreover, she could either become a rival or a friendly associate in the future, yet he was about to kill her.Jin stared at Syris for a short moment as he sorted out his thoughts on what to tell her. But he didn\u2019t need a lot of time to ponder.\u201cIf I were in the same situation, I would have avoided the blow as well. And you also would\u2019ve yelled at me to get down. So I won\u2019t say any more about this incident.\u201dHe knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to cheer her up. And he didn\u2019t plan on forcing himself to try to console her.So once he said his piece, Jin merely turned around and walked away. It was best to just leave her alone in times like this.\u201cJin Runcandel.\u201dBut before he could leave, Syris called out to him and stared into his eyes. Light had returned in her gaze. In fact, her gaze was brighter and deeper than before, as if she had been enlightened and changed on the inside.\u201cYou\u2019re still bleeding from the forehead from when I cut you earlier.\u201dShe took a few steps towards Jin and took out a handkerchief from her inner pocket.She then silently wiped his wound and even rubbed some of the healing ointment on it. It was the same ointment as the one she had rubbed on his shin in Mamit.\u201cWith this, I\u2019ve repaid you for saving my life.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you considering the value of your life a bit too cheaply? I don\u2019t think the Hidden Palace\u2019s successor\u2019s life can be repaid with some ointment on a graze.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I rubbed the ointment extremely carefully since you just saved me out of pity. From now on, I\u2019ll be an invaluable and distinguished person again, so in the future, I hope I can get an opportunity to save you.\u201dThey both moved towards the arena\u2019s exit. Once they took a step outside, Syris added one final comment.\u201cOh, and from now on, today\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\u201cIndeed, it seems I\u2019ve won the bet. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d***Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 \u2013 Banquet (7)[Translator \u2013 Koko absolutely loves this story arc][Proofreader \u2013 yuki wants to see more fights yes yeS YES]Jin attended the banquet the following day as well.Fortunately, not many people were aware of his duel with Syris. In fact, many were misunderstanding their relationship just like Dipus Runcandel, and their beliefs were reinforced today.Had they actually duelled, the winner would\u2019ve been bragging about their victory to others at the banquet. Nevertheless, Jin and Syris remained silent and didn\u2019t bring up the topic, so people naturally came to the conclusion that they had had a secret love affair last night.The banquet continued in a similar fashion as the day before.Jin stayed seated in one location, and the guests came introducing themselves to him. However, there were less people crowding around him. Since the secret and veiled child of the Runcandels had already revealed himself last night, the guests were busier dealing with their own favours and grudges amongst themselves.Ever since Jin and Syris had left the arena last night, countless other duels have been occurring nonstop until now.And since people were allowed to spectate the fight, there were more guests gathered at the arena than the banquet hall.The \u2018single-log bridge\u2019 party had begun for real.Nevertheless, Jin was sitting at the center of the hall, sipping on his wine as he looked around in glee.\u2018I should be able to meet those Zipfels today.\u2019Jin was curious to know how high their mastery of magic was. Since he had heard that the four Zipfel guests were between 15 and 20 years of age, they were the best magicians he could compare himself to.Moreover, if he got the chance, he wanted to ask them about the Kollon Ruins. But Jin changed his mind as it was probably a bad idea.\u2018I\u2019ll get a lot of free time once I become a provisional flag-bearer. I can just go investigate the Kollon Ruins with Murakan whenever I want in the near future.\u2019And if he received Murakan\u2019s help, Jin could easily find and take the mirror artifact called the \u2018Fountain of Mana\u2019 for himself.\u2018I\u2019ll make sure the Zipfels can\u2019t mass-produce 7-star magicians like a factory this time around.\u2019Once his thoughts reached that conclusion, Jin laid his glass on the table and exhaled deeply.Meow.Meooow.He suddenly noticed a black cat naively walking around the banquet hall. The guests were surprised by the presence of a small cat at the Runcandel main house, so they couldn\u2019t help but stare at it.\u2018That stupid\u2026!\u2019Jin was certain Murakan had sneaked inside without Gilly\u2019s knowledge. The boy wasn\u2019t sure whether the dragon had noticed his gaze on him, but Murakan raised his tail straight and catwalked to the center of the hall.He then safely arrived at his destination: on top of Syris\u2019s lap.The girl was satisfied by the cute pet\u2019s affection towards her and she started stroking it. After a short while, she looked at the nametag on the cat\u2019s collar and burst out in laughter.\u2014Nabi RuncandelThat was the name written on the tag. Syris laughed out loud for a long time, before composing herself and wiping her tears. She then got up and approached Jin.\u201cDid you come up with his name, Young Master Jin?\u201dShe was speaking in a soft tone, a complete 180 compared to her attitude back at the arena.The way she skillfully carried him showed her abundant experience with animals. Jin smiled awkwardly and nodded.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBefore coming here, I imagined you to be a battle maniac obsessed with swords, but you have quite a few surprising sides to yourself. May I play with him for a short while?\u201d\u201cFeel free to.\u201dAfter receiving his approval,\u00a0Syris bowed and left the hall.\u2018Did she really come to me just to ask that?\u2019Jin found her quite peculiar but somewhat likeable. Then, someone else unexpectedly sat next to him.\u201cOh! So we finally meet again, Jin Runcandel! You have no idea how difficult it was finding you, haha.\u201dA young man wearing a genuinely friendly smile spoke to Jin enthusiastically.Jin knew this boy, as well as all the feats and accomplishments he\u2019d achieve in the future.However, he didn\u2019t want to act familiar with him, even though he was a Zipfel Jin had been looking forward to seeing.\u201cWho\u2026 are you?\u201d\u201cGoodness! To think I\u2019d hear such a disheartening greeting from you at our reunion! How could you forget about me? I\u2019ve been thinking about you every day all this time.\u201d\u201cSo who on earth are you?\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, try guessing. The first two letters of my name are \u2018Be\u2019. Haha, do you remember now?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d\u201cDammit! We first met each other at the Mitel Kingdom\u2019s transfer gate. Does it not ring a bell?\u201d\u201cNope, no bells ringing at all.\u201dAt this point, Jin found their interaction amusing, so he continued feigning ignorance.\u201cHahaha\u2026 To think that you don\u2019t remember even with all these clues\u2026 Jin, I think you have the memory of a goldfish. Listen carefully. My name is Bera\u2014\u201d\u201cBeradin Zipfel. You\u2019re still as oblivious as ever. I was indirectly saying that I didn\u2019t want to act like your acquaintance. Yet you didn\u2019t get the hint and continued bringing up the topic. How tiresome.\u201d\u201cOh, is that what it was\u2026?\u201dTo think that this boy would actually become a 9-star magician by 30 years old and get selected as the succeeding patriarch. Jin had also realized how clueless Beradin was on their first encounter, but this was just on another level. He was speechless at how ridiculous the situation was.Even though Jin had bluntly said how tiresome Beradin was, the Zipfel boy didn\u2019t let it bother him for too long. He wore a gloomy expression for a short while, but soon resumed the conversation.\u201cYou have no idea how much I was looking for you since yesterday. Geez, the Runcandels\u2019 banquet hall is enormous. No matter how much I walked around, I just couldn\u2019t find you. I think I roamed the hall for two hours or something.\u201d\u201cGosh, no matter how large this hall is, it\u2019s just a banquet hall. Are you seriously telling me you didn\u2019t find me after searching for two hours?\u201dJin spoke as he recalled the previous day.He was the center of attention and guests continued approaching him. He was also located at the center of the hall, so even if someone didn\u2019t want to see him, they\u2019d inevitably notice the boy at least once during the evening.\u201cYeah, I\u2019m serious. Had I used magic, I could\u2019ve found you in ten seconds, but isn\u2019t it banned to use magic at the Runcandel estate? I just kept walking around, but always saw the same faces around me.\u201d\u201cIs that so.\u201d\u201cAnyways, it\u2019s so good to see you again, Jin. Has it been five years already? To think you\u2019re already a 5-star. I knew you\u2019d be the cause of some big event the last time I saw you, haha. But I haven\u2019t been lazing around all this time either. I\u2019ve already reached the\u2026\u201dThe directionally-challenged boy paused to add a dramatic effect.\u201c6-star stage! Kuhahaha, I\u2019m already a 6-star magician. In other words, I\u2019m one level higher than your swordsmanship!\u201dBeradin was three years older than Jin, so he was a 6-star magician by the age of 18. This was quite the achievement. It was worthy of being celebrated just like Jin\u2019s exceptional growth. However\u2026\u2018He\u2019s only 6-star?\u2019Jin was greatly surprised as Beradin\u2019s level was far lower than he had expected. Putting aside the foolish act of revealing his abilities in enemy territory, Jin was shocked that the most talented pureblood of the Zipfel Clan was only a 6-star magician.\u2018I feel like my mana will be about 7-star in three years, though\u2026\u2019Had he overestimated Beradin due to his achievements in Jin\u2019s past life? Or was he lying about his own growth to trick the Runcandels?\u201cSeeing your shocked face makes the time I spent searching for you totally worth it, Jin. I\u2019m looking forward to the day I finally get to fight you. I was greatly enlightened by our last encounter and trained like crazy. Try your best catching up to me, Jin. Now, let\u2019s have a toast.\u201dJin didn\u2019t bother revealing the true reason behind his shock and raised his glass of wine with a bewildered face.As the cups hit each other, Jin barely suppressed the smile that was about to grow on his face.\u2018If Beradin was only able to reach 6-star by 18 years old\u2026 the next person to reach the peak of magic after Kelliark Zipfel will be me. I\u2019m sure of it.\u2019Jin was reevaluating his own potential objectively. Meanwhile, the unaware Beradin was standing with his chest puffed out as he thought Jin had acknowledged him.\u201cYou should care more about me from now on. I have no doubts that you\u2019ll become the succeeding Runcandel patriarch. So in the future, the Runcandels under your rule will be fighting the Zipfels under mine. Just think about it. Doesn\u2019t that get your blood pumping?\u201dJin smiled softly.\u201cBeradin Zipfel. It seems I need to give you another piece of advice just like five years ago.\u201d\u201cOh, what is it?\u201d\u201cYou should learn to hold your tongue.\u201d\u201cHaha, you say the same thing as my father.\u201d\u201cAnyone would say that after knowing you for more than a minute. Anyways, why did the Zipfels come to the banquet without sending a formal request?\u201dThey had come at the last minute, resulting in their second-in-command getting humiliated.Jin silently waited for Beradin\u2019s answer.\u201cOh, that\u2019s because of me. I pestered Uncle Andrei to let me come, saying that I absolutely had to see you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWe just happened to be in Huphester when I heard the news of a banquet celebrating your achievement, so I thought, \u2018This is fate! Fate is letting me see him once again!\u2019, and so I came here.\u201d\u201cIs that it?\u201d\u201cYep, that\u2019s it.\u201dJin was at a loss for words.\u2018Andrei Zipfel\u2014the clan\u2019s second-in-command\u2014actually listened to a kid\u2019s tantrum and came to enemy territory without any preparation?\u2019Jin just couldn\u2019t comprehend Andrei\u2019s thought process using common sense.However, as he dwelled on it a bit longer, he realized how much love, affection, and attention the boy known as \u2018Beradin Zipfel\u2019 was receiving in the clan of magicians.Beradin was already being treated like the next patriarch of the clan.The Zipfel clan was a place where geniuses in magic were a dime a dozen. However, this boy was already being considered the best of the best, despite not being 20 years old yet.Once he realized that, a certain thought went through Jin\u2019s mind.\u2018If we kill Beradin before he can fully mature\u2026 we could deal a terrible blow against the Zipfels.\u2019Even if they killed Beradin, the Zipfels surely had an alternative.Nevertheless, they would lose the only magician of this generation who would reach 9-star by the age of 30.Beradin would surely become the Zipfels\u2019 strongest magician of this generation in the future, and losing him would be a terrible outcome for them.\u201cBeradin.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou should be grateful that we\u2019re in a banquet hall right now.\u201d\u201cKeke, aren\u2019t you being a bit too cold to me? But yeah, I know. I know that your father showed mercy to my uncle. Speaking of which, let me make you a promise. If you ever come to a Zipfel banquet without a formal request, we won\u2019t bring you any harm.\u201dBeradin wore a cunning smile as he scratched the back of his head.\u201cReally? What if I suddenly attacked people in the middle of the hall and sabotaged the banquet?\u201d\u201cI never take back my words. Even if you cause a terror attack, we won\u2019t kill you. If a fight were to break out, I won\u2019t take part in it at the very least.\u201d\u2018What a foolish romanticist,\u2019 thought Jin.Still, he couldn\u2019t put aside the possibility that Beradin knew about the human experiments conducted using forbidden magic inside the Zipfel Clan. However, no matter how stupid Beradin was, Jin couldn\u2019t just bluntly ask questions about the Kollon Ruins as it was risky.Having emptied his glass, Jin suddenly stood up from his seat.\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cSome displeasing creep has been glancing at me since earlier, so I\u2019m off to give him a good scolding.\u201dJin directed his gaze towards the left.Over there was a certain man leering at Jin since a while ago: Bouvard Gaston.\u201cOh, are you starting a fight? Can I watch?\u201dJin ignored Beradin\u2019s question and walked towards Bouvard.\u201cExcuse me, sir. Do you happen to have something you wish to tell me?\u201dVishukel wasn\u2019t next to him. He was looking around the banquet hall with his sister Margiela. That was why Bouvard could act so carelessly with no repercussions\u2026 until now, that is.\u201cUm\u2026 When will Lady Luna return?\u201d\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u201cHehe, I\u2019m talking about Lady Luna. Will she not make another appearance at the banquet? I wanted to give her this\u2026 It\u2019s a poem I wrote all night long, filling it with my love\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha.\u201dJin chuckled and Bouvard took that as an acknowledgement. So far, Jin could just let this insolence pass as just one chubby man\u2019s \u2018foolishness\u2019. He was about to ignore the man as he appeared to be lacking in the brain department.\u2018To think that there\u2019d be a moron disrespectfully and thoughtlessly searching for Elder Sister Luna at the Garden of Swords. Isn\u2019t he an attendant serving the Yvliano Clan? I should warn Lord Vishukel about his attendant\u2019s behaviour sometime before the banquet ends.\u2019However, Bouvard ended up trespassing his limits and infuriating Jin.\u201cHehe, Lady Luna will realize once she reads my poem that I\u2019m not your typical man. In fact, I may even become your brother-in-law in the near future, Young Master Jin. Uhehehe.\u201dEven Beradin\u2014who was silently watching this interaction while sipping on his glass\u2014couldn\u2019t help but spit out his wine once he heard those words.***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Koko absolutely loves this story arc][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is just about ready to strangle a certain character]Join our discord to get the latest news and updates about the translations!\u00a0https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb_______________Translator\u2019s Section (08/06/21):Haha, I love Jin and Beradin\u2019s relationship dynamic.

Skrrt!Jin took the pieces of paper in Bouvard\u2019s hands and tore them in four. The thick stack was easily torn apart like a thin cloth.\u201cIt seems you need a beating, sir.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026?\u201dBouvard\u2019s eyes opened wide as he stared at Jin, dumbfounded. He had no idea why Jin was reacting as such.And that ignorant look of surprise on his face angered Jin even further.\u2018Not only did he thoughtlessly mention Elder Sister\u2019s name, he also wants to be my brother-in-law?\u2019If they weren\u2019t in the banquet hall, Jin would\u2019ve ripped the guest\u2019s tongue out of his mouth immediately.Not only had Bouvard insulted Luna Runcandel with his words, he had basically looked down upon the entire Runcandel Clan. No one was allowed to speak as such of the Runcandels unless they were the Vermont Imperial Family.Needless to say, Bouvard wasn\u2019t trying to offend the Runcandels. The problem was that he was incredibly dull and slow-witted.\u201cHaha, why are you acting like this, Brother-in-law\u2026 I mean, Young Master?\u201dBouvard accidentally called Jin \u2018Brother-in-law\u2019 again, and the boy nearly sent his fist flying at Bouvard\u2019s face on the spur of the moment. However, he closed his eyes and calmed his anger before raising his hand and calling the guardian knights.\u201cDrag this man to the arena.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dClang! Clang!Two guardian knights who were standing by the edge of the hall grabbed Bouvard by the shoulder. To this instant, Bouvard still had no idea why Jin was seething with anger against him.\u2018Did he not like my joke? Is he seriously humiliating someone like this just because of a stupid reason like that? This bratty piece of shit!\u2019He was merely in a shocked mental state.As someone who hadn\u2019t learned any manners or cultural knowledge in life, he would\u2019ve been long dead on the streets, killed by some thugs if not for his \u2018transformation\u2019 ability.People\u2019s attention was directed towards the ruckus. Their eyes were full of curiosity as they observed the man who would become Jin\u2019s first duelling opponent of the banquet (most weren\u2019t aware of Jin\u2019s battle with Syris).\u201cPlease don\u2019t act like this, Young Master! I was merely expressing my love! Everyone in the world has the right to express their love freely!\u201dBouvard continued yelling as he got dragged away, but Jin didn\u2019t bother answering. It wasn\u2019t that Jin had nothing to say to this worthless man in return.\u201cArgh, Young Master Jin! Who on earth treats their guests as such? Release me!\u201dAs they slowly approached the arena, Bouvard felt like livestock being dragged to the slaughterhouse.\u2018Goddammit! Those Zipfel followers should\u2019ve murdered this brat five years ago!\u2019Five years ago, Jin had departed from the Storm Castle. The radical Zipfel followers had disguised themselves as guardian knights and attempted to assassinate Jin.The culprit behind their perfect disguises was Bouvard Gaston. Although he was affiliated with Kinzelo, he often lent a helping hand to the Zipfel followers.Due to his personality, Bouvard would help anyone out as long as they were going to commit acts that would cause chaos in the world. Of course, as long as he himself didn\u2019t get put in danger.\u2018There\u2019s no way he knows I\u2019m the one who transformed those assassins, so why is he acting like this? He\u2019s making a fuss just cuz I called his sister pretty!\u2019In fact, no one else in the world knew that Bouvard was the culprit behind the attack five years ago, as he had been informed that the Zipfel followers who had asked for his help failed their mission and died.\u201cThe duel shall be a barehanded fight.\u201dBefore entering the arena, Jin spoke in a cold voice. Bouvard stayed silent and didn\u2019t consent, so the guardian knights grabbed his head and forcefully made him nod.\u2018B-Bouvard?!\u2019Vishukel Yvliano had coincidentally returned from his tour of the Garden with Margiela. As soon as he saw the spectacle and Bouvard\u2019s involvement, he was greatly shocked and stared in astonishment.\u201cWhat is going on, Elder Brother? Wow! A duel! It seems Mr. Bouvard is having a duel with Young Master Jin!\u201d\u201cThat fucking moron\u2026!\u201dHe had caused trouble in the short time during which the siblings were away.Vishukel was certain that Bouvard had asked Jin to introduce him to Lady Luna, talking about stupid things like love and marriage. Once Vishukel successfully carries out Kinzelo\u2019s grand masterplan, he swore to tear that pig apart and murder him horribly.\u201cSigh\u2026 We should follow them to the arena for the time being, Margiela.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, Elder Brother! I\u2019ve always wanted to see Mr. Bouvard fighting before.\u201dThe siblings weren\u2019t the only ones headed to the arena. Syris had also been watching the spectacle before her with Murakan in her arms.\u2018I was planning on asking him for another duel later on, but what\u2019s this now? Why is he willingly duelling against that man?\u2019Her irritation was unsurprising. Although she wasn\u2019t confident of defeating Jin even if they fought again, she wanted to continue facing him in multiple duels until the end of the banquet.\u201cOh! To think I\u2019d meet the Hidden Palace\u2019s successor in person! It seems it was the correct decision to participate in the banquet this time. You must be Lady Syris Endorma. It is a pleasure to meet you. I am Beradin Zip\u2014\u201d\u201cGet lost.\u201d\u201cAh, yes.\u201dAfter his pitiful attempt at trying to get to know her, Beradin simply followed her from behind to the arena with a sorrowful expression.\u201cBy the way, you should be wary of that cat. It once scratched me on the face, haha. Quite the nasty feline.\u201dSyris completely ignored him as he continued attempting to have small talk with her and entered the spectators\u2019 area in the arena. Even if she knew that he was the rising star of the Zipfels, she would\u2019ve behaved the same way.The arena was filled with excitement and vigor, unlike when Jin had duelled with Syris the previous evening.Countless martial artists were having fights one after another, while the spectators cheered and booed at the top of their lungs.Normally speaking, one had to inform the arena\u2019s host about their intention to duel and wait in line until their turn. However, Jin had no need to follow those rules. As soon as he appeared at the arena, the crowd immediately died down.One guardian knight approached the host and whispered to him the details of Jin\u2019s duel.\u201cNext up is the leading man of the banquet! The rising star of the Runcandels, Young Master Jin will be having a duel!\u201dWaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah~!As the crowd cheered like crazy, Jin warmed his body up and got on the circular stage. He then turned around and spoke to Bouvard.\u201cGet up.\u201dMost of the spectators didn\u2019t recognize Bouvard.But even though his name wasn\u2019t well known, no one looked down on him. They believed that anyone who was worthy enough to come to the Runcandel banquet would be strong.\u201cIs he some hermit who trains in seclusion?\u201d\u201cI hear he came as an attendant of the Yvliano Clan, but he seems quite noteworthy.\u201dAt this stage, Bouvard couldn\u2019t bail out of the duel. Irritation and anger began boiling inside.Even though he had been proving his innocence during the entire walk to the arena, the little brat had completely ignored and humiliated him. It was now time for Bouvard to reveal his skills.\u201cGood! I accept the duel. Try not to regret your decision!\u201dBouvard got on stage and stood before Jin.\u201cYoung Master Jin Runcandel. Allow me to formally introduce myself before the duel. I am Bou\u2014\u201d\u201cSilence. I do not care for your insignificant name. Let us begin.\u201dBefore the host could even announce the beginning of the duel, Jin dashed to his opponent. The spectators deduced that Bouvard had committed a grave offense for Jin to behave in such a way.\u201cKeuk!\u201dHaving not expected the surprise attack, Bouvard took a punch in the cheek and took a couple of steps back. As he winced in pain, foul words and curses escaped his mouth instinctively.But Bouvard was no dunce. Although it wasn\u2019t well known, he was a 6-star martial artist.\u201cHaah!\u201dSwoosh!His fist flew forward at an unbelievable speed one would never expect from a portly man like him. Although his strike appeared quite simple and unsophisticated, Bouvard\u2019s hand was covered in a piercing aura.A fierce counterattack. But Jin calmly avoided the punch.At first sight, Bouvard\u2019s aura appeared to be far more destructive and powerful than Jin\u2019s. The spectators were slightly disappointed since Bouvard was \u2018weaker than expected\u2019, but they still watched in excitement since he was stronger than Jin.\u201cLooks like Young Master Jin chose an opponent stronger than himself.\u201d\u201cAnd that fatty\u2019s specialty seems to be hand-to-hand combat. The Young Master made a poor choice by putting his sword away. He might get defeated and humiliated at this rate.\u201dJust as the audience had observed, Bouvard was skilled in hand-to-hand combat. In fact, if this arena weren\u2019t in the Garden of Swords but in an ordinary city with more average contestants, then Bouvard would attract a lot of attention from the spectators.Meanwhile, Jin was a knight who fought with a sword. So not only did Bouvard have greater aura, he was also better skilled as both duelists were fighting barehanded. It was to no surprise that the audience expected Jin\u2019s defeat.Whack!Bouvard\u2019s follow-up hook struck Jin square in the jaw. Jin felt his legs lose strength, and a soft grin grew on Bouvard\u2019s face.\u2018You dare attempt to lay a finger on the Great Bouvard with such measly skills? I\u2019ll pummel you and make you beg for your life, punk.\u2019However, Bouvard\u2019s smile didn\u2019t last long.\u201cKeuk!\u201dThe stumbling Jin should\u2019ve fallen face first to the floor, but instead, he pounced at Bouvard with an arm clocked back and bloodlust in his eyes.\u2018I punched him straight in the jaw, so how is he still conscious?!\u201dHe had definitely seen Jin\u2019s legs losing strength as well.However, that was merely an act. The Runcandels\u2019 blessed bodies wouldn\u2019t crumble simply from a strike to the jaw. Had Bouvard fought against a Runcandel before, he wouldn\u2019t have let down his guard after successfully hitting Jin.Whack!Jin palm-striked Bouvard straight in the face and a heavy strike echoed in the arena. Bouvard\u2019s nose was flattened and distorted as a string of blood ran down his chin.But he didn\u2019t have time to groan in pain. The Runcandels\u2019 combat style was to show less and less mercy the more the opponent was beaten down.Thwack! Thud! Boom, crack!Another punch to the broken nose, one to the left cheek, his right flank, his solar plexus. Jin\u2019s two fists covered in aura were relentlessly clobbering Bouvard.And it was far from over. Jin then started adding kicks to his movements. In mere seconds, Bouvard was covered in his own blood and was being thrown around the stage like a dirty and bloody rag.\u201cIt appears to be over.\u201d\u201cHe made his opponent let down his guard, followed up with a surprise attack and incessant blows aiming at different parts of the body to be unpredictable. That truly is the best strategy to use against someone stronger than yourself.\u201dThe spectators were disappointed for not seeing Jin\u2019s swordsmanship, but found the actual battle more than entertaining enough. Moreover, the greatest harvest of this duel was being able to observe Jin\u2019s battle style.\u2018I see. Young Master Jin isn\u2019t the kind of person to let his hubris and arrogance hold him back in fights. As soon as he judges that his opponent is stronger than himself, he makes use of every possible strategy at his disposal.\u2019It isn\u2019t uncommon for 5-stars to win against 6-stars in a duel. However, it is quite rare to see the 5-star completely overpower the 6-star like Jin moments ago.It was a one-sided beatdown. Bouvard\u2019s first successful hit was also his last. He then got mercilessly pounded like a sandbag. In fact, he was still being beaten to the ground like minced meat.\u2018I guess it\u2019s about time I stopped. Geez, I get too emotional at times.\u2019Actually, Jin was behaving somewhat reasonably. Had it been another Runcandel, Bouvard would\u2019ve been cut down on the spot before he could finish uttering \u2018brother-in-law\u2019, even if they were in the banquet hall.\u201cPhew.\u201dJin shook both of his hands to get rid of the blood and took in a deep breath. The unconscious Bouvard was twitching on the floor as tears ran down his mangled face.Jin turned around and was about to exit the arena, when he heard a certain lady\u2019s voice amongst the audience.\u201cElder Brother Vishukel! I cannot comprehend the reason behind Young Master Jin\u2019s actions. Wasn\u2019t the victor already decided earlier? How could he beat up an unconscious and vulnerable man in such a cruel manner?!\u201d\u201cM-Margiela?\u201dThe shocked Vishukel stared dumbfounded at his little sister.\u201cYoung Master Jin went too far. He was bullying the weak. The unconscious man down there is our friend, is he not? Will you just stand here and do nothing, Elder Brother? Your little sister is very disappointed in you.\u201dBouvard Gaston. That unpleasant man was neither weaker than Jin nor was he their friend\u2026Vishukel wanted to answer as such, but he couldn\u2019t as his one and only sibling\u2019s words weighed on his mind\u2026\u2014Very disappointed in you.\u201c\u2026Are you telling me to duel Young Master Jin?\u201d\u201cYes. I wish Elder Brother would teach Young Master Jin a lesson. Of course, in an honourable and dignified manner, unlike the behaviour Young Master Jin showed us earlier.\u201d\u201cOh, what a flamboyant young lady!\u201d\u201cVishukel! You should listen to your sister\u2019s request. Haha, an interesting battle is about to unfold.\u201dIn the end, Vishukel went down to the stage due to his sister and the audience\u2019s pressure and expectations.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 \u2013 Banquet (9)[Translator \u2013 Koko is finally back and translating again!][Proofreader \u2013 and yuki is still collecting dust in a corner]Vishukel Yvliano was known as a 7-star knight, but in reality, he had already reached 8-star. In other words, he was an insurmountable opponent to the current Jin.\u2018A duel with a 7-star knight.\u2019This was a great opportunity for Jin.Whether he won or lost, the battle would greatly affect his reputation in a positive manner. As long as he appeared to have put up a good fight to the spectators, it would benefit him.Moreover, experiencing the Yvliano swordsmanship would be a perfect opportunity to study it. Even Cyron had recognized the previous Yvliano patriarch as a powerful man worthy of respect, so Jin always wanted to face an Yvliano swordsman.However\u2026\u2018Margiela Yvliano. What a laughable lady.\u2019Jin was fully aware that the woman was enjoying this situation. The moral duty she had brought up was all just a sham. Her goal was merely to watch an entertaining battle.That, or she enjoyed putting her brother in troublesome situations and watching him flail around. Whatever her real intention was, Jin didn\u2019t find it very pleasing.\u201cYou seem to care deeply about your sister, Lord Vishukel.\u201dJin reached out his hand towards the guardian knights on standby outside the stage as he spoke. One knight respectfully approached and placed a sword in the young master\u2019s hand.Whirrrrrrrrrrr!Jin\u2019s blade immediately began shining in aura, as if someone had cast a magic light.\u201c\u2026Yes, indeed, Young Master Jin.\u201d\u201cI also care deeply about my elder sister. So from now on, you should teach your servants not to open their mouths carelessly.\u201dHe referred to the 6-star martial artist Bouvard Gaston as a mere \u2018servant\u2019.The audience realized that the Runcandels and their pride had not changed over the years.\u201cThe man you pummelled to the ground is called Bouvard Gaston, and he is our attendant, not a servant. Did he commit some sort of blunder?\u201dVishukel pretended to be unaware and asked Jin to explain himself despite knowing what offense Bouvard had most likely committed. Meanwhile, Jin was taken aback when he heard the name \u2018Bouvard Gaston\u2019.It wasn\u2019t a common name. He had beaten up the man without even asking for his name due to his insolence, but to think he was\u00a0that\u00a0Bouvard Gaston.\u201cDid you just say that his name is Bouvard Gaston?\u201d\u201cIndeed. He merely attended this banquet to aid my sister, who is physically disabled. He is an artisan who doesn\u2019t fit well in the Runcandel banquet in the first place. Thus, whatever faux pas he may have committed, he meant no evil. I hope the young master will generously overlook his blunder this time around.\u201dAn artisan.There was no need to verify the fatass\u2019s identity any longer. The \u2018attendant\u2019 Vishukel had brought with him was none other than the Transformer Jin had been searching for.The people around the world were still unaware of the existence of the Transformer Bouvard Gaston. Even the Vermont Empire\u2019s Special Forces, who were investigating the transformation crimes, had yet to find any clues or traces potentially leading to the culprit.Thus, Vishukel had merely told Bouvard to wear a simple disguise when coming to the Runcandels\u2019, as no one would suspect them. Moreover, since \u2018Bouvard Gaston\u2019 had yet to spread around the world as the Transformer\u2019s name, he had no need to use a fake name when attending the banquet.Vishukel had thought that no one would show any interest in Bouvard in the first place, so he wondered whether a disguise was truly necessary.Of course, this didn\u2019t apply to Jin as he was a regressor. He knew about Bouvard Gaston from his past life.\u2018I should\u2019ve let him introduce himself earlier. Not only is his face different, but we\u2019re also located in the Runcandel Clan\u2019s main house\u2014the Garden of Swords. I could never have predicted my opponent to be Bouvard. Had I known his true identity earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have let him off with such a light beating.\u2019Not only was Bouvard implicated in Jin\u2019s assassination attempt when he had departed the Storm Castle, but the Transformer was also the main cause behind the chaos and confusion that would soon take over the world.Thus, it would\u2019ve been much better to kill him and use him as compost.If Jin were certain that Vishukel had no real connection with Bouvard Gaston, he would\u2019ve grabbed this opportunity and killed the unconscious, bloodied Bouvard straight away.However\u2026\u2018Bouvard Gaston and Vishukel Yvliano\u2026\u2019How were they related? Did Vishukel know that Bouvard was the Transformer?Jin\u2019s brain began overclocking, and his thought process accelerated. When Bouvard was captured by the Vermont Special Forces in his past life, there was not a single piece of news about the Yvliano Clan being involved with the transformation crimes.It was greatly emphasized that Bouvard was the one and only culprit behind those crimes. Back then, Jin read the articles in the newspapers without much thought. But if he assumed that Vishukel was aware of Bouvard\u2019s true identity, this situation was far more dangerous than he had initially thought.Anyhow, Jin did not have enough time to come up with all the answers. There were countless eyes watching them right now and Jin was still standing face to face with Vishukel.\u201c\u2026Very well. Since I also took advantage of the duel to beat him half to death, I shall overlook the blunder this time around.\u201d\u201cThank you very much. Then, shall we begin our duel as well? I am in your care, Young Master Jin.\u201d\u201cI thank you in advance for your guidance.\u201dA guardian knight handed Vishukel a sword, and the duel began.Jin promptly erased all the questions popping up in his head. He couldn\u2019t afford to show a change in his behaviour after hearing Bouvard\u2019s name, nor could he show his suspicion towards Vishukel and Bouvard\u2019s relationship.\u2018I\u2019ll need to start investigating the Yvliano Clan alongside the Zipfel Clan, especially everything related to Vishukel Yvliano.\u2019Clang!Jin realized the truth as soon as their blades clashed the first time.\u2018Unlike what\u2019s known publicly, he\u2019s not a 7-star knight.\u2019That was Jin\u2019s intuition. Needless to say, Vishukel hadn\u2019t used his full power in the exchange just now. However, his swordplay and the trajectory of his blade wasn\u2019t ordinary.Jin could even say that Vishukel\u2019s swordsmanship had as much depth as his uncle Zed\u2019s. He couldn\u2019t explain it properly, but Jin knew as soon as their swords clashed that Vishukel was hiding his true skills.Many of the spectators also realized this truth while observing the first exchange.\u201cThat fellow seems to have had an enlightenment recently. His movements have gotten more profound.\u201d\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s called the Yvliano Clan\u2019s hope.\u201dThe expressions of the spectators got serious.Although the duel was a complete mismatch, this was the perfect opportunity to observe and appreciate the swordsmanship of both the Yvliano Clan\u2019s pillar of support and the Runcandels\u2019 rising star.Shling! Slit!Vishukel\u2019s blade moved like a whip and cut Jin\u2019s shoulder. It wasn\u2019t deep, but blood erupted from the injury and splattered on the arena\u2019s floor.Jin tried to avoid the following attacks but got wounded at the thigh. Vishukel\u2019s blade flew in unpredictable trajectories, and the boy could not comprehend his opponent\u2019s swordplay with his current proficiency.\u201cAs I thought, Young Master Jin is getting overwhelmed by Lord Vishukel. I know best that the Yvliano swordsmanship is no joke. It\u2019s terribly difficult to counter.\u201d\u201cThe gap in their skills is too big. Well, it\u2019s not surprising since a 5-star is facing a 7-star. Hm, in fact, we should be amazed that the young master managed to fend off a few attacks\u2026\u201dThe Yvliano Clan\u2019s swordsmanship was cunning and irregular. Those who have experienced that devious style before always tried to avoid facing another Yvliano swordsman in their life.\u201cHm, you all seem to be unaware, but swordsmen from the Runcandel Clan often shine brighter in situations like this.\u201dIf the Yvliano Clan\u2019s swordsmanship was a cunning snake, then the Runcandels\u2019 was a charging rhinoceros. Even if its horn were to be broken, it would never stop its headbutt.The Runcandel swordsmanship was specialized in facing foes stronger than the user. The problem was that, since the Runcandels were often too strong and rarely faced opponents that surpassed them, they couldn\u2019t make full use of their fighting style efficiently.Although blood kept gushing out of his shoulder and thigh, Jin\u2019s blade still stood strong and fierce. In fact, his movements slowly changed from the defensive to the offensive. His senses got sharper and his blade\u2019s trajectory became bolder and daring.Vishukel\u2019s sword slashed Jin in the chest, but the boy took another step forward, as if he would put his life on the line to aim at the 7-star(?)\u2019s neck.\u201cImpressive, Young Master Jin!\u201dVishukel yelled as he dodged Jin\u2019s attack. Even though he was facing a young boy who was weaker than himself, the Runcandels\u2019 wild and bold swordplay was sending chills down his spine and making his hair stand on end.\u201cKeuk.\u201dThe attack Jin had attempted, in return for a 20-ish centimeter-long wound on his chest, went down the drain. The boy let out a low groan, as the long injury was inhibiting his battle prowess unlike the small gashes on his shoulder and thigh.Fortunately, his bones and organs hadn\u2019t been touched.\u2018This reminds me of that time I fought against the White Wolf warrior.\u2019He had no way of defeating Vishukel through ordinary means\u2014similar to his battle against the beastman. Even with the Runcandels\u2019 blessed body and their bold swordsmanship, Jin couldn\u2019t defeat his opponent.He had no choice but to lose.Nevertheless, Jin\u2019s heart began beating like crazy for the first time in a long while as a feeling of satisfaction swept through his body.\u2018It\u2019s clear that Vishukel is going easy on me. But it\u2019s also true that I\u2019m facing him quite remarkably.\u2019And that was more than enough for now.Not all 8-stars were on the same level, and that also went for 5-stars.If any other 5-star knight amongst the Runcandel cadets were to face Vishukel right now, they wouldn\u2019t be able to put up a good fight like Jin was doing\u2014no matter how much Vishukel went easy on them.Moreover, Jin was facing his opponent while having sealed two of his abilities: magic and spiritual power.\u2018My vision is starting to get blurrier and dimmer\u2026 But for some reason, I still feel like I can read and predict Vishukel\u2019s next move.\u2019Jin had lost too much blood.He slowly made up his mind to bring this duel to an end. As his vision got darker, Jin finally realized the goal of his training with Luna and began to understand the principle behind the Mind\u2019s Eye exercise.The boy\u2019s stance changed.Jin closed his eyes and held his sword upright with both hands in front of his chest. It almost looked like the stance knights would take during a wedding ceremony or something of the sort. The audience believed that Jin had given up and was waiting for his opponent to deal the final blow to end the duel.Vishukel was of the same opinion. Deep down, he wanted to praise the young boy for lasting this long. To show respect to Young Master Jin, he finally wrapped his sword in aura for the first time during the battle. His intention was to break Jin\u2019s blade and bring an end to the duel.He believed that it was an appropriate way to finish things while respecting the boy\u2019s spirit and tenacity.\u201cThis was an excellent duel, Young Master Jin.\u201dZooom!Vishukel went all out on this last attack and charged at Jin. His blade was covered in the powerful aura of an 8-star knight. It sliced the air and flew horizontally along with Vishukel\u2019s body.Craaang!Jin\u2019s sword\u2014which was standing vertically in his hands\u2014shattered almost simultaneously as Vishukel made his final move.The Yvliano Clan\u2019s secret technique smashed the sword and reached towards Jin\u2019s neck, but froze right before touching the boy\u2019s skin. Had Vishukel not stopped his weapon in time, it would\u2019ve definitely decapitated his target.Jin remained standing for around two seconds, before falling to the ground, unconscious.\u201cThe victor is Lord Vishukel!\u201dAs soon as the host announced the results of the duel, the medical team rushed onto the stage. The spectators watched the medics\u2019 reactions with nervous looks, until they received a signal indicating Jin\u2019s safety.Clap clap clap!The audience applauded in response to the spectacular duel they witnessed. In fact, the martial artists were highly impressed by Vishukel\u2019s final technique.However, Vishukel and other prominent martial artists noticed something during the two contenders\u2019 final exchange. Before Jin fell unconscious, something extremely extraordinary had occurred.\u2018What was that\u2026 at the end? Are you seriously telling me that during our spar, he reached the Mind\u2019s Blade Realm for a split second?\u2019Vishukel had undoubtedly destroyed Jin\u2019s sword. However, the instant the blade shattered, Vishukel felt the sensation of something sharp flying upwards and piercing his chin.That would\u2019ve been the conclusion of the duel had Vishukel\u2019s final attack landed 0.1 seconds slower. The 8-star\u2019s instincts were telling him as such.If Jin had reacted 0.1 seconds faster, Vishukel would\u2019ve been carried off the stage fatally injured. The sword standing vertically before Jin\u2019s face would\u2019ve stabbed him from below the chin.Moreover, since Jin was already half-unconscious during their final exchange, the boy wouldn\u2019t have been able to stop his attack in time to spare Vishukel\u2019s life.Needless to say, being able to shorten that gap of 0.1 seconds is what makes one a true master and expert.\u2018Jin Runcandel. What a terrifying boy.\u2019In fact, he could become a great threat to Kinzelo in the future when they start properly executing their grand masterplan.\u2018It\u2019s truly a relief that he was born so late. He\u2019s too young to defeat his siblings and become the next patriarch.\u2019Vishukel sheathed his sword with a trembling hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 \u2013 The Outside World (1)[Translator \u2013 Koko loved the banquet arc! Now time to read ahead again. This is as far as I read the raws as well][Proofreader \u2013 yuki\u2019s just gonna sit here and patiently wait for chapters]Jin was having a dream.A jet-black tentacle monster was stuck to his face and wouldn\u2019t let go no matter what.Mmmh! Mmmhmmm!He couldn\u2019t breathe. He could only let out small groans as he suffocated.As he frantically opened his eyes, Jin finally realized the source of his nightmare.Meow~Meow, meow~ Meoowww!A small black cat was asleep on Jin\u2019s face. Indeed, it was Murakan. He had been lying on Jin\u2019s face for over thirty minutes.\u201cGet off me, geez.\u201dJin slowly got up and stretched his arms. Sunrays beamed in through the window and brightened his room. He could smell the fragrant aroma of tea near him; it was the scent of the black tea Gilly often brewed for him.\u2018I had a nightmare because of Murakan\u2026 But now that I\u2019m awake, I feel fully refreshed. Did I fall unconscious right after the duel with Vishukel?\u2019His entire body felt light like a feather. The wound on his chest and the grazes throughout his entire body had completely vanished. The Runcandel medic had probably healed Jin while he was unconscious.\u201cYou\u2019ve awakened, Young Master.\u201dGilly sensed his awakening and approached the bedside with a cup of tea and some cold water.\u201cHow long was I out for, Gilly?\u201d\u201cFor two days.\u201d\u201cWhat? Two days?\u201dJin was surprised but quickly nodded in acknowledgement. Not only had he bled too much, but during the final exchange, he had reached a new realm for a short instant, which used up all his mental and physical energy. Considering those circumstances, he had woken up pretty early.\u201cThe banquet must have ended already. It seems I was unable to send everyone off and bid them farewell.\u201d\u201cThere is no need to worry so much. During the past two days, your duel against Lord Vishukel was the hot topic of the banquet that everyone gossipped about. I think everyone was understanding of your situation. Moreover, you\u2019ve shown them more than enough courtesy while you were attending.\u201dGilly was right. Although there was a complete mismatch between an 8-star and a 5-star, the duel was all that the guests were talking about until the end of the banquet.It was because of the \u2018Mind\u2019s Blade\u2019 Jin had displayed at the very end. Although it couldn\u2019t be called a perfect Mind\u2019s Blade, the fact that a turnabout almost happened during Jin\u2019s fight against an 8-star knight was more than extraordinary.Vishukel wasn\u2019t the only one to have noticed Jin\u2019s feat. In fact, many others had realized it. However, the 8-star knight in question appeared to have been so shocked that he never returned to the arena afterwards until the end of the banquet.\u2018The daily training I\u2019ve done with Elder Sister Luna is finally paying off. I couldn\u2019t understand anything in the beginning\u2026 To think that it would come in handy like this.\u2019Jin recalled Luna continuously saying \u2018use the eye of the mind to observe\u2019 like some religious chant and chuckled to himself.He first realized what kind of sensation the Mind\u2019s Blade produced during his training with the Clear Stones. Afterwards, he tried to recreate that feeling again, but to no avail, which frustrated Jin.\u2018Seems like for now, that sensation will only manifest itself during dangerous situations or in subconscious moments.\u2019It was a pity, but Jin couldn\u2019t do anything about it. It was already impressive that he had somehow managed to imitate the Mind\u2019s Blade, albeit sloppily. Generally speaking, the Mind\u2019s Blade was a realm only attainable by true masters starting from the 8-star stage.Jin stretched again and got off the bed.\u2018In any case, that was a very fruitful banquet. I gained so much. I figured out Beradin\u2019s standing within the Zipfel Clan, started a good\u2026 friendship? Bond? Something like that with the Hidden Palace\u2019s successor. At the very least, she behaved somewhat amicably after our duel.\u2019Moreover, Jin got the chance to beat up Bouvard Gaston half-dead and also learned that Bouvard has a close relationship with Vishukel. This was the greatest outcome of the banquet.\u2018It\u2019s highly likely that the Yvliano Clan or Vishukel alone are backing the transformation crimes. It\u2019s also possible that Vishukel is part of some organization outside of his clan, and Bouvard Gaston is affiliated with them.\u2019Jin thought of many possibilities, but he couldn\u2019t make a hasty judgement. He had to investigate them and unravel the truth himself.Moreover, he planned on making them take responsibility. Responsibility for the assassination attempt on him five years ago performed by the radical Zipfel followers. Jin was going to interrogate them and make them admit their involvement with the assassins\u2019 disguises.After Jin\u2019s thoughts came to an end, Gilly pointed at a certain vase on the bedside. There were pure-white flowers resembling Baby\u2019s Breaths but with a soft, snowflake-like shape glowing faintly.[TL/N: Check out Baby\u2019s Breath on Google if you don\u2019t know what type of flowers they are.]\u201cThe Hidden Palace\u2019s successor left these flowers for you. She waited for you to wake up until this morning but left afterwards as she had to return.\u201d\u201cHm? Lady Syris left these behind?\u201d\u201cYes. Maybe you hold a special place in her heart~?\u201d\u201cNo. The Hidden Palace\u2019s\u00a0snow blossoms\u00a0mean \u2018unfinished battle\u2019 in the language of flowers. Seems like she wants to fight me again in another duel. She\u2019s quite the persistent and tenacious woman.\u201dGilly simply shrugged at Jin\u2019s response.\u201cWhatever it signifies, this is still your first time receiving flowers from a lady. Congratulations, Young Master.\u201d\u201cKuahaha! Your first flowers are a letter of challenge. That\u2019s hilarious! This is monumental, don\u2019t you think so, Strawberry Pie?\u201dMurakan laughed out loud excessively and glanced at Gilly.He was being cautious around her due to the incident where he sneaked into the banquet hall without her authorization. Indeed, Gilly was acting like Murakan didn\u2019t exist for the second day straight.Having grasped the situation at hand, Jin just lightly shook his head. A despondent Murakan transformed back into a cat, his ears drooped.\u201cSpeaking of which, the patriarch has ordered you to go find him as soon as you wake up, Young Master. Just as you mentioned before\u2026 I think the time for you to prove your qualifications has arrived.\u201dThe trial to prove his qualifications to become a flag-bearer. Although he had been expecting this, Jin felt somewhat conflicted now that his father\u2019s directive had arrived.Jin couldn\u2019t even have dreamt of this day in his past life, but now it was right before him, within his grasp.\u201cI see. It seems we\u2019ll be leaving the clan for a while. Where is Father?\u201d\u201cAt the mausoleum.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019m off.\u201dWhen Jin\u2019s siblings received the same summons from their father, they all wore neat ceremonial clothes and brushed their hair before going to see him.However, Jin lazily tidied his disheveled hair and wore some good-quality leather travel clothes. He also wore Bradamante at his waist before entering the corridor.The mausoleum.The Garden of Swords\u2019 courtyard\u2014where countless swords were impaled\u2014was no different to the clan\u2019s graveyard. However, the clansmen who achieved extraordinary accomplishments even amidst the best of the best knights were allowed to be buried in the mausoleum as heroes of the clan.Inside the mausoleum, at the lowest floor underground, there was not a single spot of light. The darkness smelled of metal, and a low voice resounded.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201dJin could barely see Cyron\u2019s silhouette from behind. He respectfully lowered his head.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since a child of mine answered my summons in such comfortable clothes. I assume you\u2019ve realized that you\u2019ll be spending time outside of the clan for a while, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I plan on departing immediately.\u201dCyron quite liked this aspect of his youngest son. The boy didn\u2019t feel intimidated by him and simply announced his intentions clearly.His other children couldn\u2019t even have imagined behaving as such before their father. They already had a hard time trying to conceal their fear and anxiety just by being in his presence\u2026 Actually, it wasn\u2019t the case for all his other children. Luna was also different. She had quickly left Cyron\u2019s grasp and lived her own life.Jin was aware of his father\u2019s personality, which was why he purposefully came in laid-back clothes.\u2018Ever since my regression, I find my father to be the easiest person to read.\u2019It was an inexplicable thought. In his past life, not only was Jin terrified of Cyron, but he also had barely interacted with his father during his 28 years of life.The father and son duo didn\u2019t speak for a while. Nevertheless, it wasn\u2019t an awkward silence.\u201cIs this your first time inside the mausoleum?\u201dCyron was the first to break the silence.\u201cYes, Father.\u201d\u201cIf the garden is a burial ground permitted only to those who bring honour to the clan, then the mausoleum is only permitted to those who protect the clan.\u201dThat was it. As simple as that.The Runcandel Clan had faced countless dangers during its thousand-year-long history. The dangers varied from all kinds of small, personal disputes to big threats that brought the clan to the brink of destruction. Indeed, all kinds of conflicts and battles had threatened the clan throughout time.And every time such major incidents happened, the people who protected the clan till their very last breaths received the honour of getting buried in the clan\u2019s mausoleum.\u201cDid you know? The clan\u2019s first patriarch, Temar Runcandel, is not buried here.\u201dAs soon as Temar\u2019s name exited Cyron\u2019s mouth, Jin had a hunch that his father would bring up the topic of Solderet.He was confident in his intuition.\u201cYes. I am also aware that there is not a single grave or tombstone throughout the garden dedicated to the first patriarch.\u201dThe only legacy that was left behind was Temar\u2019s beloved sword \u2018Barisada\u2019, which was now hailed as the family heirloom. Other than the weapon, there was not a single memorial or ceremony that honoured him.\u201cThe dark power you possess. That power is the reason why we are unable to honour the first patriarch. Show me your spiritual energy.\u201dJin calmly extended his hand and created a ball of spiritual energy on his palm.After the first patriarch\u2019s death, the Runcandels made a humiliating pact with the Zipfels.A pact that banned the swordsmen from using magic ever again.Moreover, they were prohibited from worshipping ancestors who used magic.That was the true reason behind the downgrade of the Runcandel Clan\u2014the unique \u2018Clan of Magic Swordsmen\u2019\u2014to a mere clan of knights.It was an inescapable fate as Solderet wasn\u2019t there to protect the Runcandels from the Zipfels\u2019 gods anymore.As a result of the pact, the Zipfels\u2019 gods united their powers and cast a curse on the Runcandel bloodline.Thus, every Runcandel after Temar was born with a body that couldn\u2019t control mana.\u201cWhen you beat the Tona twins with spiritual power back at the Storm Castle, I didn\u2019t ask you the details of how you obtained that power. Do you remember?\u201d\u201cYes. I also remember that I lied about how I\u2019d use the spiritual power to protect the clan.\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s right. You were lucky you were still young. If you told such a lie before me now, I wouldn\u2019t have let it slide so easily.\u201dAlthough Cyron was laughing, Jin knew that his father was being serious. Thus, he didn\u2019t laugh along.\u201c\u2026Solderet. Did you hear his voice?\u201d\u201cYes, I heard him. He called me his contractor.\u201dNeedless to say, Jin had yet to hear Solderet\u2019s voice ever since his regression. But there was no need to hide his identity as the contractor from Cyron anymore.\u201cHow unfair this is for your siblings.\u201dNot only was Jin born with more potential than Luna, but he had also contracted the god who had left the clan long ago. In fact, maybe Jin was able to contract Solderet thanks to his extraordinary potential.\u201cWill you be able to defeat your siblings and conquer the clan using that power?\u201dJin had already come up with an answer to that question.\u201cIf I explore the world and do not find anything else worth conquering more than the clan, then I shall do so.\u201dJin had also predicted that this answer would greatly satisfy his father. It goes without saying that Cyron smiled widely, showing his beautiful and uniform teeth.\u201cThe others departed the Garden of Swords in order to get recognized by the clan\u2026 but you will depart the Garden in order to find a reason to recognize the clan itself, is that it? I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s praiseworthy or pure insolence. Kuhahaha.\u201dCyron hunched forward towards Jin, who still had his right arm extended forward with a ball of spiritual energy.\u201cI shall give you five years. During that time, whether you get recognized by the clan or recognize it, find an answer for yourself and return. I shall await with impatience.\u201dThere was no need to drag out the conversation.Shling!Jin unsheathed Bradamante and raised his sword.\u201cThank you for everything until now. I shall see you again in five years, Father.\u201dJin exited the mausoleum and returned to his room. Gilly had already finished the preparations for their departure and was waiting for him.The only luggage they had was a small basket in which lay Murakan along with some dry food and Jin\u2019s notebook with the transcription of the secret tomes.Gilly had metal nails impaling her wrists and ankles. As Jin\u2019s gaze reached these anomalies, Gilly adjusted her clothes and hid the oddities.The nails were medical tools used to seal Gilly\u2019s aura. She would be unable to use the energy until Jin\u2019s qualifications as a flag-bearer were proven.\u201cI had heard about this from my seniors and the other nannies, but it feels quite weird to suddenly lose my powers. Haha\u2026\u201dGilly laughed awkwardly, to which Jin felt a suffocating throb in his chest.It was the clan\u2019s tradition. The Runcandels sealed the nannies\u2019 powers so that the provisional flag-bearers couldn\u2019t receive their help in gaining reputation and honour.If they ever removed the seal without the clan\u2019s authorization, the nanny would be crippled mercilessly.\u201cI\u2019ll protect you from now on, Nanny. Not just for the next five years, but for the rest of my life. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say such things. I am just content and touched that you\u2019ve become a provisional flag-bearer already, Young Master. And I\u2019ll regain my powers once the trial is over, so please don\u2019t worry.\u201dAnd so, they left the room and departed the Garden of Swords.***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Koko loved the banquet arc!

    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56 \u2013 The Outside World (2)[Translator \u2013 Koko is trying my best to translate as often as possible\u2026][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is willing to wait for koko, no matter how long it takes]The first thing that provisional flag-bearers had to do in order to gain honour and reputation when departing the Garden of Swords was to leave the Huphester Alliance.Jin and Gilly erased all traces of their affiliation with the Runcandels. The robes covering their clothes didn\u2019t have the Black Sword emblem on it, and the bag containing their belongings had no label either.Details of Jin\u2019s face had yet to spread to the public, so there was no need for him to wear a disguise. Nevertheless, he still tweaked his appearance a little bit.He cut the black hair that came down to his shoulders. However, his appearance didn\u2019t matter much. In fact, the martial artist known as \u2018Gilly McRolan\u2019 was far more famous than Jin to the public. Fortunately, her active years were short, so she wasn\u2019t extremely well-known either.The names written on their identification were aliases; Jin Grey and Gilly Piten.Although they had fake names on their papers, those were still elaborate passports that even allowed them to leave and enter Vermont\u2019s capital city as they pleased.Be that as it may, anyone in the Huphester Alliance would be able to guess that they were provisional flag-bearers of the Runcandel Clan. Huphester was no different from the Runcandels\u2019 main headquarters, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that the people would see through their lies.Therefore, Jin and his companions had to go to a land where the Runcandels\u2019 influence didn\u2019t reach\u2014somewhere beyond the sea.\u201cLady Luna will be quite saddened by your departure. The same goes for the cadets in your faction, Young Master. Will you really leave without telling them goodbye?\u201d\u201cYeah. Elder Sister Luna is also quite free-spirited herself, and the cadets are probably going to overreact. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to die or something.\u201dHowever, as they were about to pass through the Garden of Swords\u2019 main gate, Jin came face to face with nine cadets.\u201cGeez, hasn\u2019t training started already? Uncle Zed won\u2019t forgive you so easily for skipping.\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cPlease stay safe during your travels!\u201d\u201d\u201dThe cadets raised their swords in unison. Jin silently stared at them for a moment, but before long, a small smile drew on his face.\u201cI expect everyone to be far stronger than my expectations by the time I\u2019m back. I don\u2019t want any deaths or dropouts while I\u2019m away. Good luck enduring the disciplinary punishment for skipping class to come see me.\u201dJin fist-bumped everyone before continuing his way to leave the Garden.\u2018How curious. It\u2019s a completely different feeling compared to back then.\u2019In his past life, Jin was banished from the clan at the age of 25. He had to leave the Garden of Swords in a similar fashion as today. However, the atmosphere of leaving as a 15-year-old provisional flag-bearer was poles apart from the atmosphere back then.Fifteen years.It had taken Jin fifteen long years to finally get five years of freedom. Those fifteen years felt like an eternity to the boy, since he had a fully conscious mind since his rebirth.Jin felt so giddy that he couldn\u2019t stop himself from humming a cute little melody.Generally speaking, Cyron never gave a five-year timespan to a provisional flag-bearer; it usually spanned between six months to two years maximum. Within that time, the provisional flag-bearers have to gain honour and reputation before returning to the clan.\u2018There\u2019s only one reason Father gave me five long years. It\u2019s for me to reach the pinnacle of spiritual power before coming back.\u2019Needless to say, Jin wasn\u2019t a goody two shoes who listened to his father\u2019s every word. He didn\u2019t plan on reaching the pinnacle of spiritual power only, but also that of magic***Cyron\u2014who had remained in the mausoleum\u2014quietly thought to himself.\u2018I wonder\u2026 Will the youngest gain the power to liberate the Runcandels from the Zipfels? I can\u2019t wait to see.\u2019Even though Cyron had reached the demigod realm by wielding a single sword, he still couldn\u2019t destroy the pact his ancestors had made with the Zipfels.The Runcandel Clan\u2019s only hope was Solderet\u2019s contractor, his youngest son. Of course, this hope was merely a candle in the wind at the moment.***One day went by. Two people were walking down a path in the forest.Most Runcandel provisional flag-bearers head to the Mamit Lawless Zone first in order to gain honour. Mamit was an area where countless criminals and outlaws crawled around like cockroaches, which made it the perfect place for provisional flag-bearers to beat up villains and gain a decent reputation.Jin had also considered choosing Mamit as his first destination.But his reasoning was different from the others. He didn\u2019t want to go to Mamit to beat up criminals, but to find someone who went by the name \u2018Hister\u2019. Hister was Jin\u2019s magic teacher in his past life, and he couldn\u2019t wait to see them again.However, Jin couldn\u2019t allow himself to waste time just because he missed his master.\u2018It\u2019s not like Master will recognize me in this life anyway.\u2019Jin could always go find his Master whenever he wanted in the future.Thus, Jin renounced Mamit as his first destination and decided to head to the \u2018Akin Kingdom\u2019.\u2018The land where I died in my past life.\u2019Jin had died in his sleep when three 9-star knights attacked the city he was in. Fortunately, that death ended up being a blessing in disguise, as Jin gained a second chance at life.\u201cWhy the Akin Kingdom specifically, Young Master?\u201d\u201cHave you been to Akin before, Gilly?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cWhen I was out on my mission at the Kollon Ruins, I overheard a conversation between some magicians there. Apparently, many unregistered magicians have been messing around in the Akin Kingdom recently.\u201d\u201cUnregistered magicians?\u201dJust as the name implied, unregistered magicians are magicians who didn\u2019t register their names at the Magic Association. Most of them are either criminals or evil mercenaries.\u201cRight. It seems they\u2019ve been collaborating with martial artist mercenaries and terrorizing the Akin citizens. I plan on heading there and beating them to a pulp.\u201dIt goes without saying that Jin hadn\u2019t overheard any of this at the Kollon Ruins; it was merely the information he knew from his past life. Anyone who has been in the Akin Kingdom knows that unregistered magicians and mercenaries have been wreaking havoc.The small number of unregistered magicians and mercenaries in Akin were all pawns and henchmen of the\u00a0evil \u2018Tesing\u2019 Clan of the Akin underworld.Jin\u2019s true business lay with that clan. The underground auction house the Tesings hosted contained countless items\u2014items whose true values were yet to be known around the world.\u2018I absolutely need to buy a few magic tomes and a certain ring.\u2019Although most books are written in archaic language or in a secret code, the ancient magic tomes contain some interesting spells. Many of them can\u2019t compare to modern magic spells that have been improved over decades and centuries, but some rare ones are still exceptional spells that transcend time and era.Thanks to his excellent master, Jin also knows how to distinguish the good magic tomes from the bad ones.Moreover, in five to six years, a certain item\u2019s true value will spread around the world, and the artifact in question would receive a proper name. It was a helmet artifact in the shape of a ring, and it was an item that every martial artist in his past life dreamed of having.\u201cA great idea, Young Master. I very much adored beating up villains back when I was still active as well. I\u2019m feeling excited already!\u201dGilly spoke as she did a fist pump.Although her skills as a 7-star knight had been sealed, Gilly\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but beat in excitement at the thought of travelling the world with Jin and Murakan.However, there was one big problem\u2026\u201cYoung Master, I don\u2019t think we can use the transfer gate to go to the Akin Kingdom. We will have to buy the cheapest ticket and go by ship\u2026\u201dThe trio were broke.Back at the Garden of Swords, none of them had to worry about money, but currently, they only had ten gold coins in their pockets.With these funds, they couldn\u2019t pay for the transfer gate, let alone buy a single high-class ship ticket. Jin\u2019s life as the rich son of a wealthy family that could use 3000 to 5000 coins per day without hesitation had come to an end.Poof!The black cat inside Gilly\u2019s basket transformed back into a human.\u201cStrawberry Pie! I knew this would happen, so I secretly brought a few of my limited edition magazines with me. Fufu, we could easily buy a high-class ship ticket by selling one of these.\u201d\u201cWhen did you even pack those up, Lord Murakan? Hm\u2026 Won\u2019t it be a bit embarrassing when we sell them?\u201d\u201cPut those away, Murakan. We\u2019re not cold-hearted people that\u2019d make you sell your treasured collection.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, I do believe that I\u2019d be able to earn a few hundred coins by enduring the shame and selling them to a peddler in a city.\u201d\u201cHundred?! I bought this one for 2000 coins. You can\u2019t sell this at that price.\u201dGilly and Murakan squabbled with each other for a short while about the erotic magazines\u2019 prices, and Jin found them adorable. Soon enough, he shook his head and spoke up.\u201cEnough, both of you. I have an idea for our funds. Before heading to Akin, let\u2019s stop by the Zhan Kingdom tonight. There\u2019s someone I can make good use of over there.\u201d\u201cThe Zhan Kingdom? But how will we get there without money in the first place?\u201d\u201cWe can just ride Murakan. What are you doing? Transform into your original form already.\u201dAlthough a day had passed since they had left the Garden of Swords, it was still broad daylight. It wasn\u2019t the appropriate time for the legendary Black Dragon to suddenly appear in the skies.\u201cOh, can I really do that, kid?\u201d\u201cN-Nonsense! We cannot do that, Young Master! What if someone sees us? We haven\u2019t exited the Runcandel territory yet.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, it\u2019s fine. We should enjoy ourselves for once. A single time wouldn\u2019t hurt. Transform already, Murakan. We\u2019ve got a long journey ahead of us.\u201dGilly didn\u2019t even have the opportunity to stop them again.Swooooosh!Murakan had already returned to his black dragon form and grabbed the two humans with his hand. He then placed them on his back.[Hold on tight. I\u2019ll have to fly restlessly to reach the Zhan Kingdom by nightfall.]The three of them soon darted across the Huphester skyline and headed to the Zhan Kingdom.In the near future, a small rumour spread within central Huphester, where people said they \u2018saw a dragon\u2019. Nevertheless, no one ever learned of the truth of that incident.No one, except Jin\u2019s eldest sister.\u201cHe really is quite extraordinary. He\u2019s flying through the sky on a dragon as soon as he becomes a provisional flag-bearer?\u201dLuna was sitting on her balcony drinking alcohol while thinking of her youngest sibling who had just departed. Needless to say, she had seen Murakan flying across the sky as well as the two people riding on his back.\u201cA toast to my ungrateful and insensitive brother who didn\u2019t come say bye. Hmph.\u201d***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 Koko is trying my best to translate as often as possible\u2026][Proofreader \u2013 yuki is willing to wait for koko, no matter how long it takes]Join our discord to get the latest news and updates about the translations!https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb***\u201cUrgh\u2026 Uub.\u201dUnfortunately, Gilly had a terrible case of acrophobia. As soon as they landed on a hill in the vicinity of the Zhan Kingdom\u2019s capital, Gilly got off Murakan and trembled in fear for a long while.\u201cA-Are you alright, Strawberry Pie? Hey! Kid! Strawberry Pie is completely terrified right now because of you!\u201d\u201cWhy is it my fault? It\u2019s because you were flying weirdly.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one who wanted to ride me! Ah, breathe deeply, Strawberry Pie\u2026 That\u2019s right, take it slow. Breathe deeply. Good.\u201dJin and Murakan consoled Strawberry P\u2014I mean, Gilly for a while as they patted her on the back. She was still trembling all over with a face pale as a ghost.Murakan made use of this opportunity and embraced Gilly in a big hug. Whether she was aware of his intentions or not, Gilly didn\u2019t resist. Murakan then talked big while staring at Jin.\u201cThis won\u2019t do. I\u2019ll look after Strawberry Pie, so you go get the money, kid.\u201d\u2018You crazy\u2026 Are you being serious?\u2019Jin was about to blurt that out, but managed to hold back. He then decided to follow Murakan\u2019s suggestion.The boy ran down the hill and the streets for two hours before reaching his destination.The Bill Clan\u2019s residence.It was a gigantic mansion visible from anywhere in the Zhan Kingdom\u2019s capital city. No wonder they were Zhan\u2019s greatest clan of merchants.Jin approached the front gate and the guards stopped him.\u201cWhat\u2019s with you? Get lost, brat.\u201dAaah\u2026As soon as he heard the old-fashioned, clich\u00e9 line, Jin felt a nostalgic sensation as memories flooded his mind. He had heard similar lines so many times in his past life, where he roamed\u2026 no, crawled the lands as a beggar.The long flight on Murakan had disheveled his hair, and the travelling clothes he was wearing didn\u2019t have the clan\u2019s Black Sword emblem on them. In the guards\u2019 point of view, Jin was merely an annoying brat who was approaching the mansion in the middle of the night.\u201cCember Bill. Is he inside?\u201dJin bluntly mentioned the Bill Clan\u2019s eldest son\u2019s name, and the guards looked at each other, baffled. The boy\u2019s behaviour was like that of the son from a prominent family.\u201cYes, he is residing inside the mansion. If I may ask, who might you be, young sir?\u201dJin pondered on what to answer.What about \u2018I am Jin Runcandel\u2019? Or \u2018an old friend\u2019? Maybe \u2018I dropped by since I was nearby. Tell Cember to come on out\u2019?None of them were appropriate answers. Revealing his name would mean breaking the rule of not using the clan\u2019s name as a provisional flag-bearer. Meanwhile, the other options would take too long. The guards would make Jin go through all the procedures and paperwork before allowing him to meet Cember.\u201cThanks. And sorry about this.\u201dThwack!Jin swiftly chopped the two guards in the back of the neck with his hands and they fell unconscious. Jin took out his entire fortune\u2014ten coins\u2014and placed them on their stomachs as compensation. Jin then opened the front gate and entered the Bill Clan\u2019s residence.Fortunately, Cember was sitting at the center of the lake in the residence, acting pitiful. Thus, Jin didn\u2019t need to deal with other guards and wreak havoc.\u201cCember.\u201d\u201cWho ar\u2014mmh, mhmm!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t shout. It\u2019s me, Jin. The one who rescued you from Kinzelo.\u201d\u201cBwaaah! My, Lord Jin? What brings you here?\u201d\u201cDo you remember how you told me to come find you if I\u2019m ever in need of help?\u201d\u201cOf course I do. How could I ever forget my debt to Lord Jin? If it weren\u2019t for you, right now I wouldn\u2019t be\u2014\u201d\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll be waiting here, so go get me some gold and money.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

To think that such an incredible person would come find someone like me in the middle of the night to ask for help!\u2019Cember was incredibly touched. Jin was his saviour who even brought along Runcandel guardian knights on a mission to rescue him. No matter how much money one had, one couldn\u2019t easily experience such a luxury when being rescued.What was the reason behind Jin\u2019s request? The Runcandel Clan\u2019s youngest child should be overflowing with money normally. Was he on a secret mission during which he urgently needed some funds?\u2018Whatever the answer is, I\u2019ll have helped him out in making a great achievement in the near future, even if my influence is minimal. After our deaths, historians will write records of Jin Runcandel, and I\u2019ll be happy if there\u2019s even a single line in his biography mentioning \u201cCember Bill\u201d.\u2019During the short ten minutes Cember took to collect the money, his imagination ran wild.Cember returned with a large leather bag with all kinds of valuables and plenty of gold coins.\u201cHuff, huff\u2026 Here\u2019s what you asked for, Lord Jin!\u201dHe had brought too much. Even at first glance, the bag appeared to weigh more than 30kg of treasure. Jin wouldn\u2019t be able to take all that and continue his journey.Jin grabbed a handful of golden valuables and took about 500 gold coins. Even robbers didn\u2019t dream of gaining this much money in one day.\u201cThis is more than enough. It was good seeing you again, Cember Bill.\u201d\u201cIt was an honour, Lord Jin. I do not know what mission you are undertaking, but I wish you the best and pray you return in good health\u2026!\u201d\u201cThanks, I\u2019ll see you another time. Oh, and when I came here, I had to do something about the guards at the gate, so\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand. I shall deal with that myself, so please do not concern yourself. And I shall keep my mouth closed about today\u2019s matters until Lord Jin gives me permission to talk about it.\u201dJin wasn\u2019t expecting much of Cember Bill when he first coincidentally rescued him back in the Zhan Kingdom\u2019s southern region by the border. However, he now saw Cember as quite the decent person. Not only did he remember his debts, but he was also sharp and quick-witted.\u2018I should get him some gifts in the future, whatever they may be.\u2019Cember excitedly waved his hands until Jin\u2019s silhouette disappeared into the night.***Most Runcandel provisional flag-bearers spend their first two months in poverty.They had only ever learnt striking, stabbing, and slashing enemies since their birth inside this clan of swordsmen. Thus, their senses and intuition in money and finances were non-existent. They had never earned money themselves, so it wasn\u2019t surprising that they\u2019d spend a couple months in poverty once out in the real world.Therefore, most provisional flag-bearers either killed the crime lords in Mamit and brought their heads to the Vermont criminal investigation team, or they lived as mercenaries to earn money. But until then, they\u2019d still be penniless.Munch, munch. Gulp.Today was Jin\u2019s third day as a provisional flag-bearer. The boy, his nanny, and his (pet?) dragon were devouring all the food at the Zhan Kingdom\u2019s best and most popular restaurant. Although they had ordered dozens of dishes, the bill had barely scratched their funds.\u201cDon\u2019t eat too much, Murakan. The transfer gate is in an hour. If you throw up everything like last time\u2026\u201d\u201cQuiet, kid. Even if I end up vomiting later, I\u2019ll still eat everything. That\u2019s what it means to live like an apex predator like me.\u201cHow stubborn.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, please try some of this too. Zhan cooking is quite delicious.\u201d\u201cKuhaha. Didn\u2019t you ask Jin \u2018isn\u2019t that extorting money from him, Young Master?\u2019 just yesterday, Strawberry Pie? You seem pretty comfortable eating now.\u201dThe three of them were planning on using the transfer gate rather than riding Murakan to travel. The reason behind this decision wasn\u2019t Gilly\u2019s fear of heights but because of their destination.Although the underground organization Tesing was making a mess out of the country, the Akin kingdom was undeniably part of the \u2018Lutero Magic Federation\u2019. And the Lutero Magic Federation was under the management of the Zipfels.Moreover, 80% of the active dragons today were affiliated with the Zipfels. Therefore, recklessly riding on Murakan and flying into the kingdom was no different from a declaration of war to them.\u2018The reason why the Runcandels can\u2019t break their pact with the Zipfels is also because of those dragons.\u2019Technically, it was because of the gods who had created those dragons.The Runcandels only had a single member who had contracted a god: Jin. However, the situation was different at the Zipfels. Dozens of contractors were supporting the clan.And they were all patiently waiting for Cyron\u2019s death.As long as Cyron disappeared, the Zipfels could easily obliterate the Runcandels who were a thorn in their flesh.\u201cIt\u2019s about time now. Let\u2019s go.\u201d3 PM.The trio finished their meal and headed to the Zhan Kingdom\u2019s transfer gate and finished the legal procedures. Murakan had no identification, so he transformed into a cat in order to travel with Jin and Gilly.\u201cThe teleportation will soon begin.\u201dWhiiir!Once they took their seats in a quiet waiting room, a staff member announced as such.Bright blue mana softly enveloped the three of them, and after a short while, they opened their eyes in the Akin Kingdom.\u201cWelcome to the Akin Kingdom in the Lutero Magic Federation.\u201dTheir fake papers allowed them to enter the kingdom with no problems. As they exited the building and entered the streets, the strong sunlight shone on them.\u2018It\u2019s been fifteen years.\u2019Jin had spent one year in the Akin Kingdom\u2019s capital city right before his regression.Although there was a fifteen-year gap between the current city and the one from Jin\u2019s memories, the view hadn\u2019t particularly changed. The street vendors who were doing business on the streets, the homeless people crouching on the ground next to them, people from the dark alleyways of the city, etc.The shadows on people\u2019s faces drew a stark contrast to the clean roads and the bright sunlight. Indeed, the city was warm all year round.\u2018It must be because of the Tesing Clan\u2019s tyranny. I remember hearing that their reign of terror was worse now compared to in the future.\u2019Gilly also noticed the disparity and stayed wary of their surroundings.\u201cThe city is oddly sombre, even though the weather\u2019s so pleasant.\u201d\u201cAccording to the magicians at the Kollon Ruins, the climate here is good, but life here isn\u2019t enjoyable. Let\u2019s find an inn first before we search for our prey.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dIn truth, Jin had already chosen their inn as well as their first target.Jet, the information broker.Jin was quite close with Jet in his past life. Not long after he arrived in the Akin Kingdom, he received Jet\u2019s help when settling down.However, they weren\u2019t close in the good sense of the term. Jet was someone who often backstabbed people for his own benefit.\u2018That punk. These days, he must be scamming morons as a self-proclaimed top-class information broker. Fuck, just thinking of him makes my blood boil.\u2019In fact, Jin himself was one of those \u2018morons\u2019 who got scammed by Jet in his past life. The information broker had tricked him so much under the guise of introducing him to the\u00a0Tesing underground auction house.This time, Jin planned on revealing Jet\u2019s schemes from the beginning to teach him a lesson.\u2018I\u2019ll beat Jet up. Then, I\u2019ll control him and make good use of his skills. It\u2019s much easier to explain things to Gilly and Murakan if I associate myself with Jet.\u2019Jin didn\u2019t plan on revealing himself as a regressor to Gilly and Murakan in the future.Thus, Jin needed good excuses in order to convince them whenever he made plans using his knowledge from his past life.Just like right now.\u201cKid, do we really need to look for an inn in this rundown alleyway? Aren\u2019t there good enough inns by the main street?\u201d\u201cThe Young Master must have a good reason for his actions, Lord Murakan.\u201d\u201cBut there is no need to reside in a place like this when we have as much money as we do, Strawberry Pie.\u201d\u201cIndeed, it would be a great idea to spread the news that we have a lot of money in this city, where countless unregistered magicians are wreaking havoc. Am I right, Murakan?\u201d\u201cHa! Are you seriously telling me that I, the Great Murakan, must sleep in this dirty inn\u2014that even orcs would avoid\u2014just because of those petty criminals?\u201dJin made up some excuse and guided the two others towards Jet\u2019s inn.But he couldn\u2019t behave like this forever. On the other hand, if he made Jet his subordinate, these problems would disappear.Huh? How do you know that, Young Master?Kid, why do we need to do that?So then, if Gilly and Murakan were to ask him these questions, he could reply that he had gotten the information from Jet and easily convince them.\u201cHm, this place looks good.\u201dAfter squabbling with Murakan for an hour, Jin and the others finally arrived before the inn Jet managed. But because of Murakan\u2019s constant grumbling, it felt like it had taken ten times longer.Please call for Jet at the reception.Jin unintentionally snorted and smirked when he saw the familiar signboard again.As always, the inn had a very odd name. Though, it was quite the fitting name if you took into account the fact that the place wasn\u2019t quite an inn, but an information broker\u2019s residence.\u201cWhy here specifically?\u201d\u201cBecause I heard the magicians at the Kollon Ruins talk about\u2026 Never mind. It\u2019s just my gut feeling.\u201dMurakan was still sulking and pouting as they walked through the front door. Meanwhile, Gilly stood confidently behind them as she fully trusted the young master no matter what.One slim man was sitting behind the counter, head on the hard table as his drool made a puddle. It was Jet. He hadn\u2019t sensed the trio\u2019s presence and simply snored loudly as the smell of alcohol filled the air.\u201cAre you the owner of the inn?\u201d\u201cHmmgh. Ah, a customer? Welcome.\u201dJet unsteadily fixed his posture and quickly scanned the three guests from head to toe. He then immediately categorized them into fools he could trick.\u2018A thin, weak-looking kid in a nice shirt, a swordsman on his first journey, and a woman. Well, she\u2019s quite pretty. Is she a maid? They\u2019re obviously a young and stupid aristocrat with his servants playing at adventurers.\u2019Despite such thoughts running through his mind, Jet simply showed a bright smile on the outside.\u201cDo you have empty rooms?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 They\u2019re all empty. You\u2019ve come to the right place. I take pride in my pricings. For travelers like you, it\u2019s the lowest price for the greatest treatment and beds! Now then, please take a look at our rooms and choose the ones you prefer most.\u201dJet stood up and swiftly pushed the trio upstairs. He was telling them to choose the room they wanted on their own and come back down.He planned to make them use the rooms already without telling them the detailed pricings. A typical scammer\u2019s technique.Furthermore, Jet quickly prepared three drinks for the guests while they were upstairs. Once the kid and his servants downed their glasses, he would charge them absurd fees for the service.Had the guests been seasoned mercenaries, Jet would\u2019ve stopped his schemes at this point.However, Jet didn\u2019t plan on holding back his tricks before this group of naive travelers.\u2018Once they\u2019re back and drink these, those three will start a new life in the underground auction house forever, huehuehue. I just hit the jackpot!\u2019Jet had made up his mind as soon as he saw the trio.He would sedate them with sleeping pills and sell them as slaves in the Tesing underground auction house. A quick mind and fast execution of his plans. This was how Jet became the greatest information broker of Akin in the future.Needless to say, Jin knew more about Jet than Jet himself did. He was already four steps ahead of him.\u2018I bet he\u2019s impatiently waiting for us to trick us with that outdated technique and make the most profit possible. Get ready to die, Jet.\u2019As he had predicted, Jet was waiting for them downstairs with three drinks as the trio returned.\u201cGoodness, you must be parched from your journey. Please have a cup to quench your throats, hehe. This is our inn\u2019s special orange juice. Its taste is unrivaled! Even aristocrats sometimes come here just to have another sip of this juice.\u201dThe Runcandels\u2019 blessed bodies have a slight resistance against most poisons, so these cheap sleeping pills would barely have an effect on Jin.Jin pondered for a while.Should he down the cup and tell him the sleeping pill was tasty while pummelling the man? Or should he dare Jet to taste test the drink first?However, there was one option that Jin had completely overlooked.\u201cDid you lose your fucking mind, you lowly son of a flea?\u201dMurakan wasn\u2019t in a good mood for a while now.The dragon had been staring at the bubbles floating in the spiked orange juice.\u201cOi, kid! Didn\u2019t your gut tell you this place was good? Then you should check your gut and fix it while I beat this piece of crap to death. Make sure to check carefully, alright?\u201dCreaaak.Murakan spoke as he slowly closed the inn\u2019s front door. It was now Jet\u2019s fate to endure Murakan\u2019s beating and spill all the beans.***Reaper Scans[Translator \u2013 The Return of the Koko][Proofreader \u2013 Yuki the PR Slave that Returned from Limbo]Join our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/reapercomics_________Proofreader\u2019s Corner (12/03/21) :Just something to note and a little transparency, especially for those who are not in our Discord server.

    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 \u2013 Tesing Underground Auction House (1)[Translator \u2013 Koko can do this!!][Proofreader \u2013 activating yuki cheerleader mode]Jet was doubting his own ears.Had these travelers, who were in Akin for the first time, lost their minds? Even so, customers were still customers. He decided to treat them with respect as he normally should.\u201cWhy are you acting like this, sir? Haha, even if you\u2019re a customer, it\u2019ll be problematic if you hurl insults at me\u2026\u00a0Kurgh!\u201dCrack.Murakan\u2019s left punch broke one of Jet\u2019s ribs in the blink of an eye. The scammer gasped for air, but before he could even feel the pain, a heel swiftly descended upon his shoulder, instantly rupturing his shoulder muscle.His two eyes and ears couldn\u2019t believe what was happening before him.\u2018E-Even though I\u2019m a 5-star knight?\u2019Although he was currently living like a ruffian in these streets, Jet was once part of a mercenary group. He had gone through countless hardships and was a seasoned fighter.There were very few situations where a 5-star knight could get beaten down so one-sidedly.\u201cLord Murakan! Why are you attacking him? The inn\u2019s owner is going to die!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the whole point, Strawberry Pie. I\u2019m trying to kill him. He put some poison in our drinks.\u201dFortunately for him, Jet was quick-witted and adaptable. He didn\u2019t hesitate to change his behaviour as he was quite attached to his life. The best plan right now was to immediately kneel down, admit his wrongdoings, and beg for his life.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2014\u00a0Khargh\u2014 Keuk\u2014 Urpp\u2026!\u201dNeedless to say, Murakan didn\u2019t give Jet the time to apologize and continued his flurry of attacks. The dragon in human form spat out all kinds of insults to the inn owner, such as \u2018you lowly son of a flea\u2019, \u2018piece of trash\u2019, \u2018go die\u2019, etc. However, his face was surprisingly expressionless the entire time.Murakan\u2019s lack of expression further enhanced Jet\u2019s fears.\u2018Such a satisfying spectacle.\u2019Seeing Jet\u2014with whom Jin had a terrible relationship in his past life\u2014getting pummelled to the ground gave him a brand new sense of gratification.However, the scammer would be quite useful here on out. If this continued, Jet would soon turn into a cold corpse.\u201cEnough, Murakan. Let\u2019s hear him out for now.\u201d\u201cDo you seriously have things to talk about with this asshole who secretly tried to poison us, kid?\u201dMurakan paused his beating and turned to Jin. Seeing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, Jet immediately knelt towards the boy.\u201cPlease spare my life, Young Master! I will do anything to pay for my sins!\u201dDespite his broken ribs and his flattened nose, Jet spoke clearly and articulately. His tenacity and will to survive were quite admirable.Jet had crawled to Jin\u2019s feet in the blink of an eye and clung to his pants. Murakan snorted but reluctantly paused his outburst of anger. Jin was still the promised contractor of a thousand years, so he would listen to the boy\u2019s thoughts and plans.Whack!\u201cLet go. Your blood is staining it.\u201dJin crouched down and slapped Jet across the cheek.\u201cYes! My deepest apologies. I\u2019ll let go, so please spare my life\u2026!\u201d\u201cI will ask you a few simple questions from now on. If you lie to us, you\u2019ll die. But if you answer truthfully, you\u2019ll live. I\u2019ll judge whether you\u2019ve lied or not depending on my mood, intuition, and gut feeling. Do you understand?\u201dJet nodded furiously, splattering droplets of blood everywhere around him.\u201cGood. What do you do for a living?\u201dNormally speaking, the first question one would ask would be something along the lines of \u2018Did you really spike our drinks?\u2019 or \u2018Why did you spike our drinks?\u2019 However, Jin\u2019s interrogation started off with a more fundamental question. Thus, Jet realized that Jin wasn\u2019t your ordinary kid.He knew it would be useless to try to gain Jin\u2019s sympathy, so all he could do was to reveal the truth as objectively as possible.\u201cI-I\u2019m an owner of an inn and an information broker. I also work as a pimp from time to time and dabble in some human trafficking\u2026 So I\u2019m involved in various jobs. I-If you spare my life, I can be very useful to you, Young Master! Akin is my area of expertise.\u201dGilly\u2019s face contorted due to Jet\u2019s mind-blowing self-introduction. Murakan nodded to himself while muttering \u2018I knew it\u2019.\u201cEnough with the unnecessary comments. In other words, you\u2019re a multi-functional piece of trash. Then did you spike our drinks to sell us somewhere as slaves?\u201d\u201cAs deplorable as it may be, that is the case\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere to?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201dCrack!Jin helped Jet\u2019s pinky finger meet the back of his hand for the first time. Jet didn\u2019t dare cry out in pain and stuttered out a certain name.\u201cT-T-T-T-Tesing! To the Tesing underground auction house!\u201d\u201cExplain.\u201d\u201cYes! The Tesing underground auction house is an auction house that an underground organization called Tesing manages\u2026 Down there, you can buy and sell slaves, drugs, all kinds of smuggled products and stolen artifacts!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have someone heal your body by this evening. You understand what you need to do afterwards, right?\u201d\u201cOf course! Thank you very much, Young Master. Thank you very much!\u201dHaving realized his life would be spared, Jet was about to kiss Jin\u2019s shoes.This multi-functional piece of trash would become useful to them during their stay in the Akin Kingdom. While Jin loathed Jet and his very existence, he still highly evaluated the piece of trash\u2019s skills and knowledge.Jin sent Jet upstairs. Today\u2019s \u2018Please call for Jet at the reception\u2019\u00a0would be closed for business.\u201cKid, why don\u2019t we just bury that piece of trash up some random mountain instead of paying for his medical fees?\u201d\u201cI concur, Young Master. He may try to backstab us again if we let him survive.\u201d\u201cAn underground organization and their auction house. It\u2019s the perfect thing to destroy in order to gain honour and reputation, don\u2019t you think? We can always kill him afterwards.\u201d\u201cThat is true, but\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s trust him this one time. We do need a guide during our stay in Akin after all.\u201dThe nanny and the dragon didn\u2019t argue anymore and agreed to the boy\u2019s plan. In order to have a smooth journey with no complications, one sometimes had to accommodate the party leader\u2019s decisions.Murakan and Gilly stayed behind in the inn to keep an eye on Jet while Jin left to find someone to heal the scammer.Jin truly considered the two of them as good friends.Nevertheless, as soon as Jin took a step outside the inn on his own, he felt an unprecedented sense of freedom and exhilaration. He could now make use of his knowledge as a regressor as much as he wanted inside the Akin Kingdom.The city\u2019s development was being hindered by the Tesings\u2019 tyranny. In other words, most of the buildings, facilities, groups, and organizations Jin knew of in his past life were highly likely to be present today.It didn\u2019t take him long to find a tight-lipped healer he could trust. \u2018Maltran\u2019 was someone who would heal anyone\u2014even wanted criminals\u2014as long as he was paid properly. Fortunately, his magic store was located at the same place as in Jin\u2019s memories.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re excellent at performing illegal medical procedures.\u201d\u201cWhere did you hear that?\u201d\u201cUnimportant. I will pay you handsomely.\u201dAlthough he definitely looked fifteen years younger, Maltran was still the same pot-bellied middle-aged man. Maltran visibly pondered for a moment, caressing his bulging stomach in the meantime.\u201c\u2026How\u2019s the patient\u2019s situation?\u201d\u201cA couple of broken ribs and a finger dangling abnormally. But he didn\u2019t lose a lot of blood.\u201dCling.Jin flicked a well-crafted ring to the middle-aged man. Maltran stood up immediately as he caught the payment.\u201cMy lucky day. Let\u2019s go.\u201dMaltran was a highly skilled healing magician.Once he arrived at the inn, it barely took him five hours to erase all traces of violence on Jet.In fact, Maltran\u2019s sweaty appearance as he earnestly cast healing magic made him look like a devout cleric.\u201cI see. The Lutero Magic Federation isn\u2019t called a magic federation for nothing. To think that a healer we found on the streets would be this skilled.\u201dGilly whispered to herself as she watched the medical procedure. Her eyes twinkled with curiosity and awe as she had rarely observed magic during her life with the Runcandels.Jet was touched by Jin and his willingness to hire such a good healer. As soon as he fully recovered, he knelt on the ground and continuously showed his gratitude.\u201cYoung Master, although our first meeting did not go so well, I now pledge my eternal allegiance to you. Please allow me to serve you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019ll depend on your behaviour and performance here on out. Have you finished, Healer? I hope his ribs won\u2019t suddenly break apart again in a few hours.\u201d\u201cWhat an unfunny joke. Well then, I will take my leave. Please call me again if there\u2019s another emergency. I will even heal someone for free a single time as long as it\u2019s nothing too serious. I always work as much as I\u2019m paid.\u201d\u201cYou have excellent work ethics. Have a nice day.\u201dMaltran left the inn.Jet was now carefully observing the trio\u2014who were sipping on their cups of black tea while seated.\u2018No matter how much I think about it, these people\u2026 They smell of money and authority. And here I thought I had an eye for people\u2026 How did I not notice it immediately?! And why did such big shots come to this desolate area of the city?\u2019The man who had beat him up was an extremely skilled fighter. The maid seemed to be used to seeing violent scenes. Finally, the boy Jet judged as a young and stupid aristocrat was naturally ordering the other two around as if they were his vassals.This was a sight Jet had never seen before.\u2018Is he the heir to a prominent martial clan? Or the Vermont Special Forces? Either way, if I recklessly betray them, I\u2019ll be erased from the face of this continent without a single trace left behind.\u2019After a while, Jet concluded that the trio were the Vermont Special Forces.He even believed that their actions so far had all been calculated, including their disastrous first encounter. Jet wasn\u2019t foolish to think so. The trio immediately realized their drinks were spiked and somehow found an excellent healer within an hour after the beating.\u2018These people must have investigated me before. I bet they know all kinds of information about me. They must plan on using me to enter the Tesing underground auction house to carry out some kind of mission\u2026\u2019And once they fulfill their mission, they would get rid of their now-useless hunting dog: Jet.Once he came to that conclusion, Jet clenched his teeth and steeled himself. He needed to become an indispensable existence to them in order to survive. He needed to be so useful to them that they wouldn\u2019t kill him. Thus, he needed to show them his absolute and undying loyalty and serve them wholeheartedly.Although the Tesings held immense power and authority, they could only wield those inside Akin like a frog in a well. Meanwhile, the Vermont Special Forces was an internationally renowned and prestigious organization. Therefore, Jet had no reason to hesitate on which side of the conflict he had to stand on.Jet soon shared more information about the Tesings and the underground auction house to the trio. Even though he made the wrong assumption about them, he was still a top-notch information broker.\u201cAlthough the Tesings\u2019 publicly known boss is someone called Salka, the real boss of the group is someone else. Salka is just a frontman and signboard. We call the real boss \u2018Spiderhand Alu\u2019 among ourselves.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cAlu is an extremely dangerous individual. Rumours say that Alu even has connections with pureblood Runcandels beyond the sea. About the underground auction house\u2026\u201dJin already knew most of the information Jet was sharing, but simply let the information broker continue his endless speech. This way, his companions could also learn of the information Jin knew from his past life.\u2018Still, connections with pureblood Runcandels? To think that such false rumours about Alu would spread. I highly doubt any of my siblings would associate themselves with some random thugs in the Lutero Magic Federa\u2014\u2019Jin suddenly placed his teacup back on the table as if he had suddenly remembered something.\u2018There is one. The one who tried to place a curse on me. It\u2019s possible if it\u2019s them. After all, this is the Lutero Magic Federation\u2014the Zipfels\u2019 territory.\u2019He couldn\u2019t make a hasty conclusion. Only a top-class magician could cast a curse on the level of \u2018Bladed Illusion\u2019, and there was no way these underground thugs had such a magician within their ranks.However, there was nothing Jin could do other than grasping at straws. He had spent ten years in the Storm Castle and five in the Garden of Swords. All this time, he had searched for the culprit behind the curse but couldn\u2019t find a single clue or trace.\u201cHave you finished explaining?\u201d\u201cYes! Please don\u2019t hesitate to ask me any questions after we arrive as well. I shall explain everything with all my heart. I swear to you on my son\u2019s life.\u201d\u201cYou have a son?\u201dAlthough Jin acted ignorant, he was quite close with Jet\u2019s son in his past life. The son was a kind and gentle kid, unlike his father.\u201cYes. Since I\u2019ve pledged my allegiance to you, let us set off after you\u2019ve seen my son\u2019s face. It is to prove that I hold no intention of betraying you, Young Master.\u201dThe son was probably about 2 years old right now. To think that he\u2019d use his own toddler as a tool to show his sincerity\u2026 Jin was once again amazed by Jet\u2019s awful nature and shook his head in response.\u201cForget it. Let\u2019s just go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 \u2013 Tesing Underground Auction House (2)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Any facilities managed by the Tesings can only be accessed by newcomers if they have an introduction from a regular. As a matter of course, that held true for the underground auction house as well.One hour by carriage. It wasn\u2019t very far from Jet\u2019s inn.The place they arrived at looked like an ordinary aristocrat\u2019s villa at first sight. However, it was actually a location where all kinds of illegal transactions took place.\u201cOh hey, Jet. Why do you have so many people with you today? Are they goods?\u201d\u201cWatch your mouth. These people are my guests.\u201dJet simultaneously shamed all of the guards. Although the guard apologized for his careless words, it showed that Jet was a respected and honored individual of Tesing.The three then followed Jet into the auction house. Even though it was operated by sketchy alleyway dealers, there were Akin nobles partying from the courtyard.\u2018This place hasn\u2019t changed one bit. Still pretty corrupted.\u2019Most of the nation\u2019s leaders were from the Tesing Clan, and not even official investigation agencies could snoop around this area.While regular citizens got abused by unregistered magicians and mercenaries, the feast never ended in the auction house as all kinds of things\u2014including humans\u2014got sold.Although the Zipfels were aware that all of this was happening, they didn\u2019t try to control and restrict these people. Not only was it because this land was important to the people of Akin, but also because the Zipfel Clan received bribes from Spiderhand Alu.It was very nerve-racking.\u2018Filthy scum.\u2019Jet ordered the guards to retrieve some masks and distributed them to his guests.\u201cSince we are going underground instead of lingering here, I recommend wearing a mask. Usually, masks aren\u2019t allowed. But, since I am your escort, you can cover your profile. Hehe.\u201dThere was a hidden staircase behind the garden. As expected, there wasn\u2019t a single thing different about this place. Even in the far future, the Tesings would rule the Akin Kingdom, and an auction would be held here everyday.Unless Jin interfered with the business of this place.As soon as they entered the underground area, the chattering stopped, and a pleasant violin melody filled the air. A group of musicians in tuxedos was constantly playing tunes for the public.\u2018It\u2019s just as I remembered it.\u2019It was all to Spiderhand Alu\u2019s tastes. He always tried to convince people that he wasn\u2019t an uncivilized gangster.\u201cWhat? Are you sure this is an underground auction house? Music? You\u2019ve got to be joking.\u201d\u201cI know, right?\u201dThey sat in the outskirts of the room for an hour. In the meantime, Jet informed the other executives that he brought guests. For the time being, there wasn\u2019t anyone who came to check the three masked people.\u201cIt does seem like Jet is a respected newbie recruit amongst those other fat-asses. So, what are you gonna do? Wipe out these lowly gangsters on your first day in Akin?\u201d\u201cThe guards that we saw on the way here didn\u2019t seem too shabby. There are also a lot of unregistered magicians. You aren\u2019t going to engage in a battle here, right, Young Master?\u201d\u201cYou guys think I\u2019m stupid? Let\u2019s at least look around the place.\u201dJin definitely did not want to flip this place upside down. As his companions said, it was dangerous, but there were also items that he had to obtain.\u2018Ancient magic tomes and the helm artifact.\u2019Magic tomes with spells that transcended the ones of this era, and a ring that turned into a helm artifact that overflowed with mana.Amongst the magic tomes, Jin wanted one from a great historical magician called \u2018O\u2019Hensirk\u2019. As for the helm artifact, it had amazing abilities. The owner could also mask their face anytime, which was convenient.Jin didn\u2019t know the exact date that O\u2019Hensirk\u2019s magic tome would be auctioned. It was more likely to get struck by lightning than the chances of the tome being sold today.\u2018It doesn\u2019t really need to be O\u2019Hensirk\u2019s. Ancient magicians\u2019 tomes are sold here everyday anyway. It\u2019ll be best to just wait a few days and buy the best item there is.\u2019Conversely, he knew the exact date when the helm artifact would be sold.Around five or six years later, the \u2018Helm of the Demon King\u2019 would soon fall into the hands of Emperor Vermont.When Emperor Vermont acquired the helm through tribute, many romanticists, historians, and scientists gathered together. They all considered the helm a masterpiece and tracked it down to take it for themselves.The historians called it the Helm of the Demon King due to the speculation that ancient demon kings used it in the past.For a while, there was a great commotion in the magic journalism community. They always got worked up when magic experimenters discovered or declared a new masterpiece.Since Jin was caught up on the massive, thick journals, he naturally knew the location where it was first discovered as well as the date it was auctioned.Surprisingly, it was located in Akin\u2019s notorious underground auction house. Yet, the helm had not been sold for the past few years, so it was thrown into a room\u2026\u2018The helm would be traded five years later, which means that it\u2019s in storage right now.\u2019They didn\u2019t have to come on the day of the helm\u2019s auction.They just needed to steal it.\u2018The problem is, how do we find and steal it in the first place?\u2019As Murakan and Gilly mentioned, they weren\u2019t dealing with a small organization that they could easily fight. Most of the guards were at least 6-stars, and there were unregistered magicians disguised as regular customers.It wasn\u2019t a crowd that Jin could handle on his own, and neither could they just use Murakan\u2019s power. As soon as he reveals his Draconic Magic, the Lutero Magic Federation would alert an emergency.\u201cThank you to those who came here this wonderful evening at the Tesing underground auction house, and thank you for waiting. We will now start the auction!\u201dAfter debating with himself for a while, the auctioneer finally emerged onto the stage.Simultaneously, a dozen naked slaves joined him, separated between men and women. All of them had drowsy eyes\u2014as if they were drugged. At least there weren\u2019t any children.\u201cAlright, alright. Numbers 1 through 30. Today\u2019s stock looks pretty darn good. Let\u2019s get this started.\u201dThe slave auction began. It didn\u2019t even take an hour for all of them to be sold.\u201cSo you were trying to sell us off like that?\u201d\u201cH-haha. It was foolish of me, Young Master.\u201dJin wanted to save them. Half of them were probably misfortunate people who were dragged in here without them knowing.But now wasn\u2019t the time.\u2018I can\u2019t think of a way to retrieve the helm without getting caught.\u2019The best idea was to bribe mercenary groups like the Black King Mercenaries or Ghost Mercenaries and call several 7-star soldiers to wipe out the entire place.But, aside from not having the kind of money to do that, Jin couldn\u2019t use his Runcandel name to command the army\u2014especially an army of a grand scale.He was terrorized by the feeling of being cornered. The situations and plans were too risky.A little later, he thought of a third option.\u2018Well\u2026 it\u2019ll feel a little awkward, but it\u2019ll be fun. It\u2019ll also help with finding out who Alu\u2019s connection is within the Runcandel Clan.\u2019That day, Jin didn\u2019t buy anything from the auction and returned to the inn.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *For a while, Jin spent each day doing nothing.He trained his magic and spirit energy on one side of the inn during the day and spent the rest of the day carefully watching the items sold at the underground auction house.When the three companions first came to the auction house, the Tesing guards were uninterested. But as the days progressed, their gaze slowly changed. Jet offered hospitality without any complaints.\u201cHey, kid. I am often curious about what goes on inside your head. You think that plan would actually work?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, I\u2026 I have an uneasy feeling about this. Would they really not know him? Jet emphasized that Spiderhand Alu is a people person.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the key point, Gilly. Alu probably knows someone from the Zipfel Clan, but they\u2019re probably just a low-tier magician or some old servant. So, even if I call myself Beradin, he can\u2019t call bullshit.\u201d\u201cBut you are a Runcandel. To say that you will impersonate Beradin Zipfel\u2026 This plan is a little\u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201dJin\u2019s plan went like this.If a valuable ancient tome was put on auction, he would buy it and find Alu. Then, in the name of Beradin Zipfel, reprimand him for selling tomes that are of \u201chis clan\u2019s\u201d property.Like Jin, Beradin was yet to become an important leader, so he was not well known yet.\u201cAt my age, I am able to conjure at least 5-star magic. If I were Alu, I would believe that I am Beradin. And even if we get busted, we can just run away.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m powerless right now, and would it be that simple\u2026\u201d\u201cThe kid\u2019s right, Strawberry Pie. I wouldn\u2019t even need to transform into my true form. Running away with two people is a piece of cake against these thugs.\u201d\u201cHmmm.\u201d\u201cEither way, if we want to execute this plan, a legitimately valuable ancient tome needs to be auctioned. Let\u2019s hope that one comes out today.\u201dAs the night arrived, as always, Jet prepared the carriage.\u201cSir, this may be out of the blue\u2026 but if you don\u2019t buy anything today as well, the Tesing executives may pester you. They\u2019ll probably call you out on only looking and not purchasing.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Just focus on the carriage.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201dThe auction started once again. Soon, the slave auction ended, and as the tomes and artifacts entered the stage, Jin straightened his back.\u201cThe slaves are once again sold out! And now\u2026 time for the antiques. I hope all of these return to people who actually respect the items\u2019 value. Let\u2019s begin!\u201cThe first item. The tome of a magician who once ruled the world, Matthew Woniak\u2019s magic tome. We haven\u2019t deciphered it, but some incredible spells are probably recorded on it. And already, our first bid!\u201dJin smirked. The auctioneer made a mistake while introducing the item. The correct name was Matthew Morniak. And, as Jin remembered, his publications were already in the Zipfels\u2019 bookshelves.The week\u2019s auctions were always like this; the auctioneer spat some nonsense, then the vanity-seeking magicians made stupid bids\u2026\u201cThis is the seventh item. Hmm, the author of this tome is\u2026 Tzenmi. Does anyone know of a magician named Tzenmi?\u201dThe auction house was quiet. Even Jin didn\u2019t know of that name.\u2018A tome like that is a gamble, and it\u2019s extremely rare to win that gamble.\u2019According to Jin\u2019s master\u2019s teaching of premonition, there was no need to buy Tzenmi\u2019s magic tome.However, Murakan thought differently.\u201cKid.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cBuy that. If it\u2019s the Tzenmi that I know\u2026 this is huge.\u201dThe dragon\u2019s advice\u2014a strong recommendation.Jin had no reason to doubt his words, so he raised his hand towards the auctioneer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 \u2013 Tesing Underground Auction House (3)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u201cOne hundred.\u201dOne hundred gold.That\u2019s how much Jin bid. For an ancient magic tome, the price wasn\u2019t too high or too low. However, the other guests thought Jin was crazy.\u2018He\u2019s paying a hundred for that?\u2019There were also magicians who were curious. After all, a guy who hasn\u2019t bought anything for the past week just bid for a magic tome.\u201cOne-fifty.\u201d\u201cOne hundred fifty on the table!\u201dSomeone raised the bid, but it wasn\u2019t because they wanted the item. The bidder held in his laughter as he stared at Jin.He was teasing him. He wanted to make a fool of Jin for trying to strike it rich or attain a higher level of magic by buying a mysterious tome, which was a common sight during the magic tome auctions in the auction house.Jin just ignored him and called for the next bid.\u201cOne-seventy.\u201dIf it were back in his first life, he would have called one or two thousand to flaunt his money and destroy the provoker\u2019s pride.But Jin knew that this wasn\u2019t the time to attract attention.\u201cAny more bids? Going once. Going twice. Sold!\u201dTzenmi\u2019s magic tome was delivered to Jin.With a straight face, Murakan opened the ancient tome and gripped Jin\u2019s hand.\u201cKid, this is an amazing acquisition.\u201dThis renowned shadow dragon was not an idiot obsessed with aura. He, like other dragons, could cast countless spells. And, back in his heyday, his magic skill level was at least 9-stars.\u2018An item that got Murakan all worked up? It must have spells incomparable to those of O\u2019Hensirk\u2019s.\u2019Additionally, Jin\u2019s and his companions\u2019 luck was yet to be over.\u201cUh, this is the 25th item of the auction. Previously owned by \u2018Schugiel Hister\u2019. Let the auction begin!\u201dHister.The name that Jin had the bar owner look into when he first went to a bar in Mamit. As soon as he heard the name, he doubted his own ears.Hister was the clan of Jin\u2019s master. But it was also a clan that officially dissolved hundreds of years ago.\u201cTwo hundred.\u201dJust as before, the crowd began to whisper after Jin called his first bid. They first thought he was somebody special, but now they thought of him as an idiot bidding for shit.\u201cTwo hundred. Anyone else?\u201dSchugiel Hister\u2019s tome was immediately sold.\u201cHey, kid. Why\u2019d you buy that? Are you feelin\u2019 something again?\u201d\u201cI thought it would be weird if I only bought one item, and I also have a good feeling about this one.\u201dAs soon as the tome arrived, Murakan cracked open the book. Not even one minute in, he shook his head. Unlike Murakan, Jin\u2019s heart pounded as he examined the tome.\u201cIt\u2019s just a tome with weird and complicated ciphers. Nothing too special.\u201dMurakan didn\u2019t seem to know.This weird and complicated cipher system was only known by two people\u2014Jin and his master. And since Jin learned it from his master, \u2018Schugiel Hister\u2019 must be his master\u2019s ancestor.After seeing the complex text, sorrow struck Jin\u2019s heart. He watched the auction continue, barely concealing his emotions. In the end, he didn\u2019t find anything interesting to buy.The night came to a close as the auction ended. Some guests stayed and enjoyed their time while others immediately left.Jin usually joined the latter, but tonight, he had to stay in the auction house.\u201cJet.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cI want to meet Spiderhand Alu.\u201dUsually, Jet would say that he understood. However, this time, his expression changed.\u201cUh\u2026 sir. That will be difficult. Even though you are a guest, meeting Alu is impossible. The most I can do is introduce you to Salka. If you really need to meet him directly, then please give us a few days.\u201d\u201cTell Alu that Beradin Zipfel wanted to see him.\u201dIt looked as if Jet\u2019s eyes would pop out as his face flushed red. He covered his mouth in shock.\u2018B-Beradin Zipfel?\u2019\u201cUnderstood?\u201dInstead of answering, Jet simply blinked.\u2018Shit. These guys weren\u2019t part of Vermont\u2019s Special Forces\u2026 but were members of the Zipfel Clan?\u2019Cold sweat drenched his body. Even though Vermont\u2019s Special Forces were notorious, it wasn\u2019t comparable to the Lutero Magic Federation.If anyone else introduced themselves as Beradin Zipfel, Jet would\u2019ve scoffed and cussed at the sight. However, that was not the case. In Jet\u2019s eyes, Jin and his party were beyond comprehension.Additionally, they have been part of the Lutero Magic Federation for quite some time, so there is no way they would be accused of impersonating the Zipfels.Jet\u2019s brain was running at the speed of light.\u2018I was mistaken. Severely mistaken. They\u2019re not a part of Vermont\u2019s Special Forces, but are pureblood Zipfels! This is an encounter of a lifetime.\u2019Five minutes ago, Jet\u2019s main goal was to become an informant of the presumed Special Forces unit. Then, he could\u2019ve saved his life and earned some reward greater than that of Tesing\u2019s.But what about becoming a servant of a Zipfel?To a member of the Lutero Magic Federation, there is no greater honor than serving a Zipfel. As Jin lifted his hand, Jet stood with stone-cold eyes.He quickly passed a few employees and opened a door.\u201cShit. Whatever. Whatever happens, happens.\u201dMurakan shrugged. Unlike his careless words, he was definitely itching for a fight. Gilly put her hand on her forehead as she heaved a heavy sigh.A Runcandel impersonated a Zipfel.Other than getting the message to Alu, Gilly thought of a different, more important problem.\u2018If this information ever reaches the ears of future clan members or the patriarch, then the Young Master will be executed.\u2019It would be the first time in the clan\u2019s thousand-year history.Not only that, but the Zipfels were also surely going to get worked up to catch the impersonator. Lies are always meant to be uncovered.\u2018On the contrary, it\u2019s surprising how the Young Master committed these devious acts without remorse.\u2019The awkward melody of a violin filled the room. As time felt like it was slowing down, a different agent came to greet the three.\u201cYou\u2026 are Beradin?\u201dSLAP!In a split second, Jin slapped the life out of the agent and caught the attention of the entire room.\u201cAre you Alu?\u201dHe wasn\u2019t. Jin still asked despite knowing Alu\u2019s face. The agent looked confused, but he couldn\u2019t fight back or anything.\u2018If this insolent kid is indeed Beradin Zipfel, the entirety of Tesing could disappear overnight.\u2019\u201cN-No, sir! The boss ordered me to escort you to him.\u201dSLAP!Jin slapped the agent once more. The agent quickly straightened his back and bowed as an apology for his ineptitude.Up until this moment, the plan went perfectly.\u201cMake Alu bring his ass here. I already revealed my name, and yet he sends over an underling?\u201dFwooooosh!On his right hand, Jin conjured a crimson sphere made of flames. Jin\u2019s mask flickered.With one look, one could tell that it was, at the very least, a 5-star skill.Anyone can claim to be a Zipfel. However, a young boy invoking high-level magic and calling himself Zipfel seemed more convincing.\u201cI apologize. I will report this to the boss.\u201dThe agents quickly led the other customers out of the auction house. The agent who got slapped was scrambling away, but Jin wasn\u2019t satisfied.\u201cTell your stupid boss to crawl to my feet. Since he mistreated his guests, he must be punished.\u201dJin discontinued the spell and scanned his surroundings. The rest of the guests had left, and the agents were startled.His words were loud and clear. If the boss actually appeared crawling on the floor, then the agents would have to do so as well.Five minutes passed.Spiderhand Alu crawled into Jin\u2019s presence. A fairly large middle-aged man crawling on the floor wasn\u2019t the most pleasurable sight. As for Alu, there were a million thoughts passing his mind.With him was a herd of his underlings, and among them was Jet who had bruises all over his face.It seemed that the others beat him up for saying bullshit about Beradin Zipfel being present.The other agents, who were awkwardly standing, quickly lowered their bodies to the ground.\u2018I guess \u201cZipfel\u201d is a very scary name to hear. I\u2019m sure the detected aura would be around 7-star, but they came crawling without even checking?\u2019If the situation proceeded as is, the rest of the job would be a piece of cake. After scaring Alu, they could examine the storage and take the helm artifact.However, Alu wasn\u2019t just any easy human. If he ever saw an opportunity after conversing for a while, he would let loose and kill all three of them.Jin did not say anything while Alu crawled to his feet. Jin stood as if he was used to acting like a superior. Frankly speaking, he acted the same way back home.\u201cRise.\u201d\u201cI am Alu\u2026 the man who runs the Tesing Clan. I failed to recognize Your Excellency, and for that, I beg for mercy.\u201dWith the other man towering over two meters, meeting Alu felt like facing a wall. However, he was permanently looking downwards, eyes never meeting Jin\u2019s.It was an obvious reaction after meeting an assumed pureblood Zipfel.\u201cShut up. Look at these.\u201dJin tossed Tzenmi\u2019s and Schugiel\u2019s tomes to Alu.\u201cWhat do these look like?\u201dOpening the tomes, Alu\u2019s face drained of color.\u201cThey\u2019re magic tomes. I apologize. We sold ancient magic tomes without the Zipfels\u2019 permission.\u201d\u201cThese two tomes that I purchased today are greatly valued\u2014even by my clan. I can\u2019t imagine the number of magicians who left to search for these\u2026\u201d\u201cBeradin, sir. This may sound like an excuse, but I am unrelated to that. My stupidity couldn\u2019t realize the tomes\u2019 worth and troubled you. I will try my best to recollect the other auctioned tomes. Please give me a chance.\u201d\u201cWould you be faster at gathering them, or would we magicians be faster? Quit the bullshit and bring an accountant and customer registry. Starting tomorrow, my clan will investigate your mischief.\u201dAs Jin skillfully lied, Alu realized that he had nothing to say. If the Zipfels started the investigation, then the Tesings would be destroyed.Alu reconsidered his options.\u2018Beradin Zipfel\u2026 Does his clan know that he\u2019s here?\u2019If they didn\u2019t\u2026Maybe getting rid of him would be better.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Aside from identifying me as the real Beradin, they would be dying to know if the Zipfel Clan knew of this commotion.\u2019He would be thinking of that too. In extreme scenarios, humans tend to prioritize survival over anything else.\u2018They can\u2019t strike me anyway even if they confirm that I am acting without the clan\u2019s knowledge.\u2019The real Beradin Zipfel and the impersonator Jin Runcandel. They could be identified as the brightest magicians of their era, but they were still in their teens. So fighting a group of Tesing\u2019s unregistered magicians would still be dangerous. There was actually no need to even summon them; Alu could probably deal with Jin by himself.But \u201cBeradin\u201d wasn\u2019t the only person that Alu had to consider.\u2018How good are Beradin Zipfel\u2019s bodyguards?\u2019A young man with slanted eyes and an emotionless woman. In the process of getting rid of Beradin, the bodyguards were the greatest threat.It wasn\u2019t easy to consider. Seeing that neither of their auras were detectable, they could either be weak magicians or masters who concealed their true power.\u201cAnd Jet, come over here. Don\u2019t just sit there like that.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cDamn, your face is a mess. Did you get beat up after mentioning my name?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m okay, sir. Don\u2019t worry about an insignificant guy like me\u2026 please remember your tasks.\u201d\u201cYeah? Alright, then.\u201dAlthough Jin felt sympathy for Jet, he was the least of his concerns.\u201cWhat are you doing, Alu? Bring me your transaction records and customer registry.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir Beradin. Hey! Didn\u2019t you hear him? Hustle!\u201dThe Tesing agents at the edge of the room scattered like ants. Despite there being over ten volumes of the records and registry, it was all still just the tip of the iceberg.\u201cThis is everything that is in the auction house, Sir Beradin. More important documents are in my residence\u2019s magic safe\u2026\u201dAs Alu\u2019s voice drifted off, he became self-conscious.\u201cMay I go there myself and retrieve it? You only need to wait a little bit.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 \u2018Wait a little bit\u2019, my ass. Can\u2019t you see the situation you\u2019re in?\u201cWho are you trying to fool with that obvious trickery? If I send you alone to find the purchase history, do you plan on destroying all of the important documents and contacting your connections to find out whether I\u2019m real and why I\u2019m here?\u201d\u201cNo, Sir Beradin. That is not my true intention.\u201dAlu knew that his plan was obvious, but he had to take his chances. Alu\u2019s ears flushed red, and he ducked his head only to see the edge of Jin\u2019s foot.\u201cHahaha\u2026 Alu. It seems you know how to be embarrassed. Very well, go ahead. Go by yourself. Do whatever you can for the time being, and you\u2019d still be in the palm of the Zipfels.\u201dAs soon as he heard that, Alu lost all hope.From his perspective, those were words that sprouted a chain of misunderstandings.\u2018He was\u2026 not alone. I thought wrong. There must be Zipfel magicians outside already\u2026!\u2019Jin smirked knowing that Alu would dig his own grave by overthinking the whole situation.\u201cI\u2026 I have been mistaken. I will proceed with a supervisor of your choice, Sir Beradin.\u201d\u201cPiss off. Starting now, I expect wise decisions from you, Spiderhand Alu. For the time being, I will be searching the storage.\u201dThe hopelessness in Alu\u2019s face dissolved. If he acted upon \u201cBeradin\u2019s\u201d expectations, he could get out of this situation alive.\u201c\u2026It will take around two hours, Sir Beradin. You guys escort Sir Beradin to the storage room while I am absent.\u201dWith a serious look on his face, Alu moved to exit the auction house. The only ones left inside were the Tesing agents as well as Jin and his companions.The quick-witted agents approached Jin and immediately escorted him to the storage.\u201cThere are many items from the boss\u2019s residence and summer house, but the Tesing auction house has only one official storage room. This way, please.\u201dA snitch. As soon as the boss was about to crumble, the agent commented about the \u2018many items from the boss\u2019s residence and summer house\u2019 to expose the crimes of embezzlement.If they all found out that he was bluffing, how would they react? Jin scoffed.It was his first time seeing the Tesing underground auction house\u2019s storage room. It started one more floor beneath the auction house, and its entire structure had three levels.The first basement housed the slaves, below that was the second basement with shelves of magic tomes, and lastly, the third basement that was filled with artifacts. Jin and the others were surprised at seeing the storage being bigger and more organized than they had expected.The slaves didn\u2019t react to the sight of new people. Although they were not drugged yet to be presented on stage, they didn\u2019t exactly foster any hope either.\u201cI will be outside. Please call me anytime if you need assistance.\u201dAs soon as the Tesing guard left, Jet began to worry.\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were such an important person! A successor of the Zipfel Clan. Sir, please offer me a chance to display my loyalty. I will do anything.\u201d\u201cGood idea. Starting now, go find out about the birthplace and real name of each slave in the first basement. Afterwards, a clan member will come and take them away.\u201d\u201cOh! Yes, I understand. I will proceed immediately.\u201dThe Zipfel Clan explicitly prohibited slave trading. In reality, there were still many who engaged in these illicit activities, but they just needed to avoid getting caught.Also, underlings should have fun while working for their reward.\u201cSo, kid. What are you gonna do? That Alu bastard will return after confirming that you\u2019re an imposter.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know that.\u201dOutside the auction house, contrary to what Alu imagined, there were no Zipfel magicians. He was walking on eggshells thinking that they were watching, but he would soon realize that it was all a hoax and contact acquaintances to confirm Beradin\u2019s identity.He would ask someone who knew of the appearance and whereabouts of Beradin Zipfel. It was only a matter of time until Jin got busted.\u201cWhy did you order Jet to survey the slaves when we are short on time? It\u2019s easy for us to escape, but he\u2019s dead meat anyway.\u201d\u201cNo, the paper with the birthplace and name will save Jet. As long as we drop off the slave registry at the Zipfel Clan\u2019s residence and the Vermont Empire\u2019s press, the Tesing Clan is doomed. Even if we\u2019re impersonators.\u201dIf the public caught on to this, not even the Zipfels could let this institution continue. The most elite magicians will be dispatched to save the slaves, wipe out the Tesings, and righteously rebuild the rotten Akin Kingdom.This result was obvious because the clan\u2019s lowest-ranked members needed to prioritize the Zipfels\u2019 reputation over the Tesing Clan\u2019s bribe.\u2018The irony will force them to make a move.\u2019Jin planned on appointing Jet as the messenger. Then the Zipfel Clan would protect him as a witness.Of course, in this scenario, Jet would be stuck with the Zipfels and the Empire\u2019s Investigation Team. But since he had strong survival instincts, he would only spit evidence that would be advantageous for him.For example, he would say something like \u201cThere definitely wasn\u2019t an impersonator of Beradin in Akin, and I am only reporting this institution because I felt disillusioned from the slave trading done by the Tesings.\u201dUltimately, Jin was not saving Jet because he was valuable; he was just being considerate of Jet\u2019s two-year-old son.Under witness protection, Jet can scrap his shady backstreet life and peacefully live the rest of his life with his son in vast unknown lands.It wasn\u2019t a bad future for the father and son. When considering all the other possibilities, there was no better future than this one\u2014not for Jet, but for the child.Because the pure and kind child would be following in his father\u2019s footsteps.\u201cWell, okay. Let\u2019s just say that part goes as planned. What next?\u201d\u201cWell, what do you think? Until Alu comes back, we get to shop for free and then leave. The Zipfels will deal with our mess, so you go to the second basement to find useful magic tomes. Gilly and I will visit the third basement to find the artifact.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, will we be choosing to commit these reckless actions in the future? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re doing this.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment, Gilly. Let\u2019s go.\u201dAt the Lutero Magic Federation, artifacts are normally more valuable than standard magic tomes.Additionally, in an auction house like this, it was common to find ancient magic tomes, but finding a high-tier artifact was pretty rare.The third basement was no different from a trash dump. It was hard to believe that there was a hidden masterpiece between these useless artifacts that people wouldn\u2019t take even if given for free.The two didn\u2019t need much time to find the Helm of the Demon King. Within the unruly mess in the corner of the room, they chose and opened the smallest chest.\u2018This is it!\u2019A low-quality silver ring with a ruby stone.As Jin suppressed his excitement and slipped on the ring, he could feel the energy flowing through his fingers.The mana, unlike normal mana, was formless. It was as if a dozen snakes wrapped around his finger, and the mana slowly entered his head.And Jin absorbed it all.\u2018Normal magicians would only think of this effect as an enhancement in magic. That\u2019s probably why this isn\u2019t considered a masterpiece right now.\u2019Now, Jin could use the magic he absorbed to summon a shadow-black helm whenever he wanted.If the user never utilized a powerful artifact or didn\u2019t have a strong feel for magic like Jin did, then the power was not immediately noticeable.\u2018Summon Helm.\u2019Fwoooosh!Jin tested out his new artifact, and black mana spread through the air. It formed lines and discs that slowly approached Jin\u2019s face.It didn\u2019t even take one second for the helm to form. The completed helm covered the entire face and neck; it had a hole for breathing and two others for the eyes. On each side of the helmet were two cool-looking sharp horns.Rather than being surprised, Gilly smiled at the sight of Jin\u2019s successful conjuring of the helm.\u2018I actually doubted if this would work out, but thankfully, we found it quick.\u2019Since they found the artifact, there was no need to stay in the third basement.\u201cGilly, I think this place is filled with garbage. Let\u2019s just return to Murakan.\u201d\u201cMmm, even I, an expert in magical artifacts, do not see anything in particular that catches my eye. Still, just in case, I shall take some ornamental artifacts that would make us good money.\u201dThe magic tome basement had the same situation. Even though Murakan meticulously searched for O\u2019Hensirk\u2019s works, he couldn\u2019t find anything while Jet surveyed the slaves.\u201cKiddo, since we already got Tzenmi\u2019s tome, there is no need to greed for more. Let\u2019s leave.\u201dIt had been an hour since Alu left. When Jin, Murakan, and Gilly walked back upstairs into the auction house, the agents respectfully greeted them.\u201cJet, you can go home now.\u201d\u201cYes, sir. I will be waiting for you at the inn. Hehe, please do not forget my service.\u201d\u201c\u2018Service\u2019, my ass. You were going to rat us out.\u201d\u201cOh, please forget the past. Since I met Sir Beradin, I have been reborn as a new person.\u201dJin flashed a sarcastic smile.\u201cYeah\u2026 Let\u2019s just forget the past, shall we? Big shot of Akin Jet, lend me your ear for a moment.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dAs Jet offered his ear, Jin finally whispered.\u201cI am not Beradin Zipfel. So take your son and quickly escape this place. If you can, go to the Vermont Empire. I assure you, that is the only way for you to survive.\u201dTo Jet, it had to be a jaw-dropping truth.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Is he part of the Vermont Special Forces, just like I guessed?\u2019Jet was hastily running with his son peacefully sleeping in his arms. Luckily, the child remained sound asleep until they arrived at the dock.\u2018Dammit, my life is ruined. I was gonna land a position as an accountant in Akin.\u2019His big dreams, everything he worked hard for; he had to leave them all behind.\u2018I didn\u2019t think that I would be running away.\u2019Even until the moment he boarded the ship, he doubted his life decisions based on the words of a child he didn\u2019t even know.Jet climbed into the starboard with a disappointed face and sifted through his pockets. He grabbed a heavy gold necklace, a ring, and a handful of tiny gold pieces.Keep this while you run away. Feed your son well.Those were the last words Jet heard from Jin. He couldn\u2019t understand the child\u2019s intent of helping after impersonating Beradin and manipulating Jet.\u2018Welp, I\u2019ll first get to Vermont and wait for the news.\u2019Jet was clearly depressed.* * *BANG!The auction house\u2019s agents woke up to the sound of someone busting a door open. Alu furiously stomped in with heavy breaths.\u201cThat scamming fucker\u2014Where is he?!\u201d\u201cHuh? Boss, who do you mean?\u201d\u201cBeradin Zipfel! That bloody impersonator of Beradin Zipfel! Bring him to me right now. I will peel his skin and kill him\u2026!\u201d\u201cWh-what do you mean by \u2018impersonator\u2019, boss? There\u2019s no way.\u201dAll of the agents exchanged glances of cluelessness, as if uttering \u2018Did you know?\u2019 \u2018The hell if I did.\u2019\u201cBoss, th-they already left. About an hour ago.\u201dAlu was going to go insane from their stupidity.Slap! Slap!He slapped each of his agents with his thick hand.\u201cYou useless sons of bitches. You let that happen? You just let that happen?\u201d\u2018But boss, you got tricked as well.\u2019No one had the courage to point it out. Whenever Alu\u2019s eyes were in the back of his head, it was smarter to just stay silent.\u201cBoss, those guys\u2026 They took all of the customer registry and transaction records. They didn\u2019t take anything valuable from the basement though\u2026\u201dAlu was about to explode. As much as he wanted to slaughter all of his workers, catching the impersonator was more important.\u201cGet ready to chase them down. We\u2019re catching those rat bastards before sunrise.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Meanwhile, Jin had already sent the anonymous letter to three places using postal magic. He sent it to the Vermont Imperial Family, Zipfel House, and the Akin Kingdom Press.If the anonymous note only said \u2018Tesing is bad\u2019, then the three organizations wouldn\u2019t bat an eye.However, Jin sent different pieces of evidence for each recipient. He sent the slave records to the Imperial Family, the transaction history to the Zipfels, and the customer registry to the press.\u2018The Vermont Imperial Family would take action after seeing that the majority of the slaves in the Tesing underground were citizens of its empire. The Zipfels would get heated over all of the illegal transactions of valuable artifacts. Essentially, the Tesing Clan is doomed.\u2019And of course, the Akin Kingdom Press would speak out after receiving the customer registry. Even though the press was under the Tesings\u2019 control, there were those who silently despised the clan\u2019s business.Now, the organizations just needed to read the information within two days. Then, the Tesing Clan would be obliterated and forgotten forever.Despite the imminent downfall, Jin did not leave Akin. He and his companions were waiting for Alu at the outskirts of the kingdom.Jin needed to check if he has a connection with a Runcandel in any way.\u201cKiddo, aren\u2019t you being too wary of Jet\u2019s words? You really think any of your siblings could get along with those lowly scums?\u201d\u201cI agree, Young Master. There\u2019s no way a Runcandel would meet such people.\u201d\u201cThe Tesings themselves are not significant, but Alu is at least a 7-star. Thus, he is a man of significance.\u201dJin didn\u2019t know anything from Alu\u2019s past aside from the fact that, at some point, he took control of the clan and corrupted Akin.\u201cHm\u2026 Well, we should at least thank him before we leave. Other than Tzenmi\u2019s magic tome, he also gave us a great masterpiece. I was pretty surprised when you came out of the basement with that ring.\u201dAccording to Murakan, the ring artifact was not called the \u2018Helm of the Demon King\u2019, but instead was called \u2018Myulta\u2019s Rune\u2019.Thousands of years ago, the demons of Myulta created this artifact in order to protect one of their great leaders from the never-ending battles.And that great leader was the first emperor of Vermont.\u201cI honestly can\u2019t believe we found this in some sketchy basement. After everything is over, let\u2019s decipher and read through Tzenmi\u2019s magic tome.\u201dThey waited for two hours.Some time later, a group of Tesing agents found the three sitting around a small fire.\u201cIt\u2019s him! Report to the boss!\u201dBoom!An agent fired a signal firework. However, they couldn\u2019t blatantly attack the three targets. The impersonator was a child, but they remembered that he wielded at least 5-star magic.It was a weird standoff.Jin\u2014who had no intention of running away\u2014blankly stared at the agents, and the agents were waiting for reinforcements.\u201cMurakan.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI want to duel Alu.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve gotta be kidding me. So, you\u2019re telling me to deal with all of the peons?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cMan, what a hassle\u2026\u201dWhile Murakan complained, Alu arrived. He was soaked with sweat from running hastily.Behind him were about a hundred underlings who were also panting from exhaustion.The agents who were cautious of Jin became confident after the reinforcements\u2019 arrival.\u201cY-You\u2026 motherfucker. The hell are you guys doing? Get him!\u201d\u201cWait here and guard our Strawberry Pie.\u201dOut of all the attacking agents, half of them were magicians, and the other half were mercenaries. The magicians started to cast their spells from afar, while the mercenaries charged at the enemy.Unlike them, Murakan was basically naked. He only wore a thin shirt and had a small dagger in his hand.Crack!\u201cKurkk.\u201dHowever, despite his lack of gear, Murakan cracked the first attacker\u2019s jaw with his elbow and dashed into the crowd of mercenaries.They weren\u2019t well-trained, but they weren\u2019t unskilled either. In the middle of the crowd, every time Murakan threw a punch, someone either died or fainted.In the eyes of Alu and his bodyguards, Murakan looked like an invincible fighter.\u201cYou fucking idiots! Attack the kid in the back, not him!\u201dThe magicians changed their target after hearing Alu\u2019s screech. Jin scoffed at the sight of ineptitude.\u201cFire!\u201dThe lead magician shouted, and the magicians simultaneously raised their staves.\u201cGilly, get behind me.\u201dFwoooooosh.They chose to fire the 3-star ice magic, Icicle Shot. Fifty icicles aimed for Jin and flew towards him.However\u2014\u2018I don\u2019t even need to block this.\u2019Thanks to Demonic Beast King Orgal\u2019s Pendant, Jin was immune to any spells that are 5-stars or lower.Crackle\u2026 Crackle\u2026!The icicles disintegrated before they could reach Jin. The spells of Tesing\u2019s unregistered magicians were blocked with a blink of an eye.\u201cWh-What are those guys\u2026?\u201d\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cOof!Murakan was already almost done with the peons. It didn\u2019t matter if there were fifty or a hundred\u2014peons were peons. It was too easy for the Shadow Dragon.Five minutes passed since the battle started.The Tesing mercenaries were losing their will for battle. But their devastating defeat against the ones who tricked the clan was not only because Jin and his companions were strong.After finding out that Jin was an impersonator, the agents of the Tesings\u2019 elite forces ran away.They predicted that \u2018Alu was done for\u2019. Until now, the Zipfels had overlooked the Tesings\u2019 illegal activities. But after being tricked by the impersonator, they knew that the Tesing Clan would inevitably fall.After sunrise, it was certain that the Zipfels would take action, so their escape was a wise choice.At this point, Alu knew that his underground empire would soon fall.\u201cHehehehe.\u201dAlu cracked a pained smile as his sword emitted a white aura.\u201cIt seems that you guys aren\u2019t just any normal scammers.\u201dSCHICK!Alu began to slash at his own magicians. They could not escape their crazy boss, so most of them immediately died on the spot.\u201cB-Boss, why are you doing thi\u2014AAACK!\u201d\u201cAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!\u201dAlu slaughtered every single one of his minions with a straight face, living up to his \u2018Spiderhand\u2019 name.\u201cWho sent you guys? Who hired you in the first place?\u201dHe spoke with bloodshot eyes.\u201cYou guys were gonna go to hell anyways. I\u2019m just alleviating the pain you would have felt.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 but\u2014\u201dSLASH!\u2018He\u2019s fast!\u2019Alu threw a dagger at Jin, barely missing his cheek. If Jin were a little slower, the dagger would have sliced his neck.\u201cBut how unfortunate. I don\u2019t intend to go to hell alone. You guys are coming with me.\u201dThis was just the beginning.There were 50 meters between Jin and Alu.Jin felt the goosebumps traversing his body.\u2018As expected from a 7-star knight.\u2019He had met countless 7-star knights, but this was the first time one tried to kill him. His throat dried from the pressure of the standoff.The moment he drew his sword\u2026\u201cYou finally met someone your size. I guess it is my turn to guard Strawberry Pie. Kuku, good luck!\u201dMurakan shouted at Jin as he ran away with Gilly on his back.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63 \u2013 Tesing Underground Auction House (6)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u201cYou dare dodge my dagger? Pretty impressive agility for a magician. Or maybe it was luck?\u201dAlu thought that Jin was a magician; probably because Jin showed off 5-star magic when he impersonated Beradin Zipfel.Clang!Alu quickly closed the gap between them and swung his sword.His eyes widened, however, as Jin deflected it.\u201cSo you weren\u2019t a magician?\u201dBradamante glowed with an overflowing aura.All Jin did was deflect Alu\u2019s attack, but it felt as if his bones rattled. Jin quickly backed off.As soon as he widened the gap, Alu closed the distance once more. He could read all of Jin\u2019s movements.\u201cThis is getting pretty annoying.\u201dSlash!The following slashes ripped Jin\u2019s coat. Droplets of blood scattered into the air, but it wasn\u2019t a serious injury.\u2018He\u2019s fast. It probably isn\u2019t even his full power, but I\u2019m already getting tired.\u2019The fight was proceeding as Alu planned.It was unbelievable that Alu was this strong. Jin barely had time to react to each attack, constantly being pushed back.At this point, Alu thought that the child was a knight.\u2018The spell he showed at the underground auction house was probably fake. Dammit, how could I fall for such a trick?!\u2019He was pretty pissed at himself.Even though he knew his opponent was not Beradin Zipfel, he controlled himself and attacked with composure. His enemy\u2019s rank was about 5-stars, but still, he couldn\u2019t assume anything.And yet, despite that knowledge, Alu was not concerned about Jin. He was more worried about Murakan, who was flashing a smile while watching them.\u2018I thought that guy was a minion. Why isn\u2019t he fighting?\u2019After destroying dozens of Alu\u2019s men, Murakan just proceeded to stop fighting altogether. Alu didn\u2019t know the guy\u2019s intentions, but he wanted to think about it after killing Jin.Murakan, on the other hand, enjoyed watching the young Runcandel struggle.\u2018I know you\u2019re pretty talented, but enough to challenge a 7-star? Yeah, right. I hope you learn something today, you audacious brat. Hehe.\u2019Murakan smirked.Clang, clang!The clashing of Jin\u2019s and Alu\u2019s swords was music to his ears.\u201cLord Murakan, are you not going to help? I understand that it was Young Master\u2019s orders, but he doesn\u2019t stand a chance against a 7-star.\u201dAs Gilly said, Jin was barely staying alive. His dodges were on point, but his movements were definitely getting slower.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Strawberry Pie. That kid needs to know the value of life.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cAnd, my little Strawberry Pie, you think that kid will lose?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dMurakan smirked.It was fun watching Jin get constantly attacked, but Murakan already knew the outcome of the fight.\u201cFor the magic swordsmen of the Runcandel Clan\u2026\u201dSpeak of the devil. As soon as Murakan began his sentence, Alu quickly backed off from Jin.Fwoooosh!From Jin\u2019s hand came a pillar of flame. It was the 5-star fire spell \u2018Flame Pillar\u2019. More fiery pillars blasted out from the ground.\u201c\u2026A 7-star knight is nothing.\u201dIt was the first time Alu had backed off in a fight. His eyes widened.\u201cA m-magic swordsman?\u201dAlu tried his best to dodge or deflect the incoming flames\u2014they were very difficult to extinguish.\u2018There\u2019s no chance to react. Shit\u2026\u2019Normal magicians needed some preparation time in order to fully cast a spell. One must gather up mana and then convert it into usable magic.However, it was different for those who were more talented. Jin could gather and convert mana simultaneously at a ridiculous speed.Additionally, because Jin was a \u2018Dual Caster\u2019, he could secretly prepare a spell without Alu\u2019s knowledge.\u2018My spells will be effective in this fight.\u2019Jin felt pretty confident. A high-level spell out of nowhere would scare anyone\u2014even a 7-star like Alu.\u201cYou two-faced bitch!\u201dAlu shouted as he barely extinguished the fire off his clothes.Jin already prepared the same spell, but he knew that the same attack wouldn\u2019t work twice.\u2018I\u2019ll use this spell again to make him piss his pants, and then I\u2019ll finish him off shortly afterwards.\u2019It didn\u2019t matter how strong the opponent was.As long as he held a few tricks up his sleeve, the outcome of the battle would always be a fifty-fifty.Win or lose.That was how Jin maintained a 50% win rate throughout his battles against opponents who were stronger than him. Or at least before the world finds out he was a magic swordsman.It was because he had mana and spirit energy. With only one spell using mana, Jin was able to scare the living daylights out of a 7-star knight. But if he also used his spirit energy\u2026However, Jin did not intend to use it.Bzzzzzzt!Next came a lightning spell. Jin conjured the spell he used on the Moonlight Fountain, and a bolt of lightning struck the location he selected, illuminating the night sky.Alu felt the imminent strike and quickly moved away, throwing his body to the side and releasing a volley of daggers after.Zoom!When a dagger brushed past Jin\u2019s shoulder, Alu thought that it was a chance to kill him.However, Jin already expected more attacks after the flying daggers. He knew that dagger-users used that technique before landing a lethal blow.The moment Jin lowered his body to dodge the rest, Alu planned to close the distance and strike his throat.It was the perfect opportunity.\u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019For a split second, Alu\u2019s legs overflowed with energy. There was an explosion as he pushed off the ground, leaving a crater in his wake.His sword was aimed at Jin\u2019s neck. Whether it was by stabbing, or beheading, Alu was sure that Jin would be dead.He never would have guessed that this entire situation was formulated by Jin.\u2018I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t notice that I became vulnerable too easily.\u2019On a normal occasion, Alu would\u2019ve noticed this trick. He was a 7-star for a reason.However, he was desperate.Since it was his first time fighting a magic swordsman, he decided to end the fight as soon as possible. After all, the longer the fight, the more chances a magic swordsman had to attack their opponent with more spells.Alu\u2019s sword was about to slash Jin\u2019s throat.Gilly gulped.Murakan knew it was Jin\u2019s victory.\u2018Summon Helm.\u2019Clang!The sword was supposed to smoothly slide through, but it was halted by something instead. It was because Jin activated his newly acquired artifact, Myulta\u2019s Rune, to conjure a black helm.This was why every knight dreamt of owning Myulta\u2019s Rune. It was the only helm that could completely nullify a 7-star knight\u2019s strike\u2014the only one in the world.The helm deflected Alu\u2019s blade, causing the man to lose his balance. Jin took this opportunity.Slash!Bradamante cut through Alu\u2019s shoulder.\u201cI guess it\u2019s over.\u201dMurakan shrugged. Gilly couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.\u201cKuuuuuh\u2026\u201dHe could\u2019ve stabbed his heart, but Jin stopped his sword. Barely breathing, Alu fell to the ground, and he was able to postpone his death a little longer.Gurgle, gurgle.Jin stared at Alu, who had a mouth bubbling with blood.\u201cLet me ask one more thing before I leave. I heard you had ties with the Runcandels.\u201d\u201cKukuku.\u201dAlu smirked and glared at Jin, as if he were saying \u2018You\u2019re a Runcandel?\u2019\u201cTell me. Name any Runcandel.\u201d\u201cHey, hey. Kiddo. You got it all wrong. You should\u2019ve pinned him down and then asked him. How is a dying guy gonna answer all your questions?\u201dMurakan walked towards Jin, shaking his head in disapproval. He was right, but Jin couldn\u2019t do anything about it.It was probably impossible for him to pin down a 7-star knight.\u201cI\u2026 see. I get it. Jin\u2026 you bastard. Jin\u2026 Runcandel\u2026\u201d\u201cI mean, the name \u2018Jin Grey\u2019 is pretty common nowadays. I guess it doesn\u2019t matter for a guy who\u2019s about to die.\u201d\u201cPtoo!\u201dAlu coughed as he spat out blood. And yet, he was smirking. For a while, Alu breathed coarsely while smiling creepily.Then, he spoke.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter\u2026 You\u2014You can\u2019t stop him\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEven though he failed back then\u2026\u201dThose were his last words. His eyelids lowered, and he no longer breathed.\u201cThe fuck did he mean?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, are you alright?\u201dMurakan and Gilly spoke at the same time.Jin lightly nodded, still confused about Alu\u2019s final words.\u2018He failed back then, and I can\u2019t stop him\u2026?\u2019Of course, those were some words from a scummy thug. His words definitely implied some connection with a Runcandel, but they\u2019re not necessarily trustworthy words.But if this man had ties with a Runcandel, the \u2018failure\u2019 he uttered would refer to \u2018Bladed Illusion\u2019, and the \u2018unstoppable entity\u2019 would be\u2026\u2018No way.\u2019One name popped up in his head.Runecandel\u2019s successor, Joshua Runcandel.\u2018Alu means that I can\u2019t stop him. The only person who I can\u2019t stop is the man who would lead the clan.\u2019The entire world knew that Joshua would be the next Runcandel patriarch.All of these realizations were still an assumption, but it was still unsettling.\u201cSpiderhand Alu. It probably isn\u2019t his real name.\u201dIt was something he never thought of.\u201cYoung Master, why do you bring that up?\u201d\u201cI should find out. Because this guy seems to have ties with a Runcandel. It\u2019s also weird that a 7-star is running some sketchy side business.\u201d\u201cKiddo, there are 9-stars who run a bar their entire lives. I\u2019ve seen many like this corpse. One of your ancestors was like that.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the clan I will soon lead. It\u2019d be nice to clean up some old history. Well, let\u2019s go. We should look for more informative people like Jet.\u201dThe three then left the capital city of Akin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64 \u2013 Tzenmi\u2019s Magic (1)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Two men were frowning as they sat in a cramped room.They had been talking with Jet for the past few hours.\u201cSo let me get this straight, Mr. Jet. You\u2026 filled out this anonymous note for the prosperity of the citizens and the downfall of Akin.\u201cAnd you, who were mostly a lowly accountant, decided to betray your organization because you accidentally walked into the slave storage and was shocked by the atrocity?\u201cMoreover, among the documents you risked your life to take, there was also an accounting record of the magic tome auctions. And you thought it would be a way to collapse the Tesing Clan from the inside, so you handed it over to the Zipfel Clan.\u201cAnd out of all of the different press media throughout Akin, you specifically chose the one that is against the Tesings\u2019 atrocities because you were interested in Akin\u2019s politics\u2026\u201cLastly, since you are a mere harmless reporter, you want us to protect you in order to stay safe from Tesing\u2019s surviving forces\u2026 Is that what you mean?\u201dJet frantically nodded.\u201cPrecisely! Man, I tried to do some good deeds in order to live out my life. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m being treated like this. Please let me go. I\u2019m worried about my son.\u201dThe two men let out a deep sigh.They were part of the Vermont Criminal Investigation Team. After receiving the letter about the Tesing Clan\u2019s misdeeds, they caught Jet at the port and began an investigation.As Jin expected, Jet had a strong survival instinct.He listened to each word uttered by the investigators and responded with the most advantageous reply possible.Talking about the Beradin impersonator wouldn\u2019t help him in this situation. He had to sugarcoat everything as an \u201cact of goodness\u201d to gain witness protection.The investigators were baffled.\u2018No matter how I look at it, there\u2019s no way this bastard acted upon moral values. He just wrote his name on the letter. He didn\u2019t draft the entire thing.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s probably the shady people who destroyed the Tesings. However, we don\u2019t need to chase the culprits around.\u2019Instead of finding the true author of the letter, declaring the bastard in front of them as the righteous hero would be much more convenient.On top of that, apart from the initial letter, the handwriting from the slave records matched Jet\u2019s signature. At least he wrote the slave records himself to save the Vermont citizens.The investigators shrugged.\u201cAlright, Mr. Jet. Honestly, you kinda look like some lowly scum, but we\u2019ll turn a blind eye on your lies since you are saving dozens of Akin citizens.\u201d\u201cHowever, the Zipfels have already requested your testimony, so you have to cooperate with us.\u201d\u201cThe Zipfels are searching for me\u2026? No, no, no way. If I go there, I\u2019ll die.\u201d\u201cNothing will happen if you tell them what you told us. As long as your story stays consistent, the Vermont Criminal Investigation Team will keep you safe. Just go and tell them the story.\u201d\u201cIf they hear something different from us, then it gets really annoying. You have some time before you go to the Zipfels\u2019 investigation room, so go see your son and eat some food.\u201dAn hour later, Jet followed the investigators to the investigation room.Ultimately, he didn\u2019t say a single thing about the Beradin impersonator, and the Zipfel investigators couldn\u2019t kill him even though they knew that he was lying.\u201cStill, we can\u2019t make you a hero. The Zipfel Clan will take the credit for the downfall of the Tesings.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care, as long as you promise to keep me alive and protect me.\u201d\u201cI will hear the truth once I beat the crap out of the surviving Tesing agents. Leave. Also, don\u2019t think that the Vermont witness protection is perfect.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The Tesing Clan was demolished.Despite causing a ruckus, the three companions didn\u2019t even get a bounty on their heads.This wasn\u2019t the Zipfels\u2019 business. The destruction was unfortunate for those who lived off of Tesing\u2019s dirty money. However, if the Zipfels announced that they destroyed the Tesings, then they would gain more trust from the citizens of Akin.Either way, for the Zipfels, the support gained from the people of a miniscule kingdom was equivalent to that of an ant.\u201cSo the Zipfel Clan and Vermont Imperial Family would share the fame while you would rake in the true benefits.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Myulta\u2019s Rune, Tzenmi\u2019s magic tome, and Schugiel Hister\u2019s magic tome are now in our hands. Also, I got to fight a 7-star knight.\u201d\u201cNot all 7-stars are the same, Young Master. Please be more cautious in the future. A magic helm, magic, spirit energy, and swordsmanship\u2026 You\u2019re a great fighter. However, we can\u2019t always walk on a tightrope like this.\u201d\u201cOf course. No matter how hard I try, I can\u2019t stand against actual opponents like you can, Gilly. I already know that. Still, I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201dFor a few days, the three spent their time in a remote village near Akin and observed the flow of events. With everything going as Jin predicted, Murakan and Gilly were astonished.\u201cWell, it looks like the Zipfels wouldn\u2019t be searching for us. We can travel to our next destination without too much pressure.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s our next stop?\u201dJin already had a place in mind.\u201cThe Free City of Tikan.\u201d\u201cTikan?\u201dAfter experiencing their journey through Akin, the three felt the importance of having an information broker like Jet. They needed someone to give them valuable information about the area as they continued on their journey based on Gilly\u2019s and Murakan\u2019s memories.Additionally, information about Vishukel Yvliano\u2019s, Kinzelo\u2019s, and Alu\u2019s true names; the prohibited magic in the Kollon Ruins; as well as other things.There were many things they wanted to know. Moreover, territories weren\u2019t some places one would just casually visit.Tikan, the Free City, wasn\u2019t an exception.\u2018Once we get there, I should form relations with Ghostblade Kashimir.\u2019Even in the present world, there weren\u2019t many who knew of Ghost Blade Kashimir. Many young Runcandel swordsmen begged him to be their teacher, but he always refused.The reason being that he had a valuable intelligence agency known as \u2018Seven-Colored Peacock\u2019.Excluding the intelligence agencies of the Runcandels, Zipfiels, and Vermont Imperial Family, the Seven-Colored Peacock was the next best information source. It would be the most useful source during a time before the Runcandels rose to power.The agency was an incredible group of information brokers, but none knew that its leader was Kashimir.He was also known as \u2018the Fallen Prince of Vermont\u2019 in the present world. To a regressor like Jin, it wasn\u2019t anything special, but the world was turned upside down when his status and identity were revealed.\u2018The seven information brokers that form the Seven-Colored Peacock were all loyal Vermont higher-ups. Along with Kashimir, they are a gathering of abandoned Vermont nobles.\u2019Jin didn\u2019t know the entire story, but he knew that the Seven-Colored Peacock consisted of many useful people.Ten years later, the Fallen Prince Kashimir would become the first ruler of The Free City of Tikan.Using the information that they gathered for decades, they would compromise sovereignty and the right to rule the land. They were beyond talented.\u2018Going to Tikan is easy. The problem is getting close to Kashimir.\u2019Deeply in thought, Jin smirked.\u2018A small country needs power. I\u2019ll lure Kashimir to me with the thing he wants most.\u2019The most stable way to strengthen a country is to enlarge its military force. This way, it can fight against invasions and build its infrastructure.However, after earning its independence, Tikan remained as a mere small country.Due to its small population, the military force is small. There wasn\u2019t a great abundance in resources, so it couldn\u2019t even advance its technologies. It was a country reliant on \u2018information\u2019.\u2018If he seems reasonable, I\u2019ll ask him about the mirror artifact at the Kollon Ruins.\u2019Of course, Jin couldn\u2019t show Kashimir an artifact that he doesn\u2019t have, nor could he explain its abilities.Moreover, it all depended on Kashimir\u2019s aspirations for the army he had. Humans would naturally believe things they want to believe.\u2018Even if I obtain the mirror artifact, I don\u2019t intend to hand it to Kashimir. Though, I can share its healing effects. I\u2019ll show him Myulta\u2019s Rune and teach him the existence of these masterpieces. After that, I will slowly convince him to support me.\u2019Not only that, Jin also planned to break the rule of not using the clan\u2019s name as a provisional flag-bearer. He had to introduce himself as a Runcandel to at least make Kashimir bat an eye.\u201cWhy are you laughing, kiddo? What kind of place is Tikan? Never heard of it in my generation.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably because of the information brokers, Lord Murakan. There is a massive intelligence agency called the Seven-Colored Peacock\u2026\u201dAs Gilly continued to explain, Murakan shook his head.\u201cYou\u2019re choosing abusable scapegoats, just like we used Jet. Not bad. Is that why you were so excited?\u201d\u201cI was laughing because of the magic tome. By this time tomorrow, wouldn\u2019t the deciphering of Tezmi\u2019s magic tome be finished? I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d\u201cYeah, wondering about that Tzenmi guy\u2019s magic got my stomach in knots. Seems to be light-type magic\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI said it\u2019s light-type magic.\u201d\u201cI remember that all light-type magic was forgotten after ancient times\u2026 Wait\u2026\u201dJin shook his head. He already heard a few times that Tzenmi was a magician of Murakan\u2019s era.Light magic.It was the dream of all magicians of the present.\u201cWhat the fuck happened? To think that Tzenmi\u2019s tome was being tossed around in a sketchy, run-down underground auction house. If I were Tzenmi, I would\u2019ve crawled out of my grave.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of person was Tzenmi?\u201dMurakan smirked at Jin for a few seconds.\u201cFifteen hundred years ago, around five hundred renowned Zipfel magicians plotted to assassinate Tzenmi. But they all failed. Which is probably why no one\u2014including you\u2014knows of Tzenmi.\u201dIt was similar to how they wiped any records of the Runcandels\u2019 magic swordsmanship to a clean slate.The Zipfel Clan completely erased Tzenmi\u2019s existence from the history books.\u201cIt\u2019s their specialty. They erase any threat to them from the history books. If you hadn\u2019t awakened your spiritual energy, you would have ended up the same as Tzenmi. Forgotten.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65 \u2013 Tzenmi\u2019s Magic (2)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u201cAnyways, about that Tzenmi guy\u2026\u201dMurakan continued to ramble on about Tzenmi. It was a story so long, it would take a thousand years just to finish telling even its summarized version.Jin\u2019s eyes sparkled as he listened to Murakan, and Gilly softly lay her eyes on Jin.\u2018At times like this, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s still a child.\u2019And so, they left the village for the Free City of Tikan.Although there was no bounty on them, they couldn\u2019t go back to the capital and use a transfer gate due to the ruckus they caused.Thus, they chose to ride a ship.After travelling on a carriage for a day, they arrived at a port and contracted with the best ship on dock. Being offered a large sum of jewels and gold, the captain prepared to set sail.\u201cI am honoured to escort you.\u201dCrewmates were called out to deck, and they didn\u2019t complain at the sight of many precious minerals.\u201cIt will take one week at most to get to Tikan.\u201dThe boat departed within an hour.On the first day, Jin trained the release of his spiritual energy with the ocean wind blowing against his chest. If there wasn\u2019t anything to do, training was the way to go.The fun part would start after Tzenmi\u2019s magic tome got fully deciphered.\u201cI wondered what light magic Tzenmi practiced. And it looks like some magic you need the most.\u201d\u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201dJin, who was resting in his room, bolted to Murakan.It was hard for him to contain his excitement. Murakan explained Tzenmi\u2019s strange magic techniques as destructive spells that made even dragons quiver in fear during their era.Among the spells within the tome were one that decomposed an opponent into light particles, a piercing spell that penetrated any shield or force field, and a spell that summoned a spirit of light.There wasn\u2019t really a spell that was better than the others.Murakan laughed at Jin\u2019s excessive curiosity. Then, with a straight face, he spoke,\u201cTzenmi called this spell Photon Cannon.\u201d\u201cPhoton Cannon! The spell that breaks down the opponent into particles of light\u2026\u201d\u201cNah. It\u2019s just a spell that instantly blinds someone. With a strong flash of light, that is.\u201d\u201cHm.\u201dJin calmed down and nodded.He then considered the effectiveness of Photon Cannon. It wasn\u2019t what he wanted, but it was definitely useful in some scenarios.\u201cIt\u2019s perfect as a distraction for attacking or escaping.\u201d\u201cWhoa, kiddo. You don\u2019t seem too disinterested.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably in the magic tome because it has good use. But I would be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t disappointed. Still, it\u2019s indeed a spell that I may need the most.\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s easy to learn too. I deciphered it an hour ago and cast it as a test\u2026 Close the door for a sec. The curtains too.\u201dSeeing the darkness in the room during a bright afternoon felt bizarre.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be cast in the darkness, but it\u2019s a light spell. I\u2019ll demonstrate, so open your eyes wide and watch carefully.\u201dSssssssss\u2014In Murakan\u2019s right hand, mana started to gather and solidify. Naturally, Jin was staring intently at the mana sphere, awaiting some bright result. However, the ball of energy was drowned in black.\u201cIt\u2019s a light spell, so why is it bla\u2014\u201dThe moment he spoke, before the mana sphere dissipated and disappeared, there was a bright white light akin to hot, glowing steel. For a split second. The instant the light exploded, Jin reflexively flinched and let out a groan.\u201cUgh!\u201dIt was because of the blinding light that filled the room.It was as if he were staring at the sun during the highest noon. The light felt like a giant needle prodding his retinas.\u2018I feel like my eyes will get swollen.\u2019Photon Cannon was unleashed for only a second, yet being exposed for such a short time was enough to make one\u2019s eyes very weary. Jin opened his eyes and saw an afterimage\u2014a giant blob floating across his vision.He really wanted to give Murakan a nice uppercut for telling him to \u2018watch carefully\u2019, but the strength of the spell gave him goosebumps.\u2018Incredible\u2026!\u2019If he could cast this spell at will during a battle, fighting a stronger opponent wouldn\u2019t be a problem.Including the scenarios where he would need to escape, the spell was useful in terms of offense and defense.\u201cFrom my knowledge, I\u2019m pretty sure this spell was Tzenmi\u2019s most prized spell. So, what do you think?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s incredible. In fact, your cast wasn\u2019t even 30% of its true power, right?\u201dJin knew without an explanation, making Murakan proud.A shoddy demonstration right after deciphering.Additionally, Murakan said that it was easy to learn, so Jin could master the spell by the end of the boat ride.\u201cWith your talent, you could master it in two days. If you absorb the magic tome for the rest of the trip, then by the time we get to Tikan, you\u2019ll have a god-tier weapon under your belt.\u201dEven if Jin finished mastering these \u2018unique spells\u2019, he would still need to absorb the magic tome to enhance his general skills and abilities.The process of absorbing a magic tome was simple. Jin just had to convert the cipher system into a rune and then cast the magic tome onto his body.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll make me deal with the rune conversion. Am I right, kiddo?\u201d\u201cMhm.\u201d\u201cHow do you expect to repay me for that kind of debt?\u201dJin immediately started to learn Photon Cannon. Murakan said it would take him two days, but mastering the theory of the spell didn\u2019t even require a day.\u2018It\u2019s the most incredible spell I\u2019ve ever seen. Such a sophisticated and simple spell, yet so powerful.\u2019However, the spell was simple for a reason. Moreover, even though all of the magicians in the world attempted the simple spell, not many were able to use it.Photon Cannon required insane levels of mana and mana control that only talented magicians had.Flash!Although the resulting light was not as brilliant as Murakan\u2019s shoddy demonstration, Jin understood the spell as soon as he tried it.He felt weak and dizzy, but he smiled in the light of success.\u2018The caster is not affected by the light coming from the spell.\u2019There was a big difference between the light emitted by the spell and the surrounding natural light. Jin could stare at the flash, but it still wouldn\u2019t affect his vision.\u201cHey, kiddo.\u201dFour days later, Murakan finished the rune conversion and asked Jin,\u201cSchugiel Hister or whatever\u2019s magic tome. I can\u2019t decipher it. I think it\u2019s just regular garbage. Wanna use it as kindling?\u201d\u201cKindling?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just pissed. This stupid-ass code\u2019s annoying me, the great Murakan.\u201dJin was about to say that it was a code from his fond memories.But instead, he just smiled.\u2018I was originally gonna decipher it myself and use it\u2026 But I\u2019ll just find my teacher and have them teach it to me instead.\u2019Jin\u2019s master spent their entire life recovering the magic spells of Hister. Although it was a relationship in his past life, Jin always felt indebted to his teacher.\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll find many great spells if we find a good decoder. I just feel it. So don\u2019t fuss over it, and just give it to Gilly.\u201d\u201cYou little brat. You could burn my precious magazines any time, but this old book\u2026\u201d\u201cSpeak some sense, O Great Black Dragon. If you\u2019re done with the rune conversion of Tzenmi\u2019s magic tome, just cast it on me.\u201dMurakan scoffed.\u201cHa! Strawberry Pie and I\u2014we\u2019re no different from slaves. Ever heard of a wicked master who got stabbed and killed by a slave?\u201d\u201cMy bad. Unfortunately, growing up as a Runcandel made me like this.\u201dMurakan began to cast the magic tome on Jin\u2019s back. The text in the magic tome began to glow and come off the pages.Murakan slowly moved the glowing text towards Jin\u2019s left shoulder blade, and the magic tome\u2019s text was printed onto Jin\u2019s back. It emitted an eerie glow\u2014like a special tattoo.\u201cDamn, I wanted to cast it on your ass, or even your di\u2014\u201d\u201cEnough with the unfunny jokes. Let\u2019s see what changed.\u201dAs soon as the text sank into Jin\u2019s skin, his understanding of Photon Cannon increased rapidly. The absorption of Tzenmi\u2019s tome seemed to have stimulated his abilities.\u2018Photon Cannon.\u2019Fwoooosh!The spell was cast, and the entire room was bathed in white. The ardent light pierced through the curtains and was seen on the deck.Thud, thud, thud, thud, thud.The captain\u2014who was surprised by the light\u2014rushed into the guest room.\u201cSir, did anything happen? There was a light\u2026!\u201dJin and Murakan looked at the captain and simultaneously denied.\u201cLight? What light?\u201d\u201cAh, it\u2019s nothing. I presume you were hallucinating.\u201dThe captain didn\u2019t need to know that they just practiced an ancient light spell.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The boat arrived in the Free City of Tikan on the 2nd of July, 1795.To show his appreciation for the satisfactory trip, Jin tipped the captain, then passed the city gates with his fake identification.

In Tikan, on the other hand, the ocean was always in view wherever they looked.It was because of the city\u2019s unique landform. The entire island had a single horn-shaped tower with ten floors.Instead of \u2018Free City\u2019, calling it a \u2018Tower\u2019 was more fitting. It was a name that held the dreams of the initial founders.\u201cYoung Master, shall we first find a place to stay?\u201dPoof!Jin almost tripped when Murakan suddenly returned to his normal form and spoke.\u201cYou won\u2019t just go to a ramshackle inn and abuse the hell out of the owner like last time, right?\u201d\u201cMurakan, you know how many people are here? Transforming in the middle of a city\u2026\u201dAlthough Tikan had a small population, the density was high. Transforming in the middle of the road was an easy way to lose anonymity.Gilly tried to add to Jin\u2019s scolding, but Murakan shook his head.\u201cHumans never pay attention to strangers. Haha, no one probably saw.\u201dThey scouted the area, and it seemed like it was the case. Everybody walked with busy footsteps, and even in an open area, no one seemed to care about the three.\u201cUhh\u2026\u201dHowever, it only \u2018seemed\u2019 as if nobody cared.\u201cA cat\u2026 turned into a man.\u201dStartled, Jin, Murakan, and Gilly turned their heads towards the voice.\u201cHow did you do that?\u201dWhile holding a small dragon plushie, a small girl stared at them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s good, sir.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not that old\u2026\u201dBeing called \u2018sir\u2019 at the age of 15 was harsh.\u201cSir is right.\u201dJin cracked an awkward smile and shrugged.They bought some ice cream for the girl with the dragon plushie. Although watching her happily eat the cold treat was cute\u2026\u2018How the hell do we deal with her?\u2019While evaluating the situation, Murakan got tense and clenched his fist.Gilly was furious\u2014her expression cold as stone. Whenever the little girl looked at her, however, she flashed a bright smile.Thankfully, it was only a little girl who witnessed Murakan\u2019s transformation.Thank goodness.\u2018What if it was a group of adults and not a little kid? The Zipfels would have put a bounty on me immediately.\u2019Murakan learned from this experience. Indeed, humans often didn\u2019t care about others\u2019 businesses, but he promised to be careful when transforming.Jin sighed as he stared at a hunched-over Murakan who was racked with guilt.\u2018Damn\u2026 As bad as it is for us, it\u2019s worse for him. After all, he was a grand black dragon who didn\u2019t need to care about people\u2019s gazes.\u2019It had been five years since he broke out of the glass coffin in the Storm Castle\u2019s underground chamber.Murakan\u2019s emotions hadn\u2019t changed even from before his slumber a thousand years ago. Although he wanted to cause mass destruction, he patiently held in his urges and matched the behaviour Jin expected of him.Excluding the several rowdy moments at the Storm Castle and Garden of Swords, the shadow dragon suppressed his emotions well.\u2018If I think about it like that, I kinda feel sorry.\u2019Jin bought more ice cream and gave it to Murakan. Without a word, Murakan received the treat and smiled. Gilly exploded into laughter.Oblivious to what was happening, the little girl grinned.\u201cThen is that guy not a cat?\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess Euria is seeing things.\u201d\u201cEuria isn\u2019t seeing things! That guy is cat. You are not cat.\u201d\u201cHaha, you like cats?\u201dJin and his companions were sitting on a bench, watching the cute kid eat ice cream. Her name was Euria.\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d\u201cEuria, do you know the way home?\u201d\u201cNo, Euria don\u2019t know.\u201dThey listened to her story and concluded that her parents lost her in the crowd, and she encountered Jin while wandering the streets.So, the three decided to find the child\u2019s parents. They didn\u2019t have any immediate objectives anyways.Twenty minutes passed, and the child\u2019s parents never showed up.\u201cYoung Master, shouldn\u2019t we take her over to the guards at a nearby garrison? Technically, we aren\u2019t obliged to solve this problem.\u201d\u201cThat would be good. Did you finish your ice cre\u2014\u201dAs soon as she heard \u2018guards\u2019, Euria frowned.\u201cI don\u2019t like there. Make mommy tired.\u201d\u201cThe garrison makes your mother tired?\u201d\u201cYa, that place make mommy very tired.\u201dAt that moment, a million thoughts went through their heads.\u2018Is she being exploited?\u2019\u2018Is her mother a criminal?\u2019There weren\u2019t many interpretations of the girl\u2019s words.After a bit of thinking, they still agreed that taking her to the guards was the best conclusion. Euria pouted then accepted her fate.\u201cWhat a nice child, Young Master. There was a time when Young Master was also\u2026 Hmmm, never mind. Haha.\u201dFinding the way to the garrison wasn\u2019t hard. Living up to its name, the Free City did not have anyone who was scared of outsiders.The garrison looked immaculate, with \u2018The Free City of Tikan Central Defense Force\u2019 written neatly on the white walls.Jin liked the presence of a central defense force. Whatever issue existed, dealing with problems at a big organization was easier.\u201cTikan Central Defense Force. How may we help you?\u201d\u201cOh, uh, this child\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s Euria. Hey, guys, bring the chief.\u201d\u201cDo you know this girl?\u201d\u201cHaha, more than just know. She\u2019s the chief\u2019s daughter.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dEuria, who apparently hated the garrison, was being treated like a princess.So that\u2019s what she meant when she said the garrison made her mother tired. The three of them smiled simultaneously.\u201cHey, kid. You dare fool the great Murakan?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t fool you, cat man.\u201d\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t a cat.\u201dClomp, clomp.A tall woman walked towards them. She looked at least 2 meters tall with broad shoulders and had a knife scar on her left eye.It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if she operated several dark organizations like Tesing, but she was wearing a military uniform. It was hard to miss the flashy \u2018chief\u2019 badge.The woman embraced Euria before picking her up.\u201cHaha, Euria. My bad, my bad. Mom remembered she had some work to do, so I rushed back and accidentally forgot about you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s okay. The people in this city know that if they mess with you, they\u2019ll go to the sky world. Or they\u2019ll never see the sky again.\u201dShe was throwing violent jokes in front of a 5-year-old, but the words were filled with love and affection.The three spectators were at a loss for words.\u201cYou guys brought Euria? My apologies. I am Tikan\u2019s Chief of Defense, Alisa Betzer.\u201dThey exchanged handshakes.\u201cTourists, I see. It seems that I was a little careless since I knew that the citizens knew Euria well.\u201d\u201cNo, no. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s a relief that she\u2019s your daughter. We were worried that it would take longer to find her parents.\u201d\u201cOh, it seems that you also ate some ice cream. Euria, make sure to thank them. Good girl. Anyways, thank you very much. How may I return the favor?\u201d\u201cIf there are any good inns nearby, it would be great if you could recommend some. We just arrived\u2026 \u201c\u201cOh, a place to stay? Hold on. Euria, what did you say?\u201dWhispers.Alisa bent over and lent her ear to Euria, who then began to whisper.Alisa thought for a moment, wrote something on a piece of paper, stamped it, and handed it to Jin. It was a simple letter.\u201cIt\u2019s an introductory letter with the Chief of Defense\u2019s seal. Wherever you go, if you show them this pass, then you will be treated with the utmost respect. The provided food will change as well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing. It will be of good use. We shall leave now.\u201dThe three left the building, and Alisa shrugged her shoulders.\u201cEuria, you really saw a cat turn into that man?\u201d\u201cMm, but they didn\u2019t want to share it. So I guess they didn\u2019t tell you.\u201dAlisa patted Euria\u2019s head.\u201cAlright, everyone has their secrets.\u201dAnd then she thought:\u2018Transformation\u2026 Only dragons can do that. And there\u2019s no way Euria is lying. I must ask Kashimir.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The power of Tikan\u2019s Chief of Defense\u2019s pass was beyond their expectations.Jin chose the most luxurious inn in the outskirts of the city. When he showed the pass to the receptionist, employees were summoned to escort them, and all kinds of services were discounted.On top of that, they were offered the most luxurious room without a reservation. Jin, Murakan, and Gilly were finally able to rest comfortably.\u201cWow. We\u2019ve only experienced this kind of treatment in Huphester. Isn\u2019t nepotism great?\u201d\u201cThe cushioned bed is great, kiddo. Our living space needs to be more like this. Our place in Akin was a pain in the ass.\u201d\u201cI have a good feeling about this place, seeing the great fortune we got as soon as we came. Oh my, the cocktails and saut\u00e9ed shrimp are delicious. Young Master, have a taste. Can we order some more?\u201d\u201cMy goodness, Gilly. No need to ask. Just order more.\u201dTheir visit felt like a vacation trip.\u2018This is new.\u2019The three have been together since their days at the Storm Castle, but it was their first time experiencing this kind of hospitality.Gilly seemed to be especially happy, for she was constantly singing and humming a tune. Seeing her indulge in the lavish goods, Jin felt pity.\u2018She likes this stuff so much. As soon as she became a fair lady, she got stuck with me. No time to play, no time for herself.\u2019He wouldn\u2019t have made Gilly go through this in his past life. In fact, he wouldn\u2019t make anybody in the clan experience this kind of abject deprivation. Even if they weren\u2019t pureblood Runcandels.Was this lifestyle truly for Gilly? Was it righteous to let her live her life from here?For a moment, he considered letting Gilly go.\u201cGilly.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master?\u201d\u201cHave you ever regretted accompanying me?\u201dGilly halted her humming and movements and stared at Jin. She knew exactly why he posed this question.\u201cNot once in my life. This kind of joy is meaningless if not spent with you, Young Master. Oh, including Lord Murakan. Though, he is definitely annoying at times.\u201d\u201cOn that note, let me ask you, Strawberry Pie. Why do you remain stuck to the Runcandels? You don\u2019t seek treasures like that Emma person, nor do you want political power.\u201dJin was thankful that Murakan joined the conversation. He didn\u2019t know how to respond to Gilly\u2019s heartwarming response.\u201cUhm\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cDid I catch onto somethin\u2019? Or do you feel indebted to the clan for life? Your dedication definitely has some ulterior motive.\u201d\u201cMay I share regarding this topic at a later time?\u201d\u201cWhen are you gonna tell us, huh? Strawberry Pie?\u201d\u201cWhen I become old and senile, perhaps?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not too far in the future. I can wait until then, but you\u2019ll have to tell us why.\u201dGilly meant that response as a joke, but Murakan took her seriously. Realistically speaking, a few decades of her life was nothing to Murakan.\u201cHaha, I guess I\u2019ll order some more shrimp.\u201dOnce Gilly left the room, Murakan called Jin over.\u201cHey, kid.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a blessed life.\u201d\u201cAgreed.\u201dNot long after leaving, Gilly returned to their quarters.However, her startled face didn\u2019t look as if she had ordered more shrimps.\u201cYoung Master, Lord Murakan, something\u2019s not right. There\u2019s not a single person in sight in the lobby.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cEmployees, and guests included, all seemed to have cleared the building. Something\u2026\u201dClunk, clunk, clunk.At that moment, dozens of footsteps resounded from the hallway, approaching their vicinity. It was definitely the sound of marching soldiers equipped with steel boots.The stomping stopped at their door. Then, a more quiet pair of footsteps approached it.A man entered the opened door.Murakan was clueless about the man\u2019s identity, but their visitor was a famous swordsman that Jin and Gilly knew.\u201cHello there.\u201dIt was Ghostblade Kashimir.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67 \u2013 Ghostblade Kashimir (2)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Meeting Kashimir was their main objective for coming to Tikan. However, they struggled to find a way to meet him.But to think that he would come straight to their doorstep. Quite the unexpected turn of events.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dNaturally, Jin stepped in front of Gilly and Murakan.Kashimir leaned on the doorway and shrugged his shoulders. It was hard to miss the scimitar on his waist. It was a curved blade that slaughtered hundreds of strong opponents before its owner was given the name \u2018Ghostblade\u2019.\u201cOh my. Did I disturb your peaceful break?\u201dMurakan\u2014who was amused by the situation\u2014smirked. Jin thought about why Kashimir came to them.\u2018There\u2019s no way he knows about our business in Akin. It seems the chief of defense leaked our general location, and the inn owner saw our pass and contacted her.\u2019But why?They just arrived in Tikan and have only been in the city for a grand total of two hours. They didn\u2019t do anything in particular\u2014just spent some quality quiet time.There was no reason for Kashimir to be interested in them.Then he remembered their encounter with Euria.\u2018Unless\u2026? What if Euria told Alisa about Murakan\u2019s transformation, and knowing that transformation is an ability only dragons have, Alisa reported it to Kashimir?\u2019Certain of the possibility, Jin began to formulate the scenarios in his head.\u2018If he was convinced by a 5-year-old who witnessed it and believes that we are dragons, it means that he\u2019s desperate. As a close acquaintance, the chief of defense probably knows this as well.\u2019It didn\u2019t seem like a horrible situation, though.\u2018The armoured knights outside don\u2019t seem to intend to threaten us. They were brought to prepare for a possible fight against a dragon. If not, there\u2019s no reason to keep them outside. They would\u2019ve come into the room if they wanted to scare us.\u2019Jin realized that Kashimir evacuated the people inside the inn for the same reason.\u2018Probably evacuated not only the inn, but the surrounding area as well. Causing a dragon\u2019s rage because of this encounter would devastate the vicinity.\u2019It didn\u2019t even take a few seconds to evaluate the situation. Their short stay in Tikan easily narrowed down all of the possibilities.At this point, Jin thought he could safely approach Kashimir. In addition to not knowing that Murakan was the dragon, he mobilized the troops outside and evacuated everyone. His preparation was immaculate.However, he made one small mistake.\u201c\u2018Oh my\u2019, my ass. You bitch. You talking like that to me? Do you know who I am?\u201cWh-what?\u201d\u201cSo fucking annoying. You think the world is so easy just because you have a cool weapon on your ass and some goons to drag around?\u201dKashimir didn\u2019t greet them\u2014more specifically, Murakan\u2014respectfully.Murakan continued to spit swears and curses, and Kashimir was startled.It was a widely known fact that dragons didn\u2019t have the greatest personalities.Kashimir should have known this, but he just nonchalantly greeted Murakan anyways. Though he was the Fallen Prince, was his attitude because he had been part of the Vermont Imperial Family?Regardless, Murakan was on the nicer side amongst the nasty dragons.\u201cWho do you think you are, messing up the nice mood. I\u2019m asking you, you mongrel. Do you know who I am? Answer me.\u201d\u201cI\u2026 don\u2019t know.\u201dKashimir\u2019s handsome profile was ruined as he answered Murakan. He seemed to be very shocked.At that moment, he was certain that Murakan was the dragon. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t stand still like a scarecrow after being brutally humiliated.\u201cOh, is there a lump of gold stuck in your throat? You\u2019re still not talking, you dumbass dog. C\u2019mere. Get your ass over here. People like you need a nice beating to get into the right mind\u2026\u201dDespite telling Kashimir to come to him, Murakan stomped towards the other man.Kashimir shivered in fear as he slowly backed away. Jin wanted to laugh at the sight.\u201cMurakan, calm down. Relax. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dJin softly stopped Murakan. The dragon then stood still, eyes fixed on Kashimir. He would\u2019ve spun the other\u2019s jaw multiple times if he hadn\u2019t been stopped.There were three reasons why Murakan was pissed.The biggest reason was because he made his poor Strawberry Pie feel threatened, and then it was a split between him disturbing their peace and lacking respect.Barely catching his breath, Kashimir cleared his throat.\u201cEhem! My apologies. It seems I was insolent. I did not intend to aggravate you, so please, I humbly request your forgiveness.\u201d\u201cSir Ghostblade Kashimir.\u201d\u201cUh, pardon me, but you know who I am?\u201d\u201cHow would I not? I\u2019ve been wanting to meet the glorious ruler of Tikan.\u201dJin\u2019s demeanor was much calmer than Murakan\u2019s. Kashimir cleared his mind and avoided Murakan\u2019s gaze.\u201cI didn\u2019t know that you would suddenly visit like this. Maybe because of a certain cat?\u201dHearing this, Kashimir regained his composure and the sharpness in his eyes. He overcame his trauma when he remembered what he originally came for.\u201cAnd your name is?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Jin Runcandel.\u201dWithout hesitation, he said his real name. Gilly\u2014who stood behind him\u2014covered her mouth. Murakan was also slightly surprised.Someone identifying as a Runcandel heir was an occasion out of their control, but revealing his own identity should\u2019ve been avoided at all costs.Of course, the one who was surprised the most was Kashimir.\u201cIf you had attended the banquet not so long ago, then I\u2019m sure we would have met beforehand. It is a pleasure to meet you, Sir Kashimir.\u201dKashimir slightly smiled.\u2018So he\u2019s Jin Runcandel\u2026 After revealing that man as the dragon, the boy just reveals himself. Was there even a case where the Runcandels and dragons got along?\u2019According to his knowledge, it was impossible. Since ancient times, dragons only formed relations with magicians who either contracted with gods or have special abilities.\u2018That frivolous man is the dragon. His speech and tone was like a back-alley thug, but the momentary pressure and threat he gave off was immense.\u2019Analyzing the crew in front of him, Kashimir naturally turned his eyes towards Gilly.\u2018And isn\u2019t that woman Gilly McRolan?\u2019Before being deemed the Fallen Prince, he had seen some of the McRolans at the Vermont Imperial Palace.Although he didn\u2019t remember Gilly precisely, he had a vivid memory of a young Gilly displaying a claw\u2019s potent power at a training academy.And there was no doubt about it. The boy in front of him was a Runcandel. Though, he couldn\u2019t understand why Jin was being accompanied by a dragon.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. Sir Kashimir, please take a seat.\u201dKashimir ordered the soldiers to clear the area. In his position, it was a dangerous move, but he acted out of pacifism to gain the favour of the dragon.Murakan, however, was still annoyed.Respecting Jin\u2019s decision, Gilly set three goblets on the table. Murakan was forced to follow the kid\u2019s agenda.Glug, glug.Jin poured some wine into Kashimir\u2019s goblet.\u201cYoung Master Jin, does your clan know of your whereabouts with a dragon? I\u2019ve never thought of a Runcandel and a dragon working together.\u201d\u201cThe clan does not know.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling me a risky secret like it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\u201cBecause you just sent your soldiers away. If things don\u2019t go as I planned, and depending on the outcome of this conversation, we can just get rid of you.\u201dKashimir assumed that Jin was joking and awkwardly laughed.\u201cI guess we didn\u2019t give Euria enough ice cream. If we knew this would happen, we would\u2019ve bought her better stuff. I guess Sir Kashimir and Alisa really trust Euria? Seeing that you acted upon the child\u2019s seemingly fake story\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd since Young Master Jin shared a clandestine secret, I will share one as well. Euria is my daughter. There is no reason for me not to trust her.\u201dKashimir looked robust, but he definitely was lacking compared to Alisa. However, picturing the two next to each other, they do look nice together\u2026\u2018No, that\u2019s not important right now.\u2019Jin nodded and continued to speak,\u201cI have never heard news of Sir Kashimir having a daughter.\u201dAs if that information wasn\u2019t enough, Kashimir added to his words.\u201cAnd my daughter contracted with Az Mil.\u201d\u201cBy Az Mil, you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, the God of Sight, Az Mil.\u201dJin finally understood why Kashimir and Alisa trusted Euria\u2019s absurd story.Anyone who contracted with the God of Sight would never be \u2018seeing things\u2019. There was no such thing as hallucinations for them.\u201cI think my secret is of equivalent weight to yours.\u201d\u2014My daughter contracted with Az Mil.Revealing such truth required a great sum of courage. Az Mil\u2019s contractor not only gained the \u2018Absolute Eye\u2019 that enables them to see the truth behind everything, but also the \u2018All-Seeing Eye\u2019 which allows them to see a vision of the future.All of the rulers and leaders in the world searched for the one who contracted with Az Mil with the hopes and greed of avoiding the uncertainty of the future.Which is why most of Az Mil\u2019s contractors were abused and taken advantage of, living the rest of their life in misery.Especially with the extremity of the Zipfels\u2019 and the Vermont Imperial Family\u2019s actions. Everyone knew that they wanted to keep the contractor by their side \u2018by all means\u2019.\u201cWait, you mongrel. If that kid is Az\u2019s contractor, then where\u2019s the dragon? I didn\u2019t sense any presence of a dragon in this city. It\u2019s well known that Az\u2019s dragons take really good care of the contractors.\u201dEngaged in the conversation, Murakan sat in a chair, which settled the mood. Combining the dragon\u2019s words with the image of Euria holding onto a dragon doll, Jin finally deduced why Kashimir came to them.\u2018For some reason, the dragon disappeared. That\u2019s why he urgently came here after hearing of another dragon\u2019s presence.\u2019Kashimir\u2019s face dimmed.\u201c\u2026Euria\u2019s guardian dragon suddenly disappeared about a year ago. I think that either the Vermont Imperial Family or the Zipfels are at fault, but it\u2019s just a hunch.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of stupid dragon would get kidnapped just like that? At least speak some sense\u2026\u201dMurakan paused, then his eyes widened.\u201cWait, it\u2019s been a year? And your daughter\u2026 is 5?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201dKashimir dropped his head, holding a hopeless and melancholic expression as he thought of the day he lost his friend and creating a doll for his daughter to commemorate them.But right now, losing an acquaintance was the least of Kashimir\u2019s concerns.\u201cThen that means your daughter is constantly looking into the future! A young contractor can\u2019t control their abilities without their dragon. Holy shit, she probably saw my transformation from a vision.\u201d\u201cPardon? Euria is constantly looking into the future?\u201d\u201cA measly human like you wouldn\u2019t understand. Witnessing the future inflicts so much mental strain\u2014even for a dragon. Right now, your daughter is so young.

    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68 \u2013 Ghostblade Kashimir (3)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Kashimir\u2019s eyes went bloodshot. Anyone would get shocked after hearing that their daughter would become bedridden for life.\u201cMurakan, what do you mean by that? That kid will become bedridden? Elaborate.\u201dJin\u2019s chest felt heavy. He felt his stomach sink at the thought of a horrible fate for a small, innocent child.\u201cYou humans think that clairvoyance is miraculous and extraordinary, but that is only one side of the coin. The moment you make a contract with Az Mil, you lose the ability to change the future.\u201dMurakan continued to explain the \u2018causation principle\u2019.\u201cIf one sees the future, they must follow it. No matter what. When you begin to act against it, Az Mil will begin to condemn you.\u201dEven though they want to alter their actions, thought processes, or decisions based upon the future, Az Mil\u2019s contractors must abide by their fate.Thus, even if they see in the future that their brother was going to get assassinated, they must not tell him or go stop the assassination.Since everyone in the room deduced the near future, the \u2018causation principle\u2019 applied to them as well. However, even though they try to change the future, Az Mil punishes the contractor regardless.\u201cIf they disobey the \u2018causation principle\u2019, the contractor will receive death as their punishment. Your daughter has been living in a different world than you and me. She\u2019s basically living a pre-planned life.\u201d\u201cI-I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019ve never heard of that before.\u201d\u201cOf course not. It isn\u2019t well known even amongst the dragons.\u201d\u201cThen about Euria\u2019s discovery of your transformation\u2026 If she was destined to meet you, what does that mean?\u201d\u201cThat it was from a prophecy. What are the chances of meeting Az Mil\u2019s contractor in a big city like this? Az Mil probably set us up to offer the helpless girl some assistance because she lost her dragon. Essentially, Az Mil is requesting help.\u201d\u201cA god is asking some humans for a favour?\u201d\u201cFor a dragon and two humans, that is. I can\u2019t exactly pinpoint Az Mil\u2019s intentions of intervention, but I\u2019m probably right. A coincidental encounter seems very improbable.\u201dKashimir, speechless, shook his head, and Jin thought about the little girl.The All-Seeing Eye that could see into the future, and the Absolute Eye that could see the truth behind everything in the world.\u2018Calling me \u2018sir\u2019\u2026 Did she see me before I regressed?\u2019Now that he thought about the possibility, goosebumps crawled all over Jin\u2019s body.\u201cEither way, we need to find the dragon and return it to her side.\u201d\u201c\u2026O Great Dragon, it is not known to the world, but I am the leader of the information broker agency, \u2018Seven-Colored Peacock\u2019. We have many skillful workers, but for the past year, we did not find any news about Euria\u2019s guardian dragon.\u201d\u201cThe Seven-Colored Peacock is yours? I can see why Az Mil is messing with our world. We came to Tikan to use the Seven-Colored Peacock\u2019s information anyways.\u201dTo Kashimir, Murakan\u2019s words were like a beam of light through a cloudy sky. Instead of just requesting for uncompensated help from a dragon, he could offer his services to successfully seal the deal.Thump!Kashimir fell to his knees and lowered his head.\u201cO Great Dragon, I humbly beg for your assistance. I will do anything for my daughter. I would even offer you the entirety of the Seven-Colored Peacock.\u201dNormally, Kashimir was a very composed man. Although he was kicked out, as a former member of the Vermont Imperial Family, his sense of pride and self-esteem were very strong.However, this was a situation in which his daughter\u2019s life was on the line. Although they were not backed with any evidence, Kashimir didn\u2019t doubt a single word uttered by the dragon, desperation filling his senses.After all, he was in the presence of a dragon and a Runcandel; they would not lie as it would soil their name.Surprised, Gilly blinked, and Jin\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cI want to help out, but I don\u2019t make the final decision.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou hafta ask this kid. Whatever we do, it\u2019s this little fella that decides everything. So, what are we gonna do, kiddo?\u201dNormally, a dragon and its god\u2019s contractor usually have a somewhat \u2018equivalent relationship\u2019, but the contractor does have command over the dragon. Essentially, the dragon has a sense of independence.No matter how close the dragon is to the contractor, the dragon does not forget its principles. Kashimir knew of this principle, and from it, he realized that Jin wasn\u2019t just any Runcandel.\u201cPlease offer your assistance, Young Master Jin.\u201d\u201cPlease stand up, Sir Kashimir. Though we\u2019ve only just met, the life of a child is on the line. Accepting the request is not a problem.\u201dJin helped Kashimir onto his feet.The man\u2019s eyes were filled with tears. Jin could feel his anxiety and frustration.\u201cSir Kashimir, I understand that you are nervous, but let us keep our calm. Starting today, we\u2019ll look for Euria\u2019s guardian dragon. There has to be a way to find it.\u201d\u201cI will be forever indebted, Young Master.\u201dThe encounter proceeded very smoothly.Jin didn\u2019t even need to reveal his masterpiece of an artifact, nor did he have the need to access the Fountain of Mana that he didn\u2019t even have. They could cooperate with Kashimir and the Seven-Colored Peacock.But it wasn\u2019t a joyful turn of events. Nobody would find joy in a quest with a little girl\u2019s life on the line.\u2018If the Seven-Colored Peacock doesn\u2019t have anything, then we have to rely on the Runcandels\u2019 or the Zipfels\u2019 intelligence.\u2019But since he was on a mission to become a provisional flag-bearer, he could not ask for help from his clan. In his current situation, he wanted to break some rules, but they wouldn\u2019t help him in any way.\u201cSir Kashimir. You said that you suspect the Zipfels or Vermont Imperial Family of kidnapping Euria\u2019s guardian dragon. What did you mean by that? You said that it was simply a gut feeling.\u201d\u201cIf the dragon died, then Euria would know, no matter what. Only the Zipfel Clan and Vermont Imperial Family are capable of kidnapping a dragon without a trace.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t wrong.Many different types of magic are needed to kidnap a dragon. For an infantry and swordsmanship-based clan like the Runcandels, committing such a crime was not impossible, but it would leave evidence of battle.\u201cThe suspected date of disappearance was August 2, 1794. According to my workers\u2019 research, the Zipfels\u2019 and Vermonts\u2019 strongest magicians left their posts that day.\u201d\u201cThe Zipfel Clan and the Vermont Imperial Family\u2026\u201dIf it\u2019s those two, whether they conclude by intuition or with the use of evidence, rescuing the dragon wouldn\u2019t be easy.Not even difficult\u2014it would be impossible. Along with the Runcandels, the Zipfels and Vermont Imperial Family made up the three strongest families, and amongst them, the Zipfel Clan was on top.\u201cI already kind of gave up rescuing my daughter\u2019s guardian dragon. And if you hadn\u2019t told me that her life was on the line, I would\u2019ve given up indefinitely.\u201d\u201cDo not fret. It\u2019s also my first time learning about the fate of Az Mil\u2019s contractors.\u201d\u201cCorrect, mortal. Self-blame won\u2019t solve anything. Hmmm, the Zipfels and an empire\u2026 Hey, kid. Is the Free City of Tikan part of the Lutero Magic Federation?\u201d\u201cNo, Tikan is a city-state\u2014just like Mamit. It\u2019s not exactly a country of some sort or a part of anything else.\u201dHowever, one key difference between Tikan and Mamit was that Tikan had vast lands. The Zipfels and Vermont Imperial Family, some other kingdoms and the Runcandels as well, of course, wanted their hands on Tikan\u2019s land.Additionally, the Vermont Imperial Family found the Fallen Prince\u2019s easily earned freedom very annoying as well.Establishing a city amongst many land-hungry empires after ten strenuous years, Kashimir and the Seven-Colored Peacock\u2019s ability to compromise was incredible.\u2018Even though he could raise a city, he couldn\u2019t save his own daughter\u2026 because the citizens themselves weren\u2019t aware that the ruler of the Free City of Tikan, Kashimir, had a daughter.\u2019Additionally, if news ever got into the limelight, rescuing Euria could largely impact the course of history.\u201cThen, I can just transform here, right?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cGonna fly to the Vermont Empire and ask some other dragons. Most of the dragons over at the Zipfels\u2019 are my enemy, so I can\u2019t ask them.\u201dAlmost 80% of the existing dragons were affiliated with the Zipfel Clan.Most of the remaining 20% were under the Vermont Imperial Family, and the rest\u2014a very small portion\u2014was associated with smaller clans or unknown contractors.\u201cYou can\u2019t just fly into the Vermont Empire because of their barrier. Getting another fake identification and passing through a transfer gate would be much easier.\u201d\u201cBarriers don\u2019t matter. If I emit a ton of energy while flying, then a few goons would notice me. So I\u2019m going somewhere I won\u2019t be detected.\u201d\u201cWhat? How?\u201d\u201cI may have just awoken from a thousand-year slumber, but when I was in my prime, there were many who were indebted to me, you know? Hopefully, I\u2019ll find one of my fellas in the outskirts of the empire. If not, it\u2019s whatever.\u201dDragons often remained active for more than thousands of years. As long as a god constantly renewed contracts, it was possible.\u201cO Dragon Lord!\u201dHaving thought of something, Kashimir exclaimed.\u201cHey, just call me by my name. Don\u2019t keep calling me like that. It\u2019s embarrassing. Am I some kind of cult leader?\u201d\u201cSir Murakan! Before you leave, I can offer you an archive of the Vermont Imperial Family\u2019s dragons. It is something that agents of the Seven-Colored Peacock are already investigating!\u201d\u201cOh, really? Then rush over there and bring it to me. I\u2019m really looking forward to our partnership. Let\u2019s hope I see a familiar name.\u201d\u201cYes, Sir. Please wait a moment!\u201d\u201cHey, hey, wait.\u201dMurakan stopped Kashimir at the door.\u201cBefore you leave, I\u2019ll tell you two things. First, starting today, your daughter will spend tiring hours. Every single day, make her play until the sun sets. Whenever she\u2019s awake, make her constantly waste time. So then she falls fast asleep.\u201d\u201cH-How long will she need to do this?\u201d\u201cUntil we find her guardian dragon. Get a clown or entertainer or something. You have to entertain her out of her mind. Whenever she gets tired, Az Mil\u2019s powers naturally become weaker.\u201dThe weaker the power, the safer Euria will be. Then there will be a higher chance she won\u2019t see her future and will not need to live by it.Although she was at an age where she could not distinguish between the present and future as well as fantasy and reality, if she sees her \u2018shocking future\u2019, then her actions will be influenced. And once she reaches that point, she will be in grave danger.However, it is possible that she could interpret the future as just one of her dreams.\u201cOh.\u201d\u201cFeed her sleeping pills, or you can cast a sleeping spell on her. But I presume you wouldn\u2019t like that. I don\u2019t like it either. Neither does the kid or Strawberry Pie or your wife\u2014even your child herself. Right?\u201d\u201cUnderstood. I will try my best to tire her through joy and entertainment. And the second?\u201d\u201cRecall the inn\u2019s chefs that you evacuated and tell them to make a lot of shrimp dishes. A substantial amount.\u201dKashimir nodded and rushed out the door.Gilly walked over to Murakan.\u201cLord Murakan, that was very nice of you.\u201d\u201cHaha, Strawberry Pie, I remembered that you couldn\u2019t get the shrimp dishes that you wanted.\u201d\u201cNo, not that. I meant when you calmly communicated with Sir Kashimir in order to alleviate his anxiety.\u201dEmbarrassed, Murakan awkwardly looked away and coughed.\u201cHis feelings don\u2019t mean anything to me anyway.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69 \u2013 Intertwining Fates (1)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Amongst the dragons currently affiliated with the Vermont Imperial Family, the Seven-Colored Peacock could identify six.Earth Dragon Labus.Earth Dragon Virtega.Earth Dragon Untiel.Golden Dragon Ziv.Azure Dragon Madurai.Silver Dragon Quikantel.After learning of their identities, Murakan let out a sigh.\u201cHah, these guys are still active.\u201dBefore he regressed, Jin had information on the three earth dragons as well as the azure and golden dragons being affiliated with the Vermont Imperial Family.However, he didn\u2019t expect the Silver Dragon Quikantel to be included.\u2018Were there people who contracted with the God of Time?\u2019Only a contractor with the God of Time can be blessed with the presence of a Silver Dragon. It was similar to how Fire Dragon Kadun accompanied Kelliark Zipfel, contractor of the God of Flames; Wind Dragon Vyuretta guarded Andrei Zipfel, contractor of the God of Wind; and Black Dragon Murakan protected Jin, contractor of the God of Shadows.In his past life, Jin was 26 when he heard about a magician who contracted with the God of Time, Olta.\u2018At the time, it had been at least half a century since anyone worthy of being Olta\u2019s contractor had been born, and it caused an uproar throughout the world\u2026 If what I heard was true, then it means that something nasty happened.\u2019And indeed, something nasty had happened.According to his memory, the contractor was a pureblood Zipfel. And a pureblood Zipfel would not be working as a magician at the Vermont Empire.Jin tried to tell Murakan this information, but the dragon opened his mouth first.\u201cAnd Quikantel? Does Olta\u2019s contractor reside in the Vermont Empire? Hey, twerp. You sure this info\u2019s accurate?\u201d\u201cYes, Murakan, Sir. The world does not know that Olta\u2019s contractor is with the Vermont Imperial Family.\u201d\u201cWhich magician clan is Quikantel\u2019s contractor from? Let me think about Olta\u2019s favourite clans\u2026 Lafun? Kainul?\u201d\u201cOh, that. It\u2019s a commoner named Enya. Apparently, she\u2019s a talented scholar at the Vermont Magic Academy. In fact, she\u2019s still attending school.\u201d\u201cA commoner! The pure-royal-blood-loving Olta contracted with her? I guess talent doesn\u2019t lie. Anyways, that\u2019s pretty funny. I can just ask Quikantel regarding the whereabouts of Az Mil\u2019s guardian dragon.\u201dJin was confused by \u2018commoner\u2019 and \u2018talented scholar\u2019.\u2018I\u2019ve never heard of the name \u2018Enya\u2019. If she was able to contract with Olta, then she potentially possesses incredible power. And since she\u2019s a student, she\u2019s about the same age or slightly older.\u2019Aside from Solderet, the other gods worshipped by magicians were the God of Flames Sheenu, and the God of Time Olta.Despite that, why didn\u2019t Enya become a famous magician? And, according to Jin\u2019s memory, why did Olta\u2019s contractor only appear half a century later?There was no need to think hard.\u2018Zipfel magicians probably got rid of Enya and formed another contract.\u2019Although he didn\u2019t have any evidence or even something as simple as a hunch, he was certain of it.Getting rid of a commoner student in a calm suburb was as easy as breathing for them.But there was no way to form another contract. Nobody knew if it was even possible, but if it were the Zipfels, they would\u2019ve found a way to do so.\u201cHm, I\u2019ve heard the rumours quite thoroughly, Sir Kashimir. The Seven-Colored Peacock\u2019s intelligence network is amazing. I didn\u2019t have the time to say so before, but I was really surprised that you were the leader of this incredible information broker agency.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to the Runcandels\u2019, Young Master Jin. Still, I would like to thank you for your compliment. Phew, I also could not say this, but I vow that I will take your words to my grave.\u201d\u201cSame here. Even after rescuing Euria, you and I will have a lot of work to do anyways.\u201d\u201cIndeed, we are now on the same boat. Even if we can\u2019t save my daughter\u2019s guardian dragon\u2026 I would never betray you, Young Master. I would assist in your work as if it were my own.\u201d\u201cI also promise to find and return the dragon.\u201dJin extended his arm and the two shook hands. Kashimir looked much calmer compared to when he first learned about his daughter\u2019s condition.They had work to do in order to save Euria.\u201cI will divert all resources of the Seven-Colored Peacock to finding the guardian dragon.\u201d\u201cGood boy. Make sure to play with the kid. I\u2019ll be leaving now.\u201d\u201cMurakan.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want, kid?\u201d\u201cI think I should go too.\u201d\u201cSure, whatever. What about Strawberry Pie\u2026 Since you have a fear of heights, you should just stay here. Also, it\u2019s a little dangerous.\u201d\u201cDangerous?\u201d\u201cMmm\u2026 Quikantel\u2019s a bitch. And we had a rough past.\u201d\u201cLady Gilly, I shall hire an escort to take you there. I\u2019ll get some talkative fellows so they can keep you from worrying about Sir Murakan or the young master.\u201d\u201cIf you can, please prepare escorts with Vermont imperial blood.\u201dAs Jin said this, Kashimir\u2019s eyes widened.Not only was the fact that he led a great information broker agency kept hidden, but also the fact that the great leaders of the Seven-Colored Peacock\u2014the Big Seven\u2014had Vermont imperial blood in their veins wasn\u2019t known to the world just yet.\u201c\u2026Damn, I underestimated the Runcandels\u2019 intelligence network. I wasn\u2019t planning on hiding it from you, though, Young Master\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Sir Kashimir.\u201dKashimir left the inn, leaving Jin\u2019s crew in the empty room.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *They flew for at least two days to a remote ocean territory near the Vermont Empire. As they approached the vast ocean at a high altitude, Murakan slowly began his descent.They arrived in the early morning, not a single boat afloat in the moonlit waters.During their journey, Jin listened to many stories about various dragons\u2019 relations from Murakan.\u201cAre you okay with that? According to your stories\u2026 I think these dragons won\u2019t be friendly towards you. If anything, they\u2019d be compelled with fear.\u201dMurakan said that the current dragons residing in the Vermont Empire got beat up by him a long time ago. It was because they encroached and flew near his mountain during his prime.[Anyone who invades my territory is welcomed with a beating. It was like that at the time.]\u201cWow, you\u2019re so cool,\u201dJin sarcastically commented.However, unlike the other five, Murakan\u2019s relationship with Quikantel was a little complicated. It was one that was littered with love as they were in a loving relationship for about five hundred years.[For humans, it would be equivalent to meeting each other for five years.]\u201cWith Quikantel? Why\u2019d you break up?\u201d[Well, just\u2026 personality difference. Alright, if I slowly emit my energy, Quikantel or the other goons will come out. I\u2019m starting.]Murakan began to emit his energy, but Jin couldn\u2019t feel anything.A special energy that only dragons could emit and identify\u2014akin to a dolphin\u2019s echolocation. It was a signal that humans could not detect.However, looking down at the ocean directly below Murakan, constant ripples of waves formed.\u2018That\u2019s cool\u2026 So this signal can really reach the empire\u2019s inner boundaries?\u2019If estimated, it would at least span about dozens of kilometers. Notifying one\u2019s presence only with this energy was very astonishing.[It\u2019s possible because I\u2019m me. Not all dragons can do this, kid.]\u201cYou\u2019re full of yourself.\u201dAn hour passed.Surprisingly, just as Murakan said, two flying figures approached them from afar. It was two earth dragons.[Labus and Untiel. As expected of the two who I beat the most. Wear your helmet.]Jin used Myulta\u2019s Rune to cover his face.They were moving so fast, the tiny specks in the distance became massive draconic figures in a second.Not fast, more so rushed, as if they were tardy for class.[Murakan~!]As they came closer, Murakan communicated in a high-and-mighty voice.[Earth Dragons Labus and Untiel. I have awoken from my slumber for some tasks\u2026 Offer your assistance.]The two dragons looked at each other, cleared their throats, and slowed the flapping of their wings.[Solderet\u2019s acquaintance, the Ruler of the Mountain. I do not know what position you are in, but now is not a good time. Please retreat from this place.][Please leave this place! I, Untiel, do not want a battle in the Vermont Empire\u2019s territory. I am glad to greet you today, but I do not wish to put my contractor in danger.]Listening to Murakan\u2019s altered speech habits along with the other dragons\u2019, Jin wanted to burst into laughter.They talked as if they were hypnotizing each other.\u2018What do they mean by \u201cget out of here\u201d?\u2019Murakan shook his head.[There is no place for me to hide under this sky. How dare you tell me to flee? Do you fear me? I\u2019m sure I have stated my business.]Murakan maintained his composure.The earth dragons lost it.[Ah! Fuck, stop! Stop! Now isn\u2019t the time. Get out! Quikantel is thirsting for your death right now!][If a fight ensues here, our contractors\u2019 empire will get destroyed! I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t come knowing that Quikantel is also here?][What dost thou mean, my old friends? You claim that the Silver Dragon of Time intends to harm me?][Oh, come on! Please, brother, I beg you. Can\u2019t you just leave?][The other dragons don\u2019t know of your awakening, right? If you don\u2019t leave, I\u2019ll tell the other drag\u2014][It seems you forgot your fear, you lowly earth dragons. Would you like to reminisce about the nightmares from a thousand years ago?]Whooooosh~!Murakan released his spirit energy, and their surroundings darkened. Just as Murakan said, the earth dragons were scared out of their minds; they couldn\u2019t even look Murakan in the eyes.As Jin watched, he found the situation very interesting while also realizing that Murakan was a great dragon in the past.However, if the other dragons were begging as they are now, maybe fleeing the area was a good idea.[Ahhhhh!][Whatever!]Just as Jin was about to get Murakan to listen to them, the two dragons split apart and began flying in opposite directions.Swoooooosh~!And from far away, causing a great wave of energy was a figure flying straight at them.Quikantel\u2019s breath.\u201cUh, hey\u2026\u201d[Hold on tight, kid.]Murakan bolted across the sky to dodge the breath. Jin turned his head and saw the wave of energy that bent space as it traveled.It was comparable to an ultimate ability from a mythical knight.Shwooooot, shooooooom.More breaths flew towards them. Murakan danced across the sky, dodging the projectiles. Jin verified the attacker\u2019s direction while holding onto Murakan\u2019s scales.\u2018Shooting breaths and closing the gap?\u2019A shiny silver dragon that blended into the night sky finally revealed itself as it flew through the clouds. Quikantel, the one who guarded the horizon of time.Crack!Quickly closing the gap, Quikantel opened her snout and snapped at Murakan\u2019s neck. Thankfully, it only skimmed his scales, but as their bodies tangled, Murakan felt that he was being overpowered.Unlike Murakan who lost his power after losing Temar, she was still in her prime.[I will disembowel you. Who do you think you are, showing your face on this land! You should\u2019ve remained asleep.][Pretty harsh for a greeting.]Murakan untangled himself and backed off.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? We have to fight that monstrous dragon?\u201d[That\u2019s why I said it might be dangerous, kid. If she gets any closer, shove Bradamante into her. Okay?]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Every time Murakan and Quikantel tackled each other, Jin felt the impact vibrate his bones.\u2018She\u2019s treating him like a mortal enemy.\u2019Quikantel\u2019s movements screamed her intention to kill Murakan. The breaths she shot were filled with murderous intent, and she kept snapping at his throat.Fwiiit!Quikantel\u2019s breath skimmed past Murakan\u2019s back. He checked his back, and there he saw Jin, dripping with cold sweat.The battle seemed one-sided with Murakan constantly being beaten up. But Murakan wasn\u2019t thinking of playing defensive the entire time.[Calm down and let\u2019s talk this out, Quikantel!]Whooooosh~!The sky filled with dark clouds.The black clouds were Murakan\u2019s spirit energy in its materialized form. Murakan flew directly into the clouds, and Quikantel let out an ear-splitting scream.Jin felt like his eardrums were going to rip. The screech that traveled through his ears rattled his brain.Just like how humans had a ranking system from 1-star to Genesis, dragons were also divided into different ranks. Amongst the active dragons, Quikantel had the combat skills of the highest rank.If Jin hadn\u2019t trained enough, he would\u2019ve fainted just from the dragon\u2019s shriek.Jin caught his breath as darkness surrounded him.\u201cI have to get my mind straight. Good thing I came along, if you died to that silver dragon, I wouldn\u2019t have heard a thing.\u201d[No way I\u2019d die. No matter how strong Quikantel is, she can\u2019t come in here. Let\u2019s take our time thinking of something. A way to persuade that fellow.]But Murakan was delusional.[You think I can\u2019t chase you in there?]Quikantel\u2019s wings caused a sharp thunderclap. Then, a massive body pierced through Murakan\u2019s spirit energy like a diver through water.[Quikantel, how did you\u2026?][It seems you still haven\u2019t realized how weak you\u2019ve become. You call this garbage \u2018energy release\u2019? Murakan, I cannot hide my disappointment.][Hmm, Quikantel. Think of our past. Why not just end it here? I merely came to ask you something.][Thinking of our past, ripping you into millions of pieces is not enough.][Well, okay. I guess it can\u2019t be helped. Come at me if you can. You were always like this. All we did was break up.]Crack!Quikantel bit Murakan\u2019s wing. Sounds of breaking and snapping echoed throughout, and Jin instinctively pulled out Bradamante.Murakan also bit Quikantel\u2019s wing. Due to them being wrapped in spirit energy, neither of the dragons fell even though they stopped flapping their wings.They suffered the same attack, but Murakan took more damage. Blood splattered from his wing while Quikantel\u2019s just had a fissure across it like cracks on glass.Jin had to swing his sword before the two dragons began to move. As soon as Murakan was bitten, the spirit energy clouds began to recede at an alarming rate.\u2018It\u2019s a tough exoskeleton that even Murakan\u2019s teeth can\u2019t pierce. My current blows won\u2019t do anything.\u2019So, Jin targeted the fissures across Quikantel\u2019s wings. It probably wasn\u2019t her weak spot, but it was better than wasting an opportune chance.Woooom!Bradamante glowed with an aura. Within the dark environment, a shining aura illuminated its surroundings.[What?!]Surprisingly, Quikantel never detected a human on Murakan\u2019s back. She only noticed at that moment that Jin was on him.Gripping his sword, Jin launched off Murakan\u2019s back like an arrow aimed towards the silver dragon\u2019s wing.A decisive strike with all his might. The sword slipped into the fissures and penetrated flesh, but Jin was not finished.\u2018Blade: Unleash.\u2019Murakan told him not to use this skill until he achieved 5-star spiritual energy release. However, now was not the time to hold back.If this attack did not inflict critical damage, then there was only one other option: breaking Orgal\u2019s Pendant and summoning Luna.Jin didn\u2019t plan on doing that, so he at least tried to use all of his cards.And above all, he did not lack the spirit energy to unleash Bradamante. Jin had been absorbing some from Murakan\u2019s spirit energy release.[Good job, kid. Now slash her wing so she can calm down!]Jin did not hear his words.The unleashing began, and just like the time he slaughtered the White Wolf Tribesman, time seemed to have stopped.All around him, the spirit energy began to whirlpool into Bradamante. More and more crackling energy entered Quikantel\u2019s wound, and the ruptures spread across her left wing.She let out a painful cry and tried to shake off the cause, but it was too late to stop Bradamante.Essentially, she let her guard down. Blinded by anger, she failed to notice the human on Murakan\u2019s back, and it was the result of ignoring a peaceful resolution.The spirit energy finished traveling through Quikantel\u2019s wing.Jin pushed his entire body weight onto the handle of the sword.Creaaaak!A high-pitched scraping sound echoed, and the spirit energy began to glow. Jin slid down Quikantel\u2019s wing and dragged the sword through it as he went, ripping the dragon\u2019s wing apart.The deeper he pushed his sword, the farther the spirit energy traveled. Since he was expending energy dozens of times beyond his power limit, the rate of energy consumption was inefficient.Not even a 7-star knight could penetrate Quikantel\u2019s wing, so there was no choice but to pour all his energy into one attack. There were bound to be some spills.The blade finished ripping through, and Murakan caught Jin as he fell with his sword.Cold sweat covered Jin\u2019s body from expending so much power. However, seeing the massive wing falling into the ocean, he felt confident with his amazing feat.A second later, Quikantel plummeted. Her other wing flapped uselessly.\u2018Did I just become a dragon slayer?\u2019The ocean swallowed her whole\u2014a massive splash symbolizing her death.\u201cPhew, urgh.\u201dJin also had to deal with the aftershock, the consequence for crossing his limits.\u2018Thankfully, there\u2019s no excruciating pain like last time. Probably means my skills have increased since then.\u2019Still, his limbs trembled before the pain rushed in. He tried to lie down on Murakan\u2019s back.[Alright, now all we need to do is to pray that Quikantel can think straight.]\u201cWhat do you mean? We\u2019re not done?\u201d[Dragons that control time don\u2019t die so easily. Like that.]Looking down onto the ocean, Jin gulped.A dark shadow resurfaced from the water. Jin then remembered the special ability of time-controlling entities.Rewind.The disconnected wing and Quikantel\u2019s body floated back into the sky. She was rewinding her time.In fact, she wasn\u2019t defenseless during this process. The space around her recreation was warped, and swinging a sword through it wouldn\u2019t really hit anything.Goosebumps ran all over Jin\u2019s body as he watched the sight before him.[This is the difference between inherent ability and magic. But don\u2019t worry. The ability is pretty broken, but it takes a disgusting amount of power to use it. Also, you\u2019ll need to act like you can keep fighting.]Quikantel\u2019s fully intact body now floated in front of them.The space around her restored to its normal state, and Quikantel began to move.Just as Murakan said, she looked very exhausted. She had short and fast breaths, and her wings seemed sluggish.They didn\u2019t want to immediately attack again.[Not attacking yet? I guess you want to talk this out.][\u2026What happened, Murakan? Is that human Solderet\u2019s contractor?][Yeah. Is your tantrum over yet? I didn\u2019t know you had so much rage left over from our breakup. Didn\u2019t we end well?][End well? You just threw me away, one-sided. Just like what I did a while ago, last time, you never gave me a chance to speak.][Is this and that the same? Whenever I said that we should live our separate ways, your eyes would roll to the back of your head, and you would attack. So why should I let you speak? I didn\u2019t cheat on you or anything. What do you want me to do about our incompatibility?!]This was a conversation between two dragons who had lived for thousands of years.Jin had to swallow his sigh.\u2018It\u2019s not like I ever expected dragons to be overflowing with courtesy and respect in the first place\u2026 but this is too human. Were the murderous attacks only because she wasn\u2019t over what happened between them thousands of years ago?\u2019The dragons tried to sort things out, but they simply repeated the same words over and over again. Their conversation never progressed.[Well, let\u2019s stop this nonsense, Quikantel. I didn\u2019t come here to fight. I came to ask you something. My ally\u2019s life is in danger.][Ha! The greedy and high-headed Murakan cares about his allies. You speak lies! How many of your own species have you killed?]As Murakan heard those last few words, his expression froze. It was a sensitive topic. Quikantel noticed her mistake and looked away.[\u2026Indeed, of the dragons I have killed, there was also your father\u2019s mortal enemy. A dragon that I knew nothing about. I killed him only because you hated him, you know? Did you want to hear that?]Murakan breathed a deep sigh and continued.[I\u2019m done, it was my fault for trying to ask you. I will solve this issue with another.][Just tell me. Damn it, just looking at you makes me emotional. I apologize for my words.][What about the part where you tried to kill me.][I had a righteous reason to do so.][Sure, buddy. Anyways\u2026 recently, Az Mil\u2019s guardian dragon went missing. You know anything? Az Mil\u2019s contractor needs them.][Missing? Are you talking about Lathry?][Oh, yeah. Lathry. I haven\u2019t heard of the name because of the generation gap.]Quikantel blankly stared at Murakan and blinked.[What an interesting topic. Wind Dragon Vyuretta took them somewhere some time ago.]Wind Dragon Vyuretta.A dragon related to Andrei Zipfel. Jin and Murakan had a bad feeling as soon as they heard his name.[Why, though?][I heard that, since the other dragons under Az Mil weren\u2019t active, Vyuretta took Lathry instead to teach them some Draconic Magic.]They finally knew the culprit behind Euria\u2019s missing dragon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71 \u2013 Intertwining Fates (3)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Quikantel slowly blinked as Murakan thoroughly explained the situation.[\u2026It certainly is a serious problem. But first, let us relocate. There is a small island a few minutes from here. Follow me.]Quikantel flew past Murakan. Before following her, Murakan talked with Jin.[Whew, we could\u2019ve died today. You okay, kiddo? I didn\u2019t think you could successfully unleash your sword.]\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any spiritual energy congestion like last time, but my entire body feels like it\u2019s gonna shatter. More than that, are you okay? Getting beat up by your ex doesn\u2019t sound really fun.\u201d[Olta\u2019s dragons know they\u2019re hotshots, so a small scratch to their pride will make them turn into monsters. I mean, I came to see her despite knowing that, so it was my fault. I mean, I knew she would get kinda mad, but not this much. The bigger man is supposed to be patient. On that note, you don\u2019t need to wait ten years to cast spells. Anyways, good thing we\u2019re making progress. As soon as we came, we found out who the kidnapper was. Vyuretta\u2026]Jin had already asked Murakan about Vyuretta at the Runcandel banquet; the day when Andrei Zipfel got kicked out.According to Murakan, Vyuretta was a little younger than him. The third strongest dragon amongst those under Melzeyer, the God of Wind.[It\u2019s possible that it doesn\u2019t only involve Vyuretta, but also the God of Wind. It\u2019s starting to smell a little fishy. Alright, let\u2019s go.]They instantly caught up to Quikantel. She slowed down to match Murakan\u2019s speed, considerate of his exhausted state. It seemed she lost her violent tendencies.They approached a no-man\u2019s island in the middle of the Vermont Empire\u2019s waters. Once they successfully landed, the two dragons changed into their human forms.Jin was startled by Quikantel\u2019s transformation. The hysterical breath-shooting dragon was gone, and there stood a beautiful woman, which was weird to him.\u201cNo one\u2019s here. It is possible, however, that other dragons can hear our conversation.\u201dShe didn\u2019t seem to trust Earth Dragons Labus and Untiel, as if not regarding them as her allies.Murakan shrugged.Quikantel remained silent for a while, staring at the black dragon. Though, it was hard to tell if it truly was just staring or glaring.Murakan couldn\u2019t ignore her gaze.\u2018Am I supposed to leave them alone, or\u2026?\u2019Before Jin had the chance to leave, Murakan broke the silence.\u201cWe didn\u2019t come here to just exchange weird glances. Tell me exactly when Vyuretta took Lathry.\u201dQuikantel bit her lower lip and sighed.\u201cOver a year ago.\u201dExactly when Kashimir said the dragon went missing.\u201cTricking Lathry about learning Draconic Magic\u2026 That\u2019s pretty nasty.\u201d\u201cBut Murakan, why do you think that Vyuretta kidnapped Lathry for malicious intent? Maybe it really is to teach them Draconic Magic.\u201d\u201cQuikantel, Az Mil\u2019s current contractor is really young. She can\u2019t control her powers.\u201d\u201cWhat? That\u2019s when it\u2019s most dangerous without a guardian dragon.\u201d\u201cVyuretta definitely knows about that. And even if he didn\u2019t, Lathry would\u2019ve told him. Doesn\u2019t matter. Tell him that Lathry will learn the Draconic stuff later and to return them to their contractor now.\u201d\u201cHm, definitely peculiar. If they didn\u2019t intend to kill Az Mil\u2019s contractor, Lathry would\u2019ve been returned ages ago.\u201dQuikantel furrowed her eyebrows.To her, the life of Az Mil\u2019s contractor was not important. After all, she had to protect Enya, not a contractor of a different god.However, Quikantel just remembered that Vyuretta showed some interest towards Enya.\u201cHow did you know that Vyuretta took Lathry?\u201d\u201cVyuretta stopped by the empire when it happened. Apparently, he was going to introduce Lathry to me, but in reality, it was to see Enya.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s Enya?\u201dMurakan played it dumb, and Quikantel, unexpectedly, revealed that she was Olta\u2019s contractor.\u201cAnyways, Vyuretta really wanted to meet Enya for some reason. Even though I rejected his requests many times, that creep keeps trying to latch on.\u201d\u201cWith your personality, you just let him latch on to ya? You calmly denied it, I see. What\u2019s this? You\u2019re scared of the Zipfels now?\u201dQuikantel sighed.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I was scared of the Zipfels. There was nothing I could do. The higher-ups of the Vermont Empire already knew that Enya was the contractor, and the information was probably already passed down to Andrei Zipfel.\u201dAnd Enya was one of Vermont Magic Academy\u2019s scholars.If Quikantel fought with Vyuretta for any reason, the academy\u2019s Zipfel thugs would do some undesirable things towards Enya.\u201c\u2026If I dealt with it my way, it\u2019s a loss for me as a guardian dragon. Anyways, hearing about Lathry, I think that Vyuretta\u2019s approach towards Enya may have some shady goal.\u201d\u201cHuh, you\u2019re one to talk. You were trying to harm my contractor a while ago.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had a human on your back. If I knew Solderet had a contractor, I wouldn\u2019t have gone that far.\u201d\u201cSure, you wouldn\u2019t.\u201dSilence.\u201cMurakan.\u201d\u201cWhat, kid?\u201d\u201cFor Enya\u2019s case, the higher-ups of the Vermont Empire already know who and where she is, but not Az Mil\u2019s contractor.\u201dJin intentionally did not mention Euria\u2019s name. He didn\u2019t trust Quikantel with such classified information.\u201cWith that in mind, how did Vyuretta approach Lathry in the first place? Seeing that Vyuretta hasn\u2019t returned Lathry yet, I\u2019m pretty sure he knew of the existence of Az Mil\u2019s contractor. On top of that, the fact that the contractor is young\u2026\u201d\u201cFor sure. Hmm\u2026 For the thousand years I was asleep, was there a spell that could detect contractors?\u201dQuikantel shook her head.\u201cThere\u2019s no way something like that could be developed, whether it was a thousand years ago or today. No one could tell who the contractor was until the contractor discovered their own powers.\u201d\u201cWe never know. Those Zipfel bastards. I don\u2019t want to admit it, but they\u2019re a pretty impressive bunch.\u201d\u201cOkay, but even if that kind of magic exists, what good would they get from finding the contractors?\u201d\u201cThey can benefit in two ways. Any contractor outside of their control is considered a threat, so they can simply eliminate them. Also, if the contractor dies, the Zipfel Clan has an opportunity to form a contract with the then-vacant god.\u201dJin answered, attracting Quikantel\u2019s attention.\u201cJust for that\u2026? Don\u2019t they already have immense national power? One or two contractors won\u2019t be of any threat.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know about dragons, but humans\u2019 thirst for power never ends. Also, if a few contractors were to get together, they would definitely be a force to be reckoned with.\u201dQuikantel had a hard time understanding the child\u2019s words. Considering that the Zipfels were a clan that was already at the top of the world, she didn\u2019t think that they needed to take drastic actions for such trivial matters.However, Murakan nodded in agreement.\u201cDefinitely a possibility. I know best about the Zipfels\u2019 greed. Let\u2019s just put it this way. First, they have a method to track down contractors. Second, if they find any non-Zipfel contractors, they\u2019ll eliminate them.\u201d\u201cHold on. Do we really need to assume that? We can just ask Vyuretta.\u201d\u201cYou serious? Stop talking bullshit, Quikantel. If you were a kidnapper, would you just spill everything? Get your shit together. From what I can see, your Enya kid might be in danger.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that Enya \u2018might be\u2019 in danger; she was definitely in danger.A few years later, Enya would be assassinated by the Zipfels, and not a single word about it would appear on the news. Instead, a new pureblood Zipfel would become Olta\u2019s contractor and be known around the world.As a regressor, Jin was certain of this theory. He remembered the different events and occurrences in his past life very clearly.\u201cI have my eyes wide open, and Enya is not in danger. Until that child fully grows, nobody can harm her.\u201d\u2018Please stop denying it, and think straight. Leaving her alone will lead to her death.\u2019These words were about to come out of Jin\u2019s mouth, but Murakan said it a little louder.\u201cQuikantel, there\u2019s nothing wrong with being very cautious. But it\u2019s impossible for you to be beside Enya 24/7 for 365 days and more. Just get the hell outta the Vermont Empire. The academy relays Enya\u2019s every move to the Zipfels.\u201d\u201cThat child has never left the empire since birth. In fact, her entire family is there. Are you telling me to change their life because of an unknown and uncertain threat?\u201d\u201cLife is only enjoyable if you\u2019re still breathing. Look, this is only a suggestion. The choice is yours anyways.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 Ms. Quikantel, please listen to what I have to say.\u201dQuikantel turned towards Jin.\u201cMurakan and I will search for Lathry. We will do whatever it takes. But if Lathry is discovered imprisoned or injured, and we tell you about it, what will you do?\u201d\u201cI would\u2026\u201dQuikantel clenched her teeth.\u201c\u2026relocate Enya.\u201d\u201cThen I would do that now. If Lathry is already imprisoned or injured as we speak, no matter how fast you are, it will be too late. I humbly request that you make a wise decision.\u201d\u201cThe kid\u2019s right, Quikantel. Move Olta\u2019s contractor and her family to a safer place. We\u2019ll determine whether Vyuretta is full of shit or not, and then we\u2019ll meet once more.\u201dQuikantel could no longer stand her ground. There wasn\u2019t a single flaw in their argument, and she was genuinely concerned about Enya\u2019s future.\u2018They are more worried for Enya\u2019s safety than I am\u2026 I have a lot to learn from them.\u2019Phew.Quikantel heaved a deep sigh and nodded.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s do that. I will assist you two.\u201d\u201cOh, no need. It\u2019s fine. We\u2019ll deal with it ourselves. Sure, my darkness got a little weaker, but you don\u2019t need to help me deal with a measly wind dragon. That Vyuretta bitch is washed up.\u201d\u201c\u2026And how will you meet him?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, how will I meet Vyuretta? Just like how I called you\u2014with my energy.\u201d\u201cAre you saying this even after knowing how many dragons are with the Zipfels? On top of that, you\u2019re going to take the Runcandel kid and head to the Zipfels\u2019 mainland?\u201dJin and Murakan faced Quikantel with a look of surprise.\u201cWhat are you startled by? The kid has an aura like that Temar runt. You think I wouldn\u2019t notice that energy?\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 Quikantel, can I entrust you with these secrets?\u201d\u201cI still hold Temar in high regard. Being with one of his successors reminds me of the old days.\u201dTemar Runcandel, Murakan, and Quikantel were close friends. When Murakan and Quikantel were together, that is.\u201cAnyways, I will call Vyuretta. He\u2019ll react to my call like a horny teenager. You guys can deal with him after that.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72 \u2013 Intertwining Fates (4)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u2018Damn, I already revealed my identity to two people ever since I arrived in Tikan.\u2019Ghostblade Kashimir and Silver Dragon Quikantel.Kashimir was already their ally, and it was likely for Quikantel to join their forces as well. Jin wondered if anyone amongst the provisional flag-bearers revealed their identity openly, but at this point, he didn\u2019t care.\u2018Who cares if I break some rules? I\u2019m already behind on training anyways. I\u2019m living this life however I want.\u2019Each time Jin broke his clan\u2019s rules, he felt refreshing pleasure from the delinquency.Then, Jin formally introduced himself to Quikantel.\u201cHm, so you\u2019re\u00a0that\u00a0Jin Runcandel. I already expected it when I felt Temar\u2019s aura, but still\u2026 very fascinating.\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re the more fascinating one. The Silver Dragon of Time. I\u2019ve heard of rumours, but I was speechless when I witnessed you turning back your time.\u201d\u201cNot something I want to hear from the child who slit my wing. Hm, I\u2019m saying that you\u2019re interesting because Enya often talked about you.\u201d\u201cOlta\u2019s contractor spoke of me?\u201d\u201cYes. Not so long ago, every single press in the world couldn\u2019t stop talking about your 5-star acquisition. Enya read about it and told me multiple times that, even though you\u2019re both 15, she admires you because you\u2019re very talented.\u201d\u201cHaha, there\u2019s nothing to admire\u2026 It\u2019s a little embarrassing since I\u2019ve never even met her before. I\u2019m sure she has incredible potential within her as a contractor.\u201d\u201cYeah, Quikantel. Very awkward of you to put Jin on top of a pedestal. You gonna take responsibility for his heightened ego?\u201dJin and Quikantel naturally ignored Murakan\u2019s interruption and continued their conversation.\u201cIf that kid sees you, she would be very elated. Why don\u2019t you visit the Vermont Empire before you set out for Vyuretta?\u201dQuikantel said that it would take about a week to summon the wind dragon.It would\u2019ve been great if they could immediately meet and beat Vyuretta, but the wind dragon was with the Zipfels\u2019 second-in-command. Basically, not an entity that was easy to meet.\u201cEnya will also need time to get things sorted out, and it would be nice to have you explain to her why she must leave the empire. Since you\u2019re the man of her dreams, maybe it\u2019ll be easier for her to understand.\u201dJin nodded.Persuading Enya was an ulterior motive. After all, staying in the Vermont Empire to meet Vyuretta was convenient.The reason being the location of their rendezvous, the place they were standing on\u2014the uninhabited island.At this location, even if a big fight broke out, no problems would arise from it. Just like how Jin and Murakan were not interrupted while fighting Quikantel.\u201cThen, Ms. Quikantel. Where would be a good place to stay in the empire? I believe that the capital is too crowded to maintain our secrecy.\u201dThe Vermont Empire was not small like Akin. There were probably people who could recognize Jin in the streets. People like low-ranked nobles and the Dragon King Knights resided there. It would be too risky.\u201cOh, you can stay at my place. We have a lot of empty rooms.\u201d\u201cHey, hey! Wait. Your house? It\u2019s okay if it\u2019s a small place, so just buy us a remote residence. I\u2019ll repay you later. Isn\u2019t it weird to share a roof when we, you know, broke up?\u201d\u201cStop acting hysterical, Murakan. I merely proposed this to help you with your little business.\u201d\u201cHuh?! Hysterical? What about you?\u201d\u201cIt would be great if we forget past events. Let\u2019s make sure to distinguish work and personal matters.\u201dThough it was baffling, there was no point in talking.

It was a house she built when she became Enya\u2019s guardian dragon.Built with logs, it had a very clean and cool facade. A nice, refreshing smell of wood lightly surrounded their bodies.\u201cWait for a moment. I\u2019ll be out after cleaning a little bit.\u201d\u201cTake your time.\u201dAlthough they were dragons, was she really conscious about showing a dirty room to her ex? Quikantel went in first, and Jin shrugged.\u201cHow does it feel to ally with your old love interest, Murakan?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Don\u2019t even remind me. I feel a little uneasy inside.\u201dMurakan could not take his eyes off the log cabin.\u2018That bitch\u2026 She built the exact same house from a thousand years ago. So this is why she wanted to bring us here.\u2019Yet, despite being faced with the house of their past, Murakan didn\u2019t feel his burnt-out love rekindle.His uneasiness stemmed from reminiscing about their nostalgic past.A thousand years ago, partying all the time with Temar and Quikantel in a log cabin with the same design.One passed without leaving a grave. And the other became a past lover. As he remembered the good old days, bitterness filled his heart.\u201cYou can come in now.\u201dAs soon as he entered, Jin unintentionally smirked.\u2018This is \u201cclean\u201d? Quikantel seems to have an unexpectedly clumsy side to her.\u2019It looked like the room was hastily cleaned, but around the house, there were clothes and empty bottles lying on the floor.\u201cAnything to drink?\u201d\u201cJust some cold water, thank you.\u201d\u201cYou, Murakan?\u201d\u201cToss me a few bottles of wine. God damn it, this is why I didn\u2019t want to come here.\u201d\u201cYou came here first and disturbed my peace. And I really don\u2019t have any other intentions, so if you really don\u2019t like it, then get the hell out.\u201d\u201cWhatever.\u201dMurakan murmured some complaints as he tossed himself on the living room sofa.Before Quikantel could bring over the water and wine to her guests, Murakan was suddenly sound asleep, snoring loudly.\u201cWhat the\u2026 Murakan? Asleep? How do you just sleep like that?\u201d\u201c\u2026Probably because of our fight. He was bitten all over, after all. I used a lot of spirit energy myself, which explains my exhaustion.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I see. I didn\u2019t know because you seemed fine a moment ago.\u201dPOP!Quikantel popped the cork off the wine bottle that was originally for Murakan and poured some wine into her own glass.\u201cJin Runcandel.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m assisting you due to my allegiance with Temar as well as for Enya\u2019s safety, but the main reason is that sleeping bastard.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dJin didn\u2019t have anything to say. He could only imagine how deep her lingering feelings were for Murakan.But the words that followed were completely different.\u201cThat fool doesn\u2019t really know how weak he has become.\u201dWhen he was in his prime, Murakan was the strongest of the strongest. Even the fire dragons, who were born for combat, tried to avoid him at all costs.In fact, other dragons had subservient relationships with their gods, but Murakan had an equal relationship with Solderet, hence he was special.Unfortunately, this was no longer the case. Thanks to Jin, Murakan was recovering some of his spiritual energy, but he was still incomparably weaker than his past self.\u201cCurrently, Murakan can\u2019t fight Vyuretta. With respect to his pride, I didn\u2019t mention it a moment ago. But when the time comes for them to fight, I will fight in lieu of him.\u201d\u201cIs Vyuretta that strong?\u201d\u201cKind of, but it\u2019s more because Murakan is significantly weaker. My murderous rampage earlier would simply be a child\u2019s tantrum for the Murakan from a thousand years ago.\u201dQuikantel drained her goblet into her mouth.She looked discontent as she poured herself another.\u201cI\u2019m saying this so you\u2019d know. If I told this to Murakan, he would strongly deny my help.\u201dJin calmly nodded.\u2018She was crazy at first sight, but it\u2019s relieving to see this side of her.\u2019Zzzzzzzz, zzzzzzzzz.Murakan\u2019s snoring echoed throughout the room.\u201cJin Runcandel. What will you do after you confirm whether or not Vyuretta kidnapped Lathry? If I help you capture or kill Vyuretta, the Zipfels will take action.\u201d\u201cWell, I am a Runcandel\u2026 Having disputes with the Zipfels is pretty natural.\u201d\u201cAn interesting response. I can assume you didn\u2019t think this through yet?\u201d\u201cNot that I\u2019ve never thought about it. However, I don\u2019t have anything fully planned, so you\u2019re not wrong. Either way, the first thing to do is to save Az Mil\u2019s contractor.\u201d\u201cIt seems you are very close to Az Mil\u2019s contractor.\u201d\u201cNot really. We only met two days ago.\u201dQuikantel\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI mean, I can\u2019t just watch a kid shrivel up and die. Az Mil\u2019s contractor is a child named Euria, and she\u2019s only 5 years old.\u201d\u201cSo for a child you only met two days ago, you\u2019re planning to risk your life and fight Vyuretta? And as a provisional flag-bearer, rouse the entire Zipfel Clan?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 truly, the return of Temar. Each action and intent of yours is analogous to his fervour. Very interesting.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve noticed it earlier, but it seems you were very close to the first patriarch.\u201d\u201c\u2018Close\u2019 is an understatement. Temar was a friend I would\u2019ve given up everything for. Together with Murakan, we had a hell of a time in the past.\u201d\u201cThen why did Murakan go into a thousand-year slumber after losing to the first patriarch?\u201dA question Jin often pondered about. He asked Murakan a few times, but he never heard a real answer from him.\u201cIt\u2019ll be better if you heard directly from Murakan. He\u2019ll tell you when the time comes.\u201dIt must be a meaningful story.Jin understood the situation and simply nodded. There was no reason to hear the story as of this moment.Naturally, silence ensued. Soon after, footsteps could be heard from outside the cabin.Creak.The front door opened, and a girl peered inside.\u201cMs. Quikantel, I\u2019m\u2026 home? Who might these men be?\u201dIt was Enya, who immediately bowed to Jin. She didn\u2019t know who he was, but she had a hunch that he was someone important.\u201cCome sit here, Enya. This is Jin Runcandel, and that sleeping scoundrel is a dragon. An old friend.\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Mr. Jin Runcandel. It is nice to mee\u2014Jin Runcandel?!\u201dEnya\u2019s eyes grew and ran up to Jin. Her face flushed red.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m a big fan! Lord Jin! It is an honour to be in your presence!\u201dQuikantel smacked her forehead, and Jin could only offer an awkward smile.\u201c\u2026Enya, how about we maintain your dignity as a contractor?\u201d\u201cOopsie\u2026 My apologies, Ms. Quikantel. But it\u2019s Lord Jin. Is he the real Jin Runcandel? Oh heavens, my goodness! Oh god! Lord Jin is in front of my eyes! Aaaaah!\u201dEnya\u2019s dream came true in the presence of Jin.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73 \u2013 Intertwining Fates (5)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Whooooaaaa~!Excited out of her mind, Enya bellowed and beat her chest like a beastly primate. Her uproar surprised Jin, making him step backwards. The girl\u2019s guardian dragon sighed.Snatch!Enya grabbed Jin\u2019s two hands and bowed. With her head inches away from hitting the ground, it looked like prostration.\u201cIt\u2019s a great pleasure to meet you, Lord Jin! I\u2019m Enya!\u201d\u201cOh, mhm\u2026 Nice to meet you too, Enya.\u201d\u201cKyaaaaa~!\u201d\u2018Seriously.\u2019Jin had never seen a situation like this in his entire life. Even the all-great-and-powerful Beradin Zipfel wouldn\u2019t get this much admiration from a single admirer.\u2018Is this what \u201cadmiration\u201d means?\u2019It was akin to a follower meeting their god. Frankly, Enya\u2014who was still crouched on the ground\u2014began to mumble some prayers.Jin\u2019s chest was about to burst from embarrassment.A girl with dreams of meeting a \u2018deity\u2019, something that Jin will never truly understand. Probably because he never experienced such excitement.\u201c\u2026It wasn\u2019t this bad when she became Olta\u2019s contractor.\u201dQuikantel sighed once more.When the God of Time chose her, all Enya said was \u2018Whoa.\u2019 And now she was jumping around like an excited dog, which disappointed Quikantel.\u2018This is why I told Lord Olta about royal blood!\u2019A sight without any composure or self-control!This was why Olta and the silver dragons prioritized blood class. A contractor of a god should at least be civilized.But what could they do?In the present, no human was more friendly and approachable than Enya, so they forced themselves to make a contract with her. Due to the irrevocable contract, Quikantel had to love and take care of Enya.Because that was the duty of a guardian dragon.\u201cAhem, Enya. That\u2019s enough.\u201dQuikantel tried to alleviate Enya\u2019s enthusiasm. Quikantel lightly pressed Enya\u2019s forehead, and finally, the girl calmed down.Of course, her sparkling silver eyes never stopped staring at Jin.The young Runcandel chuckled to himself.\u2018I wonder what Murakan would say to her.\u2019\u201cOh, I must\u2019ve gotten too excited. Seeing the real Jin Runcandel in the flesh and not in something released by the press really got me going\u2026 I\u2019m sorry!\u201dEnya bowed once more in apology.A girl with a severely sociable and lively personality\u2014that\u2019s what Jin thought of her.\u201cNo need to apologize, Enya. I just don\u2019t know how to react to the celebratory welcome.\u201d\u201cKyaaaa! Would you like some more?\u201d\u201cThat would be enough.\u201d\u201cMs. Quikantel! Ms. Quikantel! Can you please tell me now? The reason why Lord Jin came to our place? Did Olta respond to my prayers?\u201d\u201cYou pray to Olta nightly?\u201d\u201cObviously, I prayed to meet Lord Jin someday. Heehee. Anyways, today is such a great day! I was so tired at the academy.\u201dQuikantel\u2019s face darkened. She knew how often Enya was discriminated against by the other students and staff.\u2018I can\u2019t slaughter all of those bastards either\u2026\u2019Quikantel ground her teeth as she thought of the noble scum bullying Enya. If they physically abused her, she would kill them all. But all they did was treat Enya as if she didn\u2019t exist.Jin looked at Quikantel and felt sympathy for her pain. He knew how the academy\u2019s nobility acted in the presence of a commoner. He nodded.\u2018They would do all kinds of bad things just because she\u2019s a commoner. This is why I didn\u2019t talk to magicians from the academy.\u2019During Jin\u2019s learning days, he encountered all kinds of magicians from the academy. To this day, he never met a group of people he hated more than them.Moving on.It was time to pull Enya out of the discriminatory shithole. As a Runcandel, Jin couldn\u2019t specifically help her, but their elaborate plan for relocation would be just enough.\u2018I just need to persuade Enya to immigrate her entire family to Tikan. And as for magic, I can just find an excellent teacher.\u2019Overall, the Free City of Tikan had a carefree and welcoming community. Additionally, Kashimir would take care of her, so she would experience the most extravagant life.If she could just forfeit her homeland, then it would be a great opportunity.\u201cMiss Enya, the goal of my visit is to ensure your safety and take you somewhere safer.\u201dHe straightforwardly stated the truth.It didn\u2019t take long for him to realize that his phrasing could be misunderstood. As soon as she heard what Jin said, Enya felt like the main character in a novel.\u201cTo\u2026 take me\u2026 To. Take. Meeeeee!\u201dHis words caused another chaotic mess. Enya started punching the air like a hallucinating patient, and her eyes were bloodshot.\u201cI go\u2014 I\u2019ll go! Wherever it is, I\u2019ll go! All hail Olta!\u201dThock!Tired of the sight, Quikantel lightly hit the back of Enya\u2019s neck. Enya\u2019s body shook, then fell to the ground as she fainted. Jin chuckled at the funny sight.\u201cMy goodness. How did she become Olta\u2019s contractor?\u201d\u201cWell, a child has got to be a child. You\u2019re a child as well. Phew, there\u2019s no need to persuade her. She would even follow you to the Runcandel underground prison.\u201d\u201cWe do not retain an underground prison in our clan, Ms. Quikantel.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s gone? It should still be there. And probably has some dragons locked up.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not important, so forget it. Okay, listen. Enya will wake up exactly ten seconds from now. Once she does, make sure to choose your words carefully, and explain the current situation to her.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hit her pretty hard? Not even a trained knight can survive that blow.\u201dRustle.Ten seconds hadn\u2019t even passed, yet Enya started coming to. Goosebumps traversed Jin\u2019s body. Modern physiology and medicine could not explain the phenomenon before him.It was the will of a fanatic.Still, the strike definitely had some effect. Enya seemed to have lost some of her overflowing energy.She was also at a loss for words.\u201cLooooooord Jiiiiin.\u201d\u201cMiss Enya, I will slowly explain the current situation.\u201dEnya nodded. Jin then began from Euria and her predicament, all the way to the speculations regarding Vyuretta and the Zipfels.He couldn\u2019t say anything from his past life, but thankfully, Enya easily digested all of the content.\u201cMhm, since they\u2019re the words of Lord Jin, I\u2019ll trust every single one. It\u2019s so romantic! Dragons, conflict, adventure, a boy and a girl! And Lord Jin!\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine as long as it\u2019s for the benefit of me. Anyways, I must leave the Vermont Empire with my family and head to Tikan?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201d\u201cAnd when should we leave?\u201d\u201cThe sooner the better. Ms. Quikantel and I have some business in the empire, so it\u2019s a good idea for you to leave first.\u201dOfficially leaving the academy and clearing out the area was not a good idea.The Vermont Imperial Family will not let Olta\u2019s contractor go so easily, and the moment they notice her intention to leave, they will chain her down at all costs\u2014whether it be by capturing her family as hostage or using drugs to prevent her from leaving. The Vermont Special Forces would also be assigned to monitor them.Before that happens, secretly leaving was the most optimal choice. There would be a search and chase, but it would start in the Lutero Magic Federation instead of Tikan.Though, it doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no danger at all.\u2018It depends how much the Vermont Imperial Family cares about Olta\u2019s contractor.\u2019As Jin saw it, the Vermont Imperial Family didn\u2019t really care about Enya. If they did care, then Enya wouldn\u2019t be wearing ragged clothes.\u2018Either they\u2019re being cautious of the Zipfels or they can\u2019t give her special care because the world simply doesn\u2019t know about her yet. She isn\u2019t even being escorted by anyone.\u2019If the problem was the latter, then she would at least have some bodyguards around her at all times.Even though she was a contractor, she couldn\u2019t receive special aid because of her social class. In the eyes of the rich and privileged, a poor contractor was only a nuisance.Essentially, the Zipfels enforced their ideal through the working staff\u2014to never aid the worthless commoner.\u201cSo as soon as possible. I understand, milord. I will get my family ready by tomorrow.\u201dEnya\u2019s entire family was just her 7-year-old brother and an old dog named Pupi.\u201cBut Jin, how are you going to transport her? You can\u2019t go through the gate, and I can\u2019t take her there myself. Everything will be put on record, so the threat of a chase is likely.\u201dIt would be the same if they were to fly with Murakan.However, Jin already thought of a way.\u201cMerchant ships from Tikan periodically dock in the capital\u2019s port. Just sneak on one of them.\u201dThe Seven-Colored Peacock agents in the Vermont Empire all worked around that docking schedule. Although the empire knew the sailors worked for the intelligence agency, they couldn\u2019t do anything because the organization had valuable information about the empire\u2019s corrupt government and high-ranking officials.Aside from the agents that had a hold of sensitive information, lower-ranked agents could travel in and out of the Vermont Empire freely.\u201cAfter Enya leaves, I will proceed with a normal life and try to find an opportunity to meet Vyuretta. As for the academy, I\u2019ll say that Enya is sick.\u201dThe rich and nobility wouldn\u2019t give a damn about Enya\u2019s attendance. They would rather have her never come in for the rest of her life.\u201cYes, we can wrap things up with Vyuretta and return to Tikan. I hope we can resolve issues without fighting\u2026 but a battle is imminent.\u201d\u201cAs mentioned before, Vyuretta is mine. That sleeping dog shouldn\u2019t fight him.\u201dWrapping up their conversation, Jin and Quikantel simultaneously looked at the front door.They could hear pairs of footsteps getting louder from the front yard. Then\u2026Knock, knock.One of the owners of the footsteps knocked on the door.\u201cAnyone home? We came to ask for some kindling.\u201dThere\u2019s no way someone would come all the way to their remote location for some firewood.They were either the Special Forces or the Imperial Guard that came to check up on them.\u201cComing all the way here for some kindling? How absurd. Please wait a moment.\u201dAnd surprisingly, Quikantel didn\u2019t even doubt the uninvited guests.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74 \u2013 Intertwining Fates (6)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u201cWait, Ms. Quikantel.\u201d\u201cHm?\u201d\u201cDo you really think those people outside are neighbours who came for some firewood? I think they\u2019re from the Special Forces.\u201dQuikantel was definitely very strong, but because of her strength, she didn\u2019t even have a single ounce of caution.\u2018Considering all the things she had done and Enya\u2019s assassination in my past life, Quikantel is not suited to be a guardian. At least, in her current situation.\u2019\u201cVermont Special Forces\u2026 I\u2019ve heard of them before, but why would they\u2026?\u201dKnock-knock-knock-knock-knock.The people outside\u2014speculated to be the Special Forces\u2014rapped on the door once more. Quikantel looked confused as she tried to interpret the situation.\u201cProbably because of Enya. I think they were supervising this area. And when they saw you bringing some outsiders, they came to check on you.\u201dIt could be a far-fetched assumption, but who in the world would come to a remote log cabin in the middle of a forest to get some firewood?Moreover, there was no negative consequence in encountering them with caution.\u201cIf you\u2019re right about those guys being the Special Forces, hiding from them would elicit more suspicion. I\u2019ll observe them, and when they seem a little suspicious, I will immediately disable and capture them.\u201d\u201cCapture? Do we really need to do that? Isn\u2019t it better to just make an excuse and have them go on their way?\u201d\u201cNo. If they\u2019re trying to supervise me, I can\u2019t let that slide. Violating my privacy is unforgivable.\u201dQuikantel trotted to the door.Meanwhile, Jin dragged Murakan to a room and activated Myulta\u2019s Rune, and Enya watched in awe.\u2018Damn\u2026 Nothing is normal in Quikantel\u2019s and Enya\u2019s lives\u2026\u2019Creeaaaaak.Quikantel opened the door and was greeted by two big men. They wore oversized shirts and straw hats, and their lower bodies were well-built.\u201cSpeak the truth. You runts are part of the Special Forces, right?\u201dThe two men shook their heads at Quikantel\u2019s aggressive query.\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cWe apologize for the unexpected inconvenience. We are farmers from down the forest, and we were out of kindling\u2026\u201dHearing all of this, Jin thought to himself.\u2018Those guys will have to face severe reprimand and write a dozen pages of apologies for their incompetence once they return to headquarters.\u2019The Special Forces needed to carry out their tasks smoothly while in a disguise that suited the time and place.On that note, the soldiers at the door were a pair of bums. It made no sense that they came for firewood when there\u2019s wood all around them. Moreover, they had a shoddy disguise.They were probably the lowest of the low, newly recruited newbies from the Special Forces.\u2018I can see how easily the Vermont Imperial Family can supervise Enya and Quikantel. But isn\u2019t this too effortless\u2026? Are those guys even from the Special Forces?\u2019Pow! Thwack!Before Jin could even complete his thoughts, solid striking sounds could be heard from outside the room.It was from Quikantel beating the crap out of the guests.\u201cI\u2019m sure I told you to tell the truth. And yet, you dared to lie\u2026\u201dPeering out, Jin saw Quikantel brutally abusing the visitors. By the first strike, they couldn\u2019t even resist and fell to the ground.\u201cKuheok!\u201d\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re spilling your dirty blood?\u201dViolent beatings ensued, and Quikantel dragged two flimsy corpses by the head into the living room. The two men looked pitiful.\u201cSince when have you been watching me?\u201d\u201cW-We are not with the Special Forces!\u201d\u201cWhat? Who sent you, then?\u201d\u201cI did.\u201dThe voice of another man resounded. And surprisingly, it came from inside the house.Additionally, its source was right next to Jin.\u2018What?! I didn\u2019t even detect his aura\u2026!\u2019Jin flinched and inched away from the man.The intruder wore a red mask and a skin-tight blue suit\u2014the uniform of the Vermont Special Forces. According to his knowledge, Jin knew that only important leaders wore red face coverings.Quikantel\u2014who was slightly startled by the occurrence\u2014released the two men\u2019s collars.\u201cOhhh, so you\u00a0are\u00a0in the Special Forces. You sent these goons to sneak into my house?\u201d\u201cYou guys are dismissed.\u201dThe two men who \u201cwanted kindling\u201d scrambled away.Quikantel was about to flick a magic arrow to their backsides, but the masked man opened his mouth.\u201cKilling them would complicate the situation. Other soldiers will be summoned to this location.\u201d\u201cOh yeah? Why don\u2019t we complicate things, then?\u201d\u201cIf you really want to, then I will not stop you.\u201dQuikantel paused, then lowered her hand.\u201cYeah, if I\u2019m going to kill a human, it better be you. Not those guys.\u201dThe man didn\u2019t seem to show any fear in the presence of Quikantel\u2019s fury.It was obvious. At first glance, Jin knew this man was at least an 8-star. Quikantel knew this as well.\u2018Now that I think about it, that scimitar\u2026 I\u2019ve heard about it multiple times in my past life.\u2019Only one person wielded a scimitar in the Vermont Special Forces.Codenamed Wratch, the Special Forces 3rd Division Leader. As Vermont Emperor\u2019s most trusted person, he was well known in the Runcandel Clan as \u2018the guy with good swordsmanship\u2019.Essentially, he was a swordsman that even the Runcandels acknowledged. There was no need to doubt his skills.\u2018Good thing I used Myulta\u2019s Rune to cover my face. That was close.\u2019Wratch slightly lowered his head towards Quikantel.\u201cI apologize if we offended you. I had to identify the guests you brought into our lands. Since I have identified them, I shall depart.\u201dWratch didn\u2019t even ask who Jin and Murakan were, and even if he did ask, Quikantel wouldn\u2019t tell him. Looking up their citizenship and identification would be easier.\u201cI don\u2019t think you can end this with just an apology for stalking me. And who said you could leave already?\u201dQuikantel threw a punch.Wratch didn\u2019t even flinch, nor did he dodge. His face received the full blow, yet he remained still like a statue\u2014unscathed.\u201cI see how it is, you\u2019re something. Pretty useful for a human. You relied on your toughness to act like a fool around me?\u201d\u201cIf your anger has been alleviated through that, I think you should stop.\u201d\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t?\u201d\u201cThen I, as well, will attack. My mission is in no way related to ensuring Enya\u2019s safety should anything happen.\u201dWratch slowly shifted his eyes towards Enya. With eyes glittering with curiosity, Enya met his cold eyes. The man\u2019s frigid glare froze her in place.It was a threat. If they were to fight, he didn\u2019t know about Quikantel, but he could definitely take care of Enya. And since he didn\u2019t want to fight, it was a compromise for his departure.That was a pretty smart move by him. It didn\u2019t matter how angry Quikantel was, as long as Enya\u2019s life was on the line.No matter how strong Wratch was, it probably was impossible for him to defeat Quikantel in a duel. However, fighting in such a cramped space could possibly endanger Enya.Things would be different if Murakan was awake. Thankfully, without him, the conflict slowly and quietly resolved itself.\u201cAlright, then. I will see you next time.\u201dWratch walked past Quikantel and through the doorway. The moment he stepped outside, he vanished.\u201cThat piece of\u2026\u201dQuikantel threw a tantrum. Aside from the fact that she had been stalked by the Vermont Imperial Family, she also felt like she had been played.\u201cI\u2019m a dumbass for keeping Enya in this hellhole.\u201dQuikantel sighed.\u201cJin Runcandel. If I hadn\u2019t met you and Murakan, I can\u2019t imagine the horrible fate that Enya would\u2019ve faced. Not just Enya, they were watching me too\u2026!\u201dEnya remained shocked\u2014eyes widened and face frozen.\u201cTh-That person\u2026 w-was very scary.\u201dReceiving a look filled with murderous intent from an 8-star knight was a different level from the bullying she received at the magic academy.\u201cMy brother! I must go get my brother. Lord Jin, let\u2019s leave now\u2026!\u201d\u201cPlease go with Ms. Quikantel. You should board the Tikan merchant ship first thing tomorrow morning.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Her luggage was a small bundle of items.No different than the items in her school bag, it was all of the things she needed to leave the Vermont Empire.With the bundle on her back, she tightly held her brother, Pinte, by the hand and tucked her dog to her chest with the other.Her eyes were filled with fear.\u201cUhhhhh, milord? Are we really not going to get caught? I was super scared after seeing that man that I couldn\u2019t even sleep\u2026\u201dAll Jin could do was offer her some words of relief.\u201cEven if we get caught, I will promise that you and your family will be safe. Trust me. Either way, getting out of here as soon as possible would be our safest bet.\u201dStill, Jin safely assumed that the Vermont Special Forces didn\u2019t monitor Enya in close quarters. Despite Quikantel\u2019s carelessness, it wasn\u2019t enough to miss stalkers within her vicinity.\u2018Before Wratch came in, even Murakan didn\u2019t detect anything. We were probably found out when we flew through the empire\u2019s barrier while on Ms. Quikantel\u2019s back. And it\u2019s likely that the Vermont Special Forces were dispatched afterwards.\u2019Additionally, with yesterday\u2019s incident, the Vermont Imperial Family probably knows that Quikantel was pissed. They wouldn\u2019t get anything good out of aggravating her even further.And they would never expect Enya to sneak out of the empire immediately. They would assume her absence at the academy to be caused by mental shock.\u201cNo need to worry, and board the ship. Beyond all this, Ms. Quikantel probably can\u2019t imagine you traveling alone as she stays in her cabin. And this cat\u2014I mean, Murakan will protect you.\u201dSince Jin couldn\u2019t expose himself, he couldn\u2019t escort Enya to the merchant ship.Just in case, he had Murakan turn into a cat and protect Enya. If the Special Forces were to notice Enya\u2019s escape, Murakan could stop their attacks.The main street led straight to the port anyways, so Jin was sure that being spotted would be unlikely.In a street filled with thousands of people, pinpointing Enya\u2019s family\u2019s exact location would be impossible without closely stalking her.\u201cMilord\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He is the Great Black Dragon. I will see you in Tikan soon, Miss Enya. And Pinte.\u201dEnya bit her lips and bowed. She then left the remote log cabin and headed to the heart of the capital. No different than her daily walk to the academy.This time, however, she wouldn\u2019t be going to the magic academy, and Pinte wouldn\u2019t be going to his preschool.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 \u2013 Intertwining Fates (7)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u2018I would\u2019ve died if I wasn\u2019t careful.\u2019Wratch\u2014who escaped the remote log cabin\u2014felt relief despite only showing a straight face. His demeanor was born from hours and hours of strict facial expression and emotion suppression training necessary to become a Vermont Special Forces Division Leader.Quikantel probably displayed inconceivable power to him, but he didn\u2019t really feel fear. After all, to the Vermont Special Forces, death was considered only a small inconvenience when it came to executing missions.\u2018But who were those two guys in the house? The man with long hair was probably Quikantel\u2019s lover, and the boy with the strange artifact covering his face\u2026 Maybe she\u2019s hiding her children?\u2019He would\u2019ve never imagined that they were Jin Runcandel and Murkan\u2014the black dragon who woke from a thousand-year slumber.Either way, Wratch completely misunderstood the relationship between Quikantel and the two mysterious people. He had a feeling that it wouldn\u2019t be easy finding information about those people.\u2018I should tone down on the close-quarter monitoring. I should order soldiers to return with simple reports until she starts acting strange.\u2019Although he treated death like a common cold, it was different when it came to the sub-class soldier\u2019s livelihood.Wratch didn\u2019t think he needed to have his henchmen supervise Quikantel while she was in a sensitive state.Thanks to the division leader\u2019s decision to take caution, Enya and her family were able to safely board the Tikan merchant ship.And the Vermont Imperial Family did not notice that Olta\u2019s contractor was missing.At least, until Quikantel left to meet Vyuretta.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *A week later, mid-July of 1795.Just as Jin expected, there weren\u2019t any spies monitoring Enya and Quikantel\u2019s location around the cabin at all times.During that time, Jin and Murakan never left the house. Once a day, only Quikantel left for the city to get food and drinks.During their stay, Jin received a message that Enya safely arrived in Tikan and was receiving protection under Kashimir.\u201cWell, I already knew they\u2019d be safe, but receiving a personal letter from Enya is more reassuring. We can definitely meet Vyuretta with a lighter burden.\u201dQuikantel had already contacted the wind dragon. She requested a rendezvous to discuss Enya.Vyuretta quickly accepted the request, and the promised date was tomorrow night.\u201cYou think Vyuretta will come alone?\u201d\u201cKid, between dragons, etiquette is very important. Quikantel called to just meet, so bringing a line of Zipfel magicians would be unacceptable. Even if you call them for a fight, they\u2019ll come alone\u2014without reinforcements.\u201d\u201cOh, so that\u2019s why you went to the Vermont Empire\u2019s ocean territory with such bravado.\u201d\u201cOf course. There\u2019s nothing that could stop the great Murakan.\u201d\u201cSure, buddy. Remember when you almost died to me when you came here? If it weren\u2019t for Jin, you would have been sinking to the depths of the cold ocean right now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 I was going easy on you, Quikantel.\u201d\u201cDo I need to beat some more sense into you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhile the two dragons growled at each other, arguing that one\u2019s strength is more superior than the other\u2019s, Jin was deeply entrenched in his thoughts.\u2018\u2026So he\u2019s saying the dragons come alone whenever they\u2019re summoned because of etiquette. But we\u2019re a group of three going to meet Vyuretta\u2026 Well, who really cares?\u2019Jin shrugged it off and went to separate the two whose fighting easily became a routine sight for the young Runcandel.\u201cYeah, yeah. No more, you guys. You\u2019ll end up fighting before we even meet Vyuretta tomorrow. I think we should plan more thoroughly about what we should do once we meet him.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what we should do\u2019? We just tell him that we called to find out about the whereabouts of Lathry, not to talk about Enya. And if he\u2019s bullshitting about teaching them Draconic Magic, then we just beat him up.\u201d\u201cI concur. Since Enya isn\u2019t here, I can act as aggressively as I want.\u201d\u201cHmmm. Yes, it all sounds good. I just wanted to ask because Vyuretta wouldn\u2019t answer so easily. And if a battle breaks out, even if we win, we will need to face the Zipfels\u2019 wrath. I think we should at least consider the consequences of our actions.\u201dJin firmly stated this in a serious tone.\u2018I already predicted that intervening with the Zipfels in order to save Euria\u2019s guardian dragon would cause some problems\u2026 But not this much.\u2019Fighting with Vyuretta meant turning the entirety of the Zipfel Clan into their enemy.And, as of the moment, Jin did not have the forces to fight them. Even if he called his latest ally\u2019s army\u2014Kashimir\u2019s regiment of Tikan\u2014they wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.As a matter of fact, rescuing Lathry wasn\u2019t that beneficial in many ways.In exchange for allying with Kashimir, Az Mil\u2019s contractor, and the Seven-Colored Peacock, Jin would be turning the Zipfels against himself.Despite this consequence, Jin chose to meet Vyuretta for three main reasons.First, he promised Kashimir about returning Lathry to Euria\u2019s side.Second, verifying the Zipfels\u2019 plot of finding and assassinating contractors.Lastly, acting in order to save a child was a given.\u201cHmmm, the kid\u2019s right. Though I\u2019m not really scared of their retaliation, it\u2019s still something to think about.\u201d\u201cNot only that, we also have to consider the outcome if we were to lose. Unlike you two, I think it\u2019s possible that Vyuretta would come with the second-in-command, Andrei. In a scenario where he disregards the dragons\u2019 etiquette.\u201dAnd if Vyuretta did come with Andrei? Or what if he shows up with other advanced magicians in tow? There was no definitive answer. Each of the Zipfels\u2019 advanced magicians were equivalent in power to a low-tier dragon.Of course, Jin already had a last resort planned, but he wanted to hear Quikantel\u2019s opinion.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about that. If Vyuretta brings other goons to the rendezvous point and they try to attack me, I will summon the Vermont Imperial Family\u2019s dragons as reinforcement.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a great plan. Even if we don\u2019t find out more about the kidnappings, in the event that Vyuretta refuses to cooperate, we have a good reason to call reinforcements.\u201d\u201cExactly. And when I take care of Vyuretta, if we have the Imperial Family\u2019s dragons on our side, then the Zipfels can\u2019t really take action. The Zipfel Clan and Vermont Imperial Family have some complicated political ties, after all.\u201dThe Vermont Imperial Family was the balancing weight between the Zipfel Clan and Runcandel Clan.Whichever direction the Vermont Imperial Family were to stick to, the balance between the two strongest clans would break. Therefore, Quikantel could destroy Vyuretta, and the Zipfels would still be unable to do anything.If the Zipfels made the Vermont Imperial Family turn against them, then the Runcandels would take the free benefit.It would be a very satisfactory response. This way, no matter what they did, they would not be targeted by the Zipfels.\u201cSounds good. Then tomorrow, we will entrust the job to you. In the meantime, Murakan and I will be hiding nearby.\u201d\u201cHuh? Kid, what do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cIt means we\u2019ll be backup. If Vyuretta comes alone, Ms. Quikantel will fight him by herself. Nothing good will come out from us selling our faces to the Zipfels.\u201dQuikantel smiled at Jin\u2019s response in satisfaction.\u201cYeah, Murakan. It would be best if you don\u2019t come out at all. I will be fighting, so all you need to do is watch.\u201dHer words were lined with a teasing undertone, but Quikantel was genuinely concerned about Murakan. She firmly believed that he stood no chance against Vyuretta in his current state.\u201c\u2026Damn it. I understand that I got a little weaker, but I don\u2019t want any sympathy from my ex.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s sympathizing? Shut your idiotic self up, and help me out if I ever get in trouble. But of course, that would never happen.\u201d* * *Nothing would have happened if Vyuretta came alone because, amongst all of the active dragons out there, Quikantel was one of the strongest dragons.However, as Jin predicted, Vyuretta brought along a person.And it was the Zipfels\u2019 second-in-command, Andrei Zipfel.Standing in the middle of the island, Quikantel glared at Vyuretta.Jin and Murakan were hiding, watching the tense scene. They already filled the forest with spiritual energy, so their presence was concealed.\u201cHo, ho, hum. It is this old man\u2019s first time meeting the Silver Dragon of Time. Madame Quikantel, it is an honor to meet you. I am Andrei Zipfel.\u201d[\u2026Vyuretta. I didn\u2019t think you would bring a person in response to my call.][Please understand, Silver Dragon. When I received your signal, Andrei was right next to me. With the topic being about Olta\u2019s contractor, he showed great interest, so I brought him along.]Quikantel expressed severe disappointment, and Andrei chuckled, messing up his first impression even further.[Vyuretta, you have been very disrespectful ever since you started asking me to introduce Enya. I hope you never do something like this again.][Understood. So, let\u2019s get right into it. What do you want to tell me about Olta\u2019s contractor?][Before that, I would like to ask you something.][Go ahead.][Az Mil\u2019s contractor\u2019s guardian dragon, Lathry. What did you do to them?]She spoke in a dangerous tone.Vyuretta chuckled for a bit in return, then held a straight face.[Damn\u2026 I got baited. You called to talk about Lathry, not Olta\u2019s contractor. I knew something was up.]Vyuretta\u2019s head shook as he spoke.[Answer my question, Vyuretta. One year ago, you took Lathry to teach them some Draconic Magic. I saw with my own two eyes. And to this day, Az Mil\u2019s contractor failed to locate their guardian dragon.][I don\u2019t know how to answer you without leaving you unsatisfied. Hm, Lathry\u2026 is fine. I would\u2019ve never known you\u2019d have a connection with Az Mil\u2019s contractor. Were you asked to find Lathry?][Exactly. Now, if that made sense, return Lathry now. Az Mil\u2019s contractor is searching intently.]Wooooosh~ Wooooosh\u2026!Whirlwinds suddenly manifested, surrounding the island. It was a cyclone caused by Vyuretta\u2019s wind ability.[Vyuretta, it seems you\u2019ve gone crazy. You are under the Zipfels indeed. But to a point where you kidnap your own kind? And a youngling, at that? Based on your actions, just tell me that you want a fight.][You know too much about our business. I will say this now. Hand over Enya, and we will spare you.]Quikantel smirked.[Oh yeah? Perfect. I wasn\u2019t going to spare you anyway, no matter what you chose to do.]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 \u2013 A Replica That Shouldn\u2019t Exist (1)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u2018These crazy fuckers\u2026 I didn\u2019t think they would come out aggressively this fast.\u2019They were now certain that the Zipfels kidnapped Lathry, but seeing their bravado for the misdeed baffled Jin.Additionally, their brash attitude towards eliminating Quikantel without hesitation made it clear that the Zipfels\u2019 central forces definitely had a hand on any business related to Lathry or Enya.\u2018They just demanded for Quikantel to hand over Enya. They are definitely hunting down contractors outside of the Zipfel Clan and are either using or eliminating them.\u2019The fight was about to begin, so Jin and Murakan remained hidden.\u2018We strike when Ms. Quikantel gets into a dangerous position or when there is an opportunity for ambush.\u2019Andrei and Vyuretta still did not notice Jin and Murakan\u2019s presence, so observing the fight for now was a better idea.[I\u2019ll be honest, I haven\u2019t really liked you ever since we met, Quikantel.]Vyuretta shouted, spreading a massive pair of wings.Mana flowed through the powerful winds, and the static tornados began to close in on the silver dragon.Whooooooooosh\u2026!The tornados moved like huge snakes. As trees got torn away from the ground, Quikantel scoffed.[I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t planning to do anything with wind like child\u2019s play.]It was at least an 8-star spell\u2014not something one would call \u2018child\u2019s play\u2019.However, it was not enough to pierce her exoskeleton. She didn\u2019t even dodge the attack and took the winds at full force. Not that she was underestimating the attack, but she genuinely believed that she had no need to.Loud screeches echoed throughout the island as the cyclones made contact with her silver armor.But that was all.The cyclones died down, failing to affect even a single scale.The surroundings were devastated, as if caused by a bombing. And yet, Quikantel stood in the same spot\u2014in the same position.Vyuretta was a little surprised, eyes slightly widening.\u201cWhoa\u2026! Incredible!\u201dAndrei expressed his admiration with a shaky voice.Quikantel didn\u2019t like his expressive attitude. Not one bit.The 9-star grand magician, \u2018Wind King\u2019 Andrei Zipfel.As the second-in-command, everyone knew how strong he was, but not many knew of his \u2018real\u2019 power. Simply due to the fact that everyone who fought him had died. People only could infer his combat power.And as for Quikantel, she didn\u2019t know much about Andrei either.[I guess Wind King isn\u2019t just a title. You filthy human. Show me your strength. After I begin my attack, you won\u2019t have any opportunity to show off.]\u201cI can finally use my full power. In that case, I will enjoy it, Silver Dragon of Time.\u201dAndrei\u2019s staff began to glow.Mana Expansion\u2014a spell signifying the start of an attack.\u2018It\u2019s been a long time since I saw a 9-star Mana Expansion up close.\u2019In an instant, about 500 meters around them, the blue mana dyed their surroundings. It was not a common sight.And because he was the contractor of the God of Wind, Andrei\u2019s magic was the pure essence of wind. Every movement of air around the island could potentially become Andrei\u2019s weapon.Wind was invisible. Although the artificial compression and movement of wind was visible as it ripped through space, wind\u2014at its purest\u2014had no form.Thus, Andrei\u2019s wind could become an invisible sword or a formless spear and pierce the enemy.The space around the grand magician began to morph with the flow of wind. No one knew what would come out of the bending space.\u201cIf I had one thing to say\u2026\u201dAndrei smirked and extended his finger towards Quikantel.\u201cI am especially strong against dragons. So please be careful.\u201dHissss~From Andrei\u2019s finger, wind in the form of a spike flew out.Quikantel sensed the danger and spread her wings. She planned on flying upwards, dodging the attack and shooting her breath to counter him.But there was a reason Andrei mentioned his strength against dragons.\u2018My flight\u2026 has been disabled?\u2019No matter how much she flapped her gigantic wings, no wind occurred. In fact, her wings felt heavier, as if she were swimming in water.A technique that only Melzeyer\u2019s contractor could use\u2014Windless Domain.Inside the Mana Expansion, there was nothing that could fly without Andrei\u2019s permission. And losing the ability to fly was a great loss to a dragon\u2019s combat power.Crackle!Andrei\u2019s wind spikes hit Quikantel\u2019s chest. Some scales broke off and fell to the ground. Simultaneously, Vyuretta flew to the sky.[These bastards\u2026!][You are definitely strong, but you were too careless.]Vyuretta\u2019s breath flew at many angles. Quikantel conjured a force field with her mana, but Andrei cast another spell.This time, it wasn\u2019t an inherited spell from Melzeyer. Instead, it was the Zipfels\u2019 lightning-attributed spell, Lightning Storm. Blue chains crackled and gathered in Andrei\u2019s palm as his feet started lifting off the ground.Just because he was Melzeyer\u2019s contractor didn\u2019t mean that he was limited to wind-attributed spells. Even Jin used spells of multiple attributes freely while using spiritual energy.\u2018This can be lethal. That cursed human\u2026!\u2019Unable to attack, Quikantel felt as if she was being pushed into a corner.\u2018Do we go now?\u2019Jin exchanged looks with Murakan, and the black dragon shook his head.\u201cQuikantel was indeed acting cocky, but those guys are also underestimating her. Let\u2019s watch for a little longer. If we go now, then her pride is gonna get hurt.\u201dAs Murakan finished speaking, Andrei also finished casting his spell.Violent chains of electricity charged towards Quikantel. Hundreds of sparks and crackles of electricity\u2014enough to blind a man\u2014mixed with Quikantel\u2019s breath.Although they were pretty far away, Jin felt shocks throughout his body despite protecting himself with spiritual energy.Power definitely worthy of being the Zipfel Clan\u2019s second-in-command.However, despite its uncontested strength, the spell didn\u2019t hit its target and was rendered useless.Quikantel activated her temporal powers and froze Andrei\u2019s spell.As the grand magician ruled the wind as Melzeyer\u2019s contractor, Quikantel ruled time as one of Olta\u2019s dragons.[That was a pretty neat trick.]More and more crackling bolts of lightning froze in front of Quikantel.Before them was an even match between two god-given powers.Andrei lowered his staff and lowered to the ground. Strangely, avarice flickered in his eyes.\u201cA very coveted power\u2026 Hehehe. Seeing it with my own eyes, I can feel the blood vessels twitching inside my aged body.\u201dQuikantel remained silent and stepped away from the frozen bolts of lightning.[I guess it\u2019s my turn now.]It may still be a situation where her ability to fly was incapacitated, but Quikantel was confident that she could still rule the skies.[If you won\u2019t let me fly, then I will not let you move a single finger!]Screeeeeeeeeeech!A sharp sound echoed, and waves of energy emerged from Quikantel\u2019s forehead.Ripples could be seen throughout space, as if a rock was thrown into water, and everything that the ripples touched lost its time.Inside the frozen time, one would basically become a statue.\u201cThat is the reason why you permanently become a mere plant if you don\u2019t get along with the dragons of time, kid. Get caught by it, and it\u2019s over.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s unspeakably overpowered!\u201d\u201cWell, not really. Just don\u2019t make contact with it. Then it becomes easy. The spell itself is hard to sustain too.\u201dAs it was Vyuretta\u2019s and Andrei\u2019s first time fighting a dragon of time, they dodged the pulses by instinct. But they forgot one crucial fact.If any part of the body gets caught\u2014whether it was the tip of the toe or a strand of hair\u2014then the entire body will freeze.Andrei easily dodged with his small and nimble body, but that was not the case for Vyuretta.Thoooom!Quikantel blasted off the ground with her feet and charged at the wind dragon who was frozen still.\u201cVyuretta!\u201dWhen she got close enough, she released the time prison and ripped Vyuretta\u2019s throat apart with her jaws. Screeching, Vyuretta fell with Quikantel.Boom!From Vyuretta\u2019s long neck spilled thick rivers of blood. With his neck in her jaws, Quikantel stood like a beast that caught its prey.Every time the wind dragon moved, green scales, blood, and flesh splattered everywhere.Andrei was furious, but he couldn\u2019t do anything. Any move he made could kill Vyuretta. In fact, if he tried to approach them, then Quikantel could recast her ultimate spell.[Keuuuook!][Tastes like garbage. You said\u00a0I\u2019m\u00a0cocky? Say that shit again!]Chomp!Quikantel bit off a chunk of Vyuretta\u2019s flesh and taunted her enemies. From Vyuretta\u2019s wound, the white of bone was visible, and the wounded dragon floundered to escape.Reactivating her ability, Quikantel froze Vyuretta once more.The silver dragon made an unbearable sight as she repeated the same process. Her brutal attacks instinctively made the spectators squint their eyes.\u201cWow, I\u2019m getting goosebumps. I also suffered from that attack before.\u201d\u201cFrom Ms. Quikantel?\u201d\u201cYeah, we fought a lot while we were in a relationship.\u201dTwo more times and Vyuretta would be decapitated. The wind dragon\u2019s consciousness was already gone. And even when his time wasn\u2019t frozen, his massive body only flinched a little.\u201cS-Stop, Silver Dragon!\u201d[Shut the fuck up and watch, Zipfel magician. You\u2019re next in line. And you\u2019re at a loss for words? Maybe you\u2019re scared of your impending doom.]Despite her threatening words, Quikantel was also very exhausted at that point.If she could infinitely use her temporal abilities, then the world\u2019s strongest being would not be Cyron Runcandel.\u2018I was able to claim victory due to Vyuretta\u2019s carelessness. I\u2019ll kill this bastard. As for the magician, I\u2019ll get help from Jin and Murakan\u2026!\u2019Because she abused her ability, Quikantel\u2019s mana had depleted.Huff, puff\u2026Breathing heavily, Quikantel was about to cut off Vyuretta\u2019s airway.Yet, with a firm resolve, Andrei walked towards the two dragons.\u201cYou have gone too far.\u201d[Look who\u2019s talking.]\u201cThat is only for the stronger one to say, Silver Dragon. You were born as a Silver Dragon of Time, declaring yourself and your god as strong. All this time, you probably thought of yourselves as rulers of the world\u2026\u201d\u2018\u2026But that\u2019s a delusion. Everything will fall under the Zipfels\u2019 flag\u2014all humans and gods.\u2019Andrei lowered his staff and pulled out something from his robe.In his hand was an orb emitting an ominous black glow. The moment Murakan saw this, he exclaimed.\u201cThe Orb of Origin\u2026! No way!\u201dHe transformed into his true form, and his torso broke through the spiritual energy, revealing a massive shadow unto the ground.[Escape, Quikantel!]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 \u2013 A Replica That Shouldn\u2019t Exist (2)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u201cOh, I see there were more guests.\u201dAndrei cracked a big grin.Goosebumps covered Quikantel as she saw the hysterical smile, backing off after hearing Murakan\u2019s warning.They felt an ineffably ominous energy flowing throughout Andrei\u2019s mysterious orb.And Quikantel\u2019s instincts were not wrong.Kieeeeeeeeeeeek!Not long after, a long entity emerged from the orb, making a screeching sound that ripped their eardrums.\u2018A face\u2026?!\u2019From what Murakan called the \u2018Orb of Origin\u2019 came a huge, black entity that resembled a face. However, its eye sockets were empty. And with part of the face being disfigured, the exact facial features were indistinguishable.As soon as the face formed, the black entity\u2019s long neck extended, and the figure moved to bite Quikantel\u2019s throat.In a split second, it munched on thin air. Had she ignored Murakan\u2019s call, she would not have evaded death.\u201cI wanted to use you as a test subject\u2026 but that\u2019s too bad. Since you saw this face, don\u2019t expect to get any time to rest.\u201dThen, Andrei turned to Murakan.\u201cA black dragon, I see. I only know of two black dragons alive in this world. And since you aren\u2019t a female, you must be the Runcandel Clan\u2019s Murakan. It seems you have awoken from your slumber? Then, the boy next to you\u2026\u201dJin was covering his face with Myulta\u2019s Rune, but Andrei knew who he was.\u201c\u2026must be Solderet\u2019s contractor. Certainly\u2026 Jin Runcandel. You\u2019re the only Runcandel provisional flag-bearer in this area. Am I wrong?\u201dAndrei\u2019s eyes overflowed with avarice.He originally only wanted to \u2018consume\u2019 Olta\u2019s contractor. However, the possibility of making two great catches filled him with greed.Instead of answering the grand magician, Jin just glared at Andrei. Quikantel remained cautious despite the battle being in temporary armistice.During that time, Murakan could not stop looking at the orb in Andrei\u2019s hand and the \u2018face\u2019 that stemmed from it.\u2018It\u2019s similar to the Orb of Origin, but it\u2019s a little different. The gods already disposed of it, so there\u2019s no way for a human to possess such an object.\u2019It could only mean that the orb in the grand magician\u2019s hand was a replica.\u2018But how?\u2019Questioning the situation, Murakan thought deeply.The \u2018Orb of Origin\u2019 is a sacred object that contained the power of all gods, and it was a kind of safety mechanism.It prevents the gods\u2019 creations from attacking the gods, and the gods themselves from attacking other gods. Essentially, it was an object that prevented the end of the world.However, the gods found out that the Orb of Origin possessed powers exceeding the threat of possible war. They evaluated it to be enough to obliterate the entire world. So, as humankind began to prosper, the orb was destroyed.\u2018Last time, it was the cemetery giants. Now, it\u2019s a replica of the Orb of Origin? What the hell is happening?\u2019Although it was merely a replica, the orb in Andrei\u2019s hand possessed disgusting amounts of power.The \u2018face\u2019 approached Vyuretta\u2019s corpse and whispered a chant. Soon after, black smoke emerged from the wind dragon\u2019s wound, and it began to heal. However, it wasn\u2019t a normal regeneration.Instead of green skin and emerald scales, the missing flesh was filled up with the same dark energy as that from the orb.\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have held back. I apologize for your loss, my old friend, Vyuretta.\u201dIt didn\u2019t even take ten seconds for the exposed white bones to be covered by the newly grown flesh, skin, and scales.Vyuretta slowly raised his body. The ground below him still had lakes of blood and remnants of his flesh and scales, but the wind dragon seemed unaffected\u2014besides the massive black blotch on one side of his neck.The sight startled Jin.Even Quikantel\u2014who \u201cregenerated\u201d a severed wing\u2014slowly stepped backwards, and Murakan gritted his teeth.The wind dragon\u2019s corpse was resurrected.Occurrences such as this would still be impossible even with the help of the God of Healing, but it happened right in front of their eyes.[We gotta get serious, kiddo.][Murakan! I will call the dragons of the Vermont Imperial Family. Until then, buy me some ti\u2014]\u201cUh-uh. I can\u2019t let you do that.\u201dFwit!Instantaneously, Andrei disappeared and reappeared behind Quikantel. The face from the Orb of Origin replica opened its jaws.Chomp!Quikantel\u2019s left foot grazed the black teeth\u2014albeit only slightly.However, Quikantel\u2014who didn\u2019t show a single sign of pain while fighting Vyuretta\u2014floundered, screaming in her suffering.Smoke emerged from the grazed wound. Quikantel backed off, limping away from the enemy.\u201cWhat a great scream to hear, Silver Dragon. It\u2019s a shame I cannot hear more of it.\u201dAnd as Murakan tried to run to her\u2026[You think you can make a difference, Murakan?][Move away, Vyuretta.][Move away? The great Murakan is asking me?! Hahaha! I\u2019m sure many dragons would be dying to meet you if they found out about your reawakening. I agree with what Andrei said earlier. It\u2019s a shame I can\u2019t tell the others about you.]Spiritual energy began to spread from Murakan\u2019s wings.[At some point, all dragons feared your presence. But do you think they still do? You have gotten weak. And your contractor is still a baby!]Wooooosh!As he finished his monologue, Vyuretta released a breath.Compressed wind projectiles.The breaths quickly displaced the spiritual energy as they traveled. Vyuretta\u2019s breaths were definitely stronger as compared to before his \u2018resurrection\u2019. All because of the Orb of Origin.Vyuretta was elated as he watched the view before him; for overpowering an old bully felt amazing and refreshed him.[I, Vyuretta, will go down in history as your killer!][Yeah, right, crazy bastard.]Although he was incomparably weaker than his past self, it was still a fact that Murakan was at the apex among all of the entities in the sky at one point.He wasn\u2019t going to lose only after one breath.Fwooooosh\u2026!After resisting the breath, Murakan\u2019s body sublimed and scattered into the black smoke. Then, he approached Vyuretta and reconstructed his body, revealing himself next to his enemy.[Indeed, it\u2019s too easy, isn\u2019t it?]And a close-combat fight ensued. Each time the two massive dragons clashed, the island rumbled and quaked.As space was morphed with the merging of spiritual energy and wind, Jin intently watched the fight between Andrei and Quikantel.He had to read the flow of the battle.\u2018In my current state, joining Murakan and Vyuretta\u2019s fight is suicide. Just getting near them is already impossible. On the other hand, for Andrei\u2026\u2019There was no chance for ambush.After Andrei revealed his Orb of Origin, Quikantel was just running away. Because of this, there was no opportunity for Jin to attack.Additionally, the main enemy of this fight wasn\u2019t Vyuretta, but Andrei Zipfel. Killing him first would make Vyuretta\u2019s demise more meaningful.\u2018Andrei can\u2019t cast a spell while holding that orb. Probably because the artifact drains insane amounts of mana.\u2019If he was casting 9-star spells instead, then Andrei would have been unapproachable. However, he was focusing on the orb. Occasionally, he would cast a short teleportation spell to catch up to Quikantel, yet that was all.\u2018I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the orb, but his overall physical abilities increased. At the level of a 7-star knight, at the very least. This will be difficult.\u2019Ambush and execute instantly.Or at least cut off the hand holding the orb.After concluding his plans, Jin began to move. Thankfully, Vyuretta didn\u2019t seem to notice Jin\u2019s movements as he fought against Murakan.It was only possible because Murakan was putting up a good fight.\u2018When I go back, I should ask Kashimir about this. Well, I don\u2019t know if this will work for Andrei\u2026!\u2019Once he got past Vyuretta, he increased his speed and sprinted towards Quikantel. She and Jin were looking at each other, with Andrei\u2019s back towards the young Runcandel.He only needed three steps before getting in range to strike.However, Andrei spun around with a grin, expecting the ambush.\u201cSo you have come, Jin Run\u2014Erk!\u201dBut Jin never actually thought of slashing Andrei from behind. Not even once.Flash!Instead of swinging his sword, Jin opened his hand in front of Andrei\u2019s face. A spell was ready in his left hand.A spell that everyone thought was gone. An ancient light magic that only one person in the world mastered not so long ago.Photon Cannon\u2014Tzenmi\u2019s vision-impairing spell that Jin mastered in the ship, right before his arrival at Tikan.\u2018It worked!\u2019Instinctively, Andrei used one hand to cover his eyes and bent over. As the magician staggered backwards, Jin unsheathed his sword and swung.Slash!He felt the blade cutting through the flesh at Andrei\u2019s chest. Jin recoiled to stab him, but the orb\u2019s face charged towards Jin.However, the black figure seemed to be influenced by Andrei\u2019s vision, as it just floundered while snapping its jaws at empty air.Jin lowered his torso and swung his sword in an unnatural stance, aiming to slash Andrei\u2019s legs.\u201cKraaaaaaaagh!\u201dSlice\u2026!Andrei\u2014with his ankles cut through\u2014stumbled and fell backwards.A normal enemy would have been doomed and met their end at that point, but Jin didn\u2019t have the opportunity to finish him off.Quikantel was also at her limit. Even with Jin buying her time, she couldn\u2019t lengthen the distance between her and Andrei. She was hunching over the ground, catching her breath.\u201cI applaud your ambush. However, you and your god will become ingredients for the Demon God\u2019s Orb, Jin Runcandel.\u201dEven after being blinded by Photon Cannon and having his feet severed, Andrei spoke normally.Using the face of the Demon God\u2019s Orb, he protected his body. And just like Vyuretta\u2019s resurrection, his ankles were being regenerated.As this all occurred, Vyuretta pushed Murakan away and rapidly stomped towards Jin. He didn\u2019t defeat Murakan, but he flew through the Windless Domain, unaffected by the skill\u2019s effect.[Kid! Above you!]Crash!Vyuretta fell to the ground, right where Jin was standing. Jin was able to throw his body aside to dodge the attack, but evading the subsequent breaths while also avoiding the orb\u2019s face was impossible.He felt that he was right at the doorstep of death.At that moment, Jin put his hand towards his neck and thought of a name.One belonging to the world\u2019s greatest knight, praised by everyone. The transcendent White Whale.His eldest sister\u2014Luna Runcandel.He clenched his fist, and Orgal\u2019s Pendant shattered. For the past six years, he had never taken it off.Crrrack!Simultaneously, a flash of mana burst out, and a dimensional gate opened.\u201cIt seems you\u2019re in a tough spot, youngest Runcandel.\u201dAnd from it, the White Whale emerged.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78 \u2013 An Anomaly Called the Runcandels (1)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]The axe-sword, Crantel. The sword with a tip forged into the shape of an axe blade. A weapon born to satisfy Luna\u2019s tastes.At first glance, one would say that it was a heavy and inefficient weapon\u2014it easily weighed heavier than three or four men.But Luna swung the axe-sword as if it were as light as a feather.Sheeeek! Krrrrt!The first strike deflected Vyuretta\u2019s breath, splitting it into two and sending them to the ground. The second struck the face from the Demon God\u2019s Orb, redirecting it towards Andrei like a ball.Andrei\u2014who had been confident and relaxed\u2014looked anxious and tense. On the other hand, Vyuretta didn\u2019t dare to attack again after landing on the ground.As soon as Luna appeared, the battle scene rapidly changed.She stepped in front of Jin and looked around, then lightly grinned.\u201cThe Zipfels\u2019 second-in-command and a wind dragon. Yes, it\u2019s worth calling me for this kind of fight. Jin, are you hurt anywhere?\u201dThe sun shone behind Luna as she turned to face Jin.Looking into her ocean-deep eyes, Jin was certain.The fight was already won.After all, she was the definition of \u2018strongest\u2019.\u201cNo, not a scratch.\u201d\u201cGood. If you got hurt, I\u2019d kill those two then go flip the Zipfel Clan inside out.\u201dHearing these words, Jin got goosebumps. Mainly because he felt the love and care coming from his sister.Also because \u2018flipping the Zipfel clan inside out\u2019 wasn\u2019t impossible for Luna.\u201cAnyways, I missed you. It was so boring without you back at home. I\u2019m sure you felt the same?\u201d\u201cI think so.\u201d\u201cHow cute.\u201dArriving next to Jin, Murakan covered him with his wings.[Damned kid. You have such a great sister. I thought I was gonna die.]\u201cLord Murakan, it is our first time meeting, yes? As the eldest daughter of the Runcandel Clan, I believe that officially introducing myself would be proper. However, I think that I will be a little busy. Please take care of my youngest brother.\u201d[Understood. I entrust you with the rest of the job, Luna Runcandel.]\u201cSister, please be careful. The Demon God\u2019s Orb artifact resurrected the wind dragon earlier.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, and get out of here. The adult will deal with this, child.\u201dWith Jin on his back and lightly holding Quikantel in his mouth, Murakan began their retreat. Although it looked laughable, if he didn\u2019t get as far as possible\u2026He would be struck by Luna\u2019s sword. They would be safe if they\u2019re at least 500 meters away.[Alright, alright. Now, let\u2019s just spectate. Quikantel, don\u2019t be too embarrassed. It may just be a replica, but it\u2019s normal for a dragon to be afraid of the Orb of Origin.]It didn\u2019t take long for them to get far away from the battlefield. During that time, Andrei and Vyuretta only stared at Luna, at a loss for words.Luna, on the other hand, looked at the Demon God\u2019s Orb that the grand magician was holding.\u2018What in the world is that? That ominous energy\u2026 It feels very similar to that of the demons I killed in the past\u2026 Well, whatever it is, there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t cut through.\u2019Thinking this, Luna slowly pointed her axe-sword at Andrei.\u201cAre you just going to look at me like that, Andrei Zipfel? To think that a legendary figure like you would have business with my brother. I would like an explanation.\u201dAndrei\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u201c\u2026Heh, this is an unexpected variable. O White Whale, the Runcandel Clan has broken its oath. Your brother used magic.\u201d\u201cIndeed, he broke the oath. But that news won\u2019t get to your clan. Oh, if you want, I can go tell Kelliark Zipfel myself. I think it\u2019d be great if I also tell him about your visit to the banquet and fleeing from my father.Andrei gritted his teeth.\u2018Luna Runcandel\u2026 How dare you, you worthless bitch.\u2019But he couldn\u2019t reveal his anger.\u2018That bitch is just food for the Demon God\u2019s Orb. After all, she\u2019s just a mere human. As long as she\u2019s not a demigod like her father, she can\u2019t handle its power.\u2019Andrei firmly believed in the power of the orb and that the Runcandel bitch had no intel or feel for it.\u2018If I cast normal spells like before, it would be a difficult battle. But with the orb, there\u2019s no way I would lose. Nothing changed.\u2019Thinking this, Andrei\u2019s eyes found calm.\u201cWell, alright. I knew that I would have to fight against you like this one day. Today, we will find out if you truly are worthy of the grand name \u2018White Whale\u2019.\u201d\u201cAmong all of the Zipfels, you have the talent of making a boring speech even more boring. Just as boring as you!\u201dShaaang!With a single step off the ground, Luna arrived right in front of Andrei like a bullet.The grand magician was instantly within the axe-sword\u2019s massive strike zone.\u201cAnd weirdly enough, amongst the Zipfels\u2026\u201dCrackle!Andrei barely blocked Luna\u2019s attack with the orb\u2019s face. Vyuretta charged at her, but in an instant, she was standing next to him instead.\u201c\u2026no one knows about me that well.\u201dSlash!The edge of Vyuretta\u2019s wing was cut off. Although it was a small injury, the wind dragon was startled by his inability to react to her attack.\u2018What kind of speed is this\u2026?!\u2019To Vyuretta and Andrei, Luna moved at the speed of light. Following her movements with the naked eye was impossible, and it was the ultimate speed. They could only react to her actions by predicting her next move.\u201cWill the dragon not fight me in his original form? There\u2019s nothing good about having a big body right now.\u201dSurprisingly, after hearing the human\u2019s mocking advice, Vyuretta transformed into a human. As Luna said, one wrong move, and he would be cut into dozens of pieces.The Zipfel Clan didn\u2019t necessarily have zero information on Luna.Being the strongest after Cyron, the Zipfels endlessly scraped information about her. However, the intelligence agents who got too close often got killed. And every single Zipfel who fought against her died, not even leaving out a single one.Additionally, to the Zipfel Clan, Luna was a mystery. They only heard about the rumours of her strength, yet no one told the tale about the whole truth\u2014only settling with a vague conclusion.That she transcended human limits.\u2018Are you saying that a non-contractor could possess this much power? A human other than Cyron?\u2019For a moment, Andrei was delusional. He had mistaken that Luna was a \u2018consumable contractor\u2019 for the Demon God\u2019s Orb.However, the orb didn\u2019t react to her. Therefore, Luna was a normal human.\u2018As soon as I return to the clan, I must completely revise the plans against the Runcandels. If we let them grow in power, the Zipfels will be the first to fall.\u2019Andrei could only be worried about the future of his clan.\u2018Meeting Luna today is an opportunity given by god. If I don\u2019t kill her now, the next chance is when the orb is complete\u2026!\u2019As Andrei thought about his plans, his thoughts on \u2018Luna Runcandel\u2019 rapidly changed.Orb in hand, faced with a person that he could\u00a0never think of fighting against without it, and in a no-man\u2019s island with no witnesses.What were the chances of facing Luna Runcandel in the first place?There would never be a second chance.\u201cVyuretta!\u201dVyuretta nodded as he heard Andrei\u2019s urgent cry. Because they have coordinated their attacks for a long time, the two could communicate their next move even without speech.Whoooooooosh!Wind began to compress on Vyuretta\u2019s palm, its form loosely resembling a spear.And even in his human form, the black blotch on Vyuretta\u2019s neck was flickering. The power that he received from the orb during his resurrection was still being used.\u201cI show my utmost respect. I would have never thought I\u2019d use this power against a human.\u201d\u201cYou must\u2019ve lived a long time. It seems you have fought against many humans.\u201dLuna was pretty relaxed.However, as soon as Vyuretta began to conjure power from the power he inherited from the orb, Luna knew that the dragon\u2019s movements changed.\u2018This isn\u2019t magic. It\u2019s closer to some god-given power. I can see why the aura I felt was similar to the demons\u2019. And this dragon started to use all its power to\u2026\u2019It was to buy time for Andrei, who could extract more power from the orb.With all of it thought out, Luna scoffed.\u2018A 9-star old grand magician and a wind dragon. Do they really believe some measly artifact could save their life?\u2019Baffled, no words came out of her mouth.She realized why the Zipfels couldn\u2019t overtake the Runcandel Clan after so long. They had such a pathetic human as their second-in-command.This thought baffled Luna, silencing her. Then, a thought sparked in her mind.\u2018There\u2019s no way this guy is the Zipfels\u2019 second-in-command. The real one must be a figure who isn\u2019t well known.\u2019Watching from far away, Jin thought the same thing.\u2018It\u2019s so weird. Elder Sister Luna is very strong, but is that really the strength of a 9-star magician?\u2019It definitely looked as if the man lacked the mana to cast other regular spells while operating the orb. The initial Mana Expansion would\u2019ve consumed a lot of mana already.Even considering that, Jin really didn\u2019t expect Luna to dominate the battle.\u2018Either he\u2019s a fake Andrei, information about Andrei has been exaggerated, or the real second-in-command is a different member of the Zipfel Clan and Andrei is just the figurehead. It\u2019s one of these three.\u2019While the Runcandel siblings determined these facts and possibilities, Vyruetta\u2019s wind spear grew massive.Wind, aura, mana, and the Demon God\u2019s Orb\u2019s energy. All four powers seeped into the spear.\u201cDo you really think that you will win with one strike using that big and slow weapon of yours, Wind Dragon Vyuretta?\u201dJust as Luna said, the spear continuously grew and reached a point where it no longer resembled a spear.Without hesitation, Vyuretta began to swing and thrust the weapon, and Luna felt a little sorry.\u2018How could a dragon become so corrupt?\u2019After dodging two attacks, Luna stopped in place.\u201cI\u2019ll show you, then. I will take it head-on. I didn\u2019t want to stall anyways.\u201dFwooooosh!Crantel let out a brilliant glow; the blade\u2019s endless light shone in all directions. Resembling the light emitted by the sun, its aura looked more sacred than dangerous.The Runcandels\u2019 third decisive killing move, \u2018Meteor Shower\u2019.The blade was slammed to the ground. And, true to the technique\u2019s name, the clouds split open as meteors began to fall.Right where Luna\u2019s arrogant opponents stood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 \u2013 An Anomaly Called the Runcandels (2)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u2018That\u2019s\u2026!\u2019Jin\u2019s eyes filled with awe as he looked up to the sky.He had heard his brothers discuss the clan\u2019s different decisive killing moves multiple times in his past life.Seeing the sky open up and an aura plummet to the ground, he was able to deduce that it was the clan\u2019s third decisive killing move, \u2018Meteor Shower\u2019. But it was the first time he actually witnessed it.As well as his first time seeing one of his clan\u2019s secret techniques.\u2018It\u2019s surprisingly beautiful\u2026\u2019And strong.Countless balls of energy fell like shooting stars. As each streak of light hit the ground, Jin could feel the impact throughout his body.He felt like he was looking at the absolute limit of human ability.He clenched his fist and focused on observing, not wanting to miss a single moment. He wanted to remember this scene and someday recreate it himself.Recreate the same domineering power.Quikantel mindlessly stared at the hundreds of aura stars falling from the sky. The only calm person was Murakan.[Decisive killing move, Meteor Shower. It\u2019s been a thousand years. It\u2019s still lacking compared to Temar\u2019s, but your sister is still a monster.]BOOM! KABOOM!Every time a meteor smashed the ground, the entire island wailed.The land became disfigured, rocks shattered, and dirt crumbled into smaller particles. Meteors thrashed the ground, powerful enough to disintegrate everything that makes contact into nothing.Among the explosions, a helpless human and dragon looked pitiful as they searched for shelter.They realized that they couldn\u2019t survive relying on some incomplete artifact\u2014ultimately filling their hearts with hopelessness and misery.\u2018No\u2026! This can\u2019t be!\u2019Andrei muttered words like a prayer as he gripped the Demon God\u2019s Orb. Vyuretta returned to his dragon form and leapt to protect him.\u2018We can win if I keep Andrei safe. If I protect Andrei\u2026!\u2019Even if his body was torn into millions of pieces, as long as one broken bone or chunk of flesh remained, Vyuretta could be resurrected with the power of the orb. It was because of this that he never feared death.However, Luna\u2019s strength was still horrific.It didn\u2019t matter if he got revived and resurrected. He was guaranteed to die again anyway. Maybe, even with a complete Demon God\u2019s Orb, it would be impossible to defeat the human before him.On the other hand, Luna overflowed with majestic might as she lowered her axe-sword.She didn\u2019t even look at the meteor shower ripping Vyuretta apart, preoccupied by her dissatisfaction with the results.She disintegrated the island and slaughtered the Zipfel grand magician as well as his dragon. And yet, she was not satisfied.\u2018Not even close to Father\u2019s.\u2019Cyron\u2019s Meteor Shower, which she had witnessed only once in the past, was much stronger.It was difficult to explain, but it transcended\u2026 it wouldn\u2019t even be considered as something that was done by a human.She had to do something that would absolutely dominate the battlefield. Only then could she consider comparing herself with her father.\u2018Still, this is a good experience for the youngest. Hopefully, it gives him some inspiration. If I\u2019m not worthy of being Father\u2019s successor\u2026 it definitely has to be you, our youngest brother.\u2019With that thought, she looked behind her.She wanted to send a message to her sibling who was watching the incomplete yet amazing technique. That he should grow and become much stronger in order to become the next patriarch of the Runcandel Clan.And Jin felt his sister\u2019s sentiment. Even though she didn\u2019t voice it out, or even if she said it and Jin couldn\u2019t hear it\u2026 Even though Jin could barely see her from far away, he knew what she wanted to tell him.\u2018She is always teaching me something.\u2019She lit a fire in his heart.Compared to any other moments, he had never felt more passionate about swordsmanship. The thought of surpassing his eldest sister and their father to succeed the throne suffocated him.He would never forget this moment.At the end of the meteor shower, a massive crater was left behind in the middle of the island, filling up with water. And, as if a submarine volcano erupted, a tsunami grew from the filled crater. Additionally, Vyuretta and Andrei were nowhere to be seen.They surrendered their life to the body of water\u2014for within the tsunami, parts of Vyuretta\u2019s corpse were visible.The sky above was clear; every single bit of cloud had been dispersed by the meteors that pierced through them.Luna lightly shook her head as she stood underneath the shining sun and in front of the growing tsunami.\u201cThis is a little disappointing. In front of my brother\u2026 It\u2019s annoying if you hold on for too long.\u201dLuna pointed Crantel at the tsunami.Simultaneously, something inside the massive wall of water slowly revealed itself.A black, massive, monstrous face.It resembled the entity from the Demon God\u2019s Orb. However, it soon emerged out of the water with a full body. Its arms and legs broke out of the water\u2019s surface first, then its torso followed.Andrei had fused with the orb.\u201cThat crazy\u2026 What is that? Is that the result of unleashing the artifiact\u2019s powers?\u201dOrb of Origin, Demon God\u2019s Orb\u2014whatever it was, Jin knew it wasn\u2019t normal. Moreover, the power was too horrific to simply be from an \u2018artifact\u2019.\u2018I\u2019ve never seen anything like it in my past life. It\u2019s as if a powerful god has descended.\u2019There was no word to describe the terrifying creature other than \u2018god\u2019.Quikantel\u2019s tail curled up, unable to resist the terror in front of her.Although it was a replica, the Demon God\u2019s Orb still contained the power of the gods, which automatically drew the fear out of dragons.[Whew, I\u2019m certain now. Kid, the Zipfels used a contractor to recreate the Orb of Origin. Thankfully, it\u2019s not very strong right now. Just a little evil\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you the rest later. First, we have to get outta here.]\u201cWe have to escape?\u201dAndrei\u2019s Windless Domain was long gone. Murakan opened his wings and began to rise, and Jin instinctively shouted.\u201cWe have to get Elder Sister Luna! We can\u2019t let her fight that thing alone!\u201d[No, that thing needs to be killed. If we let it live, then it will torment the world. The Orb of Origin is like that. And the only person who can end that thing is your sister.]\u201cBut\u2026\u201d[Even though I lost my strength, my eyes are still sharp. Your sister can definitely take it head-on. If it were the real Orb of Origin, even Temar wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it.]As if she were listening in on their conversation, Luna looked up towards Jin and Murakan. She waved her hand in the air as she shouted.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, and go somewhere safe!\u201dJin still felt uneasy and thought it wasn\u2019t right for him to just escape.Yet, he instinctively knew. As Murakan said, \u2018that\u2019 needed to be exterminated.However, he was extremely upset and disappointed that he could only watch from the sidelines instead of help.\u2018After today, there will never be a day where I\u2019m powerless\u2026!\u2019Jin gritted his teeth.Murakan grinned, for he was proud of Jin\u2019s hunger for improvement.\u2018Friggin\u2019 kid. I knew you had no fear. Looking at that thing and still emitting your battle aura\u2026 Looks like you really want to kill it yourself.\u2019A strong energy, enough to sting Murakan\u2019s plated back; it was undoubtedly Jin\u2019s.An unbelievably prominent battle aura from a fifteen-year-old who just became a 5-star.\u2018You will become the best, Jin Runcandel, the contractor of a thousand years.\u2019Murakan didn\u2019t feel great about escaping as well. However, he was looking forward to Jin\u2019s future and potential.[C\u2019mon, don\u2019t be too down, and watch your sister. Watch the anomaly called the Runcandels. Today, Luna Runcandel will save the world!]When she thought they got far enough from the island, Luna wrapped Crantel with aura. At the same time, Andrei stepped away from the massive water wall and looked down on her.\u201cAndrei Zipfel. Hmm\u2026 Your face is too disfigured for me to tell, but you\u2019re definitely making a confident expression. Since you became a monster with that artifact, you must think you could defeat me now.\u201dGrrrrr, grrrrrrrrk, grrrrrrrk!The monster let out a triumphant laugh that sounded similar to someone violently clearing their throat. As she said, Andrei was no longer afraid of Luna.\u201cThe power of the Twelve Gods are currently inside me, Luna Runcandel! And what do you have? Even if your father was here, you wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat me!\u201d\u201cAh, the Twelve Gods. Unfortunately, I only have this one sword right now.\u201dShe responded with a calm face.\u201cShow me all you\u2019ve got. I will gladly receive it!\u201dA belittling smirk then grew on Luna\u2019s face.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re still delusional. If you fought me using the magic you had trained for years, you could\u2019ve seen half of my true skill at most.\u201dAndrei tried to respond, but held back after seeing that Crantel was dyed in red.\u2018Crimson aura?\u2019Andrei tilted his head in confusion. He had fought hundreds of knights, but he had never seen any of them use a crimson aura.\u201cOn that note, although you never deserved it\u2026\u201dCrantel was set ablaze.\u201cIn order to fix your foolishness\u2026 I shall show you what true swordsmanship is. And naturally, you will see the flaws in your ways.\u201d\u2018You allegedly caged the entities you proclaim as \u2018gods\u2019 inside that pathetic little rock, and you think that nothing can stand in your way just because you have it in your possession. Delusional. The man I\u2019ve seen my entire life\u2014who is deemed a \u2018demigod\u2019\u2014is dominating the world. Or are you saying that your gods are stronger than him?\u2019\u2018Mind\u2019s Blade: Blood Moon.\u2019Luna whispered, a brilliant red light emitting from Crantel.A light that swallowed the island and sky. Andrei didn\u2019t feel an ounce of danger, for he trusted the orb too much.\u201cCome! With your powerless attack!\u201dLuna swung her sword, and a massive red wave of energy traveled quickly across the island. The ground soon began to rumble, and in an instant, the ground split, forming fissures.The slash of red light passed through the entirety of the island.And Luna, thinking there was nothing to check, lowered her sword and turned.\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026\u201d\u2018I\u2019ll show you.\u2019He couldn\u2019t finish his sentence. And that became his last will.Pzzzzzt!Crack!The orb hidden in Andrei\u2019s chest pocket shattered. The space around him cracked like glass, and the orb\u2019s dark energy was sucked into its crevices.On the pathetic excuse of an island, even the biggest of boulders were being vacuumed into the void.The moment Luna\u2014who was kneeling on one knee due to exhaustion\u2014was about to reach its edge\u2026Whooooosh!Murakan descended at full speed, and Jin extended his hand towards her. She barely caught his hand, and she flashed a smile.\u201cIt looks like our youngest has saved me this time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80 \u2013 Each Other\u2019s Business[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]The island where they fought completely disappeared after the destructive onslaught from Meteor Shower, Mind\u2019s Blade: Blood Moon, and the explosion from the shattering of the Demon God\u2019s Orb. It was enough destructive power to completely annihilate the island from existence.The Vermont Empire realized this case and dispatched an investigation team. In the nearby seas, the naval security witnessed the great explosions and alerted the mainland.The dispatched investigation team were the Imperial Magicians and Vermont Special Forces 3rd Division.They could only be shocked at the devastated scenery.The obliterated island was one thing, but the eerie mana continued to whirlpool into nothingness. It was the main reason as to why they couldn\u2019t approach the remnants of the island.\u2018What the hell happened here?\u2019And the Special Forces soldiers who were tracking down Quikantel and Enya felt their hearts sink.They knew that the destruction before them was definitely related to the whereabouts of the contractor and her dragon.An Imperial Magician\u2014who was watching the scene\u2014approached the Special Forces.\u201cDivision Leader Wratch, it seems that Silver Dragon Quikantel had a battle here. The silver dragon\u2019s mana\u2026 and the wind dragon\u2019s mana can be detected here.\u201d\u201cThe wind dragon\u2026 Are you sure?\u201d\u201cYes. I think it\u2019s the Zipfels\u2019 Vyuretta. He was the only wind dragon who came near this area. And I can detect a human\u2019s mana\u2026 but I can\u2019t determine whose it is.\u201dWratch placed his hand on his forehead.Why did they fight? No answers immediately came to mind.\u2018The human\u2019s mana is highly likely to be from Olta\u2019s contractor, Enya. Maybe it\u2019s related to the \u201cthing\u201d that the Zipfels are making? Shit, I should have kept more eyes on the log cabin\u2026!\u2019The \u2018thing\u2019 he referred to was the Demon God\u2019s Orb.Currently, there weren\u2019t many in the Vermont Empire who knew about the orb. The only ones who knew of its existence were the emperor, the Special Forces Division Leaders, and some imperial ministers.However, none of them exactly knew its abilities and functions, nor did they know the item\u2019s name.They only had knowledge of the Zipfels making an artifact involving the \u2018contractors of gods\u2019.\u201cDivision Leader! The navy discovered parts of a dragon\u2019s corpse on the opposite side of the island.\u201dThe discovered pieces of flesh and scales were stuck to some remnants of dead trees floating in the ocean.\u201c\u2026They\u2019re certainly from the silver dragon\u2019s wing and the wind dragon\u2019s tail.\u201dThe imperial magician verified after looking at the remains.\u201cGather all of the remains in the ocean. Make sure you don\u2019t let it fall into that void!\u201dIn the following hours, the investigation team was able to recover many pieces of flesh, bones, and scales.The imperial magicians concluded that both dragons died from the battle, and reporting such news to the emperor was Wratch\u2019s job.\u201cIndeed, just like you said, this may be related to the artifact that they are making. Does that mean you didn\u2019t identify what caused the whirlpool that superseded the island?\u201d\u201cYes, Your Imperial Majesty.\u201d\u201cThere seems to be many uncertainties within your reports. And you didn\u2019t even identify Quikantel\u2019s guests.\u201d\u201cMy apologies, Your Imperial Majesty.\u201d\u201cWell, you probably didn\u2019t do it on purpose. If you are not able to find them, then they must be extraordinary people. Still, I believe that you can track them in the end.\u201dWratch lowered his head.\u201cAnyway\u2026 In our perspective, we should be praying that both dragons are dead. Else, they\u2019d see it as a threat. First, let\u2019s wait for the Zipfel Clan\u2019s official declaration.\u201d\u201cWhat shall we tell our press?\u201d\u201cTell them to cover it up for now. If Enya isn\u2019t found until tonight, then declare her as missing. Quikantel probably just died with her. The nobles at the academy would be delighted.\u201dAfter Wratch left, the emperor sat alone in the office and thought to himself.\u2018I should dispatch more of the Special Forces near the Zipfel Clan. Too many things happened while I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u2019* * *At the topmost floor of the Zipfel Clan\u2019s Tower of Magicians, a man looking into a crystal ball spoke.\u201cAndrei\u2026 is dead.\u201dThe man was Kelliark Zipfel, the Zipfel Clan\u2019s current patriarch.Although Andrei was his younger brother, finding out that the second-in-command had died didn\u2019t really affect him.Unlike the world\u2019s perception of his appearance, he had the face of a young adult. Anyone who didn\u2019t know what Kelliark looked like back in his youth wouldn\u2019t be able to immediately identify him on the streets.[What? Your brother died? What do you mean? That crystal ball\u2026 You can\u2019t see anything inside it. It\u2019s just for decoration. Is that supposed to be another unfunny joke, Kelliark?]The only being who could talk to Kelliark Zipfel this comfortably was Fire Dragon Kadun\u2014one of the God of Flames Sheenu\u2019s dragons and Kelliark\u2019s guardian dragon. He was slowly cooking a meat skewer using the breath coming out of his snout.\u201cNo, not through the crystal, you idiot. I can feel it. My younger brother just died. I\u2019m not kidding.\u201dKadun stopped turning his skewer.[Hm\u2026 so you say it\u2019s true. Maybe he lost to Quikantel? Didn\u2019t he take the Demon God\u2019s Orb with him? He also had Vyuretta. Ah, since Andrei died, then did Vyuretta perish as well? Either way, Quikantel should have been an easy opponent if he had the orb\u2019s power by his side.]\u201cNo idea. Perhaps the silver dragon was stronger than we thought, or a third party helped them.\u201d[Quikantel? That bitch is strong, but not enough to fight both of them. She\u2019s definitely not enough against the orb!]Chomp!Kadun chewed off a bite of the skewer. Kelliark looked at him and gently grinned.\u201cIf that\u2019s so, then it means that there was a third party. Who do you think it is?\u201d[How the fuck would I know? Dumbass.]Kelliark frowned at the dragon\u2019s words.[\u2026It\u2019s probably a dragon! Last time, didn\u2019t Kinzelo say that \u2018a dragon controlling the shadows\u2019 killed the cemetery giants? Then it could be Misha. Very likely.]\u201cBy Misha do you mean Black Dragon Murakan\u2019s sister?\u201d[Yeah, her. That bitch wouldn\u2019t feel fear from the orb\u2019s power. She may not be as strong as Murakan in his prime, but she\u2019s still super strong.]\u201cYour duty has been determined, Kadun.\u201d[To go find Misha? I guess I do all the dirty work. I\u2019ll try to find her, but don\u2019t expect anything from me. If a black dragon tries their best to hide, even the God of Searching wouldn\u2019t be able to find them.]\u201cI\u2019ll just trust you, Kadun. Either way, losing the orb is kind of a pain in the ass.\u201d[Do you even give a single fuck that your brother just died?]\u201cWell, I knew that dumbass would die at some point. A while back, he just waltzed into Cyron\u2019s banquet without an ounce of fear, and I was pretty worked up. I didn\u2019t think he\u2019d take the orb with him to the grave, though.\u201d[We gotta call the Fragmentor to make it again. Without that, we can\u2019t go for the Runcandels before Cyron dies. And the kings of the Black Sea\u2026]\u201cI know. I know already. Man, this is all a mess. Just in case, I should go get rid of all evidence of the orb. I got more dirty work than you, Kadun.\u201d[You should be doing that much. In order to become the God of the World, that is.]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *In Bouvard Gaston\u2019s Fragmented Workshop located in the Curano Dukedom, Vishukel sat down as he suppressed his hateful wrath and emotion.\u201cAh, welcome, Sir Vishukel! Good timing. I was craving those sweet potato croquettes of yours. Hehe\u2026 No croquettes today\u2026?\u201d\u201cListen closely, Bouvard. I came after hearing from the traitors of the Vermont Imperial Family. It seems that the Zipfel Clan used the Demon God\u2019s Orb behind our backs.\u201d\u201cWhat? They did?\u201d\u201cYes. In the Vermont Empire\u2019s ocean territory, a silver dragon and wind dragon had a big battle, and an island got annihilated. And because of the remaining mana, there\u2019s a whirlpool in the middle of the ocean that wouldn\u2019t disappear\u2026 It\u2019s definitely caused by the orb\u2019s destruction.\u201dHearing this, Bouvard jumped up from his seat and shouted.\u201cUrrrrggghhh! That orb was my creation! I\u2019m sure I warned them not to use it in its incomplete state! I\u2019ll never forgive them if it\u2019s true!\u201dAs Bouvard threw a tantrum, Vishukel grimaced.\u2018The day to kill this dumbass hog strays further. He has to remake the orb.\u2019The Zipfels came up with the initial idea, but Bouvard took care of the orb\u2019s creation.Thus, the orb\u2019s ownership was equally shared between the Zipfel Clan and Kinzelo group.\u201cEven our leader is furious. Since our alliance with the Zipfels could shatter at any moment, don\u2019t communicate with them for the time being.\u201d* * *Two days later.\u201cYoung Master Jin, welcome back!\u201dJin and his companions arrived at Kashimir\u2019s mansion in Tikan. Kashimir and the agents of the Seven-Colored Peacock came out to the courtyard to greet them. And Gilly\u2014who was awaiting their arrival\u2014frantically ran to them.\u201cYoung Master! Are you alright?\u201d\u201cStrawberry Pie. Haha, I\u2019m okay.\u201dGilly had heard about Enya\u2019s plight, and never slept one bit as she worried about Jin. She turned her head towards Luna, and immediately bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Gilly. I heard on the way here, but the youngest seems to love you a lot. Please continue to take care of him.\u201d\u201cLuna\u2026? Wait\u2026 The White Whale, Lady Luna Runcandel?\u201d\u201cAh, you must be Sir Kashimir. Greetings. I am Luna Runcandel.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Lady Luna would come to my residence. It is my honor to serve you. Please, come in. You have all done well.\u201dAs they entered the mansion, Kashimir spoke before Jin could open his mouth.\u201cYoung Master Jin, I must tell you something first. Earlier today, about three hours ago, my daughter\u2019s guardian dragon returned.\u201dJin\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cLathry returned?\u201d\u201cYes, but there\u2019s something weird. It seems like Lathry has a gap in their memory for the time they went missing. For now, Lathry is beside my daughter, but it seems like they couldn\u2019t understand the situation themself. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a kidnapping?\u201d\u201cIt definitely was. Quikantel got a confession directly from Vyuretta.\u201dA thought suddenly came to Jin.\u2018Maybe the Zipfels are concerned about other clans discovering the existence of the orb, so they\u2019re getting rid of all evidence regarding the situation. Then, it\u2019s likely that they would purposefully erase Lathry\u2019s memories to protect its secrecy.\u2019With this in mind, Jin explained the events at the island, and Kashimir nodded as he listened.\u201cThose are some extreme situations\u2026 I feel bad that I forced you into such circumstances while I powerlessly remained in Tikan. An artifact that swallows contractors whole\u2026 What the hell is happening in the Zipfel Clan\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one reason to make a replica of the Orb of Origin, twerp.\u201dMurakan opened his mouth. Jin, Quikantel, and Luna nodded.On the way to Tikan, they had heard more about the Orb of Origin.\u201cThey\u2019re trying to become a god in order to rule the world\u2026 Well, I don\u2019t know if things will go how they want it to, though.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81 \u2013 Meeting Cyron (1)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]It hasn\u2019t even been a month since he became a provisional flag-bearer and left the Garden of Swords, yet Jin has already destroyed the Akin Kingdom\u2019s underground organization, settled in the Free City of Tikan, and killed the Zipfel Clan\u2019s second-in-command along with his guardian dragon, Vyuretta.The last battle may have been concluded by Luna, but if it wasn\u2019t for Jin, Andrei and Vyuretta would\u2019ve never come to the island in the first place.No provisional flag-bearer in Runcandel history had this many achievements in such a short amount of time.However, there was a problem.\u201cI worked my ass off and did a lot of stuff, but not anything to instantly prove myself worthy of becoming a provisional flag-bearer.\u201dMurakan sighed at the young Runcandel and spoke.\u201cWell, when this is all over, I can say that I caused all the ruckus, so there\u2019s nothing to be worried about. Either way, it\u2019s better to not become a public figure right now.\u201dA provisional flag-bearer\u2019s fame was stocked up on a \u2018fake name\u2019 that the clan determined beforehand.And once it was known that the provisional flag-bearer had gathered enough fame, the clan would contact the candidate to inform them of their worthiness to the throne.Therefore, Jin\u2019s fame needs to naturally travel into the ears of the Runcandel Clan in order to be considered a strong candidate.However, he could not do this. Until now, everything he did wasn\u2019t resolved with only the use of his sword.\u2018Since I dealt with stuff using magic, I definitely can\u2019t tell anyone in the clan.\u2019He would only be able to tell them once he had accumulated enough power and authority\u2014to a point where there would be no problem when his siblings find out about a \u2018magic-using Runcandel\u2019.Until then, Jin planned to remain as a \u2018rumour\u2019 to the world.Simply put, a rumour of a human who could resist the Zipfels and other powerful entities. One who could wield the sword and use magic, and also has unknown individual powers.Furthermore, a rumour that he is Solderet\u2019s contractor.\u2018Until then, the people who know of my ability to use magic must be limited to my companions, Elder Sister Luna, and Father.\u2019Luna knew Jin\u2019s inner thoughts. Even before she heard Andrei say that Jin \u2018broke the oath\u2019, she knew that her brother was a magic-user. Being the one to visit the Storm Castle and detect Murakan\u2019s presence, it was obvious that she knew.And Jin was certain that she knew about Murakan. He had no doubt that Cyron was also aware of her knowing about the black dragon.\u201cOur dear youngest brother, using magic even though he\u2019s a Runcandel. A free-flying teenager, I see. He\u2019s gonna cut you in half, hehe.\u201dLuna walked towards Jin and spoke in a playful tone.\u201cI\u2019m also worried about the Young Master\u2019s magic, Lady Luna. If the patriarch hears about this, he won\u2019t sit still.\u201d\u201cNo, Gilly. Father probably already knows. The destruction of the Tesing Clan and Andrei Zipfel\u2019s death\u2026 He probably already assumed that it was all done by me.\u201dLuna nodded at her brother\u2019s conviction.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty confident while saying that. You got something planned?\u201d\u201cYes, Elder Sister. I\u2019m planning to go see Father with you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh, sure. We can go see Fa\u2026 What?\u201dLuna stared at Jin in disbelief.\u201cEveryone knows that you\u2019re impulsive, but wouldn\u2019t it be better to stay put when Father is turning a blind eye to you? What are you going to do when you meet him?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to warn him that the Zipfels are executing multiple plans to strike at the Runcandels.\u201dThe life in Gilly\u2019s face drained, and Murakan was a little surprised.\u201cHmm, the story about the orb? Wouldn\u2019t it be better if I told him about it? A provisional flag-bearer returning to the clan without permission is basically ruining your chances to the throne.\u201dAs Luna said, a provisional flag-bearer could not enter the Garden of Swords without permission. It was equivalent to a \u2018forfeit\u2019.\u201cNo, if you were the one to tell him, you would also have to mention that I summoned you to the island. It\u2019s better if I confront him myself. And with the story as the base, I plan to strike a deal with Father.\u201dGilly spat out the water that she was drinking, shocked at the younger Runcandel\u2019s declaration.\u201cY-Young Master, you\u2019re joking, right?\u201d\u201cOn top of returning to your clan, you\u2019re going to make a deal with your dad? Hah, what in the world\u2026 I would\u2019ve never thought of that. Not even through my entire lifetime.\u201dThe very idea of striking a bargain with Cyron Runcandel doused the group in awkward silence.Was that even possible? Even Luna was concerned that her brother might have hurt his head during the battle.\u201cWhat do you plan on bargaining for from Father?\u201d\u201cThere are too many, so I\u2019m planning to choose one or two while on the way there.\u201d\u201c\u2026I can see how tiresome it is for Gilly to deal with you. Losing your chances of being a flag-bearer is not the problem. One wrong move and you\u2019ll die. What should we do, Gilly? Stopping him will be futile, so is beating some sense into him the right answer?\u201d\u201cIf the situation doesn\u2019t go well, you can just calm him down.\u201dLuna ultimately didn\u2019t beat Jin, but Gilly could only sigh at the sight of her young master\u2019s impulses.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Gilly. If I block with my body, then Father will not be so harsh.\u201d\u201cLady Luna\u2026 In that case, I shall follow you, Young Master.\u201d\u201cAwww, not you too. I\u2019m tired.\u201dContrary to her words, Luna thought it was nice of Gilly to volunteer.\u2018I\u2019m sure she\u2019s scared, but is she declaring that if she were to die, she will die with Jin? The youngest is very lucky to have such a protective guardian.\u2019She was a little heartbroken. After all, Luna knew the backstory of how \u2018Gilly McRolan\u2019 became \u2018Nanny Gilly\u2019.\u2018If she hadn\u2019t become Jin\u2019s guardian, then she would\u2019ve become the McRolan\u2019s next generation\u2019s strongest sword. A destiny very similar to that of Jin.\u2019Murakan cleared his throat, attracting everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cEldest daughter of Runcandel. I shall go together with Strawberry Pie.\u201d\u201cThe great black dragon should remain here. Even if you go, wouldn\u2019t you have to stay as a cat the entire time?\u201d\u201cI understand\u2026\u201dDisappointed, Murakan turned into a cat and lowered his tail. However, no one really turned to look at him, so Murakan sauntered over to an adjacent room, where Euria and Enya were playing.At least there, he was the center of attention.\u201cAlright, then. Tomorrow, we\u2019ll depart for the first transfer gate. It hasn\u2019t even been a month, but it feels like it\u2019s been a long time.\u201dThe day passed, and right before their departure to the Garden of Swords, Jin visited Kashimir\u2019s office.\u201cYoung Master Jin.\u201d\u201cSir Kashimir, I came for some favours.\u201d\u201cFavours? No need. You and I now share the same fate, so all of my powers and acquisitions are yours as well.\u201dJin knew that Kashimir was the Fallen Prince of Vermont and that his daughter was Az Mil\u2019s contractor.Kashimir knew that Jin was a Runcandel provisional flag-bearer who was a talented magic user and got along well with dragons.Essentially, they both had information that enabled them to hold each other by the throat. Which is why they shared the same fate.On top of that, Kashimir felt indebted to Jin. Although he didn\u2019t directly bring back Lathry, ultimately, it was Jin who saved his daughter.\u201cIf I never met you, I would be watching my daughter suffer and die without knowing. I would never be able to repay this debt even until my final days.\u201dKashimir\u2019s eyes were glistening.\u2018He\u2019s very sensitive and delicate\u2014even more so than I expected. I mean, in my past life, I heard that the Free City of Tikan was established during the era of Holy Kings. A very romantic and emotional time period.\u2019While Jin looked for an answer, Kashimir hurriedly wiped his eyes with a handkerchief.\u201cMy apologies\u2026 Haha, the mood would\u2019ve been ruined. Anyways, what do you want me to prepare? Tell me anything you need.\u201d\u201cPlease tell the Seven-Colored Peacock to research and investigate these things.\u201dHe pulled out a piece of paper from his chest pocket and lent it to Kashimir.Written on the paper was a list of the Zipfels\u2019 wrongdoings that Jin witnessed. The creation of living golems at the Kollon Ruins, and his experiences fighting against the Demon God\u2019s Orb.Including everything regarding the Cemetery Giants in the Curano Dukedom, which Murakan confessed on discovering as he explained the Orb of Origin yesterday.Kashimir\u2019s eyes shook after reading through the paper.\u201cCreation of living golems\u2026 If the world finds out, everyone\u2019s respect for the Zipfel Clan would plummet. As for the Demon God\u2019s Orb\u2026 Since nobody knows of the Orb of Origin, I will not approach this problem.\u201d\u201cAlright. However, this is information that shouldn\u2019t be exposed to the public. If anything happens, the Zipfels will conceal their illicit actions even further.\u201d\u201cI agree. I will order investigations to the most trustworthy agents. On the contrary, may I ask why you want the real name of this gangster named \u2018Spiderhand Alu\u2019 and information regarding Vishukel Yvliano?\u201dKashimir simply asked about the purpose of the investigation in order to confirm whether Jin also thought of Kashimir as a companion.Jin answered him without hesitation.\u201cWe caused the destruction of the Tesing Clan and found out back then that Alu had ties with a Runcandel. As for Vishukel\u2026 Recently, there were some weird things that happened at the banquet. However, I\u2019m not certain of anything, so it\u2019s hard to answer.\u201d\u201cI understand. Although I can resolve the Alu and Vishukel cases very quickly, I don\u2019t know how long the other cases will take.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Investigating the Zipfel Clan is not an easy task.\u201dThe two met eyes, and Jin extended his arm for a handshake.\u201cI look forward to our partnership, Sir Kashimir.\u201d\u201cI as well, Young Master Jin. I will prepare some high quality wine in the belief that you will return in one piece from the Garden of Swords. There are many things I would like to discuss with you. The Free City of Tikan will soon become a country, and you will become its closest friend.\u201dKashimir met Jin\u2019s hand.Within the hour, Jin left Kashimir\u2019s residence and prepared to board a carriage with Luna and Gilly to leave for the transfer gate.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82 \u2013 Meeting Cyron (2)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Early in the morning, the Huphester Alliance\u2019s transfer gate lacked people.Yet, as soon as Jin, Luna, and Gilly arrived, they attracted the attention of the few people who were there.Mainly because of Luna.Jin\u2019s face had not been widely known yet. But when it came to Luna, people would notice her anywhere she went. And being the Runcandel Clan\u2019s military ally, the people of the Huphester Alliance especially paid more attention to her.However, nobody spoke to her nor mentioned her name. Instead, that night, there would be bustling talk about her visit to the city.\u201cThis is why I don\u2019t like moving around. I usually enjoy a small rural area where nobody knows me. How could you say that the outdoors are more comfortable?\u201dWhile Luna complained, Jin pulled down his hood to partially cover his face.The transfer gate\u2019s security ran towards them.\u201c\u201cAll hail!\u201d\u201d\u201cI am honored to escort the first flag-bearer of Runcandel!\u201d\u201cSince we\u2019re going to the Garden of Swords, please call a carriage for us.\u201dLuna received the salutes and responded.\u201c\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d\u201dThe security officers ran off. Although they were not directly affiliated with the Garden of Swords, they received financial compensation from the Runcandels for their work. It was the same for all knights in the Huphester Alliance.After ten minutes, a steel carriage belonging to the Runcandel Clan arrived at the VIP waiting hall.The person who brought the vehicle was the clan\u2019s second butler, Petro. Conveniently, he had come to the transfer gate to deliver some important documents.\u201cLady Luna! The main house was petrified because of your sudden disappearance. Where have you been? \u2026Huh? And Young Master Jin\u2026? Gilly?! Why are you with the eldest daughter?\u201dPetro\u2019s eyes widened.To his knowledge, these three people shouldn\u2019t be together. A provisional flag-bearer acting with the first flag-bearer was unacceptable.\u201c\u2026It seems there is some backstory to this nonsense. Well, let\u2019s go, Lady. There are too many eyes here. You guys go to the main house first and tell them the news.\u201dPetro looked around and told the guardian knights to go ahead. He was worried that there would be rumors of Luna being together with Jin.Clop, clop.The carriage began to move, and Petro still couldn\u2019t suppress his discomfort.\u2018What the hell is going on? At this rate, if Young Master Jin arrives at the house\u2026\u2019Then the Garden of Swords would definitely turn upside down.Luna\u2019s sudden disappearance was dismissable because it often happened.But a provisional flag-bearer returning without permission when it hadn\u2019t even been a month since they left?At that point, if blood dropped from the sky, nobody would be surprised.\u201cUh, Lady Luna, Young Master Jin! It may seem a little tactless, but I have something to ask.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re already making it awkward, so shut up. I\u2019m also very concerned.\u201d\u201cUnderstood\u2026\u201dUnaware of the embarrassment burning Petro from the inside, the carriage and its passengers departed for the Garden of Swords.\u2018We came here, but what should we do if Father gets furious? Do I have to pray that Gilly takes Jin and escapes while I block Father\u2019s attacks?\u2019There were too many stationed guardian knights to do that. Even without them, running away from the other Runcandel children was impossible for Gilly alone. Additionally, the nanny\u2019s power was currently being suppressed.As they got closer to the Garden of Swords, Luna got more and more uncomfortable.\u2018Whatever. Whatever happens, happens. There\u2019s no way Father will try to kill him, right? I mean\u2026 No, he definitely has the drive to do so.\u2019Luna gave up on thinking through the situation and stared at Jin.\u2018Even I\u2019m sweating from anxiety, but this kid is annoyingly straight-faced.\u2019In fact, Jin was leaning on a window, lost in thought. Of the things he planned to request from Cyron, he was deciding which would be more strategically advantageous for him.\u201cYoungest Brother.\u201d\u201cYes, Eldest Sister?\u201d\u201cYou better be really nice to me.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dThe carriage stopped.In the courtyard, there were countless swords with the hilt sticking out of the ground. A few servants were working about. The guardian knights on standby raised their swords in salute at the sight of the carriage\u2019s arrival.Petro opened the carriage door, and Luna stepped out.Subsequently, Gilly and Jin disembarked the carriage, startling the servants. Even the lowest-class servants expected something bad to happen in the near future.Receiving the reports from the guardian knights who left earlier on Petro\u2019s orders, Jin\u2019s siblings emerged from the residence.\u201cThis crazy bastard! Youngest Brother! Do you not have any respect or responsibility after leaving the house? How dare you enter the Garden of Swords as a provisional flag-bearer?!\u201dThe first one to exclaim was the fourth son, Vigo Runcandel. Next to him were the fourth and fifth daughters, Myu and Anne.\u201cProbably the result of Eldest Sister\u2019s kindness.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think Eldest Sister Luna can help you this time. This is really not okay.\u201dLuna, Jin, and Gilly stood still and remained silent.On the other hand, as the man who brought them here, Petro felt like he was sitting on thorns.\u2018Ha, they\u2019re getting scolded as expected!\u2019The servants couldn\u2019t even murmur. After some time, they stopped their work in the courtyard and frantically fled to safety.Jin\u2019s disobedience of the rules was that severe.From the residence, the second daughter Luntia, third daughter Mary, and second son Dipus emerged.\u201cWow\u2026 It\u2019s more shocking in person. What is it, youngest idiot? Are you forfeiting your chance of becoming a flag-bearer? Or is your puberty compelling you to commit suicide?\u201dDipus clicked his tongue and looked towards Mary. However, Mary did not respond and instead continued to glare at Jin.\u2018You dumbass\u2026 You can\u2019t come back yet. You have to get stronger and fight me someday.\u2019From the moment she gifted him the Phoenix Heart, she was awaiting a great battle with Jin. But now, with Jin standing before them, she could only be confused and disappointed.As the culprits stood like statues, Luntia sighed and walked towards them.\u201cEldest Sister Luna\u2026 for what reason did you bring him back?\u201dLuntia spoke with a soft tone, but her eyes held a cold, violent glare.\u201cI didn\u2019t bring him here. He brought himself.\u201d\u201cThen you should\u2019ve stopped him. Just because his head is empty doesn\u2019t mean you can just allow this!\u201dEven though Luntia shouted at her, Luna didn\u2019t really have anything to say.After all, she was more or less correct.\u201cWhatever. So, where\u2019s Father?\u201dAnnoyed, Luna turned her head away from all of the insults. Ever since she was young, Luna had a hard time dealing with Luntia, which explained why the second daughter was the only sibling who could talk to her in this manner.\u201cOh my. Did you really return to see Father?\u201d\u201cIndeed, Sister.\u201dLuntia facepalmed and spat some curses.If Luna wasn\u2019t there, the Runcandel siblings would\u2019ve ripped Jin to shreds.\u2018What a wonderful family.\u2019Jin sarcastically praised his family. Luntia shook her head and sighed.\u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do, big sister. You, youngest. I don\u2019t know why you even came to see Father, but brace yourself. Go ahead. He\u2019s in his study.\u201dJin moved his feet and Luna began to follow him.Shing!Along with the siblings, all of the guardian knights unsheathed their swords.\u201c\u2026As of now, please surrender your weapon and wait, first flag-bearer. There was a strict order from the patriarch that we must send Jin Runcandel alone.\u201dTheir father, the patriarch; the eldest daughter, the first flag-bearer.Luntia stopped screaming at Luna because she wanted to deal with this problem professionally. Additionally, it was on Cyron\u2019s orders.\u2018Ah, this isn\u2019t how I expected it to turn out.\u2019Luna thought. At this rate, if their father decides to kill Jin, she won\u2019t be there to become Jin\u2019s shield.\u201cAnd if I decline?\u201dAs Luna slowly reached for Crantel, a guardian knight stood behind Gilly and put a sword to her throat. Since her powers were still suppressed, she couldn\u2019t even react.\u201cPlease halt, first flag-bearer. It is the patriarch\u2019s orders.\u201d\u201cYou little\u2014! Put that sword away!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve crossed the line. If you don\u2019t offer a satisfactory discussion to Father, then you will not return alive. As for the first flag-bearer, you can\u2019t evade banishment.\u201d\u201cPlease surrender your weapon. If you resist, I will kill her.\u201dLuna gritted her teeth.\u2018We\u2019re doomed\u2026 Should I just escape with Jin? Damn it. I knew I didn\u2019t think this through. I didn\u2019t think anything would happen since I thought Father favored Jin\u2026!\u2019If she fought them and escaped, they were likely to succeed.However, she probably couldn\u2019t save Gilly and would live the rest of her life being chased by the Runcandel Clan.Of course, losing Luna\u2014who had become a 5-star knight at the age of 15, the genius among geniuses, and the strongest knight after Cyron\u2014would be a great loss for the clan.However, the Runcandel Clan wasn\u2019t a rational clan. Even though they would lose a significant amount of power as a consequence, the orders of the patriarch were absolute.At this point, Jin had no choice but to satisfy Cyron\u2019s will.Still, Jin was expressionless the entire time.\u201c\u2026Brothers, Sisters. It seems that you are all worked up. As a son\u2014as a member of the Runcandel Clan, I only came to report something to Father. Please calm yourselves.\u201dHis siblings held back their glares and lowered their voices.They were all just keeping an eye on Luna with a \u2018professional\u2019 attitude.\u201cEldest Sister Luna and Gilly, I apologize for putting you in such a situation.\u201dJin began to walk towards the residence.He did expect such a reaction from their family, but he would be lying if he said he wasn\u2019t nervous.\u2018My siblings don\u2019t know Father that well. It\u2019s against the rules for a provisional flag-bearer to return to the main house. But surprisingly, Father isn\u2019t that strict with rules.\u2019Either way, getting something from Cyron without any fear of danger was impossible. He couldn\u2019t evade the gamble.On top of that, after his regression, Jin thought that it was much easier to understand his Father.Usually, he couldn\u2019t even look his father in the eye. Now, however, Jin found it most comfortable when confronting him.\u2018If I just stay alert, then I can succeed. If he just gives me a chance to talk, I must.\u2019Phew.Jin took a deep breath as he arrived at the study\u2019s door and carefully knocked.Knock. Knock.Swoooooosh.Simultaneously, a blade beam flew past Jin\u2019s head\u2014undetectable to Jin at the moment.\u201cI guess I thought of you too highly. I\u2019m sure I gave you five years.\u201dCyron\u2019s booming voice followed soon after. The blade beam disintegrated the door to the study into dust.As he looked at his father, Jin felt himself smile internally.For some reason, his mind became calm the moment he saw Cyron. And the things he wanted to discuss constantly popped up in his mind.\u2018I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m sorry. I must maintain a confident attitude, but not to a point where it comes off as disrespectful.\u2019He immediately chose his response.\u201cI came because I wanted to see you again, Father.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83 \u2013 Meeting Cyron (3)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Fsssssshhh\u2026The former intact door\u2019s dust flew away silently.\u2018I\u2019ve heard about it many times. Father\u2019s blade beam is at the level of instantly disintegrating anything it touches.\u2019Since there were remnants of the object\u2014albeit in the form of dust\u2014saying that it was completely disintegrated was inaccurate. However, Cyron\u2019s swordsmanship was still composed of techniques that transcended humanity.In fact, he didn\u2019t even have his sword in his hand. Instead, at the tip of his fingers were the glowing embers of residual aura\u2014implying that he temporarily conjured a sword.Although the destroyed door was a murderous threat, Jin felt like he received a present.\u2018He was showing me a close-up of the edge of his sword.\u2019Cyron, with his eyes wide open, looked down upon Jin. This time, even Jin couldn\u2019t decipher his expression.\u2018Hm\u2026 Should I have greeted Father differently? Since my head is still intact, I don\u2019t think it was that bad\u2026\u2019And Cyron was doused with a strange feeling.For five minutes, none of them exchanged any words. The patriarch could only feel his throat drying up as he thought of his youngest son.It was because\u2026\u2018It\u2019s the first time I heard my child say that they missed me.\u2019His feelings were genuine, and Jin\u2019s words rendered him speechless.He had thirteen children, but they all just called him \u2018Father\u2019. Beyond that name, he had never formed relationships with them.The Runcandel children\u2019s childhoods were the nannies\u2019 responsibilities.And as soon as the children became one year old and completed the Selection Ritual, they would be sent to the Mitel Kingdom to spend their early years.After hitting the age of 10 and returning to the Garden of Swords, the children were bound to fear Cyron and Rosa.It was because they learned about their parents through different classes and lectures at the Storm Castle.Beyond being \u2018parents\u2019, they were the absolute rulers of the massive clan. In fact, they held power that could twist and turn the world. If possible, the children would be taught through blood and violence should they fail to produce good results.So, of course, Cyron and Rosa didn\u2019t expect any \u2018I wanted you see you\u2019 from their children after putting them into such an environment.All they wanted was to determine the next-in-line to the throne\u2014the one to continue Cyron\u2019s grand legacy of being the world\u2019s greatest swordsman.Only that was important.\u2018\u2026Not bad.\u2019It had been a long time since his heart was filled with emotion.Looking back, after rising to the demigod realm, it was his youngest son who always moved him.\u2018Although I praise you for moving your father\u2019s heart, that is still not enough. Alright, let\u2019s hear what you have to say.\u2019Cyron gently smiled.\u201cYou came to see me\u2026 Did you get infected with awkward familial love after drinking sewage water? I didn\u2019t expect that kind of response from you.\u201d\u2018Not a bad reaction!\u2019Ascertaining a good response, Jin lowered his head and continued to lie a little more.\u201cI didn\u2019t drink some sewage water. I have always loved you, Father.\u201dCyron suppressed his laughter and unleashed his Fatal Air, causing the air in the room to suddenly become as sharp as a knife. Every breath he took felt as if spikes were piercing through his lungs. Jin gritted his teeth in pain and met eyes with Cyron.\u201cEnough with the nonsense. State your reason for your return to the Garden. According to the quality of your response, you and your sister\u2019s fate will be sealed.\u201dAnd that was the truth.Cyron had full intentions of beheading Jin the moment he responded with \u2018some useless stuff\u2019. Then instantly erase Jin from his heart afterwards.The same way he slashed and killed his own siblings and companions before he became the patriarch.\u201cThe one who was insulted by you during the banquet, the Zipfels\u2019 second-in-command, has died.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you saying you killed him?\u201d\u201cNo, Father. A few days ago, Eldest Sister Luna killed him. And I was the one who called her. Would you allow me to state my experiences after being declared a provisional flag-bearer?\u201d\u201cA provisional flag-bearer receiving help from Luna\u2026 How insolent. Well, keep talking.\u201dFinding the story to be interesting, Cyron stroked his beard. Jin then explained his narrative from his days in Akin and Tikan, all the way to the events in the Vermont Empire.Of course, he didn\u2019t report every single thing. Jin made sure not to mention the suspicions of Spiderhand Alu having ties with a Runcandel, Myulta\u2019s Rune, Tzenmi\u2019s Tome, and his alliance with the Seven-Colored Peacock.\u201cIt seems you have experienced many things in a short period. So, you came to tell me that you killed Andrei Zipfel? Are you hoping that you caused some imbalance in the world after killing the second-in-command of a powerful clan?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not all, Father. After confronting him, I don\u2019t think that Andrei is the clan\u2019s true second strongest.\u201dCyron raised his eyebrow.\u201cHoh? And why is that?\u201d\u201cThere is no way that man is the second-in-command of the one clan that could destroy the Runcandels. Well, it\u2019s a hunch anyway.\u201d\u201cPrecisely. As you said, he is just second-in-command by name. He\u2019s not really the second strongest in the Zipfel Clan. There probably is another strong being after Kelliark. Though, it\u2019s not information that I could tell you now anyway.\u201d\u201cThank you for confirming my suspicions, Father. However, what I really wanted to tell you was regarding the existence of Andrei\u2019s strange artifact.\u201d\u201cArtifact?\u201d\u201cYes. An artifact called the Demon\u2019s God\u2019s Orb.\u201dJin continued explaining what he knew about the orb. He mentioned that it was a replica of an item of the gods called the Orb of Origin, and that it got stronger after each contractor it consumed.And surprisingly, Cyron was shocked. His eyes widened.\u201cA replica of the Orb of Origin\u2026 Is this true? There\u2019s no way you could identify the artifact\u2019s powers and abilities. It seems your guardian dragon, Murakan, informed you about this.\u201d\u201cYes, my guardian dra\u2014Huh? You knew that he had awakened?\u201dJin was startled and stared at his father.\u201cWould that be all that I know, I wonder? I also know that you are a magic-user. Did you think that you could fool me all this time?\u201d\u201cI, of course, knew that you would sense it, but I didn\u2019t know you detected Murakan\u2019s presence all this time.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dCyron burst into laughter. He wanted to laugh because he was proud of his son, and he couldn\u2019t hold it in much longer after the banter regarding Murakan.\u201cAs you said, I merely assumed Murakan\u2019s awakening! It\u2019s nice to see him figuring out things for himself. \u2018Nabi Runcandel\u2019? Kukuku\u2026 The great and powerful black dragon has plummeted to a housecat!\u201dJin couldn\u2019t laugh along with Cyron due to embarrassment.While feeling naked, Jin felt his ears burn up. He couldn\u2019t even tell his father to stop laughing.Instead, he scratched the back of his head.\u2018Is \u201cNabi Runcandel\u201d that funny? Well, at least the situation is unraveling well\u2026\u2019Cyron immediately stopped laughing and fixed his posture. The carefree mood instantly became as heavy as a boulder.\u201cA replica of the Orb of Origin. You have really brought a heavy case onto the table. I must talk with Luna who broke the artifact.\u201dCyron already knew about the Orb of Origin fairly well.\u2018I wonder if the Kings of the Black Sea know about this as well. I should return to the Black Sea. Certainly, that power is dangerous\u2026 but I don\u2019t know how well they mimicked the original.\u2019After rising to the demigod realm, Cyron spent most of his time in the Black Sea.He dueled the Kings of the Black Sea many times, and each king was a \u2018piece\u2019 of the Orb of Origin.\u201cJust this once, I will pardon you for breaking the rules. But you wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with just this, considering you physically came here instead of just telling me through a messenger.\u201dJin slightly bowed and Cyron gently grinned.\u201cDeclare your request.\u201dIt was all Jin wished for. Before Jin even proposed the deal, Cyron offered the gift before him.But Jin knew.\u2018Father wouldn\u2019t just let me walk away with something for free. Once I declare my request, he\u2019ll definitely add some terms and conditions\u2026!\u2019He had to think hard.If he asked for something too big, then the conditions would be too strict. But that didn\u2019t mean he could back off. The person sitting on the compromising end was Cyron.\u201cFor the time being, please do not allow any Runcandel to travel through the Free City of Tikan.\u201d\u201cTikan? Interesting.\u201dCyron\u2019s eyes glinted with an eerie light.\u2018Oho, youngest runt. You already made it your main base? The Free City of Tikan\u2026\u2019Living up to its name, Tikan was a land that wasn\u2019t affiliated with anyone\u2014be it the Runcandels, Zipfels, or the Vermont Imperial Family.Simultaneously, all three powers aimed to colonize that land. It wasn\u2019t for power or resources; attaining the Seven-Colored Peacock, intellectual prowess, and the trade center would be a wonderful three-in-one gain.It was just a free gold coin on the ground.Tikan wasn\u2019t worth fighting other clans to acquire the land, but it was still wasteful to leave such an easy acquisition alone.\u2018If he is settling there and has it as his main base, it is likely that Tikan would be under the Runcandel Clan after all of this. This baby couldn\u2019t have possibly already formed ties with Kashimir\u2026 Well, it\u2019s worth watching for a while.\u2019Cyron hid how proud he was of Jin\u2019s achievements and spoke.\u201cI shall accept your request if you pass the test I give you.\u201d\u201cYes, Father. Please tell me what kind of test it is.\u201d\u201cGhostblade Kashimir. Make him join you and prove to me that he is your ally. If you succeed, then no Runcandel will be able to step on Tikan without your permission.\u201dDoubting his ears, Jin let out a refreshing scream in his mind.After all, Kashimir was already Jin\u2019s ally.\u201cYes, Father. I already planned on establishing a strong and friendly rapport with him. Because just leaving Tikan untouched would be wasteful.\u201dAll this time, other provisional flag-bearers worked to raise their own name to fame.However, Cyron found Jin\u2019s attention towards the clan\u2019s strength to be very impressive and interesting.\u201cYou have one year. That insolent fool refused to become the instructor of the Runcandel cadet trainees multiple times\u2026 I\u2019ll see if you could coax him into your cause.\u201d\u201cI will bring him to you quickly.\u201d\u201cAlright, now proceed on your path.\u201dAfter bowing and exiting the study, Jin would\u2019ve hummed a song.\u2018Everything I did in my past life didn\u2019t go well, but this life is going pretty smoothly.\u2019However, when he reached the bottom of the stairs, his expression froze at the sight of two boys running towards him.\u201cJ-Jin! Are you okay\u2026?!\u201d\u201cDid Father say that he\u2019ll let you live? Why did you even do this?\u201dAfter Jin left the courtyard to see their father, the Tona twins were very concerned about his imminent death. However, they were afraid of their other siblings, so they stayed inside and bit their nails.\u201cYou guys act too cute sometimes. I\u2019m fine. Besides, I have a favor to ask.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84 \u2013 A Terrifying Clan[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u201cA f-favor\u2026?\u201dThe Tona twins tilted their heads.They were already astonished by their youngest sibling returning alive after meeting their father, but him asking for a favor out of nowhere was very confusing for them.\u201cOh, uh, it\u2019s nothing too grand. My faction\u2019s cadets\u2026 Until I come back, please take care of them. I\u2019ll also tell them myself before I leave.\u201dBefore the Tona twins could even respond, Jin walked away. He had to tell Luna and Gilly\u2014who were probably worried sick\u2014that he was okay.\u201cNothing changed about him\u2026 He came back from meeting Father, right?\u201d\u201cRight.\u201dWatching Jin\u2019s back, the Tona twins shrugged.\u201cWait, why are you worrying about him so much in the first place?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Whatever. Well, I guess he\u2019s gonna leave his faction\u2019s cadets to us. Hehe. I guess we gotta deal with the intermediate classes.\u201dOutside, the siblings guarding Luna and Gilly were shocked at the sight of Jin walking out of the doors unscathed.Myu and Anne especially\u2014who really wanted Jin to die\u2014grew pale in the face.\u201cIt seems like Father and the youngest had a nice talk. Now, why don\u2019t you move your sword? Before I kill all of you.\u201dAt Luna\u2019s low tone, her siblings and the guardian knights immediately lowered their weapons.The guardian knight who had a blade on Gilly\u2019s throat was about faint, eyes rolling back in the presence Luna\u2019s murderous glare.\u2018Damn, you little runt. You luckily survive each time\u2026!\u2019Myu and Anne thought while grinding their teeth.\u2018As expected, he\u2019s not a guy who would die that easily. Grow a little older and entertain your older sister!\u2019Mary grinned while looking at Jin.\u201cEldest Sister Luna, I think you should pay Father a visit. He seems to be curious about some things regarding the events of that day.\u201d\u201cAlright, I understand.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve also received some homework from him, so I will make a trip to the transfer gate. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\u201cTransfer gate? Hm, I don\u2019t know what kind of homework that is, but I\u2019ll see you.\u201dJin and Luna calmly exchanged words.In fact, the others had no idea what they were talking about.\u2018That day?\u2019\u2018A trip to the transfer gate? Wait, does that mean he\u2019s gonna come back?\u2019\u2018What does he mean by Father giving him homework?!\u2019And it wasn\u2019t anything to ask about either. The siblings could only exchange glances.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Gilly.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, Young Master!\u201dGilly never expected the situation to proceed smoothly, so she was still in a state of awe. They quickly left the Garden of Swords, and Luna proceeded to the study.All the rest of their siblings could do in the courtyard was to stand around and do nothing.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Three hours later, in Cyron\u2019s study.Although he didn\u2019t show it, Cyron was a little surprised that Jin confronted him with a confident expression.\u201c\u2026Just as I expected. You weren\u2019t startled at all after hearing the details about the test. Your confidence wasn\u2019t for nothing.\u201dCyron puffed a laugh and directed his eyes towards Kashimir.He had just traveled through the transfer gate to come to the Garden of Swords while hiding his identity.\u2018This man is the world\u2019s strongest knight, Cyron Runcandel\u2026 Errrrr, just meeting him is making my stomach ache.\u2019Kashimir had refused multiple offers of being the instructor of Runcandel\u2019s beginner class cadets.In the process of making Tikan a \u2018country\u2019, becoming an instructor in the Runcandel Clan would not help at all. Moreover, it would be a distraction from his main goals.Additionally, Cyron was \u2018someone he didn\u2019t want to meet\u2019. Though, Kashimir couldn\u2019t blame Cyron for feeling disrespected when he rejected the offer multiple times.Furthermore, if Cyron tried to ally with Tikan, Kashimir wouldn\u2019t have many ways to resist it.\u2018Well, I came because of Young Master Jin\u2019s favor\u2026 But it\u2019s very awkward. Have I been declining a favor from this person all this time?\u2019Actually seeing Cyron for the first time.The overwhelmingness was way beyond the rumors. Although Kashimir was also a pretty strong knight, he knew that his swordsmanship was child\u2019s play in the presence of Cyron.\u2018So this is the dignity of the absolute strongest\u2026 Still, let\u2019s keep our composure.\u2019Kashimir grew conscious of Jin\u2019s goals and fixed his posture.\u2018I am Young Master Jin\u2019s guest. There\u2019s no need to fear Lord Cyron\u2026\u2019\u201cSo you\u2019re Ghostblade Kashimir.\u201d\u201cY-Yes! However, it\u2019s embarrassing for Lord Cyron to call me Gh-Ghostblade, so p-please refrain from doing so!\u201dHe instinctively stuttered as he responded. He himself didn\u2019t even know what he was saying.Inside, he shed tears, and from the outside, sweat ran down his face. He didn\u2019t even feel embarrassed from the fact that Jin was right next to him.\u2018Give me a break. Last time I almost got beat by Sir Murakan. This time, it\u2019s showing disrespect towards Lord Cyron\u2026\u2019It seemed that after meeting Jin, he just kept meeting troublesome people.\u201cFather.\u201d\u201cProceed.\u201d\u201cTo describe my relationship with Sir Kashimir, we have intertwined fates\u2026 or something like that. Moving on, it is now your turn to keep your end of the promise.\u201dKashimir doubted his ears as he listened to Jin\u2019s perfectly enunciated speech.\u2018Young Master Jin, how are you so confident when talking to Lord Cyron? And having intertwined fates! I know I said that first, but if you say that in front of Lord Cyron\u2026!\u2019For a moment, multiple possible dark outcomes zipped through Kashimir\u2019s brain.Kashimir\u2026 So you and my son have intertwined fates? In that case, Tikan now belongs to the Runcandels.You share the same fate\u2026 The Runcandel Clan and Tikan can do that too, then.If that\u2019s so, starting today, the Runcandel Clan and the Free City of Tikan would also have intertwined fates. Hahaha!Kashimir envisioned Cyron in these horrific conversations.Of course, that was only a result of Kashimir\u2019s fear.\u201cYou petty runt\u2026 You dare trick your father?\u201dCompletely different from Kashimir\u2019s imagination, Cyron looked down on Jin with an undecipherable expression.In reality, Cyron was very satisfied. He didn\u2019t know what Jin did to meet Kashimir, but his youngest son was surpassing his expectations.\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018trick\u2019, Father? You\u2019re mistaken. I was merely lucky. In fact, as soon as I arrived in Tikan, we immediately formed relations.\u201d\u201cAlright. Anyways, you pass the test. Starting today, no Runcandel will step into Tikan without your permission. Even if that Runcandel is me.\u201d\u201cThank you, Father.\u201d\u201cIf that is all, you can go on ahead. I have other things to talk about with Kashimir.\u201dJin bowed and left the study.Being left with Cyron alone, Kashimir cleared his throat while looking at Jin\u2019s back, getting farther and farther.\u201cDon\u2019t get too nervous. You make it look as if I\u2019m going to eat you or something.\u201d\u201cH-Haha\u2026 I apologize. Lord Cyron, I\u2019ll be honest. Seeing you in-person, I cannot hide the respect and fear within me.\u201dCyron said nothing and walked towards the tea table. He brewed a cup of tea and handed it to Kashimir, who received the teacup with two hands.\u201cThe reason I dismissed the youngest and kept you here\u2026\u201dKashimir unintentionally gulped.\u2018Is he going to talk about forming an alliance? Or maybe to ask for the reason as to why I constantly declined the Runcandel instructor position offer?\u2019In the midst of his guest\u2019s fretting, Cyron continued.\u201c\u2026is because I wanted to request something from you.\u201dKashimir\u2019s heart sank at the word \u2018request\u2019. However, he reminded himself that he was going to be the leader of many and will soon become the ruler of a country.\u2018I can\u2019t act like an idiot. If he asks for Tikan, I have to firmly refuse!\u2019Strengthening his resolve, Kashimir looked Cyron in the eye.\u201cI am listening, Lord Cyron. If it\u2019s anything that doesn\u2019t harm Tikan, I am more than happy to help.\u201dHis response drew the line, but Cyron didn\u2019t really care. Kashimir calmed his burning insides and waited for Cyron\u2019s next response.\u201cFrom now on\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, Lord Cyron?\u201d\u201cPlease report my youngest son\u2019s progress whenever you can. I think he needs some supervision.\u201dIt was something completely unexpected.\u2018\u2026Well it isn\u2019t about an alliance, so that\u2019s good. And I can infer how much Lord Cyron cares for Young Master Jin.\u2019A Runcandel\u2014the\u00a0Cyron Runcandel\u2014cared for someone.He didn\u2019t expect this kind of favor. Kashimir began to wonder more about their father-son relationship.\u2018I knew something was off. Enough for Lord Cyron to request for supervision? According to the Seven-Colored Peacock\u2019s information, he doesn\u2019t even care about Joshua\u2014who is presumed to inherit the throne.\u2019Kashimir nodded.\u201cThat is not at all difficult, Lord Cyron. If you just establish a faster means of communication, then I will report every single bit of information.\u201dThis was an opportunity for Kashimir. It was a way for him to repay his debt to Cyron as well as a direct contact to the Runcandel Clan.Being able to contact Cyron Runcandel at will wasn\u2019t an easy feat. It was a special offer that even Emperor Vermont did not have.\u201cI am very grateful. I won\u2019t forget your kindness. And no one should know about this agreement.\u201d\u201cAffirmative. I will keep it a secret\u2014even to Young Master Jin.\u201d\u201cBefore you leave, a guardian knight named Khan will give you an address. Direct all your reports there. If there is a special conflict, please come here yourself and tell me. I will even offer you good wine.\u201d\u201cThank you, Lord Cyron.\u201d\u201cYou are dismissed.\u201dWhen Kashimir bowed and prepared to leave, Cyron opened his mouth once more.\u201cOh, and\u2026\u201d\u201cYes? I am listening.\u201d\u201cBrace yourself. The youngest said that he wasn\u2019t satisfied with just the Runcandel Clan. I am expecting great growth from you and Tikan. Enough for him to want your country.\u201dAfterwards, before they left for Tikan, Kashimir wasn\u2019t able to meet the guardian knight named Khan.\u2018I\u2019m pretty sure he said that he\u2019d establish a means of communication\u2026 Do I have to come back when Young Master Jin isn\u2019t present?\u2019Confused, he shoved his hands in his pockets and felt an unknown piece of paper.A note.(Greetings, Sir Kashimir. I am Khan, a Runcandel guardian knight. The patriarch\u2019s address is\u2026)Kashimir didn\u2019t notice that Khan had already approached him and slipped the note into his pocket when he wasn\u2019t looking.Realizing how quickly executed the action was, goosebumps raised on Kashimir\u2019s skin.\u2018It means that they could easily get rid of me without anyone noticing. The Runcandel Clan\u2026 truly is a terrifying clan.\u2019Kashimir turned his head towards Jin, who could possibly become the next patriarch of the said fearsome clan.\u201cHow does it feel knowing that Tikan is guaranteed to be free from any Runcandel, Sir Kashimir?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m very confused at this very moment, but I really look forward to the things about to come.\u201dKashimir frantically hid the note and grinned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 \u2013 Take Down Alisa! (1)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Early August of 1795, the Zipfel Press finally officially declared the death of the second-in-command Andrei Zipfel, and his dragon, Vyuretta.Despite the official declaration, the cause of death wasn\u2019t clarified. Even the date of death was made up. Additionally, Quikantel\u2019s or Jin\u2019s name was not mentioned anywhere.Nonetheless, it was groundbreaking news.The Runcandels, Vermont Imperial Family, and other powers including the Hidden Palace heightened their senses and watched the situation unravel.In light of the news, many rumors spread amongst the people. Rumors that he was killed off for losing in political disputes, or that he lost in a heated duel against a grand magician named \u2018Cold Joe\u2019. Or that Emperor Vermont ordered the Vermont Special Forces to assassinate him.However, the more popular rumor was \u2018the flag-bearers of the Runcandel Clan killed him.\u2019 There was also \u2018the Master of the Hidden Palace, Talaris Endorma, assassinated him\u2019, though that one didn\u2019t gain too much attention.Of course, the official location of death was a remote island in the Vermont Empire, and at the time, the flag-bearers of the Runcandel Clan were at the Garden of Swords. On top of that, the Zipfel Clan and Vermont Imperial Family weren\u2019t able to identify the mana that would have proven Luna\u2019s involvement.But to the masses, the truth didn\u2019t matter.They thought that the more interesting narrative deserved to be the truth\u2014more than the truth itself.\u2018Will the Runcandels begin to dominate the entire world?\u2019After the press release, bar regulars endlessly debated.Which is stronger\u2014swords or magic?Many thought that the Runcandels and the Zipfels would finally start a war. They definitely believed that Andrei\u2019s killer was a Runcandel.And it wasn\u2019t only the commoners who found interest in foreign politics, but also the nobles and soldiers.Especially the neutral powers who were not directly affiliated with the Runcandel Clan, Vermont Imperial Family, the Zipfel Clan, or other big clans.Just like the Hidden Palace, they maintained a \u2018neutral\u2019 state. But unlike the Hidden Palace, smaller clans couldn\u2019t defend themselves in an emergency.Which basically compelled them to take a side between the Runcandels and Zipfels.If a war broke out between swords and magic, the neutral states in the gray region would become of leaves being swept away should they get caught in the middle of it.And surprisingly, the neutral powers sought for the sword more than magic.They all huddle towards the Runcandel Clan instead of the Zipfel Clan despite the latter being deemed the strongest at the moment.\u201cLord Patriarch, today, the Schucheron Kingdom\u2019s prince and five second-class mercenary troops requested protection from the clan. Following the death of Andrei, it seems we get protection requests every day. The rumors sure do seem scary.\u201dThe Runcandels\u2019 first-class butler, Heinz, had been reporting similar information for the fourth day in a row.\u201cReturn all of their gifts and tell them that the request will be fulfilled. And make sure to offer the Schucheron prince a fine sword to make sure he inherits the throne.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. I will send an 8-star guardian knight.\u201d\u201cAlright, you\u2019re dismissed.\u201dAs long as the requester was not an immediate enemy to Cyron, he accepted any favor.Although the \u2018neutral\u2019 clans didn\u2019t have any presence in the world and didn\u2019t really support the Runcandels at all, the smaller clans would be something of use once the clan of swordmasters take down the Zipfels and become the ruler of the world.As more and more clans sought to ally with the Runcandel Clan, more rumors spread amongst the common folk\u2014that the Zipfels can no longer overtake the Runcandels. And the fact that all of the neutral forces sided with the Runcandel Clan made the rumor seem all the more likely.\u2018I believe this is because of the youngest\u2019s horseplay on that remote island. Some kind of butterfly effect. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s hearing these rumors in Tikan as well.\u2019Cyron thought about his son as Heinz left.Of course, the rumors of the Runcandels surpassing the Zipfels was merely a rumor. The Zipfel Clan was doing pretty well, and the truth was that the Runcandel Clan was only a little ahead.\u2018We were able to absorb many neutral forces recently. That provisional flag-bearer is already making big changes for the clan. He\u2019s a very interesting fellow\u2026\u2019Cyron grinned and summoned Guardian Knight Khan.\u201cAt your service, Lord Patriarch.\u201d\u201cAny messages from Kashimir?\u201dKhan could barely contain his surprise.\u2018I knew Young Master Jin was special ever since the Storm Castle\u2026 but I never would\u2019ve thought that the Lord Patriarch would give him so much attention. He\u2019s itching to know!\u2019It was Khan\u2019s first time seeing Cyron like this. When Joshua became a 9-star knight, Cyron didn\u2019t even flinch.\u201cThere were none, Lord Patriarch.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 Alright.\u201dCyron responded with disappointment, and Khan lowered his head as if it was his fault.\u201cThe day after tomorrow, I will be leaving for the Black Sea once again. If there are any reports on him, come find me and inform me.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *After coming back from the Garden of Swords, Jin\u2014who Cyron yearned to hear about\u2014dedicated his time to personal training.\u2018If it wasn\u2019t for Eldest Sister Luna, I would\u2019ve died on the island in the Vermont Empire.\u2019After his regression, although his swordsmanship and magic had reached 5-star, and his spiritual energy would soon reach 5-star\u2026\u2018Considering the events coming soon\u2026 It\u2019s not enough.\u2019Which made Jin feel impatient.He felt it the most after the fight on the island. Although he was very talented and strong in terms of a 15-year-old, there weren\u2019t many enemies that he could face by himself.\u2018I need to get stronger. In the five years that my father gave me, I need to get strong enough to take down all of my siblings\u2014enough to not need anyone\u2019s help!\u2019And Luna, especially, motivated him.An opponent who Murakan and Quikantel couldn\u2019t land a finger on was defeated with a single slash of a sword\u2026 She looked like the god of battle.However, even the god of battle went to the Garden of Swords, dropped her weapon, and got humiliated. Just because she had to save someone weaker.Jin\u2019s enemies were like that\u2014targeting his companions first so they couldn\u2019t help him.Swoosh!Bradamante swept through the air violently.After slashing over ten thousand times, his muscles felt like exploding, and his bones felt like shattering.However, Jin felt worry more than pain.\u2018Although Mind\u2019s Eye is still beyond my reach\u2026 In five years, I must reach the Mind\u2019s Blade Absolute Realm that eldest sister showed me.\u2019Mind\u2019s Blade: Blood Moon.It was not a Runcandel secret technique, but a domain that Luna experienced on her own while surpassing Mind\u2019s Eye.A realm that could be awakened by casting Divine Language on the sword, Mind\u2019s Blade. Every knight\u2019s dream. If Luna hadn\u2019t realized the special techniques and secrets of her red aura, she would\u2019ve never achieved Mind\u2019s Blade.\u2014For you, you can definitely get there in five years. First, to awaken your Divine Language, you need to practice expressing your fervor in your sword.\u2014The way to do that is\u2026\u2014If you swing your sword ten thousand times, it means that your first and last swing must be similar in terms of effort and technique.That was what Luna told him.\u2018Then, is one thousand consistently identical swings my limit right now?\u2019After passing the fifteen thousand mark, he could no longer tell whether he was swinging the sword or the sword was swinging him.\u201cPlease stop, Young Master Jin.\u201dKashimir was right next to Jin just as he prepared for another swing.\u201cPhew. Sir Kashimir.\u201d\u201cEven when I trained, I never trained as hard as you\u2026 If you do this every day, even if you have the Runcandel Clan\u2019s blessed physique, nothing will be left of you.\u201dEnya\u2014who followed behind Kashimir\u2014handed the young Runcandel a towel.\u201cLord Jin! Your face looks dead. W-Wait, oh heavens. Lord Jin, your hand is all torn! There\u2019s blood all over the floor! Uwaaah.\u201dJust like she said, below Jin was a small puddle consisting of blood and sweat\u2014strands of red swirling in the clear water.While Enya wiped Jin\u2019s face and called for healers, Kashimir kept his eyes on the puddle.\u2018What kind of resilience is this\u2026? It\u2019s nothing I\u2019ve ever seen from a fifteen year old boy.\u2019Healing magicians rushed over and began to cast healing spells onto Jin\u2019s hands. The young Runcandel just sat down, staring at his palms.\u201cMy apologies for causing a mess, Sir Kashimir, Enya.\u201d\u201cWhy would you abuse those beautiful hands! I-I think I see some b-bones\u2026?\u201dJin had calluses all over his hands, having held a sword ever since his youth. However, to a fanatic like Enya, it looked like a beautiful sculpture.The healing magicians left, and Kashimir sat next to Jin.\u201cThe reason you are doing all this\u2026 must be because of the events on the island?\u201d\u201cIndeed. Not only because of Andrei and his companion. There would have been too many potentially dangerous moments if it wasn\u2019t for Gilly or Murakan. In order to not become a burden to my allies, I must train harder.\u201d\u201cLord Jin is the same age as I am. Don\u2019t be too impatient. I\u2019ll be sad.\u201d\u201cNo, Miss Enya. Young Master Jin is judging himself from a cynical perspective.\u201dKashimir responded, and Enya was startled.\u201cYou\u2019re too mean, Sir Kashimir. Lord Jin is\u2014\u201d\u201cJust like you said, he is very strong. Amongst 15-year-olds, he\u2019s probably the strongest. However, I understand Young Master Jin\u2019s intent. The opponents he will face will neither be young nor normal.\u201dJin slowly nodded.\u201cBut Young Master Jin, impatience is the poison to your growth. It could make your straight path and progress make a turn. Though, Miss Gilly had been saying the same thing every day.\u201dAs Kashimir said, Gilly also told Jin the same advice every day. That he should slow down a little, or that he\u2019s pushing his limits too much.\u201cI know well enough about that, but after making up my mind, stopping myself isn\u2019t easy. I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201d\u201cNo need for embarrassment. I find it incredible that you are executing a volume of training that no one else can. Instead, how about some training that could cool your mind?\u201d\u201cTraining that could cool my mind\u2026?\u201dKashimir grinned.\u201cHow about a spar?\u201d\u201cWith you?\u201dKashimir shook his head.\u201cNo. You\u2019re still lacking a little to spar against me, so that\u2019s for another time\u2014for when you get stronger.\u201dDespite his words, Kashimir still wasn\u2019t able to notice Guardian Knight Khan sneaking and slipping a note into his pocket.However, that was just Khan being incredible. It wasn\u2019t that Kashimir was weaker. After all, the nickname \u2018Ghostblade\u2019 wasn\u2019t just given to him for free.\u201cWithin six months, please try to defeat my wife, Alisa Betzer, using all that you\u2019ve got\u2014sword, magic, and spiritual energy. I can guarantee you, this will be a good learning experience for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 \u2013 Take Down Alisa! (2)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Alisa Betzer.Along with a massive physique, she had a knife scar on her left eye. She was also Tikan\u2019s Chief of Defense and Ghostblade Kashimir\u2019s wife.\u2018Take that person down in six months?\u2019At first glance, she already looked stronger than the criminals in Mamit. Her bulky build made her two times bigger than Kashimir\u2014anything but normal.But was she really that strong?Jin had swordsmanship, magic, and spiritual energy. Would it really take six months?He had seen her every day for a month after he arrived in Tikan. They ate breakfast at the same table and also bantered every now and then.He didn\u2019t truly feel that she was strong.\u2018I know that she\u2019s a unique person\u2026 but will fighting her really be hard when I have magic and spiritual energy? I even defeated a 7-star knight with the use of all my skills. I\u2019m sure Sir Kashimir knows that she\u2019s at my level.\u2019Despite the doubt, he knew it was going to be fun after seeing Kashimir\u2019s confidence in his wife.\u201cLady Alisa, you say\u2026 If you say so, there must be a reason. Alright, I will try sparring her. As long as she agrees.\u201d\u201cShe most certainly will. She was getting bored from the lack of fights after becoming the chief of defense. A duel against you will be a great gift for her.\u201dAs Kashimir said, Alisa showed a refreshed expression as soon as they asked her. She excitedly accepted.\u201cMe? With Young Master Jin? Haha! Sounds fun. Fighting shriveled criminals was getting boring. Well, I don\u2019t see any anymore, since I caught all of them\u2026\u201d\u201cMommy and Mister Jin fighting?\u201dEuria, who was in Alisa\u2019s arms, trembled with tears of worry rolling down her face.\u201cNo, we\u2019re not fighting. We\u2019re\u2026 strengthening our friendship.\u201d\u201cBut everyone who fought mommy lost\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 Anyway, if we strengthened our friendship, who would you cheer for?\u201d\u201cUhmm\u2026 I want Mister Jin to win.\u201d\u201cThey said that teaching children would be futile\u2026 You little brat. Good 5-year-olds would cheer for their mother.\u201dAlisa jokingly spoke and bit her child\u2019s cheek, and Euria\u2019s next words temporarily made Jin forget how to speak.\u201cBut, but! Mister Jin is much weaker. I will always be on the weak people\u2019s side! For people who are weak and suffering!\u201d\u201cPfffffffffffahahahaha.\u201dMurakan\u2014who was reading an erotic novel on a nearby sofa\u2014sat himself up and burst into laughter.\u201c\u2018Weak and\u2026 suffering Mister Jin.\u2019 Hehehehe. Ice cream runt, you already know how to judge people! As expected from Az Mil\u2019s contractor.\u201dWith an awkward smile, Jin silently walked over to Murakan and tried to dig his heel into the dragon\u2019s foot. Murakan managed to slip his foot out in time, but that didn\u2019t stop Jin from snatching his book.\u201cYou fu\u2014I mean, bad dragon. Didn\u2019t I say not to read this kind of stuff in front of a child?\u201d\u201cI purposefully chose the one with small text and archaic dialect and have been reading it secretly ever since. Put it down, while I\u2019m asking nicely.\u201d\u201cWhere do you keep getting these things? I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t have anything like this when we first left the Garden of Swords.\u201dKashimir cleared his throat in guilt.He had been sourcing five erotic novels every week for Murakan. The great black dragon requested it, so as a mere mortal, he could not refuse.\u201cEhem! Anyways, how about you start sparring the day after tomorrow, Young Master Jin?\u201d\u201cFor the next six months, let\u2019s spar every day after I return from work and eat dinner. I should show you why I am Tikan\u2019s Chief of Defense.\u201d\u201cEvery day? That\u2019s fine with me, but I think I would be taking too much of your time.\u201dAlisa smiled and shook her head.\u201cNo worries. For the time being, it will end quickly.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Two days later at the underground sparring room in Kashimir\u2019s mansion.In order to improve his body\u2019s condition, he had taken a two-day break from his personal training. And since he was in his best condition for their first spar, he planned to compare and inspect his subsequent results.Alisa stood in front of Jin as she loosened her body and spoke.\u201cYoung Master Jin. Before we begin, I would like to mention something.\u201d\u201cPlease go on, Lady Alisa.\u201d\u201cI was in the Vermont Special Forces. Before Kashimir became the Fallen Prince, I was his bodyguard. We left together when he was banished from the Vermont Imperial Family.\u201dHearing that, Jin instantly understood why he could feel her radiating strength.Unlike the Vermont Empire Imperial Guards, the Vermont Special Forces needed to operate in the shadows. Thus, the first thing they learned was how to conceal their strength.\u2018I expected something like this, but a former Special Forces knight\u2026 Kashimir didn\u2019t say six months for nothing.\u2019Jin knew that the Vermont Special Forces\u2019 units were at least 6-stars.However, that was merely a minimum. If she had guarded \u2018Prince\u2019 Kashimir, she was definitely at least a 7-star.\u201cOn that topic, please don\u2019t feel down from losing too much. Also, I don\u2019t plan on going easy on you. So, shall we begin?\u201dThe instant Jin nodded\u2026Whoooosh!Alisa closed the gap between them\u2014her fist right in front of Jin\u2019s face. Her movement\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t one that a regular 5-star knight could react to.She planned on finishing the first battle with one strike.Even though it was just a spar, fighting as if it was the real thing was her ideology.\u2018For the past two days, I\u2019ve asked Sir Murakan and Miss Gilly about Young Master Jin\u2019s past. And from what they said, all he needs is a humiliating failure and the process of standing up against it. For at least ten days, you won\u2019t be able to dodge the first strike.\u2019From what she heard, there was always an \u2018opportunity\u2019 and a \u2018variable\u2019 in all the dangerous situations that Jin got in.When he fought Alu, he had a variable called Myulta\u2019s Rune.When he fought Quikantel, he was able to cut her wing when she least expected it.And very recently, when he fought Andrei, he was only able to swing his sword because Murakan and Luna were there.As for his fight against Quazito Truka of the White Wolf Tribe, if he knew that Jin had spiritual energy, then he wouldn\u2019t have lost.Hence, all of Jin\u2019s opponents either let their guard down or did not have enough information on him.On the other hand, Alisa knew all about Jin\u2019s abilities. Swordsmanship, magic, and spiritual energy, and also the fact that he had Myulta\u2019s Rune.Therefore, Alisa decided to show him the reality of being exposed to \u2018true danger\u2019. For a knight to become stronger, the best way was to simulate danger.And so, Alisa aimed her fist at Jin\u2019s face.However, it met the surface of a scabbard instead.\u2018He blocked it?!\u2019Alisa\u2019s eyes widened.It wasn\u2019t completely blocked, though. Through the scabbard, the shockwave traveled to Jin\u2019s body and instinctively made him back off.The staggering made him lose the ability to defend or dodge. There was nothing worse than losing your balance in a battle. Alisa could easily take him out with one more blow.Although, she could only be surprised after being denied a direct attack.\u2018I\u2019m sure it was at a speed that he couldn\u2019t react to\u2014even accounting for his blessed Runcandel physique. Did I get slower? I think I felt like my punches got minisculely slower.\u2019Jin was still defenseless. He hadn\u2019t even drawn his sword, yet Alisa\u2019s second fist was already about to make contact with his ribs.Then, he activated Myulta\u2019s Rune and wore the helmet.Along with it, he unleashed a spell that he prepared before coming to the underground training area.\u2018Photon Cannon!\u2019Flash\u2026!Even for a trained knight, closing one\u2019s eyes due to a blinding flash of light was inevitable. Even in a moment before defeating the opponent.\u201cErk!\u201dPow!Because of the bright light, her stance faltered, causing her punch to not go as expected.Still, it was enough for one of Jin\u2019s ribs to be blown. The light couldn\u2019t change the fact that the punch was enough to end the battle.Before following up with a third strike, Alisa felt admiration for her opponent.\u2018All of those opportunities and variables weren\u2019t from luck. He purposely created all of them! I would\u2019ve never expected him to prepare a spell.\u2019It was the same this time.Simply put, Alisa lost in the battle of strategy.\u2018I get it now. Blocking my first attack\u2026 and using magic to decrease the density of the ground. Because of that, I couldn\u2019t harness my true speed.\u2019When she looked behind her, she found a deep hole at the spot where she stood beforehand. It was a microscopic difference.If Jin had tampered more with the floor, she would\u2019ve noticed before the approach. A knight like her would notice such subtleties.\u2018It\u2019s alright. It\u2019ll all be over soon.\u2019Jin knew that, when he faced Alisa, the fight would be over in seconds.Before the battle began, he constantly thought of the different variables that could affect their fight. Ultimately, all of the variables he tweaked worked to some extent.But not enough to take down the chief of defense.Crack!The third punch was sent straight into his hip. Jin flew about three meters and lay on the floor, and a shock went through Alisa\u2019s body.Not because of her sweet victory, but because she was amazed at how much Jin surprised her on the first day.\u201cDamn\u2026 Little clever tricks weren\u2019t enough.\u201d\u2018Tricks?\u2019Alisa was about to correct his word choice. This wasn\u2019t some trick but an actual, elaborate plan.\u201cRemarkable, Young Master Jin. I would\u2019ve never thought I needed to attack thrice.\u201dJin fell back to the ground, struggling to stand up.Just like Alisa, he was also in shock.\u2018As expected from a former Vermont Special Forces knight. All of my variables worked, but I couldn\u2019t even draw my sword.\u2019He was disappointed and upset, but his heart was still pumping.It was the first time he completely failed, even with his little gimmicks.And as Kashimir mentioned, his mind cooled off.\u201cSo, uh, Lady Alisa.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master Jin?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to call\u2026 a doctor?\u201d\u201cOh my, what am I doing? You must be severely injured. Please wait a moment!\u201dAlisa frantically ran out, and Jin smirked.\u2018I will take her down in less than six months\u2019 time.\u2019Compared to learning and mastering Mind\u2019s Blade, defeating Alisa before the aforementioned time was a very attainable goal. In Jin\u2019s heart, a great fervor for achievement roared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 \u2013 Take Down Alisa! (3)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]September 27th, 1795.The unsupervised land in the east, also known as the Black Sea.Four days had already passed since Guardian Knight Khan arrived. Which meant that he hadn\u2019t slept a wink for the past four days. He had slashed through more than five hundred monsters along the way.Even the weakest among the Black Sea\u2019s monsters were incomparably stronger than the monsters in known lands. It was because these monsters grew up breathing pure evil energy.Even for a guardian knight like Khan, the slightest mistake could easily result in death\u2014such was the dangers of the Black Sea.Slash! Slash!Although he had an emotionless expression, he couldn\u2019t hide his dead, tired eyes.He felt like there were more monsters than usual.\u2018I wonder\u2026 What kind of information is written on this letter?\u2019Khan was suffering like this because he had to deliver a letter from Kashimir to Cyron. It was the first after being informed of the secret address.\u2018I\u2019m sure it\u2019s about the Youngest Master\u2019s growth\u2026 But it\u2019s only been a month. Has there been rapid and important growth? Enough to report to the patriarch?\u2019He could only wonder.Since Khan\u2019s cadet days in the Runcandel Clan and being named a \u2018monster\u2019 by his friends, he remembered the tough and strenuous times he went through when he tried to break through the 5-star barrier.\u2018There\u2019s no way he already achieved 6-star, right? Phew\u2026 I hope Lord Patriarch tells me the information as well.\u2019Khan charged forward and fought more monsters for five hours.Soon after, he finally found Cyron sitting in the middle of the Black Sea.\u201cGreetings to the patriarch. This is Khan.\u201dCyron\u2014who had already detected Khan\u2019s presence\u2014slowly opened his eyes. Khan proceeded to salute him. The patriarch raised his hand and waved it in a circle.As he moved his hand in the air, all of the monsters in the area fled away, scattering as if they were bugs sprayed with bug repellent.A display of the Genesis Knight\u2019s power and dignity.Though, in reality, he was suppressing his happiness.\u2018It must be about the youngest\u2026!\u2019Khan handed the letter over with two hands.\u201cA letter from Sir Kashimir arrived ten days ago. I tried to come as fast as possible, but the monsters were very aggressive. I apologize for my incompetence.\u201dCyron received the letter with a frown.\u2018I should take some time and kill off some of the monsters in the area. If it weren\u2019t for them, I would\u2019ve received this a day earlier.\u2019Sssst.With a flick of a finger, Cyron ripped the letter\u2019s seal. The envelope was quite thick.Like an elder who found old diary entries, Cyron began to attentively read.(To the admired Lord Cyron.As a knight of a small city, I am ineffably honored to flip my pen and send a letter to Your Honor.How is the weather in the Garden of Swords?In the Free City of Tikan, it is currently dusk. The soft clouds like velvet, high in the sky, with stars sprinkled here and there, and they seem to sing of your greatness.I will say it once more.I, Kashimir Alfleon, am very thankful and honored that you offered a mere knight an opportunity to send a heart-filled letter. I hope the deep effort poured into each character satisfies you\u2026)Cyron flinched.\u2018I also felt it last time, but this guy has a problem\u2026 Why is this introduction so long?\u2019He was very annoyed, but with the patience of a Genesis Knight, he turned the page. However, the next page was also filled with greetings and thanks, and there wasn\u2019t even a single sentence about Jin on the third.\u201cHaaa\u2026\u201dCyron sighed and shook his head, and Khan suddenly felt like it was his fault.\u2018The patriarch is\u2026 angry. Did something happen to Young Master Jin?\u2019But then, on the fourth page, Cyron\u2019s expression brightened a little. His eyes began to sparkle, and he slowly began to grin.\u201cHoho.\u201dHe even laughed a little.Khan had been Cyron\u2019s bodyguard for the past twenty years, but it was his first time seeing the patriarch like this. After Luna declared that she wasn\u2019t interested in inheriting the throne, Cyron was always cold with his children.Thus, Khan was dying from curiosity. What happened to Young Master Jin to make the patriarch that happy?\u201cKhan.\u201d\u201cYes, Lord Patriarch?\u201d\u201cIt seems that the youngest is getting beat by Kashimir\u2019s wife. Ahahaha. From the time he wrote this letter, it looks like they sparred at least forty times and Jin lost all of them.\u201dKhan couldn\u2019t believe his ears.Usually, Cyron would click his tongue and call his child weak and powerless, but Khan was surprised that he was amused by the news.\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of losses.\u201d\u201cThe first battle lasted three seconds, and the second lasted five. The seventh lasted ten seconds, the twentieth lasted twenty-five, and the thirtieth lasted forty.\u201d\u201cI can see how the young master withstands against a 7-star using magic and spiritual energy. In fact, if it\u2019s against the same person, he will gradually survive longer.\u201dBecause Khan was Cyron\u2019s most prized and trusted guard, he knew all of Jin\u2019s secrets as well.Of course, he would never reveal such secrets. Even if Cyron were to unreasonably fire him.\u201cIndeed. But do you know what happened in the fortieth battle?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cHe lasted over 120 seconds. He overcame a barrier\u2014realized something.\u201dAlthough it was incredible for a 5-star to make so much progress against a 7-star, Khan knew that it wasn\u2019t only because of his improved swordsmanship.Khan\u2019s eyes widened as Cyron continued relaying the contents of the letter.\u201cAnd it says here that Kashimir\u2019s wife, Alisa Betzer, is a former Vermont Special Forces agent. The 2nd Division. Hoho, now I can only laugh. It has definitely been a while since her retirement, so she\u2019s probably rusty. Still, it\u2019s nice of her to volunteer.\u201dThe Vermont Special Forces.Amongst the Forces, the division tasked with protecting the Imperial Family was the 2nd Division, and Khan knew well of their strengths.\u201c\u2026If she was previously in the Special Forces 2nd Division\u2026 She\u2019s not an opponent that the young master can use tricks and gimmicks on. I congratulate your son, Lord Patriarch.\u201d\u201cSince he hasn\u2019t even defeated her, it\u2019s too early to celebrate. Kashimir said that he gave the youngest six months. To defeat her, that is.\u201d\u201cAt this rate, he\u2019ll succeed before the time period ends.\u201d\u201cIf that runt was the first child, I would\u2019ve left the clan in his hands without remorse. What a shame. Khan, what do you think of the youngest?\u201d\u201cI concur. If he were the firstborn, then Master Joshua would\u2019ve been superseded by Young Master Jin.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that.\u201dKhan was startled and stared at Cyron.\u201cDo you mean\u2026 as a successor?\u201dCyron nodded.Khan was surprised, but not because of Jin\u2019s measly age of 15.\u2018This is the first time the patriarch talked about his desired successor\u2026!\u2019Cyron had never chosen a successor. Although he looked forward to some of his children\u2014like Luna\u2014this was the first time he explicitly stated his opinion.People only thought of Joshua as the first successor candidate after Luna\u2019s refusal of inheritance, but Cyron never truly selected him.The same went for the other successor candidates\u2014Mary, Dipus, and Luntia.After reorganizing his thoughts, Khan spoke.\u201cI think he needs a little more observation due to his young age. Although he is growing and learning very quickly, I don\u2019t think he is suited for the throne just yet.\u201d\u201cAnd why do you think that?\u201d\u201cHe lacks coldness. The story of the Young Master\u2019s journey to save the beginner cadets was from his personality. I can see that he has a very kind and malleable heart.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. On the other hand, Joshua is the opposite. The youngest often showed weakness towards relationships and attachments. How about when you ignore all of that?\u201d\u201cWhen needed, he must be cold enough to get rid of his own sister, and with his current growth rate, he will be perfect for your position.\u201dSatisfied with the guardian knight\u2019s answer, Cyron grinned.\u201cIndeed, that is what a Runcandel is. You are dismissed.\u201d\u201cYes, Lord Patriarch.\u201dHe had fought and slashed through monsters for four days to get there, but as soon as the order was heeded, Khan immediately began to walk the exact same path that he came from.To exit Cyron\u2019s domain, he would have to slash and kill monsters for another four days.Before he drew his sword, a thought occurred to him.\u2018Did the patriarch smile because he looked forward to Young Master Jin transcending the Runcandels\u2019 ancestors?\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Mid-November, 1795.Three months had passed since Jin\u2019s quest to defeat Alisa.No longer did he pre-cast spells before the fight.\u201cWhew! Young Master Jin. Today was also a close game.\u201dAt the 95th battle, Alisa wiped her forehead after knocking down Jin.\u201cHaha, you said that yesterday as well. This makes it 95 losses. It\u2019s kinda depressing\u2026\u201d\u201cThe small differences will accumulate. And now, you can fight me for at least fifteen minutes. Anyways, Young Master Jin, are you going to do \u2018that\u2019 before returning?\u201d\u201cYes. Please go on ahead, Lady Alisa.\u201dTired from watching, Alisa shook her head.Since one week ago, after each battle, Jin only left the training area after completing ten thousand swings.Ten. Thousand.\u2018I must channel my will through the sword\u2026\u2019A realm that could be awakened when the first and last of ten thousand swings were identical. While training with Alisa, Jin could enact the same swing three thousand times. Even with an exhausted body.\u2018This isn\u2019t about physical strength. Whether I am exhausted or perfectly fine, the importance is in the transferring of one\u2019s will into the blade.\u2019Jin took his stance for the long haul, and Alisa exited the sparring room.\u2018Whew, I didn\u2019t think he would catch up this fast. Watching that toxic amount of training\u2026 He makes me feel like I\u2019m not trying hard enough.\u2019Alisa watched Jin train for a while, then she slowly closed the door.\u201cHe truly deserves to be stronger.\u201dShe never would have expected what awaited her the next day.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88\u00a0 \u2013 Take Down Alisa! (4)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u2018Did the anxiety and nervousness slowly recede after each and every spar?\u2019The next day, during the 96th spar, Alisa finally lost to Jin. As the battle reached the 70-second mark, Jin\u2019s stab penetrated her shoulder.\u201cErk!\u201dThe moment his attack succeeded, they were both very surprised.In fact, it was a wound that was severe enough to prevent Alisa from continuing the battle. Jin dropped his sword and frantically called a healer, and Alisa smiled awkwardly.\u201cLady Alisa! Are you alright?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Yeah, I\u2019m fine. I haven\u2019t had this kind of injury in a while.\u201dBlood spilled all over the place. While the healers cast healing magic, Jin tilted his head.\u2018It wasn\u2019t an attack that Lady Alisa couldn\u2019t dodge. This is a victory born from luck.\u201dAnd it was true.Jin hadn\u2019t given his full effort yet. When training with Alisa, he often played his final trump cards after the 100-second mark.In other words, Jin always beat Alisa in the \u2018Analysis Phase\u2019. Though, this time wasn\u2019t because of his growth, but because of his opponent\u2019s mistake\u2014so today\u2019s victory wasn\u2019t as sweet.\u2018I temporarily lost vision from the spiritual energy and failed to read his sword\u2019s movements\u2026 I can\u2019t believe I made this mistake. I guess I got pretty rusty after retiring.\u2019Maintaining the same amount of focus while fighting an opponent who she beat 94 times was not easy, even for a knight like Alisa.Alisa wiped her forehead and shook her head.\u201cDamn. I\u2019ve lost.\u201d\u201cNo, I think we shouldn\u2019t count this match. I cannot accept this victory.\u201d\u201cI knew you would say that. I agree. I understand that you can\u2019t accept this. My mistake has caused a dilemma.\u201dThanks to the healers\u2019 hard work, the wound was treated in an instant.\u201cHowever, Young Master Jin, we can\u2019t just \u2018not count it\u2019. If it were you from three months ago, even if I made a mistake or hesitated, you would never be able to defeat me.\u201dA difference of roughly only three months\u201497 days, to be exact.As for Alisa, she couldn\u2019t believe how fast Jin improved in that short amount of time.\u2018Even considering that he\u2019s a Runcandel, I don\u2019t understand this level. Soon, his swordsmanship and magic would both become 6-star.\u2019Because she was a former member of the Vermont Special Forces, she had met many swordsmen from a famous clan of swordsmen known as Hairan.However, Alisa was certain. Amongst all of the talented knights she fought, Jin was on another level.\u201cThen, does that mean I can\u2019t fight you anymore?\u201d\u201cNot at all. In the remaining three months, try to achieve your desired victory. Until then, I will always keep my evenings open.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *December 1st, 1795.The day for Jin and Alisa\u2019s 110th battle, Alisa took the day off from work. She wanted to fight Jin in perfect condition.Because of that, the two didn\u2019t fight in the evening, but at noon instead.And thirty minutes before the battle, Kashimir sought Jin.\u201cYoung Master Jin, the information that you requested has finally arrived. It took longer than expected\u2026\u201d\u201cYou found Alu\u2019s real name?\u201dThe head of the Tesing Clan, Spiderhand Alu.At first, Kashimir thought that searching for a person\u2019s name would be a piece of cake\u2014that finding information about some sketchy alleyway gangster leader was easy with the Seven-Colored Peacock\u2019s intelligence network.However, even after all this time, they failed to find Alu\u2019s real name.\u201cUnfortunately, that is not the case. The best agents investigated everything regarding that fellow named Alu. Seems like he had a lot of secrets. But there is nothing left from anything he did before becoming Tesing\u2019s leader.\u201dKashimir shrugged.\u201cThere is only one reason for the Seven-Colored Peacock\u2019s failure. Someone must\u2019ve intentionally erased his records. As you said, he may have some connections with a Runcandel.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 I regret killing him now. Then, how about the information on Vishukel?\u201d\u201cYes, Vishukel Yvliano. The Yvliano Clan\u2019s next patriarch. Hm\u2026 Young Master Jin, do you know of an organization named \u2018Kinzelo Group\u2019?\u201d\u201cI do. Our paths met when I executed a mission with my fellow cadets this year.\u201dThe Kinzelo Group.A crazy organization that wanted to make their leader the king of the world. In Jin\u2019s past life, they assassinated the Zhan Kingdom\u2019s king and slaughtered their people, which really fostered their notoriety.\u201cAlthough I am not sure, it is possible that Vishukel is part of the Kinzelo Group. Once a week, he visits the Curano Dukedom, and he always goes to this one fragment workshop.\u201d\u201cPlease tell me more.\u201d\u201cThe owner of the strangely titled fragment workshop, \u2018Artistic Explosion\u2019, is a man named Bouvard Gaston. According to what we found, Bouvard is an executive of the Kinzelo Group. And Vishukel visits him every week, which raises suspicion.\u201d\u201cBouvard Gaston?\u201dJin spoke as if he didn\u2019t know. He couldn\u2019t tell Kashimir that Bouvard could \u2018transform\u2019 into other people just yet.Not because he couldn\u2019t trust him, but because there was no way to prove it.\u201cYes. A rather fat man in his mid-thirties. And Vishukel always brought sweet potato croquettes every time he went to his shop. Like some kind of delivery.\u201d\u201cHmm, assuming that both of them are part of the Kinzelo Group, Bouvard must be of a higher rank.\u201d\u201cMost likely so. I have actually met Vishukel once in the past. He\u2019s a very proud individual. But if it\u2019s a man who he always delivers food to, then\u2026\u201dIn reality, Bouvard was an executive and Vishukel was the vice-leader of the group, so the latter was the one with the higher rank. However, the Seven-Colored Peacock didn\u2019t figure that out yet.Kashimir and Jin simultaneously chuckled. They couldn\u2019t imagine Vishukel delivering food to a fat man.\u2018I expected a relationship between them, but the Kinzelo Group\u2026 This is unexpected. In fact, Bouvard seems to have a higher rank\u2026 What does Vishukel get out of being part of Kinzelo?\u2019The answer was simple.Although the Yvliano Clan couldn\u2019t go against the Runcandel Clan, they were strong enough to put up a fight against the Vermont Empire\u2019s Hairan Clan.However, the clan lacked any other talented knight, so if they excluded Vishukel, their power would decline.\u2018It\u2019s either he\u2019s trying to use the Kinzelo Group\u2019s strength to regain his clan\u2019s honor or he\u2019s being hypnotized.\u2019But is the Kinzelo Group that strong? Enough for a talented knight like Vishukel to seek them?\u2018Looking back at my past life, when the Kinzelo Group was at its peak\u2026 It\u2019s not impossible. Even the three strongest powers didn\u2019t touch those crazy guys.\u2019As he thought of the past, he remembered some weird things that happened.Whether it was before or after he regressed, the Runcandels didn\u2019t lay a finger on the Kinzelo Group. Even though he and the other beginner cadets got fucked over by them.\u2018Was it because the Runcandel Clan didn\u2019t think that they\u2019re worth anything? Or because they considered them a very dangerous organization? Well, I\u2019ll find out soon enough.\u2019Jin lightly bowed to Kashimir.\u201cWell, alright, Sir Kashimir. Thank you for your service.\u201d\u201cWell the service was from the agents. I only sat and listened to their reports. I presume the next task is to find out about the Kinzelo Group, then? As well as to continue searching for information on Alu.\u201dThis was the part that Jin liked about Kashimir. Even without saying anything, they had the same plan.\u201cI am always in your debt, Sir Kashimir.\u201d\u201cIn that case, why don\u2019t you go play with Euria? Every day in my office, she yearns for your presence. And with Miss Enya present, they make my head hurt.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. Oh, anyways, it\u2019s time for me to spar with Lady Alisa. Would you like to come and watch?\u201d\u201cSounds good. I wanted to see how much you\u2019ve improved anyway.\u201dKashimir\u2019s expression was filled with confidence.He was confident that Jin couldn\u2019t defeat Alisa yet.\u2018I should witness Young Master Jin\u2019s growth and send another letter to Lord Cyron.\u2019Alisa was already in the training area, waiting for Jin.\u201cHuh? What? Honey, why are you here?\u201dAlisa began to jokingly complain after seeing Kashimir walk alongside the young Runcandel.\u201cWhat, am I not allowed to come here? Young Master Jin invited me to watch.\u201d\u201cWell, no, it\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to see me losing.\u201d\u201cLosing\u2026? Wh-What? You\u2019re going to lose? What do you mean by that?\u201dKashimir\u2019s eyes were filled with shock.\u2018Instead of the promised six months, he managed to defeat her in only three?\u2019Asking with his eyes, Kashimir looked at Alisa, and she nodded.Alisa Betzer, former Vermont Special Forces 2nd Division agent and Tikan\u2019s current Chief of Defense.She took a day off from work to fight in perfect condition because she expected a loss in today\u2019s battle.\u2018His skill has already caught up to mine. Yesterday.\u2019While Kashimir lost his sense of reality, Jin and Alisa took their positions.\u201cSeems like today will be the last spar, Young Master Jin.\u201dJin only bowed instead of responding to his opponent. Alisa continued.\u201cEven in the far future. I wish you would remember me as a great sparring partner. Even the moment when you reach the top of the world.\u201d\u201cInstead of a sparring partner, I will commemorate you as a great teacher and friend. And I hope you remember me as a wonderful student.\u201dKashimir got a hold of himself and stepped away from the battlefield. He didn\u2019t want to interfere with their fight.Alisa clenched her fists, and Jin muttered.\u201cSummon.\u201dPhoenix.A summoned beast from a different world. An entity that could only be summoned by magicians who are 6-star and above.For the past 109 battles, it wasn\u2019t only his swordsmanship that improved. His spiritual energy and magic were also greatly enhanced.Fwoooosh\u2026!Jin conjured a dimensional portal, and a massive flaming bird emerged from it.And Kashimir\u2014who was looking at Jin\u2019s phoenix\u2014let out a gasp.He knew who that phoenix was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Swordmaster\u2019s Youngest SonCH 89Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf a magician was at least 6-star, then they could contract with a phoenix.And of course, all magicians wanted to own a \u2018special\u2019 or \u2018unique\u2019 phoenix.Something like Kelliark Zipfel\u2019s \u2018Beloit\u2019 or the historical grand magician O\u2019Hensirk\u2019s \u2018Maniere\u2019.They wanted to become an owner of a well-known phoenix.However, magicians were never given the ability to choose.After becoming a 6-star and opening the door to the Fire Dimension, no magician knew what kind of phoenix would approach them.With sweat rolling down his face, Kashimir stared at Jin\u2019s phoenix.He felt the burning heat waves every time the mystical blue-flame phoenix flapped its wings.In the Magicians\u2019 Society, there were over ten thousand registered phoenixes, but there was only one that was characterized with \u2018blue flames\u2019.\u201cTess\u2026! What in the world, Young Master Jin?!\u201dJin had summoned Tess, the beast deemed as \u2018the most noble phoenix\u2019.And every magician who summoned it became that era\u2019s strongest magician.\u2014Even in the far future. I wish you would remember me as a great sparring partner. Even the moment when you reach the top of the world.As soon as Kashimir saw the phoenix, he knew why Alisa spoke such words.She was no longer able to face Jin.Shing!Jin unsheathed Bradamante and spoke.\u201cThen, shall we start, Lady Alisa?\u201dJin stood still, pointing his sword at Alisa. It was only a month ago when he was the challenger. Now, the tables had turned.Today\u2019s challenger was Alisa.\u201cPrepare yourself, Young Master Jin.\u201dA white aura surrounded her two fists, and she bolted forward like a bullet, instantly closing the gap.In his current state, Jin couldn\u2019t follow Alisa\u2019s movements with his hand-eye coordination. Usually, he predicted her movements and counterattacked.However, he didn\u2019t need to do so today. Tess emitted deep-blue flames that licked its surroundings, preventing Alisa from approaching.Fwoosh! Fwoooooosh~!The smallest of the flames were at least 5-star level. Even for a 7-star knight with a trained body, without an aura shield, she would get a second-degree burn.On top of that, Tess\u2019s flames had a special ability called \u2018Pressure\u2019.\u2018If that gets on her, then she\u2019ll start to rapidly burn energy. She has to finish the battle quickly!\u2019As the name suggested, pressure pressed upon the opponent afflicted with the phoenix\u2019s ability.Tess\u2019s flames had weight that defied all laws of nature. Therefore, the moment it landed upon an aura shield, she couldn\u2019t ignore it because the flames didn\u2019t extinguish easily compared to a normal fire.Because the opponent\u2019s body itself would feel as heavy as a rock in water.Dodging the flames, Alisa weaved through each attack and put herself in a defensive stance. As such, Jin was easily given the upperhand.\u2018I can only keep Tess here for about three minutes. Within that time, I must make a meaningful attack towards her, so I can end the battle swiftly afterwards.\u2019Although it was only a spar, in the past 109 times, Jin always felt the threat of death. Now, it was Jin\u2019s turn to make Alisa feel the same.Without skipping a single day for the past three months, Alisa trained Jin to help him get stronger, and he knew the best gift to give her.Swoosh!Alisa jumped into the air, dodging a flame, and Jin swung his sword towards her.\u201cUrgh!\u201dShe quickly twisted her torso, and the blade barely scratched her back. A minor tear on her clothes, but enough to make her very tense.Then, as soon as she landed and caught her balance, a sphere of mana formed in Jin\u2019s left hand.\u2018Wind Blade! Using this, I can force her to dodge once more.\u2019He threw Wind Blade towards her ankles, and as he expected, she leapt into the air again.\u2018I\u2019ll prevent her from regaining composure to pester her impatience\u2026 And then I\u2019ll end it!\u2019After fighting Alisa 109 times, Jin realized that her patterns were diverse. As of the current moment, predicting her moves and reacting to them would be practically impossible.However, among all of Alisa\u2019s many patterns, there was a common \u2018order\u2019.In any situation, she always tried to get the upper hand.\u2018As I use more of my swordsmanship, magic, and spiritual energy, she will start to feel tired and will be more desperate to gain the upper hand. However, that will be the reason for her loss.\u2019Alisa moved to the left, dodging the Wind Blade. She fixed her eyes back to Jin as the spell flew past her.With fire in its mouth, Tess was prepared to shoot its breath.\u2018Phew. So you\u2019re a magic swordsman, Young Master Jin!\u2019Alisa quickly turned her head.From the sides, Jin swung his sword multiple times, creating multiple crescent slashes in the air. And with Tess shooting its breath at the same time, an attack from the front and sides approached her.It wasn\u2019t impossible to dodge both attacks, but doing so would enable Jin to have the offensive advantage once more.\u2018Instead, I\u2019ll block the breath with my aura shield and then parry Young Master Jin\u2019s attacks!\u2019After giving Jin a nice slug in the stomach, she planned on waiting out the phoenix\u2019s summon timer.Even if she faced an injury, she decided that gaining the upper hand would be the most optimal choice. She would never win if she stayed cornered for the entire battle. She needed to interrupt the flow that Jin had set for the battle.Fwoooosh!Tess\u2019s breath struck Alisa. The cone-shaped blue flames seemed to swallow her.However, the flames couldn\u2019t penetrate the aura shield that she created. Tess couldn\u2019t unleash anything stronger because the strength of the phoenix depended on the summoner\u2019s mana.\u2018Gotcha!\u2019And just as she planned, Alisa caught Jin\u2019s blade. Although she protected her hand with aura, blood splattered. However, it wasn\u2019t enough to cut her fingers off.Crunch!In order to throw a punch, she planted her feet on the ground and pulled on the sword to drag Jin towards her.\u201cHup!\u201dWith an echoing shout, she threw her punch. She couldn\u2019t give it her all due to the aura shield she raised, but it was still enough to make Jin recoil.BAM!A refreshing, clear sound of impact should\u2019ve been made. But the lack thereof caused Alisa to flicker her eyes around.\u2018He\u2019s not here? I\u2019m sure I pulled him in and hit him.\u2019Her fist had hit thin air.Instinctively, she looked upon the sword she was holding. And at the end of the handle, where Jin should\u2019ve been, was no one.\u2018Then I must\u2019ve felt and pulled the weight from Pressure\u2026!\u2019A blue fire burned brightly at the other end of the sword.After Alisa caught the blade, Jin had given up on his sword and repositioned himself. In lieu of him, he placed a heavy flame on the hilt of the sword, tricking his opponent.Alisa was too busy dealing with Tess\u2019s breath and failed to notice it.She only noticed everything after it all happened.As such, she was too late to react.\u201cHaha\u2026 I\u2019ve lost, Young Master Jin. I\u2019ve fought many foes, but I\u2019ve never imagined them using a trick like this.\u201dThe phoenix halted its breath.Alisa\u2019s aura shield dissipated, and Jin emerged behind her with a dagger.\u201cI pushed myself and made this shield strategy for the chance of victory, but it came back to bite me. My goodness, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve lost because I didn\u2019t keep my rear in check. I\u2019m a little shocked. Since when did you calculate all this?\u201d\u201cIf I say \u2018since the first battle\u2019, would I sound too arrogant?\u201dAlisa waved her hand in defeat.\u201cNo, that sounds completely reasonable. A little surprising.\u201d\u201cThank you for all your time, Lady Alisa.\u201d\u201cAs for me, Young Master Jin. You would never know how proud I am of you.\u201dAlisa turned around, and Jin put away his dagger.They looked at each other, then simultaneously extended their arms to shake hands.\u201cHow does it feel to defeat a former Vermont Special Forces agent before hitting the age of 16?\u201d\u201cHonestly, pretty good. Very good. In fact\u2026 I would like to fight you full force again next year.\u201dAlisa softly smiled at Jin\u2019s response.\u201cI don\u2019t gear up if I don\u2019t have to kill my opponent. So, there won\u2019t be a reason for you to fight me when I\u2019m at my full potential.\u201dIn the 110th battle, Alisa did not use a gauntlet or piece of armor. Not even once. A fully armored Alisa was an opponent that even Kashimir couldn\u2019t face. It wouldn\u2019t be suitable for Jin.\u201cWell\u2026 at this rate, you would surpass my full potential in no time. Anyways, congratulations, Young Master Jin. We should throw a party at dinner.\u201dKashimir\u2014who had watched the entire battle\u2014looked soulless.\u2018I honestly thought six months wouldn\u2019t be enough. He\u2019s crazy! Crazy! Lord Cyron, the next letter will be super special!\u2019In reality, Kashimir thought that Jin needed at least a year to defeat Alisa.He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes even after witnessing that it only took the young Runcandel 110 days.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go get healed and prepare for the party?\u201d\u201cOh, uh-huh. Alright.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The victory was celebrated with all of Jin\u2019s companions in Tikan.During the feast, everyone was told that he summoned Tess the Phoenix and defeated Alisa.\u201cBy Tess do you mean, Tess the Blue-Flame Phoenix? Young Master, I have heard of it before. That it\u2019s a very rare phoenix\u2026\u201d\u201cMiss Gilly! That\u2019s not even the most crucial part about it. Magicians who are able to summon Tess are guaranteed to be the best magician in the era. Lord Jin! Please give me an autograph! Quick! Right here, on the back of my shirt!\u201dEnya scrambled towards Jin, eyes gleaming.While more people were astonished by his feat, Murakan and Quikantel were at a loss for words.Clang!In fact, they both dropped their silverwares at the same time. They seemed to be in deep shock.\u201cHey, kid\u2026 Did you just say\u2026 Tess?\u201d\u201cJin, did you really contract with the Majestic? I-In fact, you first met at the underground training area, and as soon as you summoned the Majestic, you made them fight?\u201dThis time, Jin was confused.Even the proud dragons were baffled, respectfully addressing the phoenix.\u201cMurakan, Miss Quikantel, is there a problem\u2026?\u201d\u201cHey, anyways, try summoning them now!\u201d\u201cSummoning uses too much mana, so it\u2019s exhausting.\u201dJin looked around him then summoned Tess.\u201cWe are honored to meet the ruler of the Fire Dimension!\u201dQuikantel got on her knees and bowed, shouting her greetings.\u201cHey, uh\u2026 ruler of the Fire Dimension\u2026 Long time no see\u2026 Uhh\u2026 What\u2014why\u2026 I can talk to you like this. I can also\u2014Yeah, my condolences. Understood. Oh, okay. I understand, so please stop cursing.\u201dMurakan looked as if he met an old teacher that he had a bad history with.Everyone\u2019s stomach flipped at the fantastical sight.In the short time of Murakan and Tess\u2019s conversation, no human could hear Tess\u2019s voice.\u201cHmm\u2026 Alright, alright. I understand. I will tell Jin. Aaaah, come on. The curses! This isn\u2019t even the Fire Dimension. If you keep doing this, I\u2019ll get mad!\u201dPeck-peck-peck-peck-peck!Tess pecked on Murakan\u2019s head at ridiculous speeds. Surprisingly, the black dragon didn\u2019t fuss and just backed off.The phoenix said something after punishing the dragon, and Murakan nodded.\u201cWhew\u2026 I understand, I\u2019ll tell him that, so please calm down. Ha, you caused a fuss as soon as you came. Hey, hey! Tryna peck me again\u2026 So hot-headed. Whatever. Kid! Send this bird back to the Fire Dimension.\u201dJin released his summoning spell. The bird thrashed and threw a tantrum as it was unwillingly sucked into a dimensional portal. Quikantel finally stood up and sighed.\u201cYou and Miss Quikantel seem to have a complex relationship with Tess\u2026 It was pretty surprising. Anyways, what did you talk about?\u201dAs soon as Jin asked, Murakan shuddered, as if there were an impending doom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (1)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]There wasn\u2019t much information about the \u2018other world\u2019.All entities from the alternate dimension were witnessed in unsupervised lands like the Black Sea which fostered many monsters or through different summoned beasts like the phoenix.In his past life, Jin had never heard of the \u2018Fire Dimension\u2019 despite his vast knowledge of magic\u2014vast enough to trump many professors.\u201cFire Dimension\u2026 This is top-class information. Usually, incompetent and unimportant runts don\u2019t need to know this stuff. There aren\u2019t many dragons who exactly know of that place, and the number of those who have personally gone there are in the single digits.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s common knowledge that phoenixes are summoned beasts from the other world, but it\u2019s the first time in which the other world was called the Fire Dimension.\u201dJin scratched his chin, and Murakan shook his head.\u201cThe name \u2018Fire Dimension\u2019 is just an easy name for us to call it in this world. It\u2019s just a dimension with fire and phoenixes. Even the gods don\u2019t know the true name of that world.\u201dEveryone listened to Murakan as if he were some lecturer. Enya, who was a pupil in magical studies, was very worked up.\u201cEven the gods don\u2019t know? Does that mean the Fire Dimension is outside of the gods\u2019 control?\u201d\u201cExactly. Even the God of Flames can\u2019t control the fire in that world. However, the ruler of the Fire Dimension, Tess, can\u2019t control Sheenu\u2019s fire either.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Then the Majestic became the Young Master\u2019s summoned beast. Isn\u2019t that a great thing?\u201d\u201cStrawberry Pie is also correct. But as for it being a great thing\u2026 Well, it\u2019s the opposite. It\u2019s very bad.\u201dMurakan clicked his tongue and a shadow loomed over his face. Quikantel\u2019s expression was still frozen, still shocked from meeting Tess.One second, Two seconds, Three\u2026As Murakan\u2019s silence prolonged, some audience members gulped. They thought that Tess\u2019s summoner had received some special curse or something.\u201cHey, just tell us. Don\u2019t just leave us hanging. Why\u2019s it bad?\u201dJin grew impatient and asked Murakan. The shadow dragon lowered his head.\u201cIt\u2019s great\u2026 only for you. God fucking dammit, I don\u2019t like that guy! Why Tess? There are so many other good phoenixes. There\u2019s Maniere or Shankish!\u201dMurakan threw a tantrum and some punches in the air. Many sighs of relief could be heard from the crowd. Jin thought that Murakan would never mature.\u201cWell, although I\u2019m a little pissed, I\u2019ll offer you a bland congratulations, kiddo. You can\u2019t use that guy\u2019s full potential \u2018cause you lack some mana, but it\u2019s better than some random phoenix.\u201d\u201cIf I unleash all of their power, how strong will they get?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t unleash all of their power. Never will. At full strength, your beast can vaporize a mid-high-tier god.\u201dQuikantel shuddered at those words.She remembered the horrifying nightmare she experienced when she visited the Fire Dimension with Murakan and their respective gods, Olta and Solderet. That day, she watched five gods disappear from existence.\u201cWhat\u2026? They\u2019re that powerful?\u201dJin asked, observing Quikantel\u2019s reaction.\u201cI heard he can\u2019t do it outside of the Fire Dimension. In my case, thank goodness. I can talk to them casually and even tease them a little. Just like how our gods can\u2019t use their powers in the Fire Dimension\u2014a mutual penalty.\u201d\u201cMmmm. I see.\u201dWell, even if Tess\u2019s powers weren\u2019t that overwhelming, Jin was satisfied with it based on what he saw in textbooks. And the best part was that their fire could not be controlled by Sheenu.A full-scale war was imminent between the Runcandels and Zipfels. And if Jin were to fight against Kelliark, Tess\u2019s strength would be of great help. No matter its tier, normal flame spells would never be effective against Kelliark, Sheenu\u2019s contractor.\u201cOh, and what did Tess want to tell me? What kind of conversation did you have with them? And am I not able to directly communicate with them?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t. It\u2019s spiritual communication. And the thing they wanted to tell you is, well, nothing much\u2026 Just that they like you a lot. Also said it\u2019s the first time they were summoned for such a minor reason. They\u2019re a special fellow. Said to come over to the Fire Dimension after you get stronger.\u201d\u201cOh, I can go there too?\u201d\u201cWell, when you reach 10-star and can comfortably breathe in the fire. That neighborhood\u2019s a little rough.\u201dMurakan wrapped up his little explanation, and the party continued to talk about Jin\u2019s victory and his summoned phoenix.And as soon as the celebration ended, Kashimir took a bath and sat in his office, preparing himself to write a new letter.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *January 1st, 1796.The new year came.On the first day of the new year, the family would get together and pray for a safe year. Fostering love with family, loved ones, and friends would be wonderful\u2026But one man, Guardian Knight Khan, was charging through the Black Sea and covering himself in the black creatures\u2019 blood and guts.And this time as well, he had a letter stored safely in his chestplate. His new year\u2019s mission was to deliver a letter.\u2018This time, it has been three months. Did the Young Master defeat Alisa Betzer? Now I\u2019m looking forward to this letter\u2026\u2019Khan was also curious about the letter\u2019s content. It seemed to motivate a faster trek to Cyron, who was at the center of the Black Sea.\u201cGreetings to the patria\u2014\u201d\u201cGive it here.\u201d\u201cYes, sir!\u201dWith a grave expression, Cyron hastily ripped off the seal. He looked like a parent who sent his children off to study abroad.(To the legendary knight who I admire most, Lord Cyron.Oh, it is the second letter. I am once again writing this letter with all of my heart and soul with the warm sun shining on my back\u2026)\u201cShorter.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cNext time, tell Kashimir to write a shorter letter.\u201d\u201c\u2026Understood, Lord Patriarch.\u201dJust like last time, the long letter was at least 70% miscellaneous greetings.But reading the fourth page, Cyron began to smile.\u201cIt seems that Young Master Jin defeated Alisa Betzer.\u201dKhan guessed so while watching Cyron\u2019s expression.\u201cHehe, he won by catching her off guard. On top of that, he seemed to have tamed Tess the Phoenix. I\u2019m sure you know who that is?\u201d\u201cI apologize, Lord Patriarch. I do not know of that entity.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a blue-fire phoenix, and any magician who summons it becomes the best magician of the century.\u201d\u201cCongratulations!\u201d\u201cBut I don\u2019t care about some phoenix. Today\u2019s letter is just about it. Not more than a single line about Jin\u2019s swordsmanship.\u201d(His swordsmanship improved significantly. At a ridiculous speed.)Cyron was disappointed.He allowed Jin to practice swordsmanship, magic, and spiritual energy at the same time. But of course, as a Runcandel, he wanted to see more improvement in his son\u2019s swordsmanship.Khan nodded.\u201cI can see the problem. It\u2019s a little worrying that he might be too entrenched in magic.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly as you said. I know he\u2019ll balance it out well on his own, but it\u2019s getting on my nerves\u2026 Hmmm.\u201dA long silence.While Khan maintained his kneeling position, Cyron spoke.\u201cRon Hairan\u2019s son. Go find out what he\u2019s up to.\u201dRon Hairan.The Vermont Empire\u2019s swordmaster, patriarch of the Hairan Clan, and at some point, Cyron\u2019s worst enemy.However, the difference in their power became clear when Cyron achieved the Genesis Knight realm. Even Ron\u2019s children were being overpowered by the Runcandel children.In that situation, the most talented child was born\u2014Ron\u2019s son.Despite being a child, he already transcended his generation, being deemed the next patriarch.\u201cYou mean Dante Hairan? Coincidentally, there is information about his recent whereabouts.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYes. Not long ago, we received a request regarding the Cosmos Arena. Seeing that the request asked for an assassination of a pirate, Dante Hairan entered the competition with a fake name.\u201dCyron\u2019s eyes shimmered.\u201cThe Cosmos Arena\u2026 I\u2019m sure that\u2019s\u2026 the fighting competition hosted by the pirates? I remember Mary got second place and threw a tantrum.\u201d\u201cThat is correct, Lord Patriarch. And to my knowledge, it was her first defeat. However, she went back for revenge two months later.\u201dA secret that not many clanspeople knew.\u201cSend Jin there and have him fight Dante Hairan. It\u2019ll be fun. He can\u2019t use his magic or spiritual energy there, right? He can only fight with his sword.\u201dThe only cases when Jin can use his spiritual energy and magic was when \u2018there were no witnesses\u2019 or \u2018he can get rid of all the witnesses.\u2019Of course, he could not use all three of his strengths in that contest. He could enter as a magician and only use magic, or he can enter as a knight and only use swordsmanship.And Jin could not fight Dante with only a sword.Cyron wanted to stimulate Jin through Dante. The phoenix and magic were nice and all, but Cyron wanted Jin to prioritize the art of the sword.\u201cUnderstood. I will deliver your message to Sir Kashimir.\u201d* * *However, the 16-year-old used most of his time training his swordsmanship\u2014enough to make Cyron\u2019s concerns pointless.\u2018Ten thousand swings. The first\u2026 same as the last\u2026!\u2019After ending the consecutive battles with Alisa, he devoted all of his energy into his training.But he didn\u2019t feel as impatient to improve. Thanks to Alisa, he learned many things about himself.\u201cIs it not boring, Young Master Jin?\u201d\u201cNope, it\u2019s only fun\u2014\u201d\u201cDid you say it\u2019s boring?! I prepared this for you! Tadaaa!\u201dKashimir pulled out a piece of paper and shook it in front of Jin.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cAn entry to the Cosmos Arena. Recently, the intelligence agents found out that a special fellow is entering this competition. An opponent that would compel you to fight\u2014Dante Hairan, the Hairan Clan\u2019s next patriarch!\u201d\u201cDante Hairan? Why is that guy going there\u2026\u201dFrom Jin\u2019s knowledge, the Cosmos Arena was just a playground for pirates. In fact, most of the competitors were around 2 to 3-star.Kashimir raised his eyebrows and continued.\u201cYou are mistaken. This competition is more dangerous than you think.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (2)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u201cIt\u2019s more dangerous than I think?\u201dJin repeated Kashimir\u2019s words as he sheathed his sword, and his companion nodded in affirmation.\u201cIndeed. It doesn\u2019t have a \u2018no-killing\u2019 rule, unlike other competitions, so it\u2019s very dangerous. Although it\u2019s true that most of the competitors are novices, some competitors are just there for slaughter.\u201dThe Cosmos Arena had no rules, as expected from a pirate-organized fight.Including murder, there were no other restrictions for special weapons and tools. It was a crazy competition that even allowed murder or assassination before the fight.\u201cYou just need to defeat your opponent using any method. There\u2019s a story where a guy held the opponent\u2019s family hostage and threatened to kill them. All in order to win, of course.\u201dWhich was why, even though the opponents were only 2 to 3-star, competitors had to anticipate dirty tricks.\u201c4 to 5-star who don\u2019t know anything will become their prey. After walking the world while being oblivious of the world\u2019s dark side, they become humiliated by the tricks and gimmicks used in that crazy competition. Well, I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019ll experience the same thing. You are\u2026 well, far off from that level.\u201dIndeed, he wasn\u2019t even comparable to those people.\u201cThere are also fighters who are above 6-star who take down the opponent with the use of immense strength. At that point, it doesn\u2019t matter if they use tricks or not. These are the true predators of the arena. Well, they\u2019re just perverts who come for the stimulation.\u201d\u201cStimulation?\u201d\u201cYes. You know, those kinds of people. Sadists who destroy their enemy and feel satisfaction from it\u2014the most dangerous people.\u201d\u201cMan, what kind of competition allows this stuff to happen?\u201dAccording to Kashimir, it was a dirty, low contest. One characterized by filthy scuffles that enticed its audience to drink and gamble.\u201cWell, the official name isn\u2019t a competition, it\u2019s just an arena. If it wasn\u2019t for Dante, I wouldn\u2019t have asked you to enter.\u201d\u201cSurely he won\u2019t fit into the crowd. Is there some insane grand prize awaiting for first place?\u201d\u201cThe winner can choose from a plethora of prizes or one thousand gold coins. To a commoner, that would be a lot of money. But for the successor of the Hairan Clan, it would be pocket change.\u201d\u201cThen is his mortal enemy there or something?\u201d\u201cAs of now, we have no information regarding his entry. But in my opinion\u2026\u201dKashimir paused for a second.\u201cMaybe he wants to test his swordsmanship. To see if his blade will glow in the darkness of evil tricks. If not, he\u2019s just throwing himself into a shithole.\u201dThat made no sense.It would make no sense if Dante really entered the dirty competition in order to test his swordsmanship.\u201cEither way, I feel compelled to go. Dante Hairan\u2026 I could never dream of fighting him.\u201dBefore his regression, prior to his banishment from the clan, the commoners would always debate who was stronger with the sword\u2014Dante or Beradin.Because they had many similarities.They were both over 7-star at an early age, were nominated as the next patriarch of their respective powerful clans, and achieved 9-star at the age of 30. Whenever they encountered each other during a meeting, the press would go off. On top of that, they were the same age.\u2018At the time, they got more attention than the Runcandel children. Eldest Sister Luna didn\u2019t present herself too much, and Eldest Brother fell behind them.\u2019There weren\u2019t any other second-generation Runcandel who was stronger than Dante other than Luna. Though, there wasn\u2019t definitive proof that he was stronger than all of the Runcandel children, but that\u2019s what the world thought.\u2018He\u2019s a fellow I\u2019m curious about. There\u2019s nothing bad from meeting him once. Hopefully, he\u2019s not hot-headed like the Beradin from my past life.\u2019However, Kashimir\u2019s exaggerated attitude was getting on his nerves. He could\u2019ve just naturally asked Jin to compete, but he was promoting it as if he were a businessman selling drugs.\u2018And I\u2019m sure the Seven-Colored Peacock doesn\u2019t have spare time to investigate Dante Hairan. All of the best agents should be investigating the Zipfels, Alu, and Kinzelo. I doubt that it\u2019s just some idle information they found\u2026\u2019Thinking until that point, Jin smiled.\u2018It was Father\u2019s orders. The information about Dante is likely to have come from the Runcandel Clan. And now that I think about it, back at the Garden, Father sent me off first so he could talk to Kashimir alone.\u2019He pondered the possibility of Kashimir sending reports to Cyron regarding his progress ever since that day at the Garden of Swords. However, it wasn\u2019t of any importance. There weren\u2019t any disadvantages that would affect Jin.Instead, he felt a little mischievous.\u201cHmmm\u2026 Sir Kashimir, do I really need to go?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really want to attend such a pathetic battle. And I can face Dante Hairan anytime in the future.\u201d\u201cEhem! Young Master Jin, please think about it. You would obviously meet him many times since you are a Runcandel, but would there be an opportunity to fight him? It could be a once-in-a-lifetime chance\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m not some fighting legend or anything. And I\u2019ve recently been feeling tired from fighting Lady Alisa.\u201d\u201cY-Young Master, don\u2019t be like that\u2026 Just trust me and try participating. I-Isn\u2019t it a chance to evaluate Dante Hairan\u2019s strength? Hahaha, my tongue is getting twisted. Maybe I\u2019m getting a heatstroke\u2026\u201dJin pointed to the window and laughed. Outside, snow was falling. The early January blizzards were rolling in.\u201cHeatstroke?\u201d\u201cOh, my mistake again. Anyways, Young Master Jin! I\u2019ve already filled out your entry form. Just trust me and enter, ok? I\u2019m sure this will be a great experience for you!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 If you say so, then there\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019ll participate.\u201d\u201cThank you, Young Master Jin! Oh, and on top of that, you must leave tomorrow. The schedule is tight. That is all!\u201d\u201cTomorrow? Wait, Sir Kashimir!\u201dKashimir quickly escaped the training area without looking back.And Jin\u2019s suspicions were solidified.\u2018He\u2019s definitely reporting my progress to Father. And this must be the first order\u2014to face Dante Hairan.\u2019Jin chuckled. He knew his father was interested in him and his progress, but he didn\u2019t think that it was enough to make him intervene.His siblings would go crazy if they found out.\u2018And Sir Kashimir is terrible at acting\u2026 Is it just in front of me? I heard he was really good at politics after becoming the ruler of Tikan.\u2019Jin chuckled once more.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The Cosmos Arena was hosted on an island south of the Bellard Empire. It was right outside of Bellard territory, so the surrounding ocean was the pirates\u2019 playground.Jin went alone to that island.\u2018It\u2019s a mission ordered by Father, so it\u2019s right to not bring anyone else.\u2019If he brought anyone with him, Jin would have an emotional attachment that could potentially drag him down.He knew what his father wanted to say: to sweep the competition alone with a sword.Using magic and spiritual energy around a massive audience was crazy.\u2018It\u2019s been a while since I received a solo mission after the one in Mamit. But just like last time, I\u2019m dealing with outlaws.\u2019After arriving in the Bellard Empire, he took a ferry to the island, using up a thick bag of gold.The island\u2026 didn\u2019t look nice.It had the ambience of the lowest of the low infesting the place, with stenched streets that had fresh streaks of blood everywhere.Any type of disturbance would get one stabbed. In addition to being a remote island, since it was filled with pirates who tasted the bitter and sweet of life, it was impossible to maintain order in the place.\u201cKekekeke.\u201dEvery five steps, there were people laughing hysterically, driven mad by drugs.But not all were like that.Occasionally, there were houses with guards and children, and knights who had decent armor. They were either competitors or spectators of the arena.Jin began to follow one of these respectable people. He felt that he could arrive at the reception desk after following the man.And just as he thought, after walking for thirty minutes, he reached the reception desk. A single-table set up in front of an arena that looked worse than a pig pen.\u201cI came to register for the arena.\u201dHe held out the entry form that Kashimir filled out, and the receptionist opened his eyes. Hair covered his big body, and tattoos crawled all over his arms.\u201cHuh? The time frame for registration\u2019s already passed. Fuck off. Better if you die while leaving.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s passed? I\u2019m sure you guys are open until sundown.\u201d\u201cOh, I just don\u2019t want to take any more entries. You deaf?\u201dThe man then formed a circle with his thumb and index finger. Clearly, he wanted money.Jin knew to end money-related problems by paying up.With the added interest of beating some sense into the guy.Crack!Jin kicked the table to the side. As the man tried to stand up, Jin slammed his fist on the crown of his head. In Jin\u2019s fist was the crumpled registration form.\u201cErk! Argggh, this bastard.\u201d\u201cTake it. I\u2019ll give you the money.\u201dAnd he threw some gold coins on the ground. The guy\u2019s expression brightened, and he nodded.Jin could only be surprised at the strength of his punch, which could have severely injured a trained 4-star knight.However, even though the guy took the hit, he immediately stood up and laughed at the sight of money.\u201cRegistration complete! Hahaha! A hotshot kid. I like it. You\u2019ll fight in group 13. Take this and go inside. The other fellows will escort you.\u201dThe man handed him a small piece of paper with something written on it.(Group 13, Jin Grey.)\u201cKuhaha, welcome to the Cosmos Arena, filled with love and fervor. Try your best!\u201d\u2018Since he struck me for no reason, I\u2019ll stick him with the strong guys. Oh, and if this kid doesn\u2019t survive tonight, I\u2019ll cook him and feed him to the sharks.\u2019The man\u2014smiling with his gold-plated teeth\u2014was the host of the competition.Pirate King Cosmos.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (3)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Filled with love and fervor\u2026 And yet, the arena interior reflected the structure of a prison.There were long, dark hallways with individual rooms squished together on either side. However, instead of a normal door similar to that used on a normal house, each room had a jail door.The only difference the place had from a prison was that the competitors could enter and exit the rooms freely. Also, the guides\u2014Cosmos\u2019s underlings\u2014were pretty nice.\u201cWhat\u2019s this? There\u2019s a fetus in this competition? Kuhaha, this year\u2019s arena rumble is filled with children. C\u2019mere. Let\u2019s see\u2026 What the\u2014Group 13? Oh, uh\u2026 And you beat the captain? This kid\u2019s a special breed.\u201dAmazed, the guide scanned Jin.\u201cKids these days don\u2019t have any fear. There\u2019s another kid who struck the captain, and if you two fought, it\u2019d be fun to watch. Unfortunately, your groups are different.\u201dThere was no need to ask who that kid was. On this deranged island, there wasn\u2019t any other teenager aside from Dante Hairan.\u201cSo, what room do I use?\u201dJin asked with irritation, and the guide only shrugged in response.\u201cWherever the fuck you want! Group 13 fights tomorrow, so if you\u2019re bored, go watch the other groups. Shouldn\u2019t you make some fun memories before you die?\u201dThe guide definitely thought that Jin would die immediately. However, it wasn\u2019t in a mocking tone, so Jin just walked past him and began to choose a room.Clop, clop.As he observed each room while walking slowly, he noticed that there was significant diversity within the rooms.One room had someone sitting in the corner and muttering prayers, another had someone inspecting unidentified objects. Some competitors had already formed gangs and bantered amongst themselves.In some aspects, it felt more barbaric than the Mamit Lawless Zone.\u2018And that pirate named Cosmos\u2026 He\u2019s not an easy fellow. I wonder why he\u2019s marauding in this area.\u2019Jin shrugged and chose a room. He had been roaming the halls for about ten minutes, but there wasn\u2019t any specific room that was cleaner or nicer. They were all old and dirty.\u2018In fact, there aren\u2019t enough rooms for all of the competitors. It seems that two or three people per room is the norm. It\u2019s extremely obvious that they intentionally wanted to cram people in here, and I hate it.\u2019The Cosmos Arena was a scuffle in which killing was allowed even before the fight. The contest was more of a survival game than a regular scuffle.Hence, they purposefully crammed the competitors into cramped rooms. They wanted them to fight whenever possible in the tight spaces.And once one entered the competition, it was impossible to withdraw. Cosmos\u2019s underlings guarded the entrance, and the other competitors would not let anyone escape so easily.If someone were to make a poor attempt at escaping, the other competitors would turn the runaway into dead meat before the guards could even get to them.That was the very reason why Cosmos thought that Jin would become shark food if he didn\u2019t survive and the reason why the guide said that Jin will die anyways.It was hard to expect a newbie to survive in such a savage environment. They thought that Jin\u2019s chances of death were high even if he were a talented 4-star.In order to survive the veiled enmity and rotten gimmicks, observation and experience was more important than pure fighting power. And to a pirate, that wasn\u2019t something a young adult would have.\u2014You are mistaken. This competition is more dangerous than you think.Jin remembered Kashimir\u2019s words. After exploring the area, he finally understood what he meant.\u2018Well, it\u2019s an experience.\u2019In the middle of the long hallway, Jin pulled on a cell door.Clack, creeaaaak\u2026The irritating sound of metal scraping against concrete echoed, and the three competitors inside the cell glared at Jin.\u201cCan\u2019t you see that there are already three people in here? Fuck off to another room, kid.\u201d\u201cMan, as much as this is a shitty contest, this is off the top. They let babies enter?\u201d\u201cWhy are you just standing there? Go away.\u201dThe three guys were in their mid to late-twenties. Hearing their attitude and seeing their crooked posture, Jin concluded that they were just some irrelevant gangsters.\u2018I wonder who said that punches were medicine for these kinds of people? I wonder\u2026 Was it an old master? Was it Elder Sister Mary?\u2019Thinking that he should still give them a chance before beating them up, Jin met eyes with each of them.\u201cStarting today, I\u2019m using this room by myself. I will count to three. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s enough time for all three of you to walk out of this room?\u201dHe didn\u2019t have any intentions of sharing a room\u2014not even in the slightest. If he left these people next to him, they could backstab him at any moment.The hoodlums doubted their ears and blinked.\u201cOne. Two. Three.\u201dBam! Crack! Thoom!Two punches and one wrestling throw. All of which resulted in a fractured bone, shattered skull, and a dislocated shoulder, respectively. The thugs couldn\u2019t even react to the quick attacks.Following the painful cries were loud cheers echoing from the adjacent room. Jin put his hands on his hips, and the three scrambled out of the room without a single word.Clean room: check.But the real battle had just begun.\u2018I\u2019m certain that other people will attack me after seeing that I\u2019m alone here\u2026 Well, so much for sleep.\u2019And his prediction was precise.Not even ten minutes later, two contenders appeared.\u201cHey, let\u2019s share a room.\u201dThey entered with bravado.\u201cErk! Argh!\u201dAlthough it was adorable of them to get beat up and run away from him, Jin couldn\u2019t forgive those who sprayed poison or fired a crossbow.For those people, he cut off either all of their fingers or their entire hand. It would convey a better message to the other contenders rather than just killing them.However, the most concerning type of people were the ones who just watched and then walked past.\u2018They will definitely strike when they see the opportunity. Possibly when I\u2019m busy dealing with the other guys and lowering my guard.\u2019He wasn\u2019t scared, but more so they were getting on his nerves. Because he couldn\u2019t use magic or spiritual energy.\u2018It\u2019s kinda pressuring that I have to use my sword in whatever situation I get into. Since I\u2019m used to always utilizing all three of my strengths.\u2019Either that or he had his companions to rely on. And not so long ago, he had a necklace that would save him, no matter who he faced.\u2018I can see why Father wanted to send me here. Fighting Dante is important, but it\u2019s also to drag down my ego on my swordsmanship.\u2019So much time passed as he watched the entrance to his cell, with his senses heightened to the maximum.Then, he heard the guide\u2019s voice resounding from outside.\u201cAlright, alright. We\u2019ll have the battles for groups 1 and 2! If you wanna watch, then get your asses to the audience seats. Oh, and I\u2019m sure you know the audience seats is a murder-free area. Don\u2019t do dumb shit. Or else\u2026 Well, you know the consequences, so watch your ass.\u201dClank, clang!The cells in the hallway began to open one by one. They were all heading over to watch the fights between the participants in groups 1 and 2.And on top of that, since the area was murder-free, they could finally be at ease.With that, there also seemed to be an implied rule; no one attacked another as they relocated to the seats. So Jin tried to naturally join the cramped line.\u2018The guys who looked at me and walked past\u2026 If I were them, I would stab my target while we\u2019re in that line. That would bring the highest chance of success.\u2019No matter how great Jin was, noticing a blade and dodging it was impossible when standing in the middle of a crowd.However, not attacking while amongst the line was at most an \u2018implied rule\u2019.He had read the rules on the back of the entry form dozens of times, but it had no mention of it. After all, it wasn\u2019t one established by the host.Of course, if anyone attacked Jin, then the surrounding people would glare at the attacker. However, they would rather thank the murderer for eliminating the arrogant kid who monopolized a room.\u2018There\u2019s nothing bad about going out late. I\u2019ll leave after the hallway clears up.\u2019Which was the right decision.The ones who glanced at Jin and walked past earlier were all part of the same group. They assumed that Jin was a 4-star and had plans to eliminate him.They didn\u2019t really have a reason to get rid of him. They just thought that he was the most enjoyable to kill amongst all of the other prey.However, they could not execute their plan because of Jin\u2019s quick thinking. Watching this, the guide muttered.\u201cI thought he was just a fearless child who just trusted his strength, but he\u2019s also very intelligent. I can see why the boss stuck him against the stronger opponents.\u201dAs the hallway cleared up, Jin silently left his room.Getting closer to the arena, the screams and shouts grew clearer. Arriving in the audience seats, Jin silently stood to conceive the massive crowd.\u2018Holy shit\u2026 This many people came to see this?\u2019Excluding the contenders, there were at least a thousand other spectators.For a moment, Jin worried that there may be someone who would recognize his face, but he didn\u2019t think that someone who went to a Runcandel banquet would come to such a dirty place.\u2018Well, as for Dante Hairan, he probably entered knowing that not many people knew what he looked like and that his acquaintances will not attend this arena.\u2019Still, if he knew that there would be this many people, he would\u2019ve focused on his disguise a little more.Jin licked his lips and sat in a decent spot. He could hear the spectators\u2019 voices.They looked like upper-class Bellard Empire nobles who visited the arena annually.\u201cHey, you heard the rumor?\u201d\u201cWhat rumor?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor that a Runcandel provisional flag-bearer is attending this arena with a fake name.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (4)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Jin flinched.\u2018Shit. What the hell? Why do people already know?\u2019Jin would\u2019ve never thought of hearing this kind of rumor right as he reached the audience. He sneakily took a seat near the two nobles and listened in on their conversation.\u201cA Runcandel provisional flag-bearer? Haha, you fool. Why would someone that amazing come here? This place is only crawling with the lowest of the low.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just something that I heard while drinking with the Cosmos Pirates executives. They said that there\u2019s a talented youngling among the combatants, and they were sure that it was one of the Runcandels\u2019 provisional flag-bearers.\u201d\u201cHmmm, really? Let\u2019s see\u2026 Right now, the Runcandel Clan\u2019s three active provisional flag-bearers are Daytona, Haytona, and Jin Runcandel. So it\u2019s one of those three.\u201d\u201cJin Runcandel really shook the public last year. Every single press talked about his 5-star achievement. Either way, the executive guy was certain. One of those three must\u2019ve entered.\u201dJin found it interesting that he was closely listening to nobles discussing this new rumor.\u2018I guess the clan\u2019s fame and power is really well known. My name was written in press releases many times, but they even know the Tona twins\u2019 names.\u2019The Tona twins were about to become provisional flag-bearers. Before Jin\u2019s regression, they started their provisional flag-bearer missions around 1796 or 1797.Thinking about the environment and mood of the \u2018Cosmos Arena\u2019 as well as the twins being deemed the Nefarious Homicidal Maniacs in his past life, Jin inferred that it was completely possible for them to join the arena.Of course, in this life, the Tona twins were abused by Jin since their youth. Compared to his past life, they got significantly tamer.\u2018If the twins did enter, then it\u2019s great for my case. I can bring them to my room and use them as guards. Make them do all of the dirty work as well.\u2019Afterwards, the nobles debated on which Runcandel entered the competition.Not only that, but other nobles also began to whisper about the same topic.\u2018Now that I think about it, most of the spectators are nobles. Well, rich people are always looking for some entertainment.\u2019Creaaaaaak!A massive steel door on one side of the circular stadium suddenly began to open.A man then emerged and walked to the middle of the arena\u2014Pirate King Cosmos. As soon as he appeared, the audience went crazy. Cosmos seemed to be very popular with the crowd.\u201cThank you for waiting!\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cCOSMOS! COSMOS!\u201d\u201d\u201dAround him were nobles who screamed and cheered in excitement for outright criminals. It was bizarre to witness the very people who looked down upon common folk suddenly cheer for lawbreakers.\u201cLadies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Cosmos Arena. I, Pirate King Cosmos, thank you for coming here. Hahaha! This time, there are significantly more people than last year. I can\u2019t wait to see the fight!\u201dClap!Cosmos clapped some and fireworks were shot into the air, coloring the sky in bright colors. As the explosions ensued, the air around them warmed up.\u201cAlrighty, alrighty. Then, let\u2019s get riiiiiight into the fight! Hehe, fellas! Bring in two guys from group 1! Cue the horns!\u201dToooooooo~! Toooooooooot!The pirates at the edge of the arena blew their horns. The steel doors on both sides of the arena rose, and the contenders revealed themselves.Each group had 14 people, and since there were up to 13 groups, there were 182 contenders who entered this filthy contest. There was no other fighting competition that had this many people.\u201cThe lucky guy to fight in the honorary first round\u2026 Last year\u2019s 16th-round qualifier and cutie of Shark Pirates! Mantis! And the opponent!\u201dCosmos\u2019 eyes narrowed and shoved his face into the roster. His expressions implied that something was wrong.\u201cOh damn. I\u2019m gonna get flamed by the Shark dudes\u2019 captain. And I\u2019ll drown the guy who planned the brackets. Well, here he is anyway! Paul Mick!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s Paul Mick?\u201d\u201cNever heard of him. Seeing Cosmos\u2019s reaction, I think he\u2019s a special fellow.\u201dAs the nobles conversed with astonishment, Mantis entered the arena first.With a shriveled physique and a distinct shark tattoo on his back, he made an awkward stance with scimitars in his hand. The epitome of a pirate.\u201cHoho, Cosmos. What kind of guy is Paul or Mick or something? Making me all nervous. I\u2019m a little disappointed, making me look bad.\u201dCosmos ignored Mantis\u2019s banter.Paul Mick came out of the waiting room, and the audience began to chatter.\u201cThat\u2019s a kid.\u201d\u201cWhat is this\u2026? I know that there were a lot of kids in this contest, but this is too much.\u201d\u201cIf he bent his knees a little, the sword on his back would drag on the ground. Hoho.\u201dJin was also a little surprised.This Paul Mick guy didn\u2019t look like he was over 15.\u201813? 14? They let a child enter here? That\u2019s crazy!\u2019He would\u2019ve jumped into the arena without hesitation. He couldn\u2019t just let the child die there.If Cosmos didn\u2019t make a strange reaction, that is.\u2018Wait\u2026 Is that kid Dante Hairan? No, Dante Hairan is three years older\u2026\u2019The next series of events was most surprising.Notifying the start of the battle, Cosmos walked out of the ring, and Mantis shrugged in confusion.However\u2014Slash!It happened in an instant.Mantis\u2019s neck was cut.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 was that?\u201d\u201cAnyone see that correctly?\u201dThe audience couldn\u2019t exactly pinpoint when the pirate\u2019s head fell off.It was obvious. The movement was so quick that Jin\u2014who was about to hit 6-star\u2014barely saw what happened.\u2018It was a crescent slash. He instantly closed the gap between them, and when he was only five steps away from the pirate, he used a crescent slash to slice his head off. Damn, that guy\u2026\u2019No, there was no doubt about it.Amongst the contenders, there was no one other than Dante Hairan who could pull it off.The audience went quiet. Those who were talking until a minute ago were now at a loss for words.Thud!Mantis\u2019s body fell to the ground.And Cosmos smacked his forehead, dumbfounded.\u201cWow, fucking dammit. Mantis was a 16th-round finalist, so we could\u2019ve profited off his popularity. And now, he just dies\u2026 Well, anyway. It\u2019s Paul Mick\u2019s victory!\u201dCosmos announced the victor, but the audience remained silent. While everyone was still shocked, a man in the VIP seats on the opposite side of Jin\u2019s seat stood and began to clap.\u201cFrom now on, I have all my money on Paul Mick. Paul Mick! Paul Mick! Amazing!\u201dAnd surprisingly, it was someone that Jin knew well.\u2018What the\u2014Beradin Zipfel?! Why\u2019s he here?!\u2019Jin\u2019s eyes widened, and he had to reconfirm that the face he saw was Beradin Zipfel. The audience began to belatedly cheer.Beradin had come by order of the Zipfel elders. Since the Hairan Clan\u2019s successor was growing rapidly, they ordered Beradin to come and see for himself.\u201cWooooooh!\u201d\u201cThis youngling\u2019s spicy!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m also betting on Paul Mick this time! All in!\u201dAnd the two Bellard Empire nobles in front of Jin began to whisper in certainty.\u201cSee? Is my information ever incorrect? It\u2019s him, the Runcandel provisional flag-bearer!\u201d\u201cWow\u2026 That\u2019s a surprise. Well, if he isn\u2019t a Runcandel provisional flag-bearer, he can\u2019t do that at that age. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s Jin Runcandel.\u201d\u201cMe too. He\u2019s too young to be one of the Tona twins.\u201dThe other nobles nearby nodded in approval.Of course, no one yelled his name out loud. They knew that blabbering about a provisional flag-bearer would result in a manhunt.Which was why they were whispering amongst themselves. Paul Mick is Jin Runcandel, Paul Mick is the provisional flag-bearer!Listening to all this, Jin scoffed.\u2018Anyways\u2026 It\u2019s my first time seeing Dante looking that young. In my past life, I just heard from the press that he looked nice, but he doesn\u2019t even look 19.\u2019Jin looked at Paul Mick\u2014no, Dante and then at Beradin, who was still clapping.\u2018Beradin probably came because his clan told him to. He\u2019s also getting on my nerves, just like Dante. He\u2019s definitely going to notice me\u2026 And if he does, he\u2019s going to be a pain in the ass.\u2019His anxious predictions couldn\u2019t be wrong.And unfortunately, right at that moment, Beradin spotted Jin who was looking at him intently.\u201cOh? Wow!\u201dBeradin crazily waved his arm at Jin.Of course, Jin ignored him and looked back at Dante. Amusingly, Dante turned his head and glared at Beradin.\u2018That is\u2026 Beradin Zipfel. Is he acting like he knows me? I\u2019ve only met him at the Zipfel banquet, and yet, he\u2019s enthusiastically greeting me. Alright, I will also greet you, Beradin!\u2019Misunderstanding the situation, Dante waved his hand at Beradin. Jin burst into laughter. He couldn\u2019t read Dante\u2019s mind, but he could assume what he was thinking.\u2018Funny fellows.\u2019Cosmos\u2019s underlings ran over and retrieved Mantis\u2019s corpse.\u201cAlrighty, alrighty. Ladies and gentlemen, it seems that Mantis had a short standing. Let\u2019s hear some words from our victor. Mister Paul Mick, how do you feel?\u201d\u201cI feel like I got rid of another filthy scum. I pray he doesn\u2019t become a pirate in his next life.\u201dAlthough his appearance was child-like, his voice was comparably deeper. And with it, he berated the pirates in a pirates cove.A lot of pirates ground their teeth, but they couldn\u2019t attack Dante. Their hesitation was expected after bearing witness to his swordsmanship.Cosmos let out an awkward chuckle and nodded.\u201cHeheh, being a pirate isn\u2019t a job to recommend to children. But remember that it\u2019s a great start for those cornered at the bottom of the social ladder.\u201dDante silently walked towards the waiting room, and Cosmos carried on with the battles.Jin then thought to himself while watching Dante\u2019s back.\u2018That guy\u2026 Can I beat him?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (5)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Jin quickly concluded that a fight against Dante was winnable.\u2018If I could use magic and spiritual energy.\u2019Not long ago, he defeated a former Vermont Special Forces agent\u2014though she was retired and washed out. It was true that Dante was very talented, but Jin could definitely take him down.\u2018But if we were to fight only with swords, there\u2019s no certainty. His crescent slashes, agility, explosive strength, and accuracy were all extraordinary.\u2019The second battle began, but it didn\u2019t catch his eye. Instead, the sight of Dante beheading Mantis constantly repeated in his head.Dante Hairan definitely practiced more skilled swordsmanship. It was inevitable because he was three years older.So Jin had to analyze.He could possibly win if he gathers all methods of victory until he meets Dante in the arena.\u2018But unlike the other contenders, I don\u2019t want to use tricks or gimmicks on him. It\u2019s only meaningful if I beat him head-on.\u2019While Jin was deep in his concerns, on the opposite side of the arena, Beradin couldn\u2019t contain his beating heart as he sat in his VIP seat.\u2018Thank god I came. Who would\u2019ve thought that Jin also entered! And seeing him and Dante meet swords like this\u2026 is a miracle.\u2019Jin and Dante.Beradin considered them to be his only two rivals in the world, and he never expected to meet both of them here.Unfortunately, Jin didn\u2019t really care about Beradin.Jin watched all of the battles in groups 1 and 2.He concluded that there was no other formidable foe aside from Dante. From the beginning, he could tell that the arena was closer to a tragic slaughterfest than a fighting tournament.Those who were 3-star and below were busy using tricks. And the inexperienced contestants fell for said tricks, which then satisfied the nobles who were watching. The veterans tortured their opponents, and the crowd would then cheer.That was the Cosmos Arena.\u2018Starting tomorrow, they\u2019ll start doing four or five groups per day. Then I\u2019d be on the field after four days. Until then\u2026\u2019He had to survive the nights in the arena.Which was the most dangerous aspect\u2014more than the battle itself.There were 147 people left in the arena living spaces. Out of 182 contenders, 35 had already died.About ten of them actually died from battle, and the other 25 died while fighting in their cells before the real fights.Poisoning, assassination, and ambush were staple methods. There were also gang fights.Just sitting in one\u2019s room and trying to rest was a one-way ticket to hell.However, Jin couldn\u2019t just not sleep for the next four days. Having a light nap while in the audience seat was possible, but a deep sleep was impossible.\u2018I did get insomnia training during my cadet years\u2026 But this is the first time I\u2019m trying to last four days.\u2019He had already thought of making some contestants his underlings and they could take turns resting.But is there anyone he could trust in this tournament? Trust them with his back, enough to protect him while he eats, sleeps, or rests until his battle.There was no one. About 70% of the contestants were plundering pirate outlaws, and about 20% were cunning gangsters.Still, the slightly-better 10% were just regular knights who attended just to gain some experience since they didn\u2019t know much about the world. In simpler terms, they were incompetent, ordinary people.And most of them had already died. They were too naive to survive in the hell hole they were in. But if they were alive, Jin would team up with them anyways.\u2018Fuck it. I\u2019ll just stay awake. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m the only tired one. The ones who\u2019ll try to kill me will also die of exhaustion.\u2019Shing!Jin unsheathed Bradamante and set it on the ground as he sat down, making it easier for him to swing it as soon as someone attacked him.Time passed very slowly.While his senses were heightened, time felt as if it passed even slower knowing that there were 147 enemies outside his room.As he watched the time pass at a snail\u2019s pace, the sun eventually rose and illuminated the surroundings.And Jin was not attacked a single time.\u2018Did cutting off their fingers scare them off? I didn\u2019t think that no one would come to my room.\u2019Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that Jin could sleep tonight without worry. The others could be waiting for Jin to lower his guard.\u2018It seems that many fights broke out throughout the night.\u2019The contender count decreased from 147 to 140, and although not dead, there were many who were severely injured.As he satiated himself with dried food and water, the guide notified the start of the battles. There were battles scheduled all the way until the next morning.Rumble, rumble.With tired expressions, the contenders moved their feet. Just like last time, Jin waited for the crowd to die down before proceeding to the audience seats himself.And the events were the same as yesterday. He watched pathetic scuffles and returned to his room as the battles ended.Because murder was prohibited while in the audience seats, Jin could catch multiple light naps. Other contenders did the same, but it didn\u2019t really help with getting rid of the exhaustion.Another night came.For the two days Jin was at the arena, he didn\u2019t do anything. Other than chasing out the previous inhabitants of his room.Despite doing nothing, he felt like dying from acute exhaustion obviously caused by sleep deprivation.But he wouldn\u2019t be this tired just because of sleep deprivation. The fact that he had to heighten his senses and be prepared for battle for two straight days exhausted him most. It was hell.\u2018Today, and tomorrow\u2026 Gotta hold on. They said that I can get actual time to rest during the preliminary rounds, so I have to clench my teeth and endure.\u2019It didn\u2019t matter. As long as his opponent wasn\u2019t Dante, he could destroy them with 20% of his power. Even if it was a \u2018talented\u2019 veteran.Jin kept Bradamante out, prepared to strike.Time, again, went slower than ever.Was it because of his accumulated exhaustion?He almost nodded off to sleep multiple times due to fatigue.And strangely, the night was quiet. There were occasional screams of death, but that was all.Yet again, no one attacked Jin that night.And the fact that no one did tortured Jin. He confirmed that there were people who waited for him to lower his guard, but he felt humiliated realizing that he had no idea who was doing so.And as the day\u2019s fourth hour approached, a thought shot through Jin\u2019s brain.\u2018Do I just go out and kill all of them?\u2019Chills.Most of the contenders were bad people. However, he still debated whether it would be right to slaughter a hundred people for no reason.\u2018Ha\u2026 I\u2019m going crazy. As Sir Kashimir said, it\u2019s a dangerous competition.\u2019Phew!He took a deep breath, and regained his composure. As a knight, he knew he could kill many people, but he didn\u2019t feel the need to become a mass-slaughterer.And after one hour\u2014Clop, clop\u2026He heard footsteps growing louder in the hallway. There was no way it was just a passerby. It had to be the movement of a person who intended to kill him.\u2018And so it begins?\u2019They could be going for someone else, but still, Jin silently picked up Bradamante.The footsteps got closer, louder.They stopped in front of the room adjacent to Jin\u2019s. One more step and it would be Jin\u2019s room.\u2018He\u2019s going for me. Is he bold or stupid? He just comes at me like that? Or did he go crazy from lack of sleep?\u2019Jin stood and lowered his stance while firmly gripping his sword. As soon as the visitor came inside his cell, Jin planned on immediately striking.The man outside emitted a strong metallic stench\u2014the smell of blood.And then, Jin heard an unexpected voice.\u201cWait\u2026 Can we talk for a sec?\u201dA husky voice.It was Dante.\u2018What the\u2026 Why is Dante coming to me?\u2019Suddenly, all kinds of thoughts went through his mind.\u2018Does he know who I am? If he does, did Beradin tell him? Did he come to settle our anticipated battle without waiting? Or none of that, and just coincidentally came here?\u2019Jin could hear his heartbeat.If Dante was in a rested state, Jin couldn\u2019t win. But he couldn\u2019t decline the fight just because he was tired either.\u201cTalk?\u201dJin concealed his nervousness and calmly asked.\u201cYes.\u201dJin thought for a bit before opening the door.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cThanks\u2026\u201dThud!\u2018Huh?\u2019As soon as he came in, Dante kneeled on one knee, as if he couldn\u2019t control his body. While Jin\u2019s eyes widened, Dante spoke.\u201cI apologize for the request on our first meeting\u2026 but please\u2026 let me sleep. In exchange, I will guard you so that you can sleep.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cJust as I said. I can\u2019t endure much longer. I must sleep for at least an hour\u2026 so I won\u2019t go crazy.\u201dIf it was like this, his limit was different. Like Jin, he kept his eyes wide open as he waited for potential assassins.\u201cBut why me? What is there to trust about me?\u201d\u201cYesterday, I watched you. Unlike the others, you seemed like a real knight. Out of everyone\u2026 just you. Which is why\u2026 I can trust\u2026\u00a0zzzzzz\u2026\u201dThud.Zzzzzz, zzzzzzzz\u2026Jin could only be surprised.\u2018What in the world is this guy? The audacity! On some aspects, he\u2019s worse than Beradin.\u2019There would be no problem slitting Dante\u2019s throat while he was vulnerable. He was fast asleep on the spot.\u2018Does the Hairan Clan not do insomnia training? Either that or more contenders attacked him.\u2019Shuffle, shuffle.However, before his frustrations receded, Jin heard evident footsteps from people who tried to sneak and conceal them.It was the gang that waited for Dante to be knocked out, and at that moment, Jin finally realized.\u2018Dante\u2019s pungent metallic smell\u2026 He came here after fending off the many enemies that went into his room. Unlike my room, which had no visitors.\u2019Making the Hairan Clan\u2019s next patriarch indebted to him wouldn\u2019t be bad at all.Jin covered Bradamante with aura and prepared to fight the aggressors.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (6)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u2018Four\u2014no\u2026 Five.\u2019Seeing that they poorly concealed their presence, Jin knew they weren\u2019t trained assassins. Additionally, their breaths were hoarse, which meant that they were very nervous.They would still be able to deal with Dante, who was exhausted to death.But they weren\u2019t enough to take care of Jin.\u2018I don\u2019t need to fight them in such a cramped space. I don\u2019t want to contaminate my living space with bloodstains.\u2019Stomp!Jin intentionally stomped towards the cell door, and the assassins stopped in place. Before his enemies could exchange signals\u2026\u201cThis isn\u2019t Paul Mick\u2019s room.\u201dSlash!Jin shot out like a bullet towards the cell door and slashed the assassins near the hallway wall. He didn\u2019t want to send them back with only severed fingers or hands.He had already done that on the first day to warn the rest of the attackers.The next time someone came to his room, they would not be losing a body part, but their life.\u201cAhhhh!\u201dHearing the swing of a sword, the man behind the victim screamed instinctively.As Jin predicted, there were a total of five enemies. And since one just died, they were now down to four. Amongst them, none saw how the first one died.After his battles with Alisa, Jin\u2019s swordsmanship improved significantly.\u201cG-Get him!\u201dStab!His second strike exactly pierced the target\u2019s heart. The other three ran in simultaneously, but their movements were stiff due to nervousness.Coating the blade with venom didn\u2019t matter if the sword didn\u2019t hit anything. Jin easily dodged each poison-gleaming blade and continued to attack.\u201cW-We are not here to attack you!\u201d\u201cI know. You came to kill Paul Mick. But since you came to my room, it\u2019s the end for you.\u201dEvery time Bradamante\u2019s blade danced through air, blood flew and splattered. People in adjacent rooms stuck out their heads to watch the spectacle. However, they immediately returned to hiding, afraid that they would be associated with the fight.As Jin tried to clean up the rest of the assassins, something shining at the edge of the hallway caught the corner of his eye.He heard the pull of a bow string and soon realized that the glimmer came from the light hitting an arrowhead.\u2018They even prepared a ranged attacker? Or maybe\u2026 these guys were bait to begin with, and they planned to shoot Dante when he comes out?\u2019Tang!He barely deflected the arrow. If he hadn\u2019t caught sight of the glimmer earlier, he would\u2019ve gotten injured.Fwoo-fwoo-fwoo-fwoo!Subsequently, more arrows flew. It looked like they prepared at least ten archers.However, Jin had expected this much, so he used a corpse as a meat shield.Thud, thud-thud, thud!As the arrows pierced through the corpse, Jin could see the arrowhead covered in yellow poison.\u2018These bastards\u2026\u2019At this point, he was furious.Although they weren\u2019t his mortal enemies, he really wanted to know why they were going so far to get rid of some kids.\u2018I know that this contest is all about dirty, underhanded tricks, but this is too much. And these guys are too organized despite being average contenders.\u2019He threw the corpse away and ran towards the archers, jumping from wall to wall.He planned on leaving one alive for questioning. With what intention did they attack? And who ordered them to do this?Just as the first five had poor swordsmanship, the archers didn\u2019t have great aim.Things would have been different if Jin moved in a straight line, but instead, his sporadic movements prevented them from hitting him.\u2018I need to wrap it up ASAP. Someone might attack Dante while I\u2019m not in my room.\u2019As he quickly closed the gap, his sword began to glow.Some of them began to run away, and Jin let them.He personally wanted to chase and execute them, but Dante\u2019s safety was his priority. Jin could kill them anytime, but getting the Hairan Clan\u2019s prospective successor indebted to him was a rare opportunity.Slash! Slice!Heads fell to the ground. He didn\u2019t even need ten seconds to kill three of the four who didn\u2019t escape.\u201cS-Save me.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201dBam!Instead of attacking with his sword, Jin threw his fist at the last archer, rendering him unconscious. Soon after, he dragged his newly acquired hostage back to his room.The spectators who watched from their rooms didn\u2019t even make a sound.\u201cPhew. Hey. Wake up.\u201dSlap! Slap! Slap!As soon as he returned to his room, Jin slapped the hostage awake. Meanwhile, Dante was still fast asleep.\u201cEuk! Erk!\u201d\u201cAlright, starting now, I\u2019m going to ask you something, and you\u2019ll have to answer every time. If you answer to my satisfaction, I will send you back. If not, I\u2019ll send you to the sky. And if you don\u2019t answer within three seconds, you\u2019ll also go to the sky. Understood?\u201dHe nodded.\u201cFirst, who are you guys?\u201d\u201cP-Pirates. I-I\u2019ll explain more! Please lower your sword. We\u2019re One-Eyed Joe\u2019s underlings. He\u2019s the winner of last year\u2019s arena rumble.\u201d\u201cSecond, why are you going after Paul Mick? In such an organized way too.\u201d\u201cCaptain Joe\u2026 said that Paul Mick was an important figure in a big clan, so he told us to capture him.\u201d\u201cDid he say which clan?\u201d\u201cHe said that it was probably R-Runcandel\u2026\u201dJin instinctively grinned.\u2018You do this shit despite thinking that he\u2019s a Runcandel? Well, they say that ignorance is courage when combined with confidence.\u2019\u201cWhy are your arrowheads poisoned, then? He asked for a hostage, not a corpse.\u201d\u201cWe have an antidote.\u201d\u201cThen, third. Where is Joe? Is he also in the arena?\u201d\u201cNo, he came as a spectator this year, and he only ordered us to capture Paul Mick.\u201dDante entered this competition in Jin\u2019s past life as well.And that time, he became these guys\u2019 hostage. The Hairan Clan were able to retrieve Dante after giving them an inconceivable amount of money and solemnly swearing that they wouldn\u2019t take revenge.Like a butterfly effect, the Hairan Clan faced internal failure and many consequences.Jin didn\u2019t know much about the backstory of the clan\u2019s internal failures due to its secrecy, but he knew that he had just changed history just by saving Dante.\u2018Hm\u2026 Just as this guy said, Dante was kidnapped last time. Then these pirate fuckers held him hostage and took a big bite out of the Hairans.\u2019Even if they were a renowned clan, if an important figure were to get caught, the clan could only be dragged along. Especially when the hostage was their next patriarch.\u2018Of course, if it were the Runcandel Clan, they would just tell the pirates to kill the hostage and would proceed to slaughter the kidnappers, their families, acquaintances, and even unrelated individuals. Everyone would die\u2026\u2019That was the Runcandel method. Strikingly different from other big clans.\u201cAlright, perfect. I like it. I\u2019ll spare you.\u201d\u201cTh-Thank you!\u201d\u201cInstead, leave two fingers here.\u201d\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d\u201cJust as I said. Leave two fingers here. If not, leave your head here.\u201dLosing one\u2019s fingers was better than getting beheaded.\u201cKraaaaah!\u201dUltimately, the pirate trudged back to his room after blowing off some information and leaving some of his fingers in Jin\u2019s room.The young Runcandel sat back down and waited for Dante to wake up.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *Dante woke up after seventeen hours, around dinner time.And as soon as he awoke, Jin explained everything that happened since he passed out.He went on about how much he did to keep Dante\u2019s ass alive, and how he captured one guy and found out about One-Eyed Joe as well as his gang of pirate gangsters.\u201cSo they mistook me for a Runcandel and tried to capture me\u2026 That One-Eyed Joe guy is definitely crazy. I find all of this absurd\u2014laughable. A Runcandel? Absurd!\u201dHe let out a deep laugh and shook his head. Seeing Jin\u2019s soulless eyes, Dante continued.\u201cAh, since you are my savior, I must explain. As they suspected, I am a noble. Although I\u2019m not a Runcandel\u2026 I\u2019m a little embarrassed to tell you my clan\u2019s name. Will you understand if I just say that I\u2019m a noble from the Vermont Empire?\u201dDante thought that Jin\u2019s attitude would change if he revealed that he was a Hairan.While traveling with an alias, whenever his status got revealed, he had often seen his friends suddenly act like servants.Noticing Dante\u2019s intention, Jin cleared his throat and contained his laughter.\u2018Well, I don\u2019t need to tell him that I\u2019m Jin Runcandel. He\u2019ll find out soon enough. And Beradin\u2019s fat mouth will blabber about it anyway.\u2019Jin nodded.\u201cEhem! I understand. Everyone has that moment when they want to conceal themselves.\u201d\u201cI appreciate it. Anyways, I\u2019m very thankful that I came to you. If I kept fighting them, I wouldn\u2019t be able to fend them off for so long\u2026 I don\u2019t know how to repay this debt.\u201dSaying this, Dante\u2019s eyes were filled with genuine gratitude.\u201cYou probably do not understand the great feat you have accomplished\u2026 A knight like you doesn\u2019t seem to want capital. I cannot express my gratitude with one great sword or anything material!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not much.\u201dInside, Jin felt good. He certainly knew that he successfully planted indebtedness inside Dante.\u2018Yes, yes. I don\u2019t need a sword or money. I like the guilty, indebted heart that you have towards me.\u2019Dante concluded his thoughts and turned towards Jin.\u201cThe best way is to offer my life to you. From now on, whenever you are in danger, whenever you need me, I will fight by your side with my life. I swear by my name.\u201d\u201cHmm, do whatever you want. Anyways, as we promised, I\u2019m gonna sleep, so just protect me well. Wake me up when group 13 starts.\u201d\u201cUnderstood! Ah, and me protecting you right now is unrelated to my solemn swear.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dZzzzzzz.Jin instantly fell asleep just like Dante did in the morning.And as he stared at Jin who slept soundly, Dante thought to himself.\u2018Now that I think about it, I don\u2019t even know this guy\u2019s name. I hope we meet in the finals\u2026 Whatever the result, there is much to tell my parents.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (7)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]Jin\u2019s battles the next day were not that different from Dante\u2019s.His opponents were introduced with pretentious names like Hellia\u2019s Demon King or something, but it took only seven seconds to kill them.Once again, the audience went quiet, and Beradin led the crowd to cheer.\u201cThis year\u2019s arena finalists must be those two.\u201d\u201cThat Jin Grey fellow is incredible, but it\u2019d be hard for the Runcandel provisional flag-bearer\u2026 Who are you betting on? Jin Grey? Or Paul Mick?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still with Paul Mick. After seeing yesterday\u2019s fight, I contacted the main house and brought all of the money. You should bet on Paul Mick too. He\u2019s a Runcandel. A Runcandel! Who could beat a Runcandel when it comes to the sword?\u201d\u201cHm, good point\u2026\u201dJin showed off his amazing sword skill, but the nobles in the audience were already certain that Dante was the Runcandel Clan\u2019s provisional flag-bearer. It was no longer just a rumor to them. More and more money accumulated onto Dante\u2019s pool, and not that many bet their money on Jin.Thanks to Jin, the other contestants naturally became irrelevant. The previous year\u2019s finalists, victors, and veterans\u2014who were supposed to lead the event\u2014seemed underwhelming.\u201cDammit. Those kids are making it hard to touch some money this year.\u201dMost of the contestants were murder enjoyers, but as much as they enjoyed killing, what they wanted most was money.More than the grand prize of 1000 gold coins for the competitors, receiving a portion of the pool from the host was much more important.\u201cShould we just kill \u2018em off before the rest of the preliminaries? I think we can get \u2018em if the veterans band together.\u201dThe distributed prize money for the winner would increase as more bets accumulated on one person. Other\u2019s fortune could only be a pain for the veterans.\u201cHold on. Did you not see the One-Eyed Pirates get destroyed? This year\u2019s contest is those kids\u2019 stage. If you want to save your life, you gotta stay out of it.\u201d\u201cGoddammit\u2026\u201dSince the veterans\u2019 mood was this sour, the other contestants had to team up amongst themselves.\u201cUntil the end of the preliminaries, let\u2019s fight minimally. That way, we can come back next year and earn money. We can also bully the newbies too.\u201dThe veterans\u2019 plan was to manipulate the victory. They planned to stage ambiguous battles without killing each other. That way, they could guarantee easy money by distributing the bets.The guide relayed all this information to Cosmos.\u201cHa, so they\u2019re plotting something, eh? Bullshitting the fight to bathe in some money\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat should we do? If the competition gets boring, then we\u2019ll have some problems next year.\u201dHmm!Cosmos scratched his gold tooth with his index finger and shook his head.\u201cChange the preliminaries around. Make sure that Paul Mick and Jin Grey don\u2019t awkwardly meet and fight each other in the quarter-finals of something. They have to meet in the finals.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cThe most important part of the show is to give what the audience wants. They want this duel more than the slaughterfest, so it\u2019s all we can do. Instead, make sure they can\u2019t bet anymore, and increase the other guys\u2019 distribution pay.\u201d\u201cThen who should meet Jin Grey and Paul Mick throughout the rest of the preliminaries?\u201d\u201cStick them with the One-Eyed Pirates. We can\u2019t let the other veteran contenders die, since we gotta use them next year.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of dissent from One-Eyed Joe if he hears about it.\u201dCosmos burst into laughter.\u201cYou idiot! If Paul Mick really is Jin Runcandel, do you think he\u2019ll live? The One-Eyed Pirates were done for as soon as they pissed him off. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Good point.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The remaining rounds in the preliminaries proceeded quickly.As much as it was staged, it wasn\u2019t as bloody or brutal as the previous year\u2019s.The veterans just broke some bones and effortlessly wrapped up their eventless battles, causing angry shouts to ensue from the spectators.They could tell that the fights were staged.Despite this, however, no one left their audience seats. They knew that, after all of the boring battles, they would be able to see the duel between Jin and Dante.And every time Jin or Dante faced a One-Eyed Pirate in the arena\u2026\u201cOhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cPaul Mick! Paul Mick!\u201dAlthough neither of the crowd favorites really did anything special, the crowd would go wild. The two didn\u2019t even need to brutally murder their opponents.The two fellows finished their battles within one or two swings of the sword. From the preliminary rounds all the way to the semifinals, all of their battles easily ended like that.And finally came the finals.\u201cThey finally face each other today.\u201dThe entirety of the audience awaited their appearance. Beradin had come out to watch without sleeping a wink due to anxiety.\u201cWho do you think will win between those two?\u201dBeradin asked his bodyguards.\u201cPaul Mick.\u201d\u201cSeeing the previous battles, I think that Paul Mick\u2019s swordsmanship is better.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 You think?\u201d\u201cYoungest Master, what are your predictions?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 bet on Jin. About 100,000 gold\u2026\u201d\u201cH-How much?\u201d\u201c100,000.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve bet too much. If Jin Grey wins, would Cosmos be able to match that amount? The odds are three to one. I don\u2019t think such a pirate would have that much money.\u201d\u201cNo, they\u2019re bigger than we thought. They can pay as much as 300,000 gold. If they sell some of their islands, that is. Ohhh, they\u2019re starting!\u201dCosmos walked out to the middle of the arena.\u201cThank you for waiting, ladies and gentlemen! I greet you once again today. I, Pirate King Cosmos, thank you for being here for the grand finals!\u201dCosmos bowed towards the audience.\u201c\u201c\u201cWOOOOOOO!\u201d\u201d\u201dMany cheered after seeing him introduce himself.\u201cFuck off and just bring out the kids!\u201d\u201cYeah! Just proceed with the finals, you dumb pirate fuck!\u201dAnd there were also those who swore at him.Cosmos could only feel disappointment. Usually, the audience would shower him with cheers and flowers for hosting such a great show.\u2018These stupid noble bastards. When was it that you gave me a thumbs up for inventing the best show in the world\u2026 Starting next year, I\u2019m gonna raise the entrance fee!\u2019Cosmos stood up, hiding his dissent.\u201cYes, yes! I understand. Paul Mick and Jin Grey. I\u2019m sure you are itching to see their battle\u2026 Why don\u2019t we call them, then? Paaauuul!\u201d\u201c\u201c\u201cMick! Paul Mick!\u201d\u201d\u201dDante was more popular than Jin. It was unavoidable, since the audience thought that he was a Runcandel.As Dante entered the arena, there were many who screamed their hearts out for him.\u201cAlright, and his opponent! The nameless teenage swordsman, Jin Grey!\u201dAs Jin entered the stadium, the cheers were significantly quieter. Instead, there were many who had their hands together on their forehead, praying for their desired outcome. They were the gambling addicts who saw the three-fold gambling multiplier and brought all of their life savings to use for betting.Despite their misprediction of Dante being the Runcandels\u2019 provisional flag-bearer, people definitely thought that he would defeat Jin. Until now, Dante had freely and skillfully handled his sword and crescent slashes, and Jin had not.So, the people who bet on Jin prayed for his victory.\u201cJin Grey! Let\u2019s goooo!\u201dBeradin stood up and screamed with bloodshot eyes.\u201c\u201c\u201cLet\u2019s gooooooooo!\u201d\u201d\u201dOther audience members who bet on Jin began to scream as well.\u2018Go where, you sick fuck.\u2019Of course, Jin didn\u2019t give them a single glance and walked to his side of the arena.He felt significant pressure. Not because of the gamblers who bet their lives on the line, but because he was uncertain if he could actually defeat Dante.Jin Runcandel and Dante Hairan.The two faced each other with a calm expression. Unlike their other fights, they purposefully left thirty steps between each other. One more step would be within striking range. They were standing still, but a crippling tension stifled the two contenders.As the audience went silent, Cosmos opened his mouth once more.\u201cOh my, I didn\u2019t think that my arena would become like this. This is like watching a dueling championship between famous clans\u2026 Then, let\u2019s begin the final battle!\u201dTooooo~!The pirates blew the horns, and Cosmos ran out. The two contenders slowly unsheathed their swords.Simultaneously, they conjured their aura, and their swords began to glow.\u2018There\u2019s no opportunity to strike\u2026\u2019Jin could not make the first move as per usual. Even without clashing swords, he knew that Dante\u2019s swordsmanship was better than his. He felt it ever since he first watched Dante\u2019s fights.As for Dante, he couldn\u2019t strike first as well, but not because he thought Jin was better.\u2018Strangely, I sense something ominous. I don\u2019t know what it is, but something\u2019s up.\u2019After hitting 7-star, it was the first time Dante felt uncertainty while in the presence of a sub-6-star, and he fell into a dilemma. Does he use all his energy to finish the battle quickly, or does he observe his opponent and slowly wear him out?To begin with, he never entertained the idea of losing\u2014never thought that he would lose to Jin.\u2018This sense of foreboding must mean that you prepared something to face me. In that case, I should take it slow.\u2019Thinking that he should be extremely cautious, Dante stepped forward. He chose to take precaution instead of closing the gap and finishing the battle quickly.At that moment, Jin smiled in his mind.\u2018I guess you chose to carefully take me on. It means that my chances of defeating you just increased by ten percent.\u2019Jin had already planned a method to defeat Dante.He, as well, never considered losing this fight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (8)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]One step forward.Jin matched Dante\u2019s movement and closed the gap a little more. Subsequently, Dante took another step, and Jin mirrored it again. Prudently searching for an opportunity to attack.\u2018This is more nerve-racking than I thought. Five more steps and Dante will start his atta\u2014Hmf!!!\u2019Jin unconsciously stopped.He had a strong feeling that Dante\u2019s attack would begin earlier than expected.\u2018Left? Right?\u2019His eyes flickered to the left, then to the right. Then, as he focused his attention back to the middle\u2026Dante had disappeared.Swoosh!And the familiar sound of a sword traveling through the air went to his ear.\u201cErk!\u201dSurprised, Jin raised Bradamante, and Dante smiled as he flew towards Jin.Clang!The impact that traveled through the sword hilt was incredible, as if an explosion occurred within his sword. Within the heavy blow was an energy as sharp as shattered obsidian.If Jin even lacked a little less hip and lower-body strength, his stance would have collapsed immediately. He let out a sigh of relief. Then, he calmly took steps towards the left to retreat from Dante.\u201cI tried it, thinking that there was a possibility of it working. But as expected, it didn\u2019t.\u201dDisappointed, Dante licked his lips. Jin cracked an awkward smile instead of responding.\u2018He\u2019s faster than I thought\u2026?\u2019The battle could\u2019ve finished on the first sword swing. Jin\u2019s entire body was covered in goosebumps, and his back was covered in sweat. All the while, Dante looked very carefree.\u2018This is like Lady Alisa\u2019s top speed. If it weren\u2019t for the 110 battles that we had, there would be no way I blocked that attack. What kind of observation game is this, crazy bastard? You tried to finish it in a single strike.\u2019Although a little surprised, he could feel that he improved and grew a lot.Additionally\u2026\u2018And if this is his top speed, it\u2019s super winnable.\u2019He was certain. With this certainty, Jin also thought that, if Dante could attack any faster, there was no way of winning.Wooooom!As Jin prepared to swing his sword, Dante\u2019s blade was covered in a more potent aura.\u201cIf I can\u2019t win with speed, I\u2019ll do it with strength.\u201d\u2018Just what I wanted!\u2019Jin had no time to respond. Dante had already begun to swing his sword, and Jin was still gathering his aura to defend.He was too slow.Boom! Boboom! Boom!Every time their blades met, sounds of explosion echoed. Instead of two sharp weapons, it sounded as if two blunt weapons were hitting each other.\u201cWhooaaa!\u201d\u201cIs this really a fight between kids?\u201dCompliments could be heard all over the audience. They all expected a great battle between the two, but they didn\u2019t think it would be this entertaining.Beradin, oblivious of his sweaty hands, clenched his fists.In the beginning, Jin looked as if he was being pushed to a corner. But as each second passed, he caught up to Dante\u2019s tempo. When they were about twenty swings into the fight, the two looked evenly matched.\u2018That was his top speed!\u2019Jin was certain of it after matching swords multiple times.No matter how talented Dante was, there was no way a 19-year-old could surpass the speed and strength of a former Vermont Special Forces agent.All Jin had to do now was to hold on.\u2018Dante only increases his speed at strategic moments to ration his energy. I just need to barely match his tempo until he gets exhausted.\u2019Jin\u2019s plan to take down Dante was simple. He would utilize the only trait that he had an advantage in against Dante.Stamina.\u2018I felt it when he came to my room. Dante has shockingly great skill, but his stamina is very low.\u2019Dante\u2019s body didn\u2019t complement his skill, and that was his weakness. He was 19 but looked around 13 or 14. He had a very small physique, which made it hard to believe that he was 19. He could raise his power and strength using his aura, but altering his endurance was beyond his range of ability. If his stamina were as great as his sword skill, then he would\u2019ve never requested Jin for help.On the other hand, Jin was blessed with the Runcandel Clan\u2019s renowned physique. His physical strength, endurance, recovery rate, and agility surpassed most if not all human beings.He could survive the nights in the arena without Dante.But the same could not be said for Dante.\u2018The key is how fast Dante realizes that my stamina is far greater than his.\u2019Dante\u2019s stamina was incomparable to Jin\u2019s. Dante had always attempted to overcome his weakness, dripping blood and sweat. He also executed inconceivable amounts of training.Which was why it was hard for Dante to realize.That he still lacked one major trait compared to the 16-year-old in front of him.Outclassed by innate talent.\u201cYou\u2019re holding on well! If you have something coming, you should bring out all of it now. Starting now, I\u2019m gonna get a little faster.\u201d\u201cIf I bring out everything I have, you\u2019ll get depressed, idiot.\u201d\u201cYour jokes are pretty average, just like you. I like that.\u201dSlash!Dante\u2019s blade slit Jin\u2019s thigh. It wasn\u2019t a deep cut, but blood still splattered. Jin gritted his teeth. It was close. If it were a little deeper, it would\u2019ve been fatal.\u2018I\u2019m gonna have to let him get some shallow cuts on me.\u2019The problem was the need to dodge every lethal swing. Since the tempo was faster, Dante\u2019s stamina would deplete faster. However, as Jin received more shallow wounds, he also got gradually exhausted.Losing blood meant that he was also losing stamina.\u2018Conversely, I can\u2019t give him a single scratch until he gets tired.\u2019Still, with hopes of victory, Jin gritted his teeth and kept dodging. As long as he maintained his current speed, he extrapolated that he could continue with the battle for at least an hour.\u2018But that guy will go for the win at some point.\u2019Dante wasn\u2019t an idiot.Although it looked as if Jin was losing and Dante was carefree, there was no way Dante would be oblivious of Jin\u2019s plan. Ultimately, he would find a way to outplay Jin\u2019s defense plan.Evading that attack was crucial. Another cut on the shoulder. And while dodging a storm of jabs, Jin got a cut on his hand, almost letting go of his sword.He backed off, tore off a part of his coat with his teeth, and wrapped his hand to cover the wound. Dante tilted his head in confusion.\u201cHe\u2019s done for! End him!\u201d\u201cJust a little more, Paul Mick!\u201dAll of the spectators who had bet their money on Dante began to shout and scream. To their eyes, Jin looked like he was getting single-handedly beaten, so they thought the battle was soon to be over.However, Dante finally realized it.\u2018He knows that he has more stamina than me, so he\u2019s dragging out the battle. And finally I know\u2026 that you were also using an alias\u2026!\u2019Jin Runcandel.If he was a Runcandel, he would have an inconceivable endurance beyond Dante\u2019s knowledge.Putting aside the cuts on the thigh, shoulder, and hand, if Jin possessed a normal body, he should\u2019ve fainted during the shockwaves from the clashing of swords.Dante mouthed Jin\u2019s real name, and Jin smiled.\u2018So you figured it out?\u2019Hoo, hoo\u2026Jin felt that Dante\u2019s breaths were getting hoarse. His own breaths weren\u2019t the same as in the beginning of the fight, but he still had more breathing room than Dante.\u201cI guess it\u2019s my turn now.\u201dAs the audience\u2019s energy and screams continued to fill the arena, this time, Jin charged towards Dante. The spectators\u2014who had their money on Jin\u2014stood and screamed.\u201cLet\u2019s gooooo! Let\u2019s fucking gooo!\u201dJin\u2014who had been on the defensive the entire fight\u2014began to attack.And Dante began to look back to see where it all went wrong.\u2018Damn it. I should\u2019ve finished him off at the beginning!\u2019He didn\u2019t need much time to make that conclusion. If he didn\u2019t have that sense of foreboding at the beginning, Dante would\u2019ve already won.\u2018Then what was that feeling? My instincts were telling me that a careless attack would be dangerous.\u2019Dante could not work out that what he sensed was due to Jin\u2019s two suppressed abilities\u2014spiritual energy and magic. If Jin used those abilities, Dante wouldn\u2019t even stand a chance.An inherent terror that came from a \u2018stronger opponent\u2019.Clang! Clang!Jin swung Bradamante with all his might and began his attack. Dante\u2019s stance staggered, urging him to back off.Jin only did a single movement in each attack.The swing he practiced ten thousand times with maximum effort every day. One that he could replicate three thousand times.\u2018Jin Runcandel, you monster. You still had this much energy left\u2026! On top of that, how is a simple swing so heavy?\u2019Jin continued with the same vertical swing, and Dante could not easily escape from it.Each time Bradamante fell on him, it felt as if a massive wall pressed upon him. He had neither the time nor strength to change his stance.At this rate, in a few minutes, Dante would experience an embarrassing defeat to the same swing. So he had to come to a decision.\u2018Do I have to use the clan\u2019s secret technique\u2026?\u2019Unlike Jin\u2014who hadn\u2019t learned any secret decisive killing moves\u2014Dante had already mastered multiple secret techniques from his clan. These attacks had the potential to flip the battle completely. He could easily use it with his remaining energy.However, he was faced with a dilemma.\u2018But I don\u2019t want to kill you.\u2019If he used his secret technique, then Jin would certainly die.Which prevented him from using it. Although they had only met a few days ago, Jin was a very important person to him.A savior. A worthy opponent. A mountain that the Hairan Clan must overcome. The Runcandel Clan\u2019s youngest son.A friend.Dante made a conflicted expression while sorting out his thoughts, and Jin knew exactly what he was feeling.\u2018He\u2019s hesitating because he doesn\u2019t want to kill me. If not, he would\u2019ve gone for the win by now.\u2019Clink.Jin sheathed his sword and looked Dante in the eye before speaking.\u201cI am Jin Runcandel. Don\u2019t go easy on me, Dante Hairan.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (9)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]The two had stopped moving, but the audience continued to shout and scream. Even though the tables had turned significantly, with hope in their bets, the people contributed to the loud noise.Jin\u2019s words were overpowered by the wild crowd, and the two just stood and stared.\u2014Don\u2019t go easy on me.Hearing those words, Dante felt embarrassed.\u2018Yeah\u2026 It could look like that. It could look like I\u2019m going easy on you.\u2019In whatever situation, refusing to hurt the opponent meant failure as a warrior. That was disgraceful while confronting an enemy, and even more disrespectful in front of a worthy opponent.\u2018Is there anything more embarrassing than going easy on an opponent that I value?\u2019The problem wasn\u2019t whether or not to use his secret technique.It was whether or not he would try his best without hesitation.Ending the battle without doing so would be pointless regardless if he won or lost.\u201cI apologize for showing such disgrace. Let\u2019s start anew.\u201dDante pointed his sword at Jin, meaning to tap swords to represent respect for each other. Jin used his sword to tap Dante\u2019s, emitting a soft musical sound of metal hitting metal.And at that moment, they experienced a weird feeling.The shouts and screams grew faint, like an echo traveling in a canyon. Their surroundings blurred and gradually became dark. In their world, it was just the two of them, standing in front of each other.They both trusted that either one of them would put up an exhilarating fight. They didn\u2019t need to talk to share this feeling. It was a common hallucination that swordmasters enter when dueling their rival.\u201cThen let\u2019s begin.\u201dWhew.Hoo.They simultaneously took a deep breath.It was difficult to tell who struck first as they clashed swords. Unlike their respectful sword taps in the beginning, the impact of their blades caused blinding sparks to scatter.Sounds akin to explosions, the screech of metallic friction, and wind echoing throughout; aura flickering everywhere.As if his exhaustion was a lie, Dante swung his sword more energetically than before. Jin, as well, channeled the rest of his energy in his attacks with a shout.Dash.Because of the impact, blood and sand splattered and sprayed throughout the arena.In a moment where they should be cheering, the crowd grew quiet from shock. In their eyes, the two fighting teens looked like giants, and they didn\u2019t dare to blink lest they would miss a moment of the fight.It had been ten years since the arena had opened, but they never had a moment like this. The spectators\u2014who originally came to watch a cruel slaughterfest\u2014were now blessed with a spectacle. They were witnessing a duel between two talented knights.At this point, the gambling aspect of the arena became irrelevant. Of course, once the battle finished, some would be laughing, and some would be crying.Still, as of this moment, everyone was astonished by the fight.\u2018Maybe I kind of underestimated Dante. I was sure he was exhausted, but where did this power come from\u2026?!\u2019Blood dripped from Jin\u2019s lip. He was too busy deflecting Dante\u2019s attacks to notice that he had been biting his lip.Dante\u2019s feel for the sword was a god-given talent, but his strength and stamina were painfully average.No, how much effort did this undersized boy\u2014who was born with below-average physical traits\u2014put into training? How many times did he kneel in despair before overcoming his fatal flaw?Those who trained until death could notice the amount of effort in others. As for Jin in his past life, he remembered the seemingly eternal hell of being unable to overcome the 1-star wall despite having the Runcandels\u2019 blessed body.So he could easily picture Dante\u2019s past. Him curled up like a little ball in a dark training room, staring at his small and frail body in the mirror with distress. He who trained and whipped himself until he was on the verge of death and exhaustion.And in all those moments, he never let go of his sword.Just like his own past life.However, unlike the past Jin, Dante persisted through each hardship.\u2018Makes me shed a tear.\u2019Dante\u2019s hoarse and husky voice was born from all of the shouts and screams he channeled in order to overcome his challenges.Shudder, shudder.Dante began to tremble.From wandering through hopelessness to becoming the prospective successor of the Hairan Clan and having the motivation to try harder and harder after each tiring day.Simply because he was one with his sword.If he weren\u2019t, even if he were a noble in an empire, life would merely be a boring stage play.Dante was like that.\u2018Jin Runcandel. Runcandel\u2019s thirteenth young master.\u2019As each strike of the blade vibrated throughout his body, Dante thought about Jin.\u2018You were born with everything you needed.\u2019The bloodline of every knights\u2019 dream. A durable body that came from the blessed bloodline. Jin\u2014who became a 5-star at the age of 15 and was now 16\u2014could face Dante head-on.The most talented among the talented.\u2018Why am I feeling desperation from you, then? Despite being born into a world considered a heaven for knights, you act as if you\u2019ve been watching this heavenly world from afar.\u2018Why are you so desperate? Why, despite being born with everything, do you have such emotions dyed in your blade? Is it because being the heir to the throne is far from reach as the youngest son? No, you are not an earthly being to fuss about hierarchy\u2026 Is it just to become the best in the world? Or is it because you had lived many days of hopelessness and despair? Are you saying you had more days of anguish than I did?\u2018Who are you, Jin Runcandel? \u2026No, it doesn\u2019t matter who you are. Today\u2026 is the day I prove that my efforts weren\u2019t in vain.\u2019Crackle.As he exerted force into his sword\u2019s handle, Dante could feel cracks crawling throughout the bones in his hands. Excruciating pain traversed his body, yet he didn\u2019t falter.Instead, he smiled.Crrraaaack\u2026Every time he swung his sword, his bones would suffer from more fissures, but his movements didn\u2019t change in the slightest\u2014not even his shoulders, chest, waist, and feet.Although his stance began to fall apart, Dante did not despise his weak body.\u2018I\u2019m just fighting because I love to.\u2019Dante was smiling as Jin began to dominate the battle. He knew he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u2018Dante\u2019s body\u2026 is falling apart?\u2019While Jin felt the sword closer than his skin, he could feel Dante\u2019s exhaustion through each clash of their swords.Once he felt that his victory was within reach, Jin felt anger more than joy.\u2018Why are you not using your clan\u2019s decisive killing move?! Are you hiding another skill that I don\u2019t know about?\u2019He was wrong.Dante staggered back, looking as if he were a beast that had used all of its energy. Although his eyes glimmered with a burning fighting spirit, he was truly on the verge of fainting.\u2018You definitely had the chance. You still don\u2019t hesitate to slash me, so why\u2026?\u2019It was now Jin\u2019s turn to decide.\u2018Do I slash him, or do I not?\u2019He didn\u2019t need to think for long.\u2018Putting away my sword would mean disrespecting you.\u2019Clang~!Jin swung a horizontal swipe. Dante deflected the blow, but his body shook. Barely maintaining his balance, Dante felt more bones breaking in his body. Before he could turn his head and track Jin\u2019s movements, Bradamante was already on its second strike.Thankfully, there was hesitation in the blade.\u2018You bastard! Why?!\u2019Gritting his teeth, Jin changed the trajectory of his swing, which was supposed to slash through Dante\u2019s chest.Because he forced his sword to move unnaturally, his hands cramped up. Bradamante flew out of Jin\u2019s hands, and Dante aimed his sword towards Jin\u2019s throat.It looked like it was purposefully aimed. However, before he could even thrust it, his body lost all control.In fact, Dante had already lost consciousness before Jin\u2019s second attack.Thud!Dante fell on the dirt floor.Jin rapidly blinked and breathed coarsely as he stared down at him.Time seemed to stop in the ensuing silence.At that moment, the audience held their breath.And as for Jin, he had many complex feelings. Victory aside, millions of complicated emotions heated his body. He prayed that Dante didn\u2019t die. However, he was certain that he died, but he felt a little scared to check.Instinctively, he sat on the ground beside his body and checked for his pulse. Jin couldn\u2019t feel anything due to his own blood pumping through his fingers.\u2018We have to call a doctor\u2026!\u2019The moment he tried to yelp for a doctor or anyone who could treat Dante, an audience member jumped out of the spectator area and into the arena.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dBodyguards followed the teenager into the arena.Beradin Zipfel\u2019s hands glowed with a warm, green light as he sprinted on the dirt. He was already preparing a healing spell halfway through the battle, worried that he would lose either one of his friends.\u201cBeradin\u2026!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll save him!\u201dBeradin kneeled beside Dante and chanted a spell.Then he cast two more.Beradin had cast three healing spells consecutively, displaying his insane talent for magic. However, at this very moment, Jin was only concerned about Dante.Beradin\u2019s expression didn\u2019t look great as he chanted the spell. Not even ten seconds had passed, yet his entire body was drenched in sweat. Jin wondered how much mana he channeled.Even though he was using a spell that could instantly heal a fatal wound, Dante\u2019s eyes were not opening.While Jin and Beradin\u2019s hearts ached, the young Zipfel lowered his hands and shook his head.\u2018Shit. This isn\u2019t something that could be healed with magic\u2026!\u2019All of Dante\u2019s insides were messed up.Not a single bone was intact. In fact, his broken body was burning with aura. Not even Holy King Mikellan could revive him with a miracle.\u2018Jin.\u2019Beradin whispered Jin\u2019s name.\u2018Beradin, Dante is\u2014\u2019\u2018Listen well. This will stay between the three of us.\u2019Following his words, Beradin revealed something from his cloak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99 \u2013 The Cosmos Arena (10)[Translator \u2013 jhei][Proofreader \u2013 yukitokata]\u201cYoung Master, that\u2019s\u2014!\u201dAs soon as they saw the object that Beradin revealed, the guards\u2019 faces turned white in fear.The young Zipfel put his index finger over his puckered lips.\u201cQuiet. And use your capes to cover us up.\u201dThe guards bit their lips and surrounded Beradin, Jin, and Dante with their capes.The crowd began to chatter, whispering amongst themselves at the sudden turn of events. No one detested Beradin\u2019s actions after seeing the Zipfels\u2019 insignia on the guards\u2019 capes.\u201cThe Zipfel Clan\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat fellow\u2026 was a Zipfel?\u201d\u201cOh, what will you do? When that Zipfel cheered for Jin Grey, you swore at him to cheer for Paul Mick.\u201d\u201cYeah, maybe I-I\u2019ll go home first.\u201dAs soon as the Zipfel coat of arms was revealed, everyone\u2014including the pirates\u2014became as quiet and calm as a flock of sheep. Even Cosmos, the host, did not dare to step into the ring to intervene with the current state of events.\u2018Shit\u2019s going down. Did he come to kidnap Paul Mick because he\u2019s a Runcandel?! Dammit. One wrong move and I\u2019ll be saying goodbye to my pirate life. I must act professionally.\u2019\u201cEveryone, close your eyes and plug your ears!\u201dCosmos shouted. The charismatic host who warmly welcomed his audience suddenly ordered the sealing of the senses.It was a very laughable situation, but the audience actually listened to his orders. Not a single person smiled or laughed.The Zipfel Clan was not a force to be reckoned with.\u201cThat fellow\u2026 He knows what\u2019s going on. Maybe I can discount 100,000 gold from my winnings.\u201dBeradin had pulled out some kind of gemstone. At first glance, it was a spherical ruby. However, upon closer look, it had a much deeper shade of red\u2014as if it were blood compressed together.And they detected an ineffably weird energy from it.\u2018That\u2019s\u2026?\u2019Jin had also seen it from somewhere.But he could not exactly remember what it was. It wasn\u2019t something he saw physically, but something he saw through a textbook when he was a student.\u201cIt\u2019s Numerous\u2019s Blood.\u201dThe moment Beradin divulged its name, Jin\u2019s jaw dropped.NumerouslThe God of Hope who disappeared because of a few incidents before the rise of the Holy Kingdom of Vankela.All Numerous left before disappearing were eight teardrops and a hundred drops of blood, and humans led a bloody history in order to collect these artifacts.Numerous\u2019s Tear was an item that could resurrect the dead.On the other hand, resurrecting the dead wasn\u2019t easily possible with Numerous\u2019s Blood. However, it could heal any injury or sickness with ease.So far, seventy drops of blood had been used, and the rest were still missing.It was the most pursued artifact at first, but as it became more rare, its existence became a myth.And one of those mythical objects was shining in front of him.\u201cWhat\u2026? Using this on Dante now\u2026?\u201dAlthough Numerous\u2019s Blood was a tier lower than the Tear, it could not be replicated anywhere. The Runcandels and Zipfels were still searching with bloodshot eyes for more copies.\u2018And the Zipfels had one of them!\u2019In fact, it wasn\u2019t even the patriarch who had it. It was in the hands of Beradin who came out for a trip. Jin could not understand.It implied that the Zipfel Clan exclusively reserved the Blood for Beradin. The world\u2019s greatest clan, the Zipfels, only had two of the gemstones.\u201cShhhhh, let\u2019s keep this between us. Me, you, and Dante.\u201dJin couldn\u2019t ask why he was going to use it on Dante.From a rational perspective, Beradin\u2019s actions were unreasonable. Although the Hairan Clan was smaller than the Zipfel Clan, they were still competing with each other. And Dante was the prospective successor of that clan.As of the moment, Dante\u2019s death was the best-case scenario for Beradin.\u2018However, I also feel the same. Although Dante\u2019s death is beneficial for the Runcandels, since he put away his sword at the last moment\u2026\u2019Beradin grinned.\u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to explain to you why I\u2019m doing this.\u201dBeradin placed Numerous\u2019s Blood near Dante\u2019s mouth and spoke. Using magic, he cracked the gemstone, and a red mist emerged. The crimson clouds of energy slowly slid like water into Dante\u2019s mouth.Shshshshhhshhshh\u2026\u201cOh, and no need to thank me. Losing a rival is as sad as losing a friend, am I right?\u201dFlinch!As soon as Numerous\u2019s Blood entered his body, Dante reacted. They couldn\u2019t see what was happening within him, but his pale face gradually reclaimed its normal color.\u2018Beradin Zipfel\u2026 I didn\u2019t think you would do something like this.\u2019Jin never thought that he would be so unpredictable. Doing a massive favor for another person who was no different than an enemy. He wasn\u2019t an easily judgeable character.While Jin trapped himself in complicated thought, he had one clear emotion.\u2018He has a cool side to him.\u2019Puah!Dante breathed hoarsely, as if he came out of water. Shocked, he looked at his own body in amazement. He knew that he escaped from the verge of death.\u201cHow in the world\u2026?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s have a drink after the closing ceremony, Dante. You\u2019re gonna tag along, right, Jin? Don\u2019t say no. And whenever we meet anywhere, it would be nice if you noticed me.\u201dJin remembered dismissing Beradin at the Runcandel banquet. Jin chuckled.\u201cSure.\u201dAs Dante slowly stood, Cosmos looked around and concluded that the issue was resolved. Then he knew what the three teens needed as of the current moment.To make it look as if nothing had happened.In reality, the audience didn\u2019t know what transpired underneath the cloaks. Just assumptions that Beradin treated Dante with his magic.However, everyone questioned the young Zipfel\u2019s actions upon helping Paul Mick, who was assumed to be a Runcandel. Still, no one expressed curiosity as they valued their own life.\u201cAlrighty! That was a heated battle! The victor is the nameless teenage swordsman, Jin Grey! Ladies and gentlemen! Please give them a round of applause!\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *The closing ceremony began that night.The arena that was once filled with murder and assassination became a place of celebration. Whenever they had the chance, the surviving contestants sprayed wine on the floor to honor the dead contenders.Usually, everyone would start stuffing their faces with great amounts of food.However, people merely drank wine, not daring to eat before a Zipfel.\u201cThe victor, Jin Grey. Please step forward!\u201dJin stepped towards the podium made out of stacked wine bottles.Cosmos waited in front of him with a trophy made out of shark bones as well as a bag containing 1,000 gold coins.And at Cosmos\u2019s feet was a small treasure chest. It was the secondary prize.He could choose between 1,000 gold or the chest with an unknown prize inside it.\u201cAlrighty, choose your prize! Gold or treasure chest? What do you choo\u2014\u201d\u201cJust give me both.\u201dJin responded, tired of the place. Laughter exploded from the audience.In the history of the arena, it wasn\u2019t the first time the victor requested for both of the prizes. But never this blunt.\u2018I didn\u2019t get to sleep for the first few days, and I almost killed Dante while fighting him. Risking my life to take these pathetic prizes\u2026 and to choose only one?\u2019He could not accept it.Remembering the wave of despair when he thought Dante was dead, Jin thought that even owning Cosmos\u2019s entire pirate gang didn\u2019t satisfy his frustration.\u201cI understand that you want to have it all, haha. But you see, kid, we have this thing called tradition.\u201d\u201cAnd I can annihilate that history and tradition today.\u201dCosmos frowned then nodded.\u201cYeah, okay, buddy. Take it all\u2026\u201dAt that point, Cosmos and the spectators knew that Jin was some hotshot from a famous clan. The Pirate King let him do as he pleased simply because he didn\u2019t want to mess with him.\u2018This runt kinda feels like he\u2019s from the Hidden Palace\u2026 Ha. Starting next year, I\u2019ll make sure to do thorough background checks. Make sure that there are only lowly runts who I can control.\u2019After the ceremony.While the drunkards rampaged the arena, Jin and Dante reconciled in the cell they first met.Together with Beradin, who escaped from his bodyguards.\u201cWow\u2026 You two\u2026 lived here for multiple days? My goodness. I wouldn\u2019t even survive one day! Even my clan\u2019s stables are better than this.\u201dBeradin cracked open the luxurious wine, which he ordered the bodyguards to bring before the event.Glug, glug.While each goblet was filled, Jin passed the bag of gold to Dante.\u201cYou\u2019re giving it to me?\u201d\u201cYes. You take it.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2019re the victor.\u201d\u201cWell, don\u2019t take it if you don\u2019t want it, then.\u201dDante stared at the bag then shook his head.\u201cNo, I shall take it. Although the Hairan Clan has a lot of money\u2026 I will place this upon a pedestal when I get home. To commemorate this moment.\u201dWith a lifted mood, Dante took the bag and shook it. A solid jingling sound echoed throughout the cell.Seeing Dante\u2019s look of satisfaction, Beradin licked his lips in disappointment.\u201cJin, me too. Gimme something too. Some souvenir. Today was a special day for me too.\u201dEyes glimmering, Beradin put his two hands forward.\u2018Do it yourself.\u2019Jin would have responded heartlessly. However, since Beradin really did something special today, he felt kind enough to offer him something.Jin wanted to keep the shark bone trophy with his name on it.So only the treasure chest was left.Thinking of a good idea, Jin nodded.\u201cWait a sec.\u201dClack!Jin broke the lock and opened the chest. This was the first time he revealed the contents of the box.\u2018Paper?\u2019Inside the box was a poorly drawn topographic treasure map with an \u2018X\u2019 near the middle.\u201cOh? There\u2019s ancient texts on there. I\u2019ve never seen those characters before. Interesting\u2026 Give that treasure map to me\u2014\u201d\u201cNo, your souvenir is the box. Take it.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s great too! Thanks!\u201d\u2018One guy says that he\u2019ll display the bag of gold on a pedestal, and the other is thankful for some garbage. Are they idiots?\u2019Jin chuckled. As he laughed, the other two began to laugh as well. Then, Jin straightened his expression, and the others coughed.\u201cHey, Dante Hairan. Let me ask you something.\u201d\u201cOh, ehem. What would you like to know?\u201d\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you use your secret technique? I\u2019m sure I said to not go easy.\u201dDante scratched the back of his head and responded.\u201cYou\u2026 did not use your secret power and went easy on me too. Therefore, I didn\u2019t think that my secret technique would make it a fair fight.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There\u2019s no way\u2026 Did he detect my magic and spiritual energy?\u2019Recently, the number of people who knew about his alternative powers increased.However, it was power that should not go public yet. Jin tried his best to conceal his nervousness and looked Dante straight in the eyes.\u201cSecret power? What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Jin, did you already learn the Runcandel Clan\u2019s decisive killing moves?\u201dBeradin abruptly joined the conversation. Since he became a 7-star magician, he awaited a similar growth from Jin as well.\u201cAh\u2026 It was just a hunch. There was never a time where my guts lied to me during a battle. I knew from the moment we clashed swords. Whether I can win or lose\u2026 Stuff like that. And even though your swordsmanship seemed to be duller than mine, I still felt like I would lose.\u201d\u201cReally? How cool.\u201d\u201cUltimately, I failed, so my hunch was correct. However, if you really don\u2019t have any secret techniques or powers, then I held back for nothing.\u201dAt Dante\u2019s words, Jin just smiled outwardly. But inside, he was surprised. Dante\u2019s hunch was spot on.\u201cAnyways, be prepared the next time we fight. I will give it my all.\u201d\u201cJin, Dante. Me too. I\u2019m awaiting the day we all lead our respective clans and have a legendary battle.\u201dDante\u2019s and Beradin\u2019s eyes glimmered with fighting spirit.Although they were sitting in a circle with a wine glass in hand at the moment, they would have to fight each other someday.Enemies that were friends, friends that were enemies. Their relationship was like that.\u2018However, when the time comes, I don\u2019t think I can kill you.\u2019As silence ensued, Dante was trapped in his thoughts.\u201cBut on that topic, becoming allies after fighting wouldn\u2019t be that bad. Just settling on a victory and becoming good friends again and all\u2026\u201dBeradin broke the silence while scratching the back of his head.\u201cI would\u2019ve never thought the prospective successor of the Zipfel Clan would speak such soft words.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a hope! Hope! You mess up a little, and you both die to me, hehe. Oh, but besides that, the craziest thing happened to me.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Beradin?\u201dDante showed interest, and Beradin clenched his fist.\u201cYou know the Akin Kingdom? It\u2019s a kingdom that\u2019s part of the Lutero Magic Federation, and apparently, someone impersonated me there last year.\u201dJin would\u2019ve spat the wine in his mouth, but he safely retained composure.\u201cHa! Is that true? In the land of the Lutero Magic Federation, impersonating you\u2026 A man with no brain. So, what happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026Surprisingly, they haven\u2019t caught the culprit. Apparently, the impersonator destroyed the underground organization known as Tesing. A very weird intent. And the clan\u2019s investigators can\u2019t find anything.\u201d\u201cWhy not put a bounty?\u201d\u201cDoing that means soiling the Zipfel name, Dante. It\u2019s basically advertising that the all-powerful Zipfels can\u2019t find a measly impersonator.\u201dJin calmly explained, and Beradin nodded.\u201cExactly. And recently, we lost Lord Andrei\u2026 It isn\u2019t something to bring up right now. Oh, Jin. It wasn\u2019t to make you uncomfortable. It isn\u2019t even confirmed that the Runcandel Clan is the culprit behind his death.\u201d\u201cBut what if it is?\u201dTo Jin\u2019s question, Dante coughed and glanced at Beradin.The young Zipfel shrugged.\u201cWe, as well, killed many from Runcandel. It\u2019s just a debt-repaying relationship. So when the time comes, it\u2019ll be equal\u2026 And to be honest, I didn\u2019t really like him. In fact, I hated him.\u201d\u201cSo the prospective successor of the Zipfel Clan did not like the old geezer of a second-in-command. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something you should say without caution. What do you think, Beradin?\u201dJin calmly spoke. He wondered why Beradin didn\u2019t like Andrei.\u2018Is it because Andrei lost the way of the pure magicians by using the Demon God\u2019s Orb? Or just his different perversive temperament? Either way, the orb should be a big deal for the entirety of the Zipfels\u2026\u2018But before that\u2026 does Beradin even know about the orb? Seeing him, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll have some sense of hesitation for human experimentation or gathering contractors for the orb, but he would do it anyway. It could be related to the reason he disliked Andrei.\u2019But it wasn\u2019t something Jin could ask about.\u201cIt\u2019s just something I say. I can say that I don\u2019t like someone simply because I don\u2019t like them. We\u2019re close enough to say that stuff, right? I believe we are!\u201d\u201cHoho\u2026 Hearing you say such complaints, I\u2019ve also thought of annoying stories from my clan. Someday, I shall get rid of all of those peasants!\u201dPointlessly blabbering about personal problems within the clan in front of the enemy.An act only an idiot could do.\u2018Dante is definitely a certified idiot, but I don\u2019t know about Beradin. He\u2019s definitely not the average guy.\u2019In addition to that, using Numerous\u2019s Blood for Dante.Bringing up the dead Andrei and saying that he \u2018hated him\u2019. It was hard for Jin to pinpoint Beradin\u2019s intent.Within a few seconds, Beradin raised his voice again in fury.\u201cOh shoot, the conversation strayed too much. Anyways! The impersonator. We can\u2019t put a bounty or anything, but we couldn\u2019t just gloss over it\u2026 We\u2019re thinking of putting the high-star magicians into investigation.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re deploying 8-star magicians to catch a mere impersonator? The Zipfel Clan truly is a great clan.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? The Hairan Clan can do that as well. Jin, what do you think?\u201d\u201cIf I were you, I\u2019d just say that there was no impersonator and that I destroyed the Tesings.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cBy your words, the culprit used your name to destroy an underground organization. Did he harm the kingdom\u2019s citizens?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s the opposite. Recently, Akin seems to be having a festival every day. It appears that the Tesings\u2019 corruption was insane.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019d be better to take credit for the outcome. In fact, since the culprit hasn\u2019t been caught, he\u2019ll probably impersonate you again. As the tail grows longer, it\u2019ll be easier to catch. Deploying high-star magicians would be foolish.\u201d\u201cHm\u2026 Good point. I guess I was going too far. I should ponder on this more.\u201d\u201cIf you catch the culprit, please inform me. I would like to see such a courageous man.\u201d\u201cAlright. For the time being, Dante, make sure to visit one of our banquets. I\u2019ll make sure to send an invitation.\u201dThe three spent the night talking and drinking.Apart from Dante and Beradin, Jin reserved his words\u2014for one reason.\u2018More words could hit me in the back.\u2019Although it was a short meeting, that night, he wished they were his friends. Not enemies.* * *\u201cYoung Master! For what reason did you use Numerous\u2019s Blood on Dante Hairan?\u201d\u201cAnd you should\u2019ve killed Jin Runcandel on the spot. It was an opportunity to kill off your competition!\u201d\u201cMake that part a secret. And as for this treasure chest, make sure it doesn\u2019t get a single scratch when it gets back to the clan. Hehe, it\u2019s a very nice souvenir.\u201d\u201cWhy is it so important? Don\u2019t blame us for wasting such a valuable artifact.\u201d\u201cStop, stop. Gaining Dante Hairan\u2019s trust is nothing bad. From losing one drop of blood, it\u2019s raising the chances of having the Hairan Clan on our side when we wage war against the Runcandels.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cAs for not killing Jin, there are some things I needed to check. I\u2019m gonna sleep until we return, so you guys are dismissed.\u201dThe bodyguards mumbled in disapproval and left.And Beradin sighed.\u2018Well, Father and the elders will find out soon enough. The excuse for Numerous\u2019s Blood is fine, but what do I tell them about Jin\u2026? Should I say that I couldn\u2019t have won? That wouldn\u2019t seem like a lie\u2026\u2019Beradin\u2019s future already seemed grim.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 jheiProofreader \u2013 yukitokataJoin our Discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://dsc.gg/reapercomics* * *\u201cI\u2019m sorry, grandfather. On top of losing the competition, I\u2019ve had a close encounter with death. Twice.\u201d\u201cYou almost lost your life in an insignificant competition\u2026? How did this happen? Was it a lack of swordsmanship or was there a master who was blinded by money?\u201dThe patriarch of the Hairan Clan questioned Dante. In contrast to his words, his expression was not the slightest bit angry.He felt proud as soon as his grandson returned. His adorable and precious grandson returned home with lessons learnt.\u201cI did not lack such sword skill, but resilience. Additionally, there was no such master, but two friendly boys.\u201d\u201cHoho, hearing you say that, I\u2019d like to hear some more. You don\u2019t even bat an eye towards the most beautiful women in the clan\u2026 Alright, what are the names of these fellows?\u201d\u201cGrandfather, unfortunately, I cannot tell you of their names\u2026 Instead, I would like to request something.\u201d\u201cYou little\u2014!\u201dRon embraced Dante and jokingly choked him.However, he did not press and ask for the boys\u2019 names. Changing his grandson\u2019s mind was harder than rising to the top spot of his clan.\u201cKurgh. I c-can\u2019t breathe.\u201dEven though it was a joke, the choke was still painful as it came from a 10-star knight.\u201cYou make your grandfather disappointed as soon as you come! However, I forgive you. What is your request?\u201d\u201cIn whatever situation, please let me save these acquaintances.\u201d* * *\u201cOh, you\u2019re back? How was it, kid? Did you get beat by Dante or Donte or whatever-his-name-was? Your expression\u2019s a little grim. Don\u2019t you think, Strawberry Pie?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by grim? Of course I won.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, are you tired? You don\u2019t look too good. I congratulate you on your victory\u2026 but did you fall into a dilemma? Did you get poisoned or something of the sort?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, Gilly. I\u2019m just a little tired. How were you guys without me?\u201d\u201cOh, Lord Jin! You\u2019re back! Whoa! This time, victory in a fighting competition! As a celebration, please sign the back of my shirt!\u201dEnya ran towards Jin, offering him a pen and her back.\u2018A celebration.\u2019Jin took the pen and looked at his other hand. He held the shark-tooth trophy tightly.\u2018Those idiots. They won\u2019t keep the bag of gold and treasure chest as souvenirs, right?\u2019Jin smiled as he signed Enya\u2019s shirt.\u201cThank you for appreciating me, Miss Enya.\u201dHe was thankful that he had friendly people who would offer him all the love and kindness in the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
